{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Good phone.  Great value.", "Author": "Ken Farrar", "ReviewID": "R13SLTRQYPX08Y", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This phone was a risk/faith buy.  I scoured reviews to try and make a best guess on this order.  I made the leap and about 2 and a half weeks later found out if there was a pay off.  Phone worked fine.  Very little set up.  It works fine with ATT and I have read it will work with any \"sim card\" carrier.  I have owned this phone for over three months and put it through some test.The cover it comes with is very useful and I prefer it over any case.  Samsung cases do not fit because the buttons are slightly different and do not align.  I use mine mostly for talking some texting and a lot of apps.  I tend to play one game at a time so I haven't really tested the capacity of its memory.  I don't use it as an MP3 player so I cannot comment on its music playback.What it does do is work.  It works fine as a phone.  Works fine as a text device.  Works fine playing apps.  I have had it lock up on me four or five times loading an app.  A simple restart worked fine.  I have found that powering down once in a while keeps its speed up.  I might add that my old Samsung phone locked up a lot more frequently under less stress.  Speaking of reboot, it will load up from a restart very quickly compared to my old smart phone.YouTube works fine, as does Netflix.  The camera works good in well lit situations.  The flash is pointless as it is weak and low light photos will not turn out good.  Spring for a real camera if you want to take a lot of pics worth printing.  If your just into facebook selfies and occasional snapshots with no editing this will work fine.  The front facing camera works as expected for a 1.3mp, grainy low quality.  But that's to be expected.  Video recording works same as the camera and it picks up audio well.  The speaker is good also, as long as there isn't too much background noise.The headphone jack is an odd size so you'll have to pick up a spare at Radio Shack or special order it here.  It has a longer plug.  The phones that came with it are adequate.  If your considering this phone you likely don't own \"Beats\".  Besides watching a movie on a 5\" screen doesn't require the highest sound quality.  The screen display works fine.  Video playback is smooth and works well.  The clarity is better than I expected and on par with with my Samsung.  I haven't had any screen issues.The phone feels very solid, it has good weight and no part really feels \"cheap\" or \"poorly made\" with the exception of the cover I'm using.  It is a combination:  back and flip over cover.  It seems cheap, but has lasted three months with no damage.  So despite the \"feel\" it is holding up better than expected.Overall I am extremely pleased with this purchase.  There are some odd quirks to it.  Spell check in texting says everything is wrong.  I haven't cared enough to see if there is a way to fix it.  I have added most words to the dictionary over time, so I only occasionally get a red line now.  Further it comes with two batteries, but no way to charge the second one or store it.  So i'm not really sure of the purpose.  I'll hang on to it in case the first battery fails it is nice to know it's there.  Also the GPS on this thing is pretty lousy.  It doesn't pick up my location unless I'm outside.  And by outside I mean with nothing over my head, trees, car roof, porch, clouds...  I don't use it for driving though.  I'd recommend purchasing a real GPS for driving putting it on the dash gives it a spotty signal.  WIFI signal detection is good.  It picks up my signal throughout my house.  Although my house is small I have brick walls between rooms and signal strength is fine throughout.*** SD card slot works fine I forgot to mention that.  Also this phone has a feature I've not noticed on any phone I have had before.  You can record phone conversations by pushing the menu button during a connected call.  It gives you the option to start and stop recording.  People also comment on the size of it, a lot. . .  That always makes me smile.  I plan on buying my son one also.This is not a name brand phone, but works better than I thought it would and meets my needs beyond my expectations.  Its performance suits my needs and after three months continues to perform as well as the day I opened it.  There are a lot of negative reviews, perhaps they got a dud, or were expecting an iphone mistakenly shipped to them.  I have seen some tech heads spout off some of this phones short comings, but I use it for four things, A phone, Texting, a few apps and occasional browsing.  For these things it works fine.", "Date": "September 2, 2013"}, {"Title": "Buy this phone!! It's Awesome!!", "Author": "readerluver", "ReviewID": "R29C5E0IBQ47AD", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "First let me say Amazon is Awesome!! I bought this phone from USA Wholesalers. But it was fulfilled by Amazon so I got it delivered to me in two days!! The color I got was white and I love it. I was kind of scared because there were so many good reviews on it. So, in the back of my mind I was like this all cant be real. But guys I did my research. I looked up reviews, watched youtube videos and all. After about a week of research I went ahead and bought this phone. I am sooooo happy I did. I took out my SIM card from my At&t; \"unsmartphone\" and popped it into the STAR in about a minute it saw that it was an At&t; SIM and BOOM!! Everything was working!!! And I mean everything So now I have a \"Note\"(guys it look just like it and that's what EVERYONE thinks it is) Smartphone. All prepaid for 50.00 a month(plus tax depending on where u live). And everyone else I know who wasn't as smart as all of us(that is if you buy the phone) is paying 100.00 or more for a Smartphone plan. And under contract, worrying about going over minutes, texts, and data. I don't have to worry about any of that, pay way less than them, AND my phone is the COOLEST ever!!! Lol. Just a little of what it does:In minutes I downloaded Skype, Facebook, Mp3 music downloaded, about 10 songs. ALL OF IT WORKS!When my teenage niece and nephew saw my phone (15 & 16, u know teenagers know about phones) they thought it was a \"Note\" and loved the screen and size. While I was visiting they had my phone the entire time. Taking pictures with the front and back camera. Downloading cool games for me, like fruit ninja(love that Geico commercial..lol) and temple run,etc. They didn't want me to go Bc they loved my phone..lol(and they both have Driod phone by Verizon).The only small \"con\" I can say right now is the battery doesn't last as long as a non smartphone. But it does last pretty good taking in consideration I've been playing with it all day on and off.Listening to music, downloading songs, on facebook, texting, making calls,etc. After all that its just a little below half full. I started using it this morning full force so its been about 10hours. So u can be the judge on that. Its pretty cool with me. I'm going to go buy a car charger so when I use turn-by-turn navigation, I won't have to worry about my battery dying.  And it comes with two batteries anyway. So I am good!! So good luck guys I hope my review helps you in your journey for an Awesome phone!! Do your research, don't rush if you're not sure. But if you're like me after you're research you will be back, and buy this phone!! I don't think you will regret it. I know I am loving it right now!! It's a very good choice!!! Happy Hunting!!!", "Date": "April 13, 2013"}, {"Title": "Read THIS BEFORE YOU BUY!", "Author": "Prize Udo", "ReviewID": "R2AZCL00AANJ1J", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "If you plan to purchase this phone, I suggest using NEWISLAND \"satisfactory\" customer service, as far as overseas customer service is involved. Please don't expect to be catered to as if you are dealing with 5-star hotel chain, its just not possible when dealing with a foreign shipper and manufacturer. So you have been cautioned. Be open minded, non-hostile if a problem arises, and you should be fine.Now to the Phone:This is the second Clone Note that I have bought in the past 2 months. The first model was the (n8000), it ran on the newer Jelly Bean Os. As far as performance is concerned to the average smart phone user it was great. One draw back to the phone however was the speaker quality. Even with the volume turned up, it was a challenge to hear. The back of the phone is a very flimsy plastic, most sellers will send it with a back cover to compensate. It is adequate for a \"short\" period of time. I did end up returning the phone because of one HUGE problem. I used Straight talk as my provider, and when I inserted the sim it worked in a matter of minutes. When I placed my second call though, the screen BLACKED OUT! Not only did it black out but I wasn't able to end the call, press anything on the screen, or even turn the phone off! Why did it happen? Your guess is as good as mine, but for that reason the phone went back. ( I did not purchase it from NEWISLAND)I was not willing to give up that easy so I tried it again only this time with a different model, the Star I9220.This phone runs on Icecream Sandwich, and Straight Talk DOES NOT OFFER a Android update as of now. The phone had very similar features to the N8000 model, both run smoothly and are built pretty much the same in terms of quality. The screen is smaller than the SAMSUNG NOTE II, and the buttons are also in different places, so don't think you can buy Samsung products for this phone, no Samsung case will fit it. This phone was almost about to meet the same fate as the N8000 model because the SAME SCREEN problem existed after the second call!!!!!'I was so disappointed, but I thought \" let me play with it for awhile maybe the problem is with me\". Well after trying to place 20 more calls the same issue kept occuring. I allowed the phone to charge the entire night and woke up the next day to play with it some more not expecting any change. The same thing kept happening the screen would now flicker to where it was normal and then off again. After some negotioation with the seller, who later agreed to refund my money, the phone miraculously began working properly!The point is that nothing works out perfectly the first time, and generric phones are No exception. You will hear some horror stories about them, but then again don't we hear bad experiences from just about any and everything?Phone Specs:The front camera...well it has a 0.3 resolution meaning its bad...really bad. You definitely need a room flooded with lights to get any type of use out of it.The back camera is decent, picture quality is as good as any comparable  smart phone out there. The flash is a bit weak, but again with the right lighting it is a good camera.The call quality... is very good. I used my blackberry 9850 to phone a friend, (yes blackberry) and then called on the STAR, he said he couldn't tell the difference. The speaker quality is fair, not as good as higher end phones, but definitely not the worst either.The fluidness of the phone is GREAT! Google Play is already installed and there isn't a lot of other junk that is pre-installed on phones from big providers. In this department you won't miss a beat. Don't worry about compatibility issues as if American apps need special formatting to work with a Chinese phone, remember software is universal so in this case ANDROID apps, Java, HTML, or whatever program you're concerned about is covered. If not root your phone and work it out.It uses CDMA and GSM sims and is capable of 3G speed. It doesn't support 4G so if your provider is charging you for 4G, get a phone that can support it because THIS ONE DOES NOT SUPPORT 4G.Ear phone plug is weird, it doesn't fit regular male ends that are like 3.5mm I think. This one is definitely does not receive a 3.5mm plug. So beware of that especially if you are like me and need/want your phone to play music in the car!T-moblie, Straight Talk, Cricket, and Boost work with this phone. T-mobile doesn't function that well with the phone. The sim I have it in from T-mobile doesn't support video chat, why? I don't know that one either. But all other calling features are seamless.I hope this review helps, for the price and features this phone is a good buy. Don't expect 5-star customer service from any manufacturer overseas, they are doing the best they can...I think. And be prepared to wait to get your phone. You may be able to track it once it leaves China, but you probably won't be able to track it again until its state side.Love the phone hopefully you will to.Cheers!", "Date": "March 6, 2013"}, {"Title": "Great Android device!!!", "Author": "Omar M.", "ReviewID": "R1M6C4NNZ8I2WP", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This cell phone is amazing.

The phone is bright and fast and the resolution is as good as my previous Galaxy S-2 with a much bigger screen on this one!

Was I wrong. First I got the phone 8 days after I ordered it. I was going out of town for the weekend and I REALLY needed this phone on the Thursday before I left town. I got it!!! So when I opened it it was HUGE! So amazingly big! So I ordered a case for it before I got the phone. I was nervous because since the phone is different from the S3 and Note it wouldn't fit. But it did!!! Ok so I turned it on and it was SUPER fast. I plugged my sim card in and bam it worked instantly. I went into settings to set up the 3G and it worked but was so slow it might as well had not worked at all. So I connected it to wifi and it worked super fast. So I downloaded all my apps!!! In fact since this is the newer android operating system the apps I had on my old phone worked so much better on this one!!!The picture clarity is great the video quality is even better! I don't know who says it isn't! I went to a concert last night and recorded some clips. They were pretty legit for as far as I was. The sound wasn't to bad and overall the quality was good! Better then my friend who recorded on her iPhone. My phone is bigger then those who have the newest 5inch samsung device!!! I know how jealous do you think they are when they see my massive phone!!!Back to the internet. So over the weekend I was connected to my boyfriends portable wifi device so even when I was out I was still connected. Today when I came back home I didn't connect to my wifi device right away. It connected its self to 3G. I could upload videos and post on facebook and read on Huffington Post or just do basic web/app stuff but when I tried to load a video on to facebook it took forever until I reconnected it to wifi and then BAM it loaded instantly. So is the 3G the best. Well another customer said day after day the 3G speed started well speeding up. So after 3 days it went from not working to working. I could dock it a star BUT this phone is just so amazing and for the price I feel like its almost a steal!!!! My friends paid twice as much for an equally good phone! \\Oh make sure you have a SD card. The phone memory is low and I think people fail to realize so are most phones except for like the iphone because it has all its memory in the phone but when you go to most carriers and buy a phone it comes with a SD slot and without it you use the internal phone memory pretty quick so please don't assume because its from another country thats why it sucks on memory. Most phones do thats why they come equipped with SD cards. This phone does not come with one so I advice you to get one!Thanks again seller for an amazing phone!!!", "Date": "March 3, 2013"}, {"Title": "Up and Running on Straight Talk", "Author": "StarMetro", "ReviewID": "R1RRLNXR35XP2Q", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "My n9000 arrived today, three weeks after I placed my order with lolbuy. The seller replied quickly to questions, but he did not send the phone in the color that I requested. Along with the phone I received two cases (one front-and-back flip case, one back-only), two batteries, a USB charger, USB cable, headphones, and a small stylus. So far the phone is great overall: speedy and responsive, with a camera that's better than I had expected. As others have mentioned, the headphone jack is wonky. The headphones that shipped with the phone fit perfectly, but other headphones do not work properly (the jack on standard headphones isn't quite long enough for this phone). The phone also lacks an LED notification light.The phone immediately recognized my Straight Talk SIM card (I'm using Straight Talk on AT&T;'s network).If you want to use Straight Talk for data, you will need to update the phone's APN settings.

They all were so beautifully built.  The only minor thing to complain about is the manual.  It's about 2 by 2 the printed words were so small that I couldn't even tell whether they're in English or in Chinese.  Not a problem since I had a trash can nearby.I decided to play with it for a few days before writing this review.It came with a regular old SIM card while my old Nokia Windows phone use a Micro one.  A trip the local AT&T; store taken of this minor problem at no cost.  (The salesman dared to talk me into another Windows phone.  Now, I know why people are killing each other.)I added an old 16 Gig Micro SD card and it worked well.Now, let get to the main subject, the phone.  Before buying this, I spent a ton of times reading reviews and I knew there is a certain amount of risk for buying this.  It's built in China and if there is something wrong with it, it's going to take a long time to get a replacement or a partially refund.  But since I was so sick and tired of my useless Nokia 9000 Windows phone, I decided, \"what the heck?\"It took me a little while to get used to the Android 4.00, but I've learned quickly since I have used one before.  The phone was fairly big but surprisingly light and it fits perfect in my shirt pocket\u2014any shirt pockets.  The voice is clear and could be louder but it's alright for me.  The speaker, again, could be louder but good enough to put on my desk and talk while typing.The Wi-Fi is fine, fast enough to watch YouTube without delay.  The gyration works fine, even it was slow some times.There are two things that surprised me.  First, the camera has on screen touch focus feature and a panorama mode like Apple.  The picture is 4000 by 3000 pixels and its quality is average.  In video mode, 480 x 640, products very nice movie.Second, the battery last much longer than I thought.

When I went to change the APN Settings for the phone as per Straight Talk directions, the \"APN SETTINGS\" option was grayed out and wouldn't let me change anything.  Straight Talk suggested my phone is not unlocked.  Has anyone else had this problem and hopefully know what to do about it?  I purchased from Seller_pro2011.  Thank you.UPDATE: BayKilla415, I think you may have been right, thank you for your comment.  I went ahead and ordered a new AT&T; SIM from straight talk and that did the trick.  Three things of note after having the phone for a week+: 1).  The home button rarely wakes the phone from sleep anymore (rather annoying since putting a galaxy note case on this phone requires also using one of the cases that came with this phone to fit properly and that makes it impossible to adjust the volume and wake the phone from sleep without taking it out of the cases (since these buttons are too recessed with two cases on) - a major annoyance when the home button to wake from sleeps stops functioning).  2).

Package was fairly well wrapped, the box was a little bent on one corner but overall- fine. I was happily surprised upon opening the box, it contained:phone, 2 batteries, headphones, very nice flip case, complimentary laser pointer, and manual. Note- there is a screen protector already on the phone.-The phone itself- looks much better than I had hoped for. I kind of assumed it would be at least little cheap looking, but it isn't! There is really no way to tell it from a 600 dollar Samsung!-speed-very quick. No lag whatsoever on any app or menu I've gone throughWifi- So-so. Noticeably slow connection at some points, very quick at others. Kinda random.GPS- You DO need a data network to use the GPS function...which I do not have yet so cannot comment on it.Charging-I'm not the best person to comment on this, but it seemed as if it takes a very long time. But again, I just upgraded from my 5 year long ownership of a Samsung intensity...which fully charged in about 30 minutes. Also, I haven't noticed any of the weird touch reactionsCamera-Pretty crappy compared to pretty much any other smartphone. Quality was pretty similar to my 1.3 mp, 7 year old intensity.Screen-Not terrible, but definitely noticeably worse than most other newer smartphones.Edge Cutter-Didn't have much interaction, but I emailed him, requesting a white phone, and he responded very quickly, and I received a white phone as requested.Overall-Very,very impressed with the phone considering the price. When you think about it, you could pay 4-500 more for a Samsung, but you get so few benefits from that extra cost it seems almost ridiculous to go that route.", "Date": "February 6, 2013"}, {"Title": "Quality Product", "Author": "Clayton Davis", "ReviewID": "R3G0MSKBE3LY0R", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Believe it or not, this is a quality phone for those of you not obsessed with technology and can handle something not quite a top notch phone but pretty close. The back camera is decent quality, front not so much but not terrible either. I love the size. i messed with this for a few days and then gave it to my wife becuase she just loved it compared to her mytouch she had. It is the equivalent of the Note from Samsung. This is a 3G phone and runs pretty good on the T-Mobile Network. It is kind of spotty in some areas and the internet lags a bit but if you have WIFI in your house this device runs off of WIFI great. Still waiting on the case for it, not sure if it will fit. Noticed in a lot of the other reviews that most dont. For the price of this device i'd say, if you cant afford the high priced 4G phones, this is your next best bet. The shipper was good and I got the phone in only 7 days! even though it said it would take a month. These come out of China and some are not pre- set in English, kind of a hassle but once I figured it out, everything is good now.  I was as skepitical as the next person about buying the Android version as I have a couple android tablets that are just crap. This is an exception though. Runs a lot smoother, touch to screen is very responsive, came with 2 batteries which is cool and an extra back. Battery life is so-so depending on what you use it for. If your constantly surfin gthe web or playing games i'd get an extra charger. You'll need it.

I was scared to purchase this....but so far, my riskiness has paid off. Overall, the phone is extremely good for the price I paid. The seller (WEIZE) was extremely nice and helpful with all of my questions. I ordered the phone on the 10th and got it on the 17th with expedited shipping. My seller was also nice enough to provide me with my tracking information from DHL and I was able to track my package up until the day I got it.The phone is beautiful. It is very solid and sleek. Does not look cheap at all. It's big, but not too big. My hands are pretty small, but it fits into my hand comfortably. It came with 2 batteries, headphones/mic, usb cord and charger adapter, cover, and a screen protector. So far, there are no glitches. It runs smoothly and its fast. I've seen people have problems with the space on the phone, but I haven't had that problem yet and I've downloaded a total of 6 pretty large apps. The headphones that came with it are great!! I love them because they have this bass-boost affect when I listen to my music .. but the earphone port is a little weird when it comes to American store bought headphones. But ive heard they can be found at radio shack. Set up was easy for the most part. I used a Straight Talk SIM from Walmart..the one on the T-mobile network. Activating it was easy and so far, my talk, text and internet (without wifi) works, but i'm having trouble with the picture messaging. I'm still messing around with the apn settings.The camera is not that good, but it's okay. With good lighting, it can take really beautiful pictures. Dark lighting, not soo much.Call clarity is great. It is loud and there's no static.The speaker is really loud. I can hear my phone from the other side of the house.I'd definitely recommend this phone, but I do understand that this phone could stop working on me at any time (according to the reviews), so I'll try to do an update.****UPDATE****It's been a week since I started using the phone and I finally found out the complete APN Settings for STRAIGHT TALK'S T-MOBILE SIM. I used the settings that came with the card, but I was unable to use MMS messaging. After days of tweaking and messing with it, I finally found some that work.The main issue is that the default APN that is on the phone has to be altered, and a new one has to be added.On the existing APN (the one that is ALREADY in the phone after inserting SIM, edit it to this (REMOVE ANY SPACES):Name: T-Mobile USAPN: wap.tracfoneAPN type: -leave blank-Proxy: -leave blank-Port: -leave blank-Username: -leave blank-Password: -leave blank-Server: *MMSC: http: // mms.sg.eng.t-mobile. com/mms/wapencMMS proxy: -leave blank-MMS port: -leave blank-MCC: 310MNC: 260Authentication type:-leave blank-APN protocol: IPv4APN roaming protocol: IPv4APN enable/disable: check for APN enabledBearer: UnspecifiedSave that APN, now create a NEW APN (AGAIN, REMOVE ANY SPACES):Name: T-Mobile US (same name as the previous)APN: wap.tracfoneAPN type: defaultProxy: -leave blank-Port: 8080Username: -leave blank-Password: -leave blank-Server: -leave blank-MMSC: http: // mms. tracfone. comMMS proxy: -leave blank-MMS proxy: 8080MCC: 310MNC: 260Authentication type: -leave blank-APN protocol: IPv4APN roaming protocol: IPv4APN enable/disable: check for APN enabledBearer: UnspecifiedSave this APN and Data, receiving/sending MMS should work.", "Date": "September 18, 2013"}, {"Title": "It's only OKAY....", "Author": "Jenna L.

Its sturdy and solid in construction.  My bluetooth headsets (LG Tone HBS730 and Plantronics Pro) worked great on the phone, for voice calls.  However, using the bluetooth headset, the voice activated call feature does not work.  Also, the only way to listen to music is through the handset speakers.  Earphone plug works but music plays in both places at the same time.  Also, when on a call, the bluetooth will play music from the handset but then when you disconnect from the call, the music goes back to the handset speakers rather than staying on the bluetooth.  The battery cover comes off kind of easy.  There is absolutely zero support for the phone, with exception to a couple cushy videos on YouTube.  There are no accessories available for this phone.  There are some suggestions on Amazon for phone covers that fit the Samsung Galaxy Note.  The actual cases fit but none of the ports match up, ie., on/off switch, volume control, front camera, rear camera flash, or headphone jack.Overall, I am stuck with this phone till I can afford a \"non\" generic one.

I inserted my SECOND SIM card into the phone's second SIM slot, went to \"SIM Management,\" turned on \"data\" and it worked too. Texts, pictures, data --- EVERYTHING works (I hope I didn't just jinx myself). I use the minutes I have on T-Mo's PAYG plan to talk and use the $30 unlimited monthly plan for pics, texts and data.

It's running on Android jelly bean 4.1.9 and runs any app offered in the Google Play Store. Facebook, instagram, twitter, etc. runs great. It doesn't have as many settings to the galaxy note but for a $400 difference im not complaining one bit. The GPS works flawlessly and very very accurate I have used it many times and it always came through with flying colors. Texting on the phone is a breeze just like any other smartphone. The headphone jack is a 3.5mm BUT it is a longer jack than most 3.5mm headjacks so if you want to hook it up to anything via 3.5mm cable you will need to buy one at Wal-Mart or Radio Shack etc. If you take the headphones that you recieved with your order, you should be able to find a cable for it.Pros:When using an app and you recieve a phone call it takes the call and once done with call it goes right back where you left off.Setting up with straight talk was very simple and very easy.It connected to all the bluetooth enabled devices I tried such as headset, speakers, car, etc. without a problem.LOVE the big 5.1\" screen I don't think I would ever go back to something smaller than 5\".Camera on back is great with good lighting I have seen better but it does what it needs to and does it well.

As i said before you have to have decent lighting to really capture something.I was also reading a review and wanted to say that you CAN use this phone without a SIM card BUT you can't use the phone part of it.

I think I will be able to get 3g with the new apn changes that I made, because at first it wouldn't get service at all where I live, but now with the changes I get service but not 3g (I'll update if I get 3g).

I received it sooner than the expected delivery date, I believe I waited for 2 weeks. I am currently with T-Mobile prepaid and I use the $50 unlimited plan. I put my sim card into the phone and it instantly worked. This phone is huge and everyone is always asking is that the Samsung Note because they look just alike. I am able to do everything that any other phone can do. I like that the app store is Google Play because I can download any app I want. I do like the rear camera cause it is crystal clear, but the front facing camera is waste of time. It is too dark and spotty even when you are in bright lighting. The buttons are quickly responsive. The only thing I do not like is when I play Pandora or any music player on the phone and then the phones back lighting times out after a while, it turns the phone off completely and restarts it. I don't know what that's about but I can live with that. Also I ordered about 5 Galaxy Note 1 cases for this phone and they do fit! This phone is for a great price and I would totally recommend it to anyone young and old. Oh yeah and by the way I bought my mother this phone also, and she loves it!

I put in my Simple Mobile sim card and I could make calls and texts straight away. I had to follow the company's instructions to configure the internet and MMS messages, after 15 minutes it all worked fine.Its huge, seriously big! but just what I wanted. It came with two batteries, USB cable, European and American adaptor and basic earphones. Its sturdy, picture quality is sharp, and the touch screen works very well. I've downloaded a ton of apps from Google Play, it hasn't slowed down the phone in anyway. Ive downloaded photos, videos and music from my PC, no problems here. My headphones fit the jack perfectly. Picture and video quality all more than adequate.The battery lasts for about 30 hours, again not too bad considering how I haven't been able to put the phone down since I received it.My friend has the Samsung Galaxy Note II with Verizon. She paid $299 for it and $100/month for talk, text and data, and tied in with them for two years. I paid $173 for this phone (from HD Design) and $40/month with Simple pay as you go. Comparing the phones, there really isn't much difference. The quality and capability is the same, just the buttons on the side arein slightly different places, and no stylus, but we both agree, I definitely have the better deal.Cons: it doesn't have the stylus, but I knew that when I bought it. It has the handwriting capability so I will probably buy one later.I bought the pink and black hybrid case suggested by Amazon, it comes in two parts, the pink hard plastic case then the black rubber cover. the pink section is about 1mm too small! However, when you put the black rubber over the hard case it seems to hold the phone securely. I will keep it for now and will change once there's more choices on cases.The husband has not only had to apologize, but he says he wants one too!!Im giving four stars, but will come back and give it five stars after one month, if it is still working well.I would definitely recommend this phone!!", "Date": "March 6, 2013"}, {"Title": "Great phone", "Author": "Patty", "ReviewID": "RN7ZOMG7IH57O", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I really like this phone for the price .

To my suprise the box was very sturdy so I had no worries of a shattered screen(wait for it), I scuffled through the box all the way to the bottem expecting to find my phone. In the end all I came across was headphones, a charger, and an extra battery to match the phone that never came.

So I got the phone from seller \"ProntoTech\"  it was the (N9000)in a reasonable amount of time, came with, charger, earphones, 2 batteries, and a cover flip type not very good one but will do till other cover arrives also came with a screen protector already installed on it which was great I hate putting those things on !I have service thru consumer celluar which runs off the att network, I just put in my sim and BOOM! it read it and started up right away no problems well not many couldn't get pic msgs.& data plan to connect at first but thru some very simple settings to the APN it was all fixed right away, and I'm loving this phone! it is only 3g and runs a bit slower on data plan but wi fi is excellent runs fast on wifi and the 3g isn't that slow, maybe I'm lucky and just got a good one but I've had no problems with gps(works fine),or the headphones tried 5 different  sets all but one worked fine, bluetooth works great also, to be honest I think this phone is great so far,and it didn't come pre loaded with a bunch of \"Bloteware\" that Samsung includes with there phones all that unesecary crap, one thing I do like is when  you put it to \"sleep\" it turns off everything wi fi ect and all comes back on when you hit wake/power button saves the battery which by the way is great with min.- to med use lasts day & 1/2 with heavy use about 8-10 hrs  so no issues there, front camera i'snt all that but who really uses the front camera that much? back camera is good not great but good enough, all in all its a great phone for the price ! and just a tip when your setting it up or making a call when first using and the screen goes blank or black just power off and take battery out reinsert and power up again and do a factory reset in settings you should actually do this any way b4 you get all your contacts ect. on phone and you shouldn't have any issues after that if you not phone savvy and not sure about  APN settings ect. call your carrier and have them walk you thru it.

First of all, my sim card from TMobile did not fit at all. I had to go to T-Mobile and they inserted the right sim card. This phone is decent. Everything works. I live in Chicago, so this works in the USA. The phone is big, u can make calls, text and get texting back. The edge from t mobile is slow but still works. I usually use wifi at work and at home so this doesn't bother me at all.The things I dislike are:1. The back case is not very durable.2. I feel like the screen is so bright even when adjusted to the lowest setting, not sure if this is good for the eyes. The colors are washed out and super bright. It is not clear as my Samsung S2.3. I was able to get apps such as Netflix, Hulu Plus, HBO GO, Kindle, Google Play books etc. I noticed the Netflix is slow to load.4. Home Button is very flimsy and cheap5. Camera is mediocre-be warned it only works bets in very bright lighting6. The volume is ok a bit muffled, not great7. The keyboard is mostly good. Only thing when I hit the o it sometimes hit the i and my fingers are tiny and still hit the wrong key.I gave this a 3.5 stars. I clicked 3.5 but would only have me clicked 4. So  overall 3.5Overall it is a decent phone that works. I do feel this is not the same size as a Samsung note though. I even compared the Note from Tmobile store to this. The Samsung Note is bigger. This is comparable to the S4 in size. I feel like it is misleading when people say this is the same size as the Note.For 130-140 dollars this is a good phone for a cheap price really.EDITING MY REVIEW CHANGING TO A 2 STAR: On my 4th day of using this while I was trying to dial to an important phone call the phone froze up and it would not even show the dial pad. It took me 2-3 minutes in order for the dial pad to show up. This is not a good phone if there is an emergency. Sorry I am returning this phone thank god for Amazon Prime.

Don't expect much from the cameras, they're not so great.One thing i really did like about this phone is its speaker. This phone is LOUD.

But I have to say- more bad than good all things considered.First off: there seems to be a lack of consistency from phone to phone (more to the extent that people seem to be getting 2-3(+) different phones which are quite similar (seemingly clones), and have the same basic features on paper- but which are not identical (not the same model).  At least that seems to be the most logical explanation to the various discrepancies between various other \"reviewers\".BUT, I would have to say that MOST importantly (for my phone at least): the phone does NOT have an 8GB ROM!!!The actual internal storage (for the ROM- operating system) is ridiculously small causing ALL sorts of problems for me.  What it does have (or rather: what it did come with) is an 8GB microSD card.\\A microSD card is NOT a/the ROM!!!My phone has no internal/built-in storage space/memory besides the tiny chip that the ROM/OS is installed on.  I haven't been able to figure out exactly how big it is for sure- but according to the info in the settings: 76MB are being used and there's 80MB available- of internal storage space.  So, if we just round that up to the nearest 10MBs...My phone only has 140MB of internal storage?!?!?!  Are you kidding me?!  I wonder how much RAM it's got?!Anyway, I'll add to this review at some point.  But for now I just wanted to let people know not to actually expect 8GB of internal storage space (besides the fact that the microSD card does technically go \"inside the phone\".(That's one of the lines that the seller was trying to tell me to answer my question about the 8GB ROM.  I'm no expert, but I do have a good working knowledge of the Android platform & devices.No matter who anyone tries to twist things all around- the microSD card is NOT the ROM.  And one of the consequences of having to store everything on the microSD card (since the 80MB of free space left on the internal storage device is vastly insufficient) is that any defaults of any apps you've downloaded are reset every reboot.  Any IMEs (keyboards) have to be re-enabled and then chosen again each time you reboot (or the battery dies- which often happens within several hours of being on STANDBY mode- NO usage of the phone at all!!!!)", "Date": "January 31, 2014"}, {"Title": "good service from suplier !=) and nice phone", "Author": "Chris Swiontek", "ReviewID": "R28SJSY38JT7XX", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "originally ,i received phone without 8gig micro sd card, but lighthead sent me one in the mail =)now thats service!anywho... this is a pretty decent cell.  plenty of resources on board {good cpu and ram ,and a solid graphics chip as well}. this is a fast phone with good reception.also this phone DOES HAVE GPS =) [thought i would mention it since i didnt see it listed in the description]and it works quite well[i installed IGo gps.apk and downloaded the maps for the u.s.a. and it works great} works great with AT@T and T-Mobile [i tried with both and worked fine]has built in wifi hotspot [works if you actually have a data plan} ,and the battery life was pretty good for a phone this size: i got 6 1\\2 hrs with data on-heavy use surfing web -using the gps -and playing games on it before i got a low battery warning.[so this should get ya through an entire day of regular usage =) keep in mind this is a pretty big phone=)  comes with a really nice xtra back shell with leather flap-over to cover the front,as well as just the regular back shell.its definitely worth the money,and if you are looking for a big powerful phone,this is the one to get.p.s. yes,the browser has a bunch of links for chinese sites and home page,but they are easily deleted buy going under settings in the browser,and then save your own favorite links instead. easy cheesey =)", "Date": "January 16, 2014"}, {"Title": "My First Smart Phone", "Author": "up and across", "ReviewID": "R11YG6XX5XFT2R", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "The delivery was sooner than I was originally led to believe so that was good.I'm enjoying the phone and have no problems with it.

I kind of feel like I got a downgrade instead of an upgraded phone.  Does not save messages as a draft if you have to take a call while making a text, sometimes I see my pictures in my gallery, sometimes not. It is herky jerky no matter what you are trying to do, whether it's typing a text, loading an app, or simply answering the phone.  Since I have had it, people I speak to on the phone are complaining that it sounds like there is a monk chanting on the line while we are trying to converse, making it difficult for the person trying to hear me, although I never do hear the sound myself.  I often have trouble connecting whether I make a call or receive a call, where there is just silence on the other end and neither of us can hear each other.  My husband tried to call me the other day while I was at the store, and he told me it rang twice, there was silence, then more ringing, and then some guy answered. I also get 3G very spottily, very occasionally I will get it, usually it is just edge, ONCE in a great while, 3g will pop thru for no apparent reason, and then disappear just as inexplicably.  The worst problem I have had so far is not being able to send or receive pictures in a message, which it seems I was able to fix by downloading an app off of Google Play. The app is called Tweakker, it changes your APN settings to the correct configuration for the network you are using.  I had been playing around with the APN settings, trying to get MMS to work to no avail, but finally seem to have found success with this app, and that is about the only truly positive thing I can say about this phone so far.Update, I have also discovered that the phone does not have any GPS.  There are many apps I have tried which also use the phone's magnetic sensors and GPS that don't work on this phone.  I mean, for a cheap phone, it  looks nice, is heavy and appears well put together in a durable case, but dayam, it don't do shit, it doesn't even do half what my old galaxy did.  All I can really say about it is that you can make and receive calls and texts.

This phone however had a large screen and was not too slow.My only complaints are these:- The earphone jack is too loose and my headphones slip out of the phone like it's oiled.- I had phone numbers already, and I had A LOT OF TROUBLE getting around the text messaging error. I figured out if you directly type in their contact information as a stream of numbers, i.e. xxxxxxxxx rather than xxx-xxx-xxxx, (xxx) xxx-xxxx, etc, it works just fine. I'm still trying to figure out how to fix that problem.- charger slips out too easily- it gets really hot sometimesOtherwise, things I love:- it came with 2 batteries!!!- one of the two cases the phone came with has a cover.

The longer you have it, I feel the longer you really get that it's a knock-off.Here are some more TRICKS AND FIXES:- download another browser; there's something about the built-in one that just really works terribly with this phone- the sound quality is DOWNRIGHT AWFUL; I have to push the phone's speakers directly into my ear to really hear someone sometimes- microphone quality is EVER WORSE; this is NOT the phone to do business with, I've received many many many complaints from custom service reps, friends, and colleagues that they have a hard time hearing me -- once they start saying I sound faint or far away, I cup the phone's microphone hole at the bottom of the phone so the sound bounces from my hand back to the microphone- find another charger if you can; funnily enough, the Kindle charger I had is tight enough that the phone won't fall outSome good notes:- this phone can take a beating, I've dropped it a lot of times.

So far, it's working pretty damn great! The system is fairly smooth and this thing is huge!

I placed my order on December 27, 2012 and received the phone on January 18, 2013. That's 22 days!!! I contacted the seller and continuously was promised the phone would be there in 5-7 business days from the ship date. Clearly this was false. I'm fine if it's going to take a while to ship and they TELL YOU THAT. Guess I'm just sick of empty promises all the time.Another thing I am bummed on is what came inside the box was NOT what I expected. I got the phone, headphones, two batteries and usb power connector which is white not the same as in the photo. No plastic case. No wallet flap cover thingy.All this is whatever... considering the phone works pretty good. Overall I am pretty happy with the purchase. Now I have to track down a case that will work with this thing which I did not want to have to deal with.*** UPDATE (April 2013) ***So, someone thought this was a galaxy s3 and broke into my car and stole it. Glad I had only paid this much for a replica. Over time the phone started to get more and more flaky. There's just too many issues going on with this thing. I wanted to love it, but it was just always something holding me back. I started realizing I was messing with this thing more than actually using it... Well, I almost went ahead and bought another one, but this time I oped to spend 100 more bucks and get the Samsung Galaxy S3 Mini. I know it's not DUAL SIM, but the whole experience with the S3 Mini is 100 times better.

It arrived on-time (Amazon Prime) within the two-day period. It's a big phone, but incredible. I'm very impressed. The seller even put a screen protector on the phone and I'm thankful for this because it's very difficult to do so without having many bubbles arise. The phone is FAST. I was using a phone with Android 2.2.1 system. This is a great update.Buying from this seller will get you: The phone, a charger, two batteries, back cover, back cover with attached front face cover (consider it a \"case\"), the earphone piece, and a manual.I have only had one real issue with this phone. The night I first had it, I plugged it into its new charger and went to sleep. I woke up, unplugged the phone, and the phone said 1% battery remaining. I'm not sure if the charger is faulty. I plugged it into my car charger from a previous phone and it STILL wasn't charging. It shut down soon after and I was without a phone for awhile. Thank goodness the seller sent another battery. I put it in, and the phone had about 70% power. I found a Samsung charger from years ago and that is doing the trick.One other thing - when I was exploring my new phone the day I received it, I noticed that a call had been made before it came to me. 664701 is the number that was shown as an outgoing call. I don't know why this happened, maybe the seller was checking the functionality of the phone? It doesn't bother me.I use T-Mobile, and the phone works perfectly. I can send and receive pictures just fine and my Wi-Fi works. One big issue is FINDING THE RIGHT CASE for the phone. It is NOT a Samsung Galaxy Note. It is a KNOCKOFF. The buttons and camera are not exactly like the Note. It's difficult finding a case. What's interesting is that the Samsung Galaxy S4 has the exact button and camera placement as this phone. However, S4 cases DO NOT fit this phone. I have tried. The camera is centered on the back of the phone, and the flash is UNDERNEATH the camera. The Note's flash is to the right of the camera. Hence, finding a case for this phone is difficult.All in all, I am very pleased with this Knockoff phone. I've had it for a week and it's just great. Highly recommended from the seller LIGHTAHEAD. It is worth the extra ten dollars or what-not to buy from this seller. Perhaps, just buy a different Samsung charger. That's my advice.UPDATEI have been using this phone for well over a month and I have had ZERO problems. I have downloaded several apps, browsed the web many times, personalized the phone to my liking, and it is still up to par. It hasn't slowed down. It hasn't gliched. It's a great purchase and I am a very happy customer. I recommend this phone to anyone and everyone. Yes, it is very big. However, I recently held an iPhone 4, and I quickly became annoyed with how small it was. In the case of choosing a new cell phone, I have to honestly say - Bigger IS Better.UPDATEI have been using this phone for almost six months. I have had very minor problems with it. The main issue is - if my phone gets below 15% battery and I plug it into the charger, my phone will glitch. However, this may be my own fault for using an older, longer charger. My phone does not glitch at any other time. Browsing the web, installing numerous apps, using up my SD Card - this phone has withstood it all. It still takes incredible pictures and is not lagging with speed. I stand by my recommendation.FOR THOSE WHO HAVE LEFT QUESTIONSStraight Talk:  it is my understanding that this is a pre-paid service available at WalMart. Many have asked if this phone is compatible with the service. I truly do not know. I suggest talking to someone who works in the cellular department at the store. He or she will give you thee most accurate advice.I use T-Mobile. For those of you asking about AT&T;, I feel as though this phone IS compatible with that service. If your service requires a SIM card, this phone will most likely work for you.Will this phone work in other countries outside of America? Why not? It is, afterall, an UNLOCKED cell phone. Just be certain to check this phone's return policy before-hand.This cell phone was 300% worth my money. I am not concerned with \"brand names\" and I am always happy to tell people that I have an excellent Note Knockoff. The ONE AND ONLY DOWNFALL - people's jaws will drop when you whip out your \"laptop\" and hold it to your ear. If you own this phone, I'm certain you have heard this joke countless times.

I do have to say that I am VERY happy with this phone so it is not a big deal to me. I have had this phone for a few days now... it was supposed to be her between the 17th of Oct. and the 4th of Nov. and I received it on the 15 of Oct. I ordered it on the 21st of Oct. so all in all not bad. I LOVE how big this screen is and it is bright and clear. The camera is not the greatest but it is something I can live with because it isn't too bad really and I have a camera for when I want to take really good pics. The speaker is not bad either when you need it. It came with its own case, blue tooth and a second battery, although you can't charge it separately. The battery I am sure would last a lot longer if I could put it down for a few minutes and it does take a while to charge and I have to learn patients when charging it :) I am using the sim card from Walmart's Family Mobile (T-Mobile) and it is working just fine, did not keep all my numbers though but that is because I did not save them to the card in my old phone, but putting those few in isn't a big deal either. I would have to say that for $102 (incl. shipping) I got the best phone ever and would do this all over again! I have not found anything that makes me not like this phone. I bought it through the seller Bestselling and found this transaction to be very good. Thanks for reading and I hope it helps one way or the other. I will update if I start to notice anything wrong with it.", "Date": "October 18, 2013"}, {"Title": "Better than expected!", "Author": "Dan the Saxman", "ReviewID": "RPRR50RB7K866", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I use my Note 2 as an MP3 player (I do a one man band show and need backing tracks) and needed a backup MP3 player in case the Samsung should fail.  After searching in the $100.00 or so price range I decided to take a chance with the I9220.  For the price of a decent dedicated MP3 player I like the extra goodies that comes with a smartphone.  I knew it wouldn't be a match for the Note 2, but since I really won't be using it as a phone I wasn't interested in it's 3G and 4G limitations.All I can say is that I'm impressed.  I loaded many of my Note 2 apps from the Google Play Store, which went without a hitch.  So far, no complaints on the headphone jack either, as others have commented on.  For people having a problem I suggest getting an iPhone adapter.  Early iPhones had recessed headphone jacks, and this phone likely requires such a jack.  I modified my jacks when I had an iPhone, so they work well with this phone.  Concerning sound quality out of the headphone jack, my preliminary tests show it has better sound than the Note 2.  I didn't expect that.  I need to do further testing, so don't hold me to this.  The onboard speaker lacks bass, but the volume is good enough.  The onboard camera is pretty bad, but I'm comparing it to the Note 2.Considering I paid over 5x's the price for the Note 2, I am very happy with this phone.  Time will tell if it will hold up, but for me it's just a backup device, so unless it goes bad while stored in a suitcase, it will likely last a very long time.BTW, whoever installed the screen protector did an excellent job.  Better than any I have ever installed.  I really didn't know it was on until I used a pair of strong reading glasses.UPDATE:  I just checked the \"about phone\" section on the phone and see that I got the GT-I9500.  No where does it mention the I9220.  Also, the baseband is MTK6515.  Android version is 4.2.2.  Whatever they call it, it's working great so far.  Lightahead was the seller, fullfilled through Amazon.For a good video describing this phone check: [...] or do a YouTube search for: N9000 DEMO1  My phone (black color) matches the phone shown with the on-off on the right side.  Also, mine didn't come with the \"comprehensive Android manual\" he mentions in the video.Update 10/30/13:  I took off one star for the viewing angle.  When viewing from the front of the camera, which is how I use it as an MP3 player, it's pretty bad.  My Samsung Note 2 kills in this respect, and you can see the difference in screen quality big time in this respect.  After extensive testing I can say for sure the audio chip in this phone is better than my in my \"real\" Note 2.  This has become my primary MP3 player, with the Note 2 being used as a backup.Sorry for not reviewing the phone call capabilities, and all I can say is it does work as a phone, since I tried it with my Note 2 sim card.  In all other respects it continues to work as a dependable device.  Maybe I just got lucky and got one of the \"good ones\".", "Date": "October 15, 2013"}, {"Title": "Missing External storage", "Author": "Olayinka Olubakin", "ReviewID": "R1T1K8P6MWN9U2", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Maybe the only issue is that am still waiting for you to send to me the missing external storage which did not come with the pack.", "Date": "October 14, 2013"}, {"Title": "n9000", "Author": "stanley", "ReviewID": "RYK0LWNA25C4F", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "I bought this phone because I needed some because my phone that I had just blacked out.

I give 0 stars for no customer support serviceProblem I had when open up the box and install my Family Mobile/Walmart card. The phone booted up fast most things was set for china, But it was not hard to change to US eastern Time Zone.I had to call my provider 3 times about network issues I wanted to make sure it wasnt my service that was causing slow downloads and network errors, first they reset my signal, that seem to help for 1 or 2 downloads lol oh and Google Play store/Market Place would hardly ever load, Second call they had me set the APN, well ok that seem to work for a hot second. Next call they put a 73 hr work order in to check my network in the area. Well after spending 4.5 days on network issues the phone went dead before the 73 hr work order, Oh I forgot mention poor space on the phone I added 3 games 1 took an hr to dl I walk away came back it was still downloading. When I got this phone I had a 2g storage card I used in this phone i moved everything that was movable to my card, still had low storage issues so 10/7/13 I brought a 8g and this phone was still telling me low on space (SMFH)You will not be able to customize your themes/wall paper,icons, etc.. there's not enough space for that, Soon as I dl something I would have to move it to my card to free up space, Trust I freed up as much as I could it was a pain in the \"%\" when that low storage space popups. I tried to make contact with B&G; International, Not for a refund @ this point but tech support, I really did not want to give up on this phone. All I got was amazon CSR advising me to place a return ticket because they do not offer support or exchanges for another phone ( only refunds),But I was holding out to see if it was a network problem. I return this phone this morning 10/9/2013 I was pretty much fed up after the phone frozed up last night I waiting 10 mins for it to unfreeze I had no other choice but to powered it off by removing the battery, I waited 2 mins and put the battery in it would not turn on(BTW) the phone frozen up a few times before this.

On another note  the internet speed was slow, which wasn't a big deal for me because I don't really hang on the web like that anyway. The deal breaker for me was after a week of using this phone problem free, the phone began to act up, for example a small headset icon appeared at the top of the home screen and since then I could only talk to people on speaker phone. I tried everything I could to fix the problem including resetting the phone twice, but to no avail. Till this day the icon is still there. On top of that while talking to people via speaker phone the reception would fade in and out and people would complain of hearing static sometimes. This issue has become so frustrating for me that I am now using an older model phone that I had previously owned. I recently purchased the knock off version of the galaxy S4 in which I am awaiting to arrive in the mail, hopefully it will not have the same flaws as this phone.

I do not use a data plan on my carrier so I can't really review the data capabilities and speed, but the wifi is pretty quick.  With quite a bit of usage, bluetooth, wifi, and data not on, i have to charge it maybe once every two to three days.  I've dropped it twice, one being particularly bad, with only damage to the screen protector.  I've yet to find a case that fits on it, but i haven't really been looking. The camera on the back is fair, the flash is useless, and the front camera is also fair. The box came with a flip case, a hard case, the charger, and two batteries. I haven't really had any problems with call quality, though when looking at videos without earbuds the speaker volume may seem low.

My advice, to anyone interested in buying this, after market, phone, chose a seller that use Amazon as his/her shipper and not directly from the seller (which, most of them are in China and outside of the US).

Be careful about this when you buy itUp Date: Upon close inspection I have found that the phone came with a screen protector already installed.I have also noticed that the scratches are on the protector and not on the phone glass. Phew.. I am happy now. I shall be using the phone right away. I have switched my ATT IPhone SIM and a SIM from Airtel India into this phone and have been using it since last evening.

We are learning to live with it. 3 months into it.Cons:Shuts off without warning. This has been happening on a daily basis for my wife and perhaps once a week for me.We sync our contacts with Outlook. Microsoft always has to 'help' us out by putting parenthesis around the area code. This phone comes to a grinding halt when you try to send a Text message to a phone number that has a parenthesis in it! MAJOR PAIN. This is a pathetic drawback for a \"Smartphone\".Finding a Contact on the phone and dialing it is not so intuitive. My HTC was better. Again, for a \"Smartphone\" it is still in the dumb category.Gets a little over zealous in letting you know that there is no SIM card in Slot 2 etc. Gee... thanks!Have used it in 3 countries in 3 continents so far and working OK.I ended up getting 2 of these (1 for my wife and myself)I travel internationally a lot and live out of 2 countriesStrangely enough the first one I ordered, from the color of the model on the screen I thought I was ordering a Black unit and ended up receiving a White one. I had to send a note to the Seller on the 2nd one requesting a Black one. Received a very prompt response to this and the order was filled correctly. The phone was shipped from Hong Kong and took about 10 days to arrive in Michigan. They did beat the estimated Shipping time by a couple of weeks which I was grateful for.Comes with dual SIM. One says WCDMA and GSM, the other is just GSM. I assumed that I could use a CDMA service on the one. I was with T-Mobile in the US which had lousy to no coverage in the place where I live in Michigan. I wanted to get a Verizon (CDMA) SIM and port my number. I went over to the Verizon store and got the following response...Verizon - They first asked for the IMEI number of the phone. When I shared that, they said that Verizon does not support that IMEI # and therefore I could not have Verizon service. This came as a rude shock.Not to be outdone, I thought I would go over to Sprint and try my luck there.Sprint - I stopped at a Sprint store and asked for a SIM. I am not making this up. The lady at the Sprint store said that I must contact their Phone customer service to request an International SIM. I explained to the lady that I wanted a SIM to use domestically in the US. To this, her response was...'All our phones come with built in SIM's, we dont sell individual SIM's'Translation: \"Why cant you just sign a 2 year contract and buy a phone from us like everybody else?\"So............struck out big time with Verizon and Sprint - 2 major carriers in the USAWent to AT&T; and they sorted me out, no questions asked in 15 minutes. Walked out of the store with a working Phone and number ported.This so called SMART phone has a major flaw. If I have a number saved that has the format like (734)xxx xxxx and try to send a text message to it, the phone just gives up and cant cope. Cant send the text message. Take out the brackets and send it to 734xxx xxxx and it works fine! This is pathetic. Had to find this out the hard way. I really have better things to do with my time than go in and edit phone numbers to remove brackets in them.There is quite a bit of Chinese (web pages) in it that I had to go in and delete. Bit painful.The 3.5mm jack is dodgy at best. At first I tried a jack with a straight pin with questionable results. I then tried the 90 degree 3.5mm jack that comes with the phone and experienced slightly better results.Battery life is so-so. I guess if I use both SIMs at a time, this will go down further. With medium usage (1 hour or so per day) I have to charge it every evening.The choices of RingTones the phone comes with are quite mediocre. Thankfully there are a plethora of choices on the Android side to complement this.Getting the phone to recognize the SD card was a bit tricky. Switched the SD card from my old phone to this. However, had to transfer the data from the card and have this phone reformat the SD card before it would recognize it. Still have not figured out how to have most of the Apps install on the SD card so they dont take up the main memory.Have not tried the Bluetooth with a headset yet. The phone paired quickly with the Rental car that I had in Michigan and worked fine.Using it in India with AirTel, a local GSM provider and it works fine. The data plan works too without any glitches.The display is a bit difficult to see in bright sunlight outdoors.Cant really speak for Games and other stuff that are Processor intensive. Most I do is play Sudoku on it!Have not had an unexplainable freeze so far. It has been solid.But, for $200 compared to near $600 for a Samsung Galaxy Note, this is a steal.

I ordered the Bear Motion Premium Folio Case that is made for Samsung's Note II phone. It fits perfectly and comes in several different colors. The only drawback are the holes that cover the camera lens. I do not know why there is even an opening because it's not like you are going to be taking pictures while the phone is in the case.I already had Tmobile under an expired contract and cancelled & put my old sim card into this phone. I now use Tmobile's noncontract service. If you don't have a sim card, you will need to get one depending on what carrier you are going to use. The phone has 2 mobile networks:  AT&T; 2G and 3G network but only 2G network for Tmobile.  If I am near a Wi-Fi spot it can go up to 4G. Straight Talk offers a AT&T; and Tmobile sim cards.I have recommended this phone to my coworkers and family for those wanting to not be tied to a particular carrier. The writing in the manual that comes with the phone is very tiny. You will need to download several apps to give you the convenience you normally get when under a contract. You will also need to download a volume control app to be able to manipulate speaker volume. The phone came with a screen protector that is not the best so you will need to eventually upgrade.Enjoy the freedom of managing which carrier you want to choose.

That has happened once.The screen scratches very easily (I think it might be hard plastic) so I bought a packet of screen guards big enough to fit it, and cut one to accomodate the mic, front cam, etc. Touch sensitivity so far is usually good.The battery does take quite long to charge, I think, and can drain quickly with a lot of use.I haven't felt need yet for extra memory card, but that might be a good idea if I get more into apps and take more photos/videos.I was delighted to find that I could take credit card payments with this using the Square Register, but because the earphone jack recess is a bit oddly configured, you have to cut a bit of plastic off one of the sides of the Square Register's plug in order to fit it fully into the jack. Wasn't hard to do and worked fine after that.I live in urban area and instead of getting an expensive data service, I just transfered my T-mobile cell phone SIM to this phone (worked immediately in both SIM slots) and got a Freedompop photon modem for private wifi.

As the time went on though the glitches have been lasting longer and happening more frequently. I now cannot even use the phone hardly because the screen just glitches and freezes. I cannot even turn it off when this happens. I have to remove my battery and turn it back on and not even that works anymore. Now when i remove the battery and turn it back on the screen is just white, and stays that way. I have to repeat the process several times before it will even turn on properly and when it does power on again i have about 2-3 minutes before it glitches again. I am VERY unsatisfied with this phone. I spent $190.97 on this phone and expect to have a phone that is nice and works properly for that price. This is completely outrageous!

It is about 50% of what a Note actually is, but at 20% of the price, so for what you actually get, it is worth the money, maybe. That maybe is very dependent on the price at the moment. I purchased for 114.00 with 2 day Prime shipping. At the price of nearly 150.00, not such a great deal.I had this phone for 4 days, and on the fifth day, the screen shattered. I had the protective case on the phone, and the phone was in my back pocket. When I bent down to grab something, the phone must have gotten pressure from the bending motion, and actually shattered the screen. So with that being said here is what I encountered during my 4-5 days with the phone.Before I get into the actual review, please take notice that there are atleast 3 different versions of this phone, and you may get 1 that does not have the same functions, button layout, reception options, or qwerks. For example the one I got from Lightahead could not get 3G speed, the volume buttons and power buttons were in a different spot, and every button including volume keys would turn the screen on. But the headphone jack worked with every earphone I tried, so that was a plus.Dimensions - Big, almost too big. It is about the same size a Note 1, and smaller than a Note 2. The big question is: Do you really want to carry a small tablet around for a phone. I thought it would be fine, but in actuality, I realized it was too big for me. You will find NO case to fit this phone, except for the few book style case, but I dont consider them cases, because all the do is replace the back panel, with one that has a cover. The phone comes with one of these already. As far as a rubber or hard case...you are out of luck. Either the camera will not line up, the buttons will not line up, or the case will be too tight or too loose.Performance - Has a quite a bit of lag. The screen would freeze up quite a bit. Even with all available settings turned on for performance, it was still sort of slow. Not a huge pain. Sort of like comparing DSL to Cable internet. Usable, and livable...but definitely noticeable. It has a hard time backing out of a program quickly. Even on 30MB per Sec WIFI, it was still very slow at downloading. And installing large programs can be time consuming. The internal memory is TINY. It is not a 8GB rom...that is the size of the memory card they send you. Internal memory after the standard programs that come with the phone are installed, is around 150 MB free space left. Get a 16 GB SD card and install everything to it. I believe that if you download a lot of apps, that it may run into memory issues for the shortcuts to those apps. It even had a hard time keeping the date and time correct. It  would take a few seconds for the right date and time to appear.Camera - Terrible. 3MP tops for the back. The front...worse, but I never use front, so no big deal. The back camera has a very hard time focusing. The flash---well that is only there for novelty, because it gives off NO light. The camcorder is not terribly bad. If you make any sudden movements or the object you are filming does, it will pixelate bad.Screen - Comparing to my Girlfriends S3...not too bad. It is not as smooth, and you can see pixels more, but you can live with it. The actual touch function is good. I noticed no deadspots on screen, or any defects using swipe or slide, except on unlock, but I think that had to do with performance, not screen. The colors are good, but not great. From my experience, the screen is flimsy, and after I cracked it, I took the screen out, and it was very thin in comparison to other phone screens I have installed and taken off.Reception - Decent...but not anything to brag about. BEWARE...if you get the one from Lightahead,  be prepared for 2G speed. NO 3G, even with ATT&T.; Read the fine print, and you will see. So if you want to stream video, or listen to Pandora...you may be out of luck. This was the biggest draw back for me. There may be a way to root the phone to get 3g, but I do not know. Also standing directly beside my WIFI router I still did not get full bars.Quality - One word...CRAP. This phone has many glitches, such as no matter what I tried with settings, I kept getting Chinese Google to appear as my home page. Every key turned the screen on. The phones time and date would change to wrong time and date or take forever to upload. Screen durability is terrible. Home button feels cheap, and almost loose.In closing, I would recommend to someone who is coming from a standard non android phone to an android phone to try this phone. They would be impressed. But if you have owned anything from an HTC Hero or Motorola Droid or beyond. Do not get this phone. You will be disappointed. Maybe not at first, but eventually you will miss a quality Android device.", "Date": "October 13, 2013"}, {"Title": "Risk", "Author": "kimberly lewis", "ReviewID": "RCETE0CQPRLHY", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "The phone looks great!...but mine was defective.

I have a laptop that I am capable of running efficiently and this is my fourth smart phone. That being said, I received this product today and am very happy with it.I would like to address some of the negative reviews here. First, it DOES NOT come with a sim card. It tells you in the description that it DOES NOT come with a sim card. I have seen a few negative reviews that state only that they didn't get a sim card. (I don't appreciate ignorant reviews). This is NOT A SAMSUMG PRODUCT. Don't expect it to behave or have everything a Note 3 has. It is a knock off.Now that I'm done with that I will tell you everything I enjoy about this product so far.1) The screen is large and very clear. The picture is great. I use my phone for social media, email and a few games. I love that Instagram is crystal clear and the picture quality is just amazing. The same goes for Facebook. I have played a few games on it such as Temple Run 2 and the sound and picture are again very good.2) It accepted my SIM card from my old Straight Talk phone without any problems. I have seen some negative reviews about the compatibility with Straight Talk and this phone. I had no problems. One slight hitch was sending picture messages and my data. THIS IS AN EASY FIX! I simply copied my APN information word for word from my old phone before removing the SIM card and then  copied it into the new phone's APN settings. Everything worked fine after that.3) The internet speed is great with my regular data plan and with my wi-fi. I will say that my wi-fi is slightly faster but either way works great.4) The headphone jacks have not been any problem for me. Again, I wonder if everyone gets the same phone because this was another complaint that I read about in reviews but I have not encountered it with my phone. When I received the phone it did come with headphones (as it says in the description) and I took those headphones and compared the jack to everything else I had used with my old phone i.e. my aux cables, my other headphones and my wireless speaker cable. They were all the same. So, I tried them all out with this phone and surprise, surprise, they all worked just fine.5)The sound from the phones speaker is great. It's loud and clear and wonderful. I play a lot of music all day long. I really like that the sound is such good quality. Regardless of whether you use the headphones, the external speaker or a wireless rechargeable speaker the sound rocks.6) Phone calls and texting...what can you really say about this. I can receive and send calls and texts. No one has said that they have trouble hearing me and I can hear others fine. I do like Go SMS Pro and had already set it as my default so I cannot speak for the messaging system that came with the phone. I would think that if a downloaded version has no problems than the original would be just as good.Before I go into the just satisfactory aspects of the phone I will tell you why I gave it five stars if not every single little thing was great. The price of this phone (I ordered the black one which was $116 plus some change after taxes and whatnot) is very cheap for what you get. Those of you who have used Straight Talk know what I mean. The Straight Talk versions are overpriced and honestly just crap for what you pay for them. This phone was a fraction of what a Samsung S3 would have cost me through Straight Talk and it is much bigger and better. So, when I compare the cost to what I love about it and what is so so I give it five stars.So on with the so so aspects of the phone....The Camera...it's not the best. Personally I do take a lot of pictures and was not thrilled with the camera. I have discovered that if I use light to my advantage and really focus on my picture taking I am not at all disappointed. To me, this is an opportunity to become a more skilled photographer. If it is truly an issue, I suggest getting an actual digital camera which will always do better than any cell phone out there.The Memory..ok this was a little disappointing as well. I knew what to expect tho. The total internal memory is around 8 GB which isn't the greatest. I am upgrading to a much larger SD card because of this (I have just a 4 GB card and really have been needing to upgrade for awhile). As cheap as SD cards are now I don't really look at this as something to strike a star for. Again, I'm no technological whiz so if you are and you need more memory and an SD card just won't do...well..this isn't the phone for you.  Those of you who just like to take pictures, read news feeds on social media, download apps,  and play games, you should have no problems with this phone.The Flip Cover...ok yeah, it's pretty cheap looking. I will be ordering a wallet style cover and I will update my review to let people know if any fit correctly. (been down this road with every single Straight Talk phone I have ordered)Overall, I love this phone. I think that I covered all the important stuff. I will update this review as I go and let any potential buyer know if there are any problems.Oh and I received this phone on the day I was told I would get it.

Now on to the good part, both batteries came with 1/2 a charge,  so I put the phone on the charger, and filled one of them up, then switched to the other. the 1/2 charged  battery lasted all day, so when I got home I switch them, to my surprise the fill charged battery was dead, I tried all night to charge both and they would not charge.

Now all that shows on the screen is a bunch of squiggly lines and bounces.  Wasnt dropped or anything.  Phone is only two months old.  DONT BUY!!!!!! I received my phone today on November 16th and ordered on November 1st so was very fast on shipping considering expected delivery was Nov 29-Dec 17. Phone is working awesome. The only thing I have found so far that isn't as great as my last phone is the gps will not work but I may not have the settings exactly right. My messaging works fine, receive and send pics just fine. Had to change the APN settings to work with my ATT sim card from Straight Talk. Worked in sim slot 2 right off the bat after changing the settings. It does lack in internal memory but with a large gb sd card, most apps can be saved to that. My 16gb sd card would not work in this phone so I had to use the 8gb that it came with. Internet is fast on wifi and I get H+ data connection without wifi. Had to change the settings from china to US, but most tech savvy people will have no problem with this. I thought I was getting a white one but received black but I wasn't specific so that was no big deal. I did notice the jack for the ear buds is longer than the standard ear buds and I'm not sure where you would find an adapter for it. The screen when outside in the sun is not very visible. Beautiful phone. I ordered from vivimall.Update: got the gps working just fine. Just need to adjust settings to accept default, sms, mms, and wap on sim card. It does take forever to charge but didn't seem to drain fast. My son had it with him all day at school and still showed full when he got home and he said he had used it alot that day. It is a pretty good phone but I'm going back to my S2. Due to the low internal memory, alot of apps that I use can't be saved to the sd card or they won't work right and even when saved on the phone, they lag i.e Candy Crush, Jurassic Park Builder. It would appear they move in slow motion. I gave this phone to my 16 year old and he is in love but he only needs a phone for Facebook, Google, email, texting, and talk and this phone is great for all that with the large screen and OS. Straight Talk just came out with the Samsung Galaxy S3 for $399 which is alot more than what this phone costs, but I know what Samsung products are like and can trust them and know I won't have to worry about all the other issues.

I was surprise to receive it in a \"Samsung Note 2\" box, complete with a small piece of document printed in 5 languages. The familiar bold Samsung logo is displayed on the back plate. It looks gorgeous, the screen is bright and feels like the real thing - but that's where the similarity ends. I put in the battery and it quickly charged \"full\", a bad sign of short battery life which later proven to be true. (I left it charged overnight anyway.) I thought I might have better luck with the second battery. (It came with two batteries.) It was later proven not much better than the first one. After merely 4 hours of standing by, the juice ran out. Unbelievable.If the poor battery life is not enough, I quickly find out the phone doesn't even perform its basic functions, that is, to make and receive phone calls. I'm a veteran Android user and have several Android devices so I have no problem to give it a good test with my T-Mobile SIM card in place. The wifi part works fine, however, its handling of the cellular signal is incredibly poor. I only managed to get perhaps one of ten calls through. The number of signal bar fluctuate between 0 and 2. (Most of the time it stays at 0.) We live in a densely populated residential area, where practically tens of cell phones are being used all the time, so it can't be the phone company. (My other Android phone works perfectly and consistently shows 3 or more bars.) I conclude the phone is defective and I have to return it (to Hong Kong).With the Samsung name plate, the legality of this phone is highly questionable. I guess it meant to be a knock off of Samsung Note 2. The manufacturer (whose name is unknown)did a good job on superficial features, but alas, it doesn't perform the basic function of a cell phone.

First I love the phone camera is good not 8mp but still good. Second it's unlocked all I did was put in my tmobile SIM card and it detected it right away. I didn't even have to mess with Apn settings or anything. I did have to put it into Airplane mode and then back to regular mode to get signal. Third no need to Root to get cracked apps just turn on allow from unknown sources and ready to go. I use Blackmart kinda like Installous if your familiar with cracked iPhone apps. Fourth thing is the screen is very responsive better then other phones I've had from Samsung, hupai and LG. the colors are vibrant I expected less since some reviews said colors were dull. Could be why it seems good had low expectations. For the bad the battery seems to die pretty quickly if running games or videos you can literally watch the percentage meter drop. Holds good charge using phone and in standby mode all day. The wifi blows can't be more then 10ft or I loose signal not a big deal since the 3G is pretty decent. I have the unlimited web from tmobile so it switches over when I loose signal from my wifi.The seller Lolbuy has great customer service. Emailed them to make sure it came with what was pictured and they replied quickly and said it came with 2 batteries, 2 cases, and a mini stylus. I also had an issue when making phone calls screen would go black and phone would lock up had to pull the battery out. Again emailed and they replied quickly with the solution. Apparently it was the proximity sensor ( like when you put the phone to our ear it detects that and shuts off display) I needed to reset by going to setting and calibrating the al_ps sensor. Now works great. The phone got to me here in California in a week amazing since anything from China usually takes like a month. Highly recommend buying from Lolbuy since other sellers seem to be getting bad reviews. Looks like they are restocking I plan on getting another one when they do.***Update after a month of heavy using I'm sad to say I switched to a actual Note due to the phone not supporting tmobiles 1700 radio band. I was only getting Edge network. Slow slow Internet so for anyone who buys this phone and Internet speed is important I recommend you use AT&T; or a AT&T; compatible company like straight talk. Make sure it is compatible with the 1900 band so you can get 3G. I do hear tmobile is starting to support the 3G in some markets.

I use the no data \u201cpay as you go\u201d plan, and purchase a $100 card annually.  I don\u2019t have the need for a phone growing out of my ear and only use it periodically and always have minutes left over at the end of a year.  This amounts to $8/month for phone service.  Can\u2019t beat the deal.  My old tiny smart phone was too small for my hand.  I was always inadvertently pressing the volume or power button.  When I used the WiFi, I needed a microscope to see URLs or, various stories/videos.  Texting was a chore.We purchased a tablet last year and I was hooked on the convenience of WiFi and ease of use of the device.  My wife decided she liked it also, sooo, I was out in left field.  I decided to buy a larger smart phone or a phablet.  The Galaxy Note was the perfect solution.  The Note was around $520 and the Note 2 was $670.  No way would I pay that kind of money for a phone, while I paid $8/month for the service.I looked around on Amazon and saw this Note \u201cknockoff\u201d for $176.  The Star N9000.  I thought; \u201cHow could they make a device that compares to the Galaxy for under $200?\u201d  I looked at other large phones but always came back to the N9000.  I decided to buy one.I ordered with \u201cKeydroper\u201d from Hong Kong via Amazon on January 18, 2013.  After I ordered, I emailed Keydroper and requested a black phone.  Keydroper emailed back and said he would ship black.  To my amazement, on January 28 the phone arrived from Hong Kong to New Jersey in 10 days.  Yes black.  The phone was packed to perfection.  The carton was wrapped in bubble wrap in a tight cardboard box which was taped with, it seems, yards and yards of tape.The phone comes with an instruction manual which is basically useless.  The print is too small to read and it doesn\u2019t say anything anyway.  I placed my old T-Mobile SIM card in the GSM slot, put in the battery and made a call.  Works great.  I charged up both batteries and began loading the phone with my favorite Apps.  The phone is big compared to my old phone but it took my 2 seconds to get used to it.  The large size is a plus.  Easier to text, easier to see, and it is not difficult to hold.  I have a size 10 hand, so maybe someone with a smaller hand may have a problem?  My wife, who is small, said the phone seems hard to hold for her.  But she keeps looking at it my phone and I hope I don\u2019t lose the phone to her.The speaker is adequate, but sounds a bit tinny.  The volume is fine.  The 5MP rear camera is decent if there is ample light.  The LED flash is a bust.  The video camera is decent in ample light.  Don\u2019t expect to be Ansell Adams.My old phone ran on Honeycomb, my (her) tablet runs on Gingerbread and this new phone is Ice Cream Sandwich, so it\u2019s an improvement.For $176, I don\u2019t expect a well built sturdy phone, even though this phone does not appear to be flimsy.  In fact, it seems solid.  I read various forums and I understand that the screen is tempered glass, not gorilla glass.  I would be afraid to drop the phone for fear of it disintegrating.  Maybe I\u2019m wrong, but don\u2019t want to find out.  It seems that the phone came with a screen protector on it, so this is a plus.I only had the phone for three days and already, I felt I like I make a wise choice.  $176 for a large phone and $100 for a one year service plan.  Seems like a deal to me.After I use the phone for a while, I may make an update.Pros \u2013 Size, decent resolution, price.Cons \u2013 So-so camera.

It took a little doing to get into the package- the box is wrapped in bubble wrap, tucked inside a soft cardboard package, then competely covered in clear tape to water-proof it.  It came with a mini-stylis with a soft, foamy-feeling end, two batteries, a flip case, a clear back cover, and a USB cord and plug-in.  The owner's manual is very basic, so if you aren't familiar with Android OS it will take a little playing with the phone to figure things out.  I got a regular sized SIM card, Straight Talk AT&T;, and slid it into the first slot after a little manipulation (my first time with using a SIM.)  I had read the reviews here, so I had looked and Straight Talk has the APN information online.  I had my phone up and working after about 10 minutes, including waiting for my service to switch from my old phone to my new phone.

I do have ATK installed to help out with that, as I did on my DroidX (I loved that phone and would probably still have it had it not met with an unfortunate accident with a car tire... killed the phone but also prompted my leaving Verizon and the ridiculous phone bills.)  It was a little sluggish at first, but it has sped up noticably.  The camera is decent for a phone, especially if you turn the HDR on for the back camera, and the front camera is ok- a new feature for me to play with.  I'm still playing around with the phone, getting used to things, so if I have anything to add later I will do so.  I did try out my Skull Candy ear buds, just to see if they would work, and they did, sound great.  I had also ordered a retractable phone charger and hard case for the Samsung Note- they do not work, fyi.  The case is a little too large, and the button cutouts are in the wrong places, but I had to try.  Overall, it's a great phone that has my co-workers jealous and considering leaving their contracts.", "Date": "January 27, 2013"}, {"Title": "great but....", "Author": "Kaelib LeBreton", "ReviewID": "R1T0K3I42R2BB2", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "The phone was wonderful its bi beautiful strikes up an interestin con vo between friends and strangers but one day when i weant to the park i set the phone done with the case on and in 10-25min i pick it up its hot i try to turn it on it wont turn on i email the seller he doesnt get back to me almost to weeks saying something about a warranty that i had no idea exsisisted my thoughts are dont bye the phone plenty and trusted ones out there on amazon dont get a chinese phone et nd unlocked lg samsung motorola ect!", "Date": "January 27, 2013"}, {"Title": "pretty awesome", "Author": "amazonian \"\u2665amazonian\"", "ReviewID": "R1RJ0I9KPVUFMX", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I purchased from keydroper on Friday, January 11th. it shipped on the 15th and I received it on the 28th. wayyyyy before the estimated dates of Feb 7th -26th. that, alone, made me pretty happy.

I would use them again. I was leary about using a seller out of china. However, prior to playing my order I sent them a msg about the color, to which they responded promptly and in clear, understandable language.With that out of the way. I received the phone, two batteries, charger, semi hard case, and instruction booklet.  I was expecting the screen to be slow to respond to touch and not to be able to scroll up/down quickly. I was surprised to see that neither was true. There are moments when both are true, but far less than I thought there would be. I phone does take getting used to because the size. After only an hour or two of playing with the phone my old phone felt tiny and weird. You should not buy this phone expecting it to be a Galaxy Note. You should expect the size and Android operating system at 1/3 the price. I was a disappointed that I didn't get the back-case\\cover that others have received. I ordered http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B006YJCPU4/ref=cm_cr_ryp_prd_ttl_sol_2 at the same time. Even though that is shipping from the US, I have not received it yet.  Overall I am pleased so far with day 1. My apps are loading and running fine so far. I will update this review and add the pics I took when I received the phone at some later point in time. Going to enjoy my phone now.Day 2-3I'm noticing the phone has slowed down a little since i've begun installing software on the machine. The touchscreen is a bit slow responding, but overall still pleased considering the cost.1 week laterAt this point I have loaded all of my apps onto my phone that I had on my previous phone. Doing I have noticed a tremendous lag in response time when i am launching apps and going thru normal phone functions. I restored the phone to factory defaults and tried it again, same results. I then reset the phone a 2nd time and just used it like a phone, no apps. worked like a charm. As soon as I popped my sim card in I was able to make/receive calls no problem. The phone did want me to specify which sim I want to send text msgs from which I thought was weird since I only used one of the two sim slots. My pics on my sd card didn't all show up on my phone even thou I unmounted it from my previous phone. The is no way to unmount on this phone. The camera SUCKS BIG, GIANT COW BALLS, no way this thing is 8 mega pixels. My galaxy blaze (lower end of the galaxy line) took better pics, by far, and the pics on the blaze leave something to be desired.***If you only want a phone with a big surface area to make reading and web surfing easier, then this phone is fine. otherwise stay away this is a complete waste of time.

Both \"Android 4.0\" and \"8 GB\" parts are incorrect.The description on the page says: \"1GHZ, 2GB ,512 RAM\". Clearly 2 GB is not 8 GB, and is more realistic for $149, but this is also incorrect.The box which arrived to me today was a sticker with the \"8 GB ROM\" clearly visible: [...]Here's what the phone shows after a factory reset: [...] 146 MB.This is what is left of 200 MB (as reported by various system information apps) when built-in applications like Google Play or the browser are accounted for.The device also boldly reports \"Android 4.2.1\" as firmware version. A person that never saw Android 4.x might be fooled by this. In reality it is something like Android 2.3, not even completely re-colored to match the 4.x color scheme. Obvious features of Android 4 are absent: in the notification area, in the camera app, on the settings screen, etc.This pittance of a storage is a show-stopper for me. Alas, even if you install every application to the memory card, some phone storage is used anyway. My current phone has 500 MB of storage and I barely manage to keep a few large applications, fewer than I would like.Why has the manufacturers saved around $5 on a chip of at least 2MB capacity? Is the seller outright lying or just clueless? Who knows. I'm going to return this phone.Which is a shame, because otherwise it's a rather nice phone.It has a nice, clear screen, a fast processor (everything is butter-smooth), it is well-built, lies comfortably in hand, and has a nice optional face cover combined with a back cover.This phone may be adequate for someone who only installs a handful of simple apps, not heavyweights like Chrome or the Facebook app or Google Hangouts (for video chat).

This looked like my solution. So I dove in. I receive the phone faster than I thought which was the only positive thing about this order but i did pay for faster shipping. The day of the birthday the gift was opened. It was very impressive looking. Looked similar to the Galaxy Note 2. It came with two batteries, a charger, a memory chip for the phone, head phones, ect basically everything that it said was gone come with it. Which gave the impression I paid way more. After turning on the phone and playing on it I started to notice a few problem.Apps that came with the phone crash. I tried to install a few things like facebook and candy crush and they both would go to the load screen and crash as well. Facebook would only run after like 8 attempts. I figured the phone just needed to be rested and so i tried that. Nothing changed expect the fact that I couldnt get facebook to run at all now.The batteries after being charged fully would only give me 3-4 hours of usage out of them at mid power on the phone and not at constant use either.Compatability with service providers sucked. I tried family mobile (tmobile generic brand), tmobile, and at&t.; I would only get the G network and barely any signal.Internet wifi and without- Ok without wifi the internet was so slow that it would literally take minutes to load a single webpage. With wifi I was lucky with 10 second load times. It average at 10-15 seconds and my wifi supports speeds up to 24mbps.I tried going to trya few places to get service and I was told that with it being a foreign phone they couldn't help me. I took this time to write this review so others wouldn't have the same experience and waste they time and money. The phone looks cool but is essentially worthless.
