Remington", "ReviewID": "R3OEPAJ1888AR8", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "The Samsung S4 cell phone is the hottest and newest phone on the smart phone market.  This Android device has gotten much press and rightly so.  In terms of specifications, the S4 has a lot going for it that has it as the leader of the pack over many smart phones.  But at first glance, this new phone looks and feels much like its predecessor, the Galaxy S3.  So what makes this phone different and why should you be interested in purchasing it?  This review will explore those issues and help answer that question.When you have a good thing going, why not start with that as your baseline.  Samsung has done just that with the S4.  The S3 and the S4 are very similar on many levels and very different in key areas.  Their size is essentially the same at 5.38\" x 2.75\" x .31\".  This actually makes the S4 .7mm thinner than the S3.  Its weight is 4.6 ounces, .7 ounces lighter than the S3.  Comparing the two, Samsung has increased the size of the screen to a 5\" display that offers full HD resolution at 1920 x 1080 pixels.  While other phones offer similar resolutions, none have the same quality image that comes from the Super AMOLED screen offered on the S4.  Side-by-side comparisons with phones such as the HTC One find the S4 shines with more prominent resolution and richer color tones.The screen also has improved capacitance over the S3 and previous Samsung offerings.  This improved capacitance supports phone use while gloves are worn.  Those who live in cold climates or those who are fashion conscious and wear gloves will find this enhanced capability helpful.  While this capability is a nice addition, it takes some getting used to.  Because it is more sensitive, it's easy to falsely register a finger press if you hover your hand over the screen in the just the right way.  Hopefully Samsung can correct this performance flaw with future software upgrades.Regardless, the S4 screen is a remarkable technological creation.  Its visual performance makes it like a smaller cousin of much larger HD televisions.  It is a beautiful piece of work and the highest quality screen of its size presently on the market.At first glance, the camera appears to also be the same as the S3.  This is, in fact, not the case.  The S4 houses a whopping 13-megapixel, rear-facing camera and a 2-megapixel, front facing camera.  The rear-facing, 13-megapixel camera image is excellent.  The imaging capabilities of both cameras extend past the raw hardware with added features built into their associated software.  There is software to do most anything you can think of with the images taken.  Software even uses both the front and back camera to offer all kinds of imaging effects from panoramic images to slow motion videos.Much of the new hardware, software, and extended features built into the S4 place heavy processing demands on the phone's engine.  Because of this, Samsung has integrated a 1.9GHz quad-core Qualcomm Snapdragon 600 processor to help keep things purring along smoothly.  At the time of this review, this makes the S4 one of the fastest smartphones on the market.Coupled with this increased processing power is an expanded memory card slot for additional storage.  Samsung is selling the S4 in 16GB, 32GB, and 64GB configurations.  For those considering the S4 with 16GB of storage, this may be a bit limiting.  Approximately 6GB is eaten up by the OS and installed apps, which leaves a scant 8-9GB of storage.  This is 2GB less storage than the S3.  The S4 supports the installation of up to an additional 64GB using a Micro SD card.  If you're considering purchasing this phone, you might want to add a Micro SD card to your purchase and expand the base memory, or purchase an S4 with a higher amount of integrated storage.Keep in mind that the more data you add to your Micro SD card, the more information the S4 has to parse.  If you have a 64GB SD card packed with pictures and videos, when you open the Gallery to view them, even the quad-core processor will crank itself silly to host them for you; it will take time for them to display.  There's no working around this.  It's the nature of the beast.  Just accept this as a current limitation based on processor speed and storage mass.The front of the phone contains a number of additional sensors that monitor eye movement and proximity so the phone knows how far it is from your ear.  An infra red blaster is integrated into the top of the phone to enable it to act as a remote, with the appropriate app installed to function as a remote.  These sensors and the infra red blaster offer many new features not available with the S3.  The phone can act as a remote control for your television, CD/DVD player, A/V receiver, and even home appliances that support remote control.  The eye sensor offers additional features that control screen dimming and auto pausing when you look away from the screen.  Likewise, when you look at the screen, dimming and auto pausing resume their normal operation.Applications available to support the additional sensors include Air View, Air Gesture, and Smart Scroll.  While these features are futuristic and helpful in theory, they aren't flawless in practice.  They are also rather complex to learn and use, which detracts from the concept of simplicity when it comes to operating the device.  Take this into consideration when adopting the phone for your use.  Not all the features have to be used at once.  You may find some features helpful while others are an annoyance.  They are all highly configurable and it will take some time and practice to set them up to your liking.Like the S3, the S4 supports Samsung's S Beam and near field communication (NFC).  S Beam allows two Samsung phones to be placed back-to-back so they can share multimedia content such as videos, music, pictures, etc.  The devices only need to be placed a few centimeters from each other to link, and, unlike Bluetooth, no pairing is needed.  Communication is provided by WiFi Direct, which makes transfer speeds quite good.Samsung has received many user complaints over the quantity of polyurethane used with their phones.  They are plastic centric in construction and many consumers feel this detracts from a robust, solid feel.  The S4 seems to have taken this into consideration with the addition of a flat metal bezel around the side edge of the phone.  Much like the iPhone, the S4 has a metallic edge that augments its former plasticized edge construction.The case itself is similar to the S3.  The rear cover is easily removed to reveal the battery, SIMM card, and Micro SD card.As for battery life, the S4 stock battery is 2,600mAh compared to the 2,100mAh S3 battery.  This is a 20% increase in battery size with no added thickness to the phone's form factor.  In fact--as stated earlier--the S4 is .7mm thinner than the S3.  This added battery storage is required due to the increased screen size and additional features and applications.  Each person's use is highly personalized, so it's difficult to gauge how this battery will perform with your personal use, but, in general, it seems to be an adequate amount of power storage for moderate use.  Still, it will more than likely require daily charging.  If this is a concern to you, you might consider an extended-life battery.  These batteries are freely sold on Amazon and other locations, but most of them require an aftermarket back to the case that will replace your stock rear cover.  Extended batteries mean heftier weight and added thickness to the phone.  Another option is to purchase an additional battery as a backup for when your primary battery discharges.Out of the box, the S4 comes equipped with Android Jelly Bean 4.2.2 and a huge amount of software.  If there's one complaint about this phone it is in relation to the amount of features and software bundled with it.  The S4 has a mountain of software that, at first glance, can be absolutely overwhelming.  It will take time to sort out and learn everything this phone can do, so pencil in an evening or two to explore, configure, and learn what's new and how to use it.  The list is far too extensive to cover in this review, but it should be stated that every feature the phone has is supported by associated software.  In addition to this software, Samsung has packed new applications to satisfy every possible type of user.  You may find it all useful, but this is doubtful.  Most likely, you'll use a subsection of all the software installed and make it your own.  One could say Samsung has given the consumer the benefit of choice by adding so many features and so much software.  Sometimes it's better to have too much than not enough, and this is true here.  Rather than be overwhelmed by it, see it as a library of possibilities that supports a healthy amount of functions.  Decide which functions are useful to you and learn them.  For those functions and applications that hold little interest, leave them alone for now.The S4 is an enhanced deconstruction and reconstruction of the S3.  If you currently own the S3 and are considering an upgrade, take stock in the added features and capabilities of the S4.  The S4 will give you the latest Android has to offer; a larger amount of storage space; a fabulous HD screen; a high-quality, 13-megapixel camera; huge amounts of added features and software; and a fantastic processor under the hood.  If these things are important to you, then the S4 may be an exciting upgrade.  If you're happy with the features and performance of your current S3, then you may want to save your money and stay with what you have.Overall, the S4 is a brilliant device.  It's not without its flaws and there is always room for improvement.  While Apple performed wonders defining the modern smartphone, Samsung has helped take the concept one step further.  If you're looking to upgrade your older smartphone and break into the Samsung Galaxy world for the first time, the S4 is a fantastic selection.  It is, arguably, the best Android phone on the market, at present.  Some may say it's the best smartphone, period.  Each person's decision and opinion is highly individualistic.  One thing is for sure, Samsung has pulled out all the stops to ensure consumers get the most for their money, and they have set the bar even higher for newcomers to take the mantle of achievement to a new level.", "Date": "May 26, 2013"}, {"Title": "Great phone", "Author": "Trinilisa", "ReviewID": "RBPE0PVKKVXFF", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Firstly, I bought my phone - Samsung Galaxy S4 i9505 from Cell Trading, and I received it on time, and in perfect condition.I am in love with this phone, it's everything I wanted and much much more.

I don't understand why do I need to go thru 4 steps to make a phone call when I just called the person 2 phone calls ago. With my old htc phone i can just tap \"phone\" and the person's name and it will make the call but S4 I will have to tap phone/log/name/call. It might not bother some people but if you make more than 10 calls a day, it will drive you nuts.3. The built quality is actually not bad but it has no grip. I drop the phone at least twice a day.4. air gesture or air view don't work on most non Samsung apps. \"smart stay\" does work ... only sometimes.5. The phone runs very hot.  (I do admit I play candy crush too much)It is a good phone and it will impress your friends but when I pay $620 I have much higher expectations.Update:After another half month of using it from my last review, there are more problems I would really like Samsung to update/fix1. The phone is not able to detect your face. When you call those annoying automated system, you will have to use speaker or else your face will make the selection for you.  I don't believe it is a new or fancy feature.2. No dedicated camera button and it takes few steps and seconds to load the camera app. It is really hard to catch a lot of Kodak moment. The phone is very slim (which is great), but it is very hard to hold it with two fingers when you try to focus and take picture of the object. I really miss those old sony Cybershot camera phone.3. It might be just my phone. It seems it will at least take 3-5 second (sometimes longer) to dial out a call.4. I have noticed some lags on my Galaxy S4, especially when opening apps, swiping left/right / opening gallery. This really should not happen in a high end phone.5. The  touch screen is not responding properly. If you dont use right hand to tap on the apps on the right side, then most likely you will open some other apps on the left. It also occasionally turns the screen off, when i tap on the screen.6. The gallery crashes a lot. I sometimes have to force close the app and re-open it to use it.I really want to like this phone especially I paid so much for the phone and all the accessories. I wish I picked other phones back then, but it seems S4 was and still is the only the newer high end phone you can change battery and it is important to me because I don't want to carry a huge and slow charging portable charger (sorry no offense, but it really look ugly to put the phone with an attachment almost as big as your phone against your face . I am not sure if it is hardware's problems or software. I am not tech savvy enough to know how to flash to other ROM. I just hope it will work straight out of the box. The phone has a lot of potentials but it does not look like the firmware and those problems will be fixed anytime soon. If any one can please help me to address those issues, please let me know.

My review is going to be both about the Samsung Galaxy as a phone in general and also this phone in particular, what's good about it, and what's not.I decided to go for the Samsung Galaxy S4 after doing a side-by-side comparison in Best Buy last August/September. What really tipped me in the direction of the Galaxy was the display. iPhone hadn't changed theirs for years and the iOS 7 wasn't released by that time so the difference was quite stark. The larger display screen was another motivating factor.I was actually still under contract from AT&T; at the time(almost about to finish it now) and I didn't want to enter another one(absolutely hate those), so I decided that buying an international(unlocked) version would be the best way to go. Had contacted AT&T; asking them if this would be a problem as far as data is concerned. They gave the green signal and I decided to buy it from here for about $600 to $650.I'm not going to go too much in detail about it's good aspects since they are well documented and advertised. Overall, I'm going to have to say that the Galaxy S4 doesn't hold a candle to the iPhone when it comes to the design and usability of features. I like everyone else, use the phone a lot, so naturally, I'm going to be able to see each and every shortcoming in it.List of issues:1. Bad battery - A fully charged S4 discharges to nearly 0% in the space of about 12 hours normally. All this when I mostly have the phone on silent(at work) with a couple of listeners attached to it(email, gmail, twitter, the regular stuff really, nothing too fancy)2. Phone can heat up very easily. Well documented problem this one. One person's phone was said to have caught on fire. Mine almost felt like it was going to when I had left it to charge overnight and placed it under a pillow unknowingly. It got ridiculously hot and I was worried for a while. Also, if you're playing a game which uses a lot of processor power or you're just charging it, sometimes it gets hot. This to me is a stark example of poor design.3. Poor performance - I don't know what it is, I've disabled most of the old bloatware that came pre-installed with the phone..it still ends up acting very slow and spastic...and this creates a terrible experience when you're trying to use a smart phone. I play a fair bit of candy crush, but only about 40% of the time do I get an uninterrupted experience. It's kind of sad that a phone as modern as the S4 with lots of RAM can't seem to work smoothly. Again, an example of poor design at the core. Perhaps the folks with contract phones and lesser apps have it better.4. Most of those features that are heavily advertised by the S4 are in reality close to useless and don't even end up executing properly most of the time. Things like the phone-tilt scroll feature, air hover selection. It should be about getting the simple things right first.5. The data speed could be faster. No issues with wifi I guess and perhaps this is just an AT&T; issue. I haven't bothered enough to call them about it. I might be switching to T-mobile anyways.6. Calls going straight to voicemail sometimes. Again, this is probably and AT&T; and international phone equation problem(or I could be wrong).7. Phone with pre-installed bloatware. I'm not too happy about this one. I expected a fresh clean version for the phone.8. Phone is advertised as international unlocked version but the T-mobile music plays at the start of the mobile.", "Date": "February 18, 2014"}, {"Title": "Very disappointed, Do not purchase!!!!", "Author": "Shells", "ReviewID": "RP4ZKO3FOFOC6", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "Firstly, I ordered this phone on amazon as a present for someone.

Skip to the bottom if you want to know what I don't like.1st, don't believe what cnet or other sites tell you. It will always be cheaper in the end if you buy a phone unlocked. I pay 30 bucks a month for unlimited text and data with t mobile.I only get a hundred minutes, but let's be real. Free calls can be made with many Voip apps. Also, you have the freedom to use this on any GSM networks. I travel a lot, so this will save me lots of cash.2nd, I had a nexus 4. However, the stock android platform is cheap, ugly and not so user friendly.I have big hands, so my thumb always went to the home screen when trying to press the space bar. This is a boon to anyone, let alone those with sausage fingers like myself. Touch wiz has a button on the android task manager that closes all program. For stock android, you need to swipe each program out. It's a minor annoyance that adds up. It's even more frustrating that this could be a simple fix. There are all kinds of tricks that make navigating touchwiz much better than stock. If you plan on using a launcher, this probably won't matter as much to you. I used launchers in the past, and they don't really compare to built in software in my experience.3rd, better quality. This cost more than twice as much as the nexus 4. You get what you pay for! This has 16gb built in. Nexus 4 base version is 8. This has a removable batter and memory expansion slot.The battery on this lasts much longer than Nexus 4. This is impressive because of the 1080p resolution compared to the nexus 4 720p. Removing the Sim card from the Nexus 4 was a big pain. This one has an eject slot within the phone.4th, LTE. I don't know how good this works because t mobile doesn't have good lte in my area. But I like to know that it's there. Some people will say you can hack the Nexus 4 for LTE, but I don't know how true that is and not all of us have the time to spend troubleshooting this.MOST SURPRISING FEATURE: The IR port for using your phone like a remote. I'm not into TV, but I tested this out and it's kinda awesome.... It shows me a list of shows on, i tap the picture and it automatically goes to the channel. The days of flipping to find what you want are over. This works nicely with Comcast cable boxes and most televisions. I'm sure it works well with other cable boxes. I think this feature is gonna be a staple until all TV's get built in wifi.WHAT I DON'T LIKECamera: My galaxy Note 2 had zero shutter lag. this one has an annoying delay and is a step backwards despite its higher resolution.Polish software: We buy unlocked phones to avoid pre-installed software. My phone is apparently from Poland as stated in the paper. I find this kind of shady and wish I was told before buying it. HOWEVER, this software can actually be uninstalled! Unlike carrier software that may not be erased, I was actually able to remove the Polish applications without a root.S-Voice: this program is more than just a shameless knock off, it actually slows the phone down. I was upset before because my phone was so laggy. I disabled S-Voice, rebooted my phone and saw a substantial improvement.Samsung Bloat: Although Tocuhwiz is better than stock android, they are putting too much software on their phones. I wouldn't mind this if they were removable, but they are not. Many of their programs have better open alternatives. Also, if you travel internationally, Samsung is very strict on checking your sim card to assess what region you are in. This could be Samsung's eventual downfall. They need to make these apps open to all carriers and even competitors phones.Google Wallet DOES NOT WORK. Google is very strict with their wallet application, I have a Korean Galaxy Note 2 and now a Polish (International) Galaxy S4. Google wallet won't work with either even though they both contain NFC chips. Even putting American sim cards in the phones will not help. My Nexus 4 worked perfectly. So, I guess google can limits their applications by phone model. If Google Wallet is a must, skip this phone.CONCLUSION:I hate Stock android. I've had a nexus 4 and nexus 7. I love Touchwiz. I have had a galaxy s2, Note 2, and now S4. I chose this phone over the Google Play version because it's close in price, and Touchwiz is better. I work in Korea and Koreans are really good at making things that are practical to use. Stock android feels incomplete. It's mainly for developers that want to mess around with Android. If you don't want to develop, root, unlock then do yourself a favor and don't get stock android phones.I highly recommend most people to STOP doing contracts and just buy a phone outright. I have much experience in my career in many different countries around the world.These phone contracts are really really awful. This is my first time swallowing my own advice, and I don't regret it at all.", "Date": "June 29, 2013"}, {"Title": "Samsung Galaxy S4 i9505 16GB /LTE 800/850/900/1800/2100/2600 Unlocked...", "Author": "Maru Landaeta", "ReviewID": "R3GK59IA3T24NE", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "More than PLEASED.

been a while. We have two Galaxy S4 in the family. One black and one white both unlocked. There has been few firmware updates to the 9500 International series. I have been asked about the heat issue. Other than normal electronic heating feeling, it does NOT get super hot etc. In the initial days some people had issues, but apparently firmware has patched it. Version 4.2.2, BUILD: JDQ39.I9500XXUAMDX. Kernel 3.4.5-526212. I use Battery Widget Pro and has been watching battery usage. Easily for a day with normal usage. If I use video streaming and use NAVIGON indiscriminately, of course battery usage will shot down. Camera app does crash with latest updates. If I don't use camera for a day and use it, sometimes it crashes and phone reboots. After that no issue in subsequent sessions.  I have been using NFC a lot. I got the WhizTags NFC tags - NTAG203 Chip - 10 Pack + Keychain + Free Bonus Tag - Android Writable & Programmable - Adhesive Sticker Back - Samsung Galaxy S4 S3 Note 2 - HTC One First One X Droid DNA - Sony Xperia - Nexus - Smart Tags - Best Money-Back Guarantee! which is awesome. I use in conjunction with  NFC Task Launcher App. Samsung also has TecTiles App. When I go to office I tap a NFC Tag to get the settings I desire - eg vibrate, wifi on etc. At CAR different instructions and so on.Get a spare battery if you are using phone in an intense manner or if you are on long road trips or for just peace of mind. Timetec 2*2600mAh High Capacity Li-ion Battery for Samsung Galaxy S4 S IV SIV, I9500. Samsung Galaxy GT-I9500, Verizon SCH-I545, AT&T; SGH-I337, Sprint SPH-L720+Free Bonus TimeTecTM Multi-purpose USB Travel Charger is a great choice.Another great gadget to have in your backpack while traveling or at home is an excellen remote for this phone. Yes a remote for media and camera. I have reviewed it at Satechi BT MediaRemote Bluetooth Multi-Media Remote Control (White) for Samsung Galaxy S2, S3, S4 / Note, Note II / Galaxy Tab / Galaxy NexusORIGINAL REVIEWGalaxy S4 is  an incredible phone. I have been using this unlocked S4 for past 2 days helping a friend to migrate from iPhone 4S. My friend has been on iPhone and it also gave me a unique perspective. I used iPhone for couple of years and been using Android for past 3+ years.I have used Galaxy S3, Note II and for me S4 is more like a S3s :) If you have a Galaxy S3, it is perfect and there is no need to move to S4. The new features are more like minor upgrades for me. Just like Detroit rolls out new cars every year, phone manufacturers have found excellent way to make yearly upgrades.Battery came for almost a day. The video playback was crisp and my friend was amazed at the customization options. It is heaven for a iphone user to come out of shackles and explores the wonderful world of Android. It sure sounds like it is for geeks, but Samsung has created lot of ways to simplify and make it less intimidating. The EASY mode is for one such reason. Samsung's addition of all those apps (commonly referred as crapware) is not as bad as HTC or LG. Android experience is classified as pure vanilla in phones like Nexus. Vendors like Samsung have added a whole lot of extra programs.5\" HD Super AMOLED 1920 x 1080 display  (441 ppi) is just plain gorgeous. 13 MP camera takes ginormous image sizes. I put a 64 GB microSDXC card  SanDisk 64GB Mobile Ultra MicroSDXC Class 6 Memory Card with SD Adapter - Retail Packaging as my friend wants to take lot of movies (built-in 2 GB RAM, 16 GB ROM). No stuttering, and very smooth playback of videos captured in varying light conditions (HD Playback; HD Recording). Compatible video types are AVI/DIVX, WMV/ASF, FLV, MKV, MP4/3GP, WEBM. HDR and Panaromic photos were incredibly sharp. Compatible audio types are:  AAC, AMR, MP3, OGG, WMA/ASF, 3GA/M4A, FLAC, WAV. Google Music, PlayerPro Music player are producing excellent music.  Audio/Video is one section where S4 has nudged S3. For a normal user, if you are not into lot of video processing this does not matter.S4's infrared sensor is the same technology as TV remote control, so with WatchON you can change the TV channel from your phone. My friend was shocked to see this feature. Having used Android for a long time, I explored all new features one by one. My friend is still getting used to and feels this is too complicated. I broke down into lot of sub features and told my friend he may not use 50% of features, but told him to explore one feature at a time and focus on that.Games were very buttery, this phones runs ARM\u00ae-based octa-core mobile CPU. This is apparently world's first!  Inside this chip is Imagination Technologies' PowerVR SGX544MP3 GPU. I tried several car racing games and performance was phenomenal. People on the XDA-Developers forum report seeing smearing and ghosting when scrolling on the phone. This especially occurs to people when scrolling among darker colors, which begin showing up as purple. I tried hard to see if I could on the S4 I was testing with my friend and I could not see it. I am sure these can be upgraded with software over due course.Air View and Air Gestures - are they worth it? Air view is similar to how the S-pen on the Galaxy Note 8 works. Simply hover finger a few millimeters above the screen and in supported apps, you'll see a preview of content. This works with many of Samsung's built-in apps, including the photo gallery, the dialer, Samsung's browser and email client. It also works with Flipboard. Air View works by cranking up the capacitive sensor on the screen. Another new feature is Air Gestures. This uses the IR sensor on the top of the phone to detect movement by your palm or finger. One can flip between open tabs in Samsung's browser app, skip to a new song in the music player and do many other things. I say these are still in works and sometimes not very efficient.GPS was spot on and I tried multiple GPS apps. It was bright outdoors (had to crank the brightness all the way up). I tried multiple apps to demonstrate to my friend. In the end, my friend was impressed with what all Android and in particular S4 had to offer. Smooth and Stunning display!I tried following apps and they just worked awesome.Amazon MobileAndroid StatusAndroidifyAngry Birds (Space/Seasons)Asphalt 7Amazon App StoreBoxCar Maintenance Reminder ProChromeCNET TVNAVIGON (from Garmin - offline maps)Google Navigation/Earth/MapsGoogle Currents (nice way to read News)Draw SomethingGoogle DriveEbayLinkedinGoogle MusicTapatalk (awesome forum browsing app)OverDrive Media Console: Library eBooks & Audiobooks (public library consumption of media)Microsoft One Note (legacy docs, skydrive of 25 GB is good)Subsonic Music StreamerTerminal Emulator (still need to use vi, yes this is it)TweetCaster Pro for Android (excellent twitter client)Twit.TvGoogle VoicePlenty of WidgetsAsk questions, the review cannot do justice to Galaxy S4.

Samsung products make rooting a breeze by basically giving you easy access to do it through the Download menu in the phone's bootloader and with software called Odin that runs on your PC to get the needed files and software you need onto the phone.That aside, the bright vivid LED screen and smoothness of the animations make the Galaxy S4 the best phone on the market. Even the newer S5 isn't a better option to me because it's got very few improvements over the S4 and costs a lot more.The one major downside to the S4 is it's durability. The phone has a plastic construction that looks very nice, but one drop say...oh I don't know....on its' side into the corner of the bathroom sink....and it's got a shattered screen. However, the screen is easily replaceable. In fact the entire device has component parts that unplug from the main motherboard so they can be easily replaced if something like your camera goes bad. And its' not hard to open the device up and swap out defective parts.The most common flaw I see in these is dust build up near the proximity sensor, which causes the phone to always think it is near your face and thus it will keep a black screen after a phone call. This is easily fixed by opening up the housing and cleaning out the sensor. The whole process took me about 10 minutes.All the nerdy stuff aside, if you are jus tlooking for a great reliable stable phone, the S4 is a great option. It's processor allows for smooth scrolling and stable operation. It can also handle any app or game you throw at it with ease.", "Date": "April 23, 2014"}, {"Title": "Medium", "Author": "Hlaing Than", "ReviewID": "R38J9XZQW8ZNTM", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "The product is good but I can not get 4 G in USA for data.I lost the connection sometimes, too.", "Date": "April 8, 2014"}, {"Title": "It's a French Orange branded device with french interface and it doesn't support US T-Mobile and AT&T; 4G/LTE frequences", "Author": "Aleksandr Vasilev", "ReviewID": "R1WW1EACS865WX", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "It's a French device with french interface and doesn't support US T-Mobile and AT&T; 4G/LTE frequences.

Turned it on... didn't get the normal welcome screen where I get to choose the language. Maybe I was playing with something and missed it, wound up choosing some slavic language which a friend of mine was able to read. He also identified the \"life companion\" title on the lock screen as French. Got through the wifi log in, changed the language and logged into Google. Normal process from there.Speakers and microphone: The sound is pretty loud when it's turned up--I was actually startled at the notification of a message. The stock keyboard and I don't get along. My hands from base of palm to middle fingertip barely reach six inches/15 cm. This is a big phone. Love it to death, but the spacing of the stock keyboard means I wind up hitting B or N instead of the spacebar, even in portrait. Personal problem, I know. I had the phone on speaker when I called Etisalat to make sure the messages I get in the future are in English, they heard me and I heard them almost as clearly as if I were using the handset directly. The rep didn't even notice the generator running in the background.Camera: The camera works ok, there was a bit of fuzz on a still I took of a friend indoors. Admittedly, the lighting wasn't all that fantastic but I think it should've come out a little better. I'm coming from a Motorola RAZR Maxx HD. Technically speaking, this camera should make the one I'm used to go cry for mummy. I'll update later when I've used it more in different situations. 12/10/2013 Update: Camera works very well. I've taken many pictures in different lighting and all of them come out very well. It helps to not be too close to what you're trying to photograph. I used Skype to see if what I see on my screen is anything like what the other end sees. Called my friend on his Motorola RAZR HD and there was little degradation/fuzziness from me to him, but it seemed like normal conversion degradation.The hardware in general makes me a bit giddy. There was some semi glitching when opening the app drawer (which disappeared when I installed Google Edition 4.3) that may have something to do with all the pre-installed apps. Videos and off-screen goodness run smoothly. I'll post updates as nifty things come up.12/10/2013 Update: I've been able to see a movie, have apps update in the background and have a phone conversation at the same time without the movie picture stuttering. I can't play a movie and have apps update on other phones. The movie loses.I can't really provide good info on the stock interface/apps/whatever. I get irritated with carrier software and extras that are pushed on me, especially when I've bought a phone outright, without a contract.

Industry reporting indicates 44 percent of Android users are still using versions 2.3.3 through 2.3.7 - known as Gingerbread - which were released in 2011 and have a number of security vulnerabilities that were fixed in later versions. The growing use of mobile devices by federal, state, and local authorities makes it more important than ever to keep mobile OS patched and up-to-date.\"The bulletin proceeded to identify SMS Trojans, rootkits and fake Google Play domains as security threats and offered various mitigation strategies.For example, to fight against SMS Trojans it advised, \"Install an Android security suite designed to combat these threats. These security suites can be purchased or downloaded free from the Internet.\"To protect against fake domains, \"Install only approved applications and follow IT department procedures to update devices' OS. Users should install and regularly update antivirus software for Android devices to detect and remove any malicious applications.\"The IT industry and tech-savvy users have known about these types of security concerns - stemming from Android fragmentation, most mobile phone manufacturers' sloth and indifference, and user inertia and ignorance - for a while now. But apparently the DHS and FBI just noticed this summer. \u00b5", "Date": "August 28, 2013"}, {"Title": "good", "Author": "majed", "ReviewID": "R1QNBVY01BOYA8", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "Very good but there is no wifi accessoryother wise it is benificial easy to pick upI really like it", "Date": "June 5, 2013"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "$999.00", "Features": "3G: HSDPA 850 / 900 / 1900 / 2100 - 4G/LTE 800 / 850 / 900 / 1800 / 2100 / 2600\nDisplay: 1080 x 1920 pixels, 5.0 inches (~441 ppi pixel density)\nSuper AMOLED capacitive touchscreen, 16M colors - Corning Gorilla Glass 3\nInternal Memory: 16GB storage, 2 GB RAM\nCamera: 13 MP, 4128 x 3096 pixels, autofocus, LED flash", "Name": "Samsung Galaxy S4 i9505 16GB /LTE 800/850/900/1800/2100/2600 Unlocked International Version No Warranty White", "ImgURL": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41UrlBFnbWL._SX300_.jpg", "ProductID": "B00CIZFK9G"}}
