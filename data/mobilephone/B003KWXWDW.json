Have a problem?  Don't bother with LG's website because you won't find this model.  Don't bother contacting American support because they don't know that it exists.- International version means that the manual is in Portuguese!  Don't bother searching for an English users guide because this is a Portuguese phone.- Touch screen?  It only works when dialing a phone number in the vertical position.  Why, why , why???  Why not enable the touch screen for all of the screens and functions???After hours of searching for the USB driver, which I found on a U.K. website, I spent more hours trying to get the driver and software installed.  And for what?  The software to configure the phone and, you would hope, download contacts is worthless.The phone comes with 17, yes SEVENTEEN contacts pre-loaded in the phone.  But wait, they are in Portuguese with phone numbers going to who knows where! All phone numbers I'll never call because I don't speak Portuguese!  You can't delete them from the handset.  When I tried to delete them through the software not only did the contacts not get deleted, but they duplicated themselves, so now there's 34 Portuguese contacts and numbers that make it impossible to find the contacts I care about.  When I tried to delete them again, they doubled themselves again to 68!  I was able to delete the duplicates using the keypad, but I couldn't get rid of the original 17.The construction of the phone is plasticky and flimsy.  I'll never find out how long it would have help up because it's totally useless.The seller of this phone should be ashamed.  They know what they're sending to dupes like me who trust Amazon.  It's because of these unscrupulous sellers that I don't buy on eBay anymore.  Amazon should be more careful of who their merchants are lest they end up with the same problems eBay has.", "Date": "February 12, 2011"}, {"Title": "good phone", "Author": "C Guy", "ReviewID": "R17D62ZV0C9E0Q", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "has been a good phone but verizon requires a data plan to activate it - but of course a data plan is not required as any phone can be activated.", "Date": "December 27, 2013"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": null, "Features": null, "Name": null, "ImgURL": null, "ProductID": "B003KWXWDW"}}
