{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Data Plan Compatibility Comments for LG Dare", "Author": "AlecS", "ReviewID": "R26QFB14BOTGJP", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Prior to purchasing this phone, I was confused about whether or not the LG Dare required a Data plan, since many people on this review stated that it does not work without a data plan.  Sonow that I have the phone bought and activated, I thought I would let everyone know what I think is the definitive answer to whether or not this phone is compatible with Verizon's NO DATA plan option.  Here's my experience:- Before I clicked the \"buy now\" button, I called Verizon on the phone to ask.- Verizon specifically stated that this phone does NOT require a data plan.- After I received the phone and tried to activate it online on Verizon's website, the site said \"DATA PLAN IS REQUIRED FOR THIS PHONE.\"- I called Verizon, to ask them why I was getting a message that said \"Data plan required\" when I was told prior to the purchase that a data plan was NOT required.- Here's what they told me:  o  Whenever you buy a phone that has the capability to go online, their website automatically asks you to purchase a data plan.  There is an option online that says \"pay as you go\" data plan with no fixed charge, but a fee of something like $2.50 per MB of usage.  If you choose this option, you will not be charged a monthly fee, but you will be charged if you use the phone's internet access feature.  o However, if you call Verizon and ask them to disable the internet access feature, you will not only not incur any monthly charges, but you also do not have to choose the \"pay as you go\" data plan.==>> So to make a long story short - after you buy the phone, just call Verizon and tell them that you want to use the phone without any data plan and to disable any internet features of the phone.  And voila, you will have a touchscreen phone with no monthly or pay-as-you-go data fees.", "Date": "June 2, 2012"}, {"Title": "Excellent Phone", "Author": "Pat47", "ReviewID": "R3V6GHHM4QXE8O", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This phone is great. Touch screen sensitivity is not overly sensitive and you don't have to press to hard. I have this phone for about a week, and even though it did not come with a manual, i was able to figure it out easily. I bought this phone because I wanted a touch screen phone that didn't require a data package. The 3.2 mega pixel camera is outstanding. The phone comes with 7 cool animated backgrounds and several ringtones. If you want your own ringtones and wallpapers, I suggest myxer.com. They will send it from the internet to your phone. Another thing that I like about this phone is that contacts are easy to add. You can customize the layout of this phone by simply dragging and dropping, which is very easy to do. Virtual qwerty is easy to type on, I rarely hit he wrong key. Music player is great. all of my previous phones have had 2.5 mm headphone jacks which are pointless. This has a standard 3.5mm which means your iPod headphones can fit. The screen is easy to unlock, all you have to do is tap the lock icon in the bottom left of the screen.Pros- good touch screen, good calling, good qwerty, customizability, camera, easy to add contacts, good tools such as  calculator, stop watch, tip calculator, and my favorite, the drawing pad.Cons- space bar on standard keyboard is not in normal spot, (positioned more towards right side), videos can only be 30 seconds longAll in all, this phone is great for everyone, I am a teenager who constantly texts and listen to music, but it is not too complicated, because my mom can operate it.", "Date": "December 23, 2011"}, {"Title": "it was good with only minor issues.", "Author": "Jose Bassist \"d'oh?\"", "ReviewID": "R1SAB2QQ9S5KMJ", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "this was one of the few phone you could get that was touch screen but required no data plan at the time. i loved the size because i hate massive/heavy phones in my pocket. in all the time i had it, i really took care of it and only dropped it twice ever in the begining. i had it for almost the two years before out of no where the touch screen became non responsive and later the phone stopped accepting any calls. overall, i really liked this phone and was bummed out that verizon wasn't willing to replace it with the same one as they stopped carrying this phone. the only issues i had with it was that it's an early resistive touch screen and the screen is kinda small so my fingers would hit keys i didn't want to or moving the cursor while texting was a pain. my girl still has the exact same phone i did and uses her nails because it's more accurate, she has no problems texting like i did. i'm not sure what caused my phone to crap out on me because my girl's phone is still going strong. i guess i was unlucky. a good phone despite my issues and i would recommend it if you don't want a data plan but want a touch screen...and have small girl fingers.", "Date": "June 21, 2011"}, {"Title": "My favorite phone", "Author": "Conrad McConrad", "ReviewID": "R2HXBHKEXGYTCM", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I refuse to pay for data plans (I'm constantly around wi-fi so data plans don't do much for me).

I just barely got a LG Cosmos 2 (with necessary contract extension) and then my 2 year old dropped it into a glass of water, while I was out. I wasn't too disappointed, but needed a new phone.

Clark", "ReviewID": "R3H8SJZWNCB5KK", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Great BASIC phone!! Like many others, didn't want to get a SmartPhone and pay the additional (and required) Data plan. This LG Dare works fine for me. I was kind of leary about getting a \"touch screen\" only phone. I've only used \"hard\" button phones in the past. It's definitely no iPhone BUT...it's a very nice BASIC phone to use. The touchscreen is nice, but I'd highly recommend that you do the \"calibration\" before using it so it will get used to your touch.The only thing that was that when I activated with Verizon, I was told that it could not be used with my current plan (Americas Choice 500 Family Share Plan) and that I had to switch to another plan in order for it to work; which I did (NATIONWIDE LOYALTY SHARE 550 Family Plan) for the same price as I was paying previously. It was a hassle because the original Verizon agent accidentally put me on an Unlimited Talk Individual Plan for twice the price!!As for a few details about the phone:- Screen: Quality seems very nice and locks automatically after a certain amount of time; touch screen works great once calibrated- Keyboard: Obviously it's touchsreen based. For making calls it's easy. Turning horizontally for the QWERTY keyboard, the keys are a bit cramped for me, but I'm getting used to it and it works fine otherwise.- Camera: Good quality for stills; OK for video- Storage: Removable mini-SD card- Ring Tones: Decent selection- Speaker: Loud, sometimes distorts...at high volume of course...but otherwise good sounding. (FYI - When laying the phone down on a flat surface, it muffles the speaker volume a bit since the speaker is on the back of the phone)- Headphone Jack: It's 3.5mm which is great; no need to get a 2.5mm adapter!! 2.5mm headsets are kind of hard to find in the stores.Overall I would definitely recommmend this phone if you are looking for a great, basic (non-smartphone) touchscreen phone.", "Date": "February 16, 2012"}, {"Title": "Best cell phone I ever had", "Author": "Noiseboy", "ReviewID": "R2DLREFARV3ELC", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Got this thing in late 2008.  Verizon completely screwed up the firmware and software that came from LG.  Spent 2 weeks at the V-store until they finally got it to work like it should have when shipped. Three years later, after heavy use-abuse, this thing was working like a Rolex.  When it started to freeze (about every 4-6 months) that was a reminder to \"dial *226 and update me, stupid\". Voice commands and recognition were incredible.  Call clarity was superb. And the virtual QWERTY keys were huge with great tactile learning.  Then I left it outside in the rain all last night. After spending 2 hours on Verizon's web site, I now realize there is no phone on the planet that does what the Dare did without a data plan. Did I mention the ORIGINAL battery kept this thing going for 5 days on a single charge as of yesterday?  Try getting that out of ANY smartphone.Verizon wanted this phone to disappear ASAP because they knew it was a smart phone killer. You could do email and internet and GPS if you wanted to, and it was $10-15 a month extra.Lastly, the camera took excellent stills and decent video, the speakerphone was incredibly loud, and I had 40 picts and 130 texts stored in it and it NEVER said I had a memory shortage.Gonna miss this sucker bad...", "Date": "November 27, 2011"}, {"Title": "Great phone", "Author": "J.

To many people complain that they hear an echoe when speaking to me and can't make out what I am saying and I have to repeat myself .The touch screen has turned into a virtual monster.  I have to depress the same keys over and over and over just to unlock it, \"which is a great feature,so not to press buttons when in your pocket\"Sadly, the samething happens with texting which I do much of,Also, when scrolling through my contacts, I constantly have to start over since it doesn't stop on the contact I want, it seems to either stop on a different contact then I want or it freezes and opens another contact and I have to hang up and start over.Battery life is very good, I give it a full charge every 2 days and and am good to go.The video quality is very impressive but you need a memory card since it doesn't hold much, I made 2 videos about 60 mins each, I had the viseos put on disc and then deleted them and have new free space.The picture quality is also very good, however.It is VERY hard to see the screen when outside, I am trying to find a privacy screen and that should work that problem out.The hands free I don't care for since the speaker is on the other side of the phone, so u can either be heard of hear or option 3 keep turning the phone from side to side.I also want to add that when I first recieved the phone I was very pleased with the sound quality, I have  70% heaing loss and I can hear very well with it compaired to my other phones.It's a great phone for the person like me that likes the speed of a touch screen and isn't very savvy with todays gadgets, it's VERY user friendly and may I add, If they made made a smart phone book for Dummies I would be first online.HEHE.The company is very fair and easy to work with and I hope the replacement phone lives up to what I've seen this phone do because if it does, I have found the perfect found.I hope some of you find this review helpfuil and if have any questions feel free to ask and I will respond.HERE IS A DIRECT PASTE AND COPY FROM AN EMAIL FROM THE COMPANY I PURCHASED THE PHONE FROM,HAD THEY MENTIONED THIS I WOULD NEVER HAVE PURCHASED IT AND SO BACK IT GOES.Hello,\"The echo issues sounds like a defective microphone/speaker but the touchscreen is probably functioning as it should, this is just a cheaper old phone when touchscreens first came out. You would need to go with an iphone or Droid to get the latest technology that is very fluid and fast.

Miller \"skyking\"", "ReviewID": "R1KZ40LD0F5XUD", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "One of my two current 2 year old LG Dare cells is not working correctly. So I spent hours online researching for a different replacement that did not required a data plan. That was pretty much a waste of time. There aren't any with similar bells and whistles that don't have a QWERTY keyboard. Since I have no need for the keyboard, that only makes the phone thicker and less simple to operate. So I guess you could say that I'm a repeat customer.PROS: Nice size and bright screen, easy to operate after some self training. Excellent manual of instructions. Speaker volume is good. Sound quality is above average but probably won't impress audiophiles. You can use bluetooth or plug in an external headset/mic. Batteries are inexpensive and readily available. Not as bulky or thick as most smartphones (but still won't fit in a standard cell belt pouch).CONS: Even with a nice sized screen it is hard to see in bright sunlight. There are one or two places in the phone where the letters you need to press for a specific operation are in mice type. Not a lot of ring tones and you can't download them without a data plan. You can attach them to a text message tho.Two minor nuisances with this phone: 1- It has a resistive touch instead of a capacitive one. That means you will need a bit more pressure (or finger nails) to get the icons to work. 2- The battery case is a b**** to get off without breaking it.Unless you decide to go Smartphone and pay the data cost, I don't think you'll find a more convenient cell that the Dare.", "Date": "April 7, 2012"}, {"Title": "My husband is very happy!", "Author": "Marcy in Alabama", "ReviewID": "R3NDLHI3KSZ1IK", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "The LG Dare was my first smartphone and I loved it until I \"graduated\" to an even smarter phone, and gave the Dare to my husband, who had tired of his old phone. Recently, his Verizon contract came up for renewal, whereby he was eligible for a new phone at a discounted price (with a 2-year contract of course), but he refused to give up his Dare, in spite of its being all beat up (he had chosen to not use screen or phone covers while he had it). He was adamant about keeping his Dare, saying it did all he wanted it to do, it was the right size and feel, etc., etc. He also did not want to spend the extra money on a data plan he wasn't going to use (we both have plenty of computer access otherwise) so a smartphone was out.  Since I'm the \"geeky\" one in this family I did the research on feature (aka \"dumb\") phones he might like, and unfortunately the pickings were quite slim...it's obvious that the phone companies, or at least Verizon, are moving towards having very few feature phones, if any.  Desperate, I came to amazon--which is where I come first whenever I want to buy something. Not expecting to find it, I looked for and found the Dare through this seller.  The phone appeared to be brand new and we immediately had it activated at Verizon without any problems.  Plus: my husband is not locked into a 2-year plan! This time my husband agreed to a case and screen cover which I also bought through amazon.  My husband is very happy with this purchase,and I hope it will last him at least a couple more years. I should mention that the phone IS internet capable if that's something you do want. The only reason I am giving this item 4 stars is because the cover on the SD slot of the phone was loose.  My husband played around with it finally getting it to fit it, but we're not sure what will happen when he needs to open it again, if it will open or if it is stuck, etc.  This won't be a major problem since more than likely he won't be using the sd card on the phone for his pictures.  I complained to the seller about this and received a response within 24 hours.  By then the problem had been solved by my husband, but I appreciated the seller's willingness to help and satisfy me, the customer. So, the problem is not with the seller, but with a small defect of the phone itself.  I would not hesitate to buy again from this seller, and who knows, maybe in a few years my husband will want yet another Dare!", "Date": "February 5, 2012"}, {"Title": "had it for 3 years now...", "Author": "jimmy0803 \"jimmy0803\"", "ReviewID": "R3EM6A8HTSPZUV", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "...don't understand the complaints.

You can store close to about 300 texts and a hugh supply of pictures. it's not a smart-phone, so don't expect a smart-phone. it was one of the first totally-touch touch phones and was pretty much ahead of its time when it first came out. I had purchased the Voyager, but took it back the next day and exchanged it for the Dare because the Voyager gave you the option of typing on either the regular keyboard and the touch-keyboard.

I just read another review by a Dare user, however, that says that if you contact Verizon directly they will turn off internet features and you will not need a data contract.

The camera is not the best but it's manageable. The setup is great, extremely straight-forward, you don't have to worry about not being able to find something. It has an SD slot, which is extremely convenient when putting your pictures on your computer. Has a great music feature, very easy to load your music onto the phone. The actual problems had with the phone are coming up. The screen and buttons are extremely sensitive, it has massive \"butt-dialing\" problems. For example, you can turn off the phone, but 20 minuets later it'll be on and possibly have contacted someone, no a bad problem i grant you but i still recommend trying to get a case for it. Secondly,has low battery life (which now, that I've come to think of it, could possibly be because of it turning itself on) only lasts 10-15 hrs. And even though this isn't even a real problem, it has a lot of glare on the screen (a screen protecter could cut the glare down).

There are quite a few bugs in it.  I like to text with the regular numbers on word, and if I move the phone too much to the side it switches to QWERTY as it should.  When I try to flip it back to the numbers it'll switch to ABC input and you have to put it on word twice in order for it to stick.  It's also very difficult to get the cursor to the place you want it when texting.  This is an older touch screen, so you have to physically press the screen instead of just gliding your finger on it.  If you try to send a text while one is trying to come it, then your text won't send.  It'll just keep trying to send it and run your battery down, so you have to kind of monitor and make sure it actually sent.  If this happens you have to cancel the sent text and save it in drafts or retype it, and then resend it once the incoming text makes it in.  Every once in a while it'll kind of freak out and freeze, and I have to take the battery out and put it back in to get it to work again.  Sometime during a call the touch screen just won't work.  I don't like the fact that you can only input maybe 25 characters into the calendar when you're setting an event.  I never had a data plan with Verizon, so I can't really say how this does speed wise.PROS:  The battery is good for a few days, and I text a lot so that's pretty good.  I've dropped it many times, and it hasn't been damaged yet but I also have a rubbery protective case on it.  The screen isn't all scratched up either, but I've had a protector on it the whole time I've had it and I highly recommend doing that.  My fiance had the same phone last only a year, because he dropped it with a case and screen protector on it like I have and the screen shattered.

I guess it looks like a touchscreen without the data plan, and you don't have to feel inadequate for not having an iphone, because this one almost looks like one - if that matters to you.", "Date": "January 21, 2013"}, {"Title": "CANT USE AT ALL", "Author": "DANIEL PASIANY", "ReviewID": "R2JGQ7X4VY0D2L", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "i bought this phone online, unfortunately though, there is no much information provided about it on the website. When I received the phone I was so excited to have it. It looked all good from the look, little did I know that it could not be used outside USA since a sim card is not used in it. I contacted the seller and asked if there is any way I could make it useful instead of throwing it away(the only option I have). I got a response that the issue is being directed to someone who would help me out. This, I am still waiting to date. I was also told to contact VERIZON for more information, I did so via a link I found ion their website but they also never got back to me. The phone looks nice but I have not used it and still thinking on what to do with it, anybody with an idea?

Phone was not delivered when expected and wrote a review. Seller convinced me to remove review by offered me a discount. Promised that phone would be received by a certain day, did not receive phone so I contacted them and they could not track it. After a series of emails going back and forth I was promised another phone which I said I only wanted it if I were to receive it by a certain day and time which meant overnight delivery. I then received a call stating that it was an upgraded phone that was better than the Dare. I did receive the phone the next day but not in time to send with my daughter. The phone I received in place of the Dare is horrible not to mention that I could have bought it for less money than what I paid for when I ordered the Dare but I didn't buy it because of the reviews. I had a Dare previously which I loved. I called them and left a message stating that I wanted to return the phone but no one called me back. The person I dealt with during this whole time was very pleasant and apologetic but my overall experience with this purchase was terrible and now I am stuck with a phone for my daughter that is not user friendly and she hates it!", "Date": "June 1, 2012"}, {"Title": "Electronics", "Author": "Rosalie Swafford", "ReviewID": "R2626DRRCR8I0", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "I could not use this cell phone because I could not use my present plan.

Phone condition was excellent!My problem is with the phone design itself.I bought it for my BF who hated his old phone (screen was shot on it). he had bought me an ipod for unlimited texting months ago and thought it'd be cool if he got a phone with a touch-screen texting feature for his next one.After some research (and a limited budget) I found this model. I knew he didn't want his cell bill to go up (nor did I want him surfing Craigslist at all times during the day and night on his phone) so I didn't want a new Droid smart phone.Here are the PROS: screen is clear, battery-life seems good, excellent photos -- nice and clear, you can shop Amazon and find some sweet phone covers and cases to match it.Here are the CONS: screen typing is worthless -- no auto-correct! Your text message will be erased if you are typing and someone calls-in, text messages are displayed in one long string, not by conversation which makes continual texting in a conversation impossible. Very basic phone with few features.Bottom-line: I bought it in hopes my boyfriend would finally have a reliable phone with great texting features. He HATED IT MORE THAN HIS CRAPPY PHONE. He's done nothing but complain about the stupid thing so much so that I'm ready to grab it and chuck it into the woods and tell him to go get a Droid instead! I spent my whole paycheck on the thing and he hates it. Oh, and that snap-on case I bought? Sure it matches all his shirts but he hates that too because apparently it makes it impossibe to effectively clean the screen.Bottom line for me? I've never buying my boyfriend another present again.Might make a good phone for a 13 year old, or someone middle-aged who doesn't want something overly complicated.", "Date": "June 12, 2012"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "Unavailable", "Features": "Multimedia-oriented smartphone boasting spacious 3-inch touchscreen with handwriting recognition\nAccess Verizon's V Cast Music and Video service via fast EV-DO data network; GPS-enabled for turn-by\n3.2-megapixel camera/camcorder with Schneider-Kreuznach lens; Bluetooth stereo streaming; MicroSD ex\nUp to 4.7 hours of talk time, up to 360 hours (15 days) of standby time; measures 4.1 x 2.2 x 0.5 in\nIncludes: Handset, travel adapter/USB cable, user guide, quick reference guide, music CD", "Name": "LG Dare VX-9700 Cell Phone - Verizon or Page Plus", "ImgURL": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41hG19TU6nL._SX300_.jpg", "ProductID": "B001LYRBCO"}}
