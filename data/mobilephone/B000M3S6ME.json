The best feature is the FM radio. The antenna provided by Nokia is weak, so I recommend using an alternate - any 2.5mm headset will work fine. Just for comparison, I spent $300 on my previous phone, a light-weight Samsung phone w/ FM radio. I was disappointed with the Samsung - the phone itself was fine, but it used proprietary adaptors limiting my headset options. I bought 3 Samsung headsets, and all produced too much static for the FM radio to be useful.", "Date": "August 17, 2010"}, {"Title": "Nokia", "Author": "Ivan Aguirre", "ReviewID": "R23JSRQLA1W9TL", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "A very nice phone to have.

This phone has bluetooth which works wonderfully. I've tested the range of the bluetooth to be about 17 feet. It is very reliable and I have not had any disconnect issues with the bluetooth. The camera on this phone is quite basic, but it works if you are willing to wait for it to load. I was shocked how wonderful the phone was when I opened the box.

Yes, that's still better than buying it unlocked elsewhere, but should be kept in mind when comparing to other phones you are considering.  Go through the purchase process to screen where you enter credit card details and look at the price at the very bottom of the page to see what tax they will charge. Some people may not even notice that it gets added in there.Secondly, if you go with the refurbished version to save a few bucks, realize that you get a much shorter warranty period (90 days) on a phone that may have had technical issues once already rather than the full year warranty that applies to a new one.We bought the precursor to this model, the 2320, for our middle school student. However, I wanted one with Bluetooth to use as a back up for my own phone or to give to our other kid as needed, and it serves the purpose well. The 2320 was just $15 at retailers near us (with tax on the $15 only) and came with $15 worth of minutes to make it virtually free.  I made the mistake of putting my SIM card in it first before activating to see if it would work for me, and so the $15 credit was added to my normal plan account as extra minutes.  Unfortunately, I don't need them since I never use up my rollover supply, but so be it.We get pretty good reception on both these phones and when my kid calls, he sounds fine (San Fran Bay area).", "Date": "January 22, 2011"}, {"Title": "loved it", "Author": "Tahsin Mowla", "ReviewID": "R32U9NW3AB28NI", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "it was small, easy to use and very useful for international travelling. the sim changing part was very easy while on journey!", "Date": "November 20, 2013"}, {"Title": "phone is locked with other network provider.

The only problem I have with it, the description says that the phone has a flashlight and radio but does have a flashlight and to use the radio you need a headset, I don't know if is because I received the T-Mobile version or because of the seller.

I have pretty low expectations in a phone and read reviews in advance.  Unfortunately, I didn't find many at that time.  After using for a year, I can say this is just a lousy phone.  My biggest complaint is that I have a lot of difficulty hearing people when they are speaking and am frequently apologizing and asking people to repeat themselves.  My second biggest peeve is that even basic functions, such as changing the ring type (from ring to vibrate, for instance), is a process that involves 3 different menu screens.  And forget changing the ring volume.  As expected, the camera quality is poor.

Yes that is right, 5 dollars and 32 cents with 2-day shipping.Note that this is advertised as a pre-paid phone but it works as a normal phone too. I switched the sim card out of my older phone into this one and it works like a charm with my current plan.So given the fact that the phone is 5.32 you shoudlnt be expecting an Apple iPhone or Blackberry. But it does have blue tooth and a camera. So the 4 stars is for the price and use to make / receive calls. If your an avid texter or like to surf the net, this will be a pain to use.

It only supports GSM dual bands (850/1900) that can only be used in USA and Canada while a lot other phones, even the very basic models, support GSM 4 bands (850/900/1800/1900) that can be used worldwide. Its camera is the one with the lowest resoultion you can find in the market nowaday. It uses poor VGA (480x640) quality in 0.3 mega pixel, and its video uses only six frames per second in 128x96 resolution. To make it even worse, the photos and videos it took are unfocused, full with noise and strange colors. It comes with a low 32M shared internal memory and it does not allow you to use an external memory card to expand. Due to the very small memory, the music player is basicly cannot be used. In addition, the junk files (the demo games), weblinks, some built-in wallpapers, tone rings, and themes are all system files which cannot be deleted, that only left with about 4M free memory. Even by using \"Mobile Media Browser\" software to delete those \"system\" games, themes, and some ringtones, that will gain some more free space, it still has only about 8M free memory. Hence, you can only use it as a phone, period. (However, it does come with a FM radio.) I feel that the 1.75 inch screen (with resolution of 128x160) should be a little up to allow more room for the very small keypad, which is hard to do text messaging. The phone did freeze couple times in my experience that is at least a basic phone should not happen in any case. I had to remove the battery to shut it down. The battery standby time is so-so that only lasting about five days with some occasional using.

It was not made clear on the TMobile website what a \"refurbished\" phone is--if you don't know, a \"refurbished\" phone is a USED phone. If I had known that, I would have bought a NEW 6301.The sound is terrible. The person I'm talking to sounds like they're using a tin can with a piece of string attached, and I'm told that they have trouble hearing me on their end, no matter what kind of phone they're on.The screen is so inferior, compared to the large, bright, clear screen on the 6301--I have to hold the phone at an angle to see what's on the screen, and it is very dark; any picture you might have on the wallpaper is pixellated.Speaking of wallpaper--I can set a slide show, like on my 6301, but there isn't a feature to have a screensaver once the screen goes dark--VERY disappointing.The memory's not that great, either; and if I could delete the pictures and sounds and message templates that came with the phone, I'd have more memory for my own pictures and sounds (it's MY phone, is it not?)... unfortunately, this seems to be a feature on TMobile phones that the person who purchases the phone has no say in.I hate this phone so much!! If I could find another 6301 ANYWHERE, I'd buy it in a second, no matter what the cost--it was the best phone I've ever had.
