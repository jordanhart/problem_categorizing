{"Reviews": [{"Title": "A great upgrade from the CS50!", "Author": "RST10", "ReviewID": "R11VHO30IOIUKK", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I've owned several Plantronics headsets over the years, and yes, the good ones are all expensive. That being said, they've been making great strides in improving comfort and functionality. This unit replaced a CS50 that I used for VOIP applications and plugged directly into a computer. This headset has many other features that the CS50 had, but I wanted to write a review specifically for those considering upgrading from a CS50. I use this particular model instead of Bluetooth or others because the range is exceptional-- almost as good as a cordless phone, and in some cases better! Far more than Bluetooth could ever think of with today's current standards.What makes this unit better than the CS50? A few things:1. Lighter/smaller2. Replaceable tips and ear holders so you can customize the fit for your head. Really helps for those multiple hour calls.3. You can use a USB dongle to plug in to the PC instead of having to plug the dock in via USB like the CS50-- better for travel & mobile use.4. The unit will charge via USB dock if you don't have a power adapter with you-- much more mobile than the CS50.5. The ear piece is smaller and fits in the ear with a gel instead of a \"one size fits most\" on the CS50.6. The ear tip actually SWIVELS forward & backward-- maybe the single most innovative part of this unit compared to CS50. No work, it just adjusts to fit you properly!7. Far more mobile-friendly. Comes with a hard shell carrying case so you can take just the USB adapter, the headset, and USB charging cable.8. The audio quality is excellent, and has a little better user feedback than CS50 so you can tell if your mic is open or not.9. Battery is far more easily replaceable, though I've never had to replace a battery in the past.10. Also works great with MAC without any additional install of software. OS X current supports it automatically. I primarily use it with Windows 7.I couldn't be more pleased with this device as an upgrade to the CS50. It sounds good on both ends, and I can also say that it works well with Google Voice, Skype, and other \"not corporate\" VOIP solutions as well. As we travel, we have business and personal life that doesn't stop and this device helps connect you to both seamlessly.I know they're pricey-- but if you're a true professional or demanding of a great headset or talk lots of hours or frequently, you will be very pleased with this device.", "Date": "May 21, 2012"}, {"Title": "Great soft phone for wireless talk", "Author": "TexasGirl", "ReviewID": "R327HYIWHXV58A", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I've tried a number of wireless headsets for soft phones.  I work from home about 60% of the time, and spend most of my day on conference calls with people in other locations.  I had a Plantronics C50 headset, but this is a great upgrade.Plusses:1. It is wireless both from the USB base, and the USB base plugs directly into the computer without a wire.  The C50/60 version had a charging base that was wired to the USB port and wired to the power.  THis one is wired only to the power (which doesn't have to be connected to the computer) and the USB connection is a small toggle that plugs into the USB port.  Now I don't have to have messy wires on my desk (I can keep the charger somewhere else where it isn't in the way).2. The unit itself isn't that large compared to most softphone headsets.  It has three options for wearing:  over the head, around the back of the neck, or over the ear.  This is extremely versatile and gives you the options to fit it to your personal preference.  Others I've seen only have two options.3. The quality is good. I can walk all over my house - upstairs and downstairs without interruption.4. The buttons are easy to use.  On the C50/60 version, the mute wasn't as easy to find and I ended up cutting off my calls a few times before I got the hang of it.  THis one is really easy to use.5. The wearing styles are all lightweight and comfortable.  The last Jabra I tried (and returned within one day) would never fit over my ear (this one has three different ear pieces), and the over the head piece wasn't adjustable and was too big for my head.Minus:1. Expensive2. None of the wireless headsets have as good a quality as the wired ones, so a very small minus there, but read: VERY small.3. It's bigger than the ear pieces you use with your mobile phone.  If you want something that small, recognize that your bluetooth quality with a softphone app is never as good as the USB wireless.  There's just too much interference.  However, as designed-for-softphone headsets go, this one has a small profile and is lightweight.Overall I give this 5 stars.  It is without a doubt the best I've used, and I've tried them all: USB/Bluetooth, bluetooth, wired, over the ear, over the head, behind the head.  I've had three logitech models (all wired), two Jabra models (both wireless), multiple bluetooth ear pieces that also work with my iPhone, and three plantronics.  The plantronics are the best, and this is the best of the best.For people who spend a lot of time on the phone, this is great.Would definitely recommend.", "Date": "January 12, 2013"}, {"Title": "USB CS50 replacement", "Author": "Rob White", "ReviewID": "R2O472WMKVMQWK", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "The Plantronics USB W440 wireless headset is supposed to be the replacement for the USB CS50 laptop headset.  My company used and sold the USB CS50 for the last 6 years with our home inspection software.  The CS50 had a range of 200 feet, depending on the home and a battery life of about 6 hours.  In testing the W440 replacement, we found the range no where near 300 feet from inside the home, more like 50 feet and the battery only last about 3 1/2 hours instead of the 7 hours advertised.  It was recommended to use an USB extender cable to locate the USB dongle away from the laptop as that could interfere with the transmission (why create a USB dongle that plugs into a laptop if it can interfere).

The narrowband bluetooth audio codec leaves me struggling to hear and be heard, and the ones I've tested seem to add a vexing amount of delay.Enter the Savi, which uses DECT instead of bluetooth, and that makes a world of difference. Now, instead of being chained to my desk with a wired microphone or a short-ranged headset, I can get up and walk around anywhere in my house. The battery lasts me about six hours of continuous use.But it's not just about range and talk time: usability also matters. I find the Savi quite comfortable wear for its entire battery life, although the single-ear wear option doesn't feel particularly secure. The headset has noise cancellation that works well in rooms with air conditioners and fans that are loud enough to wreak havoc with my laptop's internal microphone. I even got in my car and drove it maybe ten feet before the called party noticed---and that's only because I lost my connection.All of this means that I am free to wander around and do things when I'm on the phone---without worrying that I'm transmitting a ton of noise. This makes holding long conversations a lot more convenient and natural. If you pair it with a high-quality, 1080p webcam, it's the next-best thing to actually being there.In terms of downsides, the mute button is a little hard to press in, and the hardware up/down buttons don't seem to change the volume a whole lot. You can adjust the volume more on your computer, just like any other audio device. The audio is on par with a very good landline telephone connection, which makes sense given its DECT innards. Still, if you're looking to listen to music or movies, you're probably better off buying a device that is designed for that purpose. The headset is fully linux-compatible, although on Ubuntu 13.04 it is necessary to add some lines to your xorg.conf file to get it to work correctly.I don't know how the Savi compares against other high-end wireless headsets, but it has absolutely been worth every penny.", "Date": "August 9, 2013"}, {"Title": "Pretty solid device", "Author": "AZ Lion \"AZ Lion\"", "ReviewID": "R2R62EQ7F0ETQC", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Easy to set up.

I would have given it a 5 star rating and even maybe gone 6 stars in the text here if not for the advertised integration with Skype being so poor. If they were to stop advertising this integration as a feature then every aspect of the device would flawlessly earn a 5 star rating.I spend about half my day on the phone in meetings. After each call I simply put the headset in the cradle, it puts itself in the correct mode automatically and charges itself. I have been on calls of several hours in a row and never had any sign the battery was getting weak.The range of the device is nothing short of superb.  With my old headset I could have taped a line on the floors of the house for where it would cut out. I couldn't get to the kitchen to make tea during a call. I also pace quite a bit when in a meeting and being on a call with my previous headset was like being leashed to my desk. I'd have to stop going in a particular direction within about 10 feet in mid stride as if the leash had gone taught. With this headset I can even go out and check the mail while on a call for crying out loud! (This actually saved my behind when I agreed to take a letter to the mailbox for my wife and saw it setting on my desk when the mailman was at our mailbox. I grabbed the letter and ran to the box expecting to be dropped from the call, but instead heard every syllable spoken.) I have walked to every corner of our \"largish\" house with no loss of clarity. This means I can go on mute and maybe play a game of pool during those really boring company status updates.  ;^)The advertised Skype interface simply didn't work out of the box. The software was easy enough to download once I was able to locate it, but failed to work after being installed.  The first call to support had me updating the device firmware. I only run OS X and Linux systems in our house and unfortunately the firmware can only be upgraded through the Windows OS, so I had to come up with a Windows system to do the update. That was more than a little irritating. The firmware update did do the trick and got me connected. Unfortunately connecting is only a portion of what is needed to have a successful phone call. One needs to be able to answer incoming calls and hang up the phone when the call is completed. I'll not go into the gory deals of the hoops I had to jump through in order to accomplish these fundamental tasks, but suffice to say the interface for the headset buttons to operate Skype was severely compromised. After several more calls to an exceptionally helpful support desk we determined that the software simply won't work on my version of OS X which is not even close to being considered unsupported by Apple. I started refusing to continue updating OS X when Apple started forcing the incorporation of facebook software on the end user in their OS. Nobody I know actually trusts that company whether they use the service or not, so why Apple would incorporate the software of such an untrusted entity in their most important software product I have no idea. Anyway, I bring this up only to make the point that there are legitimate reasons for my not upgrading OS X and being left without the Skype support for the headset.The numerous options for the earpiece assure that the headset is a comfortable fit for about any human being, and probably even most primates should they find their self needing to take a call. I use the \"over the ear\" approach myself and find it very comfortable.All in all, the core functionality of the device is excellent, the battery life is excellent and the customer support is excellent. If Plantronics were to stop advertising the sketchy Skype support as a phone feature that drags it down and make it an optional add-on, they would certainly have just about a flawless device offering.", "Date": "January 3, 2013"}, {"Title": "Works for both Mac & PC.", "Author": "P.
