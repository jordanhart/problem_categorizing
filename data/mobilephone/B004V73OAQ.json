I bought this phone for my wife when it was brand new from T-Mobile. It has been nothing but a headache since about 3 weeks after we got the phone. I bought my wife another phone and took the G2X once the issues began.I won't overwhelm this review with technical issues, but I will highlight the main ones. Also you most know that I had full coverage on the phone and both T-Mobile and LG are slugs when it comes to customer service.1. LG had issues with the battery running hot which caused phone issues. I had to send the phoneback to LG twice and it still over heats occasionally.2. Phone powers off at random times and freezes every few days. This requires a full battery pull torestart the device.3. The phone also has horrible reception. I live one town over from T-Mobile's US headquarters andyou would think I'd have the best service, but no =(.4. Sent the phone back to T-Mobile and they finally admitted the phone was a flop.In return I got a new LG G2x with the same issues but a few more days between freezes.5. Upgrades to the operating system come slow if at all. LG knows they screwed up the programingon what should be an awesome Google phone. So in return they concentrate on their other newerdevices.I have had nothing but problems with this phone and will never by a LG product again! I'm not normally like that this but LG's customer service is horrible. As for my relationship with T-Mobile, I'll be leaving them in September when my contract is up. It is sad because I have been a happy subscriber since 2000 and they did nothing for me after repeated complaints about this phone. Everyone constantly shifted the blame amoungst each other.Please do your research and pick another phone.", "Date": "November 26, 2012"}, {"Title": "LG Optimus 2X", "Author": "sERTAc", "ReviewID": "RLAR0IXH65GNT", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I bought LG Optimus 2x unlocked phone from amazon.com and I am using it in Turkey without any major problem. People say this phone resets itself everyday, but mine resetted itself just 2 times in 2 months, which should be normal. The phone is very fast, camera is good, tegra chipset is good, sound is good. With gingerbread update, this machine is gonna be superior. I recommend this product from amazon.com.", "Date": "August 11, 2011"}, {"Title": "Dont Purchase this phone with no warranty with Wireless Everthing seller", "Author": "Sudhir", "ReviewID": "RM8SH6JBGGN3U", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I am writing this review after using the phone for 3 months. I purchased this mobile phone LG P990 from Wireless everthing.From the beginning itself the phone was restarting by itself and also was getting automatically switched off and the phone is also not able to catch the network properly. Within 2 months of usage my GPS is not working. I dont know what will not work after a certain periiod of time. I am truly dissapointed with this mobile phone. I think i have not been given new cell phone, I think its a repaired one or refurbished. Thats why i think it does not have any warranty. I think amazon.com should not encourage this 3rd party vendors. This will also ruin amazon goodwill. Amazon should encourage the vendors who gives warranty.", "Date": "October 23, 2012"}, {"Title": "awesome phone", "Author": "Saul", "ReviewID": "RYBOINL00DXA3", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Great phone, fast and reliable.  Every once in a while the phone shuts down or reboots on itself.

It is the P990-V10B , with T-Mobile 3G (900/1700/2100) not AT&T.; It is a shame Amazon doesn't mention the 3G frequencies on it leaving the buyer to guess. Accompanying documents were in English/Portuguese; so I assume it was meant to be sold in Brazil or Portugal. It couldn't access the internet on AT&T; not even on 2G. Still; navigating the device seemed very responsive and speedy and I think the LG skin is not too bad.", "Date": "July 15, 2011"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": null, "Features": null, "Name": null, "ImgURL": null, "ProductID": "B004V73OAQ"}}
