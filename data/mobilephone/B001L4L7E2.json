{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Works great WHEN and IF it wants to - not reliable", "Author": "Susan Myers", "ReviewID": "R8DTK6UWP8RNA", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "Well my Blackberry Pearl 8110 that I have had for 5 months is going in the garbage.  The constant rebooting during phone calls has become intolerable over the last 3 weeks. When I inquired I was told that it is \"outdated\" but upgrading to a new Blackberry bold would solve the problem. (Sounds like a marketing ploy but I have no choice)  My local store that carries these took my name.  I had to go on a waitng list for the next shipments of phones due to the amount of Blackberry Pearl 8110 people have replaced over the last month, they sell the upgraded phone as fast as they get them in.If you choose to purchase, print out these steps and memorize them, you will be doing this during all the random reboots that occur several times a day.  If you think it won't happen to you, at work I immediately found several people who were getting rid of this phone, and several who were forced to get rid of it and replace it at their own cost due to this problem over the last week.This will be your life with this phone:Anywhere from 5-10 minutes into a phone call, it will reboot for 5 minutes, works for two minutes then turns off and reboots again.  Then about the 4th cycle, it doesn't come back on, the red light flashes except it is otherwise dead.  Take the battery out put it back in and it will come on and reboot for another 5 minutes.  Maybe you can talk for 5 minutes and the next reboot begins, your call is dropped, it has a red flashing light and dead phone, take the battery out and put it back in and watch the dead phone flash the red light (they only thing that works) for better than 5 minutes until it comes on and reboots again.  Today it did this for 35 minutes where I was unable to use it for the entire 35 minutes.  For someone who travels in by myself, I can't have a phone that talks to the mothership more than me.  It has definitely gotten worse over the last 3 weeks.  Sometimes it will work OK for a couple of hours but it is unpredictable.  It otherwise works great.  I even turned the data off before I make a call and turn it off and on thinking it will be happy and work for more than 10 minutes.WRONG!  I do not have the time to spend a day making phone calls and replacing this phone and neither did anyone else I found when we compared notes.", "Date": "April 3, 2009"}, {"Title": "brilliant", "Author": "David L.

S. Gowen", "ReviewID": "R35GJZNNO6Y9K", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I admit that this phone is inferior to many smart-phones that are currently on the market. Those all, however, require a data plan to use. If you are like me and want a quality phone without having to pay for a data plan then this is the phone for you. I have been using a BlackBerry Pearl for the last 6 years, so I am pretty familiar with its pros and cons.Pros:-Modified qwerty keyboard. While it is not a full qwerty (most of the buttons share two letters) I only commonly run across one mix up (\"see\" and \"are\"). That is a HUGE improvement over 9 key.-A smart phone quality calendar.-Very good media player-Bluetooth-Great Address book options.-Unlimited text inbox space; not the 250-500 text limit that virtually all phones have.-Many text search options. Great for when you are looking for that text you need but can't remember when you got it or who sent it.-Voice dialing-Fits very well into a pocket-Can set any size file as a ringtone, alarm, etc....I could go onCons:-The camera and video camera are not very good. I understand that there are people for whom a phone camera is more important than a calendar or address book or wifi then this is not the phone for you.-Much like a roller ball mouse, every year or so the track ball needs to be cleaned. There are many tutorials online that explain how this should be done. Once cleaned it works like new.-The headphone jack is smaller than is standard for headphones. If you want the standard 3.5mm jack then you probably want to upgrade to the pearl 8130.I have used many many phones, but this is far and away the best NON-SMART phone I have ever used.
