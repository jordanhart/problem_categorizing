I paid for two day shipping as i was due to travel the phone arrived after i left and only after i contacted the seller. Upon arrival and opening the box i got a used phone with scratches on the face plate, the wrong charger, the back plate is replaced with a cheap cover from another supplier. Upon opening to insert the battery the inside is dirty and has a green dust on the phone and there is no memory card.  So decided to return only to realize i will now lose 15% restocking fee plus shipping ($81 or 18% cost of phone). Worst yet the supplier writes me to remove the bad review on the shipping problems as its bad for business. If the business was good i will not have an issue. Anyway the Torch is a great phone this is the third i am buying, the first from this supplier.

Actually, as a matter of fact I didn't want the Torch at all. I started out with a BlackBerry Bold and I loved it. The keys were just the right shape, the screen was unscratched and shiny, and the phone fit perfectly in my hands as I did the traditional \"finger fold phone hold.\" You know the one where you lock all your fingers and use your pinkies as support? One day I dropped my beloved Bold and for some reason the screen just went out. It completely stopped working and honestly, I was devastated. I went on the computer through the phone insurance compact just to find that I could not receive another Bold for some odd reason. So my phone company sent me a Torch as a replacement. At first I was disappointed because I heard bad things about the Torch and originally I wasn't a fan of touch screen.That day that I got my new BlackBerry was long anticipated because it was practically torture to go a week without a phone at all. When I opened the delivered box to find my new BlackBerry Torch I was very surprised that I loved it. The screen was a smooth black and it was huge. When I pressed the power button the backlight lit up a bright blue in my face and I was very satisfied. I pushed on the lower half of the screen and slid out the keyboard. I was very happy to find that the keyboard that I adored so much on the bold was the exact same keyboard as the one on my Torch.I've had this BlackBerry Torch for over a year now and I am very happy with it. Though after a while its starting to act weird, its one of the most reliable phones I've ever had. I have dropped this phone almost every day since I got it in the mail and it hasn't broken yet. I use it to blast music while I'm in the shower and it is yet to become water damaged. One of the problems I seemed to face with my BlackBerry Torch is, even though my screen is locked, when my phone is in my pocket it still presses buttons and calls people constantly. I could set a password but I would rather it just be harder to unlock with a button. The applications that turn on by my pocket kill my battery. That is one issue I have with all BlackBerry products. The battery life is terrible. I considered buying a second battery at one point. Compared to the iPhone, the applications are limited. There are very few things you can do with a BlackBerry and that is one of the reasons it falls short of the iPhone. I also feel like there is no reason to compare the BlackBerry and the iPhone because even though they are both business phones and use data plans, they are nothing alike. In a general sense, the good outweighs the bad with the BlackBerry Torch. I feel it is a reliable phone for a touch screen and it has gone through great trials as my phone. Poor thing has been dropped at least once a day L. If you are #TeamBlackBerry, the Torch is the way to go.", "Date": "March 4, 2012"}, {"Title": "Battery charger not functional", "Author": "Allison Jean \"aajean\"", "ReviewID": "REJ58SR7BMYLD", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "The phone is working fine but the charger is not functional.

I was skeptical about getting another Blackberry but I have been pleasantly surprised with the durability of this phone.  I've replaced the battery once and with heavy use it lasts a day which for me is from 6am till midnight. The buttons on the keypad are a bit small for me and I have relatively small hands for a man. However, I wanted a touch screen that would also allow me to use a regular keypad when I wanted. I am not a fan of the keypad on screen. Blackberry could use some help in creating new apps though. This really has more to do with the market than the phone itself. I've dropped the phone on more than a few occasions over the years and it is solid as a rock. The camera on this phone is awesome and has replaced my need for carrying another device on trips. It is also nice to have a calendar that doesn't have to be cleared every few months. By the way I bought this phone as a refurbished item from ATT and it was free with my upgrade, so 2 years with trouble free service was worth the price. If you use speaker phone or lots of internet then I would recommend a high capacity battery. I use both very little.

He can't go more than about three hours of heavy use before needing to recharge. I have found the slider to be very well built compared to others (like Palm Pre models for example. Yes the 9800 does lag sometimes. It doesn't have the screen resolution or processor to compete with the iphone or high end android phones. It wasn't meant to. It's strength is that it has both a physical qwerty keypad and a touchscreen, making it a smartphone for someone that texts and emails a lot. Also, the Universal Search is great.

Don't asked me why I waited so long to finally get one. What a disaster. There's some kind of a software glitch on the Torch 9800 that leads to this device getting stuck in a loop when trying to boot up. It happened to me about 4 or 5 times during my warranty period, and AT&T; had no clue how to fix it so they kept giving me a new one.I was very disappointed in the operating system. The app selection was a joke. (I was used to iOS.) The touch response was subpar. The browser was abysmal. I had to use Opera, which was still far behind Safari (and I'm not even a fan of Safari, so that's not a huge bar to reach).Right around 13 months into the life of the phone, it began shutting off at the slightest bit of movement. For example, if I were to take it out of my pocket and place (not drop, but place) it on a table, it would shut off. Of course, the warranty had expired so I was SOOL. Then there's the issue of software updates. I was used to iOS and (not knowing as much about BB as I should have) did not realize that their OS updates don't apply to older phones. Of course, if you have an iPhone 4S and there's an iOS update, it applies to the iPhone 5S, 5, 4S and even 4. Not the case with BB. Nope, you have to buy a new one to get the new OS.Then, once service ends with your carrier, so does BB's support. With Android and Apple, you can continue to use the app store, get software updates, use Apple/Google messenger services, etc. even after your carrier service ends. Blackberry blocks support for all of those once you stop your service. The only things that you can do is use the browser and watch video (in \"stunning\" 360x480).Is it any wonder that this company's U.S. market share has dropped from 50+% to under 1% in a few years? They have no respect for their customers once the device has been paid for, and they failed to think that people would switch to another platform once their contracts ended. Yes, I'm sure Blackberry's current device(s) and OS is better than the Torch, but many of these same issues are still present.Blackberry defenders used to say that apps were worthless, but now they talk about how great apps are now that you can \"port\" Google Play apps. They used to laugh at high-pixel displays, and now they tout the \"stunning clarity\" of current BB screens. They said they couldn't do without a physical keyboard, yet today most of their devices are without one and all devices have a touchscreen. Blackberry has moved towards everything they used to oppose, yet they are so far beyond Android and Apple that they are nothing more than just another copycat off-brand (Palm/webOS anyone?).I'm happy to say that I no longer use that phone. My contract recently ran out and I ran to Apple as quickly as possible. (I also own an Android/Nexus tablet.) I have owned about 5 or 6 touchscreen phones/tablets over the past 4 or 5 years and I have never had a device give me anywhere near the number of issues that the Torch 9800 gave me. It was unprecedented. The only thing that came close was my first touch device, the original HTC Touch on Windows Mobile. But even that device, which was awful, lasted far longer than the Torch did and gave me fewer issues.
