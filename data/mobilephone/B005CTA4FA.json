Lindros \"Angel\"", "ReviewID": "R2QVGCMWC7GET5", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I gave it four stars (instead of five) because the keys are a little hard to push...you need to use a bit more pressure than what I would call 'normal' when using the physical keyboard.  I replaced my 'MyTouch Q' with this one, and, thus far, have been pleased with its performance.  The camera is hit or miss, but when it is 'hit,' the pictures are VERY sharp!  It phone, itself, is smaller than the MyTouch Q, but the screens seem to be nearly the same size.  I would definitely recommend this cellphone to those users who are adamant about having a 'qwerty' keyboard.  It is loaded with extras (like viewing contact history for any of your contacts by simply swiping left/right while on the contact's name).  Good value.", "Date": "January 9, 2014"}, {"Title": "Better than any other phone I've had!", "Author": "xXCustomer.AccustomedXx", "ReviewID": "R2WRLTM2T2JEJ0", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Only problem is battery life, but you can get an app for that and certain backgrounds change your battery life significantly!Clear picture resolution on screen, great live wallpaper presentation, easy touch, amazing keyboard.All accessories for this phone are cheap now since it's not an iPhone but honestly, I prefer this phone over the Samsung Galaxy, and my current waterproof android.
