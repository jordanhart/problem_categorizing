{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Samsung Seek M350 Review", "Author": "Viet1982", "ReviewID": "R2LTVZ0C4PKK30", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "First off, I believe this is a good phone for it's price. The people complaining about the various issues might be spoiled from the other phones they've used in the past. I noticed one reviewer complained that it wasn't a \"Smartphone\" No where in the description does it state it is one.It does simple tasks such as texting, web browsing,play mp3 files,takes photos and such.-Making Phone Calls-Mixed feeling on this feature. It does take a few button presses to dial out on this phone.1.) You have to unlock the phone by pressing on the \"unlock key\" found on the side of the phone.2.) Use the slide feature on the touchscreen to turn the page.3.) Press the phone icon on the front of the phone to access the call menu.4.) Press the \"Dialer\" Tab5.) Use the touchscreen to input the number and FINALLY press \"Talk\" to dial out.It does seem like a lot but it's a short process once you get acquainted with the dialing procedures.The call quality is superb on both ends. The speaker phone is also great and loud.-WEB BROWSING-The second complaint I saw was the lack of decent browsing capabilities. If people would do a simple search on adding 3rd party apps to this phone they could use OperaMini(current version is 6.0) browser which does save bookmarks, usernames and passwords to sites visited.-3rd Party Apps-YES, you can add 3rd party apps to the Samsung Seek IF YOU KNOW WHAT YOU'RE DOING. Do not use the Boost Mobile Store, cause it does really suck and they're not free. Anyone can do a simple search on how to add apps. In short you have to send both JAD Files and JAR Files to your phone(via pc through usb cable or a microSD card) to install them and they will be under the Applications Tab ready to be used. I've downloaded 50+ high quality apps to my phone already and more to come!-Touchscreen-It is not really that bad, Again I think some users are just spoiled from the other phone options out there but remember you can't compare apples to oranges. It does take some time to adjust to using this type of touchscreen but its not that unbearable. One bad thing is the screen is very hard to read outside in direct sunlight.-Keyboard(Texting)-Again, it isn't so bad. The keys are bit on the tiny side and spaced close together so some users with big hands may have an issue. A big plus is the keyboard is very good to use in the dark because it is back lit. Also, there is a cool shortcut key that opens up a sub menu for emoticons. Overall I think the texting is pretty good. If you're using the phones default browser you can't send the browser to the background to start a text BUT if you use another 3rd party browser,such a OperaMini, you can easily send your web browsing to the background and start a text message.-Camera-It's a low quality camera to be honest. It's 1.3mp ,and it doesn't have image stabilization so if you have shaky hands most of your photos will come out a bit blurry if you view at full size. Very grainy in low light conditions. However, one must remember this is a PHONE first and foremost and not a full fledge point and shoot camera!-Mp3/Video-Kinda mixed feelings with the default mp3 player. The phone automatically goes into a \"lock\" mode after awhile so when you want to skip a song you have to unlock the phone first. I had trouble with the random play mode as well at times. One could use another 3rd party app for playing mp3 because I found some that are decent to use.There is NO video player by default but I have seen rumors of using a 3rd party app to play video. I have yet to do any searches for a video player so I cannot test it out.-Bluetooth-Haven't used it yet and as for tethering complaints if you read your Terms of Service when you first signed up for Boost Mobile Service there is a stipulation stating you CAN NOT use their service to tether the internet service to any other device. This is why tethering is DISABLED by default. However, a user could possibly use a hack to bypass the restriction.-Battery Life-I would say it's good. It lasts for over a day or two under heavy usage. By heavy usage I do the following: A few dozen text messages, use the web browser through out the day(probably adds up to around 2 hours total browsing), a few calls lasting a few minutes, and gaming(Java based games, anywhere from 1hr to 3hrs total). All of the preceding can be done and battery life lasts a little over a day or a bit more.-Build Quality-The phone feels a little \"cheap\" and plasticly. I've only had this phone for about two weeks so I'll have to wait and see how it holds up in the long run. I did purchase phone insurance on the Boost Mobile site for an extra $5 a month on top of the $50 per month unlimited plan. You can cancel the insurance anytime and I plan on cancelling around 6 months since I figure the depreciation value will not be a lot for a $130 phone in that amount of time.FINAL THOUGHTSIn all, for the price of the phone and the cost of Boost Mobile service with the Shrinkage plan (you must sign up for Shrinkage via the Boost site)it's a great deal! The Samsung Seek M350 is a basic phone with a couple of extra features. You can't compare this with an iPhone or Motorola i1 like some reviewers have, they're at least 3 times more expensive than the Seek! Call quality and Text messaging are excellent! Web browsing and playing music is decent. The camera isn't that good. I don't know what more one could want out of a basic phone.", "Date": "April 6, 2011"}, {"Title": "Junk", "Author": "Charles Hamilton", "ReviewID": "R5OHCK60SR0C3", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "This is NOT a \"smart phone\", it is merely a phone with extra options.The good stuff:* Slide out qwerty keyboard* Good battery life* Superb voice recognition for hands free dialing* Very loud speaker* My provider, Boostmobile, has an excellent pricing plan, and great service areaThe bad stuff:* Low bandwidth.  This is a CDMA phone so speeds are equivalent to a 56K dial-up* Camera quality is bad.  It may be a 1.3 megapixel, however with the slow shutter speed and low sensitivity cause this camera to take blurry shots every time.* The media player suffers from low fidelity playback, even when using headphone jack.* The browser will not let you change the home page. It also does not save logon cookies, or passwords* The facebook, and myspace applications are not applications.  They simply launch the web browser.* Downloading apps from 3rd party sites is disabled.  You can't save images off the web either.* As of this writing (11/24/2010) Neither Boostmobile or Sprint have made any new applications availble for purchase.* The GPS capabilities are only available thru the \"Boost Navigator\" application, which costs extra money per use, or an extra monthly fee.  You cannot delete this application from the phone.* \"Hookt Chat\" application also cost extra to use, and is impossible to delete from the phone.* Operating the phone is almost entirely done by using the touch screen, which is nearly impossible to see if you are outside on a sunny day.* Video playback is not supported.  Not even youtube* You arent allowed to assign your own MP3's as ringtones. You are expected to buy those from the so called app store.* Bluetooth tethering to other devices, (to share the internet connection), is disabled.* Bluetooth file transfers are limited to one single file at a time.* The touch screen is not capacitive, it is truly pressure sensitive.  If you are used to a droid or iphone, this screen will feel numb and unresponsive.Final Opinion:The cons severely outweigh the pros. I would not recommend this phone to anyone.", "Date": "November 24, 2010"}, {"Title": "J Hamilton nailed the review", "Author": "Jane K.", "ReviewID": "R2QLZEJXDW1F3L", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "Most features are disabled.

Not too happy with it. The sensitivity of the touch screen is horrible. I have it set to the most sensitive setting and still have to tap repeatedly til it recognizes the touch. The buttons are super small and extremely hard to press because of their material. I'm normally a fast texter and I've had other Boost phones. This one just sucks. As others have said, there is no video on this. I have the $50 unlimited everything plan and can't even utilize the internet that I'm paying extra for. The screen is so small and the words so big, that you only get a few words on the screen at a time. It takes way too much time and scrolling to be able to even read a paragraph. Images don't show up on the web for me either. It doesn't save my sign in info for Facebook, so I have to constantly sign back in...even if I just send it to the background to answer a text. After looking at about 3 pages, it will also sign out.I do get good sound and good battery life, but that is all that I consider good about this phone. It's a waste of money in my opinion and very cheaply made.", "Date": "March 12, 2011"}, {"Title": "Seeking to get Rid of Samsung Seek...", "Author": "Grace Rodriguez", "ReviewID": "R20ZMP0JEIFMLP", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I purchased the Samsung Seek for Boost Mobile.  I found it very difficult to manuver between the screen and the keyboard.  Because, the screen touching takes getting used to, one can be touching and tapping and nothing happens, just time wasted.  Also, when trying to make a call, something as logical as the dialer not coming up when needed. It is a very different kind of phone, than that I am used to.  Therefore, I found it frustrating when I needed to make calls.  Looking up things in the Menu Touch screen was confusing.  It is not very logical.  Buyer beware that once purchased there are No Returns, unfortunately.  I have to eat this product, even when I cannot use it.  I have since bought a new phone and am Seeking to get Rid of Samsung Seek.  To let you know its resale value is $30. I've been jipped, and no one cares.  Sales Associates at a local electronic store said that this phone was not made as sturdy as its counter part: Seek with Sprint Contract.  Had I known that- I would not have purchased this flip floppy Seek phone.

I however, love it.....so far. Before I get started (THIS IS NOT S SMART PHONE). It is just a touch screen phone with a slide out qwerty key pad. You can use it to text, call, email, and get online. The online is not perfect but it works. The texting is great and the calling is great. It also has a camera which is not the greatest but hell, it works. Others have said the phone feels cheap and flimsy, its a light weight phone which just makes my pocket that much lighter. I purchased a flat black snap on case with my phone which in my opinion makes it look and feel a lot more rugged which (as a mechanic) is what I look for. Phone is great for someone looking for a descent touch screen phone at a reasonable price. I love it so far. If it starts messing up, ill be sure to spread the word.Update as of 1/8/2012:This has been a great phone for me while I've had it. I recently decided to upgrade to a smart phone which is coming from the same amazon seller this Samsung seek came from. Service provider still Boost Mobile, while I have had the Seek it has been a great phone. I love the touch screen!Pros:-Touch screen-Qwerty Keyboard slides out nicely-You can check email and use facebook and get online with itCons:-Camera is there but it's not the greatest-Can not record videos-Can not watch youtube videos-Small screenI'm sure I'm leaving things out but I can't remember them all. Whatever phone you choose, I say buy from this seller. They ship fast which in my opinion is a major plus.", "Date": "October 18, 2011"}, {"Title": "good phone but flawed", "Author": "J. jones \"jmike\"", "ReviewID": "R1EGLR149YYU65", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "This is a budget phone so don't expect much. It functions pretty well as such but one major flaw I thought I should share. My holster has a magnet to hold the flap down (most do), sometimes when I inserted the phone it would become unlocked and start randomly dialing contacts. I finally narrowed it down to the top right unlock button. normally you press this button to bring up the wipe screen which you use to unlock it, when the phone passes the magnet in the holster flap, it brings up the dial menu and if you inadverently touch the screen, it will dial the contact you touched. I tried several other mobile devices and they did not respond to magnetism. This review is only to bring attention to the flaw and prevent owners and future owners from being driven nuts by random dialing and screen being unlocked when it was suppose to be locked. yes it's a budget phone but if you buy a product you have certain expectations that are basic functions to the product and should have been worked out in past production of previous models.", "Date": "January 24, 2011"}, {"Title": "everythings good except...", "Author": "G. farkus", "ReviewID": "RCDRRNG3SR9E6", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "i was alittle surprised this phone doesn't allow text signatures, the battery life is decent if you turn off alot of the extra vibrations and the extra bright screen light mine generally lasts around two and a half days from a full charge but that's on vibrate.

Pictures easy to view under \"fun settings\"Favorites: u have a favorites list for contacts, one for apps other things (i.e. internet search, re-boost)and web browserKey pad: Awesome. Difficult at first to use if you're not familiar withthis type of QWERTY keypad.Calling: A tad annoying at first, but once you have learned the process(took me a couple of times) its EASY. you can 3-way call, pause calls, and bring up a dial pad on the screen. (PRESS phone button, press DIALER,press TALK, then the phone number, then GREEN RECTANGLE.)Touchscreen: FYI the sensitivity settings can be changed so that it doesn't feel a tad laggy or unresponsive IF PEOPLE WOULD LOOK one can find it in the SETTINGS/TOOLS menu.

After using Boost cards to pay for the phone for two months I switched to the Auto Re-Boost Payment Service, wherein payments are automatically charged to my credit card each month. What a terrible mistake. Boost Mobile has been making monthly charges to my credit card at the same time that it has cut off my phone service, telling me that there is no money in my account. Of course, the latter cannot be true is the former is true. When I call Boost's service number to resolve the problem I learn that there are no human beings to speak to, only an automated list of options, none of which correspond to my problem. When I contact Boost via its online customer service (an e-mail option in which the customer is asked to describe his or her problem) I receive a phone call instructing me to call the service number, which, as I've just noted, provides no human operator and tells me that there is no money in my account. In other words, Boost Mobile tells me that to restore my service I must make another payment, even though that payment has already been made by their Auto Re-Boost plan. In effect, I must pay twice for each month of service and there is nothing I can do about it. Is this a company you would want to do business with?
