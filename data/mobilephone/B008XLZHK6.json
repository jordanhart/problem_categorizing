The device is in top notch condition, no problems what so ever. The battery door was broken but i got such a great device for such a low price, the battery door is forgotten.", "Date": "March 5, 2013"}, {"Title": "Great Back Up Phone", "Author": "Adam Terrell Payne", "ReviewID": "RTWOJ2FIU95YC", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "The Galaxy Nexus is an amazing phone.  I have yet to notice any lag zipping in and out of apps and settings.  Call quality is very good.  I haven't had any issues understanding people on the other line and they can hear me clearly.  The speed of the phone is on point with the best phones on the market today.  Android has a tendency to bog phones down but with this phone having stock Android there is no such problem.  Just about anything you can throw at this phone it can handle.  I came from a 3G device so the download speeds have blown me away.  Never have I had to wait a long time from something to download or for a web page to load.  The only issue I have with this phone is its ties with Verizon.  Even though this is a Nexus device don't expect immediate updates.  As of this writing I still do not have 4.2 JellyBean 2.  The GSM version has had it for months now.  Other than that I would recommend this phone to anyone.  Especially anyone who wants to switch from a different OS, such as iOS or Windows Phone.  This phone will also make a heck of a secondary device.", "Date": "March 4, 2013"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": null, "Features": null, "Name": null, "ImgURL": null, "ProductID": "B008XLZHK6"}}
