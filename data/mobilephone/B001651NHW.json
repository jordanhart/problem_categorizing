Has great signal strength, crystal clear phone calls, nice and handy handset bar phone. My favorite thing is the built in flashlight that's good when you need the most if your in a dark room or if the power goes out. Plus You can text, make calls and has a few built in games. I forgot to write a review, got it on amazon October 2 2013. I had the Kyocera rave K7 royale long time ago but gave it away and made a mistake, so I tried this new Kyocera k9. Virgin mobile is a good service for pay as you go. They have decent plans 20 dollar plan for 400 mins for a medium talker. Need to talk to virgin mobile to update plans or check your minutes dial *vm that's *86 and dial. Great basic phone, who needs the internet on a phone.", "Date": "December 11, 2013"}, {"Title": "really great phone", "Author": "Denise Roberts", "ReviewID": "R3DRJXFYST03NH", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Mine is eight years old and it's a way better phone than my other two.  Always picks up a good signal even in remote parts of the country.  My others would search and search for a signal in Nw Mo. I am going to buy a new battery for it and use it again.  The phone has doubled in price in eight years.
