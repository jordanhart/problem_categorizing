The resolution is marvelous, it takes very nice pictures in medium to bright light, and the fonts, program design is very attractive. You can set it to three different themes- the black/red Virgin Mobile color combo, white, or black. I use the black and it looks so amazing.The keyboard takes some getting used to, but after inputting all of my contacts from previous Wildcard phone, I am loving the keyboard layout. I love how the \"back\" key is at the right bottom corner. The keys are decent sized, easy to press, and the keys are really responsive. Plus the design looks very elegant and functional.The sound quality is also MUCH better than the Wildcard. In fact, I'd like to say that I am absolutely pleased with the earpiece sound quality and volume, and the speakerphone volume and sound clarity. I loaded a couple hundred songs onto the micro SD card, which I popped into the XTC, and playing back the music was actually very clear and pleasant, even when I playback heavy rock songs.Overall I find the XTC to be very functional, slim, well-designed, and my only fears now are my fingerprints smearing the glossy screen or accidentally dropping the phone because I've been using the phone so often.[...]", "Date": "August 19, 2009"}, {"Title": "Good looking phone with couple major flaws", "Author": "J. W.", "ReviewID": "R1BCNCAX0M6PGE", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "For prepaid phone, design is very sleek. Bigger bright LCD screen, slide-out keyboard, slim, many basic features plus more. My previous phone was Wildcard and overall it's so-so upgrade. It could've been so much better.Pros-Design. It's just sexy to look at for a prepaid phoneA slide-keyboard.Bluetooth, memopad, alarm, blah blah which are kinda standard nowadays.Way better speaker than Wildcard, for obvious reason(if you own a Wildcard you know why). Can listen to MP3 too without headphone.MP3 player supported with microSD flashcard, with \"Play, Back, Foward\" buttons on face of the phone for easy access.PS-All songs must be in 1 single folder. No sub-folders, meaning you have to manage the playlist from scratch.ETC that many already mentioned.Cons-Battery life. It lasts shorter than Wildcard, which was also a phone for heavy texter. If you call/text everyday, expect to recharge it everyday.Keyboard keypad positions. There are no gaps between the keys like other phones. This means you'll more likely to make typos. I have to use my fingernails to make precise typing.Space+Enter+Back keys=MESS. Space key clicks softer than the rest of the keys, so I'm not sure if I pressed it or not without looking at the screen. Sometimes I end up doublespacing. Enter key is on TOP of the Back key, which is opposite of the standard QWERT keyboards out there. I mean come on! I got used to it, but it's still akward.LCD screen ALWAYS auto-adjust horizontally once the keyboard is out, except when you're at the top menu. What this means is that phone has the motion censor that detects whether you're holding the phone vertically or horizontally, but goes to horizontal display whenever you move from the top menu to elsewhere with the keyboard out despite holding it vertically.Backlight turns on randomly during battery-save mode. Once the LCD screen is off after couple seconds, it will light up again for no reason and then goes to black again. I've seen it doing it couple times in the first 10-15 minutes, but not sure if it does it over and over overnight. This means it's draining more battery for no reason.Front facebuttons are small and positioned way too low. This could be due to bigger LCD screen, but it feels very uncomfortable to reach those buttons without changing the way I hold the phone. Simply look at the picture of this phone and compare to other ones out there.So there you have it. Looks good and can make calls and texts with ease, but with many flaws that could've been easily fixed.PS-I'm a very picky person so the cons I mentioned might not be the big deal to many of you.", "Date": "May 22, 2009"}, {"Title": "Had the potential to be VM's best mobile phone", "Author": "D.

My last one being the Super Slice. This phone has everything I was looking for. It's cool and mature looking [VM phones tend to look children toys], decent battery life, and a slide out keyboard for easy texting.  So where did it fail? Sound quality! It's awful. The sound coming from the ear piece is low and has tons of static. Oddly enough the person on the other side can hear you just fine.If it wasn't for that. This phone would easily be a 4 or 5. Don't recommend buying this phone unless you just want to do texting. Don't really care about the media player functions or the camera.

It does that pretty well.Pros:-Large, bright screen is easy to read.-Handset feels nice in the hand, slider mechanism is smooth and easy to operate with one hand.-Sound quality is pretty good when you can get it to play.-Ringtones are high quality and loud.-Virgin offers a \"Texter's Delight\" plan for people like me who text more than they talk - $20 a month for unlimited text, pix, instant messages and email then 10 cents a minute extra for each minute of talk time.Cons:-Pictures are exceptionally poor quality, even at the highest resolution.-Camera has no flash.-They charge you to access their store from the phone then they charge you for the stuff you download, so you're double-charged for every download.-The keyboard is difficult to operate without using your fingernails.  Nail biters, avoid this phone.-Can't set the phone to Vibrate without playing the ringtone.-No 3G coverage in Cupertino California?  What the f***?-You're going to spend a lot of time looking at the \"Error Code : CCS_E1090\" page on the Virgin Mobile website.-No Twitter.-Can't post Pix to Livejournal because any email address with a + sign in it is an \"invalid email address.\"-Email does not support attachments.-Can't use your own email address -- you have to use one from: -Yahoo -AOL -AIM -Comcast -Earthlink -NetZero -Juno -[...]-Every time you get an email, instead of just telling you that you have an email, the phone says \"Mobile Email wants to start\" and makes you load the Java email applet before you can see who the message is from.-The \"Erase Messages - All\" menu option does not delete messages from the Virgin Alerts folder.  In fact you can't delete the Virgin Alerts at all, so it's possible that all of your phone's memory could be taken up by Virgin Alerts if you have your phone for a few years.-You can't just send a text message--  You have to go to Menu -> Messaging -> Send Text Message to send it, then when you're done you have to hit Back twice or End to go back to the main screen.Instant Messaging:-Uses Java for instant messaging.-Takes about 15 seconds to load.-Only supports AIM and Yahoo.-The interface is different from everything else on the phone.-You can exit the Instant Messaging app and do other things but every time you get an IM you have to wait another 15 seconds for the application to load.-You can't get phone calls while you're in the Instant Messaging app.  It won't even tell you a call is coming in.Pix:-It says on the box that there is Facebook integration, but what it means is you can \"Pix Mail\" pictures to Facebook.-No Livejournal support.Media Player:This is not a music phone.  If you're looking for an all-in-one device that will replace your iPod, look elsewhere.-MP3 player struggles with MP3s encoded at higher than 128kbps.  Stops and starts a few times, then gives up and skips to the next song.-Can't handle folders on the MicroSD card.  All your MP3s have to be in the same folder, My Music, or it won't find them.-The phone takes a long time between when you insert the card and when it finds songs on it.-You need one of those proprietary 2.5mm to 3.5mm connectors to use headphones on a phone that touts playing music as one of its primary features.-Media Player is, in general, clunky and difficult to use.-Media player auto-starts and begins playing music over the speakerphone anytime you insert a MicroSD card with music on it.-You're supposed to be able to play a playlist by holding the Call key and then saying \"Play [playlist]\" but you actually have to say \"play\" and then wait for it to ask you for the playlist name, then say the playlist name, then confirm it by saying \"yes.\"  Otherwise it takes you to \"shortcuts.\"  This actually takes longer than using the buttons on the phone.-You can't just add all of your songs to a playlist, you have to check them off one at a time and then confirm.-The phone couldn't read about half of the song titles in my test MP3 album even though they had no special characters.-The voice recognition gives prompts using the phone speaker so you have to hold it to your ear to hear the prompts, but the music plays over the speakerphone, so you have to quickly confirm the command and then remove the phone from your ear to keep from having music blasted in your ear.The Virgin Mobile website:-Virgin's website is a thrown together mess of third-party services with Virgin logos slapped on.-You have to type your phone number and vkey every time you navigate to a new area of the website.-Many features (such as Contact Vault for backing up contacts on your phone) error out and don't work at all.-On some sections of the website it tells you that your login was incorrect several times before letting you log in, even when it wasn't incorrect.-The ringtones website is garbage and has misplaced text everywhere.", "Date": "May 25, 2010"}, {"Title": "Phone is good, Virgin Mobile not so much", "Author": "R. Moore", "ReviewID": "R15GRRXQLVODLO", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "The Kyocera X-tc functions as advertised, a good phone in general.  The graphics on screen are a bit primitive, but this is not a high-end phone.Although the phone has a USB connection and you can buy USB cables, the device drivers to allow the phone to connect to your computer are not available.  The USB connection can be used to charge the phone's battery, but not to exchange data.Virgin Mobile is terrible:  - When we activated the phone with a phone card, Virgin Mobile's website acknowledged the card but then lost the information.  Virgin Mobile's representative said that their website was \"having problems\", but that they could not restore the lost minutes.  However, the phone card was still counted as having been used.  - If you associate a credit card with your account for top-up purposes, then Virgin Mobile is very reluctant to let you take the credit card off the account.  You are trapped with them having your credit card information, even if you tell them to remove it.  - Do not leave any unused cash balance (top-up) on your account.  Use all cash balance immediately.  Virgin Mobile permits third-party vendors to charge your account--presumably with your permission, but in practice whenever it pleases the third party vendor--and Virgin Mobile disavows all responsibility for the transaction.  If you have a positive balance, then you are fair game for a third-party vendor to \"activate\" a service without your permission and claim your balance.  Virgin Mobile will not assist you.", "Date": "January 30, 2010"}, {"Title": "Ex-Tracfone user, loves this new X-tc", "Author": "E. Blair", "ReviewID": "R3GUETP7CJ65CT", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "After several years with Tracfone, I finally decided to jump ships when I saw this phone being offered by Virgin Mobile with pay-as-you-go service.Tracfone's limited phone choices really are pathetic, by comparison, and the relative cost of ownership, once I started to look more closely, was much higher.That said, I got the X-tc and fell in love with it immediately. The feature set is excellent, the phone sound quality is fine, the keys may be cramped but heck, it's a tiny little package and feels pretty solid. In fact, the only reason why I give it a 4 rather than a 5 is that it doesn't feel *really* solid when you open out the keyboard - there's a bit of \"rocking\" that gives it a slightly fragile feel.Otherwise, given the price, it does all those neat things you'd want from a phone like this, including music ringtones by caller, music ringback by caller, automatic switching between portrait and landscape when you turn the phone around, etc. etc. - take a look at the spec sheet, it's a mile long.In fact, it has so many features, I still get lost a bit in the menus - which I would say is another shortcoming that keeps this product from getting a 5 from me - the menu hierarchy is deep and sometimes difficult for this AARP member to remember.Now, as far as Virgin Mobile customer service is concerned: don't listen to those who are too impatient to deal. The fact is, if you're calm and deal with them with the respect you'd expect them to give you, they're as good as their JD Power rating implies. I had a bit of trouble getting my phone to activate following the instructions on the web site; I called, waited a few minutes, got a fellow who knew the script and got me through the process, and, as I said: mutual respect goes a long way to making these conversations a lot more pleasant than if you go and yell at them that they have no clue. (Being able to describe the problem well also helps - these CRM folk are just reading from menus and scripts, and being able to give them the right words to search for an answer helps a lot.)VM's customer service gets a 5 from me :)*******Edit/follow-up: I don't know why others are having a hard time with the battery, but mine has been performing to spec: about 3 hours talk time, 200 hours standby.

People are saying that the sound quality and volume is low. I totally disagree. The volume is loud as well as the speaker volume and it's loud when you use the bluetooth. If the earpiece is low then use the speakerphone or a bluetooth headset. I use a Kyocera Bluetooth headset for this phone. My only drawbacks for this phone is the battery life is short when you are surfing the internet and the keys are slightly cramped. The keys are not no more cramped than the Blackberry Pearl and the sound qulaity is 3 times louder than the Blackberry Pearl. I feel that for the price this phone does exactly what it should do.I enjoy checking my emails, my Facebook account and there's also Twitter. The Washington Post, ABC, CNN, CNBC, New York Times and LA Times is on this phone. You can easily access Craigslist and Amazon.Com. The Opera Mini web browser makes the speed fast. Some people are saying that it's not but I guess it depends on where you live. You should go to Virgin Mobiles website and check the coverage are to make sure you'll get the coverage you need. I think everyone looking for an affordable phone should at least try it before making a decision. Don't compare this phone to an Iphone because that it is not, but right now I'm glad I invested this money for this little item.

This phone doesn't have EVDO speeds or the ability to record 30 second video clips like the VM Shuttle, but it does have a slide out key keyboard and a larger display. Both of these come in handy when texting or surfing the web. Sound from the speakerphone and wired headset is loud and clear, but earpiece quality is the biggest disappointment of this phone. The incoming volume is too low and scratchy. Surprisingly, outgoing voice quality is just fine. Another minor gripe is that the GUI is a bit sluggish resulting in half second lags whenever a key action is performed.

It runs well with Opera Mini 4.2 in the internet.  It is not 3G, but fast enough.The MP3 player works good.  You need a micro-SD card to load the audio from your computer and then into the phone. It gets automatically sorted by album, artist and genre.  You can then create your own playlists.  The sound comes out nice and clear both through the earbuds or the speaker on the phone.The Qwerty keyboard is small, but easy to use with the tips of your fingers.A listing of all recent calls can be brought up, without sliding open the Qwerty keyboard, by pressing the \"OK\" center button and then choosing the option \"Recent\" on the bottom left of the front vertical screen.To dial directly from the alpha-numeric keypad you have two options.  One, hold the phone in a vertical position and open the qwerty keyboard to the right to dial using the number pad that appears to your right.  Two, hold the phone in a vertical position and bring up to the screen the virtual numeric keypad by pressing the center \"OK\" button. You'll have to surf up, down and sideways and then select each number with the \"OK\" key.  A little complicated this last option.  However, since most calls are dialed from memory (contacts, calls received, calls missed, calls dialed) in the final count this \"con\" is not a big deal.You can bring up the Contact List by pressing any letter from the alpha-numeric keypad you have pulled out on your right and scroll the names under the letters contained in the key chosen.The Menu style \"Grid\" that comes as default, does not show all the menu options. The \"List\" view does. To change the default, go to Tools & Settings, Display, Menu Style, and choose \"List\".I get very good connection with this phone, calls are loud and clear.The camera is OK, pictures are not HD, but good enough.Voice recording for memos is very useful as well as the alarms.  Its bluetooth feature comes in very handy when driving.  For safety reasons, keep the bluetooth feature off when not in use.  This will prevent hackers from accesing your phone.The X-TC is the only Qwerty keyboard cell phone that works with both, the Virgin Mobile \"Pay as you Go\" plan and any of the \"Monthly\" plans they offer.  All the other cell phones VM offers with Qwerty keyboard can only be used with a \"Monthly\" plan.It is a very nice, sturdy phone.

This is the 4th Virgin Mobile phone I have bought in 3 years and this buy far is the worst.  What makes it worse is that the other 3 phones I have bought were less than 40 bucks each.  This phone has been nothing but a nightmare since I got it. I have listed just a few of the problems:1) I have had the phone for 5 months now and the battery is almost completly worthless.  It has to be charged every 10 hours and a 20 minute phone call just about drains it from fully charged.2)  Once a day, at least, when I open slide the phone closed it resets.3)  Once every other day or so the phone freezes like a old PC computer.  I have to take the battery out and put it back in to reset the phone.4) I have used 2 different text tones since I got the phone.  However, the phone just seems to chose whichever one it wants to use.  There is no ryhme or reason to it.5) Of the 4 Virgin Mobile phones I have bought this one gets the worst coverage.  Not only talking but sending and recieving text messages.These are just a handful of the problems I have had in 5 months.

I absolutely LOVE this phone. Finally, a VM phone, that doesn't LOOK like a vm phone. You can even buy snap on cases for it which I did and they work great, and then the phone can be any color you want. I was debating on this or the shuttle...my last phone was a slider sonic, which I LOVED, but it finally died on me (after 2 yrs). I wanted the shuttle bc of how much I loved the slider sonic...but chose the xtc bc of the keyboard...I do not text much but am tired of having to be annoyed by texts people send me...they would write a long text and I would answer in 2-3 words. Now I dont mind texting back at all. To me, the keyboard is easy to use. The one thing I miss is the video recording option...the shuttle does have this...I liked being able to take a short video of my kids, and put it on my computer w/o having to either email it to myseldf or \"upload\" to VM. I do carry around my camera all the time, and so just use that more, so it wasn't REALLY a big issue for me, and it having the keyboard makes up for it. I don't think I could go back to a phone w/o a keyboard, and I am 40 yrs old not a teenager, and its only been 2 weeks. But, I do, kinda miss not being able to record video, but not enough to get the shuttle over this. I am NOT a heavy texter by any means, but its hreat to have when I want it. I love being able to put MY music on it...thats why I kept my slider sonic for so long, it used to be the ONLY vm music phone. Buy a cord and listen to it over your car stereo, and if it rings the music will stop and the phone rings. I have never used bluetooth, but my regular headphones (had to buy an adaptor at radio shack 3.5mm to 2.5 mm I think, but I had it 2 yrs you need it to use regular headphones on ANY phone) work just fine too, to listen to music. A great phone, overall, if you are used to pay-as-you-go phones, it is THE BEST!!!
