{"Reviews": [{"Title": "From Optimus V unrooted user", "Author": "J. W.", "ReviewID": "RUZDWXUQ9B92M", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Pros1.Bigger screen-More noticeable than I expected, since it's only .3 inch larger on paper. Typing is slightly better, but still difficult in portrait mode. Feels more colorful and vibrant, but that could be just me(maybe I'm under \"my phone's new wohoo\" hallucination mode). Resolution is same as V.2.Better processor/OS-200Mhz higher and gingerbread 2.3(OV is 2.2). Lot less lags in apps.  Can handle desktop websites better(with some lags) with flash(Wifi recommended). Autoswitching between landscape and portrait is lot faster than V, so I actually turned it on unlike V. Big improvement in video playback. I didn't need to download additional codecs to play unconverted videos.3.Flash support-Phone's not powerful enough to handle big sites like dailyshow/colbert/etc in high resolutions(frozen video with audios only), but it managed to handle South Park, videogame sites, etc. Recommended on Wifi connection only.4.Slimmer design-Expected it to be no big deal for me, but once I held it I can definitely feel the slimness of it compare to V.5.Better camera-5 megapixel vs 3, with LED flash support. Flash is bright enough to take good pictures in dark settings(in-doors anyway), and camera autofocuses during the camera mode(or you can focus manually by touching the screen). V autofocused after pressing the shutter button, so Elite takes pictures 3~ times faster. It's almost instantaneous. Also has micro mirror for self-portrait.6.Bigger storage for apps- 900mb~ solely for apps. Even more space if you move your apps(apps that support app2SD).7.Better/louder sound-Sound is coming out of the speaker where you listen in phone conversation(I don't know what it's called. Earspeaker?). It's louder, and more importantly(for me anyway), you can listen to music while the phone is facing up. OV's sound output was on the rear side, so often times, I either put V facedown or leaned it somewhere to hear it in full volume. No more with Elite.8.GPS-Locates me faster than V. Google Map is way smoother than V.9.Supports more 3D games-They're on PlayStore. Haven't tested them since I don't care for them, but they're there unlike V.10.Faster MicroSD speed-Loads up pictures and videos way faster than V.11.NFC support-Paypass creditcard. It might come in handy if I forget my wallet at home, but not many stores actually have Paypass. I've seen some at Mcdonald and gas stations.Cons1.Shorter battery life-This may be YMMV, possibly depending on what apps you downloaded. I'm using mostly the same apps I used on V, and battery life seems 1.5/2 times worse on Elite. Without JuiceDefender, Elite sucks up 3-6% per hour during standby. V usually used up 10~% per hour with 3g/wifi, while Elite is using 15-20% per hour. Now I'm using Elite with JD, and everything turned off(even location data and background data).2.No tethering. Don't download any tethering apps/widgets. There have been reports that phone will give permanent data error, forcing users to reset the phone via Virgin Mobile customer service. V supported apps like Foxfi(which I will miss since I comboed it with my tablet).3.Volume buttons-Twice smaller than V, and they're on opposite side. Hard to get used to.4.3G doesn't reconnect as fast as V, making JuiceDefender little annoying to use. Maybe I wasn't getting good reception. YMMV.Neutrals1.Speedtest-No noticeable difference. Typical Sprint speed. YMMV.2.Physical design-Rear battery cover is plastic(V was rubberish), making it bit slippery to hold onto from time to time. This combined with front touch buttons(V was physical buttons), occasionally I end up touching the front buttons by accident. YMMV. Also, no dedicated camera button. Tiny mirror next to camera lense makes it easier for selfportrait picture, but no dedicated camera button found on V kind of cancels the mirror benefit.3.Haven't found a way to turn off shutter sound while taking pictures. Silent mode/media volume won't do anything, so this is bad for those who want to take pictures without alerting others.Final thoughtsFeels and performs like higher-end phone compare to V, right down to worse battery life. I honestly can't recommend it to all Virgin Mobile users though because everyone's in different situation. There are those who want to keep $25 grandfathered plan(which this phone doesn't qualify anymore). There will be HTC Evo V/3D shortly, which has twice better specs at twice the cost. Sprint 4G/Wimax doesn't have good coverage for those who are interested in upgrading to HTC Evo/$35 a month plan.PS-English is my second language so go easy on the grammar please.

Activation was simple and quick (I did NOT port a number, just got a new one).Comparing to my previous phone, a Motorola Droid (original) -The good -- This phone is MUCH faster, you can tell when it's responding to opening programs, obtaining GPS navigation directions, really in every aspect- The phone's speaker (speaker phone) offers amazing clarity for what it is.- Since the speaker/speakerphone is so loud when it's turned all the way up, it makes for a better alarm than the Droid- The web (at least for me) is really quick to open, load - show search results, overall very pleased with browsing on this- Voice dictation/recognition works AWESOME - I'd say even a bit better than the Moto Droid, which was really great with this- The Battery seems to last longer, at least right now.  Even after messing with the phone, apps, downloads, etc. for about an hour the battery was still near full.- The phone's VERY light - would could actually be a bad thing (I could picture myself dropping it a little easier)Not so good -- The texting portion is a bit harder on this than on the Moto Droid - there are some minor things, but - it's also noted that most of these inconveniences will be overcome by using the phone more and getting more accustomed to it.  (For example on the Droid, exclamation mark, question mark, period, comma, etc - would be offered after every 'space' in case you wanted to end a sentence.. This phone requires me to press and hold on one of the letters to get the same result).  Not a huge deal, just slows me down a bit.ANOTHER IMPORTANT NOTE - When I was activating this phone w/Virgin Mobile, I was offered insurance on the phone for $5 a month.  They also mentioned the deductible would be 25 dollars, and I could redeem this twice a year.  I am noting this because it's CHEAPER than listed some places regarding Virgin mobile's insurance.For the price of the phone, and the plan - $50.00 a month for 1200 talk minutes, unlimited data and unlimited text - it's hard to feel 'taken' - it's a great feeling stepping away from the huge corporate \"V\".", "Date": "May 31, 2012"}, {"Title": "Nice upgrade from the Optimus V", "Author": "Mogelijk", "ReviewID": "RJATWYC4QLKSU", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This so far seems to be a very solid phone. It has several advantages over the Optimus V including Android 2.3 rather than 2.2 on the Optimus V, more memory, a slightly larger screen (3.5\" vs. 3.2\") and a faster processor.In terms of memory, the phone comes with roughly 900 MB of main memory that is free (compared to about 150 MB on the Optimus V). Additionally, about 2 GB of memory is in a separate \"partition\" that can be treated as if it is an SD card, including moving apps to it. While the phone does not come with a microSD card, there is a microSD card slot inside the back cover that can be used for even more storage.While the specs for the phone report it is an 800 MHz processor, reports on the Internet (which I confirmed with my phone using Quadrant) is that currently the phone is shipping with a processor speed of 1 GHz, a nice upgrade.In terms of connectivity, the phone seems to compare well with the Optimus V, receiving strong cell and data signals, as well as the GPS finding satellites quickly.For the price, this phone is tough to beat; though those wanting a high end phone from Virgin Mobile will want the Evo 4G.", "Date": "May 24, 2012"}, {"Title": "Very satisfied!", "Author": "Raheen", "ReviewID": "R1RGFSGWD8Z6AP", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I wanna start by saying this is a great phone to have. Its affordable plus Virgin's plans are great. I recently just canceled my contract with sprint to save money. I had the HTC evo 3d, which was a great high-end phone. I was afraid to go to this phone from that one, but I made the switch. It definitely wasn't that much of a downgrade at all. Well the main apparent sacrifice was the screen size. The evo 3d's screen size is 4.3, this one is 3.5. However, this phone has a brighter, more vibrant screen, and the colors are also better. I know this. I had the evo 3d for almost a year. This is lightweight and quite thin. I like it alot and I'm happy I got it. The camera is also pretty good too. It shoots fast! Its very good for people who have shaky hands or are taking pics of moving targets. And the flash is another great  plus. Overall, I'm very satisfied with it and I'm not sad about coming from the evo 3d to this.", "Date": "June 6, 2012"}, {"Title": "Fantastic upgrade from the Optimus V", "Author": "K. Burke", "ReviewID": "R37G2RB9K6CTMJ", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "My wife had the Optimus V and constantly complained about running out of space. That phone only has 150mb of user space, this one has about a gig (4 GB total, 1 GB user accessible). One less complaint I will be hearing...I am very impressed with this handset. As others have noted it actually has a 1 Ghz Snapdragon type processor, not the 800 mhz listed, along with 512mb of RAM. It is very fast and smooth in operation. Running Android 2.3.7 helps enormously (a huge upgrade from the Froyo previous Optimus Vs were running). Not worried about whether ICS is coming to it, Gingerbread does the job just fine.The wifi receiver seems very fast, and the GPS (a real GPS, BTW) acquired a lock and fix almost immediately.Screen size is 3.5\", which doesn't sound like much of an improvement over the 3.2\" of the Optimus V until you put them side by side. The Elite's screen is *much* easier to type on. It's the same size as an Iphone (it actually looks alot like one...)I have been toting around a Droid X for a year and a half yolked to Verizon. I am starting to think that the wife just got me beat...I'd highly recommend this one to anyone looking for a decent Android phone and who is trying to avoid the ridiculous costs of a contract with the big carriers. For $150 up front and between $35 and $55 a month you get the full experience.VM is going to make alot of money off of these, I think.EDIT: One week later, and the OE has lost a star. I had to return the first unit because some malfunction was killing the battery FAST. It would die in less than 6 hours. I have been using Androids for a couple of years and know all the tricks, couldn't get the first one to settle in. Took it back and exchanged it for another one, and after some fiddling I have the battery sipping juice. The replacement unit has been acting a bit quirky too (one random reboot, some strange stuff involving the Wifi reciever and call/messaging lags, which toggling Airplane mode seems to fix fine) but I *think* I have it running fine now... And when it's running fine it's still a 5 star phone for the price.I docked it a star because the first one was a lemon and the second one has been acting funny, but seems tight as of now. I can't give something with that record 5 stars. Still, this is an impressive phone for the price tag. I'd still upgrade to it from the OV, it is just that much better a phone. I would say that with the issues I have had, though, someone with little knowledge of the Android OS or inclination to play around with the settings (like my wife) might have a hard time with this phone. It is finicky, but when calibrated right it runs like a champ.Just be ready to send it back or exchange it, because it seems this initial batch obviously has some defective units floating around. Amazon has a great return policy, so I wouldn't worry about it.EDIT 2: A few weeks later and the OE is running like a champ. It is sipping battery after a couple of changes (Airplane mode resets a couple of times, mostly) and running smooth and fast. Wife is getting home with 40% battery after 12 hrs continuous no charging, not bad for a small, thin phone. Now Otterbox just needs to make a case for it...The wife is very happy with it compared to the OV. VM is finally starting to get some really good phones out there.", "Date": "June 17, 2012"}, {"Title": "Pleasently surprised with my BB replacement", "Author": "USGezr", "ReviewID": "R1M1NMTY183IOR", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "After scouting numerous smartphones being offered from the big names as well as prepaid, I opted to go for the LG Optimus Elite because of the positive reviews on this site as well as a few others. Admittedly I was a little skeptical about Virgin Mobile's capabilities but after using another provider who was a complete nightmare for 2 years and finding out that Virgin uses the Sprint network, I figured it was worth a leap of faith.Setup:The activation process was extremely simple. From the time I unboxed the phone to making my first call was less than 15 minutes. I did the activation online so I can't make a judgement about the manual setup process.Initial quality:This phone looks and feels like other phones I looked at that cost 100-150 more. The quality of the plastic is very good, it feels comfortable in your hand for extended periods and the 3.5\" touchscreen is clear, sharp and accurate. Aesthetically, the phone looks simple but well put together.Performance:Having never used the Android OS before, I really didn't know what to expect but within an hour I had the basics down and in a week I was operating the phone to its full capabilities. I had no lockups, no lag, no crashes or stalls. The phone managed to keep pace with everything I threw at it. The phone has Android 2.3.7 Gingerbread which is considered a very stable build and I can see why. The phone isn't considered one of the fastest phones but it kept pace with my needs. Plus there's a small secret with this phone. Officially the CPU is rated at 800Mhz but after looking at a review on YT and testing my own phone, the CPU actually runs at 1GHz. Why LG did this? I don't know but I'll take free upgrades all day.Issues:Bloatware. Virgin has a lot of apps installed that are worthless. They don't even find their own network to do anything when connected to WiFi. After I activated my phone, I uninstalled them with no loss of capability.I have to question the 5MP camera. The picture is ok but not 5MP. Even at the highest setting, the picture is grainy. The camcorder quality is very good though which is strange.WiFi is fussy and disconnects from a close hot spot with a good signal to a more distant hot spot with barely any signal strength. I suspect this might be a software glitch though.Keyboard in portrait mode is barely usable for me with my gorilla hands but surprisingly the speech to text software is amazingly accurate which really helps.Last thoughts.I transitioned from being an staunch blackberry supporter to an Android user. I expected a lot of pain but it didn't happen. The learning curve to use the phone wasn't steep courtesy of a good operating system and a phone that is stable and quick. I now understand why this is the future of the smartphone and I have absolutely no idea why anyone would even consider a horrendously overpriced and less capable iPhone. I'm glad I did this and there's no doubt the phone's quality and stability has made my choice a permanent one. I recommend this phone and Virgin mobiles network. 4 stars.", "Date": "July 6, 2012"}, {"Title": "Best budget phone ever!", "Author": "dherringtx", "ReviewID": "R1KKC7TB6BIF2D", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I owned the Lg Optimus V and loved it for a year and then upgraded to the Motorola Triumph.  I liked the Triumph alot but I had some minor problems with it shutting down unexpectedly even though the battery was charged.  Needless to say,  I returned it and the store did not have another Triumph in stock that day.  I went ahead and bought the LG Optimus Elite since I wanted a phone immediately and I had had great experience with LG.  As soon as I tried out the LG Optimus Elite I LOVED IT!!!!  It was super smooth & fast!  It also resembles the iphone alot.  My friend saw it on the table and asked if I had switched from Android to Apple!  I said nope, it's my new awesome phone!! I am sooooo happy the Triumph gave me problems or else I would have not tried the LG Optimus Elite!  I am very happy with this phone!", "Date": "May 29, 2012"}, {"Title": "Wow!", "Author": "Kellie", "ReviewID": "R5LJ503EPVL4D", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "About a year and a half ago I was able to get an Android without a contract.  It was the Samsung Intercept, also through Virgin Mobile, and it was not a good experience.  I rode it out as long as humanly possible but I could not depend on the phone to get a text or a call, and the last missed call from the school nurse told me it was time for a new phone.  (Not literally a missed call, but you can't get a call if the phone won't turn on.)  This time I wanted to be sure I got a phone that worked without spending many hundreds of dollars, so I did a lot of research.  I looked into different no-contract plans and phones and I finally decided to stay with Virgin Mobile.  They aren't great but neither are the options, we've talked to a few, and my daughter has Boost...they are the same, to me, as Virgin Mobile. I decided to give this phone a shot.  I am so glad I did.I have only had this phone a short time but I am very impressed.  I charged and activated my phone.  Since I already had an Android, I signed in to Google and with that came my contacts, calendar, and the Play store with all my apps.  I went down the list, loaded the ones I wanted to keep, picked a few new ones, and the downloading began.  They came across so quickly I was sure there were some missing, but there were not.  The screen was crystal clear and responded perfectly.  I organized my apps on to my pages and played with the phone for days.  I tried streaming music with I Heart Radio and my Amazon MP3 music.  I tried out a personal assistant app with voice recognition.  I went through live wallpapers.  I played games.  All worked smoothly, no delays, not a peep of complaints about memory.  Some things I took off, but the majority stayed.  I love some of the widgets.  SoundHound is my favorite because I hate not knowing what the new song playing is...now I know!The Android keyboard is fine, I have big fingers and little frustration.  The fun is the Swype keyboard, where you touch the first letter but then don't pick your finger up until you finish tracing the word.  It works so much better than I thought it would and I actually prefer it.  The voice recognition is better than I thought, though I would like to see it do a little more.Overall this phone is easy on the wallet, easy to use, a pleasure to own, and a nice example of an Android.  If you are in the market for this type of phone, I don't think you'd be disappointed with the Elite.Update:It is nine months later.  I still love this phone.  I talk, take pictures, text, play games, use other apps.  I use it as my alarm clock plugged in by my bed five days a week.  I use the GPS feature.  I had a basic case and screen protector on it, dropped it without knowing it, and dragged it under my shopping cart for a bit.  It has a small scratch on the edge of the phone, nothing else wrong.  It never locks up on me, works quickly even loaded with apps and photos, and has been very dependable.  The only complaint I have is the battery life.  It will last maybe half the day, depending on how much you use it.  Even without using it, just having it with me, it will not last the whole day.  This hasn't been a problem and I have enough places to plug it in so that it doesn't die, but for somebody who depends on battery life and does not have the opportunity to plug in, this phone will fall a little short.  We are going to Disney soon and I will be getting a portable battery to charge my phone during the day, but I do know my phone will still get me though!", "Date": "June 9, 2012"}, {"Title": "Amazing Phone for the price!", "Author": "vik", "ReviewID": "R9RPPODDKSE7H", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I was a little hesitant to buy this phone at first.  It was on-sale so I took a leap of faith.I was shocked how good this phone is. This is far and away the best android phone I have used on Virgin Mobile.  If I didnt tell you it was an 800Mhz CPU you would think it was a much higher end phone.  Its a true example of how the numbers mean nothing.  The phone never lags under any circumstances. Its quick and snappy.The internal storage is a total of just under 3gb.  This is a huge upgrade to the 120mb of phone memory on the optimus V.  For another 20 bucks you can add a 32gb sd card.Storage isnt an issue.The screen is noticeably larger and seems to have more color depth.The phone itself is extremely thin.  If the 4 keys on the bottom were not there you would think you were looking at an Ipod touch.  Its much much thinner then the Iphone.The video I have taken is extremely clear with zero jidders.  The pictures are great too.Currently this phone is $129-$149.00 and its worth every penny.If you currently have an Optumus V and are looking for a under $150.00 upgrade - Look no further.This phone also supports adobe flash and NFC payments.

Vaughn \"Jennifer Vaughn\"", "ReviewID": "R27EJNE78K9F31", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "After two months of light use, my phone will not turn on completely. When I press the power button, it does that little buzzing vibration like it always did when starting up. The LG logo appears, and after a few moments the Virgin mobile screen (with song) pops up, then a moment later it says \"Powering Off\" and turns off without having loaded/started up at all. Or sometimes the Virgin Mobile screen with song gets cut off and it just turns off immediately.Since it is after 30 days, I can't return it. It appears I have to use the warranty, pay for shipping, and send it in for repair.Even when it worked properly, it takes a long time to start up and be ready for use.My wife has had the same phone for 3 months, and sometimes hers is glitchy. Like when pressing the icon for one app it starts up something different, and can only be fixed by turning the phone off and back on.UPDATE:I contacted Amazon customer service & they were prompt and helpful in replacing the defective phone.But I also discovered that the phone battery was completely drained & would not accept a charge when plugged in ...UNTIL removing the battery, waiting 30 seconds, and putting it back in. It must have reset itself because it finally charged up again.The paper manual has no trouble shooting tips, but you can find tips like this on the Amazon reviews & the Virgin Mobile reviews for this phone.I also discovered by trial & error, that uninstalling & reinstalling some apps (like Netflix) will fix them...but that's a pain.Also there is a loud, annoying song that plays everytime you turn the phone on. Virgin Mobile customer service said it can't be removed. So I've had to develop the habit of putting the phone on silent mode before turning it off, to avoid hearing that song again upon start up.This is my first smartphone, and it's been really handy, but there are some more annoyances. Like when typing, the auto suggest will often replace properly spelled words with other words, making me sound like an idiot on my posts & emails. I have to spend time proof reading everything. It's a pain. And on the keypad, the English/Spanish button is situated in a place where it is always getting brushed by my thumb, so my words end up getting translated to Spanish, and I have to waste time correcting them one by one.The voice recognition is sometimes nice, but often inserts words that are completely wrong so I again have to waste time correcting mistakes.", "Date": "October 7, 2012"}, {"Title": "Not the latest/greatest but a solid budget phone.", "Author": "V. Lockwood", "ReviewID": "RCVJSJXBRNUXU", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I've been using this phone for about 2 weeks now and I really like it considering what I paid.  My previous carrier was ATT, so I wasn't sure what to expect with the Sprint coverage in my area, but it has been good.  I'm on the Virgin Mobile Beyond Talk plan with unlimited text and 3g data (data possibly throttled after 2.5 gigs), and so far I'm happy with it.  Regarding the phone, there is a lot to like about it, starting with the exterior:  This phone is comparable in size, weight and thickness to an iphone 4, fits very nice in the hand or back pocket.  It has a 3.5 inch Corning\u00ae Gorilla\u00ae Glass Screen.  The pixel count is very similar to my iphone 3, not razor sharp like retina but I wouldn't expect it to be.  It has a rounded, textured back, which comes off to give you access to the SD slot and battery.Onto the operation of the device itself:  This uses an older version of Android, 2.3.7, which is an updated version of Gingerbread.  It also has an 800 Mhz processor, which is definitely not cutting edge.  These things might keep some people  away, but keep in mind, you can upgrade the launcher to give you ICS type features (ADW is what I use), and add a weather widget and you have a nice looking and user friendly setup.  If you are concerned about not being able to play the latest 1st person shooter games, you will probably be disappointed...this will probably not play them.  If however you are looking to play the occasional game with simple graphics, then this can handle it.  Also, the speed is not really that bad.  For example, when I'm in the Google play store looking at apps, and I click on the YouTube video, (Google switches from the Store to the YouTube player and starts playing the video) there is only about a 3 second wait between the time you click and the time the video starts playing, and plays without hiccups.  I think that's pretty good for a phone in this price range.  Also the camera for this price range is better than most: 5 MP camera with flash.  The speaker volume is good.  Other things to note: bluetooth version 4.6 and NFC are rare on a phone in this range.The battery is 1520 mAh.  (Considering that the Samsung Galaxy S II with 4g, 1.2 Ghz processor, 4.52 inch screen only has a 1800 mAh battery, I would say the 1520 in this is pretty good. :)  Couple that 1520 mAh battery with the 3.5 screen and 800 Mhz processor and you have a phone that can go all day and into the night without a charge if you follow my tips below.It will take a 32 GB memory card for music and such, and you can actually store programs on it using free software such as App Mgr III (App 2 SD).  You can't move programs that use the system or use widgets, such as 3rd party launchers or a weather widget, but most games, web browsers, reader software, etc. work fine from the SD card.  This is different from a Samsung that I tried a few months ago that would only let me put music and pictures on the SD card.All in all, I am very happy with this phone, with the Sprint coverage I am getting and with the money I am saving over ATT!Tips:  To save battery life, system memory and data usage, I go in and look at the settings for each software I download to see of they have a setting for automatic updating (stuff like Flipboard, my weather apps, email, and Pulse) and turned off the auto updates.  I also turned off automatic updating of my software thru the Google Play store.  This will save data/battery usage, plus I like to wait a few days before updating software to see if people are having problems with it.I advise you to download a good task killer, because there are some things that, when you stop using them, stay in resident memory even though they really don't need to.  That's not a big concern if the phone has a lot of operating RAM but this device only has 512 MB.  Most phones have at least 1 GB now, with some having 2 GB or more.  After you run the task killer, the software that NEEDS to be in resident memory (or apps that ASSUME you WANT them to) will restart, which in the case of the necessary things, is a GOOD thing.  There is a task killer widget built into TrustGo Security app (price: FREE), and it works well enough, and TrustGo will also give you some options to scan for malicious software, which is another item I highly recommend.Another free app I downloaded is Easy Task Killer Advanced.  It is a good task killer, plus it has a free battery widget (Easy Battery Saver) you can add to it.  The battery widget can optimize your battery usage in smart ways.  It has night time settings and other options, such as even turning off the data, wifi, etc. when the screen is off.  I have tested this and yes it works, so when the phone is in my back pocket it is just barely using battery.  Great software that I would pay for, but yes it's free.  :)I also downloaded a free app called Power Toggles.  With it I can create widget toolbars of switches and toggles.  The one I created has the following toggles: turn the camera flash off/on (for use as a flashlight), 3g data off/on, airplane mode off/on, bluetooth off/on, GPS off/on, wifi off/on, as well as two shortcuts...one to a screen dimmer that I downloaded and one to a little app that turns off background data syncing with Google.  Very handy for keeping my phone set up to use as little battery power as possible, such as game playing were I don't need any wifi or data at all.I keep the data off when I'm at home and have it set up to use wifi instead of data if there's wifi nearby that I've logged into in the past.  This will save a lot on battery usage if you are in an area where 3g might be spotty and the phone is using lots of battery power searching for a 3g data signal, plus will help keep you from getting to the 2.5 gig throttling stage.  The only caveat is that you have to turn 3g on if someone is texting you an MMS (picture, etc), but SMS (text only) does not need the 3g data.Okay that's all I have for now.  I'm new to Android, but I'm enjoying learning about how to work with it and optimize things.  If I find out more, I will add them to this review.  I hope you enjoyed and learned some new things.  :)", "Date": "April 14, 2013"}, {"Title": "Slim and fast", "Author": "M.

I don't stream music, play huge battery-sucker games like Angry Birds, or keep it plugged in all the time.

As for service, it's not the greatest.  I'm in a STRONG Sprint area and this phone rarely has more than 3 bars.  In my office, there are many people with Sprint service and even one or two VM users and I'm the only one who cannot get service in our building.  I think that has more to do with the phone than the provider.These might seem petty but I came from having Verizon and a Droid Incredible for a very long time.

First off it is a great phone. It comes with Android Gingerbread, which is what most android phones run. It has a decent battery life, obviously if you are constantly using GPS, WiFi, Bluetooth, and 3g then your battery will be shorter. I use the phone to occasionally go online and for social networking, sending text messages, and occasionally call someone. For me the battery can last about 2 days (not 48 hours, but time I spend awake). It has crisp call quality and has reception wherever I go (I think has sprint's coverage).During a trip to Great America my cousin's expensive iPhone 4S could get any signal, but mine LG Optimus Elite had full bars and 3g which I find funny because he spends alot more money per month than I do.The other thing that I love is that it is a prepaid phone and you are not locked into a contract which is great if you don't want to use the phone for a month while your out of the country.Dislikes:I activated the phone myself and I had trouble with the process. (But that was probably just me because my brother got the same phone and his activated just fine without problems).I lost the ability to use data(internet access) for no reason for a day, I called the support line and it took a while but my phone was back to normal.

I was paying about $30 a month for it. After hearing about the Virgin plans I decided to go ahead and try one of these phones out. I have not been disappointed. For $130 you get a pretty good little Android phone. It does everything I need, including Netflix, YouTube, and all the Google Play apps.While the quality of the display is not equal to a top-of-the-line Samsung or iPhone, it is very crisp and sharp. I was worried I might not get signal where we live out here in the rural mountain West, but the signal is just fine. As I write this I have four of six bars. I can even stream Netflix if I really want to when I'm away from my Wi-Fi here at home. For a phone in this price range it's perfect for my needs. It also has the GPS features which my wife loves since she's an avid runner.I don't talk much, so the $35 Virgin plan is perfect. My wife talks a lot more than I, and she is still with Verizon on a $70 plan with no data. Next paycheck we're moving her to one of these as well on the $55 unlimited plan. Plus there's no contract!So, for the price and quality of the phone, the price of the plans, and the fact that it does have coverage in our rural setting, I give it 5 stars.

It isn't dual core or anything, but for most games and Google Maps, you won't need more than this phone has. The battery life is also amazing. I haven't had to do any tweaking and it was still at 73 percent after 10 hours of mixed use. It doesn't have a front facing camera, but honestly I dont miss it. It does seem silly to have a mirror on the back without a dedicated camera key, but if you position your finger over the shutter button, then flip the phone, you can still get self shots if you want them.The only thing I do not like is the case does get banged up a bit easily. It is entirely plastic, which makes it very light, but also means it dents easily. I have 2 small depressions on the back and 1 on the side, granted one was because it fell on the sharp edge of a MacBook.

It was the perfect phone for what I want (note: want, not need) but it carried a $300 price tag.Another phone I considered is this one, the LG Optimus Elite. That is a perfect phone for what I need and only carried a $120 price tag.I was also buying phones for the entire family so that factored into my price considerations. In the end, I ended up getting the HTC One V (which I also wrote a review for) and then two of these LG Optimus Elites. The final consideration is that I got these phones on sale for $99 which was a steal.So this is a great phone. It does everything one could want it to do and is smooth and responsive. Sure, there are phones with crazy better specs and screens than this today, but for $100 this is an awesome phone.It runs Android Gingerbread, which I was not too excited about since it is \"outdated\" now. But for the most part it doesn't matter. There are a few things that are better in Ice Cream Sandwich but it isn't a deal breaker, and when you are looking at a $100 phone you really aren't looking for top of the line stuff. Gingerbread is a good solid OS and I have no complaints.The screen is good, but not great. Comparing to my HTC One V which has a slightly bigger screen and better resolution I of course like it better, but there is nothing wrong with the Optimus Elite and its screen. It looks good, and you wouldn't really notice any differences unless you did a side by side comparison to another phone.I like the native keyboard screen quite a bit. The layout is nice and it uses Swype if you so choose. Comparing to my HTC One V I like the Optimus Elite keyboard much better. In fact, on my HTC I ended up installing Swiftkey for a better keyboard, but on the Optimus Elite the standard out of the box keyboard is being used on both phones.An interesting thing about this phone is that it has NFC (Near Field Communication) so you can use your phone as a payment device if you set up a credit card with your Google account. I have not actually enabled that feature but I thought it should be mentioned because most phones don't have that feature even if they are high end(in fact if you research it, very few phones have it).I highly recommend this phone to anybody just breaking in to the smart phone world. I got it for my wife (who essentially just wants email and texting and I am trying to show her she can do other things too which she will do once she sees that it is so easy) and for my daughter (who has used it fervently since it went into her hands).So what is wrong that I am holding my breath?My wife's phone started turning off on its own after just a day. It happened frequently and randomly with no reason. Doing a battery pull reset it and allowed it to turn on again. It was fairly annoying.I contacted Amazon and they sent a replacement. As a side note because it is a huge deal, I must praise the Amazon service for how they handle this. I stated the phone was bad online, they issued a replacement order that shipped to me in 1 day, and provided a return UPS tag to return the bad phone. It was phenomenal service. There are no worries about needing to exchange at this point.So anyways, the day I notified Amazon about the bad phone, my daughter also reported a phone shut down. I asked her to tell me if it did it again, which it did. Mind you, it was not near as frequent as my wife's phone, but it was the same problem so I am having that one replaced too.The new phone has been used for 2 days now with no issues yet (I will update if something changes) and so I am just feeling out if the phone is working well or if something is wrong with this model. I feel it is a good phone and just a fluke that a bad one got sent, but to get 2 bad phones seems unlikely. So I am holding my breath to see what happens. I am hopeful that it pans out because the phone really seems like a good item and one I would recommend.UPDATE 10/3/12:It has been a sufficient time now for both replacement phones to get a good read on them. Neither is experiencing the power issue that the originals did. I can now rest assured that the phone is a good item and are getting great use. I recommend the phone, but be aware that there could be a need to get a replacement.

I was able to install a 16gb class 10 mini SD card, added about 50 apps, half of which I still currently use most of the time and I still have about 160 to 199M memory left.  Whatever apps could be saved on the SD card, I did so to save internal memory.  Thinking back, my old phone (also through Virgin Mobile) was a Samsung Intercept and I usually experienced crashes due to lack of internal memory.With my old phone, I deleted as many apps as I could and monkeyed around with it, but it still got bogged down.  Enter...LG Optimus Elite!  In some ways, it does remind me of my old phone, but the screen is obviously larger. Unlike the Intercept, I find myself using styli more often then not.  I also picked up a keyboard that allows me to type in larger blocks of text for notes, etc.  It uses blutooth and I have to remember to go through some steps to use that. I had to order bypassing software in order to run it for my phone though a company overseas.  Well worth it to me though.  Read my other reviews about that story.I found a protector frame (silicone?) for the phone which makes it look more like an I phone.  I also have become efficient in removing the outer and inner frame in order to remove the battery, should it become necessary.  And to think I also bought that other phone which prevents you from doing so.  Speaking of battery, it doesn't last an entire 24 hours even with the GPS turned off, etc.  I do keep a few alarms up as well as a weather updater.The surprise with Virgin Mobile for me was that my monthly rate was going up.  I guess I should have read all the very fine print provided on the website stating which models or release dates pertained to that change.  Turns out, I don't mind so much since I made sure to use only wifi at home and the most minutes I've used are around 200 minutes/month, so I was able to stay with the cheapest plan now offered.  I can also watch a movie streaming over 3G or wifi, no problem.  THAT, my old phone could never do.  Internet searches are now pretty good and I've used it often to compare online prices to store's prices, not to mention, read reviews on amazon.com.All in all, I like this new phone pretty much and I would carry more often, but the added frame makes it a little to heavy to just throw in my pocket.  I certainly wouldn't put it in a pocket without a case or protection of some kind.  After I have had it a year, I'll update the review.  I may not, if the phone is rendered old school like so many have before.6/25/13: 1 year update (11 months actually).  First, that silicone hybrid protector has been a phone saver for me.  I can't tell you how many times my hubby dropped his HTC EVO V 4G out of his front shirt pocket when leaning forward.  Silicone = staying stuck in place.  As for the phone, it's on it's last legs. Good thing that I bought it with the amazon card promo.  That puts it at almost $8.00 per month for me (would have been $11.80/month at full price).Current problems: 1) The charging port is getting loose, 2) I am now not getting notifications of my calls and texts, for the most part (my first hint that I'm getting a call is when VM notifies me of a voice mail message...I did check my prefs to make sure that calls aren't getting sent to VMail), 3) getting a signal is more difficult than ever, 4) I'm able to get home long before my text gets to my intended party (I send an \"I'm on my way\" message before I take off...15 minutes later, bing!)but I'm already home.

My previous phone is a sprint HTC Evo 4g, which is kind of ancient as far as android phones goes, but overall is a nice phone.The Screen on this phone is smaller than what I am accustomed to which makes the keyboard kind of cramped.  This can be worked around by using the included swype keyboard.  Without swype, typing on this phone would be a miserable experience.  The screen has a relatively low resolution as well so there is some graininess to text and standard webpages are sometimes hard to view.  Not impossible, just not as nice as on my old screen.The sprint network provides service to virgin mobile and I have noticed no difference between my old phone and my new one.The interface on the phone is very snappy.  It fares better than my old phone as far as navigating the home screen , opening and closing apps and what not despite my old phone having a faster processor.  I don't play any games on this phone so I cannot attest to gaming performance, but normal web surfing and youtube do not seem to tax it at all.  Virgin mobile has a ID button right on the front which you can use to install profiles off backgrounds and apps and whatnot.  I personally don't use it.  The button cannot be reconfigured which is kind of a bummer.The phone itself seems to be pretty sturdy.  The back itself is hard plastic, so if you are the clumsy type you might want some manner of rubberized case.  This phone is very droppable.The camera is just ok.

Score!This is my second smartphone and my fourth (or fifth?) phone with Virgin Mobile; I've never had a not-prepaid cellphone, so I can't speak to the differences between that experience and this one.  Similarly, I've had minimal experience with iPhones and more advanced Androids.  So my expectations weren't like yours may be.The things I was looking for were: a big screen, the ability to use many different apps, the ability to look at websites properly, a faster phone more generally.  I got all of that here.  If I could go back and change anything, it'd be to choose a model with a pull-down keyboard: I really need to push the buttons to feel like I'm typing, and I'm much faster with the physical keyboard.  Plus, the on-screen keyboard takes away fifty percent of the screen, which I wasn't thinking about at the time: my effective screen size while texting is actually a bit smaller than it was with the Blackberry!So far (I've had it for about a month) it's been OK.  Still working the kinks in my own behavior out; I keep forgetting to lock the screen, for instance.  Not having the most recent version of Android has turned out to be kind of irritating - there are apps I want, that don't work.  It's a bummer, but not a (retroactive) deal-breaker.  It's much easier to find apps for this than it is for my Kindle Fire HD.  ;)Also, I got a capacitive stylus, which has helped some with the typing speed.Tip: don't peel off the plastic cover for the screen.  And buy a three-pack of plastic covers now, so that when the first plastic cover starts peeling off, you'll have another one ready to go.Also, buy a thin holder/sleeve for it - for constant protection, not as a bag or whatever.

Granted, this is not the most populated area, but the town we were in, Hays Kansas is the biggest town in that area for about 200 miles.  Last time I was there I had no reception.  Nothing!  That was about 8 years ago.  I thought Virgin had to have upgraded (yes I know it's Sprint) but no, again, nothing nada!  Even my brothers cheap track phone had coverage!!  If not for the hotel's free wifi the phone would've been a waste to even bring along!  Not the phone fault, but just a big disappointment with Virgin/Sprint for their lousy coverage.  I did check the maps for coverage on Virgin's website and it said it had coverage there so I was a little miffed shall we say and taking a lot of grief from family members.Now onto the phone itself.  I'm kind of new to smart phones, but I consider myself tech savvy and have pretty much learned most of it by just using it.  It's a simple phone, boots up kind of slow but once up seems responsive.  I have to unload some apps on it since some of them don't work and slow it down.  I explored the settings and have been able to easily connect to the wifi at home, work and Virgin's wifi without any problems.  Calling is easy and the sound is good.  No dropped calls although I have not made that many calls.  Texting is challenging on this phone, but I'm getting used to it.  Sending pictures and texts is easy but slow due to Virgin/Sprint's lousy coverage.  I live in the twin cities in Minnesota, and I usually only see 2 maybe 3 bars.  I did notice some complaints about it getting hot, but a cover helps.  I do notice it without a cover.The camera is OK as long as the light is good, even with the flash.  It's really sensitive though and I find myself taking pictures when I don't want to.  The one problem I've had is the gallery loading up.  It will just sit and \"spin\".  I figured out that is because it's not finding an internet connection and not sure why that is happening unless it's slowing it down so much it just can't load the gallery (I may have only a dozen pictures loaded).  Once I make sure it has an internet connection it loads the gallery just fine.  Weird but true!Games are kind of difficult only because they are small, but I have not done many so will have to try some other games, but the version of Mah Jong I loaded is almost impossible to play.For the money this was not a bad phone.  I originally wanted this HTC Virgin had but they were out of them.  I have the $35 plan, but you do get what you pay for and again coverage sucks with Virgin/Sprint.", "Date": "November 26, 2012"}, {"Title": "Great phone for the price!", "Author": "Marvin Cabatic", "ReviewID": "R2SDXDKOPYP9XZ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I recently upgraded from the Optimus V, and I will admit that the Elite is a good phone!Granted, it's not like the other more expensive phones in VM's lineup, but I love the size and feel of the Elite.  It's easy to hold in my hand, and using the on-screen keyboard is great, although I do have to stretch the thumb farther to reach the letters on the right side (am left-handed).  And... it's super easy to type messages in the landscape mode, and is even greater when using two fingers.I also enjoy having the audio coming from the front of the phone, as compared to the V where the audio emitted from the rear.  The audio is loud enough for me while on speaker phone or listening to music or watching videos.  No more do I have to strain the ears as I did with the V, when the phone is laid flat on its back on the desk.  And I love the fact that it does support Flash videos.There is one feature that I wasn't aware of until I opened the box... this phone is capable of doing screen captures.  And, if you select a photo from your gallery with this feature, you can literally hand write comments relating to the photo, before sharing it via MMS or on Facebook.  However... it'd be best to use a Stylus if you want to write something while using this feature.  I was surprised that out of all the reviews that are out there, none of them mentioned this little feature.Surfing on the internet is really fast.  And to maintain this speed, I make sure that I clear off my internet trash when I'm done.  This is accomplished by using two apps from Google Play... Android Assistant and Memory Booster.Now... (IMO), the battery life is marginal and will drain fast if you're playing with this phone all day.  That's why I make sure that I don't keep too many running apps in the background, and I drop the screen brightness to below 50%.  Using the battery app Juice Defender does help, but by turning off running apps, it increases the battery life greatly.  Also, I hate that the ID pack has to be installed onto this phone.  I'm still trying to find the method of deleting it, since I like my own settings.  Besides, it adds a few more junk stuff onto the memory (some I've already deleted cause I don't use them).Beware of which case you intend to purchase for the Elite, because some of them have a high ridge on the front, and it does make it difficult to reach those letters that are at the far left or right side of the screen.  Unless you use a Stylus to type, then it shouldn't be a problem.Regarding VM service, I've had no major issues with calls or the service itself.  However, I do live on the fringes of the cell sites (not only for VM, but for Verizon and ATT as well), so when I need to make calls from home or send texts, I have to move around until I find a sweet spot.  Sending MMS messages can only be accomplished when I'm within range of the cell site (1 mile from my home).The photo and video cameras work fine for my tastes.  The image resolution is satisfactorily for me, good enough for taking quick photos or videos for sharing.  If the Elite had a front-facing camera, that'd be more sweet!In closing, the LG Optimus Elite is just right for me in terms of cost and functions.  It's not a really fancy phone, but it's not an \"el-cheapo\" phone either.  The build quality is good, the sound quality is good, and the service quality is just right for me.

Kevin Stevens", "ReviewID": "R1H4M4RRV2PCUB", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "Like many others, I wanted a budget smart-phone to start off with, and the initial reviews of this looked promising. However, this hunk of garbage was glitchy to begin with (for example, the text function would occasionally disable in landscape mode, phone would power off on its own irregularly, et al), and the interface seemed clunky and primitive for a smart-phone, but whatever - it still basically worked.Then about four weeks in, after a full charge, the thing just died. No shock or water damage. Having dealt with all kinds of batteries (in sales), I have much experience with battery longevity [in case you don't know: it's always best to fully charge and fully discharge most batteries]. The old trick of removing and replacing the battery didn't work, either. So I took it in to the Sprint store at the Flatiron building in NYC, where they assured me it was just a weird coincidence, and I was happy at the time to accept an identical replacement.Guess what: in exactly four more weeks, the exact same failure. Mind you, as is often the case, both times the phone died on me were the worst possible times for it to happen, and even though the second time was an actual emergency, the jerks at the Sprint store made me wait two+ hours for their tech to tell me what I already knew: phone was dead and they had no idea why. Each rep I spoke to kept assuring me it's a perfectly fine phone, and intimated that perhaps I did something to it, which I assure you I did not. [Side note: because there was no physical damage, my insurance on the phone was useless.] Their best resolution was to have me return after four days for a replacement of the exact same piece of garbage phone. I let them know as politely as I could muster that they had totally failed on every level of customer service and had them cancel my account immediately. I then walked directly over to T-Mobile and signed with them for a Samsung Galaxy Lite, which I can already tell is a vastly superior phone.", "Date": "December 31, 2013"}, {"Title": "Last Year's Model", "Author": "Alan  Houston", "ReviewID": "R1YU3K26TE4OWW", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "A year ago, this was a good choice on the Virgin network.

I use my phone to talk on,text, email so I'm not getting a million updates on facebook,instagram or twitter. I use my phone as an actual phone, not a computer. It would shut off during conversations. The texting app would have to force close in the middle of use. This phone was the biggest hassle. Last week the screen started to go off. The phone never got wet or was dropped. It would flicker and come on. It finally went totally black and the 4 buttons on the bottom would illuminate. I could hear incoming calls and notifications but the screen would not turn on. Now the phone is completely dead. I thought maybe the battery was bad, but I got a new one and it did not work. I purchased this phone in February!!

I had a HTC One V that died after three months, loved the Ice Cream Sandwich OS on that one but, signal strength was an issue. The OS is the best by far however, the phone would lose service constantly. The Elite uses (Gingerbread) and lacks some of the settings and controls. If you could upgrade this phone to (Ice Cream Sandwich) it would be as close to the perfect phone as you could get. So far, no real complaints. Pairs well and works well with Ford Sync and Voyager Pro head set. Email works flawlessly and voice to text is almost as good as the HTC One V. Signal strength is much better and has not lost service since it has been activated. I highly recommend this phone for the basic user that demands simplicity and is looking for a solid call, text, email device.One last thing, The battery life on this phone is awesome. The Optimus One V was acceptable and the HTC One V was horrible. Keep in mind, the HTC battery is internal and not easily replaced, had to charge the phone multiple times during the day.

I decided to take the leap to the Optimus Elite for two reasons:1) I am a DSLR camera user, and I was psyched to have a camera that I could fit in my pocket and always have with me. My old smartphone, an HTC Hero, also had a 5MP camera and took great photos. I expected the same of the Optimus Elite. I've been sorely disappointed by every photo I've taken so far: blurry, grainy, out of focus, discolored, blech. I'm not sure if this is an LG issue or if this particular phone model just sucks camera-wise.2) I am a textaholic, and after suffering with a numerical keypad I was dying to get back to a QWERTY keyboard. My HTC Hero was slightly smaller than the Optimus Elite, and it had a great, responsive, easy to use keyboard. Again, I expected the same. Not at all. I am a petite woman with slim fingers, but for some reason, the Optimus Elite's keyboard is clunky and difficult to type on. Another big disappointment.For the price, this is a pretty decent smartphone, and after having Virgin Mobile for one month, I have no complaints as of yet (except for switching my old number to my new phone, what a nightmare!). Overall I am satisfied with it, but since the camera and the keyboard were my main reasons for getting another smartphone, I have to give it only three stars.

I have read several reviews on this phone and because there were several that gave it a rating of 1, I was pretty hesitant about making the purchase.  Then I realized that there many people like to complain about the smallest of things, so I went with the purchase.  Boy as I glad I did.  The first stand out feature I am going to talk about is the one that I speak to me most.  I am not much of a typist on a type writer and surely not on the small key boards of a phone.  This phone has a swiping feature that is so cool.  All you do is slide your finger over the letters of the word you want to type.  The phone gives you a list of words to choose from, but during my use, the phone has picked the word I am looking for and it is already in place. Pretty darn impressive.  The next really cool feature on this phone is it also has Wi-Fi.  At first I was wondering why in the world would I need Wi-Fi when this thing has 3G?  One of those features I am paying for but will never use, really?  I was so wrong.  In my house I am able to get 3G coverage every time I use the phone, but at work, it is a different story.  For whatever reason, many people have trouble getting a good signal there.  This is when the Wi-Fi feature comes in handy.  It is not as quick as 3G, but I can continue to do the things I need to do. Pretty darn cool.  To close this review out, I am going to end it the way I probably should have started, by explaining why I was in the market for a new phone.  I started looking for a new phone because I wanted to get away from contracts.  After being with Sprint for 1.5 yrs I wanted to upgrade to a Note II.  They told me I could upgrade, but because I was upgrading too soon, I would have to pay an additional $100 dollars for the early upgrade.  That was in addition to the $300 I was willing to pay for the phone with a 2 yr commitment.  Otherwise I would have to wait a month and a half prior to the end of my contract, and then I could only pay the $300 for the phone with a 2 yr commitment.  I told my wife that it was crazy and that I was finished with contracts.  As much as I want to call them thieves I can't because we are actually volunteering to be taken advantage of.  It is not just Sprint, it is all of them.  Doing the math, that Note II would have cost me $2100.  Getting this Optimus Elite will cost me $1400 after two years, not to mention that I can change phones or stop service any time I want to without a huge financial penalty.  My wife has the Galaxy S3 and her job issued her an I Phone 4.  After seeing this phone, she said she was going to follow my lead once her contract is over.  If you are one of those people who goes out and by a Kia and complains that is does not perform like a Jaguar, disregard this review, I was not talking to you!!!  I am a simple but practical guy.  If you are a simple but practical person, I would advise you to give this phone a try.  I really do not think you will be disappointed.  The only negative I would give this phone is the battery time.  I think it will be better once I can remember to turn the Blue-Tooth and Wi-Fi off when I am not using it.  By the way, there is nothing wrong with a Kia, I just gave Kia Amanti to my daughter as a graduation gift.

I love the size of it, especially how slim it is. It fits perfectly in my pockets.However, I've have two of these phones since April when I purchased the original.- The first battery that was in the original phone was damaged and caused the phone to get so hot it was uncomfortable (and almost painful) to hold. After contacting Virgin they sent me a new one.- I had to send in the original after the power/screen on/off button started to refuse to work. I had to guess on which part of the button would switch my phone on, and near the end of the original phone's life with me I had to hold the button down several times to turn the screen on. After talking to Virgin again, they sent me a new one with a return label for the original. The original phone lasted from April to the beginning of September- Phone 2, received in the beginning of September, is having issues now (the end of October). The charge port (or possibly the cords I'm using?) malfunctions and doesn't always charge it, despite slight wigglings of the cord and the plug. Today, the softkeys died, so I cannot navigate the phone at all. Even with calibrating the screen the screen doesn't work properly either.I'm really sad about this phone. When it works, it works great, but when it doesn't, it's a nightmare. I'm trying to decide if I'm going to contact Virgin once more and have them send me a new phone since this handset malfunctioned in less than a month and a half of use.Edit 1/1/14: since writing this review, I'm on phone 3. It works \"okay\" but I can tell it lags worse than the others have. Some times it \"glitches\" and vibrates randomly. It frequently closes my programs out without warning.At the end of this pay cycle I'll be added to my fiance's contract with Verizon.

I did give the phone 5 stars because for the money, this phone blows away comparable products.  If I bought an iphone off contract I'd have to pay something like 5 times this much.  No way it's worth it.  Actually, I bought this with the intention of just using it as an mp3 player, a la Ipod Touch.  A new 32 GB Ipod touch is about $275.  I spent $80 to get this phone with a 32 GB memory card.  Is an Ipod Touch better?  Hell yes.  Is it 3-4 times better?  Hell freaking no.Anyway, now I'm using this as a phone with Google voice on the Ting network.  Gaming the system.  Check it out.On to the complaints:1) Slow processing speed - menus and apps move rather slowly compared to an iphone or newer samsung device.  Very high quality video (especially in Flash format) does not run well.  Plan on cycling power about once a day to get it to run smoothly.  But I still can watch movies on it like Blood Diamond and Silver Linings Playbook just fine and in good quality.2) You can't turn the noise off on the stupid camera.  For some reason, I found this infuriating.  But I did find an app called \"UVA Silent Camera\" that solved the problem.3) Poor battery life.  I haven't done tests to know if this is worse on other prepaid phones, but the standby time is not as good as the specs boast.  It gets me through the day, though.Other complaints I have are about the Android operating system itself (although overall, I like Android better than IOS or Windows) so it isn't fair to complain about them here.", "Date": "June 11, 2013"}, {"Title": "wonderful", "Author": "l0lhibree", "ReviewID": "R1UIKVOH6FXTPU", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "it's a really good phone for the price. takes decent pictures and is fast and all that. i love it.", "Date": "June 10, 2013"}, {"Title": "LG Optimus Elite (Virgin Mobile)", "Author": "geddyupgang", "ReviewID": "R34F9OB95Y5A0S", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "LG Optimus Elite (Virgin Mobile)this was a gift and the person enjoys the phone and has bought many accessories for it.", "Date": "June 7, 2013"}, {"Title": "nice phone, bad battery life", "Author": "JJ", "ReviewID": "R2C7LVF9YAGY8O", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "First phone was not working correctly and would not shut off and kept re-staring over and over again.

I only had basic phones til I picked out this one. It has sooooooooooo many features. My favorite is voice activated gps. It's so accurate on picking up your spoken destination. Tons of great apps, way better than iTunes store has. It's a cool looking phone, nice clear display, the touch screen is nice and responsive. I saw other people say the connection speed was slow, I haven't noticed it yet, it's pretty quick to me. Another nice feature is if you have wifi at home it uses that signal instead of 3g. The pictures turn out nice, 5mega pixels. The camcorder looks crystal clear. No static or hissing when I talk. I only owned it a short while I really cant find anything I don't like about it yet. I went to Radio Shack and bought the phone for $60.00, $45.00 a month for 1200 anytime minutes, unlimited texting and unlimited data!!! I don't know why everyone would not go to Virgin Mobile. Great phone buy it!!!  Update: 05/04/14 Phone works like it did the day I bought it. I think this better than a lot of higher level phones. The battery life is great if you don't have the 3g and the wifi on. If you need it turn it on, it takes 3 seconds. Then maybe 4 more once you choose 3g in settings. If you can't wait 7 seconds for internet you need a hobby. Just updating because so many people bashed the battery life. The music player is great too. That does not drain the battery much at all. I've had the 3g on and off with the music player running 10hrs when I'm at work.

I've had this phone for roughly 4 months (with Virgin Mobile) now and I've finally had enough and will be buying a different phone.  For all of the folks that just wrote 5 star reviews for this phone... wait until you've had the phone for a couple of months and have really used it (once the honeymoon period is over) you'll most likely experience some of the same issues that I'll be talking about below (I hope you don't though).  I'll cover both the bad and good points about my experience with this smartphone:The Bad:- This phone will not allow you to read group text messages from iPhones.  My boss and everyone on my team at work unfortunately has an iPhone, and whenever they send a group text message to everyone I receive a BLANK text message from all of the iPhone users.  I read numerous Droid forums looking for solutions and all other Virgin Mobile LG Optimus Elite users say that Virgin Mobile is aware of this issue with this phone and can not do anything about it.  I've tried to solve this problem by not using the default Droid Messaging app and tried using GoSMS Pro and Handcent but they do not solve the blank group message iPhone problem.  So whenever I receive a group text message from my boss or other people at my work I have to personally text them or call them to find out what they said.  I can tell this is starting to annoy my boss.  I've put in a trouble ticket to Virgin Mobile regarding this issue, have called support, and all I've received so far was stock/scripted responses.- I live in the Washington D.C. Metro area and I should be receiving a great consistent signal, but I'm constantly dropping calls and many times my 3G Data drops off- Bad or unreliable data connectivity.  This could be the fault of Virgin Mobile, but I've read in many Android forums that the phone is more to blame in this situation...I constantly lose my 3G data connection which makes it hard to surf the web, listen to Pandora, use the GPS, get traffic updates, use Google Voice, or do anything else that requires a data connection- The Battery life is so so.  I'm not a heavy phone user and do not text a lot or make many phone calls during my work day and the phone lasts roughly 10 hours on a single charge.  I would consider this \"fair\" to \"poor\" battery life for a smartphone since I'm a light user.The Good:- This smartphone is the perfect size.  It's small enough to fit in your pants pocket or in your jacket pocket.  It's rather thin too, so it won't bulge out from your pockets.- Nice screen resolution and decent screen size.- Pretty responsive touch screen.  It doesn't compare to the iPhone or Samsung GS3, but for this affordable price its a decent performer.- Lots of free apps in the Google Play store and since this uses Gingerbread there's a good selection.- Includes GPS, 3G data (pretty unreliable for me), bluetooth, nice camera (includes a flash!) that takes pretty good quality pics- affordable price.  I paid over $125 bucks when I bought this.So if you don't have any friends or family who have iPhones and you can put up with the negatives that I outlined above, then this is will be a decent starter/entry-level smartphone for you.", "Date": "February 5, 2013"}, {"Title": "phone", "Author": "Angela N.", "ReviewID": "R1PG0RK9ZZ4M6G", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "came fast. was packaged great. would deal with them again. its works and i had no trouble getting it activated", "Date": "January 24, 2013"}, {"Title": "Meets my needs and expectations", "Author": "S.

Besides the standard phone calls and texting, you can take still photos and videos, watch YouTube videos, download books, play games, read your e-mail, surf the internet, use Google maps, check Facebook, listen to music, use a calculator, check the news and weather, and much more.  The phone has a 3.5 inch Capactive touch screen, weighs 4.25 ounces, and measures 4 x 5 x 2.47 x 0.39 inches.  The 1520 mAh lithium-ion battery is rated for up to 7.2 hours of talk time and up to 10.5 days of standby time.After what turned out to be a disastrous experience with the PCD Venture Prepaid Android Phone (Virgin Mobile), I needed a new cell phone.  I've been very happy with the LG Optimus Elite.  It does everything well - I've had no problems making phone calls, texting, surfing the Internet, buying apps, taking pictures, watching videos, etc.  The sound is nice and crisp and I've had no problems with dropped calls.  The keyboard is a bit tiny and I take full advantage of the Voice Import voice recognition software that allows me not only to dictate text messages but surf the Internet, send e-mail, and more.  The camera/camcorder takes nice pictures.  The GPS is a nice bonus - I use a handheld GPS to do geocaching but it's nice having the GPS on the phone if I decide at the last moment to look for a geocache and I don't have my GPS with me.  The phone uses the Sprint 3G network and I've been pleased with how easy it is to use the internet on my phone - no matter where I am.  The battery lasts a long time - much longer than other cell phones I've had.The LG Optimus Elite is part of Virgin Mobile's Beyond Talk Plan (meaning I pay a monthly fee rather than topping up every three months) but there is no contract and it is a nice phone and well worth the monthly fee.", "Date": "September 26, 2012"}, {"Title": "great step up from a \"regular\" phone.", "Author": "Amazon Customer", "ReviewID": "RXHYAIRI98TUV", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This is my first \"smart\" phone.

Three years later, she was getting a little flaky, so I decided to upgrade.  VM no longer has the $25/month plan.  They will grandfather you in, if you upgrade to a mid 2012 phone or older.  VM provided me a list of phones that I could use and remain in the $25 plan and the LG Optmus Elite was one of them.I found a new in box one on eBay with a Buy it Now price of $59.99, shipped.  I received it and I immediately noticed that it was slimmer.  That was cool and I noticed the LED flash for the camera and a reset button.  All good and in fact, as we find out later, having a reset \"hole\" is good but not in a good way.The biggest beef with the Optimus \"V\" is on phone memory.  Less than 400 mb!  I had to uninstall apps that i wanted to keep.  Yes I could move them to the 16 Gb micro-SD card but some bits and bytes still remained on the phone and i had to have two apps to contstantly clean the memory.  The Elite has a little short of 1 Gb of \"phone\" storage and a bit short of 2 Gb of \"Internal memory,\" which i assume is a virtual SD card.  I bought a 32 Gb micro SD card but the phone won't let me move apps to that as it thinks that virtual SD card is  real one.  Google needs to add that option (iinternal SD, or External SD) to the Android OS.  I will use the external for music - not apps.The processor is listed as 800 MHz while the \"V\" model had only 600 MHz, under the hood.  I actually find the Elite to be a bit slower.  In fact, it often hangs when using apps that you would not expect them to tax the phone.  I've had to pull the battery maybe a dozen times in less than a month, as it had became unresponsive.  I did discover the reset button and that stoips from having to pull the battery.  Speaking of the battery.  Even worse battery time than the V.Although the phone seems to have better speakers than the V, I find call quality to be substandard.  The V was much nicer.All in all, if you are looking to stay grandfathered in VM's old $25 or $40 plans, this phone is an option but it's not that great.PROs:Can keep in older VM Beyond Talk $25 or $40 plansThinnerCameras has an LED flash (can function as a flashlight with an app)CONsPoor speedFrequent phone freezes / lockupsPoor Call QualitySD card slot requirews removal of the back back of the phone", "Date": "February 25, 2014"}, {"Title": "Fast Shipping & Just as described", "Author": "S.

Like most prepaid users, I didn't think I'd ever be able to get a phone with the capabilities contract users got. The LG Optimus Elite eliminated that sentiment after the first week I had it.Every app on the Android marketplace in compatible with it. I've only downloaded arcade-style games so far, but they run smoothly. The only one I've run into minor problems with is the Netflix app, which crashes every now and then. Not sure if that's a complication deriving from the phone or the app though.It's 5 megapixel camera takes clean and clear shots, and the flash is amazing. (On a side note, the \"Brightest Flashlight Free\" app utilizes the light and works amazingly) However, you may have to occasionally retake your pictures as the camera sometimes has difficulty focusing.The battery lasts all day with no issues. Even when using video apps it holds up longer than I'd expected.My only real qualm is the keyboard. It's nothing detrimental to a purchasing decision, but you will have moments where letter selection is off. The auto-correct is pretty handy, but the ES button (switched you to Spanish) is right near the space button, so I accidentally switch to Spanish a lot, and thusly it auto-corrects in Spanish. Annoying. I've never been a fan of touchscreen keyboards to begin with.TL;DR: You get unlimited talk, text, and data for $25 a month ($35 if you're a new subscriber).

Industry reporting indicates 44 percent of Android users are still using versions 2.3.3 through 2.3.7 - known as Gingerbread - which were released in 2011 and have a number of security vulnerabilities that were fixed in later versions. The growing use of mobile devices by federal, state, and local authorities makes it more important than ever to keep mobile OS patched and up-to-date.\"The bulletin proceeded to identify SMS Trojans, rootkits and fake Google Play domains as security threats and offered various mitigation strategies.For example, to fight against SMS Trojans it advised, \"Install an Android security suite designed to combat these threats. These security suites can be purchased or downloaded free from the Internet.\"To protect against fake domains, \"Install only approved applications and follow IT department procedures to update devices' OS. Users should install and regularly update antivirus software for Android devices to detect and remove any malicious applications.\"The IT industry and tech-savvy users have known about these types of security concerns - stemming from Android fragmentation, most mobile phone manufacturers' sloth and indifference, and user inertia and ignorance - for a while now.
