{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Great Phone & Good Service", "Author": "Peripateticus", "ReviewID": "R18Y6U7CQO3G2Y", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I ordered this from Amazon via Hassle-Free Cell on Monday and had the phone Friday using standard shipping.  It was new and even had a fresh battery (manufacture date 8/2008); although manufactured for SE Asia the default language was English and everything works great.  I liked my old Razr V3 but it was a little bulky; I loved my moto Pebl but it bit the dust after a nasty fall.  The K1 combines the best of both those phones, plus adds a music player.  It has a nice solid feel with a rubberized back and a very crisp, high-contrast display like the Pebl and unlike the Razr.  One of the things I like about Motorola phones is that accessories using mini-USB work for all their phones, as far as I know.  This includes Phone Tools software, stereo earbuds, chargers, etc. so I didn't have to buy all that stuff over again.  Call volume and quality is very good and the music player sounds great, although it is a bit quirky and limited and doesn't have external music player control buttons like the CDMA version.  The player doesn't recognize a lot of the MP3s I loaded on a 2 gig card, but maybe I just need to wipe it and try again.  Like the other Motos I mentioned, the soft keys can be programmed so that there is ready to access to the things I frequently use, like the calendar and alarms.  In picking a phone I didn't really care about the voice recognition feature, but it works so well that I use it all the time now.  I don't have or need a data plan, so I can't speak to the browser feature, which is no doubt very primitive compared to a smart phone.  Overall this an excellent phone for calling, and at a very reasonable price.", "Date": "February 7, 2009"}, {"Title": "Speakerphone is bad", "Author": "Zibby", "ReviewID": "RNAS1BWQITHI2", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "Love the phone(second KRZR I own).Charger doesn't work,waiting for replacement.Speakerphone doesn't work well,barely can hear it.", "Date": "March 28, 2009"}, {"Title": "Australian warranty and foreign charger", "Author": "R.

I am living and working in Vietnam and needed an unblocked cell phone I could use here and in the USA. I found a KRZR K1 on Amazon and purchased it on my recent visit home. When the phone arrived it didn't work. I sent it back and they sent me another one. The second phone worked but would not ring when receiving a call. I was 4 days from returning to Vietnam and didn't have time to send the 2nd phone back and wait for a replacement. I thought I was just out the price of the phone and would have to wait till I returned to America next spring to buy another one, or pay the inflated prices here in Asia. I called Hassle Free Returns and explained my situation. To my surprise they sent me a replacement and 2 extra batteries overnight express. I got the replacement the day I was leaving for Asia. The phone works perfectly, and I love it! I also love Hassle Free Cell Phones for providing such great customer service. I will never hesitate to buy from them in the future, they stand by their productsMotorola KRZR K1 Unlocked Phone with 2 MP Camera, MP3/Video Player, and MicroSD Slot--International Version with Warranty (Black). Oh yeah one other thing. They told me to keep the phone that didn't ring as a back up.

It has a camera and video player.CONs: The video player is not what I expected. Key pad is small. The view on the tiny screen is so-so.Okay, I admit, I haven't used the phone a lot yet or gotten greatly familiar with it. I was looking for a phone that I could use in the U.S. and abroad, where I am living and working now, and I was looking for one I could use to record video/audio without having to lug around another device. (Is there a device out there for under $300, let's say, that has an unlocked quad-band phone--not one that comes with the purchase of two-year cell phone plan, a PDA, and a decent video camera all in one?)Video record--20 secs at a time:The big disappointment was the video record. I was looking forward to having it available when I'm out and about and want to record something unexpected happening, which is fairly often in Nairobi. It records for only 20 seconds at a time. One time it didn't even capture the audio. And, when I converted the videos to my computer, they were the inky dinkiest little things I ever imagined. I can only pray that the audio will at least record--there are times when all I really want is to record some sound...Russian:The phone, books, and keypad came in Russian. Now, of all the languages they could have chosen, Russian was a good one for me, since I have a Masters in it. I can see how that might be a bit tough though for someone who doesn't know a language. Maybe they should provide some quickee instructions with the phone on switching the phone to English. Just a thought... The keypad in Russian is a little annoying. Maybe someday I'll be so familiar with the keypad that I don't need to look, but, alas, I have just gotten into txting the last couple years living in Kenya, where it's really cheap. So, some of the Russian letters that look like English letters throw me off at times.Keypad:I am coming from a simple Nokia phone whose keypad was very nice for my fingers. I do not have big fingers, but the KRZR keypad is too small and hard to use for my taste.MP3 Player:Plays quite well...nice...I like it. I will look forward to using that in my car in Kenya...much easier than dealing with CDs (even if I had a CD player in the car). Not sure how that will suck the battery power--will have to find out.MicroSD card--no more than 2GB:I did see this somewhere later, but, do realize the phone supports no more than a 2GB card. I got a 4GB--doesn't work. The 2GB works great.I haven't tried the phone yet in Nairobi, where I will be using it extensively. So, basically, the jury is still out... Just wanted to give you my initial thoughts.", "Date": "July 17, 2009"}, {"Title": "great phone", "Author": "Dennis R.

Because I don't!", "Author": "L. Kuipers", "ReviewID": "R207JQ5X4ZC269", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I was so excited for this item.  I have been living abroad for about a year and have the crappiest cell phone in the world (Motofone).  I ordered this and had to sent to my mom, who was planning to visit me in Europe in a couple of weeks.  The phone arrived and when she opened up the manual to try to figure out how to use it, it was in Russian!!!  As my mom said, \"Luckily, the pictures were in English.\" haha.  When she turned on the phone, it was also in Russian, but once she inserted the German SimCard I had purchased, we were able to work our way through (the SimCard changed the language to German).  After that, I only have one complaint, the keys have both standard and Russian characters, which really is no biggie.  I have loved every other aspect about the phone, but will have to get a memory card, as the phone does not have enough memory itself to store texts, songs, etc.  Also, the camera isn't the greatest, but I didn't purchase the phone for the camera.  I just wanted something reliable which would allow me to see who called, who I called, allow me to send text messages, wake me up, etc.  This phone does all of that.  So I am happy about the phone itself... just not about the Russian.I would highly recommend when buying the \"International Version\" that you check with the buyer to see just how \"international\" the phone is.  Maybe I was dumb, but I thought \"International Version\" meant that it would work all over the world (like a quad band phone).  When my mom tried to use it in the Netherlands, it didn't work, but it might be because she didn't know how to use it.  It works just fine in Germany with a German SimCard.Great phone, but just make sure it is in the language you want or that you speak the language it will come in.  I think the sellers should do this, but I guess it is a way to get the phones of their hands and trick the customers a little bit.p.s. If you accidentally get a Russian version, just insist that they send you a new one and refuse to pay more for the English version.", "Date": "July 1, 2009"}, {"Title": "what a pain", "Author": "F.

Worst phone I have ever owned. I will NEVER purchase another motorola phone again. Not only is the battery life so pitiful that I had to purchase a car charger to make sure I had battery life in an emergency but the battery alert cannot be turned off without turning off the phone. So, guess who has to get up in the middle of the night to find the phone somewhere in the house- the battery alert is so LOUD (not adjustable) that it wakes up the whole house. And it goes off every minute or 2 for the hour it takes for the darn thing to die. Also, one of the reasons I believe the battery life is so poor is because the image on the front of the phone lights up every 30 seconds- very distracting if you sleep with your phone near you in bed, and also a huge and pointless waste of energy.", "Date": "September 15, 2009"}, {"Title": "unlocked motorola krzr k1 a - o kay", "Author": "Anon \"recordkeeper\"", "ReviewID": "R3L3VLI5NJXJZG", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "this product was everything promised.
