I could say more horrible things but to get to the point its. slow, too thick, and wifi sucks on it.", "Date": "August 30, 2012"}, {"Title": "NOT UNLOCKED", "Author": "MARY", "ReviewID": "R11ZK5RAJ58CL7", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "THE PHONE WAS NOT UNLOCKED NEVER ACCEPT MY SIM CARD , I DONT KNOW WHY THEY SAY THAT IS UNLOCKED IF IT IS NOT", "Date": "August 13, 2012"}, {"Title": "The dumbest smart phone ever.", "Author": "Amazon Customer \"And now you know....\"", "ReviewID": "R2NAPW2MYK9CW3", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "Ok, let me first say that I purchased this on sale for about 120 dollars, and even at that price I think it's overpriced.Impressions:-Call quality is great, speakerphone is loud and distortion-free-The screen is very small. Pixel density isn't that great, although it's not horrible.-The camera is ok for taking well lit pictures but it's very weak in low light as there's no flash built in.-The touch screen isn't very responsive, sometimes taking multiple taps over the same area to register. I don't know if this is a problem with the screen or lag on the processor. this seems very spotty however because 90% of the time the phone works perfectly.-The GPS feature works reasonably well, although the GPS maps are a bit sluggish on this phone....The Symbian OS has a steeper learning curve than a lot of other smartphone OSes, but once you learn to navigate it, it's fairly easy. an interesting feature is the ability to add contacts to the main screen and scroll through them. The problem is that the icons are small and the scrolling is inconsistent. It's usually faster to enter your address book and find your contacts.This phone has a decent amount of features, but the problem is nothing is terribly well executed. If you manage to find this phone in the 60-70 dollar range and you're not looking for anything special you will probably be reasonably satisfied with this phone. Just understand that this is one of the dumbest smart phones I've ever seen.", "Date": "February 21, 2011"}, {"Title": "Sweet phone!", "Author": "Atlas", "ReviewID": "R2BXOJQF5EKS1M", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I really like this phone.
