Net10 it's the best kept secret in the wireless communications industry. For a fraction of the cost of the legacy phone carriers, this low cost carrier delivers exceptional service.I switched my number from an old device to the GSIII online by myself just by following the instructions. In eight hours, I had my service transferred to the new smartphone.The smartphone I received is a GSIII S960L, and the Android version is 4.1.2. For $50 a month including taxes (autopay on credit card that can be terminated at any time. If you don't have a debit/credit card, it's just $5 more a month) I get unlimited data at 4G speed, unlimited talk, and unlimited text, I believe on Sprint's network. I am able to stream videos and use maps and all other \"heavy\" stuff. What can I ask more?", "Date": "August 23, 2013"}, {"Title": "Awesome", "Author": "Darren strohecker", "ReviewID": "R1NWQI6XWSTD1G", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I love this phone it is amazing!! the only down side is that the 4G LTE don't work so I can only use the 3G tho there isn't much of a difference.
