Just what I was looking for...So far no dirt, it works great. One thing is that the volume is less strong than when you connect directly the device so if your sound system is already weak this may not be a good option for you.", "Date": "July 19, 2013"}, {"Title": "Absolutely the best!", "Author": "Zildjian71", "ReviewID": "R1GIYI9KWRU8HO", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "It's simple and easy to connect. If you have NFC capabilities then a tap is all it takes to connect. I did notice that some power supplies have a hum that is noticeable. I have also used it with a backup usb battery and had no noise at all. It is very small and easy to lose track of so I keep a audio cable plugged in to it.Delivery was very prompt and on time.", "Date": "February 7, 2014"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": null, "Features": null, "Name": null, "ImgURL": null, "ProductID": "B00D9U5ITG"}}
