{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Love the Samsung A697 Sunburst phone", "Author": "B. H. Stewart", "ReviewID": "R1O75GUEPBR42S", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I am impressed with how this phone works. I enjoy the widget menu as it puts the apps I want right at my finger tips, and I can move them from the widget bar to one of three 'home' screens.  The call clarity is very good, far better than any other cell I've had.  Very sharp image on the display, I've uploaded images from my PC and they look great!The largest problem I have is that the virtual keyboard is very small (hey its a small phone so this issue isn't one I didn't see coming), and I have fingers that cover between 2 and 4 characters.  So I've been having some issue with hitting the correct keys when entering text.Also due to the small screen, using the web browser so far has been more trouble than its worth, but I've only tried it a couple of times so far.", "Date": "October 11, 2011"}, {"Title": "A Great Phone, Overall", "Author": "Ron Goldberg \"Ronnjee\"", "ReviewID": "RLR0L35I37VQM", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "The Samsung Sunburst was the phone I'd been looking for after being unhappy with several others.  First off, it's compact and lightweight; fits in any pocket, and at just a tad over 3 ounces, it's not an annoying pocketful. The touch screen and software are very good, and the web browser actually does OK for the occasional lookup, although heavy web users will be disappointed. I wanted a QWERTY keyboard, but I didn't want the extra bulk of a slider.  The virtual keyboard works quite well, although it is rather easy to miss a key.  Again, not a big deal if you're not a heavy texter, like me.  Call quality is excellent.  Like all phones, the Sunburst is a compromise.  But if don't really need a smartphone and you're looking for good performance in a small package, this is the way to go.", "Date": "July 4, 2013"}, {"Title": "replacement", "Author": "richard j gladding", "ReviewID": "REAGBQQS2ZL8R", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I have had this phone before and it was great for my needs, I dropped my origional phone and broke it, so I just ordered another the same thing, very happy with seller, would buy from them again", "Date": "January 17, 2014"}, {"Title": "good cheap touch phone but crappy interface", "Author": "sfury", "ReviewID": "R2W0I5QIVPP2YH", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "the user interface is god awful.

Hall", "ReviewID": "R2INP42OVZAXX3", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "Wow this phone sucks. This has arguably the sloppiest touch screen I've ever used. Its unresponsive most of the time but when it decides to work its way to damn sensitive and you cant touch the damn thing without it opening every thing your finger gets near. Navigating the contacts list is a nightmare because of this and otherwise the interface is incredibly unintuitive. Wanna make a change in the settings section? Well all the little icons you dragged onto the 3 facing panels reset every single time you change something and you have to redrag them onto the 3 facing panels all over again....this phone is a pile of crap. Just get a damn iphone.Also AT&T;'s \"app\" store is a freaking joke! AT&T; mobile banking is apparently a social networking tool. Its also in every single other category under apps for some reason...WHAT A FREAKING JOKE! Myspace? Really? Where the hell is tumblr? or twitter? or anything that would actually be useful for someone under the age of 100 to use?! Well hell, we have myspace and yahoo search, what more could you want? Oh AIM...This is a phone for people who have never used a good phone and don't know what a good phone can do.", "Date": "November 16, 2011"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": null, "Features": null, "Name": null, "ImgURL": null, "ProductID": "B004ETB2KU"}}
