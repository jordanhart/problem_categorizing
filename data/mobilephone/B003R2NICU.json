Went online to buy a unlock code for it and it didn't work.  Emailed the company who I purchased the phone from through Amazon and they were not helpful and said there was nothing they could do.  My friend's cell phone provider T-Mobile said because it was a Rogers phone they couldn't do anything for me either.  So the phone is useless!!!!  No one seems to be able to help.  I would not recommend buying a phone online.
