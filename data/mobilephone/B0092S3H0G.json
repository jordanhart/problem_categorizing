Selden", "ReviewID": "R2OAK7EQSHX0YO", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "Bought it because it was cheap, I have encountered nothing but problems upon using this phone.  The keyboard crashes multiple times a day and it just freezes constantly.  I literally can't even use it an am frantically scrambling to buy another phone on the cheap because I can't deal with too much more of this.  By far the worst piece of technology I have ever owned.  The battery life is miserable so I bought the extended battery which is massive.  Sometimes it calls random people and then when I touch the screen to hit \"end\" it turns the screen off.  If I remove my finger the screen then turns back on.  The only way to remedy this is to take out the battery, restart the phone, and apologize to the person I accidentally called.  Avoid at all costs, I can't even believe that this thing costs money it is so unbelievably awful.", "Date": "March 3, 2013"}, {"Title": "Nice phone no lag", "Author": "B.McClure", "ReviewID": "R1RN7NLQO97NG1", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I got this phone as a freebie from Verizon. I upgraded from the LG Vortex (which I LOVED for 2 years.) I ONLY us LG phones because #1 I have never had a problem with one #2 all my chargers/accessories are for LG and I can't see buying all new stuff for another brand. Phone runs GREAT. I have had zero problems with any connection or lag with this device. The ONLY problem that I have encountered with this phone is that i cannot figure out how to save downloaded apps/games (angry birds, weather app, solitaire, pinterest, etc.) to my microsd card. I have searched and searched and there is no option on where to save these apps. It has 8gigs of storage on the phone, so it's not a problem.........I just prefer to save everything to the sd card. Other than that, it is an awesome phone. You definately need a heavy duty case because the phone is very thin.....but i'm rough on phones, so that might not affect anyone else.", "Date": "December 18, 2013"}, {"Title": "I'm lovin' it!", "Author": "Cody Amador", "ReviewID": "R22UES2EL15Z9U", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I love this phone!

The reason why I say this is that the phone as stock comes with Android 2.3.6 which is basically useless in today's world. A lot of the popular apps are not fully supported by Android versions 4.0 or less. If you're willing to root and modify the phone you can get cyanogenmod 10.1 on it updating to 4.1.2 which gives you Android 4.1.2 jelly bean. What's great about that is that you get more control over your phone by modifying the CPU governor allowing for better battery life, better application compatibility and best of all, Google Now integration. I honestly cannot use an Android phone without google now. The voice control to set events, reminders, alarms get voice response from google search is so vital. I would recommend this phone if you are willing to root.", "Date": "June 5, 2014"}, {"Title": "a good phone", "Author": "Patricia L.

Nothing happened. I tried several times, holding the power button at variable lengths of time, but still the phone would not turn on. Despite the aggravation, I am also disappointed.
