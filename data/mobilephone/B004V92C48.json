Cox", "ReviewID": "R2B36T7GDZPUO7", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "It is quite difficult for the lay-person to figure out this \"will it work on AT&T; 3G\" thing. As another reviewer stated, the phone as advertised will not work on AT&T; 3G. However, the phone I purchased is actually sold through Wireless Experts. A day after the order was submitted, I received an email from Wireless Experts asking me to call them. I called and was informed asked if my intention was to use this phone with AT&T;, to which my reply was, Yes. The person at Wireless Experts told me the difference between the phones--which basically Amazon lists, but if you don't know what to exactly look for, then you won't know the difference (as I didn't). So, Wireless Experts upgraded my order to a Nexus S that is compatible with AT&T;'s 3G network--and a white one at that!About the phone, as the title of the review states, it is a great phone. The lack of a MicroSD card slot is really not as bad as what I thought it would be. The majority of files I would put on the phone would be music and pictures -- movies are reserved for my tablet. The phone is easily root-able as well as being easy to unlock the bootloader. If rooting your phone is your thing, and you happen to want to adjust processor speed, one thing I found out while using the SetCPU app (my use is for down-clocking the processor when the screen is off to help save battery) -- well, if you set a profile to down-clock the processor for screen off, DO NOT set the processor to its lowest setting in the profile settings. Doing so will cause your phone not to come back on when you attempt to turn the screen back on and you will have to remove and reinsert the battery to get the phone to come back on. I initially thought I had a defective phone and actually had an RMA set to return the phone, when I found out this little item by accident -- but at the right time! If you use the app, set the processor to 400MHz (400000 on the slider).The rest of the phone is standard Google fare. If you've had any Android phone before this, then this one is no different except for the fact that there is no manufacturer apps or user interface on the phone -- just plain Android, and I like that.

Ironically, I would have been very happy to get t-mobil phones.Looking closer at the web page, I realize now that the description fits the t-mobile phone, but that the model number is incomplete. The correct model numbers are GT-I9020T (t-mobil) and GT-I9020A (AT&T;). The web page shows only GT-I9020, i.e., the suffix was dropped. Perhaps this was not accidental.I just filled out my return request, and I am still waiting for the response. I will update this review with more details on how this goes. I suspect that there next move will be to dupe me into the t-mobil version with cheap LCD screen (not the advertised Super Amoled screen).By the way, I have owned the t-mobil version of the Nexus S for more than a year.

I can't review the phone since I returned it the next day, never even attempting to use it. My rating reflects my experience with the seller, HP Wireless. One star is too high, but that's the minimum possible.The phone was advertised as new. To me that means never used, usually unopened, and everything the manufacturer originally packaged with the item is included. The box had obviously been opened before I received it. With so many sellers opening packaging, \"for inspection,\" whatever that means (well, we know what that means), I was willing to overlook the opened box. However, upon examining the contents, it was obvious this was not a new item. The battery door was not even included, the battery was some unknown non-OEM brand, and there were two sets of earphones, one definitely not OEM. Maybe they included the extra earphones so I wouldn't notice the missing battery door.Be very wary of third-party sellers. There's no way to tell which ones are crooks.

You might want to get yourself a nice little case if you ever drop the thing, as well as an additional charger (maybe a car charger) because this battery drains pretty fast. I might be able to go a full day with about 30% battery to spare at the end of the day, but that's ONLY when I sparingly use the device and listen to Google Play Music for roughly two hours or so.In spite of battery drain, I am immensely enjoying the phone. I love all of the Google services that are connected to the device; I love that when I brought it I was one of the few that had Android 4.0 Ice Cream Sandwich off the bat, and now I'm one of the FEWER that has Android 4.1 Jelly Bean. Now ironically, I'd be surprised if I get the next version of Android, because even with Google's \"Project Butter\", there is still a bit of lag within Chrome, as well as lag when I open and close a few apps. Most of the top notch Android phones these days have 1GB of RAM, and I certainly see the necessity of that as 512MB of RAM (which this phone has) can cause some hiccups on streaming playback which is a nuisance, but hasn't soured me on both the Android and phone experience.Quite frankly, when going for an Android device - either high end or low end - I'd have to recommend to do your research on the pros and cons of what you are looking for. I say this because even though I'm enjoying this phone, many have said that I also have the \"patience of Job (biblical character)\", and I could see the frequent \"pops\" during music streaming playback greatly annoying a listener. Also, if you're not deeply ingrained in many of Google's services, you might find it hard to enjoy it or even switch from another service (such as iOS/Apple). Personally, I came from an iPhone 3GS and an iPad, but it was a seamless transition because Google+ backs up all of my photos, all 80GB of my music is on Google Play, and fortunately many of the apps I used on iOS are either on Google's Play Store or there is an Android alternative. I'm not sure if I would recommend this - or any Android phone - to my parents just yet. My biggest concern is the battery drain and I'd have to research a phone that can last a full day without major drain; and that is the key for any person shopping for Android - RESEARCH.I don't know if I'll have this phone by this time next year - hopefully I'll be able to afford the latest Nexus coming out at the end of 2012; or maybe the Galaxy Nexus will be just as wise of a purchase in 2013 as the Nexus S was for me this year in 2012.
