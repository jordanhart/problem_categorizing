{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Great Phone", "Author": "Crusher17", "ReviewID": "R2W24VGSQIGWZT", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I was one of those guys still carrying around a flip phone.  I liked the idea of a smart phone, but I didn't want to be like most people and walk around all day like some idiot with some huge device in my hand.  Also, as I man, I don't want to carry a purse.  I needed something small to fit in my pocket and this phone is it.  Even better, I was able to find a prepaid service with 2 cent a minute calls (LycaMobile if anyone is interested) and since the phone is unlocked I can use free wifi for calls and data in most places.  My phone bills are less than $10 / month!  The battery life has been good.  Camera is fine just for viewing on the phone itself, but you wouldn't be printing and framing anything from this phone-- the resolution is only 2mp.  For those new to Android, it takes some putzing to get things just right with all the settings/options, but not that big of a deal.  Great phone!", "Date": "October 16, 2013"}, {"Title": "Great small phone", "Author": "Allan Cantor", "ReviewID": "R1NXDCW99JVNE2", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Everything I was looking for in a phone. Small so fits easily in pocket, loud enough to hear, good battery life (a couple days), Android 4, good screen.

The s5301 comes with more memory ( 4g ),  works great with my carrier ( telcel ). Good phone, highly recommended if you want a cheap phone with 4g memory and android ice cream sandwich.", "Date": "May 6, 2013"}, {"Title": "Samsung Galaxy Pocket Plus S5301", "Author": "Andranik Araratyan", "ReviewID": "R1I3ONEHZOJCRI", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I have no experience of using it, because I had to return it. Just want to warn you to pay attention to the fact that many sellers are advertising S5301, but actually sending S5301L instead. The difference is 3G band (850 / 1900 instead of 900 / 2100). If this does matter for you better contact the seller before placing an order and make sure what they really sell under the name of \"S5301\" model.", "Date": "October 1, 2013"}, {"Title": "Hard-to-find Pocket Smartphone Is Right Size for Comfort and Convenience", "Author": "zci", "ReviewID": "R2NIE6V3IS520Z", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "In the USA market it is difficult to find a small smartphone that comfortably fits in pockets. The prevailing sentiment seems to be bigger is better, and the phones just keep increasing in size. On Samsung's North American site the S5301L is unlisted. To find information about it (such as the instruction manual to download), you have to go to Samsung's Latin America site (http://www.samsung.com/latin_en/consumer/mobile-phones/mobile-phones/smartphone/GT-S5301ZILTTT-support). So for those interested in this device, know that Samsung markets the phone for use in countries outside USA.Very happy that I kept looking and found this particular phone. It's a big upgrade from an old flip phone that I used primarily because of its convenient size. This unlocked version is easy to activate with Ptel's prepaid service, and smooth connectivity is likely with any GSM network carrier.For me Android 4.0.4 Ice Cream sandwich is plenty powerful. It's an API level 15 in the Android chain (current Android version is 4.4 KitKat, Level 19), so this phone's OS is still a recent generation. Samsung's S5301 release was 2012.The $100 price is a great value. After shopping extensively and comparing the devices offered by many prepaid carriers, this unlocked phone offers much more for far less than any of the so-called \"specials\" you'll find in the stores of major carriers such as AT&T; and T-Mobil, as well as MVNO's like Cricket, Ptel, TracFone, etc.As far as features, advise that you do your own research. Numerous Samsung and Google apps can be downloaded. Haven't used the 2 MP camera or video recorder yet, but it's enough for me to know it's there when needed.Only drawback for me is keys on the virtual keyboard are compact and I was making a lot of errors with finger-pad input. I switched to a stylus, which is less convenient, but far much more efficient.Equipped my device with optional accessories, a 16GB microSDHC card (up to 32GB can be added) and a case. The S5301L surface is smooth and shiny; I like the feel of the Einzige slim-fit protective case that I bought.", "Date": "November 21, 2013"}, {"Title": "Excellent equipment and good performance.", "Author": "M.
