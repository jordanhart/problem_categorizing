Much to my shock when I went to put the T-Mobile SIM card in it that would give me access to the new T-Mobile internationsl services, the phone rejected the SIM card, and the seller was rude about accusing me of making a mistake. And failed to ever admit that it was a glaring marketing bait-and-switch that his listing would come up when I marked Unlocked as my first level search key, AND the listing contained a discussion of the benefits of unlocked phones.Not wanting to be further abused by and obvious bully, I ceased discussion after I inquired about fast and inexpensive ways to save the wasted purchase for my European trip, and he was not well armed to handle that question, other than to warn against a significant number of fraudulent websites in that space.I still feel the listing was overly deceptive by not being screened by the primary search key, and for caring the collaborating discussion about the benefit of unlock phones, but more appalling was the seller's defensive and bullying attitude. Had he instead been eager to assist an inexperienced buyer to a quick solution, he would have won me over to telling my friends about him, but not in the way I tell them about him today.I was completely unsatisfied, but gave 2 stars to concede that had I had more experience and not been in such a hurry, I could have avoided ordering this product by mistake, by noticing the things he was immediately prepared to pointed out (because this had happened before??? then fix the way the listing is screened for major categories such as Unlocked) about the listings for the product I was actually after.", "Date": "February 8, 2014"}, {"Title": "Love all the features except the phone", "Author": "Tippy65", "ReviewID": "RNKPNMU7YKW2Y", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I have finally moved into the 21st C and signed up for a data plan, the lowest, of course.  Anyway, I have an iPad and iPod, so I know how an iPhone works, and I like it's \"i\" features, except the phone.  I don't know how other smart phones work, but I don't like that it takes several steps to make a call.  You have to type in your security code, get out of the app you have open, open the phone app, and then either find the number you want to call in your favorites, recent calls, or you dial the number.  I miss my speed dial on my \"dumb phone.\"  I wish you could use the device as a phone without having to open an app first.  I'm sure I'm supposed to be using Siri to make my dialing experience better, but I don't always have the Cellular turned on and many times I want to dial the phone silently without making a voice command.  I like the iPhone enough overall, though, not to give it a 3 star rating.", "Date": "April 29, 2014"}, {"Title": "Great", "Author": "Rachel ebert", "ReviewID": "REZDUW75F3K9N", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Fantastic.
