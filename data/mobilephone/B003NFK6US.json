{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Good phone for someone who doesn't need Data", "Author": "gadget_geek", "ReviewID": "R13SUDWDCHNH8K", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I bought this for my wife, who needs a simple phone that can make and receive calls, send and receive text messages, and play her favorite MP3 in addition to the ubiquitous FM Radio. This phone fulfills all those needs, and still has more to offer with 3G and Bluetooth support. The User interface is quite simple and yet looks cool. The candy-bar phone isn't too big or thick and fits well in your denim's pockets. There is just one minor thing which we don't quite like - the keypad. Its a single sheet of metal and its kinda difficult to press. We really need to press very hard in order to punch the numbers/letters. Other than that, a great device.", "Date": "June 21, 2010"}, {"Title": "Works overseas, in countries that support the GSM band ranges this phone has", "Author": "Bruce C Huang", "ReviewID": "RE3ED46EPOIVL", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I just returned from a trip to Asia, visiting 2 countries.  I did research to ensure this phone is supposed to have the bandwidth to support the wireless spectrums used by those 2 countries.  Since the phone was already unlocked, I simply purchased a SIM local to the country, pop the SIM in, and activated the SIM/phone #.  Wholla!  Works like a charm.  Called local to the country and back to USA.  Sound quality is crystal clear.  A friend could not even tell I was almost half way around the world when we chatted.The back case is a bit tough to open initially.  The back cover will only slide downwards for a few millimeters, where then you can lift the cover to access the battery and the SIM slot.  After the first couple of times, the stickiness wears off.You can then go to the Nokia website to download their Ovi Suite software, where you can transfer data between your phone and computer via USB cable.It would have been nice (would have been willing to pay a little more) for the vendor to have included the USB data/charger cable with the phone.  I had to locate and purchase it separately on a different website.The one weakness of the phone is that there is no quick way to change volume without taking the phone away from the ear.", "Date": "October 14, 2010"}, {"Title": "Frustrating", "Author": "Peditab", "ReviewID": "R2J9MONZVXNARD", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "Pros:* The phone has a clean and simple design. The navigation menu isn't cluttered like most other phones these days.* The call quality is decent, and the screen is bright.* Bluetooth works as it should.CONS... Here we go...* The battery life is sub-par. An hour-long call is enough to bring the battery life down to half-charge. One of the methods the manual offers to conserve battery life is to lower the brightness of the display. The thing is, YOU CAN'T. There is NO OPTION ANYWHERE in the display menu or any other area to control the brightness of the screen (and it is bright).* There is no way to control the size and layout of the time and date on the main screen. This is especially annoying when you want to gaze at the lovely wallpaper you install. The only way around this is to hide the clock and the date completely.* The phone does not come with its own USB to connect to the PC. This is important, because you (supposedly) NEED to update the software on this phone when you get it or you will run into problems like being unable to receive and send multimedia text messages. The Nokia website states that you can update directly from the phone itself but only with some models. Apparently, they decided not to have that convenience with the 2730, so the only way to update is through a PC connection. Of course, you can't use just any usb connector. I have no idea what this particular inlet model is called but I took a picture of it and will post it in the product photos.I currently am unable to send or receive multimedia messages and had to work it out with AT&T; for quite a while to come up with a solution, which we didn't. The multimedia messages menu won't even allow me to mess around with the Configuration Settings to configure my service provider. My only option is to install the update and hope for the best but, of course, it didn't come with the USB.If it weren't for these issues, I would have given it four stars.", "Date": "November 22, 2010"}, {"Title": "OK Basic Phone", "Author": "Ryzeldorf \"Ryzeldorf\"", "ReviewID": "RIHQ1H44TG8Y6", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "After using the phone for a week now I thought it time to post a review. I ordered direct from Nokia for ninety-nine bucks and found a code for free shipping. I am using the phone on the T-Mobile network.First off reception and call quality is great. It paired easily with my Plantronics Blue Tooth earpiece. The battery life seems great to me. I make about 10 calls a day totaling an hour or so. I have not reduced the battery by a single bar. So I'd say that's pretty good. If you want a bare bones candy bar phone this is an excellent choice.On the negative side, there is no way to access 3G/4G speed for the web on this phone. It needs to be pre-configured when built to accomodate this and T-Mobile does not have the ability to go beyond simple GPRS web speed which is SLOW. So DO NOT buy this phone to access the web on T-Mobile.Overall a solid choice for a no frills phone. Very light and simple to use.UPDATE 2.18.11: I've been using the phone daily for a month now and I love it. Very reliable, cannot drain the battery and has rock solid reception.", "Date": "January 11, 2011"}, {"Title": "Great little phone.", "Author": "George", "ReviewID": "R1M9CL3LVRY0TU", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Call quality is great for me and the person I'm calling. Speakerphone quality is excellent. Reception is great on T-Mobile. Screen is small but gorgeous and the design is very sharp. This phone does what I want it to do and looks great doing it. Another thing to consider is that accessories (i.e. extra charger, car charger, hands free, etc.) are very reasonably priced compared to some other brands. I'll be heading to the UK soon and love that I'll be able to use this phone there as well.My previous phone was an iPhone. It was great, but once the novelty wore off I found it was more than I really needed. I don't care for all the bells & whistles. I just want to make calls and send texts. Maybe snap a picture or two. This gets the job done fairly inexpensively.

I've since let the coverage expire, but here in the US I use the phone as a radio and mp3 player, it has truly great sound for a tiny device! You can listen to it for over 10 hours as a radio, which pleases me to no end, there aren't and weren't ever many portable radios with that capacity. It may also play that long as an mp3 player. And even though I seldom play games, I've played the ones on this phone. It also has a good series of alarms. It works great as a phone. The photos and video are OK, I'd say the video recorder is better than the camera. But for the sound quality and if you like listening to music without annoying, painful, un-natural, and hearing destructive headphones or earbuds, it's hard to beat this device. It took the smarties at Apple a while to realize an external speaker is a good idea, Nokia knew that right away. This is a superb device in all aspects and gives you everything you need, short of being a smart phone.", "Date": "March 23, 2012"}, {"Title": "Nokia", "Author": "Desmond  Crosby", "ReviewID": "R899AIHNU8N56", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Awesome!

Jewett", "ReviewID": "RRJPW6TNIG390", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Pros: Price ($90). Decent audio quality.  Good reception.  Bright, high resolution screen (small, however), the GPS map software actually works. (But it needs extra hardware.  See below.  Voice recorder and camera are functional.  Does not come with the AT&T; ringtone/startup sound.Cons: Battery life is short.  Does get quite warm. Does not support large memory cards (I read 4GB max. I'm using a 2GB card).  It's not an iphone.  I would not dream of using this to browse the web or send email.  Calendar has a loud irritating alert sound.I've had it for 5 months.  It works perfectly for what I wanted.  It is incomparably better than the chintzy samsung freebie I had before.  As for the GPS, the maps are stored offline, so the GPS feature does not require an expensive data plan.  The OVI PC software you need to download the maps is actually not that bad.  You must have a 2GB memory card and a separate bluetooth GPS receiver, and a special cable to connect the PC to the phone USB CA101 Connectivity Cable.  For the GPS receiver, I'm using a Holux M-1000 32 Channel Wireless Bluetooth GPS Receiver, but any newer holux bluetooth GPS receiver would probably work too.", "Date": "November 6, 2011"}, {"Title": "vijayalbert", "Author": "spidy", "ReviewID": "R1VOCXAELR9T49", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "good one , i already have this mobile - so i ordered one for my father .

The phone itself looks good, however it feels a little cheap with the plastic housing. My wife has a similar Nokia phone, however her housing is made out of metal. I didn't think much of it until now. The phone slipped out of my hand and hit the ground from around 4 feet. Not sure if it was an unlucky fall, but the screen broke on the inside. You can't tell that it's broken, unless the backlighting is on. The phone is completely useless to me. The whole thing is really strange, given that, at one time or other, I've dropped all my cell phones. The worst thing that has ever happened was the battery cover popping off. I seems that with this phone, the screen is super sensitive.

The phone does NOT have GPS as listed. Straight from the product manual: \"Your device does not have an internal GPS antenna. To use applications that require a GPS connection, use a compatible external GPS receiver (accessory sold separately). Pair the GPS receiver with your device using Bluetooth wireless technology.\" This is, obviously, useless. [Update: Because of this, Amazon offered a 20% credit or returning the phone for a full refund.]Also, like other users have reported, we were unable to receive MMS messages, until updating the firmware to the latest version (v10.45). This was particularly problematic for us, as our service provider's welcome message was in MMS format. However, to update the software you need to find and purchase a Nokia CA-101 data cable, which is not included (as others have stated) and download and install Nokia Ovi Suite (the Nokia Device Update or Nokia PC Suite software packages will not provide updates for this phone).UPDATE:Upon our return to the U.S. I contacted Amazon to discuss the incorrect product description re. GPS. We were offered the choice of a 20% credit and keeping the phone or returning the phone for a full refund. That is good customer service!
