{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Good, simple phone", "Author": "Judy Hudgens \"Voracious Reader\"", "ReviewID": "R1C0RKD6MOSRSO", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "My 90+ year-old mother was having trouble with the phones I had handed down to her as I upgraded.  Each time she got a better phone, she had more trouble figuring out how to get it to do simple things (like answer a call!)  So I went to Amazon and did a search for a simple phone, and found this one.  It came with a desktop charger and I put it right by her bed, so she always had it right beside her.  Her hearing was very bad even with hearing aids, but at least she was able to let me know if she needed something.  The phone had a lot more capability than she needed but looked more like a 'phone' to her and solved the problem totally.", "Date": "January 13, 2013"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": null, "Features": null, "Name": null, "ImgURL": null, "ProductID": "B005C33L42"}}
