{"Reviews": [{"Title": "One of the worst \"Smart\" Phones Available", "Author": "A. Netzel", "ReviewID": "R2SNEMYT2I0E33", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "Here's what I've had to deal with, with this phone. Originally, I had this phone for 1 year before the LCD screen decided to have a freak out and project an array of tie-die colours whenever it felt like. At first I took it to a couple privately owned local stores to have it checked out, they couldn't figure it out. Then I took it to a T-Mobile store and they were flabbergasted as well since they couldn't find any damage. Luckily since this happened 2 days before the warranty expired, T-Mobile took it back and replaced it for me. This latest one, I've had since then and it's still driving me crazy. With the previous phone, it shut itself off only about 4 times and erased all its memory (except for on the SIM card and SD card). Now, it's approx. once every week or two that it'll restart itself and erase all the data stored on the phone. T-Mobile says there's nothing they can do about it except for either offer me a discount on a new phone or replace this one with ANOTHER Sidekick Slide. I've checked online and it seems the vast majority of Slides have this problem, which would explain why T-Mobile no longer sells them.So overall, I would suggest to avoid this phone at all costs. It's just not worth the hassle of losing the data and not being able to prevent it.Sidenote: Yes, if you have the Sidekick Data plan, your data is backed up on Microsoft's servers. But after their last screw up, would you really trust them? And for those of you who don't know about it, Microsoft upgraded their servers that handled the backup data for the Sidekicks. However, they apparently had a fatal error which wiped out most of it. After a couple months, they finally recovered SOME of the lost data.", "Date": "April 26, 2010"}, {"Title": "GOOD PHONE FOR A GREAT PRICE!", "Author": "Matt", "ReviewID": "R1SN7R76IXTNMS", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I was very concerned when reviewing this products other reviews that it would not be any good, but to my surprise it turned out fine. It is easy to use and not too big or small and the keyboard keys are just far enough apart for people like me that are all thumbs! Best bargin out there if your money is tight and you need a  phone with keyboard for texting. It is a bit outdated looking, but if you dont mind not being \"In Style\" and owning a phone without a touchscreen, it is a perfectly good phone.", "Date": "February 18, 2011"}, {"Title": "bad phone; sidekick sldie", "Author": "Mae", "ReviewID": "R2478670F5UHJJ", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "Worst phone ever!! I had this phone for more than a month now and till this day I still get the \"wait 48 hours after purchase to activate.\" always block my phone!!! Had to find a way to by pass it!! Always tell me got new message really don't. No alarm!! Doesn't read my memory card. Display screen doesn't come on sometimes jus gives me black screen. So hard to take out battery. Can't save my contacts or pictures cause it ends up deleting it. I don't know how but it does. Everything is wrong with this phone....! DO NOT PURCHASE THIS PHONE.

I sent the two bad ones back and received the two new ones appx. 7 days later.  Out of the two replacements, one worked and one didn't.  I was very frustrated by this time.  After about a week, I received a call tag to return the one because I refused to pay shipping again.  I have not gotten my refund has of yet for the damaged one.  My concern was, if a customer got bad phones the first time that would not even power on, would you not be sure to check them out before sending them out again?  I was very unhappy and still am not happy with the 3 that was kept.  They won't receive picture messages.  I will never purchase an electronic item from the internet again.  I want to be able to put my hands on it and return it promptly if something is wrong.  Not happy with the entire situation and the way it has been handled.", "Date": "March 7, 2011"}, {"Title": "important!!!!!!read!!!!!", "Author": "schnockerfan", "ReviewID": "R3PUVYWLCGVYAI", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "ok, so yeah, this phone looks like something you want. so i ordered the phone and every time i went to send a text, the phone would shut off and erase all of the data on it, (texts, notes, info, contacts, emails, and more!)i looked into the problem, and the reason is t mobile doesn't support this phone anymore. if you are a person who sends lots of texte, and cant remember phone numbers, DON'T GET THIS PHONE!!!!!!!!!", "Date": "February 19, 2011"}, {"Title": "Good Temp Phone", "Author": "peenkzero", "ReviewID": "RMRHPXE4XP5VE", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "I just got mine in today, it took me a minute to figure out the set up, and I'm well aware that data plans aren't supported on it, but I didn't mind because I don't have a data plan at the moment. I broke my phone and needed a temporary one, and figured 40 bucks was just a steal. And I have to admit, I'm slightly in love with this phone. It's cute and quick to learn (I'm an anti user manual kinda gal). I don't know that I would recommend it as a permanent phone, it does take a long time to turn on and the set up of the actual interface could have been better. The speaker is quiet, but I don't make phone calls very often, so that doesn't bother me. Obviously there are better phones out there, but a $40 temp phone isn't bad and it's better than the phone I had before.Edit: April 17 (Not even a week of use)The phone is still fun to use, but I've discovered problems with it. It froze up the other day, so I took out the battery. This resulted, for some reason, in all my saved data being erased/deleted/removed/lost.I also misinterpreted the \"no more data plan\" part of this phone. It's not that you lose data functions, it's that- seriously- you won't have any data on your phone. No phone numbers, pictures, calendar events, etc.I wouldn't grade the phone as a piece of crap or anything, just for that, all phones have problems and draw backs. It happens.

I had doubts form the other reviews. i got it in 2 days with the amazon prime. i wanted a new phone cause i hate touch screen phones... they are so hard to text with... i got this phone cause it was sooooo cheep. i got it in 2 days. everything came new surprisingly... and it works veryyy wellllll. I turned off all the sounds and lights cause they got annoying after 2 seconds. i have had the phone for 2 hours now. hopefully everything goes well. i will post another if i find anything wrong with it. so far it has been very nice.-----they don't tell you this but  when u turn it on a screen pops up and says you dont have a GPRS APN number thing....dont worry ...u need to call t mobile to activate the phone.  it takes 2 seconds but dont worry if the screen pops up and says that...

When i was scrolling up and down, if my fingers accidentally brushed the green call button it would call the last person i called. contacts and game scores and texts get erased if the battery falls out. hard to turn on at first.  i recommend NOT GETTING THIS PHONE. also the layout is different than most phones so it took me months to interpret completely. that was a waste of my time. NEVER BUY THIS PHONE!!!!!!!!!!!!! it sucks. hard to fit comfortably in pockets and it fell out all of the time. thank god i lost it. that was the best part of that phone. it fell out of my pocket and i lost it. hahahaha! good riddance!!!!!!! 1 star is a compliment.
