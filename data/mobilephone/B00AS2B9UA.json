Clean ESN, phone in very good cosmetic condition. Brought phone to Verizon last night to get a SIM card. Battery took a full charge and has lasted 12 hours so far. At this point, I am pretty impressed with Chubbiestech. I am considering purchasing an additional phone and looks like this is the place to go!", "Date": "November 5, 2013"}, {"Title": "Poor quality", "Author": "Mary Groesbeck", "ReviewID": "R46OQPNJ39XOV", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "My husband's phone toppled from his pocket to the floor and the \"gorilla glass\" screen shattered--it was even in a protective case!
