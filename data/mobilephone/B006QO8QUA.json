The first phone that they sent me stopped working after 2 days and I asked for a replacement. They did send a replacement without any hassle although it did take twice as long as promised.  Now that I have the second phone it cannot even be activated with Verizon since it's a 'prepaid' phone that cannot be added to an existing account, it has to be used for 6 months with a prepaid plan first. So at this point, my only option is to also return this second phone.I'd advise people not to deal with PagePlusDeals.

Received 2 brand new phones but one had a bad speaker.  I asked for a replacement which they were really quick about.  So that part I was pleased.  But the replacement that came was obviously a refurbished phone.  It had scratches/marks on it and either the phone itself was obviously used, or it was refurbished with obviously used covers.  The whole situation really ticks me off that they would try to pull something shady like this.  (2)I am amazed how much they neglect the packing of this phone.  It comes in a box and the phone isn't secured with foam or anything.  It's loose in the Verizon box.  If you shake it you can feel and hear it bounce around.  I have no idea what they are thinking when packing an electronic device and shipping it like this.  I packed the return way better than the ones that came to me.  I guess you get what you pay for.  It would be way more expensive to go into a verizon store and buy this same phone.

Outer LCD Screen3. Bluetooth for wireless headsets.4. SpeakerPhone5. Good Coverage6. Cheap calls if calling other Verizon members ($1 a day on days used).Con's:1. No external memory for camera2. Can't use bluetooth to transfer photos to another device.3. Have to use Internet to back up photos.4. Will charge by USB, but can't transfer data by USB.5. Verizon's prepaid rates are a bit pricey for the moderate to heavy users.6. Can't buy a texting plan (text rate varies by your selected daily plan)Overall, I'd recommend this if you're an occasional user.  At the time I used the phone, there were 3 different daily plans.  $2 plan, $1 plan and 25 cents a minute plan.  $2 gave you unlimited calling to any number in the United States and (from what I remember) 2 cents for every text sent or received (picture message costs more).  $1 gets unlimited mobile to mobile calling with other networks being 10 cents a minute.  I think this plan provided text messages at 10 cents a piece.  Lastly, 25 cents a minute plan explains itself.  25 cents a minute, regardless of who you call or how long you're on the phone for.  I think texts are also 25 cents a text on that plan as well.I'm pretty there's also a $50 unlimited plan as well, but I'm not sure since I haven't used Verizon in years.", "Date": "March 21, 2013"}, {"Title": "I Like It", "Author": "Don Garmon", "ReviewID": "R2VI95FUO9GK03", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I Like The Phone It Has Work Fine So Far The Only Thing I Dont Like About It Is The Ring Volum Is Not Very Loud If When Around A Lot Of Noise You Cant Here It  Don", "Date": "January 26, 2013"}, {"Title": "Not New, but still happy", "Author": "Todd \"Todd\"", "ReviewID": "R2QQZ1YUM1ZRUJ", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I bought this phone through Proline Distribution.

For the price I paid, I'm not sure I care too much about the minor marks and am happy with the phone.  I'm including this info in the product review because the price was 1/3 the normal retail price and should be taken into consideration when purchasing this phone at this price point.For the phone itself, it was purchased for my 9 year old son to keep with him in the event of an emergency.  For what we wanted the phone to be... small, light, reliable, long battery life, good reception, easy to use - it fits the bill quite well!  We had an older version of this phone that went through the washing machine.  We (wife, son and I) were very happy with that phone and wanted another just like it.

It has sort of a bubble under the screen so I figured someone else had returned this one and that was why there was no box. I have already had to go to Verizon to have all of my data transfered to the new phone twice and I'm tired of screwing around with Big Box Bonanza.
