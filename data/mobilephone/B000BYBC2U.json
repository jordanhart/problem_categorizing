From what I've seen from the last phones I've owned this phone can take a lot of damage I've dropped it several times, and to my suprise it still works efficently.  I've read the other reviews talking about this phone and one said that their atenna was falling off which I believe they were talking about a diffrent phone because the atenna on this model is apart of the phone. Another thing I like which is probably a personal prefrence is that you can record with this phone and use that record as your ring, that way you don't have to spend money on purchasing ring tones on-line.  I hope this review helps you for finding a phone that fits you.", "Date": "September 20, 2006"}, {"Title": "Do not waste your time with this phone", "Author": "B. Kent", "ReviewID": "R6MCHGYACH2QJ", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "Unless you are only planning on making occasional phone calls on this device without holding many contacts or personalizing the ringtone, this phone is not for you, especially at this price.  The lack of internal memory prevents you from saving more than a handful of games, pictures, ringtones, or text messages without causing it to lock up due to a \"lack of internal memory\".  There are many better phones available at better prices, especially if you are a T-Mobile To Go customer.  If you do use To Go, purchase a terrible phone (like this, only cheaper) for the SIM card, then upgrade to an Unlocked Phone on Amazon.  You won't be nearly as frustrated (unless you try to download from T-Zones, which can be a hassle, but I would rather not have this phone and not be able to download) as I have been, wasting my money on downloads only to discover that they won't fit in, even when I have barely anything on my phone.  Unless customization and having control over your phone (instead of the other way around) aren't for you, run away NOW!", "Date": "November 26, 2006"}, {"Title": "SOMETHING OLD THAT IS NEW", "Author": "S.

With all this plus the great Nokia operating system with advanced voice-activated dialing and menu features, you'll be happy you chose the new Nokia 6101!The Nokia 6101/6102 is truly one of a kind.

With this phone, you need to have the earpiece at a certain angle to hear a conversation.  Going the other way, the microphone's in a weird location that maximizes wind noise.  Many people commented on the poor sound quality when we spoke over this phone.So it's not good for a conversation.  What else about can I say this phone?How about you cannot connect to it using the cable that's supposed to be supported?  Try this: Google \"Nokia 6101 Enhancement Not Supported\".  Message boards are filled with people who are unable to connect to the phone from their PC.Another complaint is that the vibration is very soft and easily missed.  My old LG had a strong vibration that you could feel when the phone was in your pocket.  I have missed many calls from this phone due to the weak vibration.The only compliment I can pay this phone is that I like the \"spell ahead\" feature that figures out likely words you are trying to type when text messaging.  That worked better than I expected.", "Date": "October 21, 2006"}, {"Title": "This phone gives Nokia a bad name...", "Author": "S.

It's poorly made, the interface is archaic, and it has literally NO memory for anything but text messages. That was the one good thing about the phone, I could store up to 300 messages at once. The gallery only held about 15 pictures at any given time, and anytime someone sent you a picture, you'd have to delete some from your gallery to even view it. The screen went blank in 3 months, and the darn thing had a habit of turning itself off whenever it wanted. I never abused the phone or dropped it any more than the average owner, but from the get go it was just a piece of...I'd been pleased with every Nokia I'd ever purchased before, so to have such a disappointment in this one was rather shocking.
