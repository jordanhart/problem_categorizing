I wrongly assumed it would be in the same place. A feature i really wantedyes. thats pretty much the only thing bugging me.what i will have to email Blu about is why it says 6mps in the camera settings when its says 12mp in specs. i thought i was taking blurry pics but it needs a sec or two to focus but pics seem okay so far.now, i'm a tech noob. i can't tell you benchmarks etc...as it don't understand it i only can tell you how it feels to meit has a really nice weight. my previous primary phone was a xperia mini pro much love for it but it needs repairs and i'm tired of carrying two phones for two different carriers. that has a great weight to it also. i have small hands but the LOM feels great in my hand and i can hold it with confidence.screen is great ! 5\" i thought might be alittle intimidating but its not. this phone is really responsive. i believe i understand what LAG is and its not noticable to me. i haven't tried any games as i have a tablet for that. with just 4gigs  games are not a priority. watched a short clip from one of my favorite gamers on youtube and it was really really enjoyable to watch.speaking of before any added apps or up days internal storage read TOTAL SPACE 2.48GB AVAILABLE 2.33GB after i installed just the Facebook App it read TOTAL SPACE 2.48GB  AVAILABLE 2.20GB. i survived the 4XXMB on my xperia i can definitely survive and monitor the space on this phonethe notification light is yellow. I really wanted the blue colour but the white was the last one they had in stock but its not bad. sliver back.audio via headphones is LOUD. yes its LOUD. haven't created a playlist yet but i don't think it will be too hard to do.this uses two MINI SIM not MICRO SIM and goes in the battery areathe back is hard to get off. i like that ! i have missed metal on phones.....wifi was easy to hook up. i don't have high data speeds so i cannot comment on that.camera is gonna take getting use to how to handle it. a hand thingy was motioning something but i have no idea what it was really pointing ati am struggling to find out if i can customize my ring and message tones and if i can have different tones for each sim. so far i have customized one ringtone but not seeing anything with and option to pick a simall standard Blu accessories came in the box. headphones screen protector usb cord wall plug silicon case and useless manual. quite please to say i have noticed no spelling errors in the manual. years ago i bought a blu tv and well......it was a messthe silicone  case fits well. the physical buttons are responsive. only trouble so far was trying to take the screen shot holding the power and volume down button but it just takes some tries to figure it out how to do it without dropping the phoneyou can swap the icons on the bottom screen. the keypad icon was on the left and i moved it to the right. love that optionthe battery was about 50% when powered on. 9hrs 34mins and 3s later is on 23%. trying to drain the battery before charging it but this puppy is not making it easy. the screen brightness is all the way down as i prefer it but after using the camera running wifi and constantly poking and prodding this phone this battery is gonna last me much longer than my mini pro.i was surprised this did not fit too bad in my pocket. i had on skinny jeans today poked out alittle on top but felt goodwhy did i choose Blu ? i was skeptical after my first experience with the previous blu phone i had in 2011. alot of people told me they heard static when i called them. but after looking at alot of phones available in my area it came down the what specs i needed and price. Blu was the only mobile i could. i would of preferred 8GB to 4GB but its not a problem. I wish this was Gorilla Glass like the first Life One. i wanted something with battery life that would last a couple hours playing music. sure it would be nice that Gorilla Glass water proofing and all that really high end stuff but i am happy as it fills my needs so farBlu just really needs to step up and put out the correct information regarding specs and i would love a better support forums like Sony etc....have for support online. and of course, a better manual.clearly i will have to up date this review at another time after more use. giving it 3 stars for now until i can find out why my camera setting says 6mp.its only this week reviews on this phone have popped up. i've been searching for weeks to find some hands on info. its not technical but i hope this helps out a few questions you may have about this phone***3/30/2014 update***I BUMPED UP A STAR FOR THE GREAT BATTERY LIFE ! I am not a heavy app user but there are times i use the data an camera to upload pics to facebook. i have been fooling around with this camera trying to get use to it. had the data on for a couple hours. been texting alot. turned the brightness up for a couple hours as i was outside in the sun. checked the battery life and it read 65% after 8hrs 56m 23s. thats alot better than my mini pro. this is exactly what i wanted. for the days when i used the camera alot and having the data. battery life that lasted better than my other phonebtw the screen was just ok outdoors. nothing to write home about. it was readable most importantthe camera is taking some time to get use to. basically i am just touching buttons to see what they do. i took some great shots today. it works better in good lighting. pinch and zoom for zooming is new to me. the volume button is a shutter as well as the on screen one. you need to take note were your fingers go holding this in landscape as you will snap a picture or press the power button by accident. i would say the flash is average but i haven't used it muchi have still not added any apps other than facebook. i have set up the email client for email address. after some apps updated themselves and couple screenshots that saved on the phone, storage is now 1.99gb availablethis phone is gonna last me two days easy.i found ringtone folders etc...in the internal storage via File Mananger. i hope this means i can now customize my ring and messange tonesthere is not much i can add again until i've used the music playeri still don't know why the camera settings still says 6mp*****UPDATE 1/4/2014*****I received a reply from Blu about the camera settings that say it was 6mp*QUOTE* As for the megapixels of the camera, this is a file size issue.  Change the preview size from standard to 4:3 and it will allow you to use all 12 mega pixels! *UNQUOTE*also, they say the device is actually a 1.5 GHz processor !Rush Star Wireless replied to this same question and said its 1.3  :/ all i know is the phone works greatyou cannot select a ringtone for each simi have noticed their are no themes. however, for messaging, you can change the wallpaper for the messages you read.made a playlist and listened to it for hour and hour. battery life was good while it played. headphones are really long. felt comfortable. the mic an ear piece worked will when used. i've had no complaints about call qualityif you are not a big app users i'd recommend this phone.did i mention its LOUD ??? you won't miss calls or messages", "Date": "March 29, 2014"}, {"Title": "false features.", "Author": "anny del valle rodriguez rodriguez \"Anny R\"", "ReviewID": "R3QNJB8I4QIDWR", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I am very upset. buy a one life M and sent me a cell with different characteristics.

It is fast like most of smart phone on the market and the cheapest. But she doesn't like the fact that the one piece volume button and the power button are too reachable: the volume go to the higher or the lower level, the power button turns the phone ON or OFF easily by inadvertence. Finally the battery life can be better. After that it's a good phone.", "Date": "April 26, 2014"}, {"Title": "Great Phone, Great Price", "Author": "RDamery", "ReviewID": "RG7J998TN1IC6", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Love this phone.  Camera, screen, performance are all great.  One thing to note is that the case covers the volume button and is not cutout for buttons to protrude.  This made volume button extremely sensitive at first.  After a week of using the case loosened up and it works fine now.  APN settings for straight talk can be found online; that was the only issue with setup.  Great phone and will be better with kitkat as soon as it is released by BLU.", "Date": "June 9, 2014"}, {"Title": "Great phone, Silicon case pushes volumeUp", "Author": "Petman", "ReviewID": "R3AMGSLFUNWCI5", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Great phone as follows:---------------------------------Screen bright, clear, good color.

Can use mouse and wireless keyboard.Live MIDI, Guitar Tuner, NetFlix, YouTube, Kingston Office OK, Opera Browser, etc.Camera works fine. Not fully tested all options, though.For me, best features for price.Battery is ok.pROBLEM, but still giving it 5 stars:--------------------------------------------------------------------The provided silicon case fits perfectly, but it catches the volumeUp button and causes the volume to go all the way up, and also can press it and push volume up when phone is tossed lightly over a bed or sofa.Without the silicon case, volume and on-off buttons work perfectly. So, AM NOT USING the silicon case provided.=>I opted to cu-off with a very sharp knife slightly over-sized slots in the silicon case. this kept me from returning it.

The screen has the right resolution for the size and is bright enough also under the sun. Battery life isn't bad, of course if you don't keep open too many apps at the same time. CPU power is good and even it doesn't have the latest version of Android, it comes without any bloatware typical of (not only) cheaper chinese android phones.

Only thing i'd like to remark and that i can complaint about is poor images display wich are not exactly pixelated but seems like screen has troubles handling screen resolution, i think this is some poor \"driver\" stuff and that could be solved by manufacturer. I think is a good price/quality choice, i recommend.
