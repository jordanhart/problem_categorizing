Here's the good, and the bad in a nutshell.The Good:1. Size, weight.  This device is the same width as a Blackberry curve, and just slightly longer. Fits nicely in a pocket.  Also, it's not too heavy.2. Excellent Keyboard - Windows Mobile works excellently with an exposed keyboard.  Dial numbers quickly, write emails, even filter your music library quickly by typing letters.3. Plethora of features - Wifi, BT, GPS, a lot of customizable buttons, volume control buttons, and scroll wheel.  Gps works well (tried it with TomTom 6) and WIFI and BT both performed well.4. Speed - The device is snappy.  Coming from the AT&T; Tilt, it was a welcome experience to have a quick device again.5. Battery - At 1900 mAH who can ask for more?!The Bad:1. Phone call volume is low compared to most other devices I've used2. Too few backlight/brightness options. The middle setting is too bright, the lower is too low.In summary, if you need to write and respond to emails 40% of the time or more, then this is the device to get. You sacrifice screen size for more portability and productivity.  (Note that you don't sacrifice resolution -the screen is smaller, but the resolution is still 320x240)*** EDIT ***After using the device for several days, there seems to be an issue with power drain/battery life.  The PDA seems to drop roughly 5% of battery every hour with no use, and only AS Push active.  With moderate use, the device seems to lose roughly 10-13% per hour use.  Using the device the same way as I use my Tilt, wheras with the til I got roughly 12-14 hours of use, with the HP I get roughly 6-8.Also, I'm experiencing another strange occurence.  Using my 6GB microSDHC card, the device seems to lose its connection to the card when I turn it on, every so often.

I was pretty excited by how many features it had in such a small package: touch screen (small, but still useful), wifi, 3g, GPS, Windows Mobile 6.1, built-in keyboard, the list goes on...First off, I actually like Windows Mobile for its similarity to Windows on the desktop.  I tried a Nokia e71 with Symbian, and I found the user interface somewhat inconsistent between applications.  Windows Mobile apps usually follow a pretty standard way of doing menus and icons.  This Ipaq performed very well, though I have had other Windows Mobile devices which are sluggish.Next, the keyboard.  I found this Ipaq's keyboard suffers from one primary problem: the four-way navigation pad is too close to the top row of keys.  Time and time again I accidentally hit the \"down\" button when trying to hit the T or a Y.  Apart from that the keyboard was cramped but pretty useful.GPS:  I used Google maps which is a free download if your device doesn't come with it.  What an awesome program to have for free.  The program itself worked great, but it often took the Ipaq over one minute to acquire the GPS signal.  Sometimes it used cell phone towers to get my approximate location, so while it was tracking down the GPS signal the \"where am I\" dot on the map would jump all over the place.  Other times, it would not do this and would just wait and wait until it found the GPS signal to show me where I was.  There is some kind of application on the Ipaq (which I forget the name of) that lets you download additional GPS information from the internet so it is faster to acquire the GPS signal.  I ran this program numerous times but it did not seem to make a difference in how fast it locked onto the GPS.  Once it was locked on, it updated very quickly and very accurately.  Given that, GPS would be perfectly useful on this device if you already had it turned on before you started your trip.  Or, perhaps another pay-for-use mapping program would not have the same problem Google Maps did.Battery life: Other reviews have complained the battery life on this device is pretty short and that the battery gets hot while using the device (even when not charging).  I did find the battery pack got warm while on a call or using the PDA functions.  Battery felt on par with other smartphones I have owned (T-mobile MDA, Cingular 8525).  In other words: not very impressive, but good enough to get through one day.Last: In spite of these minor weaknesses, I really liked this phone.  Sadly, call quality was just not up to par.  I found I had to have the volume on maximum all the time, and the sound output seemed too grainy/staticky compared to other cell phones.  I decided that for the price of this phone, the sound quality should be nothing less than excellent, so I wound up returning it and going back to my incredibly-bulky-but-sounds-good Cingular 8525 (HTC TyTN).", "Date": "October 20, 2008"}, {"Title": "Great product", "Author": "German Corredor", "ReviewID": "R21Q2EAZ0Y9IE4", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This little guy is exactly what I hoped it would be.

Along with the 610 model, I was really excited for an iPAQ for the first time in several years.  After the 610 was cancelled for its U.S. release I started to get really worried that the 910 would follow its same fate.  After numerous delays it seemed as though the 910 would end up along side the 610.  Fortunately, that didn't happen.I got my 910 on Friday, July 11, only 2 days after ordering it.  Opening the box was almost like a child opening Christmas presents on Christmas Day.  The excitement was magnified after I actually got a chance to play with this beautifuly designed device.  First off, the screen, although a little small (2.46 inches) is beautiful as far as clarity and sharpness go.  Also, the form factor is just about as perfect as you can get.  It doesn't feel too small or too bulky; it's just right.  The back of the device has a surface that makes it difficult to lose your grip on it, almost as if it was covered in a slight fur.  I can't describe it any better than that and simply don't know what the actual name of the surface is, but whatever it is, it works well as far as helping users keep a good handle on it.I'm using it on AT&T; Wireless' Edge network and I've gotta say, this thing screams on it.  I've had extremely fast downloads and web browsing sessions using the 910.  The processor seems to handle multiple running apps well, as there is very little slow down or sluggish-ness when multi-tasking.  I had Internet Explorer, Word, Excel and text messaging running at once and the hand held's performance was still outstanding.The one thing, at this point, that I've got a bit of a problem with is the camera.  No, the camera doesn't have poor output of photos; it's quite the opposite, as the picture quality is very good.  The issue is the shutter on the camera is VERY slow to respond.  You have to keep your arms steady for, what seems like, an eternity (probably closer to 3 or 4 seconds) to make sure that any of your movements don't interfere with the photo's clarity.  The camera is 3MP so for a phone, that's really strong.  The 910c takes nice pictures, so long as you've got a steady hand that can deal with the shutter's delay.  Hopefully a driver will be released eventually that could rectify the issue (not sure if it's possible but here's to hoping).  If not, it's not necessarily a deal breaker but it is definitely something to consider.I haven't worked much with video using the camera but the limited time (maybe 15 minutes) I've had with that feature seems to indicate that there is a bit to be desired as far as photo qualtiy goes, mainly because of some noticeable pixelation.  The video is passable but I'd not say that the quality of the video is great; merely passable.The last point on the camera I'd like to make deals with a feature that allows you to snap your pictures/videos and upload them from your phone to Snapfish, HP's photo service.  I thought that was a really cool feature and because I have a Snapfish account (I sing the praises of Snapfish as much as I can because it is an outstanding service) this was a very good selling point for me.  I've used it to upload 20+ pictures in the day I've had it thus far and plan to use it extensively throughout the lifetime of my iPAQ 910c.Well, that's all I have to say about the 910c up to this point.  I'm going to continue to play around with this outstanding phone and hopefully learn more cool things to do with it.  I'd definitely reccomend this phone to anyone needing a powerful messaging device with a strong processor to help with heavy multi-tasking.", "Date": "July 12, 2008"}, {"Title": "Works well, but too quiet", "Author": "Thomas Minney", "ReviewID": "R3STMORJL0SPAZ", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "The phone works well and I have no problems with battery life, as I live in Ethiopia and don't use bluetooth, etc. What I want is easy interface with my Outlook (calendar and contacts) and the phone does this even better than my previous ipaq (h6300 series).

Unlocked units are the way to go! Pick your carrier and you are essentially a month to month contract. So what do you lose, nothing I am sick of two year locked in mobile contracts! Back to the 910, it does use the battery life quickly, however if one turns of Wifi, bluetooth and do not use the gps it lasts as well as any other phone I've had.Customer service, contrary to other reviews, for me has been outstanding! I left the house one morning and turned of the wifi. When I returned home could not get it to come back on. Longish story short. Called HP and the sent a new replacement to me free of charge when the wifi was determined to be defective.WM6.1 is far better than 2003 and no complaints about speeds!Specs state that the mini SD card is has a max of 4gigs, been using an 8gig with no problems.

I have quite a bit of experience with smartphones, primarily Windows Mobile.This phone has the potential to be nice, but is pretty weak when you consider the price. Because these do not have a carrier agreement, they are never available discounted, the cheapest you can get one right now is $350 for a used one, maybe $390 for almost new, $450 plus for brand new. Now I realize that is inline with other phone of this caliber, but this phone is just too QUIET. You can barely hear it ring, can't hear the notifications at all really. There is an app inside it to boost the volume, but anytime the phone reboots, it resets back to too quiet.It's just a waste of time and money for them to make a phone like this that you can't hear.For $150 you can get a tre 750, motorola q9h, t-mobile dash, 8525, tilt, etc. THey all have better volume then this.Besides that, the battery life is poor, and the processor even though is not real slow is not real zippy considering the battery useage and the price.For corporate use only, it's probably ok, but just barely. I mean if the company was paying for my phone, I might use this one.wifi works fine.Has a nice form-factor, a little cheap feeling build quality (but not too bad).I have found the q9h to be the best overall smartphone for me. Durable, LOUD enough. Nice rugged feel and good form factor. No touch screen though.If you want a Windows Mobile Phone with touch screen and qwerty on top, you have a few choices: ipaq 910, treo 750, imate 8502. The 8502 keyboard was a little too tight for me. The treo does not have wifi and alittle older, but a good choice because it has a carrier discount, which means the second-hand market you can find them for $100! It has everything this has but GPS and Wifi.It all depends on what is important to the user. For personal use, not that good because too quiet.

I like the touch screen. The handwriting function works well. The voice quality sounds good to me. The volume is not as loud as other phones, but I never have trouble hearing, even in noisy environments (I keep the volume turned all the way up).When it's working properly, it's a great phone. But it never seems to work for very long before it locks up and I have to reset it. I have to reset it 1 to 3 times a day.I also have bluetooth problems. My plantronics bluetooth headset that worked perfectly with my ipaq 510 does not work well with the 910. It works fine for making calls, but for some reason it does not work at all with the voice command feature and files played on the windows media player will not play through the headset.Another problem is the battery life. I had read complaints about the battery before I bought the phone, but I did not think it would be a problem for me because I do not use the phone much during the day. I use it for one or two personal calls a day and I briefly use ms word or excel. The battery does not make it through the day without recharging. I don't know how business users who make frequent calls, send/recieve emails etc. can get by with this phone. Another battery is available for this phone on the hp website that provides 60% longer life, but it is twice as thick and makes the phone bulky.One great way to save battery power is to turn off the power when you are not using it. It will still receive calls and messages. The problem I'm having is that every third or fourth time I turn off the power, the phone locks up (this is in addition to other lock ups). It has to be reset to make it work again. Unfortunately, the phone will not recieve calls or messages if it locks. This is not a problem for me because I don't receive many calls. For someone who cannot afford to miss a call, this would be a big problem.This phone reminds me of my old ipaq hx2495 pocket pc. It used to lock up all the time and I was always resetting it. After using an ipaq 510 for about a year, I became accustomed to having a reliable device that almost never had to be reset. Now I'm back to resetting my device all the time.

But it stands head and shoulders above the Treo 750 series and most of the current QWERTY-bars. Working within the confines of Windows Mobile, HP has put out a nice device which has, for the most part, slipped under the radar.The first batch of iPaqs shipped out were plagued with issues, but for those of us that exchanged them for another unit and upgraded ROM we were rewarded with a stable powerhorse with tons of memory and options. It has plenty of shortcut buttons, and the keyboard is fantastic to use. Don't be fooled by devices with 320x320 resolution- as a non-standard screen size, there are a large number of applications that are not compatible. The 320x240 of the iPaq 910 is nice and bright, works with most applications and is excellent for watching movies.Hopefully a future ROM will improve battery life, which is good but should be out-of-this-world for the size of the battery. And sadly, HP decided to share the audio and power USB port which means that you cannot use standard 3.5mm headphones, or even listen to music and charge simultaneously.After 3 months of use I sold this phone. It eventually became plagued by random unresponsive keyboard, and an inability to see the memory card (including apps and photos) both of which would only be fixed by a soft reset. Look over in the HP Forums and you will see tons of folks still waiting 9 months later for these issues to be fixed.

While this phone is just about everything I could have hoped for, it does have a few drawbacks too that I have not figured out a workaround for yet.On the plus side, this phone is every bit as powerful as a windows mobile phone can be. Setting everything up and syncing all my contacts, files, ect. was a snap, and I was up and moving in minutes. Even without an external GPS antenna, the GPS function works well (though Google Maps has given me wrong directions a time or two). There is also a function that allows a PC connected to the phone via bluetooth or USB to connect to the internet through the phone's service plan. I have found this feature to be extremely helpful, as I use several computers that have no internet access. The Wi-Fi is also excellant, with a range that is actually better than that of my laptop's. This phone definately lives up to the \"Business\" in it's name in every way, I have never been so well connected as with this thing in my pocket. I had no problems setting up any of my email accounts, hooking up my service plan, or any other kinds of issues connecting the phone to, well, anything I have tried to connect it to.Of course, there is always a down side. In almost every review I have seen for this phone, two issues where mentioned: battery life and volume. I wes expecting these both to be a bit under par, but I have to say that they are both FAR worse than I could have guessed. If the phone is in a pocket, forget hearing the ringer. The speakerphone is useless. It might have helped if they at least put a regular 3.5mm headphone jack on the phone, but it only has a mini-usb port. I also bought an adapter 3.5mm to mini-usb, but it doesn't work with this phone. The battery seems to be draining at an alarming rate, don't EVER forget your chargers! I leave the thing plugged in all the time to either a wall outlet, my PC, or the lighter port in my car, and I can still rip through the power pretty quickly on this thing. If you buy this phone, get a second battery and a charger for it.Aside from these two commonly mentioned issues, I have had a couple other things about this phone get on my nerves too. The audio tends to drop out while using a bluetooth headset, and the voice commander software on the phone leaves room to improve. Also, I had trouble installing an official HP patch to my phone from a Vista PC, so if you don't have an XP system, avoid the updates, you'll be really glad you did. Lastly, there is no way to rotate or change the display at all, and I have had a few software titles that could work perfectly be complete garbage on this phone because part of the graphics of the software hang below the visible screen, with no way to scroll or anything. I have had to reset the phone a couple times because some game demo I was trying was set to 320X240 instead of 240X320 and I couldn't click on an exit icon.Well, I am getting long winded here, but I have to say that overall I am very happy with this phone. It does everything I need it to do, in most cases flawlessly.

With the supplied stereo headset, listening to your music is just as good as with an iPod.I love that I can download recent e-mails to the phone and read them even when I don't have a wireless connection. I also like that I can create and/or edit Word and Excel documents. You can also print photos from the device without having to transfer them to a PC first.The only problem I have with the device is the camera. As some of the other reviews here state, it's a bit slow to respond. The pictures it takes are great though (once you have the patience to capture them). I enjoy photography so this isn't an issue for me as I usually have my camera with me.This device multi-tasks very well and is very responsive... even when it is near full-to-capacity (though the lack of memory does slow it down noticeably in such a situation). I've ordered an 8GB memory card for it so that I can store even more files without having to worry about slowing down the device.Another thing I like is that it can read your text messages and e-mails for you. This has come in very handy while driving. Of course, it becomes a bit confusing to understand if the text message contains abbreviations or slang.Battery life in my opinion is good. However, when charging the device while in a long call the \"high battery temperature\" warning comes up after a few minutes. I guess living in the tropics doesn't help this either. (I usually just remove the battery cover to help keep it cool... sort of odd but it works)Some reviews spoke of the tight keyboard. The keyboard is quite tight but the curved keys help to reduce errors in typing. If you prefer, there's also an additional keyboard on the touch screen interface with optional sizes so you can adjust it to your liking. You can also use the transcriber feature to write directly on the screen and it will convert your handwriting to text. If your handwriting isn't the best (like mine) you can teach it how you make your letters.Overall the device is excellent! I love it! Had no problems with it thus far.

I use my ipaq at work (I am a nurse), and the programs installed without any problems.  Calendar and contacts seem to be easier to use than my previous ipaq as well.  I love having the phone and ipaq all in one device - and it is even smaller than my previous ipaq.  The only drawback I have found so far is the volume on the phone.  The speaker phone is actually the problem.  Listening to voice mail on the speaker phone still requires holding the device close to your ear, but if you are like me and don't use your phone nearly as much as the computer part, then it is a small thing.  The screen is also very easy to read.  It is smaller than my previous, but has better resolution.  All the options for navigation of the screen are great too.  You can use the stylus, the toggle buttons, or a scroll wheel on the side.  I have not yet played with the camera much, but it seems to take a couple seconds to focus, so it is not so great for quick shots of the dogs, but for a planned picture would be fine.

When I received it I thought it was great. Touch screen a plus, windows os I liked it was a good improvement over the T-Mobile dash window mobile 5. after a couple of days with it. I noticed it looked like was kind of like they just took differt features that's were good on other phones and crammed it in to one. To many redundant functions. You have a directional ring button in the middle allowing you to scroll up and down the screen. Then The touch screen its self can scroll up and down too. Then there select and menu buttons in the messaging part, as well as on the touch screen . And if you wanted you can us the black berry like scroll wheel on the side to make your selections and navigate around the screen. Just made it seem like didn't put any thought in to adding more functions for the hard wear to could take advantage of. Over all was user friendly but only cause there are three ways to do the same thing.The GoodI like the windows 6.1 so easy to find setting to make changes.The touch screen worked well although its a bit on the small sidethe over all form factor of the phone was good easy to use with two hands but, took practice to use with oneThe badFroze 2 to 3 times a day and that's with minimal useDeleting text messages is a night mare. when you select clear all text and mms messages. would start delegating and then freeze. used that option once before bed and it was still stuck in the same spot when I woke up. and that's was only with about 50 texts messages to delete.battery life on the low side I'd get 9 hours of medium use before I had to charge it.Taking picture was slow. you press the button to take the picture and it takes about 3 seconds to actually take the picture. not a very good way to take pictures hold still. ha hathe speaker phone volume is way to low even when turned up all the way.ringer volume to low as well when all the way up.Vibrate function inconsistent, it  worked when it wanted to and isn't strong enough to feel when it goes off.by month 5 battery life was down to 3 hours before needing a charge. come to fine out its because the charging port was detaching from the board. in month 6 it stopped charging and syncing all together when the port came off the circuit board.it was under warranty and hp had a replacement out in 3 days.I stopped using it for about 2 months and when back to the T-mobile dash. but the decided that since I paid $499 for this phone I better get my money worth. so started using it still having the freezing problems. which's most phone have. some more then others. and now im approaching month 6 on the replacement phone. and surprise the battery life is down to 3 hours again and the screen flickers when its charging or syncing, which means The charging port is detaching form the circuit board again. And its our of warranty so Looks like it will become a paper weight. Sad a $499 phone only lasts a year at most well 6 months each since mine was replaced.If I had to do it over again I would pass. Good Attempt just bad hardware design. I don't think this phone is worth paying $[...] for. $275 would probably be about right price point in my option and that would only be if the was a $50 rebate. so it's back to my T-moble dash which oddly enough was run over by a scissor lift and still works fine after replacing the just the screen.

Hobson \"Otaku Swag\"", "ReviewID": "R3BUU8XO3JXN2Y", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "I purchased the HP iPAQ 910c Business Messenger about 2 months ago.  At the time it seemed a very excellent phone.  Here are my thoughts.NOTE: I am reviewing the product as a PDA, as I have no phone service in this phone yet.  When I get service I will update the review.***THE PHONE***The phone itself is very sturdy, despite being made of plastic.  It feels good in the hand, and the keyboard is good for typing out emails and text messages.  The screen size doesn't bother me as much as it would bother some people, as being a small landscape touch screen (QVGA).  I also liked the scroll wheel on the side of the phone.  It is convenient when scrolling through email or changing the volume in Windows Media Player.One things I wish was better is battery life.  I left the phone on with push services turned on and wifi connection.  It lost battery around 7 hours later.  I ended up purchasing the extended battery, which needed a case with a huge hump in the back of the phone, which looks ugly and feels ugly to hold.  The same test, the phone drained about 10 hours later.  Not much of an improvement in my own opinion.  One fear I have is when I get service with unlimited data, the battery life will be even worse.Another thing I disliked was the location of the speaker.  Its on the back of the phone, and that hinders the sound when the phone is laying on its back.All in all, the phone itself is an excellent device, and I would call it top of the line.  So why did I give it 2 stars?  Well its because of...***THE SOFTWARE***The HP iPAQ 910c is powered by Microsoft Windows Mobile v6.1.  Now the last windows mobile device I used ran Windows Mobile 2003, which was an excellent mobile platform to use.  I figured a later version would be even better.  Boy was I wrong.  Windows Mobile 6.1 is very unstable and buggy.  A day of use with this phone always included a crash, slow-down or hang-up.  I also disliked the fact that at some points, Windows Mobile rejected my MicroSD card, forcing me to reboot the device.Despite running Windows Mobile, there was good software loaded onto the phone.  It came with HP Photosmart Mobile, which is much better than WM's default Pictures and Video software.  It came with the other usual stuff, Office, Outlook (which sucks, by the way), Windows Media, and Windows Live.  It also came with a Java manager, so I could play games and use the famous Opera Mini web browser.I loaded selects of my music collection onto my phone for those times I forget my iPod.  Windows Media player gets the job done quite well.  Sound quality is great when the included headset is plugged in.  Not as great using the default speaker.  I cant say as much for video though.  Being a business phone, I dont think this phone was designed for playing video.  The video would skip every now and then.The camera on the phone took good quality photos, and the camera app was decent, but I found no way to get it to flash when taking the pictures, there was only a button which turned the flash on and stay on, which could really blind someone fast.As far as software goes, I dont like it.  Windows Mobile 6.1 is not a stable platform.  I constantly have to reboot the device, and I cannot stand the frequent slowdowns.***THE BOTTOM LINE***Well, as expected, HP has outdone themselves in the quality of the device.  It looks good, it feels good, and it is very sturdy, despite the plastic casing.  It's a shame to see such an excellent phone loaded with such a horrible platform.  Windows Mobile 6.1 is not a good platform to work on.  It's unstable and unreliable.  You never know when it will freeze or crash.If I were to give HP a tip to improve this phone, I'd tell them to look into adopting Symbian OS and using it, or taking the source code and writing their own version.  Windows Mobile is not good, and is literally the downfall of this otherwise excellent device.", "Date": "November 16, 2008"}, {"Title": "Seems good but maybe mine was a lemon", "Author": "R.
