{"Reviews": [{"Title": "GREAT BASIC PHONE", "Author": "Howard \"K. Howard\"", "ReviewID": "RPIN6YO8RH1Y8", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Picked up two of these little flips at Wal_Mart for $19.99 and each included $10.00 in free air time so net cost on this phone is $10.00. Phone usually has 5 bars and calls are very clear, no static or drop call problems. Camera is OK, but not the best. Entering contacts and navigating the phone is very easy. Volume controls are easy to use and speaker volume is quite high for when making calls outside. Bluetooth works great and connected to my Motorola 715 without any problems. Ringer volume is also loud and easy to hear. Only thing that is not very good is the speaker phone. You can use it but after a few minutes you will decide you are better off having this phone up to your ear. Battery life is great. You can go several days without charging the battery if the phone is on all the time. I use these phones as emergency backups. They stay in our car glove boxes (turned off) and I only have to charge them once every 2-3 months.", "Date": "April 6, 2013"}, {"Title": "Love the phone", "Author": "Cale \"Love a great book\"", "ReviewID": "RYROF2RCL1X4C", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Phone works fantastic.

Piece of junk.", "Author": "chevyqueen", "ReviewID": "R12VPZMHVOFJJE", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "This phone is terrible. I switched from contract to pre-paid so the people at the Verizon store wouldn't even talk to me. They told me I had to buy this phone. It is garbage.  It keeps shutting off, which is great when you use the phone for an alarm clock. I called Verizon customer service and the person said he couldn't help me because I didn't have a land line for them to check the nearest tower and to call back when I found a neighbor with a land line to call from.  I have been with Verizon since 2002 and feel like I should go to another carrier.", "Date": "September 1, 2013"}, {"Title": "good basic phone", "Author": "tonny", "ReviewID": "R1MKTSIXD7OYFQ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "this phone its the best price also have standard basic program like camera blue tooth alarm ,and more,ill purchase this phone for my kids to cut budget", "Date": "March 17, 2013"}, {"Title": "Adequate product.", "Author": "Letitia Fitch \"T.Fitch\"", "ReviewID": "R2TL2KZUYF3SMQ", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "It is a product of which is older but affordable for the purpose of what I need it for and not often.", "Date": "September 25, 2013"}, {"Title": "Pre pay only", "Author": "cathy roe", "ReviewID": "R2KGR16GSGCWBN", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "This phone will not work if you are in a contract.

I have to say that, I am quite happy with it although its not a smart phone. Its very durable and it fell on the floor like 100 times. The battery lasts almost a week for me if  I take 2 calls per day and speak for 10 minutes. The phone also charges very quickly and very easily fits in your pocket. I added a 50 dollar Unlimited Talk - text plan to this phone and I love it. I am going to get a smart phone very soon and I am going to always have this phone as a back up.", "Date": "January 15, 2014"}, {"Title": "A lot cheaper than a smart phone and good for voice and text", "Author": "Charles Shepard \"citizen\"", "ReviewID": "R2WHHRZAFIYWCN", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Verizon wanted $30 for a replacement wall charger, so when I saw this at Walmart for $14.88, I bought it. I use this now as my regular plan phone. I bought and activated another one as a backup for my Verizon account. This phone works fine for voice and text. You must activate it and then wait 6 months to use it as a regular phone as part of a plan, but it is about the same price month to month as with a contract. I can have a \"free\" fancy smart phone, but this enough. I have computers and my tablet for internet. Besides, the free smart phone with insurance, extra $10 a month and data plan update would cost $750 for the two year contract.", "Date": "December 15, 2013"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": null, "Features": null, "Name": null, "ImgURL": null, "ProductID": "B008PAW5EQ"}}
