{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Super phone at Great Price", "Author": "Regi Sylvain", "ReviewID": "R158836XVTCZAU", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Before I go into the pro and cons I would like to share something very important with my fellow customers . Yes there are many cheaper phones available in the market and I have had a chance to compare this with them and the difference in performance is huge.It is worth paying a few dollars more than land up with a phone that will frustrate you so much that you wouldn\u2019t want to buy again. The reason for this phone being miles ahead of the cheaper versions is the \"DUAL CORE MTK  6572 with 1.2 GHZ\"  which is miles ahead of the sc processor being used in the cheaper phones.\"Believe me its not worth saving a few bucks and compromise for a phone with sc processor as in all probabilities  it just won't work\".Here are some of the good qualities I discovered after using the phone for a while.1. Huge screen with pleasant display and great appearance.But that is not all that is there to it. Set up was extremely simple.2. I just popped in my AT&T; sim and within seconds I was able to register to the network.3. The MTK 6572 dual core works fast and browsing between application is a breeze.4. Downloading android apps from the playstore couldn\u2019t have been easier.5. Picture quality from the main camera is fairly good.6. The huge 8GB memory in the TF card installed is  a feat for those who want all their music and stuff on the phone.7. Wifi range and connectivity is fairly good and I didn\u2019t experience any issues whatsoever.8. Call quality is fine. Didn't have any dropped calls so far.9. Bluetooth connectivity is fine.10.  The price was super.Highly recommended android.", "Date": "February 13, 2014"}, {"Title": "\" One of the best androids in this price range in the Market \"Super phone\"", "Author": "Carl Redford", "ReviewID": "R9APKWR6299P0", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "After a lot of research I found a decent android phone from a US vendor Lightahead.This phone is a big upgrade over the ones being sold with sc processors.The reasons for my review are given below:1.

The best purpose this phone is good for is talk and text. Inasmuch as browsing, it freezes a lot and is slow due to being a 2G. It's okay though if you are starting out with a Smartphone for the first time.The Dual Sim card slots when you place one in, the other slot gives off a warning sign indicating, \"Please check to see if the sim card is ready.\" Funny because you know you have a sim card installed, but you have to keep dealing with the warning icon on the notification bar.Other than the minor setbacks I do like the phone, but because I am more advanced with Smartphones, I have to give it to another family member that is in need of a phone.", "Date": "March 13, 2014"}, {"Title": "Great Job", "Author": "Alice Bangura", "ReviewID": "R39LSU0GOQ6KML", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "great product but the producer have to improve on the sound quality especially the in call volume is very low", "Date": "April 17, 2014"}, {"Title": "3G over 850 Mhz", "Author": "Reinaldo Aguilar", "ReviewID": "RZI8I3L96A453", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "The phone is very good, this works normally over 2G but does not work over 850 Mzh with 3G.I try several times to fond user guide in internet and is impossible.Finally, the user guide that comes inside box is for Iphone !!!!!!!", "Date": "June 1, 2014"}, {"Title": "CELL PHONE LA9500MT(MTK)", "Author": "LUIS J.GRIMALDO", "ReviewID": "R1J3CCZ35PFSMD", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "PHONE CAME WITH  NOT INSTRCTION MANUAL.I CAN NOT USE THE CAMARA  IF I DONT HAVE THE INSTRUCTION MANUAL..THE PICTURES ARE VERY DARK.", "Date": "May 16, 2014"}, {"Title": "Very annoying.", "Author": "Tammy G.", "ReviewID": "RGIJ17ZQNED3S", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I cannot find a case for product.

When i did finally send texts it didn't show up in my chat history, and the only time their text showed up was in a popup window. the second i would exit out of that, there was no indication they ever sent me anything. The sim card kept saying it was damaged no matter how many SD cards I put, and I even had to rest the phone, still telling me it's a damaged SD card. The camera quality is pretty bad, and it doesn't matter how many times i re-download google play it tells me it cannot be opened. Sometimes upload icons appear on images and sometimes they don't. I could make a list of errors.
