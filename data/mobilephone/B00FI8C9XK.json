When came I was so excited and immediately turned it on.....THE LANGUAGE WAS CHINESE!  I couldn't even get to a place where I could understand how to change the language setting and Nokia couldn't get me there either over the phone.  Luckily I have a good friend who knows the Chinese language and after a few taps she had it in English.  I put a sim card from Wal-Mart straight talk and it works like a dream.  It's very easy to use and the pictures are amazing.

I even find the voice recognition for text messages and Bing searches understands my voice better than Siri does on the iPhone. The camera is what makes this phone worth the money, with so many different modes it is easy even for novice camera users.Only reason for 4 stars is that with the camera grip, there is basically no protective case available for the phone. You have to remove the camera grip for a protective case to fit.", "Date": "January 7, 2014"}, {"Title": "Just one word: Perfect!!", "Author": "Miguel Angel", "ReviewID": "R1Z3Z5K50A8NIT", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This is by far, the greatest camera a playing-sound quality phone I've ever had...also the quality and colours of the display are stunning!!I've had a nokia E7, then a samsung sII, lumia 900 and iphone 4s in the past...But for me, this is the most productive and best quality phone I ever buy!!I'm am studying Transport/Industrial design, so this is the best choice for someone like me!...I don't know why some people complain about the OS, It's just bad publicity. For me It's just so fluid and intuitive...and for the apps, if you want productivity and real-use gourgeos design apps, more than games and silly things, this will be your best choice. ;)", "Date": "January 10, 2014"}, {"Title": "Comes with Grip Accesory!", "Author": "Neil Patrick Faller RWBSF Crew", "ReviewID": "RZOA8K144D88H", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "The phone was great!

It worked super great. Loved the camera, loved the options and all my apps. I was super careful with it. Then one day in May the screen stopped working. I tried all the possible sollutions. I even contacted the seller to ask about the warranty. BUT, I never got a simple responce from the seller :( Then I called the customer service and found out that the phone didn't have a warranty in the US... To repair the screen will be from 150$ and up...and from all the research I've done so far - it's a common thing for Nokia Lumia 1020 to have such issues... Next time, it would be nice, if the seller notifies the customer, that the expensive purchase they are about to make will not be covered by the factory warranty...So 1 star is to the seller and 2 stars to the phone itself because of the issue.", "Date": "June 4, 2014"}, {"Title": "not bad, but still needs alot of work", "Author": "mazen sayed", "ReviewID": "R157NLN10N8A5L", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "it is a good phone as general. here is what bothers me the most:- the Compass: when using maps, it keps teeling me that the compass need to be calibrated and asks me to wave the phone in an 8 shape to calibrate it, it doesn't matter howlong you wave your phone, it will keep ask you to calibrate it :(- Don't know why with the main creen, Apps screen, most of Apps, the screen does not rotate, it rotates for just office, net & some other minor Apps.- the notification system is not helping at all, and you able to put just 5 different types of notifications to the lock screen ???? and when you unlock your screen, you have to search for them by opening each App. why there is no some top bar that contains all the notifications just as Android??- I don't know how to upgrate my phone to Windows 8.1??? and afterlogging to Nokia websit, I just don't understand what is the business of my carrier company to do with upgrading the O.S.

But I must say that I'm extremely happy with the switch! I was going from a Samsung galaxy S2 to the Nokia lumia 1020. I also own a Mac and an iPad. So I have had the chance to shop and each market and get a feel for how they all work and features they bring. To be honest with you the windows at market has everything that I need (apps). And actually I like shopping in the windows market better because there's less junky apps to have to go sort through. I feel the phone is very intuitive and it's just as easy for me to get from one place to another as it was on my galaxy. Actually, probably easier, but I am comparing to an older galaxy so that's probably a given. I've had the phone for about a week now so I've had a chance to really play with it a lot. There are only a few things that bother me about phone. This phone drains the battery! Granted I was on it a lot playing on it a lot in the beginning, but it would not last me over five hours. I searched for how to extend the battery life and changed some settings and it seemed to help a little bit. But, I can usually go at least two days on my galaxy S2 and I can usually go about three days on my iPad with the same amount of usage without having to recharge. I definitely have to recharge this baby everyday, sometimes twice a day. The only other complaint is the voice feature, I always used voice a lot on my iPad and galaxy for search engines, commands, texting etc. Windows phone does a pretty decent job and it picks up my voice relatively well. Actually it probably does better than the iPad 3. But I miss being able to use punctuation while I'm talking. I haven't found a way to add commas periods or exclamation points. So after I use voice to say my sentences or paragraphs I have to go back in and add my punctuation. I will say that it usually knows and I'm the end of the sentence and will add the period, however it does not get the rest my punctuation. This is really annoying to me because I'm trying to be hands-free. Hopefully I can find a way to change this but I haven't found a way as of yet. Otherwise if you are leaning towards a switch from android or I phone to a Windows phone, I do not think you'll be disappointed. By the way I'm writing this review on my iPad using voice to text. I should've done it from my phone so you could see what I'm talking about with the punctuation.", "Date": "May 7, 2014"}, {"Title": "Nice, but no LTE", "Author": "Uranusfish", "ReviewID": "R1K12C0BN40Y78", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "The camera of the phone is very good.OS is work fast.However, it is NOT support for LTE; it only has 4G", "Date": "April 8, 2014"}, {"Title": "Love the camera", "Author": "SmoothSail", "ReviewID": "R3JR3L5PSRYOBV", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Lives up to the 41 MP.
