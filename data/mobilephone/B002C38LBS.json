However, I live in Sweden so beware that some features may not be exactly the same. UPDATE: I have now had this phone for about a month and have these comments (see UPDATE notes).First, this is a great phone. Hands down...and I live in Sweden where there are more cellphones per capita than anywhere else. As for the other reviewer...I don't know why someone complains about the virtual keyboard and no physical keypad. Buy a phone with a keyboard, silly, if you don't like tapping the screen. I for one used to have a Nokia E61 with a real keyboard. Great. But, I really like this onscreen keyboard. It's fast, easy to use, and even though it suggests words for you (and gets smarter with time) you can suggest the word you want from four suggestions (iPhone has only two). This phone is obviously trying to get you to shy away from the iPhone...and you should. It's that good.Pros:Flexibility - I can configure the homescreens any way I want. UPDATE: This is just great. Really. I can change the phone as I learn what I need and don't need. Lot's of hype in the cellphone world, but few useful tools. This really helps me stay connected and it is easy and quick to make a direct call, take a picture, check my google map position, send an email, etc.Fast - this phone is really fast and does multitasking very well. I can surf the web while listening to a tune while using the GPS...and it doesn't bog down! UPDATE: Yep, this really works. Just went hiking in the woods of Sweden...where the logging road ends. Did perfectly. Used my GPS while I listened to my radiostation on LastFM through the phone...in the woods! The iPhone bogs down.Form - it's fits really nicely in my pocket. Not too heavy, not too big. UPDATE: The screen doesn't scratch badly at all, and if you want additional scratch protection go to [...].Battery - stellar battery life. UPDATE: Go easy on the app downloads from the Market/app store. Some apps drain the battery. Again, the iPhone drains your battery badly.Market - ok, so it's not the Apple store, but it has a lot of useful programs. UPDATE: I have a great email program (K-9), push SMS (SMS popup), instant access to wifi/GPS/bluetooth etc (Useful switches).Google syncing - works perfectly to sync my web calender with my phone with my sidebar at home. UPDATE: Really love this one. Type in a new calender event and your google calender and your google toolbar are updated within the minute. Sweet.Cons:Really, so far I haven't found any...except to figure out how to get the same timezone on all three calenders...UPDATE: I did.UPDATE: Actually, the calender is subpar...so far until the Market provides a new one. You really can't adjust it very well. I would like different colors for different events; start the week on a Monday; Week number.However, buy this phone and you won't be disappointed!", "Date": "June 18, 2009"}, {"Title": "Google Ion \"G2\" using Android 1.5 OS (free from Goolge at I/O conference)", "Author": "J. Yoon", "ReviewID": "RVECF4H5OWVV5", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I would up my rating from 3 to 4+ stars now, but Amazon doesn't allow a change.  I am warming to this phone after trying it for 1 month.I discovered the keyboard setting to turn off automatically replacing what I typed with its own highlighted word. Click Home, Menu, Settings, Locale & text, Android keyboad ->> turn off Auto-comple and Quick fixes.  This fixes my biggest gripe with the virtual keyboard that replaced what I typed with it's own(wrong)gusses. I could not find the setting before.I was able to load a lot of photos using the included mini USB cable to the included 2 GB miniSD card. (These accessories may not be included if you bought the HTC phone.) Photos copied to DCIM folder displayed quickly. Thumbnail viewing and finger-flick scrolling was very nice. The included Gallery app recognized folder structure and showed folders using thumbnails.The steps for mounting the phone as a USB drive were not obvious, but works well when following the instructions on Android Developer's site ([...]  Steps: (1) Install free Eclipse SDK on your computer (I installed C++ version for Windows XP, but JAVA is recommended). (2) Install ADT (Android Development Tools) Plugin to Eclipse. and (3) Turn on USB debugging. From your phone, click Home, Menu, Setting, Applications, Development ->> then turn on USB debugging. When you plug-in the USB cable, your phone will ask if you want to mount the USB drive. From the windows computer, the USB drive was automatically assigned the next drive letter and I was able to use Windows Explorer to drag-n-drop content. This is more involved than usual for mounting a USB drive (most are automatically recognized). But I found myself intrigued by the nice Eclipse SDK.  I am tempted to try out the Hello World sample code on the developer's site and try writing a very simple app for myself even though I am TOTALLY NOT a developer. I can see how this will suck in other phone app developers.I discovered that my AT&T;/Cingular 3G SIM card from my Treo680 worked seamlessly on the Google Ion. I have an unlimited data and limited voice plan for about $50/month. It plugged in and booted up and I was able to make a call and download web content right away.  My phone number from Treo was recognized by Ion. I haven't tested it, but I should be able to use the Android as a tether for my laptop to connect to the internet. Bluetooth tethering is included in my Treo's data contract, and 3rd party software (ex. PDANet) allows a work-around for phones that are prevented from tethering by service providers.I have enjoyed playing with the many apps availabe from Android Market. There are a few TASK and Note apps that I would LOVE to use if the Ion had a thumb keyboard.  My remaining gripe is the keyboard, but I can see a 3rd party thumbpad accessory that plugs into the miniUSB jack at the bottom becoming available very soon. So, I have been pleasantly surprised by the capabilities of Ion I've discovered as I learned to use it.-------- My earlier initial review follows. --------------------Summary: Best for viewing/editing video/photo, web surfing at high speeds, and REALLY GREAT for app developers.  Totally unlocked and access to root level. Complete access to app Market. Lots of free apps to play with for consumers.  Good phone sound and connection. Battery lasts 5 hours on continuous hard use, can easily go all day with normal use (added after one month trial: usually lasts me 3 days on normal use).Pros:* Best aspect is a high-res screen coupled with a fast internet connection.  Great for viewing YouTube in high-res.  Fast WiFi connection.  3G a bit slower but still very usable.  Hi-Res video stalls when using 3G, works great on WiFi. A bad is there is no support for viewing Flash video.  Most videos from websites other than YouTube does not play either. (I expect these to be resolved with software updates)* Love being able to record high-res video built-in. Quality was very good. Easy to upload to PC via USB cable or email/YouTube.* Photo viewing from gallery is also great at the high-res.* Voice calling and Voice search works very well!  Remarkably accuarate recognition of English words. Setup your contacts and \"my location\" to help these tools work well.* Google provides an easy to use development environment for writing apps and do not block anyone from uploading their apps to the Market.  Apple plays gatekeeper and sometimes unreasonably block apps. Palm Pre's market hasn't even started.  Developer tools not ready.  I am a consumer, and expect to benefit from this.  There are a lot of free apps to try out, and I expect a lot more to come (maybe surpass Apple in the distant future?).OK:* Pretty good bowser experience. Swiping up/down or left/right works well. Although, hard to type in web address. Try to use bookmarks and links as much as possible. Can also copy & paste. Can't pinch like the iPhone, but does rotate screen.* Good integration with Google Maps, but not usable as a GPS naviation tool. Can usually find \"my current location\" but accuratcy is often miles off.  GPS is useless (locks up) when car is moving, so not a usable navigation device, but can still be used just for the map function.* Playing music - sound sucks from speaker and headphone, but software is nice and easy to navigate. Does not play Audible.com books, but expect this to change.* Syncing with Microsoft Outlook: It's doable, but not free of errors. First sync Outlook 2-way with Google Calendar online. Then sync Google Calendar with phone. Contacts do not sync, but can be exported from Outlook as CSV file and imported into Google Calendar. Phone number field does not accept any extra text other than 10 digits. No 1 in front either. Email addresses were added to note field, and had to be manually corrected. If your main PIM is already Google Calendar, your integration may be trouble free.* Games: surprisingly, this is only OK for game because of the dull screen sensitivity.  Hard for quick response games. Scroll wheel is hard to move accuartely, but a smart use of this clickable wheel might be the best answer for game developers.(A stylus was extremely good for playing space invaders on my old Pocket PC 2002).Cons:* Really hate the virtual keyboard. (I currently use Treo with a small thumpad and really love typing out emails and task notes.) A lot of people say it's an improvement over G1's physical keyboard, but I don't know how that can be possible.  It maddeningly substitutes words I've typed with a higher frequency word it hightlights at the bottom.  So if I am typing a name or an acronym, there is no way to disable the keyboard from substituting what I typed with what it \"thinks\" is the right word.* Screen is not as sensitive to touch as the iPhone.  Seems to really need pressure, especially space and dot (last row).  Sometimes interprets strong pressure as a double tap.* Can't use a stylus. This is same as the iPhone, but more of an issue with the less sensitive screen.* No support for Bluetooth external keyboard, such as Stowaway. This SUCKS!  Google's support forum says HID (Human Interface Device) bluetooth stack support is way down on their priority.  Since I hate the virtual keyboard, this eliminates the Ion from being functional as a PDA as well as an entertainment device.  Now it's great only as an entertainment device.* To view Word email attachments or edit Word docs, need to buy $20 app from Documents-to-go.* No good Task app found: Does not sync with Outlook Tasks without due dates. Tried Astrid and ToDo, but I don't like these as well as Outlook Tasks or even apps that were available for my old PPC 2002 (TreNotes, HandiNote). Maybe some fully-fleshed paid apps might be developed in the future.", "Date": "June 12, 2009"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": null, "Features": null, "Name": null, "ImgURL": null, "ProductID": "B002C38LBS"}}
