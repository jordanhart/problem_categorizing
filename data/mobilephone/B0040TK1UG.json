Its a great PDA phone,  I can do all of my necessary task. I LIKE KEY PAD BASE PHONE ! I love to text on it because its so easy and it looks like I am on instant messaging and it has a full keyboard. I also love the built in PDA and how it helps me to remember tasks and events because I cant remember anything. The other thing that helps is how when you want to dial a phone number you can go to the keypad and just touch the numbers and that makes it so easy to make a call.", "Date": "January 16, 2013"}, {"Title": "Warning", "Author": "chinistica", "ReviewID": "RG7IOJWS5TKLZ", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "You coult read in tecnical details.Great Condition PDA Displaying Little-To-No Scratches; Activate on AT&T; Contract Free - Simply Insert SIM Cardthis phone was in really bad conditions, i simply insert my sim card and the phone was fully locket, then i paid to unlock and the phone works for 2 days and later the operating system doesn't start. please avoid to buy this phone.", "Date": "November 24, 2010"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "$59.99", "Features": "This product has been carefully audited and is certified to be 100% functional.\nThis offer includes the following accessories 1.
