I went back and forth from an apple store and my service provider. Apple gave me a new phone because the one I purchased was still under warranty. After spending all day trying to get the phone to work the apple service rep went in the back room and got the original phone and did a history check from the original owner up until I got the phone. Status unlocked: False. The apple rep told me they could not change the status of the phone they were required to return my new phone with the same set up as the old phone. The apple rep said until the person or company I got the phone from change the settings to factory unlocked there would not be anything I could do with this phone. I sent an email to Amazon about the problem and they were going to contact the provider with this issue. To date I have heard nothing from the provider or Amazon. If I could rate the product with a zero star I would. Right now I have spent over three hundred dollars out of my pocket and lost a day's work. The best thing I could do with this phone is make a boat anchor with it but it would not even be good for that. I found out by trying to save money it would have been better just to buy a new phone. I guess the old saying holds true you get what you pay for.", "Date": "September 11, 2012"}, {"Title": "Love it!!", "Author": "mskgarmon", "ReviewID": "RIASG9G66UUJ5", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I recieved my Iphone4 in the mail and was so excited to see that it was practically brand new.
