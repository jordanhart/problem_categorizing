{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Terrible Company", "Author": "PinkRunner", "ReviewID": "R3B3GM28BA4233", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I ordered this phone from the OEM shop \"new\" (as described)... I received my phone 10 days later and opened the box to find out that the phone had previously been used. There were scratches on the phone and you could tell the box was opened (none of the original packaging came with the phone). To make matters worse, after inserting my SIM card, it prompted me if I wanted to merge the previous 206 contacts stored in the phone (it was the previous owners contacts)??. I scrolled through some of the numbers and Funny thing is- she (the previous owner) had left her phone number in there and I called her asking if this phone was used by her. She laughed and told me that She had ordered the same phone from this company two weeks prior but the phone kept shutting itself off while texting so she sent it back.... and they sent it to me! Funny how I even received verification from the previous owner that the phone was not new. And she was right, sure enough during the first day the phone shut itself off about 10 times (very frustrating). I requested a refund and returned the item. I'm not happy that I had to spend 10 bucks on shipping when it was the companys error that sent me a used phone. I will never order anything from them again, they are cheap and send you crap that other consumers return just to make a profit. I ended up ordering the same phone from a company on ebay and it works perfectly. Stay away from OEM! As for the phone, I absolutely love it- just find the right company to order it from.", "Date": "October 22, 2011"}, {"Title": "Pleased with both the item and the seller.", "Author": "chibihisagi", "ReviewID": "R29SIWTM0QYMYY", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I bought this phone for my younger sister since her old phone was on the breaking point. She really wanted this phone since her favorite band promoted it. We were slightly worried that it wouldn't work with her card, but we received it today and are surprised by how well it works, how cute it is and how fast it got to us. The packing was safe, nothing was wrong with it, it came with all that was listed and even a page to show all the items that should be there. The screen lights up on the outside to show the time and if you wish, you can add an image. Everything is super cute and easy to get use to. My sister is extremely happy with this phone and we would recommend it to anyone. Thanks to the seller who was very patient with us when Amazon was having difficulty with our payment. Five stars all the way.", "Date": "June 25, 2012"}, {"Title": "Have enjoyed it every day for over a year", "Author": "ssamdy45", "ReviewID": "R2IHT2Q4S9W4ED", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Cute, fun, tween phone, I am a 56 year old lady and didn't want to spend $300 to carry a computer around. Just wanted an inexpensive, fun little phone. If it rings and you don't want to take the call, just flip it over. Ha, let's see a $300 fancy phone do that. When it rings, the phone number or contact name, lights up on the outside of the phone. Change the light colors and order to match certain contacts. Very easy to use.

I wanted something simple to replace my old phone that had water damage, and the LG Lollipop fit! It's easy enough to operate and the keypad is large enough that I don't have to continually back up to correct. I think the \"light up\" feature is pretty cool. I've received lots of positive comments on it. I love it and would recommend it positively!", "Date": "August 29, 2011"}, {"Title": "Not what we were hoping for", "Author": "JoLene R.

This was not a quality product, although quite expensive.  We bought it knowing that it was an unlocked phone- the first phone we purchased came without a battery.  Then we reorder another ( I guess we learned the hard way), but after a few weeks of using it things continue to go wrong.  For example the lights on the phone don't work.  We will return it also", "Date": "January 22, 2014"}, {"Title": "Great phone, but weak battery", "Author": "Yao He", "ReviewID": "R6JYHXKW08GTX", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I bought this phone my mom for trip to China.
