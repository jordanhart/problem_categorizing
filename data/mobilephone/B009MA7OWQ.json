I really like qwerty keyboard bar style phones, and have never cared much for touchscreens, although I had an iPhone 4 for a year or so before I realized how much I missed my Blackberry 9330, so I upgraded to this Curve 9350. It's a good product. Item is as described. Reliable seller Breed made buying experience pleasurable. Phone had clean ESN and was brand new shipped in Sprint box with original packaging. Item arrived on time", "Date": "January 15, 2014"}, {"Title": "Good phone for the price", "Author": "Ryan Mellott", "ReviewID": "R2NNE7VQ38JGS3", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "This is a good phone.
