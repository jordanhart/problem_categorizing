Until that arrives, this is the best mobile device in my opinion out there.  I had a rooted EVO 4G and never felt the need for a tablet because it did everything I needed...aside from really working, for which I used my desktop.  I was thinking of the EVO 4G LTE because I had grown to like HTC and liked the increased size and the beauty of the device.  Still as a photographer, I wanted a mobile device with an excellent camera, not that the EVO LTE was not,(my daughter has it and my other daughter with her IPhone 4S, a very good camera, envies hers)  did not want Samsung because of radio problems.Then came the NOTE II and I kept hearing about the power and capabilities.  I felt this was the device that would put a tablet in my hands at the same time.At first I was put off by the size, almost so huge as to be ridiculous.  I never thought I would have such a huge device.  That was for about ONE day.  After that, it quickly grew on me, and I was hooked.Call quality - excellent...no complaints...works smoothly with my jawbone bluetooth...just paired up and connected...smooth.Jelly Bean - Heaven...this thing is what Android was supposed to be...we have arrived finally...Apple no longer holds the advantage for having a seamlessly smooth no lagging OS...JB matches or surpasses it with intuitiveness, speed, beauty, flexibility and potential.Features:  so much that I haven't even used them all yet.Speed:  no splutter..no lag...just goes from one screen or command to another like butter.Size:  I LOVE IT!!!...I cannot go back to a smaller device.Camera:  almost perfect...I would like to be able to adjust shutter speed and aperture...may be possible...have to see if there is an app available for that..other than that the photos are better than I have ever seen from a phone and rivals PS cameras out there.  The HDR will make you scream in delight.  So I am happy that the phone has the camera quality that I really needed.I bought the adapter connection to stream to my TV HDMI..I bought another connection to connect directly to my DSLR...will come back with those results later.It is not for everyone but if you want one device to do everything...browse internet, connect to many other devices, read magazines, read books, look at movies, edit photos!!(with a pen)...etc, etc....this is it.note: I bought a case for it and while it looks good, it goes not fit in my pocket like before...before you could not know it was there because it was so thin.....this is how it overcomes its size...by its thinness..LOVE IT...", "Date": "November 29, 2012"}, {"Title": "SMH @ FanBoys", "Author": "Kenyon Martin", "ReviewID": "R28PS6MV0IC0FP", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I initially wanted to get the New EVO 4lte. When I heard of this device I did some research, because as an EVO owner for 2yrs the only direction I could see myself going was IPhone... I was definitely not a Samsung fan.After owning the product for a few weeks, I am impressed.It is FastIt is responsiveIt is also Overwhelming with so much to do with it. I admit I use the pen function very seldom.I do not like the keyboard, but that's because I am spoiled to HTC's.  I will live.You have to consider the size. I love the size, others may not like it so much.Technologically speaking it is top of the line... not top of the Android line, it is TOP OF THE LINE.We have to understand that Apple OS is proprietary and specific which enabled it to edge towards perfection sooner.  The Open Android System has finally approached that bench mark via the Galaxy Notebook2. It doesn't mean that Apple is not Top of the line also, BUT it does mean you have a choice of best devices and don't have to give up any functionality or capability and you may just possibly... be adding with this one.  (Check out Phone Dog's head to head Notebook2 vs Iphone5).Do your homework.  As of right now there are 3 reviews. This and two others.  The 1 star one flamed all samsung devices, so also do your homework in the reviews you read too.This is my first review but I had to set the record straight.If you can afford this, Get this!", "Date": "November 20, 2012"}, {"Title": "Hands Down THEE Best!", "Author": "Shop-A-Holic \"BeeBee\"", "ReviewID": "R2BSZP0CHFLGSF", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I have had smartphones since they practically came out. I started out with a brick of a Blackberry and boy have things changed! I was hesitant about purchasing the Samsung Galaxy Note 2 because of the hefty $299 price tag but I thought to heck with it and gave it a shot! Let me tell you...its worth every penny!SCREEN: This screen is the best I have seen on a phone. Its crisp, clear and so easy to see even in direct sunlight! Netflix, Hulu+ and GoogleTV work flawlessly and look amazing! The colors are so bright and vivid! I get compliments all the time on this aspect! I absolutely adore the HDsuperAMOLED screen!SIZE: Yes, the size is a little scary at first (5.5 inch screen!), but me being a woman, I wasn't concerned about placement (purses, ladies). I have heard a lot of people say \"It won't fit in your pocket\"...but the phone is so slim, its easy to place! They also make real nifty case/wallets for this thing!BATTERY: This battery is straight up PHENOMENAL! I only charge it at night when I go to bed (unlike my other smartphones in the past that lived on life support 24/7) and at that, I really could even go a couple days without charging. With super heavy use like Netflix, texting, taking pictures, talking on the phone a couple hours...my battery will start at 100% around 8am and be around 74% by 6pm. That is amazing in my book. That alone is the worth the price!INTERACTION: This phone comes with the hyped up S-Pen. I didn't really think I would use it a whole lot but wow was I wrong! It really is a lot of fun! You can use it to hover over your screen and see whats in certain folders (images, music, etc.). It also works as a scissors, which is nifty! You press the button and hold it and you can cut and crop anything on the screen! Its fun to quickly jot down notes in a pinch! You can send hand-written images to anyone! I love this little gadget!Overall, this phone is the best phone I have ever used. In my honest opinion, it is much better than the iPhone! Sorry Apple! This phone is just so customizable! The options are limitless! The screen is AHHH-mazing and you just cannot beat this powerhouse's battery life! Thanks Samsung! You definitely made a quality product that I am just pleased to own! Keep them coming!", "Date": "December 8, 2012"}, {"Title": "It's the size that counts.", "Author": "China Mary \"China Mary\"", "ReviewID": "RRLZ7XRGNQHNM", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Definitely faster than my Epic with the physical keyboard. No LTE on Oahu and the 4G coverage is crappy so I can't say how that goes. Wifi connects quickly. Jelly Bean is great and easy. If you're afraid to switch to Android...it's not that hard. Our 4 year old knows how to use my iPod touch and this phone. Never used Siri so I can't compare the S Voice, but it seems helpful so far. I was able to send text messages hands free while driving. It's not perfect though. I asked it to dial one thing out of my address book, and it dialed a different person. I wish that it had asked to confirm if that was the name that I said before connecting. Oh well. I even asked it, \"How much wood could a woodchuck...\" and it gave the correct answer, but it couldn't give me an answer when I asked if it liked green eggs and ham.I actually use the S pen. I did my homework last week scribbling notes on a PDF.This phone works for me because I watch a lot of videos from my memory card. They load fast and smooth. I email and text more than talk so the big phone next to my face isn't a problem. It doesn't fit in ANY of my pockets. It evens hangs out of my back pockets. Women's clothing have small pockets. If you use this for business...do you really wear pants with cargo pockets to meetings? It fits easily in purse though because it's slim. Since the screen is bigger, I have it set with bigger fonts. When it comes to music, I still prefer using my iPod classic. It just seems simpler.I miss having a physical shutter button like the Epic has. Takes good enough pictures for phone quality.The biggest plus so far is the minimal amount of bloatware that Sprint has on this compared to when I got the Epic two years ago. There was a crap load Sprint and NASCAR apps that you couldn't delete. Those are all optional now in the Play Store. Still has Swype. I can't Swype some works while holding this with one hand. Thumb won't reach across.Biggest complaint is that when any version of iphone comes out, there are hundreds of cases available before the phone is even out. I'm still waiting for Otterbox to release their cases that their website keeps saying, \"soon\". I have butter fingers. MMMmmmm, Butterfingers.Keep in mind that the screen is bigger so anyone standing around you can easily see what you're doing. I'd like to play with this and a Samsung TV to test it out.

If you turn the brightness all the way up and play with the phone constantly you will push to get 7 1/2 to 8 hours out of the battery. However that being said the auto brightness setting works well to give the proper brightness as needed.The Motion setting came activated with all items selected on my phone and it took me some time to work them all out, I would be doing something and the phone would do random things, if you haven't had a phone with motion before I recommend turning them all off to start and learning them one at a time.  The quick glance feature is fantastic, and the turn over to mute/pause function works really well.I wasn't a big fan of the UI to start with but I have grown to like it, although I still prefer the HTC UI as it seemed more polished but this is just personal preference.If you haven't installed Google now I highly recommend it, I was highly surprised after randomly installing it from a pack of programs, it sends me travel information such as travel time from my current location to home, allows you to set updates for weather, sports teams, birthdays ( synced only from google+ network at this time), appointments including the option for updated travel time to appointment location, local events, and tons of other things that make the Note II a perfect phone and planning accessory.The antenna seems to be weak (or possibly more accurate) compared to the HTC EVO 4g, the note gets 1-2 bars in places where the EVO 4G would get 4 bars or better. That being said I haven't had any problems with dropping of calls or network connection.S Suggest isn't for me the suggestions seem random and I don't think I have installed 1 suggested program.I have only used the S pen twice once the day I activated and once to try to take notes in a meeting, while serviceable I don't think it will replace pen and paper for taking notes for me any time soon.I haven't used the multi window function yet as I am still playing with all the other functions and haven't taken the time.After trying the Note II the S3 and an Iphone5 I would recommend the Note II to all but the most apple obsessed user, or a petite person worried about the size. The Note II is speedy, the screen is great, and there are a ton of great functions. The S3 while a bit smaller has all the same functions with the exception of the pen functions but not as much processor power. The Iphone5 has the fixed battery and I am not a great fan of the UI.", "Date": "December 29, 2012"}, {"Title": "Totally sold on this product!", "Author": "Amazon Customer", "ReviewID": "R3JVES9W2UPOE9", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I initially was going to upgrade to the S3 simply because I couldn't afford the extra $100 for the Note 2. However, my wife and I both were able to walk out of the store with Note 2's while spending only $300 in the process. She's an iphone convert and I've been on android devices for a few years. After doing my homework, I knew the new Note was the way to go. The speed is tremendous compared to the S2 skyrocket that I previously owned. The S pen features are a real treat as well. I've had the phone 3 days now and continue to unlock new and exciting features. If I had to pick a downer, it would be the color choices. I was hoping for the red like the S3 was offering, but definitely not a deal breaker. I have had no issues thus far converting from my old phone to this one...just wish I had more time to explore it.

I am not going to sit here and compare it to other manufacturers as every phone is unique and fits people in a different way. I will however talk about why this is the best phone for me. The S3 was a great device and I loved everything about it, but I always felt like I needed a slightly larger screen. 5.5\" is a large screen. I will admit that when I set the two phones next to each other I was shocked at how much larger the Note 2 was. The size of this phone will deter a lot of people and that's fine. This phone is not designed for everyone. I LOVE the larger screen. I have never understood how people could text or email on smaller 4\" screens. I have man hands that come with man fingers and my thumb can cover half of the keyboard on those smaller devices. Not for me. The features of this phone are beyond what most people would ever need or use, but it is nice to have them just in case. The quadcore processor is noticably faster than the dualcore that was put in the CDMA versions of the S3. Screen is equally amazing just on a larger scale. I feel like Android finally has an OS that I can feel comfortable with. I started way back with Froyo and thought they had a long way to go. Gingerbread always left me with the Linux feeling. Honeycomb was short lived on tablets and ICS was like Vista for me. More problems than it was hyped up to fix. Jelly Bean is like Win7 for me. Perfect. I love eerything about it. The look, the power, the smooth operation, and features included with it. Touchwiz has some nice tweeks as well. Coming from owning HTC for the last 4 years (excluding my recent S3) I was very use to the Sense features and grew tired of how bloated it had become. Sense seemed to take control over my device and I found myself rooting to remove it. Touchwiz is subtle and less intrusive to the user experience of the device and offers a lot of unique features. I have yet to figure out how I lived before NFC. I use this feature every single day and it makes life so simple. NFC tags with NFC Task Launcher(Free in Google Play) is a marriage that will last for me. If you are looking for a powerful, beautiful, and large device then this is for you. The size is not for everyone. If you are confortable with the size of the S3 and want a little more size(thats what she said) then you will do great with this device. Almost every retailer I have visited has a Note 2 on display for you to look at or play with. You do become use to the size very quickly to be fair and when you grab someone elses phone it will feel absolutely tiny in your hand.

That's another story.Moved to Sprint and purchased a marble white Samsung Galaxy Note II.I am experiencing the same superb degree of excellence with this device as I did with ATT.The Note II is a beautiful phone. Physical construction of very good and form factor is perfect for my needs.If you think your pockets are too small for this phone, then you need to re-think your clothing situation. Re-purchase clothing which is adequate for this device. It is that good.Quad 1.6 processor power is notable. Very fast machine. Phone quality (voice) is excellent. It very simply, works. Every function of the phone, that is.Bluetooth communicates with my Prius's Bluetooth effortlessly. WiFi works perfectly. The Android 4.1.1 operating system (a.k.a., Jelly Bean; whatever) works fantastically. The Google-system does everything it should do without a hassle. The Google voice search is better and faster than my family's five (5) iPhone 4Ss (yes, we have 6 phones on our Sprint account; an exception to their 5-on-1 plan policy; another story), and the Google voice search system works great; but I rarely use it.My primary reason for purchasing this phone is its size and fantastic performance. Both are very impressive. Together, it's a masterpiece.Viewing data on a 5.5\" screen of this quality is a pleasure. I generally use the large screen to check aviation weather. There, looking at either textual, radar, satellite, or other planning weather systems is made easy by the strong processing capabilities of this phone, and its excellent display. Just beautiful.Battery life? So far, I'm experiencing a full-day (i.e., 12-hours on this large 3100miliamp battery. There may even be a lager battery (which would be even better), but bone-stock from the Samsung factory, the battery is amazing.Speaker phone is excellent. Viewing movies, amazingly beautiful.Every function of the device is solid.Touch screen works perfectly, looks fantastic.Charging systaem works as-advertised (mini USB).This is simply the best phone device I have ever seen. Simply fantastic.If you can tolerate a large device (and there are some considerations), then I highly recommend this superbly designed and built Samsung Galaxy Note II device.Top of the Line is right.It's large.

I have owned many Tablet PCs, tablets and phones over the years. I go all the way back to my Palm pilot wanting to draw something decent on a device like this and it's never EVER paid off. I've owned every Palm since the original Pilot, owned an Evo 4G, an Evo 4G LTE, rooted them both nine ways to Sunday. I have even wasted my money and bought styluses for my iPad in the past always dreaming I could one day draw on one of these stinkin' things. But it was always to no avail, since they're all junk in terms of trying to actually DRAW on the screen. Sure some will say that you can write on an iPad and bla bla bla but the truth is that if you're a real artist, it's always akin to dipping a brick in ink and writing on the wall. It sucks, and it's pretty maddening to boot since it's clearly POSSIBLE to do in the first place and electronic makers (Read: APPLE)purposely do not want to add this feature for some asinine reason.No nothing is like drawing on an actual Cintiq or a tablet PC... until the Note 2. yes I said it and I meant it. If you don't know what a Cintiq is then don't bother reading the rest of this review, but if you want a true digital sketchbook that actually fits in your pocket, buy the Note 2.I won't go to far into detail here about the phone and features itself, as many other capable people have done so already. Besides, if you're reading this particular review you're an artist and wondering if you can draw with this thing or not since all anyone ever talks about is the stupid S-Note app (which is actually okay, but more or less useless if you're an artist. Anyway, this phone is exactly what you're looking for. You can draw, paint, and design right on the tiny 6\" screen. You can get pretty detailed too which is great. There are a lot of apps you can download but most of them really don't work so well for my purposes which is straight drawing.What does work is Sketchbook Mobile and it works almost as well as the desktop app minus one glaring omission in the form of a lasso tool. Other than that, it's a very well done app for drawing and pairing it with the Note 2 makes it pretty amazing. I keep shaking my head in disbelief as I drawing with this thing, amazed that I'm doing it with my PHONE!!! The Note 2 is hands down the best phone I've owned simply because of the S-pen. The rest of the phone is great too, don't get me wrong but I bought it for the drawing ability and it delivers in spades. It's great! Armed with Sketchbook Mobile, this baby is like a tiny Cintiq in your pocket, and it works as advertised. Sketchbook Mobile even has a way to disable the palm recognition so you can rest your palm on the screen as you draw! Plus essentially any Wacom penabled stylus will work with the phone so you could get a different stylus if the S-Pen feels too small for you. Axiotron's penabled pens work fine with it as well and even the pen's eraser works on the phone believe it or not! I wish the S-Pen did that itself but I guess you can't have everything.Anyway, to sum it all up, if you want to draw on your phone, pull your wallet out right now and buy this phone.

I have been using Android phones for the past few years, and have never had any complains with the OS. The S-Pen helped me make that decision, as did the size and speed of the phone. Before getting my hands on one, I worried about the size. I don't find it too large at all (granted, I am a big guy), and find it the perfect size for e-book reading without needing to carry a bag around everywhere I go.With moderate to heavy use, I find myself making it at least 10-16 hours with the battery still at 35% or so when I plug the charger in at night. It charges pretty quickly with the OEM charger, and the car charger I had previously for my last two phones (EVO and EVO3d) doesn't seem to have any issues charging the battery.I haven't played with the alarm settings too much, short of setting some alarms, but it seems that there isn't a way to change the default alarm sound. I'll post an update if I find one. Or if you know of a way to do that, post a comment below. Note: At the time, I'm not looking to root the phone.I was eligible for an upgrade from Sprint, and decided to buy the phone through Amazon WIreless because it was a hundred dollars cheaper there. Someone told me that it was because it comes from Sprint with a 64gb SD card (which I have also been told it does not). Even if it does, I spent less money purchasing an SD card separately.The phone is fast, responsive and I've had no buggy issues with it like I've had with previous smartphones, including the Samsung Hero and Moment, the latter making me swear off Samsung phones forever until now.One concern I had was whether or not I would like the keyboard. I do. The swipe to text function is almost as good as Swype, and the addition of numbers at the top of the keyboard makes it so much easier to use, especially when entering things like passwords.I'm loving this phone/phablet.

It's not designed to compete with a polished, perfected-out-of-the-box experience. Which, as a former iPhone user, is exactly why I chose this product: whereas the iPhone starts off feeling perfect and eventually reveals its limitations, the Note II works out of the box but needs a lot of customization. So, to start off with the things that were a bit annoying out of the box:-Comes with a SwiftKey keyboard, which for people new to Android is a custom keyboard that predicts what you're going to type, but it's suboptimal compared to the SwiftKey programs you can get free or for a small fee through Google Play (or, I suppose, the Amazon App Store for Android). The reason for this is that the official SwiftKey, as opposed to Samsung's customized version, can actually learn from your social network posts, emails, Twitter, etc., instead of using a one-size fits all solution.-Has a somewhat clunky Samsung UI with some confusing features, like a \"simple\" and \"complex\" version that don't actually work the way they say. This can be supplanted or customized away.-Has some really good stuff that works with the S-Pen (the stylus built into the device), but it's not well documented.Finally, make sure you have a data plan that lets you use a lot of data, because this machine is a multimedia beast!", "Date": "December 14, 2012"}, {"Title": "Amazing in all its giant glory!", "Author": "Richard Osterhout", "ReviewID": "R18ON2L971VYH3", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This was a phone i was purchasing as my first contract phone ever, i have always used pay as you go or contract free phones/plans. The immediate difference was the quality of all the services i had, internet was fast and no matter where i went i had service(this is more about the provider i went with) but after these, the smaller, less noticeable details began to show. First, the stylus(s-pen) works amazingly with this phone, every feature i used worked just as well, and some even better using this, texting, navigating web pages, and using almost any app. Next was the quality of the things it did, whenever i would run apps that on my other phone that would have a delay, it kept on going strong, pandora, emulators, and multiple tabs of internet, all of them and more ran perfectly. And the thing i like the most on the phone is the motion commands. While sometimes they are not very necessary, they are fun to do and give a variety and the things i can do with the phone. Last, is the sheer size of this phone, it is MASSIVE, and it is amazing, i have had the phone for over a month now, i got used to it in about 2 days, and now all other phones just seem tiny and i don't see a reason to ever want a phone that small again. i recommend this phone 1000%!", "Date": "August 29, 2013"}, {"Title": "BEST PHONE EVEEEERRRRRRR - with a couple minor hiccups", "Author": "Ponskippa", "ReviewID": "R24CLR437LGXXD", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Before i talk about it, i am going to say i upgraded from an iPhone 4. So you Apple fanboys don't say i am just a hater. :DI won't go too much into talking down the iPhone since most of you looking to switch from apple to android already know what you DO NOT like about your iPhone. Here are the reasons I LOVE this phone.1.)Android is Open Source - Meaning I dont have to jailbreak or even install a \"custom ROM\" to customize my phone to my liking. Just about anything you want is probably in the Play store.2.) Easy PC connectivity - Again because Android has an open platform. I plug in my phone to the USB port and BAM i can easily access my folders and just as easily transfer ANY kind of media file onto my phone. SWEEEETNOW ... yes there are many Android phones out there, but the Note 2 rocks because the screen is HUGE and beautiful.I dont use the S pen all that much, but in the few occasions that I do, it really comes in handy.The micro sd slot is a plus, especially if you like to put movies or photos to share on your device.On the downside, Samsung takes their sweet time to push Android firmware updates out to devices.The best thing and worst thing about this phone is that it's so BIG. Haha. Its just hard to find a nice protective case for this phone without adding a whole lot of bulk or too hard on your hands.

Be sure you do your homework and check Sprint's coverage in your area or  you'll end up like me:  paying $100 a month for what is mostly  3g service.

People ask \"Is this really a phone\" was one reaction I got. It is an amazing piece of hardware. I have used Android devices starting from Cupcake version, used iPhone, HP Veer with webOS, Windows 7.5 HTC Titan 2. This phone is the sleekest and one of the best so far. It is fabulous!  I find the big size to be very good and not a problem at all. Will the Galaxy Note 3 be 6\" ?!Out of the box, connect to wireless and get the phone logged into Google account. The advantage of Android phones is that once you are logged into Google universe, everything gets synced up especially if you have been using Android.  The position of power button is at an excellent position for your hand on this Note 2. The additional LED for notification on top is very handy. Listen Apple? The camera serves some really futuristic ideas also. It can check if you are looking at the phone and disable screen lock (even if you set timeout to say 30 sec). Also it can serve as password unlock. Amazing! These can be set from Settings Menu.The Android version as of Oct 26 2012 is Jellybean 4.1.1. Kernel version is 3.0.31-259982. Model GT-N7100. I got the 64 GB microSD card. Get this mobileUltra, it is the latest as of Oct 2012. (SanDisk 64GB Mobile Ultra MicroSDXC Class 6 Memory Card with SD Adapter - Retail Packaging. Settings show an available space of 59.45 GB. So along with 16 GB built (system shows only around 10.46 GB), my Note 2 has 80 GB memory. With music in the  Google Music cloud, I intent to use the memory for video/pictures as a camcorder/camera.I strongly suggest going through Settings and customizing many things as per your desire. I did Voice Input, Keyboard (this comes with English(UK), change to English(US) for example. Fiddle around the settings and you will be amazed how much you can customize. I also did Battery % to appear in notification bar.One thing I found the default keyboard did not show Mic button. I realized it was next to Sym button. Long press it and choose Mic. And then on, it will appear in default keyboard. Also customize the accent. It can do magic for typing. I type paragraphs at a time effortlessly. This is Google backend servers at work. The Mic on Samsung Galaxy Note 2 does a fantastic job!S-Pen, Ah.. I was truly impressed. You have to use these to believe it. The note taking was very fluid. Samsung seem to have nailed it. I wrote up an equation in Equation mode - x^5 = x^2 + 2x + .... Something completely random, another one d/dx(an equation) and it recognized perfectly and asked it to search, it went to Wolfram Alpha and solved it. It is at first unbelievable and then it starts to sink in this is a computer program made well. Like it should be in first place! Export to pdf is very good. The main thing is the pen is very fluid and feels like a fountain pen writing.Overall, the phone feels very smooth and snappy. The screen is crisp and clear. Apps can even be multi screened. Samsung approved apps can be placed two in a screen. Eg. Maps on top and email on bottom portion. I doubt I will use this, but handy.One gripe I have with this phone is speaker is on the back. Typically if you lie the phone down, the speaker is blocked on bottom. I wish the speakers were in the side. This is a design decision and not sure why phones have speaker on back. But the speaker volume is very high, so I am not complaining too much.One big pain point with Android is once you purchased/downloaded for free Apps, they cannot be permanently deleted. So even if you get a junk app, and delete immediately they are permanently there in your Google Play store. From the phone's play store I got 300+ Apps. One cannot choose 50 apps and say get all these. You have to do one by one. After getting one, the screen resets to beginning. So I went to a computer browser and pushed apps to pone. This is easier and faster.UPDATE: In Jelly bean, you can make the apps vanish from the list entirely. Look at comment #1 from Mark. In the My Apps in settings, at the end of the app there is a circle with a / in middle. Tap on it and confirm to remove. This is great, but if you have a list of 200 apps, you have do this one by one. Also the list resets to beginning after each delete.Some of apps I have as of now :Amazon MobileAndroid Status : Android Status app shows ARMv7, Max Freq 1.6 GHz, BogoMips 1592.52 Memory 1.79 GB, Free 365 MB, Internal Storage 10.46 GB Free 7.18 GB.

The Note II qualifies on that score but with all the excellent video reviews one can find on the net as to the Note II's various capabilities and functions, the task of getting up to speed is less daunting and make no mistake, the video reviews are far more helpful than trying to read your way through the tutorials.  I've had the Note II for a little over a week at this writing and am still learning the various nuances but must say I'm far from mastering the phone.  So far, it's been all I had hoped for or expected and then some!I've had a long history with Galaxy devices in the past which definitely helps in already knowing the basic commands and navigation tools.  The S Pen is obviously the game changer with the Note II and by understanding its capabilities is what sets the Note II apart from all other comparable devices including the iphone.  Being able to take a note on a thought while talking on the phone is nice as is the ability to go back to review it later or even incorporate the note into other functions, ditto the screen captures and noting and cutting out snippets of various web sites then sending that info onto someone via email is cutting edge, at least for me.I haven't gotten into the picture or video noting as yet but will go boldly forward once I'm on solid ground with the basic Note II functions.  Depending on your time and investment of same in learning the device, I would caution to go slowly because there is so much the Note II can do and be in your life so it makes little sense to go at warp speed in attempting to wrestle it to the mat and declare yourself the champion of all that is Note II in a day or two.

So thats an extra 10 dollars a month  on top of my 69.99/ for my 450 minutes and \"\"\"unlimited data\"\"\". Why would i pay and extra 10 a month when i should have unlimited data with my plan anyways. The sprint rep said that is a charge required for smart phones which is pretty much most phones now adays. The signal at my house is bad but this has nothing to do with amazon. I just wish they wouldve told me that the phone was refurbish or used instead of listing it as new...................", "Date": "April 26, 2013"}, {"Title": "3 Phones + White Noise!", "Author": "Justin", "ReviewID": "RDIS1QDAACLEF", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "Phone #3 in a week....bad luck? Probably not.First phone: Speaker quality during calls was awful. I would hear white noise (like a radio) when the other person speaks. Volume on low and people were inaudible and muffled.  Turn the volume up one or two clicks and the whole phone would rattle. Speaker phone was hardly loud enough on full blast and rattled, too. Sprint reps agreed.Second phone: Sound quality tolerable. That's it. Not even good, just tolerable. Still white noise when other person talks. In less than 3 hrs the touch sensor started messing up. By the next morning I could not unlock the screen anymore by touch. Possibly a software issue, but still....Third phone: Speaker phone cracks and rattles once I hit half volume. I can understand caller clearly now but I still have to tolerate that dam white noise?!?!?!Everything else seems amazing. I'm just dumbfounded that a phone company pushes a top of the line phone and forgets you need to be able to make phone calls.", "Date": "January 3, 2013"}, {"Title": "I had the hope this will be the one I've been waiting for, but.... was wrong!", "Author": "Slava", "ReviewID": "R1JSVG5YZYLKIT", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "I had the hope this will be the one I've been waiting for, but.... was wrong!
