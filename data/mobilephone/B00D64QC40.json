Cannot say I'm disappointed. In fact, I am almost blown away by the fact that for the price, it performs so well and I am a tech lover. Only thing I didn't like was that the charging port is on top so I took off 1 star. So the missing star is for cosmetics,  but would give 5 stars for functionality. I ordered a 5.3 s.

Arrived very quickly on Amazon and was much cheaper than Walmart. It was hassle free to order and get delivered. (Ordered it on a Tuesday, got it Friday that same week) and it's not too hard to learn how to use. Other revews were right, the manual is not much help, but you can use your common sense to know what the icons on the top of the screen mean on the phone. I have mine working on only ONE Sim card and the speed is fine. The phone came clean and the battery came OUTSIDE the phone so you have to put that yourself. One thing that does scare me about the phone is that the back cover of the phone is quite tough to get off because its so thick and I was afraid to break it, But it's easy once you get the hang of it. I love my phone, and I totally recommend it to anyone looking for a great quality Android smartphone but don't wanna pay the price for it!", "Date": "October 21, 2013"}, {"Title": "Best big-screen phone for the money", "Author": "Kathy Freund", "ReviewID": "R374FE0T513GUD", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I got the Studio 5.0s about 3 months ago and I love it.  It is not a top-tier super fast phone, but it is not supposed to be. For $200 it runs fast on wifi or H/3G (I have it on straight talk), hold and runs as many apps and games as you want it to, and has a big, bright, sharp screen. I use it effectively for social networking, watching videos, reading and testing the mobile versions of websites I build. Great alternative to the $600 options out there if you are not looking to pay for the name.", "Date": "November 13, 2013"}, {"Title": "Nice phone", "Author": "Brett", "ReviewID": "REOTUDB8HFYOL", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I got this phone because I switched from a windows phone and wanted something close to a galaxy phone that was unlocked. It works on straight talk with 3g but shows as H so probably a hybrid (not 100% just guessing) since the sim is using both 2g and 3g.The sim card slots are labeled so if you want 3g use the one labeled 2g/3g. Call quality is good the only down side is the charge time for the battery. To sort of deal with that get a battery charging app that will somewhat speed up the charging but not by much. No phone cases for it yet just the gel one that comes with it.Overall its a decent phone for the price. You may have too explain that this phone isn't a galaxy phone to your friends because they won't believe it at first glance.", "Date": "December 18, 2013"}, {"Title": "Nice product.", "Author": "mallikarjunudu chittari", "ReviewID": "R39CQWXGEMIS8Z", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Nice product and does everything that of a same range branded smart phone does.Good phone for those who don't want to spend hundreds of dollars on branded phones.NOTE: once you buy it, You need to take wireless system update for better battery performance.Pros: 1) sleek design and light weight 2) Performance fast 3) high resolutionCons:low quality speaker", "Date": "December 27, 2013"}, {"Title": "BLU STUDIO 5.0 S D570i", "Author": "Andrew Taormina \"taoand\"", "ReviewID": "R2WP8IJXZBDMUO", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This has been a very good purchase!

Pretty accurate with everything.  I love the DUAL SIM card since I live in San Diego and cross over the Mexico border, and my phone is fully unlocked it can pick up International companies (purchase a Tel Cel Sim card) it works or just use my ATT GoPhone Sim Card works too.CON ~ hard to find a gel cover or any protective cover for my phone since the size is slightly different than the Samsung.

It still worked ok on T-mobile; well enough that I was able to skype for 2 hours straight in a rural area so that my sister could virtually attend my dad's funeral (this was an emergency purchase as my prior phone passed at the same time as my dad).  Screen is fantastic, phone is robust...all in all great.I'm tempted to give 4 stars as I fobbed it off on my son, and it has developed a defect where it turns off for an hour, then turns back on.  Very odd.  It isn't the sim, the battery, powersupply, static...so I'm at a loss.  Probably a bad memory chip, or the voltage regulator is going.  That being said, it has survived 6 months in my son's saggy jeans, and I really can't ding the phone for that.Basically, this is a Samsung Galaxy for 1/4 the price.", "Date": "April 15, 2014"}, {"Title": "Not worth your time!", "Author": "Felix C.

It's a worthless piece of junk, which explains why it's so cheap. Avoid cheap \"smart\" phones. I wasted my money on this one, but I don't feel that bad about it. At least, I now know that Blu phones are the very worst out there. Therefore, I advise you to put your money into something else or simply wait until you're able to afford a real smart phone, such as the Sony Xperia series.For the hassles it put me through, I give it a star.
