{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Great for web browsing", "Author": "Richard Hayward", "ReviewID": "R1RKMLFWUUOCSX", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I've had this phone for over a week now.  I've barely used it for calls and I am even having trouble working out which buttons to press for calls.  I must say it was beautifully packaged like an expensive box of chocolates.  The handset was not expensive though, since it was provided free of charge by the telecommunications carrier which I use.I mostly use it for web browsing.  I found the supplied software useless for this purpose, but quickly downloaded Opera directly to the phone.  This I found very useful for setting up bookmarks to mobile sites.  This is my first web enabled handset, and I've found it great for checking the weather report in the morning.  Speed to download web pages was very fast, even though this is due to the mobile phone company service.I've been unable to connect the phone to the computer.  I have no need for syncing the phone with my PC, but I would like to be able to download the latest firmware for my handset if that is available.  I've been unable to locate any information about how to download the firmware, so the inability to connect to the PC is notI didn't find the games of any interest at all.  None of the other applications that you can download were of any use or of any interest to me either.I find the phone a delight to experience in general since its beautifully designed, but sometimes its really impractical in the way it operates.  The phone controls via the glass interface are often delayed in responding.  There are so many options its confusing, and sometimes difficult to select the right button.  Entering text can be very annoying, and I wish there was an easier way to enter standard characters such as \".\" in a web address.  The angle of the keypad (slightly lower than the main plane of the phone) can lead to cramp in your thumb.  Still I believe I'll eventually get used to it.  However, I've marked it down one star for this.", "Date": "October 1, 2009"}, {"Title": "nice looking phone but touch screen has response issues", "Author": "V. Chu", "ReviewID": "RW3W3RWEYF6YY", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "Phone definitely looks nice, sleek and classy, with a solid feel, smooth slider, and fairly easy to feel keypad.  The one place it fails (or the one I bought) is freezing, especially associated with the touch pad.  Not a matter of aim, but 50% of the time, touching the correct touch key does not trigger a response, or the phone freezes for a bit before responding.  Less of an issue when using keypad or hard buttons only, but it still freezes up at least once or twice per text msg (using keypad).  One can get around using the touchpad to an extent, but the up/down/left/right function is exclusive to it so its unavoidable.", "Date": "July 6, 2009"}, {"Title": "Slim, Stylish, Slightly Above Average Phone", "Author": "R. Mark", "ReviewID": "R1G0PCBXZIXV6Z", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "DesignThis phone as you can tell from pictures is very good looking from the leather trim to the carbon fiber screen which is practically unbrakable which saves it from scrathes, It always manages to catch a couple eyes whenever I bring it out because of its unique look with its touch pads and touch screen ONLY for media such as games, pictures, music app etc.The SpecsThere are 2 cameras on the back is a superb 5MP lense, on the front a maybe 1.3MP camera im not to sure, used for video calling and can take pictures thanks to a java application i have , well for any1 like me who just snaps shots from time to time the 5MP lense is superb, video capturing is as well superb you can zoom during video captures set speeds from fast to slow before you capture a video, not during it, but I find that capturing fast/slow motion videos requires alot of light so it works best oustside during the day.Java apps/games work good but it doesn't support 3d games fully it shows at its frame, i mainly use opera, a browser that is just amazing its like real web browsing a must have app far better than the standard browser already on the phone, and no its not touchscreen during browsing and there is no on screen keyboard.I have 8gb micro sd card within my phone which it doesn't fully support, it FULLY supports up to 4gb micro sd cards thats how much it was made to read and write but when I put in the 8gb I was only able to save up to 4gigs of picture and video taking, so with the other 4gbs you have to fill it up with music/videos from your pc, so basically it can read/play 8gbs of storage but not write more the 4gbs of storage, but it does everything well it just takes time to load all my music which i have over a 1000+ songs which can be set as ring tones, you can drag and drop basically anything from music videos(may require converting) to games to adobe files.ConsThe battery life is alright you need to lower the brightness for it to be longer lasting of course.It freezes at times so you will have remove the battery to restart it.You have set up all the profiles for internet/java/youtube.Hard to see the screen under direct sunlight unless u bring up the brightness level.Writing only up to 4gbs of storage on micro sd cards with more than 4gbs.Basically its a good phone,very attractive good for traveling,I plan on upgrading soon to a more powerful phone soon there is a upgraded version of this phone that maybe sold on amazon im not sure the *KF757* which includes wifi i am not too sure of what else ill look it up, well thats it email me for any questions.*Also I have this phone with T-Mobile and it doesn't support 3G.", "Date": "August 6, 2009"}, {"Title": "Light and Stylish!!!", "Author": "Bradley", "ReviewID": "RI2UJ5P0RKF3H", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Its very slim.
