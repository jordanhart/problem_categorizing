I liked the dual-sim feature (1 international and one local SIM card) and didn't want to bring my more-expensive phone with me when it might get lost or stolen.THE ONE MAJOR PROBLEM (AND HOW TO FIX):This phone comes with < 100 MB of space to download apps.  It would not run a 20 MB app that I downloaded.  It does have a micro-SD port.  There is another problem: Newer versions of android will only let certain apps be 'moved' to the SD card.  The fix is as follows:1. Buy a micro-SD card (currently approx. $10 on Amazon for 8 GB)2. Follow the directions here: [...]  This only took about 5 min.  As implied, you need to plug your phone into the computer's USB port before step 2.3. Now, download apps, they should end up on your SD card.As far as everything else goes: It is about as expected (great value!):General - Runs well, is fast enough, hasn't been crashing. Comes with a rubber case and a screen protector.SIM - 2 slots, easy to select which to use for data, txt, voice, etc and to switch betweenSCREEN - Mediocre resolution, but nice and bright.CAMERA - Mediocre at best, but good enough.  Can pick up txt and translate using google translate app.VOICE - Works wellWIFI - Works wellMOBILE DATA - Have not testedGPS - Works well, even with Mapfactor (free offline navigation)BLUE TOOTH - Have not tested.Overall, I would recommend it highly if you are willing to put in the time to fix the memory issue, as above.", "Date": "January 3, 2014"}, {"Title": "Blu Dash D171a - Unlocked -Black", "Author": "tiny", "ReviewID": "R2JB0J9YLF7PN6", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I got the phone and 1 week later it started going funny on me. On the picture it showed WhattsApp on the phone i thought it came with it also Facebook i had to download it.The phone runs out of battery power very quickly i would advise for people that has a car to get a car charger for this phone as it will be needed.. You cannot buy the battery for the phone any where only in the UK is selling it at this time. The phone also freezes a lot of the time to the point you have to take the battery out and start the phone again.The phone as well just switches it self off for no reason at all.Other than that i guess the phone does work.", "Date": "January 18, 2014"}, {"Title": "Great Phone!!", "Author": "Evette", "ReviewID": "R1HJ3X2ABI2XB1", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "For the price this phone is excellent..
