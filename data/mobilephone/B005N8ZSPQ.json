{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Great Android alternative", "Author": "J. Banks", "ReviewID": "R224CKO86KJH3U", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "In short, I love this phone.  I currently own 2 of them.  One for my wife, and the other for me.  The first one I purchased was this one on Amazon, so I could decide if I wanted to switch from an Android device to a Windows Phone.  Needless to say I was blown away.  I was always a fan of the flexibility of Android, and loved adding custom software and Roms to my phone.  My wife on the other hand just wanted a phone that worked consistently.  Her HTC Mytouch4G was getting slow and buggy, so I decided to have her try a Windows phone since I had heard nothing but good things (We are on Cincinnati Bell, so an iPhone was not an option.  Although I don't think I would have chosen that over the Radar anyway).  When my wife got her Windows phone she loved the interface, and the integration with Facebook.  She didn't like that MyFitness Pal app didn't have a barcode scanner (it does now), and that there is no Words with Friends (still isn't), but those were small gripes in comparison to having a phone that didn't hang and need to be rebooted daily.  Speaking of daily, under typical usage neither of our Android devices would last more than 8 hours on a charge.  The Windows phone will go a day and a half (still no blackberry) but much better.  Well, as you may have guessed, I gave up my modded Android HTC G2 for a Radar as well, and haven't regretted it for a second.  Having your hands on one of these things is believing.  If you get a chance to try one out take a friend with an android or iphone with you.  Go to Youtube and stream a video, and watch how much faster the Windows phone can do it.  It is really amazing.Pros:Slick interfaceJust WorksGood Camera (Rear facing)Decent front cameraSolid HTC buildCons:Windows app market much smaller than Android or iPhoneUpdate 7/16/13  I Sold on my HTC Radar some months ago, and I have to say it held up really well.  I still don't think you can go wrong with this phone, especially if you aren't heavily invested in another ecosystem.Additional Pros I left out originally:SkydriveThe con of the app market has been mostly mitigated with a lot of official apps released in the last year.  Facebook, Twitter, Youtube, Linked In, ebay, Amazon etc.  Still no Instagram, but check out Instance for a good substitute if you want that functionality.", "Date": "April 2, 2012"}, {"Title": "Incredibly Beautiful. Yet Flawed", "Author": "Robb Cairl \"Robb\"", "ReviewID": "R3JNTC26O5FWNE", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I switched to this device the day it came to the US after following it since the announcement of its release. Let me start by making a short list of the pros and consPros:-Incredible Battery life-Clean, bugless, OS-Never once needed to reset due to it freezing-Great Camera-Integration with Windows Live, and Facebook messenger(Will explain)-Navigation is great-Cons: (All will be explained below)-Live Tiles are not as informative as you may think-No paypal integration-Downloaded apps dont really \"notify\" you-It takes far to long to get anywhere on the device-No upgrade to windows phone 8-No Interop Unlock Ability-Loading Custom OS is exceedingly difficult-Issues with Build-No Expandable memory-Complete lack of cases-Loss of battery life-\"Walled Garden Approach\"Pro Explanation:The Integreation with facebook and windows live messenge is absolutely phenominal, how the system works is when you recieve a message from either of these services, you simply recieve it the same as you would a text, and you have the ability to switch back and forth seamlessly between these services when texting. this is where windows phone 7.5 excells with integration.Cons Explanation:-Live Tiles: Most of the live tiles that are not OEM software are very badly put together and will only update display if the app is opened, which defeats the purpose in the first place.-Paypal Integration: There is absolutely NO native paypal integration, i run a business, in which we use paypal almost everyday, it is extraordinarly aggravating that paypal is not there, and the third party apps aimed at this are mediocre at best.-\"Notifications\": other than the OEM software and the Email Clients there are no real \"Notifications\" this includes skype calls, skype messages, viber, kik, etc etc anything that says it has a push notification ability really wont work if your phone is in your pocket not in use, now if you have it awake browsing the web then you will get notifications, but this excludes skype.-\"Getting Places\": let me start by saying that even withoug a password it requires  8 clicks/touchs/whatever you wanna call user input to get to any single photo on your phone, to dial any phone number its 4, to get your texts its 3. and although the ani,ations are nice, they do slow down the device(not performance wise, use wise) to the point where if im telling a story and remember i have a pic to go with it, it would take 10-20 seconds to get to that picture. althought that may not sound like much, i assure you it is.-Windows phone 8: It has already been announced that there will be no support for windows phone 8 on any windows phone 7 device, they will recieve windows 7.8 by the holidays, it will \"essentially\" the same thing, however it really just the ability to resize live tiles, you will still have no paypal integration, and none of the other features windows phone 8 sports.-For you developers,hackers, and tweakers out there: The interop unlock(same as root) on this device is nearly impossibly, as it is on all second generation htc windows phones, you can developer unlock it however the allows you the ability to do little besides deploying apps, and if your interested in flashing to a custom rom is also nearly impossible, and the only options buried deep in the XDA developers forum require about $30 worth or equipment and alot of skill to accomplish-Build Quality:  While this phone is unibody aluminium, you will notice the bottom plastic peice on the phone which when removed both turns off the phone and allows you to put in your sim card. the fact that this turns off the phone is a big issue as the littl piece is not secure at all, and comes out with relatively no effort, and can result in your phon being off in your pocket for hours without you knowing if one of the clips comes off and the peices is still somewhat attached to the device preventing you from feeling it in your pocket.-No SD card option: not much to explain about it, no SD support, and left at 8gb internal, there isnt much room for anything-Lack of cases: There is a complete lack of anything case related to this phone the only reputable company that makes one is Incipio and that still leaves much to be desired, the only other cases are the cheap .99 cent plastic ones. and as this phone scratchs suprisingly easily a case is a must.-\"The Case Of the missing battery life\": When i first got this device it got about 36 hours of light use and a full day of HEAVY use, however after recieving an update it gets 12-18 on light and 4-8 on moderate to heavy use, while this is still phemoninal i do miss my 36 hour phone.-\"Welcomed To the walled Garden\"; This is in some way just like an appl device. you are given this phone, and that petty much it, its features are the end of the buck, and what i mean by that is What you see is what you get, meaning if you want better battery life and you want an app like juice defender that controls data, this is impossible. they dont exist, why?, because all windows app only run on the surface, they cannot chnage the state or settings of the phone, only the apps in which they reside. this is the same for any app you could want that would have the potential to change the settings on your phone and access your phones OEM hard/software, it just is not possible.The Wrap up:Now although i listed many negative things about this phone, i still love this phone very much and within the walled garden that is windows phone 7.5 it does the barebones of what i need it to, and its really beautiful and fun to work with, i would reccomend it if you want something fun, simple to use, or able to integrate with windows 7 or 8. my list of negatives is only to let you in on some important things before you purchase.", "Date": "December 3, 2012"}, {"Title": "Awesome Iphone Alternative", "Author": "Saint04", "ReviewID": "R28KLTQIX28212", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I purchased this phone through Amazon as an alternative option to purchasing it for retail price at a Tmobile store. If not for an aggressive price point, I wouldn't have purchased this phone. Also, I received the tmobile version of this phone. The phone even works with 4g and has the tmobile badging.I replaced my Samsung Exhibit II with this phone. My android phone was continually lagging, overheating and crashing on me. I feel this is a hardware/driver issue and not Andriod OS issue. However, I do feel that there is a lot less bloat on the Windows OS on the HTC. Also, the app store was an easy transition for all my needs. The OS integrated into my Facebook, gmail, google calendar accounts. A neat feature is local scout. Local scout gives you categories such as restaurants that will inform you of all the local events pertaining to the selected category. This phone however is not as superior as google maps in android, but it works well. The only feature I can think that I use that google maps offered that MS maps app did not offer is to avoid toll roads and high ways. I used this feature frequently because I own two-scooters that I enjoy riding on occasion and avoiding toll roads when I'm in my car. The OS on this device is fairly intuitive with a slight learning curb. The OS also seems well polished and it runs very fluidly/smoothly.The build quality of this HTC phone is top notch. It has gorilla glass from my understanding. The body is white plastic (high quality feeling) on aluminum.The battery life for this phone is excellent in regards to talk time (I can probably get 7-8 hours of talk time). The standby time is only about three days with minimal use. This is better than the Samsung Exhibit II I had sold over ebay.This phone uses a regular SIM card in contrast to the new micro SIM cards. I originally purchased a Lumia 710 offering a micro SIM card, but was not happy at all with the very poor plastic build quality. I returned it to Amazon immediately. I'm glad because I met two other people with this phone that were very displeased with it.The front facing images on the phone are touch (capacitive) and not buttons. I do not like using push button on a touch phone. The lock/unlock, volume rocker and camera hard-buttons are acceptions and actually are preferred; but not for interacting and navigating within the phone with its touch interface.The sound quality is very good and gets to be pretty loud. The speaker phone is mediocre. The speaker phone gets workably loud (does not work well in a car with road noise etc), the microphone is sensitive enough for regular conversation. No one has complained yet about me using it now for two to three weeks. While the speaker for speakerphone is ok, the microphone works great.The phone takes sharp picture and balances the lighting well.The screen is high resolution and adequately bright in most conditions. However, the screen is not bright enough to overcome an afternoon backdrop of the sun and sky. Colors appear very vibrant.I also like the \"attentive phone\" features allowing for me to turn the phone on its face to automatically activate the speakerphone, pocket mode increases the ring volume, flip to mute allows me to see who's calling and I can place it back on its face to mute the ringing, and quiet ring on pick up lowers the ring volume when I pick up the phone or remove it from my pocket (this feature does not conflict with the pocket/purse mode sensors/feature).I'm extremely satisfied with this phone overall and wouldn't hesitate to purchase it again.", "Date": "October 5, 2012"}, {"Title": "Its Great As described", "Author": "Chaiyo", "ReviewID": "R1WXTFBHZDV4VT", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "It's great honestly. when i had received it, the whole Phone itself was in GREAT shape, the back cover though was chipped, which i did not like very much. but if you get that replaced, then you basically have a \"LIKE-NEW\" phone.Don't be scared to purchase this, it is a 8/10 rating in my opinion with the chipped back doorbut the phone without rating the backdoor would be 10/10, just get the backdoor replaced.", "Date": "October 22, 2012"}, {"Title": "Great phone.", "Author": "Student", "ReviewID": "RHB8E6Y25WNOE", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Great phone.

After seeing the usefulness of my wife's iPhone, I decided it was time to upgrade. Since we have the Walmart family plan (which is, incidentaly, carried over T-Mobile's network) I had to do some research. Price was a consideration, as well, since I would have to pay for the phone outright. Going in I expected it to be a choice between the iPhone and an Android phone. After reading about, and talking to people who have them, I ruled out an Android phone because of bugginess, instability, what have you. While looking, I started to explore the possibility of a Windows phone as a possible alternative to the iPhone. Shockingly, the new Windows Phone OS is very good and more \"modern\" than the other two. By modern, I mean that the behemoth that is Windows is taking some risks to move forward in design and functionality. iOS is iOS is iOS. Basil Hayden on the rocks. Smooth, comfortable, reliable. Android is the feral child. Linux, minus the security and stability that makes Linux so great. Thanks, Google. Finally there's Windows. The giant Evil Empire. This time, though, Windows seems to have really built a good product. It's fast, it's stable, it's intuitive. It takes a little getting used to, like a move from Windows on a PC to a Mac or Linux interface, but once you do, it's second nature. The biggest knock so far is the lack of apps. If you really need to find every last time and soul sucking game out there, Windows Phone doesn't have all of them. If you're looking for a phone that can actually help you be more productive then I see the Windows Phone as a viable option. With a number of games and apps, mind you, just not the hundreds of thousands in the Android and iPhone universe (yet). As for the phone itself, my price range was limited, as I stated. I needed an unlocked, preferably T-Mobile phone. This came down to a Nokia (700 series, I believe), and the Radar. After physically handling both I felt the HTC was the more durable feeling. After a few weeks I'm very happy with my purchase. My only small niggle is the limited storage at 8 GB. At my price point, though, I can live with it.", "Date": "May 24, 2012"}, {"Title": "htc has done it again!!!", "Author": "sgreene", "ReviewID": "RC1SZZEYC0OAV", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I've had my phone for a week now, and i have loved it. you can review it on youtube mobile tech review,phone arena, c net. seeing all does i have tto say that it is worth the money check it out. i am going to school online i can check into my classes, check grades and check email, check Facebook,while i am at the store, or out to dinner.it has Microsoft 7 on it sky drive which is a extra 25 gb drive that you can use to send or hold documents.i wanted a tablet, i will have to wait but, this will be my tablet until then. i would give it a ten but it only allow five stars so that it.get the screen saver,smudges are a problem be it's touchscreen but, that not to bad.", "Date": "February 11, 2012"}, {"Title": "Not impressed", "Author": "meggil", "ReviewID": "R39REEETM9SMQU", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "I regret not getting another android.

Search comes up as Radar 4G but no where on phone does it say that. It may look like 4G, so not sure.

Three stars *** because no US wall charger, only a 2 prong Europe model. Plan on buying one so this phone is not such a bargain. Tmobile SIMM card worked fine.  Lots of setting changes for USA metrics. I may be sending back and spend extra $80 to get a USA version. More posts later as I resolve issues. Might have been four star**** if I did not have to fool with model. Bad out of box experiance!More important notes, no USA TMobile 4G support only edge. Took into local Tmobile store, they gave me a new SIMM card. This unlocked phone is like the iPhone features not supported.
