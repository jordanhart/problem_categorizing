{"Reviews": [{"Title": "awesome phone", "Author": "PG", "ReviewID": "ROGH9WOEILZ46", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "One of the best phones I've used.  I've tried other smartphones and this one is very good.First I'll talk about the phone hardware then the OS.Hardware:Very solid phone, beautiful and large screen and the feel of the device is very nice in the hands.  The rubberized material on the back lets you hold the device without dropping it.  Feels pretty light and really this is the size smartphones should be; the screen is absolutely perfect.The power button I feel is a little small - it needs to be a little taller so its easier to push to power on, maybe its just the case I have it in now that makes it a little hard to push in.Volume switches - I find I accidently push these quite often and it changes the volume.  While it's great they are available we should have an option to lock the volume rocker/buttons so they dont constantly keep changing the volume.Camera button - very nice and allows you to quickly take photos with a single click!!  The camera does have an issue where it makes whites look pink - there is supposedly a fix coming from htc to address this; appaerantly this same bug was in the htc hd2 and htc fixed that; this is a problem with htc's driver not with windows phone 7.  The dual led flash on this device is fantastic and allows you to take nice bright photos at 5 megapixel - obviously not the best camera in the world at 5mp but for a cell phone its really good.  HTC throws in a nice flashlight app that they make which allows you to use the dual leds as a flashlight anytime you want - its really really bright - in a pitch black room it lights the entire room up - crazy cool!Soft buttons - the buttons on the bottom of the screen - back, windows and search work great and are very responsive - touch them and easily take you back to the main screen, go back in an application or launch the search applications.  Many times if you accidentally press these buttons while in a game you can easily drag your finger away and it wont kill the game and take you out of it - very nice feature so you dont accidentally keep quitting an app/game.The speakers on this device are pretty good; I havent had any problem at all with these speakers and they are quite loud when listening to music, playing games or on the speakerphone with someone else.  The clarity is pretty good too.The sound quality on the device is excellent when taking calls; recipients have no problem hearing you either.Call quality/signal - no problems at all with this phone; havent had a single dropped call when using this phone, you can easily switch to speaker phone at anytime by tapping on the screen and choosing the speakerphone option - switching is instant and smooth.Battery life - I easily get one and 1/2 days usage out of this even with wifi and 3g on.  Very good phone even if you are very busy and need to do some browsing, emailing and taking calls.  Recharging the phone is pretty quick too whether you plugin to the wall or your computer.  The plug is a standard micro? usb plug.  It comes with an adapter that allows you to plug the standard usb end into a wall socket to get AC power too - very nice design.Software:The new Windows Phone 7 OS is very fluid, slick and responsive - no slow downs at all and smooth all the way through.  Very easy to understand and use.  You simply swipe down and up to choose any application you want.  Need something on the 'homescreen' simply tap and hold it - whether its a contact from your address book, an app, or a game you can easily organize and choose whatever you want to be on the front.Swipe to the right and you have the entire list of all applications installed.  All games are organized in the xbox live section so there is no clutter.  The operating system was very well thought out and organized and is not a mess of static icons found on other smartphones.Live tiles are excellent - when the weather upates - it shows you the temperature and the conditiosn outside (snowing, rain, sunny, cloudy, fog, etc).  It shows you the day and month, time obviously, how many emails you have, how many voice messages you have, how many missed phone calls.  You don't need to keep pressing deep down to find this information - its all right there on the main screen.  If you want to pull the phone out of your pocket and glance down you can do that too right on the lock screen - it shows all of that information there too.  Beautiful and efficient; no fiddling all day with your phone unless you really want to.Over 4000 applications are now available in the marketplace, many of the games available are xbox live compatible - full gamerscore, achievements, buddy lists, invites, sending/receiving messages all built right in.  These games are not cheap ports from other smartphone os's - these are all highly polished and unique games built from the ground up for Windows Phone 7.  You have alot of great games like assassins creed, need for speed, deblob, frogger, guitar hero, hexic, max and the magic marker, project sunburst (crackdown), puzzle quest 2, the harvest, sims 3, uno.  A ton of great indie games too like - birdy bounce (like doodle jump), impossible shoota, unite.  There are many more games and applications.  You have great applications like Netflix - you can watch full movies from your instant queue, add items to your queue.  AP Mobile - read about news events from around the world, ebay - see your auctions, bid on items, manage you account, flixster - see what movies are happening in your area, showtimes, locations, top movies, news.  Built in youtube app that lets you watch youtube movies.The built in applications like Office let you view/edit ord documents, view/edit excel documents, view powerpoint presentations, view/edit onenote, outlook - view your email from multiple providers - hotmail, google, yahoo, any email provider - very intuitive and easy to use interface.  Internet Explorer - optimized and is a really good browser now; pinch to zoom and scrolling in internet explorer works perfectly, loading pages is excellent and fast - no real faults at all with the new internet explorer.  Music/Videos player is basically the zune interface - beautiful; manages all your videos and music here and if you have a zune pass you can listen to your music from right here - this works in the background too and you can play games and surf the web using this application in the background.With so much good, what can be bad?- No multitasking for third party apps - we need the ability to multi-task and choose what we want running in the background.  Some apps really do need multitasking.- Copy/paste - this is a minor issue but it can come in handy when copying things from a webpage/word and emailing it to others - this is being added in a January OS update from Microsoft.- HTML 5 support - currently internet explorer does not support html5; this really needs to be worked on immediately - supposedly an update in august will add html5 - too slow it needs to be added in asap.- Documents - need the ability to drop documents directly from zune software and sync with office mobile.- Camera - htc needs to fix the color problems with this camera; they fixed it in the htc hd2 so it shouldnt be a problem fixing it in the htc hd7.Hands down this is one of the best initial Windows Phone 7 devices out there; this is nothing new from htc - they make really exceptional hardware for Microsoft's operating systems.  I hope to purchase the next HTC phone they make with Windows Phone 7 down the road ;)", "Date": "December 16, 2010"}, {"Title": "faster than the iphone4, very snappy.", "Author": "Vidal", "ReviewID": "R3NJXEUGPN0SGG", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I am writing this review after 2 weeks of use with the HD7.The phone comes with about 14gigs of usable storage space, which is more then adequate for my music and video collection.Now about the zune player software that comes with the phone, , to browse through songs in shuffle mode, is even faster then the iphone4 ( it also has much more visuals than the iphone4, it displays the album art and also the artist at the same time ).The only problem the zune has is that it cannot do a music search in your library by pressing the search button. it just takes you to the marketplace ( probably in future updates might fix that )Also for wireless syncing, I had to turn off the wifi on my phone and re-enable it for the zune pc to recognize the phone. They should to resolve that as well.So the zune music player software is top notch, but it needs minor upgrades here.The 4.3 inch screen is SUPER sensitive, even with a screen protector on. The screen although has less pixels than the iphone4 ( hardly noticeable ), is more sensitive.Navigating though the phone's menus are very fluid and fast,,,, like if you want to change the theme of the phone, after you are finished, hit the windows button.( it will take you back to the homescreen ). If you want to change the theme again, just hit the 'back' button on the phone, and it will take you back to the theme options. Very fast and handy.Other nice free features are the skydrive and facebook integration ( twitter is absent oddly ). With skydrive, all your contacts that are aded to the phone is automatically and instantly uploaded to you windows live account ( so if your phone gets stolen, lost or broken you still have your important information). It also has features to find your phone, remote lock and erase. Apple recently added the last features to iOS devices for free, but the upload information is still a paid service.For the very few bugs that the phone has, microsoft i presume is working on an update that will be rolled out in Q1 of 2011.", "Date": "November 28, 2010"}, {"Title": "IPhone alternative with a very streamlined UI", "Author": "Asif A. Siddiqi", "ReviewID": "RGQPPDDGNW27T", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I love this phone so far. It looks slick - although I think the design is very simplistic. I like the large screen - but I would really like the size to be a little smaller. Though its pretty light.What I love about the phone is the UI. The UI is very well designed and task oriented. I have used multiple touch screen phones so far and most reviews actually ignore the basic part of the phone which is the \"Calling\" or Phone feature. Most phones I always have trouble with buttons when I am on the call - and have to respond to automated messages. Some phones are terrible - some are Ok but still requires a couple steps before you lauch the key pad every time you enter a response. This phone however, goes blank when talking but as soon as you take the phone off your ears, it brings up the keypad. Whick is simply brilliant. Took me exactly 5 steps to get all my firends/numbers and contacts from facebook, google windows live and outlook. The other cool feature is the linking of same contacts from different sources. You see them one, and can select the contact and perform different actions - call, send email to different addresses, text etc. The social network aspects are integrated very well - like photos are automatically displayed from all sources in one place - and you can see and add comments as well.The camera is decent with bright flash. The battery life is good - but I think could have been better. Browser is alright but no support for flash or silverlight.Overall I think its a great phone with not too much flashy features but one of the best from usability standpoint.", "Date": "November 19, 2010"}, {"Title": "Ignore Pre-mango reviews.", "Author": "malcolm", "ReviewID": "RMRU72XQNQVWR", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I would ignore any pre-mango reviews written about windows 7 as the OS has changed a lot.The \"most helpful critical review\" is full of inaccuracies.  Bluetooth works fine. Copy and paste works fine.  I can send files to my wife and back.  I can put a shopping list on the skydrive that she can edit real time and I get the updates.  You won't find a folder full of files.  You will need skydrive.  But, skydrive works great and it's free as part of microsoft suite.  Outlook, works fine.  Both corporate and personal.  Corporate, you'll need to have them grant you access.All this said, I do have a thing or two to say about the hardware piece of this phone.1. screen is lovely.2. sound is great3. speed is good.4. connections reliable.5. gps and mapping - really an excellent job especially with traffic. (partly software here)BUT, if you put a skin on this phone or you put it in a case and summer comes around, you risk crashing it (overheating), particularly if you play any processor-intensive games like bullet asylum.  I have also had problems using maps and it overheating while in the car on long trips.  Solution, if it's hot out, take it out of it's case.  If you're playing games, play somewhere air conditioned.I did have a problem with the phone's proximity sensor not working.  This is the controller that blackens the screen and locks the phone when you hold it to your head to talk.  Once locked, if the sensor isn't working, it stays locked until you yank the battery.  This is a problem if you're trying to hang up a call or trying to enter a passcode to join a corporate bridge.  Solution was to reset my phone to factory defaults.  Not a problem since everything backed up on skydrive.  Kind of nice because all my games started over from scratch.  I got my phone in Nov 2010.  Review written July 2012.  Have dropped it a few times so that probably didn't help.  Looking forward to my replacement window.Bottom line: will DEFINITELY get another windows phone.  Am waiting for Windows 8 which may not run fully on this currently hardware.  Windows 7.8 will but that is supposedly like \"windows 8 lite\".", "Date": "July 16, 2012"}, {"Title": "HTC HD7 - Exciting Phone, OS from Microsoft missing Tasks as part of Office Mobile", "Author": "Gregory", "ReviewID": "R1S39O0BAIJ0K8", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Before purchasing this phone, I held off pressure to purchase a black berry and held on to my broken HTC S70, until the new HTC HD7 with Windows Phone 7 was available. I've very excited and a litte frustrated, having recieved it.Pros:- The service from Amazon and ABE123 was fast!!- It's slick, has a nice substantive feel to it, very nice size screen and the OS (Windows Phone 7) is very response.- Finally one device integrating business tools and fun stuff, pictures, music, radio... etc...- Has a Phone Update feature, similar to Windows/Office, so we can expect fixes updates along the way...so that gives me hope!Cons:- The OS however I feel is INCOMPLETE as its touted to have Office Mobile, however has no Task module as did earlier phones with OS from Microsoft. Hopefully they'll resolve that.- The only other issue I found was that whenever it's left charging overnight, the green light stays on and the phone didn't turn on. I send feedback to HTC on this. This is not a show stopper for me, as I just now ensure its charged up whilst connected to my PC during the days or whilst driving around town.Overall GREAT device and FANTASTIC service from Amazon!!Looking forward to the updates from Microsoft and HTC.", "Date": "December 21, 2010"}, {"Title": "Crap", "Author": "Mia R Owens", "ReviewID": "RHKGJ5GXERICY", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "Had the phone 3 months and it kept shutting down. Went to a phone store only to see that the internal memory card had be replaced ( which it shouldn't have been) and it had water damage that was covered my an old motherboard. The repair was $120 extra and after paying $286 for it, I might as well gone to T-mobile and purchased a brand new phone with insurance and warranty. Will NEVER buy from this person again!", "Date": "November 20, 2012"}, {"Title": "Almost there", "Author": "Peter Petrov", "ReviewID": "R28N0GYUCJF17K", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I have owned this phone for slightly more than a week now, and I am still loving it, despite some shortcomings.I switched to this one from the dismal Blackberry Torch which is the worst Blackberry I have ever had (so little thought had gone into making that joke of a touchscreen phone). To be honest, i did not mean to buy the HTC, but just tested it for a few minutes and I knew I had to have it.The new WP7 OS feels sleek and minimalistic, unlike the gaudy iOS of iPhone, but more similar to the look of the sylized Blackberry OS6, although having nothing in common in terms of ease of use. It is also less popular than iOS, which i think resounds with my approach to phones. The phone and OS are quick, very responsive and plain beautiful.Even though it has a large screen the HD7 sits very comfortably in my pocket, not showing any bulk at all. It has a great camera that does wonders in bright daylight and the phone does indeed shoot high quality video.Bing maps is also another application I like better than its brother google maps. It looks better, it finds things easier, and once you have found what you need, you can pin it as a tile on the front screen for easy use later on.I also love the look and feel of Outlook which synchs with my office mail, calendar and contacts (like the Blackberry, but looks fantastic and is much easier on the eye and on the hand).Web browser works and feels very good, very quick and responsive. Of course it lacks flash, but I hear it is being developed for WP7.The WP7 is a clear case of form over function, but I forgive it because of the uber-sleek touch and feel the whole thing has.Now the gripes:1. The camera is ridiculous in low light conditions (with or without flash). Pictures are either blurred or overexposed.2. Battery life is a joke - I could easily extract 4-5 days of use from a single battery charge with my Blackberry, now i hardly get two full days. This is a serious inconvenience, especially if you are travelling, because you can be left without a phone at any time. What is even more unpleasant is the fact that there is no OEM higher capacity battery by HTC, other than the original one (1230 mAh). I hope they fix this soon.3. The alarm works only when the phone is switched on. So you cannot switch the phone off at night and have to worry whether the battery will run dry and the phone will not wake you up in time for work.4. WP7 Marketplace is yet to grow, and most notably it lacks ANY navigation software, which in my view is a serious shortcoming for this OS. I would love to see navigation software having the look and feel of Bing maps.5. No decent youtube application.6. No option to use an .mp3 as a ring tone (unclear why WP7 does not support this).7. Only 8 Gb of storage and you cannot do anything about it.All in all I think this is a very good buisness smartphone, and certainly could be a Blackberry-killer.The OS (WP7) has  still not been perfected (phone may become hung by various activities and applications), but I think it has a lot of potential.Despite the shortcomings, I would recommend this product to other people, who knowingly could live with them, for the sake of using a sleek, convenient and beautiful phone.", "Date": "March 7, 2011"}, {"Title": "The Best Gadget I Have Ever Owned", "Author": "D. Fisher \"DarrowWolfe\"", "ReviewID": "R10MRAPIJRLYKJ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "So let's start with the complaints:--> Its a big phone, the screen has over 4\" of viewing area.--> The screen, although bright and beautiful, is not quite up to par with the other Phone 7s out there.--> HTC managed to put buttons just about everywhere where you hold it. So if you're call goes quiet all of the sudden it is probably your thumb pushing in on the side.--> Office Mobile better get beefed up soon or Microsoft is going to lose what little potential edge they have in this phone.And that's where my complaints end. Microsoft did a very wise thing to scrap their traditional tiny Windows concept for Mobile devices and made the user interface fun and inviting. Although there aren't a ton of Apps available right now for Windows Phone 7s I am not necessarily the type to overload a phone or computer with a lot of extra software.The Windows Phone OS is easy and very responsive to flicks, pinches, and presses on the HD7. The coolest thing about the HD7 and Phone 7, however, was when I typed in my Windows Live ID and the phone filled up with some 200 hundred of my contacts within seconds. I connected to my work's Exchange server and all of my business contacts and email came up in seconds. The call quality is stellar (although I can only compare it to the previous three cell phones I've owned, all of which were terrible)and calls have not broken up on me at all yet.Best surprises:--> Kick stand!--> I never thought I would actually enjoy playing around on a cell phone. Even test driving the Droid X and iPhone I never really understood people's attachment to cell phones.--> This phone is one of the best sounding MP3 players I've heard yet! I was not expecting anything at all when it came to sound quality but HTC really put some effort in making this phone a real entertainment machine [using the headphones, that is. The built-in stereo speakers are only useful for conference style calls].The battery life takes me through a day as long as I make sure to turn the WiFi off when I leave my house. With the WiFi turned on the battery life is almost exactly half of normal. Please note, I have had this phone for one week so I have as of yet had something buggy happen with the phone.

This is bad, it's supposed that this device is global... the only keyboard language available is English and there's no way to install another language in the device. I wanted spanish keyboard language feature. Maybe in the upcoming updates of Windows Mobile 7 this feature will be enable.The good part:- HTC have many applications available for free very cool. \"Connection Setup\" application is real cool because detects the network provider (my case Telcel from Mexico) and it downloaded all configurations to the phone immediately to get connected to Internet and 3G/GSM network.", "Date": "December 28, 2010"}, {"Title": "My \"no good\" HTC HD7 Smartphone", "Author": "Christie Garland", "ReviewID": "R389SQ83Y97SKS", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I was very displeased with the item I received.

It is by far the best phone I have ever owned, but due to a lack of some key features, it's not perfect.What I Like About It:I was new to the Windows 7 Mobile platform when I first got the phone.  The first thing I noticed about the phone is how easy it is to use.  Navigation is very easy, as your main screen is \"tiles\", where you can put the apps and features you use most on.  To access the rest of your features/apps, simply swipe the screen to left and your list will show up with the full spectrum of your phone.  Very simple and easy.  Another nice feature of the main screen is how some of the tiles will rotate to show the pictures on your phone, so it almost feels like the phone is \"alive\", in a sense.The construction is very sturdy and the phone feels solid in your hand.  It's a bit heavy, which I prefer, and doesn't feel cheap.  Also, the screen is resistant to scratching.  I do not have a screen protector and to wipe my phone free of any blemishes I usually use my t-shirt (terrible I know).  I barely have two smalls scratches on the screen, the rest is flawless.  I don't know if the screen is made of gorilla glass or what, but it's definitely tough.The camera on this phone is awesome, and comes with its own dedicated button.  The resolution is very good and the quality of the pictures makes me proud to upload them onto Facebook.  The flash is super bright and definitely a plus addition.  Also, if you need to capture a picture or video quickly, the dedicated picture button is a fantastic feature.  If your screen is locked, simply hold onto the picture button for about two seconds, and automatically the picture screen will show up and you will be able to snap away.The touchscreen is very responsive and makes navigation easy.  This is the best touchscreen I have used, as it is better than either my iPod touch 4G or iPad 2.There is very little lag!  Almost no lag with this phone, and definitely no force closing issues.  The phone is quick, and is as fast now as it was right out of the box.  This is perhaps what I am most happy about, as most phones I have owned in the past slow down and lag over time and use.  Some apps do take some time to load, but the phone has never frozen on me and when doing basic functions such as calling, texting, emailing, and browsing the web, the phone is fast and responsive.There is plenty of storage space in the phone.  I have a ton of pics and videos on my HD7, and when I connect the phone to my computer, it still has plenty of storage left. The overall memory capacity is 16GB, which to me is a lot.Xbox Live.  The phone comes with a built in Xbox Live app.  Just link your gamertag and you're in.  Now granted, you cannot play any games (obviously) in your Xbox library, but it's still a cool feature to have.  You can access what games you've played, your gamerscore, what acheivments you have, and you can customize your avatar.  You can also check messages and find friends.  Very cool feature.What I Don't Like:Unfortunately, there are some flaws to this phone.  The worst one, in my opinion, is the low volume on the phone.  Notifications and ringtones are definitely loud enough, but the speaker and speakerphone volumes are terrible.  Talking and driving is a very trying experience.  On busy freeways and quiet roads alike it is hard for me to hear the person on the other end of the line clearly.  If there was one feature I could fix about this phone, the volume would be it.The lock/unlock/power button, located on the top right of the phone, is a small problem.  It is hard to fully press it all the way for it to work, and doesn't satisfyingly \"click\" when pressed.  I find myself trying the press the button two or three times before the phone wakes up.  Somewhat frustrating, but not too bad.Another big setback for the Windows 7 Mobile OS is the marketplace.  It is clearly EPICALLY far behind both the Android Market and the Apple App Store.  Most apps are not free, and there is a very limited selection.  However, some staples of industry are here, and are free.  They include, but are not limited to; Facebook, Twitter, Youtube, Netflix, Flixter, and ESPN Scorecenter.  HTC does have some very cool free apps also, including Photo Enhancer, Flashlight (which works excellently), and Sleep, which is basically one of those alarm clocks with the soothing sounds.Customization is also an issue.  There is hardly anything to customize on this phone.  You can put a custom picture on the lock screen, but it won't be in the background.  You can change the color of the tiles, but the color selection is very limited.  Also, the phone comes with plenty of included ringtones and alert sounds, but you can't have any custom ringtones, such as your favorite song.  You can, however, customize where your tiles are placed on the navigation screen.  People used to using an Android phone will find the lack of customization unsettling.The Zune software that syncs your phone to your computer can be a little confusing at first, and it doesn't save your contacts, so if you reset your phone, be prepared to have random numbers popping up.  However, after a little practice with it, the Zune software can be used effectively to streamline your pictures and music.The battery life on this phone is lacking.  Granted, I have not tried buying a new battery to see if I have a lame duck battery, but the battery I have drains very fast, especially when streaming videos.Lastly, the phone is not supported for 4G capability.Overall:This is a very good phone, and I would definitely recommend it to anyone looking for an easy to use smartphone with a good camera and no lag.  This isn't a kneejerk reaction, either.  I have had this phone for 9 months, and I don't believe in kneejerk reviews, as they can be misleading.

After the 7.5 update (mango) it is even better  - Perfect size - screen is not too big or small. The dimensions (W x L x H) and weight is great  - Runs fast even with a single core (don't listen to the Android crowd, more cores not needed for WP7)  - Sturdy conscruction  - Very good looking  - Durable - After a year and some months it looks great even though it has taken a couple dozen falls  - Still kicking after having water (and beer) spilled on it about 3 or 4 times.Cons:  - 3 hardware buttons (camera, power, and volume rocker) are mushy. They do not have a satisfying click and  they take getting used to.  - Claims to have the same Gorilla Glass as it's predecessor, the HD2, but the HD7 seems easier to scratch  - Bluetooth streaming audio sounds bad. This appears to be a Windows Phone OS problem, probably lower  quality audio by default to save battery. Can only be fixed by performing developer unlock and editing  registry settings  - Another WP7 OS issue: you can only attach pictures to emails and MMS, no documents.

I've always looked at a smartphone as a way to untether myself from the PC.  I've used Apple, Android, Symbian and recently Maemo (Nokia)and have always been an avid fan of any mobile device.My latest phone was a n900 by Nokia which I still love, but had to find something else that was less cumbersome.  It was my everything device that I could do anything I wanted except answer calls on a consistent basis.  Android was my next adventure which I ported on to my n900 and had a Droid for work as well.  I liked the combination of features and functions that it had compared to my n900 and the iPhone, but still felt I needed something else.Enter the HD7.  I've had a wonderful time with this phone.  I can tell you that the experience of Windows Phone 7 is amazingly simple.  I think Apple is the standard for user interface simplicity, but WP7 really feels even easier.  I went with the HD7 because of the size of the phone (and since I'm a Tmobile I was lucky that it was offered there).Hardware:  Though it has a large foot print, it's thin and weighs enough to make you feel like you have a solid device.  The hardware buttons are somewhat cumbersome at first - the power button and camera button are almost flush to the device - but once you get the hang of it, it's not too bad.  The screen is so sensitive.  I had a couple of typos because the screen picked up the smallest amount of touch (good thing the predictive text is good).  Speakers could have been much better, but I can still hear my music when I'm washing the dishes or giving the kids a bath. Kick stand is much better on the HD7 than my n900 and overall feel is solid.  The sheer size of the screen is great.  The perfect size I think.  Not too small and not too large.  As you probably have read on other reviews, the screen isn't the best in class, but it does the job well.  Colors are good, but not great.  If you do a side by side comparison of the screen to say a Samsung Focus, then you will definitely see a difference.  I don't think it's too bad since I don't use the phone next to others, but if you get bothered by this, then this may not be the best screen for you.  For me it works and does a great job.  Camera is decent but not that great.  I'm hoping a couple of updates will solve for some of the shortcomings, but for now I'll just make sure I don't take any indoor photos with this phone.My only complaints with are the back cover.  It's too flimsy and does not fit completely flush when on so you can see a sliver of your sim card.Software: Now you can go to Engadget or any of those sites for a deeper review, but I'll highlight my favorite parts of WP7.Lock screen - nice and functional.  It shows how many messages, voicemails, calendar events and missed calls all without even opening up to the home screen. Wish notifications were shown using the LED but I can understand battery consumption issues there.Home screen - simple and pleasing to the eye. What makes this operating system stand out is the implementation of the functions.  It moves away from a grid style to a functional tile system.  Think of it like a icon with widget like functionality.Zune player - I've always wanted a Zune player and now I have one.  The HD7 does a great job of providng clear sound.  The Zune player is great, and I actually prefer it over Apple.  It's very smooth and very well designed.Overall, a great first experience.  It was enough to get my mom to get the same phone.UPDATE: 4-6-2011I've had this phone for 3 months now and still love the device.It was fast before the new NoDo update and now even faster with it - overall UI speed and app start/resuming is quicker.  Copy and Paste feature is nice, but I never really needed it.  Market search has been improved and stability issues that occured with Market and Zune haven't surfaced since.  I still love the social network integration and don't miss the twitter client at all.  Zune music player is fantastic and the tile system hasn't gotten old.  Found some cool tranparent lock screens and that just adds to the coolness yet simple things this OS has to offer.Do I want more apps?  Not really, but if you do it's good to know that the overall market keeps growing. As of this post there are over 12,860 apps ([...]) and number of developers continues to grow to which is promising.  I've used only a handful of apps and really love playing some of the games when I actually have time for them.I've changed the rating to 4 stars due to the camera on occasion getting all whacked out with pink hued pictures (not all the time but still come on HTC).  Also updating the phone could be easier with OTA, but I had issues trying to use my XP (sp3) to update.

I switched because I wanted a phone that was more \"fun\" and not Android-based because it needs to be linked to my office and my tech guy said they'd had some issues with Android.  So, since T-Mobile does not have the iPhone yet, that left me with very little options.  So I gave the HD7 a whirl.I do not regret it for one minute and will never go back to the Blackberry.  The big screen is fantastic.  I love the revolving tiles that you can customize by content and theme. They are constantly updating.

It has a definite \"wow\" factor from an eye-candy standpoint.There are definitely some limitations, though, especially coming from a Blackberry.Battery life sucks.There is not a red light indicator to alert you to new e-mails, messages, etc. so you either have to keep it sound-enabled or constantly check.No \"cut and paste\", although I hear they are updating OS to add that.Blackberry manages Outlook much better - for example, the \"Notes\" function does not sync.  Also, with my BB, I was able to delete a message on the BB and on my desktop at the same time.  HD7 does not do that.Not a great selection of Apps yet.Music integration sucks - you have to be hard-wired to your computer and have a Zune account.  I prefer iTunes, where you can wirelessly download songs instantly to your device.

It is simple and cool! And now that the XBOX 360 has the same interface, it now combines! And, I also wanted something different from iOS or Android that everyone speaks of.What I love the most of this phone is how smooth everything is. Thank to its 1 GHz processor, and its 400\u00d7800 pixels - 4.3 inches screen, all looks amazing. The images, videos and games run almost flawlessly (I noticed a small frame rate dropping in some recent games). It is also relatively fast for web-browsing with HTML support (full web-pages).Also, I got the 16GB version, so it has plenty of room to store your favorite music and pictures. To some, it may be short, but it all depends on how are you going to use the phone.The only cons I am having are: -The Wi-Fi is not configurable. So I cannot edit the IP, Subnet Mask, Gateway and DNS, so I am having some trouble to add it to my network. Other one is -The camera. The phone takes full 5MP photos and 720p video, but the lens is not good enough to capture without some blurriness and color-banding. And finally -The speaker. The sound is too low, even in full volume, to hear an incoming call if I am away from the phone or a place with noise (the noise doesn't need to be too loud for not hearing the phone).But even with the cons, all the rest of the phone is amazing and outcasts these little details.I rate it 4.5 out 5, but since I cannot rate like that in here, I give a full 5 stars!", "Date": "December 23, 2011"}, {"Title": "very happy", "Author": "vane", "ReviewID": "R2XEWZWZ5YQY0P", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "very happy with phone, just the bad point couldn't have Skype, not yet.I got the phone very fast.

The phone itself is beautiful and easy to hold, even in my small hands. I like the smooth metal which isn't quite as comfortable as the soft touch plastic found on LG's Quantum, but it also doesn't show scratches and smudges easily. Thin and with just enough curve to give it some grip this puppy is fine for all day holding, assuming the battery will last that long.On just about every smartphone and high-end multimedia phone I've owned, I would have allowed a slightly thicker body if they could just shoe horn in a stronger battery. Mine cant go a whole day of surfing or game playing or music listening, even if I have the screen on auto-brightness. Heck, I had this thing in Airplane mode all day while travelling and it didn't save much power that way either! And given the sleek, stylish shape its very annoying to have to switch over to a clunky extended battery. Not pocket friendly after that. Apparently this device is actually quite power efficient compared to other phones with similar processor and screen size, so HTC did get a lot out of that little battery.The body is solidly constructed with plenty of metal but in some pockets that may make it feel a bit heavy and it can flop around. Certainly not appropriate for a front shirt pocket. This is probably better suited to a belt clip or purse as heavy as it is. But day to day I think I prefer a solid metal build to a delicate cheap plastic body thats only a little lighter.Kickstand should have been centered. As is the thing tends to tip over quite easily. At any rate, on Tmobiles 3G service its not quite good enough to sit and watch Netflix or Youtube all day. Videos were always pixelated, even at home on Wifi. Suspect the processor isn't quite enough for a good movie viewing experience. Maybe after the Mango update. Did not try loading any of my own videos to watch because WP7 doesn't support too many formats and syncing with the Zune software is a hassle for me.Screen itself is good, not quite as bright or sharp as the Samsung Focus but its the largest one currently available on the limited selection of Windows devices. Very easy to find and press buttons and games look nice on the large screen. Also easy to see small text such as all the contact info on a detailed friend. Even better for web browsing with lots of text and pics. Not any higher resolution than comparable devices but with a large screen you have a little more flexibility zooming in and out to see things.Only real complaint is lack of physical keyboard. Yes it keeps the phone sleek but I find on just about every app when I need to type in text (especially the web browser) the on-screen keyboard takes up most of the display and I cant see what I'm doing above without constantly clicking back up there and checking on my progress. The good thing is the large screen allows for a comfortable keyboard, I rarely make typing mistakes like on smaller smartphones' on screen keyboards.None of the apps stood out as particularly good or bad so I'd say this phones horsepower is adequate for everything WP7 has right now, with the exception of Youtube and Netflix. To their credit their interfaces were easy to use, the video is just unpleasant to look at. But the OS interface always moves fluidly and games run great. Most of my complaints were really nitpicks and certainly don't detract from an overall great WP7 experience. It still earns a solid 4/5 because its so darn useful for pretty much everything. The fast hardware and large screen just add to the overall experience which I already like.The camera is acceptable considering its on a phone. The iPhone 4 takes better pics but I don't care about that. Phone cameras have never impressed me and probably never will, so my standards are low. For quick snaps at your next drunken party its OK, as would be dents in your car during daylight hours. All complaints are with the software and not the hardware. Most of those issues should be fixed with Mango anyway.Power/data plug is standard micro-USB and it charges quickly. I use a docking station which also charges a spare battery at the same time. On Windows 7 it quickly detected the device and downloaded the Zune software, synced up with no issues of any kind. Can also charge when plugged into the computer but not quite as fast as a dedicated charger or docking station.Phones are standard 3.5mm which is nice to see. Device has good quality audio out of the speakers and headphone plug but nothing stellar. Stereo movie experience wasn't all its cracked up to be, no bass and terrible mids are standard with tiny smartphone speakers. Plenty loud for a smartphone, only louder device I had was one of those Motorola tough phones and that was excessive.Anything else I could say at this point would be more about the OS than the device, since there's plenty of reviews on that all over the web I will let people read up on it and make their own decision about moving into Microsofts ecosystem. If you do decide to go this route, make a plan as to which carrier you like and if you want to wait until fall for the new OS and new line of phones. I only got this as a cheap temporary fix until Nokia has their phone out, early in 2012. As of right now AT&T; has the most WP7 devices and arguably some of the better ones, so you need to decide what works for you by combining your favorite OS, device, and carrier.

Worst of all, the phone does not support flash.  This is such a shame.  BBC, CNN and lot of other sites cannot play videos on this phone.  This sucks.

There are some pros and cons. It has largest or one of the largest displays available for the smartphones, one of my purchase criterion. My hope was that MS will make free Bing voice navigation available for the WP7 platform, as they did on WM6.5, in which case a large screen would be handy. The second thing I liked about the phone that compared to my previous BB8900 it held the cellular signal and the WiFi signal much better. I live in an area where the cellular reception is very poor. So, since BB8900 provided the UMA feature, I had high hopes on BB8900 but it failed to hold on to the WiFi signal even when in proximity of the WiFi router at home. So, in that regard HD7 was much better.Now, my major grduge is about the poor voice quality on speakerphone. The speakerphone is barely audible. The speaker volume on multimedia goes upto 30 while on calls it goes only upto 10. Either MS or HTC screwed up here. T-Mobile promised a software update from HTC but it has not come yet. Although, one tech support person from T-Mobile recognized it as a known issue, HTC support wouldn't aknowledge it as such.Another issue, this time purely Microsoft's, that I have not been able to make the SharePoint Workspace Mobile to work on my phone. My organization uses a HTTPS SP server. I had to configure UAG on my phone to connect to the SharePoint site, but that's how far I can go with it. When opening a document, it tells me that I don't have necessary permissions. After several attempts I can download a local copy of the document and edit it in Office Mobile, but then my changes can't be synced back to the SP site as I again get the error that I don't have necessary permissions. To be honest, this was one feature I was looking forward to as I have been taking great pains to advocate use of SharePoint in my organization. Accessibility on my phone would have made a stronger case for both the SharePoint and WP7, but alas Microsoft can't make even it's own products talk with each other smoothly!Phone was released in Oct '10 and we are still waiting for the first single feature update, \"copy and paste\". First it was rumored to be released around Jan 7 right before CES 2011, then the CEO Steve Ballmer announced that rumored copy and paste update will come very soon without giving any timeline, leading to rumors that it would be released before MWC 2011 around Feb 7, and then during MWC Ballmer announced features to be released in the second update in the later half of the year and that first update will come during first two weeks of March, again no firm timeline. I now doubt that we will see it in the first two weeks given the fiasco with their very first featureless update to improve the future update process.I was wrong in opting for an early upgrade chosing WP7. It has a long way to go to catch up with more established iOS and android platforms. I hope this review helps you in making the right decision in case you are in the market for a phone that just works!My first HTC and Windows mobile device and I am disappointed with both. The average life of such devices is 2 years and if they plan to do annual updates to thier buggy software and hardware, it's hard to imagine how they can capture the market that they hope to.

At little use it gets warm at the place u hold it warming up ur palm. Its because of the processor in use I guess, so PHONES desperately need a hybrid CPU/GPU, tilted more on the gpu side. I am really looking forward to Nvidia Tegra APX  or some good alternative based phones. Phones are not for compute intensive tasks, 95%(based on personal usage) tasks are simply about visual rendering and communication. We would see a great extension in battery life, and no heat problems. So I hope the phone and chip makers are LISTENING TO ME.* Battery life should have been better. The battery that comes with it is 1230mAh, instead a 1500mAh would have been lovely!Should have worked on* I would like a 62-63mm width instead of 68mm, I dont mind a 4\" screen and a little more thickness if for engineering constraints.Cool Things* Windows Mobile 7! Yes, it is really cool! Simple yet effective, of course this is the first version of a completely new form of OS, so glitches are expected, but overall its a breath of fresh air.I would like to give it 3.5, but couldn'tPlease write ur comments!", "Date": "November 20, 2010"}, {"Title": "This phone should be delivered with a tutor....", "Author": "JohnnyCaps \"Video Junkie\"", "ReviewID": "R7NC6ZVXOPTXI", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "The phone's hardware might be great but it's OS is NOT very intuitive.
