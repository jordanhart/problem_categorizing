Love this phone.  Feels great in the hand, easier to text on than X2, easy to use settings, metal instead of plastic.  Some complain it's not pocket sized.  I don't agree. Made well with usual Nokia thought into it.  Internet is fast, can extend 32GB with buying card, takes SIM easy, radio is great, everything to love on this phone.  Do your research on line. Sad it's not being made anymore. May be hard to find. Remember, if ordering from China or overseas, give it lots of time to reach you and don't expect to have a way to track package until much later. Also, mine came fully in the Chinese language.  Took forever to find where to change to English. Found the wrench on main menu...control panel is where the wrench is (push little house icon on the left for main menu. Went into the wrench again (which is settings), went into top first choice,General, then next top choice which is personalization. 5th one down is Language.  hit that and you will find English among many languages to choose from.  Very hard to do when all is in a foreign language. Also, locks after a few seconds of non-use.  Can unlock hitting left - then right -.  Worth the effort.", "Date": "January 30, 2014"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": null, "Features": null, "Name": null, "ImgURL": null, "ProductID": "B00HWI8D9I"}}
