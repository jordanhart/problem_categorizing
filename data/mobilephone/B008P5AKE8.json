I got it right away. I turned it on it acted in a strange way.Screens were popping on the their own, without any touch input, totally useless. I called Sony support they told me to upgrade the software that I did, which made no difference. I sent it back and I got my full refund. At the end I spend half a day trying to fix it, plus I lost $15 for S&H; and insurance for this defective product. By the way, if you search the web you see 1000's of complain about this phone all over the globe. What is Sony doing about it? Nada. They should recall it. They are not Apple.
