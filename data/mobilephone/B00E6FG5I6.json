I have been using this unlocked S4 for past 2 days helping a friend to migrate from iPhone 4S. My friend has been on iPhone and it also gave me a unique perspective. I used iPhone for couple of years and been using Android for past 3+ years.I have used Galaxy S3, Note II and for me S4 is more like a S3s :) If you have a Galaxy S3, it is perfect and there is no need to move to S4. The new features are more like minor upgrades for me. Just like Detroit rolls out new cars every year, phone manufacturers have found excellent way to make yearly upgrades.Battery came for almost a day. The video playback was crisp and my friend was amazed at the customization options. It is heaven for a iphone user to come out of shackles and explores the wonderful world of Android. It sure sounds like it is for geeks, but Samsung has created lot of ways to simplify and make it less intimidating. The EASY mode is for one such reason. Samsung's addition of all those apps (commonly referred as crapware) is not as bad as HTC or LG. Android experience is classified as pure vanilla in phones like Nexus. Vendors like Samsung have added a whole lot of extra programs.5\" HD Super AMOLED 1920 x 1080 display  (441 ppi) is just plain gorgeous. 13 MP camera takes ginormous image sizes. I put a 64 GB microSDXC card  SanDisk 64GB Mobile Ultra MicroSDXC Class 6 Memory Card with SD Adapter - Retail Packaging as my friend wants to take lot of movies (built-in 2 GB RAM, 16 GB ROM). No stuttering, and very smooth playback of videos captured in varying light conditions (HD Playback; HD Recording). Compatible video types are AVI/DIVX, WMV/ASF, FLV, MKV, MP4/3GP, WEBM. HDR and Panaromic photos were incredibly sharp. Compatible audio types are:  AAC, AMR, MP3, OGG, WMA/ASF, 3GA/M4A, FLAC, WAV. Google Music, PlayerPro Music player are producing excellent music.  Audio/Video is one section where S4 has nudged S3. For a normal user, if you are not into lot of video processing this does not matter.S4's infrared sensor is the same technology as TV remote control, so with WatchON you can change the TV channel from your phone. My friend was shocked to see this feature. Having used Android for a long time, I explored all new features one by one. My friend is still getting used to and feels this is too complicated. I broke down into lot of sub features and told my friend he may not use 50% of features, but told him to explore one feature at a time and focus on that.Games were very buttery, this phones runs ARM\u00ae-based octa-core mobile CPU. This is apparently world's first!  Inside this chip is Imagination Technologies' PowerVR SGX544MP3 GPU. I tried several car racing games and performance was phenomenal. People on the XDA-Developers forum report seeing smearing and ghosting when scrolling on the phone. This especially occurs to people when scrolling among darker colors, which begin showing up as purple. I tried hard to see if I could on the S4 I was testing with my friend and I could not see it. I am sure these can be upgraded with software over due course.Air View and Air Gestures - are they worth it? Air view is similar to how the S-pen on the Galaxy Note 8 works. Simply hover finger a few millimeters above the screen and in supported apps, you'll see a preview of content. This works with many of Samsung's built-in apps, including the photo gallery, the dialer, Samsung's browser and email client. It also works with Flipboard. Air View works by cranking up the capacitive sensor on the screen. Another new feature is Air Gestures. This uses the IR sensor on the top of the phone to detect movement by your palm or finger. One can flip between open tabs in Samsung's browser app, skip to a new song in the music player and do many other things. I say these are still in works and sometimes not very efficient.GPS was spot on and I tried multiple GPS apps. It was bright outdoors (had to crank the brightness all the way up). I tried multiple apps to demonstrate to my friend. In the end, my friend was impressed with what all Android and in particular S4 had to offer. Smooth and Stunning display!I tried following apps and they just worked awesome.Amazon MobileAndroid StatusAndroidifyAngry Birds (Space/Seasons)Asphalt 7Amazon App StoreBoxCar Maintenance Reminder ProChromeCNET TVNAVIGON (from Garmin - offline maps)Google Navigation/Earth/MapsGoogle Currents (nice way to read News)Draw SomethingGoogle DriveEbayLinkedinGoogle MusicTapatalk (awesome forum browsing app)OverDrive Media Console: Library eBooks & Audiobooks (public library consumption of media)Microsoft One Note (legacy docs, skydrive of 25 GB is good)Subsonic Music StreamerTerminal Emulator (still need to use vi, yes this is it)TweetCaster Pro for Android (excellent twitter client)Twit.TvGoogle VoicePlenty of WidgetsAsk questions, the review cannot do justice to Galaxy S4. I will be glad to answer any questions.", "Date": "May 6, 2013"}, {"Title": "Currently the Android phone to beat", "Author": "Genryu", "ReviewID": "R33G0RKIRGD8OE", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "While I initially purchased the HTC One, my dad decided to try out the Samsung Galaxy S4 and I'd say he made the better choice between the two of us. I ended up returning my HTC One not only because of the problems I had with it, but also in part because the SGS4 just offered a more complete package that I knew could last me at least a year or longer. I've detailed below some pros and cons after using the device for a few weeks.Pros- Bright screen with great viewing angles: While I can't sign off on the color reproduction, the brightness is definitely great along with the viewing angles. I don't really share videos with others often, but for those that do it's a great aspect of the screen to have. For the color-sticklers like me you're still getting a oled screen so colors are going to look over-saturated and have a certain pop to them that isn't true to life. But I'll admit it does have a certain visual appeal to it, and my friends that aren't that particular really enjoy it.- MicroSD cart slot and removable battery: The inclusion of the microSD card slot for me is a nice plus, since I can just load on a bunch of movies and tv shows to watch on the go (can't do that over the cellular network because of data caps). The removable battery means that you can swap it out if you want in the middle of the day, but I've never been one to buy multiple batteries personally. The nice part for me is that you can buy higher capacity after-market batteries, have the option of just buying a new battery when it starts to degrade over time, and do easy force resets by just taking out the battery. And for you secret agents out there, pulling out the battery is the only way to make sure the phone isn't being used to track you, turning it off isn't enough.- Great camera quality: Let me start off by saying that I think for overall mixed shooting environments from bright light to moderate light the SGS4 is the Android phone to beat currently. When you're talking about strictly low-light performance it is going to be 2nd place to the HTC One in the Android realm. I tend to shoot more during the day or in the evenings during sunset time. I'd imagine that most people tend to take pictures in a variety of lighting environments and for that the SGS4 is the better overall camera in my opinion. The higher resolution is nice to work with too if you like to crop images on your computer after taking them.- Solid software/device support: The SGS4 at present is the only one that's made the extra mile to build in extensive bluetooth support. In fact its the only bluetooth device I can use my fitbit flex with, because other Android phones haven't gone the extra mile in this area. If wireless accessories and the like are your kind of thing, I'd say Samsung is the way to go if you want to ensure support. Not even Google's Nexus line can boast this fact.Cons- Plastic design: There's no other way to put it, this phone just doesn't feel like a high-end device in my hand. Especially since I got to hold the HTC One in one hand and this one in the other it becomes all the more apparent that Samsung used cheaper materials to build this phone. On the plus side the plastic feels durable and likely to hold up well to drops and moderate abuse. Can't say that about the HTC One. Also the plastic design means that the battery isn't sealed in like the HTC One.- Still about average battery life: The battery life is just about getting me through my day, but I'm still packing an external charger and the charging cable with me. I just end up having to use them less often than I did with my HTC One when I had that. So yes while it's a bit better than the HTC One in my opinion, it's not exactly going to set any records. It's about what you're probably used to seeing with a smartphone these days and nothing more. I wish they'd integrate some giant batteries like Motorola does with their MAXX line of devices, but until then this is the best you can get. You can buy increased capacity batteries after-market to help alleviate the battery issue, though I can't comment on their quality or performance. My usage consists of streaming pandora to and from work, regularly accessing gmail throughout the day, watching a tv-show during lunch sometimes, about 1-2 hrs of phone calls, and regularly texting.- Useless Samsung software: Nearly all of the implementations that Samsung built in like S-voice and others feel either gimmicky and useless or intrusive with the native Android interface. There is just a overall cartoonish look to the UI and feels like an overall departure from the clean UI design of stock android and even the relatively-close-to-stock look of the HTC One. I'm not a fan, and I feel it makes the software look more childish with the brighter colors and more playful font choices. It simply doesn't look very professional. I do like the quick-access menu to settings from the control-bar pull-down but that's about it.- Software support: Samsung has a history of pretty much making their present flagship devices very old news when they launch their next device. They've been making some effort to provide faster Android updates, but as time goes on I can't vouch for what kind of software support they'll provide you. I'm a believer that if you buy a phone, it should be supported as is without you having to root or do any other work on your own. It's unreasonable to expect the average consumer to root their phones, and they shouldn't have to. Now that Android version 4.3 got announced we can see how long they'll take for an update.Overall, I'd say the SGS4 definitely fulfills the solid camera performance criterion, does well-enough on the display quality, and offers about average battery life with options to improve it without having to buy a bulky add-on case. While I have some reservations with the build-quality, it does feel like it'll handle some drops. Since this is my dad's phone I'm giving it back to him after using it for a few weeks. The question of whether I'll buy one for myself....probably not right now. But mostly because I've resolved to wait for the next Nexus phone whenever that's released. I have a Galaxy Nexus right now which works fine, so I'm in no rush to upgrade. But if I had to buy an Android phone today it would be the SGS4 - simple as that.", "Date": "July 25, 2013"}, {"Title": "Blows the competition out of the water!", "Author": "MOAR COARS", "ReviewID": "R19VTNS3K4TLSA", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "UPDATE#1: The battery life seems great, better than on the S3 even though the screen is larger and has a higher resolution than the S3. When I had my S3, I used to lose about ~3-5% of battery every two hours or so but with the S4, I seem to lose about ~1-2% so that's awesome.  The phone comes with a ton of bloatware from AT&T;(I don't know about other carriers but I assume it's the same) and the only way to get a good battery is by removing all the bloatware.  I was getting terrible battery life when I first got my phone but after reading online it seems that everyone suggests removing the bloatware for batter battery life.  Like I said in my review, the snapdragon 600 uses very little battery when it is not being used so that's a big plus. I'm a heavy user and when I say heavy user, I mean heavy user. I do pretty much everything on my phone from taking a crapload of pictures/videos, watching YouTube videos, playing 3D games, phone calls and surfing the internet. At the end of the day the phone has about 30-35% of juice left.  Also, one thing that I forgot to mention was the speakers on the phone. Samsung decided to move the speakers which used to be at the top near the camera on the S3 to the bottom of the phone which wasn't a good idea if you ask me. You can block the sound coming from the phone when holding the phone with your hand.----------------------It's been a week since I got my Galaxy S4 and this thing is super awesome.  My previous phone was the S3 which I loved to death and this time I'm super excited to have the S4 in my hands.  I had absolutely zero issues with the S3 but the S4 looks so sexy with the metal edges.  I seriously don't understand why people buy an iPhone because let me tell you that the Galaxy S4 blows the iPhone 5 out of the water and every other phone out there. The Galaxy S4 wins hands down in every category compared to the iPhone 5.  I was blown away by the performance of this phone. The Snapdragon 600 is blazing fast and uses far less battery than the S3.  I can get through the day with a single charge and still have 30% left at the end of the day.  I'm a heavy user so this says a lot about the phone.  Even my family who loves the iPhone is blown away by this phone.  My family just loves the big screen and the customization that it has compared to the iPhone 5. There are many reasons why I decided to go with this phone over the other smartphones on the market but the main reason is the screen size, camera, storage, processor and the battery life.These are some of the things that the Galaxy S4 has over the iPhone 5 and other high end phones:Pros:-Screen: The Galaxy S4 has a nice 5 inches Super AMOLED HD screen that makes everything stand out when viewing it. The resolution on this phone is a nice 1080 x 1920 (441ppi pixel density) which makes everything look sharp.  The Gorilla Glass 3 is also much better at preventing the screen from cracking and scratching.  I tried to scratch the screen with my car keys and nothing happened to the screen, impressive. It has a significantly higher resolution than the iPhone 5 (640 x 1136).  Also, the iPhone 5 is only 4 inches which is way too small for most people.-Android OS: This phone ships with the most up to date version of Android, Android 4.2.2 (Jelly Bean) which is the fastest Android version yet.  Samsung has added many new features to TouchWiz which is great. I'm not really a fan of TouchWiz but it seems that they have made many improvements to the UI.-Design: The design is sort of the same as the S3 which I have no problems with. The S3's design is sexy and very comfortable to hold in your hand and the same goes for the S4. If you loved the S3's design then you will love the S4's design even more, trust me.  The phone feels a little bit lighter and thinner which is great. It has a nice feel to it that makes you want to hold the phone.-Camera: The primary camera on this phone is 13MP (4128 x 3096 pixels) and the front camera is 2MP that takes some of the best pictures I have ever seen. The front facing camera is great when you are Skyping or even taking pictures of yourself.-Battery: Samsung has decided to improve the battery capacity in S4 to 2600mAh that can easily last a full day with a single charge. I can get through a day with a single charge and still have 30% left at the end of the day. The battery life is one of the most important aspects when deciding which phone to buy for me because I travel a lot and I need a phone that can last a full day. My previous phone which was the S3 needed at least 2-3 charges to last through a day. The Snapdragon 600 does an outstanding job at using as little battery as possible.-Storage: With the option of an external sdcard, this phone simply destroys the iPhone 5. I can store as many pictures and HD videos as I want and it will never come close to being full. I am the type of person who stores large collections of pictures, videos, and movies and this phone lets me do all of that easily.  I also play 3D games that require a minimum of 1-2GB of space and this phone is perfect for that.-Processor: The Qualcomm Snapdragon 600 (Quad-core 1.9 GHz Krait 300) does an amazing job at keeping this phone lag free and blazing fast. I have never experienced a slow down with this phone. I have even tested this phone by playing intensive games such GTA Vice City on the highest settings and there were no slowdowns whatsoever. I am very impressed with the processor in this phone.-Removable Battery: Who doesn't love this, seriously? This and the option of an external sdcard make this the best phone of the year.  I always carry extra batteries whenever I travel somewhere and I can easily swap my battery with another one when the phone is low on battery. This is a big plus for this phone. Sucks to be an iPhone user!Cons:-None. As much as I want to think of something bad to say, there's simply nothing negative about this phone.Overall, I can safely say that Samsung has another winner in their hands.  It's a great phone and it doesn't disappoint. With the amazing 1080p resolution, screen size, battery capacity and storage, this phone puts other phones to shame.

I bought this phone with the expectation that it would be a significant upgrade to my Samsung Infuse 4G, a cell phone which AT&T; ceased to support all of six months after I purchased it.  Only through rooting the 4G was I able to keep the Android operating system up to date, thanks to the hard work of many folks at XDA developers, including Cyanogen Mod and particularly Scott Hart's Beanstalk ROM.  Thanks to the ability to modify my phone, and the work of some brilliant developers I was able to maintain a decent level of satisfaction with the product and with AT&T;'s service for the duration of my service contract.This phone is definitely an upgrade, and is quite top of the line.  Unfortunately, AT&T; has chosen to update the firmware for the Galaxy S4 such that effectively installing a recovery method, essential to installing ROMS safely and natively, is exceedingly difficult.  This phone has a lot of potential, and based on AT&T;'s update and service record on my previous phone--virtually nonexistant--I trust the ingenuity of folks at XDA, who do Android with passion an enthusiasm, much more than I do the folks at AT&T;, who seem primarily concerned with planned replacement and selling phones.  The phone also came with more AT&T; bloatware than ever before.  On the one hand, AT&T;'s network is excellent, but on the other hand, AT&T;'s business model limits the carrier to 2 stars.The phone itself is worthy of five stars.-Sound is excellent-the speaker produces incredibly high quality sound at a great volume, and the headphone output is easily comparable to my iPod.-Many thoughtful features go into this phone, including a home button, which is handy.-Some of the features such as intelligent scroll, intelligent pause and such seem like they have a few kinks to be worked out, and it is not available for all apps.  The stock browser supports it, but Chrome does not, for example.-The display is beautiful and sharp, easily rivaling the iPhone retina display.  The larger screen makes for a considerably larger phone, but its thinness actually compensates well for that.-The microSD card is in its own slot, not clustered with the SIM card and battery as in the Infuse, making the microSD hot swappable, which is a very nice touch.", "Date": "October 31, 2013"}, {"Title": "Love the phone - Upgrade from SII", "Author": "Dan Berman", "ReviewID": "R1UGPIQY8YVDQB", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I didn't want to let go of my Galaxy S2 with extended battery and when it started giving me all sorts of hardware issues (after 10ths of drops) I was seriously considering repairing it or buying a used one.  Alas, all the mentioned options would have proven to be quiet expensive.  But when my S2 started having issues charging I had to upgrade.I was extremely skeptical of the S3 large screen size and S4 was for me completely out of the question.  I was considering buying HTC One but after reading the SAR comparisons I had no choice but to go the Samsung route again.  Many people are unhappy about Samsung plastic design but the truth is that plastic design gives a lot of advantages: lower SAR emissions, lighter, more impact resistant, removable battery and SD slot.  The truth is once you put a case on the phone and I would implore you to do so the body material no longer matters much.However, when I got to the store and discovered that Galaxy S4 overall size was the same as S3 and only the screen size inside had changed there was no point going with the outdated and inferior S3 phone.Pros:+Mechanical home button (like iPhone) - this provides an easy way to wake the phone instead of using the power button like on S2+LED showing different events and status of the phone (like charging status, various events status of missed calls, new messages and so on)+Large screen (despite being extremely skeptical about it, I love the larger screen and it still fits into my regular sized pockets).+Split screen mode (with this large screen you can run multiple apps side-by-side !!)+Great keyboard with numerical row always displayed (thanks to the large screen)+The phone is very fast+GPS lock is very good+Even without GPS enabled the phone is capable of determining its position fairly accurately and very quickly+Battery life is reasonable (Galaxy S2 standard battery life was abysmal)+Voice recognition - astounded at the level of the voice recognition - it is definitely no longer a gimmick+Loud speaker with little distortion+Two built-in microphones (I can talk to people with my phone on the desk in the speakerphone mode with no problems)+Vibration feature when you pick up the phone and you had a missed callCons:+No dedicated search button like on S2 (it is not a dealbreaker but the button saved many useless clicks and motions in OS and apps)+Navigating the UI is harder with the larger screen by using only one hand+A lot of the touted extra features such as Smart motion, smart stay, smart pause and so forth are mostly gimmicks due to poor implementation or redundancy", "Date": "July 5, 2013"}, {"Title": "Absolutely amazing...once you get past AT&T; and samsung", "Author": "Woodrow E Douglass", "ReviewID": "R41WJ53LZZ5M6", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This phone is amazing. 48 hour battery life, beautiful screen, fast processor.

I am an avid smartphone user and get almost everything that comes out. Had the GS3 left that for the Note 2 (currently also own an iPhone 5).At first I thought I was going to miss the 5.5\" screen of the Note 2, but after using my S4 I am adjusting very quickly, due to most of the features included and the screen quality.Air View is great, being able to \"peek\" at info without touching your device.Air Gesture is another useful feature as if your reading an article and eating, you can move the page with a flick of the hand (or finger). Even better when driving, because you can wave the screen to answer the call.The camera, while megapixels aren't always everything, this phone definitely beats the Note II and GS3. I have been looking for a great android phone camera to rival my iPhone 5 and I think I have found it. The new features, Drama mode to stitch pixs together, as well as dual camera to put urself in a picture are EXCELLENT. The ability to do sound and shot also is another plus.The overall look (even thou not premium compared to the HTC ONE) is definitely a step in the right direction as its not a plain black or white. The subtle aluminum bezel makes a nice addition.The new features as part of Android 4.2, such as customizing ur notification shade quick settings and putting personalized text on ur lockscreen, in addition to the much welcomed, music player widget on the lockscreen. FANTASTIC!!Battery Life, so far I am averaging about 14-16 hours on med-heavy use which is acceptable for the screen size/quality.Overall very satisfied with my purchase at full price, really contemplated over the last week with getting the HTC ONE, but it's the little things that matter sometimes; a feature having it, just in case one day you decide to use it.

Benjamin", "ReviewID": "RIJ2R2SO986ZK", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I upgraded to the S4 awhile back and so far, I have no significant complaints.SPEED: Navigating menus, apps, browsers, etc. on the S4 is incredibly smooth and fast. There is no noticeable lag or hesitation when jumping from screen to screen, opening apps, returning to the home menu or turning the display on or off. I already have mine loaded with apps and it has had no noticeable negative impact. Scrolling through the browser, apps menu, etc. has a very smooth look as well. The interface is easy to navigate. I probably prefer the standard Google/Android interface, but Samsung has come a long way with their TouchWiz interface and I really like the UI they've packaged on this phone.PHYSICAL: Thin and sleek. The phone itself has a solid feel to it, much less \"cheap\" feeling than previous Galaxy devices. It is trimmed with a metal band and has a solid feel in your hand. The back of the case is plastic, but streamlines well with the rest of the device and doesn't give it a cheap feeling. One complain would be that the mini-USB port is on the bottom. I like them better on top next to the earphone jack, where it is more out of the way for me.CAMERA: I love the camera on this phone. The photos come out crisp and clear with the automatic settings and there are a variety of built in editing options and a flash. It also takes very, very good HD video.SPECIAL FEATURES: The S4 comes with some really cool features souch as Air Preview, S Beam, and a variety of Smart Screen options. Some of these are more of a novelty for me, like the Smart Scroll which allows you to scroll up and down web pages with your eyes instead of touching the screen. The air sensor options are something that I've actually found myself using frequently though. These allow you to manipulate the screen by waving your hand over a sensor instead of actually touching the screen. I have used it frequently navigating the browser, browser tabs and photo gallery. Since my fiance' has the S3, the S Beam comes in handy too. Like I said, these features are really neat, but for most users I would guess some of it is just a novelty.DISPLAY: This is my favorite part of this phone. The bright, vivid display is really something else. I watch a lot of Netflix and YouTube on my smartphone and this large, crisp display makes it a more enjoyable experience. It also makes for a better reading experience, whether it be e-books or e-mailed documents. The display is just great.SOUND: Sound is decent. You can listen to music loud and fairly clear via the devices built in speaker without earphones. I really like the Samsung brand earbuds that come with the device and the listening experience is better with those.CONS: Not much here really. As I said, I like the look of the regular Android UI more than TouchWiz, that's just me though. S-Voice clearly needs some work. The back casing isn't solid black, but rather a black/silver checkered pattern. Would look sharper in solid black. Would like a moveable home page \"apps\" icon. The persistent wifi status in the notification tray is annoying (you can get ride of it temporarily with a long press and force close, or through options provided by the development community). It just isn't necessary when you already have a wifi icon on the status bar. Most of this is minor stuff and can be remedied with various customization features offered by the development community.OVERALL: I absolutely love this phone.

I also upgraded to this same phone (bought from Wal-Mart) a week later, coming from the Galaxy S2.Some time over a year ago, the orientation sensor stopped working on her Inspire. Despite everything I tried, I could not get it working again. Then not too long ago, she dropped the phone and cracked the digitizer glass. I replaced it, but messed up by not removing all of the old sticky that held the glass on. As a result, the new one kept coming loose and lifting up. Needless to say, she needed an upgrade.My GS2 still works perfectly fine, and at first I didn't feel a need to upgrade, kind of on the fence. But after using and seeing my wife's up close, I had to.Pros:- It has a larger 5\" screen, which feels just the right size to me. The 1920x1080 resolution is awesome, especially compared to the GS2 and Inspire's 800x480.- It's thin and light, but feels solid. Not too wide either, despite the screen size, due to the thin bezel.- I also like the physical home button (capacitive touch on GS2 and Inspire)- LTE and NFC capability, which our older phones lacked- Charges fast with included power adapter- Battery has so far lasted all day for me on one charge- Faster hardware, which results in fast, smooth performance when using the phone- The IR blaster I really like, for controlling the TV and pretty much any other device that uses an IR remote- It takes great pictures for a phone, with a 13MP camera. Also has a lot of cool camera software features.- Still able to use an add-on microSD card for expanded storage, which is to include installed applications. The newest firmware enables this functionality, though third party apps can handle this as well, if root users (like myself) have not yet updated to the newest firmware.- I could go on with more, but that's too much. There are plenty of other nice software/hardware features, some of which may be really useful to some, and just gimmicky to others.Cons:- Not really a con, but I wish the basic version came more internal storage, such as 32GB rather than 16GB. Then the 32GB one could instead be 64GB, or 48GB possibly.- This doesn't bother me, but does some people. There is a little over 9GB of internal storage (of 16GB total) available out of the box, due to the OS and software installed on the phone. Not an issue for me, because of the ease of popping in an SD card.I tire of hearing people complain about the Samsung software, or \"bloatware\". If you find it gimmicky and/or not useful, DON'T USE IT! If you're worried about space and do not wish to use an SD card for whatever reason, root and remove/disable the software.This a great phone all around, and a worthy upgrade, especially if you have a phone 1 1/2 years old or older.", "Date": "July 24, 2013"}, {"Title": "Nice upgrade from S3", "Author": "AK529", "ReviewID": "RAFD2KXFUNYN0", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "When I first read all the reviews and new features about the s4. I thought it wasnt much of an upgrade besides the higher resolution 1080p screen. After owning this phone for almost 3 weeks I was very happy to find many more little improvements in the s4. Im just going to list everything to make this review short and sweet.ProsScreen is brighter for outdoor use than the s3. Although the screen is still not bright enough when compared to other smart phones, it is still an improvement from the s3.Battery life is improved from s3. With the s3 the best usage on LTE I could get was about 3 hours screen time and about 4 hours when on wifi. With s4 I am get an hour more of screen time on both. I have not got a chance to test the talk time with the s4 yet. But from the reviews I believe I can get the same as the s3 or more which is close to 11 hours of straight talk time.Wifi and network coverage is better than s4. I am getting coverage and faster speeds on both LTE and wifi.Phone is easier to hold in the hand since it is narrower, lighter, thinner, etc.Cell standby issue fixed from s3. When I had the s3 and used to go into battery usage stats cell stand by used to drain the battery more than anything else even when the phone wasnt being used. The only way to fix this was to flash custom roms. Xda has many threads about this issue. No longer an issue with the s4.Media card scanning issue fixed. With the s3 my large 64gb which was only half full used to drain battery and system resources when booting up. This is no longer an issue with the s4. The media card takes very little cpu usage and battery with the s4 on boot up.Improved Speaker with louder and audio and better quality audio. Although the s4 speaker doesnt have any thing close to what the htc one has. Its still an improvement from the s4. The placement of the speaker is better than the s3 but still gets in the way sometimes. The speaker should have been placed in the front like the htc one or on the bottom like the iphone 5.The screen is bigger and has a higher resolution than the s3. Reading, looking at pictures, playing games and watching videos is more enjoyable now than the s3.Ir blaster with remote app is a handy feature to have. Can control any tv, dvr, media device like an apple tv or blu ray player. The app also helps you decide what to watch and gives suggestions based on your feedback.Removable battery is the still one of the best selling features of this phone. No other phone on the market has this feature. I am a power user and love to be able to carry an extra battery with me. I dont want to always have to be tethered to power outlet whether in the car or at work or at home or on the go. This also allows the user to upgrade to an extended battery if they choose. The htc one, nexus 4 or the iphone 5 dont have this option and never will.Upgradable memory is the second biggest feature of this phone. Which allows the user to purchase a memory card as large as 64gb to the phone. This allows more storage for videos, music, pictures, documents, etc. The htc one, nexus 4 or the iphone 5 dont have this feature.Lockscreen missed called preview and sms preview. This is a feature apple and htc have had for a few years now. A feature I badly wanted in the s3 and now it has been added to the s4. I like being able to see how called me or see the text message by just waking up the screen and not having to unlock it or swipe down on the notifications. The screen also wakes up when there is text message now and reminds you every few minutes.Music player controls in the lockscreen for streaming apps like slacker, songza, pandora, etc. This feature was added to the s4 due to it running 4.2.2. This feature has been on the iphone for years now. You can now change the track or play/pause from the lockscreen without having to unlock the screen or swipe down on the notifications.Samsungs extra features nice to have I guess. I dont really use any of the newer features samsung has added to the s4. I find most of them gimicks that drain battery life. Most of them dont even work that well. I would probably use the feature that increases the screens sensitivity since I live in a colder climate. I could use this with my gloves to use the phone without having to take off my gloves in the cold. I already own a few pairs of touchscreen gloves. So again this feature doesnt really make a huge difference. Others may find some of these features very handy.ConsThe s4 has less than 10gb of app storage. This is due to the newer touchwiz interface and all the added features the s4 has. This probably would be ok, but, samsung advertises the s4 as having 16gb of storage. The 32gb verison of the s4 is also very hard to find and costs more. Samsung is working on this issue by making sure future updates take up less storage and samsung has also released an update which I havent received it yet. This update allows the user to move apps to the sd card. Once I receive this update and try it out, I will update this review. I currently have 120 apps installed out which 6 are games. I still have 4gb of app storage left on my phone. So If you dont play games that much you dont really need more than a few gigs of storage. But when compared to the htc one which has 32gb storage. I beleive it has close to 29gb of app storage. The nexus 4 has about 12gb of app storage and the iphone 5 16gb has about 12gb of app storage.As I mentioned before the s4 has a poorly placed speaker and it is only a mono speaker. When compared to the htc one and it is not even close to being good. But the speaker on the s4 is an improvement than the s3.The s4's screen is not bright enough. Especially for outdoor use. Again the htc one has a much brighter screen for outdoor use.The s4 does seem slower at times than the s3. Even though the s4 has a faster processor and is newer it seems to lag at times. This lag is noticeable more when swiping through home screens, opening apps and closing apps. I use nova launcher and it has made the s4 faster than using touchwiz but there is some lag from time to time. Many users and tech blog sites say the reason for the lag is the android version 4.2.2 which is running on the s4. Hopefully a future update will fix this issue.Overall a great phone. I probably wouldnt have purchased this phone If I hadnt dropped my s3. I was very happy with my s3 and had no issues with it. I still would have liked this phone to have a brighter screen, more app storage and better speakers.", "Date": "July 13, 2013"}, {"Title": "One thing to say: WOW!", "Author": "D.

Buying this phone I was a bit antsy about bulkiness and size, but it fits perfectly in hand, and even with otterbox-like case feels light and easy to handle with one hand.Software-wise: the phone is amazing. WatchOn built in, that allows you to control your tv, AV Receiver, and DVD player (thanks to built in IR blaster) is amazing. It has the ability to set up and name your own rooms, so you can actually forget about finding a remote.  S Voice is a very nice and accurate rival of Siri. I used both, and honestly, i'd say they both do great with exception of S Voice being able to launch apps by voice commands.Hardware: I REALLY WISH AT&T; stop restricting hardware on devices (or whoever is responsible for AT&T; version to have Quad core only), whereas rest of the world has Octa-core CPUs on GS4...  It might be my vision, but i think i noticed that under direct bright sunlight, i see the screen flickering a bit. Again, it might be just me imagining.

Venugopal", "ReviewID": "R2ZJM6JF6WBF3Z", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "The price from AT&T; was just right, the screen looked tantalizingly big, and I kinda like Android over the iPhone.But if Samsung intended the Galaxy 4 to be the iPhone killer, they have much more ground to cover. Don't get me wrong, the basics are just fine. Slim body, large screen, good battery life for a smartphone, when paired with the Battery Guru software, standard Android features. In short, its one heck of a smartphone, if you're into using Google (gmail, search, voice, etc) for everything.The disappointments are in areas where Samsung tried to innovate beyond the current smartphone paradigm. One much-ballyhooed feature involves tilting your head to get the screen to scroll up and down. After a few minutes of trying it, my luddite daughter, who was in the same room, took great delight in asking if I was having a seizure, seeing my head bob up and down at random. Well, so much for that, but there's another feature where you can tilt your phone to get it to scroll. That works. Most of the time. A third doodad has you waving your hand over a sensor to scroll up and down a page. Now this I mastered, though I suspect my colleagues often wonder why I feel the need to swat imaginary flies off my smartphone so frequently.Yet another feature allows you to see a preview of your email by pointing your finger at it. Similarly, one can get a preview of the contents of an album. But, it seems downright silly to point to my smartphone, inches above the screen, as if I was about to release a bolt of force lightning on the Gorilla Glass.Even when it works, most of the finger pointing and hand waving stuff only works on Samsung's additions to Android -- the browser and email apps in particular. The sensors haven't been integrated into the OS, and therefore no other app is aware of their existence.I had high hopes for the infrared blaster on the device, hoping to use it as a universal remote. I have a Logitech Harmony that I bought off ebay, and which has worked perfectly for our home theater for over a year now. Alas, here too, the Samsung excites, only to ultimately disappoint. The software does not recognize my Sony CT 100 sound bar. Given that the sound bar is also an HDMI multiplexer that mediates between cable, Blu-Ray and Roku, not being able to use this makes the whole universal remote thing rather useless.Being on the rather well-nourished side of things, I figured I'd use the Samsung health application to lose a few pounds. Here again, it took my height and weight (the latter being a growing number), and... did absolutely nothing with it. I was asked what my calorie target was. Well hello, shouldn't the app be telling me what my target ought to be? I could use the smartphone as a pedometer. But seriously, do you want a 700 dollar gadget rattling around in your pocket when you take a brisk walk or run? A $30 omron pedometer will do fine, and is much less risk.Another annoyance is the amount of bloatware that both Samsung and AT&T; have decided to pile on. Much of this is a duplication of stock Android software (for example, Samsung's audio/video stores).So, I'm back to using the Galaxy 4 as a big, generic Android phone, with some pluses like a thin body, an SD card slot, and a replaceable battery. Nothing wrong with that. I like it.

Samsung's voice control is supposed to be a wonder -- it can't even make simple phone calls with anything approaching a 30% accuracy. It won't work at all if you are in a fringe area, and when it does work, the response time is so great that you are left wondering if it is going to work.

She's so smart - it's like there's nothing she doesn't know how to do. She's pretty - maybe not a supermodel but way prettier than your last girlfriend. She's well-connected. Easy to please. And she WANTS to do everything for you.Except...she makes you feel stupid sometimes. Oh not on purpose, and not all the time...you just find you have trouble communicating. She's got a waaaay higher vocabulary than you. She doesn't always explain things to you - you have to figure it out on your own. She's kinda needy sometimes. She's dainty and you worry she'll get hurt. And her parents...the less you say about them, the better.Still, none of those things are deal-breakers. Far from it, even though she's out of your league, she's so open to whatever you want to do that you forgive the flaws. Because most of time, everything is wonderful, and you can't imagine life without her.That's what owning a Galaxy S4 is like.The S4 is the Swiss Army Knife of phones. It does everything. The only feature it lacks is an FM tuner. Yes, some phones do certain things better. Some are a little faster, some have a little better camera, a little better screen. But the S4 does all things well. The screen is fantastic. The camera is very good. It runs any app you can think of. It has tons of space and has an SD card slot. The battery is swappable. The call quality is pretty good. Samsung's TouchWiz interface, while not as pretty as HTC's, is more pure Android than others and it's functional and flexible. It has more sensors than you knew you needed. Accessories are easy to find because this phone is so popular - and there's a reason for that. It's a fantastic phone.The cons, really, are not so much cons as tradeoffs. The phone is light because it's plastic - you're gonna want a good case for insurance. Battery life when all the bells and gizmos are turned on is mediocre. And maybe the speaker phone quality is only ok. Physically, those are only things wrong with it. Also, AT&T;, like pretty much all mobile companies, is evil, but maybe more evil than most. Just stay low and get the right plan.Really, the biggest gripe I have with this phone is that it makes me feel like an idiot sometimes - and I'm not the dimmest bulb in the package. It has soooo many features and you will never use them all. You'll never use more than three or four of the included Samsung or AT&T; apps. The coolest features won't work the way you think they should work unless you dive into the sub-sub-submenus and look for tutorials online. The phone will randomly do things you didn't ask it to - but it's your fault, because you did a swipe when you should have flicked.She's a wonderful woman, the S4, but you'll never truly understand her.If it sounds like I'm coming down hard on the S4, I'm not - far from it. I love that it has features I've only begun to discover (I've had it just over a month). I gave it 5 stars because I really don't care that I don't know everything about this phone - the mere fact that it CAN do all those things is amazing.Yes, she's amazing, that S4.

At the insistence of techno-savvy friends I made a leap into the 21st century and purchased a Samsung Galaxy S4 smart phone and my life is forever changed.  It is easy to see and operate, all the apps are included and make sense; it's a little computer in your pocket.  You can ask it where to get a good BBQ sandwich and not only do you get a list, it takes you to the one you pick.  If someone calls while you are driving, you don't have to answer...it will tell you in a clear voice who is calling and ask if you want to accept the call.  Say no and it tells the caller you will get back with them later.  It's a calculator, flashlight, radio, alarm clock, video camera and remote control.  You can dictate messages, watch television, movies and listen to your favorite old rock and roll.  You can pay your bills, see the person you are talking to (or not), read books and magazines, buy coffee at Starbuck's, translate foreign languages and take a \"selfie\".  It reads those squiggly squares and plays games when you are bored...and that's just what I have figured out in a short time.  It watches your face and doesn't turn off if you are looking at the screen.  It does this really fast and the battery lasts all day.

Also, the phone settings used to continually change on their own and the touch screen is sometimes slow to respond, but either I'm getting used to it or it's mellowing out on its own.  All in all, it's pretty good: takes the place of a tablet in many ways and the camera with its on-board photo editing tools gives very good -- but not great -- results.

I've used one from time to time and have helped several family members learn to use them and occasionally do minor trouble shooting for them, and they're really solid devices overall.One of the best things in Samsung's favor is that they take keeping their devices updated pretty seriously. The Galaxy S4 is in the process of being updated to Android 4.4, where some manufacturers seem content to toss an Android device onto the market and then pretend that they have no idea that updates are a thing that should be happening. This will be a less severe issue down the line, because Google is restructuring the operating system a bit to make it easier for them to handle updates themselves rather than leaving a lot of it to the hardware companies, but it's still nice to get something from a company who's serious about their obligation to provide a good experience even after they have your cash in hand.Other than that, this has a lot of nice features. The screen is good enough for just about anyone. It handles opening and running apps at a nice pace. There's a simplified interface that hides a lot of the apps and noise, which can be good for people who find smart phones a tiny bit overwhelming at times. You can use it with a Miracast tv/receiver to mirror the screen on a tv to show off things like photos and videos without asking people to crowd around a tiny screen. The camera is excellent for both photos and videos.The screen is just a bit large for people who put a very high priority on portability and using a phone one-handed. On the other hand, this size is just big enough to be reasonably comfortable for people who struggled with the teensy tiny touch keyboards on the earlier generations of smart phones. Whether you like the way Samsung makes Android look is a matter of personal taste. I like the Google Nexus devices just a little better, but Samsung's approach is a very long way from the worst that you can find on the market.On the whole, while this isn't my personal device of choice, I've been really pleased with them. I tend to be the person providing tech support for my family members, so I've used them many times and I've had the happy experience of not being stuck putting in a ton of time trying to get them to work as they should. I occasionally tweak a setting here or there and do little things like check to make sure everything's been updated properly, but on the whole the Galaxy S4's in my life have been about as close to trouble-free as any piece of electronics I've encountered.", "Date": "January 15, 2014"}, {"Title": "Whats not to love.", "Author": "Amazon Customer", "ReviewID": "R2IGRTQU83G5DX", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I got this as a gift for my husband and it has been everything I had hoped.

The S4 has really blown me away and convinced me I should upgrade more often.  The difference in speed of the apps is just something that you'll have to see for yourself.  The phone is large with a beautiful screen, and while the size takes a little getting used to, after a couple of weeks now  I've adjusted.  It still fits in my shirt pocket and it's very light and thin.  This thing is loaded with features, powerful hardware that can run any Android app with blazing speed, and very well designed Samsung apps that enhance and ease the use of the phone and even your own data and networks.  Samsung includes an app that lets you access and share data across all your devices that's very useful and serves a real use for those using Android devices on Windows networks.  I'm not sure if the S4 is considered a 'phablet' but it should be...  I was able to install Office 365 Mobile and it's actually usable.  Typing on this phone isn't nearly as challenging as the smaller phones.  I won't be writing any novels on it but I can open and edit documents as needed, and forward them to wherever I want, or save them to my Windows network storage.  Google has amazing document and spreadsheet capabilities built-in to Google drive too so don't worry if you don't pay for Office 365.  Browsing is fast and I've had no issues using the Chrome browser on this phone except that you can't close Chrome on the phone.  You need to keep a shortcut on the home screen to force close apps until that bug is fixed or you'll drain your battery.  Battery life is very good and  I can get a full day's use without worry.  I usually have about an 1/8 of my battery life left at bedtime and I'd say I'm a moderate to heavy user.  The camera takes pictures good enough to capture and share to your albums, but I don't think any professional photographers will stop carrying a better camera around.  It's great for the rest of us though.  Large beautiful screen, blazing speeds, useful built-in apps, good camera, and just under the 'too big to be a phone' margin...

While the Nokia is an excellent phone hardware wise (the camera is amazing) the Windows ecosystem was miserable. No apps, boring, and it didn't play nice with anything Google. I couldn't wait for my contract to end, so I paid full price for this phone and haven't looked back. Samsung is a solid company and they make great devices and appliances. I've have two Samsung TV's, Samsung Washer/Dryer, Samsung HDD, Samsung Laptop, Samsung Monitors and a Galaxy Note 10.1 Tablet and the phone is the perfect addition to my Samsung lineup. Oh, did I mention it was Android. :)In the past I've had HTC, Motorola, Nokia and 2 Samsung smartphones and Samsung has always been my favorite. The S4 is a beauty to look at with it's large 1080 screen, is fast with it's quad core, and it takes great pictures with it's 13 Megapixel camera. It does suffer from poor photo quality indoors with low lighting, but otherwise it's on par with the Nokia 920. My only complaint is that Samsung doesn't allow you to access your camera or any of the other lock screen widgets if you use any kind of password protection. This is not default Android behavior, and I hate having to unlock my phone when I want to take a picture. I won't remove a star for that but would remove 1/2 a star if I could. It is rather annoying. Some people complain that it looks cheap with it's plastic design, but really who cares.

She's so smart - it's like there's nothing she doesn't know how to do. She's pretty - maybe not a supermodel but way prettier than your last girlfriend. She's well-connected. Easy to please. And she WANTS to do everything for you.Except...she makes you feel stupid sometimes. Oh not on purpose, and not all the time...you just find you have trouble communicating. She's got a waaaay higher vocabulary than you. She doesn't always explain things to you - you have to figure it out on your own. She's kinda needy sometimes. She's dainty and you worry she'll get hurt. And her parents...the less you say about them, the better.Still, none of those things are deal-breakers. Far from it, even though she's out of your league, she's so open to whatever you want to do that you forgive the flaws. Because most of time, everything is wonderful, and you can't imagine life without her.That's what owning a Galaxy S4 is like.The S4 is the Swiss Army Knife of phones. It does everything. The only feature it lacks is an FM tuner. Yes, some phones do certain things better. Some are a little faster, some have a little better camera, a little better screen. But the S4 does all things well. The screen is fantastic. The camera is very good. It runs any app you can think of. It has tons of space and has an SD card slot. The battery is swappable. The call quality is pretty good. Samsung's TouchWiz interface, while not as pretty as HTC's, is more pure Android than others and it's functional and flexible. It has more sensors than you knew you needed. Accessories are easy to find because this phone is so popular - and there's a reason for that. It's a fantastic phone.The cons, really, are not so much cons as tradeoffs. The phone is light because it's plastic - you're gonna want a good case for insurance. Battery life when all the bells and gizmos are turned on is mediocre. And maybe the speaker phone quality is only ok. Physically, those are only things wrong with it. Also, AT&T;, like pretty much all mobile companies, is evil, but maybe more evil than most. Just stay low and get the right plan.Really, the biggest gripe I have with this phone is that it makes me feel like an idiot sometimes - and I'm not the dimmest bulb in the package. It has soooo many features and you will never use them all. You'll never use more than three or four of the included Samsung or AT&T; apps. The coolest features won't work the way you think they should work unless you dive into the sub-sub-submenus and look for tutorials online. The phone will randomly do things you didn't ask it to - but it's your fault, because you did a swipe when you should have flicked.She's a wonderful woman, the S4, but you'll never truly understand her.If it sounds like I'm coming down hard on the S4, I'm not - far from it. I love that it has features I've only begun to discover (I've had it just over a month). I gave it 5 stars because I really don't care that I don't know everything about this phone - the mere fact that it CAN do all those things is amazing.Yes, she's amazing, that S4.

Unlike Apple's antiquated, stagnant software, with Android you can clearly see the evolution with each upgrade. Android 4.2.2 is a seamless, flawless, and easy-to-use interface paired with quick response time. I got a iPhone 5 (64GB) for free and sold it because I was so bored! Lol.I must admit that I preferred the design of the S 3 to the S 4 but apart from that I am ecstatic that I chose to upgrade now.

When I first got the phone, the box itself was gorgeous, it felt like it was nature inspired. The setup was easy but I had to make a Samsung account.Touchwiz on Android 4.2.2 is good, I like it, but remember it is always changeable.  The bloatware that it came with was really bad, it took up half the space, it's like actually getting an 8gb Galaxy S4. Even though you can buy a microsd card it only allows storage of photos, videos, but not apps. I actually returned the 16gb version and went ahead and gotten the more sizable 32gb Galaxy S4. All the neat little features it advertised work, but they still need to be more efficient through updates. I like the idea of being able to turn over the phone if you are listening to music or someone is calling you can just turn it over and not worry about going in and turning down the volume or accept the call. The camera is absolutely beautiful, it's the little things that count on this phone, such as being able to say cheese and it will automatically take a picture. The camera itself is 13 megapixels, it tends to make the picture better than actual reality which is crazy! The whole phone runs buttery smooth, from accepting a skype conference, to remote desktop connection via splashtop, and even playing Minecraft. This really is a great and powerful phone, with 4g Lte, the speed is crazy, I went to a cabin in Tennessee and got 50mbps download, thats faster than my wifi speed. Everything pops out right at you when using 4g LTE, like when you're typing in the search bar BAM! its already done loading! Also the fact that it came with AC wifi, which is next generation wifi speeds, I luckily have an AC router and this was the first device to utilize ac speeds of up to 1.75gb theoretically. The wifi is just as fast as the 4g LTE if not better. This phone is packed with so much stuff it's hard to tell all about it in a review, trust me if you buy this, you will be blown away by the overwhelming features and possibilities of this device. don't let that scare you though, the device has an option for easy mode which kind of dumbs down the phone but its great for first time android users.

Because if you google \"gap in HTC one\" you'll see the same issue I had which gave me the reason to return (Glued parts to the Aluminum body is not always done perfectly!).In my opinion, Galaxy S4 is a very practical phone because: 5\" Display is perfect for surfing internet and watching movies, sleek and light weight design, speedy CPU, 2GB RAM (1.78 GB available), Excellent Camera, Very good battery life and very good call quality. What more do yo expect? I agree that \"Touchwiz\" which is SAMSUNG's skin (User Interface) on top of the stock android is less polished than HTC sense, but for me it was simpler and more practical to use.You may not use all the features with all the bells and whistles, but for sure there are more useful features than any other phones in the market right now.Some complain about Battery heating during charge, I agree it warms up a little, but surprisingly the charger is a 2.0A charger which can give the charge to S4 big's battery in about 1.5 hr or so!

The \"air gesture\" works fine, but i'm not a big fan of it. I would rather touch the screen to move on to the next page or photo instead of having to wave my hand. Either way I'm still using my hand and muscle so what's the big idea? As for the \"Air view\", it doesn't always detect my eyes and won't auto scroll down the page for me. I have an average size pair of eyes and not to small or to big. So that function sucks and useless. Now I would just have to scroll with my fingers instead. Next is the \"Smart stay\" feature. Now i tested that out on watching youtube videos and it doesn't always work either. This feature doesn't always detects your eyes. Now with the battery life. It seems to be draining a lot of battery when I'm play sudoku. Within 1 hour, it drained 30% of the battery and this phone of mine is only 2 weeks old.

I've pretty much been a Droid user for my whole life.  I'm definitely a power user and I greatly enjoyed having a keyboard.  I could type long text messages or emails with ease, and I never really had that much interest in switching to a non-keyboard phone.  Unfortunately, that decision was taken out of my hands somewhat.  I have the Droid 4 which I greatly enjoy, but it has it's own problems.  After having it for about a year it got a pretty nasty crack on it.  I played around with some friends GS3's and was very impressed with them.  However the rumors about the GS 4 coming out had already started so I decided to hold off.  I'm glad that I did, but a lot of my review will be based off of not having the GS3 and making such a drastic switch.  As I put in the title, it seems to be minor improvements upon a design they've found worked as opposed to the drastic changes previously seen.  Without further ado...The Looks:There isn't much positive to be said about the aesthetics of the Galaxy S4 body to be honest.  It looks and feels like a cheap toy.  It feels... clammy might be the best way to describe it.  It really isn't the best feel when you're holding it, and compared to the HTC One it's disappointing.  It doesn't seem like it had that much effort put into changing it.  It does feel sturdy though, despite being a very thin phone.  I was able to get a good grip on it though which is important to me since I'm rather small.  Overall I would give the looks a 2.5/5The Hardware:Huge upgrade over.. well anything but a computer.  This really is just a small computer, and it runs flawlessly.  The screen is massive and great.  Easily the best one that I've seen on a phone.  The 5\" screen could be a little bit big for some people I think, but for most of the younger generation will be ok with it though.  The battery is incredible as well.  My Droid 4 would die around 4 or so after a normal days use (streaming music, internet, tons of emails, etc).  This will last me all day, including going out at night which is a massive incentive to me.  The camera is great on it as well, much better than any other Android phone.  It is still slightly edged out by the iPhone though.  Overall though I would give it a 5/5 on hardwareThe Software:I'll start with the obvious, it's actually running the latest version of Jelly Bean, and should keep up better than other phones do (minus Nexus 4.)  This is a huge bonus, because Android's because fault is that the OS is so fragmented.  Now, Samsung has put a ton of their own software on top of Jelly Bean.  The best description would be that it's overwhelming probably.  There are a lot of Samsung apps that really will just never be used.  So I'm not even going to bother going over the party trick type apps.  Instead I'll talk about a few that really caught my attention.S Health:  Helpful now, will be awesome in the future.  The premise is that it's a basically a fitbit built into your phone.  It helps you track calories, steps walked, workouts, etc.  It works great now, but I don't think that it will get better with accessories.WatchON:  Basically it acts as a universal TV remote and a Netflix browser.  It's great, and I don't even watch very much TV.  I suspect that this will become the standard soon, but until then this is the best version you can get.Air View/Gesture:  A great idea, but not great in practice.  It's glitchy currently and doesn't always work (or does work in ways that you don't want it to.)Camera Software:  There's actually a lot of really great features that come with the camera.  The most novel of them is the ability to take a picture from the front and back cameras at the same time.  I can see this actually becoming standard in the future as well.Overall I think that the software is good, but not perfect.  Overall I would still rather just have stock jelly bean.  Samsung adds some good features, but it also adds a lot of stuff that I really don't need and can't get rid of.Final Impressions:It's a good phone, there's no doubt about that. It's not a great phone though.  The screen is amazing, the body isn't.  The software is good, the hardware is out of this world.  It all comes down to personal preference between this and the HTC One I think.  Personally I'm fine just putting a case on my GS 4, but I've always been more interested in battery and hardware.  I can completely understand picking a slight downgrade on those areas though in return for a great body like the HTC One has.4/5", "Date": "April 29, 2013"}, {"Title": "love it!", "Author": "Susan from Indiana", "ReviewID": "R1ZVX5RQQ3CIEM", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I had an iphone 4.

At last with many calls I was able to buy this phone. When I got the phone I was not able to activate (exactly followed the Amazon email). When again called to customer service, She almost took my one hour and was unable to activate. Again I talked to customer service in the evening and was very furious with the comment something like \"I was not authorized to purchase this phone for my at&t; account\". Finally they were able to activate. I honestly say that, I don't like Amazon any more. I have to spent almost 10 hours of my time to buy a phone. Same on Amazon and your customer service.

I'd say it works a few minutes a day.  I have checked many, many, many online forums, and this apparently cannot be fixed.  It just reads, \"Searching for GPS\" - always.  It is NOT a problem with the signal.  The problem is definitely the phone.  As a result, I cannot use the navigation function, which is very important to me.My sister has an iPhone 4s, and my brother has an iPhone 5.  Neither has this problem.  Their phones work flawlessly.  If I could, I would switch to one of those.  Based on that alone, I would recommend the iPhone over the Galaxy.The screen is also too dim.  Even at its brightest, it's quite difficult to see in daylight.  Again, no way around this, and both the iPhone 4s and iPhone 5 are consistently more visible in the same conditions.From what I've seen, the HTC One series also tends to perform the Galaxy in these aspects, but I haven't compared it as frequently.", "Date": "June 5, 2013"}, {"Title": "Nice but fragile", "Author": "V.

Industry reporting indicates 44 percent of Android users are still using versions 2.3.3 through 2.3.7 - known as Gingerbread - which were released in 2011 and have a number of security vulnerabilities that were fixed in later versions. The growing use of mobile devices by federal, state, and local authorities makes it more important than ever to keep mobile OS patched and up-to-date.\"The bulletin proceeded to identify SMS Trojans, rootkits and fake Google Play domains as security threats and offered various mitigation strategies.For example, to fight against SMS Trojans it advised, \"Install an Android security suite designed to combat these threats. These security suites can be purchased or downloaded free from the Internet.\"To protect against fake domains, \"Install only approved applications and follow IT department procedures to update devices' OS. Users should install and regularly update antivirus software for Android devices to detect and remove any malicious applications.\"The IT industry and tech-savvy users have known about these types of security concerns - stemming from Android fragmentation, most mobile phone manufacturers' sloth and indifference, and user inertia and ignorance - for a while now. But apparently the DHS and FBI just noticed this summer. \u00b5", "Date": "August 28, 2013"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "Unavailable", "Features": "NULL", "Name": "Samsung Galaxy S4, Black Mist 16GB (AT&T;)", "ImgURL": "NULL", "ProductID": "B00E6FG5I6"}}
