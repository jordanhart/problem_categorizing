The only noticeable difference is you lose Siri.  Really no loss at all she is cool but rarely used because she rarely understands what I say unless it is a entry into my calendar. All in all I would buy the 4 again over the 4s.", "Date": "June 9, 2012"}, {"Title": "Will definitely purchase from you guys again", "Author": "MsBacon", "ReviewID": "R229Y7IFGR95I8", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Purchase an Iphone (sprint) from them and it came extremely quick and in amazing condition.
