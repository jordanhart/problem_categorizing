Posts all the specs of the real HTC s720E which holds a quad-core 1.5GHz processor, nvidia Tegra3 chipset and 32GB. When he sends it, it is this really weird clone, although I admit that the retina display is quite real, certain things are just not right, for example, the fact that the android version in it is 4.0.4 and is not upgradeable in this clone. Additionally, the phone came with no IMEI, yes NO IMEI!!! Therefore the phone could not be put in a network. I got a pretty clone of a paperweight.

Al Banna \"Lucky\"", "ReviewID": "R3CTC83RHP3CJL", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "So i bought the HTC One X after changing from HTC Incredible S. and really, that's a big jump in clarity, speed and performance. let's make this quick but i won't mention the actual specs figures coz it's all over the net anyway, just personal use to knw how it is.Design: Fits perfect in the hand unless ur hands are small. The feel of the cover on the back is great, doesnt leave finger print. I got the white one and the HTC logo is in metal which is sexy. many of my friends checked out the phone, and loved the design. very light.Screen: amazing wide screen, great for many tasks like web browsing, gaming...etc. the feel of the glass of the screen is SO soft that ur fingers will slide on the screen (ull knw wt i mean whn u use it). very bright (though i keep it on low brightness for better battery life and better vision for health LOL, no really) coz it is actually reallly bright at maz level.Performance: latest android installed and many apps and the phone does not lag. still flip through the screens and switch between apps easily without lagging. tried opening few apps and web browsing and the phone works fine.Phone Calls: called friends and tested the voice clarity, they all said ur voice is really clear and i can hear them clear as well. tested the ear phones that comes with it (they are not beats ear phone and also not in-ear buds. just regular HTC ear phone) used it for around 4-5 days, and yes, the other party can hear me just perfect, thu it does not stay on ur ears very well (kinda loose bcoz its not ear buds) but they do the job and clearly.Camera: 8 mp but it is okay, i wouldnt say its the best n greatest, but it is just good and clear and best about it is the snap shots, if u wud like to take few pics at few seconds, thats the one.Battery: i heard people complaining about the battery and a new software is out n all that. i didn't get any issue with bad battery probably coz that i got the phone after the release of the new tweak. bcoz i actually got a msg whn i turned on the phone for the first time, saying please update the software. but im not sure wt was that software all about. anyway, the battery is alright and not that bad as i read. i charge it once a day only with average use, 1 hour web browsing, around 1 n half hour phone call, 30 min gaming, few music tracks. quiet an average use (with low screen brightness, which is not that low by the way).Extra's: built in Face unlock phone, so u dont need to enter a number to unlock ur phone, just keep ur face there and the front facing camera will detect and Unlock. dont worry, u can take as many pics as u want to recognize u, in light, in dark, with hat, with glasses, what ever so the camera can recognize u in different looks. HTC sense 4 is pretty awesome. The keyboard, as always (and thats why i love HTC) to type numbers and charachters, u can just long press on the specific character and there u go (instead of changing the page to press a number then back again to the letters page)what i didnt like about it (though i knew it and bought it anyway) the battery cant be changed and the micro SD is not external. internal Memory and battery. and the power button is on the top, for a big screen i think power button should be on the side like samsung phone coz on the top u really have to stretch ur finger, but that's just a personal opinion.that's all i cud think at the moment, please let me know if u have any Q's", "Date": "May 2, 2012"}, {"Title": "Excellent phone that stopped working in 6 months", "Author": "Mayuresh G.", "ReviewID": "R18YTAUV34080S", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "The HTC One X was a wonderful phone when I bought it from Amazon.

I bought the phone and started to use it but my data package (Internet) was NOT working at all. The WiFi was working, but the data package was not working. I returned the phone on my expense and it cost me $26.61. They deducted $25.00 from the price I paid for the phone!!! I emailed them and said that it is not my fault that the phone is defected!! They said it's not defected because we tried it and it works!! I said I went to t-mobile themselves and they checked all the APN settings and they said it's fine, but still the phone hasn't worked. They said this phone is not unlocked properly!! I told them I don't buy an UNLOCKED phone so that it works on some carriers and not on others!!! An UNLOCKED phone should work on all carriers and everywhere!! Then why am I paying the whole retail price if I won't have a phone that won't work fine on all carriers!! The guy I email from this company kept saying that they tried this phone on AT&T; network and it works fine!!! I don't use AT&T; and I want it to work on t-mobile not AT&T;!!Bottom line, they just stole $25.00 form the price of the phone and made easy profit from me and most probably others by deceiving the customers and putting untrue information about their products and then you return it (on your expense) and they take the restocking fee and the phone is back to them and they resell it again and again!!!", "Date": "July 26, 2013"}, {"Title": "Best Android phone Its The King! of all", "Author": "Doris.ec", "ReviewID": "R7UGYA60FO18U", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Really nice phone more than expected for that price love it and that is all that I have to say about this product!

I have not seen even one lag in my 2 week use of this phone.My mother has a Samsung Galaxy S3 and it has proven more laggy than my HTC One X.The Jelly Bean update is amazing on this phone. If there was any trouble with battery life or lag, Jelly Bean completely eliminates it.Project Butter works amazing with the Global Version's quadcore. And battery life has been improved significantly with its power saver option.I can get a solid 15 hours straight of normal use. And while watching a complete movie with full brightness it barely drained the battery by 15%.My only complain about the phone has to do with multitasking, some of the apps refresh when you switch back and forth making it a little bit annoying when web browsing or working on documents.After everything this phone is amazing and would recommend it over the Samsung Galaxy S3.

It destroys the screen on any latest phone including the Samsung Galaxy S3, iPhone 5, and many others. The colors on the screen look very natural unlike the cartoon colors on the Samsung Galaxy S3.Speed & fluidity:The Quad Core Tegra 3 processor makes the phone very fluid and fast. Although the phone takes a while to boot after that the phone will run very fast. The launcher is very smooth and switching between home-screens there is not any lag even with many widgets.Sense 4:Sense 4 is a huge improved compared to the previous versions of sense. No longer is it extremely bloated and confusing. Sense 4 is very simple and straight to the point.Cons:No microSD card:Many people need a micro SD card to make it easier to transfer data from their old phone.Battery Life:The battery will last me half a day before I have to charge it again. Compared to many flagship this phone does not have good battery life.Mutitaksing: Sense 4 stops many apps that run in the background.
