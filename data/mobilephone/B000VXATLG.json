She really loved her RAZR and never warmed up to the slider.  I did a ton of research and this phone has great reviews from everyone.  I initiall ordered it from Cellular Blowout.  What a nightmare.  The order was cancelled, thank God.  I wised up and ordered through Amazon.  Fast and dependable as always.The phone came in an impressive package.  We slid in the AT&T; sim card and it worked instantly.  Not all the contacts moved over, but not a big deal.  Paired with bluetooth effortlessly.  The call quality is top notch. A lot more bells and whistles but my wife will never use them.The bottom line.  Same great RAZR.  Much better built quality.  Improved sound.  2 giant screens.  You cannot go wrong with this phone.

I can only say it's sturdier, has a way faster menu navigation, louder sound and a sleek design.It seems to me slightly bigger than the v3 and it's just slightly smaller and thinner than the trendy iPhone.

When i first opened it, it was very cool, motorola designed the box of the phone to be at top with the phone. I popped in my at&t; sim card and everything worked fine! Calling and texting works, im still trying to get my internet settings figured out. This is a very nice phone, and i suggest it to anyone that is looking to buy. This phone looks and feel like a million bucks. One thing i was diappointed in was the fact it lacked external touch sensitive controls. They only work with the music player. But when you get a text you can view and reply to it without opening the phone but you have to use the side controls.

But here it goes you don't get the 2gb which is not indicated by amazon but 419MB exactly. this really isn't an issue for me because i have an 80GB ipod and i wouldn't use the phone as a media player in most situations just for custom rings for some of my friends. If the average song you put on is 5MB u could out about 89 songs on it which is unlikely for me. and let alone if you gonna cut the songs for playing custom address contact rings anyhow it is enough. But it has surprised me i do get a better quality signal and physically a beautiful phone. Just hope amazon are more clear on some of their labels for items you would have a less customer dis-satisfaction ratio.If you tell the customer exactly what to expect then why would they be bothered sometimes amazon is too vague.But all in all a good phone and the no warranty sucks but that can't be helped it is from aboard", "Date": "March 23, 2008"}, {"Title": "Good phone, exactly as described by the review", "Author": "A. J. Bright \"arcticandyb\"", "ReviewID": "R1N6T03TLLRKXK", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Some people need to learn to read the review on the website they're buying their products from.  Apparently a few reviewers went to the Motorola website and just assumed that everything listed on the spec page would be included with the phone sold from this site.The review clearly states it comes with 512MB of NON-upgradable memory.  It clearly states there is NO SD or MicroSD expansion slot.  It doesn't mention a touchscreen.This phone does everything the review states.  It's over $80 less than one bought directly from Motorola and you'd think people would understand why that is.We buy these phones because we don't want to be tied to long-term contracts.  This in turn means some of the phones more advanced or even desirable features will be missing.  The phone is capable of 2GB of storage, but only if you buy one directly from a carrier like AT&T.;  The benefits of doing so include getting more memory and few extra features, the drawback is you will be tied to a 2 or 3 year contract, with the full price of the phone (usually inflated to several times the actual retail cost) due if you decide to break it.There are three choices.  First you can pay the full retail price for the phone and still only have the features listed here, the memory listed here (512MB), but you'll get an English manual and maybe a free USB cable.Secondly, chain yourself to a long term contract with penalty clauses for leaving early, but you'll probably end up with a phone that has more memory.  If you're using a phone as media player, this may well be your best choice as long as you know there are far superior alternatives.Finally if you only intend to use the phone as a phone with perhaps email, texting, photos and few other things thrown in, don't want to tie yourself to a contract and you're happy downloading a pdf copy of the manual from Motorola.. then you get the cheapest version, but also the version with the least available features activated.", "Date": "March 4, 2009"}, {"Title": "Very pleased with Item and service", "Author": "Herbert M.

This phone is very well designed and it's easily my favorite cell phone ever. No, it is not a 'smart phone' or Blackberry, but it's slick, plays music, is easy to text on, easy to play games on, and has an SDHC mini expansion port. The screen is very nice and has reasonably good resolution. The camera takes decent photos, especially considering this design is over 2 years old.

I mean most phones go through an inspection process to make sure that the phone works, but not these phones. So anyways this first phone i received had a bad battery, charger, and bad keypad, the 1, 3, and 5 buttons didn't work, the touch screen on front didn't work, and the two soft keys by the screen didn't work. Not there fault. Sent it back and requested a new one, and I promptly received the second phone, defective again. This time the buttons all worked but it would change the ringer after i closed the lid and opened it so bad that i couldn't get it to stop. Along with that issue the metal of the phone interferes with the signal causing constant dropped calls in places i would get 5 bars on my Samsung.

This phone was based off a similar design so I though it'd be a good fit.THE BAD * The phone came in a different language. I think French. It took me about 4 minutes to get it from French to English. During that time I noticed the phone was slow. Normally about a 1.5 second delay from the time I pressed the the middle select button til the time the screen changed. Not a good sign * Once I finally got the phone on English, I realized I had no service. Imagine that. I got service with my old phone. I get 3G service with my iPad. This phone's antennae could not get even 1 bar. * The camera: I know phones don't have amazing cameras. My ROKR was pretty decent. This poor phone's was mediocre. No pictures looked good unless it was taken in direct sunlightAnd that was the extent of my use. I can't have a phone that doesn't work.THE GOOD Well, even though I used the phone for 10 minutes I did like some features of the phone. * The LCD screen was nice, vibrant, and was not easily washed out by the sunlight. I went outside to see if I could get a signal; even in sunlight, the screen was still visible. Motorola did a good job with this screen * The buttons on the phone were big and easy to press. The phone is a big phone. Not quite as wide as the iPhone but about about 3/4\" shy of that. * I like the menu layout. Very intuitive. The pictures match exactly what you think they do. Hence, it was easy to navigate in FrenchI'm not sure if this phone is a good phone or not. Were my ROKR got very little signal, this phone got none. Where my ROKR was fast, this phone lagged. I've seen other reviews saying this phone is slow to navigate, I can confirm this. While 1.5 seconds isn't dire, its not that good either. My ROKR had 2GB of music on it, I used it as my camera, and the photos came out very well for a mobile phone. This phone could do neither. The camera had trouble focusing on anything unless it was in bright sunlight.Overall, I'd say go with a different phone.", "Date": "August 2, 2010"}, {"Title": "Very pleased", "Author": "Maris", "ReviewID": "R28JABJUKYE6TR", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I ordered this with a bit of trepidation, since I'd read a bunch of reviews of unlocked phones and it sounded like you could never be quite sure what you were going to get.  However, I'm happy to report that everything works perfectly.  I put in my T-Mobile SIM card and transferred the contacts, and all was well immediately, no need to reprogram the voice mail number or anything like that.  A couple of things which don't bother me but others may have issues with: the default language of the phone was French when I turned it on -- I didn't have any trouble reading the menus to change it, but I suppose this could present difficulties to someone entirely unfamiliar with the language.  And the charger is for European outlets, with an adapter for American plugs, making it a bit more bulky than it could be.  It also comes with a USB cable though, and charges both from my computer and from a USB wall adapter.  One strange and slightly annoying thing is that the phone won't ring, either for calls or the alarm, while it's charging from the USB cable.  It works fine when charging with the included charger, however, so this isn't too much of a problem.The phone has very good sound quality in calls, definitely better than my previous, older Motorola phones, and it's very sleek and shiny too, with a large, sharp screen.

So why am I writing a review here, for fun and because the reviews other people posted are not accurate...  When I got my RAZR2 V8 early this morning I was OMFG excited but then for some reason I couldn't access the V8's features because it was asking me for a SIM card and I didn't have one...  I went to the mall and asked questions about SIM cards...  When asked if they sold SIM cards at At&t; they said yes and told me that appart from paying for the SIM card I would also have to pay for the activation of the SIM card and for the minutes too...  The people at AT&T; also told me that some of the features on my V8 wouldn't work because it wasn't designed for use with AT&T; service so I definately said NO to that!! So I went to TMobile bought a SIM card from them for ten dollars for ten minutes and I was happy...  BTW, when I bought my RAZR2 V8 Unlocked I made damn sure it has 2gb memory and it does!!! After getting rid of the SIM card problem I could finally enjoy the features of the V8...  The first thing I wanted to do was download all my Favorite music from my laptop to my V8 and I love it, all my favorite music sounds CRYSTAL clear!!!!  I always wondered if you could use a song as a ringer because I heared other peoples phones ring with their favorite music and I asked questions about this but my question was never answered...  So playing around with my V8 Unlocked I found out that you can apply a song to a Ringtone and whenever I recieve a call the song I applied the ringtone plays and thats just a another thing I love about my RAZR2 V8!!!!!  The camera and the video camera are ok but I'm interested my music more... Music synced from my laptop to my V8 was fast!!  I say it took three to five seconds for each song...", "Date": "February 7, 2008"}, {"Title": "great phone", "Author": "spacecheetos \"*IT*\"", "ReviewID": "R6FGLQBMD3QBV", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "word of warning i did not buy my phone over the net, am just reviewing the phone....i recently moved to france and needed a cell phone, i heard that \"orange\" one of 3 phone coverage companies, was the best (most coverage).looking over the choices... and not liking the idea of a slider... i chose the v9, it is sleek, stylish and big. i am a small lady but do not like a cell that is so small i feel like it will slip through my fingers or make me look silly because of how tiny it is.this phone is best suited for a guy or a lady with large hands, it is easy to grip and the buttons are large enough that you can see AND hit them with out much effort or mistakes.the amount of options are fantastic, mp3, tv, video and a camera... very cool. picture quality is very good for a cell phone and i love that i can play around with the images, tints and such.the fact that i am in france but not a native speaker, it is great that i can change the language function back to english so i know that i am not hitting something by mistake ..oppps te heeethe only thing i dont like is the screen on the outside, i am having a hard time finding a case that alows the phone to flip open and not block the screen while still protecting it... te hee..have already dropped it and crack the screen. with a warranty plan i can get a replacement but still.over all it is a fantastic phone... oooo and the ring tones are not all cheese girly. i know i am a girl but omg not all chics are pink and frilly...ugg. i love that i can use fun ring tones or upload my own music as a ring tone... when i get the chance i will be uploading \"cant be cool\" from the anime ghost in the shell...yes i am a dork but a happy one lol", "Date": "July 16, 2008"}, {"Title": "My cell phone", "Author": "Suzanne Mcdonald", "ReviewID": "RN2M94T3DDQDN", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Phone was what I wanted except the colour was not dark pearl grey which was what I wanted.", "Date": "May 25, 2009"}, {"Title": "A heads up about the languages on the phone", "Author": "Ernesto Diaz Cevallos \"egdiaz\"", "ReviewID": "RVI7MAIBKF2FN", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I think it's a great phone, but spanish speaking users will suffer big time.. there's no spanish language in the phone menu...Plus, all the manual that came enclosed with the phone where written in russian or some language from an ex-URSS country.I bought the cell phone thru Amazon and not from any of the other parties that offer the same phone.", "Date": "April 28, 2009"}, {"Title": "info", "Author": "Josbel Millan", "ReviewID": "R1YJ0LW9F7512K", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "The product this one well though I have my doubts in certain matters, this model of cellular has memory(report) of 2 gb and the one that they me sent only has 512 mb and in addition they included since(as,like) all cellular others neither the cable of information nor the headphone estereo.

Bell", "ReviewID": "R2DTQSOEQXJQ1Y", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "I've been less than satisfied with the RAZR2.Pros:- This is undoubtedly a very, very good looking phone. It's really thin, yet very sturdy. Mine hasn't attracted any scratches or dents, which is a testament to the good construction of the actual phone.- Good voice quality on both ends. I've been told I'm a little bit quiet, but background noise is minimal.- Camera is above average in image quality. Video is fine.Cons:- VERY sluggish interface. I have to wait 2 seconds after trying to go into Messaging, and about 3 for Contacts. This is unacceptable seeing as it has a powerful CPU underneath it.- Did NOT come with preset Internet and MMS settings for AT&T.; I had to search online for both of the settings and do everything myself to get both of them working. Motorola's site did not help at all either.- The keypad is usually fine, but sometimes I find myself accidentally pressing more than one key at once owing to the fact that there's no real way to judge where one key begins and another ends when you're texting fast.- The \"space\" for text messaging is in the most awkward place! Instead of on the bottom-right side like on every other phone I've ever seen, it's on the bottom-left side. It's really annoying to get used to and I can't really see why they'd do that.- In all the reviews and previews I read, it talks about the cool \"touchscreen\" aspect of the phone. I bought this phone because I thought it would be cool to have a phone with a touchscreen. A few months in and I've still yet to see any way I can use the touchscreen! When you get a text message, I'd love to just touch the screen and see the message, but instead you have to press a button on the side. My friend's Verizon RAZR2 also lets you take pictures with the front screen as a touch screen - this version of the phone doesn't have this which is disappointing. I think you're only able to use the touchscreen if you have music on the phone, which is impossible in this case because there was no data cable that came with the phone. All together I'd just have to label the touchscreen as a gimmick.- And finally, less than a day of using the RAZR2 the cover for the charger port fell off. That's just lame, and I probably won't be able to return it now because of that.All in all I wouldn't recommend this particular phone. Go buy one for your respective service - I'm sure they'll have lots of cool features you'd be missing out from on this phone and you won't have as much of a hassle setting it up.", "Date": "June 21, 2008"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "Unavailable", "Features": "This unlocked cell phone is compatible with GSM carriers like AT&T; and T-Mobile.
