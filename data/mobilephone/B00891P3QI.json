{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Great phone so far! Highly Recommended", "Author": "Pushpin", "ReviewID": "R3MYOCLI3UEF9X", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I've had the new Galaxy 3 for a few days and it has really grown on me. I upgraded from the Galaxy S (Captivate) which I loved as my first smartphone but I got it as a free refurbished model so it had a few issues (nonfunctioning GPS and random hiccups and restarts here and there). I was a bit wary of sticking to Samsung after having a bit of trouble with the previous Galaxy model. Despite the hiccups of my personal copy of the Galaxy S, I decided to give the III a try.After opening up the beautiful box that the Galaxy III arrives in, I was a bit dismayed that the phone seemed a bit flimsy. To insert the battery and SIM card, you basically have to pry off the cheap plastic back cover with your fingernails. It seemed a bit strange, especially since the Galaxy S had a sliding metal cover and was built like a hockey puck. This is my one main complaint about the III. The Galaxy S is going on strong after two years of drops and falls without any protective casing but I don't feel that the III can sustain such heavy abuse. I'm sure it will survive a few accidents but I don't think I'm comfortable subjecting it to my previous carelessness with its predecessor. After sticking the battery in, the casing feels a bit more solid and the back cover locks in tightly.Also, memory expansion and replaceable battery gave the III an edge over other new smartphone models. The III also comes with a nice set of headphones/mic and of course a charger.In terms of size, it is pretty obvious that the III has a much more screen space and is much larger than the Galaxy S and many other smartphones. I have small hands/fingers but I was able to manipulate the Galaxy S with one hand. Not so with the III but that's hardly something worth complaining about. The screen is big and beautiful. Colors are crisp and the contrast is very good. I think the screen isn't as bright at the Galaxy S screen but it is still an improvement as the colors aren't as jarring.The phone runs rather nicely. It's very smooth and I feel intuitive. Coming from Android Gingerbread, ICS isn't too much of a change. Switching tasks is a breeze and it is noticeably faster than the Galaxy S. It also outperforms my boyfriend's Motorola Atrix 4G which also has dual-core (though, it is now two years old). We ran the same tasks and app on the both the phones and they have parallel performance. Additionally, a Quadrant Test ran at 4758 (if that means anything to you). The Atrix tested at 2091.Another reviewer complained that the phone ran hot. I didn't really see this as an issue with my copy. It does warm up a bit but no more than the original Galaxy S and not to any concerning level.The S Voice is a nice addition and works surprisingly well. I've never tried an iPhone or Siri so I can't compare. S Voice is a nice touch but I felt a bit slower than expected. It is far more accurate and intelligent than whatever voice function the Galaxy S had. It is very sensitive to a fault so it will attempt to decipher any kind of utterance (so no thinking out loud!) There are a few things that are pretty gimmicky like the Smart Stay which is supposed to keep the screen active while your face is watching it. We felt that this feature was unnecessary and may be a potential battery drain since it will recognize your face even if you aren't actually looking at the phone. It may be a useful feature for movie viewing. Fortunately, this feature can be easily disabled.The two cameras are really good. I am a DSLR user and I'm big into photography. I thought the Galaxy S camera was OK but the III's cameras are a big step up. The rear camera focuses very, very quickly and with a touch of the screen you can easily change the focus of the photo before you take the picture. Obviously, it cannot compete with DSLR photographs but it takes pretty decent photographs for a phone. It doesn't exactly rival compact point & shoot cameras but it is close.The III also comes with some useful apps like Kies Air which allows you to change your phone around (edit contacts, add music, etc) through your computer without having to plug the phone into USB. This a great feature especially when you are getting started with the phone for the first time and are importing data. There's a fair amount of crapware from AT&T; but they can be easily removed or hidden. You can easily hide apps by going to Application Manager, hitting Force Stop and then Disable. This can quickly remove unwanted or rarely used apps without having to root them.Battery life on smartphones is terrible in general. With moderate use, I can get through the day with some battery left to spare so it is good enough. It lasted 12 hours of regular use of GPS, apps, phone calls with 10% to spare.Overall, I'm pretty happy with the phone.  Other than investing in a good protective case and learning to be more careful, I can't really find much to complain about. I'll update my review as I go along but so far, I recommend it highly.UPDATE: A month in and I still love this phone. It is incredibly fast and reliable. I haven't had it crashed once so far. The processing speed is great. I used to shy away from using my previous smartphone to do quick internet research because it was slow and unreliable. The SIII really makes you feel that you have the world at your fingertips. Very quick.I am an AT&T; customer and I ordered this phone through Amazon. There were a few problems when my account was transferred to this phone but AT&T; quickly cleared it up. As for the network, I know AT&T; is well-known for having a crappy network. Having been an AT&T; customer for a long time, I don't know any better but unless I'm in a known dead-zone like a basement or a dense apartment building, I have had no issues with connecting onto the network or making calls. No dropped calls so far, also (which is amazing because my Galaxy S would drop calls ALL the time). Still in love with this gizmo.", "Date": "July 5, 2012"}, {"Title": "Nice Size Screen, Snappy ICS 4.0, Great Phone - US Version", "Author": "electronicnut", "ReviewID": "R22TKOOQUSRZNM", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "First, this is a review of the US version of the phone. I tried to put a review up on the US version, but Amazon wouldn't let me. So hopefully this helps out people deciding to get the US version of the phone. In case people are wondering this is for the Sprint network.The US version of the phone differs as it has a Qualcomm Snapdragon S4 Processor with 1.5 GHz Dual-Core CPUs, while the the rest of the hardware specs are the same as the international version.I switched from an HTC EVO 4G to get this phone and so far it's been great! Here are the things I like about the phone:* The phone is a nice size, it's lighter than my HTC EVO 4G.* The processor is one of the fastest US released Android phone, and it comes with 2 GB of RAM.* I played around with the camera and video camera and the quality is great in my opinion. (I'll post some pics or a video later.)* The ICS 4.0 is really snappy and it opens up applications quickly.* It comes with Google Wallet. I signed up and got a free $10 to use. (I'm going to McDonald's to test it out!)* I've only use the S Voice application a few times, but it seems to be just like Siri on my wife's iPhone 4S.* It comes with a micro SD slot in case more space is needed to save pictures, videos, etc.* You can change out the battery if needed.* Battery life last twice as long compared to my HTC EVO 4G.Now for some cons:* This is carrier related and not the phone itself, but there is no 4G LTE on the Sprint Network. Other networks such at AT&T; and Verizon should be better, but I'm stuck with 3G speeds for now.* The phone is so nice, that I baby it all the time!I was on the fence about getting this phone or the HTC EVO 4G LTE aka HTC One X. The main things that I like over the the Samsung Galaxy 3 over the HTC EVO 4G LTE is that it comes with the Micro SD slot and also the battery can be changed if it ever goes bad.I love this phone! :)", "Date": "June 30, 2012"}, {"Title": "The Samsung Galaxy S3; A review by a smartphone newbie.", "Author": "Chris Enge", "ReviewID": "RU5HKU6PQ4GA8", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "After years of sticking with my plain, but solid, flip phone, I decided to jump off the cliff and onto the smartphone bandwagon. I had held off on joining the masses because it seemed like every time I turned around there was a new and improved smartphone.  Why waste the money when my phone will be obsolete  by the time I get it out of the store? Then I heard about the up and coming Samsung Galaxy S3 (S3).  After reading hours upon hours of reviews on the S3, all of a sudden I couldn't get my check card out of my wallet fast enough.  If you are thinking about purchasing a smartphone, or are just looking to upgrade, I hope this review will help you reach the same opinion I did; The Galaxy S3 is the best phone in the... universe. I'll begin by saying MASSIVE is the first adjective that came to mind when I opened my Samsung Galaxy S3 box.  The display on the phone is an incredible 4.8\" which, for me, coming from a standard flip phone, felt like what I would imagine upgrading from a standard 13\" television to a 50\" HD plasma T.V. would feel like. After the initial shock of the size wore off, the next thing I noticed was the gorgeous color.  The S3 comes in two color choices; marble white and pebble blue. I had picked the latter, and let me tell you; I made the right choice. I also noticed that the phone weighed less than I had expected with a phone this large.  In comparison to my old flip phone, the S3 has all the same basic buttons from volume control, an on/off switch and a main menu button.  Some could say that the size of the phone makes it awkward or bulky, and I found it took me a few days to adjust to the size myself.  However, after having played around with my new S3 for about a week now, I believe the benefits far outweigh any downsides to having a phone this large and, to further give credence to this opinion, I'll talk about the display, camera, and lastly, the video camera, which greatly benefit from the size of the Samsung Galaxy S3. For starters, the resolution on the S3 is amazing. With a 720 x 1280 pixel display, the clarity of anything you do from the main menu on the phone is mind boggling.  After I noticed the display, I decided to check out the picture quality. The Galaxy S3 has two different cameras; an 8 megapixel (MP) rear-facing camera, and a 1.9MP front-facing camera, both of which I find quite useful.  For example, for every day pictures from facial shots , action shots to still portrait, I find the rear-facing camera to be the best fit.  However, if I want to make sure I'm not smiling like a complete idiot, or have something stuck in my teeth, the front-facing camera comes in handy.  Having a 4.8\" screen is incredibly useful for knowing exactly what's going to turn up in your picture.  Furthermore, the cameras on the Galaxy S3 come with many different features, one being the 'burst shot', which will rapidly take five pictures in a row, which really helps when you are trying to catch the split second your kid will smile while you are holding a camera.  From what I have heard from friends, the camera perks on the S3 resemble other smartphone's camera options, so for potential migrating smartphone users, there shouldn't be much lost in translation if you decide to make the move to Samsung's Galaxy S3.  On the other hand, if you're coming from a flip phone like I did, it will take a while to get adjusted to all the different camera options, but once you do, in my opinion, it's worth it in the long run.  As far as video goes... Let me start by saying I tried to find something bad, broken or annoying about the video options on Samsung's Galaxy S3. I searched but to no avail; the video on the S3 is simply perfect.  First, with a 1080p at 30fps video camera, the quality is just as great as you will find on the best high definition T.V.'s  on the market.  For instance, I tried using the Skype application on my S3, so I could video chat with my daughter, who lives in California.  The video quality was comparable, if not better, than what it is on my computer, which allows me to see my daughter even when I'm not at home in front of my computer.  However, if I was forced at gun point to come up with something negative about the video aspect of the S3, I would say, that at 30fps, you may experience some slight lag if the objects/people you are recording move too quickly.  I only experienced this lag once, when recording moving cars while running, and it was hardly noticeable.  Overall, Samsung's Galaxy S3's video camera is a strong selling point to take into consideration when looking for a new phone. In summary,  I'm very happy with the fact that I purchased a Galaxy S3.  The huge size of the screen, along with the resolution, is incredibly useful when texting, emailing or playing games. The cameras on the S3 come in handy in pretty much any situation I can think of, so it's nice to be prepared for anything and everything. The video camera is easily the best thing about the S3 in my opinion, and it was the final thing that helped me to decide to purchase a Galaxy S3. I hope this review helps those of you out there who are looking at possibly purchasing a  Galaxy S3. I realize there are other specifications and options that could be covered in a review, but I chose to focus on the main things that are important to me, and I assume to some others, when looking for a new phone.  Buying a smartphone is not an easy decision, especially with today's economy, so remember to take into account the additional data costs that you will have when purchasing any smartphone.  Last night, I made the decision to write this review, because it's rare when I have few, if any, complaints about a gadget I decide to buy and, with the Galaxy S3, that's exactly what I bought.", "Date": "July 5, 2012"}, {"Title": "Great Phone, but Not Perfect!", "Author": "LoveMyToys", "ReviewID": "R23739Y7T88SEA", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "The GS3's sexy specs and glossy good looks (particularly in pebble blue) won me over.  On launch day, I swapped my beloved Droid Razr Maxx, for the Samsung Galaxy S3.  Prior to the Maxx, I briefly owned the Verizon version of the GNexus (which I can't recommend at all).  Before I get into the nitty gritty details, with pro's, con's and comparisons, at the time of this review, this is the phone you have been waiting for--the phone that will make you use that upgrade or cause you to sign a ridiculous contract with Verizon.  After spending ten minutes with the phone, it's an obvious step up from the Razr Maxx and Galaxy Nexus--the former top tier Android phones on Big Red's network.PerformanceAs much as I loved my Razr Maxx (and its marathon 2-3 solid days of battery life), after spending a few minutes with the GS3, the performance leap is very noticeable.  The GS3 is silky smooth, with no lagginess at all.  Apps (particulary heavy duty games like GTA III) launch quickly and are game play is flawless.  I know many of you aren't going to play anything requiring more than the occasional fling of a few angry birds, but the GS3's ability to handle hardcore mobile games with ease is a sure fire indicator that it will be able to run 99.9% of the apps out there in two years.  In other words, this phone has the chops to allow you to make it through your contract without starting a countdown for your next upgrade.How about some real world examples of the GS3's muscle?  The Qualcomm S4 chipset with an industry leading 2gb of Ram can cut through 1080p video files like butter.  Surprisingly, it was able to play back a 23.5 mbps AVCHD file using hardware decoding decoding!!!  I was even able to take play back the file with the video in screen, while I did a couple of google searches. The average $400 laptop would have a tough time handling that!The GS3 doesn't disappoint on the audio side either.  While HTC touts its Beats Audio Technology, that's nothing more than a brand name equilizer setting with limited value-- unless you're spend $100 or more on a beats headphones (which I personally don't care for).  Sammy, on the other hand, dropped in two Wolfson digital to analog converters, which allows the GS3 to pump out lossless high bit rate music with ease.  Using a pair of Etyotic HF3 IEM earphones, sound quality was crisp and clean for music playback.  Even lossy tracks streaming from Amazon Cloud sounded surprisingly full.  Much more so than on some other phones that I own.  In terms of music playback, the GS3 is every bit the equal of the iPhone and possibly a little better.The ScreenThe's GS3's 4.8\", 720p HD screen is a stunner!  The Super AMOLED panel provides rich color saturation and outstanding contrast.  The panel used to make the screen is beautifully fabricated.  the slight curve in the design makes it a pleasure to touch.  Text is crisp and I see no issue with this most recent implementation of pentile technology.  The fuzziness from Galaxy S, GNexus and Fascinate is a thing of the past.  Watching videos on the GS3 is a treat.All is, however, not perfect with the GSIII's screen.  While the contrast and color saturation are strong points for the phone, if you like natural color tones, the pumped up saturation levels may bother you.  Personally, I would dial back the saturation level if I could.  The GS2 had a settings menu that allowed users to tweak brightness, contrast, tint and saturation.  For reasons I don't understand, that great feature was some how left behind on this next gen phone, which is a real pity.While saturation is a matter of taste, the real issue with the screen though is brightness.  Even cranked to 100%, the screen still seems to be a few nits behind the curve.  I would love to be able to dial up to 120%.  The maximum brightness is noticeably less bright than the screen on the Maxx (which Motorola sourced from Sammy).  So, what gives?  I am not sure, but my best guess is that in the interest of improving battery life and to compensate for the size of the screen (and the power that size screen will suck), Sammy choose to put a software restriction that limits the ability of users to pump of the brightness.  Hopefully, this can be cured by a future firmware update.While the brightness could use a boost, this deficiency is further amplified by awful auto-brightness implementation.  When auto-brightness is turned on, the phone makes sudden and drastic adjustments in brightness even in a consistently well lit setting.  It seems as if the software has only 3 settings for brightness when it is set to auto--low, medium and high (which isn't that high to begin with).  The phone will drop from high to low suddenly, leaving the screen unreadably dark.  Until Sammy sends out a software update to fix the problem, I have disabled the auto-brightness feature.Software ImplementationThe user interface for this latest version of touchwiz is really very nice.  This phone provides IOS levels of comfort and ease of use to a smartphone beginner, but allows the flexibility for the nerds among us to customize the phone to suit our needs and tastes.  CNET and Phonedog have done excellent video reviews on the GS3's user interface and software features and highly recommend that  you check them out (Amazon won't allow links to outside sites--so you'll have to google them).I do have a few software gripes, one of which could effect some peoples' buying decision.One of the purported advantages of the GS3 over its top competitors from the HTC One line of phones is the fact that the GS3's has a micro SD card slot and accepts up to 64gb cards.  Android allows must apps to be saved and launched from the micro SD cards.  This feature allows low and mid-range phones to be made with limited internal storage because users can add their own cards.Sammy, however, wants power users to buy the bigger capacity 32gig phones for an extra $50.  To force us to buy the step up model, Samsung disable the ability to move apps from internal storage to the micro SD card.  I am not sure of the size of the app partition in the phone, but I hope Sammy didn't put too big of a restriction on internal storage or that could be a problem for some people down the road.  I understand why Sammy made the decision to disable the feature, but it seems like a low rent Apple type move to me and, in fairness, the HTC One series doesn't accept SD cards at all (nor does the iPhone nor any of the current Windows 7 phones).Another small grip I have is with Sammy's decision not to incorporate ICS's native ability to generate folders for apps simply by stacking one app icon on top of another .  Motorola incorporated this feature on its ICS update to the Razr and its native to ICS, so why force us to have to press the menu screen, select create folder and than drag and drop files?  Sammy, that's very Gingerbread of you.  A good UI should use the strengths of the underlying Software and improve on the weakness--not just make changes for change sake.  This is one of the few areas that the Sammy's \"Nature\" UI seems to fall short.Battery LifeGripes are over for now. :)  The batter life on the GS3 seems pretty decent.  I have had it off the charge since 8:30 this morning (its 4:47 in the afternoon), and have been using the phone heavily.  Screen on time is about 2:53 minutes.  I have done some light web surfing--shopped on ebay and amazon for a new case for the sammy.  Send about 7 or 8 emails, 10-12 tests, and made about 80 minutes worth of phone calls.  Brightness is set to around 90% (auto-brightness is disabled).  I even played about 15 to 20 minutes of GTA III, and watch about 20 minutes of an episode of Lost on Netflix.  It's now 6:33 in the evening and the battery says it has 62% remaining.  I would still be in the mid-80's with the Razr Maxx and the GNexus would have been dead or on the charger a few hours ago.I would say the battery is good--but it's not close to being in the same league as the Maxx.  The fact that it is removable, however, does give it a major step up on phones like the HTC One (X-S), Razr (original), Sony ION, iPhone 4S and Atrix HD.  In short, if you are on Verizon and don't need the Maxx's 2 full days worth of battery life, I would take the GS3 over the Razr Maxx (which is exactly what I did).CameraThe camera on the GS3 gets top marks.  It uses an updated version of the same 8MP Sony sensor used in the iPhone 4S.  Unlike the iPhone 4S, there are options galore for tweaking your photos.  I am really impressed with the sharpness of the phones, even in low light.  Depending on the shot, the camera on the GS3 (and photo quality in general) is very comparable to photo quality on the Nokia 808  and iPhone 4S.Video quality is on par with the photo quality.  It shoots very smooth 1080p video.  Color is good and the video quality is genuine HD quality for most shots.  If you shooting a sporting events or other fast paced action, or are pan quickly, there is a lag in time while the camera gets in focus.  In fairness, I see the same issue with the iPhone 4S and I have yet to see a smart phone camera do better.  Audio quality on the camera is also quite good.Call Quality and ReceptionI have had no problems with reception at all.  Unlike its GNexus stable mate,  the qualcomm radio and baseband in the GS3 are top notch.  I have excellent signal strength on Verizon's network.  Call quality is excellent.  The people I called say that I sound like I am on a landline--and they sound just as clear to me.  Data on Verizon's 4G LTE Network is also strong.  I located in the metro NY area.  I am consistently pulling 18-24mbps download and 9-16mbps upload speeds on the 4G Network.  I get strong reception for Wifi and great broadcasting for Bluetooth as well.Comparison with CompetitorsI have no regrets about trading up from the GNexus to the Razr Maxx and even less regret about trading from the Maxx to the GS3.  Despite its plastic build, I think the phone does have a premium feel.  It's not as solid as the Maxx, but no one is going to look at the pebble blue version of the GS3 and thinks--that thing looks cheap.  It's comfortable to hold.  The HTC One X has a sharper, brighter screen and a camera that is on par with the GSC's.  The lack of a user removable battery is a big knock against the HTC One series however.  The iPhone is, well, an iPhone.  As nice as the iPhone 4S may be (and it's great phone), the lack of LTE capability and low data rates on Verizon's CDMA network make it a no go for me.  On ATT, however, it can take advantage of higher HSPA+ speeds, but ATT's network has been having some issues lately.  For that reason alone, if I am married to ATT or am on Sprint or Verizon for that matter, I am taking the GS3 over the iPhone 4S.ConclusionThis is a solid phone and a no brainer if you are on the market for a phone right now and have $200.00 in your pocket!", "Date": "July 13, 2012"}, {"Title": "Best phone I've had thus far", "Author": "Jake E.", "ReviewID": "R1G7AHMI87EVKG", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I've had this phone for a week now and played around with virtually all the options. My main concerns were call quality, app speed and battery life. The Galaxy S III excels at all three. As far as features, the phone has more than you need. I personally like the face recognition and NFC functionality. The screen is also outstanding. Clear as day in any lighting situation. The only function that has room for improvement is probably the S Voice which is a Siri-like voice command center. It's a novelty feature that I didn't use much on the iPhone 4 and will get the same usage on my GS3.The backing does feel a little \"plastic\" but I plan to get the OEM flip cover which will remedy the issue. Other than that, great phone and highly recommended.", "Date": "July 2, 2012"}, {"Title": "I love this phone", "Author": "Amazon Customer", "ReviewID": "R3CBK0BFMP9LE1", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I had upgraded from a Palm Centro, which I was using after my Palm Pre had an \"accident\", so the Galaxy SIII was a HUGE improvement.  My mom has an Infuse and I liked that, but I'm much more tech savvy and knew I wanted the S3 the first time I saw a commercial.  (Incidentally, the S3 is about the same size as the Samsung Infuse.)As a college student, this phone has been so much more useful then I would have guessed.  I have saved PDF files to it so I can read them if I'm waiting somewhere, I have apps to keep track of my assignments and schedule, I even can view MS office documents on the go (was completely impressed when I discovered I could also view PowerPoint slides).  Occasionally I will check and post to Facebook, but I use my S3 more for useful things than social networking.Battery life is better than I expected.  I don't talk on the phone a lot, but I do use it quite a bit.  I usually spend 30-45 minutes between my first two classes playing a game or using my e-reader app on my S3 to pass the time.  When at college I leave my phone on, I just silence it so I can check it between classes, and by the end of the day on Mondays, my longest day (8 hours), I still have 50%-65% battery life left.  I leave my Wi-Fi, GPS, and Sync on all the time, and usually have Mobile Data turned on so I can use data outside a Wi-Fi area (which I love that option, just in case I'm getting close to my data limit).  Rarely have I needed to charge it before I'm ready for bed (I think there were only two nights in a row I had to charge it early when an app went funny and drained the battery).  If you are going to be a heavy user, I'd suggest picking up an extra battery or carrying a charger around everywhere - it is a smartphone after all, and we all know by now smartphone battery life is not the greatest, even if this one does have a better battery life than others.While the phone is wonderful, I have to say it isn't quite perfect.  The back is very slick, so without a case it can be hard to grip, and even would slide its way out of my pocket a little bit when I sat down.  I bought a Ballistic SG case, which also isn't perfect, but it has a wonderful grip and solves my pocket-sliding problem.  The S3 is rather large - something wonderful for the display, but not so wonderful if you carry your phone in your pocket.  It does fit in mine, but sometimes just feels bulky.  I have had the S3 freeze to the point where I had to restart it at least twice in the two months I've had it, but nowhere near the number of times my mom has had her Infuse freeze.  S Voice is a nice feature, but is far from perfect.  The recognition is inaccurate and hardly saves time.  She did tell me she was sorry I felt she sucked, which was at least worth a laugh.That said, I would definitely recommend the Galaxy SIII.  No phone will ever perfect (regardless of what Apple fans might think), but the S3 is close enough.  Sometimes I get the \"oooo\" gasp when I pull my phone out at school, but by now most people have seen it.  Even my math professor was impressed just because of the screen size when I was using the calculator on my S3, and he's an Apple guy.  My neighbor was jealous, but now her husband has one.  My one brother asked to use my phone when he visited because he wanted to watch a video on YouTube.  I asked him what was wrong with his iPhone (4), to which he replied \"your screen is bigger.\"  He might be slowly seeing the light after realizing how free the Android OS is compared to Apple's restrictiveness, and he was impressed with my S3.  If S Voice was more accurate, he maybe could have been swayed from the dark side and joined the rest of the family (we all have Samsung phones: my S3, mom's Infuse, and my other brother's Solstice 2).  I've already told my mom her next smartphone should be a red Galaxy SIII, but she has a long wait until she's eligible for an upgrade.", "Date": "November 15, 2012"}, {"Title": "Swift & Sweet", "Author": "Winter", "ReviewID": "R29P4V5B39CV17", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I loved my Galaxy S I, but it went nuts in the course of the last year--it would do the most bizarre random things, like freeze, change the ringtone or the contact pictures for people...so needless to say I was gunshy about staying in the Samsung Galaxy.  Earlier this year I slipped off to Evo-land and had a great experience with the HTC Evo One X, but at the end of the day, AT&T;'s version of the One X was too limited:  no added storage, sealed battery, too much pre-loaded junk, too much data-gobbling.  I wasn't ready to live that much in the cloud.Thus far, the Galaxy S III has been the answer to all of my problems.  It has none of the senility of my Galaxy I, it is far snappier than the Galaxy II I played with, and the Android 4.0 OS has me giddy with its response time and smooth transition from one program to another.  Yes, the Galaxy S III really can multi-task, and is happy to do so.  Best of all, I slipped in my 32GB SD Card and we were ready to go.  The HTC One X consumed just over 6GB of its built-in 16GB; out of the box, the Galaxy S III takes up a little over 4, but will allow you to slot in an SD card of up to 64GB in size for even more room.  If the battery stops holding a charge one day, I'll just open the case, pop it out, and put in a new one--how handy!INTERFACE AND SETTINGSWith the Galaxy S III's interface, there are a LOT of options that let you customize your phone to be just as you want it:  it's as if the makers of both the Galaxy III and the Droid OS decided to bend over backwards and hand you the keys to pretty much every feature you can think of.  For example, if you hate eating data when someone e-mails you an attachment, you can set the phone to only pull down attachments when on Wi-Fi, or not at all.  Check for new messages anywhere from 'continuous' to 'daily' to 'never' (which means 'manually').  Hotmail works much better now that Exchange is supported--my Galaxy I would take forever, drop out, freeze, or give me nagging, 'Too many requests' messages.Getting around is smooth swiping with the Gorilla Glass on the Galaxy S III's face, but I'm still going to grab a Steinheil screen protector.  SWYPEing is easier, too:  not only is the onscreen keyboard huge, with the keys generously spaced wherever possible, but the SWYPE interface draws your swipe line cleanly and it is easy to see what word you are SWYPEing.  Word suggest is still annoying--tap out the word \"text\" and get \"Texas\" inserted--but once I turned this off, everything else worked well.  If there's one disadvantage to the Galaxy S III, it's that both the phone and the screen are a real fingerprint magnet: the Evo X picks up stains and smudges, but was just a bit better about not getting as much smeariness on the glass.  Still, with either device the problem is solved by a quick swipe across your shirt.APPS AND WIDGETSAndroid phones now use the Google Play Store instead of the Droid Market and it works fairly well:  enter your Google account info and you're ready to go.  AT&T; customers still get CRapplications they can't remove, but your own third-party apps can also be side-loaded after changing one setting in the options.  You can't root the phone (yet, anyway), but I'm not seeing the horrible performance drag of all that AT&T; stuff like I used to.  I'm especially fond of the side-loaded Amazon App Store, which nimbly pushed all my apps down with no complaints, security warnings, or performance drops (take that, ol' Galaxy I!)Applications now come in two form factors:  Apps and Widgets.  When you tap the 'Applications' button from the home screen, the resulting screens are tabbed between a list of Applications and a list of Widgets.  Think of an 'App' as meaning \"An icon I tap to launch a program\" and a 'Widget' as \"A thing I may launch, or may just interact with at the screen and never need to open separately\" (like the Weather, the media player, or the flashlight).  When you swipe from one home screen to another, adding Widgets now gets a Windows Phone like twist:  some widgets are double-wide like a Windows Phone 7 tile, and some (like the media player or the clock/weather on the main home screen) take up half the screen--the variety of sizes also resembles the coming Windows 8 Metro interface.  Instead of feeling crowded, it reminds me of how much fun it was to play with my first desktop gadgets in Windows Vista.NETWORKING AND DATAWi-Fi and Bluetooth are very responsive:  connecting to various networks or pairing is quick.  If you connect to the type of network that requires you to open a browser and agree to something/provide a user ID before you can connect, the Galaxy S III will prompt you accordingly and automatically open the page you need.  There is also a button right on the pull-down menu to turn off packet data so you can conserve your data plan--I like that feature VERY much.MULTIMEDIAMultimedia playback is excellent:  while my Galaxy I would take quite a while to open and respond to me, the Media Player Widget makes my music quickly accessible.  True to form, I get album art, artist/title/album searches, and a very good quality of playback over the included earbuds.CAMERAThe Galaxy S III has two cameras:  one in the front and a much better one in the back.  Both are for taking photos and shooting video.  The camera on the back is for the serious picture-taking and has a very high-output flash for such a tiny LED.  Picture-taking is so fast I find myself accidentally snapping multiple shots!  The gallery of my Galaxy S I might take a while to show me newly-snapped photos, but with the S III they are not only instantly available, I can go straight into the Gallery from the Camera and not have to step out to the home screen.  Flash can be adjusted on and off, switching cameras is as easy as tapping one icon, and there are a variety of easy-to-access options, from three focus modes (Auto, Macro, Face detection) to generic 'shooting mode' settings:  Single shot, burst, HDR, \"Smile Shot\", Beauty, Panorama, Share Shot, and Buddy photo share.  Settings includes the ability to adjust the exposure value, and what's more there are scene modes for sports, night, party/indoor, etc.CALLSThe feel of the Contacts and Phone Dialing interface haven't changed much, but the look certainly has:  icons, contact pictures, and menus are larger on the Galaxy III's generous screen.  I found myself making fewer mistakes trying to nudge and poke my way through the touchscreen when I needed to look up a contact or merge their information.  Call quality is excellent, and answering the phone is easy.  As with all new phones, there are many ringtones, alarms, and message sounds to choose from:  I was very pleased with the variety of options this time around--the many sounds you can choose from for your calls range from soothing and tranquil to jarring and noisy.If you're looking for a new Android Smartphone, the Galaxy S III is a fantastic choice.  Its screen is bright, colorful and generous, the OS runs smooth and fast and the screen is very responsive to touch.  The number of features at times seems endless, but more importantly, Samsung have executed those features well:  this is indeed a great phone.", "Date": "July 10, 2012"}, {"Title": "Best smartphone to date.", "Author": "Huskerhawk", "ReviewID": "R26RN9U23TCPOW", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Best phone I've owned. Great combination of size and weight, plus delivers on usability and functionality for things I actually use!  Very easy to work in and change settings, find files, transfer music, video, etc.  Really happy with this phone and would highly recommend to everyone.I've had Blackberry devices, iPhone 3G and 4, 4S, and this Galaxy S3 beats them all. I was new to Android, but it has been fine and the learning curve is more one of familiarity than anything else.  Within a day of using this device, it felt like I had been using it for years.  The widgets are awesome...that's something I didn't really think about or thought I would use/need, until I used them...great, handy things to have.  The entire home screen(s) is customizable so you can have what you want where you want it.  I don't like a lot of screens to move through, so I cut it down to two main screens, but every app is just a couple of clicks away if/when I need it.The display on this phone is the best.  Some say it is a little dim, and that is true on darker scenes, but overall I don't like an overly bright display and usually turn mine down to help conserve battery anyway.  The colors are rich and it's very sharp. The HD is amazing.I downloaded the gingerbread keyboard and youmail for voicemail, and both are fantastic.  I had issues with the AT&T; messaging app not showing me new text messages, so went back to the standard messaging and grabbed youmail, and am very happy with both.The size of the device was shockingly large when I opened it, especially because I was coming from the iPhone 4S...that went away in about a minute.  Now I can't imagine using the smaller phones.  It fits in my pocket, and it's so light, it doesn't feel as large as it is.  My wife just switched from her iPhone to the Galaxy Note...now that's a big phone!  Compared to that one, this S3 looks tiny!  The Note is really large, but even that was much more usable and functional than I expected (but that's for my wife to review in more detail!).I have had no issues with the phone, I tweaked the settings after the first few days to help maximize battery life, and it now lasts more than a day.  I watch videos on it every day and play music on my commutes, in addition to moderate texting and a call or two each day.  The LTE is very fast and you can now use firefox on it so syncing across desktop and mobile use is really nice.Camera and video are amazing. Best I've used on a smartphone, hands down.  Expandable memory is a huge plus...16GB on the device and 32GB on a card is great.  The NFC is still more a gadget but it's cool...using with the tectiles is nice, but still fairly limited for now.So many features I haven't played with them all yet.  One nice thing I stumbled across was changing the font size of messages in SMS by using the volume rocker...ingenious idea and great for my old eyes!Won't be going back to Apple as long as this phone and its successors continue to deliver the way this one has.", "Date": "September 13, 2012"}, {"Title": "S III- I really wanted to like it...", "Author": "S. LOTT \"LOTTSOFCRITTERS\"", "ReviewID": "R19MHFQ828RU81", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "... And I do, mostly.  The device itself is nice.  Unfortunately, the device is only half of the story.  The issues I have are primarily with the programming of the device.I had high hopes for S-Voice.  I commute 2 hours each way to work, and was really looking forward to having a voice program that I could really use to make calls, send messages, and set reminders.  I don't care about finding every random fact, but I wanted the functionality of S-Voice.  Overall, S-Voice does all of that...  the BIG problem with S-Voice that prevents me from using it is the fact that I cannot stand to use it with bluetooth- I have tried both an ear piece that I have used and loved for months (Blue Ant) and a speakerphone (Motorola Roadster 2) that I purchased for the sole purpose of making S-Voice more tolerable...  Neither work.  The tones they have in S-Voice are not adjustable.  You cannot change the sound or volume.  If I turn down the volume on the bluetooth or handset- it just turns down the other sounds.  The beeps when S-Voice is beginning to listen and finished listening- HURT MY EARS!  I have contacted both AT&T; and Samsung to try to change/adjust the volume/sound.  It is not possible.  This is so frustrating because I wanted S-Voice to work... but it hasn't 'learned' my voice yet, and it frequently takes multiple tries to place a call or message correctly- and each try has both beeps...  it was unbearable.  I have since switched to mymotospeak.  This effeciently sends/receives calls and messages on the first try.  I do not have the ability to set appointments or reminders, and need to access navigation separately, but it is much more effective with the bulk of what I need.  It seems odd to make such a big deal about the beep... but it is bad.  When it is on speakerphone, my daughter complains about it from the backseat...My only other complaint is that when I am in the text screen, typing a message- if I receive a text while typing- the keyboard disappears.  When this happens, there is no telling what you will be pressing or sending until the screen finishes processing any pending 'touches' and/or the keyboard comes back up (about 1-2 seconds).  Some people I text send multiple messages, and my responses get odd if they send too soon possibly with a word or letter I never intended to press...I realize that these two concerns are for programming, and REALLY hope they issue updates that address both of these issues QUICKLY!  I would LOVE to use S-Voice and be able to tolerate it.  All of the other sounds on the phone are nice, soft sounds.  If they updated S-Voice and allowed users to set their own tones- it would be great!  I am confident that with use, it would recognize my commands more efficiently (I do like that Mymotospeak recognizes my commands with high level of accuracy).  And hopefully, when they resolve the keyboard issue- I will stop sending my sister bizarre nonsensical text messages (thank goodness it is only my sister).", "Date": "March 6, 2013"}, {"Title": "@pple Killer", "Author": "Honest Reviewer", "ReviewID": "RG5QQC6WZURIW", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Best phone I ever had! Install Swiftkey and let your fingers fly on the keyboard. My entire iphone fits into the screen of this beauty.

This phone is beautifully designed and very fast. I'm loving it!The glass that Samsung uses for their Galaxy phones is very strong. I never used a screen protector on my Galaxy S and it only had two minor scratches after over two years. I do not doubt that this screen will fare as well. They have added an oleophobic coating to cut down on fingerprints, it is somewhat successful as there are definitely fewer fingerprints but the screen does still get smudged quite often.The hardware inside is so much better than the Galaxy S, which was a strong phone. I can tell it has more processing power \"under the hood\" and the GPS is immensely better than the original Galaxy S's troubled GPS. I have no problem getting an accurate and consistent location with this phone.4G internet is amazing. In Columbia, SC I have tested it at 20Mbps, faster than my cable internet.There are a few things I do not like about the design of this phone, but they are relatively minor. First, the back is made of plastic and is not easy to remove. On the Samsung Captivate it was metal and had a nice mechanism to remove it and lock it in place. It felt so much more sturdy than this. That said, after over a month of using the phone with no case, there are only a few minor scratches to the back. However, with the old phone, after over 2 years of usage with no case there were only a couple of minor scratches that were caused by my carelessness in putting it into the same pocket as my keys one time.Another possible problem is that the screen itself is curved. This means that a) screen protectors will not stay on the screen well unless you use a case. It also means that if you aren't using a screen protector and place the phone face-down on a surface, the screen is in contact with the surface. With the Captivate there was a slight bezel around the screen that would prevent it from resting directly on a surface. However, if this screen is as strong as the old one, this shouldn't be a problem.A purely personal preference, I do not like having the USB connector and the headphone jack on opposite ends of the phone. If I have it plugged in charging and hooked up to a speaker I have wires coming out of both ends and this is hard to manage in a neat way. This may not bother some users.I was very disappointed, however, that this phone only has 16gb internal storage. The Galaxy S had 16gb storage, why didn't they bump it up to 32gb with this phone? Flash memory isn't that expensive these days. At least it has an external microSD slot.In summary, this is a great, powerful phone with a few slight design problems that may not cause you any issues. It's not the latest and greatest but the price with a contract cannot be beat. If you're looking to upgrade from a phone that is 2-3 years old, especially if you have used a previous Galaxy S version and enjoyed it, you should definitely check out the Galaxy S III.", "Date": "September 14, 2013"}, {"Title": "Love it", "Author": "jsmegkat", "ReviewID": "R11HXVC8P0HR75", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I love this phone.

The phone is nothing short of amazing, and fulfills everything one might expect from a cell phone, but a lot more, as well. It is now running Android 4.1.1 after an over-the-air update from AT&T; and I could not be happier. A few observations, in no particular order-(1) The processor seems lightening fast. Web sites load almost instantly, with ether the stock android browser or Chrome, which I use most often. Colors are rich but accurate, and scrolling is rapid and seamless, without hesitation or blur of any kind.(2) The phone can be customized in almost every way you can imagine. You have complete control over who can call or text, and when they can do so; the type of notifications you want or do not want from the apps you use; ringtones and text tones can be set for individual contacts, etc., etc. If you can perform a simple Google search, you can learn how to do anything the software s capable of, which is quite a lot. I had always been an iPhone user, with modest tech knowledge at best, but I picked up Android quickly. If you use Gmail notifications are always pushed, either with or without an audible alert. Two step sign-in verification is also readily available with the Google authenticator app. I use a number of apps on an almost  daily basis that are arranged on seven pages, and, like a great many folks, I would imagine, I have other apps that I use more infrequently. A large weather widget is in my home page, as well as toggle switches for settings, ring or vibrate, driving mode, and flight mode. Google calendar fills another page.(3) Things that could be improved- well, those who complain about being able to see the display in sunlight are correct, but I think that is a problem for all cell phones. Battery life seems comparable to the iPhone 4S my wife inherited from me- she loves her iPhone and is not interested in an Android OS, although she does like the Nexus 7 she got for Christmas. But, really, you can charge a cell phone from almost anywhere, from the included AC charger, from any USB ported computer, or any car with a functioning DC socket (cigarette lighter).  I recommended the Motorola Vehicle Power Adapter micro-USB Rapid Rate Charger, and if you're really concerned about battery life, you can pick up a spare battery, whch is easily changed by simply removing the back cover, as well as a charger for your spare. The OEM battery is Samsung Galaxy S3 Replacement Battery (2100 mAh) for AT&T;, Sprint & T-Mobile Models, and you can charge your spare battery with Samsung Galaxy SIII Battery Charger with USB Output, Exclusive Black And Green Color Key Chain Kit. I charged my spare and set it aside, because I just have not needed it. Today I switched my regular battery with the spare, which had been sitting on my dresser top, untouched, for at least a month, just to see how much charge it had retained- and was delighted to see 89%. The spare battery fits perfectly inside the clear plastic carrying case that was used to carry Gameboy game cartridges.(4) Security a concern? I have used Google Play Store without incident, but by all means, take advantage of free anti-virus software to protect your phone and data. I use Avast for virus/malware protection and a fantastic app called Cerebus (a British paid app, inexpensive, but worth every penny) for locating or locking or wiping a lost phone.(5) The stock Samsung keyboard is dreadful, and a serious drawback to the phone if not remedied. The best $3.99 I ever spent, and one of only two apps I have paid for so far, is Swiftkey. If you buy this phone, waste little time in using the Google play store to download and install Swiftkey. It is at least a thousand times better than the stock keyboard, and now predicts the next word I am going to type with amazing accuracy.(6) Did I mention the expandable memory- up to 32 GB?

The phone seems well built, but the industry-wide race for ever-lighter phone construction has its disadvantages.  I wouldn't use this or ANY other high-end phone without a sturdy case, such as an Otterbox.  I used Otterbox's \"Defender\" with my iPhone, and it not only survived numerous drops, it still looks brand new.The S3's basic functionality is very similar to the iPhone, and the very large screen size makes it a highly competitive alternative to the more expensive iPhone 5.  S3 display quality is bright and crisp, system response is rapid, and I've loaded a number of widely-used applications from Google Play without any issues.  The interface between my PC-based Outlook Calander and Contacts isn't quite as seamless as with iTunes, but I figured out how to make it work properly with a bit of online research.This phone has lots of capability that will take a while to fully learn and understand, and not everyone needs everything the S3 can do.  Learning takes time, and capability takes battery power no matter what device you're using.  Some complain when a bit of effort is required to understand, or that their battery doesn't last as long as they would like.  The same solution applies to whatever you buy; take the time to learn about your device and turn off the bells/whistles that you don't want or need!  Overall, the battery appears adequate, but will probably not last the fully advertised time when placed under heavy load.  Unlike the iPhone, the S3's design allows the user to EASILY swap out the battery, and replacements are inexpensive.I've not used it long, but it looks like a winner at first glance.  Time will tell if it has the build quality of my previous iPhone.  I own a number of different Samsung products, and have never been dissatisfied with any of them.", "Date": "November 24, 2012"}, {"Title": "Great device", "Author": "MikeW", "ReviewID": "R3V5C38LPA42WC", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I recently switched into an S3 from an iPhone 4S, and have to say I'm happy to have made the change.First, the cons. The phone feels pretty flimsy and fragile out of the box. The first time I opened the back to put my SIM card and battery in, I was half afraid the cover was going to snap in half. The battery adds some much needed weight and makes the back feel more solid as it isn't hollow once the battery is inside. That said, I still wish they had made it another millimeter thicker or went with a more durable material and I recommend investing in a decent case and would avoid opening up the back more often than is necessary.I also experienced some problems getting the phone to re-connect to saved wifi networks both at home and at my business. It would often give an error claiming poor signal strength even if the phone was sitting next to the router and showed a very strong signal. A Google search told me I wasn't the only person having this problem. Apparently the phone doesn't completely support WPA2 encryption. Changing my network security to WPA mostly fixed the problem, but I still occasionally have to turn off and restart the router to get the phone to connect to the network.The positives include just about everything else. Hardware wise the phone is very solid. The display isn't quite as good as the HTC One X, but very good nonetheless. The processor is very fast as is the LTE internet if you're lucky enough to live in an LTE market. Even away from LTE though the HSPA+ backhaul network is pretty fast. The signal isn't quite as good as my iPhone, as I have no signal or 1 bar where I previously had 2-3 bars. I live out in the sticks though and always have 4-5 bars in town. When I do have a signal it seems very reliable. Have only had 1 dropped call so far and that was in an area where AT&T; is pretty notorious for dropping calls, while previously I had them on a pretty regular basis no matter where I was.I also really like the removable battery and the expandable memory, a feature that the current flagship smartphones from Apple and HTC lack. I'm quite careful with my phones so the battery is often the first component to fail so I like knowing that I can replace it easily if I need to. It is worth noting however that the S3 currently does not allow you to store apps or app data to the micro SD card- they must be saved on the internal memory which makes me wish that there was a 32 GB version of the phone available in the US like there is internationally. I didn't realize this when I bought a 64 GB micro SD card. I probably would have gone with a smaller, cheaper 16 or 32 GB card had I known. I hope this changes when Jelly Bean rolls out.Add in the fact that Android is the best mobile OS available and its tough to make an argument to buy anything else. Plus Samsung gets bonus points for their amazing marketing campaign centered around the S3.", "Date": "October 4, 2012"}, {"Title": "Incredible phone", "Author": "M.G.D \"M.G.D\"", "ReviewID": "RNBFXBWQLWPUQ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I have to start by pointing out that I love technology and as such I like to try everything and rate everything based on usability, design, performance and comfort. That being said, the Samsung Galaxy S3 is a power to be reckoned with. The display is excellent, maybe not as good as the iphone 5 but it's not much behind and in reality, screen resolution on a cell phone is not that important. The phone's speed is also astonishing, more than most will ever need- I can't really comment on gaming performance as I really only play video games on consoles- and with day-to-day use the phone never lags or crashes, even without killing running apps.I've read on many forums that people think the phone feels cheap, especially when compared to the iphone which in my opinion is false. The phone is made of plastic but it doesn't feel cheap, rather, it feels light for a device its size. However, this is my opinion and each is entitled to their own.Overall, I think this phone is excellent; the design is beautiful, the processing speed is top tier, and Android is a great platform (especially because it's based on linux). I highly recommend this phone to anybody wanting a phone with a screen that can be used to surf the web and any techie wanting to use a platform that is both user friendly and open for tweaks.", "Date": "September 27, 2012"}, {"Title": "Love This Phone", "Author": "K.

Smaller than the Note and larger than the iPhone 4S (although I understand the iPhone 5 will be larger).  Great screen and fast speed.  I have used a Galaxy Tablet for a while and love it, so I adapted quickly to the phone (I also use a Blackberry Torch which I also love but the screen is small and of course it doesn't have the apps Android does).The only thing I didn't like was it's reliance on Gmail.  Now, I have Gmail and like Google products, but it did some weird stuff when syncing my contacts (which I had the salesman do at the store).  I use Outlook as my main contact source, and it pulled the contacts in, but also pulled all kinds of stuff from my Gmail account I didn't want.  And many duplicates.  So I cleaned it up and am working with Kies, which is their sync system.  So far I'm not impressed.  It isn't as good as Blackberry, IMO.  So I'll have to see how that goes.Otherwise, I love the phone.  I got blue because it's my favorite, and I got the case that has a book-like cover.  It still keeps the phone slim and very safe.  Oh, and I like the front facing camera.I just got it a few days ago, so I haven't used a lot of the features, like voice recognition and data transfer.  I'll update later.  But I'd have to say this is the closest phone I've had that can really replace my camera and maybe my tablet.

It was either this or the HTC One X.  I've always had HTC phones and have loved them.  I like their design, the materials they use, and the great features they sport.  So I would've gotten the One X except for two very big cons: no removable battery and no MicroSD slot.  Not sure what HTC was thinking, but they definitely dropped the ball with the One X.Now on to the Galaxy S3.  What else can I add that hasn't already been said in all the reviews here on Amazon and all the other web sites?  Beautiful display, fast processor, removable battery/memory card, great camera for photos and HD video, etc., etc., etc.So I'll just detail the cons that may seem minor, but could be deal-breakers for some people:--> Crappy battery life: Compared to my old phone, the Inspire 4G, this phone sucks battery life approximately 25% faster.  Obviously, if you only use your phone for calls, then this might not be a big deal.  But if you're like the other 99% people out there, then you're gonna be playing games, surfing the web, on Facebook, etc.  This phone won't get 10-11 hours without consciously saving the battery for most people.  I highly recommend buying spare batteries.--> Small \"Home\" button:  This may be just personal preference, but I seem to have some trouble hitting this button consistently.  I like something like the iPhone \"home\" button or closer to it in size.--> \"Plasticky\" feel:  I've never liked the feel of Samsung phones because of the seemingly cheap, soft, plastic they use, especially the back cover.  This might be personal taste again, but if you've held a HTC phone and a Samsung Galaxy phone, you'll know what I mean.I don't regret getting this phone, but it does have its flaws.

I was sickto death of the restrictive iOS and iTunes, so after demo'ing this S3 it was a no brainer.At first I found Google Ice Cream Sandwich a little frustrating, but I was complicating a verysimple straightforward operating system. Once I stopped thinking so much I found it veryintuitive. And its a joy to be able to connect your phone to your laptop and have Windowsread it just like any other hard drive while its charging. My only complaint about the OS areall the apps that start automatically and are eating resources in the background, they haveto be turned off manually, there is no free app that will accommodate an auto-lock of theseapps unfortunately. But with 2G of memory you can live with it.The screen is astonishingly crisp at 720p, and the color balance is perfect. Its well suitedfor playing games or watching movies in your down time, and there is zero lag. The Zeitlupemedia player app makes this a real treat when watching your favorite entertainment.The resident TouchWiz launcher is terrific, its easy to learn and use, and is very smooth whenopening folders and apps. However, you may want to experiment with other launchers like Apex,Go, and Nova Prime which is the one I finally landed on and its fantastic and ultra customizable.I spent over 20 years in the electronics design and manufacturing business, and this is my favoritetoy of all time. I never thought I would see so much technology integrated into such a small andreliable device. And if you're wondering if a 64G Micro SD card will work with this phone...it does,and the two SD cards I used were plug and play, and neither was a Samsung branded card.And with any of these new smartphones, most of the complaints are about battery time. The display isa real power hog so as with an S3/S4 the back case pops right off and the battery interchange takesabout 15 seconds, a big plus.

Moreover, it made me realize how overrated Iphones were considering my old DroidIncredible had more capabilities than the 4S [tethering, an open system so I could customize however I liked (like having a win 7 interface which I found more attractive than the stock Android UI), turn-by-turn navigation, easy google syncing, etc].After a couple of weeks of being annoyed with the iPhone, I exchanged it for Samsung's GS3.  I must say, it's a match made in heaven--I'm in love with this phone! I got the S3 in brown (it's like a rich chocolate color with a copperish trim), which I think is the most attractive out of the bunch...it's gotten compliments in fact. There is very little I can't do with this phone, and when I think it can't, I tinker a bit and realize it can (i.e. I love the search buttons on the older model Androids, which the S3 doesn't have, but double tapping the menu button on S3 brings up the search functions.) The front facing camera could use some work, but I'm sure that's for all types of phones, but other than that really no complaints! It's lightning fast, handles multiple operations well, the screen is amazeballs--like my eyes had adjusted so much to the size and quality of the S3 that I literally felt like my DINC was miniature after using it for a couple of operations. Svoice could use work. Siri was a lot of fun to play with. But, I honestly rarely used Siri for anything meaningful. Mostly just to see what kind of witty responses she'd offer up.

I've had more 4G coverage on the ATT network in one week than I had on Sprint for 2 years.Beautiful camera with loads of options.

Also, NFC and S Beam for sharing.There are some cons- while options to customize the phone are all available, you have to hunt for them.Address and contact management is lacking slightly. On the EVO 4g, you could start typing contact info on phone keypad. On the S3, you have to use the contacts tab, and search for the name.As with all smartphones, battery life is good but not great. 8+ hrs I use an expanded battery to overcome.

This is the first smartphone that I feel has hit all the right marks.1) Super thin - I have always wanted my phones to be thinner, this is the first one that I think is perfectly thin. I honestly think going thinner would make the phone too difficult to easily hold properly.2) Super fast - responds instantaneously, enough said.3) Super stable - my previous phone was a Motorola Atrix and it would reboot spontaneously several times a week. I have yet to see it happen with this phone. I also use a microcell and the Atrix would lose the ability to connect to it and I would have to reboot it. Not a problem with this phone.4) Great feel - before actually seeing the new phones in person, I had read about the HTC One X and how awesome the build quality was with its polycarbonate case. When my wife and I went to the store and saw it, we both were struck by how ugly it is. And I find the polycarbonate case cold and hard. The Galaxy SIII just feels smooth and rich, those are the best words I can use to describe it. And the design is beautiful.5) Beautiful screen - bright and detailedIf I had to choose a few nits, they would be:1) Battery life - honestly it's not bad at all for a 4G phone with this much horsepower and the huge screen. But we always want better battery life. At least the battery is swappable - a big reason I chose this phone over the competition.2) A little too much AT&T; crud comes preloaded on it. I hate that. There is a lot of Samsung stuff as well, but some of it is actually useful.3) Finally, while I think this phone has finally reached the perfect thinness, I think they have gone just a tad too far with the screen size, it is just a little large.

I absolutely love the size of the display and it is perfect for my large hands and my thumb texting, which leaves much to be desired.  I appreciate the fact that it has the native ability to place apps into folders; a feature that has been sadly lacking for many iterations of the Android OS.  The signal is fantastic, the speech quality is flawless and the noise reduction is suberb.  Earpiece volume and quality is excellent, as well.  On AT&T; (my network), the LTE is lightning fast!  The battery life is excellent for a phone of this type (especially given the LTE chipset).  Navigation is superb on this phone and I absolutely never use my Garmin (I never need it and this is more user-friendly, especially the Google Navigator.).  When set into wi-fi mode, it automatically uses wi-fi for data and uses the cellular network for voice (never tries to use the cellular network for downloading data).  Great native email app (finally!) that actually works with Yahoo email!  Flashing notification LED!  Finally!  MINOR GRIPES: Speakerphone location makes audio muffled when placed on a flat surface face up; there should have been a way to design a small groove, or series of grooves for audio output.  A simple, but important oversight.  I wish there was a way to change the spacing of icons on the screens; the user could fit more icons on one screen.  I have not found a way to do that.  I have also not been able to find a way to make the notification LED flash in different colors for different things (even though it is a RGB LED).  Screen navigation speed is fast, but could be faster.  No way to integrate Yahoo Calendar.  The native keyboard is good, but I am using the A.I. Slider keyboard app in iphone mode (never a better keyboard made, in my opinion) and it is now perfect!  Native email app, while excellent, appears to only increment the screen icon when it actually syncs.  It was not initially clear to me that I could set the sync frequency to daily and Yahoo email would still be in (virtually) push mode until I tried it (sync interval only appears to affect the incrementation of the on-screen icon).  (Gmail, of course, is truly instantaneous, as always).  I spent a long time figuring that one out.  Major battery rundown while using Google Navigator!  Phone gets very warm during hard data usage (again, using Google navigator)  Display is still dim in sunlight (even when maxed out) and could be higher resolution.  I wish Samsung would stop using AMOLED displays; I really do.  I just don't think they will ever measure up to LCD-type displays.  Major gripe: Annoying beep on dialing!  I hate that!  Samsung, get with the program and provide a way for us to remove that without having to root an otherwise-perfect phone!  It makes the phone sound tinny, cheap and toylike.  Would I buy another one?  Absolutely!  Nothing is perfect.  Would, and do I, recommend them to friends and associates?  Absolutely!  All in all, finally, the phone that beat the iphone!

Even when the Galaxy II came out, I knew there would be the III with Ice Cream Sandwich, and had decided to wait for it.

Even though I had \"issues\" after the second OTA firmware update to my Captivate, and was constantly having to reboot, etc., the phone still performed so well that I never doubted Samsung would come through with the perfect phone.  I am also a firm Android person since the beginning.  So don't ask me to compare it to the iPhone anything, because I just don't know.

Chen \"XReflection.X13\"", "ReviewID": "RL4X36EFBHS4Y", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "The Galaxy SIII is Samsung's newest Flagship phone.  It sports a 4.8\" HD Super AMOLED screen, a Snapdragon S4 Dual Core processor clocked in at 1.5GHz with 2GB of RAM (the largest amount of RAM you will find on any smartphone today), an 8.0MP back camera and a 1.9MP front facing camera.  The phone runs Android Ice Cream Sandwich 4.0.4 and has a microSD card slot and uses a micro sim for phone service.Overall, this phone is great.  It's snappy, the interface is smooth and Samsung has done some nice things with its Touchwiz overlay on the stock Android ICS experience.  The screen is vibrant with a 720p resolution and its very easy to read text on the screen.  The phone is pretty thin, and although the screen is huge, it doesn't feel too awkward to hold.  The speaker is located on the back of the phone and is okay for listening to music and audio, but obviously headphones will be superior.  The camera is very good, with burst shot function, autofocus and an LED flash.  The front camera is more than good enough for video conferencing on applications like skype.  Samsung brings some interesting features with their gesture system (you can stop/play video with your hand, tilt the phone to automatically answer calls etc..) and S-Voice (their answer to Siri)But this phone is far from perfect.  Samsung really takes too much out of Apple's book for styling for some of the features.  Of note, S-voice is terrible.  Upon entering the application, you can tell they were trying to copy Siri.  The layout is similar, but S-Voice lacks accuracy and intelligence.  Simply put, its unreliable.  An example is for math: Ask it what the sqrt(9) is and it returns 1.41 (another time it returned 2).  If the app can't do something as simple as that, why even bother?  Coming from a Galaxy Nexus running Jelly Bean 4.1, I have ot say that Google Now is far superior to both S-Voice and Siri.Other aspects of the S3 that I dislike are the physical home button, lack of a previous apps button, and the sound effects in the touchwiz overlay.  For the home button, pushing it down isn't as easy and I miss being able to lightly tap a capacitive button or on screen soft key to go to the homescreen or exit out of an app.  It's a severe oversight and you can tell Samsung is trying to take cues from the iPhone (STOP IT SAMSUNG, PLEASE).  Samsung also chose to ignore the fact that ICS no longer makes use of a menu button, but instead uses a previous apps button to access the task manager and such.  I hate having to hold down the home button to access previous apps.  Lastly, the sound effects in Touchwiz are annoying.  Samsung was going for a \"nature\" theme with touchwiz, and while overall I like it (the unlock screen is very cool), the sound of water dropping is irritating after a while.  Why couldn't they just keep the normal click sound in stock ICS?  Additionally, I dislike how Touchwiz still bases its physical appearance on gingerbread.  Get with the times, Samsung!Sound quality on calls is very good both for listening and speaking.  Another thing to keep in mind is that AT&T; has not enabled used of Google Wallet.  This is a real bummer.Pros:- 720p resolution- Stunning screen- 2100 mAh battery (battery life is pretty good, much better than the Galaxy Nexus)- 4G LTE- Good build quality- Fast performance- Despite its size, feels like in the hand- Good call qualityCons:- S-voice (very gimicky)- Too many cues from Apple's iphone- Touchwiz overlay- Physical home button- No google wallet support (yet)- Probably will take ages for S3 to get Jelly Bean- It is a big phone, so for many it may be a big turn off-Alot of my gripes are in part influenced by my experience with the Galaxy Nexus.  Stock Jelly Bean offers many of the features that Samsung is trying to incorporate into their touchwiz/galaxy series, but it does it leaps and bounds better.  If the Nexus had a better screen, larger stock battery and better processor, I would have kept the Nexus.  Even with those shortfalls, I'm considering switching back to the Nexus for my daily use phone.But if you were to evaluate the S3 on its own, it is definitely a phone worthy of the flagship title, but there are many kinks and glitches that really need to be worked out before it can be considered great.", "Date": "July 10, 2012"}, {"Title": "Best smartphone", "Author": "AK529", "ReviewID": "RL0QUSZBYRKVM", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I am really glad I got this phone. At the moment this is the best smartphone on the market. In my opinion this phone is better than its competing iPhone 5 or HTC one x. The HTC one x and iphone 5 do not offer a removable battery or upgrade memory card like this one does. The HTC one x is also much more bulkier, heavier and doesn't fit as good in the hand as this phone does. The s3 also has 2gb of ram which the HTC one x and iPhone 5 have only 1gb of ram. I tried the s2 when it first came out last year and there were a few things I just didn't like about it. Samsung has improved a lot with hardware and software this time with the s3. The s3 has a led notification light which the previous s2 never had. The iPhone 5 also doesn't have the led notifications. The s3 is very light, thin and fits very nicely in the hand. There have been many improvements to the touch wiz interface to make it more user friendly and very similar to HTC's sense interface. The phone part works great.  Whether making calls using the ear piece, speaker phone or headset the sound is loud and clear. The audio quality for music, videos and games is also very good quality and loud for the speaker or headphones. I especially liked using the included ear phones for making calls or listening to music. They remind me of apples older earbuds not the newer ear pods as I have not tried them. The Samsung earphones have lots of bass, good sound isolation and have a built in remote with volume, play, pause and next/previous track controls. Battery life is good for a phone this size and this advanced. The battery is larger than both the HTC one x and the iPhone 5. I can get about 11 hours of continuous talk time. If I'm on wifi with light to medium use I can get about 24 hours. If I'm on LTE I can get about 12-16 hours of light to medium use. The screen on this phone is beautiful it's very vibrant and great to use. I do find the screen to be not as bright as my previous phone (HTC sensation). I especially notice this on a very bright sunny day outside. The screen is still readable just not as bright as it used to be.I have experienced some wifi issues with the phone. I'm on my second phone which has the same issue. Wifi is not as stable, disconnects once in a while and not as fast, the signal also seems to vary without me moving the phone.  I hope this issue is fixed With the upcoming jelly bean update. Others on xda forums have also reported similar wifi issues. I also miss some of the sense features from my HTC sensation. Features like missed call preview in the lock screen, text message preview in the lock screen and the calendar agenda widget. I also preferred the stock email app on the HTC. I don't like the touch wiz email stock app. It doesn't load emails in the HTML format automatically. When viewing an email you have scroll to the bottom and then click on load more to get in HTML format.  Other than a few touch wiz interface features the phone is a pleasure to use and own. I plan on rooting my phone soon once jelly bean is officially released and install the cm10 custom rom. I will update review once I have updated to jellybean and rooted my phone.

They stopped both.Then my money order supposedly never got to them.It was both too costly and involved to stop payment on the money order.I sent a second money order.The day I mailed the 2nd money order they sent me a letter, after their collections department had reported me to the credit bureaus, they, AT&T; wanted me back??I repeatedly asked them how they could be endlessly conflicting in their spoken statements and how could they solve more complex problems?If they offered free phones and lifetime free service I would be fearful of accepting it.

The breadth of apps is amazing, and many of them are free.  (Note: not all smartphones are compatible with Play Store so checking this first is recommended.)I had quite a few contacts on my BB that I did not want to type in again.  I found that I could export them to a CSV file with my BB Desktop Manager and then use a shareware program to convert the CSV to a VCF file for import into the Samsung.  Since both of theses file fomats are easy to work with I could easily edit them before the final import into the Samsung.I would recommend ordering a case with the phone.

I've had it for a week now and I'm really liking it.Pros: 1) Good screen size. Easy to see things, plenty of room for text when you want to read stuff, apps show up well, etc. I know there are bigger screens out there, but this is a great size for most things. 2) Lightweight and thin, very portable and hardly any weight in my pocket. (I tend to wear skirts with pockets, so anything dragging down too much is a big minus, like my last phone.) 3) Awesome memory and storage. Had so many issues with my last phone, had to delete things constantly; no problems here. 16G is plenty of room to toss a few apps, games and music on there, and no worries about any of them crashing due to lack of memory. 4) Responsive touch screen without being overly so. 5) Good sound. It's on the back, but even so it's nice and clear.Like I said though, it's not perfect. I have a few issues with it, a couple more important than others.Cons: 1) Heat issue. This is a biggie since I play a lot of games. Have anything open for too long and the phone becomes noticeably warm to the touch. Right now it's not as big of an issue; it being summer, I'm just holding it up into the air conditioning for a few seconds and it cools off nicely. Come winter, however, short of tossing it out in a snowbank for a minute or two, I'll have to come up with something else. This is worrying me even more since I've ordered a case for the phone and that will cut off any ventilation it's getting right now. 2) Short battery life. Again, I game and run a lot of apps, and the battery drains like water from a sieve. I have it plugged in to recharge five or six times a day, if not more. The life of the battery itself isn't going to be long at this rate. Hopefully the next battery I get will last longer, but I have my doubts. 3) The controls, specifically the power and \"back\" (reverse arrow at the bottom of the phone) are situated for right-handed people. I'm a lefty when it comes to phones and for me and anyone else like me, it's not very convenient. Nitpicky, maybe, but it's a an annoyance for all that it's minor. 4) There seems to be no convenient way of exiting browsers, the app store, etc. No way to get back to the main screen short of hitting the back button until everything closes, which sucks if you're in the middle of a page on the web and don't want to navigate away from it.Overall I still think it's a great phone. I can live with the issues, can probably even find a workaround for a couple of them.

Allshouse", "ReviewID": "R3E8JHNJG3BCJR", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "The Galaxy S III seems to be the new \"Jesus phone.\" It received such pre-release hype that some tech reviewers, even after noting the defects in the device, heaped upon it rave reviews. In reality, the S III has enough problems that it  almost single-handedly lends credence to those inane Microsoft commercials claiming that Android phones are beta devices. While it seems likely that Samsung could fix a lot of these problems with a good software upgrade; there is no guarantee that this will happen, given their propensity for denying the existence of problems and moving slowly (if at all) to fix them.Let's start with the screen. While the screen is large, it's also very dim. Apparently Samsung felt the best way to increase battery power on this 4.8 inch phone was to cut the brightness by about half that of other phones. And, I'm not talking about the semi-dark default brightness that can be adjusted by the user, nor am I talking about the silly separate brightness setting assigned to the browser. No, I'm talking about the full on brightness level that is nearly impossible to view outdoors in medium daylight. I guess Samsung figures users won't run the battery down too fast if they can't see the phone's screen. Frankly, I'd rather be able to view the phone comfortably and carry an extra battery in my pocket.Another feature hobbled by Samsung's desperate attempt to conserve battery life is Wifi. Even in the same room with my router, I found the Wifi signal weak and intermittent. After a bit of research on the issue, I learned that Samsung had applied a \"power saver\" setting to the Wifi, one that can only be accessed and turned off by dialing a special MMI code on the dialer. Adding insult to injury, this fix has to be re-applied after every reboot of the phone.The S III's camera has been widely touted by the tech media, and it's a nice camera. Still photos look about as good as you can expect for a mobile phone camera. However, the video camera's auto focus seems overworked when shooting objects in motion. This causes intermittent blurring to occur in video shot with the phone, almost like the camera is constantly zooming in and out. To their credit, Engadget briefly mentioned this in their review. Everyone else seems to have either failed to actually test the video camera or ignored the issue.Another camera-related feature that fails miserably is Smart Stay. The camera is supposed to use facial recognition to determine if you are still looking at the phone. If you are, it is supposed to delay dimming the screen, and then putting the device into sleep mode, for as long as you are looking at it. The feature fails to work about 90% of the time. Again, this may be something that can be improved with a software update. Unfortunately, the person I talked to at Samsung refused to acknowledge the issue in spite of it being widely reported by users and reviewers.Finally, there's S-Voice, Samsung's answer to Apple's Siri. S-Voice is just plain dumb. I asked S-Voice, \"What is the square root of nine.\" It acknowledged that it understood the question, and then provided me with the square root of four. I repeated the question. S-Voice again displayed a correct understanding of the question and gave the same wrong answer. Forget the fact that S-Voice's voice recognition often fails to understand users; even when it does, it gets the answers wrong.Yes, the Galaxy S III has a large and attractive screen. Yes, it has a reasonably powerful processor. And yes, Samsung has backed off enough from Touch Wiz that it doesn't completely ruin the user experience of the phone. However, there are way too many hardware shortcomings and half-baked software features to call this a great phone. The Galaxy S III does not live up to the pre-release hype and you should carefully consider if it is worth the monetary investment and two-year commitment that AT&T; and other carriers require.", "Date": "July 22, 2012"}, {"Title": "Finally interesting phone!!!", "Author": "Y.

Novelty of iPhone 4 wore off just after few months after seeing that similar apps finally arrived for Android phones. iPhone 4 quickly became boring and craving for constantly changing Android OS and more customizable features available.After playing with boring iPhone until Galaxy S3 arrived, I now feel that this is what smartphone should be. It's so amazing how this machine changed my life. Not a big fan of using camera, but I love to take picture with this GS3. Internet is super fast. I tether internet through PDAnet app with my laptop, WOW, internet speed is amazing on 4G LTE. Plastic cover feels a little cheap, but much better than non-removable cover of iPhone. I have several extra batteries, they last long time on the go. I always on the go with client to client with lots of phone calls, with 2 extra batteries, it lasts two full days of heavy calls, internet, photo, apps, etc. Amazing battery life on this GS3 is very hard to beat.Screen is amazingly beautiful. I just wonder how below reviewer rated so low on this phone. They are maybe an employee of one of the competitors to attempt to destroy sales. I think as long as people see the full potential of this phone, people will love this phone.After boring iphone experience, I don't believe that I will go back to iphone ever. Also, I was told that GS3 will be upgraded to a new Android OS later this year. COOL!!! Android OS is much more interesting than boring apple OS.

Samsung's Kies software syncs my contacts, but not the calendar. Their support could not solve the errors and recommended to detour my Outlook data through Google calendar. This fix would only get my Outlook data onto the Galaxy S3. However, if I create an event on the phone, it wouldn't sync back to Outlook. People may have differing opinions about Outlook.

It slips from the hands at times during regular use. I have to order a different case that has high grip, after noticing this.* Brightness - Brightness level is not centrally controlled. You'll have to adjust the brightness individually for browser, and all other apps.For Videos, the brightness adjustment is not available and the videos look very dull while playing.* Browser Web Pages - It pulls up the regular web pages on majority of the web sites (even though the websites have mobile pages); rather than pulling the Mobile web pages (for easy readability). So we need to zoom, move the screen right or left to read the text on majority of the web pages.* Memory card slot under the back cover - It would have been great if the memory card slot was provided on the side of the phone.
