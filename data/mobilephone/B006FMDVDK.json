No scratches, dents or dings. Also came with the box and all the accessories just as if I had bought from Apple. So that was awesome and the reason it got two stars instead of one. However, this phone was advertised as a factory unlocked iphone and it was not. It was still locked to AT&T.; It also came with a Gevey chip for unlocking the phone. (Which, had I put 2 and 2 together, I should have realized you would not need a Gevey chip if the phone was already factory unlocked.) And to top it off, the Gevey chip didn't work. So right now I have a call into AT&T;, hoping they will unlock it for me. (Finger crossed!) So if you plan on buying an iPhone 4S from this seller, realize you are getting a carried locked phone and the only two ways to unlock an iPhone 4S right now are either with the Gevey chip (if you get a working one) or if you can get AT&T; to unlock it for you.", "Date": "June 23, 2012"}, {"Title": "The phone  is white, used and locked.

She received it as a new black and unlocked. She has sent it for an apple store to insert her card. They told her that this phone had a box for a black one but it is while and it is used as it was blocked by a Bell Canada mobile company. Not to mention that my gift was a total fraud, my mother sent it for a communication company and she was informed that she has to pay an extra $150 to unlock it. Finally on November 26th at our thanksgiving party when she didn't have the iphone 4s. She told me the new the gift is not working. I was sad to have to go through all this. I paid $505 just to get useless phone. Now the buyer is playing games with me since NOv. 26 when I shared with the seller my concerns. I have sent the phone by USPS and the buyer refused to sign for it and rejected receiving it. Now I am trying still hoping that the buyer is busy or confused but she all the good intention. I used amazon many times. I trusted them so I still hope that I will have my money back. It is only the product is useless. I don't know how could I have prevented this of happening. The product is a stolen item or used one. How can you break the trust in online shopping. How can we trust this anymore????

SIRI is unbelievable (and i mean it! My primary language is portuguese and she understand me perfectly, even when i force my accent).IOS x Android = never going back to android. IOS is far more intuitive and easy to operate. i couldn't get the wireless to work it self out whenever I were close to a hotspot on the android, for IOS its automatic. mail viewing and message thread is a lot easier on iOS  and the app store carries a much larger variety of items than the market does. iOS (at least so far, in my 3-4 years of experience with it) is safer, since i was recommended to get at least one antivirus for the galaxy s.though i think the battery lasts a little less than it should,  i can still get about 2 days of use, unless i talk to SIRI a lot, then it would last for one day no problem.the screen could be a little bigger, but i haven't resent going from a 4\"to a 3.5\"...cons: lens break very easily, so a case or bumper is a need. the antenna seems to have some issues still, but nothing that a good old bumper wouldn't solve.well. this is my review. i strongly recommend this phone", "Date": "January 4, 2012"}, {"Title": "Near perfect...", "Author": "Nse Ette", "ReviewID": "R39VCCXGUF2JMN", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "This is the best iPhone yet. The design (same as with iPhone 4) is sleek and eye catching (everyone will want to touch it), and screen resolution is fantastic, with images clear and crisp. Sound quality is great; volume and ring tone are very loud. A quick swipe from the top to the bottom of the screen gives you a summary (of weather, news, reminders, etc) at a glance. As the phone is unlocked, you can swap sim cards with ease and use in any country, well almost (more on that at the end of my review).Siri (the robot assistant) is rather good and intuitive, and can do anything from searching through your phone (or the web), to telling you what the weather will be wherever you are (using the location application). I like how she/he learns your name and uses it in communication. You can even use Siri to set location-based reminders, e.g. \"Remind me to call Dad when I get home\" or \"Remind me to stop at the store when I leave here\". Of course the location application should be on. Text (in SMSs, emails, notes, webpages, etc) can also be read out to you, and you can also dictate these. Pity you don't get voice commands with the Maps.The 8MP camera takes decent photos; you can take photos with flash, or HDR (which takes two shots with different exposures for you to select from or keep), and you can switch to the front-facing camera which also serves as a video cam. It utilizes face recognition technology, or you can tap on the image you want to focus on the screen. You can edit images in your photo albums (rotate, crop, remove red-eye, etc).The iPod gets a light tweaking; video and audio are separated (just like with the iPod Touch), and I like that the audio player shows album details like year of release and duration of album. There is iMessenger, like BlackBerry messenger for iPhones, as well as Facetime which allows you to make video calls.My two gripes are poor battery life (barely half a day if you browse a bit), and the fact that it requires a micro SIM, meaning you have to snip away at your regular sized SIM if you must use it.

I read them the serial-IMEI number.  They then informed me that this phone was actually not unlocked.  Upon looking at my order receipt it clearly states that when you update to IOS 6 the phone is not unlocked if updated via apple server and it will turn into a \"brick\".  Right there on the receipt after the \"factory unlocked, sealed box\" stuff.  Apple said that was another indicator that it wasn't factory unlocked.

Like the iPhone 4, which sparked a class-action lawsuit over its poor wi-fi antenna, the iPhone 4S is dogged by thousands of blog postings and reviews all over the internet that expose a serious problem with its wi-fi abilities.  The 4S is really a small computer, with Apple's endless offering of apps and very good voice control via Siri, but all of that causes massive data usage.  Unless you have an unlimited plan, you really need to use wi-fi as much as possible to avoid overages.  Perhaps even more important, the phone is much slower in 3G or 4G than on wi-fi, and you can't update the operating system unless the phone can access wi-fi for the massive download (unless you hook the 4S up to a computer, but then the update often fails multiple times before completing, causing hours of lost time).Despite Apple's reputation for innovative products, they also have a well-deserved reputation for ignoring these types of problems.  Despite all the blog entries in their own forums, Apple hasn't acknowledged this problem or offered any solutions (other than buying yet another phone, of course).Having used the 4S for over a year, I can say that it WAS a big step forward from my previous phone, but if I had known about the wi-fi issues, I would have bought something else.

Not a smart phone.", "Author": "J. Griffiths", "ReviewID": "R2FWDMWPYV67FR", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "I've owned smart phones before they were called smart phones. If this phone and others like it were called entertainment phones I would rate it much higher. As a practical business phone it's very lacking in it's control, management, and ability to classify it's data. I have yet to find an app that will easily put contacts in groups with their associated business or profession. In example, lets say you were referred to a doctor by your GP a number of years back, one of many and you can't remember his name. With the older smart phones you would just pull down the classified group list and select medical and you would have a list doctors with what you specified as their specialty. The current smart phones don't have that kind of ability to create classifications. So you have to scroll through your entire contact list and select each person with a Dr in front of his name (oh and you better remember the doctors first name to because that's how it list everyone and every thing--from the \"First Name\" line!), then select one, read the note regarding their field of work (over and over until you find the doctor your looking for). I have looked at many apps to try and find one as good as the stock contact list that my old palm treo had and so far there's only one. But it's way over complex for what should be a simple task. Apple's \"Note\" on the IPhone has the same problems. Once again I did find an app that would do, but it's ability to create and classify the notes requires a lot more effort then the palm stock program called Memo. I would go back to using my old Palm Treo but it's been dropped one to many times and now it resets it's self 3 or 4 times a day and I loose the reminders that I have yet to deal with. I choose the IPhone 4S over the Android phone because of their reputation for only allowing apps to be sold after their tested and approval by Apple. After looking for the above mentioned apps I noticed quit a few apps with bug fixes and low customer ratings. So much for that reputation. Another reason I choose apple is because of the customer raves about SIRI. I thought that would work better for voice dialing. Not so. SIRI has some strange problems. It will recognize and repeat what I say and then say it cant find it in my contacts list. Then it instead goes off looking for it online and comes back with other businesses with the same name but it won't be the business I'm looking for. And even though SIRI knows where I'm located by stating that the business is 49 mile from my current location. I may be only 2 miles from the business I'm trying to call. I contacted Apple about this and was told their aware of this problem. So, so much for that plus. I'd return the phone and get a blackberry but with their stock plunging do to their lack of going with the flow of current smart phones I would just end up in the same boat. The problem here is that the smart phone business that once was primarily for business users has now become one of the latest rage of the average public user who the mfg.s think only cares about using the phones for games, video entertainment, and texting. So even though it would be easy to incorporate the features I am missing from my palm the mfg.s just go with the flow and so does the market.", "Date": "October 26, 2012"}, {"Title": "Defective Phone", "Author": "KING", "ReviewID": "R2MUSX91HASNXT", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "IPhone which I'd received was defective and reboots by itself every 15 min ..
