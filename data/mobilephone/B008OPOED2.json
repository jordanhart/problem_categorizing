The screen gives a great, clear picture. the audio is clear and loud and feels as if you were in a movie almost. the camera takes wonderful pictures, as sharp as any $200 camera would do. not to mention all of the apps and other many conveniences such as just being pretty much everything you can want in a little device that you can take with you to the store, to exercise, to run errands, get directions, Skype, etc...It's light, it fits in my hand, it's easy to set up. the only thing that's a little disappointing is the battery life. for a phone that can do everything, it doesn't last long once you start doing everything on it.This seller seems reputable as the phone they sent me looks exactly as pictured and is exactly as described. it was unlocked and worked.", "Date": "March 11, 2014"}, {"Title": "IGUAL QUE EL SAMSUNG GALAXY S3 X u$s100.MENOS", "Author": "PINGUI", "ReviewID": "R2TEHCRMI3NUAA", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "HOLA, Si como pude comprobarlo despues de Un mes de USO.-Ambos equipos son similares...... a saber: HTC ONE X - a)Mejor Agarre el Formato se presta para ser sostenido en la mano.-  b) El display es m\u00e1s pr\u00e1ctico y Ya Caracter\u00edstico de HTC.-  c) Es m\u00e1s consistente la carcaza...Y en general por su dise\u00f1o  Desventaja.....NO POSEE MICRO SD.....!
