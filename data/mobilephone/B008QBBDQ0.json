{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Incredible Phone!", "Author": "Book Worm", "ReviewID": "R2NXUBFLFCJ03A", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I recently upgraded to the Motorola XT890 RAZR after going through three Blackberry phones in five years. I have had this new phone for two weeks now and it has absolutely surpassed my expectations in every aspect.This phone is the international unlocked version of the current Motorola RAZR M, which is only carried by Verizon in the US. However, the Razr i works with GSM carriers (i.e. T-mobile and AT&T;). Works with micro-SIM card. With T-mobile in the US, it runs on 3G when not on WiFi. Not sure about 4G yet, but definitely not 4G LTE compatible per Motorola specifications. I was a bit skeptical to purchase such an expensive unlocked product online and not really knowing for sure if it would have glitches or function properly in the US, but I'm so glad I took the risk.A few highlights/reviews on various features:CALLS: crystal clear reception on both ends and great speaker phone, even on the road. The rings tones are nice and pleasant.TEXTING: SWYPE feature may be enabled and disabled, but available. In any texting mode, very responsive keyboard. Even for the user who is not accustomed to a touch screen, it is super easy as the keys \"pop\" out on the screen and eliminate \"fat finger\" syndrome.CAMERA: HD-quality (back facing) and decent quality for (front facing - i.e. self portraits). Impressive and clear shots, and I dare say close to my brother's LG Optimus G, which has the highest photo quality on the market currently at 13MP.  The video quality is pretty nice too. The camera feature is also well done in that it has its own \"quick access\" button on the lower right edge, so you don't have to \"dig\" to find it. Really nice for those spontaneous, unexpected photos ops, which of course always happen when one is not ready!QUALITY/BUILD: Corning Gorilla glass touch screen. Looks and feels durable.Does not feel flimsy by any means. Probably could get away without a case/back cover, but probably not a bad idea to have a screen protector to reduce smudges and fingerprints.FEEL: one of the few \"one-handed\" devices out there. Nice and thin, probably more comparable to the iPhone 4, in terms of overall size.APPS: Does not come with an overwhelming number of Apps, which is nice because you can build up your Apps list and customize from scratch.ALARMS: It has as many options as you need, which is nice for varying workdays and weekends. Also, overall pleasant alarm sounds, which is nice. (But that is coming from the Blackberry, so my perception is skewed and anything really sounds better having said that.)BATTERY LIFE: Fairly decent. This was very important to me, personally, and not many IT reviews focused too much on this so I'll go into more detail for those interested. Today, for example, I spoke on the phone for 1.5 hours total, played Pandora for about 2 hours, sent and received about 15 texts (some days up to 30-40), read about 10 emails, replied to 3 emails, and checked FB about three times...and the battery life is now about 40% left in the 12 hours of usage. You can always install an Android \"App Killer\" that terminates various Apps periodically that run in the background to optimize your battery life. Also, the product comes with a US wall plug, which the USB cord plugs into; that's nice since you can also go between wall or your laptop/PC to charge. Also, the phone is sent with a UK plug/adapter as well (also USB compatible), so that's handy for a trip abroad.In conclusion, if you're looking for a durable, high-quality, practical phone, and you're disappointed because GSM providers here in the US don't carry the Motorola Razr devices, then this is the perfect workaround solution! I absolutely adore this phone, best choice for me. Thanks for reading, hope this helps a bit.UPDATE: August 18, 2013Still very pleased with this phone! I installed Dropbox the other day, and used it to edit some documents in QuickOffice. Amazing! Just very responsive and fast! I haven't found a flaw with it yet, and I've used it for two months now.", "Date": "June 26, 2013"}, {"Title": "excellent quality and design", "Author": "moj \"moj\"", "ReviewID": "R2JUECXRY1341S", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This is one of the best smartphones I've purchased in a long time and probably gives my iPhone a run for the money.

(Perfect for at&t; networks)", "Author": "jake", "ReviewID": "R1Z8DYNN1V83WI", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This model was originally designed to be sold in south america yet its perfectly suited for north american GSM bands. 3g works flawlessly on airvoicewireless/ which is a sublet of AT&T.; This phone is the perfect compact size yet very capable of wonderful graphics and online activities. I searched all over the web to find a smaller phone with good features and this is the only one I found closest to the size of an iphone with same or better functionality! Its very comfortable and easy to use with one hand. Build quaility is on the high end and it does not feel like some cheap plastic. It does not come preloaded with too many apps, but the playstore provides any possible app for free. The processor on this device is on the lower end but I was quite surprised with its functionality, lightning fast user interface. Pages load as quick as an iphone, it has really comfortable pinch to zoom and readability is a breeze. I compare this with some of the newer phones on the market like blackberry z10 (which i had returned) and Motorola still wins the battle. For anyone who doesnt wanna spend 600 for iphone, this is a very adequate choice that should be more than satisfying.", "Date": "February 24, 2014"}, {"Title": "Fantastic phone", "Author": "Mr. L. W. Thistlethwaite", "ReviewID": "RC2AGHHMDNLL3", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Ive had this phone a few months now and still not used everything on it it has more than you need for workaday needs so buy this phone with confidence you will be getting a good deal. If like me your not gadget friendly be sure to read the manual as you will be finding new toys long after you think you know it all. It is a good looking phone too if your style is a factor in your choice so go ahead Im sure you wont be sorry. One thing that im sure is a problem for all smart phones is the number of apps I myself went ridiculous and had page after page which if you dont use them why have them and make sure you have an app killer for the rest because they will just drain the battery life and probably raise your bill I learned the hard way.", "Date": "July 29, 2013"}, {"Title": "New phone, trustworthy seller", "Author": "Stampcos \"pkb\"", "ReviewID": "R3W2UB6LJF19YX", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Switching from Verizon to ATT for significant cost savings for large family (5 phones).  Was concerned about buying phone online because of fraudulent companies reselling stolen numbers.

Although you will not have the insanely high benchmarks that are found in the Samsung Galaxy S4 or the HTC One, this phone is way ahead of it's league when compared to other mid-range Android phones. The Intel processor is snappy, makes the phone extremely responsive and allows for an unbelievably robust battery life. The software is basically vanilla Android 4.1.2 (Jelly Bean) with some added features that can actually be useful unlike some phones out there which seem to overload their software with features that you will almost never use.

Worked pretty well over last year and was pretty satisfied with it overall.Things i didn't like:- Battery life started ok, but by 8-9months was struggling to get through a day without charging, and without being a heavy user (never used it for music, movies, streaming, games etc)- Disliked that you could not mark an SMS as unread (to deal with later), despite this being on my first Motorola phone close to 15years ago.- Disliked that you could not add/change the alarm and ring tones, leaving alarm (a key feature for me on a phone) as choice between mostly horrible, uninspiring and tinny electrical noisesThing i really didn't like:- 1 year and 2 weeks after purchase (eg: just after warranty ran out), phone completely died without any warning or previous problems. Phone randomly turned off, and i had a day with just a black screen. Now it boots as far as the Motorola logo, and stays there for hours. All my data/files that was not google-linked have been lost. I can get now get to the boot menu, but all options just return me to the motorola logo.
