It's taking some getting used to learning how to use everything (& I'm not super tech savvy so I know I won't be taking advantage of absolutely everything the phone has to offer) but I'm so happy with it.Two things for me were of most importance - the camera & battery life.  I took pictures at a baby shower the day I got it & they were so clear & the camera is super easy to use.  My pictures used to be so bad but I had no choice with the phone I had.  It was definitely a selling point for me.  I'm very excited to use it for the holidays and compare the pics to last year's.  I'm sure it will be a VAST improvement as I no longer use a real camera, only my phone's.As for battery life, I am not one to live with dragging around a charger as I never had to with my old phone so I was really worried about battery life.  It really was my deciding factor between the Galaxy III and the s4.  I have not been disappointed.  The first two days I used the phone to drain all the way before charging it and now I can use it all day long without charging it until I go to bed at night.  I use it a lot during the day, not crazy, but I'm always texting, emailing, checking Twitter, Pinterest, Amazon, eBay, banking apps, IMdb, etc.  Unless you're watching tons of video or playing games I can see it lasting you all day long with regular use.  Just keep the screen brightness low, shut off Bluetooth & GPS when not in use, and close all unused apps and you'll be fine.The size of the screen is great too.  It is taking some getting used to a bigger phone but it's so much better on the eyes and makes texting and emailing a breeze.  My only complaint is that now my phone isn't completely concealed in my pockets so I get a little concerned that it may be easier to fall out (or God forbid for someone to help themselves to it) but I got the Otterbox Commuter Series case and it is well protected and still slim enough to fit in the back pocket of skinny jeans.As for the 4G LTE, I am in an area that has just had all of its T-Mobile (whom Metro PCS had partnered with) towers so I get 4G LTE pretty much anywhere I go around where I live (the suburbs) or when I travel into the city.  For 4G coverage on a no contract plan, you can't beat Metro PCS.  BUT, having said that...Do your research before buying your Metro PCS phone off of Amazon & make sure it has come out since August 2013 or otherwise by 2015 it won't be compatible with Metro PCS's new operating system and won't be worth a darn.  I know that all s4's sold on the Metro PCS website and at their authorized dealers are ok but it can't hurt to make sure before you buy from a dealer on Amazon.Having said that, this phone is definitely worth the 5-star rating and all of the Metro PCS customer service and salespeople I have had to deal with have been very nice.  Get it now so you'll be able to enjoy it for all of your upcoming holiday events.  I'm glad that I will be!", "Date": "November 26, 2013"}, {"Title": "600 is not right especially for a used phone", "Author": "najiah", "ReviewID": "R1HTRKX5JEJSYK", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "The phone is amazing but not 600 dollars amazing.

But the MetroPCS version is same with difference in cellular chip/processor. From a user's perspective exactly same! NFC Tag from Whiztags is just awesome, has 450 bytes of memory and I use several of those in office and home with my Samsung Galaxy S4 NFC tags - Topaz 512 Chip - 10 Pack + Keychain + Free Bonus Tag - Android Writeable & Programmable - Adhesive Sticker Back - Samsung Galaxy S4 S3 Note 3 - HTC One First One X Droid DNA - Sony Xperia - Nexus - Smart Tags - Best Money-Back Guarantee!I have been using TechMatteTM Qi-compatible Wireless Charger for the Nexus 4, HTC 8X, HTC Droid DNA, Nokia Lumia 920, LG Optimus Vu2 (With AC Adapter and Micro USB Cable). and TechMatteTM Qi-standard Wireless Charger Receiver Coil for SAMSUNG Galaxy S4 SIV for wireless charging and they are very convenient for charging by placing on the mat.UPDATE 9/15/2013:I thought I will update since it's been a while. We have two Galaxy S4 in the family. One black and one white both unlocked. There has been few firmware updates to the 9500 International series. I have been asked about the heat issue. Other than normal electronic heating feeling, it does NOT get super hot etc. In the initial days some people had issues, but apparently firmware has patched it. Version 4.2.2, BUILD: JDQ39.I9500XXUAMDX. Kernel 3.4.5-526212. I use Battery Widget Pro and has been watching battery usage. Easily for a day with normal usage. If I use video streaming and use NAVIGON indiscriminately, of course battery usage will shot down. Camera app does crash with latest updates. If I don't use camera for a day and use it, sometimes it crashes and phone reboots. After that no issue in subsequent sessions.  I have been using NFC a lot. I got the WhizTags NFC tags - NTAG203 Chip - 10 Pack + Keychain + Free Bonus Tag - Android Writable & Programmable - Adhesive Sticker Back - Samsung Galaxy S4 S3 Note 2 - HTC One First One X Droid DNA - Sony Xperia - Nexus - Smart Tags - Best Money-Back Guarantee! which is awesome. I use in conjunction with  NFC Task Launcher App. Samsung also has TecTiles App. When I go to office I tap a NFC Tag to get the settings I desire - eg vibrate, wifi on etc. At CAR different instructions and so on.Get a spare battery if you are using phone in an intense manner or if you are on long road trips or for just peace of mind. Timetec 2*2600mAh High Capacity Li-ion Battery for Samsung Galaxy S4 S IV SIV, I9500. Samsung Galaxy GT-I9500, Verizon SCH-I545, AT&T; SGH-I337, Sprint SPH-L720+Free Bonus TimeTecTM Multi-purpose USB Travel Charger is a great choice.Another great gadget to have in your backpack while traveling or at home is an excellen remote for this phone. Yes a remote for media and camera. I have reviewed it at Satechi BT MediaRemote Bluetooth Multi-Media Remote Control (White) for Samsung Galaxy S2, S3, S4 / Note, Note II / Galaxy Tab / Galaxy NexusORIGINAL REVIEWGalaxy S4 is  an incredible phone. I have been using this unlocked S4 for past 2 days helping a friend to migrate from iPhone 4S. My friend has been on iPhone and it also gave me a unique perspective. I used iPhone for couple of years and been using Android for past 3+ years.I have used Galaxy S3, Note II and for me S4 is more like a S3s :) If you have a Galaxy S3, it is perfect and there is no need to move to S4. The new features are more like minor upgrades for me. Just like Detroit rolls out new cars every year, phone manufacturers have found excellent way to make yearly upgrades.Battery came for almost a day. The video playback was crisp and my friend was amazed at the customization options. It is heaven for a iphone user to come out of shackles and explores the wonderful world of Android. It sure sounds like it is for geeks, but Samsung has created lot of ways to simplify and make it less intimidating. The EASY mode is for one such reason. Samsung's addition of all those apps (commonly referred as crapware) is not as bad as HTC or LG. Android experience is classified as pure vanilla in phones like Nexus. Vendors like Samsung have added a whole lot of extra programs.5\" HD Super AMOLED 1920 x 1080 display  (441 ppi) is just plain gorgeous. 13 MP camera takes ginormous image sizes. I put a 64 GB microSDXC card  SanDisk 64GB Mobile Ultra MicroSDXC Class 6 Memory Card with SD Adapter - Retail Packaging as my friend wants to take lot of movies (built-in 2 GB RAM, 16 GB ROM). No stuttering, and very smooth playback of videos captured in varying light conditions (HD Playback; HD Recording). Compatible video types are AVI/DIVX, WMV/ASF, FLV, MKV, MP4/3GP, WEBM. HDR and Panaromic photos were incredibly sharp. Compatible audio types are:  AAC, AMR, MP3, OGG, WMA/ASF, 3GA/M4A, FLAC, WAV. Google Music, PlayerPro Music player are producing excellent music.  Audio/Video is one section where S4 has nudged S3. For a normal user, if you are not into lot of video processing this does not matter.S4's infrared sensor is the same technology as TV remote control, so with WatchON you can change the TV channel from your phone. My friend was shocked to see this feature. Having used Android for a long time, I explored all new features one by one. My friend is still getting used to and feels this is too complicated. I broke down into lot of sub features and told my friend he may not use 50% of features, but told him to explore one feature at a time and focus on that.Games were very buttery, this phones runs ARM\u00ae-based octa-core mobile CPU. This is apparently world's first!  Inside this chip is Imagination Technologies' PowerVR SGX544MP3 GPU. I tried several car racing games and performance was phenomenal. People on the XDA-Developers forum report seeing smearing and ghosting when scrolling on the phone. This especially occurs to people when scrolling among darker colors, which begin showing up as purple. I tried hard to see if I could on the S4 I was testing with my friend and I could not see it. I am sure these can be upgraded with software over due course.Air View and Air Gestures - are they worth it? Air view is similar to how the S-pen on the Galaxy Note 8 works. Simply hover finger a few millimeters above the screen and in supported apps, you'll see a preview of content. This works with many of Samsung's built-in apps, including the photo gallery, the dialer, Samsung's browser and email client. It also works with Flipboard. Air View works by cranking up the capacitive sensor on the screen. Another new feature is Air Gestures. This uses the IR sensor on the top of the phone to detect movement by your palm or finger. One can flip between open tabs in Samsung's browser app, skip to a new song in the music player and do many other things. I say these are still in works and sometimes not very efficient.GPS was spot on and I tried multiple GPS apps. It was bright outdoors (had to crank the brightness all the way up). I tried multiple apps to demonstrate to my friend. In the end, my friend was impressed with what all Android and in particular S4 had to offer. Smooth and Stunning display!I tried following apps and they just worked awesome.Amazon MobileAndroid StatusAndroidifyAngry Birds (Space/Seasons)Asphalt 7Amazon App StoreBoxCar Maintenance Reminder ProChromeCNET TVNAVIGON (from Garmin - offline maps)Google Navigation/Earth/MapsGoogle Currents (nice way to read News)Draw SomethingGoogle DriveEbayLinkedinGoogle MusicTapatalk (awesome forum browsing app)OverDrive Media Console: Library eBooks & Audiobooks (public library consumption of media)Microsoft One Note (legacy docs, skydrive of 25 GB is good)Subsonic Music StreamerTerminal Emulator (still need to use vi, yes this is it)TweetCaster Pro for Android (excellent twitter client)Twit.TvTriggerGoogle VoicePlenty of WidgetsAsk questions, the review cannot do justice to Galaxy S4.

I really love my Samsung Galaxy S4. I used to own an iPhone 5, I thought I loved it until I bought the GS4.

While the phone has fantastic capabilities, it uses a slightly different network of towers.I was aware of this going in, and checked that coverage would be as good as it was on my previous cheapo MetroPCS phone. The map on the MetroPCS website assured me that it was. However, upon receipt of my phone, in the middle of a huge shopping center next to the highway in Gilroy CA, I found that I had limited or no connection. Drove north a few miles, still no connection. Got back on the highway and drove home to my tiny town of 1200 people, and had stellar connection. This hadn't been nearly as bad on my previous phone. Now, I find myself without coverage for 20 minutes of my 45 minute commute into San Jose every day.These connection issues are further compounded by the fact that Svoice, Samsung's voice app that is designed to compete with Apple's Siri, requires a nearly perfect connection at all times to be able to perform the most mundane of tasks that do not even require an internet connection.All in all, this would be an all around fantastic phone if Metro PCS would get it together and sort out their coverage, and Samsung would fix Svoice. As it is, it's a stellar device at some times, and an infuriating one at others.", "Date": "January 19, 2014"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": null, "Features": null, "Name": null, "ImgURL": null, "ProductID": "B00F9S93S8"}}
