Fields \"Orycal\"", "ReviewID": "RAZ4E8PQUU3ZW", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I wanted to wait a bit to review this because I have been guilty of writing reviews before giving the product/item enough testing time. I had a LG phone prior to this one, it wasn't a \"smartphone\" perse, it was more of a 'dumb-as-a-box-of-rocks' phone that was even more limited by the phone carrier(Verizon), the old phone froze and locked up during one of Verizon's updates so I had to quickly buy a new one, I wasn't looking for a smartphone, but I decided for the price I would give this phone a try. First thing, right off the bat, I love how quickly the phone was shipped, got it in one full day(I do not count the day I purchased the phone since it was past the time to be able to ship anything). Onto the phone it's self, I was forced to upgrade my $30 a month service to a $60 or $70 a month service-I only mention this because I did not realize I had to do so, which-once i got my data service issues under control(shut down to use straight WiFI)and stop the data service charges, it's been wonderful for me. The phone is very responsive and for the limited amount of time I actually use my phone(mostly just texting between my husband and our kids to check in, maybe a few games downloaded)it's just fine for me. One issue I did have was the charge \"base\" or mouth(where you plug it into the wall), was defective and would not allow the phone to charge if plugged directly into the wall, the USB cord charged it just fine, but I like to plug it into the surge protector directly. Fortunately for me, I had a spare to use/replace it with. The other thing, not much of a issue for me, since I do all of my actual web surfing via my laptop or tablet, is the pretty limited Internal storage, about about 183MB with the phone running. I added 5 apps-only 2 of with run off the phone's storage, and I'm currently using 60MB. I have swapped out my 15gig SD card to this phone and I am very watchful to move apps that are able, to the card. It's not a huge bother for me since there it's a lot I do with the phone it's self, but something for others that may have more online demands, it may be a very big issue.", "Date": "April 25, 2013"}, {"Title": "Great intro smartphone for the price", "Author": "Da Bien Waah Baker", "ReviewID": "R1EYO3L8654PQK", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I ordered this phone about a month ago. It arrived promptly and in good condition. I switched from my old phone to this one without a problem (I just took it to a Verizon store and they did everything for me at no charge).So far the phone is pretty great. It's my first smartphone and I'm only using it for basic things like checking my email (Gmail) and a little websurfing. But it reacts quickly to gestures and loads web pages just fine (not instantaneous - but I think that's the network more than the phone).The call quality is VERY GOOD which is really important to me since it's my only phone. So this is a big plus!The OS is very user friendly (for me) and options and settings are pretty easily figured out. Pictures and video on it looks good. I love the slide out keyboard - it makes it MUCH easier to text and type in anything on the phone!My only complaint is that the battery drains pretty quickly if the phone is in use. I turned my screen brightness all the way down and turned off the WiFi and that seems to help. But I still have to charge it every night and I carry a charger with me during the day just in case. (But I've discussed this with other smartphone owners and it seems that, for most smartphones, this is just where the technology is at the moment.)Overall, for $130 (which was the price on Amazon when I bought it) I think it's an excellent phone.", "Date": "November 27, 2012"}, {"Title": "Charger, Screen Issue", "Author": "A. Poghosyan", "ReviewID": "R3VWWT09Q9XRKW", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I have been using this phone for about 6 months now, but it already started to malfunction. Sometimes the screen does not open up and I can't use the phone. I have to take the battery out and put it back to turn it on. Sometimes it turns off by itself. Now the battery is not holding the charge. Even if I don't use the phone, in 1 hour the fully charge phone has no charge at all. I have to carry my charge with me everywhere. I have to order a new battery and I don't know how long it'll last.The camera does not have a flash, so it is horrible at nights. The video sucks at nights as well. They both are all right during the day. For the money it is not worthy at all. Instead you can buy Motorola DROID A855. It is a phone like the LG, but the camera is 5MP and has a flash. The price is about $80 brand new. Even if it breaks like the LG, at least you know you paid less.7/18/13 - To update my comments, I would give it a 5 star so far. I bought a replacement battery, but before installing it, I took the old one out, cleaned it (although no signs of any dirt) and put it back in it. It started working like brand new. Has been over a year now, and it is still working. As a matter of fact, my friend's Motorola A855 broke down completely. He bought another new Motorolla, that lasted two weeks. Now he bought the LG VS700 since mine has been working, so if you are thinking about buying the LG, go for it. Even the iPhone reviews complain about the Apple product, so getting this phone for the price is very well worthy. So I am changing the stars I previously gave from 2 to 5 stars.", "Date": "February 1, 2013"}, {"Title": "Great Phone, I love It!", "Author": "C. Wilson \"game maniac\"", "ReviewID": "R2ITWWBP0AYDIG", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I actually bought this phone off of ebay for an unbelieavable price of $8 (plus $10 shipping). I had a lg env3 which I loved but I needed just a little more screen space. Just by chance or luck I decided to bid on this one and actually won it. It was a refurb which was fine and upon arrival it was soooo much better than I expected. I like the fact most that it has a qwerty keyboard since i'm one to use my phone moreso for the purpose of texting than talking on it. I must agree with some of the reviews as far as the camera is concerned because it sucks as far as taking pics in low light conditions but it's actually pretty good during the day or lighted conditions. This phone is very easy to navigate through menus and apps and the speakerphone is very loud which is great due to me not wanting to have a phone up against my face and those I call say they can hear me quite clearly and are unaware i'm on a speakerphone at all. I've read on some that the touchscreen is sluggish but after owning this phone for a little over a week that's a problem I haven't come across and the battery life is really good.

Though this is my smartphone and I was cautious because of the bad reviews BUT it works great for me. I have no problems using it and the programs run excellent. The only issues I have had is the phone saying it had \"insufficient storage\" for a 6 megabyte app when there is 36 megabytes left. Also, if your battery dies and you let it drain completely; I've had issues charging it and starting it back up immediately. If you run the battery down completely, you have to leave it plugged in for a good 30 minutes before it'll even come up with the battery charging screen.Other than those two issues, it works wonderfully. I haven't had any issues with the screen, call quality, general functions of the phone. It hold my 16GB Micro SD chip, and plays music well. No problems at all.The battery it came with was in sort of bad condition (IE, I would have the phone powered up and using it and the battery would run down and die within 6 hours, which isn't that bad) but I bought a new battery and the phone will run, with FB, Twitter, Instagram, etc. for a full 12 hours on full charge.I recommend this phone.", "Date": "September 28, 2013"}, {"Title": "Great for first time android users", "Author": "G.

Works great on Page Plus", "Author": "David J V", "ReviewID": "R17DM308OY7KIB", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I recommend this phone to folks who text, email, call from their phone more than anything else but still want to easily browse the web or enjoy some media. It's not a pocket size multimedia extravaganza, but it is excellent in all communication functions, and even a little more.I use this phone on Page Plus. This phone is perfect for Page Plus, aside from all the \"V\"apps you can't get rid of.I purchased this phone new. It arrived brand new in box with battery, charger/data cable, and 6gb SD card installed. It actually arrived a week early so I was very thrilled, had a horrible week and it was a pleasant surprise! I purchased this phone because my previous phone's(HTC Eris) charge port wasn't consistently working. I didn't really like the Eris anyway, it was an emergency purchase when my amazing Blackberry suddenly bit the dust in the middle of planning an event. Anyways rather than bothering to get it fixed I decided I'd do some research this time so I'd get a durable phone that I actually liked.I like this phone because it is no doubt a PHONE... a lot of smart phones get so cluttered with all kinds of other features that actual phone/text related functions get buried. Of course I like the convenience of GPS, being able to check my email, browse the web, check up on FB, take and send photos, but what I value above all this in a phone is ease and functionality in the call and text message department. That and battery life...battery life is pretty decent on this phone, exceedingly better than my Eris. I browsed Market and web with GPS turned on for about 7 hours non stop before the battery got down to 18%.As I hoped, phone calls and texts work very smoothly and efficiently on this phone, but it also does a much better job at smartphone functions than I expected...web browsing is pretty smooth(I always install my own browser app), GPS does its job, email and Google apps all work well, my apps such as Google Drive, Kindle, banking, all work fine. Wifi works great, haven't tried bluetooth yet.Camera and internal storage are the only reasons I hold back one star...Camera isn't awful, but not great, especially since it has no flash. But I have a camera, so no biggie. Phone's camera is good enough for capturing impromptu day to day moments. Internal Storage is VERY small. The good thing is unlike my Eris you can move apps to the SD, but only the apps that allow it. You can get a free app called app2sd that makes this process easy to manage. Hasn't been a huge issue for me, but there are a couple of apps I really wanted but I did not install because they take up too much space and can't be moved to the card. So keep that in mind.Some more random pros and cons...Pros:Slide out qwerty keyboard or virtual touch screen keyboard. Both very responsive. I love the slide out keyboard. Screen rotates automatically and pretty smoothly. Pinch and zoom browser. Runs very fast and smoothly, touch screen very responsive. Solidly constructed. Combines Android 2.3 with LG interface, very user friendly. Flash player. Factory 6 gb SD card can be swapped up for up to 32 gb card. I currently have an 8gb and its all I need. Apps that allow it can be moved to SD card, making up for the phones low internal storage.Cons: a bit heavy and kinda thick. tiny internal storage. lots of pre-installed apps that I will never use and cannot remove. Using Android on LG interface can be a bit confusing. Display is more than adequate for my purposes, but screen resolution is noticeably lower than most popular smart phones, even my old Eris(doesn't look pixelated or anything that bad, but some high quality graphics won't shine as they should on this screen). Although the phone is overall solidly constructed, the slide out keyboard is a tiny bit wobbly when shut or all the way open. It doesn't feel like it would break off, but it can be a bit unnerving. Maybe it is just mine?This is an excellent basic smart phone if your priority is text, email and phone calls.This is no Motorola Droid, Galaxy, or iPhone, etc. But if you want a Motorola Droid, Galaxy, or an iPhone you should purchase one of those instead of looking at cheap alternatives... there's no way around it. I like this phone a lot, pleased with the seller.", "Date": "January 12, 2014"}, {"Title": "Phone Great for $50 - Comes With Many Flaws", "Author": "DatapawWolf \"DatapawWolf\"", "ReviewID": "RDOURXZ7XDCOK", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "So I recently purchased this phone since it can be used without a contract, and for $50: much less than any god forsaken markup Verizon has on amazon.It works great as a cheap, low end smartphone, but has many flaws, which include software and hardware, and so I cannot rate this higher than two stars.*Occasionally it will simply stop sending/receiving text messages. So far I have little idea how or why this occurs. This proceeds for any length of time and/or until multiple restarts of the phone*The battery life is poor. Any use of apps sucks the battery usage to less than a day. Skype alone will suck up the battery life in a mere 2-3 hours.*Sometimes the micro SD card stops being read. This was never an issue on my previous phone with the same card, and so I can only reason that it is a software/hardware defect.*The available flash memory is so small that few apps can actually be downloaded without an SD card to put them on, which then defeats the purpose of a smart phone. Not to mention there's no legitimate way to download larger apps, because there is no option to download APK/install files to the micro SD card instead of the phone flash storage.*Update - the screen will stop being responsive after seconds of being in cold temperatures*Update - its problems are getting worse. Messages fail to send with no information available consistently. I wish at this point I could rate it 0 stars. Waste of money.Overall, like I said, it's good for $50, but the poor quality of the software and hardware should never merit the current $75 asking price here on Amazon.", "Date": "January 6, 2014"}, {"Title": "Potential Buyers Please Read", "Author": "Amazon Customer", "ReviewID": "R38ASEHU7DIWQ3", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "This was the second LG Enlighten I had to order this week, and I had issues with this one too.

Since when do they sell new phones with USED batteries? Furthermore, the phone would freeze when I attempted to change the ringtone or notification tone. Nothing against the seller(BluTek USA) other than the USED battery issue, but I am convinced that it is the phone itself and not the seller Hence, I give the phone 1 star and the seller 3 stars for the USED battery.

To be fair, the seller was prompt in contacting me when I notified Amazon of the (my) shipping mistake. They offered a way for me to contact a representative of the seller directly as the problem persisted. And they forwarded the phone free of charge...so I was appreciative. That said, the response they gave me for the problem was to distance themselves from the cause as their first priority and to drive home the fact that they would not be held liable (they did ship it to the address listed). I imagine if it were lost they could have offered me new phone as a goodwill gesture free without much real loss, or offered me a new one at cost but they made it clear they would not.

Video is great as well. The slide out keyboard is really well to use when on Facebook and Twitter.Now, the reason I was not impressed with the phone is because of the internal memory is not even a Gigabit. Yes there is an option to put a memory card in but since I have only 5 installed apps(Facebook, Instagram,Snapchat, Pandora and Twitter) it will not allow me to add more apps due to low memory.Overall this phone is a great smart phone it just lacks the internal memory that would make this a keeper.
