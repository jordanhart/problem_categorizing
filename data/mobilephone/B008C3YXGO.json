Phone was in perfect condition and no item was missing from the box. At a way cheaper price than the retail value at either Verizon's store or website can't really go wrong. Had it for more than a month now and am writing this from it so the phone will work. This version is specifically for Verizon in the u.s., so be careful about which version you buy.", "Date": "August 28, 2012"}, {"Title": "Cool.", "Author": "Alex Anderson", "ReviewID": "R4XYX6RX3CMPZ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Arrived much quicker than expected, in good condition, was above expectations.
