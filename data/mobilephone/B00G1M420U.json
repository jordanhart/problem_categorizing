Let me tell you that in my experience the double knock works effortlessly. That topic is very subjective as people are used to different touch experiences across devices, but i truly believe the feature is very easy to use and adds lots of usability to the phone.purchased from FGS trading and it was very well packed, they were very polite and included an US wall charger adapter as the provided one if for Europe /Asia (not sure) excellent seller", "Date": "December 17, 2013"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": null, "Features": null, "Name": null, "ImgURL": null, "ProductID": "B00G1M420U"}}
