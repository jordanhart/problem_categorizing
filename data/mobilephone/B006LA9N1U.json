It is unlocked and has 2 sims card holder and one for a small micros sd slot for memory. The camera works, the text and phone works just fine, but I can't get the alarm clock to work. It also always says A.M. no matter whether it is am or pm. So I set it to 24 hr format to just keep from getting confused. It does keep time ok. The battery does not hold hold charge for very long, the ad I saw said that a Nokia battery was available was compatible for it, although I have no idea which Nokia battery that would be, and I have had a lot of Nokia phones and they tend to hold charge for a long time so I assume that would be because they have good batteries. I don't have internet on my phone so I cannot comment on whether that works well or not. It is a nice little phone and I don't know why I can't get the alarm to work, I have set alarms in a lot of other phones without any problems.", "Date": "September 11, 2012"}, {"Title": "gsm cell phone", "Author": "djlati", "ReviewID": "R14B4FPKCYEYA9", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "loved it.
