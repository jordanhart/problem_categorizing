{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Blu Life One M - L131U", "Author": "R. Chin", "ReviewID": "R3JQCERI39OF6N", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "As usual, my phone reviews include mostly areas that are not obvious or well described, hence this review serves as information to clarify the unclear.  Processor speed (1.3GHz, not 1.5), memory and app stability, camera quality, display, etc., are not covered here because these are very subjective matters.  For the general features/specifications of the phone, please visit BluProduccts web site.There are two variants of the Life One M.  Like all Blu phones, both variants of the One M are unlocked GSM phones which -voice service- is compatible with both AT&T; and T-Mobile networks plus all of their MNVOs such as StraightTalk, Net-10, AIO, etc.  The One M is also compatible anywhere in the world where GSM -voice service- is offered.The two variants are L131L and L131U, both are tri-band HSPA+ phones.  As I briefly mentioned earlier, the voice bands on both variants are similar; quad-band GSM (850/900/1800/1900MHz).  The difference between the two versions are on the 3G HSPA+ (data) bands.  They are:  - L131L: 850/1900/2100MHz  - L131U: 850/1900/1700MHz(AWS)  ** 2100MHz will allow you to receive HSPA+ service in Europe/Asia when you travelFortunately, either version will work nicely with AT&T;'s and T-Mobile's high speed data service.  Simply put, if you are an AT&T; customer, either version will be fine as AT&T; supports both 850/1900MHz bands fully.If you are a T-Mobile customer, either version will work, too, but the L131U might be more suitable for some T-Mobile users.  This is because in some areas, T-Mobile may -not- have 1900MHz HSPA+ enabled.  Traditionally, T-Mobile high speed data has been on 1700MHz band.  It wasn't until 2+ years ago when T-Mobile began to re-deploy its 3G network on 1900MHz.  The L131U ensures your phone will either connect to 1700MHz or 1900MHz HSPA+ depending on your location.As a reference, my Blu Life Play has only 850/1900MHz HSPA+.  The mobile data service is solid on T-Mobile 1900MHz.The caveat of choosing the L131U is that one day, T-Mobile will exclusively use 1700MHz for LTE, rendering this phone without HSPA+ service.  Personally, I feel that HSPA+ will continue to exist on 1700MHz for another 2~3 years.  For that reason and being a T-Mobile customer, I've chosen the L131U.  If this happens sooner, I will probably switch to AT&T; since the L131U has the 850MHz band that works on AT&T; HSPA+ service.  Or, get another new Blu phone which should be LTE by them :-)At the beginning of this review, I mentioned to view the features and specifications from the company website.  There is a couple of points that I didn't find on the manual:  1) One M has two (2) Mini (aka regular) SIM slots, not micro-SIM as reported on some web resources.  2) There is a notification light.Some solid main features:  1) WiFi reception is strong.  2) Cell reception is strong.  3) Tethering is flawless.  4) Almost stock JB 4.2 Android that will be upgraded to KitKat.  If you have experience on CyanogenMod releases, you will love Blu's Android on this phone.  This is truly a subjective opinion, but I can't help it.Some features that are less than desirable:  1) Battery could be bigger in capacity, in my opinion.  2) Back cover is very difficult to ply open.  3) Top USB port.**** I strongly recommend getting a 90-degree USB charging cable if you frequently use the phone during charging time.  The straight angle USB cable creates too much tension on the USB port and cause damage to the port over time.Lastly, I will spend more time on GPS testing and will update.  I hope the GPS on the One M is better than that on Play.Overall, this is another Blu phone I am impressed with.Cheers!!*** Update - 02/Apr ***1) GPS is reliable and accurate.  GPS 0n the original Play tends to lose the current position and will start showing routes that are not relevant to current position.2) One M tested successfully with CTIA compliant headset using the iPhone headset.  The original Play does not support CTIA compliant headset.3) Display is good to excellent on sunny day.One final note.  If you want to use another case besides the silicon case that is part of the package, search for \"hard case cover for blu life one m\" on eBay.Cheers!", "Date": "March 22, 2014"}, {"Title": "Life One M", "Author": "Scott A. Wells", "ReviewID": "R1ZTCK4UN5XGA", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I've been wanting to buy one of these phones for some time now. I'm glad I did. I will not be reviewing the os as its jellybean and works like jellybean on any other phone. One week review.Pros: Fast start up. No lag when using local wireless network, its as fast if not faster than other devices in home.Very snappy response when loading apps. Phone is setup with ATT sim card. Works fine with ATT. Runs all google apps with ease. Runs most games very well. There does not seem to be any lag with the CPU or GPU for what I do. Phone itself is very well made. The back is a little difficult to remove at first because it has such a precision fit and its made of a very stiff aluminum, but after a few removals it becomes easier, I'm still amazed by the tight but fit appearance once reinstalled. Slot for sd card is under this cover. I have a 32 GB micro sd installed, no problems recognizing and installing card.Screen appearance is bright and with well saturated colors and contrast, viewable outside with only slight issues when bright sunlight is present.Camera has very good resolution and sharpness. Video looks very sharp and well exposed, but I have not spent enough time with this to comment further. Speaker volume is ok to good. With earbuds audio is very crisp and clear with little to no distortions. I do hear distortion with some phone calls but this could be more due to ATT network than with phone. Phone seems to charge with any 5volt charging device.Cons:Silicon phone cover that came with phone is junk, it covers the on/off button and continually cycles the phone off and on. Have yet to find a replacement. Earbuds that came with phone did not work as all. I have ear buds all over the house and they work fine so phone jack is functioning as it should. Battery lasts long when on standby but will drain in 4-6 hours when playing games or using wireless and running apps. This seems to be about average for similar smart phones of this size and type( some users may not view this as a con). Instruction manual is borderline useless with very little documentation. Info is very generic in nature. I'm having some issues with screens touch sensitivity along edges mainly. touching and tapping screen produces no or delayed response. Most of the time there are no issues and screen responds fine. I'm not sure if there is a screen calibration feature with this phone.I will update this review when more time has passed", "Date": "April 16, 2014"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": null, "Features": null, "Name": null, "ImgURL": null, "ProductID": "B00IWCCY9I"}}
