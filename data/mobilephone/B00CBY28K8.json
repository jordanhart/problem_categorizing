{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Nice phone", "Author": "rpv", "ReviewID": "R3FTB1QV2OWCXD", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Windows 8 apps are a welcome change from iOS. Among the three ecosystems, I prefer Android, Windows 8, and iOS in that order. Blackberry, what ?! For ease of use, Windows phone is really easy to use. For someone interested in a first smartphone, Lumia 720 is an excellent choice. I got access to few Windows 8 phones to review. I will try to review them, but since I have not used for a period longer than a month I am not reviewing for reliability. User interface in Windows 8 is very pleasing and this is one of best phones with awesome user experience. If you prefer great user experience over infinite hackability, aka Android, then Windows 8 phones are great choice.Nokia Lumia 720 has Qualcomm Snapdragon S4, 1 GHz dual-core Qualcomm Krait, 512 MB RAM (big minus?), 8 GB internal memory. microSD slot up to 64 GB which is awesome. Nokia Lumia 720 is the first time Nokia added an expansion slot for microSD (up to 64GB) into one of its polycarbonate builds. To access that slot you don't need to open the back. Like SIM card in iphones, you need one of those pins and push it to eject it and the microSIM card.This is a HSPA+ device, not a LTE. HSPA+ provides an evolution of High Speed Packet Access and provides data rates up to 168 Megabits per second (Mbit/s) to the mobile device (downlink) and 22 Mbit/s from the mobile device (uplink). These are theoretical of course, and in reality one can get 6-7 Mbps down and 1-2 Mbps up.Currently Temple Run is one of the Apps that require your device to have 1 GB of Memory hence I am surprised why the phone makers go in this route. Memory of 512 MB is not that expensive to put if they can sell in bulk. Microsoft says \"Memory (RAM): Some apps and features won't work on phones with less than 1 GB of RAM. To see how much memory your phone has, check the manufacturer's website or your phone's documentation.\"Screen is good, not great - 4.3-inch IPS touchscreen 800 x 480 pixels at 217 ppi. I have extensively used in the past HTC Titan I and II which is pre Windows 8 (7.5) and I was surprised Windows 8 has become more buttery smooth now. This phone has Gorilla Glass 2. Glass 3 is in the making and supposed to be even better. Stating following because this is highly underrated in reviews. From Corning's Gorilla Glass specs; WHAT MAKES GORILLA GLASS SO DAMAGE RESISTANT? The unique composition of Gorilla Glass allows for a deep layer of high compressive stress (created through an ion-exchange process). This compression acts as a sort of \"armor,\" making the glass exceptionally tough and damage resistant. Ion exchange is a chemical strengthening process where large ions are \"stuffed\" into the glass surface, creating a state of compression. Gorilla Glass is specially designed to maximize this behavior.Battery is rechargeable 2000mAh Li-ion battery. (Compared to a high end Android Galaxy Note II, which has a battery of 3100 mAh Battery.) The Lumia 720 doesn't have a removable battery cover, which means you can't access or replace your battery.Camera 6.7 MP is good enough, Bluetooth 3.0, 802.11a/b/g/n, G-Sensor, Digital Compass, A-GPS &GLONASS;, micro-USB. I was able to get excellent reception with Bluetooth headset, Jaybird Sportsband Stereo Bluetooth Headphone - Bulk Packaging - Midnight Black and JayBird BlueBuds X Sport Bluetooth Headphones - Midnight Black  All the usual smartphone stuff, facebook, twitter, music, emails etc are all excellent. It is only the third party apps that are lacking in some arenas. If you are Microsoft heavy like Office suites, Lumia phone are awesome!Apps are limited in Windows 8 marketplace. Yes, we have heard this a gazillion times. Lumia has GPS receiver with A-GPS and GLONASS support. I tried with Garmin Navigon app which turned out to be great in giving voice directions. App ecosystem is a chicken and egg situation. Unless more phones are sold, developers don't have incentives to write apps. Apps are less now, because people are not buying in big droves. Windows Phone is now (early-mid 2013) the third-leading mobile phone platform, more than tripling its market share year-over-year. One recent report I read Android and iOS are ahead in games with 162.1 and 37.4 million shipments in 1Q13 and Windows phone came in 7 million. This is more than double from previous year. I really hope for Windows 8 platform to surge ahead because having a 3 way competition with iOS and Android is good for the ecosystem.Overall, for the price point this is a great phone in the Windows family. I am really surprised Nokia has been able to turnaround quickly when I thought they are out in smartphone area.", "Date": "May 18, 2013"}, {"Title": "Best Windows Phone", "Author": "Geemed", "ReviewID": "R30SDNH8Y2UR5F", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "The performance of the phone is undoubtedly one of the best experiences that a user can possibly ask for.  The phone is exactly as described and all that is needed to get it up and running is the insertion of a micro/mini SIM card.  this is basically a SIM card that is of a smaller size than the regular one.  Most mobile stores have the tool to cut the regular SIM or a mini SIM can be purchased.The box includes the phone, key to open the micro SD and SIM card slots, earphones and a charger that comes with an international adapter.  The charger includes a USB, so that the phone can be charged through an electrical outlet or a USB port.Setting up is easy and the user is guided through each step.  It is beneficial to set up the phone with a windows id - outlook, live, Hotmail account and if you do not already have such an account you are prompted to create one at the time of set up or later if you prefer.In keeping with the Nokia style/brand, the phone is of a superior build quality and feels sturdy.  All the reviews about the exceptional camera with Carl Zeiss lens are indeed true and the camera apps available assist the user in the ultimate photography experience.There are many additional positive features that can be highlighted but I think that people need to own this phone to truly appreciate all that it can do.  The product is exceptional and this quality is mirrored by the seller who delivered in advance of the estimated date.  I have absolutely no regrets with this purchase and highly recommend this phone.", "Date": "February 11, 2014"}, {"Title": "Greaat phone", "Author": "Ramon Bruzual", "ReviewID": "R3E1U0N8DK26F6", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Forget about Android. I have a Sony XPeria and this Windows Phone...Windows Phone is so much faster and efficient, plus, I have tried two different Nokia Lumias and the battery does not die in less than a day, as it happens with EVERY Android/Iphone mobile", "Date": "December 24, 2013"}, {"Title": "Nokia 720 excellent", "Author": "Ross S.", "ReviewID": "R22JVYI8C4ABYQ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Met all of my expectations and as it is unlocked I can use it anywhere.  Very Useful anywhere in the world and the camera is excellent", "Date": "October 2, 2013"}, {"Title": "Fantastic battery life and a good interface - but some hardware issues and no US warranty", "Author": "zoomsthru", "ReviewID": "RM7SIMRSP0FXC", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "One of the main reasons I went with this phone is advertised battery life, and I was pleasantly surprised to see that I only need to charge it once every two days, and even once every 4 days with light use.I like the Windows 8 interface - it's intuitive and is aesthetically pleasing. A lot of the little details have been given enough attention: dialling, messaging, the browser don't have any clear flaws. Overall, I think it's about the same as an Android device (which I have used) or an iOS one, i.e. a good OS with no major flaws. I also like the HERE Maps app, though there is a Google Maps for Windows which one can download if absolutely needed (I have not needed it yet).There is one minor missing feature in the OS which I get to later in the review.The device itself is quick (in spite of the 500MB memory), though I have downloaded only about 15 apps in addition to the ones which the OS came bundled with. Given I am not likely to download too many more, I don't see performance being an issue for me. The touch-screen is also very responsive, and the physical buttons for volume, the on/off and the camera are all useful. Also, the phone looks fantastic! It's slim, sleek and I really like the sharp(ish) corners. It's also rather light for a phone of its size. The music also sounds great on the phone, though not as good as on my Cowon MP3 player.One major complaint of Windows devices is the relative paucity of apps for the platform. I have not really found this to be a problem as nearly all the standard apps are available (Pandora, Kindle, Amazon, Weather etc.) and work very well. I don't use apps for websites though, so my demand for apps is not that high. But even then, firms are also paying attention to the Windows OS now, so the shortage of apps may not last very long.The only little flaw I have found in the phone is OS-related: There is no way to enable an alert if you have an unread SMS or a missed call. On my old (non-smart) device, I could get the phone to beep and vibrate every few minutes if I have missed a call or text message, but on this device, I don't realize this until I actually look at my phone. It's a nice-to-have feature (not enough for me to drop the rating to 4 stars) and I hope Windows builds this into one their future releases.To summarize, I'll say it's a very good phone to buy. I look at it as an Android or iOS phone which looks great and has great battery life.EDIT: After nearly 4 months of use at this point, I stand by the good rating I gave earlier on but have to adjust my rating for these reasons:1. The touch-screen of this phone has begun to hang periodically, rendering it unusable. The buttons on the side for volume and power continue to work, so it's only a problem with the touch-screen. Soft and hard resets don't help.2. This phone is not covered by Nokia's warranty in the United States. Hence, I will either have to pay to have the phone fixed or write-off the $290 I spent on it and get a new one.", "Date": "September 3, 2013"}, {"Title": "Eexceeded my expectations", "Author": "Anthony Dimeglio \"Totonno\"", "ReviewID": "R2AO3GLZ64P8UT", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "As the owner of Lumia 710 I wanted an upgrade to the newer operating system, and a little more modern look. The only negative for me is the fact that the battery is not replaceable. I since have found several vendors who will replace my battery when the time comes . This is the same as Iphones and Ipods. I don't know why I hesitated. The battery life is very good. I can go 2 days with moderate usage. that compares to 1 day for the Lumia 710. I still hve the Lumia 710 and sometimes I use it as a radio in the workshop. My wife uses hers (unlocked). When I use hers, sometimes I wonder why I ever changed. I guess I'm just a Lumia fan.", "Date": "August 20, 2013"}, {"Title": "NOT a top notch Nokia phone.", "Author": "iluv2workout8", "ReviewID": "RGZFK5V3FM2ZH", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "I love Nokia brand phones BUT this one was super cheap made! sim card door was flimsy plastic and was broke in the box!", "Date": "August 31, 2013"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": null, "Features": null, "Name": null, "ImgURL": null, "ProductID": "B00CBY28K8"}}
