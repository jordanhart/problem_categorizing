I own an iPad 2 and 3 and now this new iPad Air version. My main reasons for updating were that I literally fill up my 64 GIG iPad every day or two with videos and photos that I shoot. Having this larger version at 128 GIG allows me to work longer and add more to my iPad. In addition this new version is much lighter and easier to use all day long. Even though the battery is smaller in capacity than my iPad 3 the battery life is longer and it is very noticeable. This is because the faster A7 CPU and the motion chip actually use less power.Please watch my video as I go into more details in it.I immediately noticed the increase in speed. The unit connects to the WIFI faster, synchs with iTunes faster, downloads emails faster and speeds up your web browsing. The differences are very noticeable and enjoyable as a user. The dual speakers are a nice change but I also use a lot of Bluetooth speakers to enhance the sound of the iPad.In my video I do a size and weight comparison to an iPad 2, an iPad 3 and the iPad Air. I also show how the basic set up takes place and for advanced users you can just speed through that portion of the video. The iPad 2 weighs 1 pound 5 1/8 ounces, the iPad 3 weighs 1 pound 7 1/8 ounces, and the iPad Air weighs 1 pound and \u00bc ounce. The iPad Air is narrower but has the same screen size. The left and right edges of the iPad are thinner on the sides of the useable screen and you can see that in the video.Here are the key improvements for me:* Much lighter in weight* Thinner, smaller design with the same screen size* Much faster when synching with iTunes* Much faster when browsing the web* Much faster when downloading emails* Stronger WIFI connection and faster WIFI synching* A more powerful AC wall adapter with 5.2 VDC and an output of 2.4 Amps. It charges at 12 watts of power. It operates at 100 to 240 VAC and 50/60 Hz and it is UL approved. It features folding AC wall plugs for easy packing when traveling.* Lower CPU and motion chip power consumption that makes the smaller/lighter internal battery last longer! This is very noticeable!* As usual a beautiful high resolution retina screen with 2048 by 1536 resolution at 264 pixels per inch. You can see the difference in the photos, videos and reading quality of the screen.* Dual speakers in the bottom* Free high quality Apps* iPhoto* iMovie* GarageBand* Pages* Keynote* Remember to download these from Apple!Overall this is a superior product that really outperforms the older iPads that I have. I was disappointed that the new iPad Air did not have the home button with the fingerprint sensor built in. Since I have used it with my iPhone 5S I have really become attached to it and it just seems like a way to cheapen the unit and be more competitive instead of showing and using the enhanced technology. I would have paid a little more for the iPad Air with that sensor.This is still a 5 star product and I recommend it as a very good tablet.", "Date": "November 9, 2013"}, {"Title": "Incredibly light, fast and beautiful. Is it the best tablet for you?", "Author": "John Ryan", "ReviewID": "R3TR7NYI56R8LY", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "The new iPad Air is Apple's latest, slimmest, lightest release of their hand-held computer. Oddly enough, it's so beautifully easy to use (my one year old daughter loves playing with it), it's almost doesn't feel like a computer at all.A word of warning - this review is written for people who've never owned an iPad before - and are wondering what all the fuss is about. If you're thinking of upgrading skip down to the \"What's great about the Air\" section below, or just buy it - it's amazing.Just what's all the fuss about?--------------------------------------I used to own a laptop for work, and (very occasionally), it'd sit on my lap on the sofa, and I'd use it for pleasure (eMail, watching films or playing the odd game). Then I bought my first iPad, and the laptop became redundant, a boring \"work device\". Hard to explain, but the fact the iPad is so small and light, and you navigate around with your finger by pointing and gently swiping the screen makes the whole experience a lot easier - a lot more fun.Even my most \"luddite\" of friends have been won over.It's incredibly simple and easy to use (it only has one main button), and everyone from my one year old daughter to my 85 year old dad have taken to without problems. It's size and shape also support using it like a book (literally to read a book or web page), but you can also watch TV and films.Personally I'm also paranoid about my password getting \"hacked\", and someone running up a huge Amazon bill or buying stuff with my credit card on eBay. Well one of the benefits of the iPad (and iPhone) is it's \"almost impossible\" to get a virus - one of the most common ways to get hacked. This doesn't mean you shouldn't use strong passwords, (both Sony and Adobe got hacked), but it's reassuring to leave the Windows world behind.Finally, I love the way these devices (iPad, iPhone, Apple TV, Apple Mac), increasingly work together. The fact you can start a Pages document on your Mac and edit it on your iPad, or take photos on the iPhone, and in seconds see them on the iPad or Mac and display them on the Apple TV.The thing is, \"it just works\".What would you use if for?----------------------------------* Shopping online. Obviously - you could be reading a review on Amazon about the iPad Air!* Reading web pages. As you can hold it like a book it's great to read the news online (my wife loves the Daily Mail Online).* Reading Books. It's great for reading books from Amazon Kindle or Apple Books with the benefit of 1,000s of online book reviews* Navigating web pages. Instead of clicking with a mouse, you gently swipe your fingers on screen to scroll around* Watching Films. I use it to watch Netflix online videos (with an Apple TV you can send stuff to the telly)* Watching TV. With the free BBC iPlayer app you can catch up or download BBC programs* Reading and replying to mail. I use \"mailbox\" a great free app to read and reply to mails, but there's a free one included* Showing and organising photos. Any photos on an iPhone are automatically available within minutes in \"the cloud\"* Playing games. From fun puzzle games like \"Cut the Rope\" to fully fledged first person shooters.* Listening to the Radio. With \"Tune in Radio\" you can listen to thousands of radio stations world-wide.* Listening to music. I stream mine to an Apple TV, but you can also buy portable speakers or just plug into the AUX socket* Editing Word, Excel and Powerpoint documents using FREE App \"QuickOffice\" (owned and supported by Google).* Editing Pages, Numbers and Keynote documents (Office for the Apple) on the FREE Apple apps.* The list goes on and on.Update: You can edit Word, Excel and Powerpoint documents (plus Pages, Numbers and Keynote) on the iPad (although I'd recommend an external keyboard - see below). It's definately powerful enough, although I'd not expect these apps to cope with REALLY complex document layouts. Great for general letter and document writing though.Which model should I buy?----------------------------------I can't comment about Android tablets (apart from the Google Nexus 7 which is well regarded), but in terms of the Apple tablet line-up in order of cost:-1. Avoid the Apple iPad 2, it's a relatively old model, under-powered and with a lower resolution screen. If you really want an Apple but don't want to spend the cash, buy a 16g WIFI 3rd or 4th generation iPad from eBay. Avoid this one.2. iPad mini is a lovely tablet. A 7.9 inch screen and astonishingly light and remarkably thin - it feels like a light-weight book.3. iPad mini with retina screen. Again 7.9 inch screen, but with the blazingly fast A7 chip and a \"retina\" (high definition) screen. Worth the upgrade if you can afford it.4. iPad Air. Much larger screen size (9.7 inches - doesn't sound much but it makes a huge difference). Same fast (A7) chip as the Mini with Retina - the latest and fastest iPad available.Clearly (from my viewpoint) there's only really three options. The iPad Mini, the Mini with retina screen and Air.What are the Optional add-ons?-----------------------------------------Well, assuming you've dropped by the Apple Store or John Lewis (which I would highly recommend), and handled the iPad Mini (with/without retina screen), and iPad Air then your options are around memory size and cellular option.Memory: Once bought, you can't add memory (space for apps, films, books etc). However, the basic price goes up a huge amount (+\u00a380 for the 16g to 32g iPad Air). But, having owned a 16g and then a 32g iPad - I can safely recommend the 16g unless you really want to store a huge amount of videos and downloads. Only you can decide, and if you're lucky enough that money is no object then splash out. Otherwise, 16g should be fine for most people.Celular: Allows you to connect to the internet while you're out and about. This will add an additional +\u00a3100 to the price and means you can slip in a mobile phone SIM card. This means (for an additional \u00a37-15 a month extra), you can access the internet on the move. Alternatively, you can opt for the WIFI option, and use it at home or at at \"hot spot\" (eg. Starbucks, most rail stations and hotels etc).Personally I'd buy (and indeed did), the 16Gb iPad Air WIFI.Do I need anything else?-------------------------------Most people (me included) buy a cover. Apple (and now several copy-cats) make a \"smart-cover\" which automatically shuts down the iPad when you close it, and switches it on when you open it. There's versions which cover the back, or just the screen. Apple charge from \u00a335 to \u00a365 for their (admittedly) high quality fabric or leather covers, but there's many available from \u00a310. Be aware, you do get what you pay for.Personally,I think it's a pity to cover the beautiful aluminium industrial design of the iPad with a cover - but if you've spent hundreds of pounds you'll want to protect it from scrapes and bangs.I also invested in a keyboard (\u00a325-80), as I tend to write a lot of mails and documents (remember it comes with a word processor). I'd recommend the Logitech Ultra Thin iPad Air Case with Keyboard - Space Greyand the ZAGG Keys iPad Air Case Folio with Backlit Keyboard - Black although these are strictly optional unless you want to use your iPad as a proper laptop.Finally, if you have another Apple device (eg. an iPhone, Apple TV or Mac) you'll find these work together beautifully. For example, you can create a reminder on your iPad and it appears on your iPhone. Equally, photos taken on your iPhone appear on your iPad, and you can stream music or videos from iPad, iPhone or Mac to an Apple TV.Some people think this \"locks you in\" - but it's your choice.What's great about the Air?-----------------------------------* Lighter (30%) and thinner than the previous version (469g from 650g)* Even faster A7 chip. Blazingly fast!* Improved sound (compared to the iPad 4)* Software including+ iMovie - edit and publish home made movies+ Numbers - Fully functional Excel for the iPad+ Pages - Word processor+ GarageBand - Play a piano or a drum kit+ iPhoto - Edit and organise your photosWhat's not so great?--------------------------* The change in physical size means you'll need a new keyboard or replacement cover if you're upgrading* Pity Apple didn't include the \"touch ID\" to secure your passwordsOverall Opinion---------------------It's hard to believe the iPad version 1 was released just four years ago, and there's a huge raft of \"me too\" tablet computers to choose from, but the Apple iPad Air is still the one to beat. As \"Which?\" magazine (in the UK) put it - \"...the best tablet we've ever tested. Apple packs a beautiful screen and lightning fast processor into a slimmer-than-ever shell, and battery life is very impressive\".Yes, there are cheaper Android based alternatives, but the quality, design and beauty of this tablet just sets it apart. If it were a car it'd be a top of the range Mercedes or a BMW.Highly Recommended.", "Date": "February 23, 2014"}, {"Title": "Definitely the \"New and Improved\" iPad!", "Author": "Nexia", "ReviewID": "R30LKTO48J90AW", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Just over one week ago I sold my \"New\" iPad 3 with 64GB + Cellular and bought an iPad Air with 32GB + Cellular; I'm glad I did.Here are my basic findings:The new size and weight dimensions of the iPad Air really are great, and I must confess I do understand what all the hype is about in this regard.And on that note, if you are/will be looking for a case for the iPad Air, you might want to choose one that does not bulk it up or weight it down too much. (\"Devicewear\" makes an outstanding case, for example.) But if you need heavy duty protection for your device, robust hard shell options are available.What the iPad Air does it does extremely well, all the more so with the new A7 processor combined with iOS7. There are many iPad Air reviews out there, and I encourage anyone who's in the market for this product to check at least a few of them.Here are my observations after having used my iPad Air for a short period of time:- Though it is a very solid, well made device, I do notice when I'm tapping on the screen (with normal pressure), (while playing \"The Room 2\", for example), that it has a different \"feel\" than my 3 did. To me my 3 felt considerably denser, whereas the Air feels slightly \"hollow\" somehow. But this is not at all a big deal.- The Retina display continues to be excellent, just as it was on the iPad 3 and 4, but it's too bad there's an issue with the color gamut as well as \"ghosting\" on the iPad Mini 2's. I was considering getting one of those, but these issues constituted a deal breaker for me.I know many people are disappointed that the latest iPads do not sport the fingerprint ID feature, but in view of the fact there seems to be so much discussion about it I wouldn't be surprised if Apple includes it on the \"6\".I would have liked to see a camera on the iPad Air higher than 5 mp, (though I understand the picture quality has been enhanced through the use of larger pixels). But more than that I would have really liked to see whatever is there to have a flash, just like on latest iPod iTouch.Size and color:If you're in a quandary about which iPad Air to get, you might want to do an online search for articles such as \"Which new iPad Air or Retina iPad mini storage capacity should you get?\" There are several of these articles out there, and I found virtually all of them to be intelligently, informatively, (and occasionally humorously) written.My story:I previously had a 64GB unit which, honestly, I was hard pressed to fill. And on the occasions when I did manage to fill it up, I found myself accessing only a small fraction of what was there. In my case, as a \"Joe average\" user, 32GB is plenty, whereas 16GB would most certainly not be enough. And yet, were I about to embark on a extended trip somewhere far away where I would not have access to my home PC, I would seriously consider getting a higher capacity iPad in order to have most of my important content with me while traveling. But as long as I can get to my home computer and connect my device to iTunes, 32GB is perfectly fine for me.Regarding color, my previous iPad had a black bezel, and I opted for that on my new Air as well.Rule of thumb:If you want to look \"at\" your eye catching iPad Air, choose the model with the white bezel, bearing in mind the white may show smudges and dirt more.And if you want to look \"into\" your iPad Air, where the bezel \"disappears\" while you're using it, choose the version with the black bezel. But here, according to what I've read, any micro nicks and scratches may be more apparent than on its white bezel sibling.Good luck in your choice, and I hope you find what I have written here helpful.", "Date": "December 28, 2013"}, {"Title": "Perfect size", "Author": "Christina Leatherwood", "ReviewID": "R123IY1PQHYZXG", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I have arthritis in my hands so having a lighter pad is perfect and I've already recommended it to everyone I know.", "Date": "December 14, 2013"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": null, "Features": null, "Name": null, "ImgURL": null, "ProductID": "B00GCRKVZO"}}
