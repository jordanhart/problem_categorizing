No gorilla glass, just hard plastic for the touch screen. Touch response isn't great, and it's nothing near the responsiveness and crispness of the iPhone (an old 3GS has a better response time than this) or high end Android phones. If you have big fingers, I don't recommend this phone. You also can't tilt lock the screen either.The OS is better than BB OS 6 but no where near up to par for 2013; OS 7 can be sluggish. Apps are at a minimal.Design is great. It's piano black, tiny, razor thin and gotta love that red blinking notification light. Email delivery blows iPhone and Android out of the water as well security (it's almost unbreakable and messages are encrypted). Camera is pretty good. Besides that, there's no reason to get this phone for over $250. If you are looking for a secure phone with good email, go with a keyboard OS 7 BlackBerry like the Bold 9900 or the new BlackBerry Z10. They actually did an awesome job with the Z10.", "Date": "April 5, 2013"}, {"Title": "good product and good price , no problems until now", "Author": "Rene Ramos", "ReviewID": "R5QSL2MRE85RZ", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "good product, I have some issue with the sign but this a communication network issueNow lets see if the perfomance is acceptable", "Date": "March 19, 2013"}, {"Title": "Exactly the phone I need", "Author": "Joanna", "ReviewID": "R3OT3CC0536E4D", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I like blackberries, and this one was in excellent price.
