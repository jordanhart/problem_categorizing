Heath", "ReviewID": "RY0PGIH385WMT", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "The Samsung B2100 is a decent phone, and feels good in the hand. I found it difficult to get up and running though. For example, there was no advice on how to migrate an address book from SIM card to phone--the automaticity I was used to just wasn't there. The menus are a bit clunky to move around, but speed dial and short cuts help. The one annoying thing is that the middle selector button immediately connects you to the WAP application and there is no way I have found to change this option. Also, you need to re-configure Time/Date every time you take the battery out--more annoyance. Texting is awkward, and voice slightly muffled, due to the phone's waterporoofing. Forget about using this mobile for Internet browsing--this is NOT a multimedia phone. The flashlight and voice recorder features are very useful, but the radio and music player less so because of the poor jack cover design--see below.Pluses: a really tough phone. Hardware design wise, the only real failing is the flimsy multifunction jack cover, which swings downwards and slightly out, making it vulnerbale to a knock from your hand. The camera works okay, and it is possible to take good snaps in certain conditions. With only 1.3 megapixels picture quality is not great though. Videos also turn out rough. But the reason you buy this phone is for its ruggedness, most particularly the waterproofing. Don't expect much more from it. You can adequately call, text and take snaps in harsh and challenging environments. Therefore, the B2100 is a good choice for manual workers, travellers, fisherpeople etc. If you want multimedia, or any kind of slickness, don't buy this phone.Update: I've been using the Samsung B2100 for a while now and the thing that has come to bother me most is the terrible menu/function design. You have to take so many actions to achieve the simplest of tasks. Dreadful. On the other hand, my copy is still working and can definitely take a knock. Overall, not an everyday phone but handy for rough and tumble situations.", "Date": "April 2, 2010"}, {"Title": "Almost indestructable", "Author": "Kay Wilson", "ReviewID": "R2EXA4BPTZA6SY", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I work as a dive instructor, and I have lost count of the cell phones that have either been 'drowned' or salt damaged in the past 6 years since I started my business.This phone is awesome, it's waterproof as long as the port that covers the battery charging access is firmly in place, so if it should 'go for a swim it's much more likely to survive. My phone has already had a couple of water encounters that would have killed lesser phones.The unit is sealed so I don't have to worry about using it with salty / dirty / oily hands as it can be rinsed off. The case fits nicely in the hand, and the keys are good size.I would recommend this phone for boating, dirty or wet out door pursuits, and even mechanics and other folks involved in jobs where your phone is likely to get mucky!The battery has a pretty good life. The phone also has a torch, the only thing that it lacks is a bottle opener!So impressed am I that I have bought additional phones for my staff / business.", "Date": "February 7, 2010"}, {"Title": "Good phone for travel, so far", "Author": "Mike", "ReviewID": "R35875OP56Z6", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I bought this phone because I travel for work to unpredictable places where you need your phone working. I am in Haiti right now and the phone is working perfectly. Back in the states I use an AT&T; sim in it and it works fine. Here, I popped a DigiCell sim in and no problemo. Phone calls and texting work without a problem.I cover multiple countries from Haiti to Sudan to Pakistan all in different time zones and their is a world clock application that let's me know the time in those places as I scroll through. It's got the other standard applications such as converter (currency, time, temp, etc...), alarm clock and timer, calendar, etc... The flashlight is strong and use it often.I am used to the Nokia set up, so the Samsung is taking a little getting used to going through the menu.I purchased all the peripherals so I can charge it on the go or when there is no wall outlet. The battery life is strong. I have been here one week and still have two bars. So far, looks good. Works well.

Maintains great connection, works like a champ in the Philippines and China by simply installing a country specific sim card and carrier. Volume is good, connects easily with Bluetooth and has some good features. I am even able to sync my MS Office Outlook address book, calendar and notes by simply downloading software from Samsung's support website. Don't buy this phone if you are wanting a smart phone or multi-media phone, it's just a very well done basic phone.Pros: Solid performance, feels sturdy when holding it, small enough to put in your pocket, great MP3 player, menus are easy to navigate, bios can be flashed from Samsung's support website. Holds all personal data even if battery is removed except time and date.  All in all, this phone does everything it should do for its type and is definitely a very rugged phone which is perfect for me.Cons: Only thing I can think of is that I have to update the date and time when the battery is removed. Instruction manual is in Russian, (LOL!) but is easily downloaded from Samsung's website.One additional comment, never order anything if it isn't available through Amazon's fulfillment department, you can rest easy you're getting great service, an actual new phone not a reconditioned one that is advertised as new or an open box item.", "Date": "September 19, 2011"}, {"Title": "The best waterproof phone", "Author": "David K. Mcquillen", "ReviewID": "R1PO1ME6QCZG8E", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Most of the criticisms about this phone are justified.  It is clunky, the menu system is obsolete, the screen is small and it is a European version.  If you are looking for a smartphone this is not for you.  However, if you want a phone that will take abuse and keep working this is the best I have found.  I have been using mine for 3 years on a island in the Pacific Ocean.  It gets soaked daily with sweat, rain and salt spray and has never failed.  Most electronics around here last about a year even if you don't get them wet.  If you want an inexpensive, tough, phone this is the only reasonable choice.  Even the US military contingent here uses them. Others saw my phone and wanted one like it.  Now there are about a dozen around the island, including with the governor.  The only failure was one that was bad out of the box.  More people are asking me to bring them \"a phone like you have\" from the US.  I paid $130 for mine and current price is an incredible bargain.  The speaker is surprisingly loud for music playback.  The SD slot allows these things to double as a music player.  Headphone jack is the non-standard Samsung jack and you need to use headphones(included) for the radio.  This phone is the only one I would consider if I needed another rugged, water resistent, phone(never dropped it in the ocean so can't verify that it is waterPROOF).  My advice is to get it if you value having a phone that works for telephone calls and text under extreme conditions over playing games and a slick interface.  Buy an adapter that changes the charger prongs from European round to US flat for about $2.  (Sometimes the adapter comes with the phone.)  If you can't figure out the menus or how to get it to English, find an 8-year old child to help you.  I will be taking another half dozen back with me from the US for islanders.  By the way, the sister-phone, the Samsung B2710, is not nearly as rugged or water resistent, although it has a nicer screen and keyboard.", "Date": "July 17, 2012"}, {"Title": "great phone", "Author": "scheem", "ReviewID": "RX27OWSVZDIRT", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "i am a construction workeri used to buy wimpy flip phonesthey would junk after 6 monthsthis phone is not afrade of dirtwater or droppingon the groundthe light is very usefull", "Date": "September 9, 2011"}, {"Title": "Great for travel", "Author": "Bogdan R.

Setup is not a problem, the menus are simple and intuitive (wherever other people might say). There's an embedded led that serves as a flashlight, and it functional not just and added gimmick.

Not that I expected that. It is easy to operate as a basic phone, which is all my wife needs. I swapped the SIM from her previous ATT phone to this one and it immediatly worked as expected, with all her contacts in place. Due to the frequent replacement of phones and unexpected failures I have always kept her contacts on the sim card, I make sure to get it replaced every few years so that we have a current version of the ATT SIM card. We do not use the phones internal memory for anything. And it was available in red, which is her favorite color. And it has a flash light. The keys are rubber on a one piece mold, however they stick up like individual keys, and have a reasonable tactile feedback. In my house the previous Samsung phone got only 1 or 2 bars signal, and seemed to have trouble staying connected to the network, however, that may have been a symptom of impending failure. The new phone gets 3 bars or more and does not drop any calls. I am pretty happy with this purchase.

In the age of hand held, everything at your finger tips, smart phones, it's hard to find something that will take the abuse that I'm going to dish out.  I don't plan on submerging the phone. I live in the rainy NW, and I commute by bike everywhere so the water proof/resistance gives me piece of mind that if I drop it in a puddle (or toilet) it will survive. The phone is very sturdy and seems to be holding up after a month of use and doesn't feel like it's going to shatter if I drop it on the floor. The operating system is pretty easy to get used too.  I like past samsung phone operating systems, and I have had a real problem with some phones, but this one works out find. I have not used the phone to store or listen to music, and I don't really plan too. The camera is pretty nice for a brick phone, at least better than expected.My only real complaint is that the buttons are very sturdy therefore hard to push. Especially the middle select key between the direction buttons. Sometimes I will have to press several times. Also the phone is a little slow to respond and I will end up double \"clicking\" because it takes longer than my impatient mind handles.

It both charges the phone and allows access to any items on your memory card and internal memory.2. Samsung menus and browsing around the phone isn't up to par as the old Nokia system.3.

My fault there. It worked fine for almost a week. Then, it stopped, and while it got power, wouldn't go beyond a flashing \"B2100\" on the screen, as others on other sites have reported. I tried to return it to HassleFree, which refused. Some review this phone positively here and elsewhere, although the problem I encountered is also reported. \"HassleFree\" never responded to my request to at least exchange the phone. All I can provide is a cautionary tale to test this phone within deadline. I missed the deadline, but, in fact, \"HassleFree\" delivered a defective device without consequence. When it worked, the phone offered fine old-fashioned texting (multiple hits on a key for some letters), and a number of clicks to get where you want to go. Great flashlight. Mediocre camera, but a camera nonetheless. Feels good in the hand, but buttons on the side can inadvertently activate things you may not want activated when you pick it up. It would be fine for minimalists who want a phone and to send very concise texts traveling. Amazon will NOT cover the cost of this phone through its guarantee, and \"HassleFree\" refused a return and doesn't respond to an exchange request. So, I'm out costs for a defective phone.
