Before buying, i contacted them to be sure that the model offered (GT-I8160L) was compatible with my operator's 3G data service and it was!. Please beware that there are two models for the Ace 2 where the only difference is the 3G band compatibility.Model ------- 3G Bands supportGT-I8160 ---- 900/2100 MHz (Digitel in Venezuela for example. Most operators in Europe use these bands).GT-I8160L --- 850/1900 MHz (AT&T; in USA, Movilnet/Movistar in Venezuela for example. Most operators in the american continent use these bands).At first blush the phone seems to perform great. Nice screen and resolution, android gingerbread (ICS comming soon) and vga front camera.  Worth spending US$ 20-30 more in comparison to the ace and ace plus. Despite the price difference, the phone is still at a good price considering the specs provided.You can't go wrong with this phone.", "Date": "September 13, 2012"}, {"Title": "Will NOT get 3G from T-mobile", "Author": "H.Evans", "ReviewID": "RDSH4MKGKKDUV", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I bought this phone thinking what a great deal for a mid-range smartphone and then found out that it would not support the 3G from T-mobile.  T-Mobile uses the 1700/2100 mhz frequency for their 3G network.  You need the phone to support BOTH frequency in order to get 3G.  Maybe AT&T; supports the frequencies on this phone.

I got the white one.Some high lights:Pros:- Screen size is 3.8\". It has multi-touch and screen detailing is crisp. Phone has a compact size.- Run smoothly on decent specs with dual core 800 MHz processor and 4 Gigs of internal memory. (a bit below the 1GHz on some high end phones with this same processor so this phone is probably underclocked for better battery life).- The phone has 768MB of RAM. (a bit below the 1GB on some high end phones).- Front-facing camera for video conferencing!! This gives the ability to skype or video-gtalk. Also gives the ability to add a face unlock app which is really nice.- Mobile Hotstop for tethering; WiFi Direct.- 1500 mAh battery with very good life. The phone will easily take you through the day with average use - I get 30 to 40 hours on a single charge.- microSDHC up to 32 GBCons:- Gingerbread 2.3.6 (Would have liked to see ICS 4.0x on the newer phones coming out this year, I have seen only one reference to possible Android Ice Cream Sandwich 4.0x upgrade)- Maybe the price is a tad high @ $290 and a lower price of $250 would be more competitive.- Camera could be snappier. Hopefully an update would take care of this.Network: Update 12/04/2012- 2G Network GSM 850 / 900 / 1800 / 1900- 3G Network:GT I8160 - 900/2100 MHz BandsGT I8160L - 850/1900 MHz BandsNote:Amazon list the phone as GT-I8160 but there are actually two models of this phone which have different 3g bands. I ordered the GT I8160 from Open Group Wireless. Check with the vendor for the model number before you order.Overall:This is a nice phone with internal specs just below some of the high end phones.", "Date": "September 14, 2012"}, {"Title": "Great Phone", "Author": "Osman M.", "ReviewID": "R3NZG9BKD7OJTP", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This is a great option for people who doesn't want to spend a lot of money in a phone but still want to experiment the options of a smartphone.", "Date": "July 15, 2013"}, {"Title": "Affordable, Dual core, Android phone.", "Author": "Osiris A. Rosa", "ReviewID": "R1Z4ZIGUP9HONL", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I purchased this phone to use in South America, and yes the previous reviews are true this is the GL-I8160L version of the phone. Which as of this writing of this review, the phone has a official Jelly Bean 4.1.2 update that has been released for this phone model. You can update the phone to Jelly Bean using the Orion loader and the official Jelly Bean update from Samsung-updates website by looking up the exact model number and version. no need to do a lot of crazy configurations or loading custom pit files. I tried updating the phone via KIES software and Over the Air firmware update on the phone itself but was not able too. However once I manually updated the phone it has really been a far more up to date experience than the stock android 2.3.6 Ginger Bread experience which was pretty fast but it lacked the compatibly to do video on Instagram and run newer version of popular apps. The battery life on the phone is pretty good and the over Jelly Bean experience is really smooth. The phone is perfect for travel since it is factory unlocked and it does not attract too much attention to thief's overseas. The best part is the price and power of phone is close to that of the Samsung Galaxy S3 mini. For a budget buyer and world traveler this phone is great. It does almost everything essential that your Galaxy S3 or S4 does but in a smaller package. I would recommend this phone for people who are also looking to upgrade their old outdated phones for a affordable unlocked phone.", "Date": "June 30, 2013"}, {"Title": "Very good", "Author": "suzy", "ReviewID": "RPKG7AHH38J25", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This is a perfect size phone, that I bought for my mom.

It's in perfect condition and fully functional, no problems to activate with the operator. I'm quite pleased with this cell phone because it has many improvements over version S5830 (ACE), in terms of speed (since it is dual core), ergonomics, screen and graphics, also has more storage memory for applications (rather negative aspect in the ACE version). I like a lot the performance of this phone regarding this range and price, and compared to other brands of the same range (like Sony Xperia Miro) is excellent. His design is very attractive and has some similarity to the Samsung Galaxy S3 Mini (Samsung Galaxy I8190) and is a bit thinner than the ACE. I have to confess something I did not like, is that the camera shutter to capture photos is quite delayed, however the image quality is very good. Another negative thing is that the phone did not come with a Micro SD card, maybe no longer manufactures are coming as well.

The calls are loud and clear and I could check my emails via Wifi without needing a data SIM card. Yahoo mail looked better in the android phone as it showed attached images in small preview in the inbox view. The cell phone also downloaded some SW patches and applied after Wifi was setup. The GPS is good, have not tried the navigation feature. The Camera does not have a Zoom feature. Hoping to use the talk app to make free calls over free wifi (home, airport etc)Update July 13---------------Its been a couple of months now. I am still using the phone for making/receiving important calls or when I am away from a landline... not doing much browsing and have not used Google chat yet.  I use Whatsapp app for chat which is free and good. Have not downloaded any apps.I feel I could have got a mobile with larger LCD screen size and higher resolution camera 8 Mp.But those occasions when I miss higher resolution camera are few.....would have been good to have, if not for the high price of such phones. Basically the camera size is correct size for carrying in my pocket, making routine my phone calls, to check my company stock symbol once in a while. to read news online when on free wifi ..... occasional use. mine is a T-mobile prepaid plan... I have accessed online webpage for Google search, travel directions, hotels etc... while traveling. not sure if this was over 3g etc. but web page was slow... possibly due to my prepaid plan. I anyways do not use browser much on the road other than when on wireless networks that are free.I would like to upgrade the mobile to ICE CREAM sandwich android version.

If you store too many apps, let's say you only have 300mb left, that will be your RAM because you have used the rest 700mb to store your apps/docs/pictures.

Two main competitor in this category with similar prices were HTC One V and Galaxy Ace 2. I chose Ace 2 because in most of the review articles about HTC One V authors show low battery life as main con of HTC. However battery life of Ace 2 as I expected is about 1-1.5 day, with less usage it can take up to 2 days. Besides Galaxy Ace 2 provides extra batter in its package box.

The camera is solid (for a phone camera) and the sound quality is really good, both during conversation and music reproduction (I listen to the built in FM radio and MP3s fairly often). The only thing I don't like about it is that it tries to synchronize everything by default, i.e., it wants to merge my phone contacts with my gmail, facebook & skype contacts (oh, the skype app works great on it and the, albeit lower quality, front camera is great for it) which I don't care for (call me old fashioned, but I like to keep my contacts separate).

You need to go into the clock, then go to alarm clock , then go to alarm and THEN create the alarm. I think it could be way more simple if there was a direct acces to the alarm clock, but you can't create it.4.- The front camera could have better resolution.5.- the LED light doesn't blink. Weird because a friend of mine has the GALAXY S II and hers doesn't blink either, so it seems more of a GALAXY issue.But despite of those things, I think this phone is great.

The phone itself is light but seems sturdy and well-built.  Button placement is logical with crisp actions.  However, performing operations beyond dialing on this phone is tedious.  If you have ever owned an old computer on which you installed the latest operating system, you know what I mean.  Having more than one user application open at any given time noticeably slows the entire system.  Make the mistake of using two or more relatively tame applications at the same time and you are likely to freeze the entire system.
