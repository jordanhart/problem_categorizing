Not on this one. Notice above it doesn't say \"Amazon verified purchase\". Why would i pay 20% more when i can buy it at any store at retail for 19.99. Even better to buy it on the tracfone website. You don't even have to wait for it to be delivered. Just enter your phones serial number, and in less than a minute the airtime appears on your phone. Total transaction time; 5 minutes. No card to wait for and not a drop of gas used driving to a store. If amazon sold it for 16, 17,18 dollars; yes. But $25, no way. *Update; After my review was posted, i clicked on \"other buying options\". The next choice after the 24.99 was priced at 34.99!!!.Outrageous. Amazon people, we, your customers, would be better served if you didn't even offer the card, then to allow us to be price gouged by your vendors.

The first was a Nokia that lasted about 6 years and now the last two years I have owned an LG model.  I have purchased enough minutes and days of service that my phone should outlive me easily. The 60 minute card with 90 service days is as cheap as 19.99 so shop around. Once you get the pin just type it into your phone under add minutes and wait a few minutes for it to upload.  You cant beat them. Cheap and very reliable.

That is what this person is charging as I am writing this! You can purchase this at any drugstore or get it online if you want at tracfone.com for $19.99. They also have other offers there. This price is crazy and I don't know how they get a way with it. I think anyone who uses a tracfone anyway should get one with triple minutes. It automatically triples when you enter the code or you can purchase right on your phone. Its well worth the investment! And also, (this happended to me and my daughter) once we purchased from tracfone, a month later we got an email which said you get you now get 220 minutes when you purchase a 60 minute card! Which means you don't even have to have triple minutes!!!!!! Its awesome!!!

Why pay more when you can buy minutes at a local store or through your own phone at a fair price?I would be very careful & look at all your buying options before considering this offer because of the high price.Most people, like me, use a trac phone because of the low price. thats what they are known for, low priced phones, no contracts & cheap minutes. I bought my trac phone for emergencies & it is an excellent phone for that purpose.I am handicapped & have used the help feature ,(911), by pressing one button, several times.

Being naive, I called tracfone to reinstate my phone and I was silly (I will admit it) about that fact that my number had been offline so long that it undoubtedly was reassigned to another person. I paid my money via credit card and expected the 60 minutes that I paid for to be turned magically into 180 minutes and 90 days of service. This is CLEARLY what the sales person on the 800 number explained that I was buying. After a day or so I was unable to get any service so I called the 800 number again. I was greeted by an agent who was polite but unable to do anything about the problem. I asked for a supervisor and eventually, to make a long story short, after a couple of days I was told that I would have to wait 72 hours for my minutes to register. This was after I was sent another SIM card for my phone and given a new phone number and serial number. Apparently at this point my credit card had been used to pay for the original number which had been assigned to someone else. The agents had carefully ensured that I agreed that the money could not be refunded and that I wait 72 hours so that my stinking credit card company (Citibank) had accepted the charge and authorized the payment to tracfone. This also guaraneed that my credit card company would tell me that removing the charge could take up to 120 days to resolve the conflict. Then, the coup de grace was that the tracfone support person told me that the new phone number that they assigned to me , gave me single minutes and was not eligible for triple minutes and 90 days of service - even though that was what they told me I was getting and the exact same phone got triple minutes and 90 days previously. The supervisor REFUSED to give me more than 60 minutes and 60 days of service and wished me well trying to get my money back since I had agreed that money was not refundable. Tracfone seems to be training a ruthless and fraudulent sales force. Call me petty but, a plague upon them and their smarmy support team.", "Date": "January 24, 2014"}, {"Title": "minute card", "Author": "mary Thurston", "ReviewID": "R1SZRPNMLDJ3LB", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I liked this card because it gave you 90 days of service also a very good value for the price", "Date": "December 30, 2013"}, {"Title": "Go elsewhere run as fast as you can", "Author": "Samuel D.
