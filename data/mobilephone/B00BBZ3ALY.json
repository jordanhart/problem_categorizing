I hate touch screens! So glad to have an actual keyboard again. The Elevate is small and easy to navigate has everything I need without alot of useless extras. Keyboard is easy to type on and just big enough. Not the best ringtones but I love it. If it dies I'll get another :) but I hope it stands up well to my abuse", "Date": "January 6, 2014"}, {"Title": "GREAT REPLACEMENT", "Author": "blondlockx", "ReviewID": "RYCO3D577XOCC", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "MY smartphone battery died and I await  A backup until the battery ,.IT serves it\"s purpose quiet well.AT times I enjoy going back in time,what is old is new again.", "Date": "December 15, 2013"}, {"Title": "Great", "Author": "haha", "ReviewID": "R3CK7IY269C2AQ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "The Samsung Elevate is simple to use.

When I went to the store to switch it out the ATT SIM card does not fit this phone.  The contacts can't be transferred.  The Customer Rep had to make me a new SIM card to replace the one that came with the phone.  I get the phone home and the Voicemail function does not work. Reading the instructions to go to \"Voicemail Tutorial\" when I get that far it requires a name and address to access the tutorial.  Well, what name?  what address?  Not my own because the selection doesn't allow it. The SPEAKER ON/OFF button is backwards!  And it defaults to SPEAKER ON when incoming calls come in.  I do not like this phone and sadly have to say bought it on the reviews I read.  If it worked properly and was compatible I may have felt differently but this phone is messed up.", "Date": "October 16, 2013"}, {"Title": "good replacement", "Author": "E.
