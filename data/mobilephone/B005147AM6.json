Works great with bluetooth, has a lock on the keypad to keep mishaps from happening if I drop it in my handbag.  I may order another before to long, when there is a great phone it seems like they don't stay around long.  The battery life is excellent. I charge mine once every three to four days.  I am a medium user, talk some, text some, so the phone is far better than what I had before.  Battery life was my first concern, did not want to have to recharge everyday, with this one I do not, the speaker works well without problems, the sound quality is very good, volume is easy to up or down (button on the side) if you want camera quality then this phone does not take pics like the iphone, but its decent, if your more concerned about getting reception and good connection then this phone is for you.", "Date": "January 3, 2012"}, {"Title": "Great phone", "Author": "T.

No, it's not a smartphone, but it does exactly what I need it to do. I'm always using mine to send pictures to Facebook and I have to say that it takes some pretty good pics.

Maitland \"Austin\"", "ReviewID": "RNMMU7YII0E9E", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Bought this phone a year ago and have really enjoyed it!  It is an outstanding basic messaging phone that has most of the key features one would want in a basic cell phone.  The camera does not take video, but takes a decent picture for on the go.  Texting is exceedingly easy because of a nice full keyboard and a very handy and useful shortcuts toolbar on the home screen.  This toolbar allows for placement of the features you would use most on the phone and is customizable.  Features such as calendar, camera, inbox, create a message, music player can all be added here.  The calendar is very easy to use and works well.  With school becoming increasingly busy, I have gotten in the habit of using this, and it has been great.  Bluetooth works well for file transfers, great address book.  Biggest drawbacks include lack of \"real\" music player.  By this I mean the phone will play individual audio files it finds, but you have to arrange the files into playlists that only hold 50 songs to string any number of songs together without having to close out and choose the next song file.  There is no separation of artists, song names, etc.  Also, when viewing photos taken by the phone, the picture you are reviewing is limited to a very small space within the screen, with no options to take advantage of the entire display.  This makes the photo so small it is necessary to send to a computer to see any amount of detail.  Other than this, the phone is great for a heavy texter!", "Date": "March 18, 2012"}, {"Title": "Very Nice Phone and EXCELLENT Customer Service", "Author": "Lisa Houserman \"It ain't dying I'm talkin' ab...", "ReviewID": "R1F436IB0EDRXZ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I bought this phone through Amazon but it was sold by Unlocked Cell Phone Kings Inc.

It is very light weight, and the materials used are extremely thin and flimsy.  You kinda know it's not going to last as soon as you take it out of the box.  I got this for my daughter, and it started dropping calls, and turning itself off after a few weeks of use.  It then started the annoyting habit of scrambling the screen, so nothing could be read.  It developed a buzzing noise that was very disruptive while in the midst of a call.  There are so many low priced phones that are undoubtedly better than this one.  I took it in to T Mobile to purchase a SIM card, and they said it was a promotional for ATT that got very poor ratings and was not offered for long because of it's inferior manufacture and service.

Within two months, it started acting weird again.  Stuck in some kind of loop that would not allow you to call out, only receive calls.  Took it in again to their repair place and this time they could not fix and said I would have to buy a new one. In short - it sucks.  Take a chance if you like to gamble.

I'm back & ready to review.Bottom line...it worked in France, it's OK for a few weeks a year but I wouldn't want it for my full time phone.The phone's keys extend beyond the flat surface of the keyboard so it is easy to accidentally key something while in your pocket. So I'd buy a hard case for it.I only used three capabilities...talk, texting & the alarm.  I did store local phone numbers & that worked.  Did not try the camera.Talking was fine, battery life fine.  Knowing which key to press next to accomplish a task is not very intuitive. Activating the speaker works once you figure it out.  Speaker volume fine.For texting, you write the message first, then add the phone numbers.  That's backwards from my USA phone.  Several times while adding phone numbers, I thought of something to add to the message but couldn't go back.  Saving as a draft seemed too time consuming.I could never get the alarm to work.  The manual supplied is very inadequate. I even went to the Samsung website & downloaded their full manual, but that was no help either.The unit is labelled an ATT phone & and an ATT start screen comes up even though it's unlocked.  My guess is that ATT set specification changes to the standard A187 that makes it non-standard.  This happened with my W385 Motorola with Verizon...it's not really a W385.All in all, it remains 3 stars for my purposes.  It works in France with a French SIM card for my limited uses.

She called me and the sound quality was very good, actually better than her previous, more expensive phone. The only drawback were the keys and how small they are, but she has nimble fingers so not a problem for her.  She said she could see how someone might be frustrated with key size if they had larger fingers.  She has had a few people mistake her new phone for a Blackberry, it is that good looking. She said the other features of the phone are good, camera is just ok but at this price, amazed there is a camera.Our family has owned several Samsung cell phones over the years, and they have been sturdy and reliable phones.So far so good!

If you are looking for a nice looking phone that you can make calls on and text from, this is it! I read another review that said their phone gets mistaken for a blackberry, very true. The pictures really don't show how nice this phone is. Has a good weight without being heavy, very clear screen res., calls are crystal clear even with the bluetooth, the buttons seem small but I have had no problem with them so far. I can see a large handed person having a tougher time. I use my fingertips or short edge of my fingernail with no problems at all.If you have ever had a cell phone any cell phone before this, the menu and phone functions are very easy to use and figure out without reading the book. I had a prepay verizon razor phone and now have this and I had zero problem figuring it out.I don't know what else to say,been using it for a month I am enjoying this phone alot! I did buy it from newegg at about $40 great price for a great phoneUPDATE: 2/2013Still a awesome phone. I don't use it for \"smartphone\" options just phone and text. Not a single problem yet. I actually enjoy this way more, when I text , than my daughters iphone. I don't have to deal with that whole text correcing crude she does...meaning because of the keypad on the front of the phone I just type and like magic my words turn out just like I typed them!! wow just imagine it ;)OK seriously though it has been a great phone and I am really happy I went with this.", "Date": "May 17, 2012"}, {"Title": "Very good functional phone, just some minor annoyances with some features", "Author": "nyc411", "ReviewID": "RAAHWGMRA9GLH", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I've been using this Samsung cell phone for almost 6 months. If you're looking for a no-frill, functional cell phone for phone calls only, this Samsung phone does the job. I don't use text messages, so I cannot comment about its text message features. Definitely buy a silicon cover for this cell phone, prevent slippery phone.I've previously used Nokia cell phone for more than a decade. It takes some getting used to Samsung's design logic.1) I hate that Samsung sets restriction on Contact info list. I can't store long address, or multiple address, or multiple e-mail address in the Contact info list like I used to do with the Nokia cell phone. Some friends and family members have more than one mailing address (or long addresses).  I've used the Nokia cell phone for 7 years until the hearing piece malfunctioned - forcing me to turn all phone calls into speaker-phone calls, no privacy in phone calls. Otherwise, I would have kept using the old Nokia phone. Now, I'm afraid to wear my Samsung phone on my neck because it looks a bit like Blackberry phone (or when the Samsung phone is flipped to its back side, it looks like a smartphone). As you know, many robbers are stealing iPhone and Android smartphones from people on the street.2) I cannot manually lock my Samsung cell phone when putting it in my handbag, I need to be gentle with my handbag or wait about 1 minute for the Samsung cell phone to self-lock itself before putting it in my handbag. The Nokia cell phone allowed user to manually lock cell phone to avoid unintentionally speed-dialing when putting it aside in a bag or pant pocket. The lack of manually lock phone feature is a minus for Samsung cell phone.3) The keypads are extremely small for anyone with big fingers. I have small fingers but sometimes I still find it hard to type on small keypads. I also spent some time (via trial & error) to figure out how to use the keypad to type symbols and signs. The user manual that came with the packaging seem to be missing a big chunk of the user manual instructions. I went to Samsung's website to see the user manual online which contains many more pages. But still, the user manual seems incomplete.4) Some nice features: Stop watch, timer, measurement converter for length, width, height, weight, volume, area (convert to & from metric system), tip calculator and regular calculator. BUT, I must say the currency converter is useless because it doesn't update currency conversion rates on periodic basis. Best to know the currency conversion rates, then use the regular calculator to convert the currency yourself.5) Althought I have a USB cable for this Samsung, the pictures I took on this cell phone doesn't get transferred to my computer. I heard you have to use a memory card to save your pictures, then use the indirect method to transfer pictures to computer. Since I don't subscribe to cell phone internet services, I don't have the option to e-mail the pictures from my cell phone.Overall, this Samsung does the job for receiving and sending phone calls. There are minor annoyances as stated above, but I can live with them.", "Date": "May 15, 2012"}, {"Title": "Great phone", "Author": "B.
