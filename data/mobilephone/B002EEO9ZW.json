I came across this phone and loved it. Well, two months later I still like it but I am definitely buying me another blackberry. The biggest reasons are that this phone does dial numbers while in the pocket(unlike the iphone where you slide the bar to unlock, there is only a button to push and if you push it twice it will automatically dial last number called or received), it is definitely not a music player because the search function sucks, and it takes awhile to read the memory card. All in all if you are not using it for multimedia and you like to carry your phone on your waist this phone would be perfect!", "Date": "September 16, 2009"}, {"Title": "Disappointed!!!!!!!!!!!", "Author": "Alicia", "ReviewID": "R1J5Q66UE9TLXK", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "I am giving this item 2 stars because at first it worked fine but after about 5 months it just stopped was not even turning on and unfortunately no warranty and i am overseas....guess u get what you paid for....", "Date": "June 19, 2013"}, {"Title": "excelent phone", "Author": "\u00c1lvaro D\u00edaz", "ReviewID": "R19C6ZCCH7N8PP", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I got this phone because i needed one that was cheap and kinda cool. Bought it a year ago, and it works awesome. The screen has a good sensibility and i liked the fact that you can have a qwerty keyboard when writing messages.
