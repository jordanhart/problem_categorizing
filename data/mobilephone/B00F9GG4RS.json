I guess it's Venezuelan based on some the above questions. It shipped from NYC though. I use NET 10 on this one.Included in the branding are some TIM apps that you can't delete, which is unfortunate.Better than the Chinese branded one that I returned before buying this one, though. Apparently in China the phone itself (the Y300-0100) is slightly different: only one camera, two SIMs slots, and no flash.The one from this seller DID include all these features.I bought another one of these phones for myself from Best Buy and I would suggest going that route. It's actually unlocked, includes all features and no carrier branding. It'll cost you a little more though.", "Date": "February 14, 2014"}, {"Title": "excellent", "Author": "YENNY V.", "ReviewID": "R2HUC360ZE43R9", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I purchased the phone came just in time, it works perfectly and I am very satisfied with the purchase.

It takes about 20 seconds to switch from front camera to back camera. It's so annoying, also it could be better if the had the default apps like other phones. I have a plan of 2.5 GB and guess what? The first two weeks I been using it has been working good but now, it sucks.
