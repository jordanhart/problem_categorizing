{"Reviews": [{"Title": "best smartphone out there", "Author": "J. J. Tan \"audiophile/enthusiast\"", "ReviewID": "R2D0D8IUTRMAA7", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "first a comparison to the e61i: i had both the e61 and e61i and this is a major improvement over both. the form factor is incredible as it is only 10mm thin, much narrower than its predecessors, and feels very solid and sleek with its all metal body. the phone is just beautiful to look at. nokia has improved its processor greatly and the phone has almost no wait time with all its functions now. when i went back to use the e61i, it was unbearably slow compared to the e71. the keypad on the e71, although a little cramped, feels good on the fingers. one of my biggest complaints about the e61i was that earphone speaker was hard to hear out of, but the e71's narrower body and seemingly louder speaker solves the problem. the e71 has also added a microUSB port, and 2.5mm earphone jack. in terms of software, the e71 has an updated symbian os that includes some additional features and programs that were pleasant to see. the biggest program improvements for me was the updated organizer and the shortcut key options. for all e61 and e61i users out there, the e71 is a must update to nokia's wonderful line of phones.comparison to competitors: function-wise, it has all the features blackberry's and the iphone 3g have. however, the e71 is much smaller than both (just put the e71 side to side with the blackberry curve and the iphone and they both look like monsters compared to the e71). i have no complaints with the 3g and 3.5g (umts/hsdpa), and I'm not sure what the other reviewer was talking about-- it must be a network/area dependent problem. i live in the SF bay area and i almost always connect to the 3.5g network with att and the internet is extremely fast, comparable to web browsing on a computer with broadband cable access. i really dont like the all touch screen of the iphone, so i would never consider it. i was debating between the curve and e71, but e71 beats it in both function and form-factor. the e71 has a umts/hsdpa, 3mp camera, and better battery life. all the rest (OS mainly) is just up to personal preference.concluding remarks: if you ask \"why should I get the e71\", i would answer with these points based on what \"I\" feel is most important:- very fast 3G capability- excellent size, feel, and look,- speedy processor with no lag in navigation- improved OS and great computer connection software (nokia pc suite)- long battery life- 3MP camera with flash- comes with carrying case, carrying strap, stereo earphones, and data cable- and lastly, did i mention that this is the most beautiful i have ever seen? see one for yourself (i know its hard b/c they dont really have them in stores) and you will love the look and feel of it.", "Date": "August 12, 2008"}, {"Title": "Things I wish I knew beforehand...", "Author": "J. Sullivan \"linux zealot\"", "ReviewID": "R3LEBZ54TOM9QJ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Some notes to consider for this phone:3G -- Despite Amazon saying this is the US Version of the phone (which it is,) this phone does NOT work with T-mobile 3G in the US. T-Mobile 3G in the US uses the 1700 mhz spectrum (you can read on wikipedia as for the reasons why) and there are no 3G roaming agreements with AT&Ts; 3G spectrum like there is with EDGE. That being said, I have found that EDGE is fast enough for my web browsing and e-mail use (220 kbps+.) Using GSM/EDGE only also more than doubles your battery life, so this is not an entirely bad thing for T-Mobile users. The 10 hours talk-time and 17 day standby is no joke with GSM either.Network Settings -- Nokia has a great website that will text you all the internet, voicemail, and MMS settings for your carrier to the unlocked phone.Bluetooth Tethering -- This phone does not tether with Mac OS 10.4 Tiger. It does tether perfectly with 10.5 Leopard. It tethers with Windows XP via included Nokia PC Suite.  It would be nice if a Mac suite were included from Nokia but Apple provides everything necessary with Leopard. It obviously tethers perfectly with Nokia N800/N810.GPS -- The GPS in the phone is first class with both an actual GPS receiver and assisted GPS through cell tower. It works much better than my TomTom One especially indoors. The phone comes with a great program called Maps but the only drawback (and it is a HUGE drawback) is that you have to pay a monthly fee to use any sort of route guidance. You're allowed to see your position and browse maps for free but if you want to plan a route it costs extra. It comes with a 7 day trial that you should save for emergencies in my opinion.Networks in General -- This phone works great on both AT&T; and T-Mobile but each has their drawbacks. AT&T; has the faster network but limits you to 5Gb/month bandwidth and charges extra to tether. T-Mobile allows actual unlimited data on EDGE and allows free tethering to any device but has the slower \"2.75G\" EDGE data network. Wifi is available on the phone and works flawlessly.Third Party Apps -- Two must have apps are the S60 Divx player and the Slick IM client (AIM, Jabber, Etc.) The Nokia mail client works great and a third party solution is not necessary.All in all this is a first class phone whose only missing feature is a touch screen. Depending on your need for a QWERTY keyboard I would say this and the N95 are battling it out for best phone in the world right now.", "Date": "September 26, 2008"}, {"Title": "This phone saved me $70 per month", "Author": "Rodney H. Diramos \"Techie Monster\"", "ReviewID": "R3A1E28NE446BF", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "As the first phone to run on the US 3G network (and in some areas even faster 3.5 G), I was wondering how well this would work as a modem for my laptop for accessing the internet.Guess what? I'm using this regularly now to connect my macbook to the internet! I'm giving up my mobile aircard (which costs about $ 70 per month) and I'm just using my unlimited mobile internet. Another positive - no need to take out the usb aircard dongle and insert it into the side of the laptop each time I need to use it!The connection is fast enough to download video and music (you tube etc. will work fine both on the phone and the tethered mac) but the phone gets hot when it's used as a modem. It also uses a lot of power so for long time use as a modem, I'd keep it plugged into the charger.Joikuspot is the software I used ($ 25 for a perpetual license) to tether my phone to the macbook so I can use internet.I'm happy that MS office comes built in. I'm able to import my financial worksheets (even big ones where I do financial modelling) and it still works fast.Fring works well on these phone - much better than on the Nokia N95. With Fring and my Skype call-out account, I can carry on telephone conversations with almost as much clarity as using my skype on the laptop.  In the N95 (which is also a great cellphone), the processor isn't fast enough to allow phone conversations - the voice quality is so degraded that it's barely understandable. Apparently, Nokia placed a very powerful processor in this machine.And since it has a fast processor, all the applications open almost instantly and my cousin, a Blackberry curve user was so impressed with the speed he said it's the next phone he'll get.Another excellent software I like using with this phone is my Salling Clicker. I use it for remotely controlling itunes in my laptop (like when there's a party and I was to change albums or artists from my phone) or clicking to the next slide in my powerpoint presentation or fast forwarding my DVD player to the next chapter.This is a lot of technology for the money and I highly recommend it to everyone!", "Date": "October 18, 2008"}, {"Title": "After the hype... still one of the best!", "Author": "Judge J Drhedd", "ReviewID": "R2MHN2VGIZLC8", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Ive used this E71 for three months now. Im over my initial high, so here are comments from after the honeymoon:1) keys are small; needs practice. better to type in one hand. it's like learning to use a typewriter for the first time, but youll get used to it in about three weeks of constant use. set aside the backup phone in the mean time. cant practice by instinct if you have a second phone, for that second number, with conventional keys. youll just be confused.2) leather case is badly thought of. awkward when you take the phone out. high probability to drop the phone when you pull it out in a hurry. dropped mine several times while driving... i know it's bad to do this but there you go.3) the red dot for the power button is weirdly misplaced. seems Nokia ran out of same-colored plastic while making this phone, then suddenly saw red plastic remnant from another model. weird but I LOVE IT. brings character to this model.4) there's a nifty autofocus feature. while in camera mode, press letter t. it substitutes for the half-press in digicams (why is this instruction not in the manual?)5) there's also a white balance option in the camera. amazing to have that shade option.6) signal seems to be fluctuating in this phone. I have a second phone, under the same network, which reads a stable high bar, while E71's reception is jumping from 1 bar to four wildly. (is this a hardware or software problem)7) no blackberry support. demmit, you two companies get your act together.8) great for internet browsing.9) i wish there is an indication somewhere to make sure that youre using wifi while surfing; not the expensive network.10) FANTASTIC battery juice.11) after charging from power off, do not power on immediately. seems to hang (coming from power off) that way.12) definitely reasonably priced13) when you open your appointment note and clicked again, does not automatically turn to edit note (unlike in the e51)14) should have had that separate ctrl key to have that full ctrl+v, ctrl+z, ctrl+x, full-keyboard experience.15) not much annoying lags. very responsive.16) i like very much that the screen turns off after some time to save power. just have to press middle button to see time or if there are any missed calls and messages.17) also do not turn on while charging. (coming from off). seems to hang.Great investment overall. But as you can glean, still has a big room for improvement... some of it just firmware-based perhaps.", "Date": "September 16, 2008"}, {"Title": "Best of Breed, but....", "Author": "Jim Johnston", "ReviewID": "R10M7T068Q67PW", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This is the most versatile smartphone on the market but it isn't for everyone. It took me a month of trial and error and of Internet searches to learn how to make all the features work. But for what I wanted, nothing else on the market compares.  The Nokia E71's competitors are the iPhone and the Blackberry, but unlike its competitors, Nokia makes unlocked phones.  This means the E71 can be used on any GSM network and, more importantly, it means you don't have to sign up for the expensive data plans of cellular phone companies unless you are sure you need them. This was important to me because I wasn't sure that I did. And after two months, I have found that I almost never do. Owning the E71 is like picking from the ala carte menu at a restaurant rather than ordering the full course meal.  You can pick which services you want from your cellular carrier on a daily basis, if you want, without committing yourself to two-year contracts and hundreds of dollars in fees.As with other smartphones, the E71 serves as phone, PDA, MP3 player, GPS device, and low-resolution video camera all wrapped into a cellphone-sized package with Internet access, email, and games thrown in to boot.  Let me give the specifics that were important to me.  First is GPS.  After you buy the phone, you go to the Nokia Web site and download for free the mapping software and maps you need. I downloaded a complete U.S. map. This means, when I walk outside and invoke the GPS function, the E71 will spend a few minutes calculating my location and then track my movements on a map. I was on an Interstate the other day and the phone announced that I was exceeding the speed limit.  If you want turn by turn directions, you have to subscribe on a monthly basis either from Nokia or from your carrier, but if you are like me and can get close to where you want on your own and only need help with the last few blocks, the E71 will does that for free. Or, if you are lost, it will show you where you are on a map and you can take it from there.  Second, if you want to go online over WiFi at hotspots, the E71 can do that. I wanted something to carry in my pocket at home to alert me to email so I wouldn't have to keep checking my computer. The E71 can use \"push\" email through WiFi, so whenever you establish a WiFi connection it will check your email and play a tune of your choosing when email arrives.  Third, there are times when having a cellular data connection comes in handy. The E71's can calculate its GPS position in seconds with a few kilobytes of download from the cellular carrier instead of the minutes needed to make that calculation on its own. Or if you are bored and want to check your email and there's no WiFi around, you can tell the E71 to use a cellular network.  Now, if you take an unlimited data plan from your carrier - and AT&T; requires this for the iPhone and Blackberry - the cost is $30 per month.  But AT&T; sells kilobytes for a penny.  So, getting my GPS position quickly cost me 6 cents and downloading five emails cost about the same. This is why I concluded that I don't need an unlimited data plan from my carrier.  Someone who regularly needs Web access is probably better off with an unlimited data plan.  Fourth, the quality of Nokia products has always been unsurpassed, and the E71 is no exception.  The MP3 player is better than the Sansas I own.  The camera shouldn't be compared to a dedicated digital camera, but it's perfectly fine for a cellphone camera.  The screen is smaller than the iPhones, but I shouldn't need to tell you that.  The E71 is somewhat smaller and a lot more rugged.  Its battery is user-replaceable and lasts longer than most other smartphones.  Plus, a battery costs about $10, so you can carry a spare if you want.  There is a learning curve with the E71 that many will not like.  As I said, it took me almost a month to get the features I wanted functioning.  What is more, not all those functions are intuitive, and some take too many button presses.  But the phone seems less dumbed down than its competitors, so that although it may take some time to figure out how to make it do what you want, you don't have to fork out more money for special software applications to do these things for you.", "Date": "August 25, 2009"}, {"Title": "Nokia E71: Long Term Impressions", "Author": "Trentonn Smith", "ReviewID": "R19MBHFDY57H4B", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Wow! I think it is safe to say that this Nokia E71 device of mine has definitely been an instrumental part of my daily life and will remain as such for a LONG time to come. One primary reason for being with this particular model for an extended period of time may be my inability to afford new phones, but nonetheless I actually LIKE and PREFER this model even to my E90 Communicator!The slim profile, solid build quality, acceptable weight, tactile qwerty, word completion, exceptional reception and sound, useful apps, GPS, wifi, bluetooth, and North American 3G support have made this device one of my most prized possessions. I had dropped this phone twice in past months onto concrete and one time even had it slip out of its leather case, but the metallic exterior held up quite nicely and only shows a slight scratch on the upper right corner. At an overall glance my E71 is still in pristine condition as I use it every day of the week for home, school and even fitness. I cannot say enough how much of a benefit it has been to have a capable ESeries device that is light, portable and pocketable, and I haven't used a belt clip holster in MONTHS since I have owned it and don't plan to get one anytime soon!What can I say about the qwerty other than it's a perfect compromise for being narrow yet retaining perfect tactile feedback for my messaging needs? Not much. Over the weeks of usage I have become proficient in quickly typing on the keys to churn out texts, emails, documents and notes in the most efficient way possible (with copy/paste ability included), and a big thanks can also go to the word completion software that Nokia has included in the E71. Why Nokia hasn't added this feature to the E90 in the latest firmware upgrade is beyond me, but I am happy to have it on my E71 and have no complaints. Being so familiar with the qwerty is indeed a good thing, and I recently learned from Howardforums.com users how to dial phone numbers with letters such as 1800-TOSHIBA or 1800-MYAPPLE. The qwerty bar form factor is extremely great in regards to performing on the go in the midst of my ongoing activities, since I don't have to worry about opening or sliding anything to type a simple response message.Sound quality on calls has never been an issue with my Nokia devices in past and present, and this E71 continues that legacy. Infact, if I didn't know any better I would say that the implementing of 3G has actually enhanced the reception quality of my E71 in comparison to my EDGE-only E90. Inside my condominium there are two dead spots for my network signal and I have no idea why, but EVERY single past phone that I have owned would fall victim to those dead spots with dropped calls and weakened reception...yes, even the E90. However, that had all changed once I started using the E71 with AT&T; 3G and I am pleased to claim that the dead spots inside my own home are NO MORE!! I can finally email attachments, send texts and make calls without having to find a window or go outside onto my terrace!! If this isn't reason enough to stay devoted to this device through thick and thin, then I don't know what is.Out of all of these apparent pros for the E71, what stands out the most in my usage is the useful functionality of the available applications that add more to a great user experience! Google Maps has saved me plenty of times in either finding my way through unfamiliar areas or connecting me with local businesses via thorough searching capability. Nokia Podcasting has provided an alternate way to stay current on some of my favorite podcasts such as This Week in Tech and The MobileTech Roundup. Internet Radio is simply amazing for when I need a departure from the 920 audio tracks on my 6GB microSD card. The S60 web browser is a terrific alternative in efficiently navigating the Internet with a non-touchscreen phone, and the inclusion of flash video support has been such a worthwhile feature for Nokia to implement! The calendar being updated to reflect the double-pane interface I first saw on the E90 Communicator has lent to quick managing of appointment scheduling. My most favorite application by far has got to be the impressive Nokia Sports Tracker that I use on my 5 mile runs to track my course via GPS along with other data. After completing the workout I can then upload the information DIRECTLY to my account on the beta online service for all to see, essentially doing the same thing my iPod nano does with the Nike Sport Kit without a computer!!! A third party application named Missing Sync for Symbian is a GODSEND and is worth EVERY penny from a Mac owner looking for a reliable sync utility for their Nokia device!! Since day one of installing it on my laptop and phone I have relied completely on the automatic bluetooth proximity syncing between my E71 (even my E90) and MacBook Pro with no problems whatsoever!Another pro that cannot be ignored is the new interface of the home screen. Being able to initiate communication with ANY of my contacts by typing their name from the home screen is such a time saver. So much so that I have completely forgotten about the voice dialing capability! Having new notifications for missed calls, incoming texts and voicemails posted at the bottom of the home screen for easy access is another convenient addition.Easy to reach home keys for home, calendar, contacts and messaging that can also be programmed for long press commands offer great ease in quickly accessing information when needed. The iconic d-pad with the built-in notification light is GENIUS!! Having a screen saver that shows the time of the day in HUGE font has come in handy for me more than I thought, especially on those mornings when I've had to get up early!I can admit that the Symbian operating system is a challenge for any first time user, but with time and patience anyone can master confident and speedy navigation of its menus. Due to my E71's processor, speed has always been at a high standard whenever I would have to go through the interface or multitask with numerous open apps. For instance, in the midst of writing this blog email and playing music from the speaker this E71 continues to alert me of incoming messages and emails! Even two phone calls were accepted, and once I hung up the E71 took me back to my email draft and resumed the playback of my music without missing a beat!!While there is so much to be thankful for in owning this E71, I would be lying if I said there was no compromising to be made with certain features. Firstly, the 3.2 megapixel autofocus camera, though tolerable, is not up to the same level as the E90 in regards to low light settings and video capturing. Still pictures taken in low light reveal a grainy appearance that is an inconvenience when being viewed in full resolution on a computer screen, and video footage is not at the same TV quality 30 frames per second as the E90. However, over time I have learned that having an outstanding phone, reliable PDA, and suitable multimedia features come first before a perfect phone camera since I have a Canon SD750 anyway. Secondly, the external speaker in mono took a while to get used to after the amazing stereo performance of the E90, but its LOUD volume and clarity of sound had won me over. I had also found that since the speaker is at the top of the E71, it isn't muffled by my hands while I am typing on the qwerty like on the E90. If I was picky I could even mention the lack of a 3.5mm headphone jack, but I have an iPod for music and am not a fan of talking on headsets anyway. With this in mind I conclude that even though some things could use a bit of improvement, they are still tremendously worlds ahead of offerings from certain competitors such as Windows Mobile.As of now I do offer my sincere apologies to Nokia. I had previously brought critiques against the Nokia Email beta app due to the Sent folder not updating properly. It turns out that the Sent folder must be enabled in the settings to start syncing with the server, and once I did all has been working perfectly!I must admit that so far the Nokia Email application has been a great addition to my E71 in managing incoming emails. The interface is quite vivid and professional looking and provides a much welcomed departure from the plain aesthetics in the old Messaging app, which still handles my SMS and MMS messages. As a huge fan of the Outlook Mobile on Windows Mobile devices, I am pleased to say that for the first time on my Nokia I am starting not to miss it.There are a couple of features that I do enjoy about the Email beta which have made my transition from the original S60 Messaging app most comfortable. The auto completion of potential email contacts while typing in the recipients fields and the organized layout of the Inbox folder really give me the impression that Nokia knows what its doing. I am certain that further accomplishments in software development from the Symbian Beta teams will continue to take place, and I am excited to see them all come to fruition.I can really see myself with this model permanently. Now that I am off the market as a buyer of new phones, I notice that there really isn't anything out there that is currently a worthy upgrade to what my E71 can do for me. Seeing the same old mediocre offerings from Windows Mobile devices as well as the apparent iPhone copycats has caused me to grow bored of the smartphone industry to a point. I recently read a review on the new Google G1 that didn't really cast a favorable impression and the Palm Treo Pro didn't come out on top for me either. At the end of the day I got what I wanted from Nokia in the E71, a suitable alternative to my E90 that is more adaptable for my everyday use. Until a competing conglomerate can manufacture something that fits or surpasses this standard, I am sticking to my E71 all the way in the midst of the mediocre predictability of today's smartphone industry.TRENTSent from my Nokia E71-2", "Date": "December 9, 2008"}, {"Title": "A very solid business phone", "Author": "Matt", "ReviewID": "R49V5DXBV5EW3", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I've been searching for a solid business smart phone for some time. The key criteria was first and foremost solid phone reception in an area that can have spotty coverage due to many hills plus strong battery life. I also needed solid syncing capability to my work calendar (Oracle Calendar), a very strong web browsing experience, and well designed contacts and call management. I must say that the Nokia e71 has excelled in each of these areas and the battery life is amazing (2 days solid with no charging). The main screen (Home Screen) is very well designed and more customizable than any other smart phone I have seen including the iPhone (which I also like very much). The extent to which this phone and its menu options can be tailored to meet your unique needs is impressive. The keyboard is small but eminently usable and the weight and thinness of this phone is incredible. This is one phone that I carry in a pouch in my pocket and not on my belt -- which is a first. The speaker phone is very decent ... not as strong as a Blackberry I used previously ... but respectful. And the call clarity and reception is a major plus for this phone. I loved my iPhone but dropped calls more than I would have preferred. Not so with this phone ... I've gotten consistently good reception. The included web browser is very usable and Opera Mini is also excellent (a free download). The email client on this phone -- which I use for IMAP4 -- is decent but I find it can occasionally be slow in updating or syncing with my corporate e-mail. Also, the calendar sync works well, but there is no auto-sync capability (you have to initiate the sync directly although that's easily done). Not a deal killer for me, but the email functionality needs some further refinement (perhaps a firmware update is coming on this one) and Nokia really does need to add an autosync feature for the syncml client so it can for example run once in the morning and once in the evening without user intervention to keep your phone's calendar in sync with the office. But in the end, there is no perfect smart phone ... but this seems to me to be one of the most solid one's out there based on my own extensive research and hands on testing. Excellent build quality, very rich functionality, and a reliable phone connection. I'm well satisfied. Nokia seems to have a winner here and if you have a Mac, the sync support to the Mac platform is an added plus. Good luck in your search for the perfect phone!", "Date": "September 20, 2008"}, {"Title": "Not bad, overall", "Author": "Todd M.

I needed an all purpose phone for use in corporate (read that as Microsoft Exchange) environment.While I found the iPhone to be otherwise great, I had some major issues with it - Lack of real Keyboard  just does not work well for lots of email/sms typing. Next the Exchange support was too late, too little (Exchange Account did not work for me ever and Calendar/Reminders was a problem when using Exchange over IMAP), Battery life was unbearably bad, and lastly the iPhone did not support Bluetooth stereo headphones.So I tried Blackberry Bold - only to find out that the browser on it was not anywhere near as good as the iPhone but the real problem was that it needed a BlackBerry Data plan before it could do anything - no mails, no Internet even when connected to Wi-Fi - and my corporate data plan does not include BlackBerry Data Plan - Bummer!Enter Nokia E71 - I am happy to report it has solved all my problems. The browser on this phone is based on the same WebKit engine that Apple uses in Mobile Safari. I found website compatibility to be excellent. Most importantly however, it comes with Flash! Most flash sites work well - but not all, as this is  a Flash lite version. There is also a Youtube client freely available that works amazingly well.Battery life on this phone is really great compared to the iPhone or any other smart phone - I can easily get through a heavy-use day (3G calling, Some music over bluetooth, Always on Exchange Sync) and even go for another day with lighter use.If you use Exchange for email - you will find the E71 does Exchange very well. Setup was very straight forward, I could customize the sync schedule to be always on during working hours and every 1 hour off-peak. The newest version of the Nokia Mail for Exchange Application is very stable and functional. It includes a Company Directory Client which lets you quickly search for your colleagues to find their email/phone information. Meeting reminders work very well - Exchange server calendar is synced to your phone and so all your meeting reminders are available right on the home screen - very convenient. It also supports regular GMail over IMAP.The real keyboard on this thin little phone is very usable - you almost want to keep typing!  I rarely mistype. There is auto completion which works OK for most part and is actually useful.Call quality is great - very rarely I had dropped calls, but they were due to \"Network Busy\" errors on AT&T;'s part and happened after  2 hours of talk - so I can't really blame the phone for it.Media - The phone continues to do great on this front. I was able to pop in my 4Gb micro SD card to make enough space for all my music and podcasts. It plays MP3s/AAC and most other routinely used formats. All of your music is available automatically for setting as ring tones or other tones (reminders/alarm etc.). It has a very functional Podcast client built-in - I was able to subscribe to all of my favorite podcasts and it automatically updated/downloaded the episodes as and when they became available.  Stereo bluetooth support is great - it allows to listen to music or podcasts while driving or while in the Gym. This was the only phone that played lots of music over bluetooth without crashing.The camera on this phone is 3.2MP and so it produces better quality pictures but I found a blue hue on the pictures initially - that was fixed with the latest software update from Nokia and now the pictures are great.Speaking of which - if you buy one, do yourself a favor and download the Nokia PC Suite Application (Windows only -works with Vista/x64) and run the phone software update before using the phone. This way you will get all the bug fixes and enhancements for the Phone without losing any data or setup.  This is one area I wish Nokia improved - the upgrade process does not automatically preserve your data/settings/applications that are on your phone (as opposed to on the MicroSD card) - it should just put your phone back where it was before the upgrade and do it all automatically.Lastly the GPS - it works well. It was able to connect to the satellites and determine my position even indoors!  Download the Google Maps application for free and you have a very usable GPS.If you are OK with having this phone locked down to AT&T; network for a 2yr contract - I have heard that AT&T; is bringing a later version of this phone for under $100 - so keep an eye.", "Date": "April 2, 2009"}, {"Title": "It is \"almost\" perfect - ahhh that camera :(", "Author": "Zafer Aktan", "ReviewID": "R2TF6JEOWN9X37", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I bought a Nokia E71 hoping to replace my SE K550i.  Main reasons for looking for a replacement was to have a Qwerty keyboard, 3G connectivity, GPS, being unlocked, Quad-phone, video conference capability, a decent set of commercial or free application availability, especially editing MS Word type documents, expansion (via memory cards) and a decent camera.I am happy with E71 - EXCEPT the camera.  When it was originally advertised, the 3.2Mp camera seemed too tempting to have and sounded as a nice upgrade from my SE K550i - Boy I was wrong :(  the 2Mp pictures my SE K550i was/is taking are much much better compared to E71. There is NO COMPARISON - it is THAT BAD.  Everybody who owns an E71 now complains on Nokia forums or similar platforms and everybody is hoping and praying for a software update with a firmware from Nokia so the problem will be fixed.  Until then, the problem (the picture quality is horrible) is there.The connectivity is very nice - you can even use E71 without a simcard for Web Surfing.  It finds the wireless connection points really fast, call quality is nice, sound is very decent, A-GPS is amazingly fast and the Nokia Maps software is very nice (though expensive for an online service in my opinion) - the Google Maps works as a champ with no turn by turn voice help (if you don't care).  Some reported that Germin XT is another option to have already downloaded maps to avoid online expense in addition to the data charges.  The default browser is very nice and fast. Opera Mini and even firefox mobile are available for E71.  The office software that comes with the phone, when updated, is capable of editing/creating MS Office 2007 compatible docs/spreadsheets and presentations.  The device has bluetooth 2 compatible and also works as a hotspot itself for other devices such as your laptop when JoikuSpot software (I am using the paid version but a free light version is available) is used.Other than the camera problem the phone is very very nice and capable.  Unless you are looking for a nice camera phone, then this is a nice smartphone - if the camera is important - then don't buy it now (nov 2008) - wait until there is any software fix that will address the issue.If camera is important then SE 850i is a nice 3G , unlocked phone option (if it was not that Qwerty keyboard I almost bought one) with a nice price tag (online) after some search.Hope this proves useful", "Date": "November 4, 2008"}, {"Title": "It's a great cell phone", "Author": "Doug in CA \"Doug in CA\"", "ReviewID": "R19OX3OR71QVCQ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "May 5, 2009 Update: I have lived with the E71 for about 3 months now. It's a good phone, but I like the iPhone better. So today I went out and bought an iPhone 3G. The graphics on the E71 just can't compare. Plus the iPhone has so many great applications that Nokia just does not have. My call quality issue arose from a problem with at&t;, that they are working on at my office. It seems better now. The 3G iPhone is quite a bit better than the 2G version I had.Original Review: I owned a 2G Iphone for about a year, and was getting frustrated by the Iphones bugginess and poor phone quality. So I decided to go phone hunting and settled on the E71. These 2 phones are very different. The Iphone has great graphics and nice applications, but is a pretty basic device. The E71 is a more powerful device, with less graphics ability, but is a better phone. And that was my primary need, #1 a good phone, and #2 a PDA. The Nokia excels at both.I like the VOIP options of the E71. The music player is good too, and can use up to an 8GB micro SD card for music storage.Setting up my Gmail and exchange server accounts was fast and easy.The E71 battery lasts at least twice as long as my 2G Iphone.The call quality is the best of any phone I have owned. I am very happy with the switch. I even switched my SIM card back to my Iphone last week to see how I felt about the Iphone. I switched back to the E71 at lunch. I missed the E71, and I don't like the touchscreen keypad of the Iphone.The E71 is not an Iphone and is not really comparable. The E71 is more like a turbocharged  Treo or Blackberry. The Iphone has better graphics, and if you need graphics, the Iphones the better choice. But the E71 is more stable and does not require rebooting, which my Iphone did.I also like the physical size and feel of the E71. It's lighter and thinner than the Iphone. It also seems very well built.The GPS works great and is a lifesaver. You can also use google maps.", "Date": "March 15, 2009"}, {"Title": "Excellent alternative to a Blackberry.

I live in the NYC area and the reception with this phone is superior.  I have had BB, Motorola, HTC(winmo), and LG phones all within the past 3 years, and believe me it makes a difference to have a Nokia.  The radios and data services speeds are unparalleled to any other 3G phone I've had.  It also works well in rural areas of NY, PA, and NJ and has become my link to the office when traveling.Outside of that, this phone does everything!  It even has barcode scanning software on it.  The default email software is poor, but Nokia mail or Seven (which is what I use now) give me faster then BB service. Contact sync with google is like having BES, and the media playback and browser are fantastic.Build quality is very high.  The phone is extremely slim and a bit heavy, but not so much where it is a bother. Battery lasts well over 2 days with normal use.  Heavy use and your going to need a spare if you don't bring a charger.  Not a big deal as you can pick up those and other accessories for cheap off ebay.Some other great features built in or via 3rd party:  Lower Monthly AT&T; Data Rates (15/mo vs 30)  Loud Ringer and Speaker Phone  Last.fm & FM radio /w RDS player  WiFi AP mode so I can connect my ipod or Notebook (joiku)  GPS Software and Mapping Quick lock through a-GPS  WiFi Connectivity  VoIP (I use this with my Co PBX)  Flash video compliant  Video Conferencing Front side camera.  Tons of 3rd party games and appsCons:Negatives are minimal and most can be overcome as well.  The OS is a bit tricky at first (I was too programed to using a BB).  Once you become familiar with it you'll like it better.  The 2.5mm headset jack is a bit of a pain and the headset that comes with the phone is awkward as one headphone wire is shorter in wire then the other. The D pad is a bit close to the quick buttons and can make it hard to navigate with gloves. The charger port is a pain.  I don't know why they didn't use the microUSB port to charge as well.

thanks nokia.  i guess i'll have to stick with my pc and my ipod.  sure they sell adapters, but they're bulky and ugly.  why nokia?  why!3. no microSD card; for the US version, there's no included card.  there's a slot, but no free card.  small problem, but still annoying.4. there either is no way or i haven't found a way to get all internet-connection-based applications to always connect over a default connection instead of asking me every single time. it's a little annoying.5. fingerprints; it's true what everyone says.  but oh well, whatever.6. Yahoo Go 3.0 runs 25%-50% slower than other apps on this phone.  the UI isn't any more graphics heavy than the other s60 apps, so i'm guessing it's making many [...] requests and they're all adding up to 4-5 seconds of load time for each page/screen.conclusion:i've forgotten about the crappy camera and moved on because i have a really good camera anyways.  you can't expect a phone camera to perform like an SLR, and thats what i use for pictures anyway.i also bought two necessary items for this phone:1. flexskin: http://www.amazon.com/Nokia-E71-FlexiSkin-Low-Profile-Black/dp/B001H3JXNE/ref=pd_bbs_sr_9?ie=UTF8&s;=apparel&qid;=1233858881&sr;=8-92. minsync car charger: http://www.amazon.com/Nokia-E71-miniSync-Charger-Bundle/dp/B001EHLSRC/ref=sr_1_3?ie=UTF8&s;=wireless&qid;=1233859147&sr;=8-3i've had this device for 5 days and it has been all joy.  everytime i pick it up, i'm happy before, during and after using it.  it's just great.buy it already, it's just N I C E!", "Date": "February 2, 2009"}, {"Title": "Best Mobile Yet", "Author": "G.

I've owned many smartphones and most recently tried an iphone. I loved the ipod features of the iphone- easy sync with itunes, big screen for videos, etc., but found it not the best for my business and communication needs. And I really never got the hang of the soft keyboard. Even after several months of use, I kept making many typing errors. The first thing that struck me about the E71 when I saw it in a store was how beautifully designed it was. However, when I found out it was a Symbian phone, I was a bit leary as my past experience with that os was not at all positive. However, after reading a few reviews I decided to give it a go and I couldn't be happier. It's a great email device. I have it set up to sync my work exchange account for email and PIM info and I'm using Nokia's free (for now anyway) push email client to get my .mac account pushed to the E71. The phone is really fast responsive and the keyboard is lovely. Unlike the iphone, I can type quickly and accurately. There are many other great features, including Nokia sync to itunes on my mac, GPS, loads of 3rd party software like audibleplayer for ebooks, 3g tethering to my laptop using the joiku hotspot software.One negative is the Wifi. Sometimes it works great, but other times it is very tempremental and just won't connect. The only other negative I can think of came from a friend who also bought an E71. He has trouble reading small type and was used to the font adjustment feature on his BB Curve. There is no way to enlarge the fonts on the E71 and they can be a bit small for some. Other than that, I would highly recommend this phone.", "Date": "September 13, 2008"}, {"Title": "Best phone I've ever owned", "Author": "Drew", "ReviewID": "R3AUT3IQZ9TUQW", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "It's sad that there isn't a phone out there today (2013) that I would rather have than my trusty old Nokia E71. I read the (abysmal) reviews of the Nokia E6 to see if Nokia could come up with something better than the E71 in the same form factor. They didn't, and it's surprising that even the E72 and E73 are not up to the quality of the E71.Running Symbian S60.v3, the OS is old, but there are many apps out there nonetheless. There's a threaded SMS client available (SMSchat for $15...well worth it because I use it EVERY DAY), the built-in email client works fine, though it doesn't support push email and you can only do automatic retrieval on two accounts, the battery (I bought it two years ago) still lasts 4-5 days between charges with regular usage, and the thing is rock-solid stable.I love the breathing light that shows that the phone is on, and flashes on receiving a text message, a new email, or a missed call. I found an app (cClock) that keeps the LCD on showing a configurable clock (can show seconds, date, day of the week, etc) and has an option to turn the backlight off, so you can still see the clock in bright light at any time. However, the battery life dropped to about two days, and the breathing light had to be turned off for it to work properly, so I disabled this program.I use Mail For Exchange to sync the built-in calendar and contact list with Google Calendar and Google Contacts. It's so nice to be able to edit entries on a PC with Google Calendar and sync it with my phone, or add an appointment or reminder with the phone and sync it the other way, back to Google Calender.Using Advanced Call Manager, custom white and black lists can be made for phone numbers, and you can change the default action for blocked callers, such as sending them directly to voicemail, giving a busy signal, silencing the ringtone, etc. There is also a scheduler to change the reject call list type and the default action of rejected calls. However, it doesn't work on SMS messages. I set the Meeting call profile in the phone to not vibrate on text messages, but to vibrate for phone calls, then the advanced call manager to reject all calls from anyone not in my contact list at night. This way, I can put the phone in Meeting mode at night, and only callers in my contact list will get through for emergencies. No one would text me in an emergency, and this way only calls from my contact list will wake me up.The built-in browser leaves a lot to be desired. I installed Opera Mobile, which is a good browser, but the processor in the phone is slow enough that when scrolling with the D-pad, if the browser hangs for a second and you happen to be pressing \"up\" or \"down,\" even if you let go, it scrolls to the very bottom or top of the webpage. Also, it's very easy to run out of memory running Opera Mobile with more than a couple of tabs open.I use this phone on T-Mobile's network, and so it does not use 3G on their data network, only 2.5G. It's fast enough for what I do. I believe that AT&T; is the only network in the U.S. that has 3G available for this phone due to the frequencies it uses.Call quality is great, and people have no trouble understanding me or me understanding them. I cannot say the same for any phone I've owned previously.The keypad is one of my favorite parts. I can text with one hand, while eating a sandwich, or while walking. There are ways to access Ctrl-C and Ctrl-V, allowing copy and paste. The two soft keys up top next to the D-pa are configurable for different functions, as well as the four keys next to the D-pad (Home, Calendar, Contacts, and Messaging keys). Until I find another phone that has the same tactile feedback and key layout of this phone, I won't be switching.Note that the Wifi on the E71 is only 802.11 b/g...no n wireless. It's the only g device that I still own, and my router is configured to n-only due to the performance hit of having a single g device connected. This isn't a big deal to me, but it's something to keep in mind.Tethering with the supplied USB cable works if I need Internet access for my laptop or tablet and am out of Wifi range, but the bluetooth tethering is a lot handier. At 2.5g, it's certainly not fast, but it's much better than nothing.I've used speakerphone a few times, and it works better than expected. The caller is usually really clear, and sometimes they can't tell that I have them on speakerphone.There is a factory screen protector, but it eventually will get scraped up. I've stocked up on cheap aftermarket ones, and they aren't as hard as the factory one, but at $.60 apiece, I can't complain.There are some stability problems, but very few and far between. Sometimes the phone won't receive text messages until I reboot it. I'm not sure why, but this happened just today (has happened maybe twice before in two years). Also, it's called someone without me knowing it. The person at the other end answered the phone, and could hear me in the background (the phone was in my pocket, the keypad and screen locked). He called back, and my phone answered it automatically and he could still hear me. I never heard it ring. He called my wife and told me, and I looked at the phone...no evidence of a dailed call in the call log, no evidence of a received call, no missed call, nothing. I think I may have unplugged or plugged in the power cable while it was booting, but I've never had this happen before or after this one instance.The camera isn't great, but for a phone from 2008, it's not bad at all. You have to pretty 'T' to focus it...I've read other reviews where reviewers complained about blurry pictures, and it's possible they didn't know that you have to press T to focus. I use it all the time for photos because I always have it with me. With a 32GB MicroSD card, I never run out of room.The video resolution is very poor, something like 320x240, so I almost never take video with it.I love the size...not too thick, not too thin. It slips into my front pants pocket, and that's where it spends most of its time.This is easily the most reliable, most pleasant phone I've ever had the use of, and even if the design is 5 years old and it's running an unsupported OS, I've yet to find a phone that I would rather carry with me.", "Date": "April 5, 2013"}, {"Title": "The good, the bad and the ugly.", "Author": "Expat Kiwi \"Mike\"", "ReviewID": "R11BE7VRCL1JPA", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "In summary the Nokia E71 is a high end voice/video/messaging communication device it is not to be confused with a web viewing or gaming device.For some odd reason Nokia phones have never been that popular in the USA in comparison to Europe and Australasia. This model the E71-2 is made in Finland and is the unlocked (non carrier specific) US model version and has GSM/EGSM (GRPS EDGE) quad band 850/900/1800/1900 MHz and uses 850/1900 MHz for UTMS/WCDMA (high speed data packet access HSDPA aka 3G)[...]. So what you ask? Basically, with the US model if you travel overseas don't expect to receive UMTS (3G) service.The Nokia E71 is best called a high end business smartphone....kind of like those high-end German cars it has more bells and whistles than any other smartphone on the market and just like those high-end German cars (designed by engineers for engineers!) you will need to read the manual and play around with all of the buttons to work out all the features it has to offer. The Nokia uses the Symbian (competitor to Android and iPhone) operating system and has a relatively large number of applications that will run on the phone. All of the currently popular applications are available for the phone Skype, Facebook, Youtube etc. Many of the apps can be directly downloaded from Nokia's \"Ovi Store\" using the app directly from the phone.The phone has a built in FM radio that works great, but you will need the headset to be plugged in (it acts as the antenna), but once plugged in you can use the loudspeaker. The audio is very good and plenty loud when using it with all the audio applications. The phone has a built in GPS receiver and now has free Ovi maps (global set...you will need a large memory card if try and download them all) available from Nokai for download. The GPS works great and has a large voice set available also, my daughter loves the English Surfer Dude speaker. Phone has infrared, bluetooth and wifi connectivity built in.The wifi works well and is a great feature at home or on the road. I can web surf and download podcasts (it has a podcast subscription app). The phone has an internet radio application  that is also a great feature...you can listen to many US and intentional based internet radio stations like the BBC for free.I personally prefer to have a keyboard with my phones rather than a touch screen and like the Nokia for this reason, it is odd that I find it easier to type with the E71 keyboard than my work issued BlackBerry. The screen is about the same size as the BlackBerry screen, but Nokia have (in my opinion) could have worked better on using the real estate and particularly with the font and icon size on the home page. If you have bad eyesight you may find the E71 very hard to use without a magnifying glass.The good:1: High end unlocked smartphone for less that $230!!!! (not locked to a carrier or plan)2: Unlocked phone has many phone carrier defeating applications. VOIP/SIP and wifi3: Phone supports cell/phone calls, video camera calls (has both forward facing and rear facing camera), internet (VOIP/SIP) calls in native application, Skype, Fring calls...4: Applications galore included.5: Ovi store applications and GPS maps for free.6: Phone is lightweight.7: Battery life is great and is user replaceable.8: Phone will multi-task without any issues, listen to the radio, web surf and download all at the same time.The bad:1: Phone almost requires a degree to operate.2: Too many menu options and levels to achieve tasks.The ugly:1: Text size and phone icons (3g, signal/battery bars) are miniscle.2: Phone requires a PhD to totally master.3: PC based Ovi/PC suite sync application is slooooooooooooooooow.I'm using the phone with a $6.99 for 90 days T-Mobile prepaid SIM card and have setup a VOIP/SIP account along with Google Voice for voice mail and free wifi internet calling. Life is good. Very odd but my teenage daughter would rather have my E71 than an iPhone.Overall the E71 is a great communication device with many great features included for the price. If you are looking for a cheaper phone then have a look at the Nokia E63 as an option, it does not have a GPS receiver, forward video camera or external volume controls. But is a tougher phone with all the other attributes of the E71 above.

The OS does take some getting used to and does not look as pretty as competing ones.  However, it offers tons of customization that iPhone owners can only dream of.I wanted to keep this phone, but chose to return it because of email integration.  For POP email, it either checks email automatically  and downloads the message or it checks it, downloads the header and informs you that you have a new message.  This was a deal breaker for me.  What's the point of downloading the message if it doesn't alert the user that there are new messages?  Going the other route (by downloading headers only) would be ok, if it didn't take ages to manually download messages.  Also, hotmail and yahoo mail required special apps to download, which did not automatically check for new messages.  The final email related frustration is that by default, it does not download html messages.  You can click the attachment and it brings up the message in the browser, but it's an extra step.One final distraction was the phone's constant alerts asking if it was ok to connect to the network and asking which one to connect to.

It is easy to use, quick, it can edit office docs (even 2007/2010), read pdfs, email, wifi...everything the mobile professional needs.Did I mention that the battery literally lasts forever? The batter is unbelievable, lasts at least two full business days (calling with bluetooth, syncing to desktop with bluetooth, surfing web, youtube, emailing, sms-ing etc) and it still has battery to spare! I really can't believe it. It even recharges the entire battery from 1 bar to full in less than an hour! Ridiculous.The build quality of the phone is as amazing as everyone has said. It feels solid in the hand, yet is much lighter and a bit smaller than I expected. Very *sleek* very chic, stainless steel...the phone is sexy. Really. Just based on looks alone I would by the phone again. They don't make phones like this any more. Period. This is the best constructed mobile. Period.However, it is not a 5-star because of some glaring inefficiencies in the OS and UI. While it is intuitive and easy to use, it certainly feels dated. Sometimes even too dated, though never outdated. I would keep this phone to my grave if it had as sleek an OS as its outside case design. THAT SAID, that's me comparing it to an iPhone or Android phone. Compared to pre-2010 Blackberry OS, Palm, or (shudders) Windows Mobile (6 and below), this OS is certainly tops. So, I really can't be too harsh. This is a business phone after all, and compared to other business phones, it is 5 star. But because of so many Andriods out there, you can't help but rate it lower, that is reality.I guess to summarize: if you need a phone that can do internet, tether internet to your laptop natively (that app is built-in), wifi, lasts more than 2 all days with Bluetooth and work, syncs with Outlook and/or Google, does business while looking ridiculously sexy, and can do some fun stuff on the side, and you don't mind a UI that reminds of you the mid 2000s, then this is the number one phone of all time.

I'm also on the AT&T; network due to traveling abroad to other countries. Let me start off by stating I have owned many smart phones- Blackberry, Iphone, HTC Tytan II, etc. For the last two years I have had a love hate relationship with Windows mobile professional 6.1 operating system on my last smart phone. Does everything you'd want a phone to do- but snail paced slow-- very poorly at best. So my review will reflect comparisons between the two phones.Opening the box I found all items intact and packaged well. My first impression after looking at the phone was \" wow, incredible build quality\"- fit, finish and design were stellar. Blackberry could learn something from the folks at Nokia. Setting up the phone involved removing my 3g sim card and installing it in the E71 followed by installing the battery and cover. Now to charging. The charger design is nice but I have reservations on the charger cord. The cord is thin and only time will tell on the durability. Also in box was a corded headset (cheap at best), an extremely short computer interface to phone cable( with some kind of proprietary usb connector on the phone end), nice leather slip case, software cd, quick starter flyer,instruction booklet- A real printed user guide.Waiting for the phone to charge, I broke out the manual- great! Another operating system to learn- Symbian version 60 ?. Done skimming the manual and now booting up the phone. What? No waiting 3 to 5 mins for phone to boot up? I'm liking this operating system already. The E71 snaps to the home screen quickly. I find the screen very intuitive and very easy to see. First impression of the qwerty keyboard is buttons are awfully close together for my big mitts. But after a few days I've found the domed keys to be of no issue for me while typing one handed. Phone is very responsive to inputs and no lag in operating system. Now milling around thru the software and settings. I find the phone settings and software usable but some learning curve involved coming from a windows mobile phone. Definitely not worth fretting about- zipping through the menus in no time. Being unlocked, I have no carrier useless bloatware and phone works great on the AT&T; 3G and edge network.Back to using this as a phone- after all that is why if bought it in the first place. I wanted great call quality-not good or mediocre . And I found it with this phone- transmit and receive quality are again stellar with strong, consistent signal strength . You will NOT get that with an Iphone- period.Lots of free shareware for this operating system and have found Symbian operating system very stable. I had to reset my Windows mobilea least once a day sometimes more. This has been running a week without a hitch and I can get about 3 to 4 days of use before charging.Using Bluetooth,GPS and maps,Wifi, and Ird transfer to be just as easy and work as flawlessly as the rest of the features- including the provided software suite used to interface your computer info to your phone.In summary, the reviews here on Amazon on the E71 and the huge price drop compelled me to try this phone. I think I just might purchase another one. I'm that impressed- what a nice breath of cell phone/smartphone nirvana.One lacking feature I've found is low internal storage capacity. Highly recommend purchasing a 4 or 8 gig Micro SD card. Thats about it.", "Date": "April 11, 2010"}, {"Title": "E71 - A year later", "Author": "Scott A.

The E71 has amazing battery life, my biggest complaint about the iphone.  The sound quality and reception are better on the E71.  The screen is bigger with higher resolution and it's easier to web browse on the iphone.The E71 wifi is more senstive than the iphone.  I can see and log in to weak hot spots that the iphone can't see. The Nokia Messaging provides html email but the email client is not as good as the iphone.  The iphone does load web pages faster, even on wifi.I've got apps on my E71 that you can't get on the iphone.  I've got a call recorder and blacklist, which I really like. Also, I've got Jokuspot which turns my E71 into a wifi hotspot.  This app is incredible!The iphone has threaded messages where the E71 does not.  It's nice to have, but not a big deal to me.As far as the cameras go, the iphone has a better camera, but lacks a flash.  The E71 flash is the best I've seen on any cell phone I've owned.  It's an auto flash that actually works!  It will adjust the brightness of the flash as needed.  I can take pictures in a dark room and it easily provides enought light to get a good image 10 to 15 feet away.  The E71 camera does cast a purple tint on pictures in low light situations, the main downside of it's camera.People complain about the small E71 screen, but it goes with the size of the phone.  One thing I really like about the E71 is it's small size.  It's about half the size of a Blackberry Bold.The E71 is made in Finland, and as others have said, is very well made.

Other criteria included quad-band GSM and Wi-Fi.  The e71 fills the bill admirably.Using the AT&T; network I'm able to connect in places I could not connect before and the voice quality is superior to my wife's Blackberry. In two months I remember only one dropped call and that occurred as the signal was passed from one tower to another (in a weak signal area).  The keyboard is very funcitional even for my male hands and short fingernails.The screen is smallish but that comes with selecting a smaller, pocketable phone.  The build quality is outstanding and in my opinion it is (still) the best looking phone on the market.  Despite the small dimensions and thin profile, it feels substantial in the hand but rides comfortably in my pocket. (I tried a couple different style belt holders but found it challenging to get the smooth surfaced phone out of the pouch quickly so  I reverted to using the Nokia supplied pouch and keep it in my pocket).The Symbian OS is very functional and the e71 arrives loaded with most everything you need to get started.  There are more programs on the Nokia web site and there are lots of other sites that specialize in Symbian programs.  If you want to change the Nokia theme or need additional software there is plenty available both for free and for purchase.  I am still looking for an acceptable Symbian tweaked web browser but otherwise I've found everthing else I need.A high pixel count camera on a cell phone is not an important feature for me.  I find the 3.2 megapixel camera on the e-71 more than adequate for casual use and easy to use.  Included camera software is a plus.One my favorite features of the e71 Symbian OS is the ability to segregate my business and personal life with different home pages and themes.Wi-Fi is a definite asset.  It is great having the option of using the AT&T; network or Wi-Fi.If your smartphone criteria is similar to mine you will find the e71 a real winner.", "Date": "April 2, 2009"}, {"Title": "Great phone", "Author": "Amazon Customer \"gadgetfreak\"", "ReviewID": "RJW5ONJOLYCWL", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Alright, I finally bought one a month ago based on the reviews here. This is my first smart phone. I considered iPhone and N96 before finally settling for E71. Here is why: I realized that what I really wanted was connectivity on the run (or walk ;)) - not necessarily watching movies or doing demos to others on what my phone can do. I wanted a phone that can do many things pretty well, and not just some things absolutely the best. I also wanted a phone that lets me add applications that I (as opposed to AT&T; and Apple) want/allow. And I didnt want to go bankrupt buying/using that phone.  E71 satisfies all (well, except the demo part: I ended up demoing it a few times ;)).Coming to the phone itself - it has an unvelievable set of features - * Connectivity options - You name it, it has it(Bluetooth - including stereo headset support infrared, Wifi, 3G, Edge). You can connect to Wifi networks that requires encryption (I configured WEP) or browser-based authentication. * A GPS with A-GPS support - meaning fast GPS lock. Not sure if you need(I have) data plan to use it. You can disable it, though, and use just the plain GPS. * Decent email client (setting up gmail took all of 1 minute - just enter your user name and passwd). But you should try Nokia's new push email service (free for now - not sure how long), it is much better. Emails show up on your phone even before Gmail web ui shows it (same case with built-in email client as well). Both has no html support (yet). * It can sync up with outlook on your windows PC using Nokia Suite, and it can connect to Exchange using active sync (though I havent checked this myself - my employer doesnt allow me to). * It plays all kinds of media files (audio is decent, and the speaker loud enough) and youtube. * It has a very good browser with flash support (and you can watch You Tube videos) * it has internet telephony support(meaning you dont need any additional software if you have SIP account with any provider) * it has tonnes of other applications (free and paid) that you can download from Nokia's own or various Symbian S60 websites. Fring (chat/voip client for google talk, skype, etc), Google Maps (with street view), Yahoo Go, etc are some must-have applications available free. Ability to be on Skype all-day (of course, if you have data plan) can save you a lot of money, if you make/receive international calls (you can make skype-skype free or skype-phone for lower rates without using your minutes) * You can add more memory using micro SDHC card and applications can be installed on phone memory or card * Good battery life (at least to my expectations) - with wifi and 3G turned on, push-email set to immediate notification, Fring running always and lots of browsing, I get through 2 days. With 3G turned off (using edge), push-email at immediate notification and moderate browsing, I have now gone 3 days and battery has 40% charge left. * Looks - One of the best looking (still feature-rich) phones (much better than N95, but nowhere near an iPhone) out there. It is very thin, and is probably smaller than iPhone. * Finally, it has a full qwerty keyboard which is very very very usable - never thought I could do that on a phone.For the negative side, I must say that the Wifi reach is not as good as my laptop (meaning, I can get fairly good signal on laptop, but E71 wont get any) - but then you cant really compare the high-power laptop to a low-power cellphone. Also the phone has a 2.5mm audio jack (not 3.5mm, as your regular headsets would use) - you will have to get a 2.5mm to 3.5mm adapter if you are particular about that favorite headset of yours.Overall, I recommend the phone.

Nokia's \"Mail for Exchange\" works well if crudely.  But want Gmail, Yahoo, or any other web-based or IMAP/POP mail to show up on the Nokia as it arrives? No can do.

After using Nokia phones for years (121, 8260, 3590, 3100) Istopped finding their phones appealing and switched to other brands.The E71 replaced a Palm Centro, my first smartphone. Wanting 3G, Wifi,GPS and a better overall platform with full keyboard in a bar format,I spent months researching phones and it came down to the E71, PalmTreo Pro or Blackberry Bold.Pros1. The is a very versatile phone. There aren't many features missing thataren't on other phones of similar design. The biggest missing function isa touchscreen, but the directional pad is excellent so it more than makesup for the lack of touchscreen.2. The build quality is great, very solid, no creaks, no worries about case breakage, or durability.3. Battery life is excellent. I can easily go 2, or sometimes 3 days between charges with a reasonable level of voice and data activity.4. Network speeds, including WiFi are very good, but my only comparison is to the Centro that had Edge only and no WiFi. Browser performance is great, pages load very quickly (I'm on AT&T;).5. The browser is no Safari (iPhone) but it's still excellent. Better than my wife's Blackberry browser. It's missing Java applet and flash support for playing website videos (except youtube) but no native mobile browser that I know of does either. Skyfire will give you that flash support using a server based rendering engine and its performance on the E71 is pretty good considering what you're getting. This should be one of your first downloaded apps.6. I've had less than a half dozen resets in a month which was far less than my Centro and what I consider acceptable considering what is packed into this phone. The multitasking support is excellent, 1-button task switching. Symbian is a great software platform, rich in applications, very mature, stable, very large user community.7. It's an excellent phone, great reception in weak signal areas, greataudio quality, everything you can expect from a Nokia device.8. The size is optimal for a bar type phone. It's comfortable in thepocket. The tradeoff is a smaller keyboard and screen than the BB Bold,(but a better keyboard than the Treo Pro) but if size is a concern,the E71 is a winner among bar phones with full keyboards. And it'ssuper thin!Cons1. The music player is weak. I have an 8 GB Sandisk MicroSDHC card and have had to format it at least once and reload all my music because the player had trouble detecting new files after around 900 were downloaded. Since formatting I haven't seen the problem again and I'm over 1030 files, so it could be related to my not formatting the memory card after initially inserting. Could also have been corruption during file transfer.2. No touchscreen but the D-pad makes up for it.3. Camera is so-so. Don't buy this if a camera is important to you. Forquick snapshots it's adequate.4. No native threaded SMS application. However this can be overcome by downloading Conversations for free from Nokia labs. Doesn't match Palm's threaded client, but it's ok and you get used to it.If you're looking for a feature-rich, well-built, stable, no-lag, pocketable phone that's also very good at making phone calls, this is your phone.", "Date": "June 13, 2009"}, {"Title": "After a year of hard use, still the best bang for your buck!", "Author": "MP", "ReviewID": "R9Y8TKCEX4OR", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Update; December 2009:  It has been almost a year of using the Nokia E-71 not only for calls but also for Internet browsing, reading and replying to e-mails, text messages and using it as a video and music player.  The more time I spent with the phone, the more features I discovered.  Because it has been protected by a full cover leather case, has survived many accidents including being lost overnight in the snow.Attached to my belt, has been with me for probably 16 hours per day while at work and during leisure activities.  Has been in the ON Mode 24/7 because it is used as my alarm clock and the 3-G always active receiving e-mails anytime, faster than the server that sends these to my computer.  Average battery life is typically of Nokia and needs recharging every third day with regular use.Using an 8GB Micro SD card, many applications have been installed plus 50 MP-3 albums, podcasts, like 20 video clips, several long MS-Word documents, PP Presentations, Excel charts and even PDFs plus ten full movies compressed to 300 MB each under AVI format.  The reception with ATT's 3-G has always been great; no complains.Two weeks ago after falling from my belt, the phone developed the well documented \"Turn Off Syndrome\" when any key was pressed.  Checked the Nokia Website and seems that has become a fairly common issue for many users.  Tried all the solutions posted but none of them worked, so I ordered another unlocked phone, the Nokia 5800.  This new phone is a great device (will review it soon; still testing battery life), but since it was not a replacement for the E-71 and not finding other phones I would consider as true replacements, did erased \"everything\" on the device and installed the new firmware (300.XXX.XX) the original version was 100.XXX.XX.  Also, installed the new software (for the S 60 OS) from Nokia's site.To my surprise, the problem was solved and it's great that Nokia's upgraded firmware has some new features including a much faster Internet browser and four new wallpapers that make easy reading the relatively small fonts and make the Icons more noticeable.  Two of these wallpaper screens are red and the other two in black shades; very nice!  The only think I am noticing is that battery recharging time has decreased from three to two days.  But that is still a considerable time compared with the berries collection, the I-Phone and the many other new phones that run Windows Mobile.Thus, it has been a year of satisfaction with this attractive device and have no major complains.  Even though I have tried most of the other keyboarded phones including the berries the palms and the Samsung's Blackjack & Jack, none has the conveniences of the E-71 as for fast and accurate messaging.  The wired mic & phones are history and the device is paired to three others, two Plantronics headphones and the Garmin GPS.  In conclusion, the more time I spend with the phone, the more I like it and the harder it has been to find a proper replacement for it.  Thus, I have planned to keep it as my business phone for at least 2010 but getting a new battery.  Pictures of the phone have been included.Initial Review; January 2009:  After reading several reviews, I ordered a Nokia E-71 Unlocked US Version from Amazon. This is the first Unlocked Phone I get and will comment on \"unlocked devices\" at the end. I selected a Nokia E-71 after having tried several phones which included the LG Incite, RIM's Storm, Samsung's Omnia and the Blackberry Bold. Why did I not stay with any of these phones? Basically because of very few and subtle advantages found on the Finnish product wanting a phone of proper size capable of my e-mail, multimedia and web searching needs.With the E-71 Nokia's has been able to offer consumers a beautiful stainless steel device full of features that most users will probably never even know that they have on their hands. From an Infrared Transmitter, to literally reading your messages so you actually listen to e-mails instead of having to read small fonts on the screen to voice dialing, an integrated GPS and a full multimedia system that allows you to see videos, podcasts and listen to your favorite music. Not to mention good quality of reception, sound, a great Symbian OS, up to ten e-mails and all powered by the well known long lasting Nokia battery.The shortcomings are only few in my opinion. The first one is the micro jack for the headphones and microphone. The second one is the micro USB port for connection with the computer. Nokia should have used the standard ones like other companies have been doing. The third shortcoming is the small screen fonts (even on the large setting) that make difficult reading some e-mails and MM messages. Besides these three, I consider that all the plusses make these limitations not significant.Unlike most American products, Nokia uses a port for charging the phone separate than the one used for connecting the phone to the computer. This has pros and cons but for me is better leaving the phone charging wherever I want instead of needing to leave it next to the computer in another area of the house. As well, if you are away from home and do not have a computer, the charger will do it by itself.The E-71 has a full Qwerty keyboard and this is what probably makes this phone the best choice for persons that need or like to type considerably. What makes the keyboard unique is its design. First, the keys with numbers have been located in the center. Those of us who have used the Bold and other RIM products have struggled when trying to type the numbers 4 and 7 in a sentence because they are immediate next to the only ALT key of the RIM keyboards. You will not have this problem with the E-71.Nokia has wisely assigned lowercase keys to two of the most important characters when surfing the web or composing e-mails. These are the @ and the period ( . ). On other devices such as the RIM ones, these have to be activated trough ALT plus the corresponding key. On the Nokia keyboard the @ is immediately left of the space bar and the period is slightly up and to the right. These become very convenient when typing.This keyboard has a very attractive charcoal colored (almost black) on the grey version. In order to differentiate the keys with numbers, the upper half of these have a lighter color. Thus, if you turn the phone slightly downwards, 12 keys in the center show up in grey color. These have the numbers 0 to 9 and the # and * keys often used when accessing message centers and companies. In order to have all these in just three rows of keys, Nokia has placed the zero to the right of the number 9. Not what we are used to but quite clever.Compared with the Bold the keys are somewhat smaller and no space between them. But, their convex shape makes typing relatively easy even for persons with big thumbs. One thing that works for me is having the phone flat on a surface and type with the index fingers.On the upper part of the keyboard, ten keys have been arranged in a not so usual way which includes the square that substitutes the \"rolling ball mouse\". At first was sort of difficult to use it but when you web browse, the logic behind becomes evident.This is one of the few phones that come with a leather strap which attaches on the lower left corner of the device. This is extremely convenient when you receive a call and need to rapidly take out the phone from a pant pocket or if it's being carried inside your jacket or coat.The installed software has many features which are found only in more expensive devices. Their Office Suite has even the Acrobat reader and Word and Excel documents can be edited. Not so with PowerPoint, Access and Publisher but that' Ok since the screen on cell phones is relatively small. I guess that the IR Transmitter will be useful sending a document to a printer so you'll be able to see/read it in full size.Thus, the E-71 is a product with multiple capabilities that can be used as a phone, a micro computer, a messaging system and even as a substitute of your Personal Video Player to watch your favorite videos while commuting or flying. Even though it was intended for companies (that's why the E; for Enterprises) the device can easily make its way into the average consumer. Needless to say, I consider this Nokia the best bang for your buck in the current world of smart phones. I have had mine for four weeks and plan on keeping it.Currently there are two versions of the phone being sold \"unlocked\"; the US version and the European version. At the time I wrote this (01/09) those that plan to use the ATT network needed to get the US version. In contrast, T-Mobile users need to get the European version. This is because of the different operating frequencies of the carriers.Why should someone get an Unlocked Phone instead of buying one with a plan? Well, it's what you will end up playing with the plan for the next two years. Carriers actually make more money out of the contract (at least $2,500) than of the alleged discounted price of the phone ($250).I have been a customer of Cingular/ATT since the first cell phones came out in the nineties and do not complain of their reception in general. As well have had Sprint and Verizon but only because of reception problems with ATT in specific geographical areas I've lived.But, this time I bought an \"unlocked\" phone because I did not want to be \"locked\" with a two year contract with any company. That way, when advances in technology present us with a better product, I'll be able to get it immediately.", "Date": "January 21, 2009"}, {"Title": "My first unlocked phone", "Author": "KenHan", "ReviewID": "R30DCM7H89Z8TP", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I should start by saying I have used a Blackberry for quite some time, most recently a Pearl...and I liked it.  When it came time to get a new phone, subsidized phones were not an option for me, and the Nokia E71 became the frontrunner based on my criteria.This is certainly not a full review, but a few highlights and lowlights based on my initial experience.First, the highlights:* The build quality is impeccable.  It's a beautiful device, and it comes in a hair smaller than the iPhone.* Call quality is great, bluetooth pairing is flawless, and tethering (via USB or bluetooth) works fine with AT&T; 3G and 3.5G.* Syncing with Outlook 2007 works fine overall, although every once in a while a calendar item seems to show up in the wrong place.* Google Maps works great with the GPS.* Impressive battery life.* There's a whole 3rd party ecosystem for Symbian; I haven't even scratched the surface.Now the lowlights (you'll see my Blackberry heritage here):* Haven't found a great solution for push email for Hotmail and Gmail. Windows Live and the Gmail client don't seem to be designed to automatically grab my email and notify me the way Blackberry did.* Still getting used to the keyboard.  I was less error-prone with the Blackberry (both their full keyboard and the Pearl's suretype).* No ability to set different ring/vibrate behaviors for holstered vs not.* Less control over notifications.  For example, meeting reminders vibrate and flash way longer than I need them to.The lack of the kind of push email I expected is a bit of a bummer, but overall I'm still very happy with this phone.

It's beautiful.I'm not a technophile, so my review won't be as indepth as some. So I'll keep it simple.If you've owned any Nokia phones before then it will take you only one day to learn to use this phone. It has lots of menus and it's very easy to navigate between them. It operates on 3G and it's better by leaps and bounds over EDGE. All I did was get the phone, put my ten year old sim card in it and I was making calls. Seriously, it was that easy. I bought an 8G micro sd card and I'm taking pics too. Some have said that the camera is not world class but it works just fine for what it is- a camera phone.The screen is not as big as the new touchscreen phones but it is very large and shows very high quality pictures and video. The speaker is loud and clear, but on speakerphone, the louder the volume, the more the distortion.The phone is stunningly beautiful as well. It is very thin, yet sturdy. It has a heavy feel, and quality build. I recommend the gray for men though. I own both the white and gray and they are both fantastic. Prepare to get compliments- ALL THE TIME! Ladies love it, men love it, and my kids all want one now.Lets get to the pluses. 1: Sturdy build and estectically beautiful. 2: Many menus that are very easy to understand and navigate between. 3: Accessories included. Very handsome carrying case, headset, usb cable, and ac charger, and cd rom with drivers all come with the phone. 4: 3G interner with wi-fi. Fast internet at that. 5: Unexpected little things like the notification light that alerts you when you have a missed call, text message, email, etc. Ane the beautiful clock with date stamp and icons; it only comes on when you turn off the annoying breathing light. but when you push the navigation button, the digital clock is very big and bright. Very nice touch. 6: Very long battery life. On both of my phones I'm getting between 4 and 5 days between charges. Maybe I just got lucky. There are many more pluses, but those that I listed are my favorites.Now the minuses. 1: The phone gets really warm if you're on it for more than 15 minutes. This is terribly annoying. 2: The stupid breathing light that I see no need for at all. It just blinks and drives you crazy. I checked and most other users of this phone found this to be annoying as well- so I'm not alone in that department. Nokia emailed me and showed me how to turn it off and it worked. I'll instruct on that later in this review. 3: The qwerty keyboard is fantastic and has great feel to it so one doesn't have to push the buttons hard at all. The problem is that the keys are super tiny and take a little  getting used to. 4: Finally a very minor minus; no smileys. There are no emoticons to insert into texts like on older less expensive phones.Overall verdict is BUY. I researched phones for 8 months, and this one in particular for at least two. I read the reviews and decided that this one was perfect. After two weeks with the white phone and another two weeks with the gray one, I am perfectly satisfied with this phone. You won't believe how beautiful it is.How to get rid of the \"Breathing Light\" when you get the phone.Step 1. Push the \"Menu\" button.Step 2. Go to the \"Tools\" menu, and select it.Step 3. Go to the \"Profiles\" menu, and select it.Step 4. Go to your prefered setting (normal, silent, meeting, etc.), but DO NOT select it.Step 5. Push the \"Options\" button, and scroll to \"Customize\"Step 6. Scroll down to \"Breathing Light\" and push the \"Options\" button. Scroll to \"Change\", and select \"Off\". Select \"Ok\".Now the light is off and the screensaver clock is activated. I hope this review helps someone.Update: 04/05/2009. I love this phone. I backed up my files to my computer. And its a good thing I did. I did the recommended firmware update and low and behold it updated the phone but wiped out all of my settings and all of my contacts!!! I reinstalled my stuff from the pc and all is well, plus a few extras that was in the update. I will be backing up my phone weekly now.One new glitch though. After I updated the phone, the clock that acts as a screensaver does not advance. It stays at the same time until you push the navigation button. When the lighted clock shows, it shows the correct time, but the screensaver does not. Very minor problem, just wonder why a good thing goes bad after an \"UPDATE\"?Still the best phone I've owned, and I still say purchase.", "Date": "March 27, 2009"}, {"Title": "Simply Incredible.", "Author": "R.

Eventually I got tired of waiting because I found something better...the Nokia E71.My first impression is wow, if you could only see this beauty in person. It is a masterpiece. With its titanium encasing, I have no idea how I could break this product.The next thing you notice is its size. From being around Blackberry's and Iphones this thing looks small and compact. For me this is an advantage, but for those with bigger hands you may be disappointed....but unlikely.So far the best thing about this phone is it's software. This is simply  because it is incredibly easy to use and set up. I typed my gmail account and bam! I was all set with push email.The phone is set up so you can switch modes, which is great. You can go from your regular calender, browser, email, and messaging to more of your media device. It sort of is like work and play for me.The camera isn't the greatest for some. I feel that it is good to have but not a necessity so it's quality doesn't bother me.Overall, I am extremely happy with this product....the negative reviews are honestly ridiculous when you add up all the positives of this device.

Peterson \"JP\"", "ReviewID": "R3BQE6A5FF5G2", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Have had the E71 for about a week and so far I love the phone.  I really did my research on smartphones before I made the decision to go with the E71.Things I love about the phone:-Operating system is very easy to use and the phone is very fast.-Love the web browser, pages load quickly and clearly with vibrant color on both wifi and through ATT service-Love the voice activated features on the phone which I am still learning about.  I really like how the phone can read your text messages to you and how the phone will say the name of the person calling so if I am driving and it's somebody I don't want or need to talk to I don't even have to pick up my phone.-The size of this phone is amazing with all of the features on this phone like the full QWERTY keyboard and large screen that it is so small.  My company uses Blackberrys or Motorola and in comparing the build quality, size, and features they don't really come close to the E71.  The Blackberry phones are bulky and have a very unimpressive, cheap plastic build.  With the slim dimensions of the E71 this phone fits in my pocket easier and more comfortably than my old Motorola C139.-Above all the call quality on the E71 is the best I have ever had in a cell phone and the sound quality is amazingly clear and reception is always good.  I paired up my E71 with a Nokia bluetooth headset and even on Bluetooth and on the freeway people have commented that I don't even sounds like I am in a car with almost no background noise.I researched just about all smartphone brands for about 2 months before purchasing the E71 so I want to also give my opinions on some of the common \"dislikes\" or \"cons\" about this phone from the reviews I have read or seen and provide my opinions:- The phone is completely customizable which according to some reviews is good and bad.  Bad if you are someone who isn't very \"tech savvy\" and good if you just want something like the IPHONE that is completely setup for you when you buy it.  MY OPINION: I am not the most tech savvy person and with this being my first smartphone and scrolling through the different menus and setup screens I found the phone was very easy to setup the first day I got it.  I like for example how there are multiple profiles you can setup for the E71 which include setups for ringtone, text tone, email tones, et cetera that you can program into a specific profile so if you are in a meeting and you need to silence your phone you can just switch to the \"meeting\" profile.  With there being about 7 or 8 profiles you can setup, you can setup your phone to have a multitude of profiles depending on your setting.  If you can't find an application or screen there is a handy help menu and you just simply type in what you are looking for and you get detailed instructions for either finding the application or setting it up.  If you want to get back to the home screen, there is a home key that you click to get back to the home screen along with other handy keys next to the scroll key to get to commony used screens quickly.  Conclusion: The phone is very easy to navigate and setup.Non-standard 2.5mm headphone jack: This seems like more a minor annoyance than anything.  I have had the phone about a week and used everything on it from calling, calendar, and MP3 player and I have not had any problems with this not having a standard 3.5mm jack.  I don't see any problems here.Camera: The camera takes slightly above average photos in outdoor/sunlight but below average indoors with the flash with the 3.2MP camera.  Bottom line, if you want camera quality on a cell phone comparable to your DSLR or point and shoot digital camera than you're going to spend a lot more $$ and have a phone much bulkier and thicker than the very compact E71.  So in the end there is a tradeoff.  If you want to also use a cell phone to take family pictures and other important events than you'd probably want to go with the Nokia N95 but again the N95 costs at least $100 more and 0.8\" thick (double the E71) so it costs more and isn't exactly pocketable like the E71.Fingerprints: The fingerprints show up on the back panel pretty easily and I consider this a minor annoyance.  Nokia would have done better to make the entire backside of the phone the dark gray color as opposed to making the removable plate a chromed titanium.Summary: For the price and comparing this phone to other phones like the IPHONE and Blackberry Bold, the E71 doesn't have a couple of things the IPHONE does and EVERYTHING the Blackberry has for much cheaper than both.  The E71 doesn't have the large touchscreen of the IPHONE but the IPHONE also doesn't have video recording like the E71.  Considering the IPHONES and Blackberry Bold new are still $500+ and I was able to get the E71 for about $330, the E71 provides a much greater value.", "Date": "March 11, 2009"}, {"Title": "Very very good phone.", "Author": "Amazon Customer \"R Bajwala\"", "ReviewID": "R1DJ6TXZ5XASNR", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I've had this product for slightly over 2 weeks. Note that I said product and not phone. The first phone that I received worked fine for about 10 days. Then it suddenly went blank and no amount of cajoling could get it to work again. I called Nokia to see what they could do. But they told me that since the phone was brought from Amazon it wasnt covered under the Nokia warranty (since Amazon is not one of their authorized sellers - whatever !!). So I called up Amazon and they assured me that someone from the Cell phone support team would get back to me within 2 business days. I wasnt sure what to expect next.I casually happened to check my account on Amazon the following day and noticed that Amazon had already shipped the replacement. I received the new phone within 48 hours of encountering the problem. This is where the fantastic Amazon service saved the day for me.

Whiteside", "ReviewID": "R2PVO9XSZ6V4YW", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Okay...so I live in Japan and up until recently I had an iPod touch and an NTT DoCoMo handset.  I was using the iPod as my organizer and the handset was just a phone.  I am military and decided that a world phone would be a good idea for me and my research brought me to the E71.  After reading the feature list I was immediately sold and I ordered one.  What I was not aware of though was the differences between 3G frequencies and how it would affect my purchase in the long run.Japan uses 3G 2100 Mhz (NTT DoCoMo)...so that is strike 1 for this version of the E71.  Be aware that there are 3 versions of the E71 available.  The US version will NOT WORK IN ASIA because many places in asia do not use GSM but WCDMA or 3G for the most part.  The US version does not have the bandwidth required to operate here.  Additionally, Japan in particular uses the 3G network for both data AND voice comms.  There IS NO GSM in Japan...they simply don't use it.  Anyway...now that I have cleared that up... I bought a second E71, the international version, and I use it here and it works marvelously!!  I LOVE this phone.  The 3 variants of this phone are the E71-1 (US), E71-2 (Australia/Asia), and E71-3 (Eur/Asia).  I have a -1 and a -3 and am currently using the -3 here in Japan.  To further explain the networks here...there are other service providers that offer 3g as well, but they are in the 1700Mhz range while others still use an older 2g system known as phs that is also not compatible with this phone.Now...if you've read the other reviews about this phone, you already know that it's great.  I'm not going to bore you by repeating their statements, just know that this phone is definitely worth the money you will shell out for it but be aware that dependent upon where you are going to travel if that be the case, you will need to purchase the applicable version for the region you will be in.  If you're traveling to Europe it will only be a factor for you when trying to access data services via 3G...voice comms will be unaffected since it's a quad band phone and nearly all of Europe uses GSM.  I have heard that EDGE/GPRS capabilities may circumvent this but I can't speak to that effect due to lack of experience/knowledge.Japan and Korea though in particular will require that you have the -2 or -3 version or you will be left with a glorified MP3 player/PDA with a QWERTY keyboard.Additionally, if you will be in Japan long term, the only way you will be able to use this phone here is to contract with Softbank or DoCoMo and buy one of their entry level cheap handsets and pop the sim card out of it and put it into the E71.  There is a catch though...you'll have to purchase the data package known as \"pake hodai double\" in order to not get raped on your monthly bill when it comes to your data rates.  Since you are not using a DoCoMo handset the cap on your data bill will be about 60 bucks higher than if you use your DoCoMo phone.  I guess they can recognize that it's not a \"company\" handset probably as a result of the IMEI number on the phone that I assume is somehow detectable by the local network.  You will also lose the ability to use a docomo web mail address but all you have to do is open an Ovi account at Nokia's website and then install Emoze on your phone.  Once you marry the ovi mail account and Emoze you have webmail on your phone again.  You'll also need to get Mopera from docomo for your data services...and no, they won't tell you the settings to input...you'll have to muddle through it yourself.Sorry so lengthy, but I hope that helped someone to buy the \"right\" version of this phone.", "Date": "August 29, 2010"}, {"Title": "Nokia E71 Unlocked Phone", "Author": "Ish Singh", "ReviewID": "R1RM0PXIXJUZYT", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This phone met my expectations on all levels being sleek and stylish and enhanced communication features which catered for mostly the corporate users rather than the blackberry crazed txtin zombies.

I own this gem for more than 3 years and still work flawlessly. Recently I got a Nokia N9, but this is still my primary phone.- If you never used Symbian, it will seem awkward at the beginning, but it's easy and very customizable when you master it. You can setup 2 different profiles, called modes, each with a different homescreen and 6 apps shortcuts for easy access. I've named one \"Personal\" where I've Opera, Music Player, Sport Tracker (a must if you a runner), SMS, Facebook & Switch mode (for switching on the fly). On the other one, \"Work\", I've put Email, Quickoffice (great word processor), Notes, Adobe, Podcast, Switch mode. On the homescreen can enable Email & Calendar notification, WLan & phone manager. The left and right top buttons for menu & camera. The home button work as a task manager if you press it for 2-3s. The keyboard is easy and fast to use as the buttons are slightly raised. Someone complained about unlocking, I don't get why, it's so easy & fast: Top left button + Bottom left. That's it, 2s.- SMS, missed calls & voicemail notifications will appear at the bottom of your screen for you to click and access them. Easy.- You can delete all your SMS in inbox by going to settings - mark/unmark - mark all - delete. Or select as much as you want.- WLan works flawlessly & easy to setup. It will connect with only a click and open the browser automatically. Bluetooth worked out of box and easily sync with my PC, laptop and N9. I transfered all contacts and documents to N9 using it.- Voice calls are clear & camera, after last update, is great. Even the included headphones work great for music & calls.- Apps. Everyone complaining the Symbian or any other Nokia phone have a poor apps selection. Really? There are thousands there, even N9 has at least 3000. Have any Android or Iphone fan used all those half million apps? The most used ones are available. Facebook, Twitter, Opera, Skype, Whatsapp, Sports tracker, and so on.- Ovi maps. Great free voice navigation for life in any language. Do I've to say more?- 8 gb micro sd is great and more than needed, and raises the value of the phone.- And last the battery. The greatest battery ever. Even better than my new N9, though not as better as it was 3 years ago. I still can manage 24 hrs with one charge. Not bad for a 2008 phone.It's still a great smartphone, even after 4 years can stand in par with most new full keyboard ones. Don't compare it with touchscreen phones, they are a completely different category. And it's beautiful, shiny metal all around, not cheap plastic.Lastly, I think it's a bit pricier, but if you find it around or under $200 grab it.Just my two cents.", "Date": "March 25, 2012"}, {"Title": "Best phone I've ever had", "Author": "J.

I had been wanting this phone for quite a while because of its businesslike appearance and features, and to replace my old and somewhat lacking LG KP500 Cookie.Here are the main pros and cons of this phone.PROS:-Amazing Quality and Form: The phone is wrapped in a chrome metallic surface and just screams quality. Just to hold the phone is a treat. All the buttons are where you expect them to be (and all feel well made), and little touches like a gripped backing add a feeling of extra stability to the phone. Compared to the somewhat plasticy Blackberry, this feels way better.-User Interface: The somewhat complicated (see Cons) Symbian UI is excellent for both the businessman and the personal user. It provides extended customization and easy access to Email and all of your apps right from the home screen. Notifications also pop up on the home screen, and a notification light blinks. You can also switch between two Home screens, a business one and a personal one.-3G and Wi-Fi connectivity: My current plan is T-Mobile's Pay-As-You-Go plan, which only runs on basic GPRS technology, so I can't actually comment on the 3G connectivity. The Wi-Fi functions work incredibly fast, with no issues connecting. Setting up Wi-Fi is a breeze, and it remembers saved networks.-Camera and Video: The 3MP camera is pretty good. It works well in both low light and sunlight, and offers autofocus, flash, and many different color overlays. Video has good quality as well. There is also a front-facing camera, but I haven't gotten around to using it yet.-Apps and Ovi App Store: Tons of Apps can be downloaded to this Phone. Facebook, Myspace, Youtube, QuickOffice, a Mail Client, and IM all come preloaded. Not much to say here, everything works as it should. Note: Skype and Opera Mobile are also available for download and they both work incredibly well on this phone.-E-Mail Client: Amazing, Robust Client... Much better than Blackberry or iOS's included clients. Allows for autosync and multiple addresses, with tons of customization options.CON:-UI COULD be hard to use for some, mainly because of the somewhat disorganized folders.-Ovi Store sometimes freezes up on me and I have to force exit the app.-Ovi PC software is a bit buggy.OTHER:-Battery Life: Not really a con, not really a pro; 2 days with heavy use. With minimal use, it lasts up to four days.Overall, I would easily recommend this phone to any \"heavy\" cell phone user, especially at the somewhat low price tag.", "Date": "December 29, 2010"}, {"Title": "Excellent Phone for Everyone", "Author": "Venkat", "ReviewID": "R2Z70DIDSUKABF", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "it has all the features blackberry's and the iphone 3g have. however, the e71 is much smaller than both (just put the e71 side to side with the blackberry curve and the iphone and they both look like monsters compared to the e71).- very fast 3G capability- excellent size, feel, and look,- speedy processor with no lag in navigation- improved OS and great computer connection software (nokia pc suite)- long battery life- 3MP camera with flash- comes with carrying case, carrying strap, stereo earphones, and data cable", "Date": "October 4, 2010"}, {"Title": "The Best Phone I ever had!!!!", "Author": "Francisco Jose Ayala \"fr23\"", "ReviewID": "R36PX3IM4XBC3Y", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This is a really great phone.

From reading various reviews the E72 offered a much faster processor but the E71 was almost $100 cheaper and the reviews were very good. So I decided to buy the E71 over the E72 and save some money.So far, I am very happy with the E71.  The interface is very user friendly and most of the features are easily usable.  I like the feature where you calendar entries for the day and reminders/memos etc are displayed on the main screen so you kind of see them every time you look at the phone serving as a reminder of things to get done for the day.I had a lot of issues initially with the GPS navigation but after doing some research online I figured it out.  Basically, I have not signed up for the data plan since I used a pre-paid T-mobile sim card in this phone. Initially it used to take ages (30 minutes plus) to get a satellite signal. Then I went through various settings and disabled the positioning based on AGPS (which requires a data plan) and Blue Tooth leaving only the GPS and Network items checked. Now the phone picks up GPS signals in a few mins. I guess since I had the AGPS checked of, it was trying to position itself by connecting to the GPRS network of T-mobile. The software needs to be made smarter to give up after trying a couple of times and use just the internal GPS receiver for tracking the position.  Now that I have only GPS and Network based positioning enabled, it is working just fine. I have compared the directions given by Nokia OVI maps with the built-in GPS in my Honda Pilot and a Garmin unit and the directions are generally the same in all units. I have been using the GPS feature in this phone to navigate around New Jersey and it works fine. The other beauty of this navigation is that maps are free so if you plan to take a weekend trip to France, you can just download the maps for France and delete them after your trip. You need to install the Nokia OVI suite to download the maps. And when you are installing the maps to your phone better to connect with the USB cable than through blue tooth as it will take much longer to transfer map files through blue tooth connection.The calendar/reminder/memo feature is very easy to use. The thing that I noticed though was Nokia OVI suite doesn't have a build in calendar like the Nokia PC suite, I have in my older laptop. Hence you cannot view your calendar on your PC unless you have Microsoft Outlook installed.Overall, I am very happy with the phone. The Otter Box sleve that I ordered with the phone fits perfectly as well. I would definitely recommend this phone to anyone who wants a smart phone.", "Date": "June 11, 2010"}, {"Title": "Great Multitasking Phone", "Author": "Gary", "ReviewID": "R255SMMXKHRZA3", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Phone:Has great call quality, but needs a good signal. Used this with Tmobile first and was disappointed since the signal strength in my area was very low. Then switched to AT&T; and am amazed what this phone is capable of. Loudspeaker is good, although has to be cranked up all the way high. Had a Nokia N73 earlier which is by far the best phone in terms of voice clarity and loudness.Build Quality:Build quality is exceptional. Phone feels solid and keypad is a pleasure to type with. After using it for about a month with only a screen protector, I see no scratches on the metal back or anywhere on the phone (touch wood!)Messaging:This is a great phone for messaging. The physical keyboard makes typing a lot easier. Nokia email is installed automatically if you try to add gmail, hotmail or yahoo accounts. It provides true push email. However, software is still a little buggy. Also has support for Microsoft Exchange, although there is no HTML support. This phone can also read out your Text messages.GPS:Used with the A-GPS, this phone gets a fix even indoors. Outside the fix is within seconds. Phone comes with Maps 2.0, but can be upgraded to Maps 3.0. Nokia's navigation is excellent, but unfortunately is not free. The entire U.S. map can be stored on the SD card and is only about 1.2 GB. Google maps work very well with AT&T; 3G, but was not able to update maps quickly enough on TMobile's Edge (while driving at 65mph).Built in apps:There are some very good, but lesser known, built in apps on this phone. The podcasting app lets you view audio and video podcasts for free. The dictionary app is excellent for quick lookups as well as translating the word to other languages. Language packs can be downloaded from the nokia website. The internet radio app has quite a few stations to choose from and works very well even on 3G.VOIP:This phone does VOIP quite well. It can be paired with Gizmo. If you have a Google number and set to forward your calls to Gizmo, you can actually take your call on this phone and not spend any cell phone minutes.Battery:Battery life seems to be great in standby mode. I went through almost a day with Nokia Email in push mode without loosing even a single bar on the battery indicator.Other apps:Sports Tracker is a great app if you like to keep track of your exercise activity like walking, running, cycling. This app plots your route on a map and keeps track of your pace (and even what music you are listening to at that moment!). It works with only the internal GPS and doesn't need additional sensors. This app alone makes the GPS worth having in this phone. Workouts can be uploaded to the nokia sports tracker website [...].Fring works well for instant messaging as well google voice chat. I tried nimbuzz too. Although nimbuzz had a smaller memory footprint, I was not able to get google voice chat to work with it. Fring also has built in support for automatically switching from wifi to 3g and vice versa. e.g if you are on 3G, and get within range of a known wifi access point, Fring will within 5-10 mins automatically change over to wifi. Similarly if you walk out of your wifi range, it will fall back to 3G.Google Mobile supports voice search that actually works! It is another must have app for the e71.Multi-Tasking:By far the best feature of this phone is its multi-tasking capability. All symbian phones support multi-tasking in theory, however, due to memory (RAM) constraints, most phones are not able to run more than 1 or 2 apps simultaneously. This phone has a total RAM of 110MB and after startup has a whooping 62MB free. I have been able to run Microsoft exchange, Nokia email, Fring, SportsTracker and the music player all simultaneously and still have about 40mb free.Web Browsing:The built in web browser works well for mobile websites, but is not able to handle larger web pages so well. Wlan speeds are slow. I am not able to get anything more than 1.5mbps using speed tests, even though my internet connection is about 9mbps. This phone supports HSDPA (3.5G) and works well with AT&T;'s data network. Opera mini is able to handle full blown web pages and makes the web browsing experience just about acceptable.Update:Unfortunately the phone does get really hot after being on 3G for a few mins or on a call for 15-20 mins.

The keyboard is excellent and probably the best keyboard you can make for a phone this small.There are some negatives, too: the phone software is aging and not the most intuitive, the built-in VoIP app doesn't quite work, and there are not that many useful third party applications out there.  The 2.5mm headphone jack is a nuisance, as is the fact that you can't charge it through USB (but you can get a USB-to-phone charge cable).The phone is smaller and (I think) nicer than a Blackberry.

Touchscreen phones are too delicate for my job (construction engineer) and I type much faster using a standard keypad anyway.

My friend bought an e71 and I borrowed it for a few minutes to make a call. I was so impressed by the slim sleek design that I purchased one the following day! I can find no fault with this phone! At first I thought the keypad was too small to type (being a fairly large guy 5' 8\") but let me tell you that Nokia designed the keypad flawlessly! Within a few minutes I was happily texting away at blazing speed! It also comes unlocked so I can use it with my both carier SIM cards without any problems.I own several handheld gps units (Garmin etrex and Lowrance iFinder) and these cannot get a fix indoors. Within a few mins my e71 got a fix from an impressive 5 satellites. The screen resolution is amazing (tv quality). The entire phone is well built, sturdy and strong. Just looking at the back cover you can see that this phone is built to last. It has all the usual \"requirements\" for a smart phone: symbian os, email, web, camera, video, realplayer, mp3 player, quickoffice, etc. etc. Even though the camera is 3MP this is sufficient in my opinion.I am still discovering new features for example the e71 has text to voice capability - the phone can read out aloud text messages (very convenient when driving)!

I needed a QWERTY phone and I think this one is a good compromise between Cupertino and Ontario, good in many but still short of some.Map app is better than Blackberry. Directions are turn-by-turn in 3D or 2D, and other modes with voice guidance (7 days only). Absence of US POIs. You can't even search \"Universal Studios Hollywood\".  You can search a POI in Google Maps and enter address in Nokia Maps to get a 3D turn-by-turn direction.Nokia (Ovi) app store will launch soon. You currently can access free apps, themes, ringtones, wallpapers, etc on Nokia Beta Labs, S60.com, Nokia Mosh, and many forums and blogs.Great metal design, feels like a fine piece of gadget, which it is indeed. Small enough to really look like a phone, thin but substantial in the hands, and formal yet sleek look. QWERTY pad is responsive, very good sized one and very fun to use (trust me, it is way better than my ex BB Curve 8330's QWERTY pad which I always seemed to use my nails on that one instead of fingers).Good native internet browser.  Even better than BB Storm's.  Another browser, the Skyfire works great on the Nokia E71 (Skyfire runs only on Symbian and WM).  It is way better than Opera Mini (on BlackBerry).  Flash player and flash content works great.  With Skyfire, you can display desktop version of websites, unlike Opera Mini on BlackBerry which will always display mobile content.The email functionality is poorly designed, in my opinion (the BlackBerry is still the king).  You can have push email through Nokia Messaging Service (IMAP only, I can't figure out how to use POP3).  Native email client will only \"push/auto-notify\" you of new email(s), but will not download the email itself, instead it will download an email only when you select or decide to download it.  One by one in fact.  Both clients are not capable of displaying HTML content within the email's body.  Will have to download the attachment or link and displayed in a browser.  The entire email functionality needs some time to be appreciated.  In fact, because of some email functionality issues, its release on AT&T; has been rumored in blogs and forum to have been pushed back towards end of May 09.  Newer BlackBerries, Palm Pre, and iPhone 3.0 will likely take the stage by that time.Email filters are non existent especially if you use Mail for Exchange.  You can't block internal office spam, ERP/server-generated responses, and annoying co-workers.  Neither the native email client nor the Nokia Messaging client provide filtering for MS Exchange emails.Multi-tasking is great on this phone. I can listen to internet radio, browse the web for a restaurant, search in Google Maps, type direction in Nokia Maps, open a PDF file to read something, and switch back to internet radio to change station and do all these without exiting an app, and the radio is still playing.Internet radio is a good substitute for lack of Pandora or Slacker app.  However, the phone jack is not standard. You can't plug it into your car's mp3 jack like you normally do on your ipod, iphone and blackberry. You won't find any third-party adapter either. You are stuck with cheap ear piece which you can't replace with a premium one either.  Weird.You can sync your Google Contacts.Limited support (stingy software updates) from Nokia for US version.  Either they think their phone is superior or they are not listening to customer feedbacks.Fast 3G/3.5G (depending on your location though) but will work only on AT&T.;  It will work with T-Mobile on voice but not sure on the data side as T-Mo operates on 1700 whereas this phone operates on AT&T; 3G's 1900 spectrum.Has Wi-fi and GPS.  I'm not sure if you can tether and how you're going to billed for that.  I've heard from several people able to do this but have not tried it.Cheaper plan than iPhone and Blackberry.  My plan is $30 unlimited data and unlimited messaging.  I used to pay extra for the messaging/SMS on the iPhone and BlackBerry, but messaging is bundled to this specific phone's data plan and unlimited :).", "Date": "March 26, 2009"}, {"Title": "Nokia E71 - Best Business phone", "Author": "A.

(well, its so low is nonexistent) and i didnt really like the design. i dont see how i am supposed to walk with it on the road when on cord for the right ear is so long... its annoying to have it dangling plus it gets caught in stuff and tugs and one day, if you're not careful, it will burst.2.5mm headphone jack.disappointing to me. i wont deny it. 3.5mm is greatly preferred, however. contrary to what many think... with the right headphones, this phone is an excellent mp3 player. so, dont despair. jus get a nokia headset that is designed for music and you are good to go.overall, i gave this 5 stars because... the camera doesnt bother me. hardly use it, and when i do its to take pics of people to add to my address book. those are great.when i walk with this phone, its a pleasure to take it out and watch people bending over backwards to see it. :) nokia is the best there is even if they refuse to max out their phones in top class features.", "Date": "March 11, 2009"}, {"Title": "Great phone with a few things to be desired", "Author": "YCYC", "ReviewID": "R2EE3J1MH5IQG4", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I bought this phone for my husband in January and another one for myself in March.  That shows how much I like this phone.  Beyond everyone's ravings, here are some points from my personal experience with the phone:1. battery life is not as long as claimed in the product info.  My husband's phone lasts about 2.5 to 3 days with one full charge.  He uses it for  voice calls only with about 30 minutes daily talk time.  I typically get more functions of my phone with usually 10-20 short phone calls, a dozen text messages, 10-30 minutes podcast and checking emails with wifi 3 to 5 times a day.  My phone's battery indicator gets down to the last 2 bars by the end of day.  So I have been charging it daily.2. Good language support but less ideal than iPhone.  I bought the North American version so the phone comes with English, French and Spanish.  I was able to install Asian fonts on both my phones without much hassle.  My iPhone came with the option to change languages out of box.Notwithstanding the above, I truly appreciate the beauty and functionality of the phone - otherwise I wouldn't have bought two!Update 6/13/09: we have been living in China and Europe for the past several months and use the E71s with local service providers (the beauty of an unlocked phone!).  The phone performance seems to deteriorate:  the phone would turn off by itself - sometimes in the middle of a call about at least once a week.  Occasionally, I can hear the other side fine but the other side can't hear me.  Not sure whether this is a network compatibility issue.

Though, i still was looking for a device that can also act as a phone and has wifi(i am 99% time within a wifi network, so 3g/edge is not a factor).I debated between E71, N95 and many other phones. So what sealed the deal? E71 is way smaller than any other device (iphone included) (and that too with a very easy keyboard), perfect seamless pairing with my bluetooth headphone(motorola HT820) and easy OS. I never used a symbian phone before and without much effort(no RTFM) was able to learn all functions. Though there are times when there are just too many options and i do click the wrong button.People might complain about the no-touch small screen, but to tell the truth it serves the user adequately: compared to the N800, i find, i prefer the keyboard on the E71 better than the onscreen keyboard of the N800. It serves best as the enterprise device for which it was intended for so the camera is just ok (too much purplelish), screen is small for video but the processor/OS is snappy to handle it. Though the media player is awesome, pair up with a stereo headset and voila (it also supports album art, and easy way to create playlists )! There are many good and free Symbian apps from Yahoo, Google for mail, news, maps and work good with E71. Also, the battery is huge and can last more than a day with heavy net usage. Oh and the charger is the half the size of a fat thumb!Accompanying Software is pretty good and connects seamless through via IR, bluetooth or USB. for Mp3 files there is a convertor to convert to a smaller AAC format and load to the device (one can load as MP3 too btw). I use a Sandisk 4GB microsd to store media files as the inbuilt phone memory is just about 120MB. It has a one stop app solution to handle almost all phone functions like transferring files, to reading SMS's, backing up, etc.Symbian is pretty snappy as OS and i have yet to have a 2 sec+ lag moment (which sometimes happen when switching between wifi access points). GPS is Ok and takes sometime to get a lock, but with a real nice app from Nokia called Sport tracker to track walking distance etc etc and also works with google maps.Pros: Snappy OS, excellent bluetooth capability, very good apps, on the first look i wondered 'how did they cram so much stuff in such a small package and that too with a massive 1500mah battery!'.No Cons, except perhaps the red on/off switch on the top of the phone (see it's so hard to find a fault with e71)So overall its a dream phone for me and worth much more than the going price of 350$.", "Date": "November 16, 2008"}, {"Title": "Nokia E71 \"smart\" phone", "Author": "Mark Antonio \"Tony\"", "ReviewID": "R1X5R1QQYU0760", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This phone is fantastic.

Some of the things I really appreciate, other than all the special features are: 1) adjustable ring volume that is loud enough for some of us older folks and 2) a really good speaker with a phone that will stand without having to lean on something. Additionally, the bluetooth connection to my navigation system was very easy to set up, and the bluetooth connection to my Nokia 6682 allowed me to transfer data with a minimum of effort. I am still learning things about this phone and probably will have it all figured out in a year or so. All things considered, this phone has exceeded my expectations. I wavered a bit and was considering 2 other Nokia phones with 5 megapixel cameras, but I'm satisfied I made the right choice. 3.2 megapixels is plenty unless you are trying to do really big pictures, and those are best done with stand-alone cameras.  I really recommend this phone highly. I guess I should add that I'm a Nokia fan. I just think they make the best product.", "Date": "September 23, 2008"}, {"Title": "This was the perfect device for me!", "Author": "Keith T.", "ReviewID": "R3HEGBIR6QEHVK", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This is my 4th attempt...I can't seem to keep it short!  Anyway, right off the bat, I LOVE this phone.  I looked for over a month, reading reviews, trying to find the perfect phone since my contract was ending (I had a Motorola V3xx). I wanted a smartphone, and thought the iPhone was the way to go...then I found out it had no stereo Bluetooth (unacceptable to me for my next phone), the forced data plan was kinda pricey to be locked into, I didn't like the plastic of the new 3G version, and I heard the battery life wasn't very good.  I also read the same about Windows Mobile phones.  Then I got to the E71.  I'd have to sacrifice the flashy big touch-screen...and I'm so glad I did.  To have a phone with a full QWERTY keyboard on a device this thin (instead of a big-brick slider phone), a beautiful steel frame and battery cover, great tactile feedback and domed keys making up for lack of space between them (even with my big thumbs)...it was so worth it.Received it in 2 days, popped in my old SIM card, called up and got an inexpensive unlimited data plan (active as soon as I hung up the phone, turned it off and back on), and was off and running!  Web browsing is a blast, e-mailing is great (probably my only complaint with the phone is that I can't SAVE e-mails on it..check for new ones, the old ones disappear..still haven't found a work-around for that yet), there's a ton of freeware out there for the operating system (for AIM/IM programs, even a free voice-guided GPS program I found!), camera is better than the RAZR's (though most do say it's terrible compared to other phones), I've got over 500 songs (any of which can be the ring tone!) on an 8GB card, 4 e-books, and lots of room left...I could go on, but just read other reviews!If you have the opportunity, hold one...that alone may sell you on the thing!

It was great I had internet via Wifi calendar, email via Google, oh and a bunch of useless apps.  It was very expensive to buy without a plan, but I liked the openness of it, no contract, any sim card from any country, etc... Then it broke!  I couldn't see making another $500+ investment for another phone if it was only going to last me MAYBE 2 years tops.  So I did some searching and I had looked at the E71 even before I bought the Nexus One and this time it seemed to meet all my requirements.  Read the reviews found it could import my gmail and google calendar and that was all I really needed over and above the phone functionality.  Which I quickly discovered using the Nexus One.  So I ordered the E71 from Amazon Used->Like New.  When it arrived it was a brand new phone!  I put my card in and got going adding the googasync app to get my calendar and setup my gmail account and even imported all my google contacts via google.  In no time I started to realize this phone was intuitively way more powerful and organized than my Android device!  It had a nice list of my next calendar appointments right on the home screen, would show a list of 5 newest emails when hovering over the gmail item, all my music files on my SD card were found by the music player, it could multitask, on and on.  This was all icing on the cake, cause when I start receiving calls I realized the call logs and \"ignore call\" options were just awesome!  I couldn't believe it when I ignored a call and was immediately prompted a template text message that I could send to the caller with one button saying basically Can't answer right now, will call back.  I mean what control I felt, with such a simple process, I felt I finally was the master of my powerful smart phone and not the other way around!  Recommend reading the manual to learn the shortcut keys, they can make the phone fly through any process.  Also, keyboard feels great typing out anything.

There are so many things I love about it.  First of all, the hardware is just about the best you will fine.  So many phones these days are, for all of their slickness, cheap plastic crap.  Not this phone!  I have actually dropped this phone a couple of times (Yes, I can be clumsy).  One time I was sure I had damaged it.  Nope, not a scratch or blemish.  The keyboard is awesome.  I wasn't sure I would like it because I have big fingers, but the buttons are raised and its easy to get the hang of it.  And Nokia has put little touches on it that I think are useful and endearing.  For instance, the side of the phone has a dedicated voice dial button that makes it extremely easy to voice dial.  The GPS is good... and free!  The phone is very fast for a 3G phone.  I don't get much lag at all; I think it has freezed up once.  And the screen will surprise you.  I have enjoyed watching youtube videos on it just as clear as a pc. It has bluetooth.  You can sync it with your pc or mac. What's especially good about the phone?  Straight Talk offers this phone with an Unlimited Everything plan for only $45.  That is reason alone to get this!  Any negatives?  May be some minor ones.  The back is stainless steel, and although it is impressive when it is brand new it is prone to smudges.  You can simply put a gel skin or otterbox on it, or clean the back periodically.  Nokia's ovi store isn't as large or impressive as Apple or Android, but there is still plenty there that is useful.  You can also put java apps on it which leaves room for more possibilities as well.  Lastly, the speaker phone could be louder.  I am not sure if it is just mine or all the E71s, but the speakerphone mode isn't loud enough.  I sometimes have to hold it close to my head to hear it which defeats the purpose.  But the pluses far outweigh the minuses.  It may not be the latest technology but this phone does all the things smartphones are supposed to do.

Awesome build quality, no moving parts, no squeaky sound, top quality materials2. Probably the best form factor smart phone in the world. Not too narrow so it will slip from hand, not too wide to bulge out from pockets, easily fits regular sized palm. Easy to type messages, emails with one hand3. If there was a fashion show for smart phones, E71 would win it hands down. I got steel and gray and it looks serious business and smart stylist at the same time.4. Battery, battery, battery. It lasts me 3 days on one charge with good about of browsing, phone calls, skype and push email (sync-ed hourly)5. Call quality is top notch, as expected from a high end Nokia product, with excellent clarity.6. Very good speaker, for use as Speakerphone or playing music or read messages automatically.7. Beautiful, crisp screen. I miss the big screen on my earlier E62 and I think it was the best small screen ever for watching movies, videos etc. E71 has the same screen quality but only slightly smaller due to phone size8. Processor and Symbian S60 3rd Edition work great together and menu navigation, apps run fast on E719. Nokia calendar and Message notification on home screen keeps my life totally in control. After I got this phone, my laptop sits closed for weeks. This phone will let you \"work from phone\"10. Documents processing - I edit Word and Excel docs on this phone, also read documents in pdf. No problem whatsoever.11. Add on apps for Symbian enables me to be constantly be in touch with family, friends and the world. I installed France24 for live news, Google Mobile for searching, maps. I installed Fring to use Skype, Google talk Twitter all on one interface. I use MobiReader for reading ebooks12. Nokia's free email (Nokia Messaging) client has a crisp, beautiful interface. I like it even better than Gmail for mobile. Sync is customizable (frequency, how much email etc)13. FM radio is excellent, although not many probably use it. I catch my channels when workload is light.What I don't like:1. E71 comes with basic cheap earphones, you might need to upgrade to something better, preferably with Bluetooth wireless2. Camera is not great, but I don't use it much3. Nokia's Ovi store does not have much content. There are not many professional looking themes. But you could downloaded nice themes from S60 app sitesOverall, I don't think there are many smart phones (or even phones) out there that stack up to E71. Go and get it.

It replaces a Motorola Razor V3 and my Palm T3. This phone is beautiful and metal! The screen is very easy to read even out in daylight ( I always had trouble with my Motorola in the sun). There are a few functions I have not yet been able to get working yet (primarily Internet phone) but everything is easy to set up. I found an app from StyleTap that allows me to use most of the apps I had on my Palm T3. This alllows me to use many of those apps on my phone, especially the data bases I have set up, and many neat games. Of course I can't use a stylus, but that has not been too much of a problem. My T3 needs mechanical repair and won't let me make stylus input anyway. One thing I really like about the Nokia is the ability to multitask, something the iPhone can't do. The phone works perfectly. Calls are clear and I have no contract remaining with AT&T; so I was able to modify my current plan to include unlimited calls, messages, media messages and data for just $30 a month a $15 increase from the plan I was using for the Razor which allowed limited calling and data. If I had bought an iPhone under AT&T; plan, I would have paid about the same for a locked iPhone, but a data only plan of $30 is required by AT&T; for that phone. I get perfect 3G connections and I am also able to connect to my home network and other WiFi networks with a few clicks of the keypad. The keypad is small, but full QUERTY. I hated texting on the Razor but really like it on the Nokia. I have figured out how to get my big hands to work the tiny keys. The camera is easy to use and takes better pictures than my Razor did. This phone even has an FM radio!

Sports Tracker lets you go out for a run and track time, speed, altitude, route, etc.For texting of course, this is a great device. I rarely miss type something.The only reason I'm giving this phone 4/5 stars is because its vibration is not that strong. You can barely tell it's vibrating. If you depend on vibration only (no sound) then this may not be the phone for you. The ringtone volume may be set to ascending as a workaround, which I like actually.Yes, it works as phone too.

I get 8 days on a charge, even when using 3G, Wifi, texting and calling regularly.  I don't use Bluetooth or the GPS too much, so those might affect your battery life.  Still, the battery on this thing is really impressive.- Keyboard.  I have large hands, and my first day with this phone, I definitely had my share of typos.  That ended pretty quickly though and now I'm a typing machine.- Screen.  It took me weeks to realize that I hadn't removed the little plastic film on the screen as I'd been using the phone the whole time.  It even looked great through that plastic, and now it looks even nicer without it.- microSDHC support.  I put an 8 GB card in there I picked up for another $20 or so and I can't imagine lacking for storage now.Despite my 5 star rating (because for me it's a 5 star device), it does have a shortcoming or two.  They don't detract from my enjoyment of the device, but I think the more information you have, the better informed a purchase you can make:- The camera is just not good.  I have yet to take a good looking picture with it.  The colors always seem off to me and there are noticeable artifacts.- Software selection.  I'm in the US, but I think the S60 operating system is much more popular in Europe, and it shows in the software catalog available for this phone online.  Many of the apps you'll find are Euro-centric (for example, soccer score tracking or European news sites).  I found a variety of apps that provide all I need from the device, but if you're the kind that likes having lots of choice, you may be let down.  That said, this phone does run J2ME applications and it also includes the Nokia web runtime that lets you run web widgets (Google for Nokia WRT to find out what that's all about).All in all, I think people looking for a powerful phone with a full QWERTY keyboard would get a lot of use out of the E71.", "Date": "March 31, 2009"}, {"Title": "GREAT PHONE, NOT SO GREAT RECEPTION", "Author": "Jean R. Dickerson", "ReviewID": "R3ADIM05VRX9UD", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "First off, I must admit I actually made arrangements to return this phone after exactly one week. The rumors of reception problems are quite true, but once you understand the nature of the problem it is tolerable. The problem lies with the location of the antenna. If you hold the phone in a normal position and you are in a location that has a weaker signal ( 3 or less bars ), then your hand blocks the signal and reception is horrible. However, if you carefully hold the phone by avoiding the top and bottom of the phone, reception is not affected. This is annoying since my house is located in a rural location where the signal is not strong. Now while at home I simply put the phone down and only use a bluetooth headset thereby avoid touching the phone during a conversation. If you are in a strong signal area, there are absolutely no problems with reception no matter what you do or how you hold it. Just something you should be aware of. I decided to not return the phone because I love it in every other way and other smart phones have similar problems with reception. Perhaps they are emphasizing the \"smart\"  too much and not enough of the \"phone\" technology. The camera does indeed add a purplish tint, but the images are very sharp. The gps is wonderful. Battery life is EXCELLENT. Love all the features- far superior to many of the other phones available.

I found the phone extremely easy to connect to WAP (no 3G in Costa Rica...yet.) and any wifi access point.  I have it connecting to our Exchange server, which was easy to do works flawlessly. Bottom line: connectivity is excellent.Call quality has been outstanding and reception is as strong if not stronger than on my A1200.It does everything that I want it to do.  For instance, the other night we were out looking at the stars and we wondering what some of the different stars are.  In five minutes I found Sideralis, downloaded and installed it and was looking up star/constellation information.  However, the coolest application that I have found so far is Fring, which allows you to make Skype/Skypeout and SIP calls.  Configuring Fring was dead easy and immediately I was able to access the phone system at work and make a call.There are three aspects that have given me slightly less than total joy:  first is the GPS and that's only because it takes a long time to determine my location (Costa Rica and 5 satellites).  Second is the camera, as everyone has been saying its less than ideal (but comparable to my A1200).  Third is that the keyboard is slightly small.  I have a lot of misspellings if I try to type too fast, but my accuracy is improving.The phone itself is a beautiful device and has an extremely solid feel to it.

The last few being, the iPhone (stolen whilst I slept on the subway!!), 8525 (or the slide) and a blackberry.  Although, I have to say I did like the touch screen of the iPhone, I found I am not missing it as much as I thought.  The iPhone didn't have copy, cut and paste, which although the E71 does, it's not as flexible as Blackberry.I am a business user, so I have connected my E71 to my companies GoodLinks account, which provides me with instant access to my works outlook email, along with customizable RSS feeds, notebook, contacts etc.For the gadget lover, there is a barcode scanner program built in, although I have played around testing it out, I haven't had it match anything yet.  From what I know, you can scan items and then see other places where you can get it cheaper etc.  There is a feature that will have your E71 read out you emails and texts to you with a choice of male or female voices, could be a nice feature if you multi task, but for me, it hasn't really been needed (except to show my friends with iPhones, that my phone is better...lol) It also has MP3 player and Video to name a few.Connection is fast, it has 3.5G I am with At&t; and although, they are OK, they are not normally the best for coverage here in NY, but this phone holds the signal well.The camera is a little disappointing.  It has a reddish tint to it.  I am unsure if it is just my phone, and I don't know anyone with an E71 to compare.  There are plenty of features for the camera, color mix (yes, I tried to adjust, so as to compensate), flash, B&W;/Sepia etc If anyone has a way to correct this, contact me at ttStone.com/contact/I found the GPS to be fairly accurate, although I remember the iPhone being near perfect.  The volume and sound quality on this phone is the best I have heard.  I can play some MP3's and my colleagues can hear clearly the music that is being played 40 feet away (it's not a busy office, but hey, that was way better than my previous phones)The construction is awesome, real metal back (looked like carbon effect in pics, but this isn't so) looks great though.  The protective screen finally came off 2 weeks ago, I didn't replace, but not a single scratch from being in my pocket.To put it simply, this is not an iPhone, it is a business phone.  It has items that would get any iPhone child going nuts for, but Nokia chose not to highlight them, which is wise, as this really is for the more sophisticated business user or the person that needs quality and effectiveness, rather than balloons and whistles.O yeah, I installed Skype on there (and it works!

The Windows platform is certainly \"rich\" in functionality - if you *really* wish to use all the bells and whistles which I, having used PDAs/phones for 15 years, found beyond my demanding professional needs. WM6.1 based PocketPC productivity software such as the very popular Pocket Informant 8 (my preferred Contact manager) offers wonderful features but is needlessly complicated and cross linked to other suites, and importantly is less than intuitive (compared to Nokia). This is not a complaint on PI - their support was great! full marks! - but symptomatic of many other WM6.1 software I use. As a result, the mighty TyTN II is too slow for simple things like quick access to calls, looking up contacts etc. and ultimately, I gave up. The TyTN - despite good memory size - also used to hang up and this despite regular memory management using Memaid, clearing caches etc. I used SpB Shell and related software to get better GUI but still it hung up...Overall, the \"stickyness\" of this platform caused me to wait for the simplest of functions such as for a contact to be found on my database and for him/her to be dialled out : tedious and impractical in a fast moving media business. Some aspects of being unable to Cut and Paste within WM6.1 applications gave me alittle heartache too. I did not care for WM6.1 onscreen touch-based virtual keyboard dialling software, prone to a few errors...pretty unslick.WM6.1 did render Internet Explorer/browsing and Windows Media Player/videos in much better performance and true HTML colour content than the Nokia e71 can manage (-Nokia is abit simplistic despite its marketing lines). I reccomend TyTN and WM6.1 here. Wifi connectivity with HTC TyTN II too is lightning-fast compared to slow and difficult to connect aspects of the e71 - very poor (I still can't get my Nokia to browse smoothly with my home wireless Netgear router).However, Nokia e71 in terms of intuitive handling is streets ahead of my TyTN II. Contact location and dialling (of the same database of 2000+ contacts as on TyTN) is achieved far more smoothly, faster by a long way, and in a more pleasing manner (to handle messaging options etc.) than, sadly, the HTC/WM6.1 combination ever could. Ultimately as a business user, this matters more to me. I do not miss the touch screen of WM6.1 at all. I can work faster with Nokia's Symbian OS drop down menus (+ D pad switch) which are far less intimidating than some reviews I read before purchase. And the form factor (slimness) of the e71 is all the more remarkable compared to the small but decidedly chunky and swivelly HTC. The e71 keyboard - vital for me - is a little more dainty but it is manageable even for big hands (I need to edit docs). I do not miss the admired TyTn II keyboard that much and am not that much slower on the Nokia either. The e71 battery life is also very good, two full days of heavy use+ and faster (2-3 hour) charging than the HTC. Call clarity is better on the e71. I do not use Bluetooth handsfree.All in all, if you want a mobile with more phone-type use, easy scheduling, faster lookups, adequate but not picture saavy photos, great form factor and battery, good enough keyboard, and intuitive use (I never consulted a manual)... then the e71 is a great phone (remarkably at half the cost!). If you are more into heavy Internet Explorer browsing and want all the richness of HTML-type displays, albeit in tiny form, or want very detailed scheduling options/contact parameters/heavy real GPS options, touchscreen... then maybe WM6.1 plus TyTN II is a way (the hardware I feel is ok, but it is the platform that lets it down). As a result of my experience, I will stay off WM6.1 phones myself for a while until significant \"portability\" by Microsoft is evidenced. I miss my Palm Treo 650's OS which, though dated, gave instant satisfaction (touchscreen).", "Date": "January 28, 2009"}, {"Title": "Almost perfect", "Author": "Chris Selland \"Chris\"", "ReviewID": "R34IPQ5E65LXNQ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I love this phone - I am a big Apple fan but need a 'real' keyboard.

I gave up trying to drain the battery out on this one.Call quality is excellent and the earpiece is loud. Keypad is nice and comfy. Symbian OS is really snappy with no lags, and supports multitasking. No crashes or reboots after 3 weeks of ownership. E-Mail setup was super easy. There is a wee bit of learning curve with Symbian, but I could master this phone in 2-3 days with little help from the manual/online forums.The out of the  box feature set is awesome. It is the swiss knife among smartphones. Bluetooth stereo, Podcast, music player, GPS, WiFi, VOIP, MMS, email push, POP and IMAP support, calendar and contacts sync, Microsoft exchange compatibility, full web browser, QuickOffice, PDF, zip..you name it, this phone comes with it. There are tons of 3rd party apps available online for Symbian OS.And the most important of all it works as a phone!. Very good reception like any other Nokia, and the call quality is superb.Only cons I can think of are:- Finger prints on the stainless steel and glass surfaces.- Camera is nothing special to write about.- Email clients are adequate for an average consumer, but not enterprise grade.- 2.5 mm audio jack needs special adapters (cheap) or Nokia earphone.", "Date": "September 30, 2008"}, {"Title": "AT&T; Says This Smart-Phone Uses More Than 3G & My Data Plan Triped.", "Author": "Pamela V \"\"MS V\"\"", "ReviewID": "R1VROUAUZMDB9V", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I love this phone but my data charges immediately tripled.

Negatives on this phone could be the challenge sometimes of configuring networks etc especially the first time as the GSM operator will typically preconfigure all settings to consume the data network of the GSM operator and it is a challenge to reconfigure everything to reset networks to Wifi etc. But I recommend this phone 100% even to this day ;  if you are doubting betweek the E5 and the E71 I would still go for the classic E71 as the E5 does not measure up.Nokia please dont lose this succesful  franchise of the E71 - update it and make it even better !

After having an opportunity to truly evaluate and use it, I thought I'd weigh in with my review.  For those looking for an alternative or an unlocked world phone, the Nokia E71 \"answers the call\"!  Okay, all joking aside, the E71 smartphone has a quality look and feel and is constructed well (made in Finland), lightweight, and user-friendly.  The E71 runs the Symbian S60 OS, which provides familiarity to those who have owned a Nokia phone before.  The E71 I purchased came with Nokia GPS for free as part of the Symbian S60 3rd edition.  The pros to running the Symbian OS is that you can utilize a great deal of apps, both for sale and for free.  Another app that comes to mind is Joikuspot, which turns the E71 into a wireless hotspot.  Other pros are the speakers (both handset and loudspeaker), form factor, ease of use, switchable home screens (work or personal), keyboard layout, Wi-Fi, camera w/ flash, etc.  This smartphone has taken my life organization to a whole new level with the very intuitive and easy to use calendar, seamless email, and messaging setup.  There are also a great deal of accessories which can be had with this smartphone.  Last but not least, the call quality is great with this E71 and I have experienced no issues with clarity, and only 1 dropped call since I've owned it (I suspect that it was due to low cell signal as I was on the edge of the tower at the time).

Unlike Blackberry's cheap plastic looks the metal covers really gives it a stylish and sturdy feel. It's thinner and lighter than most blackberries. - GPS (8/10): Very good GPS, works very well with Google Maps. The built in GPS application is handy for calculating trip distance/current speeds etc. Very handy indeed. Nokia Maps are not very easy to use though. - Camera (8/10): Good cellphone camera with easy controls. Decent flash for night photography. The lens could be a little bigger. - Apps : Easy to load Google, Youtube etc. But not many frivolous apps on Ovi store (which may be a good thing).  - Easy to view/modify Windows Documents/Presentatations/sheets.- Saves lots of money on T-mobile Network (you pay $9.99/monthly for unlimited Internet). Will pay for itself in an year when compared to using a Blackberry phone.Cons:- Does not run on 3G in T-mobile Network.- Screen and Display  - Why is the screen so tiny? Why? Nokia left out a big band the top and bottom which could have very well been excellent addition to the Display real-estate (which would be a huge benefit when browsing)  - Screen resolution not sufficient (Nokia did not fix this even in E72! Not buying any future upgrades until Nokia upgrades the screen)- Buttons are a bit cramped.- No 3.5\" headphone Jack (fixed in E72)- Messaging not adequate.

The Nokia PC Suite software allows you to link up your phone with your computer, and move files back and forth, including contacts, photos, music... You can even write text messages from the computer while the phone is connected.The 3Mp camera is great, takes great photos and videos.I use the camera for personal things, but it does have the neat feature to toggle back and forth being a work profile and a personal one, to keep things separate.The only disappointing feature wear the earphones that came with it, which don't really work.

Nokia has highly-Integrated several Powerful Feature Sets, that includes, GPS with Nokia Maps, Wi-Fi, Stereo BlueTooth, MicroSD Slot, Barcode, Sync, Radio, Recorder, Podcasting, QuickOffice, WLAN, and Quad-band GSM + US 3G compatibility via 850/1900 UMTS/HSDPA plus GPRS/EDGE capabilities.* Beautifully rendered with a Stainless Steel case, etched Graphics, and Cool metallic finish, and is notably THIN in size!  High-Resolution 2.4 inch screen, easy to use, one-digit tactile QWERTY.* Operates on the GSM Cell Frequency therefore, has more Versatility not only with GSM carriers like AT&T;, T-Mobile & Rogers, but GSM is most widely used in the rest of  the World.You just change out your SIM Card in wherever 'Country' you are traveling in and Presto ... You now have a Local and/or International Number, based on their Local rates!* You may also use Skype Lite 'inside' the fabulous Fring application and place Call's & Text's via Wi-Fi !!!!* BlueTooth is one of my most favorite features as I can Send & Receive > Music, Photo's, Movie Files and Word/Text Files, to ANY other BT Desktop or Laptop, as well as,  Print to my Canon BT Printer! Now how cool is that!* The Symbian 9.2 OS is Rock Solid and has NEVER Crashed on me!* Now for the Downside - 4 major drawbacks, at least for me, are:1. The 3.2 MP camera takes so-so photo's, but the Video is actually better! This could be fixed with a simple Software Update. (The Carl Zeiss 5MP camera is better!)2. Not MAC-compatible! It should have a Mac Version Updater!!!!3. Firmware Updates - Strongly Recommend that Nokia support all Future Updates, by giving Customers several 'Download' Options, like  Firmware Updates \"packaged\" in DMG, & Sis FILES; that can easily be downloaded directly online. Nokia R U listening?4. The iPhone has stolen the Show with AMAZING Free & Buy Applications that are being released right now and every few seconds! Nokia has FAILED to offer any  and/or enough Number of App's that even come close to Apple's.Conclusion - My Unlocked Nokia E71 has been in service since October 2008, exactly 1 year and has Performed Flawlessly.I signed-up with AT&T;, received a Free SIM card, have Multi-Media On-Demand (Text, SMS, etc) and getting 3G service.Very pleased with this purchase; however, my attention is beginning to wander over to the New iPhone 2010 model.I will most likely keep my E71 as a back-up and for travel abroad. Nokia's Technical Department, has been So Slow to respond to any Inquiries regarding updating it's Firmware (for which I have to keep a WinDoze Box around just for my Nokia). Not COOL!Overall Rating - I gave the E71-2, a 5-Star Rating because it's an Awesome Performing Communication Device. Seems that every week I discover yet another Cool Feature, that I may explore. However, I'm giving Nokia-USA only 4-Stars, simply because of the drawback's (con's) mentioned here.A Final Word of Caution - This Smart Phone / Device is for Smart People!", "Date": "October 12, 2009"}, {"Title": "Good Phone", "Author": "Joe", "ReviewID": "RFQ8UVCARNXNN", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This phone is a lot better than I expected.

The reviews seemed great, even YouTube videos from users demonstrating that it really is a full featured service with nothing cut or sacrificed. So I decided to take a plunge. Ordered up the unlimited $45 plan along with the best phone, the Nokia E71. After receiving my phone. I ported my number to Straight Talk. Everything went smoothly, within a few hours I had my number on Straight Talk. I started using my new phone and immediately felt alienated by the super counterintuitive and ridiculously antiqued interface of the Nokia E71. The menus, the submenus, and submenus thereof are just a complete opposite of the simple, clean interface of the blackberry 8900 I had previously. I decided, to stick it out and give it a thorough effort. In the next few days, I pretty much mastered the Nokia interface, and even though it is still very annoying, I pretty much got the hang of it. In the next few days of usage, I noticed that the call quality is worse than with my previous service. I had a few dropped calls, that I have never experienced before, And finally I realized that the phone was not able to make and receive calls at all while showing full signal strength. I rebooted the phone. It helped. Two days later it happened again. All of a sudden my web service went out while browsing. I tried making a call. Nothing! this is with full 3G strength. I rebooted the phone. And after it rebooted I had two voice mails. Both were left and hour prior and a half hour prior. During this whole time, I haven't' received any calls  and my service was showing full strength signal. After all this, the old adage \"you get what you pay for\" doesn't ring more true than in this case. I've had enough. I placed a call to my old carrier and ported my number back.

If you are from the states or are going to use it in a country such as Costa Rica that uses the same frequencies as US AT&T; phones (850), make sure you get the US version and not the global version. Otherwise you will not be able to use the 3G capabilities in the US, only the 2G capabilities. I have found this phone reliable and the least expensive unlocked 3G phone available.

While this phone is a step down in terms of available apps and other bells and whistles, the performance as an actual phone is second to none.With every phone I have ever had, I have always had some issues with signal in certain places I frequent, whether at home or work. With the iPhone, I literally had no signal more than half the time. My bedroom is below the ground, so this has been a frequent problem not just with the iPhone but with most other phones I have owned. With the E71, however, I have not ONCE experienced the signal being unavailable at home or at work. I am always able to make a call, and always able to grab 3G signal for browsing.While the apps are a little outdated, they are very practical. The Opera web browser that you can download renders websites wonderfully to fit on the screen, even the ones which aren't built for mobile phones. The e-mail system is very easy on the eyes and functional. Downloading a threaded SMS app makes texting almost as good as with the iPhone. The operating system however is unnecessarily complicated, and this is the reason it gets 4 stars. It doesn't feel natural getting to different functions, and the settings that are available to be changed leaves something to be desired, making it feel as if you never get to really personalize the phone completely to your liking.The stainless steel construction of the phone looks and feels terrific. The keyboard is a bit small, but even with large fingers like I have, the way the keys are raised makes it fairly easy to type accurately. The screen is definitely of adequate size. The camera is nothing that will wow you, but you can take videos with this as well.Bottom line is, if you want a phone that actually functions as a phone consistently, consider this phone.

I wanted something with WiFi because I'm not planning on getting a data plan, but I like to browse the web sometimes around WiFi hot spots. I also wanted GPS, and offline maps are a huge plus given I want to avoid data plans. Writing emails and messaging in general were not a priority, but I wouldn't mind some nifty features there and would use them occasionally. The same goes for the office productivity suite, although I wanted a really good calender.Now here's what I got:- The small screen made the internet browsing experience, as well as the GPS experience suboptimal. That's not to say connectivity or the software were not good enough, it's just that using a simulated mouse pointer and a small screen was not enjoyable.- The provided calender was fine, but I really expected something more solid and intuitive, and with better features.- The QWERTY keyboard made typing things much quicker and I was pretty happy with that.So my final verdict is that unless you intend on using this phone strictly for email and business (business is a bit vague, what if it's the music business or a business that requires a lot of driving or web browsing ;) ), go get a touchscreen smart phone and enjoy the big screen (double the size approx.) and the much better web browsing and GPS experiences, without the need for that annoying simulated mouse pointer. Navigating the phone and using the interface is handled better on a touchscreen. If I were to buy again, I would definitely go for the 5800.

I wouldn't choose any other phone for business needs and I do believe it is 1st best Nokia phone launched in US. If you want cheaper version but also great phone, look for nokia e77. the only difference between these two are: plastic cover instead of metal, no GPS and just 1 camera instead of 2 as here in e71.My husband also bought this phone from Amazon Store but he wasn't fortunate enough with a price. He paid for it $342 and after 2 days price has dropped to $319. He asked Amazon for a refund of a difference but unfortunately they don't have Price Protection Policy.A price protection guarantee extends assurances to a consumer that upon buying an item, if the customer finds the same item cheaper from another or same vendor, the original seller will match the price by refunding the difference to the buyer. A time restraint of 30 days is typical, and other conditions apply which can vary among retailers. Price protection guarantee provides a powerful incentive for building online customer loyalty in an economic model that allows for easy comparative shopping and highly competitive pricing. Even before a customer buys an item, he or she can use the price protection guarantee to ask a vendor to match a lower price. I'm surprised that Amazon doesn't have it. They are allowed to change prices daily and if you aren't lucky to get a really good deal, you can get ripped off from your purchase just in a few days :(Today you can buy the same phone for way under $300 with free price protection plan from other vendors.

The only thing i can mark this phone down on is the Camera and the GPS, but i am not going to mark it down any on the ratings. Because if you want to take good pic's you get a camera and the same with GPS. All though i do feel that Nokia has engineered the GPS not to work as quickly if you stop A-GPS connection to a network. IF you do this then sometimes the GPS will take too long to connect like 20 mins or not at all. Which defeats the purpose as you've already reached your destinatino by then.

Amazingly thin and fits well in a pocket.  Also feels more sturdy with the metal casing versus the flimsy plastic on my blackjack. The OS runs well and doesn't lag.  It took a little time to get used to versus Windows mobile,  which had a pretty idiot-proof layout, but it wasn't killer.  I like the media player, especially since it doesn't limit the number of songs you can have (I had a motorola with itunes before, which I loved, but was limited to 100 songs).  The screen is pretty large and the light sensor is nifty because it makes the buttons light up when you're in a shady or dark place--literally, not metaphorically. It doesn't adjust to your emotional state, friends.  The screen looks good; even in bright sunlight I can read my emails.  Camera is amazing.  Free google maps runs great with the GPS.  Some Web sites like pandora and hulu have yet to make apps for the operating system, which is a shame.  You probably can look up the regular Web site though, but large format video would have trouble with the display.  I haven't tried pandora to see if it runs fine just in the browser yet.  Connects with  wifi as well as 3G, which is nice.  Has cut and paste ability.  I think the iphone may have recently added that, which I guess was a big deal (???).  Biggest bother to me is that the keyboard seems a little loose so that it'll sometimes shift down and lets a little line of light out from beneath the screen.  Especially disappointing since it seems Nokia put so much effort into the other details.  I mean, it has a camera for video-phoning, which I'll probably never use.  Why the slippy keyboard?  Overall, still worth the money.  Great, great phone at a decent price.note:  I read that you could tether with your laptop to connect it online through the phone.  I tried with my macbook and it said I needed to contact my provider.  I called AT&T; and they said it was a $60 monthly fee to have.  So it's not free folks, and at least not worth it to me.

Would have probably been better to at least follow other nokia layouts. You can get around this by configuring your home screens to access frequently used options.2) Keyboard keys small but that's the price of smaller and lighter.

Excellent phone reception...I've never had so few dropped calls.  My Treo 750 wasn't bad on dropped calls, but the E71 drops almost no calls...even with the lousy cell coverage at my house.  Love the thin profile of the phone, too.  The pouch that came with the phoen is great, too.  Slips easily into a pant pocket and keeps it looking great.  I'm using the phone to pick-up my corporate e-mail (Exchange Server)...this has been great, e-mails are pushed and I often see them on my phone faster than on the computer at the office!  I'm also now easily able to pick-up my personal e-mail with Yahoo and Comcast.  Much easier (and faster) than what I saw on those accounts on my Treo.  Unlike some posters, I've been pretty happy with the web browser.  Also the camera is pretty good.  I snapped a few photos at a recent Bruins game, and they looked good.My only real complaint is my Bluetooth earpiece constantly disconnects and re-connects on a regular basis after it's been connected for about 2 hours...this has happened with two different ear pieces.  It's very annoying and doesn't allow the bluetooth to \"sleep\", so I think it is also killing the bluetooth battery faster than usual.

I use it for email on the road, as well as keeping notes on the note application.  You can add a memory card to put MP3's or even movies on and play them on your phone.I previously had a Nokia E61 and loved it... until I dropped it in a bucket of motor oil and it went bye bye.  Then, in a mad panic, I went to my carrier and bought \"the best phone you have now!\".  They sold me a blackberry curve.. from the moment I bought it I thought it was crap.. totally locked down, hardly any free apps.. just a miserable experience.  I had to use that phone for nearly a year before I \"accidentally\" dropped that one in the toilet and had to buy a new one.Well, you better believe I went straight for the phone I had been dreaming of.. the E71.  I use it with Qik.com to shoot live videos straight from my phone to the web so I can be a mobile broadcaster.  I use it for my schedule, contacts.. and I sync everything to the web over the air for free with zyb.com.  Try that with a blackberry... you can do it but only if you pay money for a 3rd party program.I give it 4 stars instead of 5 because it doesn't make my breakfast in the morning.. also the 3.2 megapixel camera is awesome, but when other guys have nicer cameras, some as high as 8megapixels, you have to believe there's room for improvement.  The built in GPS kicks butt as well, but I had to download Google Maps to make it work right.  The included Nokia maps didn't seem to work right at first.

I heard about this E71, and after reading countless reviews, I purchased it. I used it for several months before I gave it away.The reason why I chose this phone was because I was looking for a blackberry alternative, something much more inexpensive, and this was my choice.The messaging, separate inboxes and outboxes get quite annoying because I find myself being unable to recall the last thing said/sent in a message. I have to scroll to and from each folder trying to figure it out, and going back again to understand the context from which I was speaking. The camera and video recording is quite good. However, the phone itself can be quite laggy, even with an 8 gig memory card inside. Music playing/searching can be quite awkward because you don't have an option to search for it, you have to scroll through and that can be time consuming. There are little modifications you can make to the homescreen or menu options, which can be a tad boring. The 'apps' or the market system they have for the phone is quite subpar. The quality of the images of the apps are not the best, but there are apps (to my surprise). The connection to wifi and such can be such a troublesome task, it took me a while to figure out and configure.  The featured free GPS didn't work for me, I don't know why. I could map myself, but that was it. The design of the phone is exceptional, I thought it was a beautiful piece. And given my small hands, I felt that it fit comfortably and was easy to use.  The keyboard can get some getting used to.  The programs that came with the phone can be found in almost any standard phone. I feel that this phone wasn't 'smart' enough for me. I feel that if you're looking for a decent phone that looks great, this is it.

Why the one star deduction? Because it does not have a critical (for me) telephony code \"n\" which would allow me to append a number at the end of a string so that I can make phone calls to Europe without entering telephone numbers twice. For example, assume I am in Greece and want make a call to a hospital I would dial 2132077000. If I am in the US and want to call this number using my calling card because it cost only 2c a minute I would call a number which has the format: xxx-xxx-xxxx-\"p\"-PIN#-\"n\" (where xxx-xxx-xxxx is the calling card access number, \"p\" is the telephony code for pause which pause for a few seconds so that the previous string of characters have been dialed before the phone continues dialing automatically the PIN# and when it reaches at the \"n\" code the phone asks you to enter a number. In this step you can enter a number manually or select one from the phone book (in this case the hospital number above) to complete the dialing process. This telephone does not have the \"n\" telephony code which means that for some people like me that make many and frequent calls to other countries the phone book will be filled quickly because it will require two telephone entries but it is also tedious and time consuming.

It's compact, does what I need it to do, convenient, and on and on... but there are some flaws I've come across unfortunately:- music player is choppy when playing an hour long dj mix. the song plays fine on the computer, mp3 cd, ipod, but not this phone. i downloaded a different music player, so we'll see if that works- internet radio seems to just shut off the phone. i haven't used this in a while, so maybe updates to the program have fixed itSignal Strength Problems- this phone drops 3G calls constantly. i've tried other phones on the 3G network in my house, near my house, and in the general metro detroit area without any problems.- i sent this phone in for warranty because the vibrate mechanism stopped working and the reception problems were getting bad. I got the phone back in like 4 days which was awesome, but second call i made, dropped call. All while showing FULL 3G signal strength. I did some research online and seems like a lot of people are having 3G signal problems with this model phone. I think it's because of the metal frame and the compact size.  This is a hassle because if I want a garaunteed non-dropped call, i need to change it to GSM only. and to use internet , i need to change it to 3G, then go back and change it to GSM.OverallIt's unfortunate that some $50 phones have better reception than this, but I still like this phone a lot. It has a lot of great features, sleek design, lots of potential, and a great company backing it. I would buy another Nokia, but I don't know about this model.

For my shortcuts I selected \"Profiles\", \"Camera\", \"Email Accounts\", \"Clock Management (including alarm), and \"Internet\", that completed my quick setup according to how I like it. Again, the included buttons for what usually are shortcut items gave me plenty of lee-way to add my own. The speakerphone is great, the screen is great, the camera is totally awesome and it has a flash (WHAT A CONCEPT!) LOL. The internet layout of the screen is pretty cool too and it loads very fast (I guess that's up to your service provider. I have AT&T;). This phone also allows you to have multiple applications open and its extremely easy to toggle between them. What you can't have is multiple internet windows open though so for example if I have ESPN open and I want to switch between that and Google, one will have to close for the other to open. The volume of the phone is pretty awesome too but you may want to download some of your own ring tones because the defaults are pretty lame. What I don't like about the phone is pretty simple.. the speed dialing is VERY limited. If you have ever owned a Blackberry your probably familiar with just holding down a letter on the QWERTY keypad and you can program a person to that button for speed dial. Well, on this phone they do the speed dial according to the \"numbers\" on the keypad. So for example if I wanted to program my friend \"Alex\", I wouldn't be able to use the letter \"A\" but instead I'd have to program numbers 2-9 (1 being voicemail). For me that's my only negative that I can come up with and that's why I say the phone is great.I also download the YouTube application and the layout for that is pretty sweet. I haven't tried the Direction/Navigator yet but will soon.I personally am getting a Blackberry but that's only because of the speed dialing and the blackberry messenger.

I'm a computer professional, writing software and running big and small software projects since 1965. My point in saying that is not to try to impress you, but rather to point out that I'm not a novice when it comes to technology like this.The hardware's nice. Build quality appears to be excellent and it just feels like a quality product. Symbian has a reputation for being confusing, but there's some method to the madness (I'm referring here to the user-interface) and it's supposedly well-engineered under the covers. But some of the choices in the apps aren't good. For example, to try to make the setup of email accounts easy, it knows about the popular providers, like gmail. gmail lets you talk either pop3 or imap4 with a separate email client and, in fact, provides some different options for each (with pop3, you can enable it on the gmail site so that your client sees only mail arriving after the time you enabled it; imap4 has no such option). The email client on the E71 decides for you that you are going to use imap4; there's no way to change it, at least that I could find. Consult the documentation? You've got to be kidding. It reads like it was written for 5-year-olds by 5-year-olds. This is a complex device, providing a lot of features, and the documentation is so dumbed down, perhaps to avoid scaring non-computer-types, as to be near useless, in my opinion.One of the features of this phone is the GPS receiver. To be useful, GPS receivers need map data, yes? If you install a brand new MicroSDHC card in this phone and then attempt to download map data with the Nokia Map Loader on your PC, it will sitthere in a loop saying \"Waiting for device\". It turns out that you need to first attempt to download map data via the phone, to initialize the directory structures on the memory card which, for some unfathomable reason, the Map Loader doesn't do. Did I learn this from the documentation? Not a chance. I found this out by googling and got the info from discussion groups populated by similarly frustrated Nokia owners and one or two who stumbled across solutions. Having dealt with that problem, I begin downloading map data for the US. After successfully downloading the data (about an hour on a broadband connection; it's a little over 1 Gb), the Map Loader begins loading it into the memory card in the phone (there's a little progress bar). After making a tiny bit of progress, I get \"Unexpected error. Sorry for the inconvenience\". Gee, that was informative. Does it preserve the temporary file on your computer after this error and use it on a repeat attempt? Not a chance. So, another hour downloading. And the \"unexpected error\" happens again. So, I google again, and surprise, surprise, there are a whole bunch of frustrated folks out there who have seen the same thing. Well, one of these good folks devised a workaround, which I've yet to try.Maps are just one aspect of this phone, but I'm afraid that it's symptomatic of the general level of software quality supplied with this device. If RIM put out stuff like this, we'd never have heard of Blackberries.Unless you are willing to put up with some pain (think Windows 3.1/MSDOS), I'd pass on this phone, or any other Nokia phone with the same software suite.[March 13 update]Well, it's been two days of struggle and I still don't have the US maps loaded into this thing. If you try to download the maps during the day, you are wasting your time. The download will invariably hang. Downloading is only possible late at night and first thing in the morning. I'm guessing that there's a bug in their protocol (I'm assuming they are using something of their own, because ftp works reliably), as well as a bandwidth issue with their website. As for the \"Unexpected error\", I'm still getting them, despite having disconnected all other USB devices from my PC (USB is a bit of a crock and I have seen situations where USB devices interfere with each other, but not with properly written drivers, such as for the iPod, a Palm, HP scanners, etc.). I'm in the process of trying a different PC and if that fails, I will switch to talking to the phone with Bluetooth rather than a USB cable. If that fails, I'm going to send this thing back to Amazon. Again, if you are not very computer-savvy *and* a masochist, skip any Nokia product with this software suite.[December 25 update]Well, I've lived with this phone for almost a year now and have to admit that my first take on it was wrong. It seems like I ran across everything that is wrong with this device and its supporting PC software right from the outset and I retract none of that. But, after using it for some time, I have changed my rating to 5 stars, because, on balance, there is so much more right than wrong with this phone. First of all, as a phone, it's superb -- sound quality is excellent and I have far fewer dropped calls than with my previous Motorola phone (I've read, though have no direct experience, that the iPhone is great until you try to use it as a phone). The PDA applications and synchronization are good enough that I've been able to retire my Palm. The much-maligned camera is fine for what I'd expect from a cell-phone camera. It's not a Hasselblad, for goodness sake! The music player works well, the GPS is a welcome feature (once you get the Nokia maps loaded) and Google Maps works very well. The ability to have multiple applications running simultaneously is very, very useful (I understand the iPhone doesn't support this). Email and web-browser are fine. Battery life is excellent. It's true that the UI isn't as sexy as an iPhone or the other touchscreen phones. But this thing just does *everything* you could possibly want from a phone, does it in a small, well-made package, and its UNLOCKED. I use it with an ATT pay-as-you-go account, because I actually do very little actual phoning and this is far more economical for me than paying a flat rate every month for minutes I'm not going to use. This alone eliminated the iPhone from my consideration when I bought the E71.In summary, this is not a perfect device, and some of its imperfections are glaring, but its assets greatly outweigh its liabilities. Furthermore, the perfect device doesn't exist, so if you are looking for a remarkably capable smart-phone with this physical configuration, I can heartily recommend the E71.", "Date": "March 12, 2009"}, {"Title": "Sub optimal handset - avoid", "Author": "Startupgeek \"Startupgeek\"", "ReviewID": "R3M7S1W1WG35MU", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "Nokia has stopped Blackberry Connect support with this phone, so unlike the E61i (which I have), one has to get a separate data package if one is on ATT. This makes this about as expensive to own as an iPhone on ATT, in which case the iPhone makes more sense.The keys are also much smaller than E61i, making texting and email much slower. Screen is brighter and phone is lighter, but that is about it.For a world traveler this remains a half-baked solution as the 3G support is region specific as well - even the iPhone and Treo support 3-band 3G. So, if you have 3G in the US, it won't work in Taiwan and Japan, which really sucks if you are in the tech business. This also means that you can't use VOIP programs like TruPhone outside the US - which is exactly when you actually need to save on ridiculously high roaming charges. And if you get the Asia 3G version ...it works only there.Basically, this is a cute non-iphone for folks who will not travel out of the US, and have very limited data package needs. Apart from that, it's an expensive paperweight and a poor replacement for the E61i. Nokia needs to get back to basics and develop phones that meet solid needs. A smartphone should be smart. And useful. And be real improvements on prior models - not just nicer candy wrapping. And we all (including me) need to really read the specifications in detail and not just assume Nokia knows what they are doing.I bought this, then had to return it after a detailed tryout which is what my feedback is based on. I was and remain rather irritated at Nokia. I expected more.I'm now waiting for ATT to get me a Blackberry Bold that's actually useful in my line of business - which is data heavy and has tons of travel useful features across US, Europe and both South and East Asia.", "Date": "October 7, 2008"}, {"Title": "It didn't work!", "Author": "Gerald Forbes", "ReviewID": "RZWEH13WCJ53T", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "Wonderful layout, just what I wanted except: it wasn't compatable with AT&T; service in Puerto Rico.

This is the least intuitive phone I have ever owned.  I've had Nokias in the past, so I was hopeful given my very positive previous experiences with Nokia. My old Palm Treo 650 is more intuitive and more user-friendly than the Nokia E71. Most critical:  The text messaging is AWFUL - it takes multiple screens to get to the text messaging application and there is no conversational view of the text messages, so each time you type a message, you have to start all over from the beginning, typing in the contact's name and without seeing the conversation/previous messages to/from the contact!The E71 phone's unlock feature is annoying at best -- it takes forever to unlock, so don't ever be in an emergency. And, when the phone is turned off, be prepared for an almost 2-minute wait for the phone to turn on and be functional.  This isn't a touchscreen phone, so it's difficult to go to a non-touch screen phone to this one (my mistake) because it takes forever to get to the features I like to use, even with the capability to put them on the \"desktop\". You have to go through five different screens to turn the ringer or phone volume up or down on the phone -- the feature is not on the outside of the phone. It is very easy to inadvertantly turn on and off the predictive text feature. And, some of the QWERTY buttons that I regularly use are not readily accessible via keyboard. Calendar or To-Do reminder alerts go off and if you don't get to the phone in time and press the annoying \"unlock\" feature in time, you miss the alert and it goes away and there is no queue for it on your screen as with previous phones I've had.  So, you have to wait until the reminder alert goes off again to see what you missed.  If you sync with Outlook, all of your recurring appointments with reminders will go off at 12 midnight -- another annoying quirk that I've had to go into every appointment or reminder and assign it a \"time\" on my calendar, which now fills my calendar and my day with another annoying task.  all Nokia has to do is look at other phones to see what works -- the Palm Treos were great and I'd go back to mine if I could because the E71 is just a pain.  The screen could be a little wider, frankly and still be a stylish phone.  It does have good video and camera quality.  The battery life is also terrible.  I have never been able to go 12 hours without the battery dying and the phone shutting down -- and I barely use the phone in the first place, so be prepared to charge this phone in the car for long drives and every night.  Don't bother with the OVI store -- it's filled primarily with useless apps.  I can't imagine what the designers were thinking of when they created this beautifully-styled piece of crap phone.

I would consider myself a advanced user who bought the phone for its extensive set of features.What I was looking for when I bought the device:* An actual keyboard* Comparatively small form factor* 3G* GPS* Contacts & Calender sync features* SIP integration (VoIP)Pros:* Build quality of the handset is quite nice. The phone survived 6 months in my pocket without any protection.* The keyboard works despite its small size really wellSoftware cons:The main reason why I rated the phone 2 stars is because of its extremely bad software. Unfortunately Nokia never developed the software beyond prototype status. The entire user interface is absolutely inconsistent, buggy and not mature.* Even if you just run native Nokia apps you will be surprised how many different ways to access the phone book, enter text or access other phone functionality Nokia came up with. The way the menus are organized seem to be completely random for first time Nokia users. All in all it takes forever to get used to this unintuitive interface.* The native email client is a laugh at best. How can a business phone be limited to 2 email accounts? I had to buy a 30USD 3rd party app to be able to run an email setup with the feature set I would have expected from the native client on a pro phone.* I got about 300+ contacts in my address book. Opening the contact list takes about 3s. If someone calls me from my contacts it takes 2-3s before I see the name instead of the number.* I use the Nokia push mail service to receive email from one specific account almost instantly. To not miss an important mail I have a long ringtone assigned to incoming mails. You would think that the ringtone stops after the first button on the phone is pressed. Not so with the E71. It keeps happily ringing till the ringtone is fully played.* The SIP implementation is useless because once the phone looses the connection to the server it never restores it again. To restore the connection you have to restart the phone. * Every time I want to access 3G with a 3rd party app the phone asks me if it should allow the app to access the internet and in the next step which connection to use. There should be a integrated rule system regulating 3G access and a possibility to set a default connection.* There is no way to disable auto capitalization.Hardware cons:* With frequent 3G usage the battery doesn't even last a day. I had to extend the period between mail retrieval and syncs to be able to go trough a day without charging.* Quality of the camera is quite badSummary:All in all I wouldn't recommend this phone to anyone. If money is no concern and you look for a shiny handset to make calls and send a text once in a while the E71 is the way to go.

As I dislike the hype about iPhones and I wanted a keyboard I went for the Nokia e71.On first look it is a convincing product. On second look unfortunately not. A few key shortcomings:- camera quality is mediocre, seems to have no autofocus and very poor flashlight quality- keyboard inferior to Blackberry- SMS cannot be forwarded as emails or to email accounts- Chinese language input extremely clumsy. No real predictive writing possible for multicharacter words, which is pretty much the norm for typing in Chinese on phone and computers. That this feature is not available was confirmed to me by Nokia customer service, as I could not believe that a 'smart'phone aimed also at the Chinese market would not support such an essential feature.- In Chinese the input is only character by character, e.g. 1st character, press return, 2nd character, return..... Imagine having to press return after every single letter in an SMS- GPS - I needed to install google maps, the Nokia preinstalled version simply does not work- everything seems to go via a cascade of menues and the menues on the homescreen are very limited.- some entries can be confirmed with the ok button, some with the return button and some with the central large button. The attribution when which button confirms is random- There is no simple key to lock the phone, one simply has to wait until it locks by itself- when returning an SMS the original SMS is not part of the returned message ('threaded' I think is the correct term).- tried to install lotus notes for traveller. The phone, at some step, insists to connect some WLAN which it had found. As this WLAN is password protected, I cannot. The phone does then not allow me to continue to GPRS and continue the setup.- after taking a picture the camera screen freezes and asks for 'Options' rather than letting me simply take the next picture. If I press the release button a second time, I am simply lead to even weirder menues- Nokia people simply LOVE menues, submenues, submenues thereof etc. etc.- when running out of power the phone always experiences a major crash and needs a significant reloading to revive - just to connect it to the charger does not do the job, one has to wait for >30min before being able to use the phone again, even if it is connected to the charger.- the phone simply loves to ask me if it should use GPRS for internet connection, even if their is no WLAN or else around.- cannot charge via USB, I found this out the hard way during a business trip.- vibrating is VERY soft, basically imperceptible- no simple, fast way to switch between vibrating and non-vibrating mode (when stepping in and out of meetings you want to be able to switch in a fast way)- email client does not have a search function- every use, even the most simple one, requires tedious downloads and installations (yahoo mail, hotmail, ovi maps......). I am glad I did not have to download an app for phoning..... And as the OVI store has decided that I am Chinese (due to me living in China) I am automatically directed to its Chinese homepage, with no way to opt for English or access their English homepage.- even though I have registered as a Nokia user, for each help request I again have to give my complete home adress, phone no. etc.- the phone deleted today by itself all preinstalled applications, giving me only the warning that these programs, which were installed by Nokia, pose a security threat- after taking a photo I cannot take another one immediately. First I have to press the 'back' button and then I can make another photo again.I am sure that if I wanted to go through the internet FAQs related to the e71 I would find lot of helpful advice on how to deal with the above problems. Probably some of the above only are because I do not understand all the options correctly. For some issues I probably need to download a few apps.BUT - the point is, for doing all of the above on my BB I did not need to visit any internet sites, I did not need to download anything, I did not once have to look at the manual, it was simple and intuitive.", "Date": "May 15, 2010"}, {"Title": "GREAT phone - read review for 2-star reason", "Author": "Grits", "ReviewID": "R3S3LQ2MHZWCMN", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "I am so disappointed this phone did not work out.  I was highly impressed with the Nokia E71, except for one essential.  Due to a hearing problem, I keep my cell phone on vibrate 100% of the time.  I tried this one in my pocket, and in a good quality waist/belt case, and could never feel it even though I'd just called it myself from our land line, and knew full well that it was ringing.  Only when I held the phone in my hand directly could I feel it - vibration was exceptionally weak.Why so harsh if the rest of the phone is so good?  Because I can't conceive of a cell phone without a usable vibrate option.  Even if I had good hearing in both ears, there are times when only the vibrate option is appropriate (school, church, work meetings, etc.).  Without it, I consider there to be no reason to own it.  No vibrate option makes for a no-go for me.I ended up getting a Blackberry Curve, and really like it, but I'd still rather have the Nokia E71 after only a couple of days using it - just as long as it had a decent vibrator.There is one \"be aware\" item with this phone - apparently NONE of the major US carriers offers this phone as an option.  I don't know why, since T-Mobile does offer it in Europe.  But I was not deterred by that, and found out that at least T-Mobile tech suppport can still be quite useful even with this phone (I had a data-transfer issue right after I got it, and T-Mobile was able to get me through the issue quite satisfactorily.Bottom Line: except for the vibrator being very weak, this would otherwise have ended up with at least a 4-star rating, and very likely 5 stars.", "Date": "May 1, 2010"}, {"Title": "CELL", "Author": "Alberto M.

However, I realized that it's not as what's hyped up to be.  The memory didn't come with the phone so I had to go out and buy one separately last night and then the map features doesn't even load but prompts many questions over and over again then it crashes.  Furthermore, I had to open the battery case then disconnect in order for the phone to work again!  The GPS doesn't work either since I have the old AT&T; service and I don't have the data plan.  I thought the GPS was a feature like you get from buying GPS separately in which it doesn't require internet service but satellite only. The short-cut email feature doesn't work either! I tried many ways to get it right but it keeps prompting me with same messages over and over again. So I had to log on to the web site feature then log into Yahoo then get my email that way, so what's the short-cut feature for if it doesn't work? Also, I had a difficult time to find where to delete the email account once you created one??!!  The number buttons are really small so when you just want to dial a number you really have to look for the right button to push.  All other features and icons are really small as well and too many to really understand which one is which.  I guess I'm used to having iPhone's bigger icons and user friendliness and now this Nokia is a big disappointment.  I wouldn't be complaining too much if this E71 hadn't been over $300 dollars. If it were only around $200 then I would give it an average rating instead of only one star. For $300 you can do much better. In fact, iPhone is only couple hundred more and worth it. I just didn't like the battery life on iPhone so I gave this E71 a try.  Before I close, I should mention that the camera/flash seems to work fine and the battery life on E71 seems to be awesome and long lasting once you fully charge it.  I may just get the cheaper version of the Nokia since I can't use email, map and GPS features from this phone.  So beware of these complaints before you order this phone for $300.Edit:Someone responded to my review by saying that since I didn't have a data plan I couldn't download maps and emails.

Out of the box, this phone doesn't do that either.  It will pull via Pop, but IMAP is only semi-supported and headers are allowed.Nokia is now offering a new service called 'Nokia Messaging' that syncs with multiple email addresses (not Exchange).

The Nokia browser is decent, and with the addition of Opera mobile (which makes up for the weaknesses of Nokia's browser), it does the web well.The phone really shines on making phone calls and sending text messages.  Just type the person's name and then push the green button to call or select text message from the slide-out menu and start texting.The OS is ugly (the contact screen and the individual calendar entries are just atrocious - sub-old-Blackberry ugly), but fairly stable and very responsive.Overall, if need an ActiveSync phone with a longer battery life and can live without great email (yes, that is an oxymoron, I know), and you have extra cash to purchase the necessary software, then the Nokia E71 is your phone.But overall, I am very disappointed in the OS, the lack of real email support that US customers have comes to expect, and the expense of all the extra software you need to buy on top of an already very expensive phone.

There are numerous products that serve this need. I bought the E71 because it promised additional features, particularly WiFi and GPS. Indeed, the promise of a GPS was my prime reason to jump into this price level rather than settle for a standard GSM phone; unfortunately, it is completely useless.Pros: The GSM worked well in several countries; however, it is difficult to find providers who support prepaid GSM with Internet connection (In the UK, O2 turned out, through a recent visit, to be an excellent provider of both).The WiFi works well so you can get your email and access web services, even if the screen and keyboard provide for a poorly designed user interface (e.g., as compared with iPhone and the likes). The camera works, but is of little value for me.Cons:1. Even as a mere phone the E71 is a trouble. You cannot dial without looking at the keyboard; and it takes some practice to hit the right keys. But the advanced features are a practical disaster.2. The GPS software simply does not work. It refuses to provide voice instructions or visual instructions, like any standard GPS. After many hours of struggling with the cryptic and useless manual and with Nokia's web site, I gave up. [Among other I followed up the instructions given to other E71 users for activating voice; I downloaded the \"map loader\" software into my Mac, then the \"multimedia transfer\" and tried to use these to get maps into the E71; but all I got is complaints from the map-loader that the phone has no memory card -- even when it has 8GB of free memory]. I managed to preload a map of London before a recent travel. But, when I reached London it turned out that the map covered a tiny section of the city and did not include such central areas as Kensington where we were staying. One bright spot is that Google Maps works on the E71. However, in the absence of voice, it is useless for navigation. Nokia should best discard its GPS software and make Google maps work on the E71; it will save itself money and save users the frustrations.3. The \"free\" radio application, likewise, refuses to play radio through the WiFi access point and requires the use of a cellular network, where you would pay for the \"free\" radio more than you would  pay for a satellite radio service.4. I would grade the user interface around 4 on a scale of 0-10 (I am a software professional). Nokia should perhaps buy iPhones for its product managers so they can learn how to get it right.5. The manual and web support are useless in resolving problems.All in all, you get a GSM camera phone and internet access -- if you can find respective prepaid providers-- with a poorly designed software and user interfaces. But then, why waste hundreds of dollars when you can get a vanilla unlocked GSM phone that will do the job. Better still, wait for the iPhone to become unlocked, or for unlocked versions of Google's Android.", "Date": "March 3, 2009"}, {"Title": "Not worth the hassle", "Author": "Baron Von Shavenwell", "ReviewID": "RMPSSGA11OOOV", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I did lots (and lots and lots) of research on the e71, which was my choice to replace a Blackberry Pearl I'd had for a couple years.  I needed to buy unlocked because 1.) my BB died one day, and 2.) I'm stuck on T-mobile.  Because iPhones aren't \"officially\" unlocked, I settled on this e71, which seems to be Nokia's iPhone alternative.After the giddiness of having a new phone wore off, I became more and more disappointed in this phone.  It is certainly no iPhone (which my wife has), and isn't much better than my old Blackberry.  Call quality is the best feature.  That's about it.Because Nokia has not updated the firmware for North American versions (e71-2 models, i.e. this one I bought from Amazon), there are a number of very annoying bugs in the operating system.  Strike 1: The OS routinely crashes and reads \"Memory Full\" when it definitely is not full, and the only way to stop the warning screens from appearing is to reboot. Strike 2: The enclosed app for corporate email, called \"Mail for Exchange\" was so bad and difficult to configure that my IT guy and I finally gave up and bought a $50 RoadSync application that works OK.  (As a comparison, it took my wife approximately 3 minutes to configure her iPhone for corporate MS Exchange email.)  Strike 3: The phone sometimes makes an awful popping sound when playing keypad tones or application chimes,  It is like the clicking and popping sound you get when speakers overload or get too much signal.  Others have experienced this on the Nokia support boards, as well, and it may be a hardware issue.OS bugs aside, there are also significant hardware disadvantages of this piece compared with the iPhone.  The screen isn't wide enough to see a full line of sender, date, and email subject on the screen.  You have to guess sometimes at what the message might be.  This makes the chances of opening SPAM from the coporate server a lot greater, in my experience.  The camera is merely adequate, and mine casts a purple hue to all pictures -- not uncommon, according to other users.  I can manually set it to Sepia mode and it looks better, but that's a pain.  My wife's iPhone takes great photos as is.By far the most annoying \"feature\" of this phone is in setting up ring tones and alert tones.  In the Blackberry, you can indicate how many times you want a tone to ring.  It seems that, in this Nokia, it's either ON or OFF.  Sometimes I want an alert to ring once, and that's it.  Maybe a single chime to let me know about an email or something.  The sounds on the e71 just keep going and going until you manually silence them.I bought this phone mainly because I thought Nokia had a reputation for quality and solid phones.  It also had a full size, real qwerty keyboard, which I prefer to the screen-based keyboard of the iPhone.  The construction of the phone is solid.  It has nice build quality.  It's pretty.  But this and the qwerty keyboard benefit doesn't make this phone worth all the trouble of the other numerous issues.My T-Mobile contract is up in February, and I'm headed to the Apple Store to get an iPhone unless Nokia updates the e71 firmware for N. America.  I'll end up selling this one on eBay for a loss, and I'll be happy as a clam to get rid of it.  Overall, my experience with the phone as my main corporate and personal communicator has been at the most satisfactory.

I'm in and out of meetings all day; I need a button on the phone to allow me to turn to vibrate on the fly.
