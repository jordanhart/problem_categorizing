{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Good deal", "Author": "Miki", "ReviewID": "R1NQF7ZWL2KZF8", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "First off, it's a great phone for the price you pay. It's as good as any other $250+ phones. The phones runs smooth with quite a few apps which surprises me. I got the phone with a 2GB sd card so that helped a great deal.Pros:- Cost effective, works without data plan thanks to wifi, decent audio output.Cons-1)poor battery life - if you use wifi or gps for a while then it'll drain the battery.2)not enough internal memory. it has preloaded apps on phone memory which consume most of the space. it's about 200MB I guess.3)2MP cam. Well it's not much of a con but for the same price, u get quite a few phones with >2mp cams.This makes a good first smartphone if you didn't get one yet. It pretty much serves the purpose without shelling out big bucks.", "Date": "April 12, 2012"}, {"Title": "Meets all my expectations", "Author": "Diego Rodriguez", "ReviewID": "R22WDKNE2SUWS9", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "The product meets my expectations, the price is low, the functions provided are sufficient for what I need, I recommend to people who need a practical and affordable mobile", "Date": "May 15, 2012"}, {"Title": "Great Little Phone", "Author": "RW", "ReviewID": "RZRMCVLCRE1H4", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I bought two of these phones.

I checked phone navigator & Tom Tom navigator at the same time,phone reacts quicker.CONS:-doesn't keep charge when use applications,like after 2-3 hours needs recharge.I'd rate 4 out of 5 because of battery.", "Date": "July 10, 2012"}, {"Title": "Great Phone!!!", "Author": "aragua11", "ReviewID": "R1U0DDRGBAX9A1", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Great Phone, exceeded all my expectations, good size, unlocked, 3G 900/2100, works great.

It appears to be brand new and was unlocked. I just popped in my sim card and it worked right away. I connected the internet using wifi and then with my service provider. I experienced no difficulty on that end.Like other earlier reviewers commented, the keyboard is a bit small and I often press the wrong keys. But all in all, so far I LOVE the phone - it is compact, light, fits in my purse or pocket quite comfortably, and easy to use. I also like that it came with a 4g sd card.P.S. I would like it ti be updated to play Candy Crush Saga.", "Date": "September 7, 2013"}, {"Title": "no too good deal", "Author": "Alexus", "ReviewID": "RJXL58H28BS9V", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "This phone comes with a cheap adaptador for the European version charger and the cellphone has not a earphones included, if you do not speak English the only others two languages are oriental...", "Date": "May 14, 2013"}, {"Title": "ME ENCANTAD", "Author": "legnay", "ReviewID": "RJRN1HTQE4K1P", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "EXCELENTE TIENDA LOS RECOMIENDO Y MUY BIEN EL PRODUCTO LLEGO A TIEMPO Y BIEN EMBALADO JUSTO LO QUE PEDI LOS RECOMIENDO", "Date": "April 15, 2013"}, {"Title": "phone for the road not for the people like to use phone like small computer", "Author": "J Sa", "ReviewID": "R3Q5RLGRUPCCZB", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "great phone little difficult to work initially and battery do not last longer, but the reception and applicability are great and it is unblock for me it is great I travel a lot oversea", "Date": "March 18, 2013"}, {"Title": "great phone", "Author": "Francisca O.", "ReviewID": "R2GC3M89ZJB3IQ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "phone arrived on time and works perfect no hassle getting it to work.the only problem is that it is too small n I was expecting something bigger.either than that,this  is goooood.", "Date": "November 14, 2013"}, {"Title": "Nice", "Author": "Vanessa Sanchez", "ReviewID": "R2SORHN18HRFQ3", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "It is exactly what I expected.
