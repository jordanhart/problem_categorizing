{"Reviews": [{"Title": "A worthy successor to the no-frills Nokia 1100", "Author": "J. Johnston", "ReviewID": "R2II8XNJLE6WV3", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Like many people out there, it seems, I was looking for a successor to one of TracFone's most common phones, the monochrome Nokia 1100.  TracFone's lineup has diversified somewhat over the last few years, with phones that range from the minimal Motorola W260g Prepaid Phone (Tracfone) to the robust Samsung T301G Prepaid Phone (Tracfone).The LG 410 is closer to the lower end of TracFones than the higher end.  There is no Bluetooth, no camera, only one built-in game, and no apparent way to add any more.  TracFone's data service is 2G, runs about as fast as yesteryears 56K modem, and is limited to a few TracFone sites -- no web surfing here.  Of course, people don't buy TracFones for exotic features; there are plenty of other cell companies that offer smartphones and broadband data plans.  People instead buy TracFones because they are one of the only cell phone plans available for under ten dollars a month.  TracFone is a dirt cheap option for people who only need cell phones once in a while, and for those looking for a basic phone to get the job done the LG 410 is a solid, affordable option.Owners of older TracFones will be pleased to know that this is certainly a less embarassing phone to carry around than some of TracFone's older models.  It's compact, sleek, and has a nice, bright color screen.  All the basics for making phone calls, like address books and speakerphone capabilities are here.  Calls sound good and the phone has good range.  Just as importantly for infrequent TracFone users, the phone holds a charge for a long time.  One small but appreciated feature is the phone's external display, which shows time, battery charge, and signal strength when the phone is in its clamshell position.  The only serious nitpick I saw specific to this phone was the rather flat button surface, which makes this a less-than-ideal choice for texting.  Given the clamshell design, though, this may be unavoidable.Overall, this is a pretty solid phone, especially for the price, which is about fifteen bucks at the time of this review.  Some retailers currently have a bundle for that same price that also throws in a car charger, a hands-free microphone and ear bud, and double minutes for life.  Even without the bundle, current TracFone users who transfer their minutes to this phone will get an extra two months to their service, which essentially makes this phone a free upgrade.  If you're an occasional cell phone user who just wants a reliable phone to make calls every once in awhile -- and who doesn't care about Bluetooth or other bells and whistles -- this is a great option.", "Date": "January 16, 2010"}, {"Title": "Best Tracfone I've Had To Date", "Author": "Stephen Rice \"STR\"", "ReviewID": "R14PYBUHWU7AFT", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Okay where to start. I've used Tracfones for many years, just about since they first became available. I've owned several that Tracfone contacted me about telling me I had to get a new phone because of upgrades where my old one would not work any longer so I've had a few now. My wife and I both have them and I actually have two Tracfones myself, one set up for another zip code for when we visit family which is frequently. My other Tracfone is a Nokia 2600 which I have no complaints about really but this is a better phone.The truth is I don't want a monthly payment. I could afford any company or any phone I wanted I just like not having a bill coming in the monthly and I don't talk a lot on the phone anyway so this is perfect for someone like me. Also, I am not interested in all the bells and whistles of so called high tech phones. Text messages, browsing the web and games along with other things such as these extras are no concern to me at all and I'd just as soon find a quality phone that picks up a signal well, that isn't muffled when I'm listening to someone on the other end, that rings good and loud so I can hear it when it goes off, looks half way decent and is easy to operate for the computer illiterate among users.Every phone I've owned has had something I didn't care for. This one is no exception but its only two small things really and other than this I have no complaints. The C button is too easy to hit by accident when scrolling and the OK button is too hard to miss also once you open up the menu. I've found that when I'm going to my speed dial and scrolling through numbers that its very easy to clear it and have to start over particularly when walking so its necessary to have to stop and look down. In truth this is a plus for me because this has pretty much stopped me from using the phone while driving which is something my wife loves. Its impossible to do it while doing something else anyways so no point in trying at least for someone like me with fat fingers this has been the case. I have no trouble when I can give the phone my focus though so once I am free to make the call or look up the number its no issue really.The phone is light weight. Its good looking, and slim so its easy to stick in the pocket and forget about. I find its no trouble hearing people on the other end and that its easier to manipulate and get things done with compared to my Nokia. The color screen is a plus, the outside read out for time, battery life, signal and so on is a plus also and I really like that feature when its in 'clam shell' mode. Its also got a hands free speaker phone and although I've only used it once when I was driving and my wife held the phone its definitely a nice feature there too. All for fifteen bucks and some change at Dollar General. I can't argue with getting two free months when I transferred minutes much. Its rings nice and loud for the harder of hearing too so to me that was also a plus.Is it the be all end all to phones? Probably no where near, but for fifteen bucks and all you do get I don't see how we can complain really. I've been happy with most everything I have ever bought that was made by LG. This is my first phone by them. LG phones came highly recommended to me by friends and I was told they were well done and this phone is that I think. I've dropped it several times hard and it doesn't seem to care. Dinged and dented and still working fine so to me its all signs of yet another phone Tracfone will probably have to tell me to quit using again due to some upgrade in the system later and an outdated something or other on my phone just like the last three times I've been forced out of my old one.Contrary to popular opinion I think the basic phone without a lot of bells and whistles can still be both quality made and desirable. Some people like myself just want a bare bones get after user offering the minimum while still doing so with class without being cheap feeling. When I find it that works for me just fine. This phone seems to prove to me you can still find something even old retired farts can appreciate and use without feeling intimidated or like you bought something with a ton of features you'll probably never use anyways and for more money than you wanted to put down on something you can't appreciate to the fullest without your son or daughter there to baby step you through all of what it can do! I can appreciate this phone for its simplistic features and design. It was easy to set up with all my phone numbers without even having to read the instructions or ask my son to come do it for me unlike all the others I've owned in the past which I had to get out instructions on just to figure out and call for help when I got stuck trying to figure it out. It could be I'm just learning some as I go, but it could also be that LG has just made a pretty good straight forward phone than even someone not fully up to speed on all this gizmo stuff can actually use. You decide. For the money if it isn't what I say you ain't out much. I'm bettin' you'll like it.", "Date": "June 20, 2010"}, {"Title": "Great Phone, But Service Can Be A Problem", "Author": "A.", "ReviewID": "R283YYGUXCHCHU", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I spend a lot of time in very rural and downright isolated areas, so TracPhone is the best system for me. It can pick up anywhere there is a signal. The LG phone has proven tough as nails - and I'm hard on these things, if it's not rolling around on the floor of a pickup truck, it's rattling around in the bottom of a heavily loaded backpack. It's all been good - until now. I'm having a problem with the annual renewal and have found out that the customer service is horrible. I am giving them an hour on hold before I give up, & I think I'm being a fool for giving them that much time to get to me. The single time I did manage to get through, the very fast talking rep (and I mean that literally, I've heard auctioneers speak more slowly than this gal) decided I had to talk to the technicians, they'd be back tomorrow, call back then, the call's over and I'm holding my landland phone going \"Huh?\" I'd give up on the whole thing except that, and this really is the bottom line for me, when you're in places where the cell coverage is spotty, TracPhone really is the best way to go. I have to say that I think this problem is with TracPhone itself, not the phone. It seems its usual nice functional self. The LG phone is great. Just don't have any problems with the service that aren't on the web site (which is limited to activating your phone and buying more air time) because then you are screwed.", "Date": "January 16, 2011"}, {"Title": "great little phone", "Author": "very rare", "ReviewID": "R16VYSV7UUNT12", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "great price on a small lightweight phone.  wanted a flip phone instead of my open faced phone which either would not unlock or if unlocked would key numbers when it touched something in my pocket.  would definitely recommend this phone.", "Date": "January 23, 2010"}, {"Title": "Tracfone is amazing!", "Author": "pdonaldson789", "ReviewID": "R1SFZ545826443", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Ok so don't get me wrong, the phone is really, really simple and doesn't have any of the bells and whistles that you would expect.

Period.Long-ago I once had a cell phone, but let it expire and done without ever since. In rethinking I thought I really should have one when I'm out. At first I considered one of those Emergency 911 phones, but they are limited as there are other kinds of emergencies that may require more than a 911 call, e.g., your car breaking down, sudden need to call a friend, business, etc.I owned a TracFone before, and in my opinion they are the easiest and cheapest way to go, especially seniors, who don't use a phone that much. Sure, a year card may seem expensive at first, but in the end even if you don't use it, it's well worth the piece of mind knowing you have a real phone.This phone is nice, simple and has all the standard features you would expect.", "Date": "August 18, 2011"}, {"Title": "Tracfone and LG410G", "Author": "J. M. Smith", "ReviewID": "R2NPJ12V9N6ZZD", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I've used Tracfone for a number of years and until now have been quite content with the service. I bought more airtime from the Tracfone website a week ago. Normally it only takes a few minutes to a few hours to receive my minutes but this time, after waiting a week, no minutes show up on the phone. I called the Tracfone tech support and went through all the code entries the service rep gave me. She was able to get the service end date moved up to where it should be  and was able to add one more minute to the airtime on the phone but the extra minutes refused to show up. When I told her that the minutes still had not come through she stated that according to her screen they had been added and implied that I must be lying. I then asked to speak to a supervisor and she replied that she was the supervisor and that she had done all she could do. I then asked if I bought another phone if I could transfer the minutes I bought earlier and she told me that I could only transfer the 4 minutes I had. So basically, I'm now a liar and I'm screwed out of $31.00 for the minutes I bought. Needless to say I'm not happy with Tracfone and I won't be buying any more of their products or services.LG 410G Flip Phone (TracFone)", "Date": "September 21, 2013"}, {"Title": "My Phone", "Author": "Wayne Lipcamon", "ReviewID": "RHBMKG1XR7A5E", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "No Camera in phone as advertised.
