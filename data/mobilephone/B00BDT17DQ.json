{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Great performance and build quality for the price", "Author": "Lex", "ReviewID": "RRSWPZ4QV1A5W", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I got this phone for a little over 300 dollars and the more I use it the more I like it.===Software===I can't comment on the stock software since I almost immediately started flashing custom ROMs (highly recommended, not as dangerous as you might think). As far as that goes, the latest cyanogen mod is officially supported, and there's a great variety of other ROMs on XDA (I prefer PAC-man). I played around with the BRAVIA engine a bit before I flashed it away, and I wasn't too impressed. It pretty much just ups the contrast.===Color/Material/Build/Style===I got the black, which I'm very happy with. I haven't seen the white in person, but judging from the material used for the cover I'm thinking it would not look very good (much like an oreo cookie). The cover does not really inhibit fingerprints as claimed, but that's not a big deal for me. It gets cleaned off every time I put it in my pocket (along with the screen). It's a solid feeling phone and I very much like the silver accents for the buttons and around the headphone jack and camera. Unfortunately this was one of the last models before Sony started making the power button larger and more eye-catching. I noticed that the positioning of the buttons has gotten some negative press, but I actually prefer it. I don't exactly have small hands, but reaching all the way up on the phone when you're holding it from the bottom (supported with pinky) would be difficult. Sony made a good choice here.===Connectivity===***Supports Wimax (T-mobile 4G) up to 42 Mbps (if you can get it). This seems to be the fastest 4G support before needing LTE.***WiDi AKA Miracast is officially supported! The introduction of Chromecast kind of diminishes this, but it's still a great feature to have in my opinion. I look forward to trying it out when I get a WiDi box for my TV.***DLNA is also supported, can't comment, haven't tried it.***Has an FM Radio which is nice to see (although I probably won't use it).***GLONASS GPS! This is the russian GPS system which can be used to compliment the USA's GPS. What this means to you is almost instant GPS locks (outdoors). I'm very impressed with this.***It has NFC which is more useful than many people realize. Aside from exchanging info between phones, you can buy cheap NFC tags for home/work/car1/car2 that allow the phone to change various settings as soon as you touch the tag. Note: screen must be on for NFC to activate.===Screen===The size is about right I think. You really don't want a screen that's too big if you prefer using one hand, and 4.55\" is kind of pushing it. I find it acceptable though. The 720p 323ppi resolution is marvelous. I've done some comparison between this phone (regular TFT), an LG phone that I returned (IPS), and my old phone (AMOLED). My impression is as follows:***Screen hue in direct light: IPS (worst) < AMOLED < TFT (best)***Contrast with screen on: IPS (worst) < TFT < AMOLED (best by far)***Color vibrance: TFT (worst) < AMOLED < IPS (only slightly better than OLED)***Viewing angle: TFT (worst) < AMOLED, IPS (equal)Regardless of the color vibrance and viewing angle not being quite as good, I hardly ever try to view it from an angle where you can notice and the colors still look great to me. IPS was actually the most dissapointing in terms of eye-candy.===Battery===The battery is not removable, but this isn't actually a huge deal for me. I've never bought an aftermarket battery for any phone I've ever had. You can still force the phone to turn off by holding volume-up and power. 1850 mAh seems a little low compared to other high end phones, but I really think the software makes the most difference. Invest in Better Battery Stats to figure out which apps and services are draining your battery. Even with moderate usage every day I end up with a nice chunk of battery left when I got to bed. If you spend a couple hours on youtube you'll probably need to charge it sooner.===Camera===If you want to just count megapixels, 13 is pretty high for android phones these days. I'm personally more impressed with the dedicated shutter button and LED flash. Also, the 1.2 Mp front camera is a noteworthy improvement over VGA.===Performance===The biggest thing for me here is the 1GB RAM. If you're coming from a phone with 512MB this is going to make for *huge* reduction in lag. The CPU is also very powerful. It uses a snapdragon S4, which is top of the line in performance/Hz (as of writing this). As in the case with PCs, don't be fooled into just focusing on MHz or buying a quad core with less single thread performance. For reference, some other phones with the same CPU/GPU combo:***HTC One S/XL/X-AT&T;***Samsung Galaxy S3 (NA version)***LG Spectrum II 4G***Samsung Galaxy Tab 2 10.1===Storage===I didn't really think I would appreciate the 16GB of internal storage since I already have a 32GB SD card, but it comes in very handy. It makes loading a bunch of ROMS at once very convenient without having to find space on your external SD. Also, android likes to clutter up your main storage card, so I can still keep my external SD clutter free and packed with even more music. Don't worry about fidling with \"USB storage mode\" or anything to transfer files on/off the internal or external card either. I think it uses MTP, so you plug it in and it just shows up in \"My Computer\".===Random cons===***Micro-SIM. Probably because it has to be inserted from the side. I have a feeling various sim card sizes are going start becoming the norm over the standard mini-SIM. I've invested in a nano-SIM punch cutter ($10).***The bluetooth/headphone volume is a bit low compared to my last phone (galaxy s 4g). This phone tends to get complaints about low volume in general.***The notification light is so dim it's basically useless. It's multi-colored though for what that's worth.", "Date": "August 3, 2013"}, {"Title": "Just good", "Author": "2ark0 \"A Geek Guy!!\"", "ReviewID": "R3589UZDW7BD0", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "This is not a bad cellphone it's lightweight, you can take good pictures with it.

And 2 and a half days later It simply died. It doesn`t power on at all!!!! I'm very dissapointted, and I'm from Venezuela so it is very difficult to return it. In theory is a great phone.
