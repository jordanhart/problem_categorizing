The battery qualtiy is average but the 5 megapixel rear facing camera is stunning with a LED flash capturing my \"Kodak\" moments. The Blackberry Curve 9360 Unlockedgot nothing on this unique phone. Also it's so trendy with the mauve and white contrast perrfectt! So prepaid carriers such as VirginMobile, BoostMobile, Are trying to make a status to, (aka Replenish and Venture).

BUT, i am very disappointed for the fact that i can not send or receive picture messages! The phone said it is un-locked, but AT&T; rig something so unless you are using them for your service, you won't be sending any picture texts. That makes me bummed because i like to take pictures and send them to friends. If i would have known that fact, i would of chose a different phone.

The company shipping did really good, but usps took forever and it arrived 2 weeks after the estimated date. I wasnt happy about that at all but it wasnt the companies fault because they sent it on time. I love the phone, but the memory space is horrible. I always have to clear memory or else the phone will be extra slow. Cant have a lot of apps either even if its on the sd card. The camera is decent. Screen is small but managable. Battery life is iffy too. For me it dies too quickly because i use it a lot.. but maybe its just me, but this is a good phone if you dont want any other apps that arent provided", "Date": "May 10, 2013"}, {"Title": "HTC", "Author": "Desiree Rodriguez", "ReviewID": "R32VJXP5OZ5URD", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "It was a gift for my cousin in Austin TX , she just had a little girl and the phone she had was all broken and did not work anymore so I bought her a this HTC it was in great condition powered up well and she loved it thanks Amazon :)", "Date": "April 24, 2013"}, {"Title": "Excellent", "Author": "Aysha S", "ReviewID": "R3CTMB9VK13J7F", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Product is as described in very good condition I love my new phone, and it came with the charger.

It's curious why HTC would put such a small memory into this phone.  if you need a phone primarily for messaging and LOTS of typing, this is it.  if you need a phone that can run loads of apps and be your personal butler, look elsewhere.  if HTC ever comes out with a newer version of this model with more memory, I would buy it again in a second.", "Date": "March 3, 2013"}, {"Title": "Love it", "Author": "Jane", "ReviewID": "R2SR4GXCMEMN2H", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Love it, so pretty.Keyboard a little small for texting,but its such a cute phone which covers every thing.Love it!", "Date": "February 22, 2013"}, {"Title": "love it.", "Author": "renruth", "ReviewID": "RHR3BUT4IYFNI", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "loveeeeeee it, i'm so happy with my phone. i bought it in July, still not bored of it. the mauve color is so cute get so many compliments.

Seller orderinstant was nice enough to send out a new one, even letting us hang on to the old one before the new one got there since it's hard to do without a phone.  Interestingly, while we waited for the old one to arrive, this defect seemed to get better, until eventually it seemed to work 99% of the time.  Maybe the screen resistors needed to stretch a little or something, but anyway, this is a great phone.  Originally $300 msrp I think, great screen, GREAT camera, facebook button, etc.  Getting good battery life too.
