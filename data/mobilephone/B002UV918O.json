I went from a Blackberry Curve to this one so I consider it a huge step up. I love this phone. There are some pros and cons to it.PROS: It's not too big like most of the Android phones these days. I also got an OTA update a day after having it which updated the OS to the latest version of Android. I like that it's fully customizable. The way the gallery sets up pictures and videos is pretty awesome. It runs pretty smoothly. I also love the Android market so far.CONS: The battery can sometimes die within a few hours even if you have all your apps off. This is probably due to the fact that the display is on a lot cause I use it all the time. Every now and again it moves a little slow when navigating through it, especially if you are playing music through the music player and trying to do something else on it. After taking a couple pictures in a row, the camera freezes up. It pops up with a message saying that it could not connect to camera. To fix this I have to turn the phone off and then turn it back on. For some reason if it's laying down on a flat surface, it wont always pick up that I'm touching the screen and trying to do something. I haven't figured out why it has done this yet.Over all I really like this phone. It is easy to use, fits perfectly in my hand and allows me to do the things that I need to do on it. No it's not the newest phone out there but it compares pretty well to most of them.", "Date": "July 11, 2011"}, {"Title": "My Touch 3g", "Author": "fallon93", "ReviewID": "R30TZJ2LWDA3DA", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I recieved the phone a few days before the expected arrival date which was great!

Rodriguez \"Miss Punky\"", "ReviewID": "R2TRIOVHN6JUFA", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "I think this is my second review on amazon because i never do them but for this one I need to warn people of this crap. I got the Fender edition and since I bought it I had problems with it. First it was because i couldn't use the camera because it didn't read the micro SD. Chatted with a T-Mobile rep and told me to restore the whole phone, I did and it worked for just 2 weeks, also this happened the very first day I bought it! Because I got tired of restoring the phone every time it stopped taking pics, I had to take the sd out and put it in so it would work.But What really completely killed it was this January when finally I got the message saying that I can update to Froyo, I did and was the worst decision ever. It freezes, it doesn't load sometimes, it takes an hour to download a 200+kb app, it shuts down randomly, it over heats, the battery only last 3-4 hours without me using it at all, typing takes forever since it freezes every time you click on a letter and the only thing that can actually works fine is a solitaire app that I downloaded. I even tried to restored the phone but it's still the same and i know other people that got the same problem with their normal mytouch, so it's not because it's the Fender edition.Positive things- well the fender edition is pretty, from the home charger to the earphones (which are uncomfortable as heck) and it had some music apps and like 50 free songs in the memory but because I restored the phone the very fist day I got it, I never heard any of the songs.If you buy it, just don't do the froyo update if it doesn't have it already. But really, don't waste your money on this, it's obsolete by now (and it was obsolete when I bought it cuz a month later the mytouch slider came out and like 3 months after the 4g one) For less than $200 you can get a LG G2x that is way advance than this. That's what I did, my G2x is arriving at my home on Monday :D", "Date": "April 22, 2011"}, {"Title": "MyTouch 3g cell phone", "Author": "Daniel", "ReviewID": "R2M1DH24LDLJG4", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Phone arrived as scheduled.

I have had this phone a little less than a week and I'll be honest, I'm not in love. It does what I need it to do, but it does occasionally turn itself off and back on again. I think majority of the problems that i do experience with the phone are because of connection issues. My 3G runs slow and the apps can be temperamental, the key pad when texting has a mind of its own and can lock up on you. We do live in the desert (El Paso, TX) so problems with connection could be due to that. However, on a positive note, this phone was very easy to acclimate to. Just took my Sim card out of my old T-Mobile phone and slid it into this one and that was it.

I believe I purchased this in 2009, which was one of those \"hottest phones, gotta have it, right now\". It was great the first 3 years I owned it. Since 2012, it's been rebooting randomly and the screen sometimes fade in black. The battery life is pretty horrible now, at least 5 hours and that's if I don't even use it. I use the Navigation app a lot and the battery drains in 5 minutes without the charger. I still like it because it does what I want it to do. However, my co-workers don't like me using this phone. They say I respond an hour later to their texts. But an easy solution to that was, calling me instead. It really does test your patience. I'm not a sheep like everyone else buying every new phone after release. That's stupid. This is my first and only android phone. I saved a lot of money throughout the years with this. But I think it's time to upgrade. I purchased this for $500 in 2009. I am now considering the SS Galaxy S4 which I will keep for maybe 8 years.I recommend this to anyone who will use it strictly for Text/Call. But my question to you is..

I called the company that made the phone and they looked up the serial number and the phone was made in 2009 so no warranty from them. They did help me though and I had to reset the whole phone losing anything I had on there. The next day I found out it was not storing any numbers of people I had called or who had called me and that same pop up was there. had to take out the battery to stop this one!The phone itself when it works is very nice but you do need an SD card to make certain features work.

Madison", "ReviewID": "RKOIPDLA4DUZZ", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "This phone is trash. I went through three of these phones and each one was a disservice. I've had clunky junk phones work much better than this. The touch screen is trash. The phone can't process any information at all. It just lags and freezes on the home (desktop) screen until it tells me the operating system has crashed several times until it finally decides to work like an android device until the next small even occurs and the next application crashes and you try going back to the desktop and it crashes the Android operating system again. This device is slow and ineffective. It was designed to be faulty. Don't buy it. You WILL regret it... it also always has an error saying that it can't load any of the information on the flash drive even when there is no memory being stored on the flash drive... hmmm... And it doesn't matter which of the three phones you have.Like an organized device? Too bad. You'll spend a few minutes organizing your favorite apps wherever you like them and then the next time you return to it, the phone has completely reorganized your apps for you. Customer service is no help because they tell you that all the apps are listed alphabetical... yeah... from the tab you pull up from the bottom. Duh. But what about when you intentionally place them on the desktop or in folders. You can tell them what order they're listen and make it clear as day to them that the phone is not organizing your apps on the desktop even remotely in alphabetical order and they'll still insist that it is.Then they'll tell you to do a master reset. Which defeats the purpose of having a smart phone if all your pertinent information for work is stored on your phone and you're just going to wipe it all out of the picture every weekend. It's not the apps that are doing it to the phone. It's just the phone. It crashes with or without additional apps.Don't get me wrong. Android phones are amazing. I'm happy with one right now.

However, with the recent explosion of smart phones, touch screens, and the availability of so many features at your fingertips you just can't pass up the intoxicating thought of owning one of these magical gadgets.  My first few ventures out into the smart phone world were not as thrilling as the commercials would like you to think.  I found touch screens very hard to use and slow loading screens, not at all the \"wow\" factor I was hoping for.  I only chose the MyTouch phone on my husbands urging, as my current Nokia 6130 was starting to get a little shabby after over 3 years of use, and even with the data plan on it (added just this last year) wasn't really doing some of the things I wanted my phone to do very easily (i.e. I could access facebook, weather, news, e-mail and text but not very easily).  Sadly I was outgrowing my phone.  Many friends of mine own iphones and love them but, I just wasn't sure it was right for me.  They seem a little too big, too expensive, I'm not an apple fan, and I love my wallpapers.  This phone was $149 w/ a new 2 yr contract.  I didn't know how I would adjust to such a big jump between my old phone at this one but after having it for a week I'm really enjoying the new phone.  The app store is awesome!

The touch screen is extremely responsive, and the multi media capabilities are wonderful.
