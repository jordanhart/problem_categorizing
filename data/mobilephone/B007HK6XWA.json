{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Really pleased", "Author": "Brad Burke", "ReviewID": "R213SIC4T0X70P", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I wanted an inexpensive unlocked Android phone with at least a 3.5\" screen that was compatible with my cellular provider; Consumer Cellular (USA). I could have purchased a phone along with their service but none of theirs had recend versions of Android OS on them. So, I decided to get an unlocked Android. The Sony Xperia U had a great price and a recent version of Android on it. It came with Android 2.3 (Gingerbread) but supposidly, it will be able to upgrade to 4.0 (Ice Cream Sandwich) before October 2012. We will see.Consumer Cellular sent me a SIM chip that worked perfectly in this phone. I immediately got cellular service. However, I had no data service so I couldn't read email or have any internet access. To fix this, Consumer Cellular sent me a text message with some configurations setting in it. That did the trick!I used to have an iPhone 4 but I like this even better. The two things that bothered me about the iPhone were the lack of voice input when creating an email and the poor speaker phone quality. Both of these are done really well in this Xperia U. It's screen is just barely big enough for me to type with my big thumbs but the screen quality is even better than the iPhone. The speaker phone is much better also.", "Date": "September 17, 2012"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": null, "Features": null, "Name": null, "ImgURL": null, "ProductID": "B007HK6XWA"}}
