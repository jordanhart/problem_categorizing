In fact I sent several messages to everyone concerned but you have ignored all of it. So I will not use your company to purchase anything anymore and this is for sure. In fact, I will also tell about my experience to my family who I know buys a lot from you. This is my review on the product and about your company.", "Date": "November 30, 2010"}, {"Title": "Excellent Seller", "Author": "rbolivar720", "ReviewID": "R22387T6Z9R3SO", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I received the product in perfect condition as it indicated the seller, I recommend it 100%, it has worked very well! has the Blackberry operating system which allows me to enjoy many applications, including use much to my studies because it is very useful in every way!", "Date": "December 9, 2012"}, {"Title": "Ok but not fine", "Author": "Juan Ponce \"Rel\u00e1mpago Azul\"", "ReviewID": "R15CBT0ULO9S5L", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I'm not sure if the phone was new, it comes with a motorola charger, with a generic leather case.

S. Gowen", "ReviewID": "R3FKGKLTJR4WQX", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I admit that this phone is inferior to many smart-phones that are currently on the market. Those all, however, require a data plan to use. If you are like me and want a quality phone without having to pay for a data plan then this is the phone for you.Pros:-Modified qwerty keyboard. While it is not a full qwerty (most of the buttons share two letters) I only commonly run across one mix up (\"see\" and \"are\"). That is a HUGE improvement over 9 key.-A smart phone quality calendar.-It is the only phone of which I am aware that has wifi, but doesn't require data-Very good media player-Bluetooth-Great Address book options.-You can search texts-Unlimited text space (not the 500 text limit many phones have)-Voice dialing-Fits very well into a pocket-Can set any size file as a ringtone, alarm, etc....I could go onCons:-The camera and video camera are not very good. I understand that there are people for whom a phone camera is more important than a calendar or address book or wifi then this is not the phone for you.-After a year or so of use the track ball needs to be cleaned or replaced for $0-$5 depending on your provider.I have used many many phones, but this is far and away the best NON-SMART phone I have ever used.
