I bought this phone for my husband and he is no electronic wiz, but for some reason he has figured out this phone like no other, LOL  I have also played with it and I am contemplating on getting one for me!", "Date": "December 28, 2012"}, {"Title": "Nice phone", "Author": "turbobirdo", "ReviewID": "R2D4ZXNFZDPRX1", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This is a very nice, high quality phone. It is not the newest thing around, but is good enough for everyday use. The camera loads a little slow, but it takes great pictures and the videos record very well. One thing I did not like is that I cannot load photos directly to Facebook. I have to download them to my pc via usb cable first. Also, this works perfectly with Page Plus cellular services, so I am able to pay only $12 dollars a month for  cell service. Overall, if you want a phone for texting and talking and light internet usage such as Facebook and email, this is a great phone. If you are a heavy internet user and like to play a lot of online games, you may want something else. For me, this is almost perfect.", "Date": "September 5, 2013"}, {"Title": "love it", "Author": "tracie", "ReviewID": "R28SAG7MTL4W1", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I love this item first droid I've owned and its great.the shipping was quick and the company even contacted me when there was a problem with my address.would buy from this seller again.and I'm actually getting 2 more of these phones for my kids.", "Date": "March 13, 2013"}, {"Title": "I like it!", "Author": "Sylvia", "ReviewID": "R392IB03KRSNCC", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Is so easy to use and the battery last long at least for me, don't laggreat buy! great price!", "Date": "October 23, 2013"}, {"Title": "Good cell and all it features", "Author": "Kathy", "ReviewID": "R35Y4RT2QF5Y8N", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "yes love this phone it is really does what it say .

Since it's my first smart phone, I can't compare it to anything more modern. However, it has a working browser, Google search and maps, navigation, calendar, 5 MP camera, can be tethered to my laptop with PDANet, and does everything I need, all on Page Plus Cellular. This phone runs Android 2.2.3, so it's not going to astound anybody with the latest bells and whistles, but it works just fine. The touch screen keyboard works just fine, so I hardly ever pull out the physical keyboard, but it's there if I want to, and it works, too. I would recommend this phone to anybody who wants web and nav, but doesn't need a lot of fancy stuff.", "Date": "April 1, 2014"}, {"Title": "Not too bad", "Author": "R.

It started out fine for about 2 weeks, then I lost control of answering calls, dialing out, the screen refused to respond half the time, things like internet browsing or google maps were just not possible.  I am not a heavy phone user, talk/text/data i don't use much of it, I took good care of it but in the end it was just to much to overlook.  They offered me a refund or a replacement.  I took the refund.
