I do not have any issues with the phone and what it does for relatively inexpensive phone. The battery in the first one quit after 8 months...it would charge then be dead within an hour. The second phone was purchased in Oct 12 and yesterday is showing same symptoms as previous battery. It will not even charge.....when plugged into outlet, it says, 'Recharge battery', even though the battery charger is connected. Left plugged in all night....nothing. Replacement phone is $89. 3rd party battery replacement is $27.  Sri, I have had enough....", "Date": "February 28, 2013"}, {"Title": "Good phone for Dual SIM function", "Author": "Michael S.

The specifications suggested I could also use this in Canada. It worked on an AT&T; SIM. Different story in Canada.Bell Mobility website said \"Your device must be compatible - it must be HSPA (or UMTS) and 850 MHz and 1900 MHz compatible\" Typical GSM phone specifications. After receiving the phone I entered the IMEI number it came with (Press*#06#) and found that it was not compatible. Did not work on Rogers, Telus and others either. Bell is my telecom service provider, I get 35% off their services as a pensioner. Good incentive right!It would be great if:(1) A specification savvy Amazon shopper, comments on why I messed up on the specs. This dual SIM phone seemed ideal for our minimalist feature needs.(2) I still need an entry level inexpensive smartphone that I can use on Bell Mobility in Canada , while in the USA or when wintering in Thailand, Indonesia, Singapore and Malaysia. As seniors, we need a phone for calling, text, camera and wifi for our safety. Would a supplier for such a phone on Amazon.com recommend a smartphone priced under $125 and include it's IMEI number, so that I do not screw up again.Samsung Galaxy Y Duos S6102 Android Dual SIM Quadband Unlocked", "Date": "June 9, 2013"}, {"Title": "I'm very satisfied - This is a Great option !", "Author": "F.

I bought this and it worked well as she had two sim card with two numbers and didn't want to give up any.A drawback is that you have to manual switch the active line for outbound calls. The previous dual sim phone my mom had gave the option on screen to select the line for the outbound call. It can be a bit annoying and took some effort explaining this to my mom. Also the phone does not seem to autolock after periods of no usage which can be annoying, I have had my mom''s phone call me on multiple occasions without her knowledge.All in all it is a great phone, I mean she now uses Whatsapp and some other applications which I never dreamed she would understand.

I purchased this to use through Straight Talk on the AT&T; network, which it does great. I regret that now as I see Straight Talk now offers phone on Verizon and not the horrible Sprint network, which is why I hated their Android service. It is slow to load and the camera is not auto focus...not a big deal you may think at first, but for banking I would like to deposit my checks using the deposit app, but the phone is blocked from downloading the app because of the lack of autofocus. Other than that the simple games seem to work OK and anything else I've used it for. The signal strength appears to be a bit spiratic and lost one call in little over weeks time.
