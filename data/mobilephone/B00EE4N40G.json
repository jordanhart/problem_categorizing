After a month I am quite pleased. The battery life seems about average (below what was advertised) but I do use GPS all the time & bluetooth very often.The sound quality is excellent, the build quality seems OK, but yes, it is boring-looking. The 4.5\" screen is the primary reason I bought it. My only complaint is having to get used to Android 4.1 coming from 2.3If you're on a budget, I'd highly recommend it.", "Date": "October 24, 2013"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": null, "Features": null, "Name": null, "ImgURL": null, "ProductID": "B00EE4N40G"}}
