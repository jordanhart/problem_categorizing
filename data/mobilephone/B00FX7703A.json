{"Reviews": [{"Title": "If I could be a Virgin Mobile phone it would be this one!!", "Author": "Amazon Customer", "ReviewID": "R31I42G3RUMNB3", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I bought this phone off of the virgin mobile website around Christmas time for 199.99 with free shipping and I love it!!  I wanted an upgrade from my Straight Talk 3G LG Optimus Logic phone and I always desired an HTC phone but never could afford one before.  I also wanted to keep it pre-paid and virgin mobile offers 3 plans.... if your more of a texter than a talker then they have a 35.00/mo for 300 mins, with unlimited texts and web,  45.00/mo for 1200 mins, with unlimited texts and web and 55.00/mo for unlimited everything so you have options!  The phone has GOOD memory!  It has 8 GBs of internal memory on its own, so you add that to the 64 GB SD card capability and your talking about countless room for apps!  I love the two front speakers which really gives the volume a boost when your streaming youtube, netflix or pandora.  Oh and netflix streams excellent on here by the way,  especially through wifi!  I have never had a phone that had a camera with a flash and this phone has that too.  This phone does it all!  If I did have to search for a complaint I would say that the battery can drain relatively fast but that goes for most 4G smart phones.  Using the power saver option and downloading a decent battery saving app does make a difference though.  I would recommend this phone to anyone that wants a good 4G android phone in the 200.00 price range and likes to keep it pre-paid.PROS:- 4G LTE-dual front speakers-front/rear facing camera with auto flash-1080 video display-excellent flash player (good netflix and other website video streaming)-good internal memory-8GB  (with up to 64GB of memory via SD card)CONS:-when not on wifi youtube struggles at times", "Date": "January 8, 2014"}, {"Title": "Great phone", "Author": "Brandon H. \"Brandon H.\"", "ReviewID": "RAJNBFFEY7I3E", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This is my 3rd Virgin Mobile phone over the last four years. I just purchased this one as a upgrade from my HTC one V. This phone is faster, has 4g and lots of internal memory. The screen size is nice also 4.5 inches. Te speakers are nice when listening to music. I also this like fact this phone has a front facing camera with flash. Great device overall, I also like the fact that I can run multiple apps without slowing the phone down.

They had a similar deal as Amazon but I got free financing for 6mos. with VM. Now, the phone is well worth the $200-250 price. I upgraded from a LG slider 3G phone and I wish I had switched earlier. For those not familiar with VM its the best deal around, now that they have decent 4G phones. The phone itself is thin and sleek. It is very similar to the HTC One which is their flagship phone. It does not have the aluminum body but the back is the anti-slip rubber compound which feels nice in your hand. The screen is large enough and is bright. If you want a larger screen buy a tablet. This device is a phone.Pros: great sound with speakers on the front of the device. movies and web look great.Cons: camera stinks, especially in low light (inside your house)", "Date": "February 24, 2014"}, {"Title": "great deal !", "Author": "muddy", "ReviewID": "R138XAYXBIK9X3", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "loud speakers great picture very great phone ! works great haves had any iusses with phone since I got it !", "Date": "March 11, 2014"}, {"Title": "2 thumbs up and 2 big toes up lol", "Author": "Mungo", "ReviewID": "RITTMDM6F065H", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I love it. Performance wise i honestly don't a difference between the s3 I had and this phone. Call quality is great, the speakers are beyond loud, the rear camera is good and the front camera looks too artificial. Compared to my Motorola g the screen looks washed up but that's because the Moto g has a 720p screen and the HTC doesn't but it's still a good screen just doesn't look as sharp. The battery is good I brought my phone used so I would say a new phone would last a day with moderate to heavy use. I would recommend this phone simply because its a 4g phone with expandable memory with a decent camera and it can handle a load of things without slowing at all. It's made by HTC all they know how to make is quality.", "Date": "April 28, 2014"}, {"Title": "Just as good than higher priced android phones.", "Author": "Doggonemad 12", "ReviewID": "R3VYTRMNFBABIG", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Uses more battery power than it supposed too.. Other than that it seems like a good android phone. It has very good features and is capable of doing just as much as the more expensive phones. I had plans on buying the samsung galaxy SIII, but there price still seemed a little to high at this point...,Overall I'm happy with this purchase and would recommend it to anyone, who's looking for a dependable android phone for under $185.00., with a no contract service!", "Date": "April 12, 2014"}, {"Title": "Nice phone.  Getting accessories for it too.", "Author": "Jason D Russo", "ReviewID": "R3E9GWKJU5IN6T", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I also bought this phone around Christmas when Virgin Mobile offered it for $199.  It has honestly changed my perception of phones. Love the small size, and very responsive touch screen (actually, it's a bit too responsive, but I was able to correctly that mostly by changing the touch sensitivity settings).  It runs android apps quite well, although I mostly just use if for email and Twitter, but occasionally I watch some YouTube & listen to tunes & radio with it.  Battery life is pretty decent too.  It'll last about three days on a charge, if I turn off the battery sucking features like location services & auto sync.  Otherwise they'll cut battery life to about a day, which I guess ain't too bad either, but I don't see the need for those things so I leave them off.About the only thing I can complain about is the Sprint service, and perhaps the fact that I cannot get data and voice at the same time (which is a little bit of a pain when I'm trying to talk to a friend and find someplace on maps at the same time, but perhaps I'm just getting spoiled by the phone).  I did just recently find that Sprint upgraded their 4G service in my area (and many others) about two weeks ago, so data seems to work a lot faster where I'm able to get that coverage, so that's promising.  Overall I'm pretty happy with the phone, and would recommend it.", "Date": "April 8, 2014"}, {"Title": "GOOD PHONE!!", "Author": "katie", "ReviewID": "R25JF89C1V0K3C", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I like this phone battery is absolutely awesome!
