Siri also saves a lot of time and allows for hands-free texting, calling, and music selection. Siri makes a great driving companion and helper during the cold when wearing gloves don't allow me to easily use the touch screen.In the past month since I bought this, I've been very happy I opted for the pricier 64GB iPhone since I no longer need to delete apps, and cut my music or photo albums to fit on a 32 GB. If you can sell your smaller iPhone 4S, the 64 GB may be a nice switch.

Everything works great so far and the charger, wall adapter, and headphones is wrapped brand new. I have not tested the accessories yet due to I have ones from previous devices. No marks or scratches on phone and I bought this replacement due to my original 4s was stolen. I love the 4s due to it's audio quality with apple lossless using my V Moda M100, it just sounds awesome together even with Tune In radio app. So I originally got the iPhone 5 to replace my stolen phone but while every feature was an upgrade the music audio quality through the headphone jack was not. It seems the 4s bass is a lot better on 4s than the iPhone 4 and 5, and everything sounds more balanced on the 4s . Now don't get me wrong it's not that the audio on the iPhone 4 or 5 is bad, actually it's pretty good but not like the 4s. For me that's the main deal breaker my phone's audio quality and it all started with the iPhone 4 I never realized how great music can sound on a phone. The 4s capabilities of other features is just gravy for me, and it's pictures is really nice plus the internet is fast enough for me on 3g. I get great signal here in Las Vegas where you probably seen on the commercial it's the number one carrier here. But something I never expected happened, while I was on at&t;'s website updating everything with this new phone I saw a link to an online unlock device form. Now I have three lines on at&t; and this was replacing the phone that was stolen which the line was still under contract until 2014. So I figured what the heck I filled out the application to unlock my 4s and 4 hours later got an email back that your phone is approved to be unlocked. So I followed the procedure a few hours later due to it said to wait at least 24 hours, iTunes came back with the response congratulations your iPhone is unlocked(Sweet). I think I was approved while still under contract is because this phone which is locked to at&t; but not under contract itself. So guys if you buy this and still under contract or not just go to at&t;'s website after purchasing and fill out the form and you too will have a new factory unlocked phone. This is a permanent unlock and can be used on any gsm carrier just by switching the sim card and how great is that your phone's value just went up.

I was looking for an iPhone 4S mainly for the camera. I have an Ipad2 and was considering a mini but the camera wasn't nearly as good. I didnt want to have to sign up for a contract with a cellular service provider simply to get  the phone that I wanted. After doing some research on the internet and reading about used iPhones and what to look for and how to quality test a purchase I thought that used might be the route for me. So long story short, I turned to Amazon. While browsing used phones and reading reviews I stumbled upon the Amazon Waehouse seller profile. At first I was hesitant because the product was listed without a condition description but after reading the seller profile information I found that they were claiming the product to be like new. Yet even with such a line I thought \"hmmmmm I might say it was like new if I wanted to charge someone $400 too.\" Well a new 16gb iPhone 4S from apple costs a charming $549.00 pre tax. So the $400 for a 64gb phone that will meet my desires seems like a good deal but its still more than I was willing to spend on a chance... that is until I read the satisfaction guarantee clause. Amazon Warehouse apparently offers a 30day trial with free return shipping if you are not satisfied with the product or the quality of purchased item. So with that extra measure of security in place I decided to purchase the phone and I must say that I am ANYTHING but disappointed. It has had an outstanding battery life, no dead spots for the pixels, all the factory applications work, more memory than I could have dreamed of and best of all a WONDERFUL camera. I have told all of my friends about what a great deal I scored and now they have been consulting the Amazon Warehouse page for like new items they are looking to purchase.  I'd recommend it to anyone especially with the 30 free shipping return policy. It's hard to go wrong. And with the out of box warranty offered by Square Trade I felt pretty secure making a purchase that I could also insure.", "Date": "February 27, 2013"}, {"Title": "Horrible experience!
