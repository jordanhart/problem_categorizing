{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Not Bad, Save For Crippled Internet Access", "Author": "MyBeesWax \"A Music Fan\"", "ReviewID": "R61ADHSNN2B62", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I bought this phone from Target after I inadvertently cracked the LCD screen on my LG 300. This phone has some very nice features: Bluetooth, Digital Camera (1.3 Megapixels), microSD Card Slot, MP3 Player, and FM Radio. It also has a Browser, but you can only access the Net10 site with it; access to all other sites are restricted.I'll briefly touch on each of these and other features:- BluetoothThe bluetooth works surprisingly well. I can connect the phone to my iPAQ 111 Pocket PC using bluetooth for transferring files between the units. I also have no trouble connecting the phone to my Garmin Nuvi 360 GPS unit and my Plantronics Headset. Once my Nuvi is connected to the phone, I can use the Nuvi as a speaker phone. I can also use the Nuvi to dial and receive phone calls. SWEEeeet!- Digital CameraThe quality of the picture taken with the 1.3-megapixel camera is pretty good. Each JPEG file is typically less than 100 Kb.- microSD Card SlotThe microSD slot will only read a microSD card (2 GB or less), not a microSDHC (microSD, High Capacity - 4 GB or more). If you insert a microSDHC card, you will get the message: Please remove card and insert again.- MP3 PlayerThe sound quality through my Sony earphones is decent enough. The MP3 player, unfortunately, doesn't have an equalizer.- FM RadioThe FM Radio reception is as good as any portable radio. Since your earphones function as an antenna, the FM Radio won't work unless you have your earphones plugged in.- BrowserInternet access is restricted to only the Net10 Web site. (Interestingly, some people reportedly have full (unrestricted) Internet access on the browser.) I tried a few URL's (e.g. google) but each time I got the error message: HTTP error - forbidden.The Net10 Web site has links for Sports, Weather, and News. The page loads are excruciatingly slow! It can take a few minutes for a page to load, if at all. Sometimes, the page just hangs. You would have to be pretty desperate to want to use the browser!- e-mailI tried to e-mail an attachment a couple of times but had no success with it. 3.5 minutes (1 minute standard rate + 2.5 minutes e-mailing rate) were deducted from my account on _each_ attempt, even though the e-mail failed to get through! The error message: Sending failed: Connection error.o  Miscellaneous FeaturesThe phone has all the \"standard\" features that come with most cell phones: polyphonic ring tones, games (e.g. Need For Speed - Carbon), and tools (e.g. calculator and alarm clock).o  UsabilityService: The standby battery life is about 2 to 3 days. Cell phone reception from the Net10 service is decent enough (Net10 actually uses the AT&T; network). It comes with 300 minutes of free airtime (a 30-d0llar value).Volume Control: I really like the volume control buttons on the left side of the phone. You can quickly set the phone to Silent, Vibrate, or one of seven volume levels without having to wade through the menus.Form: The phone is very compact. It is the same size as the LG 300.---The biggest gripe I have about the phone is the crippled browser. Other than that, I don't really have very much else to complain about it. For me, an absolute must-have on a phone is bluetooth - and this feature works flawlessly on the EM 326g. Overall, I'm quite happy with it. For the price, it's really not a bad deal. If you're looking for a prepaid phone, this one's definitely worth consideration.", "Date": "October 8, 2009"}, {"Title": "This can be your only phone", "Author": "shariee in sac town \"music mania\"", "ReviewID": "R3BZ3LQZ0YBIVL", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I don't particularly agree that this should only be a \"back up\" phone. This is a fairly decent phone for the price and the fact you're not signing your life away on an expensive 2-year contract. I've had Net 10 for 3 years and this phone is my only phone. No land line, no other cell service; and I haven't had any major issues.  This is a great phone thou. I love the MP3 player; I've already got my 2GB mini SD card full. The playback is both easy to manage and has good sound. Plus it helps to listen to the MP3 player w/out having the earplugs attached. The radio is also pretty decent (do need the headphones for that since it acts as an antenna). The bluetooth function is handy, though not the greatest sound (could be my headset thou, to be honest). The only thing I do not like about this phone is the browser shortcut button is in a spot that most phones have the \"menu\" key so it's very easy to hit. This was definitely a Net10 gimmick; the browser w/Net 10 does suck and you can only go to their website- so it's not very good. I have been definitely considering going to Straight Talk which gives you a lot more minutes, more texts and web browser for about what I pay now with Net10 for 300 minutes. The only thing stopping me is I really like this phone; and have come really attached to it.02.05.2010 Revision: I have found a way to disable the Browser bottom, which I've hit more times than I can count. In the \"security\" section under menu, there is a way to lock certain applications. Once you punch in the phone's four digit security code (1234, by default) you can disable any function of the phone - use of the function will require the four digit code if you accidently hit it. :)", "Date": "January 16, 2010"}, {"Title": "Nice little phone", "Author": "John Van Walsum \"Frequent flyer extrodinaire\"", "ReviewID": "R2TGSBKMQHCIJ1", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I bought this phone to test out Net 10's local system.  The main reason is that I will be giving it to my 82 year old father to use as an emergency phone.  I have really enjoyed using it.  Here are my pros and cons.Pros:Small compact size that fits in a shirt or pants pocket.Really good reception, even in the middle of a department store.Easy to use interface with very adequate size dialing pad.Crisp and clear sound quality.Cons:Can't disable the browser access button.  Would like to swap it out for maybe the contacts access.  It's cost me 60 cents just because I hit Exit one too many times when backing out of the menu screen, which then activates the browser on the phone.  10 cents per minute... why would they let me change it out??? That would cost them revenue!One note here about Net 10.  They've got good coverage here in West Michigan, a very easy to understand low cost plan, albeit prepaid, but their South American customer service call center leaves a lot to be desired.  Customer service agents don't understand English, and are constantly entering key words into a computer and waiting for a canned answer to pop up on their screen.  It's a shame that a company that only operates in the US has to farm out all their customer service access to a foreign country.  Typical of what's happening all over the US.", "Date": "October 26, 2009"}, {"Title": "Recommended, with reservations...", "Author": "Gregory A. Henry \"atlantagreg\"", "ReviewID": "RZ67VNA0DQF6Z", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "The previous reviews have pretty much covered all of the main features on this phone so I won't repeat it all and just go over a few points for the plus and minus of this phone based on my experiences with it under the Net10 network:CAMERA:  For a pre-paid phone, the 1.3MP camera is actually pretty good, and has many features in it like white balance and exposure controls that you would normally not even find in many contract phones, much less a pre-paid model.  Using a memory card (or if your computer has it, bluetooth) will make transfering the photos convenient.  While this doesn't come close to comparing to a real digital camera (and has no flash), the pics are more than adequate enough for nice sized web pics and even \"decent\" 4x6 prints.  Just take the time to learn the camera adjustments to get the best out of your photos.TEXTING:  I don't like Motorola's predictive-type style of texting.  Not easy to figure out and there are delays.  I'm not a heavy texter so it's not an issue for me as much as others.  Using pre-type canned messages also involves too many steps and is not intuitive to use, either.  In other words, the Motorola menu system in general could be A LOT more intuitive, and it's not as user friendly as the LG300G (also from Net10).ANSWERING CALLS:  It would be nice if the microphone had been designed so you didn't have to slide the phone open to answer incoming calls.  You of course have to slide it open to make calls and dial/text, but with a few tweaks, it could have been made to handle incoming calls without having to slide it open.RECEPTION:  The old and cheap LG300G got multiple bars throughout my home in a suburb of Atlanta.  The Motorola's reception isn't nearly as good as the LG.  I've held the phones side-by-side in interior rooms and while the LG will get 4 bars, the Motorola will only get 1 bar, and in a couple of spots, none.  I never dropped a call with the LG - I have dropped a couple with the Motorola.  The LG's ear speaker did make callers sound a bit like you had a cloth in-between your ear and their voice (muffled), and while the Motorola is clearer, it has somewhat of a digital \"tinny\" noise to it that's to me, not very pleasant.  Using a good bluetooth headset will help.  My understanding is that Net10 piggybacks their signals on AT&T; *OR* Verizon, depending on the area, but may even use other services as well in other areas, so I'm not sure which one they use in mine, though Verizon gets excellent covereage in Atlanta.CUSTOMER SERVICE:  Now, with all of this being said, I HAVE to add, that the Net10 customer service is among the WORST I've ever experienced. You will on 100% of your calls be dealing with reps in India.  Reps who speak little English, and those who do, do so poorly and with heavy accents.  Many are under-trained and reading from scripts, and will give you inconstant information.  If you are switching or \"porting\" a phone number from an old phone of theirs or another phone via a different service, expect a long call with a series of codes and number to be given to the rep, then what can amount to an extremely long wait for it to be transferred, if, it works at all (prompting another call to try to get it fixed, etc etc etc).  If there is one thing that is almost worth the high price of contract carriers (AT&T;, Verizon, T-Mobile), it's that the customer service for them as much as we complain, is actually WORLDS better than from Tracfone/Net10.  So to sum up, these phones are great for certain uses as very basic and sometimes very reliable phones.  But if customer service is as important to you as the phone service price, avoid this service.If this is a secondary phone you're using for whatever reason (business, selling on ebay, etc) then I'd say I'd recommend it so long as you realize it does not compare to a good contract phone.  If you are the type of person who RARELY uses a cell phone but wants one to carry in case of an emergency, likewise, I'd say go ahead and get this one as well.  I would not though, recommend the Motorola as a full-time phone.  The slight reception and call quality issues would drive me nuts if I had to fully rely on this phone full time.  As a backup phone, I can deal with it.", "Date": "November 26, 2009"}, {"Title": "Bad Customer Service", "Author": "Wheeler", "ReviewID": "R3IB3496D5198", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "I haven't used the phone enough to really rate it.  My problem is with the Net10 customer service.  I have used Net10 for several years now but never had to deal with their customer service.  When I bought this phone I wanted to transfer my (home) wired phone number to the new phone and did so without problems.  I kept my old phone active until the time was about up expecting to be able to transfer my 3000+ minutes to the new phone as it said I could in the FAQ section on their web site.  I tried to do the transfer on the website but it didn't work.  I called customer service and navigated through their menu system and finally was able to talk to a customer service rep who spoke with an Indian accent.  After 15 or more minutes on the phone dealing with the language barrier and putting up with his voice cutting in and out I got so frustrated that I gave up!  I guess I will lose my 3000+ minutes.  They never called back to see if there was anything they could do.  Right now I am thinking of going back to AT&T; and taking a loss on my phone.", "Date": "January 29, 2010"}, {"Title": "Run, as far as you can", "Author": "Cellphone Guru \"OJ\"", "ReviewID": "R2CFX3A0B8G3TR", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "n my 50 years of adult life I made many calls to many customer services for many reasons. These include calls to Pan Am Airlines, to MCI Telecommunications, to Bernie Madoff Investment Services, to... well you got the picture...but I have never seen a customer service worse than Net10. If the inventers of the English language had ever dealt with Net10 customer service, they would have invented a word much stronger than the word \"worst\". Net10 gives a new meaning to words such as \"worst\", \"hate\", \"incompetence\", \"crooks\", among others. Even the simple action of transferring your Net10 number from a Net10 phone to another Net10 phone becomes so frustrating that at the end of days and countless but fruitless calls, and hours of waiting on hold, you feel like smashing your phone with a hammer and then driving your semi-truck over it back and forth several times and then throwing its pieces into a volcano and sending a nuclear missile with warhead to that volcano. I have been toying with the idea of buying billboard ads throughout the nation to warn people not to get Net10.

By Net10 standards it's a middle-of-the-range model, given that it has stuff like an MP3 player and FM radio, a voice recorder, a halfway decent 1.3MP camera (some are still stuck with 0.3MP), Bluetooth, and the ability to house a 2 GB (and only 2 GB) MicroSD memory card.  Voice quality is sharp, and the buttons and sliding action feel solid.  Also, unlike a lot of phones, this model follows the common standard for both its headphone jack (3.5mm) and charging port (MicroUSB).Drawbacks include somewhat unintuitive menu logic, lame ringtones, and negligent limitations like the lack of volume control for the alarm clock (which needs to be programmed in army time, by the way).  The Caller ID system displays numbers but not names (unless they're one of your contacts), and texting is pretty clumsy: I find myself backtracking and retyping more than on other phones, and Autocomplete keeps tripping me up.  Finally, when receiving a call, it takes 1-2 seconds after sliding the phone open for the other party to actually hear you.Still a fine phone, though.", "Date": "July 21, 2011"}, {"Title": "A low end Pay as You Go phone with features!", "Author": "Shad Corliss", "ReviewID": "RIB67XM8QWOVS", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I bought this phone because of the features. I had been a Tracfone user for a long time. Recently when I lost my Tracfone I found myself plunged into the new phone market. I started researching phones and PAG phone companies. I was looking for a phone with no monthly expense that would nurture the jealous geek in me. I have  a phone tech envy complex.This phone certainly has enough features to calm my inner phone jealous tech geek side. It is the only PAG phone out there with this extensive array of great features. But do the features work, and do I like them? 1.Camera; Yes, The camera takes good pictures. It has a great zoom feature. I would like to see a photo button. 2.Style;Yes, I like the slide-open feature, though I have used friends phones that delivered here in a much smoother action.User Friendly; At first the phone did not seem intuitively set up. I have to toggle through menus to get to the camera. Once I figured out how to use the features I use most frequently, I found I was satisfied. 3.Value for the money?; Yes, It is the only Net10, and or Tracfone with as many features that does not require the purchase of a monthly plane. A true PAG with features 4.Blue Tooth?; Don't know, I like the idea of it, but have yet to use it. 5.MP3 Player?;No, The phones MP3 player feature disappoints me. I have a very large collections of MP3 that I spent hours ripping from my families personal collection of CD's. The phone will not play any of them because it thinks they were pirated. I spent a lot of time trying to figure this problem out, and ended up very frustrated. When I decided to re-rip some of my favorite CD's I found most of them could not be re-ripped due to one time ripping licensing issues. The one cd I could re-rip, those songs played on my phone. This is very sad as I have no intention of building a new paid for mp3 library. So the MP3 feature is useless to me. This feature one of the the biggest reason I bought the phone. 6.Tech Support?; Great downloadable pdf manual. This manual was very useful while troubleshooting the mp3 player feature. 7.Web Access?; Don't know, Don't use it. It burns minutes. The phone has a silly web button that can be pushed when the phone is closed. I have to lock the keypad in order to avoid the phone accessing the web while in my pocket... 8.Wireless Connection?; Yes, I have never not had service. I am satisfied with it. 9.Email?;I don't know, I have not used it. Though I like the idea that I can 10.Portability?;No, It is lite and stows in the pocket comfortably. However I find that when the keypad is not locked that  the buttons on the front can be triggered, thus accessing expensive services that burn up minutes. Fortunately when this happens the phone beeps every few seconds. 11.Texting?;No, I strongly dislike the text feature of this phone. I used to use a TTY system on my old phone. It guessed what I was spelling. I only had to hit each key once. The EM326 phone uses an old school text input method. You have no choice but to hit each button multiple times until it delivers the character you want. Sometime the phone will guess what word I am going after and fill in the rest of the word. I am relieved when the phone guesses correctly. As a result of the non intuitive unfriendly texting feature I try to avoid texting like I would the plague. 12.FM radio?;Yes, Way cool feature that I really like 13.Lantern Feature?;Yes, I like this feature a lot. 14.Battery Life is very satisfying. It can go over week if not used often. About a day if used a lot.All and all I like this phone. I would like to like it a lot more but for the PAG'ers out there we finally have a very good option to have a phone that is a little more then just a phone. It is about time. Thank You Motorola!
