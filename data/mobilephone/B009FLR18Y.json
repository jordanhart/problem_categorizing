{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Good device", "Author": "Anatori Shisaks \"biblophile\"", "ReviewID": "RSAY553DT69XP", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I like the fact that with this device I have two phone lines from 2 different companies on the 1 machine. One disadvantage of this model is the small size of the keypad buttons. For persons with fat or non-slender fingers this can be a challenge as well as the fact that small keypad means that it is difficult for older persons to read.  Perhaps not the best device for those who wish to have all the bells and whistles. However for the price I think that this machine is very good and certainly worth getting for those who wish to have a modern device while not spending a fortune on telecommunication devices.", "Date": "February 16, 2013"}, {"Title": "For being duos I'm so happy and no comment", "Author": "Jose Pucuta", "ReviewID": "R1C6ZGQK6HGPKU", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "The most importance of my choice it's that it work on both network within my country.
