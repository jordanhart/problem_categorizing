{"Reviews": [{"Title": "All-in-ONE Smartphone", "Author": "Amazon Customer", "ReviewID": "RMDJTZFGI4V95", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I have been using HTC Thunderbolt since April 2011 and it is definitely THE King of Smartphones. I had a choice between Thunderbolt and iPhone and finally decided to purchase the Thunderbolt running on the Verizon 4GLTE network. Just a quick note here, Verizon's 4GLTE network is definitely super fast and data transfer, videos, music streaming is smooth with absolutely no buffering. Here are some of the Pros and Cons of HTC Thunderbolt PROS:1) Screen Size: 4.3 inch screen is neither too big nor too small and reading or making notes on the phone is quite easy without straining your eyes. Remember, you can zoom in and zoom out on any article and it auto fits itself to the screen. I find this feature very helpful (This is not possible on my Galaxy Tab, where if you zoom, you then have to scroll left, right, up and down to view the article). Screen size is also perfect for making video calls using Skype, Tango, Google Hangouts !!! 2)4G LTE: This was supposed to be the first phone capable of connecting to Verizon's 4G Long Term Evolution (LTE) network. There is no doubt that Thunderbolt and 4GLTE form a potent combination delivering high speed data transfer, fast streaming of movies and music without having to wait. I have actually watched some live sports events through websites and there is hardly a time when I would see \"Buffering\" during the video. This is, again, possible due to Verizon's network but Thunderbolt is the first phone to take advantage of LTE. 3) Camera: 8MP back camera and 1.3 MP front camera makes this a great smartphone to have. The camera quality is amazing and I have already taken thousands of photos through my phone.I have taken quite a few videos with the phone as well. It might not be the best when compared to a better CAMERA, but it is definitely one of the best among the current smartphones. iPhone didn't have a 8MP camera in April 2011. The front and back camera is a great feature to have especially during video calling. The picture clarity is amazing and I use Skype very often through HTC Thunderbolt. 4) Android Market: This is an ever growing area for Android phones with loads and loads of apps for almost anything that you need. Android team does their bit by even providing some good training materials for people who want to write code for Android apps. I have been using the following apps regularly; Facebook, Twitter, CNN, Mashable, Engadget, TOI, Entrepreneur, Foursquare, Viber, SKYPE, LinkedIn, Google + and many more. Android application development will surely provide one of biggest opportunities for programmers to make money as Android phones already have the highest market share and it keeps growing everyday!!! I would recommend the SwiftKey X keyboard for anyone with Android smartphone. This is probably the best Android Keyboard App in the market with Artificial Intelligence capabilities!! Just to round off with some more great features, HTC Thunderbolt is now running 2.3.4 Gingerbread OS. This is again up-gradable to Ice Cream Sandwich (Android 4.0). When I purchased this phone, it was running Android Froyo (2.2) version which was now upgraded to Gingerbread (2.3.4). The phone comes with 32GB, yes, 32GB SD card installed in addition to phone memory. That is a lot of storage space on a smartphone. Most of my apps are now stores on the SD card freeing up my phone memory. CONS:1) Battery: There has been a vast improvement in the battery through the OS upgrades but still connecting through 4G LTE network does consume a lot of battery. If you are going to be connected to 4G all the time, I am sure you'd have to charge your phone at least twice a day. Ice Cream Sandwich OS upgrade might improve the power management capabilities, but currently it is surely a concern.2)SD Card slot: Most of the Thunderbolt owners have a hard time opening the phone to remove the SD card. There is no real need to remove the card but if someone really wants to transfer information from the card without using the wires, it'll take you some time to get the card out.3) Heavy: Thunderbolt is slightly heavier than iPhone and Samsung Galaxy S II but I don't think it's a big issue personally !! From my point of view, I will definitely recommend this phone. The price has reduced considerably and unless you want Galaxy Nexus or Galaxy S II or Galaxy S III, there is no other competing phone with so many features along with the ease of usability !!", "Date": "June 25, 2012"}, {"Title": "A very powerful 1st gen 4G phone", "Author": "Rocman", "ReviewID": "R2YO65Y2O9EN1N", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I have been using my HTC Thunderbolt for about a year now, and I have found it to be a very powerful phone with flaws that are inherent to a 1st gen product (with regard to 4G LTE).Pro:Screen size AND aspect ratio - the 4.3\" screen was big when this phone came out one year ago in July '11.  At the time, I thought this was going to be the physical limit on smartphone screen sizes - boy was I wrong haha  The resolution is 800x480, which is low by today's standard, but this was the highest resolution available on the android side at the time of this phone's launch.  One thing I've come to love is the screen's aspect ratio.  This phone has very thin bezels framing the screen.  I simply love this.  Compared to the a same size 4.3\" 720P phone (ex. Rezound), the Thunderbolt's screen is noticeably wider and negligibly shorter.  This makes for a much more useful screen in everyday use, such as Google map, browsing, etc.  The Rezound's 720P screen, which by the way is gorgeous and has even higher pixel density than the \"retina display\" on the iphone 4s, shows you less content except with movies and videos, where its 16:9 ratio minimizes black bars.  Honestly though, I don't watch much video on my phone, and I prefer to see more in things like Google map versus less black bar while watching video.4G LTE - this was the first 4G phone for Verizon, and it was a SCREAMER.  When I first got the phone last summer, Verizon was just rolling out its 4G network.  Here in NC, I was getting anywhere from 25 to 50 Mbps download and 8 to 15+ Mbps upload (verified by the Speedtest ookla app).  The download speed has tapered off a bit now, no doubt due to the fact that now most people are on 4G.  But still, it's pretty incredible that my phone's connection is comparable to my Road Runner Turbo (20/2 here in NC) at home!  The upload speed is actually much, much faster than my RR turbo.Using internet/data while on a call - this phone is actually able to do simultaneous data and call over BOTH 3G and 4G!  I could not believe Verizon did not advertise this out the wazoo, because at the time of launch, AT&T; was making an ad attack on Verizon saying Verizon's network could not handle using internet while on a call.  This was true, except for the Thunderbolt!  I've personally verified this on both 3G and 4G.  I was able to access apps, check emails and in general use data while on a call without any problem.  I didn't thought this would be a big deal until I had to look up directions on google map while during a call.  Very useful feature.Kickstand - this might be a love-it-or-hate-it thing, but I've found the kickstand on this phone to be VERY useful.  It's elegantly designed and very robustly built.  The hinge has a solid and satisfying spring assisted snap to it.  You can prop up the phone both portrait and landscape.  For one thing, this makes the phone a super alarm clock for me without the need for a dock.  I am a minimalist by nature and I love it!Call quality - believe it or not, I still make calls with my phone - sometimes :)  The sound quality for both incoming and outgoing is great.  And as much as I hate Verizon's more expensive plans, they do have a very decent network which no doubt contributes to this phone's great call quality.Good build quality - I've dropped this phone once or twice without a case and it's survived gracefully.  There are scratches of course, but I am very impressed.  Overall there are no creaks or otherwise cheap feel to this phone.  Very impressive since it's not built on an uni-body construction.Cons:Battery life - this has to be the biggest drawback for this phone.  Being a first generation 4G phone, this phone used a discrete 4G modem chip that was power hungry.  Combine that with a woefully small OEM battery (only 1400 mah), and you have very bad battery life performance.  It's like outfitting a Corvette with a two gallon capacity fuel tank.  You can go really fast but you will be out of juice very soon, too.Over the past year, I've been able to coax a useful almost-one-day battery life out of this phone by a) forcing it to 3G and b) rooting it to get rid of the Verizon bloatware.  There is also the extended battery, which doubles the battery capacity (2750 mah) but adds a bump and more weight to an already bulky phone.  Recently, I bought a Rezound OEM battery, which fits this phone with the standard battery cover.  The difference was very noticeable!  That battery should have shipped with the Thunderbolt.  I would definitely recommend getting a Rezound battery (I bought from Amazon for $12) for this phone.Bulk - this phone is not wafer thin nor feathery light.  The weight I actually don't mind - it feels like the premium product.  I wish the phone could be thinner, though.  What really makes the size a bit frustrating is the fact that with this bulk, HTC could have fitted a much larger battery inside, thus alleviating the battery life issue.Speakerphone position - the speaker on this phone is hidden behind the kickstand when it's flush against the phone.  Therefore, the sound is a little bit muffled, unless you open the kickstand.  Not a big deal really, as it is still plenty loud.Data connectivity - this phone had some teething problems with the initial software (froyo).  After the upgrade to Gingerbread (android 2.3), this phone was much, MUCH better and stable.  Of course, mine is rooted so... ;)[Update March 1st, 2013]FYI - Verizon released the Android 4.0 (ice cream sandwich or ICS) for the Thunderbolt! Finally, after nearly a year of delay.", "Date": "July 22, 2012"}, {"Title": "as described. great product.", "Author": "gerald", "ReviewID": "R3IO1QDL8BHRCX", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "product as described. great. good replacement for my broken phone. A lot more cheaper than the phones on sale/refurbished on actual verizon stores.", "Date": "December 21, 2011"}, {"Title": "A word to the wise..", "Author": "jj", "ReviewID": "R3KB772Q9LUXB1", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "As a broke college student I really feel compelled to write a review about this phone in particular (not the seller); I purchased the HTC thunderbolt at a Verizon store in Madison and initially, it was love at first sight. My brother had raved about it to me and sure enough, when I arrived in the store, it did not disappoint. The phone was sturdy and I actually initially preferred it to my iphone. This is what makes the HTC thunderbolt an even more disappointing experience; at it's core, it is truly a phenomenal phone. However, in time I began to have issues. The most glaring problem is the sheer and utter lack of battery life. I have always charged my phone overnight yet in the morning when I would take it to class the phone's battery life would begin to dissipate at an alarmingly fast rate.This is not the result of careless misuse of the phone; upon purchase I immediately got a case and protective screen cover, handling my device with the upmost case due to it's steep price.  At first, a whole night's worth of charging would only get me about two hours of use. Now, after a mere year in my possession, the moment I take it off my charger it tells me the battery is almost dead. And the worst part is, when I make a phone call, if I am not connected to the charger the thunderbolt will immediately close out the call and turn off. Just like that. so now I have to carry a charger with me at all times to maintain some semblance of functionality. As a matter off fact, what prompted me to write this review is that the phone closed out on me while charging just now. My experience made me question myself; I reasoned that there was no way people were shelling out this kind of money to receive such subpar results-I must have been given a defunct phone. But just today I spoke with a friend of me who went into a frustrated tirade about a phone she'd just purchased that kept shutting down on her while she was in the middle of a call. Sure enough, it was an HTC thunderbolt. There is no excuse for a phone of this price to deliver such mediocre results. Absolutely none. I have purchased an extended battery for mine but am counting the days till my upgrade so I can purchase another device. I guess the thing that really irks me is that if the company would take some time to fix these few glitches this would have been a five star experience, not a groan inducing annoyance. For all those looking into a new phone, please take your money elsewhere. If you're going to invest this kind of money for a phone, you deserve one of outstanding quality-the HTC thunderbolt does not fit the bill.", "Date": "April 7, 2013"}, {"Title": "Great Phone/Great Service", "Author": "javi", "ReviewID": "R3F3PM83XVOZDL", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Received this phone way before the due date.

The only good thing about this phone is its profile.  In my opinion the dimensions of this phone are perfect.  When I first purchased it, it was running gingerbread software.  I had to replace it three times after only 3 months of use.  Each time I received the replacement something else was wrong with it.  I've had it about 18 months and to me HTC makes the Glitchiest phones.  It pretty much eats power and in order to run the ICS Android software you essentially need to jury rig the phone.I'm convinced that HTC does not give a damn about the customer experience.  Very poor quality and reliabilty.  I would never purchase another HTC phone.  Some of the issues that I have had with it:  Shuts off by itself, poor battery life, major touch screen lag, duplicates contacts, navigation would not work, voice dialer has never worked, does not hypenate phone numbers, slow.Bottom line, don't get this phone.

It is the worst! I've had it for a year and I am considering buying a different smartphone at full price ($600) because I won't be able to get an upgrade for another year.Main Problems:Horrible battery life: you absolutely need to get the extended battery. The stock battery lasts about 4 hours with little use, and about 2 hours if you use the internet or gps. I charged my stock battery three times a day.Poor reception: this phone seems to drop calls like a cell phone from 1998.Crappy/buggy operating system. The phone often freezes. It sometimes shuts down without warning. I have upgraded it consistently, which has improved these issues, but not much. The operating system just sucks. Its hard to find what you want and you cannot customize it very much.Copy/Paste problems. The copy function, which would be useful to copy numbers and addresses is very difficult to use. You have to double-tap in a very small area and you can sometimes expand it, sometimes not.Poor autocorrect - for some reason, the autocorrect seems to always choose uncommon words and fails to have many basic words. It also doesn't give you many options.Wireless connectivity: don't use the Wifi: it comes off and on randomly (it likes to switch networks without your permission, even if you use a password to connect to a specific network). It can't switch to 4G easily once you are out of range of a wireless network while having wifi on. You have to manually turn off wifi. This sounds simple, but it gets so annoying.Verizon proprietary software: Verizon always wants you to use its navigation and other software. It is annoying to open up navigation, find your destination and have the phone ask if you want to use free GoogleMaps or pay for VZ navigator. I have selected GoogleMaps as the \"Default Action\" for navigation, but this feature does not actually work and it keeps asking me.The back cover fell off very easily after about 3 months (but the extended battery which you basically need to buy gives you a new back).Good things: LTE is very fast. Unfortunately, the poor battery life and horrible operating system don't make LTE very usable.I would never buy this phone for anyone. I felt like my iPhone 3g was much more usable, even though it wasn't 4G. My friends have newer iPhones and Droids (such as the RAZR MAXX) and I far prefer those phones.

I've lost important business calls!  It is totally unacceptable for a new phone to be so faulty.  I did not save my receipt or the box-- I assumed purchasing it from Amazon there'd be no problems.

I expedited shipping and paid the extra to get my phone in one day. Amazons service was great and my phone arrived in one day.The problem was that the vendor whom I purchased from JIVAGO lied and delivered a false product. They sold it as a new phone. This phone was obviously not new. I could tell just by the package the phone came in. Yes, it was a Verizon box with a seal... But one of those seals that was replaced. Inside the box came the thunderbolt phone by Verizon, a battery and a phone charger not original to the actual phone, just a crappy one made in China type. And the SD card was not included. Also the box did not include the user manual. So I decided since I was desperate for a phone, to put the battery in and charge it to see how it worked. Well the battery also did not look like an original and there was a sticker inside the phone with a 2013 date.. The obviously being a phone made in 2011 seemed now like it was obviously a used and refurbished phone being resold on Amazon as a New phone as stated by the vendor. I was livid beacuse it makes my question more and more the credibility of Amazon and how they screen vendors and evaluate products.Well... To top it all off... The phone never did charge and cannot be turned on. So all in all I am left yet again with another phone that doesn't work.

Now let me break it down in yearsYear One:The phone was fast, the pictures where perfect and the only complaint was battery life. then I bought an extended battery for $20 bucks and I was able to use my phone for 2 straight days with no problem. I would have had this thing implanted in my arm it was so good.Year two:same as year one, never bought a screen protector and the screen never got a scratch. I did buy a protective cover because I noticed that the color rubbed off very easily, especially on hot sweaty days. Not a problem but who wants a ratty looking phone. I started noticing problems that I heard other owners complain about, which was that it would hang up or start making a call in the middle of a conversation when you held the phone up to your ear while using it on a call. I mainly used my phone with a bluetooth headset or through my car radio so I thought it would not matter, but for those few calls I did take or make using the handset it was unbearable. I would be talking on an important call and suddenly it would be put on hold and I would be talking to my voicemail, by the time you figure out what's going on the person on the original call has hung up! When the phone wasnt switching calls it would be trying to do stuff, I would finish a call and see that I accidentally opened all these different apps. that was anoying to say the least.Then came Android 4.0 at the end of year two, I had been waiting for it with great anticipation. ANDROID 4.0 DESTROYED THE PHONE! REPEAT, DESTROYED THE PHONE! It looked cool at first but by now I was at the end of my contract and I noticed that the phone was getting slower and slower. Then the power button stopped working, so I couldnt cut the phone off or on, I could not wake the phone when it went to sleep either. So I downloaded a app called just flip (free) and it solved that problem, but by then the phone was creeping so slow it was practically unusable, it started making errors like crazy. I would try to make a call and it would dial two numbers at the same time, one that I dialed and one that it dialed, and guess what? my call was always the one to go on hold.Year 3:Contract ended in the first week of July, can this thing last long enough for the next big gee whiz gizmo to come out?Been using just flip to wake my phone, but it needs to be recalibrated every week and a half or it gets unresponsive. I have to do a factory reset every other week in order to keep the phone up to speed, I dont know what is slowing it down. I no longer dowload apps, one because i know I'm gonna reset the phone again and the other because I'm trying to get a little extra mileage out of the phone before I have to reset it agian. Finnally because I dont know what could be slowing this thing down. I have tried app killers to no avail, I have cleared all shortcuts from the screen, I cut off GPS, bluetooth and mobile network, I even turn the brightness down as low as possible, nothing seems to help.This is why I rated the phone a one star, at this point you cant reverse the last update and so far they havent corrected any issues through updates. I am ready for a new phone but I was trying hold out till fall when the Samsung Galaxy Note 3 comes out, but I dont think I can hold out that long so I just cross my fingers and maybe the note 2 will price drop by September and I'll grab it. When I bought the T-bolt at full price the dang thing dropped to 49.00 a month later so I was trying to avoid having that happed again.The T-bolt was a great phone worthy of 5 stars, but not anymore. I cant say I babied my phone but I never droppedit either. I realy dont use the phone to make a lot of calls, I mostly text and read news so the call situation wasnt a problem. If you make a lot of calls it could be an issue for you. but the slowing of the phone since the 4.0 update is the real deal breaker.", "Date": "August 2, 2013"}, {"Title": "great job!", "Author": "Subhash", "ReviewID": "R21X2A8M882DBG", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "What an amazing phone.

The hotspot on my phone works better than my son's Motorola Maxx , my daughters Samsung Galaxy 5 and my household internet .The only serious drawbacks about the Thunderbolt is the placement of the built-in stand and charging port, they interfere with each other.

Still even after i did that and added a cleaning to the phone it is still a major lag fest.the phone has great battery life. I am a normal 20 year old and this phone can last; as long as you are not listening to music and keep it clean. the longest i have had the phone last was 2 days with out being on the charger (with no extended battery). and lasts for about 12 hours if used like a normal teen would, as long as kept clean. otherwise the battery will last for about 8 hrs and 5 if listening to music from the time you turn it on until completely dead.i give this phone a 3/5 because it is a great phone but needs a lot of attention to keep it running well. I would rate this phone much higher if there was little to no lag. Since i ordered it brand new i see no reason for this.

I ran a diagnostic on the os, factory reset my device tried everything I knew in attempts to fix the problem resulting in absolutely no luck. So I began examining the device itself,  this is when I finally uncovered the issue, the battery itself was bad, swollen up to near the point of exploding, well this discovery was of course a bit disheartening seeing as how I made the purchase of a cellular phone for use of it in all of its amenities not a phone that kept me stationary.... though this was a major annoying inconvenience I already had all intentions of upgrading to an extended life battery,  I just budgeted it in sooner than I had planned, but as soon as the new battery went into use it performs exquisitely.... never shy away from used or refurbished products if you are looking to purchase items which are affordable for you in no other way just dont expect perfection every time and dont get too disappointed if it is not in perfect condition usually the problems are easily rectified.

HTC had problems with there phones. the first one I tryed EVO 4G (Sprint) the worst celluar phone service provider. over heated and bad back light. many time the screen look peach not white. then I tryed this  Thunderbolt 4G LTE well it looks like a good phone. the weight dose not feel cheap. it feels like I am holding a phone. the case dose not feel cheap like the Galaxy phones. however as long as the Wi-FI design dose not work. I cannot use the phone. No app store download, No youtube. No nothing on the internet using Wi-FI and if you think that is another problem oh yes there isplaying video files aka AVI video filesI taken out my 32 GB micro SD out of my Acer Tablet. all the video files work fine on Acer Tablet. then I used the same mico SD on the Thunderbolt 4G LTE  I have files that do not work. why? whats wrong? Dose not tell me what is wrong and what to do about it. its like dealing with Windows Vista. whats with the bugs? why the files are bad when its not? Dose not tell me what to do about it.I have no clue how to fix it.HTC have the worst customer service. what ever you do never call HTC tech support. all there want is the contract on the phone. if you like me for example refuse to do a contract. why do a 2 year contract on a phone that Wi-Fi Dose not work. and cannot update he firmware. why do a 2 year contract with verizion on a phone that HTC dose not have tech support and the worst customer service? the other worst cosutmer service belongs to Motorola and Apple Computers and Sam Sung. when ever something is broken due to manifactor defective. all they do is sell a new one why pay for the same thing twice when it dose not work? any way I am trying to get a exchange or a refund. my question is is this phone worth a 2nd attempt ? or play it safe ask for a refund?There anther queatrion all power supplys have the usb cable to it. why the cheap generic no usb cable power supply that was not supplyed with the HTC? why the Generic Power supply?then the manual thats on the disc? that is missing?this is not a brand new phone its a phone that was sold once then its defevtive then tryed to fix it  and HTC did not do there job. then re-sell it to a dealer as brand new. well why the no HTC brand name power supply? why the no usb cable for the power supply? why is the phone broken out of the box? why dose retail box that comes with it looks like its been open then taped back together. when I noted this I had a gut feeling this is not going to work and I was right. now I have to worry about sending it back.", "Date": "November 27, 2013"}, {"Title": "not what I thought", "Author": "So cali girl", "ReviewID": "R2O6XA9R76HE82", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "Was ok, started to freeze up on me and wasn't hiding its battery.

It is in fact my backup phone should something happen to my HTC Droid DNA within the next 17 months.  I still use it as a wake up alarm clock and bring it out when the kids deserve some App time.When this phone came out, it was fast, but compared to today's 4 core phones, it seems very slow now, but in 2011, it seemed fast.- Update 2/10/2013 - Verizon finally rolled out the ICS (Ice Cream Sandwich) update and I have just updated my Thunderbolt to Android 4.0.4 HTC Sense 3.6.  Since I had already replaced this with a HTC Droid DNA as my primary phone, I had to borrow for an hour my wife's HTC Thunderbolt's SIM card and I had no problem getting the update and it installed without a hitch.  It is working well and I would highly recommend the update, there are a lot of nice things that come with going from Android 2.3 to Android 4.0.  In particular, I like being able to create folders now.  Since my Thunderbolt is now an alarm clock / backup-phone-in-case-I-break-my-DNA / Kid's Game machine for the foreseeable future, I wanted it to be as up to date as possible while the update was available.- Update 7/17/2012 - I still like my phone very much and have no regrets at all in buying it. It has been easy to buy accessories and it is one of the first phones to get updates and such.- Update 10/20/2011 - after 5 months I still have no regrets.  I still like my phone and I am especially happy to have been able to get grandfathered into the unlimited rate plans while they lasted (rather than waiting for a dual core phone) as I often go over 10GB per month.>- Update: I have had this phone since 5/11/2011. If you are buying the phone NOW, you are looking for a cheap LTE phone and this HTC Thunderbolt should fit the bill nicely.- Original Review (modified):Some of difference between this phone and others that I would bring to your attention would be:- The HTC Sense browsers word wraps when you pinch zoom into a web page and I love this feature.  Few other phones do this.- The TB has 8GB of onboard memory and 70% of that memory is not available for you to use.  This may seem irrelevant with the 32GB SD card that came with it, however many apps will not let you move them to an SD Card- The Thunderbolt feels sturdy and very professional.  I have dropped it numerous times and it has had no ill effect that I can tell.- There is no HDMI port, however this phone does not quite have enough oomph to be a huge video driver anyway.- I REALLY like TB's FastBoot (I turn it \"off\" every night -- I suspect 1GB of the unavailable memory is used for this feature, tho ideally it would be called suspend so you can still have a true \"off\" at the same time)- Hulu and Netflix and Skype all work well (all of which work much better with LTE)- The after-market has favored the HTC Thunderbolt.- There are a TON of reviews on this phone. Most are either 1 star or 4 star. If you remove the battery issue from the equation, the vast majority of people love it.- Yes, they SHOULD have given it a bigger battery, but to keep up with the trend of \"thin is in\", they didn't.  It is a great deal thinner than my Tilt2. So... moving on...- If you are getting horrible better battery life, my main recommendation would be keep the LTE radio off until you need to use it and turn it off again when you are done.  Here in Chicago, there are enough LTE towers that my phone does not drain too much battery life hunting for a signal.  I can easily go 10+ hours on the built in battery.  I routinely get well over 48 hours with the 2,750 mah battery with the 4G/LTE radio on the entire time.- That big and bright screen (for 1/1/2011) devours batteries and with unlimited 4G service and a fast 1GHz processor, you will have it on 3 times as much as you ever thought you would. It is that enjoyable to use. Perhaps this is the source for many of the complaints.  I know we have our screens on far, far longer than we ever had before.- Unlike my mother's HTC phone or my sisters iPhone, I have never once had an issue with my cheek hanging up on people or putting them on hold while I talk (and neither has my wife).  The phone really can tell when you are holding it against your face and turns the screen off as appropriate and turns it back again as soon as you take it away.- More battery tips: I try to always back out of programs until I get to the home screen to make sure they are not running in the background when I turn it off.  I never bother killing an app. Every time our battery seems to not last very long, it is fully attributable to keeping the screen on for extended periods, usually for extended internet browsing or facebooking.  In those instances, I just expect to plug it in soon, as I have with every notebook computer I have ever owned.  Everywhere we turn, we have an option to plug it in, so no big deal.- I can stream 3 straight hours of video over LTE on battery power on my 2,750 battery and still be only down 2 bars (20%).- I normally want a backup battery anyway, so I got an extended battery.  I actually like the extra heft and ridge to hold it. I have fewer worries about battery life than any of my previous 3 smartphones.- Unlimited LTE exposes a wide host of options I never before considered, like streaming Pandora or Hulu while at my desk at the office without going thru the firm's firewall (since it is against stated policy to do so).  This would be an occasion where I would just keep it plugged in.- Before ordering a new phone, I call the phone company to get the unlock code of my previous phone before deactivating it so I can use a SIM card from another country on that phone.  They will generally have no problem doing this when it is out of contract.Regarding getting the phone from AmazonWireless:------------------------------------------------Wow, what a price. 130 plus activation fees (which my corporate account allowed me to avoid) vs 250 from vzw.If you want more control over sorting/filtering the reviews, go to Amazon.com to read these same reviews (instead of wireless.amazon.com)I ordered the phone late at night on the 9th and received it bright and early on the 11th from KY (the delivery estimate was for the 12th).Regarding VerizonWireless initialization:----------------------------------------------I did not turned the phones on (I let VZW do this), but I did charge them up for an hour before heading off to the local VZW store for activation (as AmazonWireless does not do corporate discounts nor phone number rollovers for new family accounts)I arrived without a employment photo id (do not have one) nor a amount-redacted paycheck stub, so I was sent back home to get one as they do not discuss corporate discounts without such proof.I also needed to bring the AT&T; account number (which I got by calling 611, but bringing the invoice would have been faster).I also should have printed that email that AmazonWireless sent with the phone numbers as it would have speeded up the process.VZW first activated the phone numbers that arrived with the phones and then ported over our AT&T; #s and about 1 hour later the AT&T; phones were disconnected and the new phones were ready to use with our old #s. (very fast)If you order more than one phone... keep everything separate! I threw everything into one bag and they spend a good 10 minutes looking up their records to figure out which 4G card went with which phone. I still suspect it did not matter, but they wanted to be on the safe side.If you arrive with your old phones and your google account information handy, they were happy to assist you in setting it up and transferring the data over (I did not, so I did it myself)I receive a Welcome to VZW text next day with links to walk me thru setting it up (I have not yet used this, but I have kept it as it seems it may be useful)I have found thru my own experience and a good amount of googling, that the cheaper data plan is fine if you are using Corporate Microsoft Exchange email with ActiveSync. I am not sure why they have two plans and neither did the folks at the Verizon Wireless store.Regarding the phone itself:--------------------------------To use the speakerphone, there is an option to just put it face down on a flat surface.I almost wish it had a stylus. I clicked the wrong item far too often, but I am getting much better at it.It feels very solid and pleasant to hold and has already survived two 4' falls onto concrete.  get a screen protector ASAP!  I didn't and it is now badly scratched, but the Zagg screen protector made these scratches invisible.)As a phone, it does not have the best voice quality by any means, but it is usable and loud enough. It sounds much like our computer sounding VOIP system at work rather than a traditional voice line (it SEEMS to be doing VOIP over 4G, in which case it would affect most 4G phones. The same quality was mentioned in a review of the Charge). I was in upper Door County last weekend where there is no 3G signal and sure enough, voices sounded human again.I was surprised to find that headphones must be unplugged when receiving a phone call, otherwise the mic does not work. You need an adaptor with a mic that allows for quality headphones to listen to music. I just unplug the headphones.I use it for listening to music with headphones A LOT. (Pandora or FM Radio)The camera is okay, but not nearly as good as I was hoping, however the software to control it has a lot of cool options for a cell phone.A lot of gripe has been made about the position of the usb port and I agree it probably should have been place on the other side of the phone so you can view it on the kickstand sideways while plugged in.The designers likely put it there for the HTC Desktop Docking Station for HTC Thunderbolt Docking station  Charges HTC Thunderbolt with standard or extended battery on device  Charges Spare Standard or Extended Battery  Angled for better viewingHOWEVER!!! Since I have the Seidio extended battery, I use Seidio's case for this phone which that has a kickstand built into it that allows you to view it from either side (usb side up) and they also sell a desktop docking station in which you do not have to remove this case. Seidio ACTIVE Case for HTC 2750mAh and Seidio Innocell Extended Life Batteries for HTC ThunderBolt - 1 Pack - Retail Packaging - Black  and Seidio BD3-CRDHTMEC Desktop Cradle Kit for HTC ThunderBolt - Cradle - Retail Packaging - Black (tho the BD2 alternative is 10 bucks cheaper by not including a travel charger).As not all apps rotate to allow you to have the USB port up, the docking station was a good buy for me and allows the volume buttons to be on the top and easily accessible.A lot of gripe has been made about the lack of an HDMI out. Know that there is a Media Link Adaptor coming soon that will allow you to view on HDMI via DLNA (tho it costs WAY too much money... but wireless does make more sense). Personally, I do not see the point. I already have a HTPC setup, so I have a much better method to stream video to my HDMI TV.I had to buy adaptors and cables for the multiple locations we charge (home/work/car). BlackBerry USB Cable Micro USB 1.0m (Black) Amzer Handy Converter Mini USB Connector to Micro USBI have no problems with WiFi or USB tethering. LTE is faster than my home DSL connection.PDANet would not work without first installing HTCSync (and then uninstalling it... it leaves behind the drivers you want... there are three different uninstall icons), but once installed, I was getting 7Mbps down and 1.7Mbps up via usb modem on my notebook according to DSL Reports (my at&t; dsl line maxes out at 2.6 Mbps down and 0.7 Mbps up).I have had no problems at all with it getting too hot.All my smartphones have been built by HTC and I have been content with their quality and they have been reasonably on top of their software updates.I experience no hiss at all listening to Pandora with my AKG K 272 HD High-Definition Headphones at any volume and I listen to it every workday and have a good ear (or so I like to think as a former musician).The Mount as Disk Drive option also seems to require HTCSync to be installed (see comments for link).  Again, you may uninstall HTCSync after it installed the underlying drivers you need.It is much closer of an experience to using a computer rather than a phone.  It certainly is faster and has a higher resolution screen than my first 4 computers, each of which cost thousands of dollars.  The AmazonApps store is addicting with its free app of the day and its abilty to browse the internet and see exactly the same website as on my desktop with just the same speed is abolutely amazing.  My \"7.2Mbps\" AT&T; Tilt2 had the ability (sans flash) but was so slow as to make it a waste of my time.Regarding Apps:--------------------As a new Andriod user, it took me days to figure out that you can swipe down the top bar and click on an app running in the background and be right back where you left off.  Too bad you cannot actually close apps from here tho.The video recording volume IS too low, but acceptable for my needs and there may be a software fix coming in the future.I use Swype, however I really like the HTC on-screen keyboard. A big reason for wanting a huge power draining screen was to have a surface large enough for my big fingers to hit the correct keys. I always had a physical keyboard before, and I was very reluctant to lose it. I still wish I could see the entire screen while typing, but it is not as bad as I had feared.Swype however still does not automatically include spaces in text messages (tho it does everywhere else) and it is still a bit of a pain to get it to work as expected when just typing letters.  It took a while to figure out that the back hardware button was used by Swype to hide the keyboard.Roboform is working quite nicely on it. It behaves like it is an entirely different internet browser. I tend to start at the Roboform list when I want to browse to a password protected website or a site I know I bookmarked within Roboform.I really like the HTC Sense UI. I am seeing no downside at all so far, but then again, I am not using it for email or contacts or facebook or tasks, I am using Touchdown to sync with my office's Exhange server. My wife uses Facebook every day, but uses the htc web browser not the HTC Facebook App.It is nice having at multiple AppStores to choose from: (VZW, AmazonApps, KindleBooks, and MarketAndroid) Interestingly enough, AmazonApps allows more than one phone on one account.Regarding Verizon's pre-loaded apps. Personally I think the issue is widely overblown. They seem to do little harm and do not consume any measurable amount of battery power.The wording on the Settings/Power/Fast Boot options is a bit confusing. You want to check the box to get fast boot. It defaults to NOT checked for broadest app compatibility. When FastBoot is enabled, the TB just hibernates instead of truly turning all the way off so it will turn on again and be usable in 10 seconds (tho reacquiring the signal take a bit longer).

As a 4G LTE phone, everything a phone is supposed to do on a great network (verizon), it does beautifully.  Of course, other phones have come and gone, have tried to improve on the God Father of Droid's and 4G.  Some have succeeded, others have failed and yet, nearly three years later, I am still very happy to have kept this phone--despite my irritation with minimal battery life.  The Droid operating system could stand to be upgraded from the 2.0 in it now, but honestly it is very functional.  The voice activation software works AWESOME.  Compared to Siri, which is plain awful (my wife has the iPhone and complains about it constantly), there simply isn't a comparison because mine works and Siri simply doesn't. Floyd Calhoun suggests if you purchase this phone, you upgrade to an extended life battery (a 3500mAh, Lithium ion is the answer).  It will change the phone from it's sleek, sexy, smooth style to a sleek, sexy, smooth HumpBack from Notre Dame phone, but... it is still very easy to hold, the incredibly cool kickstand that is built in still works perfectly, and with the new battery, I experience as much as hours and hours of FULL brightness, video streaming.  No kidding;  the extended life battery allows this older phone that started the LTE revolution to compete head to head with the Razr Maxx!  My only complaint is that it does not have an HDMI out, but very few of the new phones still do not offer this feature.  You will not be disappointed by this phone IF you have the exended batteries.

However, the network connectivity (4G, 3G, 1x) has been a major point of frustration particularly in the past 3-4 months. It randomly but frequently (everyday) will drop all network connections and you will either have to go to the Settings and turn it off and back on or use a widget for ease in that regard. That might not even work. You may actually have to reboot the stupid thing in order to get the network to work and that takes my phone about 5 minutes or longer. It takes longer to reboot this phone than it took Moses to find the Promised Land. This all could be because the phone is refurbished or needs a hard reset which I intend to do soon.

CHEAP SOFTWARE KNOCK OFF!!!I chose one star because the product was not \"new\" as described by the glowing \"NEW\" sign on the post. There is a difference between new /new condition/refurbished, being that \"new condition\" or \"refurbished\" still means its USED. when i got the phone it came in a cheap box with cheap chargers and a cheap usb cable. not to mention that the screen was loose. But wait! Therese More! when i turned it on it turns out that the phone wasn't even real. its a high quality knock off. I recognized one of the app icons and its an app that allows the phone interface to function as an android. I ddint even need to see that to know it was fake, the moment you turn it on it looks pixelated and fake, and looks nothing like the interface of an Android HTC should!!!!

Had it for almost 2 years", "Author": "eric", "ReviewID": "RJWKKNOZ6MKKT", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Great phone. Amazing features, screen quality, size, and durability (had it over 1.5 years and it's really handled the beating I've given it well). It also seems to handle moisture and impacts well. This is purely cosmetic, but the clear coat on the kickstand WILL all come off, and it looks bad. If this bothers you... well I'm sorry, you'll have to deal.I am an avid android developer and I love this thing. It's the first smart phone I've ever had and it got me into them big time. This phone's battery life improves greatly with a solid undervolted kernel. I feel like the battery life qualms with this phone are almost completely as a result of the software and not hardware. I am not sure of this as I only had the phone for a couple weeks before rooting, upgrading the radio software and designing my own kernel. My battery life is fine, at least a whole day and the next night.As far as a blank, open device for use with custom software, it doesn't get much better than this phone, and there is almost nothing of any real value that newer devices can bring to the table that this phone can't already accomplish with a little research on part of its owner. If only it had MHL or a HDMI port, it could duke it out with the best smart phones of today. Cyanogenmod ROMs work great on this phone, and the interface is sleek, snappy, and very modern.It is a bit heavy which leads me to believe that if you drop it frequently, you might have trouble after a couple of years or so. It also might interfere with car mounts due to its weight. Even with everything tweaked, the battery life is barely 17 hours with light - medium usage in an area with light cell signal. The camera is great outdoors. This is slightly diminished indoors and it's quite poor and grainy in low light. The front facing camera is useless, unfortunately, even in good light. It came with a 32G flash drive when I bought it which is amazing! I like that it supports free wifi tethering and AVRCP too, plus tends to handle medium-high resolution vids well. It will NOT play 1080P video smoothly, no matter what you do. It works well for gaming and the touch screen is as responsive as you'd expect. It also multitasks well. I have had navi shouting commands through BT, music streaming, wifi tethering active with 2 laptops connected, and somebody playing temple run on this phone all simultaneously. It did get kind of hot though doing all of this, but not alarmingly so, and battery lasted for almost 3 hours under these conditions.All in all, I love this phone, and when the time comes, I'll be going with another HTC device and likely pimping it out just as hard as the thunderbolt that started it all. I deducted a star for battery life, front camera, and the heavier than necessary (in my opinion) weight.", "Date": "November 27, 2012"}, {"Title": "Not my type of phone", "Author": "brittany", "ReviewID": "R3752893J3PS47", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "Do not like HTC and this phone sucked.
