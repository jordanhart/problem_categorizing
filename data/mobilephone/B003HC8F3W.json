This phone featured very large, easy to maneuver buttons. As a plus, it even included a built-in FM radio! Sad to say, this phone was probably better than the one I payed much more for through Verizon. And, since it's a flip phone, the distance between the earpiece (sound output) and microphone was perfect -- no need to move the phone back and forth between your ear and your mouth (you know exactly what I'm talking about!).", "Date": "August 21, 2010"}, {"Title": "Fine for what it is", "Author": "Carl F. Mclaren Jr.", "ReviewID": "RGK2I6NE23L8R", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "First, I know nothing about cell phones and had never used one until today. I suspect I'm the target audience for this and frankly I needed it in case my car broke down or something similar. So I got it out of the box and charged it up. It blinked red for a while and then stopped blinking after about 2 hours. I figured it was now charged up but it wasn't crystal clear because the Quick Start Guide said nothing about the blinking and showed a green battery on the screen indicating charging complete but the battery on the screen is black not green. I tried a few calls with excellent results. Then I added some names and numbers to the phone book which was easy once I figured out how to enter a B whan you push the button on the phone with abc on it. What you do for B is when you see A you press the abc button again, when the B shows pause for a second. It says this in the Quick Start Guide but again it wasn't completely obvious the way it was worded. The plans require no contract and if you just want an emergency phone it is $10 per month and $.25 per minute. A $20 plan is 250 minutes a month and $.25 per minute if you go over. There are lots of other plans for more minutes and texting etc. For me this is a good cheap solution for rare usage, I never liked talking on a phone.", "Date": "June 23, 2010"}, {"Title": "Nifty, easy to use phone", "Author": "LA", "ReviewID": "R2DUQKA6741IOK", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I really like this little phone. It feels great and is easy to carry in my pockets. I also like that it closes, so the screen is protected, and I don't have to worry about pocket dialing anyone.The features are limited, but that doesn't bother me. I just want a phone that phones. The phonebook was easy to set up. It also has a calendar, calculator, FM Radio (can only be used with the supplied earphones), and a couple games (I'm never going to play games on my phone).If you purchase this for an older person you will need to set up some of the features, especially the phonebook. I'm in my 50s, and I can handle it. However, I doubt very much my friends' parents could.There was one glitch during setup. I could not get the voicemail to work. I finally had to call customer service. He was stumped as well for some time. Finally, he was able to advise me how to set it up, but even he admitted that it was not 'user error,' but instead a problem with this particular phone. Still, I was able to contact customer service on a Saturday and get a quick, polite response. Be warned, however, customer service assumes you're a befuddled oldster. I felt like the guy talked to me like I was a little, tiny baby.As I said in the beginning, I really like this phone. I'm using an old Kyocera as my main cellphone, and I vastly prefer the Doro. However, the service with the Doro is more than I want to pay. I'm on a prepaid plan and end up paying only about $10 a month. There is not a comparable Consumer Cellular plan, so for now I'm sticking with Virgin Mobile, though I may try to get an upgraded phone.", "Date": "June 30, 2010"}, {"Title": "I HAVE NO COMPLAINTS", "Author": "Margaux Paschke", "ReviewID": "R26WPU294VY6AD", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I think this phone is a perfect for young kids and seniors.  I choose it to help hold me over until the iPhone breaks free from AT&T; this fall (fingers crossed).  My current Motorola phone with Sprint is dying and I do not want to make an expensive phone purchase or get locked into a 2 year contract.  This phone looked like a good option.I have had no problems with signal or dropped calls; in fact, coverage with this phone is better then Sprint.  The clarity of phone calls was fine.  The phone is smaller then I thought it would be, it measures 4\" x 2\" and almost 3/4\" thick.  It does not have an antenna that sticks out like most flip phones, which is nice.  The buttons are large and easy to press.  No misdialing.  The font on the screen is also large.  The back of the phone has a large green button for quick access to emergency numbers.  The front of the phone has two lights, one for battery status and the other to signal new texts.  The package includes the phone, wall charger, carrying strap and earphones.The set up is basic but easy.  I like the functionality more then my present phone since too many features can get in the way of accessing them.  You scroll through the menu of Phonebook (100 entry); Games (Robot & UFO,); Settings for Ring (20 melodies), Alarm (7), Opening (7), Closing (7) and Message (7); Call Log; FM Radio (can set stations but must use earphones to access this feature); Calculator; Calendar (you can add tasks) and Alarm. The phone is bluetooth enabled and the earphones have a clip to help keep in place.The cost ($50) is very reasonable and it requires no contract. Consumer Cellular offers affordable monthly plans ($20/month for 250 minutes or $10/month with $.25 per minute) and although not affiliated with AT&T;, uses their network.  I found Consumer Cellular customer service to be excellent but if you wanted to go elsewhere, they will provide you with a pass code to unlock the phone (it uses a SIM card).  Just note that they cannot guarantee features if an outside carrier is used.This would be the perfect choice for young kids, seniors (endorsed by the AARP for a reason) or those who need a cell phone just for emergencies. It is not the trendiest or most advanced on the market but it does perform well.  If you are looking for a reliable and solid cell phone, this is the phone for you!  The Doro 410 would be my highest recommendation to anyone new to cell phones.", "Date": "June 24, 2010"}, {"Title": "Nice Phone if You Don't Need Much", "Author": "Matthew Erwin", "ReviewID": "R1I3OQ65IVQTQ8", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Playing around with the Doro 410 after having an Iphone for a few years seemed like toying with a relic of yesteryear.  Having a phone such as this you start to think that it should dial in rotary.  However, this is a perfectly fine phone if you are planning on using it as a phone and nothing else.The buttons are big and the menus are easy to navigate.  There are no pages of icons, just single items that say something liek \"Phonebook\" or \"Alarm\" with reasonable pictures to accompany them.  Reception is good and call volume is nice and loud, often a problem with cheaper phones.  Battery time seems fantastic.  It has been on for 3 days with some calling and it still has about 70% of its charge.  Text messaging is excruciatingly slow as it fails to even have a move right button, so you are left waiting a few seconds between each letter so as not to change the letter you just typed.It does have bluetooth, a feature I was glad (and surprised) to see.  I sense this phone would be great for the old and young who don't have much experience with cellphones.  It is easy to use, bright and nice.  It doesn't do a whole lot, but what it does, it does well.", "Date": "June 29, 2010"}, {"Title": "Doro 410 with consumer cellular", "Author": "MOO \"ZIC\"", "ReviewID": "R1FK69GB776JVI", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "First things first:Cons: If you are getting this phone for features like a camera or the texting capability,then don't bother. There is no camera and the texting is very basic and slow. Caller ID is not displayed on the outside of the clamshell / flip phone design. The phone is preset to answer when opened, so it basically defeats your need for caller ID.(This can be changed to the answer mode \"any key\" setting; however. You can view the caller ID after you open the phone.)The Situation: This phone was purchased for my 84 year old (ELDERLY) mother. She has never used a cell phone in her life and lives at an assisted living facility.She wears 2 hearing aids and has failing eyesight.Pros: The Doro 410 has extra loud and clear sound (+35 dB) and a vibrating ringer. Mom likes the choice of the \"old school\" ringer sound. This phone is amazingly simple once set up properly.(She could not have done this herself.) It was easily customizable. I adjusted the display background(wallpaper) to be the easiest for her to see the screen clearly. I hid(Blocked) the games, alarm, calendar, calculator, FM Radio and texting options from the main menu. I also deactivated the call waiting option. Mom loves the Open to answer - Close to hang up setting and doesn't care about the caller ID. The included lanyard makes it easy for her to carry around her neck when she goes out.(And she doesn't lose the phone. : ) You can program the Emergency Call Key on the outside of the phone to text a relative in an emergency. The phone will then call the relative and immediately turn on the speakerphone for mom.(Another good reason for the lanyard.)Essential Accessories: The charging cradle is ideal for mom.(Ordered it online at ConsumerCellular.) The phone has contacts on the bottom. She just drops the phone in the cradle for charging.(Even with the lanyard attached.)Service Carriers: This phone comes locked to the ConsumerCellular network. They are a company that has an agreement with AT & T. So, you are really getting the AT & T network towers. Ask around to make sure AT & T network is strong in your area or this network will not work for you. ConsumerCellular representatives are courteous and helpful.(I believe they are right here in USA. Easy to understand.) Their pricing of plans seem fair.A Possible Option: This is a GSM phone.(Technology used by AT & T, Cingular and TMobile.) Most carriers around the globe use this also.(Verizon and Sprint use CDMA, so the 410 will not work with these guys.) Unlocked cell phones seem to be the trend these days. It is possible to get an unlock code for your Doro 410. I went to cellunlocker dot net and selected Doro. Then, I selected model: 410 and Network: All Other International Carriers and got the IMEI from mom's Doro. Received the unlock code in e-mail for about 10 bucks. My ConsumerCellular SIM was already active. I replaced it with a SIM Card from T-Mobile Prepaid activation kit. Turned on the phone and input the unlock code when the screen for Operator code: Trials: 5 came up. The OK button appeared to the left of the SOS button after I put in the unlock code numbers, so I then pressed OK. The searching icon showed briefly, then T-Mobile appeared where it used to just say My Network. The Doro 410 is now unlocked to all GSM carriers. T-Mobile just happens to have the best reception in the area where mom is. She has a great monthly rate and no contract. You could probably just buy a SIM activation kit for AT & T as well. Hope this helps somebody out there!I think a distinction between the terms \"SENIOR\" and \"ELDERLY\" should be drawn. I would call the Doro 410gsm the perfect \"ELDERLY\" phone. Some seniors may like it as well though. : )Review by an average guy with an elderly mom", "Date": "April 7, 2012"}, {"Title": "Cute phone", "Author": "Dondi", "ReviewID": "R3BM1GO9X9KCHC", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I was so excited to be able to test this cell phone. This cell phone packs a lot of features into such a inexpensive phone. First, the phone on the outside is black. One the back of the phone is an emergency call button. Instead of you having to open the phone, go through all of the menus, it is right there and easy to access. This is a great feature since it is right there if and when you need it. When you open the flip phone up, it is a nice bright white making it easy to see the contrast colored keys.The keys are perhaps the best feature. You are probably saying of course they are good feature. You need these on a phone! Well, I like the keys for different reasons. First, the buttons are large. This is great if you have large fingers or have trouble seeing the small numbers on a regular keypad on a cell phone. The keys are soft to the touch so, you can easily feel when you are pressing the keys which is a great feature for children and senior citizens.The menus are self explanatory. They offer an FM radio on this phone something that I have never seen on most cell phones. You just need to use the headphones that come with the phone. There are a couple of games and the usual features of other cell phones. It was easy to add a contact to the phone book and to view it. The point size of the font was easy to see and the cell phone display was clear and well lit.You do not get choices of ringtones but it will play different music for different things. The ringtones are easy to hear so, even if the phone is in your handbag, you can easily hear it. There is also a vibration feature. Text messaging is available but I cannot comment on it since I did not use this feature while testing it.About the only negative to this cute and almost perfect phone is the fact that the company does not have service in all areas of the country. Where I live, it was a luck of the draw if I would receive cell phone coverage. In most areas, I found that the cell phone did not work. This is the reason that I gave the product only 4 stars. I am hoping that within a couple of years that they offer more cell phone coverage. Before you consider buying this go to Consumer Cellular and see if they offer cell phone coverage in your area.", "Date": "July 15, 2010"}, {"Title": "The perfect phone for someone who doesn't want, or need, all the bells and whistles", "Author": "Anne Masterson", "ReviewID": "RWXO4YEW2XWTO", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I am one of those people who doesn't like cell phones.  It may be because I was hit by a distracted driver talking one on.  However, I have come to accept that they are a necessary evil in today's soceity.  This is the perfect phone for me.This phone is marketed towards seniors, however, I think it would work well with anyone who was not technologically oriented.  It looks and performs like a real phone.  The directions and operation of the phone are ver easy to comprehend.  The phone makes calls and has texting capabilities, but it does not take pictures.Service is provided by Consumer Cellular.  Their service agreements are very easy to understand and not filled with a lot of fine print.  There are multiple payment options based on how much one thinks they may use their phone.  There is no contract and one may cancel at anytime.  AARP members are eligible for a discount.I found the service to be very reliable with crisp, clear phone calls.  I could even make a call from inside my office building where it is virtually impossible to get a signal.  I have been very pleased with phone and service and plan on keeping both.Remember - don't dial and drive!", "Date": "August 15, 2010"}, {"Title": "Great Phone For Mom", "Author": "suz702", "ReviewID": "R2I0M71PHB2DFK", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Got this phone for my mother along with the 19.99/300 minute plan from Consumer Cellular. She really likes the flip phone style, and the ring tones are nice and loud. The key pad has big easy to see buttons. It was simple to program and she really likes the speed dial feature along with the emergency button. Overall, it's a very good deal if you need a no frills phone that is senior friendly. My only complaint is that every time I've talked to my mother on this phone, the call gets dropped at least once. I think it's a Consumer Cellular problem, not the fault of the phone.", "Date": "October 16, 2011"}, {"Title": "Senior Favorite", "Author": "Fred Thompson \"Freddel\"", "ReviewID": "RCGR1RTMNEI8P", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "We are a couple of retired seniors who want the convenience of a cell phone that is easy to use in basic applications and which functions without a lot of geeky rigmarole. Since we don't spend our days with a phone glued to the side of our heads we also want thrifty payment plan options with straightforward pricing and simple contractual obligations.The phone itself is attractively and thoughtfully designed for mature users. Our order was promptly delivered after an Internet setup that allowed us to keep our old cell phone numbers. Initialization by phone took a couple of minutes and, after charging, we were ready to go! Service coverage in our area is superb and we like the capability of calling to anywhere from anywhere in the U.S. without roaming or other surcharge gotchas.
