{"Reviews": [{"Title": "AMAZING television despite some negative reviews", "Author": "M. May \"MRyno\"", "ReviewID": "R3OJTMABMO3WL9", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This TV looks fantastic (both the picture and the actual product)!! After some manipulation of the settings, you can really dial it in to look even better than it looks out of the box (i.e. auto motion plus - off, brightness adjustment, ambient light dimming - off, etc). The black levels are stealthy and near-plasma levels. The color is vibrant and rich. During motion, the picture is one of the best of LCD/LED televisions. Motion isn't quite as good as Plasma, but it isn't too far off. If you are coming to this from a Plasma, give your eyes some time (a week maybe) to adjust to the motion and it will become less noticeable. It's not that your eyes adjust to a worse picture as much as your eyes adjusting to a different technology. Watching my plasma now, I almost feel like it blends/dithers motion which makes it appear smoother when really it is just less \"clear\"  but your eyes tend to accept the blending/dithering that Plasma TVs naturally produce as being more realistic but your eyes will adjust to the nicer LED TVs' motion fairly easily. But, as for this product, it really is a great TV with a great picture. The Smart TV features are ok but should really be viewed as a bonus feature unless that is driving your purchasing decision. My experience is that no apps or Smart TV-like features on any TVs are perfectly executed. They all have their quirks.The picture quality is really fantastic. I am on DirecTV and also use my XBox 360 and a BluRay player. There are a couple channels that seem a little grainy and aren't as good with motion, but I haven't seen those kind of things on BluRay or while playing video games. Just a couple channels that occasionally have grainier content. Watching football, basketball, and other programming has been great and the only channel remotely important to me that had grainy content a couple times was the Golf channel. Everything else is super clear and has great motion. As an FYI, the Auto Motion Plus feature will give some shows or movies the \"Soap Opera\" effect which is why I turn it off completely or have it set to Custom and turn the settings way down. The best way to describe the \"soap opera effect\" that I know if is that the depth of the picture seems to be off. It looks like it was filmed with an HD home video camera. It is especially visible when the camera pans side to side and Auto Motion is on. I think things look better with that off, but, like with TV picture preferences in general, it is all personal preference. These settings just seem to be more natural for my viewing and are more similar to Plasma and CRT televisions.To speak to the negative reviews that I read I'll just say a few things. First, this is not the cheapest LED or LCD out there. It isn't a \"bargain\" but it really will outperform lower-priced TVs as far as picture is concerned. After house sitting for some friends and watching their $1500 LCD, let's just say I was annoyed watching their TV even after tuning it. So, if you are willing to pay for a nicer picture, this TV will deliver. That is all, of course, based on personal preference. As far as quality out of the box, this TV was packaged well and seems to be built very well. I haven't had any issues with hardware or software. The TV is fairly fragile as its thickness prevents major reinforcements to rigidity. Once it is out of the box, be careful with the bottom (Samsung logo bump may hold all the weight if you set it down). Also be careful to keep it perpendicular to the ground. If you are holding one end and the other end is not being held, the weight of the TV and lack of rigidity causes the unsupported end to bend toward the ground if it's not kept straight up and down. I was able to unbox the TV and mount it on my wall by myself which I do not recommend at all but that should speak to the light weight and build quality. Just remember that it is a very thin piece of glass, silicon and metal and is fragile until you have it mounted or on its stand. Be careful and have a friend help and you will be fine.To sum up, compared to other LCD/LED TVs, this is a great option. The picture is bright, rich and clear and the TV looks awesome from a design standpoint. There are probably some plasma TVs that will provide a better picture at around the same price but they don't have the same thin footprint, will consume more power, and (in my opinion) offer only marginal black level advantages. This TV is great with the lights off at night or for watching during the day in a bright room. Make sure to adjust the settings. Construction quality is good though, it is still a thin and relatively fragile piece of equipment (so be careful while unboxing!). After a side-by-side in my living room with a similarly priced Panasonic plasma, it was close as far as picture but the thin bezel and thin profile won me over. I've had it for 3 months and I absolutely love it.", "Date": "October 12, 2012"}, {"Title": "Quite happy, awesome picture and great Smart TV features", "Author": "D. Wichmann", "ReviewID": "R2N0BKHVO019FY", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "When I purchased the 60\" version of this tv a couple weeks ago I was a little nervous since it didn't have any reviews at the time.  However the 6500 and 7500 had enough positive reviews to make me comfortable, and most negatives had to do with buggy 2012 software which I'm assuming they'll address, and also which I have not experienced myself at this point.  The 7100 seemed like a nice step up in performance and aesthetics over the 6500 w/out a big price difference.I'm a bit surprised to see some of the negative reviews at this point.  I've had mine for 2 weeks and thus far am quite impressed.  I was replacing a 6-year old 720p 40\" Sony LCD and the first thing I noticed is that this 60\" 1080p makes lower quality programming very noticeable.  No surprise here when increasing the screen size and resolution, clearly low quality programming will look worse.  However when I popped in a blu ray (Start Trek 2009) I was completely blown away with the quality, clarity and sharpness.  It was simply the best looking picture I had ever seen, and it was right there in my living room.  The picture produced from my Xbox 360 was also amazing, it took game playing to a whole new level.  It's clear that this set has the potential to display an incredible picture with a high quality source, however it will make your lower quality programming look rather poor, and even my Comcast HD programming pales in comparison to a blu ray.I found the SmartTV feature really nice.  The interface is clean, responsive and intuitive.  I was disappointed with missing apps for 2012's including HBO Go and Amazon Instant, but I'm hoping it's just a matter of time.  The Netflix app works nice and HD shows on Netflix look quite good as well.  I'm also able to stream most photos and videos from my network attached storage device via DLNA, including large file size mkv videos (e.g. 17GB), including 3D as well.  Unfortunately however my iPhone videos did not play.Sound is adequate for tv speakers and for regular shows I just use the built in sound, of course for better movie and gaming experience I turn on my surround sound system for a better experience.  Aesthetically the set looks really sharp, a big difference over the 6500 with a substantially thinner bezel and a nice lighted Samsung symbol at the bottom.I have noticed a bit of edge blur which is apparently common for edge lit led tvs, but it's only apparent during some very dark scenes, and I haven't really adjusted the picture settings much at this point so I believe this is something that can be minimized.Overall I'm quite happy and I think this is an excellent set for the money.", "Date": "July 7, 2012"}, {"Title": "Nice. But is it overpriced?", "Author": "sri440", "ReviewID": "R2MIPNBPO6QOZA", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "Bought the UN60ES7100 (60\" LED) from a local retail chain and have had this set for about a week now.1. Packaging: Light weight and can easily be lifted by 2 people. \"Un\" boxing is pretty straightforward and effortless. However, since the bezel is very thin, it's easy to get your finger impressions (especially your thumb) on the screen. So, you need to be extra cautious of that.What's in the box: 60\" LED panel, panel base (used for securing the panel to the stand), stand, standard remote w/2 batteries, 4 pairs of 3D glasses, instruction manuals.2. Assembly: Simple process but the instructions ask that you lay the panel face-down (screen facing the floor) on a blanket to attach the stand. I found this a little odd. Needless to say, you have to be *extremely* careful with this maneuver. Especially with a large 60\" screen. (A neat trick here is to use the packaging material to prop up one end of the panel while you attach the stand).3. Stand: It's the classic X shaped Samsung LED stand. I have another Samsung 46\" LED TV with a similar stand. That one feels really sturdy and secure. For a 60\" panel, the stand seems slightly inadequate. It doesn't feel as sturdy and the panel \"sways\" easily.4. Connections: 3 HDMI. For me, all 3 were used up immediately by 1)FiOS Set-top box, 2)Sony BD Player and 3)Apple TV. In addition, I hooked up my Wii console through the component input. All connections are located on the right side (if you're facing the TV). Power plugs into a slot left of center. And oh, I have a wired connection to the internet although the TV natively supports Wi-Fi.5. Setup: Very easy setup. When you turn on the TV for the first time, you are prompted to select \"Home\" or \"Commercial\" mode. Then, date/time. That's pretty much it. Since I have a wired internet connection, I was not prompted for any Wi-Fi password, etc. It took just a few minutes for the set to automatically download and install some firmware upgrades.6. Remote: Universal remote that can be programmed to be used with the FiOS set-top box as well. However, the \"universal\" remote does not support all features. I could not find a way, for example, to bring up the channel listings that come up when you press the \"Guide\" button on the FiOS remote. Likewise, I could not bring up the DVD menu using the Samsung remote to control my attached Sony Blu-Ray player...there is no equivalent button for the \"DVD menu/top menu\" buttons. I was able to use the Play, Pause, FF, etc. buttons, though.6. \"Smart\" TV: The Samsung Apps interface has been revamped (relative to my 46\" UN46C6000, which I bought in 2009). The new interface has the most popular apps like Facebook, YouTube, Netflix, Pandora etc. on the \"home\" screen. In addition, the home screen features  apps for Wellness/Fitness and \"Family Story\". I haven't explored these apps yet so can't comment on their utility. I did launch YouTube though and found one glaring difference in functionality when compared with my 46\" series 6 TV. In that set, when I used the iPhone Samsung Remote app in conjunction with YouTube, the iPhone virtual keyboard would appear when I went to the YouTube Search option. This does not happen with the 7100, which is quite disappointing. You do, however, have the option to hook up a wireless keyboard (like Logitech) via bluetooth to the TV. IMHO, why should I purchase a wireless keyboard when I could use the Remote app on my iPhone/iPad?7. Picture Quality: This is where the \"Overpriced?\" tag in my review title kicks in. The 7100 has the usual Dynamic, Standard, Natural and Movie picture mode options. Personally, I like Movie mode the best. The other modes seem very \"artificial\" with either too much color or sharpness or both. The picture quality is very good with HD content but as some previous reviewers have noted, the SD channels are blurry and cloudy regardless of the picture mode. Luckily for me, I hardly watch any SD channels. Even with HD, there is some room for improvement.As you may know, most Pixar Blu-Ray discs (Toy Story series, for instance) come with a caibration tool in their setup menu. So, I used one of these Blu-Ray discs to attempt some basic calibration and followed the instructions. When it came to calibrating contrast, I was not able to achieve the desired result even with contrast turned all the way up to 100 (max setting). Having paid $2500+, I think it's reasonable to expect to have achieved the desired result with some room to spare! Granted, this is basic calibration and perhaps the desired result can be achieved by having the TV professionally calibrated. But that's the point -- I shouldn't have to spend another $250-$300 (~10% of the cost of the TV) for prefessional calibration after spending $2500! It should be functioning at it's optimal levels out of the box with minor tweaks.8. Refresh Rate: The 7100 has a 240Hz refresh rate and boasts a \"Clear Motion Rate\" of 720. For the most part, transitions are smooth and non-discernable. But at times, even with such high refresh rates, certain fast action transitions look animated. For instance, I was watching \"America's Got Talent\" the other night and some fast moves by one of the dance groups seemed animated i.e. you could see the \"breaks\" between their fast movements.9. Audio Quality: It's pretty much in line with what you can expect from the super thin profile of an LED TV. They certainly do the job for normal viewing but for watching movies, I would highly recommend hooking up some external speakers. I have Bose speakers hooked up and am very pleased.10. 3D: I have always considered the current 3D technology a gimmick rather than a real feature. Regardless of manufacturer or brand. The technology as a whole has a long way to maturity so I'll not comment on this ( I haven't even opened the box with the 3D glasses). There is a 6100 model with somewhat comparable specs but without 3D and it is cheaper by about ~$600. I could have bought that instead, but the key difference is the refresh rate....the 6100 is 120Hz vs 7100's 240Hz. Also, the 6100 does not have the micro dimming feature.Bottomline: Nice, aesthetically pleasing TV with a ton of features and apps. The TV scores very high points in these areas. However, for one of the highest priced 60\" TVs in the market (see note below), the most fundamental feature i.e. picture or image quality has a big scope for improvement. For that reason I think the TV is a little overpriced. Especially when TVs from competitors with comparable image quality are available for less than $2000 (60\" models).Note: From what I know, the highest priced 55\"-60\" LED TVs are Pioneer Elite (~$5000), Samsung 8000 series (~$3000) and then the Samsung 7 series ($2500 - $3000). Thus the 60\" Samsung 7100 is the third highest priced LED TV in the market.", "Date": "July 19, 2012"}, {"Title": "Wow....1 regret..one complaint..", "Author": "Superman Reads (Singapore/USA)", "ReviewID": "RCETR24T5O79C", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "First and foremost, I'm not an video freak, nor am I the techie guy that can explain every single in and out of a tv. I'd say I'm an average guy that was looking for an above average picture on the tv, with a little functionality with Netflix, Pandora and some of the streaming movie apps. The room I put the TV in is my sunroom, meaning 2 of the 4 walls are just about all windows and the sun hits them perfectly. Needless to say, glare was a concern and consideration before purchasing.About 2 months ago I purchase the Samsung UN55ES6500, so I have a pretty good reference for comparison. I was and am still extremely happy with the UN55ES6500 because it's a quality tv, friendly apps and only occasionally have wifi issues while watching netflix, but I'm fairly certain it's my home router rather than the tv.The UN46ES7100 is worth every penny. My big debate was whether or not the 7100 was worth the extra money in comparison to the 6500.. YES.. YES.. YES.. For the folks that have left reviews and stated you can't tell much of a difference, they are completely wrong. I put the two tvs side by side (which is so easy now with wireless cable boxes) and the 7100 blows it away and I was completely satisfied with the 6500 and still am. The 7100 is just a sharper picture and the quality is much greater. I'm a big sports guy, especially college football and this tv offers the best picture I have seen. I have not seen the 7500 or 8000 series in person, so I can't compare to those two, but this picture is simply amazing, especially for sports. There's no blurring and you feel you're right on the field.I tried the 3D for the first time yesterday, watching Avatar and it's pretty incredible. It's not the same as in the theater because TV technology just isn't there yet, but it's still going to give you a fun 3d effect and it's a nice feature to have, especially with some of the kids 3d movies. The depth of the 3D is amazing. The part that's lacking are the out of the TV effects, meaning the ones that are supposed to pop out of the tv.There are zero glare issues, which I hoped for with the LED. If there was ever a room to have a glare problem, this is it. None.The apps are great.. Easy to use and I've had no issues.. I've used a half dozen so far such as netflix, vudu, pandora, etc.. No issues.. I didn't buy it for web surfing or using facebook.. It's my tv, not my computer.My one regret.. The size. 46 is a nice size.. I think 55 would have been better. With as thin and tiny amount of space these things take up nowadays, the tv doesn't look that big.One complaint.. the sound isn't amazing.. I knew that going in.. SOme of it probably has to do with the tv being a size too small for the room as well as it not being an accoustic friendly room, but I'm think a soundbar or surround sound is going to be needed for movies.. It's fine for tv shows and sports, but some movies it's tough to get clarity on the speech.Final thought.. Is the 7100 and the microdimming worth the extra $300? Absolutely.. if you can afford it, it's completely worth it.. I wouldn't go out of your price range to get it, but if you can afford it, you'll be thrilled with this tv.EDIT: One thing to add that's important.. the cables you use and input are extremely important, meaning the Blu ray player can't be junk and the cable can't be cheap in order to get the best quality.. I learned that by testing different ones.. For HDMI, get the mediabridge.. Hands down the best picture you're going to get. Don't compromise there or you're wasting money on a great tv.", "Date": "October 26, 2012"}, {"Title": "Superb TV and excellent customer service!", "Author": "Ingeniero1 \"Tecnico1\"", "ReviewID": "R1BHIQOIXWS8AA", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I have had the Samsung UN60ES7100 60-inch Smart TV for about a month. The picture quality is as good as Samsung says it is, and as good as has been reviewed elsewhere - 100% satisfied with it. The other functions of the TV also are great. I have an older Sony sound system connected to it and it works fine. My older DVD player has HDMI output and is fully compatible with the TV. I have connected USB flash drives (plugged directly into one of the TV's USB ports) and played movies and displayed pictures. My Canon video camera has HDMI output and it also is fully supported.I have had a few questions about setting up the various options and other features, so I have called Samsung 800 help number three times so far.

The 3D is really good. Its active 3D, which gives you a greater viewable amount of the screen as opposed to the passive 3D.

Didn't get the 7500 which has a lot of extra features like voice and gesture commands. And I'm glad I didn't, because I don't think I'll ever use the software on the TV. Netflix and Hulu run much better on a PS3 than they do on the TV.The TV is edgelit which means the bulbs are placed on the edges of the tv and pointed inward. Any time that this is the case, you'll get some glowing in some parts of the screen.

First review ever of anything, just to try to help out people that are in the same boat I was in.Second, to get to the bare knuckled overview of the 60es7100 skip the next couple of paragraphs that tell of my trials and tribulations while trying to secure the best tv for my buck.A new big-screen TV is one of the biggest purchases I will be making, so I took a lot of time researching and reading in my decision process.  Let me tell you right off the bat, what you read can be deceiving.I am coming from a 2008 Panasonic 42\" plasma, which I was very happy with over the years.  The reason I decided I needed a new TV was because a friend of my picked up a 2011 model Samsung 55\" and the Blu-rays on that TV blew me away.  I was amazed at the 2d depth and clarity of picture.  And so my quest to find a new tv began.  After reading and reading and reading some more, I came to the conclusion that the tv to get was the Panasonic 60st50.  It is super highly regarded by big name reviewers like CNET, it has got great ratings on places like amazon, and it seemed to be the best value for the money.  Now, armed with this information, I just had to convince my girlfriend that we should purchase this new tv.  It took some convincing and time, but...One dark and dreary afternoon, as some storm clouds rolled in over the horizon, we departed our quaint little house in search of the every elusive HDTV of our dreams.  We decided that our first stop should be our aforementioned friends house.  She needed to see the quality in which hdtv's have progressed over the last 4-5 years.  It took all of 2 minutes of watching a game of thrones blu-ray for her to declare- OK  lets go buy a tv.  WooHoo!  Off we went to Best Buy, in hopes of having them price match amazon and away we would walk with our new Panasonic 60st50.When we got to Best Buy the girlfriend immediately thought that the LED's looked way better than the Plasmas.  I explained that, that is often the case because of how lit up show rooms and big box stores are and that LEDs are brighter and look better in those conditions.  I also explained how everywhere online still said: don't be fooled, go for the plasma.  Ultimately, I let her make the decision (she has boobs, I can't say no) and we bought the Samsung 55es7100.  We brought it home and it looked, for the most part, fantastic.  The picture was bright, crisp, and clear.  The 3d was awesome, the 2d had good depth, it was nice.  Unfortunately the clouding around the corners was horrible.  Most the time it wasn't noticeable, but during super dark scenes, ugh.  I read that it will reduce with time, and that also you could lightly 'massage' the screen to lessen the clouding.  I probably could have lived with it, but there was one more major flaw.  As great as the movies and blu-rays looked, I watched my first football game and was really disappointed.  The way the tv deals with motion is, ummm, interesting.  There are many motion settings, so  I messed around, and found some that I think I liked.  I noticed the motion blur in fast scenes during movies and while it was kind of disappointing, overall it was not too bad... But, the football game was the killer.  Whenever there was a fast pass the football would seem to jerk in and out of existence and seemingly flicker.  Still, the television looked so beautiful in movies and slower parts of the game that I was torn as to whether or not to return it.  After a few weeks, I did just that.I decided the motion blur was to much for me to deal with.  I later would find out turning off the Digital Noise Filter would fix my problems.  At this point, I decided to go with what my research told me to go with: the plasma 60st50.  Not only was it 5\" bigger (which is significant, adds nearly 20% viewing area), it was also $200 cheaper.  A couple days later I received it.  I heard that plasma has to break in a little, but the first thing I did was apply settings I found on the Internet.  The TV looked good.  Very very solid.  The colors seemed accurate, the blacks were great, the clarity was superb.  And the motion blur was non existent  Zero.  But...it just didn't have the realism, 2d depth, the pop, or wow factor to it that I have seen with both my friends and my Samsung LED.  I couldn't put my finger on it, but it just didn't seem as good of a picture.  I had the plasma for three weeks, while continuing to read online about both the TV I owned and the TV I departed with.  Then the girlfriend starting sharing her opinion, that, for such a huge amount of money we should make sure we have the TV we like the most.  And she liked the Samsung way better.  Just as she was putting this in my ear, the price of the 60es7100 dropped to $1999 plus a $200 amazon gift card.  And despite, never before in my life returning a fully functional product, I returned my second TV in the previous month and a half and purchased the 60es7100.-----Overview.I purchased the 60es7100 and I couldn't be happier.  It looks fantastic.  Clouding is very minimal and turning off the digital noise filter fixed my football problem.  If you are deciding between this and the Panasonic plasma's, let your own eyes be the judge not online reviews.  I owned both and believe the Samsung LED to be a considerable amount better when it comes to the picture it produces.PRO's:- Picture quality is great.  Picture clarity is amazing.  There is a depth to the picture that you have to see to understand.  The colors seem accurate to me, and I never notice any 'screen uniformity' issues.  The blacks are plenty deep and the whites are really bright.- Physical form is great, albeit, not as nice as the 55es7100.  The bezel is slightly larger than the 55, but still very small.  The TV is light and easy to set up.- Smart Hub works fine.  I use it for netflix and  youtube.  Having HD movies streamed straight through the tv is awesome. Typing sucks.  The web browser works, but a keyboard would be needed to make it anything less than tedious.  But seriously, use a computer.- 3d is good.  2d->3d conversion works decent.  I haven't watch a ton of 3d content so it is hard to review, but I do enjoy it.  I would say very similar 3d in the panasonic and in this.  The glasses are decent, nothing special, but affordable and included.- Motion blur is minimal.- Settings are abundant.  Can really fine tune the settings. (pro and con)- Remote control is nice, navigating the tv's functions is easy.- Putting movies or music on a usb and plugging straight in the back of a tv is a nice bonus that I wasn't counting on.CON's:- Sound is weak.  Seriously, where are you supposed to fit decent speakers in a TV this thin?  Oh yeah, nowhere!  If you buy an expensive new tv budget in another $150-$200 for a sound bar or surround system.  I learned this real fast.  I picked up a Sony ct150 sound bar system and it works great. It hooks up through the ARC hdmi port so I can control it through my tv remote and my Directv remote.- There is some clouding.  It is hardly ever noticeable though in actual TV usage.- Motion control still not quite up to par with plasma technology.- Settings are abundant.  I have no idea if I have my TV working at its peak performance.  Probably not, any suggestions from current owners, feel free to share.  And some settings, while you change them, remain hidden behind the menu.  Dumb.- SD picture quality.  Meh.  Not sure if this should be a con or not.  But after watching almost all HD then trying to watch a standard def channel, seems worse than it probably is.Advice:- Feel good about purchasing from Amazon.  I couldn't be happier with the price, the customer service (returning a big screen HDTV), and the delivery they provide.  Amazon takes care of their customers.- Buy a sound bar or surround system for this TV, for real.  If you are spending this much don't cheap out on the sound.- If you like getting the most out of your HDTV, DirecTV offers a great signal.  I switched from Comcast cable (HD) and the difference is incredible.  If I would have known, I would have switched years before I did.- Let your own eyes tell you the truth.  Go to best buy during a non busy time and have them play the same scene from a blu ray for you on the TV's you are considering.  Reviews can get you narrowed down, but trust your eyes.", "Date": "January 17, 2013"}, {"Title": "smart hub problem", "Author": "A.

Movies were impressive as well.The problem was with the cable channels.  The SD channels were practically unwatchable, even some of the HD channels looked a bit cloudy and seemed overly sharp, and the sports channels were terrible.  With soccer, the image was sharp when still, but when moving with the action, the grass would constantly blur and then clear up.  It gave me a headache.  I tried some NFL clips and in those, I saw some flickers across the screen.  Based on online reviews/suggestions, I tried disabling the judder setting and maximized the motion blur.  Didn't help and I actually disabled all the smoothing software to see some improvement.  But overall, I was getting dizzy and after a day couldn't handle it.I returned it and picked up the Panasonic plasma GT50. CNET reviews these as the best overall TVs of 2012 so far.

I researched and read all that I could for months before finally deciding on the 60\" Samsung UN60ES7100. And I'm glad I did, I couldn't be happier. I wanted to future-proof the TV best I could, and the 240 Hz, Wi-Fi, and 3D technology does that for me. I mostly watch CNN, History Channel, and HBO anyway, so I don't have much need for 3D, but it's nice to have as the technology evolves.Here are a few things I wish someone would've made more clear as I was doing my own research:- Go as big as you can. I purchased the 60\" and could've gone bigger. It's amazing how quickly you'll aclimate to the size, and even when it's off it looks like a piece of art. No, really.- I live in an industrial-style corner loft with walls of huge windows on either side of the set and there's virtually no glare. Didn't think that'd be possible, but completely appreciate the matte finish.- The TV's a little over an inch think, so no - the speakers aren't concert quality, but they're a heck of a lot better than people make them out to be. I decided to buy a Sony soundbar thinking I'd need one, but I still use the television's speakers 70% of the time. Get over yourself already.- Make sure you have a HD DVR and HMDI cables - and for the love of God reprogram your remote for HD channels otherwise you're just driving a Ferrari on a dirt road.- Like others have said, you've got to invest some time tweaking settings until it looks right to you, but it's not that bad right out of the box. (I'd post mine, but apparently I'm too lazy to detail them all.)- Pandora...okay, now THERE'S a reason to upgrade your speakers. (All right audiophiles, I hear ya.)- Wi-Fi and streaming works well, but a laptop's still faster and easier. Future-proof stuff, remember? And while I'm on it, I'm glad I didn't pay the extra money for the camera and gesture controls. How lazy can a person be anyway?- I have a HD DVR, PS3, and Sony soundbar hooked up, plenty of connections - all use HMDI and look/sound fantastic.I've owned it for about a month, still not using it to its fullest potential, but I'm blown away by it every day.

My eyes had always gravitated toward the rich deep colors afforded by plasma screens.  When seeking to move up from our 42\" screen to a larger size, I noticed that this Samsung 7100 LED HDTV kept popping up as being highly rated.  Also I noticed that the going price these days is around $1500, which is over $1000 off the MSRP.  So I figured that even though my first choice would have been to go plasma, why not at least look at this LED set. We ended up buying it based on how great it looked in the store, along with the good price.  When I got it home, I noticed that it was a breeze to set up and mount on my wall.  The weight was about half of my former plasma set, which makes this quite manageable for myself and a weaker partner (in this case my wife) to set up.  You really do need two people so that you don't accidentally drop the thing.  This warning applies to all flat screen sets above 32 inches by the way.  Upon hooking up the 7100 to my DirectTV receiver as a source, I was immediately a little bit under-impressed.  What's going on?  So I punched up the Menu and noticed that the picture setting was on some kind of auto dimming mode that is supposed to adjust for your ambient light. I switched to \"standard\" and the picture immediately looked great once again.  Please use \"standard\" picture mode or one of the other non-eco modes if you want a good picture.  Anyhow, in \"standard\" picture mode, the picture is, in a word, \"stunning!\".  The colors are rich and deep and I would say are on a par (or nearly so) with a top line plasma set.  The blacks are also very deep and for most viewers, myself included, are about as good as you're going to find in a flat screen TV.  This is not to say that I still don't like plasma for it's superb black levels (such as the pana VT50 and Samsung 7000/8000 series plasmas), but this 7100 series LED does certainly give one an extremely satisfying black level.  The colors on the 7100 picture pop also because of the incredible brightness and clarity afforded by the LED backlighting (in this case edge lit, but you would never know it).  The Samsung micro-dimming must be working great because I see nothing but pure and even lighting across the screen including corners and edges with no evidence of ghosting or cloudiness.  Also, I am very pleased that the built in speakers are quite good, if not excellent for most normal family room TV and blue-ray/DVD watching.  I frankly do not like the cheesy overdone boomy bass on most \"home theater\" setups, and if you're like me you don't want a bunch of unnecessary cost and complexity in order to get \"good sound\".  I found the built in speakers quite good and pleasing to the ears - not tinny or cheap sounding at all. I'd bet most buyers would be OK with them.  Naturally, the home theater buffs will find the built in speakers lacking, and they would be right in the context strictly of sonics for home theater cinematic viewing or gaming.  But for normal TV watching (news, sitcoms, and movies presented via Netflix or DirectTV), I think the built in speakers are quite good actually.  So don't think you're going to 'need' a sound bar or some kind of \"home theater\" speaker system to make this a satisfying purchase.  This set will provide excellent sound right out of the box.  I've not had time to explore all the smart TV features of the 7100, but I did view some Netflix content and it downloaded fast, and looked excellent on the set.  So in summary, while I am still a plasma fan at heart, I must say that Samsung has done the LED world quite proud with the 7100 LED HDTV, and I can wholeheartedly recommend it as a worthy product. It's much superior to almost all the other LCD/LED sets on the market which are anywhere near this price point.  A quick word on the aesthetics of the Samsung 7100.  I find the set to be quite attractive and the narrow pencil thin bezel almost dissappears when you are viewing.  I have mine mounted to the wall using a slim Tv mounting bracket, and the effect is startling to see this crisp and clear picture jumping out of the wall with essentially no bezel to distract you.  I'd like to have a menu option to turn off or at least dim the samsung logo at the bottom of the screen.  I suppose that's about my only minor aesthetics issue/complaint, and I can live with it just as I did with the red light on my former panasonic set.  The Samsung 7100/7150 LED HDTV is an outstanding product and I'd recommend it to anyone looking for a great value in a top-of-the-line HDTV.", "Date": "March 3, 2013"}, {"Title": "Very happy this TV", "Author": "Oyinko", "ReviewID": "R2JDXFWTSKCY8P", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I just received the TV.

The picture is sharp, sounds is great. The designs is sharp and slim,really looks beautiful.It does have a major flaw in its Internet connection that you should be aware of (and rest assured the SAME thing will happen on your TV):When setting it up (around Xmas time 2012) I wasn't able to get a data connection. The TV told be there was an error in \"binding\" with the router wirelessly. Sometimes it showed the Wireless network, sometimes it didn't. Strange. There was an apple TV sitting inches away from the TV which showed both my networks (2.4GHZ and 5GHZ) without a problem with full signal strength. Ok, logical conclusion maybe an issue with the wireless module of the TV. So I try the usual suspects anyway; power cycle TV, router, modem, yada, yada.Nothing - TV adapter can't bind.Ok so wireless doesn't want to play, we plug in Ethernet. Funny enough the adapter can't bind. I know networks, adapters Ip addresses and TCP /IP issues, but this was starting to smell funny. Quick check, ethernet wire is live and assigns IP's fine, so no fault of the router. Dial customer service  - there is that big yellow sticker that shows a number to call - and relatively promptly someone answers. Kudos to Samsung, you do have tech support without the endless loop. Good start.Tech support tells me that there is a problem with the Samsung TV app, which causes the issue. They know about the problem and are addressing it. Ok fair enough, they have an issue, tell you about it and say it will be fixed. Apple would have told you everything was fine on their end and you were the idiot, but that's another story.  So at this point I am wondering why a server problem on the Samsung Hub would prevent the TV's ethernet adapter to establish a connection? Well, the TV was new, picture excellent and I used it for a few days with Apple TV and amazing HD movies. Next day or so Samsung Smart Hub is back up, downloads all kind of updates and reports for duty.Happy campers we are enjoying our new TV.... until.... one day no Internet. Smart Hub can't connect. Doesn't see an adapter, doesn't connect to the adapter. Nothing.After calling customer service and getting through to Level 3 tech support (because all answers before made no sense), I finally get an explanation. Fasten you seat belts. You're not in Kansas anymore. Literally.According to Level 3 - this TV - an all other TV's that have a \"Smart Hub\" connect to a server in South Korea. Yes South Korea. I guess that's better than North Korea, but still. If the server in South Korea, that runs all North American TV's has a hiccup, poof you lose your Internet connection. Well hopefully they have more then one, but that is still a bit weird. Korea? Geographically they could have maybe picked New Zealand or Australia to send the data packets a little further.The 'Smart Hub\" is certainly far from smart - because it should tell you that it lost its connection to Korea and therefore will cease all Internet access and render the Internet part of the TV inoperable. That seems pretty ... uh shall we say challenged....Instead the TV sends you on wild goose chase thinking your adapter, modem or Internet connection went bye bye. No, its just the Samsung DUMB HUB.So in summary, this TV is great if you don't need the Internet all the time. The smart hub does get knocked out frequently and then hasta la vista, baby.

I read some of the other complaints from the real serious TV viewers on this line of Samsung TV's, but I have not experienced any of these issues. The picture is spectacular, especially Blu-Ray, the 240 refresh rate is legit and mandatory as there is no pixelation on fast moving images like music award shows with strobe lights, and contrary to what many have said about the Smart function on this TV it has been very user friendly. Getting a wireless keyboard hooked up to the TV was idiot-proof and makes surfing the web easy. Getting blue-tooth activated devices synced with the Samsung sound bar was effortless. Playing XBox on this thing takes it to a whole other level, I just question why I hadn't purchased a TV like this years ago (then I remember the $5k I dropped on the crappy Aquos in the other room!).For the price and ease and picture, this TV is the real deal. Samsung is by far well ahead of the other manufacturers in what they're producing. If you have the room, I suggest going with the 60\" over the 55\". You may think 5\" is not a big deal, but it really makes a huge difference. When you're friends come over to watch football on the 60\" they know you're bringing the heavy equipment, it just might be difficult getting them out of your house afterwards.Amazon's white glove shipping service (all free) was great.

Not impressed.", "Author": "L. Ray", "ReviewID": "R1IJWG3ADD1I68", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I own and have installed many brands of LCD, LED, and Plasma TVs.  Our previous television was an older 43\" Pioneer Plasma which had excellent video quality but eventually suffered the dreaded 'burn in' issue.  In my office, I watch a Samsung 32\" LN32B540 720P LCD television which has a beautiful picture and easy menu options.  I enjoy this one a lot which is why I recently purchased the Samsung 60\" 7100 series LED TV...hoping for a similar experience.Let me go straight to the PROS and CONS:PROS: - Large screen, thin edges. - Very light weight!  Easy to move around by one person. - TV stand is simple, easy to install, and not bulky. - Uses LESS energy.  Big plus vs. my old Pioneer Plasma. - Got it for a \"pretty good\" price during Christmas sales (but see my conclusion)CONS: - #1 problem:  Cloudy, side-lights coming in around all the edges.  It is VERY obvious and I'm surprised more people haven't complained about it.  I've spent many hours trying to tweak the settings and can't get rid of it.  If this is a by-product of the LED design of this set, it lowers the quality of this set. - Compared to my OLD Pioneer Plasma set, my wife and I are both disappointed with the image quality (color/contrast).  We changed the settings many times and never once felt like it was right.  The image quality is sharp and the refresh rate is fast...but something about the colors and possibly the LED lighting is throwing it off.  May have to call a Samsung expert out to calibrate it ($$$). - SMART TV??  The APP menus are a mess.  Extremely slow to process, poorly laid out, and overwhelming.  Horrible design and not meant for beginners. - Due to the menu system, this TV BEGS for a keyboard.  You'll throw the remote across the room after a few minutes because it is too difficult to interact with the TV.  And, with the slow menu response, it's even worse. - Even with my high-speed internet access, I felt the NETFLIX app (which is the only one we really use) is too slow and plain.  In general, I haven't found a TV or DVD device that has a quality NETFLIX app.  For a 7100 series TV, one should expect more from the \"SMART\" label they put on it. - Samsung positioned the HDMI ports in a bad spot.  The power cord and HDMI cords are on opposite side of this 60\" TV.  This makes it difficult to route all the cords back to a center point (see Samsung photos).  They should have turned the ports towards the center of the screen. - And, as most have said, the speakers are pretty weak.  Unless you are sitting 10'-12' away, you'll want to purchase a separate speaker bar or hook this up to a sound system.(NEVER turned on the 3D settings so I can't comment about it)**Because I have a Samsung TV that I've enjoyed watching for many years, I was hoping this 'higher end' Samsung set would blow it out of the water.  It doesn't.  The price tag (nearly $2K) is not justifiable.  You could purchase a Samsung 6000 series or VIZIO LED TV for much less and probably come out with a better \"quality to price\" ratio.  If I could return this set, I would (return policy issues say I can't).  Please do more research before buying this TV.

I grew frustrated that many TV's advertised 120hz, but were in fact 60hz.  All the major stores, including amazon did that.  You had to search to find the true HZ.  Don't get me started on the true motion rate compared to the hz rates.  This TV though has it all.  True 240hz, with true motion of 720.  The first thing I noticed was that for many shows, the camera handler wasn't steady.  that's how fast the refresh rate is, you pick up minor camera movements.  It also makes you feel like you are actually in the room, car chase, or what have you.  The true gem, was when I was testing out the features of the TV.  No where was it advertised that it had airplay.  My daughter who was using my ipad to watch Netflix, said \"daddy, my show won't play\" as she looked up, Netflix popped up on the TV and she said \"oh there it is, how did it get on your TV?\"  Needless to say, the applications on the TV are pretty advanced.

Shea", "ReviewID": "R205IA8B2UDHRG", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I was able to purchase the 60ES7100 during the Super Bowl sale.  My situation is that I am coming from a 42\" 720p plasma, so it was a pretty big leap for me.  I choose LED because I have a bright room and like the brighter picture of the LED TVs.  I had narrowed down my choice between Samsung and Sony and finally picked the Samsung for the value since this TV went on sale.First, delivery of the TV with Amazon was flawless.  Always buy from Amazon if you can.  The delivery guys were on-time, came in and setup the TV in 5 minutes. Amazon's customer service was amazing as well.  I had to replace my first TV because it wouldn't turn off on two occasions.  I called Samsung to troubleshoot the situation and they were less than helpful.  Honestly, not sure it was a problem with the TV or my receiver, but Amazon offered to replace it at no charge.  Best customer service ever!Now for the TV.  The physical look of the TV is beautiful.  The bezel is thin and has a very classic look.  As with any TV, the most important aspect is the picture quality.  The color palate on Samsung TVs in general is amazing and is it strongest aspect.  The contrast and pop you get from the TV is very vibrant, but still very natural looking.  The latest firmware update has made the picture even better.  The clarity of the the TV is sharp and a pleasure to watch.  I watch a lot of sports too and was afraid of the blurring issues LED tend to have.  I must say the blurring is very minimal and I am a very picky about that.  The other issue I was afraid of LED is the \"Soap Opera\" effect that they can have.  Samsung allows you to adjust the \"judder\" which makes movies look cinematic in which soap opera is a none issue without any blurring as well.  Viewing angles are good...the picture becomes a bit brighter and has less color saturation around 40-45 degrees.When you first receive this TV, your initial impression might be a little disheartening.  I realized that there is definitely a \"break-in period\" for this TV.  The picture was more jittery, blurry and the contrast was a little unnatural.  After about two weeks, the TV settle in and colors became more natural and picture became much more crisp.  Also, you need to adjust the settings to get this TV to look perfect. It's pretty easy to find good calibration settings if you Google it (btw, you can use picture setting for the ES8000, ES7500, or ES7100 since it uses the same processor).  I also had some minimal clouding when I initial got the TV that was only visible on a black screen in the dark.  Since then (with some gentle massage of the TV screen) the clouding is almost gone.The only con I found so far was watching a very dark scene (Thor beginning scene), it was difficult to see since it was so dark.  That's where a plasma, full back lit LED, or even ES8000 might do a better job.As for the Smart TV portion, I don't really use since I have a Apple TV and a smart DVD player.  I didn't really care about that since my main focus on the TV was picture quality and that's were this TV shines.So if you are patient and willing to customize the settings a bit, you will have a TV with an amazing picture quality.  With it's price point, it is the best value among the Samsung TVs.", "Date": "March 12, 2013"}, {"Title": "Stay Away from Smart TV's", "Author": "Don", "ReviewID": "RIEK4BBAS6UI6", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "For a \"Smart TV\" it's actually kind of dumb lol. I was happy with this television for the first few days until I started noticing the major flaws. For starters the Smart concept is a complete failure and if that is your main motivation for this purchase then I would hold off if I were you until they've perfected the design. The Amazon Prime video app causes the remote control to be ineffective unless you're standing 2-3 feet in front of it. It's weird it's almost like the television is so busy it cannot read the remote while playing an Amazon video. Also the remote control as a controller for the internet browser is a joke. Then again the browser is a joke so I guess it's a moot point. Today for the first time an error message popped up saying \"ERROR_MODEL_BLIND\" which renders the whole Smart hub inoperable. From my internet research people say that it's Samsung updating their servers the only problem with that is that annoying message pops up every 5 minutes or so and you virtually can't do anything. Supposedly this will fix itself but I'm not willing to have my t.v. inoperable for hours because of updates randomly. The television was shipped with a few dead pixels which is not that big of a deal and hardly noticeable but one would think for that price everything would be squared away. I have also noticed that when the screen is black there is noticeable clouding in the picture. I'm not a \"pictophile\" so this sort of stuff isn't a deal breaker for me.The picture quality is great when you have the right configuration and the sound is nothing to call home about. All and all for the price there are way to many problems with this television to make it worth it. It seems most of the problems stem from the SMART capabilities (or lack thereof). Needless to say I'm returning this and opting for the same model minus the SMART concept. It's a shame because I had real hope for this television.", "Date": "March 3, 2013"}, {"Title": "Great TV!

Especially if coming a from Vizio TV.", "Author": "Nate Brooks", "ReviewID": "R1J8SGVQPTHREH", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "For starters, the aesthetics of this TV is so modern and chic! The silver thin frame and accompanying stand instantly lets you know you have a quality TV. And for me, this was my very first Samsung TV. I had a complete 3D Smart TV from Vizio which had great picture quality, (or so I had PRIMITIVELY thought), BUT the UN46ES7100F takes the cake without a doubt! I didn't realize there was such a VAST, NOTICEABLE difference in picture quality upgrading to this LED TV from being a Vizio TV owner. Like all more expensive products, I assumed Samsung's High End TVs really didn't offer much besides its name. I now know how untrue that is.The UN46ES7100F outperformed all my expectations in every avenue, AFTER I took the time to familiarize myself with the ins and out of this TV, the settings, and Samsung's Smart Hub and other technologies. Having never owned a Samsung TV of any kind before, it's definitely a learning curve, that is FUN to endeavor on. Once I quirked everything to my liking, and set up HD sources like my PS3, I really was in awe of what I had recieved in my bedroom. The sound quality of this TV I also quirked to the setting of Amplify on the TV. The gives the sound almost a surround sound effect, and makes the sound on par with the visuals this TV can produce. Some people claim the sound is awful on this set, but its just not true. It's weird, because at first I did think the sound was very weak, until I played with the sound settings, and now the TV's sound is VERY STRONG, especially if plan on using this as a bedroom set TV like I am.But the best thing about this TV it's essentially future proof, well for the foreseeable future at least. Its has EVERYTHING you could want, and more that you can buy to accessorize it to be even more capable. I purchased the Samsung Smart Keyboard Remote, (THE NEWEST EDITION), as an example that only makes the UN46ES7100F a breeze to control.BUT I haven't told you why I\"m really impressed by this TV. I bought it from Buy Squad who sold it to me for under $900 BRAND NEW due to a Vizio TV I had order from them that wasn't in stock that I had paid them $894 for, even though they thought it was. So I was waiting weeks for a Vizio TV on backorder, and the sales representative at Buy Squad insisted that I take this TV since it had everything (AND WAY MORE) that I wanted in the inferior Vizio model I had ordered, but was a vastly SUPERIOR TV. It was their last in stock model of this U46ES7100F and it was just setting brand new in their warehouse, and they wanted to make my otherwise bad shopping experience a successful one. This TV completely made everything alright. Blew my mind, and was was better than Vizio M3D470KD I had I originally tried to order. The 3D is also better than Vizio as well.

I usually find the \"smart\" features to be lacking and barely use them however on this TV I actually use netflix, Amazon Prime streaming, Vudu, and even the sports app.  There are plenty of apps to add to round out this feature set.  It is by far the most useful \"smart\" functions in any other TV I have owned or used.I was worried about the bezel being silver but you can hardly see it.  One reason is that the bezel is really small all the way around and the other is that you almost have to be looking at the side of the TV to see it.  Looking directly at the screen I wouldn't know it was a silver bezel.  If you're looking at the screen directly the bezel looks black and only the sides are silver.  I was a little hesitant about this since I love my black TVs to match all my other electronics.  The picture quality is excellent.I just upgraded from an LG 42\" that I also really liked but this is miles ahead of that (it's also a 2 year old LG model).  The old TV had smart features but they weren't as easy to use so I barely used them.  I now use the ones on this Samsung and won't consider any other brands for a while.I can't comment on the built in speakers as I run a Yamaha soundbar with it as I expect TV speakers to not be very good.  I look at it in terms of I'm buying the TV for picture quality and the features it comes with and not the speakers.  This is a common problem ever since the switch to flatscreens.I love that the bezel is .2 inches and even better the whole TV is 1.2 inches thick from the top to the bottom if you are looking at it from the side.  I've seen a lot of TV's that start out that way and then get larger towards the bottom of the back.3D is good but not why I bought the TV.  It generally gives me a headache however these are active glasses and seem to cut that down a bit, meaning I can watch it longer than passive systems.  It's cool to be able to show people the free 3D content in the apps so they can watch a music video to see what it's like and they generally enjoy it.  Excellent execution here for Samsung.Please let me know if you have any specific questions.  I know this was fairly short but a lot of people go into much more details.

Green", "ReviewID": "R2XF6FO7R4UT1U", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Overall, according to the specs, this is the perfect TV for me. But there are a couple of problems:1. The much-vaunted 2D-to-3D conversion feature (which I LOVE, by the way), does NOT WORK on content that you access through the Smart Hub, except for the \"Explore 3D\" app on the top bar. That means that if you get the Netflix app on the Samsung TV, then go to the Netflix app to watch something, and press the 3D button on your remote... nothing happens.After driving myself crazy for the better part of an hour trying to make it work, I had to go online and talk to a Samsung tech to find out that the TV was designed not to show 3D on the Smart Hub apps. And it turns out he didn't know that either until he asked his own tech consultant.The good news is that if you access your content (such as Netflix) through another device connected to the TV, such as a Roku box or a game console, the 3D effect works just fine. But, really, guys, come on. This is a 3D TV. Shouldn't the 3D effect work on the TV's own features?2. Dead and dull pixels. I'm already on my second replacement TV in less than a month because the first one had a dead pixel in the center of the screen. My replacement arrived yesterday, and guess what: dull pixels. Just one or two, and off to one side, but still distracting, and not really acceptable for a TV that's this high-end.If you're in the market for a TV like this in the first place, and you're willing to spend what it costs to get it, then by definition the visuals are really important to you. Dead and dull pixels shouldn't get past QA on a product like this.Other than that, this is a wonderful device. The high-gloss screen is not as much of a drawback as I thought it was going to be, but if it bothers you, you can get a matte stick-on film here:[...]When it's off it's a beautiful sculptural piece, and when it's on the picture is clear and smooth and crisp, so much so that it looks almost 3D even without the built-in 3D effect. My last TV was exactly the same size and also a 1080p, and the picture on this one is so much better that it looks almost like different technology.The web browser seems fast enough to me, and works fine with the low-end Logitech wireless Bluetooth keyboard I have. There are some fun games available free in the Samsung Apps (just don't expect 3D!), and I'm really enjoying the Smart TV features.The sound on the TV is fine for me, but I'm not a sound geek; if you are, then it seems there's a sound bar available that will give you what you want. CAUTION: the volume is significantly decreased when you switch to an external input device or an app on the Smart Hub. I don't know why this should happen, but it does. It's not a defect; it just seems to be the way the TV works.I decided on this model because I hear online that Samsung hasn't gotten all the bugs out of its voice and gesture control; people are saying that whenever they go to pick up a coffee cup or something, the TV sees the motion and goes off half-cocked trying to execute weird commands. And the highest-end model, the 8000, not only does that but also doesn't even swivel, which for me is a deal-breaker. I wanted the 3D effect and the Smart TV features and the microdimming, but I didn't want a hysterical device falling all over itself every time I sneezed.The 7100 is perfect on paper.

So, I will probably sell this one in two years and get me a new one. Sony has better flesh tones and better \"latitude\" or contrast; in order to achieve the same quality on a Samsung TV one really needs to tweak the settings.Pros: the screen is glossy yet it is hardly as glossy as those old ones. Samsung has clearly developed some magic formula because it feels like a matte screen but without all the annoying light dispersion of a matte screen. I live in a bright space and this TV works just fine. This and the 3D mode is the reason I purchase this model. There is an App that turns your iPad into a remote control, it is pretty cool because you can see the buttons in the dark.Cons: the so called 2D-3D conversion only works 2% of the time.

There is an obvious cloud ghosting that only appears when the screen is 99% dark, sort of looks like the milky way in a dark night.The biggest con is not the TV itself but the design of the active 3D glasses. The lenses reflect the light coming from behind your head, they are a bit too small too.

So, the decision on the Hz's (60 vs. 120 vs. 240) was an easy one for us:  We went with the 240 Hz and movement is precise and very sharp and we are pleased with that.After those major decisions were made, we just compared \"apples-to-apples\" features of all the major brands.  Samsung came out the winner because it just seemed so much brighter and sharper than the others.The clincher was whether our older 3-2-1 Bose surround sound system would be compatible--and it is.We also got a wall mount so our very intelligent cats wouldn't be able to try to sit on top of the TV and try to watch the images upside down....Since the old TV is still working, we moved it to another room for the cats' enjoyment.We're happy with this model.", "Date": "December 2, 2012"}, {"Title": "Very satisfied", "Author": "Julio", "ReviewID": "RBQ7R9Y0HRS2", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "TV is sleek and sexy.

I've always been a fan of Sony but the Samsung picture quality on this set is a huge leap forward from the Sony picture.  The added detail is amazing although I can see where it could be a bit distracting and I believe this is where some people mention the \"soap opera effect.\"  I'd describe it more as being like you're in the studio audience of some shows.  Additionally, the 3D content is simply stunning.  3D on the Sony was good but the Samsung is really flawless looking.  Also the Samsung glasses are much more comfortable than Sony's and only about 1/4 of the weight.The only other item to watch for, as some other reviews have mentioned, is that non hi-def programming really looks poor on this TV.  I have DirecTv so it isn't really an issue for me but if you are using a service with a lot of standard defition I'd wait to upgrade or upgrade or plan on upgrading your TV service.As for standard features this TV is loaded.  3 HDMI ports, Samsung apps including Netflix, Amazon video and cloud player, Pandora, etc. it really goes on and on.  Built in Wifi, and several different picture modes to match to your preferences.  The built in speakers are okay but not great, but what do you expect in a TV this thin.Also worth mentioning this TV is RVU compliant.  For those not familiar, RVU is a standard between DirecTV and Samsung that allows you to watch tv without a set-top box.  I haven't had the chance to test this yet but I will be using it to connect to DirecTV's new whole home DVR \"Genie.\"  This will give me the ability to access the Genie in another room and all of it's content from the Samsung TV alone.  It should be a great feature and can't wait to try it out.Finally, I was a little concerned buying this TV through Amazon simply because of the shipping.  Bottom line, don't be.  The TV came through without a scratch and the delivery people brought it in the house, set it up right where we wanted it and then hauled the box and packing material away.  It was as simple a process as you could hope for.If you are looking for a new TV I highly recommend the Samsung UN55ES7100, I can't imagine anyone not loving this TV.", "Date": "February 1, 2013"}, {"Title": "Amazing Picture Quality!", "Author": "Brent Sayers", "ReviewID": "R2T7YJ3G18OA7G", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "PROS:I cant say enough about the quality of the picture on this TV.

It's slim. it's sleek. It's beautiful. Despite the issues, if I had to do it all over again I would still buy this TV.I debated on whether to get the 55\" or the 60\", and despite the slightly fatter black border on the 60\" (something they don't tell you in the specs) it's still a better choice if you have the space for it. My father got the 55\" and it's also an extremely beautiful image with a slightly thinner border around the screen, but anything larger wouldn't have fit in the space he had for it. If you want the thinner border, get the 55\".Ok, you know it's a great TV, so lets just get to the issues/gripes with it:It was flawless right out of the box, but developed a dead pixel cluster soon after. A cluster of 8 dead pixels or so that left a black hole with a pinkish halo around it. The panel had to be replaced and now thankfully the new one has no dead pixels. Hopefully that lasts.Samsung replaced the panel free of charge under the warranty, and did so in just over 1 week from the request for service. The repair guys left hand prints all over the edges of the screen which even after cleaning off with the supplied cloth seem to reappear. After multiple cleanings they finally seem to be nearly gone.The built in web browser does not handle flash content well at all. Trying to watch shows on comedycentral.com or teamcoco.com simply does not work. Hopefully a software upgrade will fix this in the future.The smart TV screen with the underwater background will randomly flash on to the screen for a second (like some kind of subliminal message) out of no where when nothing is pressed on the remote. This is particularly annoying during a movie. Even the technicians who replaced my screen observed this and had no explanation for it. The problem did not resolve with a software upgrade either. In fact I don't think it occurred until I did the software upgrade and of course there is no way to downgrade the software.There is an irregular pattern of spots of a ghost like white haze on dark/black backgrounds which becomes more prominent after the TV has been left on for long periods of time. I have yet to play with the display features to see if I can eliminate this effect. The effect is not visible on brighter images, only dark/black scenes, particularly during movie credits.It doesn't want to find content on my wireless network hard drive connected to my router despite my bluray player having no issues with it at all.3D content doesn't always seem to work well and there seem to be moments where the glasses and TV are not synchronous. The result is an effect like double vision. For the most part it looks pretty awesome though and it was a feature well worth having.Those were my issues and if any of that bothers you bad enough to not get the TV, then you probably weren't going to get one anyway.

It is not much different than first time turning on a laptop or Smart phone.Then, it paired without any complaints with both my HTC one and my wife's S4 without any complaint. In fact, my friend brought over an iPhone just to see if Apple plays well with Samsung here, and it did! All you have to do is to search for \"Samsung smart\" in any app store for all the great free apps.Finally, cough up a few bucks for a  few extra apps, and your world will become perfect.BTW, although getting a wireless keyboard may seem like a good idea, since the on screen keyboard is annoying, you shouldn't bother about that if you have a smart phone.=====Verdict:Best smart TV and Best value.

Since the set was newly released, I was unable to find any reviews online. I figured I would give it a shot and placed my order with Amazon around the end of May. The set arrived and upon unboxing the unit, I was extremely impressed with the aesthetics of the television; it was exactly what I was looking for in terms of a minimalist design. Unfortunately, that's about the only thing this TV has going for it. The picture out of the box was just awful, but that's to be expected from standard settings. I spent a significant amount of time going through multiple methods of calibration but ultimately found that the television was clearly unable to produce a high quality picture. The television appeared grainy, washed out, flat and lacked the detail and refinement one would expect for a television in this price range. I attempted to use multiple sources with the television to see if I could attain any improvements in PQ. This included a DirecTV HD receiver, PS3 (+BD movie) and Xbox 360; all sources produced the same low quality, grainy, washed out picture.Back in January, I purchased a Samsung UN40D5550 series TV (2011) that was priced around $750. The 5550 produced a much higher quality picture out of the box than the one produced by endless amount of tinkering on the 7100 set. I also have a UN55C7000 series TV from 2010, which produces an absolutely beautiful picture in comparison with the 2012 7100 series. Samsung should be absolutely ashamed of themselves producing such low quality televisions and charging top dollar for them. Apparently they feel they can cut corners with their 2012 products in order to improve their bottom line. Reviews across the ES 8000, 7000 and 6000 series have all been subpar at best; the 2012 models present serious quality control issues and bottom barrel engineering designs. I won't even get into clouding, flashlighting, uniformity, horrible smart tv interface and privacy issues associated with higher end displays (camera/mic always on). My advice would be to stay as far away from these models as possible.I returned the television to Amazon after a week of use because watching the set made me absolutely miserable. As always, Amazon provided top notch customer service and I wouldn't hesitate to order another television from them again. Samsung really has declined in quality this year. I will mention that it really bothers me that all of their 2012 sets only include 3 HDMI ports. Previous models from 2010 and 2011 include 4 HDMI ports on televisions costing half as much as the 2012 7100 series. This is just another example of how Samsung has cut costs all at the expense of the consumer. I will be waiting until the 2013 models are released to consider purchasing another set.

The 6 year old Sony still has a very good picture, but its not even in the same league as the 7100 series.  I had to tweak the picture settings a little as it will come blazing if you use the Dynamic setting, I went with Standard and adjusted it a little.  The micro dimming allows for very deep black levels, especially compared to the 6000 series.  I bought mine at HH Gregg (on sale) and they had a 6000 next to the 7000/8000's and you could easily see the darker blacks in the higher end sets.The sound is what you'd expect, fine for regular TV watching but a sound bar is advised.The Smart content is not too impressive to me.

The biggest plus point is the bright picture and it's quality. I'm very please with how this TV looks and works. As a native European, I use this TV a lot to watch playback that's available as streaming media through the internet. For this reason I already own a 32 inch Sony Google smart TV (that's now 2/3 years old) but decided to go Samsung this time. Compared to the Google TV, There are a few points that did not impress me:-1- Bad sound. I placed the TV in a two story great room and the build-in speakers just didn't pull it, there's no deep sounds. So I got a Samsung sound bar and things are working once again. I did pick up a samsung brand soundbar because I do not like 5 remote controlls on my table and the Samsung brand nicely integrates with my existing Tv remote (they use technology called \"anynet\" that takes a DMI and optic cable between TV and soundbar but works pretty nice!-2- Smart TV remote. Navigating around using the remote is horrible. The mouse movement is controlled either by selecting up and down arrows (which works only half the time) or by a mode that jumps between selectable boxes/areas within the browser screen. This mode works fairly well but I found myself switchign between modes a lot because it does not recognize selectable buttons within a flash window o nthe screen. This remote truly makes the smart part unusable so I \"fixed\" this by purchasing a bleutooth Logitech keyboard/mouse, I was very disappointed that this TV required this extra equipment. In comparison, my Sony Google TV has has the most engenius remote that looks a bit like a game controller but it is very simple and actually functional. I had expected same or better from a Samsung Smart TV that is supposedly top of the line and was designed years afterwards! Another tip, if you have a Android smartphone, the remote control application works well with the TV as well (does suck dry the battery pretty quick though).-3- Smarthub. When you own a Google TV, you feel really \"trapped\" with this \"smart\" tv. The smarthub is your menu from where you will install and launch applications but Samsung keeps this area very controlled and I find the selection of available appliactions laughable. The smarthub by itself is bad as well, there are junk applications on the main screen that you cannot move or remove so you are forced  to \"work around them\" every time you access the smarthub to get to the applications that you do want to use. Unneccesary annoying Samsung, on my Google TV I am able to fully customize the screens and run many smartphone apps by backing these application up and then install them as APK files. The apps for the Google TV are also much more usable, for instance I was able to purchase (like $3.-) a media player that allows me to play MKV movie files, on the Samsung TV, this file type simply cannot be played.-4- Smart is slow. Whenever you access the smarthub and at times when you launch applications from the smarthub, it freezes and takes 20/30 seconds to start the application. I'm not exactly sure what's causing this, I do not experience anything like this with the Google TV.So the bottom line, I love the Samsung for it's design and bright screen. Be prepared to find an alternative solutino for addressing the sound quality and if you are looking for the smart in this smart TV you will find yourself back at the store for a remote alternative and will have to deal with the fact that Samsung decided that you need a \"big daddy\" who has figured out and locked down what's best for you when you access apps.", "Date": "April 3, 2013"}, {"Title": "Very happy with the choice we made.", "Author": "Marco Stracciari", "ReviewID": "RONRGHYTAVH1X", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "This tv is pretty awesome.

I have not been able to view or listen to TV shows/internet radio with samsungs browser. Some work but very few. So... Minus the browser this TV could be replaced with a \"dumb\" TV and some sort of device that provides streaming content and a browser. Such as a home theater computer etc.. To me the browser has no worth and will be connecting a pc the TV for internet browsing.One other note: I believe other brands may have the same issue. i.e. the browser does not work. I have not verified this but buyer beware. If you really want a browser in your TV I would look to a google TV. This TV's browser may have a chance of actually working....(Still no change with the browser as to 12/9/2012. It still does not work for me.)In addition streaming 3D content seems to be just starting to be available.  VUDU has some but it is very limited in my opinion. So if you want 3D this may be a challenge unless you want to rent/buy disks from your local store or from Amazon.. This is a dissapointment to me but not unexpected.Also the allshare function does not work very well. It is much better to use a home theater computer for this function.Perhaps samsung will correct these problems but I would expect them to do it on the next models coming out. Not this one.Over all ratings1) The picture and 3D look great (3D trailers I have seen) : 5 stars.2) Streaming works well and looks good (not much to pick from in 3D): 5 stars.3) Reliablity: unknown but my previous lcd samsung failed in 6 years: 2 stars4) The browser does not work: 0 stars5) All share looks unfinished and does not work well: 0 stars6) Design: 5 starsSo it gets 2.8 stars. I am considering returing this TV for a dumb one.. Unfortunately I have not found many 3D TVs that are dumb and provide the other specs I desire: Fast refresh rate  >= 240 Hz, great picture quality, high reliability, slim design. The UN55EH6070 may be an option if I am willing to compromise on refresh rate, design and picture quality.. And you get a samsung 3D blue ray player with it so it is as smart the the 7100 (minus the browser/allshare which is no big loss)! Finally you can add a computer to the 6070 setup make it smarter than the 7100 for the same price as the 7100.Additional Posting (Regarding Promotions): 11/10/2012:When I purchased this TV there was a $400 amazon gift card promotion see: http://www.amazon.com/gp/feature.html?ie=UTF8&docId;=1000834631I have yet to receive this and I have one day left to return the TV (11/11). I have been getting no where with amazons customer service whom I contacted about this on 11/4 and still no answer from them as to whether I will be receiving the gift card.The take away is: Make sure you verify any promotion with amazon when buying. I am. And will think twice about buying from amazon again.Additional Posting (Also promo releated) 12/9/2012Amazon came through with my gift card! But the people working in customer service had nothing to to with it and were completely useless.. They seem to be in the dark when it comes to like the one I took advantage of promotions..", "Date": "October 20, 2012"}, {"Title": "Keyboard", "Author": "ejrokks", "ReviewID": "R275LHK3W1TVTD", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "The accessory guide lists a remote keyboard for this tv which will not work with it according to Samsung Tech reps.The VG-KBD1000 is not a US compatible product according to Samsung. The model VG-KBD1500 will only work with 7500 series and up tv's. I am disgusted with this. The main reason for buying this tv was to access YOUTUBE and other APPS with a wireless keyboard. Using the remote for this takes forever and the exit button is to close to the scroll arrows which means that if you miss the arrow in a dark room and hit the exit button, guess what? start over.THE WIRELESS KEYBOARD DOES NOT OPERATE INSIDE THE YOUTUBE APP.
