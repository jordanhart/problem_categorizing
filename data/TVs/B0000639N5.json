{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Look\ufffds good but poor TV resolution", "Author": null, "ReviewID": "R5OOFYU8YZN3P", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I bought this TV about five days ago.  I was the highest cost unit in the store so I expected video quality at least as good as my old Sony TV.  However the picture is fuzzy with high degrees of pixalization.  For small graphics the pixalization causes actual \"sparkling\".  After watching the history channel where they place small graphic on the lower right hand corner throughout the program I noticed that I was drawn to the graphic more than the actual show.  I am going to get a 4:3 model or wait for the new generation of LCD with 3:2 drop-down and better conversion circuitry.", "Date": "October 29, 2003"}, {"Title": "CATV says \"WOW!\"", "Author": null, "ReviewID": "R38MS3OJPZLBT1", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "The compact size of this TV allows it to fit comfortably on the top shelf of a bookshelf.  The picture is as clear as one can get without investing a whole lot more.
