Third, do yourself a favor and buy the new ps3 to play your movies on..even if you don't need a game system.It has wireless networking, it's down to 299 and it will display all your photos and music on your tv, it's like having a 120gig hard drive hooked up to your tv with blueray capability.  I have been looking for a year for the right tv and i knew thiswas it.  The picture is fully backlit, instead of edgelit like the Samsung, that makes a big difference in the details.  Theother thing is that the picture is absolutely stunning.  The LED technology will save you money over plasmas and last longer...approximately 7-15 years longer.  It doesn't run as hot as plasmas, the electricity cost you a lot less, there's no fear of burn in,the picture is unbelievable and there's several places to use it as a computer monitor.  Pertaining to other people's commentsabout the power light, it actually blends into the background when you're watching tv or a movie, it's not bothersome at all, butin the case that it does bother you really bad, hey, just get a sharpie, lol.  Some of you reading this are wondering what tv tobuy.  If you do your research, consumer reports, cnet and all those, they will tell you this is one of the best in the 55\" category.The contrast ratio is 2,000,000 to 1, the automotion ms response time is 4 or less because of the 240 hz, not as fast as a plasma but how many people were complaining when there lcd's were just 120 hz...no one was.  Anyway, good luck with your decision but at the endof the day if you buy this tv, you'll be happy.", "Date": "September 30, 2009"}, {"Title": "Outstanding LCD TV with LED Backlighting", "Author": "James Aldridge", "ReviewID": "R2IM7C23X0X4BO", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I bought this TV from our local BestBuy. I had been looking at the Samsung edge-lit LED/LCD line. The LG TV rep happened to be at the Fort Worth store, and he was really helpful. I've had the TV now for three four days, and I couldn't be happier.The TV is used in a well-lit living area, making the matte screen useful. I have looked at a LOT of TVs, and if you're worried about the matte screen diminishing picture quality, don't be. It kills reflections very effectively. The picture is gorgeous, regardless of source (LG BD390 Blu-ray player and a Dish Network 722 receiver in my case). Beautiful color, black blacks. Try the THX picture mode - it looks VERY realistic. My mom had a Panasonic plasma TV, and this is a better picture.Worth buying just for the futuristic standby/on power light; can be disabled if you're not as fond of it as I am.The sound/lip synch issue with HDMI feeds has gotten a lot of attention. Using the TV audio, I had an initial problem with the Dish receiver till I tweaked the receiver's settings. Same with BD390 player. Now all is well with either HDMI TV audio or external audio. I do think HD audio, especially with HDMI feeds, are problematic sometimes (too often). I understand that a solution is coming in the form of some sort of forced sync between HDMI audio and video in the HDMI standard. Hope so. With external audio, an audio delay box might be useful.I am sitting here watching the Dish HD NBC Today show feed. It's stunning. I am a biologist, and I recently watched the Blu-ray version of Planet Earth. It nearly brought me to tears, it was so gorgeous.Buy and enjoy!", "Date": "August 11, 2009"}, {"Title": "Lots of Research, very Satisfied", "Author": "M. Fowler", "ReviewID": "REZ0PENJNM717", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "First, I did a lot of research about the LCD and LED TV's, trying to find the best one for me. Without looking at price, it came down to 2 sets, the LG55LH90 and the Samsung UN55B8500. I chose the former because of the picture quality. Boy, am I glad I did! We're sitting here watching the Winter Olympics and it's like we're there!  The Food Network even gets my stomach growling.In addition, I want to cut down on my energy usage which helps the environment and saves me money. However, I want to do it all without sacrificing my lifestyle. LED's are supposed to use less energy than LCD's. On the LCD monitors you can feel how much heat it generates, whereas the LG puts off very little heat. With the LG55, the Dish Network, and the sound system all up and running, this whole unit is only drawing 224 watts of electricity...sweet! (I actually measured it with a \"Kill-a-Watt meter)Below are the additional items that I purchased along with their prices and the reasons I purchased them:LGLH90-Purchased through Amazon - $1995.00 Almost bought at Best Buy, but price was higher, and even though they offered to match the price, they still would have charged sales tax.Mediabridge Ultra Series HDMI Cable through Amazon - $9.99 Read about the Lip-sync issues and the problems people were having. There were comments about \"making sure you get a high quality\" cable. I also read where the \"Monster Cable\" was overhyped. Called Best Buy for their opinion and guess what, they said to be sure to buy the $100.00 Monster Cable...wonder why? So I based my decision on the cable's certification.  It is certified at \"Version 1.3 Category 2\" which is the same as the \"Monster Cable\" at 1/10th the price. It performs perfectly, with no lip-sync problems.Sony HTCT100 Sound Bar through Amazon - It appears all large screen monitors sound systems are realitively limited to what sound they can produce. This system sounds beautiful to me...it's like we're at the movies! What I like about LG TV, is you can turn it off(when you have the Sound Bar on). Also, if you have just the LG sound on(sound bar off), the LG has an option that makes the sound at the same level, from channel to channel, and even commercials. Great feature when someone in another room is trying to sleep.  I wish the sound bar had this feature!SquareTrade 3-year TV Warranty through Amazon - $169.99 At Best Buy they wanted $450.00 for a 4-year warranty. Read all the customer feedback on SquareTrade and it seemed to be a great deal.Here's how I hooked it up:HDMI Cable - From DishNetwork box to LG HDMI inlet.Sound Bar - Opti-cable from Dishnetwork box to SoundbarHope you have as nice of an experience as I had!!!", "Date": "February 14, 2010"}, {"Title": "Lip synch issue with Cable TV Box", "Author": "Amazon Customer \"Tim\"", "ReviewID": "R2QS3W6FGYTXK4", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "Picture is excellent (5 stars).

When I connect it using HDMI 1.3b cable, the audio LAGs the video by about 1/2 second.  This is not the normal HDMI \"Lip Synch\" issue where audio comes before video.  My lip synch problem on this TV has audio coming after video.  If I use component connections instead of HDMI, then no audio problem at all.I tested the same Time Warner Cable TV box with the same HDMI cable on a Sony Bravia XBR LCD TV and there was no audio synch problem.I have contacted LG for problem resolution.

It is my understanding that this model & the 47\" version are discontinued, so if you are interested buy now before you have trouble finding one.  I paid $2K at BB on clearance last weekend (and had to check 4+ stores to find a new one instock).A few comments that may help other uses make a decision about this TV:Other customer reviews on this TV have mentioned a problem with the sound sync'ing.  I have not seen that at all (using a Comcast hd box).  I understand there is the ability to get a USB drive from the manufacturer to fix this problem should you encounter it.I liked this TV better than Samsung because it does NOT have a glossy screen.  That must be a preference thing.... some people think there's more depth of color with a high gloss screen.  I know I would HATE it because i would hate seeing lights, windows, movement in my living room, etc reflected back at me as if the TV is part mirror. If you don't already know what I am talking about you should go to a store & look at various TVs in person and decide whether you want a glossy screen. Only LG, Sony and Toshiba have no-gloss screens.  All Samsungs I saw have them.The LED-LCD technology adds a definite depth of color to this TV beyond what any other LCD has (based on my research & comparable viewing against other TVs).  I really love the picture quality of this set, and I have not even explored customizing the picture settings yet.  The default setting bring in a picture so clear and deep I feel like I could reach into the screen.Sound quality is reasonable.  Remote & controls are also fine.  The stand swivels (somewhat).  Viewing the TV from an angle is just fine imo. The TV setup was extremely easy, the screen is already connected to the stand, you just have to lift the box off & get rid of styrafoam and put it in place.The negatives imo.... I'm not crazy about the size of the frame and the stand on this model.  The TV is 38 inches tall in total, but the bottom 9 inches of that are the stand plus the bottom frame of the TV....leaving the actual screen size to be 27 inches tall (2 inches top frame).  It bothers me b/c this TV is so tall it eliminates my ability to use the bridge on my entertainment center to display objects and also causes the TV to sit higher then i would want.I would highly recommend this TV....Get one while you still can!!Another note..Do NOT buy expensive HDMI cables or packages.  BB tried to sell me a Monster cable + powerstrip + cleaner for $200 and I laughed at them.  After doing research it is my understanding that there is no reason to pay to upgrade that cable;  I used the free one Comcast gave me and it seems great!", "Date": "March 9, 2010"}, {"Title": "Amazing TV", "Author": "MrPlus \"MrPlus\"", "ReviewID": "R251QUQSR79M8F", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I have been watching LED LCD TV's for some time, and was patiently waiting for a local retailer to bring this in store so I could see it.

We looked at the 9000 series Samsung, the Toshiba and the LG. All TVs looked great. Samsung has so many 'features' that we wouldn't use that it just looked overpriced. Plus, as Samsung is 'edge-lit' LED, you can see the 'halo' on dark or black-out scenes. Left us with the Toshiba and LG. We're big fans of Toshiba TVs (we own 3, two LEDs and one DLP) and LG appliances (microwave, washer, dryer, cell phones, etc.) so it really boiled down to quality and value. Both looked great, but the LG had a slight edge in sharpness. Motion looked great with both too. However, we got the LG on sale for $1999 (over $500 cheaper than Toshiba) so that sealed the deal. No regrets! Looks great, both in HD and SD (all video run through our Onkyo TX-SR805 AV receiver). Don't really use the speakers, but they sound OK.

HDTV looks great and when I put on a blu-ray disk (especially transformers and iron man) the picture is incredible.  I have a bright room with lots of windows but that's no problem for this TV.  I haven't had a single issue with the sound but I have comcast cable and not Time Warner.  Seems like the problem others are having with sound sync is more with Time Warner cable than with this TV.  I also thought the sound coming from the TV speakers was pretty good quality.  You can't expect much from TV speakers these days and I thought the LG's were better than my Samsung.  However, since then I have a full surround system installed so I don't use the TV speakers anymore.  If you're looking for the best TV picture in an LCD model you can't beat this TV.  Samsung and Sony can't seem to produce a full backlit LED TV without chargin $1,000+ more than this TV. My only complaint would be that LG should lessen the width of the border.

I finally was ready to replace my 10 year old Hitachi 53\" in the huge monster black cabinet and wanted to make sure that that I was making the right choice of which new HD to buy. All the store employees knew me by name because I had been in so many times looking. I had pretty much settled on a Samsung 55\" and had even considered a 73\" DLP because of the bang for the buck in size. I was in Fry's and sales rep came up to me and said I have the deal for you. He told me about the LG55LH90 with 240Hz and the high rating it had received on C-NET. He said they only had one in stock in the back room and that The LG rep had just been there and they had been authorized to offer it at a promo price of $1799.00 plus a free LG Blu-ray player. I was a little leary because I was not that familiar with LG brand. I asked if I could think about it and come back next day and he said that price was a one time promo and he guaranteed I would love the TV. Boy was he right! This TV has the most awesome picture I have ever seen. I watch the same old TV shows that I have been watching for years and never knew how they should really look in HD. It's like looking out a window, and sports, you feel as though you can reach out and touch the grass blades on the football field. Movies with the THX are unreal. As for the lip-sync issues I've read about I have none. I went online and bought Monster M1000 HDMI cables for $24.00 each instead of the $199.00 you pay in stores and have hooked up to Time Warner HD-DVR box and sound is perfect. So I guess cables do make a difference. I am very,very happy I went with this TV and especially at the price I paid as the prices now are anywhere from $2500 to $2900. But at any price it out performs any other TV I have seen and the matte screen eliminates most all glare in a bright room.

But before Best Buy could deliver the Samsung I changed my mind and went with my first choice the LG55LH90 and I am glad I did. I'm sure the Samsung is a good tv as well but the LG55LH90 impressed the heck out of me. I have a bright room and the LED backlighting is great.

In this case I went out to buy a ps3 and then bought the most rigorous benchmark for the t.v., Planet Earth in Blu-Ray. The picture I must say was beautiful, probably the best I've seen. However once the picture began to move the blossoming and haloing on this set was absolutely atrocious.To describe blossoming in a few few words it's when an object moves across the screen, especially if it's well lit, you will see a \"shadow\" of pixels around it. It's essentially a blurry mess around the stalking arctic fox as it runs across the grassy meadow that radiates about a half a centimeter in every direction around the fox. This only occurs when the motion flow is on. The \"TruMotion\" setting sucks frankly speaking. I will say though that when you turn the motion flow off, not only do movies (I tested The Hulk and 300) look like movies they look pretty darn good but not smoothed out as they claim. However this advertised trumotion technology that you evidently pay extra for is useless.I digress, The motion flow technology does indeed look incredible on slow moving landscapes and slower action. But once Edward Norton starts running across the screen any beauty is lost.So I ask if anyone else is having this problem. Test it, get a blu-ray player, get a movie with some fast action, turn the trumotion all the way up (it's in the advanced picture settings), and examine any fast moving objects.

Our TV is in a room with a significant amount of light coming through windows, and there is no problem viewing the picture.  This is in direct contrast to a Sony we purchased last year that had a lot of washout in a bright room.  As advertised, the backlighting in this LG makes the difference.  The TV is also on a swivel base so you can direct it to different areas of the room.  I have not found that I have needed to utilize this feature much because the off-angle viewing is excellent.

Had it for about a month now and I love it. One thing I thought might be a little better is the THX mode, it only makes the picture look dark and blurry. It's only to be used with movies. Not really for video games or anything else. The energy saving mode only works with a few settings, I mostly leave it on 75% or 100 because otherwise it looks like the center is brighter than the edges such as when white text is on a black screen. The outter text is dimmer while the center is bright.The 240Hz motion blur is excellent, just adjust the settings to make it maximum instead of minimum. The sound is great, compared to my dad's 55inch Samsung, this has alot more depth, surround and bass. I was expecting to be blown away by the 2M:1 contrast ratio. But again compared to my dads 100,000:1 Samsung, there isnt THAT much of a difference. A little yes.The remote isn't very ideal, it gets fingerprinted and greasy VERY easily and is pretty much impossible to get off. The moment I looked at it brand new I thought 'wow, pretty remote'. 2mins later I was saying 'wow, ugly remote'. I love the LED lighting, the view is great from any angle in my house. Theres not too much of a glare from sunlight, only a hot spot but the screen doesnt reflect everything like some other LCDs or LEDs. On my dads samsung I can see everything being reflected and its really annoying. I love the look of the tv, so cant complain there. I was a little dissapointed when I saw there was no internet mode build into the TV as with samsung. I tried to connect an ethernet cord and found none. I just use my PS3 to browse the web.

I contacted LG on their website through the chat and they told me that it needs service. since I am so close to the expiration of my 1 year warranty (by about 2 weeks) they said that they could do a courtesy extended warranty.

Last night though, my husband and I were watching a movie and when we went to hit the input button to switch it back to tv nothing happened. both my dish remote and the original tv remote wouldn't control the tv at all. the only way I can get the remotes to do anything is if I put the remote right up to the sensor on the tv and hit the button a couple times. and when the tv does decide to accept the signal from the remotes, like with volume for example, when pressing the volume down it goes up instead. or vise versa. annoyed but hopefully I get that reciept soon so I can get it fixed!Part of me wanted to rate this as a different star rating.

I went in just looking, saw a sony that blew me away, the price blew me away too ($3,999) for a first gen LED. I was not in the market to spend that kind of money. The store staff showed me this LG. LG? hmmmm, not really a long standing company with any real track record that I had found. But, the tv was amazing in the store, and gave the Sony a run for its money, for Half the price. Problem, they did not have any more left, and at $1,999 I could see why. We thought about it for a week, I did my research, then went back and pulled the trigger. CNET gave this TV some real props and helped me decide ultimately. The old 61\" Panasonic that took up up a full wall and 3 feet of depth space was a good tv, but we wanted to be in the new millenia and get something that would match our new sectional.Three weeks later and the tv arrived! I was stoked. I even bought new furniture to house it along with the rest of my equipement, dusted off the old Denon receiver I have had for 15 years. Got rid of the old monolith 4:3 61\" tv and placed on the new furniture a 32\" flat panel to hold us over for the few days before the tv got here, even the old Denon was sounding great with the little tv. The delivery guys dropped it off. I got it ready to hang on the new center, hooked up the back, got ready to route the sound to the receiver and no out puts other than the digital optical sound out. PROBLEM. My denon is a great peice of equipment, albeit old and only Pro Logic equipped, but it was made before such inputs as HDMI and digital audio. Major disapointment!This is the one thing I did not consider or even check. So I am here to tell you, do your homework. If you are replacing older technology with new technology be sure this will work with your old periphial technology unless you plan on buy all new stuff.Otherwise, the tv is awesome. East to set up, great picture and Bluray is awesome on it. The sound is well diappointing compared to using a read amp and decent speakers. Fortunately I found a new Denon that is not breaking my bank, AVR 1709, that will do nicely. However, my little $2,000 TV has now cost me well over $3K to get the set delivered, calibrated (coming soon), new stand/center type deal, new Bluray (hey you cant have a kick a$$ tv without some kicka$$ input), and now a new receiver. I thought I would at least be able to send some old rca outs to the old Denon, but not with this tv. Many others can do it, so that was a curve ball.Bottom line, this tv is worth the price. Just be sure you have all the extras you need or plan to buy them to make this TV the true center piece it should be. I am glad I bought it, only disappointed that I cant make it sing the way I thought it would. That is the only reason I have to give it 4 stars instead of 5. I think the new TVs should accommodate the old technology and the new technology as well. Right now it is like having a Mustang, or Corvette sitting in the drive way that is stuck in 1st gear.
