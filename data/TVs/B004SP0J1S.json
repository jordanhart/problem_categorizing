However, it's 1080p is crystal clear, brilliant, and incredibly bright. The TV itself is pretty thin, and not too heavy.  I was frustrated with how dark it was, until I changed the \"Eco\" setting. With \"eco\" on, the TV adjusts its brightness to ambient light, but even if you go into brightness settings, you can't increase the max lamp brightness. You must turn this mode off, and only then will the lamps light up like they should. Now it's crisp, clear, bright, and even the audio sounds better!In addition, this has a USB port for playing MP3 files, and photo slideshows. However, the interface for the music player is downright archaic and borderline unusable.  Having to load MP3s and photos on a flash drive and use the interface provided to play the music on the USB port is a flat-out joke. You're better off grabbing an Apple TV or something to stream your music wirelessly to this TV.Pros:-- Fairly light-- Easy to set up-- Remote is good and simple-- Excellent picture quality-- 3 HDMI portsCons:-- Only 1 component and composite video input-- \"Eco\" mode on by default. Need to turn this off to get desired brightness.-- Audio quality of built-in speakers is kinda muddy. (A non-issue if you have your own separate speaker system.)-- Power cable WAY too short. (but I had an identical one on a different device in the house which was much longer, which worked. It's a standard power cable.)-- USB port music player and photo slideshow feature is functional but archaic, ugly, and difficult to use.", "Date": "November 25, 2011"}, {"Title": "very good.", "Author": "John Porter", "ReviewID": "RDEAQAKWJC9PH", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I gave this as A christmas present.
