{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Beautiful TV, Fabulous Pictures - like XBR9 except 240 Hz", "Author": "Daniel Kim", "ReviewID": "R310RUUFHM7RW", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "My Sony 52W5150 is a thing of beauty!  The pictures are fabulous and it looks great in the living room also.  My old 60 Hz Sharp 46 inch cannot compare to this TV in terms of deep blacks and motion picture quality.First, the pictures are amazing!  The blacks are so ridiculously black... my biggest pet peeve on a HDTV is the greyish black when there's supposed to be a black background on some older TV's.  You don't have that problem with this TV.  This TV has Bravia Engine 3 (Sony's latest video processor) and has a 120 Hz refresh rate.  Inbetween those two, the motion judder that I used to see on my old Sharp TV during fast action scenes in movies or sports are gone.  All I see is smoothe motion which is a thing of beauty.  Once you turn off the \"Vivid\" colors mode, the colors look real and true to life.  I just love it.  In fact, my wife told me how she noticed for the first time all the intricate details of the makeup on the TV news anchors' faces.  That's high picture quality.Second, it looks great in the room.  I love the Sony light that comes on on the bottom center of the bezel when the TV is on.  (In fairness, my wife hates it so be aware that all or most late model Sony HDTV's have this feature)  And it looks great whether it's on or not... showing the deep blacks and the rich colors.  It really does become the center of your family/living room entertainment.  Some prefer the touch of color from Samsung... I prefer the all black look of my TV.Finally, comparing the specs on this TV versus the top of the line Sony XBR9, there wasn't enough difference to pay the extra $500 premium.  Both TV's have the same contrast ratios (3,800 native, 100,000 dynamic).  For novices, the contrast ratio is a rough ratio of the brightness of the darkest color the TV is capable of versus the brightest color.  So the higher the number, the more capable the TV is in terms of reproducing a wide range of colors at a wide range of brightness.  They also look very similar, both use the latest Bravia 3 Engine video processor to produce their pictures, have the same # of HD ports, and allow for widgets & broadband access to Internet.The three major differences are the following: 1) 120 Hz vs. 240 Hz refresh rate, 2) 8 bit versus 10 bit panel, and 3) of course the $500 or so in price premium.  Frankly, my research into 120 Hz vs. 240 Hz refresh rates lead me to conclusion that most people can't really notice the difference.  People can notice the difference between 120 Hz and 60 Hz (as I pointed out earlier), but the 120 vs. 240 seems much more marginal.  I am not such a videophile that I will pay a serious premium for a marginal difference.  Then the 8 bit vs. the 10 bit panel is an even more dubious distinction.  8 bit panels allow for 17 million colors... the 10 bit panels allow a billion in theory....  But you don't really need it.  That's because no content source available right now (not blue ray, not HD broadcast, HD cable/satellite) can differentiate colors to that degree and no LCD panel can reproduce that many colors at once.  My advice is - save your money and buy the 10 bit panels when the content actually catches up.  Buying 10 bit panel right now could be like buying a 50 inch plasma TV in 2000 for like $20K when no real HD content sources were available to take advantage of the big screen & TV capability.The only thing this TV does not have is LED backlighting.  This TV and the XBR9 are Sony's best CCFL backlit LCD TV's.  Now the latest TV's have started to use LED backlighting technology to really hike up the contrast ratio to 1 million to 1 and beyond.  Sony's latest release XBR10 does this as do the Samsung B6000, B7000, B8000, and B8500 series TV's.  Those TV's are fabulous TV's, and they look so cool with their super thin form factor (Samsung's are 1.2 inches thick!).  But I am not prepared to pay double or even triple the cost of my W series to get a similar sized LED backlit LCD TV just yet.  Wait 3 years and the prices will be MUCH cheaper, since by then larger screen true LED TV's called OLED (not the LCD with LED backlighting TV's that are available now) will probably be more widely available.By the way, the Samsung TV most comparable to this TV is the Samsung 52B650.  Both are 120 Hz, near top of line TV's with CCFL backlighting.  I could have gone with either, but I ended up going with this TV because I got a great deal on it and because my sound system and blue ray player (PS3) are Sony products - hello Bravia Synch.  Some do think the picture quality on the Samsung is slightly better... but I found the differences to be virtually indiscernable to my eyes.  Can't go wrong with either as Samsung and Sony are, IMO, the two greatest LCD TV makers right now... but Samsung seems to be pulling ahead lately.Overall, fabulous TV... well worth the costs.  One of the best top tier, large screen size TV's available with CCFL backlighting.  LED backlighting is better, but it costs over double.  So for non-early adopters, this is the way to go.", "Date": "November 11, 2009"}, {"Title": "52 Sony Bravia W Series", "Author": "C. Newman", "ReviewID": "RTEYH49BV3JZC", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Great picture on this 52 inch Sony Bravia but the sound is average. It is noticeably thin so I guess the trade off is lack of big speakers to deliver great sound. I have it plugged into a Blu Ray HT system and I'm very happy with the purchase - sounds great.  The TV is very easy to use - easy setup -- and connects to the internet via ethernet cable.  I would have preferred that the TV wirelessly connect to the internet but that would be more $$$. I think that the Netflix widget which will be available in Oct-Nov 09 will end up being very useful -- the internet widgets all seem cute -- time will tell whether I really use them or not.", "Date": "October 29, 2009"}, {"Title": "Nice TV But Has Some Issues", "Author": "markabtex \"scifi addict\"", "ReviewID": "R6PL1UQ3JLAJA", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "This is a nice TV but it does have some important issues. First of all the clouding in dark scenes or \"flashlighting\" can be annoying and is a common defect on these TVs. Sony is aware of the issue and their only suggestion is to turn down the backlight and/or brightness. If you like a bright vibrant picture, you will not want to turn down either. The second issue is the sound. You would think that a product made by Sony would have above average sound quality. This TV has way below average sound. The speakers are mounted in the back of the TV which makes it sound like it's in a box. When you do try to turn up the sound to compensate, the speakers vibrate and distort. You will need to buy a sound bar speaker to get good sound. The good features of this TV are the vibrant colors of the picture and the internet capabilities. If I had to do it again, I would probably wait until the prices of the LED TVs come down but I would still buy a Sony since they have the best picture.", "Date": "March 3, 2010"}, {"Title": "Incredible Machine!", "Author": "Denis McCarthy", "ReviewID": "R17DGGZSEOPCUG", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Santa Claus brought this TV to our home on the 25th. I couldn't wait to power up the unit even though it was late in the evening after getting home from our annual Christmas gathering at my folks home. My previous unit was a Pioneer Elite 50\" second generation projection. Nice picture, really big and heavy, terrible off center view, but overall a nice tv. This thing just blows that old technology away. While shopping with Santa, I purchased a Sony BDP-N460 Blue-ray Disc player to go along with the new TV. I think this is a must if your are planning to move up to this level of picture quality. The Blue-ray player will up-convert your older DVD's to a HD signal, and the TV will indicate it is receiving a HD signal via a little LED on the front panel by the power \"on\" indicator. The picture is just stunning!Over the Holiday week I have enjoyed watching older Pixar movies such as Monsters Inc, as well as The Incredibles. I just couldn't ask for better picture quality! I do have to warn you though; once you see a Blue-ray movie on this tv, its over. You will only want to by Blue-rays from now on! Your jaw will surely drop when you watch Monsters Vs Aliens on this tv through a nice Blue-ray player.Another interesting feature that I have been playing with is the Bravia Internet Widgets. The TV has a LAN port on its back so you can connect it via a CAT5 cable to your high speed internet connection. I had to run out to BestBuy and pick up a ethernet switch to make all of this work... but it did work after making all of the connections to my router. When you push the Internet Widget button on the remote it will take you to a list of applications that you can apply to the tv such as the latest news or weather, or stock updates. Things like that. I thought that was kinda nice.I would recommend that you utilize the HDMI ports for all of your equipment if possible. This type of connection will offer you the highest possible quality thats currently available. And go with the middle to topend levels of quality with these cables. They are a bit costly though, but the quality of the picture and sound is incredible.I read the other reviews on the 5150, one reviewer indicated the sound was not as great as they had hoped. I really thought the sound was really good for the provided TV speakers. But really, if your going to buy this tv, you really need to set up a 5.1 or 7.1 sound system. I have mine running through a Denon AVR-3806 and then through seperate speakers. I believe this will give you the greatest enjoyment.Overall, I would highly recommend the Sony KDL-W52W5150 to anyone wanting a fantastic TV! We love it!!

Smith", "ReviewID": "R3U3XFUADY562R", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I've had this TV Since April 2010, which is about 2.5 years.  The W model is 120Hz, but has the Bravia Engine 3, like more expensive XBR models.  I liked the CineMotion for some things, but it 'feels' like a rubber screen sometimes.  Never connected via anything but HDMI, and I don't use the speakers (Sat box --> Yamaha AV Amp --> TV.  The Yamaha amp drives my 5.1 surround sound system.My issue started at about 15 months.  It turns out that the Sony warranty was 18 months.  When I turned on the TV, it would show horizontal lines, and a distorted Bravia image.  It made other images look like checkerboard patterns with horizontal lines. If I let it warm up, I could then turn it off/on and it would be fine until I turned it off and it cooled off.  But the warm-up time started getting longer and longer.I did a chat with Sony support, and they had me try a few things.  No change. Upgrade firmware.  No change.  Unplug it for a while... no change.  I sent them pictures of the symptom. So after another chat, they sent a 3rd party service rep(2 weeks).  He brought a board (back of screen at the top), and replaced mine.  It was worse, so he put the original back.  Two weeks later, he came back with two other boards (power supply board and 'control' board?).  No change.  By this time, it was a real fight go get it warmed up.  Two weeks later he brought an entire new panel including another board that he had changed the first time.  Fixed it, and (knock on wood) I've been enjoying it for over a year.  The replacement parts only carry a 3 month warranty, so I'm out of warranty now.Too bad they don't make this model any longer.  But for now, I have an excellent TV!  If I get 4 years out of it, I'll be very happy with the purchase (may add a star).", "Date": "November 20, 2012"}, {"Title": "Great TV- very happy purchaser", "Author": "easy", "ReviewID": "R3VUT5RVSKL98D", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Great TV, very happy with my purchase.

Immediately had problems with a pop-up warning that the signal could not be displayed...while it was displaying the signal.  And the pop-up wouldn't go away until you changed channels quickly or turned the TV off and back on.  It was an intermittent problem and not too annoying, especially since I was enjoying the TV the rest of the time (decent picture, even in a bright room, internet apps and streaming...good features).  Tried calling Sony support, and it was like dealing with an IT Department.  \"Have you updated the firmware?  Turn it off.  Turn it On.  Is the problem still there?\"  \"No, but I told you it was intermittent.\"  \"Is there anything else I can help you with?\"  I guess not!Then about six months later, it started turning itself off and back on, or (when streaming from the internet), just off.  Again, intermittent problem, again the same lame useless advice from Sony support.I probably could have lived with these intermittent issues, but then in Oct '10, the screen started going.  The whole LCD panel would become covered in fine dark horizontal lines...like it wasn't drawing every horizontal row.  Then it started doing this psychedelic melting colors things.  Then it added the vertical white lines/glowing columns to its repertoire.  SAME STUPID ADVICE FROM SONY SUPPORT.  I mean really, their advice never changed, it takes ages to get to a real person, and they are useless.So, on December 8 (after trying to find help online for a while and seeing if the flipping it off and on would work...no), used Sony's esupport site to schedule warranty servcice (this model came with 18 month warranty).  Scheduled service call for Dec. 14th, with Sony's third party repair service, Worldwide Technical Support Service (?).  WTSS called me back within a couple of days.  They knew right away from my description that the whole LCD panel needed to be replaced, but the part needs to be ordered from Sony.I call them and ask how long?  \"Usually 8 to 15 business days\".  Called WTSS two more times over the next 5 weeks.  January 14th, called Sony and raised my voice.  I had the part number, the order number, the service call confirmation number...no help.  Ray said he could submit my request for a refund, and I should hear back from Sony in two days.  I called Sony back on January 19th.  As usual, it took 20 minutes to get transferred to Customer Relations (supposedly only way is to call regular Sony Support first, which will tell you to go to the website).  Finally got a hold of JR, who looked into it and said I had two options.  A $200 gift card for SonyStyle and they would be notified if the repair doesn't happen within 60 days from today (WHAT?), or a REFURBISHED KDL52EX500 (a lower model that has half of the features and NONE of the internet or networking options).  JR tells me these are the only two options.  I say, \"But I was told that a request for a refund was submitted on the 14th.\"  \"Do you have the name of the Sony rep?\"  \"YES!  Ray!\"  \"O.K., well Ray didn't guarantee a refund.\"  \"No, but it is apparently an option.  Let me speak to your superior, please.\"  \"That is not an option.\"  \"It has to be, who makes the decisions?\"  \"We do.\"  \"Who decided I couldn't get a refund?\"  \"A Sony tech.\"  \"So let me talk to them.\"  \"That's not an option.\"  Seriously, went `round and `round like this for another 10 minutes.  \"O.K., so you admit you're offering me a $200 gift card to wait for up to 60 days for a repair, or a refurbished lesser model?\"  \"Yes.\"  \"What happens if it's not fixed in another 60 days?\"  \"You can call us.\"It's a good thing there isn't an app to slap the crap out of someone on the other end of a phone call.Sony, I am so done with you.  A foolishly loyal customer for over 3 decades...NO MORE!  Anybody want to buy a $200 SonyStyle giftcard?  Assuming it shows up within the next 60 days.  Sony's service and products are so bad.
