Wells", "ReviewID": "R2AVSSGX7X3GG1", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I was a little hesitant to buy a brand that isn't advertised heavily, but am completely happy with this terrific TV, especially at the price. Great picture quality, very good sound without add'l speakers, easy on-screen controls, the best designed remote control I have ever seen, lots of expansion features for HDTV and computer connections. The only down side is DirecTV doesn't have a remote code that works with it, so I use 2 remotes.  Love the energy saving feature. Very happy with my purchase.", "Date": "September 9, 2007"}, {"Title": "I like it but.....", "Author": "Ellis Conoley \"Ellis C in CO\"", "ReviewID": "RXSOTCB6PU4E9", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Overall the LD320SS8 seems a great product.  I have not yet done anything exotic--but thus far I am extremely hppy with the picture and the set. However I had occasion to call Sylvania (Funai) tech support to confirm how to wall mount the TV and to remove the stand.  That is another story told below:Imagine my surprise when the very nice voiced lady told me they will not support wall mounting and will not provide any information on it. I reminded them I was on my own to ensure it wouldn't fall, and again asked for help --- with the same answer. I asked for a supervisor, and was told there were none followed by hang up on their part.Bottom line---I figured it out and it is hanging but I haven't the courage yet to try to drop the stand by unscrewing the four screws that seem to hold it in.BTW, the wall mount company was responsive but ended telling me to contact a supervisor at Sylvania. I sent two letters to Sylvania HQs, so far no response.So I guess even though I am so far pleased with the set it is the LAST American brand I shall purchase (even if made by someone else). This is a bridge too far for me.", "Date": "September 28, 2008"}, {"Title": "Love it, Love it, Fantastic Picture. A++++", "Author": "kindred spirit", "ReviewID": "REE2OSKCZTNK", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "My first HDTV and I love it. I have it in my living room and the size is just right. The HD broadcasts are amazing. The first thing I watched was Planet earth and I was afraid that the rushing water was going to spill over onto the floor. It makes it like you are there.It is reasonably priced and I got the extended warranty which I never do but I did my research and learned about when an LCD pixil goes out how costly it can be. I called Sylvania and talked about it.I think the warranty could be better 90 days labor is not much for such a high dollar item.As for the TV it works great, looks great and I have  had it about 8 months and not one problem. As an audio/visual \"expert of sorts\" remember to use the attatchment of your vaccum and dust the top vents weekly especially if you have cats or dogs. Hair can get in there and build up, this keeps it clean and functioning well.Highly recommend this TV. It is great looking and the trim is the same color of the HD cable box. I got an HD upconveting DVD player and now all my old DVD's loook almost HD.", "Date": "June 2, 2008"}, {"Title": "Worst Customer Service I've ever experienced - stay away from FUNAI", "Author": "sax music \"sax music\"", "ReviewID": "R3SPCQLJKALAJJ", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "TV died 38 days after purchase.  Called Sylvania (which is now FUNAI) and they recommended a local service center.  The LCD PANEL needed replacing, but the part was discontinued.  I called FUNAI to find out what to do, and they wanted ME to go back to the service center to get the TV to bring to another service center.  I asked what good that would do if the part was discontinued, they had no reply, just said \"It's just the way we do it\".  I told them that since it was their product I wasnt' going to waste my gas to go and pick it up, they had to pick it up.  Waited a week, and they never picked it up AND they never contacted the service center.  I called FUNAI back, and got the same run around.  They said that this time they WOULD pick it up, but I had to call them back when it was boxed and ready for shipment (they agreed again to send a box).  I then asked how they would keep track of it after that point.  Would they ship it back to me? How did they know where to send a new TV or refund check, again , no reasonable response.  I went to the repair place, picked up the TV and BEGGED BJ's wholesale to refund my money, and they did.  I now own a TOSHIBA, which supposedly has great customer service.  Don't ever buy a FUNAI product - the customer service is the worst.  Other companies they own are:  Emerson and Symphonic.  Stay away if you want to maintain your sanity.", "Date": "September 6, 2008"}, {"Title": "Minor flaws - good value", "Author": "J. Brawner \"LeatherTooler\"", "ReviewID": "RWBZV3B4IK8G9", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I bought one a week ago.Delighted with if in all particulars except when using analog sources and input cables the picture is excessively grainey, and as someone else mentioned, my Satellite DirecTV/TIVO remote has no code to control power and volume.I just bought a DVD Recorder with an HDMI upconvert feature, and patched my DirecTV signal thru it, so I could use HDMI from the recorder to the TV.  Terriffic improvement in video quality, but now Closed Captioning has stopped working.  Why would a manufacturer make a TV with HDMI quality and Closed Captioning, but not make them work together?It's a puzzlement!. . . I leave CC on so I can have the TV on late without disturbing my neighbors, and to understand the dialog on BBCAmerica thru the occasional thick accents.  Now I have to switch back to analog whenever I need it, and the image suffers greatly.", "Date": "December 23, 2007"}, {"Title": "I love this thing!", "Author": "Chris", "ReviewID": "RKA46RLCMP70S", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This TV is very underrated, I've had it for a few months now and I must say, everything about it is awesome. It has tons of inputs on the back, 2 HDMIs, 2 Video, 2 Components, and a VGA in for your PC! The VGA on the back is my favorite, I hook my laptop up to it and use it like a massive monitor. The stock speakers are decent, but I use a Frankenstein system made up of 7 speakers and a sub. Picture Quality is awesome, COD and GH:WT look great on HDMI and 720p. Oh, and if you're a Guitar Hero enthusiast like myself, the lag is about 35ms, but that setting works perfect for me.Pros:-Excellent picture quality-Tons of inputs for devices, designated audio out-Great for gaming, TV, and computers-Underrated, I guarantee you'll love it :DCons:-I haven't run into any so farOH BTW, My xbox says its only a 1080i TV, so I prefer to use the 720P setting.", "Date": "November 1, 2010"}, {"Title": "Worst TV. Worst Company.", "Author": "A. Rook \"Little Rookies\"", "ReviewID": "R1JSOTP1DKYHGR", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "Do not ever buy sylvania (fujai) products. Their customer service is horrible. I own this tv and just passed the 1 year warranty LAST month and it now does not turn on. I contacted sylvania for help and they gave me a reference number and someone to contact about service... the person they gave me to contact was charging $65 assesments of the problem and $80/hr for labor. I called someone NOT reffered by this company and they are charging $20/hr plus the cost of parts. I called sylvania back to complain and tell them the prices were outrageous and that it would cost the same as what I bought the tv for to repair it and I might as well go get a higher quality tv. They didn't seem to care that their customer was unhappy and weren't willing to help in any way. I spoke to 3 seperate people no one could find info on me in the system so I ended up with THREE reference numbers for my case and still got nowhere.Dont buy this TV unless you want to pay double what the tag at the store says after it craps out in a year or year and a half.It was a good TV otherwise, but I shouldnt need to be repairing it in under a year.
