At first I was a little disappointed at the imagine from the dish network box (I heard you have to turn the dish box on a certain way to get it to broadcast 1080p - still haven't made time to test it) the image looks okay so far through the coax.But, when I plugged my laptop in via hmdi for netflix and hbogo - I was amazed at the image quality. So far this TV is very nice for the price!Lot's of ports to plug into.I will say the packaging was poor as stated by most reviewers that bought this thing so that's the only thing - you're rolling the dice on shipping but, as long as it makes it through shipping - the TV is very nice for the price!", "Date": "January 11, 2012"}, {"Title": "Horrible", "Author": "Kshebs", "ReviewID": "R32VL0K3MZYZFJ", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I received this TV as a gift, and had ordered it online. It not only took 11 days to get here, but when I put it up on my TV stand, and turned it on, the entire screen was cracked. I went to put everything back in it's original packaging and it is so incredibly cheaply packed, that the tv stand slipped out of the bag and chipped my coffee table in 3 places. I don't know if the company who runs Sceptre checks these websites for quality reviews, but I would say that they do not seem to take any sort of pride in shipping such an expensive piece of living room furniture out. I am incredibly dissapointed. Be assured that I will not be buying from them EVER!!!!!!!!!! again, and quite frankly think that they should replace my coffee table for the trouble I had to go through.", "Date": "September 5, 2011"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": null, "Features": null, "Name": null, "ImgURL": null, "ProductID": "B004XVMAXM"}}
