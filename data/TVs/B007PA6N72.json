{"Reviews": [{"Title": "great picture, packs away nice.", "Author": "DF1992", "ReviewID": "R1C8483W3XH2GA", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I bought this as a monitor for my dorm room, but like the added bonus of being able to use it as a TV. The resolution is very good, and the screen seems to be glare resistant. The monitor comes with a full size and intuitive remote. The stand is sturdy enough, and is easy to attach to the monitor with the included hardware. The angle of the screen vertically adjustable, but not adjustable horizontally. The monitor is very thin compared to other monitors with the TV feature, and the whole thing packs away very nicely with the removal of a few screws and will all lie virtually flat in a box. If good built in speakers are what you're looking for, this is probably not your best option, however, they are existent, just mediocre in my opinion. I'd suggest some speakers off of whatever you were going to have input sound to this. I wear headphones all the time anyway, so this was not a big deal for me. There is no headphone jack from the monitor though. There is only 1 HDMI input, a second would be nice, but you can buy a switchover multiport HDMI gadget if you really need that. Definitely would buy again, well worth the price.", "Date": "January 6, 2014"}, {"Title": "Monitor review", "Author": "Cool in Concord", "ReviewID": "R2U3RJ1RQQW4QN", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Had a great review and it's living up to it.
