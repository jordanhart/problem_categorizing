Just sound. 21 DAYS!It's been 13 days since it died. I've called Vizio customer service 6 times, spoken to 7 customer service reps, 2 supervisors, repeatedly promised that I'd have a replacement within 7-10 days, also been promised by 4 of those people that I would receive a call.  What do I have? A broken piece of junk still hanging on my wall. Vizio can't get a replacement for me. Can't tell me when they'll have one. No one will return my calls.If you do a lot of research, you'll find that Vizio is having a lot of problems with the main board of their TVs. They generally last about a year then die. Too bad so sad. Buy a new TV.This is my last Vizio. I've been doing my best to get my story out. Don't trust the reviews on Vizio's website either. They're filtering out negative reviews!! I tried to post one last week. Still hasn't shown up. It has to go through a moderator. They're obviously trying to filter negative reviews and opinions.Too bad they don't seem to understand word of mouth advertising will hurt them in the long run.", "Date": "April 24, 2010"}, {"Title": "Great Screen So-So Features", "Author": "J. Stoldt \"joe_thousandaire\"", "ReviewID": "RNEK5ZH3G0LAM", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I bought this TV to move up from a 37\". I wanted 1080p capability and 120hz which I hoped would help with motion blur. Taking it out of the box I noticed it was much lighter than my older TV, good I suppose. The 'Java' finish is nice but not terribly noticeable, I was hoping it would stand out more for as much as they talked it up. The next thing I noticed was how incredibly chintzy the stand was. My old Olevia had a stand that was made out of solid tubular steel and weighs about 20-lbs. The Vizio stand is made out of the cheapest thinest steel China can make, and is a pain to attach as well. If the TV weren't so light, I wouldn't trust it, the stand just does not feel sturdy.Set-up was incredibly easy, just plug and play, the on screen menu is as intuitive as it gets and I was playing around with the settings in no time. The problem, however, is that allot of those settings and extra features just aren't all the great. First there is the SRS TruSurround HD which accomplishes nothing other than making everything sound really echoed and weird, strike one. Then the SRS TruVolume, which is supposed to level out the volume levels in TV commercials and action movies, I have had it on and off a bunch of times, I really can't tell the difference, strike two. Lastly the Smooth Motion feature, which I don't really understand, it comes factory set to medium, but can easy be turned off, which you will be doing quickly if you buy this set. Essential what it does is increase the frame rate of whatever you're viewing, it works just fine but I can't understand exactly why anyone would want to use it. Seems like a pointless feature, but at least it does what it claims, strike two and a half?Now to the screen itself. Fortunately this is the redeeming value of the set, value being the key word. I really doubt you could get a better quality screen for twice as much money. The blacks are black, the colors are vibrant. The refresh rate is fast, movement is crisp. It really is a beautiful picture. The image on the screen will be as sharp and clear as whatever video source you put in. If your interested in this product as a high-def monitor, you will not be disappointed. As a high-feature TV however, it falls just a bit short.

Daniels", "ReviewID": "R640C9F2XNVRR", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "i have this tv. i just recieved it about 2 days ago. decent picture. although through dish network hd the vizio 47\" sv470m handles motion blur much better. this 120 hz tv just doesn't handle fast moving objects very well. seeing that this brand is really pushing that feature on this model makes me wonder which way vizio is heading. also, on 720 you if you watch in normal screen mode, your 47 inch tv is has about 6\" black borders all around tv. you can zoom to full screen mode and this fixes it. the hdmi interface seems to be glitchy at times. blu ray also is not as good. i tested on transformers 2. the scene where optimus fights all the deceptacons . the fast paced action on thr transformers was okay but the background appeared blurry at times. once again, on the vizio 47\" sv470m (lower cheaper model)it was much better. this tv has poor black levels but the overal picture is decent. i have owned quite a few lcd and plasma tv's and this tv is a good buy only if you pay under 1000$. this tv is suppose to be better than the sv470m. they are both 120hz tv. but the lack of cinema mode one the vt470m stinks. overall experience with the lower model was much better.", "Date": "December 18, 2009"}, {"Title": "Poor Dependability", "Author": "Amazon Fan \"no70157\"", "ReviewID": "R1XKBG7Q47MSJ6", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "We purchased a VL470M approximately 18 months ago.  We chose VIZIO because of picture quality and not just because of price.  The TV had a great picture, but it is a shame that VIZIO does not manufacture a more dependable product.  HDMI ports 1 and 2 went out while the TV was still in warranty.  VIZIO customer service was very good and arranged repairs.  However, now the TV will not power up, the TV is out of warranty, and VIZIO will not do anything toward any repairs because the TV is now out of warranty.  It seems that a $900 television should last longer than 18 months.  I will never purchase another VIZIO product.", "Date": "June 12, 2011"}, {"Title": "Vizio doesn't stand behind their product", "Author": "phishinny", "ReviewID": "R3TNJ63ZR9YZ8R", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "I will give Vizio the fact this TV has a nice picture but I have been dealing with there customer service department and it isn't something you want to go through.  At first they seem to be very helpful but they are just trying to make a profit. Sorry about the rant but just got off the phone. I didn't know it at first but I was sent a defective product. When I received my TV the picture would sometime tremble and I figured the problem was with my cable provider or connection, but apparently this problem was caused by a defective backlight. Recently the picture is cutting out completely so I had to call and get the problem fixed.  I spoke with Vizio and they said they would send me a recertified TV which in their words is \"like new\" but they are not willing to warranty this for a year.  They want me to buy a new warranty which I don't understand if I am receiving a new product why aren't they willing to warranty it for a full year.  This lead me to believe that they have product sent back a lot and and can not afford to be sending out products over and over.  If they give you a new warranty their product has to last at least one year and they are not willing to do this. I hope anyone that reads this thinks twice before buying a product from Vizio.", "Date": "November 3, 2010"}, {"Title": "Good for price", "Author": "Ernie", "ReviewID": "R2HS5NS84UCU6K", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Overall, this set has a very good picture but there are better.

During that time, the picture was beautiful, sound great and I would have definitely given it a 5 star recommendation....that is until the TV was about 1 year and 1 week old when it began showing red flashing pixels all over the screen.  The good news...I had a 2 year extended warranty...the bad news...after 2 service calls (1 resulting in no TV for over a week) the only issue being resolved is I am getting my money back.If you buy this TV, be sure to have an extended warranty since you will probably wind up having to return it.", "Date": "February 5, 2010"}, {"Title": "Excellent TV!", "Author": "Mary K.
