And despite the claim that it supports Amazon Instant Video, it does not. I will be returning as soon as I get the go-ahead from Amazon. I wish they would vet their products a little better.", "Date": "December 8, 2013"}, {"Title": "Do not buy this product", "Author": "TLB", "ReviewID": "R36HUR9S6DKFF7", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "Although I did not buy this product through Amazon, I see that it is available. I cannot register the product through Samsung and despite claims that one can access Amazon Prime, the application does not work. This was the reason I bought the TV. I have spent over a week trying to get the product registered and trying to get Samsung to fix the problem and they still have no solution. I noticed another reviewer stated that this product was not made for the US market. However, it was purchased in the US! I love my Amazon Prime account but sure wish I could access it.", "Date": "December 13, 2013"}, {"Title": "Useless POS", "Author": "B Gammill", "ReviewID": "R17B4XTSR58HKF", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I bought this at Fry's.  I believe it is against the law to sell this as a TV in the USA.  It will not receive ANY over the air tv channels.  If you need a 27\" monitor, with decent speakers, and have no need for PIP, this monitor may work for you.  I used to have a 19\" Samsung with PIP, remote and all the bells and whistles.  It became obsolete when we changed to Digital channels, but would work for SDTV with an adapter I suspect that this monitor would do so as well.I went to the Samsung website, and tried to register, this POS but they don't accept this model number in their system.  I chatted with one of their techs, but he knew nothing, and we just wasted each others time.When I tried to set up the time, it listed two time zones...Either onshore Ecuador, or the Galapagos Islands...The power cord has a proprietary(?) female end.  I thought it was like the Directv etc. two connector connection with one side round and one side square to maintain Hot and Common connections.  But, this power cord has 2 ROUND female connectors, and the plug end has no wider plug.  So, any way, since this power cord only measures one meter, you will need and extension cord to get power to this POS.PIP has two sizes and four corners available,  The problem with the PIP is that you can only feed the output of the OTA Tuners to the PIP picture.  So, you can have your snow with either your computer display, or with your HDMI Source.  You CAN NOT display the computer with HDMI pip nor vice versa.  (This was the last straw)  I am either going to just return the monitor to Fry's or file a formal complaint with the FCC.I originally bought this \"TV\" before I read the Amazon reviews.  When I tried to run the AutoTune function it came up with no channels found using both of the coax inputs on the back of the set, and I used 2 different antennas.  It would receive NO OVER THE AIR CHANNELS AT ALL!  Not to despair, so I hooked this POS up to my router, hoping to download updated firmware that might resolve this problem...Well, the download ONLY GREYED OUT THE AUTOTUNE FUNCTION.  What a Herculean effort by the Samsung Team!!! They could have quite easily addressed the fact that the PIP only supports the non-functioning tuners.  Had they done so, I would have kept this MONITOR.  I returned this to Fry's and they are totally ignorant about this product.  However, I am not willing to file an FCC Complaint, life is too short.5 STAR??? bwahaaaaaaa", "Date": "December 31, 2013"}, {"Title": "What I have found out what this monitor will do.", "Author": "Edward Williams", "ReviewID": "ROIPBGLJDKS21", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "First I rated this monitor high for the value I got.  Bought it from a place that sold it for a very low price new with freeshipping however their was a catch.  (they do not take returns)  Found myself stuck with it so decided to checked it out.This unit uses the ISDB-T DTV siginal which is not used in the US.  So I decided to try out one of my converter boxed.This TV will receive the analog channel 3 that converter boxes use.  By using one I was able to get the ATSC DTV  weuse in the US.  This is a smart TV.  I can stream off of my broad band Internet.  The TV consumes (with the back light onlow) about 17 watts. Wow!  O by the way the smart TV can be jerky if you don't plug a hard drive or flash drive it one ofthe USBs on the unit.  Did that and it runs decent.  This TV also makes a good computer monitor  and  multimedia  unit.The unit I got doesn't seem to have any stuck or dead pixels.  The picture is uniform and no light  bleed.  On the downside to me, the smart hub uses Internet explorer for the browser.  I would have preferred Chrome or Firefox.  There area lot of imputes for a 27 Inch monitor.", "Date": "December 22, 2013"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "$399.99", "Features": null, "Name": "New SAMSUNG T27B550 Full HD 27\" 68cm LED Smart TV Monitor Smart Hub LT27B550LB/ZM LED 27\" SMART TV", "ImgURL": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51exmNMDp1L._SY300_.jpg", "ProductID": "B00CLXB6J8"}}
