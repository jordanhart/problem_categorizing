On a 32in screen it's hard for me to notice a difference between 1080p (the best resolution) and 720p (this tv's resolution, and also the second best) and the 60hz refresh rate is what you'd expect from anything that isn't full to bursting with \"true-motion\" technology (which makes it look like you are the cameraman on movies and games, and takes some getting used to). I never had a problem with that annoying \"flicker\" I see some larger Tv's have, which was a plus.Display is great with Xbox and PS3 games, and some PC games. Some games made for certain resoltions (as is often the case with many an RTS on PC) don't really cooperate well with this TV's resolution, so it's best not to use it as a secondary monitor for things like Civilization 5 or King Arthur: The Role-Playing Wargame.The bottom line is that this TV is nice for the price and that if I had $300 I'd buy another one for my bedroom.", "Date": "September 25, 2011"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": null, "Features": null, "Name": null, "ImgURL": null, "ProductID": "B003BIMN62"}}
