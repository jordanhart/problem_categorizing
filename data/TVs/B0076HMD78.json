Fletcher \"CannibalFletcher\"", "ReviewID": "R1DWTFBLE1KJIR", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I'm in college and I wanted to get a small little TV for my room, and SHA-BAM this thing is awesome. I bought it being a little hesitant that it wouldn't be very good quality since it didn't have a 4 star rating or higher, which is what I like to see before I buy an amazon product. But it was a really good deal so I jumped on it anyway. It was a great decision! I hooked my ps3 up to it, play games and watch movies on it quite frequently. The picture quality and the overall build of the TV is definitely on the higher end. Plus as a little surprise added bonus the buttons on the TV are all touch sensitive which I thought was extremely cool!", "Date": "April 6, 2013"}, {"Title": "Nice Little TV", "Author": "Marlene P.

The television was sent in its original box with no other protection. Holes were punctured in the box that, miraculously, did not puncture the TV screen. Two of the four corners of the box were also crushed in one eye opened the package the styrofoam protectors on the corners of the TV work crush inside. Again the television survived unscathed.

It came without the needed screws to attach the base. The first rep. I contacted laughed at me and said he had the same TV and I didn't even need the screws. I then tried another number and got a very helpful man named Garry in Oregon. He got in touch with Magnavox  and gave me a number to call. Which I did. A  nice woman took all the stats including the serial #. She assured me I would be receiving the screws soon..5 to 7 days. When they came there were only 2 screws. Ok, I then went to the local hardware store with the instruction sheet. There was no mention if they were metric or not. I came home and tried the ones we thought might fit.. to no avail. I packed it up (better than I received it) called Garry again he then e-mailed a shipping label and it was picked up. Now I have to return the unusable screws. Three weeks of hassle. It is too bad it came from a warehouse sale with AMAZON on the box. I will only order directly from Amazon or I will go somewhere else..which is what I did.From, SCREWED", "Date": "June 10, 2013"}, {"Title": "Timely!", "Author": "Pop", "ReviewID": "RL2GL6WYF4OZG", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "My wife wanted a set for the bedroom as I tend toward the History Channels and the Military one while she prefers the \"lady\" programs, so I ordered this one as a Mothers' Day gift.
