I gor it home removed it from the box and put the 6 small phillips head screws in the base and it was put together. Hooked it to high Definition Dish Network have beautiful picture in clear colorful High Def. The Sound is good in fact I had to turn it down to 4 out of 10 to keep from being too loud. I don\"t know what everyone else was looking for in a $279.00 39\" led TV, but I got more than I expected so Far. Unless it fries or something past the warranty I feel like I got a Very good Value for the money spent. My other Tvs are Samsung 47\" Great TV, 32\" LG Good TV.This one is almost as good as the Samsung, and Better than the LG as far as picture goes. Sound is much better on both, But I do have a Bose 123 on the Samsung so no problem. I would recommend this TV to anyone who wants a clear crisp 39\" picture with good clear and loud sound.

(Black Friday 2013)The only 'cons' about it would be that it only has 2 HDMI ports, which can fixed with a simple adapter, and the sound isn't the best.The sound isn't horrible, it's actually very manageable, but I highly recommend picking up a sound bar.It's a shame this TV only has 3 reviews on Amazon.Has 500+ on BestBuy's site. And don't worry, I checked the model numbers ^__^Has an avg. rating of 4.4/5 on there and I must say that's about right when it comes to this.If you want quality that isn't gonna break your bank, then pick this up.Insignia isn't the most known brand when it comes to TV's, but they sure do make quality products.Not to mention that it's made with LG parts...well, that'st what the Rep told me.I have an unboxing & review if you wanna check it out and judge the TV that way.http://youtu.be/s90f7OTvWOE", "Date": "December 1, 2013"}, {"Title": "DOA - 13 months old", "Author": "TakeOneForTheTeam", "ReviewID": "R35V80LB110D0O", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "Do not buy an Insignia TV.

If the TV stayed on for an hour, the lamp in the bottom would suddenly illuminate and it would be fine. But if you buy this, keep an eye out for this phenomenon and return your TV.The TV is good for the price other than that. Be aware that there is only one set of component video inputs, and one set of RCA audio inputs. There are no RCA audio outs. For audio output, you only get a 1/8\" mini jack and digital audio out. This doesn't work for everyone.If you want to use this for over-the-air TV reception, the receiver has no signal amplification so you'll want a good powered antenna. Regular rabbit ears won't cut it.Of note: the menu interface is designed well and the remote is alright.", "Date": "May 10, 2014"}, {"Title": "Worth the price", "Author": "Frustrated Customer", "ReviewID": "RU5TE430QNQIH", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I got this during the thanksgiving sale.

My husband won it in December at his office Christmas party. We never heard of this brand before so we were not expecting much when we plugged it in. However I have to say I prefer this TV over our other ones. We used to have a Toshiba that was nice and had a great picture but the sound was terrible. Even with it turned all the way up you could barely hear it over our 3 kids. The sound on this TV is great. It is very clear and not tinny and pretty loud. The picture is beautiful for the price you pay. We have not had any problems with ours at all and in fact it is the first TV I look for when we are replacing all of our tube TVs.

It looked great, and performed flawlessly, until one day just over two years after I got it, I have sound but no picture. I did some reading around online and, lo and behold, this is a very common problem. Looking at some of the other reviews, it looks like mine lasted longer than some others did. Estimates for tv repairs start at about $150, and that's just for the diagnosis, and I'm not willing to pour more money into a cheap tv.
