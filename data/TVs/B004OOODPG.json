This will be of interest to some users.Pros:Nice large crisp pictureHuge number of picture adjustmentsLow Power consumptionIncludes Wireless Network Adapter that can act as a routerViewing angleCons:Not many appsHad to configure for best image quality for moviesAuto back light becomes annoying (disable it)Some light bleeding is noticeable on black backgrounds with white text.Bottom Line:Nice TV.  Remote is easy to use, controls are intuitive.  It offers a huge number of picture adjustments for calibration purposes.  Lots of inputs, and nice slim design.The image is nice and sharp (and not overly sharp).  Browse the internet review sites to find some values for setting image parameters up for best image quality (or at least a starting point).  The \"Cinema\" mode isn't bad if you turn off the auto back light (this feature turns the back light off for dark scenes, but it is noticeable on this TV model as it is a global back light.  The more expensive models have a localized back lights that might be less noticeable.Power consumption with the back light at max is about 115 watts (nominal) and about 30 watts with the back light off (measured with my Kill-A-Watt).  So even though this is a 46.9\" TV, the power consumption is less than my older 32\" LCD TV that used a fluorescent back light instead of an LED light.  Plus it is a lot slimmer because of it.Wireless network was really easy to setup.  I plugged it in, entered my network settings, and was connected immediately.  The software/apps are a little slow running, but the Internet stream seems fine (I only have a slow 1.5 mbps connection).This TV also has a great viewing angle, better than many LCD TVs and nice in a room where you need a wide range of viewing angles.Hopefully the selection of Apps improves soon.  At least it does have Netflix and a couple others, but the number of total Apps I saw measured only a couple dozen.I felt the default image quality mode wasn't really suitable (but it was in part due to the poor Harry Potter transfer).  I still felt I had to make a few adjustments to it though.  What I do like is that each input has its own configuration (i.e. you can have different configurations for HDMI and the TV, etc).Since this isn't an edge lit LCD it doesn't have too many bright spots around the edge, but I still notice some white that will show through sometimes when there is a black background with white text.Since it is running an operating system you get issues of things with operating systems.  Apps aren't available immediately after startup (but the picture from the tuner is available immediately), it might take 30 seconds or so before you can launch the Apps.  I also had a random reboot (just once).  On the plus side is you can get firmware updates with new functionality, bug fixes, etc.Overall it is a good TV with very nice image quality.  The box that it comes packed in is relatively small (nice if you have to transport it by smaller car), and everything seems well thought out.", "Date": "May 27, 2011"}, {"Title": "First day impression", "Author": "M. R. Reynolds", "ReviewID": "R2ZNIX3Z16PLKL", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "See my uploaded pictures.  I selected this TV based on size and the good picture I saw on this model at Sears. Purchased from Amazon after price shopping. UPS delivered a slightly scuffed up shipping box.  The shipping box said it had the AUSYLJR panel. I compared the LG web site contrast ratio to the two different Amazon stated contrast ratio and none agree.  Installing the base with eight screws was easy.  After my DW assisted me in carefully lifting the TV to the top of my dresser I was ready for the smoke test.  But first I noticed a small factory nick on the frame under the protective sticky tape. One star deduction for this blemish.  On power up the set went into a simple set up mode but I was stopped cold when it first wanted to scan OTA channels.  I hooked up some powered rabbit ears and let it automatically do it's thing.  Once that was done I switched the input to an HDMI cable from my cable box and all looked good.  It was quite easy getting a WiFi connection.  All I had to do was enter my Linky password.  Then I clicked on Netflix and got an authorization message.  Meanwhile the TV started updating its software which took maybe 10 minutes.  After it rebooted I discovered that it erased my Linky password so I entered that again.  Now for the Netflix test.I selected the documentary Restrepo, hooked in my headphones and began the Netflix test.  Immediately I was blown away by the video and audio quality I was watching.  Trust me.  It was outstanding ! !Second day impression:The few free LG apps are a joke.The Facebook app is not very good compared to the Facebook PC web site.The TV broadcast image seemed a lot darker than I liked so I turned off the energy saving mode which solved the problem.I noticed that when my cable DVR, in pause mode, went to a black screen with a small moving screen saver image there was a less black area around the moving image.The Amazon price just dropped on this model.  Amazon then agreed to match their new lower price - one time only.First week impression:The LED lighting slightly leaks through the air vent holes on the back of the set.This LG TV is still displaying an outstanding picture but I'm not much a fan of LED TVs. I prefer my older Samy 650 LCD only model in my TV room.This TV was assembled in March 2011 and sold to me by Amazon in April 2011.Amazon seems to change the price up and down on this TV nearly everyday.The LG shipping box goes to trashman today because I'm keeping my baby.Second week impression:Discovered that you don't need to install any LG supplied software to easily play mp3's or see jpg's that are located on any of your local network's computers.", "Date": "April 23, 2011"}, {"Title": "Good as regular HDTV, but Smart TV features mostly bad", "Author": "dingbat", "ReviewID": "R1NYHPVHJV4ZTF", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "Picture quality is great. This is a matt screen and that's a big plus for me. Speakers/audio is acceptable. That's where it stops. The Smart TV and other features which were the main draw for me, are unsatisfactory and poorly executed.The \"Intelligent Sensor\" to adjust pic brightness is a bit of a joke - it merely reduces it to the lowest level possible; nothing intelligent about that.The Netflix streaming app works fine, and is pretty much the only one that works as expected; although it would be nice if LG had streamlined and standardized the menu choices for adjusting picture aspect ratio and video brightness presets (not available from within the app).The YouTube app is complete garbage.Hulu: I saw \"Hulu\" in a lot of the advertising materials but there is no app for it. You can access it via the Plex media server app, (which requires you to have the server running on your connected computer), but the menu steps you have to go thru to get to the show you want are so tedious I gave up, and continue to watch Hulu shows on my laptop. Much simpler. Which brings me to:The BIG negative! The built in browser is useless without Flash. The LG brochure clearly indicates it does not support Flash Player 10 which is fine. That suggests it comes with an older version of Flash. It appears to come with Flash 9.x according to multiple version-check sites, but I haven't been able to get it to work, Even on LG or Adobe's site.The menus for setting favorite channels are also tedious and not intuitive at all. There is an Add/Delete button on the Quick Menu - I haven't been able to figure out what it is supposed to do. There are LG \"apps\" (horoscopes was the latest addition) but their purpose seems mainly to allow LG to brag it has this and that feature without being called out for false advertising.Overall, I think I paid a premium for nothing special. Since the bells and whistles don't work, or are so poorly designed as to be useless, the proper comparison is with a regular 42\" plus the cost of a Rokio or other Netflix device.  If you can get this TV for a price that is comparable to that combo, this model is worth it, but not otherwise.LG's Answers forum (questions answered by LG) - four/five days since I asked how to fix the browser Flash issue, and my question hasn't gone live, much less answered. Which is what promoted me to post this review here on Amazon.Update Sep 26,2011:  Lot's of other issues that have made this \"Smart TV\" frustrating to use except as a basic TV.  I will just mention the most important ones: What's so difficult to understand about QWERTY keyboard layout? It's standard, universal and even a child knows where one letter is in relation to another. Relocating letters arbitrarily and making it harder to find and use is incompetent design. The latest software update  - version 04.01.30 - not sure what it fixed but now I get a \"Software update available and updated\" message on turning it on but the premium panel on the Home screen says \"software downloading\" and I have to go to the full premium screen to pick the service I want.I'm now wondering if I should pay $120 for the LG 5 yr service plan or just chalk this up to a bad decision and sell it for whatever I can get and move on. I could stick it in another room down the road to drive guests crazy.", "Date": "May 5, 2011"}, {"Title": "Great Picture", "Author": "Wallix", "ReviewID": "R19O7RGTUD9C6R", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "*Updated 7/9/11*I've had this TV for about 4+ months now. The strongest feature is the picture quality which I would hope is also your number one priority. I find the blacks to be deep and the colors saturated and bright. For those that are wondering, the 55\" version of this series is LED edge-lit. There are plenty of options for a video-phile to get right down and tweak the heck out of the display, but most people will be blown away with just the Standard picture setting. One gripe is that I'm not convinced you can truly disable Dynamic Contrast. Even with it, \"Disabled\" I will catch it doing an unnecessary dimming in low-light scenes. I'm still on the fence with Tru Motion. I mostly leave it off. It's just a little too jarring for my brain right now. I was raised on 30/24 FPS. You'll see what I mean (And learn what the, \"Soap Opera Effect\" is). Smart TV is a nice diversion. You can browse the web, Facebook, etc. But take note that at this time they do not offer Pandora as an app which is a tremendous letdown. There is also no support for an external keyboard - so have fun navigating the web with the Magic Motion remote! (/endsarcasm) I find myself using Media Link frequently. Media Link is essentially Plex running on your TV. You just need to have Plex running on any Windows/OSX computer on your network and your computer will stream right to the TV. It's a great feature and is a tremendous piece of software. As a side note, LG includes a Wireless N adapter unlike Sony who makes you buy it separately for $100. Physically, the TV is very light and slim. The bezel isn't the thinnest I've ever seen, though, if that matters to you. The Magic Motion remote is only OK. It's nothing like a Wii remote. You'll find yourself constantly resetting it because the pointer floats off its original center point in a matter of seconds. I ended up using the normal remote mostly. Sound-wise, the sound/speakers are pretty low-end. They make noise and you can hear stuff, but that's about it.All in all, this TV excels where a TV should excel: Picture quality. Go to your local retailer and see for yourself. I actually bought this TV based on what I saw with my own eyes. Despite some minor gripes, I feel confident recommending it to anyone on the market for an LED LCD that is fairly budget-friendly.My Wishlist so far:1. Not offering Pandora as a Premium App is inexcusable these days. It's the first app I looked for and it's really the only one I care about. And along those lines...1a. ...If you're playing your iPod through the TV (Stereo mini-plug) to send to your receiver via the TV's Optical-out, the TV thinks there is no signal then shuts itself off automatically after a few minutes, effectively killing your iPod signal.2. Add TruMotion to the quick menu. It's a very situational feature. I'd love to be able to just enable/disable without digging through the menu.3. Would like to see release notes for updates.", "Date": "May 3, 2011"}, {"Title": "I think LG is giving Samsung a run for its money", "Author": "Boss Lumpia", "ReviewID": "R1WKT2B95E69RF", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I just received my LG 42LV5500, which is a major upgrade from a 32\" Samsung LCD I was using. My sole purpose for purchasing a larger TV, especially an LED one, was due to a demo I saw at one of my local retailers for this set. I was floored by the demo because of the incredible visual quality for Blu-ray and HD gaming. I didn't purchase it from the retailer as I was debating between this one and the Samsung UN40D6300. In the interest of saving some money, I went for the LG which has comparable video quality and features to said Samsung LED.I wised up and waited on a good deal. Amazon provided a deal that I pulled the trigger on and I am satisfied with the fact that shipping was free, no state mandated electronics disposal fee, and of course no tax.Sure I had some concerns about delivery, specifically will the delivery people mess it up? Fortunately, UPS was my shipper, and they were very professional and courteous to ensure safe and proper delivery to my home. So thumbs up to Amazon and UPS for flawless delivery.I will say that if you're transitioning from a smaller LCD TV to something of this caliber, it will take some getting used to. In my case, it was with LG's \"TruMotion\" feature. I used Tron Legacy as my Blu-ray test, and it looked fantastic. Also, to assuage any apprehension from fellow gamers out there, Call of Duty: Black Ops, Mass Effect 2, L.A. Noire, and Red Dead Redemption were used for my visual tests. Don't worry boys and girls, you won't get buzz-killed if you go with this LED TV. Red Dead Redemption in particular looked very stunning.The reason why I said \"TruMotion\" took some getting used to was because it makes Blu-ray movies and HD Games look like you're in a vivid acid trip. You can of course turn off the \"TruMotion\" feature, as this TV has a \"picture wizard\" which walks you through different display types and criteria that will help you find what works best for you. The \"picture wizard\" uses what I've likened to a \"powerpoint\" presentation to walk you through the display set up process. It took me about five minutes to find my optimal setting.TV audio on this to my surprise was pretty darn good. I have this setup in my living room. Compared to other LED TV's, I thought the sound on this transmits the best in comparison to Samsung, Toshiba, and Vizio...ESPECIALLY Vizio (Or should they be called, \"Vizi-NO\"). I plan to augment my setup with a soundbar in the near future, but for now it sounds really good as it is.If you're a person who's into apps, I suppose this LED TV will fit the bill. My only knock on this (as with any TV manufacturer that has an app interface) is consider having a QWERTY keypad on the remote. Vizio managed to do that and do it well. But the set up for apps on this TV can be hell on your dominant remote thumb. A QWERTY keypad would have been nice instead of a Wii remote...err, I mean a \"Magic Motion\" remote.This segues into network connectivity. I have no problem since I have it hard wired from my router. It does come with network USB adapter so you can connect wirelessly. But I kind of found this to be a pain in the rear as it took me three to four tries to get the network adapter to recognize my access point. I would suggest a direct connect from your access point to get you the best results.In closing, I think LG did a fantastic job with the 42LV5500. Amazon had a good deal, and delivery was safe and flawless for me.", "Date": "July 19, 2011"}, {"Title": "Nice TV, an upgraded 42LE5400.", "Author": "Ferocious Frankie", "ReviewID": "RSZQLAL2N7JRU", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This is a preliminary review that I will probably update later.I had the LG 42LE5400 before and that thing developed a vertical line after 60 days. Ever since then, I have been searching for a nice TV with better or equivalent features. This TV takes the cake. Higher contrast ratio, internet dongle included, IPS panel, virtually no flash-lighting, cool wand remote, netflix,...So far so good. Only time will tell how much I like this TV or hate it. :)BTW, I got this for $699 w/out tax, almost $800 with tax, (a steal) in CA so you can use this as a price point if you decide to get it.Update:After about 4 months, I'm loving this TV. I use it primarily for gaming and movies. There is no flash lighting at all! Anything in HD looks awesome on the IPS panel. The \"gaming\" preset is awesome as it virtually eliminates any input lag from post-processing.", "Date": "April 23, 2011"}, {"Title": "Priced to Sell", "Author": "Toytoyota \"Toytoyota\"", "ReviewID": "R3799KHKZ8DKG3", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "This is my first large screen HDTV purchase and I had a list of requirements that had to be met. It had to play a plethora of video codecs natively (so no need for a Blu-ray player) and formats (mkv, iso, avi, xvid etc..) and the viewing angle and picture quality had to be terrific (as in better than comparable models from the last few years). This TV certainly met my lowest requirements and was within my budget. My main video sources are over-the-air HD channels, HD mkv files off of my computer, and video content off of the apps the TV comes with.Pros:-Very thin frame. As with all LED-LCD frames, these TV's are just a few millimeters thick. It also takes very little energy.-Great picture quality. No complaints here. I turned off Tru-Motion and did some calibration and it looks terrific. Absolutely comparable to Sony and Samsung with the right settings. There is some grainy-ness if you get really close up while watching over-the-air HD but this is the case with every set I've seen, whether LED or Plasma.- While this feature isn't really advertised, 2011 LG Smart TV's come with \"Plex\" compatibility. Plex is a server you install on your computer and you can stream video/audio/pictures over wifi or wired LAN. It is MUCH better than DLNA in every way. I only use the Plex server, never DLNA anymore because the graphical interface is so much better and the stream connection seems to be more reliable. Plex will pretty much play every video file you throw at it in any resolution (MKV, AVI, ISO, XVID, even uncompressed BD-rips). There are some issues currently with DTS audio in anything other than 2 channel stereo however.- I believe every unit comes with an IPS panel. There is no more panel lottery anymore with this model at least. Google 'IPS' panel for more info on that if you are unfamiliar.-Magic Wand Remote. This TV actually comes with 2 remotes. One standard one that has a built in backlight and is laid out very nicely (big buttons). The second remote that comes with this TV is called the \"Magic Wand Remote\" and it's basically like a Wii-mote. It's a Bluetooth remote that you move to move an on-screen cursor. This makes typing on the on-screen keyboard easy and navigating through menus a breeze.- Wi-fi is standard. This model comes with a wi-fi adapter standard, so you don't have to buy one. The TV also has a LAN (ethernet) port if you wish to go wired.Cons:-The biggest con for me isn't really a problem specific to this set, but wi-fi streaming in general. I have tried to stream 1080p MKV's that are 8-12 GB and above and my 802.11n LAN can't do it without buffering the video every minute or two. I have found that the biggest factor in whether or not a file buffers or plays smoothly over wi-fi is file size. My wireless connection is strong and there's no interference or distance issues. It's just not possible to send huge HD files over most wifi LAN's and have it play back without some buffering, which makes certain files unwatchable. With that said, anything under 5 GB (even HD MKVs) stream perfectly using Plex with no buffering and you have the ability to turn on the subtitles. A lot of the smaller MKV's that work for me still look great in HD (comparable to Blu-Ray). My next step will be to see if an external harddrive directly connected to the USB port on the TV would eliminate buffering. I will also try and get a better internal LAN speed with my N network as that is the main culprit in my buffering. I will update when I try this in the future.-The speakers on this TV are terrible. I guess when you have a really thin TV you can't put anything better than oversized laptop speakers. Right out of the box, I thought the speakers were broken, they sounded so tinny and distorted, like they had blown out already. After tweaking the sound settings a little they sounded much more reasonable, but they are still very soft and you have to crank it up a lot. This is one area where CRT TV's trump the new flat screens. To truly enjoy this set, I would at least get a sound bar. Almost any external speakers would be an upgrade here.- The YouTube app from LG (and for that matter the Plex YouTube app also) are useless. You can't view channel pages, you can't find specific videos and you can't watch live YouTube streams. You are pretty much subject to whatever they want to put up when you search for something and to make matters worse the app is VERY slow. I have a 12 MB internet connection and the TV is in the same room as the router, so the loading of whatever random video it gives you is fast but the app itself is unusable. With that said, once you actually get a 1080p YouTube video playing they look outstanding.- All other apps in general are cumbersome and feel like they are in beta mode. Don't get this TV if you are interested mainly in internet connectivity and features. The built in browser is slower than dial-up and has no flash support. Plex has additional plugins comparable to the LG apps but they don't work either. Plex is best used as a server only but they may improve over time regarding their plugins (apps). FYI on the TV itself Plex is accessed through an app called \"MediaLink\".-There is a tiny bit of flashlighting now and then but not really enough to complain about. There is no clouding that I have seen and very little edge light leakage (a good thing).The only other thing I will mention is that this TV may have locked down functionality. I was reading through AVforums' user impressions of this TV and at some point in an earlier firmware version, apparently this TV had local-dimming settings which would lead me to believe it may not be an edge-lit LED. Don't take my word for it, I don't really know. There may also be built in DVR functionality if you hook up an external hard drive (which once again apparently disappeared with a firmware upgrade). None of these things are advertised and are features in international versions of this model. You can research more on that on your own but it's not really a pro or a con, just something to ponder.LG's 2011 55LV5500 model is priced enough under Sony and Samsung's comparable LED-LCD's to take a good chunk of the market away from them. I was set on a Samsung or Sony but after researching this model and getting a great deal from another website, I went with the LG 55LV5500 instead and I am pleased. We'll have to wait and see if I get the longevity of a Sony TV. I give this TV 4 stars, with the major flaw being broken internet apps.", "Date": "July 16, 2011"}, {"Title": "Great TV for the Price!", "Author": "Jung Il Lee \"ProGolferDigest.com\"", "ReviewID": "R14X9UF64Z7ORZ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This is probably the best deal on a 55-inch LED TV for the price.  Initially, I was going to buy the cheapest, largest LCD TV I can buy but I ended up buying this one because for 55-inch LED TV, this is cheaper than most LCD TVs plus the smartTV option was great for me since I don't really watch much real TV but I need my Netflix working.Got my TV, hooked up the LG wifi USB stick, connected to Netflix within seconds and my kids were watching their favorite kid's movies off netflix and we still have no cable!The TV is super thin, uses less energy than any other TV on the market, and the picture quality is great plus the screen is 55-inches, lovin' it.  I used to have a 46-inch but this 55-inch is definitely a great addition to my home.I know Hulu is coming soon through software update and when that comes my TV will be even better.For those of you looking to spend around $1200-1400 on the biggest TV you can afford, this is definitely it.And also I don't need 3D yet and this is good since it's not added to the cost of my TV, I rather wait 2 more years for that when 3D prices come down.Overall, this is the best 55-inch LED TV you will find anywhere, great prices, and forget all those smaller 42 or 46 inches with 3D unless you are a 3D freak.", "Date": "June 11, 2011"}, {"Title": "Great LED-LCD TV", "Author": "Keith Nicoll", "ReviewID": "R29QZPH7Z1WQ12", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Just recently bought this TV from Best Buy on sale (with a free XBox 250GB unit).

Other drawback is, that contrary to what Amazon's description says, this TV does NOT have Pandora available on it.

The picture is sharp and overcomes the ambient light issues we have in the family room where it is installed.

My only gripe is the separation of digital and analog TV stations into separate groups. Rather than interleaving the digital and analog stations into a single sequence, you either have to cycle through all of one group before getting to the next or you have to specifically select a channel from either group (not all that difficult) to allow you to cycle through that group. My Samsung and Sony Bravia TV's behave in my preferred manner. The audio from the built-in speakers has been adequate for my needs.

This is our second \"HDTV\" but only out first 1080p full HD TV.  Second, we have only had the TV for a bit under a week.Now that that is out of the way I wanted to share my initial thoughts.  Our previous TV worked well, but was starting to look \"wrong.\"  The picture would occasionally be very dark and anytime we watched a dark scene we had to bump the brightness all the way up to make out details.

Finally found the price we wanted and pulled the trigger on this unit.It came in a very large box.  I wasn't home and my wife had a hard time getting it into the house.  There were no handles or other convenient way to carry or move the box.  When I opened this large shipping box there was the original package with the TV inside.  Compared to our old 32\" LCD it was much much thinner, about 1/3 the thickness. Everything was in good shape, except the bottom of the box appears to have been opened before.  The contents do not appear to have been touched previously though.The stand must be assembled if it is going to be used.  Two parts, 4 screws holding it together plus 4 screws to attach to the TV. The wifi is included as a separate USB dongle and one component and one composite input use a 8mm cable adapter. I can't speak to the quality of the video through those inputs as I didn't need them, but I hooked up the cables so they wouldn't get lost.  There are also two cable keepers included.  One has the power cable inserted and the other in place for the AV cables.  They work well for collecting the cables at the TV, but certainly won't help after that point, and shouldn't be expected to.The motion remote is both like and very unlike a Wii remote.  The basic shape and feel reminds me of the Wiimote, but the functionality isn't the same.  This is a benefit and annoyance.  The wiimote requires you to point directly at the TV to use, and can be affected quite a bit over distance.  This remote uses accelerometers, more like a hand held mouse, to move the cursor.  I find myself pointing it at the TV and getting frustrated that it doesn't put the cursor where I want, but then being happy if I'm kicked back on the couch and don't want to point at the TV, a few flicks will move the cursor around the screen.  Fortunately, it has the ability to just use the directional pad to make selections as well, for when I'm getting frustrated at getting the cursor where I want.  Unfortunately I haven't found an easy way to re-enable the cursor without pressing the home button to exit and then again to get back into the home screen.The home screen strongly reminds me of the Wii homescreen as well.  You can program a few apps then click to access more apps.  It's simple and intuitive.  I setup our Wifi, did an update, and connected to Netflix in just a few minutes.  Quality on Netflix is equal to the quality on our Playstation 3.  I prefer the LG Netflix because it is using the older Netflix interface, not the one the PS3 updated to a while back.We have Dish with HD programing, and the quality is outstanding, as is gaming and BluRay from the PS3.  I did some tweaking on the image settings, but the factory settings we pretty good to start with.  If I had a complaint it would be that the images is too good.  With TruMotion on high special effects can't steal home anymore.  I mean that the loss of blurred edges with movement can make it harder for special effects artists to blend the effect with live action.  I can't blame the TV though, this is much like the changes to on screen makeup for live shows like the news when the HDTVs first dropped.I tried looking for bad pixels but couldn't find any.  I know there have to be some, but the pixels are small enough that I'd have to look with a magnifier of some kind to find them, at normal viewing distance it is perfect.  I have notices that fonts often have jagged edges though, not sure if this is the TV, or part of the software I am using such as the NetFlix app. Close Captioning doesn't seem to have this issue and nothing on broadcast or recorded media (DVD or BluRay) suffer from this issue).Audio is good for a TV.  The speakers aren't far enough apart, and don't have any bass to speak of, but the highs and mids are clean.  I enabled to built in Clear Speech and notices an immediate improvement on spoken word clarity, but there is also a slight digital quality to voices. It reminds my of the sound of recorded audio that I've processed for clarity without adding additional ambient noise or reverb. The issue is very minor and I can't hear it with every voice, just ones that are probably at the edge of the normal voice range, kids voices being the most noticeable.I played with a couple of the Premium Apps, but at this time the Amazon Video App doesn't link with our Amazon Prime account for free streaming videos, or if it does I haven't figured it out.  I have only really been able to use the NetFlix app, which I mentioned above. Since we just Dish there isn't any tuning, so we haven't used the built in tuner either.In short, I feel we got a great deal on this TV, the largest that will fit in our cabinet, great picture, reasonable sound, and easy to use.~~~~~Update~~~~~We have had this TV for 2 years now. It has been an excellent TV with a few minor issues.1) The wand remote died after a few months. It was a cool novelty but not something we really used that much so no big loss.2) The Netflix app gives us occasional issues and I have to reset it. This is a little more annoying because I think we watch more Netflix than anything. This doesn't happen often, maybe every two or three months. We will try to watch a show and Netflix starts giving us access errors so I have to hunt through the menus to find the right one to tell it to forget the Netflix account, then I can open up the Netflix app and put my username and password in again. This fixes it every time so at least there is a work around, but it is kind of annoying considering I've never had to do this on the PS3, Wii, or WiiU.Other than those minor issues I love this TV and would buy it again in a heart beat. If we need to buy a new TV I'll be looking for whatever replaces this one in the future.", "Date": "July 11, 2011"}, {"Title": "Extraordinary picture. Weird Smart TV.", "Author": "Victoria H", "ReviewID": "R13OIQN5X5VTNH", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Even in my very sunny living room, I can see this TV! It is better than I expected. The matte screen (instead of reflective) helps a lot. The audio is far superior to my old Sony WEGA. The picture is crystal clear, and is even an improvement on the non-HD channels. I originally saw the 47 inch version of this at Sears, and the picture at home is every bit as good.I agree with the others that the smart TV features are not great. But I have easily logged into Amazon instant videos and watched a free show there, and also a Home Cast Feature, which has TV and Movies for free. Not a member of Netflix, but probably will become one. Getting there did not seem difficult. The magic wand is kind of cool, but at times it is inconsistent. And a keyboard would be nice. There seems to be little support on the LG site for these issues.The LG Apps are pretty laughable. I will use my computer for games, etc. And I am really wondering why I can't get into Hulu. Having Flash on the machine and being able to update it seems to be a no-brainer. LG... please find the bit of brain we need to do this.I have not tried the networking feature, but will get to it. The manual is really not very good at letting me know how to navigate this thing. I am a techie, but I am still confused. I wish whomever wrote it had translated it out of tech and into English.The pricing on this is very annoying. At the time I bought it, Amazon had the cheapest price. Three days later, the price was reduced by about $35. I applied to Amazon for a refund based on this and got it. A few hours later it went down another $15. I have written Amazon a letter about this, as there is something fundamentally unfair about this. I suggest if you buy it, you check the price daily for the 14 day price match period and keep records. Then submit for the lowest price in that time. You will need a URL, price, and date for that. Good luck on finding the submission page. I think I got there the third or fourth time I went to \"my orders\".", "Date": "June 2, 2011"}, {"Title": "Great for Newbies to HDTV", "Author": "B. McEwan \"yellokat\"", "ReviewID": "R1PE5I0QBKCL9Y", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I consider myself relatively savvy about technology but I have not had an HDTV before purchasing this LG model.  Since I am not anywhere near as sophisticated as some others who have already reviewed this television, I thought it would be good for me to write a review for other informed consumers who are just moving into the HDTV realm and concerned about getting their equipment set up and working properly.  I have now had this TV for a week and am overall very happy with it.First, it arrived well packaged, with clear instructions about setup, which took me all of about 10 minutes. I am using the included stand rather than a wall mount. The TV comes with two remotes, one of which is standard with all the buttons, bells and whistles and another \"magic wand\" type that is super simple and elegant to use. If you hook up a gaming system to this TV, the wand remote will put you right in heaven.Although I have high def cable, I first set up the TV without connecting it to the cable so that I could see how it operated on its own. With the aid of a cheap digital antenna the LG pulled in 47 different stations, all in absolutely breathtaking clarity. The picture is truly beautiful and definitely rates a 5. The sound, however, is a different story. It seems muffled and at times the TV has to be turned up quite high in order to clearly hear certain programs, especially anything that has a dramatic scene where the actors are whispering or speaking against background noise. Then, of course, the sound level blasts you out of your seat when the scene changes to a commercial or a something where the sound is less nuanced. I rate the sound a 3, which is why my overall rating for picture *and* sound averages to a 4. I plan to purchase some good speakers and connect them to the television, which should take care of the sound problems.When it came time to connect the LG to my cable box, I opted to use an HDMI connection because it's the simplest, although you can also use an RGB connection and get close to the same quality as the HDMI. (The set also has standard composite connection sockets, but why accept that loss in quality after you've already gone to the trouble and expense of purchasing an HDTV?)The HDMI connection works very nicely with the cable box, with one exception.  When I change from a regular standard def (SD) channel to an HD channel, there is a short break in the picture, a sort of 'hiccup.' The screen goes to black and then flickers a bit before finally settling down to a steady, beautiful picture. In some instances, it's a beautiful picture without sound, however. I have to switch among the HD channels a couple of times before the sound resumes on the HD channel. After first freaking out, then asking around among some friends, I discovered that several other people have this same problem with HDTVs made by other manufacturers. It seems to be a problem with the cable company, not with the television. One friend told me that it only happened to her when she used the HDMI connector and that the problem ceased when she switched to an RGB connection. (She has a SONY television.) So I have learned to either avoid the SD channels, which is not a big hardship, or to tolerate the 'hiccup.'The other things I love about this LG picture: 1) The blacks are really black, not merely gray, and scenes that take place in dark settings (alleyways in cop shows for instance) convey all the detail of the darker areas rather than letting details get lost in a sea of undifferentiated darkness. 2) Graphics are amazingly clear and bright. Scoreboards in sports programs have never looked so good. One thing, though, is that you will probably have to turn off the energy saver feature in order to get a truly bright screen. The screen automatically adjusts to the ambient light in the room, but I found that it often darkens down too much so it is necessary to just turn off the energy saver, which seems to be the default setting. Just go to the TV's main menu to adjust the brightness and contrast. 3) Also in sports programs, the LG tracks motion very well, so you can follow the flight of a golf or tennis ball and see the jersey number of the woman who just made a futbol goal.I haven't yet used the \"smart\" functions, although I probably will hook the TV up to my wireless network at some point. If you are an Amazon Prime customer you can now stream many, many films from Amazon as part of your Prime membership. That's a great deal that I will want to take advantage of. I don't care much about the other supposedly smart apps, which seems to be a good thing since other reviewers have not been impressed with them.Overall, this is a great HDTV for the price and a truly magnificent one for a newcomer to HD. It's easy to set up, looks great and is lightweight, a real blessing after years of hauling around those heavy CR TVs. The only snag is the sound, which is easy to ameliorate.", "Date": "July 28, 2011"}, {"Title": "Power issues are the main one.

It is crystal clear(when it works). I love this tv because of that alone. I hate the though because it is fussy. Since we got it, it has had a few issues turning on and staying on. It will randomly just turn off. Good thing though is it would only do this occasionally and start working again in a few minutes. These last two days it has been flickering the \"on\" status led twice and then nothing! We can't get it to turn on or anything. I'm Cedia Certified and it seems like they have power supply issues. I have checked all cables and plugs and they ARE getting the 110V needed. Even with that, I have tried other plugs in my house. Same thing!Off my main concern is that this TV is Flash 8 only. And they have no intent to get an upgrade for flash 10. Which just so happens to be how all videos are being made now for the internet. So the App for Youtube and Break.com will not work as they have gone to flash 10. That was a selling point of this tv to my wife and I since she loves youtube and Break. Re-Flashing a chip to accept it would not be hard and would benifit all the people I saw that have made complaints about it. One person I know was told that the new 2012 LG's will have it. So that makes me think that LG would rather us all who bought this(2011) one just upgrade to another(2012) new tv.Don't get me wrong, If you want a great picture quality and easy connections. THis is for you. Can't go wrong. Unless the power issues is bigger than we know. If you want web access for youtube, break.com and pandora I would advise looking in to the 2012 models or just another brand.All TV's have little things that can just bug us or even worse, make it so we can't use the productDo your research! Awesome picture quality after a light fine turning, And if it has want you need, get it. Just know that others have had my issues too.No problems with my Samsung LN55L630K. No issues at all with this one.I just want my product working as expected. Just be careful what TV you buy. Before you do, Google it and see what other people are saying.

I picked up the tv from Amazon for about 760 dollars while it was selling elsewhere for 1000+.  The tv itself is great, it's very thin and has a great picture and sound quality.The picture on this tv is very nice.  I don't have HD cable, but do use it with a PS3 and bluray player both connected via HDMI and the picture is flawless.  The only downside is the screen lighting up a whole section of the tv to show light text on a dark background, but that is due to it being an edge lit LED tv, and not a flaw of the tv itself.  There is an expansive set of tools in the tv for calibrating the picture and even has an included calibration wizard that will go over things such as contrast and sharpness and even provides a blue filter on the screen to get the tint just right.***This is an important note.  Since the tv is 120hz it offers a smooth motion feature that will help create a clear picture during fast action scenes in sports or video games.  This feature is turned on by default and works well, but can produce a bad effect on movies and tv shows.  It makes movies look like video, for example it takes away any graininess of film and makes it look like it was shot with a home video camera.  At first I thought it was a flaw of the tv, but after some research I found it was due to the smooth motion feature and the problem is common across all brands of tvs.  To fix it simply go into the picture menu and turn off the feature.  Some people may like the look it creates but I did not, so I wanted to mention how to fix it here.***The internet connectivity works well.  The included internet adapter made connecting to my wireless network easy and got me online quickly.  I am a netflix subscriber so that is mainly what I use it for.  The LG app store is kind of lacking right now, but it is also fairly new so I am hoping it will improve over time.  They do have apps for most popular services such as Netflix, Vudu, Napster, CinemaNow, Twitter and Facebook.  The included browser works okay, but its rather clunky using it over a pc so I don't really bother with it.  My biggest disappointments in the internet apps is that they do not offer an app for Hulu Plus or Pandora, but hopefully they will be available in the future.  I have read that one for Hulu Plus is in the works.  *EDIT* 7/9/11 - Hulu Plus is now available.Overall the tv is a great buy, the picture is great and from what I have seen I think it rivals the top brands like Samsung and Sony.

I did lots of research online and in-store to make my decision.  I narrowed it down to LG and Samsung.  One factor that swayed my decision was the screen finish.  The LG has a matte finish while the Samsung has a glossy, glass screen.  When I viewed the TVs in-store, there was glare on the Samsung but none on the LG.As for picture quality, I am pleased with the LG.  Not blown away, but very, very impressed; a 9 overall on a scale of 1-10.  Blu-Ray looks so much better (10 out of 10) than cable HDTV (8 out of 10).  I attribute that to HDTV being broadcast in 720p but Blu-Ray being transmitted in 1080p.  The TruMotion function is downright incredible for sports viewing.  In my opinion, however, it needs to be deactivated when viewing anything non-sports.  The TruMotion gives a very surreal, artificial quality to non-sports viewing.  It's not all bad, except that you can see what I call a `digital enhancement aura' around moving objects when viewing non-sports in TruMotion.  On the flip side, if you can get past the `aura', the other images are so crisp, they border on 3-D.  It is NOT enough to prevent me from recommending this TV.  Once you understand the benefits of each viewing mode, it is terrific.  Additionally, calibration is very important for the optimal picture setting.  The TV usually comes pre-calibrated for optimal in-store display viewing which is quite different than residential viewing.  Save $200 on professional in-home calibration, though.  A simple Google search with the model number and \"calibration\" will produce easy to follow at-home calibrations.I have no opinion on the audio for the TV, as I have it set up through my home entertainment system.While not important enough to truly sway decision making, the magic wand remote control is pretty awesome.  It's essentially a wireless mouse, shaped and held like a slender remote control, that is used for on-screen menu navigation.

The sound is nice and loud if you want it to be and I believe the quality is very good (certainly better than my last tv).The directions that came with the TV were straightforward, and all of the documentation has been simple and easy to follow.As you probably have seen this tv is internet ready. You can access a dumbed down web-browser, but it is not flash ready and therefore many websites are unusable. This is not the biggest of deals as there are a good amount of Apps that work well.I mostly use the Netflix app. There is a Hulu+ App (that's the pay version) and various other \"premium\" apps. The LG app store is new, so there are not as many apps as lets say iTunes or the Google Marketplace, but there are a good number. The College Humor app and the news apps are some of my favorites.The tv comes with an included app called \"Media Link\" what this app does is after you install some software on your computer and attach your computer and the tv to the same wireless or wired network you are able to access the video, audio and picture files that are on your computer. This feature is amazing and is very convenient.What makes all of this highly involved apps possible is the inclusion of the \"Magic Motion Remote\". This is basically a Wii remote. (The system also comes with a standard remote) You point the remote at the screen and a reticle appears so that you can type in text or select buttons in a more fluid manner.This product is great and the only downside is the limited size of the LG App selection, but their app store only opened in April 2011, so I'm sure the options will improve.I was a little frustrated with the state of the box as it arrived to my apartment.

My old TV had a better sound.As for the facebook, well, in order to use this app, you need to grant LG an EXTENDED permission to acces your account which includes:-Posting to my WallLG Smart TV may post status messages, notes, photos and videos to my Wall.-Accessing messages in my inbox and posts in my News Feed.-Accessing my data ANY TIME.LG Smart TV may access my data when I'm NOT using the application.-Managing my eventsLG Smart TV may RSVP to events on my behalf.-Accessing my Profile information Events.-Accessing my photos and videosPhotos uploaded by me, Videos uploaded by me and Photos and videos of me..-Accessing my friends' information Birthdays, Events, Photos and Videos.This list is ridiculous. Most of it is not relevant for the use of this app. For eg.,why do they need to RSVP my events in order for me to use their app?? And why do they need to post to my wall?It is very clear that LG uses its customers (who paid a whole lot of money) to promote themselves. I find it highly annoying.I want to emphasize that the thing that bothers me the most, is that nowhere in the specification list does it state that you won't be able to use flash 9 and that the browser would be only for.. I'm not even sure for what. LG markets this TV as a \"smart\" TV while in reality it is not. It is a TV with a great picture and an ok sound, that happens to have an internet connection (a very slow one) and a bunch of useless applications.Unfortunately this info is not available on the manufacturer website and I felt that it should be known to potential customers. I hope you find it helpful when deciding if this TV answers your needs before you purchase it (I wish I knew that before I purchased mine).", "Date": "June 21, 2011"}, {"Title": "My first HDTV!", "Author": "Cyclone Nation", "ReviewID": "R1G1PRYF6JHXXD", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "EDIT on 01/03/2011:1. Very happy with the TV. Haven't had to change anything so far!2. Complemented it with a new soundbar (Zvox 555). Excellent sound!Couple of problems:1. Magic remote ran out of batteries - lasted hardly 2-3 months.2. Youtube app is very raw. Will not play playlists, jumping to a different point in video is next to impossible.3. Netflix update made it difficult to navigate through my Instant Queue. Also, the search is very bad.EDIT:1. I figured out it's called the soap opera effect and all that needs to be done is to disable TruMotion. Movies are watchable now!2. Magic Remote does not work while typing in Netflix. Wonder if it is just me or it happens to everyone?After an impatient 2 week wait (Amazon were temporarily out of stock when I placed order), I got my 42\" TV this week and finally assembled and connected it yesterday night. The experience so far has been great! No reason to consider returning the item at all.Day 1 impressions:1. I am fully aware of the Lottery Panel (VA vs IPS panel) for this model as I have been following every possible review online before and after placing the order. I noticed that I got the VA panel myself. This kinda disappointed me until I unpacked and connected the TV. The good news is that despite the VA panel, the display is very true and solid and I do not see any quality degradation when I watch the TV from  different angles in my living room (a normal apt living room). So, the VA / IPS paranoia can kiss goodbye!2. Most of the things work as advertised (how often do we get to enjoy this as consumers! :  - you need to get used to using the Magic Remote if you plan to use Youtube and type / search for videos. Otherwise, it's painfully slow with regular remote.3. I tried the Youtube, Netflix and regular cable tv in HD. Display quality has been solid so far (college football, couple of movies, video songs). I have not had time yet to try various calibration settings found online at avsforums.4. As this is my first HDTV experience, probably it might be something to do with HDTVs in general - both movies I watched we so rich in the picture quality, it felt like I was watching a TV show rather than a movie - kind of didn't get movie feeling. Switch from HD to SD and it was back to good old days! Does anyone know why? Is it bcoz I am using default speaker? Anyways, I can figure this out in the coming days by digging online.5. When IronMan 2 just started on Netflix,  there was a brief dark screen - at this point the display was horrible, I could see LED white light glowing from random places on screen. I haven't observed this again though. One to lookout for in the coming days.6. Wifi was a piece of cake and it works well!Will update more later.

Schoonmaker", "ReviewID": "R2MU79B8K6AUGR", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "The LG 47LV5500 was even better than I expected it to be when I purchased it. The Smart home screen is great way to organize everything I use the TV for on a daily basis. Being able to stream Netflix, MLB.tv and access movies/music/pictures from my WD MyBook hard drive means I was able to completely replace my WD TV Live Plus and my HDMI connection to my computer. It's all in the TV now!The TV is extremely thin. About 1.2\" thick. It's a great picture if you turn off TruMotion for movies. Still looks a little stuttery with sports but it definitely makes for a crisp picture if you use it. Still playing around with picture settings but the defaults are working fine for now.Cons: I've only browsed the LG apps but they seem mostly geared towards family/kids and not all that useful yet. Hopefully they can add something that will allow me to check stocks at a glance or maybe sync with a personal calendar? There's no Pandora access from the TV which my WD TV Live DID have so that was a step backwards. When you're navigating via DLNA you can't change how the files display. The default display only shows the first 12-13 characters so long titles are hard to read. Also, there's no flash capabilities in the web browser. The magic remote is fun and convenient to use but doesn't work inside of Netflix even though it works inside of MLB.tv. Also it's very easy to screw up the alignment of the magic remote. However, it's equally as easy to realign it so I guess we'll call that a wash. Lastly, HDMI cables in the HDMI ports don't seem to clip in like my old LG tv did. Doesn't give you that satisfying \"it's in\" sound or feel.That's a lot of cons to list out but overall I'm still impressed with this TV capabilities to organize all the things I use.", "Date": "August 26, 2011"}, {"Title": "LG HDTV", "Author": "Peter M.

The picture quality out of the box is very good, but I am tempted to knock half a star off my review for LG's poor documentation.  They don't include a printed manual, just a CD with a PDF file on it.  The PDF manual seems to apply to pretty much their entire TV lineup for the year and is full of \"if your model number starts with this prefix, then this picture applies to it\" choices.There are many options for adjusting the picture, all of which are poorly documented in the manual.  For example, Noise reduction \"Reduces screen noise without compromising video quality.\".  That gives me no info about what it's doing under the covers so I can make an informed choice to turn it off or on.  Color temperature is a slider bar that goes between \"warm\" and \"cold\" with no indication of what might correspond to 6500K (daylight white).My first tuning pass was to turn off all the nice options \"helping\" make the picture look \"better\".  Power saving off got rid of the annoying feature where the TV brightens or darkens the picture based on the ambient light level in the room.  I turned off dynamic contrast, dynamic color, noise reduction, mpeg noise reduction, clear white, \"eye care\", and maybe a couple of other image tweaking options.  I can't remember which all of them are enabled by default.I then ran the Disney WOW calibration disk and tweaked the brightness (54), contrast (90), sharpness (h25 v44), color (49), and tint (G+7) options, which got the picture looking pretty nice.  My big discovery was when I ran their overscan test.  You would think that setting the aspect ratio to 16x9 on a 16x9 TV would be an obvious choice to make, but apparently that makes the TV overscan the picture by about 4%.  That means the incoming picture is \"expanded\" by 4% and then the edges of the expanded image are chopped off on each of the 4 sides.  It also means the TV is doing some scaling under the cover which recalculates/interpolates/corrupts the incoming pixels.  The correct setting is \"Just Scan\" which you could summarize as \"just display the pixels as you received them\".  This is documented in the manual under \"Using additional options\" and not under picture settings, so it's easy to overlook.After tweaking all those settings, the picture now looks awesome to me.  I may go back and experiment with turning some features back on.  \"Trumotion\" and \"Real Cinema or Film Mode\" look like they might be useful and non-destructive.So far, I haven't configured the TV to connect to my wifi network or played with the Smart TV, Apps, streaming, etc. features.  I have an LG Blu Ray player with wifi and streaming, so I assume that the TV will work similarly.  The little magic motion remote control included seems useful, but sometimes seems to resist moving the cursor down like I want it to.", "Date": "December 16, 2011"}, {"Title": "Incredible picture, handy apps.

My jaw literally hit the floor at the quality of the picture, and I really like the built-in network savvy, web browser, and netflix player.Pro:+ Awesome picture! blacks are much blacker than my other TV, and truMotion or 120hz refresh (or both?) make a visible, positive difference in picture quality+ TV looks nice, and is very thin and light for its size+ includes both a normal remote and a wiimote-like remote that you can use to point at click at the screen like a mouse+ built in network support, web browser, netflix client, and many other features. If you're trying to make a guest comfortable, this keeps you from necessarily having to give them access to a separate computer, and increases their entertainment options.Con:- Software update is a little slow, it looks like it downloads a whole new OS each time rather than just patches. Hopefully it won't need to be updated often.CONFIGURATION:I've got my TV hooked up to an XBox-360 via HDMI, and the XBox in turn is acting as an extended for a Windows Media Center for TV, and Windows Home Server for ripped movies. I have a mixture of SD and HD content on my network, and a 30 Mbps download speed. I'm using the included wireless adapter for the TV, in addition to the built-in wireless for the XBox-360. I went through the software update for the TV, and am running 4.02.xxx I believe, upgraded from the 3.xx.xxx it shipped with.DETAILSThe TV is incredibly thin! You just don't appreciate how thin 1.5\" is until you see it first-hand. It's relatively light (for its size) as well, I was able to pick it up and move it on my own (though admittedly I'm a big guy). The base is stable, and though it doesn't allow movement up and down, the TV can pivot left and right on it, which is handy. The TV comes with a power cord, a USB wireless network adapter, a normal remote control, and a wii-like remote control with only a few buttons.It was easy to get the TV hooked up to the network, the on-screen configuration of wi-fi let it connect to my WPA-2 network with a password, no problem. The cables were easy to attach. The network adapter took a little hunting to find the USB ports (back, upper-left side as viewed from the front), but went in easy enough.I used the normal remote initially, but quickly switched to the wii-like remote. It's perfect for controlling the menu's and using the built-in apps. Other people have complained about the interface, but being familiar with design of UI for constrained input devices, I think they've done a reasonable job.The netflix client was easy to get running. I watched 'good will hunting' as my first movie. even though it's an old movie, the encoding was first rate. It was ASTONISHING watching it on this TV. I didn't expect the 120hz and tru-motion to matter at all, but man was I wrong. The movement looked so smooth and natural I was flabbergasted: it actually looks a bit weird (in a good way). I'm used to the encoding artifacts / blockiness, especially with smooth motion in encoded video, but after the first couple seconds of playback, there was none of that. It really is just amazing. I'd have to say, the picture is good enough that it's got me rethinking my other TV's (a 42\" HD tv and an HD projector). If a little extra smarts to do this tru-motion stuff and the 120hz makes that big a difference, I think I'm willing to pay for it.I really like the picture on this thing. Great detail - which you expect from any HDTV, but one thing that sticks out is that the blacks are noticably blacker than they are on my insignia LCD TV. I'll chalk that up to it being LED. And as I mentioned earlier, truMotion and 120hz makes a shockingly significant difference in quality of watching video.Other reviews have complained about the built-in apps and menu system. So far, I like them. I have played a bit with the web browser, and I have to say, it's nice having that wiimote thing to enter URL's, faster and easier for me than doing T9 on a remote numeric keypad. Nice that it remembers favorites. I visited aljazeera's website in both english and arabic, both rendered just fine.I also saw complaints about the sound quality in other reviews. I haven't cranked it up, but for as loud as I want it in the bedroom I've got it sitting in, the sound is just fine, at least as good as my other TV.In short, I'm gobsmacked by this TV.

There are lots of color adjusts so I should be able to get the picture set to my preferences. Not really crazy about the energy saving feature, it basically turns down the LED lights when the room gets darker, but it can be disabled. The SMART tv works quite well, but as other have pointed out it only has Flash v8 which practically no website uses anymore. LG says they aren't going to update the version. I don't understand if it is a hardware issue or that they don't support any type of browser plug-ins which makes the browser fairly useless. But the other features such as Youtube work well, although the Youtube interface is much simpler than the PC interface. So, you are better off attaching a PC to the monitor if you intend to browse on the TV. The TV is very thin, but it still weighs like 50 lbs. The stand attaches to the TV with four bolts and it is sturdy. There are 4 HDMI cables on the side, none on the back and the cables do stick out the side since the HDMI cable is rigid. The cable tie down is on the opposite side of the HDMI connections of the TV so unless you are using long cables it is not useful. The TV does come with a couple of dongles and connections in the back if you aren't using HDMI but I haven't tried any of them. The remotes are ok. It comes with two, one is streamlined at you move a pointer on the screen to select things. The main remote has more buttons but some of them are too close together.

I have attached my PS3 to the TV through my Denon receiver and it is working without a hitch. The one thing does bother me the viewing angle is somewhat limited but I can't say whether is worse or better than Samsung.

The picture quality is awesome.  The first week or so I thought it looked weird in comparison to my other LG HD TV and I think it's the TruMotion feature.  After a week or so I adjusted and it looked normal to me again, but it did take a little getting used to.  The sound is decent, but we purchased an LG blu-ray home theater system to go with it just because sometimes with our three year old running around it never seemed to be loud enough. The magic motion remote is cool for the first week, after that you realize it's not that amazing.  Not as accurate as a Wii remote and can be a pain to use at times.  For the few games available though it's kinda cool.  Honestly, I don't use the apps function all that much.  I was surprised that it came with a wireless adapter instead of making you purchase it separately.  Pleasant Surprise there. Delivery was easy they brought it in for me and offered to help set it up, but since we were moving in a week we decided to leave it in the box.The only thing I was a little disappointed in was that Pandora was not included as an app option.  I was under the impression the LG TVs had a Pandora app and this one does not.  It was the app I was most excited about!All that being said, I would definitely recommend this TV to anyone who asks.

This is the third HDTV in my home and by far the best. Several years ago when I was at a Gamestop and they were playing Transformers on Blu-Ray and it looked AMAZING. I had seen the movie 3 times in theaters but the pictures was way much clearer and it honestly looked like a different film. You could see every detail and it almost gave the film a 3D affect. At the time I didn't know much about HDTV so I just assumed that's what a film looks like in HD and on an HDTV. My first HDTV was a Phillips 42 inch 1080p 60 Hz LCD. When I first watched the TV it was a big upgrade from my old tube TV. I had purchased the HD-DVD of Transformers and was excited to see the crisp picture I remembered seeing before but it did not live up to my expectations.  It was good... really good, but it just didn't look as crisp as I remembered. I thought it might just be the TV, or maybe because it was Blu-Ray and not HD-DVD, or maybe I just remembered it differently.My second HDTV was my old roommates Samsung 46 inch 1080 p 60 Hz LED. I eagerly tried watching Transformers, and although the picture was bigger, a little more clear, and brighter it still did not meet the expectation I remembered.I finally was at a Best Buy one day and saw some movie playing and it had the crispness that I remembered.  I was finally realizes that what I was missing was double the refresh rate.The LG Infinia 42LV5500 42-Inch 1080p 120 Hz LED HDTV with Smart TV has the crispness that I have been looking for.  HD Content looks amazing almost too real sometimes. When you watch a movie it almost looks too clear and too real. I've watched several films including Transformers and they all have the very crisp look I've been looking for ever since I saw the demo of Transformers years ago.  I've seen TV with Higher refresh rates 240 Hz and 600 Hz, but honestly I can't tell a big different.  But there is a HUGE difference between 60 Hz and 120 Hz, well worth paying a little extra more.The Smart TV is pretty cool, I use it for Netflix, but it can be a bit slow.  Not a deal-breaker, but I prefer the Netflix interface on the Roku or Xbox much better. This TV is thin, but the Samsung LED was much thinner, which is also not a big deal. I ended up paying about $670, but this TV is worth much more.  If you pay under $800 you're getting a good deal.", "Date": "August 8, 2011"}, {"Title": "Great Picture/Internet Browser=Epic Fail", "Author": "Joe B", "ReviewID": "R1LMBJ2BNELK0Y", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Purchased this 42LV5500 from amazon at an amazing price.

Right out of the box this T.V. had an amazing picture.  A few tweaks and the PQ of this set was simply stunning.  The magic motion remote makes navigating the menus of the T.V. simple.

Movies and music streamed wirelessly to the T.V. from the computer in my basement.  I even plugged in my external hard drive and played movies in many different formats.

What a good choice. The TV arrived in its own box - I would have liked it to come double boxed in a brown box to hide the packaging, but this wasn't really an issue since someone was home to sign for it. The box was slightly scuffed up - but not a big deal, as its contents were flawless.After unpacking, I noticed the TV was RAZOR thin! Really incredible. And it wasn't too heavy either. The included stand fixture seemed to be a bit plastic-y to me - I was expecting a more solid, heavy, metal feel, but it holds the TV up without a problem, and has a nice amount of swivel to it.The TV has a really great variety of ports and they are positioned perfectly to allow for a slim wall mount, which I will be setting up in a few days.I set up the Magic Remote, but I don't really use it - I see it more as a gimmick than something I would use daily. The regular remote is great, intuitive, and backlit, which is very helpful.The picture on this TV blew me away - it is brilliant and very sharp. While this is my first HDTV, I've seen other sets, and this is one of the top performers.The Apps on this TV are great as well. The Netflix app is the one I use a lot, and it works flawlessly.The MediaLink feature on this TV is really a highlight for me - it allows you to stream movies you have from your computer to this TV over your home network. Now, I have upwards of 250 1080p Bluray rips on an external drive attatched to my laptop - rather than having to buy a separate piece of equipment such as a WD TV Live or an HTPC to play the movies, I can just stream them. Its really great and it works really well. That being said, I think its a better idea to have your TV and laptop hardwired to your home network than to rely on wireless, because the majority of my rips are >20GB .mkv files, and I encounter a lot of buffering, which can be annoying. I ordered an extra ethernet cable to solve this issue.The audio on this TV varies - for Xbox 360, its almost too loud - I have to keep it on 20 out of 100.. For Netflix, its difficult to hear the TV over my window AC unit at max volume. I can deal with it, but an external speaker setup would really compliment this TV, as it would any. Not a deal breaker for me though.I did experience a decent amount of input lag when first setting up the TV and playing a game of Call of Duty Black Ops on my Xbox 360, but if you switch the TV's \"AV Mode\" to \"Game\", this completely solves the issue and the experience is lag free.Apparently, this TV is very energy efficient as well - the sticker that came with it stated @ 5hrs/day, it would cost $12/yr to run this TV. Thats awesome.No flashlight issues to speak of - the image is very uniform. Blacks are black.Overall, I would really recommend this TV.", "Date": "August 1, 2011"}, {"Title": "Great as a TV but not (yet)  an internet surfing gadget.", "Author": "Dang Le", "ReviewID": "R1Q6URDNOWOF9Q", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "TV picture is great with HD Channels.

I am not very picky about this but i have grown to like it like a little extra.If it is important to you you may want to do some more research.

I don't have a home theater system, but I do use Sennheiser wireless headphones, RS180'S, to really appreciate the surround sound, and I am very satisfied with the results using the headphone input with the volume on the internal TV speaker. Connecting the TV using the WLAN ADAPTER to my Verizon FIOS Wireless Network had been a challenge, but I did use an Ethernet connection to receive the latest software updates for the TV and that endeavor was successful. Then an answer in the VERIZON tech forum said to upgrade the router security level from WEP to WPA, and that solved the authentication process, and the wireless network was connected immediately. The extra or \"Magic\" remote included allows you to go online and surf by clicking on the TV screen keyboard. Very Cool!!!

I called LG customer service and in 2 days someone was at my home to examine the TV. He agreed with the pixel diagnosis and said he had to order a new LED screen for me. After a week he said it was back-ordered and he was referring me back to LG to have the entire TV replaced while I used the original TV. I received a call in three days and was told a trucker would call me and arrange for delivery. Everything went exactly as related to me, and a new TV arrived and was set-up. This dilemma or mishap was handled promptly and professionally. I was very impressed. These situations arise, and I was in the retail business for many years, but how they are handled is what defines a company and its employees.

The TV is very light and very thin, making it easy to pick up and move around. It is easily handled by one person. The picture quality is excellent, the colors seem bright and accurate. Their is an easy to use calibration tool for fine tuning the picture settings as well. The small speakers are as good as any other in this type of TV, they won't blow you away by any means but they do get the job done. The TV has a good selection of inputs - I've got the cable box, antenna, DVD player, Xbox, and computer all hooked up to it with several input ports to spare.The TV is fully internet connected - though I'm still struggling to find the value of this. The embedded netflix app is actually pretty neat and might persuade me to stream movies more often. The built in web browser really doesn't seem to have much use (I can't think of when I'd browse on the TV instead of using my computer or phone). The TV comes with the \"magic remote\" which functions similar to the Wii remote, and I'd actually say that it out performs the wii remote in many aspects. This makes navigating the menus quick and painless. I just wish their was more worthwhile content on the TV to justify ever needing it. I've read that LG is quickly adding more apps to the catalog, and hoping that this improves the situation.I've got mixed feelings on the 120hz refresh rate. I'm still deciding whether this is actually an improvement, or just a gimmick that may actually take away from the picture. One thing is for certain, it does change the way motion is portrayed on the screen.Summary:Good:1.Excellent picture quality - especially for the size and price range.2.Very lightweight and thin. A single person can easily move this around.3.Rear connections are easily accessible. Between the fact that the TV rotates on the included stand and the side mounted HDMI ports - Everything can be hooked up without climbing behind the TV.4.WiFi was set up and connected in minutes5.Magic wand is very accurate and easy to use6.Netflix set up and streaming in minutes.7.120hz makes for crisp, smooth movement on screen, and can be turned off when not wanted.Less Good:1.Other than Netflix, the other apps seem mostly pointless2.Don't see myself ever using TV for web browsing3.Sound is okay, on par with other similar TV's. External speakers will be required for full experience.4.120hz can make picture seem fake. It goes against 30 years of TV viewing experience engrained in my brain.Bad:1.Two remote controls than need to be kept track of. Magic remote does not have enough functionality to work the TV without also needing the standard remote.

After months of research and review reading I decided to replace my more than 20 year old, on its last leg, 27\" Sony Trinitron with this 42\" LG Smart TV and I couldn't be happier.  The picture is amazing. It's really very hard to believe the difference between the new and the old TV.  I keep saying WOW out loud!  The sound is very good too, though I haven't yet been able to find the right setting so that the commercials don't blast, which was an important feature for me.  I've only had the TV a month, so I am sure that I will eventually workout that kink.  The TV itself is very beautiful with it's ultra thin, sleek design and even though it is much larger than the old TV, it takes up much less space and has opened up the look of my living room.  Amazon's price was literally hundreds of dollars lower than any other discount electronics/appliance store. (I checked 4 different stores each time I received an info notice from Amazon.) and when it came within my budget I bought it right up. I intend to pay it off in 10 months, however I took advantage of Amazon's 24 month, interest free payment plan.  Delivery was much quicker than advertised.  My only problem was that it took some assembly to mount the TV onto the stand.  My friend did it for me and it took him approximately 90 minutes. I am often shut-in due to physical disability and this TV has made the time at home much more interesting.

Blu rays are the highlight by a long shot, everything else falls quite a distance behind. the only bad things i have noticed was, the trumotion feature is meant to reduce blur as much as possible to make the picture look as pure and crisp as possible, this feature works very well with blu rays and pretty well with an hd cable box, but for videos streaming of the portable hdd it gets very choppy and the trumotion is a very bad thing, but you can turn it off so its no big deal(oh by the way it can stream avi formatt videos from a usb device, super nice!).  bottom line, i love this tv, i barely even had a budget and choose this one, with no regrets. so if your looking for a really good tv with lots of cool bells and whistles (though admittedly, netflix is done much better on the xbox 360, but the 360 does it better then anything i have seen aside from the pc) i cant see this tv disappointing anyone who isnt an idiot.i heart this thing. the best gift i have ever gotten.highly recommendcons: wifi is a little slow for being 10 feet from the router, web browser is a little slow, trumotion messes with video games and lower res videos, and nothing ever really explain how to do anything so you will have to figure it out for yourself, but its nothing to hard.pros: it looks and sounds amazing, im used to hd everything and this tv had no trouble impressing me, which was surprising. trumotion is awesome with hd movies, especially bluray. it has like 11 possible video inputs, i dont know why you would need that many. it can stream video from portable hdd. motion remote works way better then expected, its actually quite nice.

I looked at my types of televisions from LCD to PLASMA to LCD-LED. Plasmas just looked muddy to me so I decided on LED.Not a lot of consumers know this, but within LED backlit televisions there are a three types of  LED backlit televisions. full LED, LED-plus and edge lit LED. This television is LED-plus. Its a combination of full LED in that the LED's can be turned on and off individually, but is also similar to edge lit LED in that the LED's are placed around the edge of the screen and not behind it. The result: You can see during certain scenes in movies parts of the screen completely turn off to get true black. Because this TV isn't full LED, you can see in certain circumstances where the TV mixes trying to create black using RGB and where it physically turned off the LED. The first time you notice it, It can be a little distracting. Over all, It gives you great black levels. If you search on the internet, you can find this site that tells you all the levels you should set the television to. Use them. the 120hz of this tv makes stuff like news and sports look phenomenal, just make sure you have 120hz or \" Trumotion\" as LG calls it turned off if you watching anything that is 24 frames per second source footage. Otherwise it will look unnatural. The \" premium apps\" aka apps that are actually worth using are pretty good. I use the Netflix app all the time. I do have the issue of netflix getting disconnected. I\"m not sure if it is Netflix, The television or my internet connection.  The dream is that someday LG,Samsung,Sony and Vizio all team together under Google TV so app development is more uniformed. The youtube app is horrible. It is nearly impossible to pull up searches correctly. The video encoding they are using looks great though. Lets now talk sound.  The television speakers are pretty weak. I have a 2.1 system hooked into the television via a 3.5mm headphone jack. The problem with this is the amp in the television makes bass and action scenes extremely loud ( sounds good though) and dialog nearly soft as a mouse. I will  eventually get a optical audio out system to correct this.  The television came in a really slim box and a day early. Kudos to Amazon for that. It did however have  5 dead pixels in the middle of the screen. Calling LG immediately, they told me it would be fix in 5 days. After the service technician never showed up, I called back and have been getting the run around for nearly a month now. They have a private logistics driving across the country to swap this television. Why they couldn't ship it like amazon did beats me. I have spoke with LG managers and what not and have yet to feel like a satisfied customer. Shame on you LG, shouldn't take 30 days to get a tv swapped.  I do recommend the set, just make sure you get one with no dead pixels or fear the horrible LG tech support.", "Date": "September 2, 2011"}, {"Title": "Great Smart TV!", "Author": "Josephine H.

I have done my homework, and run the gauntlet of TVs over the past 3 months. I am better educated than many associates at Best Buy, and know TVS for the most part.  I am whats called a \"well educated layman\". I started out with the LG 47\" 3d TV after reading all of the rave reviews, and if there were still any around, I would probably have one right now except for one problem: I got the one, totally defective TV, and there were no others at the store I got it at.I returned the 47\" LG TV (it blurred....halo-ed...cross-talked...looked horrible, and then developed a big black stripe down the right side) for a Samsung 51\" Plasma.  Its colors were rich, the blue rays were great, but it missed the fine detail, and the Tru-Motion effect that I grew to love. SO, I decided to give it one more try, and lo and behold, there was this 42\" LG smart TV there playing a 1080i signal.  It seemed to play just fine...no blur..halo...or crosstalk.  So I packed up the heavy beast of a plasma, and off to the store I went.  I am happy to say that I am VERY pleased after gambling that my other LG looking like crap was anomalous.  It was,,,this TV is SWEET!!!THE GOOD!!!:CLARITY: The depth and detail of the faces, skin, and fabric of clothes is not to be understated,,,Its simply breathtaking.  Although the plasmas colors seemed a bit more brilliant (I may yet be able to tweak that on this)REALISM: I like the Tru Motion.  Some don't, but I do.  I love it, and it really DOES eliminate blur,Halo or crosstalk ghosting and makes the film seem like it was shot live, or greater than 24FPS.  Its amazing.  I prefer to watch everything in this mode.SOUND QUALITY: First off, if any of you think your gonna get \"theater like surround sound\" off of a TV that is 1\" thick, your head needs to be examined. When I want the room to rumble, I run it through my stereo.  THAT said, from what little I have heard from the built in speakers and sound selections, its better than the thicker Samsung.  I can actually HEAR the dialogue (thanks to the CLEAR VOICE mode), and the music actually sounds decent with NOT BAD bass and treble.  THAT is the reason I thought it was worthy of mention. IF you want theater like sound in a TV, save up 10k for a Magnolia system. I think they did an A+ job given the small space.BLACK IS BLACK: with few exceptions, and with tweaking, this edge lit TV does a great job with maintaining the black colorREMOTE: Once you get used to where everything is located on the screen, its nice not to have to try and find the damn buttons.  ALL you do is aim and shoot. The \"Wand Remote\" makes things much easier.  You hit the \"Home\" button and a cursor appears on the screen...you move the remote, and the cursor moves...move the cursor to ehre you want to go...hit enter and your there!  Nice job, LG!NO BLUR: I am very picky about this tooNO HALO/GHOSTING/CROSSTALK: OK if you are REALLY looking for it, maybe you will see it for a millisecond OCCASIONALLY, but you actually have to TRY and find it!TONS OF COLOR ADJUSTMENT POSSIBILITIES: 2 Expert settings where you can set a day or night calibration either professionally, or with some internet help in addition 2 some great presets.STREAMING NETFLIX or VUDU IS SO MUCH MORE ENJOYABLE WITH/WITHOUT THE TRU MOTION. Streaming LOOKS AMAZING, and is far superior to Plasmas!!  Even if you aren't hip to the Tru Motion setting, 720P signals will look like 1080p on plasmas.  Try this: Watch \"Sons of Anarchy\" with the tru motion all the way up.  You can see ingrown hairs on the bikers shins...its almost FREAKISH!THE \"BAD\":NOT MUCH,but here's my finickiness...I am VERY picky too!!!!FLASH-LIGHTING-This depends on how you set the black levels and the back lighting, so my sense is this can be tweaked with calibration.  this can be done by turning down the black tone to \"Low\" and turn down the gamma, and then turn up back-lighting. Take a day...play some movies...You'll get it!OCCASIONAL FLICKERING-Again I suspect that this VERY occasional effect can be cured by calibrationHARD TO SET FLESH TONES~ Its just tweaking, and I am sure that it can be done...it just takes patience.BOTTOM LINE~First off,  42\" ISN'T MUCH SMALLER THAN A 51\".I cant tell the diff.  This TV was well worth the money spent, and although the previous one was a lemon, it was one out of MANY that are spectacular.  BUY THIS!

LG does an outstanding job at balancing the voice vs. music portion of movies so that one can always hear what the actors are saying.

We were looking for a smart TV with a wide viewing angle and a minimum of glare from outside lights. The LG seemed perfect for our needs and it has met all of our expectations. Picture is great, and it has synced with our 10 year old router with minimum of problems - but I had to manually enter the router IP address during the setup on the new TV.To get the necessary router IP addresses I copied the addresses used by my computer to communicate with the existing wireless router.  I went to Windows Control Panel, clicked on \"Network and Sharing Center\" then \"Local Area Connection\" and then \"Details\" which lists the various IP Addresses for connecting my laptop to my wireless router.  These codes are similar to the codes shown for the Ad-hoc mode on  page 36 of LG's manual and after some trail and error it worked. There may be a simpler way to do this, but this worked when the \"automatic\" method LG listed in the manual did not. I expect the newer routers will automatically connect so I did not downgrade the LG for this problem.We have been able to download Netflix movies using the WiFi without a problem and love the capability to download movies directly. We also receive HD from our cable provider and the picture quality is outstanding.

One knock is not blacks (as noted in other reviews, I find them intense enough with some adjustment to basic settings) but scenes that are have too many white tones, the screen will gray out and lose definition even on a Vivid setting.  However that is the rare exception, the HD side is visually engaging enough that we repeatedly are watching films for the sake of seeing the quality, not the film itself.  Non-HD is more than satisfactory.  Plus is sound which is remarkably good for such a thin product, in a small room very good.

This sucks when browsing folders with hundreds of files.-Speakers (what do u expect from stock speakers)-Some apps require magic remote. they should just ship it with the unit and charge a little more.-tru motion... echh. have to dig thru some menus to disable itI am very happy with this TV. Tons of apps, and the ability to stream content from the network is pretty awesome. I will probably still add a media center PC, but for the price this TV cannot be beat. Also, I paid for 2 day shipping and on the second day it hadn't even shipped from the warehouse. I contacted amazon, they gave me a $15 credit, and had the TV there the next day.

After the system update my tv no longer my network.  It kept saying the gateway was using a faulty ip address.  I consider myself somewhat tech savy so I manually entered the ip information and still got the error.  After spending 1 full day trying to correct it, I ended up plugging an ethernet cord into and attaching that to my network.  The tv read the network and did another system update.  After that I disconnected the ethernet and attached the wirless router and everything worked.  I figure that there is an unknown bug in the old update that prevents the tv from responding to the router.  Oh well.  After that everything worked fine.

Oh and the medialink feature is great if you have a bunch of movies on your computer hard drive.", "Date": "July 8, 2011"}, {"Title": "Great TV for grandma and nerds alike.", "Author": "Brian", "ReviewID": "R16QOAPJVAPFHO", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Demographics: I've owned the TV for 2 months now, I'm a 30yr old male, I've been in IT for 12 years now, have a masters degree and am a system admin. I don't drink the Apple kool-aide so I only use Windows on the PC, some linux, and Android tablets and phones.The Screen:I've seen some complaints about playing the screen lottery and hoping you get the \"good\" glass panel. Who cares. I checked and got the \"bad\" screen. It still is one of the best picture I've seen in a TV. Everyone who comes over and sees an HD over the air station is blown away. My mom wants to sell her sony bravia now and get an LG. Everything is so bright and vivid. The TV has a sensor that detects when the room gets dark and dims the screen. I saw some complaints about that, but I liked it. Your eyes get used to the dimness fairly quickly, you are saving electricity and it has to be easier on your eyes (see your local optometrist for further details). There are Max, Mid, Min, or off settings if you want to customize or not use it at all. Several people mentioned that calibration is needed to make this TV show its true colors and I couldn't agree more. Thankfully there is a nice and easy wizard that helps you set it up correctly. Once it's set up, it's fantastic.The Remote:The TV comes with a traditional IR remote and a new \"Wii-like\" wand remote. I haven't used the IR remote since I bought the TV. The wand responds better than a Wii remote and you don't have to point it at the screen. You know how the Wii remote would wiggle and you were flipping your hand all over the place to realign the cursor on the screen? The LG wand is stable and very responsive, I was blown away and didn't expect that at all. It comes in handy when you need to sign into Google things, Netflix, search YouTube and on and on. Although the superior solution is to download the free LG app from your android phone and control the TV from your phone. You can import your favorite channels and select them and use your whole touch screen as a track-pad to move the cursor on the screen. Just make sure you and your TV are both connected to the same network.The Apps:It's pretty cool to have Google Maps, Picasa, YouTube, Netflix, a Web browser and streaming radio apps. What I don't understand is that I can stream Netflix movies perfectly and can jump back and forth through a movie fairly quickly but the YouTube app is absolute rubbish. It is slow, there is hardly a user interface, it is not user friendly, the videos stream for a few seconds then buffer for 30 seconds. I have tablets, smartphones, laptops and desktops all using YouTube and there is no lag on my 6Mb connection. My 15 month old daughter with a 20 second attention span runs in the living room asking for elmo and leaves after 5 minutes because it's still not loading. When you fire up YouTube it automatically starts playing a completely random video, taking up precious bandwidth and slowing down my search. Enough complaining....it needs serious work. The other apps are sort of slow but this is a TV not a Revue, Roku or a Core i7 Windows Media Center PC, so don't expect to be wowed with speed.Software Features:The BEST feature IMHO is Plex. If you aren't aware of the capabilities of Plex, Google it. I can watch and listen to all my divx/xvid/mkv movies and mp3 collection streamed from my Win7 desktop PC. The Plex software scans your PC for movies and pulls movie details such as pictures, ratings, reviews, synopsis and more and displays them in a beautiful scroll-able interface on the LG screen. Plex is free, get it.The TV also supports DLNA so I can right click an mp3 or movie on any of my windows 7 machines and click \"play to\" and select my TV and it tries to start playing but I haven't successfully gotten it to work, nor have I tried to find out why. Plex works so I haven't troubleshooted, but I see the option there.When you click the \"Homelink\" button on the remote it brings up a nice clean interface that is easy to understand. You can get to your settings, apps, favorite channels, or switch the inputs.Sound:TV sound is on par for TV speakers. Where I was pleasantly surprised is when I plugged in an HDMI cable into my Onkyo TX-NR609 7.2 Channel Network THX Certified A/V Receiver (which can also be controlled with a free Onkyo app for android). Once I made a few changes on the Onkyo receiver I was able to use the volume on my TV's remote and it said \"Home Theater\" inside the onscreen volume circle in the bottom right. It pushed the sound down to the receiver through the HDMI cable and recognized it automatically. Then when the receiver is off the sound reroutes back to the TV speakers. I read some complaints that the only audio out is a single optical out connection. I guess that's true physically because there aren't any 1/8th inch connections, but I can send it through HDMI so I'm happy.Hopefully I've covered some of the things the other reviewers haven't covered. I highly recommend this TV and will buy LG again.

You can't find unlimited video sources online through this TV, but you will be able to get rid of your cable and get a lot of on demand content through the built in apps it has.So far we've been using Netflix and Hulu Plus to see what it would be like to live cable tv free, and I think we'll be pulling the Comcast plug very soon. Hulu Plus on this TV is crisp and easy to use and gives me access to most of the shows I bothered to subscribe to cable for in the first place, like The Daily Show, Colbert Report and even some I don't need cable for like SNL when I miss it over the air.Netflix is also perfect on this TV and is not limited to your queue like a particular Sharp TV that we almost bought instead of this one. I might be odd, but I don't own a Roku, Wii, PS3 or Xbox360, so my first HDTV's way of connecting to Netflix and its usability was actually a deciding factor for me. This TV's Netflix app lets you browse through all instant play content and offers you suggestions based on your preferences, etc. It's actually almost as easy to browse through as the online version, which is impressive.There is also an internet radio app built into the TV because the radio signal in our house is dominated by one particular station making the ones we listen to fuzzy and inconsistent sound quality. This lets us wake up to streams from NPR in our college town of Minneapolis, or sometimes the good indie rock stations in LA and Seattle. It's called vTuner and if you get the TV be sure to check it out.We also hooked up our USB external hard drive to the TV to see how it handled the big collection of .mkv anime and music we have stored on there and the TV handles those extremely well too. I did take a crack at seeing if we could play them wirelessly through the PLEX media server software, but the software didn't seem to get along with my 5 year old dell laptop, so I gave up on that. I think connecting the external drive to the TV when we want to watch something from there is going to work in the meantime.Lastly, it does seem worth mentioning that I was hesitant to get this TV when I saw it in person at BestBuy because one of the movie clips the demo would play had a lot of black that looked really terrible due to being washed out and gray. I think that was mainly due to the incredibly bright settings they use in store however, because so far I feel the picture quality on this set is great. HD content pops and colors are true. I'm not a TV picture expert by any means, but everything I've seen on it, other than the SD content from my non-HD cable box has made me very pleased. The SD content from my cable box looks so-so, but I think that's pretty typical with any HD TV. There may be some sets out there that display SD signal more beautifully than this one, but I would doubt they could give me access to internet radio and on demand content from Hulu and Netflix as seamlessly as this one.All in all, I think this TV will be plenty of entertainment value for me over I hope the long haul as long as they keep upgrading the firmware as needed from time to time. I don't doubt they will soon be adding Flash 10 support to the browser, as the TV performed an upgrade on itself as soon as we connected the wireless signal. But please don't buy this expecting it to be a replacement for your desktop's browser because it's just not built for that.", "Date": "September 9, 2011"}, {"Title": "Great TV", "Author": "J.

Since the LEDs are\"backlighting\" it from the sides, you may get a lighter black on the line that the text sits on).-PLEX media server support built in, although any DLNA server on your network should get recognized.-Thin bezel and side profile.-Home screen was easy and intuitive to customize and navigate.Cons:-LG apps are a bit slow, but usable.-The DLNA interface could be a little cleaner (you basically get a list of folders and files), but you can always use PLEX, which has a nicer Netflix-like interface with titles and their covers.-Inconsistent interface among apps. For example, Netflix only requires a press of the enter button to pause, while watching a file from your DLNA server requires you to push a button first to bring up the onscreen controls and then push pause, FF, etc. This might stem from the fact that the apps are all developed by different companies, but some consistency would be nice.-Speakers are weak, but what do you expect from built-in speakers?", "Date": "August 4, 2011"}, {"Title": "GREAT LED BETTER THEN SAMSUNG", "Author": "An Q.

I tried the latest (and older) drivers for the video card (N-Vidia GT450).... beta drivers... custom refresh rates.. Latest firmware for the TV.. nothing made a difference.I tried a PS3.  Same trouble.  I tried a Roku... it still juddered. Different HDMI cables... no change. Maddening!The smart TV part of it is utter garbage. The applications take ages to load... especially from cold start.One time I was trying to switch from the Smart TV Amazon player to the MCE input so I could register the TV with Amazon... but I had to actually exit the Smart TV application to get to the MCE HDMI input then back to Smart TV to reload the application... by which time the code was no longer valid....  I had to get my laptop to register the TV with the various Smart TV application websites... a frustrating and time consuming process.There is no external keyboard support and all the on screen keyboards in most of the applications are non-qwerty!!  I mean, come on.  Would it kill you to give us a virtual qwerty keyboard from time to time??We all know about lack of flash support but that doesn't bother me personally.. although I do think it is a little short sighted not to support flash properly.Thankfully the video is judder free and perfectly smooth on the LG smart TV version of Amazon and Netflicks... BUT beware many of the picture controls available on HDMI inputs are disabled on the smart TV applications ... and guess what.  The one setting you want to change is greyed out... Black Level!!  You have a choice of low & high on HDMI inputs but it is \"unavailable\" on Smart TV applications.By the way LG, why would I want to choose an option THAT TURNS MY BLACKS INTO GREY... and why would you switch it to high (aka grey) in smart TV applications and then take control of it away from the user?????When watching Netflicks or Amazon on LG smart applications you don't get the rich blacks (sic)... it just looks grey, just like an LCD from 2004!!So your choice is juddery video via HDMI or smooth video from one of the LG apps but with blacks that are grey!!On the subject of picture controls the menus on this thing are context sensitive.  This makes navigation confusing at first.The greyed out black level control is hidden in a sub menu under the \"Q.Menu\" button when in smart TV mode but ONLY when video is playing.  If there is no video playing this button does not do anything.If you want to get to the black level control for a HDMI input you need to do so via the \"Home>Settings\" button just prior to when you actually launch Smart TV!!!As others here have pointed out blooming is apparent in certain situations but it's not as bad as some TV's I have seen.

At first we had a problem getting Netflix to work properly, but the hubby got that working and we are now happy with that.  However the YouTube app is extremely disappointing, because when you visit the app it automatically starts playing a random video- and everytime it seems to be a video with inappropriate content.  If I had known about this issue then we would have bought another TV.  I don't want to return it because it is a huge hassle.  We are satisfied with everything else about the TV.  However NOTHING should be automatically played from YouTube because there is so much inappropriate content and it is hard to search for what you want.  I am afraid to use that feature while my child is in the room for fear of what will come up on YouTube.I contacted LG about this issue a few days back, and I have yet to hear back from them.  The thing that I don't get is that there seems to be a simple fix to me.  Just reprogram the app to not autoplay anything- and only play videos through the youtube app once the user has selected play on a video- then make this an update to the software.  There are other things they could do to make the YouTube app more user friendly, however this is the biggest- and most unacceptable- issue and should be address immediately.  At the very least, respond to consumers who have contacted you with concerns.  I decided that since I haven't even received a simple email apologizing for the situation, that I would do my best to make sure that other families purchasing this TV are aware of this huge flaw in the product.

There just isn't that demand out there for this capability yet.Second (2)  Although I'm willing to give this TV and LG an almost 5-star rating for the picture quality and most of the other attributes, I have to fail this manufacturer on its Aspect ratio control functions.  Therefore, I can't give this TV or any other of its TV products a better than 3-star rating until it fixes its Aspect ratio capability.  I.e., it has \"Cinema Zoom\" and \"Just Scan\"???????  What the heck is \"Just Scan\"??  It doesn't even explain this in the manual.  Secondly, \"Cinema Zoom\" takes whatever the video signal is and stretches it to fit your widescreen viewing area BUT DOES NOTHING IN THE VERTICAL DIRECTION.  If you have program that has been transmitted to your TV (via Cable, a VCR, a DVR or a PC) in \"Window box\" mode (black bars on Top & bottom and also left & right), \"Cinema Zoom\" stretches the picture left and right to fill the screen but leaves the black bars on top.  I.e., fat people!  Yes, there is a stretching feature attached to this aspect ratio allowing you to stretch in the vertical direction from 1 to 16; but guess what?  it stretches in the horizontal direction also!!  So, if you choose \"Cinema Zoom\", the aspect ratio of a correct video in Window-box mode has now been corrupted, making the people fat, and this new INCORRECT aspect ratio in then maintained if you try to stetch 1-16 in the vertical direction.The older model 32\" TV I got 3 years ago, had \"Zoom1\" and \"Zoom2\" features.  The \"Zoom1\" setting automatically zoomed a given video picture in both directions to fill the screen, but maintaining the correct aspect ratio.  Then if you had a box score or subtitles that were eliminated at the bottom of the screen, you could back off the video zoom slightly by toggling to \"Zoom2\".  Why in the heck LG did away with this correct control, I have no clue, but since they did, I can not give this TV better than 3-stars!!!!!!04/03/2012", "Date": "April 6, 2012"}, {"Title": "great TV", "Author": "jadiegear", "ReviewID": "R1EM1NPQZIQR90", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "The quality is great and price is good when compared to other brands.

Owned for 4 months and have only found a few little complaints (and not so much with the tv, but more with the netflix interface, since this was one of the main reasons for purchasing the tv).1. Can't easily toggle between tv program and netflix. Example: Say you're watching a movie on netflix  and you decide to exit netflix to catch your favorite tv show, when your show is over and you want to just click back over to your movie it is a bit of an annoyance to have to reload netflix and reselect what the movie/show you were previously watching.2. Not LG's tv fault, but your often have to deactivate and reactivate netflix because all title you click on will say \"unable to load title.\" This has nothing to do with my network, I have strong wireless connection, when I called LG they said this is common and that Netflix is expanding to add smart-tv's and so they have glitches along the way.3. Again problem with Netflix... Not all available titles are displayed in each category. Example: with netflix on my laptop all available titles in each category are displayed... \"Reality tv\" 120 available titles, on the tv you can't even search the category \"reality tv\" and \"tv shows\" might only give you 75 titles to choose from. So to find a specific show you have to locate the title on your laptop and then enter the title in the \"search\" on the tv to find it.4. Trumotion is very annoying to me,  I always have it turned off, makes the movement seem very unnatural. Sometimes even with it \"off\" the movies on netflix still appear to have the setting \"on\" so I have to go back to the tv settings and make sure it is off, and it is but for whatever reason it still looks unnatural...

Samsung was the only one that came close, and the Samsung set did not have included wi-fi, nor did it have both Netflix and Amazon capability. So, we took the plunge and got the LG set (though we purchased it elsewhere).The most significant problem we've had with the set is that the wireless streaming is very, very spotty. It would constantly lose its connection to the wireless router, forcing us to reconnect (including inputting the passphrase) every minute or two. Totally unacceptable. I don't know if the problem is with the TV, or with the included wireless adapter (a USB device about the size of a thumb drive). We wound up having to purchase an ActionTec adapter (the MOCA-compliant one, as we are FIOS customers) so we could hard-wire the TV. Fortunately, unlike other sets in this price range, the LG has an ethernet input.  So, if you're specifically looking for a wireless device, this may not do the job.The other feature I disliked was that when the screen was set up to auto-dim based on ambient light, it was almost always FAR too dim. I don't recall what the setting was that I had to tweak, but basically I turned off the auto-dim function.And audio volume: I don't know whether this is an issue with the TV, or with the upstream providers, but we've found that when we watch a movie from Amazon or Netflix, we have to crank the volume up to 60 or so. When the movie is over and we go back to regular TV, we have to adjust the volume down to 20 or so FAST, or we get our eardrums painfully blasted by the loudness.Other than these minor problems, we've been very pleased with it. We have a bunch of devices connected to it, including a blu-ray player via HDMI, a cable box via HDMI, a Wii using the component inputs, and a VHS player connected (I think) via the coaxial input. There are a total of four HDMI inputs so we could hook up a couple of other devices as well if we wanted to. The picture quality is great.

I'd have loved to have a remote keyboard, but I thought tht the Magic Motion remote might be the next best thing.  Unfortunately, it's pretty difficult to use unless you are within about 3 feet of he TV.  It's range is great but if you are more than 5 feet away, after just a few moves, the control can be more than 45 degres away from where the remote is pointed.  It's easy to recalibrate it just by bumping the cursor into the opposite side of the screen.  That gets the cursor roughly where the remote is pointed again, but that must be done after every few moves.  The regular remote works on many sites and sometimes is almost faster than the Magic Motion device.The graphics on the browser are phenomenal -- NO pixelation -- i.e., virtually all Web sites seem to take advantage of the 1080 resolution of the HD TV.  The built-in Netflix app works very nicely, too; it has more useful functionality than the app in the DVD player we previously used for streaming movies, and it saves having two appliances turned on at once.Overall, for ease of use though, if I want to use a Web browser for very long, it saves time just to move to a computer or to use an HDMI connection from a netbook with a wireless keyboard and mouse.  That works flawlessly.  Bottom line:  the Web browser has proven satisfactory only for brief Internet forays when one doesn't want to move away from the TV.  If this function is important, a buyer would probably be better off waiting for a TV with a built-in browser that comes with a remote keyboard/mouse.  If that's not important, buy this LG TV, as Amazon's price [when I purchased] was better than anywhere else, and the packing box arrived without a scratch on it.", "Date": "August 27, 2011"}, {"Title": "High Picture Quality for a Value LED TV", "Author": "Ham Milby", "ReviewID": "R14USDFVUVPCQ7", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "My first option was to get a Samsung LED, but my budget is less than $1000.

The documentation and included software for DLNA is for Windows PCs. I am a Mac person! I have some issues with the DLNA, but whether they are limitations of LG's DLNA implementation or issues because I have a Mac, I am not sure. The documentation mentions some limitations: 1000 files and folders, a wired connection is recommended rather than Wi-Fi, etc. I was using wi-fi, for which they say there may be restrictions on some functions.2. Documentation doesn't explain everything I needed to know. However, email help via LG's website gave reply in less than 24 hours (once it worked. The first time it gave me a \"Website not available due to server maintenance job\" message after I typed in my entire query!)Update: Having tried some Web surfing, I find it is a bit tedious to set up URLs and login to accounts because data entry is somewhat awkward.

The previous review is correct: no HuluPlus.  I too thought that LG Smart TV would have Hulu since I saw it advertised.  However, after further research, I learned that Hulu is developing an app for LG TV's which is expected to come out this fall (2011).  Disappointing, but at least they weren't completely lying.2. The Wii-like remote is cool, but its response time isn't nearly as good as a Wii.  We've adjusted it to a faster level, but it's not as smooth as Wii.  Still cool though.3. I expected the home screen to be more easily modified, but from what I can tell it's not possible to customize it to the degree that I'd like.  All you can do is select which apps show in two different boxes.  Which leads me to our greatest disappointment...4. The apps are pathetic. I was expecting more than a lame rendition of Sudoku, a few movie apps, and two major league sports channels. Hopefully there will be more weather/news/sports apps coming soon. Not to mention HULU!The upside: If LG gets their act together with these apps, this could be a pretty nice TV.My conclusion: I'm not sure we made the right decision purchasing this model before the technologies were perfected.  Lesson learned.UPDATE:  LG Apps now include some possibly pornographic material, and I have not yet figured out a way to delete these from our main menu.

Point is: just pay for a new TV, the TV you get used is too much crap to risk it being a brick, unless you really like shipping things back an forth.These TV's will ship by a company called \"CEVA\" because they are pricey.

This is truly a case of you don't know what you don't know.  The clarity of the picture was AMAZING.  Both the front and the back of all scenes were crisp.  Motion was fantastic.  Sound was good...not sure if I can call it great but I've only seen one movie.  I haven't accessed the internet feature yet.The movie was played with a Samsung blueray player BD-C5500 available earlier 2011 (~$190?).Looks like 5500 is my new favorite number :)Now I upgraded from a 19\" tube TV that was 10 years old so it was like going from a bike to a Lexus.  It is my first flat screen TV.  I waited over a year for the prices to come down to get these features (brand name 42\"/1080/120/LED/Internet) and it was SO worth the wait.  Nobody can believe I got this TV for under $800, myself included.There was trouble with the sound with the provided yellow/white/red cables and it continued despite another identical cable I had.  A $30 GE HDMI/HDMI cable from WalMart solved it and *also* allowed for the TV to be flush against the wall.  With the provided triple cable I would *not* have been able to use this mount as those cable plugs are perpendicular to the back of the unit and push the TV away from the wall (unlike the HDMI and USB sockets which are placed laterally).Kudos to OmniMount for the no-brainer template with their EZ mount $45 bracket available at hhgregg (OM# 1100149).  I love my new TV but I was not paying much for a bracket.  (Now I could care less about representation on schematics but they have an its-about-time female carpenter in their manual and template that made me smile.)  This template made sure I hit the studs on both sides although I did use a stud finder to confirm.  I definitely used a smaller drill bit that the one provided.The TV looked very good on the stand provided btw if you have a surface that can handle the 43lb weight.Although I have used the magic wand remote only once it will obviously not be difficult as I figured out how to get to channel 3 for programming to get the movie up and running for guests.I would give yourself 1-2 hours to take measurements, put up the bracket, align the TV with a friend's help and get a grasp on the menu before inviting guests over, lol.

Great image quality, lots of internet features, Amazon and Netflix are options that I was looking for when I bought it. I was also  looking for Skype TV but apparently is not in their app store yet.They also should fix login problems in their Facebooke, Picasa and Twitter app (even though you select the option for remembering your login they never remember it). It was easy to ensemble and setup. Maybe they should improve the options for setting up the time and date, the automatic option never seems to work so I decide to put it manually.The menu is very intuitive and easy to navigate and the second remote control is almost perfect, it only requires a few improvement in recalibrating it and avoiding it to lost calibration (but you can leave the way it is now).It recognize  2 external hard drives that I have attached to my router automatically, so no setup trouble for this.In terms of web navigation it is great (the secondary remote helps a lot here). I look a lot of ONLINE TV content from abroad and the only minus is that they have to update the browser with the latest FLASH PLAYER CODEC because there are LOTS of websites that you can not watch because of this. This should be easy to solve with a simple software update.I would review this TV with 5 stars if I didn't have to deal with this TERRIBLE ANNOYING SCREEN that says: \"CONNECTING WIRED LAN CABLE/ Wired network is not set. Do you want to set wired network? (wireless network is disconnected when wired network is connected): YES or NOT\". I have selected YES, NOT, EXIT (in the remote) unsuccessfully. The worst part is that it appears intermittently so if you click no or exit it reapers after 10 or 20 seconds again and again. So you can imagine how uncomfortable the whole experience should be.I call LG customer service and they treated me great and without hassle scheduled a technician visit. They came to my house as scheduled and didn't know hot to solve the issue so they suggest me to move the TV to the lower floor of our house (where the router is) in order to fix the problem or at least evaluate is that was the problem. I let them know that I was going to do that just because of the second premise because it might be absurd to think that the problem is caused by the lack of wired connection. I connected it wired to my router and nothing change.So I am right know in the dilemma of calling back LG customer service or waiting until a collaborative soul read this email and suggest me a plan of action in order to solve the problem adjusting something in the setup. I have to add that I Google the error message and didn't found good clues to solve the problem. But I'm sure I'm not the only one with this problem so I'm hopeful about receiving some help. I also have to add that I'm technologically talking very literate.Without exageration this TV desserves a 5 stars review but the error screen ruined it.JRE", "Date": "September 20, 2011"}, {"Title": "Great TV, Worthless everthing else it attempts to be", "Author": "Naiwt Kram \"Sam\"", "ReviewID": "R2PXPUXTF88L2G", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "TV picture quality is great, in fact everything from a TV standpoint is great.

I agree with everyone who says all the LG Internet apps suck, except Netflix in my opinion.  I took a long look at Roku today for the first time, and it has more things than you can use and it's superior to the LG apps, in my opinion.  Even Netflix is better on the Roku, than built into this TV.  The picture is great, probably because I don't know any better with this being my first HD LCD TV.  Setup was easy, and fast.

First of all the good points: Picture quality is excellent and very easy setup.  I also really like the Wand for entering text.  Now, on to the negatives.  First of all, I don't like the location of the HDMI connectors.  They are on the side of the TV so the cable is exposed.  Not a really big deal though.  The sound quality is also poor but that was expected with any flat panel TV.  We purchased a Yamaha soundbar and solved that problem.  I suppose my biggest disappointment is the lack of support for Adobe Flash 10.  The web browser that comes with this TV only supports Adobe Flash 8 so many sites that I visit don't work as they require Adobe Flash.  You can't download the flash on your own so the only solution is for LG to provide a software upgrade for the TV.  I called customer service today and asked when such a software upgrade would be available and was told they don't know.  This is totally unacceptable to sell a Smart TV with such old software and then not have a schedule for the upgrade.  I'm a software programmer and we put out updates every 6 months for our customer products.

We had been looking for another brand but when we were in Sears the LG Rep was there checking on the new stock that had just come in. While this TV was not yet set up to access the internet she assured us it would get Pandora and in December 2011 would get FREE Hulu so we purchased it. I decided to call LG customer service after we got it home to ask them about Pandora and Free Hulu, they couldnt answer any questions about the TV beings it was new to the market. I found one rep that knew more about this TV than anyone else, he was going to call me back after talking to their technical staff....  but he never called back. We get updates pushed to us once every couple of weeks and we are hoping beyond hope that in December 2011 we will have free Hulu available. I tried to ask the Pandora and Hulu question at LG.com but they refused to post my question about Hulu and allowed me to post the question about Pandora (which still goes unanswered as of today, seems like LG staff should be answering these questions!)So, if it is important for you to access the internet to watch movies and or listen to Pandora this TV might not be for you at this time. This TV does have internet music from all over the world....  not sure why Pandora is excluded.YouTube - The TV gets some YouTube vidios, but we have not been able to figure out why, when you actually go to YouTube.com you cant play anything due to Flash issues. To be honest some of the YouTube vidios that this LG TV gets is offensive.The TV has no lighting issues (black/side light) and actually the screen is better for us because it is none glossy like other flat screen tvs. The sound is good enough for us, BUT we plan on purchasing a sound bar that can also handle an iPod.Remotes are great, comes with two of them so my husband can use one and I can use the other. We like the Wii style controller, tooks a bit to figure it out (we are old :-)) but now we find that it is the preferred remote to use.

I had done quite a bit of research on flat panels and already owned a plasma and several LCDs. I focused on LEDs, such as this one, as they are thinner and take less power. There are few 42\" LEDs from which to choose, and I was replacing an LG 42\"LCD, so I was comfortable going with LG, though the myriad of waht seemed to be similar models was confusing. The user manual covrered multiple models, there was no 'quick set-up' for jsut the 5500. Regardless, set up of the 5500 went ok, but be patient and allow time. I found navigating through the Menu set-up which was buried  among all of the Internet menu choices to be distracting and more difficult than necessary. Setting up the wireless connectivity went fine, but I had set up other devices on my network, so I knew what I was doing, though it was not clear from the instructions that set up required a USB plug in device, but it you have any experience at these things, it is not a big problem. The biggest disappointment thus far is that the picture did not have the clarity and wow factor that I had seen on my LCDs. I played with the settings, but could not seem to get the picture to be any more than average. I had read about the screen defects LG had experienced and thought that I had gotten one of the flawed, lower quality screens. Trying to get help from LG service was very disappointing. If you have to use it, the focus is on the Web and self service. A lot of effort to ask the right question and use their knowledgeware system. I kept the box and was preparing to return it, when I decided to work through the tedious menu to get to a screen where settings could be adjsuted manually. The factory settings are geared to energy savings and a muted picture. After a number of trial and error efforts, I was able to get the picture to have an appearance that I liked. My issue is that it should not be so difficult to set up a digital TV. I don't have this TV set up with a home theatre system, but the audio settings did not appear any easier to use and the explanations of how to do so also looked to be lacking. Overall, a lot of nice features, many of which I have not used as yet, but glad that I have them. For example, the Magic Wand remote seems to work well, but just haven't seen the need as yet. With the picture now set to my satisfaction, I am now pleased with the set. Unfortunate that it was so difficult and time-consuming for me to get there.

I am now using that as a computer monitor.  So this TV is a huge leap into the 21st century for me.  I wanted a Smart TV and I wanted an LG.  I found this model at a price I couldn't pass up.  This thing is SWEET!!!  I can go to any web site I want to, I have watched You Tube videos, I've played games.....  Doing that on my TV is something I didn't even imagine doing.  The only reason I don't give this TV 5 starts is the on-screen keyboard.  You have no choice but to use it.  LG \"Does not plan\" to ever offer a way to pair a wireless keyboard with this TV, per their tech support on LG forums.  Bummer.  I spent $50 on a sweet keyboard and laser mouse to pair with this TV, and then I discover the forums and that bad news.  I cannot return the keyboard because it is not defective.  So there will be no internet shopping on this TV.  Can you imagine entering shipping and billing addresses (mine are not the same), credit card numbers, phone numbers, passwords to PayPal, etc., by pointing to each individual character with a remote and clicking the button???  Not to mention having to change the keyboard for numbers, symbols, and uppercase.  That is what you have to do with this TV. Otherwise it's awesome.  I can't get the picture quite as sharp as I want, and most shows don't fill the screen no matter which aspect ratio I choose.  But I'm fairly sure that when I watch that first science fiction DVD I'm going to be blown away.  It found my wireless network without me doing a thing, updated everything by itself, walked me through how to do what I needed to, and I was watching in just a few minutes.  Oh, and I'm 55 years old and live alone, so, yea.  Pretty slick.  Sound is fine for me; some posts I've seen have said it's not good enough.  My TV is not mounted on the wall, so speakers are not blocked.  I recommend this as long as you don't care about not being able to use a keyboard.  I'm hoping something will come down the pike soon for that, as I have seen dozens of complaints about that.  I'm trying now to load PLEX NINE on my PC so I can share media from my PC to the TV.

I had already bought an LG 32\" for the bedroom, and it's performance was good to very good.  That set's life was tragically cut short with a lightning-strike to our satellite dish.  This 42\" set, however, produced a so-so picture out of the box, and it's audio quality was among the worst that I've ever experienced from a flat-panel TV (believe it or not, the audio on the 32\" was way better).  Since there's no external audio system in the bedroom, and the 400x400 VESA mounting pattern on the new set was also incompatible with my wall mount, I decided to send it back.Moral(s) of the story: (1) Most flat-panel TVs have barely acceptable audio quality, even for the 6PM news; and (2) judging by this set, the super-thin LED models are likely to have even worse audio; and (3) do your homework prior to purchase.

If you have 16:9 content on a 4:3 channel, this TV will not allow you to enlarge the picture to fill the screen correctly.  You either have a smaller rectangle centered on screen, or you use the \"Cinema Zoom\" which stretches the picture left & right more than up and down, so the aspect ratio is off.I have tried discussing this issue with LG customer support, but they insist on deferring the problem to the cable company and cable box.

The so-called browser can't handle any web page that has Flash Video - so why on earth would you want it on your TV?  The only solution is to connect up a laptop.  LG should do better than this - or at the very least they should prominently disclose that the browser web function is useless.  And the proprietary interface on their selected sources, like Youtube, is also appalling.  I'm extremely disappointed in this product.", "Date": "November 14, 2011"}, {"Title": "its ok i guess.", "Author": "electronicsfan", "ReviewID": "R2IS4I09L26RWD", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "looked at many tvs. chose this one because it has a 2.4ms response time. I cant stand the led inability to handle motion so this was a major point for me. I have a plasma in the living room and needed one for the bedroom. Its ok. Picture is ok. Sound is ok. nothing above average about this tv. As a secondary tv it is fine. SD looks ok. HD looks ok(pales in comparison to the plasma) not sure if i am keeping it. but i will say the smart features and the magic wand remote are only a novelty and have no real value or add any value to the tv itself.", "Date": "August 1, 2011"}, {"Title": "LG 55\"  5500 HDTV is Grrrrreat!", "Author": "rosietheriviter", "ReviewID": "R3MYEYK3BI7SOL", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "We already enjoyed an LG 42\" HDTV and found it much simpler to use than the Sony Bravia.

Liu", "ReviewID": "R3770XF0GVYDQH", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "I bought the 42LV5500 mainly for the Youtube feature. However, when I first started the Youtube app, it plays a music video \"Fxxk Everything\". My kids were watching and I had to immediately shut down the TV. For the whole day on Saturday (7/30/11), it played the same music video when the app started up.On Sunday, it played another video full of talks using the Fxxk word. What's wrong with LG. If you want to start playing a random video when the app starts, play something more appropriate for the whole family. It's best to let the users choose what they want to watch instead of randomly pick some junk video to play. Besides, it takes a lot longer to start the app in order to load a random video at start. Another complaint I have with the 42LV5500 is that if I connect the composite video (antenna) input to the output of a DirecTV receiver and use Channel 3 or 4, the video looks double similar to 3-D video without glasses. I use one DirecTV receiver to feed multiple TVs using the analog coaxial cable thru Channel 3 or 4. The web browser is also very slow and unresponsive. The smart remote controller is also bad because it lost connection frequently so the pointer disappears just when you want to hit enter. I don't use other features of the TV. If you want to buy this TV and feed an analog signal thru channel 3 or 4, don't buy it. If you want to use it mainly for the Youtube feature, don't buy it.", "Date": "August 1, 2011"}, {"Title": "Value vs. Quality", "Author": "Lg", "ReviewID": "R7YMQMWKJWVWQ", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "Middle of the road set.1.
