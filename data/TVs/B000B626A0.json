I found a way to double it as a computer monitor. It works fine. I was a little hesitant since it is a refurbished item, but it has definitely proven its quality. I currently have it hanging on my wall. It was a definite upgrade from my old 13 in tv....", "Date": "January 18, 2008"}, {"Title": "Do not waste your $", "Author": "abby's mama", "ReviewID": "RQQ65H7Q8M6TJ", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "We bought this tv in Sept. 2006.  It stopped working completely in July 2007, so we contacted Polaroid for help since it has a 1 yr warranty.  Customer service is terrible.  You spend 30 min on hold to reach someone, then they tell you they are not repairing this model, they will replace it, BUT we have to pay shipping and we have to wait for their corporate office to call us back with details on how to return it.  It's been a month & we're still waiting to hear from them.  We've called several times and sent an email.  Very disappointed.  Do not waste your time and money.  We will never buy this brand again.", "Date": "August 21, 2007"}, {"Title": "It's Okay, but Customer Service sucks", "Author": "Angela Johnson", "ReviewID": "R2SG8PX6L03EBZ", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "We bought this TV 2 years ago for my son.  This TV was for his bedroom, we went away for Christmas so we unplugged everything, when we got home he tried to plug his TV in and the ac adapter that the TV uses died.  For over a month now we have been looking for a replacement plug, which no one sells, Polaroid states that there is a 60 day backorder for the ac adapter.  Plus it is $70 with shipping.  Also when I called customer service all they would say is that it is out of warrenty I can ship it back to them for them to fix or fix it on my own.So just keep in mind the customer servoce and the picture is not that clear, I have seen better!", "Date": "February 1, 2008"}, {"Title": "Good Picture...Bad accessibility", "Author": "Mr. Jason R. Gauthier \"The Series Maniac\"", "ReviewID": "R5FGXZJITSO76", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "This TV has decent picture. I have had it for almost 3 years coming this Christmas and have not had any problems. My only pet peeve is that when I am changing channels it takes forever to load to the next channel. It is tedious work to change channels because the picture takes forever to come onto the screen. Other than this it is great: has 2 A/V jacks which are very useful. Overall, a decent TV but would not buy again if I had a second chance.", "Date": "November 25, 2007"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "Unavailable", "Features": "20\" Standard View LCD display\n1080i/720p/480p/480i Digital Compatibility\nStereo speakers plus integrated virtual surround sound\nBuilt-in 181-channel cable tuner\nIncludes full-function remote control", "Name": "Polaroid FLM-2011 20-Inch LCD Tv", "ImgURL": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41TFPHDVVQL._SX300_.jpg", "ProductID": "B000B626A0"}}
