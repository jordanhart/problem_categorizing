I recieved this tv because of a warrenty replacement for my Samsung LN32A550. My old tv was making a lot of weird noises and was disturbing my sleep since it was placed in my bedroom. Any way Samsung replaced it finally. This new tv has a much better picture and sound then the previous one. My old tv was A model which I am told is the middle type of panel. This new one is a S model, so I think that has some thing to do with picture being much better on this on. THis tv also has 4 times as much dynamic contrast ratio. My old one had 15,000 contrast ratio and this new one has 60,000. Although the overall design, picture and sound quality is better in this new one, there are a lot of features that Samsung took out from the 2008 (A model) which I really liked. The LN32A550 had picture in picture, headphone jack, lighted remote and a usb port of picture and music files. Also the older model also had 2 component inputs and a 5ms response time. The new tv doesnt have any of these features. It has only 1 component input and the response time is now 6ms. Oveall great tv. I think the new model is also lighter then the older one. It also has square shaped swivel stand and there no inputs on the side. I do wish the 2009 (b model) had some of the older features like the extra component input, picture in picture and the usb port for music and picture files. This tv also blows the competition away, especially when compared to the Sony KDL-32S5100. I got a chance to try this tv out since I was offered it as a choice for my warranty replacement from the retailer where I originally purchased my Samsung TV. Ive got to say the picture and sound on it were no where near this new Samsung tv. The blacks are so much darker and the colors are a lot more vibrant and bright. I am really glad I stuck with Samsung in the end. Samsung really gives you a good deal for what you pay for.Update after 3 years of usage: Well this tv starting making the same clicking noises after just one year of owning it. In the beginning it wasnt so bad but now its pretty loud. Normally this wouldnt bother me but this tv is in my bedroom and it makes clicking sounds for about the first hour or two after its been switched off. Its funny because this tv replaced my older tv by Samsung which had the exact same issue.  I have had a number of issues with the Samsung products in the last 3-4 years. My first tv bought in 2008 had the clicking sound. Then Samsung replaced it in 2009 and now that one is also make the clicking sound. Ive owned 4 Samsung blu ray player which also had quality control issues. More recently I tried 3 Samsung galaxy note 10.1 tablets they all had creaking and clicking sounds. Also my recently purchased samsung galaxy s3. I had to exchange because a loose power button and other issues. Samsung makes great products, with lots of features at an affordable price. But the build quality and quality control issues make me want to purchase other products.", "Date": "November 5, 2009"}, {"Title": "Great TV for the money.", "Author": "Daniel Jardim", "ReviewID": "R2P0WVK0TLB85A", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This TV is great with HDMI sources. I'm having some trouble with my standard def cable. The whole image keeps tilting from right to left and left to right, happends like once in 3 mins. This only happens when I use the composite (Yellow, red and white) cables. When I connect something to the TV using the HDMI inputs, it works flawlessly. So I dont know whats the deal with it. Doesn't matter anyways, because I'm getting HD cable soon and it'll use a HDMI input instead of standard low def cable.In other areas this TV is great! The picture quality is awesome! Very nicely packaged in the manufacture box. The remote is kinda huge, but its not a problem.

I read so much about LCD and visited many retailers that had this product and the competing products.  So in the showroom I got to see the pictures side by side.  It was very apparent immediately that the Samsung picture was far superior to all of the other LCD TVs in its class.  I thought perhaps it had something to do with the signal or the settings of the television so I was a little skeptical.  To my delight, the TV was everything that I hoped for.  First of all the picture is outstanding.  The blacks are dark black the whites are pure white and all of the colors same as vivid as reality.  Since it has a built in QAM tuner, I was able to plug it in to my coaxial cable from my wall and tune 100 stations including the high definition channels.  Setup was easy by choosing the automatic option and it found all of the stations at once.  Even the standard definition stations looked far superior than they did on my old set.  Since this TV was specifically for my bedroom where I had no cable box I promptly ordered a set top box to receive high definition broadcasts .  It is truly amazing, of the picture is much better than my 46 inch living room LCD by a different manufacturer.  Noticeably superior.  The only negative I can say about this TV is that the speakers are very mediocre, but in so much that this is a 1080p flat panel it is presumed that you will hook it up to an exterior sound device. So you should.  The picture quality is stunning from corner to corner; if you will be amazed.  I am so pleased with this purchase.  As you can see in the other reviews the TV has all the hookups that you can imagine.  Three HDMI, component, and coaxial.  It has an exterior digital output options, but lacks USB and film card inputs.  No big deal.  I have connected this TV to my PC of via and HDMI cable and can watch bluRay movies that play on my PC.  I cannot imagine a single thing that I would add to this TV if I designed it myself.", "Date": "December 3, 2009"}, {"Title": "GREAT!", "Author": "L. B.

Even the SD broadcasts do not look that bad on this tv.  Sound quality is decent but I hear to get the best audio, set up a surround sound speaker system.

Reid", "ReviewID": "R3A0ID15JWOB5D", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This is my second Samsung.  The first one was a 27 incher, my first HDTV.  I bought it for my bedroom and I was a little ignorant about sizes.  Since the prior tube TV had been a 19 inch I thought 27 would be large enough.  I really liked the 27 incher but wanted a larger screen.  So I bought the 32 inch in the same brand, since I was very happy with the features, images and general workings of the first.  Soon after I got a Samsung Blu Ray player.  This combination is terrific for watching DVD's, even those not Blu Ray.  My only quibble is that it does not digitally enlarge the screen for some shows that get broadcast in little hi res boxes.", "Date": "January 30, 2010"}, {"Title": "samsung LCD", "Author": "Robert Ahlstorm \"Seabass\"", "ReviewID": "RBVNDZZHFJZMM", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Samsung really does make great TV's.

All the football games would be missed as this is our only TV.  The extended warranty took over and the repair shop STILL has the Panasonic.  (Since it's warranty, everything has to be approved and....well, keep that in mind when buying the warranty.  It takes a lot of time.)  So I bought the Samsung after tons of research.  It was down to the Sony Bravia, Sharp Aquos, and the Samsung LN32B540.  I had considered others like the Sylvania (Funai) set, but decided on the Samsung 540.  (The 540 is 720P and I was getting it as a temp for the den until the Panasonic returns, then the new TV goes into the bedroom.  You don't really need 1080p in 32\" so why spend the money?)  I go to Sam's Club where the 540 is $447.  Looks amazing and the picture is really great.  60K:1 resolution is the key, not 1080P, for this screen size.  As I'm walking away with the 540, there's a rack with TVs on, and not really being displayed.  These are returns.  There amongst the Vizio's and Magnavox's is a Samsung LN32B530 for $3...  Well, I won't say how much but it wasn't $400.  Wow.  What a picture, and because I had done the research, I knew the guts.  The set looked brand new except for some dust.  It still had the display stickers on it that you peal off.  Why anyone returned this set, I won't know.  No remote, not manual, no cables.  No problem.  I bought the Samsung BD-P1590 Blu-ray player and there's my remote and HDMI cable.  The family loves it.  My kids want to keep this TV for themselves.  \"Go get another one, dad.\"  Yikes, now I've done it.  Oh, and about the TV remote and manual...  The manual is a free download from the Samsung website.  I called Samsung and they're sending me a remote for free!  The Samsung people were awesome.  No thousand buttons and automated nice voices to weed through.  Try getting through to a person at Ballys Total Fitness.Now if I can just get my Panasonic back.

Wow!", "Author": "Robert Flynn", "ReviewID": "R19HPZ5EHTUPZT", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "My wife and I bought two Sony Bravia HDTVs through Amazon.  We were very unimpressed and disappointed, and sent both back.  I kept hearing about how\" Samsung blows Sony away, including from a buddy at work (who's girlfriend bought one and raves about it).  After reading reviews online, we bought two of the 32\" Samsungs.  We hooked them up yesterday (I should say after years of Direct TV, we just switched to Veriozon FIOS, which is FAR superior).I had to post this 24 hours later because I am BLOWN AWAY with the quality of these units, and the resulting smooth as ice picture quality.Pros:  1.  Set up was incredibly easy.  The directions are great, to include setting up the remotes.  Simply a snap.2.  The picture is the best I have ever seen anywhere.  I watching ESPN HD right now, and I joked with my wife that I don't remember seeing games in person looking this clear and crisp.  WOW!3.  The sound is fantastic.4.  To expand on above, the TV set up with the universal remote that comes with the HD Set Top Box from Verizon FIOS, merged like peanut butter and jelly.  No problems at all.I cannot rate this any higher.Cons:  NONE period.  I love everything about these.  Samsung, you have a new customer.", "Date": "March 23, 2010"}, {"Title": "Near perfect", "Author": "Nameless Faceless User", "ReviewID": "R2Y8RGWRS61QBH", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This set had all the features I wanted.  I needed to replace my old 27inch JVC CRT TV with a 32inch LCD.  Aside from being a bit wider, it occupies about the same amount of space.  Samsung wasn't the first brand I looked at but after reading great reviews on picture quality and reliability I went with them.  This set has 3 HDMI inputs, VGA input, component, as well as composite.  The next model up provides another composite video input on the side and claims to have a better picture.  There is no s-video input.  The nicest feature is the analog audio output - plain vanilla left and right.  I don't have any plans to add a digital 5.1 digital THX certified sound system in my bedroom.  I have a pair of bookshelf speakers and a low-end stereo receiver.  While the set has digital audio out, I just needed slightly better sound which this provided easily.The HD resolution does not disappoint.  The colors are vivid and natural.  The first issue I had was that there didn't seem to be enough contrast and the blacks weren't that black.  I was wondering if I should have gone one model higher since the picture looked a little washed out.  I tried the backlight, brightness, and contrast settings but was still feeling a little unsatisfied.  Fear not!  I found the 'Advanced Settings' and tweaked the picture to total perfection.The next gotcha comes from the cable company.  To view a cablebox with HDMI outputs you need a 'special' tuner.  And I was unable to view any of the channels without a box on my old JVC after we switched to digital television.  The cable company requires another type of 'special' tuner to view unscrambled channels directly, which is required if I want to take advantage of the on-timers to wake up to the news in the morning. I selected automatic channel setup on the Samsung and it took care of everything - proving it to be slightly smarter than I am.  The HDMI input worked and it discovered channels which I can access without a box which I never knew I had.  Very impressive.  It found analog, digital, and alternate programming channels then began filling in the channel names as they became available.  Another nice feature was the on-timer which I could set to only come on during weekdays.There are subtle nice features which I appreciate as well.  The message for 'No Signal' moves around the screen so it doesn't cause screen burn-in.  It remembers the picture size for channels, even when going through the HDMI input.  And there are two zoom and pan modes plus stretching and filling options switch between all the available picture formats.  You still need to watch for screen burn-in according to the manual so fill the screen with the picture whenever possible.Watching a full 1080i animated feature on this set was the next best thing to 3D.  I thought the characters were going to jump out of the screen.  The reverse is true as well.  If you're still watching old VHS tapes on this set you will see what you've been missing i.e. you can never go home again.", "Date": "March 14, 2010"}, {"Title": "Great TV", "Author": "L. Yagami", "ReviewID": "R3OYPX2W7RIMOT", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I bought this television from Amazon.com just before Black Friday for $497 and change. I was very excited when it arrived at my home and I immediately set it up because I wanted to see what the hype over HDTVs were about. I did do a bit of research on this television and was aware of some of the specs and considered it to be the better choice for the price range I was looking at. I added an HDTV/Cable amplifier working in concert with the Samsung's built tuner and it was able to pick up additional channels some of which broadcasted in up to 1080i. The picture quality is absolutely phenominal and you can see every detail especially in scenes where there's a close-up on an actor, or actress. I have also watched blu-rays on this tv through a PS3 and the picture quality is also very good, let me rephrase that,EXCELLENT. With HDMI-CEC you can also control (with the tv's remote) devices that are connected to the tv with an HDMI cable. I was able to control my PS3 console with it, though it has some limitations. On the PS3 screensaver where you may be required to press the \"triangle\" button (\"options\"), you'll not be able to do so using the tv's remote. Also on DVD/Blu-Ray control screens, the remote does not repond to corresponding commands, for example pressing \"play\" to play the movie. You have to fiddle around with the remote a bit to figure out the controls. Example the \"Enter\" is used for play/pause. However, those flaws aren't important to me. This is a good quality tv for a low price. Do yourself a favor and buy it.
