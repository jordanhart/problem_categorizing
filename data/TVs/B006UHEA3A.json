{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Fantastic Deal!", "Author": "Ren \"Ren\"", "ReviewID": "R3OOA2X0TDD8W", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "We have a 65\" LG LCD 3D Smart tv.  It was time to upgrade the tv in our bedroom and I really wanted another 3d tv w/wireless similar to the LG, at a good price.  I was surprised that for the price this is a bundle. I contacted the seller who confirmed it as a 42\" 3D LCD TV, with 3D bluray player, HDMI cable, 4 pairs of 3D glasses (2 higher end) and all remotes and cords; nothing missing.  We received it on 05/09 and my husband set it up in our bedroom.  It hooked up to our existing surround sound system with no problems.  The set is brand new.  This set has no scuffs, scratches on it whatsoever.  I had seen the Vizio brand sold at the leading warehouse store and the picture quality in-store looked comparable to the higher priced models.  This set is no different.  The picture quality at 2d and 3d is excellent; the color is vibrant and the HD quality sharp.  The tv is wireless & was easy to hook up to our network.  The 3d bluray player has Netflix, Vudu, Amazon, etc. but requires an ethernet connection (is not wireless).  The TV however has wifi and is wireless so no problem receiving Netflix, Vudu, etc. to the tv.  We watched Thor and some other 3D movies on the set and they were as good as at the movies.  This is a passive 3D set (same as the 3d type used at the movies) and uses the same type of 3D glasses, which are lightweight & hassle free (no recharging or high cost to buy additional glasses or to replace).  Linking to Netflix, Amazon & Vudu are as quick as pressing the desired button on the remote.  The only downside is our little one has decided to homestead in our bedroom now, choosing to use the Netflix feature to watch Spongebob, Woody Woodpecker, etc. here instead of the family room.", "Date": "May 16, 2012"}, {"Title": "Great Value", "Author": "Justice Prevails", "ReviewID": "R355UFF4IH5UU6", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I bought this TV from Walmart for about $100 more then its advertised here but I would still like o say its a great value the 3D feature is fantastic and built in Wifi for online apps is another great feature ... nothing like Pandora playing digital music thru my 5.1 surround system!", "Date": "May 8, 2012"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "$799.99", "Features": null, "Name": "Vizio 42-inch Class LCD 1080p 120Hz 3D HDTV - E3DB420VX", "ImgURL": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41c7PTXTuoL._SY300_.jpg", "ProductID": "B006UHEA3A"}}
