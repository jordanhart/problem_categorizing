{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Startling clarity, detail, and color", "Author": "Mike", "ReviewID": "R184I8AEX964NN", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Had my Samsung UN55B8000 TV a couple of weeks now. It has more than lived up to the hype. Hooked it up and put on a blu-ray disk. Even the delivery guy's jaw dropped, and he's delivered/set up hundreds of TVs.TV is only inch and half thick and only weighs 60 pounds or so.In fact, it is sometimes almost too good. When viewing people on HD you can see every little mole, scar, wrinkle, stray hair, makeup, five o'clock shadow, makeup line, etc. I'm sitting here watching the news and I can clearly see tiny pieces of lint on the guy's black suit. I'm guessing the talking heads of tomorrow are all going to have to have much better complexions.If you like to tweak your TV this one provides a lot of different controls. There are already some websites that will give you what they consider good tweaks to maximize the pic. You can also look for the B7000 tweaks. Looks pretty darn fantastic right out of the box so if you aren't a techie, don't worry about it.Sounds..not particularly good or bad, but I don't want TV speakers taking up space anyway. If you are going to spend this kind of money for a TV you should be using your stereo system.Some reviewers were complaining about the number of inputs. Again, how many is enough. I run my PS3, XBOX360, IPOD, and the Dish box through my Denon and so I only use one HDMI.You can plug it into the internet. No set-up, just plug it in. First thing it did was download 12 updates to itself. Have no idea what they did but ...didn't cause any problems. It automatically loads up some of Yahoo's widgets. Fun to try but...not something I have really gone back and used much. Also has some built in content...recipes, artwork, etc. that I haven't bothered to look at.You can plug in USB drives and view content directly off the drive.I long ago got rid of my roof antenna. I bought a little Turk indoor antenna and plugged that in so I can pop over into over-the-air signals and watch TV. It will automatically search and find the on-air channels. It even downloads some kind of TV guide from the internet for the channels it finds.I also wanted to see if there was any signal degradation from Dish. I haven't noticed the HD degradation with Dish that I had with Comcast. The way Comcast packed the HD signals you could see a real difference between OTA and the packed pics.Samsung also provides software which allows you to use your PC as a server. Then you can display your pics, music, etc on the TV. Took a little playing around but was easy compared to some of the others I've tried to use.I've played games with both my PS3 and the XBOX360. No problems. No pixelating. Did not bother to change TV over to game mode. I haven't fooled around with the 240Hz function. I just leave it on standard.I'm sure there are other features I haven't tried. With the ability to update itself over the internet I have no doubt they will teach it even more amazing tricks.I've set up my Harmony 880 Pro to control all my devices including the IPOD. IPOD menu/info will display (through my Denon) on the TV.All of the above features are great but the main thing is... the picture is just absolutely mind-blowing wonderful.So, fantastic TV. I am VERY happy with it. Obviously I highly recommend it.((Now I'm watching Wall-E in HD and it is pretty amazing.))", "Date": "May 31, 2009"}, {"Title": "WOW!", "Author": "Kalibr", "ReviewID": "R1MTFZJCCAM2B2", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I have owned Sony televisions exclusively for the past 30 years. I was in the market for a new TV to replace my older Sony 50\" Grand WEGA LCD projection set. I always keep up with new technologies in consumer electronics and knew that LED backlighting was the way to go. One day, I visited Best Buy to see the new Sony models. I was particularly interested in the Sony Bravia XBR8 LED TV. It has an awesome display, but I couldn't bring myself to part with $5K for a TV. The high price was a big disappointment. I knew Samsung made LED models so I decided to check them out too. I was immediately floored. They looked far better than Sony's more expensive LED model and for $2K less. But, was I really willing to purchase something other than a Sony TV? I would have to be convinced. I did a lot of research on these Samsung sets. I demoed them in several stores and read as many reviews as possible. IMO, the Samsung LED TVs are by far the best technology currently available. Their display must be seen to be believed. Most impressive of all, is the fact that Samsung accomplished this in a set that is only 1.2\" thick.Well, I was finally convinced and decided to purchase the Samsung UN55B8000. I have owned it for almost a month now and I am in awe every time I watch it. This set is beautiful even when it's turned off. But, you won't want to turn it off because the clarity, detail, brightness, contrast and color are absolutely exceptional. For the first time I have owned a TV, I did not have to make any adjustments to the factory settings - it looked perfect right out of the box. In fact, I had purchased a calibration DVD and was surprised to find that I didn't have to make any adjustment to any controls.Of course, the most amazing thing about this set and what intially lured me to it is its picture quality. It's difficult to explain the level of detail it produces. I have HD cable programming (1080i), which looks fantastic. Games on the Xbox 360 pops out at you. But the images produced from a Blu-ray source is absolutely breath-taking. I was also pleasantly surprised at how bright the display looks in my sunlit family room. I thought I would have to adjust the brightness to view the set in daylight and again when watching at night as I did with our old Sony TV. Although the screen on the UN55B8000 has a gloss finish, it does a great job of reducing glare and reflections.I do want to respond to the negative comments that others have posted here regarding uneven backlighting or vignetting effect caused by the edge-lit LEDs when the TV displays dark images. The only time I notice this was when the set displays a totally black background such as in movie credits. At best, it appears as a very faint illumination from the corner. But even then, I really had to look for it. I don't think this is an issue at all; at least not one that should deter anyone from purchasing this incredible TV. I have to assume that those that have experienced this anomaly are probably looking at an uncalibrated set that has its brightness level turned way too high.I took advantage of the slim design of this set and purchased the ultra slim wall mount. The TV hangs like a picture frame and looks like a masterpiece, which it is. The slim case houses adequate speakers, producing fairly good sound quality for normal TV viewing. Of course, you would want to watch movies through a surround sound system.As for the other features of this set; the internet widgets are pretty cool, but slow. I especially like the YouTube widget. The DLNA network feature is also a nice addition, but the interface is also slow and not very intuitive. I'm hoping that a future firmware upgrade would improve the functionality. The content library feature is my favorite. It allows you to display a slideshow of artwork or other pics with soft background music - great for parties. You can download additional content for free from Samsung.I am extremely pleased with this television and would recommend it to anyone.", "Date": "September 10, 2009"}, {"Title": "Very good but not perfect", "Author": "A. Bailey", "ReviewID": "R43QRLZQSLPU", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Clarity and colors are stunning. It literally makes everything you watch look like it was filmed with a consumer grade camcorder rather than pro grade cameras. This TV makes things look like they are happening in front of you in your very own room. You see every strand of hair, every wrinkle, every mole and blemish on faces. You have to see it to believe it. One way to describe it is that everything looks \"different\" than what you may have been accustomed to seeing. I recommend that you see this TV in a brick-n-mortar store to see what I mean.The number of adjustments menus is also above and beyond what any one of us not in the business of making these TVs is ever going to need. For folks that want to tweak, here is your opportunity.However, this TV is not perfect.1. Corners show reverse vignetting where on very dark scenes you can see the corner illumination projecting significantly into the screen. It looks like a flash light is projecting from the corner. The corner itself is very dark but a very faint light spreads in a fan pattern from each corner towards the center of the screen. This is only visible in very dark scenes where the primary display color is black. You can not see this normally.2. The stand does not feel sturdy. If you push on the very top of the bezel, the screen will rock back and forth... I freaked out the first time I did that when I bumped the screen during placement of the TV on my entertainment stand. Looking at the attachment point, Samsung went super cheap; the current attachment technique does not belong on a TV in this price range. You are provided with (literally) a shoe-lace attached to a triangular piece of plastic that attaches to the TV. The other end is supposed to be attached either to the wall or your stand. This is really out of place for a TV of this caliber and I think is my biggest disappointment with this TV.As the LED display technology advances, I'm sure this TV will be surpassed in performance by future models from Samsung or competing brands. However, for the time being, this is a very good HD display with some imperfections.I'm pleased with the purchase and look forward to many years of service.Regards,", "Date": "July 26, 2009"}, {"Title": "Beware of uneven backlight", "Author": "Scott Herz \"Bentwookie\"", "ReviewID": "RB98H90BLGHGS", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "I bought this TV because the overall picture quality is good and it's unbelievably thin. However, there are some inherent problems with the set which are driving me nuts.The backlight is extremely uneven at the corners. In dark scenes (like credits, or the entirety of letter-boxed movies) you will see little searchlights coming from the corners. Once you see it (and you will see it), you won't be able to NOT see it.The autodimming feature is also poorly implemented. Again, in credits or scenes where there is more dark than light, it will turn the backlight down for \"better contrast\". However, when the TV changes its mind about the scene, the previously dim white areas will pop bright white. It looks very strange.I've read that there are \"workarounds\" but some of them involve going into the service menu (which apparently voids the warranty). This TV should work better in dark scenes for the price.", "Date": "July 5, 2009"}, {"Title": "Picture Quality and Dynamic Contrast are the next best thing to 3D", "Author": "Derek", "ReviewID": "R2RZF7PSLD5CME", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Not perfect, but it's the closest thing I've seen so far.  Really deserves 4 1/2 stars instead of 5 due to the lack of a couple convenience features missing from the remote, and the limited number of non HDMI inputs. The picture quality, light weight, reduced power use, and thin cabinet are just terrific. The remote takes a couple hours to really bondwith though you can start watching TV and movies pretty quickly without knowing how to make adjustements other than selecting your input source.Pros:* Increadible Dynamic Contrast. I feel like other people are in the room with me. Even up close to a few inches away the images is crisp, clear, and lifelike.* Light weight at only about 65 lbs or so, about 1/3 that of an old 32\" TV.* VGA computer input, 4 HDMI, Audio out, and a couple other type inputs.*240Hz demo feature lets you display 240Hz on one side and 60Hz regular on the other. There's also multiple modes of 240Hz you can select. Great feature to play with while watching the latest Bond movies.*2ms response time (sounds good to me)Cons:*Only one regular RCA input that is shared with a Component input (you can use either the 3 component inputs jacks~ or just one of them for your video, then use the Left and Right audio). Bottom line is you only have one non-HDMI video Input (not counting the computer VGA input).*PIP only accessed from tools menu instead of a single button on remote. Swapping PIP image to main image required selecting that source input instead of a single swap button. Can only display TV or Cable image in PIP and not other HDMI input devices.*Touch of Color is only one blue light at the bottom instead of all around the edges as I expected.That's the quick review. I'm sure someone will go into more detail soon and I look forward to hearing other takes on this new LED series. I'm very happy with the purchase, especially at 10% or more below the list price.", "Date": "May 18, 2009"}, {"Title": "Samsung 8000 LED LCD TV Amazing...", "Author": "Paul D. Marsh", "ReviewID": "RQE0WUA1VEHCI", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This TV is replacing a Sony 50\" rear screen projection LCD HDTV that still has a great picture.  However, the Sony uses a $200 projector bulb to display the tiny LCD enlarged through lenses up to the 50\" screen, and that generates a LOT of heat (and only lasts a couple of years).  Additionally, the Sony TV only displays up to a 720p image, which is fine, but pales in comparison to this new Samsung model.  The LED-side backlit LCD Samsung TV remains cool indefinitely as it's viewed, which is a major issue if you don't use your TV to heat your living room.The first time I saw this new Samsung in a local Best Buy showroom I was immediately transfixed.  The image was stunning, razor sharp, bright, and when I touched the top rear of the case, absolutely room temperature.  Because the screen case is only about 1 1/4\" thick the unit seems flimsy sitting vertically on its crystal plastic cylinder atop a base, but that's a minor issue to me.  Many people will remove the base and hang it on the wall.  I have a TV nook, so this unit sits on its base out of the way of anyone possibly bumping into it.This TV has the best image of any TV I've EVER viewed.  I'm not a TV snob, just a daily viewer, but I've owned a lot of high quality TVs over the years, and this one stands out.  Once I plugged my Dish PVR and Sony PS3 Slim in and looked at the picture in my living room environment, I was convinced I'd made a good decision (and I moved the Sony to another room).It's only been a couple of months since my spouse began pushing me to upgrade to 1080, but I thought my DVDs looked great on the Sony TV and didn't feel the urgency.  Now, viewing those same DVDs on my PS3 Slim/Samsung 8000, they look grainy, and definitely remind me of my transitions from Beta to LD to DVD way back when.  When I popped in a new Blu-ray movie I was convinced.  I'm not sure I'll ever enjoy my old DVDs the same way again.The TV worked perfectly out of the box.  I plugged it into a gigabit switch to my broadband connection and upgraded its firmware in a few minutes.  A couple of days later my Blu-ray Spears & Munsil HD Benchmark disk arrived and I was hard pressed to change ANY settings.  In fact, most of the test screens were puzzling to me, since they looked fine.  The Spears & Munsil disk shows you a sample of a good image and a bad image for each test screen, and almost all of the test screens on the Samsung looked exactly like the benchmark images.  There was one test image that appeared off (screen was so bright the test boxes were nearly invisible), but even with the brightness turned completely down the image didn't change, so I left it at the setup default.  Bottom line, the TV was calibrated nearly perfectly already out of the box.  The over saturated, super bright settings you view in the showroom are what Samsung calls Dynamic.  I selected a different setting for my Dish satellite and Blu-ray viewing modes that's fine for home viewing.  Of course, Samsung allows you to customize to your heart's content if the simple options don't work for you.  This unit also boasts a 240Hz fast image smoothing functionality, which basically takes your standard 60Hz (or 24Hz for DVDs) signal and interpolates (creates) additional images to display something on your screen more frequently so you don't notice the jumps as fast images move across the screen.  I can't say that I've noticed this in daily use.  But perhaps sports fans will appreciate it, or it'll become more obvious in action movies.You can have a separate setup for each input, so I configured my Dish satellite images to bright natural tones, and my Blu-ray settings to a movie configuration (where many images are darker than commercial television).  I bypass the TV for audio, using the TV as a monitor only, which is just as well.  While there are four HDMI inputs, the optical out ONLY PASSES THROUGH A  STEREO SIGNAL to your AV receiver/amplifier.  That means NO DTS/5.1/7.1 audio if you pass all your components through your TV.  So, I plug my satellite and Blu-ray video inputs directly into my TV's HDMI ports, and their optical audio connections directly into my AV receiver driving my 5.1 system.  I configure my Harmony remote to turn on my TV, set the video port, and set my AV receiver to my satellite audio in when watching Dish, and my Sony PS3 Slim when I'm watching a movie.I've been researching new HDTVs for a couple of months now, and this unit is currently the most popular (including the less expensive 7000 and 6000 series units, and the just released 8500 rear-LED backlight unit) and best rated.  A couple of comments I've heard and read about with this TV concerned its side-LED backlight scheme, and how that prevents the TV from darkening just a portion of the screen (vice LEDs all across the back of the screen, individually controlled).  I can attest that this unit has phenomenal blacks (not dark grays, as my Sony TV has).  I'm sure the 8500's rear-LED scheme will provide more discriminating dark areas on the screen, but for the moment that's not worth the extra thousand dollars to me.  The blacks and dark areas on the 8000 look great.  I did notice that the corners of the screen appear slightly darker where the backlights can't run into the corner, but only on the showroom models that were on all day long.  I haven't yet observed dark corners on a white screen on my home unit.  I've also heard that some people have experienced hardware failures after a week of home viewing, typically where the screen goes all white, which requires a repair.  Best Buy told me if that happens and they can't repair it in two weeks, they'll replace the unit (they also offer a 4-year warranty for another $400).  I'm keeping my fingers crossed that I didn't get a defective unit, but so far so good.  The TV looks so great, I was willing to take the chance.  Anyway, if it works for a month, it'll probably work forever, such is the history of electronics.  Just a heads up, Samsung Customer Service is getting a LOT of complaints on the Internet for unresponsiveness to repairs.  But again, the TV is so good, I'm just keeping my fingers crossed.  As an aside, Samsung extended their warranty to 15 months parts/labor when I registered it online, so perhaps they have noticed the hardware issues/complaints.While this TV is listed currently at $3,899 retail, its everyday price almost anywhere is ~$3,009.  Sales and promotions can save you more.  When Fry's Electronics offered it at $2,699 last week, we immediately went to our local Best Buy (which price matches and offers free delivery, trash take-away, and old TV take-away, if you want) and purchased it, with a table and a PS3 Slim.So far, I'm completely satisfied.  This is a great HDTV and I look forward to watching it each evening.  Oh, and I'm definitely going to start buying more Blu-ray DVDs.", "Date": "November 2, 2009"}, {"Title": "Samsung LED LCD is a Superior TV", "Author": "Caver", "ReviewID": "R1PA8KML0Z4163", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Sorry, but the other comments about reverse vignetting or edge-lighting are sheer nonsense.  You can see anything if you look hard enough - and that is the point.  I originally bought the Samsung UN46B8000 (46 inch LED) and observed no such issue whatsoever - just a superb picture.  After nearly 30 days I got bigger screen envy, so I went back to Best Buy and purchased the UN55B8000 (55 inch), and traded in the 46 inch. Once again a fantastic picture with no edge-lighting. No issues at all. Samsung has hit the sweet spot with the 8000 series.  This 240Hz version is especially wonderful when viewing action scenes.Anyone who has seen my set is blown away by the superb picture, rich colors, color contrast, etc. - and these are comments from my friends, the Geek Squad installers, the Dish Network guy, and so on.  This set was worth every penny.  You will pay more, but you get what you pay for.

Sartoris", "ReviewID": "R2ET4FTK5521W9", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "Let me begin this review by stating that Amazon.com has been VERY good about helping me with my problem. Their return policy and customer service are among the best in the industry.NOW: Samsung is a different story.I bought this television based on the specs, the online reviews and Samsung's own website. The screen size and the price point seemed great for us. When it arrived, it was even more beautiful in person. Sadly, the picture quality was awful. I know that electronic devices can be perfect out of the box or DOA out of the box, so I was a bit disappointed when I installed the TV and found out that it wasn't working properly. The backlight was horribly uneven (more than just the typical \"edge lit LED screens are uneven\" stuff...this was very noticeable on all inputs). Any all-black screen was marred by clouds of white light. Worse, there were digital artifacts around all edges and contrasty spots. It looked like a B&W; checkerboard surrounded everything, and it was also visible on all HDMI inputs (Dish DVR and XBox) AND on our Samsung BluRay player. The sound occasionally dropped out, and there were weird all-magenta screen flashes randomly happening. You get the point. This was a defective TV.Unaware of Amazon's customer-friendly return policy, I called Samsung to take advantage of their in-home warranty service. I'm not going to spend pages and pages ranting about how awful the experience was. I'll just say it was awful. They came out three times (VERY late, two out of three of them) and could not fix the problems. I thought it would be a no-brainer to have Samsung step up and replace the TV with a working model. NOPE! They've given me the run-around for almost two months. They finally said that the service tech had not specifically written \"deemed unrepairable\", so they could not replace it unless he did. Hours of back-and-forth calls later, they finally deemed it unrepairable, and said they'd replace the TV...except that they apparently do not have any of that model available in any of their warehouses. They told me I should just wait for them to contact me. They do not know when that will happen.I checked Amazon's site, and they said they'd take back the TV right now and replace it with a brand new one. I've owned other Samsung products in the past, so I'm not overly worried about getting another lemon. I'm just very, very disappointed in Samsung's terrible customer service. It's rare to find a company who is adamant about NOT caring a bit about customer (dis)satisfaction. Google \"samsung customer service sucks\" for many more stories just like mine...And again, I have to say that Amazon is a stellar company.

The picture is truly amazing.  as sharp and awesome as i have ever seen on any set anywhere.  I took a Samsung 58 inch plasma that i had in the family room and moved it to another room, and put this one instead.  The reason?  The plasma is a wonderful set, but produced a lot of heat both on the screen and through the top vents.  It was like a heater being on at all times the tv was on in the room.  So we moved it to another room that gets less use.  This new LED/LCD is the most incredible picture i have ever seen.  I am watching a blu-ray DVD of Lord of the Rings and it is absolutely stunning.  The 240hz makes a difference and the 5:1 ratio is incredible.  I have only one negative right now, i have been unable to hook up my wireless network to get Yahoo internet.  I have a MAC time machine router and it is just not connecting when i put in the Samsung USB device.  It will work, i guess i am doing something wrong.

I put in the trouble ticket with Samsung Warranty, and they said a service person would visit in 2 business days.  At the end of the second day, I received a call followed by the same questions I answered with the Samsung reps.  This was a seperate service company, First Choice Business Products, who ordered a new processor based on our phone conversation.  I was told on Monday the part would be in Friday or the following Monday.  Two and a half weeks and many frustrating phone calls later, they scheduled a time to come out and fix it.When Mike arrived, he dismembered my TV in my living room, really manhandled it, and forty minutes later it was back together.  However the power button would not turn the set back on.  Three minutes he tried the same things to no avail, finally he got it on.  After a software reset, the set looked to be working.  He left on a Friday.Two weeks later, the set began acting up again, powering itself down with the slightest touch, switching itself to Demo mode, and the same irradic activity.

Not quite, the gist of that call was to confirm that my problems happened within 3 weeks of the initial fix, and Samsung would not be billed for the second trip!

For a while I noticed these blemishes while watching the news and I thought the screen or news anchors were dirty.  After cleaning it properly, it did not resolve the problem.  I found that when I display a dark grey solid background (via a PC) I can see the distortion in its entirety.  ** This is NOT the clouding issue. **  Of course my warranty expired a few months ago.  I didn't look for this problem after reading about it first.  I just slowly started noticing the \"dirty\" marks while watching TV.  I had such high hopes for this TV.  What a disappointment!Pros:Picture is amazing, especially in a well lit room.Stunning vibrant colors with minimum calibration necessaryLooks great both mounted on the wall or on the standSlim design makes it an artsy conversation piecePlenty of inputs/outputsLots of tunable settingsRF remote surprisingly convenient (don't have to aim at TV) with handy \"remote finder\" feature too.Cons:Uneven backlighting results in \"clouding\" during dark scenesRemote control \"wheel\" is useless, slow and annoyingSome of the menu functions are disorganized and require different buttons and stepsPicture-in-Picture should have its own button on remoteInternet Widgets are slow to load, slow to navigate, slow to useDLNA server software takes HOURS to catalog all the pictures, videos, and music filesNavigating the various media files via USB or DLNA is HORRENDOUS and slow.Built in content feature is cute, but useless after first use.Like many other purchasers of this model, I have been researching for a new HDTV for a long time.  In fact, my first choice was the very popular LN52A650 back in 2008.  It had the \"new\" 120Hz feature everyone was raving about.  Fortunately other priorities delayed my purchase.  Last year when Samsung came out with their new LED lineup I knew THAT was what I REALLY wanted.  I loved the slim looks and slightly larger 55\" size, but unfortunately the initial price was WAY over my budget.  With every visit to Best Buy I would study the picture for each model.  I could never see any difference between the 6000, 7000, or 8000 series though. I'd also read all the reviews on Amazon and avsforum too. (actually I still do).  The UN55B8500 and 2010 \"C\" models were heavy considerations too, but for $800+ more, they were simply out of my budget.  I managed to get the UN55B8000 for about $1900 and it was worth the wait!This TV is huge, especially compared to the 27\" CRT it replaced.  Setup was easy and quick.  My HD source is OTA digital signals via a full size roof antenna in the attic pointed to the cluster of transmitters 20 miles away on a mountain.  Surprisingly the TV found more channels than my cheapy OTA converter box ever did.  Each digital channel also lists the program schedule and a description of the show airing.  The 720p and 1080i picture quality from the local broadcasts is fantastic!  I can see every detail of the news anchor's face whether I like it or not! I don't have a blu-ray player yet, but my DVD player will upconvert DVDs to 1080p and it looks GREAT.  And finally, my HTPC makes the UN55B8000 a perfect monitor.  I can not stress how convenient it is to have a PC connected to your new TV.  It totally negates the need for any of the slow clunky Internet or media playing features built into the TV.  With sites like Hulu, Netflix, and Youtube to name a few, there are endless amounts of HD content available (legally too!) which eliminates the need (at least for me) for digital cable or tivo.Now after a few weeks of ownership I've played around with all the settings, and have finally mounted it on the wall.  Without going into great detail about the mount, I will say I used the generic version of the Samsung wall mount which has the same parts.  It cost me about $35. I actually like it better than the Samsung version since the cable is longer which allows the TV to be securely mounted on two studs.  Yes, the TV is light (sort of), but I feel more comfortable not relying on only drywall to hold such an expensive piece.  Behind the TV I installed a recessed outlet and an access hole to run all my cables up the wall across the attic and back down to my A/V equipment.  In total, I have 1 optical, 1 VGA, 5 RCA component+audio, 4 HDMI, 1 USB, 1 network and 1 3.5mm audio cable connected, and the TV still sits flat against the wall.I'm still learning what video settings work best.  Sometimes a setting that works for one channel or movie, doesn't work for another.  So if you want the best picture, learn the basic settings in each menu.  As for the \"Auto Motion Plus 240Hz\", I keep the settings at Custom with Blur high and Judder low (I think).  It's what most people use to keep a smooth picture without the \"soap opera\" effect which is really strange.  Even at this setting, live sports looked crystal clear to me.Another issue that exists with this TV is the clouding and flashlighting that shows up on dark scenes when viewing the TV in a dark room.  Let me clarify my observations for my TV which may or may not exist for yours.  When I'm watching during the day time in a well lit room, I do not see the problem.  The picture is stunning and the blacks are deep and dark.  But once the room gets dark, and especially at night when only the TV is on, you can see blotches of lighter blacks (the clouding).  It can be distracting at times, but I'm mostly use to it as it doesn't affect every program.  You can fine tune your dynamic contrast and back lighting to help reduce this effect.  I also hear it could go away with time, and it does exists on some 2010 models, so if you want to stick with Samsung, then this is something you'll have to live with.  It really only affects about 5% of my viewing anyways.Many have complained about the sound of this model.  I'll say it's okay when watching the news or PBS.  But for movies, you'll need to have a good A/V receiver.  I'm still using my old Sony which supports 5.1 digital sound, but no HDMI.  The DVD player (and future Blu-Ray player) uses a digital coax to the receiver.  I use the Toslink optical cable from the TV to my receiver so the broadcast channels sound MUCH better.  It works for me.Final Thoughts:I rate this set 4 out of 5 only because of the clouding issues.  It is clearly a quality control problem that Samsung either cannot or will not correct.  This IS an amazing television none-the-less.  With great looks, a quality picture, and easy to use functions, there are only minimal improvements that would make it better.  Currently the price of this TV is dangerously close to the 2010 \"C\" models, so I'm curious if there will be one more big price drop to get rid of all that old stock.  If you don't care about 3D, and could use the extra hundreds of dollars savings, then I would seriously consider purchasing this TV.  Otherwise wait until the end of the year for the prices of this years models to drop down.  That seems to be the trend.Side notes:Stand is very heavy, maybe 1/3 of the weight of the TV.Mini-remote stays in my kitchen which faces the TV, so it's kinda useful.Picture of my TV is posted in the customer images section.Review the manual. I keep finding new features I never knew about!Update on April 22, 2010:After a few more weeks of ownership here are some more observations...- Off angle viewing is not the best.  Once you move far to the right or left of the screen, all the colors start to wash out.  I never really noticed this in the beginning, but now it's very prevalent.- I do not notice any image degradation from a lower angle.  My TV sits 12 feet in front and the bottom of the screen is at eye level.- The timer/alarm feature is handy. I have my TV turn on every morning and turn off right before I leave for work.- I haven't used any of the Internet apps since writing my initial review.- Some TV shows are severally affected by ANY Auto Motion Plus (AMP) imaging smoothing setting.  (Lost, Amazing Race) They seem to lag and play catch up throughout the show.  This is a different affect than the soap opera thing.  I have to turn AMP completely off to resolve.  Then it looks normal.- Monoprice has the generic wall mount for 12 bucks!!", "Date": "March 30, 2010"}, {"Title": "Mindblowingly Dissapointing!!!!!", "Author": "N.

Here is a copy of the recent email I sent them:This is my second formal attempt to contact your company regarding a 55\" Samsung LED UN55B8000XF. I informed you in my first contact attempt that I had purchased less than two weeks ago this television from Fry's Electronics in Concord, CA. Upon hooking up the television, I noticed four black corners which hindered my viewing pleasure and took away from the effectiveness of the high definition television. I asked what your company's formal stance was on this model and it's problem with dark corners and I asked whether the 8500 series set to be released would have the same problem. To date, I have received no response from you. I take this to mean that the dark corners are not supposed to be there and that they are in fact, a defect. It is unacceptable that Samsung will not reply to my request for information given the thousands I have paid for this television. This is my second documented request and if I do not receive an acceptable response and solution to my problem, I will have no choice but to pursue my complaint in a legal forum, seeking to reimburse the costs I had to pay out of pocket with regard to the purchase, delivery, set-up, and so forth, of this defective television.

I called Samsung Customer Service and they told me this problem is caused when the styrofoam packaging is too tight during shipping, and that it should go away in 2-3 weeks.  If not I should call back and they will send a tech out to look at it. The service rep also mentioned that this is covered under warranty if it doesn't go away.So, honestly I don't know what to think of this TV. When it's showing pictures that are not dark, (ie a sports game or daylight scenes), it's picture is fantastic. Clear, rich and beautiful. But if you dim your lights at night and watch a movie that has many dark scenes in it, the backlight problem is very noticeable.

I generally agonize over electronic purchases, doing hours of research.  This one was no exception.  After reading hundreds of reviews, consumer publications and store visits, i narrowed the search as follows:LCD v. Plasma:I chose LCD technology due to the eye-poping picture, reduced energy consumption, and no picture burn-in.  Early LCDs had jitter problems, but those days are gone.  Please note that this TV *is* an LCD TV!  They call it \"LED\" because most LCD TVs are back-lit using floresencent bulbs around the edges, but this one is back-lit using a grid of little LED lights across the back.  This grid allows the backligting to be turned off in areas of the screen where a black picture is shown.  This supposedly makes the black darker than florescent lit LCDs, but i only noticed it when viewing from an angle.Brand:I narrowed the brand selection to Sony or Samsung. based upon reviews, including consumer mags, and store visits.  I must say the Sony offering has fastastic picture crispness, color, etc, too.  On the final purchase day, i took my wife with me ($3K is a joint decision).  We compared a Sony BR9 52\" with the Sansung 8000 55\".  after more than an hour of back and forth viewing we went with the Samsung.  The decision was based on a slightly brigher picture (probably due to the LED vs Floresent back lighting), the extreme thinness (This TV is built to wall-mount, the Sony with a standard mount will protrude 5\" into the room, this one with the 'picture hanger' mount from Samsung will protrude 2\"), and the extra 3\" of screen size.Outcome:I am so impressed with the Samsung after 2 weeks of use.  Even standard non-HD cable looks good.  It looks better in my house than the store feed.  The embeded content (scenery, art, games, recipies, relaxing image&sounds;) is cool for a demo, but not expected to be used too much.

We had this smoothing feature turned on by default out of the box, and it caused frame stuttering! The frame stuttering was so bad while I was watching a few sample shows that I started to get a headache. We at first couldn't figure out why the picture was stuttering so noticeably, but once we turned off AutoMotion, the stuttering ceased.(2) LED backlighting is edge, not from behind. When you look at a black screen, you can SEE the edge backlighting. During normal watching this setup doesn't bother much, but for dark dark movies like Aliens, Star Wars, etc., you have to turn it way down or you can actually see the edge backlighting.(3) Gloss is a pro and con. The screen reflects light like mad. You have to turn off or shutter any light behind you before viewing, or you will see those tiny slivers of sunshine from behind the blinds.

So I was surprised that I got the brightness I needed and the fantastic color that I wanted.Additionally, I was please to find that Samsung opened up all of the A/V settings so you can seriously adjust the picture to suit the envirmoment and the types of viewing you will do.  {I have a lot to learn on this aspect. My previous Sony you had to go into a special mode for those settings.  I never bothered}.A shout out to the white gloves service.  They were simple, effective, and quick.  They brought it in, unpackaged it, connected it, tested (with me observing) and were gone after cleaning up after themselves.I installed this on the wall myself using the Samsung Ultra-slim mounting kit.

Johnson \"tech junkie\"", "ReviewID": "RRCCG0AUY1LWR", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I purchased this TV, partly against my better judgment, in the middle of February, 2010. I read many reviews by other consumers complaining of a \"spotlighting\" effect produced by the LED edge-lighting that replaces the fluorescent-style backlighting of older model LCDs. Upon receiving my TV, I was disappointed to see that the concerns others voiced were not exaggerated. The LED edge-lighting is distinctly uneven, resulting in numerous, lighter-colored \"spotlights\" all around the edge of the TV, most noticeably in the corners. In a darkened room, they are especially large and noticeable, covering a good five inches all around the edge of the screen. It can be distracting, as others have pointed out.One reviewer claimed to have hit upon a firmware upgrade that fixes the problem. I have been able to find no such upgrade. The only firmware upgrade Samsung has made available does not list this problem as one that it fixes. Besides this, the upgrade is from September of 2009; my TV was manufactured on December 31, 2010 (according to the serial number), four months after this upgrade was made available. I would think my TV already has the upgrade.The thing that really upsets me, though, is that just prior to writing this review, I contacted Samsung customer support via chat to see if Samsung was at least aware of the problem, even if they may not have a way to fix it. The customer service rep was enormously unhelpful, telling my to reset my TV to fix the issue. I have a feeling she probably knew next to nothing about any of Samsung's products and was just following a flow chart in response to my inquiry. She claimed that no other consumers had reported such an issue with this TV. I highly doubt I am the first person to contact them about this very real, and very annoying, issue, considering all of the reviews that have been posted on this website and others. She offered to send a technician to assess and fix the problem. Was he going to build me a different TV, I wonder? I think that is the only was to resolve an inherent design flaw.Now, having said this, let my just say that the above issue was the ONLY thing that kept me from giving this TV five stars and an absolutely glowing recommendation! The picture IS AMAZING! By far the best I have seen on any HDTV to date, and I thoroughly researched this purchase. I do not regret the purchase, and would purchase it again in lieu of Samsung's 8500 series (which has local backlighting instead of edge-lighting - this fixes the above mentioned problem, but this TV has it's own backlighting problem: google \"LED blooming effect\"). No LCD TV is perfect with regard to its backlighting - this is one of the major advantages that Plasma TVs have over LCD; it has always been a problem and will probably always be a problem until organic LED TVs become mainstream. Until then, you have three options:1) Deal with low contrast ratios resulting from overly-bright, overly-white fluorescent backlighting,2) Deal with uneven LED edge-lighting that produces \"spotlights,\" or3) Deal with \"blooming\" effects produced by local LED backlighting.I would still purchase an LCD TV over a Plasma TV with a shelf-life. I would still recommend this TV, unless you really want to splurge and spend the extra $800 to get the locally backlit LED TV - a marginally better compromise.", "Date": "March 7, 2010"}, {"Title": "Superb picture and set", "Author": "Guillaume Normand", "ReviewID": "R1RGQ3H57CF4F5", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I have had this set since October 2009 and I have not been disappointed in any way.In September I had concerns about some of the reviews complaining about the \"white\" edges/corners on dark scenes.Well these are rare and very faint.

So if you have a switch box to share that bank between a Wii, a DVD, a laser disc player and a VCR and you want the highest image resolution possible you are going to have to connect using a Video Component connection thus leaving out your VCR and the Laser disc player because these two use an AV connection.- forget those switches advertised as converters they don't work.  True converters are very expensive too.Also the remote uses AAA batteries.

DRAWBACKS, not INPUT button and clock type battery.CONECTIVITYIn this case it works great... the BD WISE function is practical and instant... the network capability for streaming... these are awesome feature seldomly exploited.NOW THE CONS:REMOTE CONTROL, although impressive and comfy  it is TERRIBLY ANNOYING that this remote has to be \"paired\" to the TV...  and it CONSTANTLY get UNPARIED... this annoys me SO MUCH I don't even use it anymore... using the crappy remote of my Blu Ray Player.

The home theater company that came to install this TV (had some fancy wiring to do, specific to my install over the fireplace) recommended it, but could not stop watching it once we got it hooked up. Watching golf in HD...you see the blades of grass. Watching CSI Miami, you see the blood droplets (can be good or bad :). The Comcast guy that came to install the CableCard for my Tivo Premier box was absolutely amazed by it. Anyone that has seen it is truly amazed by the picture. Even in a bright room with windows, there is very little glare. We can watch with pure clarity any time of the day.This TV is super thin, and that amazes friends too. I have it mounted on a Peerless Ultra Thin Flat Panel Wall Mount. This is way more low profile than the \"picture frame\" mount that Samsung is selling. I have this TV hooked up to a Yamaha RX-V665BL and a Bose cube system, so I have never used the in TV speakers. The menu system is a little goofy and slow, and the remote takes some getting used to. If you have this TV connected to a receiver, which you should, you may never use the remote anyway. I have the Tivo remote programmed to handle everything. The widgets are cool, but require using the Samsung remote, and are very slow to load. I have the TV hooked to my Cat5 cable, so its not my wireless connection. Once you get used to the remote though, going in and changing settings, such as picture modes is easy, but rarely necessary.Did I mention this TV is amazing? Watch a few Blue Rays on this baby, and you will be hooked. And if you aren't sure wether or not you will notice the difference between 240hz and the 120hz, go into the demo mode. Anyone that says the human eye cant tell the difference is trying to sell you a 120hz TV. You don't notice the difference...until you see them side by side. Then you will know the difference for sure, trust me.I am most amazed by: the picture quality, the thin profile of this TV, it sits just over an inch off of my wall, the way the TV looks even when it is off, the 240hz frame rates.I am not as impressed with: the gadgets, the menu interface, the infrequently used remote.", "Date": "May 16, 2010"}, {"Title": "55 inch Samsung LCD/LED TV", "Author": "R.

You are not going to buy an LED at this price anywhere.  The price was a huge selling point, then came the picture.  I read and read about the lighting problem and yes, I did see it once.  And yes, if you look really close you can see faint brightness in the corners when it comes to an all black background.  Then I did the update for the LED and it seems to have helped.  I've watched several dark looking movies and haven't seen it.  After all of that I came to the conclusion that the picture on this is just awesome.  I'm a big sports nut and watching any sport on this is just the best.  Colors are spot on and the 240hz really struts it's stuff during games.  And as for the 240hz motion, like a lot of people have stated before.  I turn it off when I am watching a blue ray movie.  It actually ends up being to clear if that's possible.  And that's a real good problem to have.  So picture wise, you can't go wrong.Sound, ugh!  I'm not an expert when it comes to all the techs of sound.  But the sound on it is real bad.  It's not something that stopped me from purchasing it, and after awhile most people won't think much about it.  But when you hook it up to a sound system you will really notice the difference.  And again, the sound part for me was not a big deal.Overall, great TV.  The best price you'll find.  The delivery people were fast and great to work with.

My consultant/installer wanted me to buy an LCD (back-lit vs. edge-lit) but when he finished putting in my sound system and fired up the entire system he said he was stunned and amazed at the quality of picture and said that my choice of TVs was better than his recommendation!Mine is hanging in a alcove space in the wall of entertainment center cabinets in our living room and my issue with my older DLP TV was the reflections coming from my wall of windows to the side and back of our seating area.  With the tilting wall mount and the incredible brightness of this TV the glare is not an issue any longer.  The TV automatically updated its firmware once connected to the internet and with my Harmony 900 remote my wife can now easily operate all my components: DirecTV DVR, Apple TV, Ipod, the free BluRay DVD I got with this TV, and the Wii without written instructions or a phone call to me when the grandkids want to watch a DVD.The other thing that was great and had caused me a lot of anxiety in the past with Amazon was their delivery vendor here in the DFW area.  I had quit buying from Amazon for a year because of this but when I saw that Amazon jettisoned its old shipping company and my TV was to be delivered by Pilot Freight Services that sealed the deal.  Pilot called to schedule the delivery and again when in route, and they were very professional when it arrived and placed the box in my living room for the installer to unpack.I highly recommend this TV and I noticed yesterday that BestBuy had already jacked the price back up after the Super Bowl, while it is still much lower on Amazon.", "Date": "February 8, 2010"}, {"Title": "Great, except for the uneven backlighting...", "Author": "R.

It's an excellent TV. Great picture quality and brightness. Sound is not all that great but if you're getting a TV of this size, Samsung probably figures you have a surround sound system anyhow.The Internet features are a bit disappointing. Samsung supports Yahoo Widgets and if you can find a widget to talk to your preferred content provider (Flickr, NetFlix etc), then you can stream any content from them BUT the widgets themselves are very sluggish. Navigating through them to get to your downloaded movie can be a tiresome process. The remote appears unresponsive and it buffers your input and does them all at once leading to a lot of angst. If Live! functionality is your reason for a new TV, then I suggest you look elsewhere (Panasonic's BD Live! players have excellent Internet functionality through Vieracast).Mounting the TV was quite easy. I bought a standard wall-mount from Costco and that package had the necessary screws to mount this on the wall.Now to the 240Hz anti-judder : This feature inserts additional frames in between the frames in the movie. If you are watching live sports OR other non-movie HD programs, you'll be thrilled with the picture quality BUT if you are watching movies on Blu-Ray or streaming movies from the Internet, then you start to notice a soap-opera like feel to the movie. It's very clear and sharp and all but you will not like the \"non-film\" quality to the picture. Fortunatley, Samsung provides a way to turn off 240Hz anti-judder and that thankfully helps.

The first one delivered did not work out of the box but Amazon was quick to ship me a second one with no questions or delays.  5 Stars for Amazon.The TV picture is quite amazing in most ways; in a few situations when the screen is mostly dark it seems to have a problem with small areas that require being light brighter than the very dark surroundings.  The glow of a candle lit dinner for example will not be as bright as it would on a normal TV.  But other than that issue the picture is very good and all that I expected.The widgets work well but so far I have not used them to any great extent, it is much faster to switch to the weather channel for quick up date on the weather than to activate the weather widget for example.  The technology side of me finds the ability to be internet connected appealing but the reality is not too much usefulness so far.The built in library is also a fun detail not sure how much use it will get but again a good start to an interesting feature that could add value.I also purchased a Samsung Theatre and it is also connected to the internet I find the Netflix real time/streaming movies and the streaming music of Pandora to be a very useful feature and I also find that normal DVDs do look so much better on the blue ray player as it converts the image to almost blue ray quality.  I purchased the wireless dongle and it works fine but I also would expect a TV with a list price of almost $4000 not to have to have a wireless adaptor purchased separately!Over all I am quite satisfied with both the TV and Home Theatre, I have only had them a month or so, and time will tell if reliability will prove my purchase a good long time buy.", "Date": "November 9, 2009"}, {"Title": "vkd", "Author": "V.

While watching Dish TVs 720p, compressed transmission, I could see the degradation of the picture quality. Sound is very bad, it hurs my ears, should definetly have external speakers. While watching dark scenes, you might see some light throwing off from sides, but it is not a deal breaker, never bothered me so far, it is minimal.

I can see the beams of the LED shining in from the sides. This is not a problem in scenes with any sort of complexity, especially if they're well lit.Visible Auto Dimming - When the screen transitions from mostly light to mostly dark, the TV will dim the backlight to enhance the black levels of the dark scene. This normally happens on a camera cut, and is not visible, but when viewing a spaceship against a black backdrop it might pop if the ship takes up less than 30% of the screen.No Keyboard Support - When watching things on Youtube, or trying to create stations in in Pandora, attaching a keyboard would really make things a lot easier.

It's simply the most amazing television I've ever owned.So, beyond my \"shock and awe\" I've owned a 50\" Panasonic Plasma and a 37\" LCD.  Those two PALE in comparison! Even using a Bluray player on my 50\" plasma (also in 1080p)the picture is EVEN BETTER!  I didn't even realize it was possible!My one caution for this setup, you better like HD reality.  Many shows in HD or movies on Bluray look so real, you literally feel like you're there.  I watched an episode of House last night and thought the clarity and film work was so drastically different that it almost look more like filming of a soap opera.  It's taking some getting used to that's for sure!I can't wait to try the Amazon On-Demand HD movies!!", "Date": "March 9, 2010"}, {"Title": "Awesome Samsung TV!!", "Author": "SMcC \"S MAC\"", "ReviewID": "RDPA4NGIIVBO0", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I've always been a fan of Samsung products because they have always been durable and never have given me any problems. This TV is so clear it's almost unreal!! You'll never go back to watching TV on anything else!! I've had the TV for 2 weeks now and am loving it!! (It's taken me 2 wks to get use to the clarity! Got a little nauseas from time to time because it was so clear it gave me motion sickness!!)Pros--Several HDMI ports, USB, ethernet, etc. (I only use the HDMI & component ports)-loving the USB port because I can just plug my USB or external hard drive right into it to watch my movies that I have in Dvix format. I haven't tried accessing my videos, pics or music by connecting it to my pc though so I can't comment on that-Clarity is better than LCD or plasma by far!! Almost appears 3D or like the movie is being filmed right in front of you!!-HD channels & Blu-ray, DVD's look amazing on the TV. Crystal clear-Remote works on other samsung products w/o programming/vice versa. It also came with a tiny palm size remote that allows you to control the volume and change the channels w/o using the bigger remote. The bigger remote does light up orange behind the keys at movement or touch.-Sound is good. I just keep it at a low level because I use my Samsung home theater surround sound speakers for everything.-Of course the size is great! No bulky backside of the TV, very slim and not heavy at all. I think it says 65 or 70 lbs. Anyhow, I was able to lift it by myself (I'm a girl :))onto the TV stand which is about 3 or 4 ft high. I would have went with a black base though to better match the rest of the TV. Eventually I will mount it on the wall, but for now it sits on the base. (which is a bit bulky)-I like all the applications such as Yahoo, Amazon (can rent/buy movies), You Tube, weather, etc that it has. You have to have an internet connection either by hooking it up directly to the TV w/ the port or wireless. (If you do it wireless, you have to have the Samsung Wireless USB adapter, which is a bummer cause it will run you and additional $80 give or take)-Also, I was hesitant about ordering such a large TV online, but shipping was fast. The site said it would be delivered on a Thursday, but they had called on Thursday to set up a delivery on Saturday. Wasn't a big deal because I still thought it was fast for ordering it on that Monday. The delivery guys carried it into the room I wanted and were super nice. So thats a plus!Cons--Buying a Samsung wireless adapter! Paying 70-80 bucks on a USB stick like adapter is plain crazy! I say throw one in the box because we're paying a lot as it is on the TV. My Samsung home theater came w/ one in the box. What gives?-The big remote (it comes w/ a 2nd small palm size one) drains your batteries. This is because it has like a sensor on it or something that makes the keys light up, so anytime I move my coffee table (I have a rolling lift top coffee table) or touch the remote it lights up. It's a nice feature, but to prevent it from draining the batteries I put it in the TV cabinet and just use my other remote that came w/ my home theater. In this last year I already replaced the batteries twice, which is no biggie but be aware that the slightest touch will turn the light on.UPDATE:So, I have now owned the TV for about 1 yr with no problems, and its been great. Sometimes I wish it was even bigger than it already is!! The volume which was mentioned in other reviews isn't the greatest like having a home theater, but once again I am mainly running the volume off my home theater. I only use the TV volume when I am watching movies I order through the Amazon Video on Demand feature. It gets loud enough, but as far as awesome sound effects/bass, it isn't happening (I do have a small living room though). But, I don't think it's a big deal for those who don't care about this. Also, I got to check the latest downloads to see if Netflix is available. As of now, I don't have netflix on the TV apps which I am not sure if I can get it or not. Everyone who has come over has complimented the TV and its clarity. If your still unsure, check it out at your local electronic store before dishing out the money, but you won't be disappointed.

It syncs up nicely and works like a charm.If you choose this blu ray player I would not recommend the optional wireless for the TV.  It comes with the blu ray so it really doesn't appear to buy you much more.I have seen some reviews that were not favorable and it did make me hesitate.  The only issue I would say is with the larger screen and 1080P resolution you will get some screen jutter.  I notice it randomly on TV shows and it does not appear to be tied to the set as much as FIOS.  Because of the inconsistency, I tend to believe this is a FIOS issue (happens on sitcoms and low movement as well as high movement content).  This can be distracting at times, but quite frankly this is an absolute winner!Screen adjustments are easy to navigate and doesn't take much to get the picture dialed in the way you want it.  The backlighting needs to be turned down if you are watching letterbox movies.  the lighting does broadcast from the corners and you will get a white cast from it.

I replaced a Sony Wega XBR tube TV which has given me no problems.  The Sony was a CRT which have been known to go on forever.  It was a 40\" when watching standard def TV and 34\" when watching anything in HD.Once I got a chance to see this TV at some of my local electronics stores I was floored at the clarity and depth this set had.  We'd seen a friends Samsung flat screen which wasn't an LED & were amazed at the 3-D effect you get by watching their unbelievably high dynamic contrast ratios (when compared to anything else on the market at this price point). I researched for a few months before deciding on the Samsung UN55B8000.  I know there is an 8500 series with backlit LED's & that can dim and brighten seperately (local dimming), but after looking at both I couldn't justify spending an extra $1700 on top of what the 8000 cost.After spending countless hours price searching locally & on the web I couldn't even come close to the price I paid at Amazon!  Once you throw in free shipping with in home delivery through Pilot delivery services and three year interest free financing with the Amazon store card... it was a no-brainer for me.p.s.  You will hear other reviews about the sound not being so great.  It's true.  The speakers are in the back of the TV.  I haven't mounted mine on the wall yet but I can only imagine what the sound will be like then.  A lot of other reviewers also will throw in that if you're spending this much on a flat screen (which I guess are notoriously bad for sound... again this is my first flat screen) that you should spring for a great surround system or at least a sound bar.  I personally don't mind the sound... it just doesn't come from the front of the TV like a lot of people are used to.  Trust me... it's nothing like my Sony.  The sound that came out of it was like having an amazing stero system inside the TV (it's also about 2 feet in depth and weighs 302 lbs!).All in all I love my new Samsung 55\" LED TV and would definitely recommend it to anyone who's balking at the decision.", "Date": "February 3, 2010"}, {"Title": "UN55B8000 55 Inch 240HzTV", "Author": "F.

But if you want an honest appraisal in layman's terms, then although I can say that this isn't a bad TV, neither is it a super major leap forward in picture quality either. Sure the black looks black (perhaps on a par with a decent plasma type) and the higher frequency maybe cuts down on the fast movement blur compared with a lower refresh rate LCD, but I see this as more of a small step towards convergence between plasma and LCD in terms of picture contrast combined with a lightweight package, than any revolution in TV technology. For sure it's thin compared with other STD offerings, and if gaining an extra inch or so in your room width is so important to you then this might just be the TV for you. If on the other hand you are hoping for a major technological leap forward in viewing pleasure then I think this is more in the mind than in the flesh so to speak. Let's face it, the technology offerings today are realistically more a choice between design of the packaging and aesthetics of the unit more than any startling difference in performance, and until the consumer electronic brands develop technologies that defy reality in our minds eye, then from 8ft away the differences between the mid to best offerings on the market today are minor to say the least.

Now when holographic 3 dimensional TV comes onto the market I might have a different view, but until then, it's a TV after all, with all the same drivel of programming that was there way before the cathode ray technology became a thing to ridicule. Bottom line, if you would like to pay extra for a TV that will hug your wall and save an inch or two then go for it, otherwise you will probably be just as happy with a decent offering of LCD or plasma technology, and save the extra money to invest in some compact fluorescent lamps to light your house (compared with regular incandescent light bulbs) that would save a lot more energy than the savings you will gain from firing up this TV a few hours per day compared with LCD or plasma.

There are even numerous Youtube postings with the exact same problems as in my DEFECTIVE SAMSUNG model, as well as the same DEFECT in other models.  This defect occurs upon start-up, and lasts for the first 15 minutes of trying to view a program. Then the picture gets progressively worse over time and continuously declines.I tried SAMSUNG's Executive Customer Relations Dept. and was told:  \"We will do nothing but refer you to a local Authorized Repair Shop.\"  They were downright blunt and rude to boot!  I feel robbed of $2,900.00The repair will consist of a diagnosis visit, and then another visit to install a replacement \"Panel\" that costs $1,300.00 for the part plus $279.00 to install, plus taxes......all told, another $1,719.16....basically, buy another TV.SAMSUNG customer service also told me that their Televisions depreciate at 20% per year, and they do not repair any of their products after 4 years!  Their own repair people told me to just buy a new set!!!If I save one family the heartache of losing they're hard-earned money, I'll be happy!SAMSUNG CONS:No Customer SupportSystemic Panel DefectGhosting of imagesBurn-in on screenDistorted pictureVery expensive to repair", "Date": "November 29, 2013"}, {"Title": "Beautiful Picture, Sleek Design", "Author": "strongwoof \"John\"", "ReviewID": "R2IDDCJ0VLOW7V", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Have had this unit for several years now.

We were debating for a while whether to get a Plasma or LCD, but after doing a lot of research and reading on line reviews we decided to get a LCD tv and narrowed our choice to the Samsung LED. WOW, what a difference between our old Sony and this, it is mind blowing. the picture is so crisp and clear and looks beautiful. we did not even tweak the controls, just out of the box, it is  good enough for us. However there are a couple of issues I am not happy with.1. the sound is pretty atrocious. It sounds very tinny and the volume is very low. Even at full volume level, some times we can hardly hear. Also, the sound itself is not very clear. Since we invested so much money into the TV, we decided to get a surround system. So we got the Samsung surround system with amplifier and 5 speakers. I am not a techie so it took me a day or so to figure out the connections and adjust the amplifier and finally the set up worked well. The Samsung amplifier is not that great compared to some others like Yamaha but is quite acceptable.2. It would have been nice if it has one more component inputs because we have a DVD player that has component output and a VCR that has only A/V output. So we cannot connect both of them to the TV at the same time, and we have to fiddle with the connections when we want to switch between them. After a while we got tired of this and got a Samsung blu-ray player, and that is working beautifully because it has the internet connection also and we can watch the instant movies from Netflix. I must say that this inconvenience of not having enough component inputs is not going to an issue couple of years from now because all the devices that have been made in the recent years have HDMI input but this is the transition period and still many people have the DVD, VCR, and game consoles that do not have HDMI outputs. But like we did, an amplifier system would solve these problems.If it is not for the above 2 issues, I would have given this TV 5 star rating. It still deserves 4 1/2 stars. The bottom line is - we are very happy with this set and highly recommend.

The picture quality is fantastic and the 240hz feature takes some getting used to, but brings you closer to the movies in a more personal way. 240hz will seem a little weird at first, but give it a try.  One thing I have to note, however, is that the \"flashlighting\" \"spotting\" effects have unfortunatly made their way to my TV since day one.  I do most of my watching in the evening in a dark room, so whenever the screen goes to black I see the splotching clearly and bright as day.  It's really a let down for how much I paid ($2,500 in december, ill get to that later..) . .For the price of this TV they should have really ironed out those problems beforehand, or do a recall or a firmware update to fix it.  I heard it has something to do with the LED being side lit.  Inexcusable in my opinion.  Lastly, I am very disapointed to see the price of the B8000 55\" go down $600 a week after I purchased it for a whopping $2,500.  Technology advances, I can understand, but they should have let the consumers know the \"C\" line was coming.  So basically,  IF I would have waited a couple weeks I could have gotten a UN55C7000 with almost twice the contrast ratio,  3d ready, and no flashlighting.  I really feel screwed over.  After viewing the FAQ on the samsung website, they claim the B series is not 3d ready and never will be 3d ready.  So those of us who just upgraded to what we thought was the cutting edge, best, new LED TV two weeks ago will be quick to learn the TV is infact an incompitant and over priced LED TV.Now that the television has dropped nearly $800.00 in price, it really is a great buy for ANY consumer.  You're getting a lot of TV for that price.  If you have the opportunity to grab the C7000 for five hundred dollars more, definetly go for it.

Naim", "ReviewID": "R2J64JBLLO6ZHA", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "Well I purchased the Samsung 55 inch 8000 series LED LCD. After months of research and comparing it to Sony, this LCD has one of the best image quality in the market. Watching Blu ray on this LCD is just awesome. In terms of picture quality it beats the Sony Z series and all the Sony series, however the Sony XBR is almost the same as this.The sound is really not that bad if you look at how slim this LCD is, so you can connect it to a sound bar or Bose cinemate. Another thing is that this does not have digital audio out, and only has a 3.5m stereo audio out. You need to buy a cable tree to RCA to connect to a home theatre or sound bar.It comes with a lot of other drawbacks as well and sometimes I wonder if I should have gone with a Sony. The 240hz is just a gimmick. I am very sure the 120hz does the job so no need to consider this. As for the 2ms pixel response time on the 8000 is also one thing that a human eye cannot tell the difference. The 7000 series 4ms response time is the same. These are tactics to sell the units.I am very sensitive to Motion blur, and the reason I bought the 8000 was so that I don't regret buying the 7000. But I was wrong. It clearly makes sense to buy the 7000 series as it will do the same job with the 120hz. But I have to say in Motion especially while watching analogue channels and sports channels, Sony XBR and Z series do the job perfectly. Nothing can beat a Sony in motion delivery. My next LCD will be a Sony because of Motion issues with Samsungs.Also another thing to note is the reflection on this LCD. It is a lot especially for my apartment as I have floor to ceiling windows. But since I have curtains it is not that bad. But still Sony are better in this category as well.And lastly i would say that the 8500 series is almost out now, so anyone buying the 8000 should wait and go for the local dimming LED technology in the 8500 series. But if you cant wait, then buy the 7000 series and not the 8000 series as difference is minimal.

Wilson \"paul\"", "ReviewID": "ROPJ6RBHDXCIE", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I purchased this tv after owning a Toshiba 46 inch DLP for almost 7 years.The picture quality of the DLP was excellent; it had a very \"theater like\", somewhat grainy presentation that everyone enjoyed.It's killer problem, of course, was the lamp.  They kept blowing, at $150 apiece, every year or two.  I got very frustrated with that, and so did most manufacturers, who stopped making them.But as I say, great 720p experience.So I thought I would get away from all that and go to a more mainstream, updated LCD experience with the LED Samsung.I read about \"motion blur\" and so went for the 240hz refresh rate, which videos said really corrected the problem.But upon watching the tv, I experienced something I had not to that point read about, \"Soap Opera Effect\".  It involves a technical discussion that I won't get into, but the result is that many programs and movies look as though they were shot with a camcorder or that the viewer is watching video tape, hence the \"soap opera\".Everyone in my family noticed it.  So I went back online and read what others had to say about this issue. To shapen the picture and reduce motion blur, the tv comes from the factory with a default setting called \"auto motion plus 240Z\" enabled. This setting is what people say causes the soap opera effect.The \"fix\" for the wierd viewing this causes is to turn that function completely off.Well, not so great to have to disable a feature that supposedly made this tv a more worthy LCD.  Then, if you watch a football game or \"certain movies\", you will need to reenable the setting to avoid blur.  Great.I guess I didn't do enough research.  I trusted that a brand like Samsung would have technical stuff together.  Had I known about this, I probably would have gone for plasma instead, which doesn't have this inherent problem.  I stayed away from plasma because of its old burn in issues (which have mostly been solved) and because of reports of gradual fading of the picture.But that may have been a bad decision on my part.  It is difficult to find a DLP below 60 inches these days.  DLPs have solved the lamp problems by going to LED also, and DLP is a great picture, so I sort of wish I could go back to that.Before I turned off \"auto motion\" my wife wanted to return the tv, but this is not easy since we bought it through Amazon instead of the local Best Buy.  I will update my experience at a later date, as we have only had the set for about a week.Anyway, this was/is a very expensive LCD/LED TV to have to watch programs rendered \"soap opera\" like.  So I am a bit disappointed.  This problem must apply to most if not all LCD technology, so lesson learned (too late)", "Date": "June 29, 2010"}, {"Title": "Amazing Picture!", "Author": "Hunter \"Gatormaster960608\"", "ReviewID": "R6TF75PNK5HYM", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This Tv has been great!

Bottom line I contacted them over two week ago and was told I had to return the TV, which I was unwilling to do, asked them to send me a new stand, they finally agreed. Well I'm into week four and still haven't received the stand, when I called they gave me some bull that the order was entered but not processed, here I am still waiting for a stand. TV quality is excellent, does have the edge lighting issues you've probably read through, but does not interfere with the outstanding picture.

The other reviews I read before I purchased were pretty acurate- great color, really deep blacks for an LCD, and many setting options to get the picture JUST right. The other thing the reviews were acurate about was the \"spot light\" effect you get in the corners on dark scenes, although it's not nearly as noticable when I turned the backlight and brightness levels down to where they should be. My few complaints are- nobody mentioned in the review that the included remote is RF- not IR! this is a prob for anyone who is like me and has a universal learning remote that's IR. I have a Sony av3000 I've been using without complaints for awhile (I know it's probably time to upgrade, just wasn't prepared to drop another few hundy just yet!). Actually I'd apreciate it if anyone can tell me if the harmony 1100 will control this tv- let me know. Only other complaint is the 240hz- it's worthless people, don't get me Wrong it works.... Almost TOO good if possible! It takes ALL the motion blur away, giving movies a STRANGE \"soap opera\" appearance. I had to turn it off for all my inputs besides the cable box- 240 works well for sports and live tv- NOTHING ELSE! If u wanna save a few $$ get the 120hz and do yourself a favor.

Upon receiving my LED TV without any adjustment, the picture quality was AWESOME.  I looked at the four corners for lighting and didn't see any...  I spoke with a Best Buy Rep. and he showed me what causes the light to shine from the 4 corners.  It all because people have gone into the settings and adjusts some features and the light shines out...  He did a demo for me and there it was plain as day...  So basically I have never seen the light shinning from the corner on my TV...  Over all this is the best TV I've ever view and you can't go wrong in buying one...
