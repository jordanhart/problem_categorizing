The set was delivered on time, for free, with Amazon's white glove service.  Within a few minutes it was plugged in, hooked up to an Oppo BDP-95 disk player, and playing Hubble Imax.  The only adjustment I made was to set the video to 'Cinema' mode. The picture can only be described as absolutely stunning. An incredibly smooth, film-like picture with an amazing depth to it.  It blows away any flat screen I've seen.  If you have the depth (about 12\" at the screen and 15\" at the base) this set is well worth considering.  Plus, the laser will never fade or burn out, and the screen will also never fade or have burn-in issues.  I can see why Mitsubishi stubbornly keeps manufacturing these sets - a niche product for sure but absolutely state of the art.", "Date": "December 6, 2011"}, {"Title": "WONDERFUL WONDERFUL SPECTACULAR !!!!!!!!!!!!", "Author": "JENNIFER MURPHY", "ReviewID": "R2MBUT1JWI2W7E", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I have just recieved my new Laser vue L75-94 television .It is awesome, I traded down from the 82 inch Mitsubishi with all the bells and whitsles however the quality of the picture on my new Laser vue is spectacular and more than compensate for being smaller but still large . You really cannot compare the two it is like comparing  an apple and a tomato they both are red but totally different. This set is better than Plasma , Led  or anything on the current market other than another Laser vue L75-94.

The picture is the brightest of any TV I have owned. I replaced a Mitsubishi 82737 82\" with this smaller set, and even though it is smaller it is so much brighter and clearer that it was well worth the trade off and additional expense. I highly recommend this set.", "Date": "November 2, 2011"}, {"Title": "Best TV I've seen", "Author": "Rudy Escobar", "ReviewID": "R2CAKG1LCXDKKZ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "When I first got the TV the default settings weren't all that great, everything is set on 31 except Contrast so the TV itself needs calibration. After I changed the settings in Cinema mode it is by far the best looking set I've set eyes on. The colors pop out more than even a plasma. I own a Samsung 3D plasma TV and the Laservue has the better color, resolution, deeper blacks, and better motion for movies than the plasma by far. I've never seen a Pioneer Kuro plasma in person, but Mitsubishi compared the two side by side in the past. The Film Mode has outstanding motion when i watch blu ray movies or video content. It's like real film quality, it's nothing like LED/LCD's soap opera look. The Laservue has more color than a plasma and almost as bright as an LCD which is the best from both worlds the way I see it. And uses less than 100 watts so you can't go wrong with that.I love this set and am glad with my purchase, this is actually the first HD TV that has absolutely nothing wrong with it. The Samsung plasma I have used up a lot of electricity, which also got real warm when on and made a room feel about 10 degrees warmer. I tried LED but there were some issues with the one that was sent to me so I returned it. Great picture but also couldn't get use to the soap opera look to it. And even though it was a high end LED with 240Hz, it still had signs of motion blur. This laservue has no motion blur whatsoever. I've done a lot of research and the lasers don't dim over time or the picture of the set doesn't decay over time like plasma and LCD/LED. The TV is beautiful to look at to say the least. Cost a lot but worth the money, I will update later and put down the settings I have for Cinema Mode if interested in checking it out.", "Date": "May 2, 2012"}, {"Title": "A Magnificent TV", "Author": "Doug L. Hoffman \"Dr. D\"", "ReviewID": "R43ZJ1CJVCEI5", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I purchased one of these before the price dropped at Christmas time and I still do not regret it. The picture is luscious, with vibrant color and excellent skin tones. The thin black border makes the picture look like it is floating in space, totally superior to my previous 70 inch Sony. Not only is the set great, Mitsubishi's service is also a cut above.When my set arrived I was so overwhelmed by the magnificent picture that it took me several weeks to realize the the picture at the bottom of the screen slanted from left to right with a drop of about an inch. Most of the time this didn't much matter but sometimes, such as when watching a news channel with a ticker across the bottom of the picture, it was really obvious. With much trepidation I called the Mitsu 800 number and found them very helpful, quickly arranging to send out a repairman from the closest authorized service provider (about 35 miles). A pair of technicians showed up and, using a hidden maintenance mode, realigned the picture. Very quick and easy.Not only were they responsive in fixing the flaw, a few days later Mitsubishi called me back to see if everything was taken care of to my satisfaction. All I can say is: customer service, what a concept! A great TV and great service, you can't go wrong here.", "Date": "January 13, 2012"}, {"Title": "Not subpar at all, \"John\"", "Author": "Concerned Shopper", "ReviewID": "R3KXYH6TPCA76A", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "3 of the 4 reviews thus far were 5 stars and \"verified purchases\".

All TV types have their pros and cons John, and I have never see ANY new TV that deserved only 1 star.", "Date": "December 14, 2011"}, {"Title": "Best Picture I could find", "Author": "Nate", "ReviewID": "R1P29BIU4FKE3J", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I spent a lot of time looking for \"The last primary TV set that I would ever need\" and ended up buying The Mitsubishi L75-A94 Laservue. I didn't buy it from Amazon, I bought it from a local furniture and appliance store to avoid any delivery problems that may occur (you can google and see where a few people have had problems where people have their sets delivered broken).The picture quality in the store wasn't that great, but I could tell that it had great potential. I paid for it and picked it up the next day. After I got it home, I spent a few hours calibrating the color and geometry (it wasn't very good out of the box). After calibration, the picture quality was incredible! Colors are so clear and real looking! Gradients are extremely smooth and blacks are black as the TV when it is turned off. You also can't see any pixels. My eyesight is very good and even the best plasma and LED TVs have that \"screen door\" effect to me, but not this one. The \"pixels\" are essentially blended together so, if you look very closely, you can't see any space between them.The set is HUGE! I've had trouble getting it to fit just right in my living room and I had to rearrange my furniture to get it in just the right place. It obviously can't be hung on the wall.Some points that could make some people not like it:1. It can't be hung on the wall. (If this is more important to you than picture quality, then go buy something else)2. The screen is glass, so it is heavy AND very reflective. You need to be able to control the light in the room you place it in.(I had to get blackout curtains for my room)3. It doesn't have any special smart tv features. (This didn't bother me, because I have a PS3, XBOX 360, Wii, HTPC, and Dish Network hooked up to it. If you need Smart TV stuff, spend $50-$100 on a Roku or something)4. It doesn't have PIP. (None of the DLP sets I have used have PIP. I'm not sure why, but it doesn't really matter)5. Imperfect Geometry. (If you want a TV to use as a computer monitor and straight lines across the screen are important to you, be prepared to spend a lot of time calibrating the geometry. You could, instead, hire a professional technician to calibrate it for you)Aside from those drawbacks, it still has the best picture I've seen on a TV to this date. By \"Best Picture\" I mean most real looking. You can, however, switch it's mode to something like Super Brilliant and watch an animated film like Disney's 'Sleeping Beauty' to get a real sense of the intensity of the color it can output.I can honestly say that my TV looks better than any movie theater in my area. If you've go the cash to buy it and the room to put it in, this is the TV you can really show off to your friends and they will all be jealous.", "Date": "September 4, 2012"}, {"Title": "Laservue L-75 A94 - Don't Hesitate", "Author": "Tucson Jim \"Trekguy\"", "ReviewID": "R160AX3EG5AK6L", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I am writing this review although I purchased directly through Walt's TV as I live in Arizona and was able to visit the showroom.I have had three previous HD TV's starting with ta 60\" 4:3  in 2001 (floor model) that could not be repaired so the retailer upgraded me to a projection 65\" 16:9 in 2003.  Moved in 2006 so sold that baby and got a Mitsubishi 65\" DLP in 2006 but always thought the room needed a bigger TV. I procrastinated a bit but finally jumped on the Laservue this year even though Mitsubishi is getting out of the business.  I am providing all of this background just so you realize I am very much accustomed to HD yet this Laservue is beyond belief.  The depth of picture is extraordinary with colors vibrant right out of the box.  What was truly unbelievable was the blu-ray release of Avatar (non-3D)better then being in a movie theatre and then some.  Action is smooth, depth of picture is phenomenal and colors extraordinary (I used the cinema setting for the movie) The controls are easy to work with and and the only issue I have is that I was unable to hook up to my wireless network as it is WEP and the TV needs it to be WPA security.. If you want a big TV that is gorgeous and have the room for a rear projection (it is only about 15\" deep) then get this.  I worked with  a really nice guy at Walt's TV, Miles, who also helped me pick out a stand which wound up being a Bello AVSC-2126.  The stand is sturdy and attractive...just don't forget to level it as I forgot to do and will have to move stuff to get the TV off and adjust the stand.  I honestly cannot say enough good things about Miles at Walt's as I had the opportunity to go to Walt's to check out the TV's before purchase.  He is a well informed, no pressure sales guy, that provided good recommendations and alway, ALWAYS quickly responded to e-mails and phone. I saw a reviewer on an L75-A91 also mention Miles.  One word of advice, since Mitsubishi seems to be leaving the retail consumer market I chose a 6 year extended warranty you might want one for peace of mind.  I normally don't get these but did in this case and Miles was more then fair on price for one.  In summary, if you are hesitating, hesitate no longer and grab one of these Laservues before there are none to be had.", "Date": "January 11, 2013"}, {"Title": "Best TV I've Ever Seen", "Author": "DC Tech", "ReviewID": "R2PSO4V3SB0TIF", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I sampled so many sets before I bought this one, I was practically a professional! I evaluated color, sharpness, ease of use, style, brightness, contrast, you-name-it. Many new flat screens (such as Sharp) have taken their premiere products from local dimming to edge-light formats, with a significant loss in quality. This set losses nothing. And it delivers where it matters most. In picture detail, overall performance, setup and ease of use, I found nothing to compare with it. I know Mitsubishi has vacated the business, but their Laservue concierge phone line is there as is their warranty and I feel comfy (at least for now). This is an astounding set and I'm lucky to have found it. Amazon's white glove delivery was professional, on time, and without a scratch or hitch.

Why do I choose this TV?. Because I can not stand DOT (pixels) on LCD, LED. If you look close enough. You will see that straight line will not be true line. Easy way to explain, compare old 35mm picture with Digital picture. Also Plasma TV. give out heat and will not go as big as Laservue. I will try 3D mode later on. I just got Monster Clean power's multiple outlet (Monster HTS 1000 MKIII). The most expensive one. Why not. I did paid so much for TV. Some protection for fraction at the cost of TV. Now I just hope my TV. will not quit like in another posts. The other thing about this TV. It had cooling fans in the back and it will be another subject for maintenance.
