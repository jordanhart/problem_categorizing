{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Struggle, Pain, and Joy", "Author": "Some Dude", "ReviewID": "R35UJBMMRVWQQV", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "This review is for the 60\" model.First Impressions-----------------The box is *huge*.  The TV is *thin*.  Not even an inch at the edge, and maybe just over in the center.  The menus are pretty straightforward.  (I don't care too much about the 3D or Smart features of this TV at the moment, and don't have much frame of reference for how to judge modern 3D, so I can't really review these aspects.)  The screen doesn't seem too glossy, but it apparently works very well as a mirror because I can see a negative image of my kitchen when it's off.Struggle--------One extremely annoying \"feature\" of these TVs that I've found out after purchase is the \"CE Dimming\" feature.  This is not the \"ECO Dimming\" or anything you can control;  It's hard-coded into the certain picture modes (Standard and Native, at least).  This feature is something that will reduce the backlighting when there is mostly black on the screen.  (For example, if there is 100% brightness white text on a pure black screen, it would actually display at a fraction of that intensity due to the backlight dimming).  I've read that this is to reduce the appearance of light bleeding in from the edges, since it's edge-lit.  This \"feature\" annoys me significantly, particularly because I am not allowed to control it.  After searching around I found out this is called \"CE Dimming\" and you can hack it by going into the service menu (you can find the instructions online yourself), however messing with it apparently voids the warranty.  The only picture mode I found that doesn't use this is \"Movie\" mode.  But, movie mode looks terrible with its default settings.After 3 days of struggle, experimentation, and research, I've found settings that actually give me a picture I can call \"good\" or better.  I'm not an expert, but I'm technical and pretty picky.  So, because I have found no calibration settings for this series of TVs yet, I'm going to provide the ones I am using, if only to prevent any of you from having to obsess over this for hours and hours.  I'll offer a little bit of explanation as to why I'm setting it the way I am.  I got some guidance and expertise from a known site, but as of right now they do not have professionally calibrated settings.  What I did is by eye only.Settings--------Picture Mode:  MovieBacklight:  15Contrast:  100Brightness:  46Sharpness:  10Color:  50Tint:  50/50Dynamic Contrast:  OffBlack Tone:  OffFlesh Tone:  0RGB Off:  AutoColor Space:  AutoWhite Balance:  25 for all10p White Balance (R, G, B):  ON - Interval 1: -8, -7, -7 - Interval 2: -10, -3, 2 - Interval 3: -9, -2, 6 - Interval 4: -9, -1, 8 - Interval 5: -10, 1, 10 - Interval 6: -6, 3, 10 - Interval 7: -9, 5, 10 - Interval 8: -1, 5, 8 - Interval 9: -5, 1, 6 - Interval 10: 0, 2, 0Gamma:  0Color Tone:  Warm2Digital Noise Filter:  OffMPEG Noise Filter:  OffHDMI Black Level:  LOWFilm Mode:  Auto2Auto Motion Plus:  ClearLED Motion Plus:  OnComments on the Settings------------------------Movie mode is the only mode I found that doesn't use \"CE Dimming\", which is a huge annoyance to me.  (I'd rather see edge-lighting, easily.  Not sure why I can't control that, Samsung.)  Backlight, brightness, and color are kind of like salt and pepper:  Use to personal taste in your environment.A note about almost all the other settings:  I like an eye-popping, colorful picture as much as the next guy, but I don't like it at the expense of information loss.  From my own experimentation (in Standard and Native modes), all the Dynamic Contrast and Black Tone settings did was flatten out the low end of the blacks.  Dark scenes look like \"paint by number\" with all kinds of banding and digital multiplication/division.  Lame, worthless settings if that is the effect, and a problem in general with \"digital\" stuff.Standard white balance isn't fine-grained enough to make the adjustments to any of the picture modes that are necessary, in my opinion.  I messed with it for a long time, so I know.  :)  The only way to get actual, fine-grained color control is to use the 10p White Balance settings.  Now, I only know this from messing around with it, but what this does is allow you to control the individual colors R, G, and B as 10 different intensities, from black to white.  So, Interval 1 is the darkest reds, greens, and blues (close to black), and Interval 10 is the brightest R, G, and B, close to white.  If you use \"Expert Pattern 1\" you can see how this works.  Short summary?:  Red is WAY over-represented and blue is WAY under-represented when everything is set at 0.  Everything looked neon until I calibrated this, particularly the reds, and greens to some extent.  (Maybe they can create a \"1980's\" picture mode!)The noise filters aren't needed when you have everything calibrated correctly.  They are kind of an excuse for having the eye-popping over-saturated settings that Standard and Dynamic mode come with.  I'm not too sure on the Film Mode and LED Motion Plus.  They didn't give me any noticible changes.  The Auto Motion plus is nice, but I found that it starts getting choppy when you have other effects going on, including a lowered sharpness (I imagine it must be doing some extra calculations for that.)  So, I only set it to Clear because it doesn't seem to get choppy with that set, but still provides some stability and smoothness in fast scenes.Overall-------I give the picture (once it is set correctly) a 5/5.  The fact that I can't adjust certain \"features\", combined with the level of screwing around it requires to make the picture look good makes me lower that.  Seriously Samsung... why can't there be a default mode in here that has professionally calibrated settings?  You must know that the reds are way too saturated, right?  You can still set it to \"Standard Mode\" by default to create eye-popping pictures that make people buy the TV.  But with all your expertise, why not just have a mode that has all this stuff pre-calibrated and save us the time?EDIT (2012-05-28):  After further tinkering, I think I have refined settings to make the picture pop a little more without ruining the picture.  Use above settings, but adjust to these:Dynamic Contrast:  LOWBlack Tone:  DarkerHDMI Black Level:  LOWColor Space:  Native***********************EDIT (2012-11-06):  Now there are finally professionally calibrated settings available (have been for a few months).  You can do a search for \"un60es6500 calibration\" and it's one of the top results.  But, there are problems with those settings.  The major one is the regular \"White Balance\" blue offset setting.  They say to use 28.  The problem with this is that increasing the offset makes the black baseline move up.  So, 100% black now appears brighter.  I've adjusted their settings and come up with a slight modification that I think looks fantastic.  (Also, my experience with the latest firmware 001023 from Nov 1 was NOT GOOD.  It wouldn't allow any picture mode except Dynamic.  I did a factory reset, and things are better now.)Picture Mode  MovieBacklight  17Contrast  100Brightness  45Sharpness  10Color  60Tint  G50/R50ADVANCE SETTINGSDynamic Contrast  LowBlack Tone  OffFlesh Tone  0RGB Only Mode  OffColor Space  Native10pt White Balance  OnGamma  -1Expert Pattern  OffxvYCC  OffPICTURE OPTIONSColor Tone  Warm2Digital Noise Filter  OffMPEG Noise Filter  OffHDMI Black Level  LowFilm Mode  Film2Auto Motion Plus  ClearLED Motion Plus  Off10PT WHITE BALANCEONInterval Red Green Blue1  0  -1  -12  -1  -1  -13  0  0  04  -1  0  +15  -1  -1  +16  -1  -1  -17  -1  -1  -18  0  0  09  +1  0  010  +2  0  0WHITE BALANCESetting  ValueR-Offset  25G-Offset  25B-Offset  25R-Gain  18G-Gain  23B-Gain  25***********************EDIT (2012-12-02):  I've recently updated to the latest firmware version 001024 and I think it is an improvement.

Looks great to me!***********************EDIT (2013-01-02):  I've recently updated to firmware version 001025.  I might be me imagining it, but I think the video quality degraded slightly, and the issue with SmartHub (where the SmartHub will just pop up randomly, for a second or two, for no reason) is still there.  Samsung needs to get their sheet together, because this is just silly, for a $2000 product.  But hey, once you've got their money, who cares!***********************EDIT (2013-02-18):  The SmartHub problem is fixed now.  It apparently just needed to be updated to the latest version, and wasn't an issue with the firmware, as I'm still on 001025 and haven't had that issue in over a month.", "Date": "May 18, 2012"}, {"Title": "Excellent 3D TV, the \"Smart\" stuff isn't great but I don't care.", "Author": "Brian", "ReviewID": "R1FFF10WIR2X5A", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I got this TV to upgrade from an older Samsung 46\" 60htz LCD which I loved.  I spent a lot of time comparing TV brands when buying that first TV and didn't have to do much shopping for this one.  I knew that I loved Samsung's picture over any other TV except for some of the Sony Bravias but they're overpriced IMO.  I wanted a 55\" 3D with at least 120htz and this one fit the bill.  I bought the last one on Amazon so I came back here for this purchase.  They delivered it quickly and it was in perfect condition as expected.I was initially aprehensive about this TV after seeing it only got 3 1/2 stars in customer reviews so I read all the reviews.  I found that the people who gave the TV a negative review were all upset about the Smart TV internet features.  Slow connectivity when using a browser, Netflix, Youtube, etc.  I understand their reason for being upset because a TV that includes those features should function properly.  Unfortunately these rely heavily on your internet connection speed which may not be fast enough to support them.  Oh well, buy a faster internet plan.  This TV is on the low end of the Smart TV spectrum so I wouldn't expect those features to perform as well on it considering the other 3 models above it have dual core processors built into them to handle that.  Buy one of those models with the dual core if you're main reason for having a TV is to surf the internet or watch youtube.  Or just use your computer for that like the rest of us.  The actual \"TV\" is top-notch and the 3D is spectacular!I agree with some of the reviewers that the picture needs tweaking to get it right.  I was fully prepared for that because I had to tweak my last Samsung for a while before getting the picture just right but once it's set, it's awesome.  This TV has even more options to tweak so it can get confusing for the inexperienced but it's capable of producing one of the best pictures out there if you know how to tune it.  The Dynamic, Standard, and Native picture modes are actually pretty useless unfortunately.  Set it to Movie mode and start tweaking.  Yes, it starts out dark so increase the backlighting and brightness, bump up the color and sharpness, high auto contrast, darkest black level, etc... If anyone wants my specific settings I'll list them if you ask.The 3D is simply awesome.  Home theater 3D isn't going to be as good as going to an IMAX theater but it's still pretty sweet.  One thing to keep in mind is that the picture mode settings that you did in TV mode don't carry over to 3D mode nor do they carry over to the other sources, HDMI in, Component In.  So, if you have a PS3 hooked up to HDMI you'll have to edit the picture settings for that source to match the main TV settings so you get the same picture in both.  Game Mode limits the amount of settings you can tweak so you have to use your judgement with that but if you match everything you can it'll work out fine.  Just remember to turn Game Mode OFF before watching movies because it degrades picture quality.I'm sure this isn't the best review out there for the TV but it might be of some use to some of you.  If you're considering a 3D TV and you're not overly concerned with using it as a web browser and just want a great TV then this is it.  Once dialed in, the picture is fantastic and the price is right.  If you're interested in the Smart TV features MORE than watching a great and inexpensive 3D TV then pay more money for the next models in the series that have the dual core processor.  Regardless, stick with a Samsung because it's always the best picture for the money.", "Date": "July 9, 2012"}, {"Title": "Second Samsung TV", "Author": "PeteReviews", "ReviewID": "R84ZRAV11PV72", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "After purchasing a Samsung UN55D7000 about 6 months ago (2011 model) which I was very happy with, I needed a new TV for my bedroom and this model was the perfect size and it had many of the same features.This TV is the 2012 model and is still fairly new, they are still working out the bugs with the smartTV side for the 2012 models at Samsung. I noticed that this TV does not have the HBO2GO app yet and I read how it is because it is a 2012 and the app has to be changed.Also the Browser is not working, this could be an issue with just my tv but I tested it and it would not connect.I compared this TV next to the D7000 and it was exactly the same but it did not have the \"spotlighting\" that occurs on the 2011 models. The blacks seem much blacker also.I have not tested the 3D part, one good this is that this model comes with 2 pairs of glasses, they are the ones with batteries you have to replace and they do not recharge but I did not buy it for the 3d part.I tested the Pandora app and it worked the same as other my other TV.

I don't know why people are rating the TV low because of this (downgrade) feature.  Having previously owned the UN55D6000, which had 4 HDMI inputs, I never made use of all 4 HDMI ports anyhow because I do own an Onkyo 607 receiver with a built in 5 HDMI switcher.Here is how I use the HDMI labeled ports:1) HDMI/DVI (recommended for PC use) - connected to my HTPC computer, very sharp clear text in 1920x1080 resolution with Windows 72) HDMI 2 - connected directly to Sony 3D BX58 BLU RAY player (since my Onkyo 607 does not support 3D, but planning on buying Onkyo 616 through Amazon). Amazing picture quality. Be sure to use a high speed (10.2gbps) HDMI cable to playback 3D content.3) HDMI 3 - connected to Onkyo 607 receiver (cable box, Asus Oplay media player, Xbox 360, PS3)The TOSLINK (optical output on TV) however does not pass through HD-MASTER, TRUHD, or any other high fidelity sound other than Dolby Digital and PCM. The only way to achieve this is to connect your blu ray player through your surround sound receiver.The speakers sound OK, but only use them when watching conventional TV programming.  Surround sound is used mostly especially during movies and sporting events.PICTURE QUALITY---------------Default settings set the contrast level at '14' which is too low for my taste.  I did some calibration to match my UN55D6000 set and found the UN60ES6500 to be a tad bit dimmer than the UN55D6000, maybe because of the new semi-gloss finish on the screen.  Again, I will come back in two weeks to update this section after I have found the perfect settings for each of the 3 HDMI inputs, which can be configured independently.Now for the 3D part... I don't have an actual 3D blu ray movie just yet, and will update in 2 weeks when I do watch one.  However, I was able to view 1920x1080 24p/30p demos on my Sony 3D blu ray player and watched various content including music videos, sports, and PS3 games.  I've seen plenty of store demos on 3D, and after playing around with the UN60ES6500 3D features, I must tell you that 3D has come a long way especially on this unit.  The UN60ES6500 3D feature is simply mind blowing!!  You may have seen 3D, where it feels like the 3D only goes 'into the TV' and not protrude out towards you.  The UN60ES6500 3D feature DOES COME OUT at you, and with great depth!  I've seen some LG models that their 3D content goes 'out of the TV', but let me tell you the demos I've watched last night REALLY came out!! I'm very amazed Samsung, job well done here!  Even the 2D->3D worked impressively well, but again not as good as REAL3D video footage.Again, I will come back and update this in 2 weeks from 4/26/2012.  Hope this helped some of you in rethinking about buying the UN60ES6500.

To give an example there was a video of the Golden Gate Bridge and I've been there in person and so I know what color it is in real life...\"Natural\" made the bridge look bright orange, the only thing that looks good under \"Natural\" are peoples faces, everything else looks wrong.Another massive problem with this set is the backlight dimming, unless you set the backlight setting to normal (Which seems to overide the auto dimming) the TV changes brightness so rapidly it feels like someone is turning a light on and off in front of your eyes, also keep in mind that while using the Samsung Apps (Netflix, etc..) the picture settings are completely on their own and don't use anything you might have made changes toOne last problem I had with this set is the wireless only worked once and then it wouldnt connect so I had to switch to wired ethernet.

I tried everything: using different HDMI cables, going through every single option in both the TV and my PS3, read every internet article about the subject, and nothing worked.

In the end they sent a guy to my house, who of course didn't know what the the problem was either, so he just decided to replace the main board on my tv. I am happy to say that the 3D functionality started working after that, but man, it took them a long time to finally conceed that the problem was on their end. In fact, they actually made me buy a Samsung Blu-Ray player just to make sure it wan't a problem that somehow all my external devices had.Still, I'm going to give the TV 4 stars because I'm quite happy with it now that it works, plus I haven't seen anybody else having the same issue in forums.

If I had paid anything near MSRP I'd probably have to be more critical. I bought this TV because I liked the idea of having the \"Smart Hub\" internet TV features. I was in the market to replace my 34\" Sony Wega XBR CRT, and also replace the Netflix and streaming features of my PS3 due to it being an older system and wishing to extend it's life. The 3D feature to me was a bonus, but not a requirement in my shopping. I has somewhat fallen in love with the LG 6700 series with passive 3D but found this for a much lower price. The TV was well packaged and unboxing it and setting it on it's included stand was a snap. Setup takes quite some time to get all the advanced features up and running. Out of the box, the picture was fairly terrible. The backlight is turned all the way up and therefore on any black screen the edge lighting bleeds badly. There is also some clouding in the middle of my screen when the backlight is all the way up. Reducing the backlight level to 14 significantly reduced this tendency but it's still slightly problematic. Coming from the CRT world, I'm used to black being black so it's a bit of a let down but I realized this comes with the territory with edge lit LED/LCD sets. The color accuracy and gamut are nice, the picture out of the box is vivid to a fault and needs to be dialed back a bit to provide accurate color. The picture and the processing once adjusted are very nice. A HD signal from Blu-Ray or a STB is hard to fault. Even SD programming looks great, probably helped by the fact that this is a 40\" set. The Smart Hub features all seem to work well, with the exception of AllSharePlay. It will not play back .mkv files which seem to be how all the 3D SBS content that can be downloaded from the internet is packaged. Fortunately, old friend PS3 has no problem streaming these from my MBP to the set. In fact the set would not play back the .mkv files even when an external drive was plugged directly in to the TV. A neat feature is the ability to control the set through your iPhone. I don't use it that often but it is a feature that works well. It's much easier to enter text in this manner. The 3D feature works well and is a plus for truly immersive viewing. The provided glasses are light and comfortable, and I have not experienced any flickering or eyestrain in my experience. The sound is adequate but any serious movie watching deserves a decent sound system. If you want a set with some high-end features and a slick aesthetic design, and can accept some small PQ warts, this is a very nice set.Pros:HD PictureSmart TV FeaturesCustom settings for source/type of programmingMany picture adjustmentsLow power consumptionCons:Unadjusted pictureWon't play back some types of video filesEdge lighting bleed/cloudingSamsung UN40ES6500 40-Inch 1080p 120 Hz 3D Slim LED HDTV (Black)", "Date": "May 20, 2012"}, {"Title": "Basic design flaws", "Author": "D.

My surprise was to find that all connector in the back (except for 2 USB ports and 1 hdmi) where located facing out from the back of the TV. In addition to that the power cord is not recessed either. It comes out more than 1 inch from the back of the tv so when trying to use a low profile mount you simply can't.How come samsung makes these basic mistakes on design? If you buy a slim led tv it is because most likely you are planning to take advantage of the width and have it wall mounted as close as you can to the wall. Any way....the work around for me was to buy recessed outlet box for everything....hdmi, RCA, network, power, etc....and install the box exactly where the terminals in the back panel are. You have to measure perfectly where the recessed box should be located otherwise if you miss the location by .5 inch you are done.....no low profile mount.By the way, to add to samsung's mistakes, the power connector of the tv comes in the opposite side of the av connector on the tv so expect to install a 2nd box to allow the power connector sit on the wall.The TV quality is good and the image is really good....note that I'm not that picky with settings and image quality..formy normal use watcing tv with my family and enjoy the weekend this is a very good tv. If you are planning to install your tv on a tv stand I definitely recommend this tv otherwise add 200usd to 300usd to your budget to get the recessed boxes, connectors,etc and have them installed.", "Date": "May 3, 2012"}, {"Title": "Outstanding tv", "Author": "San", "ReviewID": "R34JRN4NNPD38G", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I purchased the tv recently.

The setup is easy and the picture is great.  Though I would point out, the mount I used for the wall required I go to the hardware store and pick up new mounting screws.  The way the holes are setup on the back of the set, they are indented to a depth greater than the screws that came with the mount.I read a lot of feedback on here before deciding to purchase this set, which I bought for the bedroom.  I have a Samsung in my living room, which I love so going back to a Samsung for the bedroom was a no brainer.  The picture is great but there is a review in here with very specific picture settings.  I recommend using the setup dictated in that review.  It's a pain to set all those settings but the picture truly is fantastic for the price.  My only regret is I don't have the wall space for the larger version!  The sound quality was also much better than I anticipated.I also want to point out that streaming Netflix works great.  I do have a fast cable connection (15 Mbps) with a great Wifi router.

I fiddled with various adjustments and obtained detailed settings from audio visual web site. I even bought a calibration DVD. All with not much improvement. Then I had a very highly qualified certified individual come and do a professional calibration with the proper equipment and software. When he first looked at the settings he said he had never seen a set so far off directly from the factory. However, he was able to calibrate the TV to a very high level. One of his better calibrations that was almost perfectly spot on. The error factors were so small as to not be visible by the human eye. He was very happy and said that only a few TV's he had worked on were calibrated so accurately. Cost was $200. I had purchased a 3D Avatar DVD and he wanted to see the picture quality. After watching the movies for about 20 minutes I suggested we try some 3D off the cable TV. He was very knowledgeable about Avatar and the cameras used and the production techniques. His comment was that this was the best picture and 3D that he had seen on any type or brand of TV anywhere! I guess that was why he spent 20 minutes watching Avatar. He was genuinely impressed.Everything about the TV viewing improved including apparently widening the side viewing angle a bit. As I watch the Olympics with the latest high def TV cameras being used, I am just blown away. Obviously I am extremely happy with my purchase. I had a recent purchase LG 55\" that was also calibrated professionally. It had a very good picture. But the Samsung has a better picture even with a larger screen.My advice: buy from Amazon, keep the packing material until satisfied, have TV calibrated by certified and experienced professional.(If in San Diego area, I highly recommend Bill Ferguson of Coast Calibration in Carlsbad.)", "Date": "August 8, 2012"}, {"Title": "please read this", "Author": "michael pavon", "ReviewID": "R33CZFXKWOY8X", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "i will not talk about the quality of this tv (from the hardware point) or the beautiful image, for those please read the other reviews, i will talk about the \"issues\" with this tv: you are watching a beautiful blu ray movie, you love how it looks, the image is crisp and so clear... and suddenly the image start to dimm by itself, yes start to loose light, and to make long story short, there is almost nothing you can do about it, looks its a \"feature\" built it in this tv, you can turn the eco sensor off and the auto dimm also, but guess what, ;) still nothing.i called samsung and they gave me a lame solution: my hdmi cables are to blame, i fill a service request online and guess what... next day samsung close it without an explanation, anyhow, just google the dimm problem, don't be frustrated as myself good luck.Update 01/29/2013:2 days ago i returned the tv, and got a panasonic gt instead, acording to the reviews one of the best tvs out there, image wise i like better LED, but no bugs and the internet apps soo much better!!I am happy now!", "Date": "January 24, 2013"}, {"Title": "Small flaw made impossible by the worst customer service ever", "Author": "MCC Phoenix", "ReviewID": "RTUCQ6UG0PU7S", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "Would love the TV, except it came with a defect in the screen that Samsung refuses to deal with.

I already own the 55\"ES8000 which is the reason i decided to buy this 2012 model for him, as he has no interest in the extra bells and whistles. Prices have gone WAY down with all 2012 models so i decided to go for it. It was a toss up between this tv and the samsung plasma 60\"F5500. Plasma looked great, but would not work for the type of environment in which my father has his setup. too many windows and the screen was extremely reflective. I got to play with both sets' settings at the store and i could not be happier with my choice. The Led was the winner IMO. Once we set it up,the tv looks and works great! IT has an excellent PQ, specially for beign a 6 series. there is no clouding or edge bleeding with my particular set. I know many people arent so lucky when it comes to this. Its basicly luck of the draw with these samsungs to be honest. The setup was easy thanks to the built in wifi, which works smooth as it can be. I have not checked the 3D because as i said,my old man could care less about 3D. lol All he cares about is his movies and sports. One thing i did notice though, is that the blacks tend to be over saturated with blue at times, particularly in dark scenes. Its not too bad though, and its only something only a few people used to the inky blacks from higher end models will notice. Over all, This tv delivers a great picture for the price.

I do not have cable/satellite, so my plan was to use this television primarily for its Smart features.  Unfortunately, right from the get-go, there were issues with the applications: sound but no picture on Netflix, a green line through the screen on Hulu, and absolutely no connectivity to Amazon Prime.  I worked with the Samsung support team to uninstall an update that was causing issues, which then allowed me to use the apps.Even with the apps working, they did not work as quickly or efficiently as my Roku.  Many of the covers/titles in Netflix still did not show up, but at least it was usable.  The latest issue has caused me to not be able to use the TV at all.  After clicking on an app, it says that it is connecting.  After awhile, it times out and tells me that I am not connected to the internet, so I go into the settings to find that the internet is, in fact, connected yet none of the apps will work.I contacted the support team again only to get this response: \"We apologize for the issue you are having with Smarthub. Please know that the issue is not related to your Samsung device.  We are experiencing high traffic on our server. We ask that you try to access SmartHub at a later time. Again,  we apologize for any inconvenience this has caused.\"  When I explained that the Smart Hub was the only feature that I use, she said, \"We are working to increase bandwidth on our servers to prevent further instances such as this from occurring.\"  Clearly, that is not an immediate solution to the problem.Another, unrelated con to purchasing this TV is that the picture quality is nowhere near a good as some of the older model, flat screen Samsungs.  Even after following instructions to improve picture quality from another reviewer, the picture still looks pixelated and lackluster in comparison with my older model.The bottom line:  If you're planning to use this TV solely for its internet connectivity and Smart features, save yourself the hassle (and a lot of money) and buy a Roku instead.", "Date": "March 3, 2013"}, {"Title": "Very disappointed with Samsung", "Author": "MNWA", "ReviewID": "RRHND3PAXKJY3", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "The Good:1.

Price6. 3D, which is a bonus, tho it's more of a novelty feature for me, not a necessity.Cons:1. green halo, or also known as ghosting effect in certain dark scenes. (i'll elaborate more later on).2. Standard preset is nasty looking, overblown, and over saturated. only setting that's view able is Movie mode. there is also not a lot of room for customization on top of the factory presets. many settings are greyed out for certain factory presets. i would much prefer letting the user to fine tune EVERY setting on top of each factory presets. for example, if you enable Game Mode, you're locked into Standard preset. you're only allowed to adjust the basic color settings, but not 10 point white balance, nor HDMI color space, nor are you able to turn off the CE dimming setting, which is kind of annoying and counter productive. i was hoping that i would be able to combine the game mode with the calibrated movie setting so i won't have to press 5 buttons through 3 different menus each time i want to play a game or start a movie.3. Certain hidden settings that are not customization, ie the CE dimming effect which is present in all the presets but Movie Mode.4. embarrassing manual that might as well be a stack of toilet paper. it serves no purpose what so ever. doesn't give the spec, nor does it advice you on any settings. this is a HUGE step back for Samsung.5. viewing angle isn't as good as plasma or traditional LCD. but i already knew that going in.now if you're wondering about the green halo or ghosting effect. read on. otherwise if you don't know what it is, or have never noticed it, do yourself a favor, forget about it and enjoy this great TV.i did some more extensive research. as it turns out, our european cousins are having the same issue with their european version, also known as ES6300. read this thread starting from the bottom of Page 7 [...]you'll notice that on page 9 someone changed out the Tcon board (also known as Timing Control Board), and he says the ghosting problem is gone. so now i am not sure whether it's the pixel response or some kind of module, but what we can all agree on is, there is a problem.but here's the kicker.... on that thread someone also mentioned that in 3D mode, the problem is none existence. so I came home and tried switch out of the calibrated movie mode and back into standard mode and tried to match the settings of the movie mode to as close i can get so that it's visually indistinguishable as possible. and guess what... the ghosting has gone down tremendously. i mean it's not COMPLETELY gone, but at this it has improved so much to a point that i am no longer thinking about returning the set, because it is almost undicernable now. the only time you'll still notice is during an extreme close up in a dark scene where you have an actor's face taking up half of the screen and the actor turns the face fast. but 99% of the time i can now watch my movies without having to notice those green ghosting effects anymore. i know it's not perfect, but i highly suggest you guys to give the below setting a try to see for yourself.in order to make the Standard mode to match the calibrated movie mode, i had to make some slight changes. mainly due to the fact that Standard mode doesn't have 10 point white balance option.btw, i can attest to the previous user that the Standard mode DOES have some kind of hidden effect applied to it that makes the picture more contrasty compare to the movie mode. even with all the settings matched, the Standard mode picture will still look more contrasty and BRIGHTER than movie mode at the same setting. but here're the settings below you'll need to make in order to get the picture look as close to calibrated Movie mode as close as possible. mind you i work in the motion picture industry doing visual effects, so i have a very keen eye on spotting colors.Picture Mode: StandardBacklight: 12Contrast: 100Brightness: 45Sharpness: 20 (this can be any value you like, won't affect color)Color: 40 (this must be 40, or something VERY close to this value in order to compensate for the slightly overblown/over saturated picture in standard mode)Tint: 50 (default)Advanced SettingsDynamic Contrast: Off (standard mode's dynamic contrast off setting will actually give you the same level of contrast as movie mode setting at LOW)Black Tone: Off (i highly recommend setting this value to OFF on all settings, as setting black tone on anything but off will only crush the shadows, trust me)Flesh Tone: 0RGB: offColro Space: AutoWhite Balance: leave it at default (if you change any of the values here WITHOUT fine tuning the 10 point white balance your color will be wayy off, and since Standard mode does not allow 10 point adjustment you need to NOT touch any of this setting. this is why we changed the COLOR value in the basic picture menu to 40 in order to compensate, so leave this setting unchanged.)Gamma: +1Picture OptionsColor Tone Warm2the rest of the settings that i did not mention you should leave them off. All the noise filter are up to you if you want them, but those won't affect any color.give the above settings a try if you have the 60/65 inch model like i do and have the green ghosting effect. pop back in a movie that you know will have the most amount of ghosting effect, for example Mission Impossible 4 the rail way scene after Tom Cuise escapes from the river and walking to the train, this is my benchmark scene for testing.one thing i do have to note is, since you're now forced to use standard mode, you're forced to use CE Dimming. so that's the only down side, but the up side is.. CE Dimming masks all the clouding issue that you might have.let me know if you have any questions. i am still hoping that Samsung can come out with a firmware update to address this, because if the settings can improve the problem, there's remedy for it. imagine if the TV had looked like this i would've never noticed any of the ghosting and just carry on with my life. so if them come out with a firmware that minimize the majority of the problem, i am willing to bet hardly anyone will notice the problem opening their box of new TV.", "Date": "February 19, 2013"}, {"Title": "This is great", "Author": "Jane Sheedy", "ReviewID": "RK27YQX6H1GSF", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Love the picture, sound is good.

I can, however, tell you about its other characteristics.  If you are not tech savvy or, are a Boomer or, just plain perplexed, I hope this review will help clarify your thinking.It's important to determine what capabilities you want your new TV to have.  Shopping for a television isn't what it was years ago.  Then, all the features you looked for were the tuning buttons and (eventually) the remote control.  TV shopping's come a long way, baby. Prior to shopping for our new TV I researched online using: Consumers Reports; manufacturers' websites; blogs; and online discussions.  When we'd narrowed down what we wanted--and did not care about--we went shopping at the big box and warehouse stores.  Amazingly, at each store our experiences were consistent.  Here is what we found:* The mid-price point televisions that appealed to us were Vizio and Samsung* Viewing these two brands side-by-side, the major difference is picture quality* Samsung's picture is clearer, crisper, with more vivid colors* The refresh rate can be important if you watch a lot of fast action sports.  Blurring occurs at a slower rate.  The higher the refresh rate, the better.* There are off-brand TVs at a lower price, but don't compare well to Samsung* There are more expensive TVs (especially 3-D)* Some TVs offer web capability but, beware; these are predetermined sites set by the manufacturer--browsing is out* Samsung's 6500 allows total browsing, Skyping, etc.* Samsung's TV comes with the remote control--not with the keyboard for web access* Samsung's keyboard (as of this writing) is about $100; the Logitech keyboard (the most recommended by all sales associates) is about $30.  (We got the Logitech and it works fine.)* Samsung offers tech support, if neededWe bought the 50 inch Samsung 6500 to be placed in our family room.  The viewing distance is about 12 feet and is much smaller than the size recommended by Samsung.  (If you go to their site, they offer a way to calculate the size you will need.)  We see no reason to have a larger screen.We want to Skype using our keyboard and TV screen.  Seated 12 feet away from the TV means that we need to get a very good webcam and that viewing us (the party whom we are calling) will not offer a tight close-up at this distance.  From what we have researched so far, the angle is only about 78 degrees.Some final notes:* The Samsung 6500 gives us full internet access--albeit not as rapid as when using our PC* Amazon Prime's instant videos are a pleasure to watch on this TV* Netflix and many other apps are already  programmed* This TV is gaming (such as Wii) capableMost of what I have written so far is objective information.  Here are some subjective thoughts.  We watched THE LIFE OF PI with friends.  This movie has some 3-D moments and although the TV is not 3-D capable, we all felt as though those moments were even more spectacular than the clarity we were enjoying already.  Another time, we were watching a basketball game on our 6500 with friends.  They were impressed with our TV yet again.  As a result, two families are buying this TV.  And two of our kids want the Samsung 6500 for their own homes.  We are delighted with our purchase.

It is amazing. I had this tv purchased and installed by a professional. It looks amazing.However, My husband is hard of hearing and for the last 10 years we have been using CC on all our TVs. I actually like the cc very much. When you miss what a certain character said, you can just read it. It is especially helpful during movies and the box really does not get in the way of the action (unless you are watching news - then it sometimes is in the way of the ticker). Also, you can watch Tv without disturbing anyone late at night and early in the morning. I digress. After a bit of on line searching I discovered that many people are having the same issue with their Samsung TV.Basically, Samsung HD does not support CC, but the coax cable hook up, non HD will show CC. WHAT??? I just purchased a beautiful TV for a pretty penny and I cannot watch it the way I want. I can choose, Closed Captioning or High Def, but not both. This is my last Samsung purchase. The picture may not be as good on my Panasonic, but it was less money and I can still watch HD and read Cc at the same time.Lastly, it does not support the Amazon streaming. Another nail in the coffin. If you don't need CC or Amazon streaming. This is an awesome TV.***************Update Dec 2013 - somehow closed captioning works now. It appears that comcast needed to \"upgrade\" the system in our area. Now we have an option to put closed captioning on. As the other commenter noted it had to be done through the set top box, which we could not do 18 months ago, but can now. I have upgraded my review to 4 stars.I am still annoyed that with a \"smart tv\" I have not been able to get amazon streaming. I also cannot spend any time messing around with it to see if I can now.", "Date": "August 12, 2012"}, {"Title": "Amazing Picture Quality", "Author": "PS3 gamer \"Josh S\"", "ReviewID": "R1KPQGQGQNEO2G", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I purchased this product for my parents who are in their 60's.

Fresh out of the box, the TV had a beautiful picture, and even though I don't consider myself an audio-video expert, I was quickly able to fine tune the picture using the on screen menu. 15 minutes of playing around with the color, brightness, and contrast resulted in screen quality that was as good as I had seen on more expensive televisions in stores. The 3D glasses synced with the TV on the first try, and I was blown away by the look of the 3D - both true 3D content (The Avenger's on 3D BluRay played on PS3) and \"converted\" content (football games on ESPN - not broadcast in 3D).

Still debating should I return it back and get new one. Of course, I am fully aware of having risk to get new one that it may have worse clouding/bleeding or dead pixel. By the way, I don't see any dead pixel on the screen. It looks like Samsung or LG releases their edge-lit HDTV with little or no improving on clouding and bleeding problems. Oh well... If these clouding don't make the picture quality worse, then I will keep HDTV. If you don't like to see clouding or bleeding on HDTV then get backlit LED or plasma instead.While Netflix is connected with no problem via wifi last night, the movie can't start due to this message: \"Sorry that title is not available to watch.

I watch a lot of blu ray movies and fast moving sports and have seen no signs of blur and the clarity is amazing when compared to our earlier Samsung LCD.  The only picture issue I have noticed is a little bit of corner glow, but it is very faint and once it was properly calibrated for the house I have not seen it since.  Also, true blacks seem to be harder for the system to hit than the LCD series, but I guess to lose 20lbs of weight and 1\" thickness nothing can be perfect.In terms of calibration settings I would recommend the one found in the review section here (seems to be the first review you see when you search for this TV).  They work really well for movies and HD tv signals.  It does not work so well for games, but that is what Game Mode is for and with some basic calibration can be made to look just as good.This is a great television and the smart hub is a nice feature.

It's too bad, because I had been a loyal Samsung TV customer for almost a decade, and had sung its praises to friends and family.I have returned the replacement unit and am going to try my luck with a Panasonic Plasma TV specifically, the Panasonic VIERA TC-P60GT50 60-Inch 1080p 600Hz Full HD 3D Plasma TV.If you are a purist when it comes to image quality, avoid this TV.", "Date": "February 7, 2013"}, {"Title": "Excellent TV for the money.", "Author": "Alex", "ReviewID": "R2OJTOU4UR22WR", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Out of the box it didn't wow and amaze me, but after I spent a couple days testing different calibration settings, I can glady say that this TV is capable of excellent picture quality.

Awesome if you don't have an ethernet port nearby or don't want another wire to wrap and bundle.3) Picture - very clear, no dropped pixels. Blacks look real good.  Everything you would expect from Samsung.4) 3D w/2 pairs glasses - we're not heavy into 3D, but for the rare occasion, its nice to have the feature and the glasses on-hand.CONS:1) Pre-loaded apps -- all the fitness and kiddie stuff is junk.  Its bloatware in my mind that should be an optional download.2)  WiFi often doesn't connect automatically; need to go to network settings and tell it to connect.  Odd because it would auto-connect initially and at some point stopped working that way.  If by chance a setting got changed, I can't locate it and it would seem too easy to inadvertently change to be a good feature.3) Stand - its not a major con - I just feel that the stand is not as substantially made as my prior Samsung.  Perhaps to keep the price point down or increase margins they are pulling back on the quality here.

Gilligan", "ReviewID": "R3L9E8UAT9G02C", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "Bottom Line: Save your money and get a second screen for your laptop, and it will make a better tv than this one.My sister and I bought this TV a couple of years ago because it was supposed to be Netflix ready and got good reviews. So I am surprised at how much we have come to hate it. We would have returned it, but it isn't broken. It's only the software design and implementation that is broken.  If I had it to do over again, for the price we paid for the TV, I could buy a top of the line custom gaming desktop with an extra big screen. Even an old xp laptop with a second monitor would be superior in usability.Here are the highlights of one of the worst \"customer usability experiences\" I have ever had.Customer Support: Did you know Netflix has a secret campaign to undermine Samsung?You can call Samsung customer support when things go wrong, but they blame everything on: 1. the customer, 2. Netflix. I have gotten way more support for this TV from Netflix tech support than from Samsung, even when the problem had nothing to do with Netflix.Performance:Slow, Slow, Slow: It takes about two minutes for the tv to come out of standby. There is an even longer wait if the tv was turned off, and there is no feedback, like a visible light or clicking sound, to let you know if the TV got the signal from the remote. I finally found out that there is a light on the bottom corner of the screen that flashes 5 times before the tv will come on, but you can barely see it. So it is difficult to tell if the tv is on or off. You can spend a frustrating several minutes inadvertently turning it off and on again. A better strategy is to push the button once and then walk away and do something else for a while. By the time you have made a pot of coffee or popped some popcorn, the old boot may have come to life.If you have an extremely slow Internet connection - under 5 mbps, the tv barely works at all. Switching between apps, or switching programs on Netflix takes 12-15 clicks on the remote, and sometimes the app shuts down saying there is no signal, or says the program is no longer available. The first time this happened I thought Netflix pulled the show, but when I checked on my laptop, there it was.  We finally got our Internet upgraded to 3 mbps, all that is available where we live, and the tv performance is marginally better, but you still have to click several times to get a show to start, and if you pause the playback, it sometimes refuses to start again.Who needs usability when you have Bugs & Clutter?Navigating this TV's interface is like trying to drive a car using a handful of mashed potatoes for a steering wheel. All parts of the interface require a qwerty keyboard to be usable, but I have yet to find one that is compatible.Samsung actually sells a supposedly tv ready keyboard, for 200 bucks if you can believe that, but the reviews I read about it indicated that it was not all that tv ready. I see no reason why this tv shouldn't be compatible with my 20 dollar logitech wireless keyboard and mouse combo, which works with just about every other device I own. After all, this tv came with 3 usb slots. Something should work with it.The online popup keyboard is nearly useless. It takes forever to type in your account information, and if you make one mistake, it defaults to the previous screen and deletes all your input. Of course you need a different account for EVERYTHING. There is no master password to log in to all your apps. To make this doubly frustrating, frequent automatic updates delete all your user information that you have so laboriously typed in with their useless onscreen keyboard.Updates that break things:Samsung sends frequent automatic updates, which you can't disable. The only purpose these updates seem to have is to delete your settings and your logon information for all of your apps, and sometimes the apps as well. We have had this tv for over two years and we have not seen one iota of performance or feature improvements, despite the nearly monthly updates, even though they are desperately needed to achieve minimal usability. Customizability: Not!Apps: The home screen is extremely cluttered with Samsung's commercials & their own apps of dubious utility. With their central placement and extra big icons they take up the best and the most real estate on the homescreen. These are the PermaApps bc you can't uninstall or move them.The apps people really use have tiny icons. There are a few on the very bottom of the screen with a couple more on the very  top. The majority of the apps are banished to a second screen that we found by accident. The top row apps change randomly. I suspect the top is the paid spot, bc Amazon, YouTube and HULU+ have the top spots. Pandora used to be there too, but mysteriously disappeared after an update.  I found it's icon hidden on the back screen a couple weeks later. I had to download it and install it again, and of course my login was deleted as well.Pandora, pay your rent will you? After much tongue chewing, I managed to shuffle Pandora back up to the front screen. But you still have to wade through the family and sports apps and the commercials for paid 3D apps to find it.Web browser as useless appendage:I thought it would be cool to have a TV with a web browser, but there is no way to use it, except for maybe  telepathy. There is no mouse or keyboard compatibility, even for the web browser. You have to use the remote.The remote is supposed to have some kind of surfing mode, but it doesn't really work, and of course you can't actually type anything into the Google search bar, unless you have lots and LOTS of patience. And then it is so slow. Install Firefox on a Windows 95 laptop with a dial-up connection. Install every plugin and extension you can find, and it will be 10 times faster than the Samsung tv browser.  Useless!Stuck in default mode:The TV has a broadcast mode and an Internet mode. We don't have any cable or broadcast signal where we live, so we only use Internet mode. But the default is broadcast mode. It continuously searches for a signal, and I suspect this is part of the reason for the TV's' poor performance.  It  takes a long time and sometimes many clicks of the remote to switch to Internet mode. There is no way turn off searching for signals or to set the default mode to Internet. Sheer Incompatibility:For the times it is just too frustrating to try to watch Internet TV, we bought a dvd player. We chose a Samsung device stupidly assuming  it would be compatible with the TV.It's not. They fight over who gets to be on, and whose remote gets to work. When you turn them both on, one will almost always turn the other off. When you get them to finally agree to be on at the same time, then they each display their own screen which conflicts with the other one's screen. There is no way to program the tv to recognize the dvd player or vice versa, neither can you configure one of the remotes to work with both devices. I suspec that what happened is that Samsung made the DVD player, with it's own Interface, and then they made the TV with a completely different interface, and without a thought to backward compatibility. That's a really slick marketing technique, I guess.I read somewhere recently that Samsung spends the lion's share of their R&D; money on software development. If so, they had better check to see if the people they are paying aren't really over at Google or Microsoft when they are supposed to be at Samsung, bc if this TV is the evidence, I would say they hired monkeys to write the code for them.I have given this tv one star, because after all the frustrations, and things that don't work right. When you can get something to actually play on it, it looks pretty good. I am still hopeful of finding something to put in the USB slots.", "Date": "December 21, 2013"}, {"Title": "Perfect for mid level large screen smart TV.

I can lift it up by myself but I would always suggest two people handling it.I tried running Amazon and it asked for a system update. I go to system update it says System is upto date. So I chatted with Samsung. They told me I have to manually patch the firmware. The process is fairly straight forward if you have a USB mem stick and a PC.After manual firmware upgrade it did one more online upgrade. After that Amazon prime started working without a hitch.That was the initial setup.For 1 week I had the TV connected to cable via a component cable. ( I had basic digital box -no HDMI).

I suffered this and wondered how Samsung and other manufacturers could not address this software issue since it seems to have existed since at least 2010. You will get no help from the Samsung customer service reps due to the fact they really have no technical knowledge and work off a script.If you do some Googleing you have a vast amount of knowledge bases to research. After a lot of reading and trying many of the DLNA media servers out there I tried SERVIIO. The download is free and the setup seamless on your computer. Depending upon the size of the library of photos, music and videos you want to add from your computer it can take from minutes to a few hours for the server to catalog your media.  Be sure to uninstall the ALLSHARE software from your computer to avoid conflicts.I have used it for about a week now and every movie that I watched wirelessly using Serviio; I have NOT HAD ONE DISCONNECT (one movie was three hours long).The TV is very intuitive and the apps work flawlessly and there are hundreds to choose from. Unlike some other reviews state AMAZON is included in this TV for their video streaming.The fit and finish is immaculate and mounting it on the wall a breeze (400 X 400 VESA).  If you do use the stand it is HEAVY duty and swivels.The sound (I have it connected to an AVR) is extremely decent through the tv's speakers.I have had Panasonic, Vizio, Sharp and LG HDTV's and while all are good this Samsung's picture has impressed me the most.

After having it for more than a week, here are my 2-cent comments:1) Picture quality is really nice.  The color is amazing. I own 6 HDTV: 4 of them are Samsung and the other 2 TVs are Panasonic and LG 47-inch Cinema 3D.  This one is the largest one with 3D functionality using active shutter glasses.  I purchased it because I wanted to take advantages of watching 3D programs from DirecTV that are available from its basic package.  However, I did sign up for the top Premier package so I enjoy its programs to the fullest extent.  The 3D high definition is amazing when I watched Titanic 3D Blu-ray last week.  To tell the truth, since watching 3D, I don't want to watch any TV programs in 2D.  I just can't take 2D anymore.2) Smart TV with built-in Wifi is one of the coolest features that I really like about.  I could use it as to surf the Internet, watch youtube or listen to music on any other standard or flash-based websites. Flash is good with this TV as well.  The only draw-back I've seen so far is I can't watch ESPN3 sports programs on this TV due to a need to update for flash software that appears outdated for streaming.  I've attempted to update the flash, but it looks as if I can't do it manually.  Other than that, this TV can be used as a desktop computer.  I hope Samsung will send its latest flash update so I can fully enjoy ESPN3 sports experience through this TV.  Keyboard and mouse cursor operated with its standard remote TV also give me a little hard time as it takes such a fair amount of time to type a website address into its entry box.  This issue can be definitely improved with a Samsung blue-tooth keyboard associated with this TV.  I might have to buy this keyboard in hopes of facilitating better with my internet experience in this TV.3) Sound quality is not the best, but it is not the worst.  I would give its sound quality 3 out 5 stars because bass might present a possible problem as I could hear some crackling from the TV speakers.  I have to switch it back to standard sound mode in an attempt to reduce its level of crackling noise.  I don't know if that issue is originally defective or was caused from its shipping process.All in all, I am just satisfied with this purchase.  If I had to buy it again, I would do it without a second thought.

Hubby has been wanting a larger TV for our living room and has coveted a Smart TV. We decided on this one. He wanted 55 inch; I thought that was too big. I went along with it. We bought the 55 inch model of this TV. I still think it's a bit too big for the room, but I'm getting used to it. Shipping was fast and flawless, as usual. The picture is beautiful. Is it a whole lot better than the picture on our 40 inch LCD? It's better, I'll say that, but not incredibly better (both are very good). The sound is good enough for TV speakers. The Smart Hub? Ugh. I can see that we'll never use it. (to be fair, I really didn't think we would). We have a Samsung Blu-Ray DVD player as well as a ROKU. There's not one app that we'd actually use on this Smart Hub that we can't already access via said Blu-Ray player or the ROKU. I'd never use a TV for Skype or web browsing, at least not this one. Too time consuming and clumsy when I have my very fast desktop sitting ten feet away. But, I digress....I very carefully calibrated the TV using settings found right here in the user reviews. (This is such a wonderful benefit of reading the reviews!). They tweaked the picture to a level that was just short of stunning. A few days later calamity struck. I said OK to installing the latest firmware upgrade. That firmware upgrade took away the option of choosing the type of picture you want and changed it to \"dynamic\", which is not what I want and is not able to be changed.I immediately took to the Samsung Support page on Facebook (a wonderful and responsive page, by the way) and asked for an explanation. They answered within minutes and acknowledged that the functionality to select picture mode was indeed taken away with the firmware upgrade. They said they would escalate it to their tech folks. I'm still waiting to hear something about it, but I fear I'm stuck with it as the firmware upgrades cannot be undone. Maybe the next upgrade will fix it. In the meantime, the picture is still very good, but I'm a bit ticked about the picture mode decision being made for me.The stand is ugly. Our old LCD had a beautiful, oval stand. I question who designed this four-pronged stand, but that's not a huge deal. The TV is so thin. I'm amazed by this! Hard to believe they fit all the \"stuff\" in there!So all in all, if I had it to do over again, I'd skip the SMART TV function, skip the 3D (another concession to hubby--I can't watch 3D--it gives me a headache), and get a regular non-smart LED TV, then tweak the settings to my liking and wait to install ANY firmware upgrades until they are fully vetted by others and I am sure they won't screw anything up. (The same way I won't let Chase Mobile Banking app automatically install upgrades on my android phone until a week or two has gone by and I check the reviews!) Then, by all means, hook up the Blu-Ray and the ROKU, and if you must stream something from your laptop, just hook that up to the TV via the HDMI port.

I highly recommend a picture hanging style mount, especially for this style TV. It is a very flattering way to show off this gorgeous TV.Cons:\"Smart\" TV. The Smart features sound great! Netflix and tons of other streaming options? Great! Unfortunately, it isn't wireless. So you have to front some cash for a wireless adapter (bleh!) or bridge (highly recommended substitution instead of a wireless adapter. More versatile and longer lasting. Highly recommend Apple's Airport Express for this usage). The Smart features are very sluggish and slow. Like most Samsung Smart devices (BluRay players, TVs and the like), it is unreasonably bloated and slow. It took us roughly 5 minutes from launching Netflix to actually watching a movie near the middle of our queue.LIGHT BLEED. This is the biggest nail in this TV's coffin. I noticed a tiny bit of light bleed at the time of purchase and installation, but it got drastically worse over time. Now it's unbearable. Thankfully, Best Buy is being good about this and is either repairing this TV in our home (replacing the panel) or giving us credit back to buy a new TV from another brand. Reading around and asking various Geek Squad employees, this is apparently a rampant problem with LED TVs made by Samsung.All in all, this TV is below average. The aesthetics are great, I can't stop harping on how thin the entire TV is, along with the bezel. However, the bloated \"Smart\" crapware Samsung bundles with their devices along with the horrific light bleed problem forces me to give this TV a pass.

If you buy this TV, and you want to listen to the audio through your ear bud external speakers that connect to the Audio Out Port with an audio cable so that the sound will not disturb or distract other people in the same vicinity as you, you will not be able to listen to the audio in private through ear bud speakers like you can in other brands of TV's such as Sony and Panasonic because the technology for private listening does not exist on Samsung UN32ES6500F LED HDTV. In the other brands of televisions, the user can connect ear bud external speakers with an audio cable to the Audio Out Port on the backside of the TV and can adjust the audio volume output between low volume and high volume with the use of the volume control on the TV's remote control. However, on the Samsung UN32ES6500F LED HDTV, the volume output through the Audio Out Port is permanently set at a very low default Level 2, which renders the volume so low that the user can barely hear the audio. The user cannot increase the volume level coming out of the ear bud speakers because Samsung has permanently set the volume at a very low volume. When one attempts to increase the volume output by using the volume control on the Samsung Remote Control, the user cannot adjust the volume. The volume is permanently fixed at a very low adjustable Level 2. The user will not be able to adjust or increase the volume level on ear bud speakers.ORIGINAL REVIEW, MARCH 16, 2013:I am ticked off at Samsung. I want everyone to know why.During the Christmas Holiday sales season, I ordered a new Samsung UN32ES6500 LED HDTV from Amazon.com on Nov 26, 2012 for a purchase price of $597.99 plus $3.99 for one-day shipping plus $51.17 California Sales Tax plus $8.00 California Electronic Waste Recycling Fee for a total cost of $661.15. Amazon.com shipped it on Nov 27. ONTRAC delivered it to my residence on Nov 28. The TV had a physical defect on the edge of the translucent polycarbonate or plastic frame that surrounds the display screen. An air bubble or pocket was evident inside the frame structure and looked as though it eventually might result in a progressive fracture of the frame over a period. On Nov 30, I telephoned Amazon.com Customer Support, reported the defect, and the Amazon.com telephone representative agreed to ship another new and identical Samsung TV at no charge to me. Furthermore, the Amazon.com representative agreed to have UPS pick up the defective TV at my residence and return it to Amazon.com at no charge to me. On Dec 4, UPS delivered the new replacement TV to my residence. After removing it from the Samsung shipping package and inspecting it, the replacement TV appeared to have no damage. I packed the defective TV in the original Samsung shipping package. A few days later, UPS came to my residence and picked up the defective TV for return to Amazon.com. As usual, Amazon.com Customer Service and Return Policy is SUPERIOR AND EXCELLENT. I tip my hat to Jeff Bezos and the entire Amazon.com organization - FIRST CLASS CUSTOMER SERVICE, THE BEST OF THE BEST.Pros and Cons, BUYER BEWARE - Samsung UN32ES6500 LED HDTV. In my opinion, Samsung practice is IRRESPONSIBLE AND DECEPTIVE:PROS:(1) Good picture quality.(2) Good color quality.(3) Very good detail in High-Definition programming.(4) Good sound quality and volume control in Samsung internal speakers after downloading and installing Samsung Software Update Version T-MST10PAUSC-1029.2, BT-G (via wireless connection between Samsung TV and my home network's Internet router).(5) Slim space-saving design.(6) Very good-to-excellent Samsung customer telephone support.CONS:(1) BUYER BEWARE - The TV set has no built-in amplifier for external speakers. When I connected my Panasonic RP-HJE350-K SLIMZ In-Ear Earbud Headphones to the Audio-Out Port on the backside of the Samsung TV and opened the Samsung Menu with the Samsung Remote to disable the TV's internal speakers and enable the External Speakers (my earbuds), I discovered that I could not adjust the volume of the earbuds. I barely could hear the audio because Samsung has pre-set the External Speaker Volume Level around a very low Level 2 default setting that makes the earbuds practically useless with the TV because my earbuds do not have a built-in audio amplifier, and the Samsung TV does not have a built-in External Speaker amplifier. I called Samsung Customer Support, and the telephone representative said that I would have to use external speakers that have their own built-in volume amplifier if I wanted to increase the Samsung External Speaker volume above the very low Level 2 default setting. I was very disappointed to discover this issue only after I had purchased the TV. Before I had decided to purchase the TV, I studied the Samsung User Manual at Samsung.com. Samsung fails to disclose clearly in the User Manual that the TV has no built-in External Speaker amplifier, and if the user wants to adjust the External Speaker volume above the very low Level 2 default level, the user must use external speakers or earbuds that have their own built-in audio amplifier. The failure by Samsung to make this disclosure in the User Manual in my opinion is IRRESPONSIBLE AND DECEPTIVE.(2) BAD BLACK COLOR - In the TV display, the color black does not look realistic. Depending on the video program, the color black at times varies from shades of a lighter gray to a darker gray. This TV does a very poor to mediocre job of rendering black in video images.(3) BUYER BEWARE - To put it in simple terms, in my opinion the built-in programs that I have used in the Samsung Smart Hub SUCK! I have used the Samsung Web Browser application to connect the TV to the Internet. I have used the Samsung Netflix application to connect the TV to my Netflix account. In my opinion, both of those Samsung applications perform less than very poorly. Furthermore, any websites that require Adobe Flash Player to integrate with a website for optimum performance of video and audio content will not function properly because Samsung has failed to include a Flash Player application in the TV's software programming. What a big JIP! Samsung claims that this TV is an Internet device with a Smart Hub that provides Internet connectivity between the TV and your third-party Internet Service Provider account. The TV does connect to the Internet, but the built-in Samsung Web Browser application, the built-in Samsung Netflix application, and the TV's incompatibility with websites that render best with a Flash Player are in my opinion a BIG SHORTCHANGE on the customer, like the horse trader that bought a ready-to race thoroughbred from a supposedly reputable horse breeder only to discover after he brought the racehorse to his stables that the racehorse had only 3 legs. It seems to me that the so-called Smart Hub is really a Dumb Hub. Today, if I decided to buy a new TV with Internet connectivity, I definitely would shop around and research what is available to find a better Internet TV before I would buy another Samsung UN32ES6500 LED HDTV.", "Date": "March 16, 2013"}, {"Title": "Compra TV", "Author": "Gustavo V\u00e1squez", "ReviewID": "R1S61MZWCN6QMF", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Muy bueno, llego en perfectas condiciones, lo traje hasta Colombia por un courier y llego perfecto.

I am on my third main board, samsung refuses to replace set, and gives me the run around. I have lost time out of work, samsung puts you on hold and acts like they have no idea there is even a problem.  Last tech wrote up the set was still not fixed, and samsung refuses to replace set.  Some one did call back once, left a number, refuses to return any of my numerous calls.  Samsung is terrible, the worst, do not buy anything from them, ever.It appears Samsung TVs have no quality control (other than the consumer being stuck with a defective product, so if you got a good one, you are very lucky, but I suspect you will have problems at some point). Right out of the factory sealed box, my brand new new PN64E8000 top of the line 64\" Samsung Plasma is defective. (My TV is similar to the UN65ES6500 in regards to the problem, which you will see if you read on).  It is extremely difficult to get an HDMI connection. I tried 3 different cables, different cable manuafacturors, lastest ARC and 3D cables, and all 3 HDMI receptor slots. This in itself took hours of my time. The 3 HDMI receptor slots are in a multi input bar, which moves when you press on it. Yes, it actually moves. This is the design flaw.  I went to a store that happened to be setting up a UN65ES6500, a near top of the line LED, It has a similar HDMI connector plate which also moves. I recomend you go push on one for yourself before you buy. You can actually move it with one finger. Any Engineer knows that moving connections is a poor design. The specs are bad and need to be changed before the problem will go away.  If everything is just right, it may work for a few hook-ups and un-hook-ups, but it is likely to fail, probably after your one year warranty is up. Samsung customer service sent me an email confirming they received my request for support, then they closed my ticket without fixing TV. They will not re-open a ticket, I am on my third ticket now. I evenually reached the Executive Customer Relations Department, who claimed fixing the TV was not their responsability (quoting some fine print in their home warranty policy like they new it by heart). Basically what you have is a large 64\" TV, which they will not touch or move in any way, you have to provide the labor to get the TV flat on a table so they can work on it. This may be acceptable to strong young people, but if you are older, you may have to pay $500 or more to have TV put up and down. So you either need to shell out cash, or call in favors, so Sumsung can stick you with the hardest part of the repair.  Oh, and good luck finding a place to store this thing while it is down and you are waiting and waiting for Samsung to send a tech.  If you live in a big city it may be quicker, but where I am, the closest shop is 3 hours away in each direction, and I live 30 minutes from a good sized city.  The TV is huge and very very very very delicate. I actually heard the unit crack while the TV delivery guys did their intial unpacking, and I watched them the whole time, I do not know how they could do anything different.  So basically every time you (yes you) have to move it (so Samsung does not have to take responsability for their delicate product) you take a good chance of breaking it.  The hardest part is lowering it down to a flat position.  It has no lateral rigidity, and you can hear and possibly feel the set strain no matter how gentle you are.  The movers I had handle TVs all the time and were very carefull. Well, Samsung eventually refered me to the Office Of the Present@Sea.Samsung.Com, who will not accept phone calls. Without HDMI this set has limited value. The internet features take forever to navigate. The duel processor system is slow, slow, slow, SLOW!  This is regardless of your internet connection speed, the TV is just to slow to deal with all the non-vaule software you have to get through.  Two worthlessly slow processors are NOT better than one good one. Perhaps they know the processors are crap, and that is why the offer the evolution upgrade pack that they plan to sell for large amounts of money, so you get to pay over and over. Once you get through the slow and hard to use process of locating something you might want ot see, it ends up either being a pay for service app or a short vidoe with several commercials (except U-Tube, U-Tube is pretty great, at least for now). So, I suspect Samsung deliberly has this approach of no quality control and then refusing to support the TV because they make money that way. All we can do is boycott all Samsung products and hope they go out of business, I suspect that they will never change a system that works for them. It may also be a good idea not to vote for these right wing Republican leaders have do not feel that consumer protection is the role of Gorernment. Oh, the voice control and motion control is crap, but the CNET reviewers also noted that, only they were very polight about it. Nice job with that CNET.Basically Samsung does not appear to inspect the tVs before they ship them out, at least not in a method that works. They rely on the comsumer to find the problems, then force the consumer to pay the most expensive part of the repair, which is hiring \"insured\" people to move the TV. Yes, I do recall that was one of their excuses, the insurance of moving the TVs was cost prohibative, that's probably because they make their TVs so delicate they break very easily, assuming it isn't already broken when you get it.", "Date": "November 21, 2012"}, {"Title": "Samsung Sucks", "Author": "Robert & Cora", "ReviewID": "R2F2RJC81RIZH", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I contacted tech support and it took almost 1 hour to talk with an \"expert\".

Would purchase another one if they still sold them. Unfortunately, Samsung has downgraded their 40\" line of TVs as another reviewer has mentioned.  This thing only has 3 HDMI inputs and no VGA port for hooking up a computer.  For $1,100 bucks it SHOULD have 4 HDMI inputs and a VGA port as their previous line did. Someone might say, why didn't you look at the specs first?  Well, I looked at the CMR ratings and all of the other specs.  I would have never imagined they would put out a 40\" TV in 2012 with only 3 HDMI inputs and no VGA port so I didn't bother checking that. I could understand if this was a 23\" TV, but it's not. This is supposed to be a PREMIUM LED TV!Picture quality is good, but not as good as the UN40C7000.  The screen is neither glossy or matte finish.  They are using a new semi-gloss screen to help reduce glare which will still allow it to produce good color depth.  The remote is also a downgrade. Feels like a cheap replacement universal remote you would pick up at a local store. The light function on it is also very dim.  All in all, this TV is about a 2.5.
