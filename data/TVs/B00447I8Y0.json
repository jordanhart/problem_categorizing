Too good to pass up since I was going to spend close to that on a regular LED/LCD TV anyway.  There were a few sales on Samsungs and Panasonics, but I chose Toshiba.  The TV being replaced was a 3.5 year old 50\" HD Toshiba DLP.  That was a great product, so I decided to exercise a little brand loyalty.  Additionally, because Toshiba was one of the last \"big\" manufacturers to release their 3D TV, I figured they would probably have the best picture since they had more time to perfect their technology.  That may be incorrect logic, but it worked for me.  There were almost no reviews when I bought the TV, so I kept my fingers crossed.SHIPPING:  I waited like a little kid for this thing to get to me - even though I got it in 5 days, it seemed like forever!  The box had a huge hole in it (looked like it had been kicked) and the back of the TV had a small dent.  I signed for it with the acknowledgement that it was dented so if it didn't work, I could send it back.  These things are shipped via freight, and freight is known to be rough on packages.  The dent didn't bother me (provided it worked), so I took it home.SETUP:  Got home, took it out of the box.  This thing is skinny!  It is also surprisingly heavy (not overly cumbersome, but it is heavier than it looks).  The base attaches like it should - pretty self explanatory.  Got it hooked up and turned on.  The TV walked me through the setup as it should.  The picture was great - I don't have cable (I know, I know), but the OTA stations looked wonderful.  It was a very clean look.  The response time changing channels was very quick (it was somewhat slower on the DLP TV).  The options Toshiba has to change the picture are limitless - I am still tinkering with the picture (although the way it is set up out of the box is great).3D SETUP:  I bought A Christmas Carol, Open Season, and Monsters Vs. Aliens (off eBay) in 3D.  Setup is identical to a regular DVD player, except I believe you need to have a 1.4 HDMI cable (not a standard HDMI) to transmit the 3D image.  I wish they mentioned this up front, but luckily I did some research before the TV arrived and ordered an Amazon cable for $7.  Not a big deal, but I would have been pretty irritated if I would have had to make a trip to BestBuy to buy a $50 cable.  For the glasses, you just pull the clear battery saver tab (you'll see it if you don't know what I'm talking about) and you're good to go.  You can tell when the glasses are on because the light allowed through the glasses changes.  I believe I had to change the TV to auto-detect 3D, but a message pops up and tells you what to do once it sees a 3D disc, so that's all there is to it.STANDARD/BLURAY PICTURE:  Fantastic.  There's not much more to it.  It is a great picture with incredible detail.  I thought the old HD DLP Toshiba had a great picture, but I don't know if I'll be able to watch it again because of the improvement this TV is over that one.  Bluray really did blow me away on this TV.  There are countless adjustments you can make to the picture, which is nice (doubt I'll use them, but it's more of a comfort thing).3D PICTURE:  Didn't know what to expect.  After I ordered the 46\", I began reading that you needed a bigger screen to appreciate 3D and got worried.  Luckily, this wasn't true!  The picture is much more \"crisp\" than in the theaters.  When I first put on \"A Christmas Carol,\" all I could do was smile.  I had read a lot of blurbs here and there regarding the issues people were having with 3D TVs making \"ghost\" and \"double\" images.  It actually did happen during one scene of \"A Christmas Carol,\" but I'm not really sure why (it was actually just a character's nose had a ghost image during one scene), and it didn't happen at any other part or with the other movies.  I did figure out that the 3D picture is BEST when the TV is on the brightest setting.  I'm sure someone can explain why, but I can't.  This was especially true during \"A Christmas Carol,\" which is a fairly \"shadowy\" movie to begin with.SUMMARY:  Spend the money on the 3D Toshiba if you're in the market for a new TV.  The current Amazon deal includes everything you need for 3D (except for the 1.4 HDMI cable), and the picture is amazing.  I think it will be a long time before the a 3D TV drops much lower than this (at least a good quality one).  There is not much in the way of media in 3D at the moment, but there will be.  I am glad I made this investment, and would do it again.", "Date": "December 15, 2010"}, {"Title": "Amazing 3D HDTV Set", "Author": "tgoldtechie \"tgoldtechie\"", "ReviewID": "R3U553VRMTMLLX", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "i researched these types of sets for months for the family.  surprisingly there were hardly any reviews on the 55wx800u - none on cnet or other major review sites.  since my family loves toshiba products (3 generations of toshiba buying family members) we decided to take the plunge on this tv.  reasonably priced with a whole host of settings to customize your tv's picture, if you like to tweak.  if not, you can choose from some nice presets.  overall, the color is vibrant, the set is very attractive - elegant, professional but not overly done like some other sets.  prior to this tv, we had the panasonic s2 42\" plasma tv (which replaced a 53\" toshiba projection television)in the family room,as i wanted to try a plasma set and toshiba doesn't make plasmas.  happy with the panay, we were torn to either get the panasonic 54vt 3dtv or this set.  pricing was similar - but internet was not built into the panay. the plasma consumes much more power than this set.  also, the 3d glasses that come with the toshiba are much more comfortable than the ones that came with the panay.  so without reviews and based solely on my family's experience with toshiba, we bought this tv.  we are extremely happy and i believe all the talk about blooming, clouding, flashlighting that comes with an edge lit set like this one is either overdone or toshiba has done an excellent job overcoming these issues.  some quick things to note, connection to the wireless internet went smoothly and the widgets are very cool.  there is a system update that takes about 5 mins - so make sure you update your system.  also, when attaching the standing to the tv, it states slide and lock...it's a bit confusing and customer service wasn't very helpful -just slide flat so that the two tabs on the stand slide into the two openings on the back of the tv - so you don't have to press down to lock in something the toshiba customer service (who apparently never put one of these things together) suggested.  anyway, i wanted to put a real review up here since this is so lacking.  if you have questions, ask.  also, i will update in a couple months as to reliability.  oh, lastly, don't buy from JR.com - their policy states that they have to open the package and add some \"protective materials\"- well - that set arrived broken.  i refused the package and reordered through amazon.com and they sent the package \"factory sealed\" and it was fine.", "Date": "November 24, 2010"}, {"Title": "Toshiba does it again!", "Author": "Richard D.

After hanging it on the wall and hooking up to my TiVo (cable), DirecTV (satellite), The 3D Blu-ray player, my PC, my bluetooth audio to my hearing aids, and my network bridge, I began the setup. Everything went so well that I thought I had missed something. The TV recognized the network instantly, the 3D channels on DirecTV were in beautiful 3D, the Blu-ray 3D movie \"Clash of the Titans\" played as advertised, the PC hookup (HDMI)automatically fixed the overscan problem I'd had with the old TV, and as a bonus, the TV downloaded a software update when I turned it on the next morning.", "Date": "December 13, 2010"}, {"Title": "Gorgeous display, gorgeous picture, clouding ruins some movies", "Author": "T-Man", "ReviewID": "R1IC9GP49WODU8", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "It's been awhile since I've used a Toshiba product.  My last was an HD-DVD player, which I wasn't overly fond of due to slow load times and a clunky menu interface.I know that they make quality products, but don't have quite the glamor of Sony, Panasonic or Samsung.The TV set itself is gorgeous.  The thin bezel and glossy, mirror finish makes for a very modern upscale look, along with its slim form factor.  It looks stunning even when off.The picture it produces is equally eye popping.  The blacks are dark without being crushing.  The backlighting is even throughout with no signs of bleeding, flashlighting, banding- all of which I've experienced in older CFL-lit LCD's (but keep in mind that these issues are specific to each unit, not the model line so YMMV).I found the 240 Hz ClearFrame does generate the so-called \"soap opera\" effect (though less pronounced than on Samsung's I've watched) which I despise and was happy to find that it can be disabled.The menus are easy to navigate and intuitive.  The remote is backlit, and buttons are well spaced, but it does increase the size of the remote a bit.The icing on the cake was the great price and service from Amazon!I do not have any 3D Blu-ray movies at the moment so I cannot comment on that feature as of yet.**Update**After a few more days of usage, I found a negative.  Changing channels (over the air antenna) is slower than I would like, even using just the Ch up/down commands.  Direct channel inputs (4-1, 2-1, etc.) take a very long time, and there is no 'Enter' button to speed things up.Another negative I can give is for the weak Wi-Fi reception.  It lists signal strength as low and had trouble latching onto my wireless network several times, even though my PS3 in the same spot under it was reporting 100% signal strength.  My 802.11n router is about 20 feet away, with only 1 wall in between.The widgets themselves are just OK. There's weather, news, channel guides, facebook, etc.  There are many more you can download and customize but they are a little clunky and slow (perhaps due to weak WiFi strength), and not great to browse with a TV remote.It's not really a feature I would use on a regular basis, especially when these features are much more efficiently used on a PC, but I guess they're there for convenience sake and it works as advertised.These aren't enough for me to knock a star off because I bought this TV to use as a TV, and that it definitely excels at.**Update 2**After more viewing on mine, I am seeing very slight flashlighting in the corners (on movies that don't fill the screen, hence black bars top and bottom).  It is very faint and not bothersome.  However, an issue that I would consider major did surface, and that is clouding during dark scenes on some movies.In one movie, it was to the point where I was debating whether I should send it back or not.  I tried a PS3 game afterwards and the clouding was no longer present.I tried another movie, and again, it was perfect; vivid colors and no clouding.  Unfortunately, I no longer had my original movie that exhibited the clouding so I could not try that one again.This intermittent clouding issue has me worried and I will keep a watchful eye on it.**Update 3**Finally got the chance to view some 3D content (Despicable Me, GT5 on PS3).There is crosstalk when watching movies.  It looks like double vision and nullifies the sharpness you'd expect from Blu-ray.There is no pop to the 3D.  I don't know if it's the movie/game itself.Cloudiness is still intermittently present, but not enough for me to return the set.I'm knocking it down a star due to the poor 3D and clouding.

When I first got the Hitachi I did not think a picture could ever get better. Was in the market for an upgrade and spent a day looking at all the 50\"+ LED TVs. Where the TV is set in the store makes all the difference in the picture quality and they have the mode set to brightest, sharpest, etc..., which you would not have in your home. Spent the evening researching LED TV technology and came to the conclusion that they all will be similar in the similar price range. Toshiba had the deal for 2 pair of 3D glasses and BD 3D player with purchase of TV which knocked out the Sony and the Samsung I was considering. 3D glases are specific for each model and will run you about $150 and 3D BD will run you about $250...so that was a $550 saving right there.Hook up was a piece of cake to Sat box and then watched PBS Evening news. If the program is not in HD, the the large picture makes the video TOO big and somewhat blurry, so you have to scale the picture back (easy to do with button control on the remote). Started up a recorded HD movie on my DVR, Star Trek First Contact...and wow, the detail, colors the black level were amazing and as good as any of the Sony and samsung similar TVs I saw in the show room. The Toshiba was a new model and relegated to the show room wall with about 30 other TVs and did not show as well. I can now tell you that it is GREAT.Do not expect great sound from any LED TV since the speakers have to be small. But the sound is adequate for watching news and normal shows, but somewhat tinny. Probably can adjust with the menu equalizer, but its a don't care for normal TV viewing. Put in USB stick with pictures and it recognized it immediately and opened up to view photos...fantastic resoultion and photo reproduction with 8Mp camera...and fast.", "Date": "October 12, 2010"}, {"Title": "You will LOVE this Television!", "Author": "Kristoffer Karlson \"Kris K\"", "ReviewID": "R24SP2DVL6J02L", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I normally do not write reviews on products unless I feel utterly compelled to do so. I have to say, this tv deserves a review. First, I was replacing a tv that I was VERY fond of. I had a 50\" Visio Plasma 1080p that I bought a couple of years ago and LOVED it every since. I plan on keeping it for many years to come. With that being said, it would have taken quite a bit to improve the quality and value that I found in that particular tv. I found it!The price is ridiculous. $1,600 with no tax, free shipping, and two pairs of 3d glasses? EXCELLENT! Toshiba makes great products and this 55\" beauty is no exception. For the price, I think you will be hard pressed to find a better picture in a 55\" size and sporting the latest 240hz LED technology. The television itself is attractive, light weight, and super thin. It weights about half my previous television which is really nice. The inputs are nicely laid out in the back and very easily accessible. My Vizio had them under a lip and in the lower middle of the set making them very difficult to find without pulling the whole TV out which was always a chore. The picture is HIGHLY customizable. **NOTE** the instruction manual outlines in nice detail the explaination of features, DO NOT WATCH BLU-RAY MOVIES WITH THE 240 CLEAR MOTION FEATURE ON!! It will make the movie appear jumpy and jittery. Watching it with the standard 60 frames per second gives that nice \"normal and human\" smoothness you are used to. The 240 Clear Motion feature is SO nice with sports, especially if you are a hockey fan like myself. Any fast paced sports program will really reap the benefits of this feature. NASCAR, Basketball, Hockey, Football all look fabulous with this feature on. The LED has the bad reputation for having even lighting issues, or bright spots in the corners. Toshiba utilizes a technology that pans the light and it looks even and the contrast ratio is really nice to boot. Blacks are black and whites are white. Great color balance and options to adjust the power of the LED backlight.My previous television also doubled as a heater. It would get the room VERY warm in the Summer which was one of the downsides (in addition to the screen burn-in that Plasma is prone to) but this tv is quite, cool, and takes very little power in comparison. Energy Star rated for those concerned with power consumption (as you should ;-)The apps? Well, I haven't toyed around with them too much. Setting up the Wi-Fi was fast and simple, but I fear that the apps can act a bit \"clunky\" at times **(This is no longer an issue because I discoved that the wi-fi was VERY weak in the room where I have this tv, so I can't honestly say if the apps are slow or not.) It doesn't flow very quickly. What I mean is there is a bit of lag between the commands on the remote and the changing on screen. Is this enough to ruin the experience? Absolutely not, but something some should be prepared for if they plan on using the app features more than I do. All in all, this television in my humble opinion is well worth the money. Even my wife (who can't tell the difference between VHS and Blu-ray) commented on how beautiful and noticable the picture quality was. Very pleased with this purchase, and I think you will be too. I hope this honest, non-biased review is helpful in your decision to buy or not.**UPDATE**I have had this television since December and I am still just as pleased with it (if not more once I got the optimal settings down) as I was the day it first arrived. Blu-rays are absolutely stunning and if you are looking for a showcase 3D movie (aside from Polar Express and The Christmas Carol,) Step Up 3D is a thrilling experience! The 3D is unsurpassed in my opinion and this tv really sets it off. The clouding pictures are you see in the photos are a bit exagerrated. Is the clouding noticable? Only between frames before a movie starts (i.e. in between previews, warning messages etc.,) but once the picture actually comes up the clouding is not noticeable and the color is vibrant and crystal clear. I think that the people that took those pictures may have had their backlight settings on max. Look, to sum it all up, if you are on a budget and are looking for an upgrade over your existing tv or you just want to experience 3D, you can't go wrong. The price is unbeatable at this point (considering the size and quality) and the fact that you now get glasses and a blu-ray player free you can't miss. I truly don't think that you will be disappointed.**UPDATE 2**I have now had the TV for about a year and I still feel strongly that for the money, it is a tremendous value. The price has gone up dramatically since I bought it (because I believe that it is no longer being sold by Amazon,) however, if the price does come back down I would still highly recommend a good look. I haven't seen too many better deals anywhere else for what you get for the money. While I don't use the 3D feature nearly as much as I thought I would, I can say that I am very excited to see the Lion King and Beauty and the Beast (and other Disney classics soon to come) in 3D.", "Date": "December 18, 2010"}, {"Title": "Tim finally finds a KEEPER IN THE 55 WX800 HDTV", "Author": "Mary T. Halterman", "ReviewID": "RAAKLAZLBT9E0", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I have been looking for a new HDTV for more than two years. I have tried VIZIO,LG,SANSUNG and have returned them all until this Toshiba HDTV. The Vizio had blurring on the 551 series which was because the 240hz didn't do anything and eventhought the picture had great blacks it wasn't life like. The LG was a 2008 model and wasn't anything fantastic and the 120hz didn't do anything either. Then just a few weeks ago I tried the Samsung 6400 series LED and the 120hz didn't do anything plus the flashlighting in each of the lower corners of the screen were very distracting. The Internet wouldn't work on the apps and when there were very dark scenes the contrast was very poor so I had trouble seeing peoples clothing.  Now to the Toshiba 55 WX800 3DTV. The blacks are really dark the contrast in dark scenes is excellent and there is NO FLASHLIGHTING IN THE CORNERS OF THE SCREEN. If you have a WX800 with flashlighting in the corners then it has been dropped somewhere in shipping. CEVA shipped our TV and they didn't have two persons handling the TV which it says it needs on the box! Luckily my TV doesn't have any issues so it must have not been dropped. Send your back if it has flashlighting in the corners of the screen, it shouldn't! Maybe Amazon should have someone else ship these TVs. I have heard some of these TV are shipped by Plot. I have been using this TV since Thursday 12-23 and have had it on at least 12 hours a day to fully check it out. Today I tried the 3D feature and it worked perfectly. It doesn't have any crosstalk or ghosting when in the 3D. I have a new Sony 3D blueray model X57, so I don't know if this helps? The only thing I noticed is the nose piece of the 3D glasses is too hard and makes your nose uncomfortable, so put some felt on the nose piece maybe? I have not changed any of the factory setting because the picture looks so great just by choosing the home setting at the beginning of the setup menu.

We viewed blue ray movies with motion/scenery etc..., played PS3 games and watched HDTV and non-HDTV channels.  We have 5 in our family (3 in college plus mom and dad), it was a 100% decision to return the tv.There was at times some digital disruption during the playing of Iron Man II, the move in 2D but with blue ray in HD, gave a feeling of a cheap movie set, as if everything was filmed in front of a blue screen that later on was inlaid into the movie.  The white backgrounds were the worse by far.  The colors are bright and can be adjusted, but the 2D viewing was not over-comable by us.  We worked with the settings, followed the manual and search the website for best settings to affect the issue, in the end, the quality just wasn't in the same league as the plasma.The menus were friendly, easy to work with.  The gaming was closest to the quality of our plasma of any testing we did, there was never a lag or issue when playing games, GT 5.0 and Demon Souls on PS3.If you are a 3D person and plan to use this heavily for 3D, then I would recommend it as a strong contender, but in our house, 3D was going to the be exception, not the rule, so the 2D quaility was super important to us.I imagine when we do go 3D next time, it will be with a plasma.  We checked LEDs in the stores and they seem to be comparable with the plasma, but in our house they were not.  The plasma won in both daylight and evening watching.The clarity of the picture on the Toshiba is very strong, but the overall feel of the motion/background interaction in 2D left much to be desired in our opinion.I have read other reviews on Amazon for the tv, and I will not argue their experience, it seems to be a very high end tv, but to us the 2D was the decision maker.", "Date": "December 16, 2010"}, {"Title": "Noy only best value--competes well for best picture", "Author": "tjm", "ReviewID": "R31FAH17TBU3Q1", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "We also shopped for a long time for a new, larger TV for a multi-purpose theater/living room. I find too many reviewers of many products focusing on things like delivery services or the quality of the seller--while important, these have NOTHING to do with the product. The Toshiba WX800 is outstanding! It will take you time to find and set ideal adjustments to maximize picture quality (2D or 3D), which could suggest that a professional calibration is worthwhile. The few user reviewers I've read that question picture quality probably did not make appropriate adjustments.If you've done your homework on the types of TV options, you know that edge lit LED/LCD offer slim size benefits, but have some 'flashlight effect' (unlike 100% back-lit ones) as well as lesser sound quality (due to less space to put bigger speakers). Since we have attached speakers, sound was not an issue. The flash lighting does exist in every edge-lit I've seen. But we find the Toshiba WX800 experiences minimal detrimental effect (really only noticeable during blank screens--and not during TV/movie content, so watching experience is not impacted). Clearly the technology supporting this TV makes it a premier caliber. But marketing has suffered compared to the greater promoted 3Ds of Samsung, Sony and Panasonic. I wonder if the late-2010 introduction to the US market is the basis for the low price strategy. Do NOT be fooled by the price of the WX800. This is no low quality Phillips or Westinghouse or private label. This is truly a great TV. It is also an ideal alternative to Plasma (and only few of plasmas out there really can offer better picture quality). Side to side comparisons to LG, Panansonic and Sony (the last two with price tags greater than $3000) suggest this is has a better overall picture quality in all types of scenes (light, dark, high speed motion).", "Date": "December 26, 2010"}, {"Title": "A gamer's review", "Author": "SaM4842", "ReviewID": "RJTDJCO3ZZD48", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "The picture clarity on this tv is amazing, the 240hz really makes a difference! I am using a PS3 as this tv does not have 2D to 3D converting.I have played four 3D demo games and 3 of the 4 had a significant ghosting, even after trying to switch the 3D modes (top-bottom, side-side). You still get the 3D effect; but if I had to choose between playing in crisp 2D and double visioned semi 3D, I would choose to play in 2D. The 4th demo called Super Stardust HD had no ghosting whatsoever and in one word the graphics in this game was simply breathtaking! I suspect this is because this games does not have a wide array of depths like the other demos (2 racing, the other is a block game).Also, there is a slight input lag while in 3D game mode. This lag is no where near as severe as when you are not in game mode (ie auto, movie, sports) but it is noticeable. This can be particularly detrimental when you are playing fighting/action games when perfect timing is crucial. As of right now (December 2010), Prince of Persia is the only 3D action game I know of(I have not played this game in 2D or 3D). The easiest way to see this lag is with the Move controller. When you are moving the controller from left to right (not particularly fast), the screen will show the controller to the right when the physical controller is already to the left.One thing about the Move controller is that you will always see a brightly colored floating orb reflection on this tv. Learn to ignore it. There is nothing that can be done about the beautiful gloss finish.A small note about this tv being an edge lit LED tv: when the screen turns all black, the upper middle portion of the tv is not as dark as the rest of the tv. This is not a problem during actual game play.All in all, this tv is huge, slim, has almost blur free images (still cannot compare to a plasma, obviously) and has great invisible speakers.

I browsed God-only-knows how many TVs and customer reviews with conflicting reports on quality and reliance. I ended up buying this one because it was the right size and type for the right price.My use for the TV is simple, I want to play my PS3, watch Blu-Ray/DVDs, and Sports/TV. On all those areas, the TV works well at. You will (like any new TV I imagine) have to mess around with certain picture settings to get the right lighting etc. but so what?3D? Don't know or care. I've seen the best 3D TVs (and by that I do mean 'most expensive') in action and wasn't impressed by those so I could care less about the technology.

I browse the net with my computer so anyone complaining about that feature is like complaining your phone takes crappy pictures compared to your camera.And there's a load of other features of which I haven't used and don't really intend to. If those are really that important to you, I guess you'll have to cough up extra dough for a \"better\" model.It does have a reflective screen namely during dark scenes in a movie, but in my experience so do all TVs to an extent. I suppose this ranks somewhere in the middle in that regard. Just buy a rotating wall mount and/or close the curtains if you're watching a movie with lots of dark scenes.The only thing that makes me uneasy about the purchase is that on occasion I get a weird green light flash when watching a regular dvd. I'm guessing (could be dead wrong) the TV is just auto-adjusting the lighting or color contrast. It goes away when I mess with the picture settings and it doesn't happen at all during regular TV, blu-rays, or PS3 gaming. I've had it about a month now and no deal-breaker problems.

I like the Toshiba picture better than those systems because colors seem to be more \"natural\" especially flesh tones.  This is something I believe Toshiba has done better than any of its competitors.  I was also extremely impressed by the sound from this system.  It is excellent considering this is a slim line TV and maybe the best I've heard out of any TV ever.  Clearly the TV sound is no replacement for a surround sound system, but TV watching and movies with unremarkable sound track would play quite well.  As a test, I watched and listen to the DVD version of Phantom, which has a GREAT soundtack. I have the least expanse OPPO BDP-80, while the picture was spectacular, the sound was extremely good.  If this system was priced around the Sony and Samsung new 3d tv's I would still select the Toshiba.  Considering that this TV is hundreds and upwards of $1000 less makes this an incredible easy decision.  It's as simple as point and click!", "Date": "December 18, 2010"}, {"Title": "Need to adjust settings for best picture = great tv", "Author": "imp", "ReviewID": "R2XCT6L2YRLV1P", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I originally bought this television and was annoyed by the clouding and flashlighting in the corners and middle of the screen. After playing with the settings for a while I was able to pretty much eliminate this. I put the PICTURE MODE : STANDARD and then went to ADVANCED PICTURE SETTINGS. In this menu I put COLOR TEMP on 9, under SMART SENSOR SETTINGS I put AUTO BRIGHTNESS ON (this setting helps the most), DYNALIGHT ON(adjusts backlight for dark scenes), DYNAMIC CONTRAST 10, NOISE REDUCTION MIDDLE MIDDLE, RESOLUTION+ OFF, CLEARFRAME ON and FILM STAB MIDDLE. After these settings are finished go back to the PICTURE SETTINGS and set the BACKLIGHT to your liking. I prefer BACKLIGHT 30 and then CONTRAST 90 and everything else 0. This took care of the clouding and made the picture look amazing and way better than any other setting I tried before (I tried alot). Try it out and let me know what you think. Other than this I rate this TV a 5 because of its price and picture quality. The picture is bright and colorful and with these setting the blacks are deep. PS3 looks great on this tv and performs well on GAME MODE. I'm sure the are televisions that are better but you cant beat this size for 1499 with 3d. I watched a 3d trailer for Avatar on the extra features on my regular bluray Avatar disc and it looked amazing. There was no ghosting and the 3d images were popping out and in full bluray clarity. Speakers could be better but they are by no means bad for the size of the tv.", "Date": "February 18, 2011"}, {"Title": "Amazing picture", "Author": "Eugene Wood", "ReviewID": "R2CJ8EZPPQY745", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I'm moving up from a Sharp Aquos 46\". First and foremost, I wanted a 55in tv, and it HAD to be 240 hz. I compared many HDTVs before purchasing the Toshiba 55WX800 ($1579.00). I looked at Samsung UN55C8000 ($2100) , LG 55LX6500 ($1870) and SONY BRAVIA KDL55HX800 ($1947).  The Toshiba was the absolute best in terms of value, features and (in my opinion) looks. Especially with free shipping. I really didn't buy it for its 3D capabilities, I just want it for sports and video gaming. So I'll have to edit in the future, to review that feature (and I did get the 2 sets of 3D glasses included with this set). Its just not what I bought the TV for.I bought it from Amazon last Saturday evening (12/19/10) and it showed up on my doorstep in 4 days! The shipping company was great, and they pulled the top off of the HUGE box (with 4 little clips at the bottom of the box, revealing the TV so I could inspect it and plugged it in so I could see it was in working order. Excellent!The base and connecting items are very self explanatory and it took about 5 min. Once put together, it swivels about 30 degrees (side to side) so you can get behind it, or maybe adjust temporarily (actually, its so you can show off its \"thinness\" :-)  ). I CANNOT believe how thin this thing is! It just doesn't seem right. Its witchcraft I tell ya! Simply unbelievable. The TV case/enclosure is SOooo classy looking also. Very thin frame all around and the stand doesn't take away from the professional looks of the TV. The on/off button is touch sensor and for about ten seconds a little menu appears next to the on/off area giving you a few options. The lettering for on/off and quick menu are extremely sharp and professional looking as well. Then they go away as to not distract from the screen. My TV is in the power saver mode and it takes about 6 seconds to come on. That option can be turned off, but I dont mind. The screen is glossy glass, but I cannot see ANY glare when the set is on even in the day, and I have a glass door next to the set.I also cannot get over the clarity. The 240 hz is a big difference, and football and basketball are just beautiful. I dont see ANY clouding. You would have to turn the irritating cinema effect ON to let it bother you, but of course it can be turned off. I had to look for it to see what any complaints were about. Not an issue. There are about 6 typical viewing settings (like most tvs) and when you find one that works best for you, you can tweak from there.I did some minor tweaking with the remote, but it really didnt need any. I have a Harmony One Logitech Harmony One Universal Remote with Color Touchscreen remote control to control all of my items (dvd, xbox, tv, amp) and it was easy to just change the TV from my old Sharp Aquos, to the new Toshiba. That remote is one of the best things ever made, but that is for another review.I would HIGHLY suggest this HDTV to ANYONE looking for a 55 inch set. It was only a couple of hundred $$ more than some of the 46\"s, so if you have the room, its a no brainer!I love my Christmas gift to me! Its EXACTLY what I wanted!!!!!EDIT: After a week with this set one of the things I have learned.Not all tv channels are created equal so, dont pull your hair out trying to adjust the TV to every channel. I did and started to become disappointed trying to adjust to everything. Sports on ESPN, ESPN2, NBC,CBS and ABC look AMAZING. NBA, College football and NFL are recorded with awesome quality. It wont get any better. THAT'S what I would adjust the set to. Many other channels (including most commercials) seem to be recorded in a lower grade HD, or or not recorded in HD at all, and the quality is noticeably degraded. No setting will fix this.", "Date": "December 25, 2010"}, {"Title": "Almost perfect; go for it!", "Author": "critique glasses \"AK\"", "ReviewID": "R3UNWTJBVPW8E", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Price for value:I'm not someone who jumps at things with newest features; I wait for when the prices come down a bit and features are more stable. But when this TV was offered with free 3D starter and Blue-ray DVD player, it just did it for me. I totally think it is worth it.Shipping:I was impressed that all of the items arrived faster than scheduled, but sending them all together would have been better. They arrived at different times and you need to be home for TV to sign, but not the other ones. They just left DVD player (in rain!) without even bothering to ring the door bell. Luckily, I have a security camera that sends me Email when someone comes to my door and I picked it up quickly (isn't that cool?).Size, look, setup:All perfect and easy here. I setup it up alone, but it's a bit heavy and 2 people would be safer. I was in market for 55\", but the bundle was not offered with that one and I went down to 46\" with some reservations. That was a good decision; the size is good enough for my family room; they all look smaller in the stores with so many large TVs. It's an edge-lit LED (not back-lit) and the bright LED TV you see in store is just a marketing mode. But I already knew this and wasn't that surprized.Internet TV:Initially, I thought this feature is redundant bcz the DVD player does the job. But without a doubt this is the coolest feature for me so far. It comes already setup to work with yahoo widgets such as weather or news and also youtube videos. You can customize and constant access to say weather for your favorite locations. However, here is also when I took one star off: the wireless receiver is pretty weak. I have 4 laptops at every corner of my house with good reception, so it must be the TV. SW upgrades are already available, but it failed to download 3 times until i moved my wireless router right next to the TV from office. I need to take the router back to office, so i have to settle with intermittent internet connection. Bummer, and here goes one star! Hope DVD player has a better wireless reception. Bottom line you might need a wireless signal booster if your TV is far from your router.3D:I haven't got to test this yet, bcz i don't have a 3D movie yet. Would it kill you to throw a low-end 3D disk in the bundle? Now I have to write to Santa, so someone gives me a 3D movie just to test my bundle:-)Summary:Excellent deal!

Colors vibrant, detail amazing. On HD movies the picture is so perfect, yes a little bit of the \"Soap Opera Effect\", but I love it and my family also. Direct TV is amazing, it automatically configured for 3d channels (TV is not supported on DirectTV site, WHY?? it works perfectly). Glasses worked perfectly out of box and DirectTV 3d is amazing.

The TV arrived on time. Amazon did an awesome job as always. I got the 3d glasses and the 3d blu ray free with the TV. What an awesome deal. The glasses are a bit heavy and batteries need to be replaced when they run out. The glasses feel great on the eye and certainly have a high quality feel.The blu ray player is just average at par and I already experienced the dreaded \"Power Freeze\" three times so far.Coming back to the TV !! it is super thin, looks rich . Both 3D and 2D images are outstanding. HD movies have a Soap Opera feel to it, but to be honest I like it. This is by far the most clear the images get. I do not understand why people complain about this effect. That is what LED technology and the whopping 240Hz refresh rate is all about.Wireless connectivity was easy and unlike what other reviewers claim, I never got disconnected. The Net TV apps are a breeze to set up and work really well. TV speakers are nice and the sound is loud and clear. Obviously you need an external surround system to get the real effect , but the speakers are still better than ones in my 50\" LG Plasma.I have a Bose Cinemate system and pairing it up with the TV can easily bring down the roof :-) .The TV remote feels high class and the remote buttons are well placed.Overall I am very happy with my purchase.

Danielson", "ReviewID": "R1VXPJ69IZTYLY", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I have a 61\" 3D ready Samsung DLP for the living room and when we moved, my wife wanted a flat screen for the bedroom. She wanted to spend $900 on a nice store bought television but I told her for a couple hundred more you could find a deal that will deliver all the bells and whistles. That is when I found this diamond. Hey, this television is well worth the $2500 retail price but since the good people at Toshiba left the old firmware's default settings incorrectly, it ended up being a deal and a half. The Bluray works well after a software update despite of the reviews  and the 3D glasses are really nice. I will provide all the details below...1. Ordered the 46\" model on the 15th and requested the delivery on the earliest date of the 22nd of March. You will schedule a date and time so you will be home when it arrives, usually a week.2. I got a little anxious and downloaded the owner's manual. You should really skim through it because some of the negative reviews here could have been avoided if they read it.3. Pilot freight arrived and tried to give the television to my neighbor. Thank god I walked outside because the creep would have signed for it and I would have had a monster dispute on my credit card. I told the pilot guy, \"it that supposed to go to my address?\" He said, \"oh, sorry about that.\" He carried the TV into my house after noticing the correct address and asked if I wanted to take it out of the box to ensure it worked. Since the box had no damage and it had to go upstairs, I declined because the box was in great condition. I had to sign a paper indicating I did not want to test the television and he said that the 30 day guarantee was still fine, it would just delay the return by a day or two if there were any problems.4. The box is pretty big and everything was packed well. The box weighed about 65 pounds and was long -you may need help to set this up. The assembly instructions and tools are included for the stand. Spacers are included for wall mounts. Assembling the screen to the stand is alright but you should do this while the plastic wrap is still covering the screen on a soft surface. Once you plug it in and hit the power, it may take a few seconds to turn on so don't worry.5. Setup guides you through everything but the applications aspect, just hit the widget button to set everything up. It is not too complicated but anyone without good PC experience may run into problems. My firmware was the most current except for the widget software. Have a computer handy to make accounts and set up features like Pandora and Netflix.Here is the list of pros and cons....Pros:-The TV is sharp, picture quality is great, and daytime viewing is excellent. I went to Walmart to pick up a stand the day prior and looked at cheaper models. It was comparable to the $1000 LG model but offered the 3D option through the promotion, making this the best priced 3D LED LCD flatscreen on the market right now.-The wireless is fast but setup may have issues, explanation in tips.-The black levels are great, if you have dynalight on. I will talk about this more below in the tips section.-The streaming through DLNA works great but there is a con there too, I will get back to that in the tips section as well.-The sound does not travel too much outside of the room. It is great for bedrooms. If you are a sound buff that wants bass, get a tuner and speakers.-Component connections are ample and positioned well.-The Netflix, Blockbuster, Vudu, and Youtube options can save you the expense of another $100 device to buy and manage.Cons:-You can still see some reflection on the display in bright rooms. It is not as bad a some televisions but if I focused on it, it was there.-Some of the setup options may be a bit complicated for some users. Please review the manual because it can save you a lot of hassle. When setting up options, remember to look at the bottom 1\" of the screen for options that are detached from the main option screen and it can be missed easily.-The television was a little crooked on the stand even though the holes lined up. The only fix is to set it on the floor and loosen and re-tighten the hex screws again.-The widgets can be a little complicated. I still have not found a way to remove some of them that I do not use. You can easily remove the ones you downloaded but items like flicker are permanent.-Netflix does not give you the advanced genre features like the PC, PS3, XBOX, Roku, and other devices. I would like to see the selection categories and hope they add it in the future. I like the fact I do not have to turn on and control and additional device to watch it but it will only allow you to see your instant queue.-The wireless access point search ran for 5 minutes on me. I had to power the TV off and on again before they would show up in the assisted setup list.Note:Easy wireless is for your access point that uses a pin number.Assisted setup is for the computer types access point setup that has you pick the gateway and enter the password.Advanced setup is when you manually enter everything, including the SSID.3D quality:I currently have a Samsung 61\" DLP with checkerboard 3D ready and the quality of depth is amazing through a PC. The depth is incredible and was so inciting, it got me into the 3D generation. The problem there is the setup; I had to buy a kit for $150 to get it to work and it is limited to the power/options/games/software that your PC has with very limited device support. So far I have only tried this Toshiba with the PS3 and was not happy with the gaming results, however, the movies looked pretty good with medium depth. I did see very little ghosting on the video but Killzone 3 was absolutely horrid. Motorstorm was at best \"OK.\" I read that since the power on the PS3 was limited, it cut the resolution of the 3D games in half and ghosting is a game was a big issue. So please don't expect to get something great from a gaming console. I don't know about the XBOX 360 but hopefully, it will not be the same case. If you want to get the most of your 3D with this, use a PC with software like Tridef (they have a 14 day trial) with at least a DX11 video card with 1GB of RAM. I upgraded from a ATI Radeon 5750 to a Radeon 6870 and can play Fallout New Vegas at 1080P with all setting max with a pretty good frame rate of 40FPS average. If you have an earlier card and want to see some really good, jaw dropping 3D, play Half Life 2 with the Tridef software trial. It is what 3D is supposed to be.Tips:*When searching for an access point and it takes longer than 30 seconds to find any, try to exit and reenter the menu. If that doesn't work, turn the TV off and on again.*If you enter the wrong password in the wireless setting it will try to access for a few minutes and does not give you a failure message. Return will send you back to change it.*Remember to look at the bottom of the screen when typing in on the on screen keyboard. The wireless password and most other functions default to uppercase.*Use a new email for the Vudu application to get a $5.99 credit on a movie rental. Very nice! They are supposed to offer 3D in the future. The Bluray player and TV will get a $5.99 credit easily. I got an HDX 1080P connection over wireless N 2.4 GHz.*5GHz did not work well from one floor to another. Try to get at least a medium connection quality to get steaming to work well. An external antenna would have improved reception but it was \"alright\" for a TV I guess.*Some of the custom settings will not have dynalight enabled. If you want to make the TV brighter and not have to see the light leakage in the dark frames, go into the autoview base setting and raise the backlight level. This will keep the integrity of the black good while making the image brighter. Dynalight will adjust the black levels based on the amount of light that is present in the room. You can see it change when the light setting adjust in the room and it does make a big difference. A lot of reviews and pictures show this but I noticed this call out in the manual and determined it fixed the leakage problem in my case. When 3D is enabled, dynalight does not work as good but still helps. In the end folks, this complaint is why you can get a 3D TV with a Bluray, and 3D glasses for this price. Light leakage is normal with most laptops and is a fact of life with LCDs. If you don't want to see it, buy a plasma for a lower price but expect the lifespan to be cut to a quarter.*When playing with 3D on the PS3, I got some sort of rainbow screen that displayed a variety of colors and such. Shut the TV off and power back on to remedy. I suspect it was the Amazon HDMI cable.*UPDATED*If you want to stream media from a PC, this really does a good job but there are not a lot of codecs supported. I have tried the PS3 Media Server and TVersity and they did not work even with transcoding. I did find that Windows Media Player 12 works flawlessly and transcodes almost everything for you. I use a computer downstairs with a tuner with WMC and this will even stream recorded TV shows from the DVR. I am very happy with this DLNA media player in this TV.*Remember, most 3D devices need an HDMI 1.4 cable. You can get one from Amazon for around $10. I really have not experimented with that too much but I bough one just in case and it works other than the previously stated issue.Comments:This is a really great product and worth the price. I read the Razalink will even work with Toshiba laptops so this would be an ultimate PC monitor if you are loaded. As far as TV is concerned, watching TV through a PC with a tuner will save you money and give you more options in the long run. You just have to weigh the investment against paying the cable company for a cable box, DVR, streaming TV, and other features over a long period of time. I was very happy with this purchase and expect the TV to last at least 10 years. So, for $10 a month you could end up with a really nice piece of equipment that will give you years of enjoyment. I was really excited about this and this is my first, real, in-depth review. I would have appreciated this before I bought it and hopefully it will help you in making a choice for a premium product for a bargain bin price. Hey, just go look at the prices of other 3D TVs and you will see what I am talking about.", "Date": "March 22, 2011"}, {"Title": "TOO GOOD TO BE TRUE..........BUT IT IS!  - 3 updates 01/17/12", "Author": "sportsterhd", "ReviewID": "R3CSGYWJA64B5Y", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "First of all, i want to say that amazon does a great job with shipping these things.  the company they use seems to be very conscientious and efficient.  i'm sure some folks have had accidents with their tv's, but mine and the others i saw at the warehouse were in fine shape.  i was antsy to get it up and working because we had a house full over the new years weekend, so i didn't wait for delivery. the bluray player was first to arrive, the tv second on thursday, and the 3D glasses showed up just in the nick of time on friday, along with all our house guests.  i had THE LEGEND OF THE GUARDIANS all set for the grandkids.  the 3D is spectacular!i had my mind made up that i was going to buy a sharp quattron......and then i saw this deal spring up right before Christmas, and i didn't get grandma talked into it until the day after.  i had read every review before buying this thing sight unseen. i took particular note of the reviews from people who said the picture was on par with sony, samsung, and panasonic.  in my opinion, it is that and more.  STUNNING is the only word to describe it.  with only a couple small tweaks from the factory settings, i feel as though we are there in THE OFFICE with jim and pam and michael and dwight.  which, brings me to the so called 'soap opera effect'.we have watched THE OFFICE, OUTSOURCED, DESPERATE HOUSEWIVES, TWO AND A HALF MEN, BIG BANG THEORY, THE TONIGHT SHOW, THE LATE SHOW, THE LATE LATE SHOW, and the local news, etc.  the soap opera effect is evident in almost everything, and we love it!  my stepson, who has owned 2 hdtv's was astounded at how great those shows looked on our new tv.  we have a sanyo up in the bedroom, and i have looked at a lot of tv's in store displays (realizing that they are not all tweaked to my taste).  we decided that it must be the 240hz that makes the difference.  so the engineers have made a tv that delivers a picture so stunning that even 2D broadcast tv looks almost 3D, and we have people who complain that it looks too good?  i come from the humble beginnings of television in the early 50's......real ghosting, antenna problems, fuzz, horizontal hold, vertical hold, small screen, black and white, etc, etc.  it was considered an advancement when video tape replaced film and kinescope.  the picture was so much clearer, even if it was still black and white.  then color came along, but all tv's weren't created equal, with adjustment limits, and color bleed.  sony and sylvania kind of pioneered the best color picture tubes, followed by a korean company, samsung.....reds were red, blacks were black, purple was purple, and yellow was yellow, not green.  television has come a long way, and i have seen it all along the way.  again, this tv is absolutely one of the best pictures i have ever seen in any tv.  one of my acid tests, besides black being black, is blonde hair that does not have a green tinge to it.  most lesser tv's, when you have everything else adjusted properly, blond hair still doesn't look right....and if you get it right, everything else is off.  with this baby, not only are the VIKINGS uniforms purple and the field green, but you can almost count the strands of beautiful blond hair on the weather girl's head.  the picture is so perfect OTA that i can't help but wonder if some of the complainers aren't limiting their experience to cable or satellite, which may or may not be a perfect delivery in their area.  the fact that in some instances film almost looks like video tape, for me, is a plusour old tv in the family room was not HD, so consequently, our satellite setup is still old school.  i am currently in the process of arguing with directv, or switching to dish, so i can't compare.  however, our OTA choices in the des moines area are excellent.the last thing i want to address is the flashlighting that people find so offensive.  who watches a blank screen?  the only time you can see it is when the screen goes blank for a few seconds.  so what?  yes, it's there.....faintly!  most LED tv's have it.  read the reviews.  the slim profile of the screen, low power consumption and heat, and, (did i say?) absolutely stunning picture, are worth the LED backlighting.  you can't go wrong, especially for a tv that right now, is half the comparable brands' price.  thanks to toshiba and amazon for coming together on what i now regard as the best deal out there right now in a 3D tv.  long term?  i may be back........... -danUPDATE - still love it, and have discovered a few things.  some folks have mentioned ghosting in the 3D display watching movies.  i have two different HDMI cables that i have tried between the player and the tv.  there is a significant difference between the two.  both are supposed to be 3D capable.  one is an RCA cable that says nothing about HDMI v1.4 and the other is a amazon basics cable that is supposed to be v1.4 and ethernet.  the RCA cable that only says 3D on the packaging is actually better, so you might try another HDMI cable rather than returning the tv.second, if you get this bundle with the tv, player, and glasses, you may not like the player.  it works fine with one annoying exception.  after you've used it and turned it off, you can't turn it back on with the remote or touch panel on the front.  you have to unplug the unit and plug it back in to reset it.  i'm hoping toshiba comes up with a fix for this that can be downloaded from the internet.  i thought it was pretty odd and went searching online for answers and found that lots of folks have the same problem and came up with the same uncomfortable workaround.UPDATE2 - two things to update.  sometime around the first of february 2011 the blu-ray player got an internet update.  it seems to have solved all the freeze up problems that i encountered.  and, to be honest, it wasn't that problematic for me.  it only did it a handful of times.  now it works just as it should.i feel i have to address something else that bugs me each time i read a negative review on this tv.  i'm not an apologist for toshiba, but the lion's share of 1 and 2 star reviews just plain come from impatience and ignorance of how the product works or they are complaining about something other than the tv itself.  some complain of glare.......ok, that's a valid criticism, but not that long ago, ALL tv's had glass screens that would pick up a lamp or open window shade.  those things are easily handled, and even more easily handled thanks to the fact that the tv swivels on the stand. very slight turns of the tv will deal with a lamp or window that you can't move or turn off.  and along this line of thought, i've never seen a tv that can be placed between two windows (as we have ours placed)at midday, curtains open, that will out-brilliant the windows.  it has a feature that automatically adjusts to ambient light, and if the ambient light is sunshine, it out shines the sun in a very viewable way. it is one of the most uncanny things we have noticed about watching this tv.some folks nit pick the boot up time.  we waited twice as long in the 50's for the tubes to warm up just so we could watch a blurry, snowy picture......and loved it.  this is well worth the wait.  some folks nit pick the time involved with channel changes.  there is an 'ok' button on the remote that makes it instantaneous.  some folks nit pick the stand.....  there is a hole in the back of the bottom plate that a screw can be installed for added piece of mind.  some folks claim that it only has two hdmi inputs.......there are four and i'm thinking they are reviewing a different tv.  some folks didn't get the free glasses and blu-ray player........that was their own failing to notice or perform the steps needed to get the freebies.  some folks had a beef with the shipping company.......that's a beef with the shipping company.  some folks complain about the connectivity of the internet capability........that is valid, but it is redundant because the blu-ray player has the same feature and enjoys a better connection.  some folks nit pick the sound......that is valid, however, the tv is only an inch thick!  there isn't room for a 15\" woofer in there.  besides, most folks that desire a tv like this have or intend to buy a sound system to hook up to it.  some folks claim the 3D is terrible, but they are probably using a $5 standard hdmi cord between components.  as a person who grew up many many years before microwave ovens, i can only picture these people standing, waiting for their food, screaming at the machine, \"hurry up!\"no doubt, some folks got broken or malfunctioning tv's.  however, i feel that those who returned this tv without bothering to learn about it, missed one heck of a bargain.  i consider this to be one of the top 5 purchases i've ever made.  it delivers a picture that is as good or better than any i've seen.....and that includes sony, samsung, panasonic and sharp.  directv decided they wanted to keep my business, and i got to watch the NCAA national championship game in 3D.  after two months, we absolutely love our new tv, and learn something new about it every day.UPDATE 3 - Well, we are over a year in, and we are still loving this TV.  My wife is usually pretty passive when it comes to technology, but this thing actually makes her comment frequently on how much she appreciates everything about it.  Everything I said above is still valid.  As my library of 3D expands, I've come to the realization (I guess i knew it intuitively) that not all 3D content is equal.  I have a lot on my new DVR that I recorded from the Directv 3D channels, plus a few movies that I bought.  To date, the movie that really pops most clearly in 3D is CAPTAIN AMERICA.  I have to kind of chuckle when I read other reviewers that put down the 3D.  There are so many things that influence what you get, from the quality of the hdmi cable, to glasses batteries, to how close you are to the emitters, to the source material itself, that you just have to enjoy it for what it is.  No matter what brand you are watching, there can and will be issues with 3D that aren't the TV's fault.  You have to just sit back and enjoy what you get and not pick it apart.  I'm convinced this is as good as it gets for now.  We'll see what they are able to achieve in the future with passive glasses, but they have their work cut out for them to improve on the color quality and clarity you get with active glasses.It is amazing how many 2D shows have an almost 3D feel, the picture is so vivid.  People still comment on how beautiful the picture is, even on a sunny afternoon, with unshaded windows on each side of it.I thought maybe Toshiba might have replaced this model, but it is still prominent (and expensive) on their website, so this Cinema Series must still be the flagship.  The more time you spend with this TV and discover everything they built into it, the more you realize it isn't just a simple television.", "Date": "January 4, 2011"}, {"Title": "Good value product, but some problems.", "Author": "J.

We saw terrible reflections on its screen though there were no windows which directly casted sunlight over the screen. But, other than that, its picture quality was near perfect. Amazingly vivid color, crisp picture, wonderful white uniformity, etc. We played many Netflix videos and were surprised with some video's beautiful picture quality, though it basically depended on the source. I mean, some sources were wonderful, others were just soso because they were originally SD videos. I borrowed a PS3 from a friend of mine and played a couple of blurays I got. Kungfu Panda almost made me cry with joy. It was so vivid that the animation looked like a 3D film!When it became dark, I turned off all lights and inserted the Dark Knight disc to test its dark room performance. The sad story begins here. I did see some clouding during the daytime, but it was hardly noticeable. However, when it was dark, the clouding effect was quite distracting whenever the TV showed night scenes. It was not extremely severe, but I couldn't just ignore it and concentrate on the movie. Another problem I saw was its subpar shadow detail. With the default brightness level of the Movie 1 setting, I couldn't discern objects and details in shadow areas. When I raised the brightness enough to discern objects, the black level went up so high that it looked like old LCD monitors that I used in my college.Another thing that drove me mad was its DLNA functionality. I struggled for over 2 hours to make it play movie files stored in my Synology NAS and concluded it was just useless. It only accepts few file types such as mpg and mp4. (and the manual didn't cover this!!!) If you want to play mkv or m2ts, you're out of luck. Basically, if you want to use this TV set to play over DLNA, you should use DLNA servers with transcoding functionality, which consumes a lot of power and degrades picture quality. And it still has problems with transcoding servers or MP4 files. I won't cover the details, but I recommend just ignoring its DLNA functionality and USB movie playing, period.I think this TV set has great value especially considering its decent price. If you're not a hardcore picture quality maniac, you'll probably love this TV set. But, sadly, I am. I need a TV set I can use for at least 5 years, and I don't want to regret my purchase whenever I play movies with plenty dark scenes during nighttime. I think I'll return this and go with a Panny PDP.--------* UPDATEI adjust the rating from 3 stars to 4 stars. After playing with this TV one more day, I found that clouding artifact is almost invisible unless the room is completely dark. Even turning on only one light made clouding and bleeding impossible to notice. Now I think this TV deserves 3.5 stars, at the very least, and given its super-bargain price, even giving 4 stars is not overrating.

And the 3D works AWESOME!", "Author": "Mark R. Linke", "ReviewID": "R2G0DP8HD1BYY9", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "First off, I was shopping for a 55\" LED but I was not in the market for a 3D TV as I didn't think it would be worth the extra premium. Then Amazon offered this set with 2 pairs of 3D glasses for $1549 which brought it into standard LED territory! So after reading reviews here and on other sites I decided to pull the trigger and buy this behemoth. All I can say is that it's a very nice TV for the money and the picture is beautiful! I bought a 46\" Samsung LCD three years ago and spent more money than I did on this TV!Here are a few of my observations:1) The screen has a plasma-like reflective surface compared to a normal LCD so it's almost a mirror when turned off in a bright room. Once you turn on the set however the bright, clear picture eliminates the vast majority of the reflection. My TV is in a corner next to two large windows and about 20 feet opposite of my sliding door so it's in a very bright room but the picture is 90% unaffected with the only reflections being observed against dark backgrounds. This seems to be the new vogue for LED TVs so I'm fairly certain most if not all LEDs are like this so it's not a criticism of this TV in particular.2) No component Audio Output. Not really a big deal for some but unfortunately my 12 year old Sony surround sound receiver isn't equipped with an optical digital input or HDMI so I'm unable to connect the set directly to my receiver. This is a bummer as it looks like I'll be spending a little more money than expected on an a new receiver (shhh, don't tell my wife!). While most say the audio on this TV is terrible I'd give it a C+ after playing with the equalizer a little bit. No bass but it's adequate for regular TV watching though for movies you'll definitely want an external surround system. Again, I think this is problematic with LEDs in general due to their thin size so it's not really a problem for me.3) The 3D works incredibly! My local cable provider offers sample 3D programming and even though it is in 1080i the 3D effect was identical to anything you'll find in a movie theater. I haven't picked up a BluRay 3D movie yet but I'm sure it will be as good if not better. The effect was stunning and to me makes having the 3D capability so worth the money. I couldn't wait to call my buddy to brag about the set after watching the first 3D program!4) The shipping estimate provided by Amazon is definitely not accurate. Mine had an ETA of 3/25 but that's the day I received a call from the 3rd party shipping company and I didn't end up getting the TV until 3/29. The package arrived in perfect condition however but I was under the impression from Amazon's messages that the arrival date would be sooner. Good to know so you don't take the day off work until you actually hear from the shipping company.All in all I am very impressed with this set and definitely reoommend it. You definitely can't beat the price for what you get!", "Date": "March 29, 2011"}, {"Title": "THE WORKS!", "Author": "Jon", "ReviewID": "R21E0KVP94XO71", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I purchased a USED-Acceptable TV from amazon warehouse. It stated it wouldnt be in original box which would be fine with me, and it also stated major cosmetic blemishes on back of tv, which again would be absolutely fine with me. When I got it, it was in a factory Toshiba box. The handles were slightly ripped but that didnt matter. When I got it home I opened it up and I tell you this must be a brand new TV! NOT a scratch on it or anything of the sort anywhere! Still had thin foam paper covering the screen and all the factory parts as well!  The picture quality is superb! I have not used the 3D yet as it doesnt come with glasses, which is fine because I bought this mainly for the price, $1150 \"used\" is far cheaper than the $1999 - $2999 I have been seeing this go for. I also got the extended Square Trade warranty. You gotta protect these investments.And a wall mount for just shy of $40, although the price of this has gone up some since I got it.http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000NMFCIA  The inputs were on the right side as opposed to the many other TV's I researched, so I have to rearrange cabinets I have for the devices for the TV. (I spent a good 2 months searching, researching, and then revaluate that search, etc, etc) Was going for the LG 55LE5400 but on the night of the decided purchase, the LG price was up a little (Amazon prices regularly fluctuate, from hours to days) so I looked around some and saw this Toshiba.  LED was important for power savings. I love how the WIFI is actually built into the TV and also has option for ethernet (The WIFI works fine though) although there arent nearly as many options for widgits as a Sony it is still very well off I think, 3D was just an investment for the future and not a key reason for the buy but am happy that I have the option for it, and the size and sleekness is just amazing. The overlying glass is quite reflective but it is in a darker room with one large door that is covered so I dont have an issue with sunlight relfecting on the screen. As with all thin tvs, the sound is not the quality of a surround sound system, but it is still very good. I have not put the volume past 35 so far and it is quite loud so no real issues there.  The black levels are outstanding while watching something like the \"Caves\" episode on channel \"Green Earth HD\" I do notice a little lighter splotches in certain parts of screen but thats only when changing inputs or on a dark load screen from a game system. I DO NOT notice the splotches when watching something thats dark, just to be clear, only when on game mode and playing a game (game mode allows for split second controller to TV response time wonderfully as well as bring up brightness levels a little. There is a difference between response times with a game in game mode and a game in Autoview mode)  Overall, This TV is absolutely stunning! It is the cats meow! Its as simple as that!

Ten months in, the \"Power Board\" (circuit board that controls the main power) went out.  Fixed under warranty only to have it go out again a month and a half later!  Twice Nexicorp (the warranty company) sends the repair tech the wrong board and here it is February 17 and a dead TV and now for months a supposed \"Power Board\" on back order for who knows how long.  Toshiba rep said maybe they can do something for me.  Woops, some imbecile at the warranty company told Toshiba rep it was the end of December 2011 that I had the problem and it was out of warranty.  The person at the warranty company didn't bother to look at my history with them because the problem started in October and that's when I called them for FIRST repair.  Now Toshiba says sorry nothing we can do.  I spent over $1,400 a year ago and now a completely dead TV.  So much for a good deal from Amazon.  I have a Vizio that is 7 years old and still works like new!!!  A lot of people on here gave good reviews for this TV but just wait a year or so and see what happens.  The TV repair man told me his number one repair is with Toshiba and most are the same problem, the \"Power Board\" goes bad in 6-18 months.  Don't believe me?  Feel lucky?  Well do ya'?  Go ahead, buy one of these from Amazon and see what happens.  As for me, no more Toshiba and no more Amazon for big ticket items like this.WANT AN UPDATE?  Here it is:  Toshiba support finally came through!  They said they couldn't send me a new model because I had mine too long and they couldn't send me a refurbished model to replace it because they didn't have any more (like I really wanted a refurb) so they gave me the choice between continuing to wait for another power board replacement or they would take mine back and send me a check for $890.  Thank you, I'll take the money and Toshiba can have their TV back.Here's the bottom line:  This is not really a Toshiba only problem.  I've got a top of the line Sony portable DVD player and guess what it says on the box: MADE IN CHINA!  That's right!  In the past 8 years most of the big Japanese companies have farmed out their manufacturing to the slave driving Foxconn and other Chinese 16 hour day sweat shop electronics manufacturers that are turning out a ton of total crap.  Buying any brand, whether it be a non big name brand like Vizio or a total big name like JVC, LG, Toshiba or Sony, it is all now a total crap shoot!  So what's the answer?  I've got 3 Vizio TV's including one that is 7 years old and they all work perfectly with great looking picture quality.  I just got a Vizio M3D460SR to replace the Toshiba and not only does the picture quality rival the Toshiba but the Passive 3D looks as good as the Toshiba Active Shutter with cheaper more comfortable 3D glasses without any eye fatigue and it all costs hundreds less than the Toshiba!  Not only that but the Vizio comes with Bluetooth (Toshiba doesn't offer that) and now I can pair up my cell phone stereo Bluetooth headset or Bluetooth external speaker system with it.  Very cool and convenient!  Even if the Toshiba or the Samdung or LG is a little better here or there the Vizio savings and extra features with near rivaling quality makes it a much better deal and experience.  And to top it off, with the Vizio savings and buying at Sam's Club (where I got it) or even Costco, for around $70-$80 you can have a 3 year extended warranty to totally cover your monkey butt!  As far as I'm concerned, 3-5 years from now Vizio is going to be considered a big name brand in the same vane as Toshiba, LG and the rest.  I'm totally sold on Vizio now.  If I'm going to have to deal with Made In China, I'd rather spend less, have less aggravation and still have my butt covered.

I have reviewed the last two lcd models that I have owned.  I just got this today and have really just started messing around with it.APPEARANCE:  This is one sexy television.  The frame blends into the tv under a single pane of glass. Thin, thin, thin! It is up there with the Samsungs as far as looks are concerned.  Even the stand looks awesome.  On the negative side... the glass is very shiny and shows every reflection that it can find!  The crystal clear coat that is supposed to diffuse these reflections must not have been applied here.  I have noticed that just about everyone but Vizio is going to shiny screens... it's a shame!SOUND:  Surprisingly strong!  My last Toshiba had horrible out of the box sound that really needed tweaking to sound good.  Not this one... I am not claiming that it is home theater quality but it's clear and has some depth to it.  Good job Toshiba.PICTURE:  This is really what it's all about and the tv does not disappoint.  SD picture quality is as good as any display that I have seen.  HD picture quality is easily as good as the Samsungs and better than Sony, LG etc.  Even the out of the box picture mode, movie 2, is awesome.  I used full calibration settings and I think movie 2 is just as good.  Colors are rich and really pop and images are clear and smooth.  You definitely want to set stabilization to standard!  On to the negatives... black is not anywhere near as dark as my last Toshiba.  I will say that that last lcd was as good as any plasma that I have seen!  The blacks are surely not the worst but also not the best.  I will have to see what I think of this when I watch more movies.  Next... the dreaded clouding issue.  The clouds are there!  I have not yet been able to see them when there is actually something on the tv.  When watching a letterbox film there was only flashlighting in one corner as opposed to the two on my last set.  I plan to attach usb fans to the back of the tv to get rid of this but I haven't gotten them yet.  I will update on how they work.  So far I must say that the clouding issue seems not to be that bad on my tv.  I have not tested 3D as I could care less about it.CONCLUSION:  Overall I have to say that this tv at Amazon's price with free shipping is the best value on the market.  This is a great tv with a few flaws but I could not be happier so far.  If anything changes I will update the review but as of now I would recommend this set to anyone who cannot afford to spend hundreds or even a thousand more and still wants a top notch set!UPDATE 5/12/2011:  Still thrilled with the overall picture quality.  Equal to any other set that I have seen.  I am also still not entirely thrilled with the black level.  It's not terrible but it just isn't as dark as my last Toshiba set.  Only seems to be an issue when watching letterbox movies for the most part but watching Machete blu-ray I could definitely notice the less than stellar blacks... still working on this one!  I attached 2 small USB fans to the back of the tv that I purchased for $13 on Amazon, plugged them into the USB port on the tv and NO MORE CLOUDING... GONE!  Best of all, you don't need a fan controller, they go on when the tv goes on.UPDATE 5/19/2011:  I have finally gotten a respectable black level on bluray!  I activated the auto brightness setting while in movie 2 settings.  The auto setting was horrible when i tried it on cable but on bluray it looks great.  At this point it seems that I have a top of the line picture with actual black in it!

The size is perfect and the actual exterior of the TV is magnificent.  We mounted it on our wall and it was like a piece of art.  However, we slowly grew to regret our purchase.  We bought this TV primarily for the 3D capability and the high image quality reported by reviewers.  About us: We are heavy gamers and love watching bluray movies.  I will say that the 2D picture is incredible.  The colors are vivid and the picture is crystal clear.  However, you really do have to tinker with the settings to get things just right.  Like most other reviewers, we did not like the 240hz and the \"soap opera\" effect it created with the unnatural camera movement.  However, this is all moot because less than 24 hours after we unpacked the TV a pixel died and now we have a bright green spot on the TV.  It is extremely noticeable and bothersome so we will not be keeping this TV and will try a different manufacturer.  Nevertheless and rather than go into a lengthy review here are the pros and cons as we judged:PROS:-Beautiful TV exterior-Crisp vibrant 2D picture-Built in Wifi (worked great for us)-Good sound/audioCONS;-Very reflective screen-Pixel died in less than one day - the pixel turned bright green so not exactly invisible-Noticeable \"clouding\" / LED bleedthrough.  Most noticeable in upper corners and in spots in upper center of screen.  Looks like headlights in fog.-Takes 20 seconds to turn on/warm up (yes, we timed it)-3D was deep but didn't \"jump out of the screen\" so to speak... so mediocre.  Also caused us considerable eye strain.  I literally felt tired after watching a 3D movie.-Not the easiest TV to setup - so many settings and often times the settings would not save as we changed from input to input.This was our second TV as the first one arrived broken.  It was disappointing that the second TV already experienced a dead pixel but perhaps it was for the best as we are trying a TV we've had our eye on for a while despite a higher price.

I got it with the glasses and blue-ray bundle and after some shipping problems (which amazon quickly fixed BTW) I've gotten to enjoy the setup for about two weeks now. Since there are so many reviews I wont go into all the basics, plenty of ppl have covered that already. Things I didnt see covered that mattered to me I'll cover.1st the \"clouding\" you see in some user posted pics... I had to look real hard to find it first off. Its there but I only noticed it because of being told it exists. None of my family or friends have seen it in the hours upon hours of movie watching so that tells you something. If thats your only concern (was mine) then dont worry about it and buy the TV you will be very happy.2nd internet apps: Well they very limited first off.. you have the few they list and thats it. I guess new ones might come sooner or later but not a big deal. The one thing I noticed is most of them were missing and I had problems accessing them until I perfomed the software update. Did that and it fixed the problem. So do that right out of the box (mine has has 2 software updats so far) both were easy and only took a few minutes to finish.3rd screen glare: Its there, but very managable. My tv is in a corner and angled in my living room (next to window) so it catches a lot of incoming light and reflections. which while the tv is off or on a black screen looks like a mirror, but as soon as a picture is displayed you dont notice the reflection. The picture is so clear and bright it out shines any reflections.4th 3d: Even though it was not my primary reason for purchase it still mattered right, who doesn't want 3D. Well I've used it once on a comcast 3d prgram and it seamed to work good after I figuered out how to set up the 3d part on the tv. But as far as I could tell it looks very similar to what you experiance at the theater and all. I've never been a huge fan of 3D so idk if I could watch a long movie in 3d with glasses on.5th wireless: This is one of the reason I about the tv (dont like cords). Let me first start off by saying I also bought a new netgear wndr4000 dual band wireless router with 5ghz in all just for this tv. Its about 30' from my tv, seperated by 2 walls and the 5ghz signal is too weak for the tv. I'm not sure if its more the tv wireless reciever or the router but it is a bit annoying.

I only notice that when there is no picture on the display, otherwise no problem at all. Don't let that factor sway your purchase at all because the picture quality is the best I've ever seen for the price.  It's breathtaking clarity and beauty. The set is ultra thin and awesome to look at. All of the reviews I have read were right about the fact that it's just as good if not better than it's competitors like Samsung, Sharp, etc.  I am extremely picky about video quality and this TV just keeps having me say OMG, I can't believe how good this looks. How sharp with clean lines not jaggedy edges and brilliant colors. I can see more colors now that I never noticed before. Blacks are black, whites are white and most darkened areas have incredible shadow detail and brilliant highlights. The 3D is better than anything I have seen at Costco that was on display.

Amazon was helpful in sorting this out.  My concern was TV screen was full of moisture content when I received it. Found TV packaging was damaged on one end, but there were no visible scratches and damages in the TV.  Now coming to real feel and experience of the TV, the TV is so thin and nice picture quality. I didn't experience any of the opera effect or I might not be realizing it. 3D movie experience was good, but the TV screen is much glaring where you can use it as mirror literally. It's that bad. Clouding is next big thing which I noticed in the dark screens. I am not sure whether it is common problem with all LED TV or it is only happening in this TV. Reason I am asking is that now LED TV technology is kind of matured and early TV's were having this clouding (foggy) problem.  I am thinking whether to get used to clouding problem or not. Anybody wants to add anything to the nature of the clouding problem please do so.  Wifi reception is poor, so I installed my wifi router just below the TV to get the wifi signal. The Bluray player which came along with this nicely picked up the wifi signal even from the farther distance (this is the only feature worked in Blu-ray player, that's different issue and not to context of this TV, just mentioned here to say how weak is wifi reception.) I have tried VUDU, Netflix, yahoo widgets and the flickr which are all good. Once I had problem when I pressed the nettv button as soon as TV is switched on and it displays the message saying app is now loading and never showed up anything except blank screen. Then I restarted the TV to get the net app. Hope it won't happen again. I have problem with Youtube that whenever I played the video in youtube, TV screen flickers couple of times before it plays the video. Is  this happening to others?  In General, TV is nice looking, nice picture both 2d and 3d and best deal in the market. The main problem is clouding ( foggy in the dark screen) and highly reflective monolithic screen. I managed the poor wifi reception by placing wifi router next to the TV.

Deeper blacks, sharper picture, less 'pixelation', much less input lag with my Xbox360...and of course 3D, which the Vizio doesnt even have.

I usually read a lot of reviews before buying stuff like this but this time I didn't and so far I don't regret it. I got an awesome deal on the unit and it came with a free 3D BD player (the BD player isn't the greatest) and two sets of 3D glasses (which aren't made for big heads like mine so I get sore with them on), I paid 800 less than they wanted at the local electronics store!!! ($1040).I will admit that non-HD content looks a bit odd on the screen, a bit like watching soap operas or home video, but stuff that was made for HD looks awesome, I mean AMAZING!I just found that the source signal has a big impact on the way things look on this TV, my cable box can output 1080i or 720p. I had been using 1080i and thought some stuff looked weird so I switched it to 720p, yikes it was horrible. So, if your planning on purchasing this TV make sure you have a good signal to send it. Sunday I'm getting DirecTV, their HD is in 1080p so maybe it will get even better! I'll let you all know.I like the NetTV features but wish I could use it to see my albums on Picasa. However, since the TV is DLNA certified I was able to connect it to my NAS (network attached storage) and can view my media easily from the TV. And best of all the connection to my network is wireless, andI didn't have to pay any extra to get the wireless capabilities (I think Samsung makes you purchase a wireless adapter for their TVs).I can't really comment on sound since I use my home theater system for sound, but I have never owned a TV that lives up to my sound standards, I will say for a TV this thin I was impressed they were able to get the sound quality into it that it does have.Anyway, I LOVE THIS TV.

Toshiba sleeps with Sharp...Sharp was a pioneer in LCD technology.  Spend the time to adjust the image on this TV and it will blow you away.  Out of the box, the image is too harsh and detailed...everything looked like a cheap soap opera set with fake props.  You could even tell that the actors were on a stage set.  The picture was so real that it did not feel natural.  Like another poster, I was thinking about returning it, thank goodness I didn't!!!  I left it in the automatic picture setting, changed the back lighting, contrast, and turned down the color.  When tweaked properly, the picture on this TV is as good, if not better than the heavily marketed units.  I've used 2D and 3D.  Standard 2D viewing, especially with blu-ray movies, is awesome (my friends told me they were talking about my TV the next day at work).  From what I've sampled in the store and with this TV, LEDs/LCDs have issues with 3D viewing.  Plasma seems better when it comes to 3D viewing, to me.  With the LCDs/LEDs that I've sampled, you have to sit upright with your head straight, right in front of the TV and at a certain distance away from the TV.  If you tilt your head, sit too close, or sit off to the side, 3D turns into a \"big D\" for disappointment.Bottom line, if you're in the market for a new TV, spend your money wisely, take advantage of this deal.  I got it for the posted price with an additional 20% off because of a holiday special being offered to Chase Amazon credit card holders (until 12/31/2010).  However, if you want to spend the $1000-$2000 dollars more on a TV that is endorsed by magazines that make tons of money off of their marketing...then go ahead, like the car commercial says, it's the season of indulgence.Addendum: I spoke to a salesman at a brick and mortar store about the beams of light or \"clouding\" that different posters have mentioned.  They can be seen when the screen goes dark (usually when there is no signal).  The salesman showed me the same thing on a TV from another manufacturer with edge lit technology...it can't be avoided.  It's not a defect, it's a function  of the cost-savings technology.  Clearly, edge lit technology isn't for everyone.  Complaining about it is like complaining that your basic edition vehicle (that cost you $1,000s less), doesn't have the same features as the deluxe version.

Unfortunately after only having this approximately 2-1/2 months the tv would die after turning it on with an error message regarding the fan and to unplug it so you do not damage other components. I called Toshiba, told them what happened that it said it was the fan and even read them word for word what the message was as we took a picture of it.  The response back was that it was the cooling fan. They wrote up the service order and said I would be hearing from their authorized repair center. This was on 07/07/11, the TV died on 07/02/11 but I was on vacation (I was called about the problem on 07/02/11). Then on 07/11/11 stating that the main board & fan were due into them on 07/14/11 and I would get a call shortly after to schedule an appointment.  Well that date came & went so I called them on 07/18/11 and at that point I am told that the part is on backorder again and is due on 07/21/11. I asked if it is due to ship or due into them and they said into them at their service center. I then proceed to call Toshiba, have my problem escalated to their case managers dept who tells me there is nothing he can do until the 21st as they have to wait a certain number of days after the first initial call from the consumer.  I get a call on the 21st from their repair technician asking what exactly is wrong with my tv, I tell him that the message on the tv was the fan and then the tv would turn off, but also informed him that Toshiba stated it was the cooling fan. Considering the repair tech did not have a fan you would've thought he'd say oh wait I don't have a fan but nooooo he schedules an appointment for 07/23/11. He shows up at 1pm on the 23rd, proceeds to take my television apart, puts in a brand new motherboard, then says he has a 2nd motherboard that doesn't even belong to my television. I told him that it was not the motherboard it was the fan, and showed him the error message that I took a picture of with my phone. He then turns the tv on and oh gee whiz the tv doesn't work and the same error message. So he calls his center, orders a fan says he'll contact me on Monday.  No call, I call the authorized repair center they say it's ordered but have no answer form Toshiba as to a delivery date. I call Toshiba the same date, get told there is nothing they can do because it was ordered by the repair center, I call the repair center back the next day and still no response for a due date from Toshiba. But I am then informed that yes the repair center ordered the initial motherboards but that was what they were told to order based on the diagnosis from Toshiba. I tell them there was no diagnosis I flat out told them it was the fan & they said yes it's the cooling fan. Called back the repair center today, 07/27/11, and still no answer from Toshiba on delivery date, I then call the case managers dept again only to be greeted by a very monotone robot who seemed to be reading from a script. I asked for someone above her and get told that it can't be escalated above the case manager, I then ask for the president and I get the same response, I then ask for the corporate headquarters number and again the same response of not being able to escalate it above the case managers.Oh and let's not forget what I was initially told when I made my first call which was \"that's why you have a manufacturers warranty to fix these problems.\" Let me tell you that sent me through the roof. I was a purchasing agent for over 25 years and this has got to be the worst case of customer service I have ever experienced.  Yes you have a warranty but it should not have to be used in the first 2-1/2 months. This tells me Toshiba uses cheap parts, cheap labor and they do not process their electronics through Quality Control (yes I was an electronics buyer). And of course it is too late to return this to Amazon so basically I am screwed with a non-working TV! Toshiba's quality use to be good but it now stinks!

In less than 24 hours I got an email from Amazon stating they sent me a new TV, was sending a truck to pick up the broken piece of crap TV and that they apologize for any inconvenience this may have caused.  WOW!!  Now that is customer service at its finest!!!  When Toshiba's head escalations officer finally contacted me, I had said I was trying to find an email address to email the president of Toshiba and she said that they got my message loud and clear from the complaint I posted.  She then proceeded to tell me that they would like to replace the television but needed all sorts of information.

Can't wait for football season!! Amazon used a delivery company called pilot. They were great! They delivered the TV without any damage and even helped me assemble the stand. Netflix works super! I haven't tried all the other net channels. I read all the reviews on this TV and the mention about the blacks are cloudy, the 240hz must be off for the 3d to prevent jumpy screen. None of this has to be adjusted on my unit. I noticed when I put it on 3d the 240hz setting went off, the blacks are incredible! On the second day, the TV asked me if I would want to download the latest updates, which I did. I guess the only complaint and its a small complaint is while watching a 2D movie, if I press the 3D button and put the glasses on the screen is not watchable! Its distorted, but in watching a 3D movie from my player or cable company is great! Am I doing something wrong?UPDATE: Thanks to comments I wasn't doing anything wrong. This set will not convert 2D to 3D. No problem for me the other sets I have looked at that do convert 2D to 3D are not exciting anyway. Still love this TV, huge bright picture with deep black that I have not seen before and super colors. This sets blows away any other set I have owned and I've owned quite a few! 3D from my cable company is incredible!

If you have an old stereo like I do with only analog audio inputs, you will need a digital to analog converter. Amazon is selling the Fiio D3 digital to analog converter with cable for $24. You just connect the  cable to the tv then to the converter, run the analog audio cables from the converter to your stereo and you are all set! No noise! No delay!

I wanted the TV delivered on Saturday, but last minute they changed an forced it to be Monday. They came in, filthied up my new wood floors, put the TV down (screen side down even though I protested) on my couch to install the base, were below par and very quick to 'get to the next delivery'. I refused to sign anything about the product until I plugged it in, checked it out, etc. (so much for the required 'white glove service'). The TV was defective, but they refused to take it back because the TV was already opened and they said I'd have to call amazon and deal with the problem with them.The TV I rec'd had an entire column of pixels 'stuck' bright yellow about 3\" from the left edge of the TV.

The next day I got a call from the rude/PITA routing person of the new delivery company about how it was a delivery, not a swap, but she wanted me to go back and take care of it. I had the communications with Amazon already and told her I wanted to be CC'd on her communication with Amazon. After some 'tense' discussion where I explained that I wouldn't accept delivery if they weren't taking the old one; she relented and actually CC'd me.The new delivery team came and were very careful with my home, my TV, and were polite and friendly. They set up the TV and went through the basics of operation. They waited for 5 minutes while I got everything set up, turned on, and verified all of the functionality was good.I've been using the new TV for about a week and I've got everything tweaked and tuned the way I like it.

Interestingly, we like this television a lot more.3-D: I'll get this out of the way first. The glasses are not included with the TV, which we found ridiculous, given the price. Amazon periodically runs specials that bundles glasses with the TV (and sometimes a DVD player) for a reduced price, but seriously, Toshiba? This made a bad impression on us from the start, and we cannot speak to the 3-D feature without them.Picture: Picture terrific for 2-D programming. 720p footage looks great on this 1080p screen, standard-definition programming looks equally great and upscales nicely. Colors are vibrant and true-to-life.Sound: The virtual surround-sound system of the television speakers is better than expected. (Note: we have this in a bedroom, so the size of the room may affect this, but it was so realistic at times we've paused what we were watching because we thought the sound was coming from elsewhere in the house.)Remote Control: Intuitive to use, with smartly-placed buttons. Light-up buttons are helpful at night.Menu/Navigation System: Very easy and intuitive (far better than on our Samsung). Navigation is peppy and we didn't have to read the manual to understand nearly all of the features in the menu system. (For instance, we immediately disable that annoying feature that makes everything look like you're watching a soap opera on video, and we found it quickly and easily.) The menus themselves are not slick as they are on our Samsung, but we prefer the non-flashy, easily navigable style. Using the QWERTY keyboard stinks, but that's the same on every non-keyboard device.Ports: Plentiful and well-placed. HDMI ports are conveniently near the bottom of the unit (on our Samsung they're on the top and side, which is inconvenient for shorter cables).Auto-Off: This is a nice bonus power-saving feature. When a peripheral (such as the DVD player or Apple TV) auto-powers off, the TV will also power off after some period of time. (We can't tell you exactly how long, because some of us are in the habit of falling asleep with the TV on.)Wi-Fi: There are some pretty fancy features if you hook the tv up to your network, but how useful they are is questionable - if you've got a wireless network, you've got a better device for web surfing. There are a number of personalizable widgets (and you can set up profiles for each person using the tv), like Yahoo! News and Flickr. However, we found the signal was inconsistent and poky, even when other wireless devices in the same room had no problem. We liked being able to access Netflix and YouTube, but we prefer our Apple TV for both for speed and navigation reasons.Overall, this is a great TV, well worth the price. We far prefer it to our other television, and provided you don't expect it to do everything including wash your dishes, we think you'll be happy with it too.", "Date": "April 22, 2011"}, {"Title": "GREAT TV and GREAT PRICE!", "Author": "Shannonr2479", "ReviewID": "R3RTDS425VZQXV", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I could not have gotten a better tv even if I did pay more!

I really like the permanent screen coating to stop major glare and reflections as well as the auto ambient light sensor to adjust the picture to the current room light conditions not to mention the LED back lighting being automatic also and going on and off when and where needed smooth's out the rough edges that non LED HDTV's have. Just go to Toshiba's website and check out all the specs.  I tried some older movies an both in HD and SD/standard definition and the former HD TV channels (we subscribe to DirecTV) all come in 1080p Blu Ray, you heard me, regular HD channels are in Blu Ray, hum, didn't know that was a major feature when I bought this one. PLUS I have watched some really old western movies in the 50's, 60's and 70's that were SD/standard definition and they are crystal clear and many of them are in HD format now, the comparison to the old LCD and Plasma HDTV's is a joke, there is nothing that compares with the quality of this Toshiba.  It is a little time consuming to read the manual and tweak it to your personal settings but well worth it, Wi-Fi allows it to firmware/software anytime on a wireless network, Cat 5 hard wired also, we are on an 802.11N... Netflix is cool too but we are going a step future since the picture is out of this world and upgrading to an HDVR recorder from DirecTV so we can have Cinema Plus (Videos on Demand) since that is FREE with DirecTV and the only cost is the HDVR itself so after the initial investment no more costs for unlimited HD movies that play in Blu Ray.  The sound is a little tinny sounding and not much base so I have read many reviews on many brads of wireless surroun sound (now in the affordable range) on the Vizio VHT510 5.1 Surround Sound Home Theater with Wireless Subwoofer and just bought that here at Amazon and Atlantic Satellite 77305018 2 Speaker Stands for 28 bux. BTW, on the hook up you will need an digital audio cable if your purchase Toshiba LED HDTV and that does not come with the TV or Vizio sound system. The Vizio surroun sound also has white and red RCA jacks for input) My wife and I are tired of big bulky speakers and wires all over the place and this Vizio 5.1 surround sound speaker system and with the wireless woofer the two rear satellite speakers hard wired to the woofer, not to the sound bar with 20 foot cords thus no messy wiring through the room, along the wall base etc. I read other reviews on the teeter totter concept of the Toshiba HDTV falling over, if you have kids you will have to anchor it to a wall just to be safe, kids have accidents as we all know but if your home is an adult only environment I would not be concerned with a wall anchor, it really isn't needed.  3D will knock your socks off too....... We bought the Legend of the Guardians-Owls of Ga'hoole Movie to test out 3D and parts of the movie were floating in the living room, it was awesome to see feathers and rain drops so close that you are just waiting to get wet. ESPN experimented 2010 with the college football games in 3D so a very broad use of 3D on regular programing will increase since 3D is the current trend for entertainment.  We bought ours for $1,599.00 and got two free pair of 3D glasses, OH, and the 3D glasses are adult size and we wear eyeglasses and the Toshiba glasses fit over our prescription eyewear with room to spare. And you don't have to be a tech guru to set up the TV, if you can read and follow step by step you won't have very many, if any, frustrating moments. There are so many good things on the Toshiba and I know I have forgotten a lot of them but it is the best money I have ever spent on video/home entertainment... Oh, one more thing I remembered, Amazon delivers this as a \"White Glove\" delivery, yepper's inside the house to the location the HDTV is going to, they unpack it and plug it in to make sure it works before they leave thus no problems from the shipping of the HDTVhttp://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00447GA2W/ref=oss_productUpdate 2-9-11  I received my \"Vizio VHT510 5.1 Surround Sound Home Theater with Wireless Subwoofer (Black)\" Electronics; $298.00 yesterday and I am highly impressed. I hooked it up to my (this HDTV) 55\" Toshiba and it blew me away....... for a very LOW dollar purchase I got an EXTREME sounding surround sound system. This is so easy to hook up and I have had the big high powered and very bulky with wires everywhere surround systems and they can't even hold a candle to this Visio sound bar. I like the 2.4 GHz sub woofer that the satellite speakers plug into...  I purchased the \"Atlantic Satellite 77305018 2 Speaker Stands (Black)\" Electronics; $28.99 and set those on top of my glass end tables (rubber cushions on the three feet the speaker stands sit on) and elevated them 44\" above the end table top they sit on. I also put my sound bar on a 3' was shelf above the Toshiba LED HDTV and the sound is phenomenal.  BTW, you might consider buying a digital audio cable/To slink/Fiber Optic/SPDIF (all those names are the same thing) and hooking it up that way from the LED HDTV because digital optic connections are the clearest and crispest. If you want it to ride free with your Amazon order they are \"AmazonBasics Toslink Digital Audio Optical Cable (6 Feet/1.8 Meters)\" Electronics; $6.29 and you only need one. You can find them cheaper at ebay and places like that but Amazon has their name on this one proving you bought it from them....... BTW  DON'T FORGET to take off the miniature clear plastic caps off BOTH ends before you try to install it, the caps are for protection until the are put into use and you might have a bit of a hassle getting the rubber cap out of the holes if you forget.All in All this is a very good home entertainment package with the Toshiba and Vizio....

I was eagerly awaiting the shipment like a kid at Christmas!  Oddly enough I wasn't even in the market for a new TV.  I was satisfied with my 47 inch LCD, but when I came across this deal on Amazon, I just couldn't resist.  I threw caution to the wind and ordered it.  At first I was going to go with the 46 inch since I live in a small condo and they were offering the 3D Blu Ray player in addition to the 2 pair of 3D glasses.  I'm so happy I decided to go with the 55 inch.  The design is very sleek and stylish and it fits very nicely into my living room.I appreciated that the delivery service (Home Direct USA) was well within the promised delivery window and the delivery men unboxed it for me so that I could inspect it before I signed for it.  Set up didn't take very long at all.  I did notice that this TV is a lot heavier than it looks.  It is super thin and I assumed it wouldn't be that heavy.  Still I managed to get it set up by myself, but I would recommend that TWO people participate in the physical set up of attaching the base.Now onto the good stuff!  I find the picture quality to be amazing, great colors and great detail.  Out of the box it was better than the picture on my 47 inch LCD (which I was happy with before getting this Toshiba).  The 2D picture is crisp and crystal clear and the 3D picture had me feeling like things were literally jumping off the screen into my living room!I briefly listened to the sound of the original speakers before connecting it to my home theater system and while the sound from the original speakers wasn't horrible, I'd much rather have it hooked to the home theater system to complete the \"cinema like\" experience.The TV has some really cool features, though I haven't had a chance to play around with all of them yet.  The wireless set up was quick and works flawlessly.  I like that it has Netflix, Vudu, Blockbuster, Pandora and a few others. I like the fact that it has several Yahoo \"widgets\" (think iPhone/Droid apps) and you can access Facebook and Twitter right from the TV while watching.  It pops up on the side and you can do a quick status update, write a comment, or send a quick Tweet all without having to disturb what you're watching.  Also, the DLNA feature is very cool.  You can wirelessly stream music, video, and photos from your PC to the TV with just a few clicks of the remote!The bottom line is that I think this TV really delivers and simply CANNOT be beat for the price.  It is a great LED TV and the 3D is just an added bonus!  After set up I immediately watched Resident Evil on 3D Blu Ray and then watched Clash of the Titans in 3D through HBO on demand since it was offered by my cable company and the 3D effects on both were top notch.  No ghosting on 3D.  I did notice some slight clouding on the blank screen while waiting for the Blu Ray to load, but this is NOT present when there is a picture on the screen so it doesn't bother me at all like it has apparently bothered some others.

Unfortunately, the screen was shattered. A replacement TV was sent, and I received it on January 12th.The price on the television was fantastic, the TV itself was sleek, and the sound on it was good. We were also able to connect to the internet without a problem. As other reviewers have noted, the television is wobbly when mounted on the stand. We did not use the 3D feature.We weren't happy with any of the preset modes out of the box (AutoView, Standard, Movie1, etc.); the colors just seemed dull. We tweaked the various settings, found some we liked, and during the day, the picture was great. We did notice the flashlights in the four corners of the screen but they didn't detract from the picture at all. Unfortunately, the television went from great during the day to unacceptable at night. At night, clouding during dark scenes was extremely obvious. There were at least six large, distinct clouds on the screen that really did distract us. We tried adjusting backlighting down, switching modes, etc., and nothing really seemed to help. If we turned the backlight down, the picture was just too dark to enjoy.I know some other reviewers have had problems with clouding; some have mentioned that they could get used to it.

Right up there with the Monolithic Sony's. The screen is very glossy and reflective. Only a problem during the day if displayed across from windows.IMAGE QUALITY:I calibrated with DVE, Disney WOW and the built in pattern. The colors really are quite good on the set. The grey, white, and blacks all looked good to my eyes after calibration as well.The picture clarity will vary depending on source. BluRays look very good, DVD's are were also good and FiOS varied greatly depending on channel. I have noticed noise (fuzz) in blacks from all sources.The viewing angles are average for an LCD. They are about the same as the Samsung's and Sony's I've seen, not as good as the LG's and Vizio's I've seen. The picture starts to wash out close to 25 degress from the center.I found the screen to be pretty uniform displaying solid colors with the notable exception of black. This is the biggest problem with this set and Edge-Lit tech in general. The clouding and flashlighting really detract from the viewing experience. These problem are not noticeable on bright scences/colors and less noticeable in a lighted room. I watch most of my TV at night in a dark room and that is when these problems are the worst. Watched the Dark Knight on BluRay, flashlighting was visible for the entire movie, except some imax portions, from all 4 corners. More so from the top then the bottom but still there. Clouding was not much of a problem with this movie. I never noticed any clouds mucking up the dark scenes. However when I watch Sherlock Holmes or Inception on BluRay the clouds were visible in every dark scene and really detracted from my enjoyment. When watching FiOS clouding again is hit and miss. It will show up on some channels with dark content and not on others. Flashlighting will be noticed on anything letterboxed. Both are very noticable when a show breaks for commericials and there is a black screen for a few seconds or if a commercial has a black screen with text. Clouding also seemed to get worse the longer the TV was on and no settings for backlight or brightness could remedy the problem.This set will produce what is called Soap-Opera Effect when 240hz mode is enabled. I rather enjoy this effect for TV viewing and turn it down or off when watching Blu-rays. This set does handle motion processing better than most I have seen. There are few if any artifacts visible even at the highest setting.3D:I have watched IMAX: Under the Sea via FiOS on demand, the PS3 sizzle trailer for the Sony 3D channel, the short from the Monsters vs. Aliens via BluRay. All seemed pretty good to me. I saw only occasional crosstalk/ghosting and some really good depth. I did use the sports preset when watching the 3D content because the glasses really darken the image.The glasses seemed to hold sync very well and I never lost the 3D effect with any of the material. I really think crosstalk/ghosting has more to do with content, delivery, and quality of glasses then the television itself.I found the 3D to be much better than what I experienced on the Sammy c7100.Closing:I am very picky when it comes to TV's. I understand that nothing is perfect but at best this is a average TV. I have seen other sets with much cleaner, clearer pictures. The clouding really makes enjoying this set in a dark environment a chore.The deal on Amazon seems enticing but unless you must have 3D you could probably spend your money better on a different set, 3D or not. LED backlight should probably be avoided if there is no local dimming used reguardless of wether it's edge-lit or full array. Tradition backlighting (CCFL) is cheaper and many produce a better picture than this.

I set it up yesterday. First off, set up is pretty easy, as other reviewers have mentioned. You just slide the stand into the back of the TV, use the included screws and tools to screw it in place, and that's all. It is heavier than it looks, so having two people around may be helpful.The reason I gave the TV four stars is because I noticed significant backlight bleeding in three circular areas on the screen. It wasn't highly noticeable, and was mostly seen when the TV was on with nothing playing. When I played a letterbox-format movie, such as \"The Dark Knight,\" I could not see any backlight bleeding even in very dark scenes. However, when playing \"Superman: The Movie\" from netflix, some of the backlight bleeding was seen.For the value, and the free 3D glasses, this TV is a hard deal to beat. I definitely was impressed by the quality of the image, which rivaled the equivalent samsung model. THe 240 hz clearframe was equally impressive, and gave that documentary-sort of feeling the movies, if you're into that. If not, a few menu options away and 240hz is off.The TV itself also looks gorgeous. If it weren't for the backlight problem, I'd have no problems with the TV. I guess backlight bleeding is variable depending on your TV, so some will have it, some won't. For me, it's not a total dealbreaker, especially on a TV like this.PS: Does anyone know any methods to try and reduce the backlight bleeding?EDIT 2/6/2011So, the clouding on this TV was very, very distracting. To the point where I could not stand watching any dark scene (ex: anything in space) due to the three glaring foglights in my way. I returned this for a replacement WX800, to see if I just got a bad model. The second WX800 came in basically DOA. So, it's going to go back, and I plan on getting a samsung LN55C630 instead. All the benefits of LCD (brightness, negligible burn-in risk, 1080p/24 playback) without the drawbacks of LED (blacklight bleeding). I'll miss the beauty of the WX800's exterior, but the bleeding is just too much. As such, my original 4 star rating is now 3 stars.", "Date": "December 21, 2010"}, {"Title": "Not turning on video.

Other manufacturers will not push out any updates once a product is released. This TV i get firmware updates every few weeks that just enhance the functionality of the TV. The latest one made the Netflix integration flawless, it is not just instant Queue anymore, its the full Netflix interface.At fist when i bought this TV it did take a while to turn on, but they released a firmware fix that cut the boot up time in about 1/2. Its about 6-8 seconds for the picture to turn on then the rest of the Net stuff boots up.The picture of the TV is really good. I had a 50 inch DLP, that i loved, and this blew the colors away.

The spot ghosting has not interfered one bit. If you are looking for flawless you need to spend much more than the 1199 that this TV is selling for.I have played around with the 3D some, i watched Partly Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs and it added quite a bit of depth to the picture but didn't jump out at you. (At 46 inches you cant expect the picture to jump out at you like it does at the large theater). There was minor 3D ghosting, but tutorials in this review chain can help fix it quite a bit. The best thing about the 3D was playing Killzone3 on the PS3, it adds another element of game play that just brings out the game even more.All in all for the money, this is the best tv to buy, it's not perfect but its not 5 grand either.

Shaffer", "ReviewID": "R3Q8SG4MSBSQBW", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "To sum it up, the value of this TV is extremely high. It is the best TV I've ever owned. The picture is vibrant and clear, even with fast motion. The internet applications work well and are easy to set up, and Toshiba issues \"over the network\" software updates for the TV periodically.I got this set because I was dissatisfied with an LG 50\" Plasma. I ended up using my TV quite a bit for my HTPC and watching online videos with static images overlaid on the screen. After experiencing a lot of image retention on the plasma, I took it back to the store. Additionally, the plasma screen gave off too much glare, but more on that later.Picture Quality: I didn't buy the 3D glasses because I don't care much about 3d. The 2D picture quality of this set is superb, however. I am comparing it to my old DLP 720p 52\" and my 50\" 1080P plasma. Where the DLP and the plasma were fuzzy on the edges, this set is crisp and clear. The colors are fully adjustable, and the backlight can be turned up and down. When it is the whole way up it's pretty hard on your eyes, but there is a huge adjustment range.Screen Glare: A lot of people are complaining about screen glare, and this was my biggest concern. I have the TV in the front room of my house that has a huge picture window with sheer white curtains over it. The TV is fine in the middle of the day and at night in this room. During the day, there is some reflection in black areas, but the anti-reflective coating seems to take the edge off. Where on the plasma it was very distracting, on this set it is noticeable but easy to ignore. In comparison to a matte screen Samsung we have, the Samsung still gives off glare, you just can't see a reflection in it. In my opinion that is still just as distracting as the glare off this TV.Light bleeding: There are some patchy areas of lighter black on an all black screen, but they are absolutely not noticeable when there is anything at all showing on the screen. There is nothing bleeding through on the corners.Network Features: Netflix works and the wireless took only a minute to set up. I wish it supported Hulu, but that is probably Hulu's doing, not Toshiba's.Video Games: zOMG! I've played call of duty on all three sets extensively and this one blows them all out of the water, hands down. I can see everything that is going on at all times. The contrast is super crisp. The graphics look incredible on this set, way over the plasma and the DLP. It is a top notch experience.Sound: The sound is totally fine. So far, I have been watching the Tour de France on it, which doesn't require much in the sound department. As with any ultra-thin TV, though, if you want awesome sound, you'll have to buy an awesome system to supplement the TV. I doubt I will, because I think the speakers are quite good.Summary: This is a great TV. I got it from Amazon Warehouse Deals, and Toshiba honored the original warranty when I sent them the receipt. I will say that other people seem to be complaining of some quality control problems, which there are no accounting for. Buying from Warehouse Deals ensured that Amazon inspected the TV for full functionality before shipping it to me. As for the price/value, I don't think I would have bought this one at the new price of $1500. I got it for $835, in a \"very good\" condition and I think that is an absolute steal.", "Date": "July 14, 2011"}, {"Title": "A fantastic LED TV at a great price - So great, I bought two!", "Author": "Natick Dan \"Natick Dan\"", "ReviewID": "R3D1TO6BZNMNX", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I purchased the 55\" model last winter after my Sony HDTV stopped working.

The connection to my wireless internet was very smooth and always keeps a strong connection, of course, it helps when you spend more than $100 on a wireless router and have excellent speed from your service provider.  The picture quality is absolutely beautiful, even on channels that are not in HD.  You can customize of course your picture settings but I find that the 'AutoView' setting is perfect!

I jumped at the deal, and after a week of use I am pretty happy I did.  I don't get HD cable so this review will not be based on that, but I do own an Xbox 360 and a PS3, both of which come out looking absolutely beautiful. In addition to this, I have also connected my PC via dvi-to-hdmi, and the results are like-wise very pleasing to me.  I should state now that every visual device in my home suffers from slight to almost severe backlight bleed, so the backlight bleed on this set doesn't really bother me so much.  I've tried my darndest to look for it during darker scenes of blu-ray movies, and I simply cannot be made to feel distracted by it.  Even during pitch black (relatively speaking of course) loading screens the led lights are visible but again I cannot be made to be bothered by them.  Upon popping in my second movie I thought I had an excessive back light problem before I realized I was watching Star Trek and all the crazy lights were the result of excessive lens flare.I downloaded some 3D content off of PSNetwork to examine this feature and was immediately blown away.  Of the 3D content I have thus far viewed, I could detect no cross talk and the depth of field is simply amazing.  The one game that I previewed and ultimately purchased is called Super Stardust HD, and the title screen alone takes my breath away everytime I boot it up.  On the issue of the screen being too reflective, my home can be enveloped by total darkness within seconds, so this is not an issue for me although I would see how this could become an issue for people who live in homes where the light cannot easily be blocked out.  I had no problems viewing this set with my house lights on for what that's worth.As far as this set's negative aspects, this TV does take quite a bit longer than my old Sony to start up, and the wifi is painfully weak.All in all, I can't believe the value I am currently receiving from this set.  I went from thinking of 3D as a silly gimmick to \"OMG pieces of my destroyed space ship are flying right into my face!\"A word or two concerning the included stand:  it swivels 30 degrees each way and the set is a tiny bit wobbly upon swiveling but not so much that I'd ever worry about it.  I am actually quite pleased about the stand as well.With the 2 free 3D glasses and 3d Blu ray player deal at only 1500, this set is a definite steal.

After getting interested at a local Best Buy, but after dealing with their frustrating customer service, I went home upset on a Monday night about not being able to get this Samsung Bundle they had just advertised on Sunday. The next morning, Amazon read my mind and had a Toshiba bundle that was actually cheaper. I got \"permission\" from the wife and ordered it. Not Amazon's fault but the delivery service was horrible (another review at Pilot delivery).Quick and easy version after giving the background:1- Easy to set up. Updated firmware easily. Netflix immediately.2- 3D BluRay looked good. After researching and testing at various electronic/consumer stores, it is comparable to all other brands. I guess depends on the movie and the scenes for different 3D experiences. I watched Avatar and Legends of the Guardian.3- DirecTV 3D channels looked better than the movie, WAY better. ESPN 3D was almost like being there.***BUT HERE IS MY MAJOR PROBLEM WITH THE TV. The DirecTV remote signal is MOSTLY blocked by the frequency the tv emits to the 3D glasses. I believe this is a DirecTV issue because they only support a few 3D tv brands. To avoid this, you have to either cut off 3D mode or walk close to the tv away from the sensor and hit the buttons.4- I was SHOCKED at the sound quality especially considering the size of the speakers. 4 out of 5 stars which is good for me.5- Glasses are bulky, but no big deal to me. In 10 years, when they have the non-glasses 3D tv's, I will be in need of new tv's anyways.6- Non 3D television is of course 1080p and crystal clear.Overall, great product after 30 days.", "Date": "April 17, 2011"}, {"Title": "Great TV, but buy another Blu ray player if you get the bundle", "Author": "CordlessTaco \"S\"", "ReviewID": "R2OI4LD07DX8XO", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Beautifully sleek looking design, nice futuristic sensor buttons, and great picture.

I was a bit leery of purchasing the TV at first as there are no real \"reputable\" reviews about the TV online and it appeared to be a \"to good to be true\" based on the price and compared to other TV's with it's features.However, I did do a bit of research on Toshiba and the technology and components that were used in the making the TV and they are certainly sound.  The reviews on Amazon helped as well; thus, I felt comfortable with the TV as I wanted a LED with some web functionality and 3d functionality.  The packaging of the 3d player and glasses were just a bonus in my opinion.Positives:  a) a good feature and menu base b) good build quality (looks outstanding - very thin) c) The internet functionality I was looking for.  d)  The sound quality is real nice for a thin tv - it even has dolby settings and so forth (very nice).  e) And the most important - picture quality looks great in both 2d and 3d (btw the 3d movies look awesome - what an experience.  The only negative is your eyes can get a bit tired viewing 3d too long).  Also, I have seen no real ghosting issues as other reviewers have noted.Negatives:  The only complaint I have with the TV is the automatic mode for picture adjustment does not work as well as I would like (always too dim).  I do not see that as a real issue though, as the TV will self adjust itself to 3d, game-mode or standard mode depending on what is viewing viewing.In summary, I would highly recommend this version of the 46\" TV.

I had been researching TVs for months last year in 2010, comparing online and in stores.  Our family wanted something new for the living room and bigger than our 32\" Samsung which is pretty small by comparison. We also wanted a TV with higher contrast ratio and higher Hz something between 120 and 240 Hz. Also, 1080p which our other TV sets didn't have.  In 2010 when this 3D TV craze erupted from the arrival of 3D movies in theaters, we then wanted to explore more options than just an HD TV. However that thought changed when we saw outlandish prices not just for the TV but also for 3D glasses which are 150 a pop, high speed HDMI(For high signal and bandwidth speed without loss of quality which is different than standard HDMI)and of course a source that will read 3D content. This was ridiculous, if anything I was going to spend more just for adding 3D to the picture. We did eye a particular Samsung Model that caught our attention. This LCD model had 240Hz refresh rate, 1080p, 2,000,000:1 contrast ratio, 46 inch. We thought we found a perfect model but it was still going to end up over 2 grand with the warranty and extra equipment. Before giving up hope I came to see an ad for a Toshiba 46\" LED 3D TV set. I saw all its features and was amazed at how something just came out of the blue and dangled before my very eyes.  It was 46\" which was perfect for our living room; 240 Hz refresh rate, 1080p, and 7,000,000:1 contrast ratio and it was 100 dollars less than the LCD and a pair of 3D glasses/ 3D BD player bundle was just the icing on the cake. I was completely blown away that I had found and LED not LCD and thought there was no way this was real. I read most of the reviews and was worried about some of the things the reviewers mentioned about the TV. Such as bleeding, sound issues, brightness, ghosting etc.  Willing to take my chances, I pressed the \"Add to Cart\" button with the 3 year warranty from square trade, set my home address, shipping method, payment option, and placed order. The BD player and glasses came within a few days.  The TV took about 12 days, I had to call amazon after the period of arrival was over and they gave me the number of a local company that did the deliveries in my city; to set up a delivery. Putting that aside the TV came the next day after that phone call. We opened it and followed the instructions to setup the TV Stand to combine it with the TV. It was a little daunting because the instructions just had pictures and you kind of had to look at the part names and match them with what came in the box. After 20 minutes we put all the screws in place everything came together and we lifted the TV on to our old TV entertainment center. We hooked the HDMI cables with our cable box and our new Blue ray player, turned on the TV. I setup the configuration with its software and at first we didn't have any channels until I switched the input on the remote to the one for the cable box and voila it worked. The 240 Hz when turned on made everything look much clearer and sharper. My eyes were fully immersed and mesmerized by the clarity in the picture. The 240 Hz made it look almost as if you are right there in the middle of the action while never leaving your seat. Some movies that I saw many years ago actually were enhanced on an insane magnitude.  Take something like Aliens and you will see this movie in a whole new perspective. I couldn't see the graininess that I used to see when I watched it on my older TV. When Ripley came on to the screen it looked almost as if she was right here talking with you or me. Everything from the ships moving in space to the Necromorphs first encounter makes it look so vivid. I felt as if this was a whole new movie. This was just DVD and I can only imagine how much better it will look in Blue Ray. The settings for the brightness can be adjusted we prefer using Sports it just looks better that way. The resolution can also be magnified to wherever you desire. You can turn off the 240 Hz True motion if you don't like it. It's always good to have an option. This TV is Wi-Fi compatible and has applications like Netflix, VUDU Movies, Blockbuster, YouTube, and Pandora. We haven't really used most of these features except for maybe Netflix which we use quite often and VUDU which we already got two free movie rentals on two other devices making this our third. As for the 3D, it took me a while to figure out for video games, but for movies it picked up right away. I bought Resident Evil Afterlife, put on my glasses and it looked every way it did when I first saw it in theatre last September if not better. For videogames, I'm not sure why but I had to tinker with the settings in the game first before it worked but Gran Turismo 5 looked so sweet drifting in the hard rain or pulling a sharp turn in the snow. COD BO was even more breathtaking. I could not believe how different this game is compared over 2D. More so because I was playing it on the Xbox 360, yes it works on here too, which is something a fellow BestBuy employee told me didn't work for 360; only for PS3. Believe me when someone is trying to sell you something they will tell you something on either bias input or lies just to get you to give in. The only downside on my experience is that this TV is very shiny and light will bounce off depending on the arrangements such as if its near windows, it all depends where your TV is and it's not entirely bothersome. I didn't notice any bleeding like some of the reviews mentioned or audio problems. I think the audio is perfect and can get quite loud almost eliminate me ever thinking of buying home theatre audio speakers. I did see a little bit of ghosting like if the movie is trying hard to keep up, but it only happens for maybe a millisecond and it's not frequently. Overall this TV has exceeded me and my family's expectations. It makes great movies better, crappy movies endurable, gaming at its purest form of high definition quality and of course 3D which has yet to scratch the surface and has just begun a new era of how we will enjoy movies at home.

You can sear your eyeballs if you want to.  LED televisions are incredible when it comes to vivid color reproduction, and this one is no exception.  The colors seriously pop.  Energetic action scenes in movies are crisp and (if you want) painfully vivid.  Brightly lit scenes from HD sources look fantastic.  Walks on beaches, nature documentaries, these look great.  When you are in a brightly lit room, it takes some horsepower to make the visuals this engaging.2.)Incredibly thin and light.  Doesn't really matter to me because I was mounting it on a media center, but if it's a consideration for you, I don't see how they can make 'em much thinner/lighter than this.  The form factor extends to using the various inputs: it's easy to swivel and access the slots.3.)Built-in WIFI with some neat apps: cool.4.)Motion-blurring: I didn't notice this, and I usually pick it up when gaming on last-gen LCD screens.  Keep in mind that \"LED\" refers to the lighting process.  \"LED\" televisions are LCD screens that are lit by LEDs rather than fluorescent lights.CONS:1.)How anyone .... ANYONE .... can review this product and not mention the horrific back-light and edge-light bleeding is shocking.  I can only assume that the quality control is abysmal and that some sets have tiny little purplish areas at the extreme edges, and that some (like mine) have gigantic purple/blue splotches (kind of looks like fog) not only at the edges, but throughout the center of the screen.  It's definitely worse in the corners, but the weird purple splotches are noticeable all over the screen whenever a dark scene is shown.It's incredibly distracting during dark scenes of movies, particularly in images set in space or during nighttime. Unacceptable.  This, more than everything else combined, is why I returned it.2.) 3D.  First, let me say this: I thought it was my imagination that the 3D looked worse during the initial stages of watching a movie.  When researching on-line to see if I had a broken set, I noticed a few articles that said LCD/LED televisions need to \"warm up\" for a while.  I think this is true.  Until the set \"warmed up\" for about 20 minutes, the crosstalk and ghosting (double images) was horrific.  As in, could-not-watch-it bad.  After a while, either I got used to it, or the T.V. \"warmed up\" and it became acceptable.  But still, it wasn't as impressive as other sets I've seen.  I'm not so sure that LCD/LED technology has a quick enough response time at the moment to eliminate crosstalk for fast moving or intense scenes.  If 3D is your thing and you aren't viewing in a brightly lit room, get a plasma or DLP.Also, the lack of a 2D-3D conversion feature is a HUGE negative.  Yeah, converting doesn't work well for everything, but for quite a few movies and for most games it DOES work as intended.  Given the lack of native 3D content the absence of such a feature is a major disappointment.3.) All of the \"enhanced\" cinema modes.  The 240 hz. plus and other frame-increasing tricks make the movies look like garbage.  Turn them all off and movies will look much better.  The set also lacks (as far as I could tell) a true cinema \"pull-down\" ability.  That's a bit of a buzzkill.  Excessive imaging processing, AND the inability to watch movies in a true cinema mode?

So I do think my unit is defective but one flag I believe this raises is the reliability of this toshiba TV - having very severe issues within days of ownership. When I asked amazon if there were other people who returned the unit for similar issuse, the representative wouldn't comment on it. Hence, I just wanted to put this out there and if there are others that have experienced this problem with the unit?Let me comment on TV features when it doesn't just black out on me -- at first image quality seemed exceptional. However there is clouding in the TV. If you have some lights on, then it is not as noticeable. I seem to like the \"standard\" picture mode the best (AUTOVIEW was the worst - seems very bland color and is too dark - Movie 1/Movie2 was also non-vivid color - it is as Toshiba had these darker modes to make the picture seem \"clearer\" because you don't see artifacts as much, but the darkness made the TV seem non-bright and bland, lifeless color.) To those that are commenting on its excellent picture quality, what settings are you using? Are you using standard picture mode, or Autoview/Movie1/Movie2?Lastly I was still playing around with the 240hz feature but i dont seem to notice much difference when it's on or off, but when it is on, the picture seems clearer. I do feel like there might be a soap opera effect going on as watching Step Up 3, it felt like amateur video. But when I turned off the clear 240hz setting, it still felt like amateur video and not a film.. so not sure what's the deal here.So I am waiting for an exchange to see if the new tv would be any better but again the severe issues out of the box make me question the reliability of the toshiba brand over top players like samsung which i had originally considered.", "Date": "January 1, 2011"}, {"Title": "Clear beautiful picture!", "Author": "Mr. Patrick E.

I've been around for this video game ride from atari, colecovision, sega, nintendo, sony, and microsoft. My first HD television was a 52\" Mitsubishi DLP (720p/1080i) which was bought in 2005 only one month prior to the release of the Xbox 360. My experience with HD televisions started back then. In 2009 I upgraded to a 42\" Lg LCD (1080p 240hz) which I enjoyed much more than my DLP. After two years of constant gaming on my 42\" Lg LCD I figured that games couldn't possibly show any more crisp and clear than what I was currently seeing... Boy was I wrong... Once I received my 46WX800U I didn't think that my standard 2D picture would look any better than my Lg LCD. Well after I hooked up both my xbox 360 & my PS3 I was blown away with the clarity, sound, and color in this television. The sound, clarity, and color was superior to my two pervious HDTV's. Now on to the 3D image. The Xbox 360 & the PS3 are capable of delivering 3D gaming but I must admit that Sony and the PS3 does a much better job with the 3D gaming. I love my xbox but they must improve on their hardware on the next system. The PS3 also plays 3D Blurays. I was fortunate enough to get this set for $899.99 with four, yes I repeat four pair of toshiba active 3D glasses for free. This was the week before Thanksgiving and Black Friday. This was by far the most excellent choice of all the higher end 3D HDTV's that I previewed. The complaints about \"ghosting\" while watching 3D movies are not as bad as some reviews I've read. Make sure that you get compatible HDMI cables. (Check \"Acoustic Research PR385\") Overall this 3D tv matches up with the best of the best...

To get the TV To a point where I wanted to keep it in my living room, it took quite a bit of messing with the options. I have not seen any of the ghosting that some of the pictures posted here display even when the TV is very warm.PROS:-The television's picture with regard to color is right up there with the local pixel dimming TVs that are out now. The blacks are obviously not as black as the newer TVs but this is known when buying an edge lit LED. It does take some tweaking to release this color however.-Control over HDMI works flawlessly for the PS3 so no separate remote is needed for the PS3.- In general 3D looks amazing. I have noticed that the TV must warm up for the parallax to appear correctly.CONS:-Out of the box, the picture(color) is washed out and color must be bumped up by about 20 or so.-Other than live sports, the image stabilization and 240hz clear frame settings seem to have no use as they make everything look way fast and not in a good way.-3D - negative parallax looks amazing. I have yet to see any positive parallax that looks any good. discouraging but a lot of home 3D movies don't use much positive parallax so it is really not that big of a deal.-Every so often the television resets my picture settings. This is by far the worst problem the TV has, and I have no idea what causes it.-Net TV is useless as the processor in the television is not robust causing the UI to lag and be near unusable.

( and currently if you look you cannot buy this TV due to them looking into why the damage occurred, makes me like Amazon all the more. )I set this TV up, no real instructions on how to set the stand up, no big deal there's 5 small screws and 4 big ones, do the math and it was easy.

Its the first LED TV I've ever owned.  It's also the first 3D TV I've ever owned.  The deal I got for this TV (plus glasses and bluray player) was incredible so I honestly cannot complain about anything when compared to what I paid for it.  But if you are buying this TV without the same deal I did, here's my review on it as a product.There's nothing really wrong with the sound quality, but I feel like the TV is quiet.  Maybe its just the room I'm in (I live in an apartment in the middle of a busy city).  But I'm used to turning the TV a quarter of the way up and having that be more than loud enough (if not too loud).  This TV goes all the way up to Volume 100 (as far as I can tell), and I commonly have to turn it to Volume 40 - 50 when watching a movie or sporting game to get the full volume of sound that I like to get.  I'm definitely going to be buying an after market home theater system for better/louder sound.The picture \"quality\" is fantastic.  I watched Tron 3D on this thing and man, full 1080p on a 55\" screen... this thing pops.  It really only a step below being in a movie theater in my opinion.  It was truly a beautiful picture.  But there are some downsides of the display.  It's an uber glossy display and I do run into trouble with glares.  You cannot have any sort of lighting directly behind you or within the viewing angles of the display when looking at this screen, or you will see the light clear as day on the display glaring over your picture.As for build, this thing is soooo thin!  It's deceiving because it is actually decently heavy even though it seems there's not much too it.  The stand allows for good rotation, but in my opinion, it is a bit low and I wish was either a bit taller or had adjustable heights.  I had to do some adjusting to get it to fit right in my entertainment center due to this.  Again this is a personal preference, not really a knock on the TV overall.I wont really comment on the 3D effect since one, I've only watched one thing in 3D on this, and two, I'm not a big fan of 3D to begin with.  The only reason I went with a 3D TV is because I got this for a deal better than I would have gotten for a non 3D LED TV.Overall, this is in fact a great TV.

Later when I shut off the TV and run it on for quite sometime, it turns on an off intermittently after about 2min and 30secs. Then it turn automatically turn on and off again. It really annoyed us. So I called Toshiba customer support for a few times and they called me back saying that their server sometimes causes the downloading of firmware due to signal in the network from Toshiba server.They asked me to re-update using flash drive downloaded from their website but it does'nt work. I was already exhausted but I did not loss my hope. They called me back and said they are going to replaced the main system board because the board firmware was already corrupted. The board arrived sent by UPS and fixed by the authorized service center and the problem is gone.I shipped the TV to the Philippines before the TV was viewed and energized for viewing and I thought Toshiba is not going to support me since it is clear in the warranty that it will not be valid anymore. The customer support did well to back me up and they shipped by UPS the system board. They did this to the customer as a merit of kindness and understanding.Finally, the system works great. I played the 3D using the 4 x 3D active glasses as well as the Panasonic DMT-BDT110P 3D bluray player with my Onkyo TX-NR609 7.2ch AV receiver and my AV home theater works very well. The video and resolution was amazing and my children and my wife were amazed on the picture it is superb. I updated the firmware also for my 3D bluray player download from panasonic website and copy on the CD. The onkyo firmware was also updated. One thing I was surprised, when the tech opened the back cover of my TV, the LCD panel is made by 55\" LCD LED backlit by Samsung.There were only 3 PCBs mounted at the back. The power supply board, the board in the middle which I don't know what it is for and the left side is the system board where all the controls, functions, and the system are process and all the inputs and outputs i.e USB, HDMIs, RS232, SD card, antenae ports, composite video, etc are located. I had pictures at the back of the TV but I do not know how to upload on this thread.I will still maintain my 5star rating for this TV since the Toshiba had considered supporting me by shipping the system board free of charge even it is out of warranty since I brought it outside the USA. BTW, the firmware before the shipped the board was already updated to the very latest version. It was the fault of the signal from their server or the network during the download process to my TV.

The only real problem ive had with this purchase is the free blueray player as it constantly just freezes freezez all the time. Thats probably why they threw it in as a package deal.", "Date": "May 17, 2011"}, {"Title": "Toshiba 46\" 1080p 3D, Cinema, HDTV", "Author": "DebFed", "ReviewID": "R2TDA8QW2OF1T3", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I love my TV it's the best and so is the price.

DLNA is easy to set-up but the supported formats are not what you would expect today (no flash/XviD/DivX). Plan to buy a PS3 to have a real media renderer. There are tons of settings for video and audio, which I didn't explore to the fullest, but I believe they should satisfy the vast majority of users.As mentioned in other reviews, there is a clouding effect, particularly visible in almost all black scenes and a dark room, but I didn't find it that annoying, since its occurrence is limited to few scenes.

However, the sound is - not so much.  I'm sure you'll want to add a good audio system.  The 3D glasses are not rechargeable, but use lithium button batteries with an expected life of up to 75 hours.  It is thin, but the instructions say to keep it at least 4 inches from the wall for cooling, so it's not exactly \"wall-hugging\".  The company's customer support is so terrible as to be non-existent.  I tried to contact them on another product.  No matter what I tried, all I got was an electronic run-around until, although I just got it, the recording said that \"the warranty may have expired,\" and it hung up.  I finally got a real person in sales, but she seemed not at all interested in being helpful, and just put me back into the electronic merry-go-round.  For this reason, I doubt that I would consider buying another Toshiba product.Update:  On first review, I had not tried adjusting the sound with the equalizer.  With some adjusting, the sound can be significantly improved over the default setting, to where it is quite passable.  Of course, it is still not theater quality.  I have had no problems with this TV.  One bug:  no headphone outlet, so if I want to watch without disturbing others, no luck.  In fact, the only sound output is digital optical, which is fine only if you plan to add a full theater surround sound system.", "Date": "April 12, 2011"}, {"Title": "Amazing deal for the Price!!!!", "Author": "Mike at Tampa", "ReviewID": "R2THXN8ETT3QJ0", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I bought this item already aware of the issues other people had about the \"bleeding and clouding\" effects resulting from the backlighting feature of this LED product.I must say that at this point, for the price, and including a Blu Ray Player and 2 Active Glasses I could not expect nothing better. I must say I am happy with it.The weird effect can be reduced by moving the backlighting feature indicator until achieving the least of that effect (it is always perceptibe though).The quality of images is superb. Makes my heart beat every frame of the  movie.It is the most affordable start-up kit for the 3D experience. Besides, the fact that you can connect Internet wireless without having to buy a separate adapter or anything like it.You can view the titles and watch the movies that you have out on your netflix instant queue (I have not tried other features yet).Very modern and surprising design, sleek and glossy finish gives it a futuristic appeal.Most of the connections are done through HDMI so if you have a player or any other auxiliary that does not support HDMI you might need to get adapters.

I expected Jaws 3D hokey...but I have been pleasantly surprised.  I think that they should change the terminology, because those of us who have been around long enough to have experienced the red and green glasses are generally uninterested in experiencing anything like that again.

I am completely and utterly blown away.I might also mention the the set in 2D is equally impressive.

All the settings and colors are superb.  The 3d is amazing on this tv.  Im using a ps3 with a 1.4 hdmi cable with ethernet and audio return.  The cool thing is that the ps3 is regza link compatible, so you can control your ps3 (netflix, menus, etc, right from your tv remote).  I have a hd antenna on my roof and the 1080i signal looks great in HD.  You can get pretty good soap opera effect with 240hz on if you want( which we love).  Playing killzone in 3d and watching my favorite 3d movies( tahiti wave 3d, and open season looked perfect, no ghosting or cross talk, it really is amazing.  The only problem I have is when your changing channels or you get a really dark screen, you can see some white blotches in the black screen.  It is so hard to notice and you only really see them when room is dark and backlight is way up.  For the price, with free glasses, this has to be the best 3d tv value for size and options.  I hardly notice the white in the black screen, and when your in game mode playing ps3 you dont see any flaws at all.  The tv is super slim and light, and I think the sound is great even thoe I use 7.1 surround.  My wife likes just the tv sound quiet at night and it is very clear.  The free glasses work perfect as well.  Also try the firmware update on Toshiba's website, it helped with the ghosting a little bit. I would have rated 5 stars if the ghosting issue was fixed! BTW I am sitting about 8 feet away in a small living room, and the WiFi works fine.  Pandora locked up on me a couple times and netflix works way better through ps3, but vudu worked really good.  the network feature works ok with pictures but I couldn't get video to stream.  ps3 works better as well here, but its a cool feature lots of room for new widgets I would think.  Game mode looks great and switches automatically when ps3 is on.  I usually use autoview or standard, but sports look better on sports, makes tv setting very bright.  The stand is a little wobbly but I will be mounting on the wall anyway, very thin and light.  I was using a Hitachi 65 inch HD 1080i crt big screen, and its a complete night and day difference.  I almost returned it for a Samsung plasma but I read bad reviews there too, about buzzing and much thicker, being in my small room I think the led would look better on the wall.

TV in action, here are the scene descriptions:-First you see a pan of the TV as it is installed.-Next you see me demonstrating the swivel of the TV.-Next you see the back panel of the TV, and all of the connectors.-Next you see me using the touch controls to turn it on, and then waiting for it to boot (I cut about 10-14 seconds out of the wait time from the video, just because it is boring to watch) -- and then using the touch controls to lower the volume, and then turn the set back off-Next you see the main menu view of a DVD (Sliders) running on a DVD player via HDMI connection.  No noticable screen artifacts or dimming or bright spots.-Finally, you see me pull up the TV's menu, and I go through all of the option screens.Overall, I have a good impression of the TV:We watched the movie \"Avatar\" in 3D (after getting a set of the 3D glasses, and a blu-ray player that supported 3D over HDMI), and we all loved it.  It looked fantastic.  We like the auto-select and play feature where if an HDMI-controlled device is played, the TV automatically switches over to its input channel AND it will auto-adjust the picture aspect ratio to the native format of the media.  So, if you put in a 4:3 DVD, the screen will snap to the input for the player, and reformat to 4:3 letter-boxed mode.  Not too shabby at all.My only complaints:I am not at all a fan of their \"Color Stream\" connection dongle you have to use for the one (and only one) component video connection.  You can see in the video all of the component cables hooked to their \"Color Stream\" dongle, which then feeds into a single 3.5mm socket.  You must do the same for the audio output from the device as well, to a separate audio dongle.  I fail to see the point of it, and it means if we ever lose or damage the dongle we are either out of luck, or have to order a new one (at insane prices, I am sure).I was also bummed out to find out that DirecTV doesn't support the Toshiba brand of TVs for their 3D channels.  I am sure they will get around to supporting them at some point, but for right now, if you are a DirecTV customer, and you want to access their 3D channels ... you may want to wait, or look at a different, supported, brand.I also don't think the picture is quite as clear as plasma tends to be.  But, holy cow, I am a HUGE fan of how much LIGHTER this set is, in comparison to the last plasma set!Overall, it is a 1080p \"HD\" TV, at a whopping 55 inches, running at a 240 Hertz refresh rate (smooth, and synced with the same count as the frame rate) which meshes nicely with the standard \"cinematic\" 24 frames/second playback rate.  For the Amazon price of this set, it is a good deal.  We paid about $3200 for a 42 inch plasma about 5-6 years ago, and now for about half the price we have a 55 inch LCD that does 3D!A decent value, for a decent price.  4 stars.[Curriculum Vitae: Bachelor of Science, Computer Science with a Minor in Security and Forensics.

Eriksen", "ReviewID": "R3B8FRHRAVSOP5", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Amazon is hands-down, the best place to find great deals. This TV is no exception.I suspect the reason for the price decrease is due to the lighting issues that occur during pitch black scenes in films / games. If this is true then anyone who knows how to tweak a TV's video settings will realize what a steal this TV package is! I was able to completely reduce the lighting issue (compared to the pictures shown at the top of the product page here it's completely gone!).  Seriously if anyone is disappointed by this aspect of the TV don't let it steer you away, it is fixable!Overall look: wonderful black / silver bezel lines the edges of the tv.  It's extremely thin which seems to cut out the ability to have a complete component hook up however it comes with the extensions for non-HD hardware such as The Wii.  Everything else is as expected as far as output goes (see product listing for other ports).Set up: easy.  Just a few screws for the base and it's ready to go.  Make sure you do the software update as the wireless set up seems to be broken until you do. Afterwards everything runs flawlessly and is very intuitive to investigate various settings.Options: I'm a huge gadget / technology fanatic and I'm very pleased with the amount of options this TV has.  Everything from 240hz for gaming and 3D to internet widgets like Netflix and Vudu (although no 3D movies for some reason here despite Vudu releasing it earlier last month on it's service.  It definitely exists as I have a PS3 that has Vudu and it has a list of 3D movies ready to rent.) It also has a few other things such as weather, news and Facebook.  Nothing I'd probably seriously use but fun features to play around with.Picture: It's gorgeous.  2D and 3D amaze me equally and set up of either is a breeze as it automatically converts from 2D to 3D when playing 3D media then back to 2D when not. Speaking of 3D, The PS3 has some stellar options that shine on this TV.  I played Wipeout HD, Tumble, Auditorium and Super Stardust HD.  All looked great with some having that lovely fly-at-your-face visual effect at some points. If you're a gamer, this adds a wonderful aspect to how you view games! Also, when it comes to playing 3D with or without games make sure game mode is turned off. This disables 3D by default.Sound: It's average, but sounds clear and loud.  With a TV like this you'll want to get surround speakers anyway.There's a lot that I can say about this television but the price alone makes it a great way to get into both the HDTV and 3D realm of technology.  If you're on the fence still there's not much more I can say that will convince you at this point. Buy this before April as it comes with two pairs of 3D glasses and a blu-ray player for free. That's literally almost $300 of free stuff!", "Date": "March 7, 2011"}, {"Title": "This Toshiba is not for me", "Author": "ChivasStrikers", "ReviewID": "R239RFBYCCCGVI", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "First of all, GREAT service from Amazon and the delivery company (Pilot).

WIFI, widgets, image, even Sound is OK. BUT this baby is going back.It has been with me just a couple of days and i am TIRED of all the clouding this thing has. If your room has lots of light you probably wont notice a bit of it, the problem is when all lights are off and/or you want to watch a movie full of dark scenes (Alien anthology, Sherlock Holmes, Star Wars)..  you can only focus on all the clouds on the screen instead of focusing on the movie itself.

Featured and very configurable.I bought this TV as part of a 3D bundle and it definitely has not disappointed me.  It was a good deal, but I was a bit worried after reading some of the reviews because of complaints of \"clouding\".  Since I was upgrading from a 32\" 720p LCD, I figured anything was better.  It blows away my old TV and more.  The design is sleek and the picture quality is great.  Yes there is some minor \"clouding\" when the picture is nearly black (I've also seen this in other LED edge lit televisions I've viewed in the store), but it can be greatly reduced by adjusting the display settings.  And speaking of, there are a plethora of display settings that can be tweaked to get the best picture quality for your viewing preference.  I've spent a great deal of time playing with these settings to find the perfect picture for TV, movies and PS3 games, but it is well worth it so I'd recommend you take the time.The 3D is great with games and movie content.  One thing to note is that 3D content piped out by the PS3 and blu-ray trigger the auto switchover, but some content like my cable service's 3D channel required me to switch over manually.  As with all active-shutter 3D, you'll want to turn up the TV brightness when viewing 3D to compensate for the dimming from the glasses.Other comments... the speakers are as expected pretty weak and you'll definitely want to hook up to external speakers.  The TV display also takes a few second to show when powering up so if you're very impatient this could be a problem.  This TV is geared heavily towards digital devices so be aware if you're like me and your old setup uses the analog audio output, that is not an option with this TV.  Other than that, hooking up to my wireless router was a piece of cake and the Net Apps are nifty, though not that useful to me.  The Netflix app works great, but does not allow you to browse the selection, only allowing you to access your instant queue.I'd definitely purchase this TV again if I had to make the choice.", "Date": "February 23, 2011"}, {"Title": "Toshiba 3D TV", "Author": "Theodore J.

Normally, I will wait until prices come down on newer technology before I jump in, but I decided to treat myself for once a pay a bit more to be an early adopter while knowing the risk of ever-changing technology.My first impression upon opening the box is this baby looks beautiful.  It was easy to put the base on and I had it up and going in under 30 minutes. I immediately checked out the 3D look once I found the 3D channels on DirecTV and was a bit disappointed with the occasional ghosting, although this seems to be a commonality with current 3D.  The glasses are big but we did not find them to be uncomfortable and the comments about their bulk & ugliness (not just with this brand) did not matter - aren't you supposed to be watching TV, not looking at everyone else?  ha!After the initial ooh's & aah's with the TV, I started hooking up other devices.  I was surprised to find the unit only has 2 HDMI connections.  Yes, I should have read more before I purchased it I suppose, but my much cheaper and smaller HP LCD came with 4 HDMI connections and I guess I just assumed that would be a no-brainer for a larger TV. Obviously, if you have a more robust setup, your receiver will have plenty of HDMI hookups and you would only need 1 HDMI connection.  However, I did not have a receiver in the room where I installed this TV.  I managed to get everything working nonetheless, with one huge exception - our Wii simply will not work.  I can get a black & white screen and nothing more.  It worked on the HP, but not on this unit.  This limitation really is the fault of Nintendo, though, and not Toshiba.The other thing I did find pretty quickly was I did not care for the reflective screen. I never thought about the possibility of a screen having one, as my other LCD TVs did not have that type of screen.  Fortunately, the location of the TV kept this from being much of an issue overall, although I would prefer a non-reflective screen.The built-in gadgets work well and setting up the internet connection was easy.  There were a couple of firmware & gadget updates right away, but they did not take very long to install.  I do with the interface for Netflix was a little more robust, but overall it is much better than the interface on the XBOX 360 Netflix app.Last but not least, we did start having some issues about 3.5 weeks of using it. The sound started becoming flaky, as if it was shorting out at random times.  We noticed this on every device we had connected, which eliminated the problem from being one of our other components.  After a couple of days, the problem seemed to resolve itself but showed back up in worse form about a week later.  We had paused our DVR for about 15 minutes and upon starting it again, there was no sound at all.  I checked the mute, volume level, and 2 other devices but nothing had sound.  We turned the unit off and back on, and still the TV was mute.  Our last try was to unplug it from the wall for 30 seconds and try again; fortunately, this seemed to fix the issue but I immediately contacted Amazon.  They replaced the unit within 3 days and the second one has not had any problems thus far.Overally, I am glad I purchased this unit and really enjoy the larger screen and vivid picture.

While it was a slight downgrade in terms of size, my old TV was failing (a known issue with LCoS systems), so I needed something new.  The 46wx800u was a great value replacement and the picture quality is really good.  I find it to be on par with my old Sony (when it was new) and it is much lighter and slimmer obviously.  At a quarter the cost of my old unit, I am very happy.  I haven't as yet tried the 3D, so can't say whether I'm getting the same ghosting issues that other people have reported, but as for 2D quality, I am very pleased.My favorite feature of the 46wx800u is the built-in support for Netflix and Pandora.  While I own both an xbox 360 and a PS3, just being able to do everything through the TV is great (though upgrading the Netflix interface to allow access to shows not in my instant queue would be very nice).  I have also played with the Yahoo Widgets and while I have not quite bought into their usefulness as yet, I am a developer and love the idea that I can create my own and distribute them across multiple television models.My only slight negatives so far about the TV are that it is a little slow and the on-screen keyboard is a little painful to use.

And now there is more than 60. I received mine on Dec 30,a bit longer than anticipated, but it arrive in good shape. So I won't complain on that.Here are my thoughts about this TV.1.  Price : Such a good deal, 1599, and without TAX.  This is the first thing that caught my eye and with 2 free pairs  of 3D glasses.2.  Risk : I took the risk like others to buy this TV, if not good I can return it thanks to Amazon policy.3.  2D Pictures :  My current one is Philips's 42 inch, I still like it, and I tried 47in before and it seems larger  screen has larger pixel that sometimes not HD program will shows square edge, like Text. But I found not very obvious  or none on this 55 in TV.  You can change and control the color and back light, ...etc on the setup to sasify your  needs.  My wife can not sustain very bright screen.  So we tuned it to very low light and not too crispy resolution that she  can watch for longer time.  When I am alone, I tuned it to movie 1 or 2 and the color is beautiful especailly with blue ray. Clouding, not seen it  so far.4.  3D : I don't use 3D and not recommend for other to use it, kids under 6 should not watch 3D because it  will damage their cute little eyes.  Who wants headache after 2 hours wearing uncomfortable glasses.  Plus it has to  put on top of my near sighted one, doesn't that look funny ?5.  Appearance : I like it becuase it's so thin and not too much weight to carry, but you need two people to assemble it  though. The reflection is not a big bother to me as long as there is no direct light beam on the TV. Once you focus  on the shows, the reflection is not there.6.  Network : I spend almost full day try to upgrade the firware on Jan 1st, but failed everytime. It took more than 15  minutes beofre some download error messages showed up. I knew it's either the TV reception is not good enough or the  network is very busy. But on Jan 2nd 7:00 am I did it again. And it was done in 10 minutes.  My router is on 2nd  floor.  So low reception might not be the issue.  I asseum Toshiba might have only one firware file on  one spot and when internet traffice is busy, it will has issue when many people try tp download it.6.  DLNA : A cool feature but so far only USB ports works. I tried to wokr on the DMS and DMC stuff, no luck so far!  Seems can't get it to work.  I might need to download a freeware to setup my computer as a DMS.  Althoug media player  11 claims to have that function, under library ==> share, but I tried and it didn't work!  I saw someone else review  mentioned not bo bother with it since qyality will be poor.  So I will pass on that.7.  NetTV : Very good tool for the TV to get more internet information. I found you need to upgrade the firmware in order  for the Y-tube to work. Before upgraded it, there is alwasy Java script error message showed up.8.  Energy Star: I read some reviews on this TV and it will cost only $28 a year.  What a deal on saving energy ![...]  Well, I like this TV a lot and so is my wife, she is afraid it will be too shinny and big so she won't be albe  to watch 2 hours movie with me.  But she seems to like it so far.  We watched movie every night so far after this  baby arrived.  The bottome line is it's such a bargin that you don't want to let it go.  Samsung & LG, don't bother !  Cost morethan 500~1000 to get this kind of deal.  My experience is Amazon start selling stuffs with low price, and it will keep coming up when they digest the inventory.

I don't know about the channel changing times as I use my Direct TV remote to change channels so I can't give any input on that.This TV is a vast improvement over what I had. From looking at other sets in retail stores over the past year I think it is very good in comparison if not better than the majority of them.  I will attempt to adjust the colors and settings on my set when I get the opportunity, but with only minimal back lighting adjustments I am happy with the picture as is for now.  I only used the built in internet applications for a brief period when I tested the set at my office after delivery, since I couldn't be at home to take delivery, setting up for netflix was easy enough.  I haven't hooked up to my wireless at home yet as I currently use my PS3 for watching netflix as you can only watch whats in your instant que on the TV's netflix application.  I plan to explore these features in the near future.I have not tried the 3D yet, but that was never my primary reason for the purchase.  I find the viewing angle to be very good as my couch and love seat are set at angles to the TV which is in a corner.  The screen is very reflective, but with the lighting arrangement I have it isn't an issue with the TV on.  I plan on adding a brighter light, other than the one nightlight that is behind the cabinet the TV sits on, for watching movies so the room wont be totally dark with the rest of the lights out at night.  I have only used the speakers from the set once and they seemed adequate, but I use my home theater setup so it is another non issue for me.  I took a leap of faith with this purchase since there were no reviews, but the advertised combo deal was just to good to pass up.  I have always had good experiences with past Toshiba TV's and other products which was the other factor in this purchase.  I hope to also have a favorable update after a month of watching on this set.", "Date": "January 2, 2011"}, {"Title": "Nearly Perfect", "Author": "Jian Chen \"kenneth\"", "ReviewID": "R345SHOIHZ182P", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I have been looking for a new big TV for my living room to replace my 5 year old Samsung 32inch LCD TV.

Is it because the success they had for the last few years, and they now charge a premium for their products? Almost nailed down to Samsung UNC55C6300, and then I found this Toshiba LED TV. I compared it side by side with Samsung's models. I need to pay probably $1000 more for similar specifications. Or in another word, with essentially the same price, this Toshiba model beats Samsung UNC55C6300 with better contrast ratios, internet and 3D functionality as well as a pair of 3D glasses.I have been watching this TV for a few days now. It has been an amazing experience. I tried it with Blu Ray, online HD movie, Sports program and PS3 games. The picture is so vivid that for some HD movies, it almost feels like watching 3D. Played a couple of 3D games, it looks pretty awesome too. The internet applications come with it are nice and handy. The sound is good for a TV set. The slim panel looks absolutely gorgeous in my living room.Some minor issues with this model. I do notice the reflective issue for the screen. But it seems to be the common problem with LED TVs.

After alot of reading I finally pulled the plug on the 20th for this tv. 10 days is not that long of time to receive this beauty, considering the holidays and all, but I got it pretty much in the timeframe that was quoted. What made it seem longer was all the reviews I have read in the last few days. This is my first flatscreen HDTV so after alot of the posts about clouding, flashlighting and some disapointments from other buyers I wasn't sure what to expect.First off every thing I have bought off Amazon has been with a positive experience. HomeDirect contacted me within 2 days just to tell me the delivery company will call me to set up a time to deliver. They did just that and delivered it this morning. I kinda figured that the truck would not be heated and knew as with all electronics that they sould be somewhat warm before powering them on. The driver even told me I should wait for a bit to turn it on so I took delivery after inspection and signed for the TV. Assembled the stand and secured it to the entertainment center, shouldn't fall over unless the house shifts ;) Now wait some more, fingers crossed and read the manual. I just upgraded to DirectTV with all new equipment and cables. Plugged everythig in and awaiting the first power on. OK .. the big moment .. I read about the time to come on so I timed it. It took about 13 seconds which I thought was pretty good for a first boot. Went through the menus and the only problem I had was I didn't select the HMDI input from the sat receiver instead selected cable which I don't have...lol... WOW.... when it came on it was very nice! Played with all the settings and with the help from some of the comments here it was quite easy. NO shadowing, NO flashlighting effect, NO negitives so far. The picture quality is amazing!! Tried out the 3D with a few channels and it was a good effect. My son hooked up his ps3 with Black Ops and it detected 3D right away and when he got in the game all I heard was \"WOW!! This is cool!\" Now coming from a 13yrold I figure that this is a passing grade.This TV is well worth the price I paid.

HD pictures will blow you away. the colors are accurate and almost life like. the 240HZ does wonder when watching football or basketball games or any other sports event for that matter. I haven't seen any other issues as the other reviewers have mentioned (clouding and such). I have tested the Panasonic and Samsung brands and can hardly see a difference. the Panasonic is a bit richer but hardly a factor. I played tons of blu rays and the picture is simply amazing. 3D is great too. the glasses are a bit bulky and reflective but in the right setting you'll really enjoy it. the 3d effects are as good as any I've seen so far. make sure you purchase a high speed HDMI cable ($7 on Amazon, as opposed to $40+ at Best Buy) since it doesn't come with the TV or the Blu Ray player.overall, a high quality product for a reasonable price. you're not going to get a better deal for a product as good as this with a bundle as nice as this.", "Date": "December 30, 2010"}, {"Title": "Wow!

When you compare this with other brands that offers 3D, 1080P, LED, 240HZ, 55-inch, you will immediately notice the bargain.WiFi setup was easy - my 13-yr old CTO figured it out without RTFM. We've watched around 8 movies streamed in HD from Netflix via wireless connection and haven't had a single glitch.There are 3 minor problems:1. Sometimes when I turn on the TV and press NetTV button on remote, it would display 'No Signal' even though network connectivity is present. It would mysteriously correct itself when I retry in a few minutes. I haven't got around to read the manual or figure out a pattern. But it doesn't both me much because once streaming starts, everything is smooth, i.e. this problem has never shown up in the middle of streaming.2. when the screen is totally dark, there are some uneven blobs on screen like ghost shadow. This is quite obvious in a totally dark room when there is nothing on screen. However, this does not affect viewing.3. The highly reflective screen means you need to totally darken the room for best viewing. During daytime I had to close all window shutters. So try not to position it opposite strong light source.In general I think this is a great TV that just hasn't been picked up by the market.

We found the Amazon has the Toshiba 55in TV on sale and it is cheaper than the Sony. So we give it a try.In general, I like this Toshiba TV.PROS:- Good picture quality- Built-in wifi is nice. One less wire.- Built-in support of Netflix, Vudu, YouTube then it means that I do not have the turn on my PS3 as well in order to watch Netflix.- 3D glasses transmitter is built-in. So no another piece of device hangs out there. Sony has a separate transmitter for the 3D glasses. When I put the Sony 3D glasses transmitter on the base of the TV, the 3D glasses have poor reception. However, the Sony TV itself is thin, I just don't know where should I put transmitter and the transmitter is not out of place.- User interface is relative easy to use.CONS:- When watch Netflix movie and the display mode set to auto, it is kind of dark. Set to 'sport' mode solve the brightest problem.- No sound when I tried to use the PS3 to play game at first, set the PS3 to use PCM instead of Dobly 5.1 solve the sound problem.- The TV screen is very reflective. The lights on your back shows up on your screen. Sony TV screen is very reflective as well.- Build quality is ok. The TV screen itself is excellent but the finish of the case is not that good. The back of the case near the base is crooked and silver frame around the edge of the TV screen has minor irregularity. Sony build quality is much better.Additional thoughts:- All the connectors are on the right side of the Toshiba TV. It may not be very convenience depending on your room setup.- To have a proper 3D effect, either you sit really close to TV or you need TV with 55in screen or bigger.

Simply put, this is an amazing television.When the package containing the TV arrived, I instantly feared the next step: putting it together. However, the instruction sheet was clear and included both visual and written steps. With my wife helping, it took about fifteen minutes to get the unit assembled and sitting on my television stand. At that point, we plugged in the cable, turned on the power, and the TV walked us through a basic setup. We were watching our favorite shows within minutes. Setting up the DVD player was as easy as plugging it in and changing the input to \"Video 2.\"The picture quality is exceptional and can be adjusted to various ratios including full screen. The visuals come to life in an extraordinary way. Even in 2D mode, the images seem to have an unusual level of depth and realism I've never seen in a television. It's especially the case with sports. Watching the Super Bowl was like being on the field with the players.However, using the TV in such \"old fashioned\" ways is merely the tip of the iceberg. It has so many other features like internet access (through another computer or wireless) that allows Yahoo widgets, can access Vudu, Youtube, etc. I had some issues executing this, but it may have a problem with my network. The instruction booklet, which is the size of a small novel, consistently provides a clear step by step process for everything.  The TV has numerous jacks including USB ports and an SD card reader so you can listen to music, watch stored movie files, see pictures, etc. Nothing like your photos at 55 inches!I haven't had a chance to use the 3D features yet because they require another set of purchases. So, those wanting instant 3D need to keep this in mind. Still, as 3D technology improves and it becomes more widely available it's nice to know that I can easily hop on that bandwagon. Right now, I'm not impressed with the state of 3D, but it's becoming more viable each day.The downside, of course, is the expense, especially since the 3D features cost more. However, even as a 2D TV, it's outstanding. Plus, with so many ports, features, possible add-ons, wireless access, etc. it doesn't appear this television is in danger of becoming obsolete any time soon.

It really is a beautiful looking set, but it it lets itself down on a number of fronts - don't know if any other reviewers are seeing/thinking the same?Most annoying for me is that the TV drops the wireless network settings, usually in the middle of a NetFlix/VUDU movie, and I have to re-enter them.  Not drops the signal, actually drops the settings, and I have to re-enter them.  I have a WPA2 wireless network set up, with a long hidden name and long password.  Entering over 30 mixed-case characters every time this happens it a pain.  When I called Toshiba's support they tried to be helpful, but ultimately they had nothing to offer other than a service call that I would have to pay for (under warranty) if the engineer could find nothing wrong.  Given that I cannot 'make' the TV drop the settings, I would likely end up out of pocket.  It was suggested that I try a patch cable, and I asked if that fixed it, would Toshiba pay for it?  While this got some giggles, the answer was \"no\".Then there is the UI.  I compare this to how I would compare Apple's UI with some funky Linux UI.  Like Linux, all of the bits are in there, and it does a lot of cool stuff, but it sure is clunky and difficult to navigate.  Plus there are several dead-end interfaces where I could find no way out of the interface other than to reboot the TV.Speaking of boot times... this is slooooooowwwwww[...]  It is fine if you want to watch regular TV, or a Disc, but to use the Net TV features, you need to wait several minutes for that part of the TV OS to boot, and there is no optional progress indicator...so you keep pressing the Net TV button until you get in.Another pain is the picture settings.  I have found that these cannot be retained in all cases.  Especially with the NetTV apps (netflix/vudu) the TV keeps reverting to some picture mode that looks bad and has to be adjusted.  And that reminds me... when you are using the NetTV apps, the regular MENU button does not do anything.  Instead (and I had to search Toshiba's forum for this) you use the highly obvious QUICK menu.  What were the Toshiba engineers thinking here?Final major annoyance... the NetFlix experience - my Wii does a better job. The streaming sometimes stutters along, and the only way I can fix this is to pause the movie to allow the cache to catch its breath, or in some cases, stop and restart the movie.Aside from those more major niggles, which I regard as those that get in the way of my daily use... there are also some minor ones:- screen is highly reflective - any light object in the room at all can be seen on the screen.  No biggie for me as I watch at nights with the curtains pulled.- cable guide on the base is not the most solid I have seen - I have power and an HDMI cable running down through it, disturb it too much, and it pops off- would like more clearance beneath the stand base - just a few mm.  I would like to be able to run my center speaker cable below the base, but there is not enough room, so it is draped over the top which spoils the looks of an otherwise tidy unit.So to summarize, while this is a pretty good TV, it does not provide a consistent experience across the board.  I have a few more days before I need to decide whether or not to return it.  I may try a patch cable to see if that does the trick for my wireless woes - perhaps I will send Toshiba an invoice :)I recommend buying and giving it a try to see if it works for you... but keep the box...", "Date": "February 5, 2011"}, {"Title": "Vivid, Accurate Picture After Some Tweaking", "Author": "Shawn Clover", "ReviewID": "R2FMZA4A4GVNGS", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I was a bit hesitant after reading some of the horror stories over the image ghosting. I ended up hitting the order button the day a review came out on Home Theater Mag's site that gave high marks on the picture quality.Setup: I was amazed how easily the setup went. The Regza-Link is a dream come true. All you need is a compatible Amp (I just got a new Onkyo which is fully-compatible) and the TV turns the amp on/off and controls the volume right out of the box. I didn't even need to fiddle around with anything--it just worked. The ARC (Audio Return Channel) worked perfectly out of the box too so I get nice 5.1 surround sent to the amp for antenna broadcast tv. Just make sure you have an HDMI 1.4a cable to make everything work. The wifi setup is as simple as logging on to your wifi. I hung the TV on my existing wall mount and the screen only protrudes 2.5 inches from the wall--nice and slim! I would recommend getting your cables all connected before mounting to a wall because it's really tough to get cables in once it's mounted due to the slimness.Picture: Like all new TVs, the picture needs a lot of tweaking to get it good. Take a look at the settings recommendations in the Home Theater Mag article--they are a good starting point. From there, get yourself a Spears and Munsil Blu-Ray to further refine things. There are ghosting spots in areas that should be black--if you're obsessed with worrying about ghosting, this might not be the TV for you because it is noticeable. I suspect they'll be able to get this a bit more under control with future firmware updates. The 240 Hz picture isn't really good for anything but sports--major soap-opera-effect for everything else. It's easy to toggle it on and off using the quick pop-up menu.  And, yes, the screen has glare-the surface is highly reflective.3D: I'm not really too interested in 3D. I suppose you need made-for-3D content to make this work--I have none. I tried turning it on for a regular football game, but all I get is a headache-inducing dual image which is nothing but annoying.Other features: Netflix is built-in, but it's a stripped-down interface that can only pull up movies in your queue--you can't browse. Also, the Netflix app does not support 5.1 surround sound which is makes it useless for me. The Yahoo widgets are a joke and not worthwhile for anything in my opinion. The built-in Pandora is almost worthwhile, but I prefer to turn off my tv screen while Pandora is running and you can't do that here. I'll continue to use my Pandora hookup through my media system.Side note: Mine was shipped via Pilot Freight. Delivery appointment times mean absolutely nothing to this company--they were 9 hours late with no apologies.

I have always had good luck with Toshiba and so figured this was the one for me.Picture is great.  I don't see any flashlighting or things like that.  Darks are very dark, colors are rich.  We had an old Sony SXRD (their version of DLP) that this replaced.  At first the wife was on me, saying our old TV had a perfect picture and we did not need a new TV.  As soon as I fired this up that talk stopped.  She had to admit she had no idea how \"bad\" our old picture was compared to this (put it on an HD feed of that new Sherlock Holmes movie, and she said it was like they were in the room with us).Pros-Set up was easy enough, but I question their recommended way of putting on the stand.  I put the bracket on back of the TV and then lifted it up and set it in the stand and then screwed it in.-Pic is gorgeous..have not seen any better, and I almost went Plasma..glad I went with this.-Speakers are fine for the TV...in fact, I am amazed they sound as good as they do-My wife thinks the cabinet is beautiful for what that is worthCons-No Component input?  Ok they give you some sort of converter to use component with and it seemed to work with my Wii, but I would have liked to have had one legitimate component input-Screen is pretty shiny...looks great turned off but if you have much glare it might be an issue.  The Sony seems to have more of a matted finish which might look better depending on your setup-Remote is the typical Japanese mess...rows of buttons.  I wish it did have a quick button to cycle through the picture mode-TBD on the free glasses.  They use essentially a watch battery (not rechargeable or anything like that).

You will definitely not have made \"a mistake\" if you buy this TV at the current price.  I am still wondering why the sudden price drop...this thing just came out and the list per the Toshiba site is $3K+.  Amazon did seem to have the best price by several hundreds of dollars.  It is worth checking out the Toshiba site to see all the features this TV has (Toshiba seems to have gone all out here and cut no corners or expense).

I swear by it. The 3D active shutter gets annoying to replace batteries but they are common and I can buy them at Target, The picture looks the same as day 1, crystal clear. I still recommend this LED TV over any other. We have the 70\" sharp, and the picture on this still wins in my opinion. I have the sound optical out to a Onkyo Home  theater. If you buy a nice TV like this, buy yourself the Home theater too, and not one of those ones with the blu ray HTIB, the regular Home theaters. The TV picture is easy to clean with a microfiber cloth and after a year, I have not noticed any glare or anything. Inputs are still easy to use. The internet capabilities are not the quickest, but I bought this as an amazing TV, not for the internet capabilities. Overall, 3D and High Def is amazing.-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------I was looking for a new large TV between 46 and 50\". This is the best one out there. It offers pure LED technology which in my opinion makes the picture look better than LCD and Plasma. Plasma picture may look better at times, but because of the half life of Plasma TVs, I chose to buy this LED TV. It offers crystal clear 1080p picture, and smart app technology. I use the smart apps every so often, like Vudu and pandora. You can watch Netflix on the TV as well, but Vudu streams live HD video and live 3D video right to your TV over an internet connection.As far as 3D goes, I watched Drive Angry and Tron and both looked really amazing in 3D, way better than any movie theater. The TV came with 4 pairs of 3D glasses. There was minimal or no ghosting because of the quick refresh rate, and the picture quality was top notch. I tried using 3D on MLB the Show on PS3, but couldn't seem to get it to work first shot. I really didn't take the time to try though.Overall, this TV gives you LED Technology, 1080pm Picture, Smart Apps, and 3D Technology. Oh and its 46\" and the build of the TV is amazing. It isn't made of flimsy plastic like a Westinghouse or Vizio. The material is so well built, when the TV is off, you can see your reflection in it.

I can hook PS3 through hdmi to TV and get sound, but once I hook it to sound system and to TV, it cut out the sound)4) A lot of apps/widgets (whatever you want to call it). Previous TV had none. I haven't messed with it yet5) A lot more setting control to change things the way I want (also a con)6) There is a dimmer selection for the light and it comes from the bottom right corner for the power button. Love it. Out of site, out of mind so I can enjoy the show. Previous tv has one green dot right in the middle that i find annoying.7) Design is nice and simple. On TV control is touch activated so you don't have annoying buttons sticking out.8) Stand is a swivel stand so you can get to the inputs and outputs at the back of the tv more easily. (they are also all on one side with clear labels so that makes it easier. (definitely a lot better than my last TV)9) Color rendering is great when there's lots of color.Cons1) As most LED edgelit TV. On a black image, you can definitely see the 4 corners definitely has more concentration of light.2) On a back image, you will definitely see some of the backlit clouding issues that people mention unless you turn the backlit down but then when colors come in, they won't be as bright anymore and I like it slightly brighter.3) Since I set the setting so that the color comes in as bright as my older LCD TV. On black images/when the movie is in a dark setting, the black definitely isn't as dark as my LCD tv.4) TV definitely takes longer to start up than my previous LCD. I have seen people mention a couple other settings which I have yet to tried except turning wireless off (in fact, never set it up).5) A lot more settings. Some does not make sense without reading the manual so it makes it less \"intuitive\". At least to me, that little graph where you can modify some stuff in advanced settings. I was wondering how it truly works (still need to read manual on it).6) TV seems a feels a bit too heavy for the stand but might not be. Just my feeling.Movies I have watched on this TV (both Blu-ray and otherwise)Despicable Me (bluray)Buried (dvd)The American (dvd)Devil (dvd)Takers (dvd)Resident Evil: Afterlife (bluray)Out of this, I see the corner LED and back light issues mostly with Buried and Devil because of the Darkness setting situation that is employed. Otherwise, I don't notice it on most other movies.I have not tested out 3d but will be buying a couple from amazon to try that out. I also did not talk about ghosting because I sit about 10-15 feet away from the TV and you really can't tell at that distance. You can't even tell how pixelated some DVDs and just regular TV channels are unless you sit about 5ft away from it. Also, I did not like the soap opera effect, so I turned off both the 240Hz and the other setting which slipped my mind (not resolution+ or noise reduction).I hope this helps everyone. I will be keeping this TV and yes I rated it 3 stars based on the quality alone but there is more pros than cons to me (whereby cons could be ignored if you don't focus on it which I don't when movie starts running). The cost to quality ratio was what got me (really only paid 800-900 for this TV only if you consider the \"freebies\"). a 5 star would be no backlit or corner lit issues for blacks :) 4 start would have one or the other eliminated, preferably backlit as corner lit matters a little less since you don't focus on the screen as much there.", "Date": "January 27, 2011"}, {"Title": "WOW", "Author": "Ronald N.

I bought it in 2011 when they had it on sale for $899 and back then for a 3D TV that was one heck of a deal so I went for it. Everyone also thought that 3D was going to be more and more popular but I have maybe used the 3D feature on this TV under 10 times, I own one 3D movie and I played a few XBOX games in 3D but found it to be a hassle to get the glasses and TV setting just right so I haven't used the 3D feature the past 2 years.Overall the TV is solid and the picture is great, almost too great if you ask some people, it makes regular HD TV shows look like soap operas, very vivid and crisp picture. I've gotten used to it but every time a friend comes over they comment on it.I do really enjoy the Game mode because I do a lot of online gaming and there is a good difference you can see when the Game mode is on, hard to explain but overall great picture for almost any movie, TV show and video game.Cons: Only reasons I docked a few stars was: -1 star because of the SUPER glossy and shiny almost mirror like screen. You really need a blacked out room for this TV, so I did invest in a pair of darkening curtains since it is by a bay window in my house. It would work best in a dark basement without much light glare.-1/2 star because any movie, show or game with lots of dark scenes you do notice the almost burnt cells or cloudy grayish colored blots around the TV. A lot of other reviewers complained about this and it is a downfall for the TV but only during credits or really dark scenes, and still not too noticeable. However I have not seen a better TV for bright scenes and games this TV really pops with anything colorful and bright.-1/2 star because the TV smart setting that connects to the internet for updates, yahoo apps, netflix, etc. Not a huge deal because I hardly used it but just the fact I can't get updates bugs me and I feel like I'm missing out. There may be an explanation for this and I have not tried to hard to figure it out because again, I hardly use it.Overall for the price I have been happy with it and it has treated me well, but it may not be the TV for everyone.

Before I bought it, I read some reviews, some good ones and some bad ones. After using it for two months, I found out all of them stands.1.The setup is very easy. Take it out of the box and then you are ready to use. If you want to use some advanced features, such as wireless internet, just put into the set up and then it is ready to go.2. The quality of pictures are very good. There are some reviews about that when the tv is set to 240Hz, the pictures some time is unstable. That is true with my experience but happens rare, so it is not a big concern. I just used standard for all the things I watch and we are happy with it.3. The internet can not explore google et al. There are only fixed items you can use. We generally do not use this feature.4. 3D is in good quality when we watch some movies. But is does not stands out so much as some exhibitions from other venters. It could be due to different movie programs. But it did give you a 3D view with depth. However, it is 240Hz TV, but when using 3D, it goes back to 60Hz with 30Hz each for one eye. So when viewing fast moving objects, this may create some cross talk. When the things are slow moving, it is very good.5. Gaming: When you do games, you have to use game mode. otherwise there are a 0.2-0.5 second lagging. With PS3 gaming, the picture quality is phenominal (HDMI connection). Some people commented 3D gaming has too much cross talks, I tried it for several times (I am not a gamer any ways). The same as 3D TVs, The 3D in gaming is enjoyable too. I like it so some time I just play some 3D games to enjoy 3D (not enjoy gaming). Only when there are fast moving scenes, cross talk exists but I can tolerate it.6. True black: When watching TV, there is no problem, without watching TV, it does not show true black, cloud exists as reviewed by others.7 Reflection: This is the biggest problem. I would like to give it a 4.5 star if it is not this problem. In living room at bright day light, there is alway a window in the TV which bothers me from watching. I can turn the TV monitor to a different angle to reduce it so I still can enjoy it. Recently my wife put a thicker curtain on and we have no problem now.In general, we like this TV. However, I do not know what the sony TV look like. Due to the above issues, if you just want to buy a LED TV to enjoy watching, considering the difference in price, this could be a good choice for you.

The only issue I had was with the dusty screen, used monster plasma cleaner and it cleaned the screen to new condition, not one scratch since it is a glass screen and a scratch could make it a deal breaker.I was originally looking at the used 55 inch model of the same TV but when I had it in my cart, amazon warehouse deals changed the price from $808.00 to $1,256.00 when I was trying to check out, something stinks there, and their response is sorry, but warehouse deals is like the stock market, up & down, with no rhyme or reason.  Nevertheless I decided to go with the 46inch used-good model at $691.00, still a great deal considering the price of similiar LED 3D TV's.Regarding the performance, the HD content looks great, exceptional colors and happy with that, but the backlight clouding and bleeding is severe, it is impossible to watch any movies with a lot of dark scenes especially at night, it is so apparent that regardless of how much I really love the style, colors and price, the backlight clouding and blooming makes it impossible for me to keep this TV, so I will be returning it and picking up a Samsung 58 inch 3D Plasma instead that Warehouse Deals has for $1,085.00 right now.  Belive me, I tried every picture setting and the backlight clouding and blooming is impossible to remove. It typically is not noticable during the day or when you watch regular TV, but when you threw in a movie like the Dark Knight which has extensive Dark scenes, the TV shows white clouds/blooms all around the set and the dark black scenes have white light clouds in them.  Not good.Regarding the 3D Aspect, seems okay, but there is something fundamentally wrong with the glasses, they are basically unsuable for me, they are to big, to heavy, and the placement of the nose bridge is bad, I will be returning that also with the TV.If your looking for good bargain and don't mind the severe backlight clouding and bleeding, go for it, since it is still a good bargain at $691 for a used model, but if you a movie buff like me, who enjoys his dark/black scenes, stay away.", "Date": "July 7, 2011"}, {"Title": "Admirable!!", "Author": "neon", "ReviewID": "R2JD4152BCJ8OV", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This is my first review ever and i must admit that after ordering this 3D TV (with a promotion deal, which included 3D DVD & 2 3D Glasses) for 1499, i was so sceptical about the quality of TV.

There is no gosting as some of the reviews state. Maybe because we got the 46\" instead of the 55\" the gosting problem is not a problem.

The TV was easy to set up, in fact after our first TV came shattered, the delivery guys opened and assembled the second for us. The damage to the first TV was disappointing, but Amazon had the new one shipped to us the moment I informed them and though it would have been nice to have it sent faster, it did arrive in just about a week. The menus are pretty self explanatory. I can't seem to figure out how to get the picture size to stay set how we would like it. Every time we turn off the TV we have to reset the size. Also sometimes it won't switch to 3D mode. I press all the buttons as directed but it doesn't switch over. I will turn the TV off and then it seems to work. I haven't had time to call toshiba about this yet, but I am a little worried this could be a problem. The price was right for this TV, especially with the 4 pairs of glasses.

No clouding issues as others seem to have.  I do get the \"soap opera effect\" on some programs, but that's not the worst thing in the world.  Network connected very fast and with no issues.  Did a software upgrade and then tried to do a firmware upgrade (TV needs firmware V42 - 2/26/11).  Could not get the firmware to upgrade (had to download from Toshiba.com).  Called Toshiba and they sent me a flash drive and then I was able to upgrade.  3D and 3D glasses very good.  No trouble connecting or watching.Now, here are the only negatives.  First, the set takes 15-18 seconds to turn on.  As an LED, it is kind of like when you boot up a laptop or IPad, i.e., does not come right on, but needs to \"warm up.\"  If you are used to LCD's that come right on, this will take some adjustment.Second, each time you watch a 3D progran, you need to have the TV remote nearby to confirm that 3D will be used.

I have an older XBR6 top of the line Sony 52 inch LCD TV in another part of the house and I like the Toshiba picture better. High definition clarity is simply outstanding. Regular digital clarity is also good. When I tuned into a digital broadcast (non hi-def) sitcom show however, there was unacceptable judder or stutter-movements instead of the usual smooth motion. Higher frame or refresh rates are supposed to smooth motion and reduce jerkiness or judder. I hear it can produce a smoothing or 'soap opera' effect which I haven't seen on this TV. I wonder if there is judder on other brands of 240 Hz TV's? If there is a way to eliminate the judder effect on this TV, please tell me. It stands to reason that if 240 Hz is turned off there would be more judder, but I never noticed judder in 60 Hz or 120 Hz sets, so why now? I haven't tried turning it off. Comments are welcome.I started with \"Standard\" mode for the picture but when I tried \"Sport\" I liked it much better. Now I'm sold on having all content in the \"Sport\" mode. The picture is brighter and the high-def appears more high-def. I watched a Blu-ray movie last night (The Ghost Writer). It started playing in the \"Autoplay\" mode in which the color look dull. I switched to the TV \"Sport\" mode which made the color much brighter and more pleasing to the eye.About \"clouding\" or bright light spots on the screen - I noticed this last night in between switching my input from the DVD player back to the TV.  The screen was blank and grayish-black in color. There were several large \"clouds\" throughout the screen mixed with areas of backlights. As far as I'm concerned this is not a problem since I don't notice any of this when there is content on the screen. It's probably common to LED TV's and it's a non-issue as far as I'm concerned.About the sound. The audio volume and quality of sound is much much better than I expected - better than my thicker top of the line Sony XBR LCD. I don't understand why anyone would complain about the sound unless they're comparing it to external speakers, which is not a fair comparison.I was eager to use the built-in WiFi to connect with the Internet but the modem and WiFi router with my desktop are on a different floor at the other end of the house. While the WiFi in my laptop can pick up the signal and operate from the area of this TV, the TV cannot not. Neither does the built in WiFi with the DVD player. If someone can recommend a WiFi booster to use with my router to solve the problem, I'd appreciate the tip.Lastly, the screen is like a black mirror. There is a lot of reflection when the set is off. I almost didn't order it for that reason. It turns out not to be a big deal. Most LED TV's or monitors have reflective screens. This one may be a little more reflective than others but it's is minimal when there is content on the screen. It's not a problem like I thought it might have been. All in all I think it's a very stylish TV with great - about as good as it gets - color and picture clarity. I've always owned Sony's and thought I'd get another, but I'm happy with this Toshiba for now.", "Date": "May 14, 2011"}, {"Title": "MY FIRST HD TV...CLOUDY BLACK BACKGROUND A SLIGHT CONCERN", "Author": "Loren R. Knapp", "ReviewID": "RR19WMDTW09", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I did a lot of flip-flopping back and forth on this one.  My son has a 55\" Samsung.  He took one look at the picture on this Toshiba and asked if that is a Blu-Ray DVD playing?  It wasn't just a movie off the cable.  He was very impressed.Amazon is great!  No problem went like clock work.  The price was the lowest I found and with the free delivery and 2 free pair of 3D glasses it was a steal.OK..the cloudy/hazy effect seen on a black screen is there...no doubt.  I called Toshiba 6 times...they will not admit there is a problem that this is a normal thing.  Each one gave me a different story and way to fix it.  None worked.  One person in this review section said \"who just looks at the black screen?\"  You only see it for a split second during the channel switch.  You can see it on some dark scenes, but can be lessened. Read on. I talked to our local Tashiba tech and he said all he would do is swap out some board and it probably would not make one bit of difference. All the great things including the price out weigh this slight thing that most won't even notice.  My wife hasn't mentioned noticing it.One reviewer here had a detailed way to get rid of the clouding by setting advanced picture settings to his tested settings.  I did and it didn't change mine.The sound is not good, but with my high end surround sound it makes no difference.The screen is shiny and reflective, but not a problem when lights are low.UP-DATE.  I was watching a movie last night with lots of night scenes (dark) and you can see the cloudy areas. They cover about 1/4th of the screen area. I put the TV on one of the upper channels that is always soild black and tweeked things until the hazy cloud spots were reduced greatly. This darkened the \"Sports\" vivid setting way too much, however standard looks goodUPDATE:Michael Smith and one other person in the over 60 reviews mention putting USB fans on the back of the TV to help clear up the Cloudy look.  I bought two today for $30. They are 80X80X25MM  5v  47.38 CFM They're made by Thermaltake.  They have a fan speed control. The top 2 small bolts that hold the blade guard line up perfectly with the holes in the vent area and snap right in. I put one on the vent right above the one where you can see the green mother board and the second one on the top vent to the immediate right.  I plugged them into the two USB ports and turned the TV on.  They go on and off with the TV.  I put the fan speed on medium as it is quieter. Although, with the surround sound you would never hear them on high speed. After having the TV on for enough time for it to heat up I switched to one of the upper channels that is all black..no picture.  The clouding is much less obvious.  It does help, although they are not 100% gone.  I recommend you give it a try. The TV has a great picture and from everything I have read this is a common occurance with these LED thin screen TVs. I will hopefully get used to it especially since it is not so noticeable now.WOW!!  I had a real eye opener.  Where you select input, I was always using \"Ant/Cable\" big mistake I was moving thru the other input choices and when I hit one of the HDMI Input the HD really kicked in.  The picture on this TV is PERFECT!  So crisp just like a movie theater.  I did upload the new firmware that Toshiba suggests. I use an OpticalDigital cable too that eliminated all my Surround sound cables and I believe is part of the great picture quality. I finally got the 3d working and it is mind boggling! If anyone wants more deatils as to how I have this all hooked up with the blu-ray player just let me know.If the things you've been reading about the cloudy appearance on a black screen are holding you back..don't let that bother you.  It is pretty much normal with these LED TV's. I highly recommend it especiall for the low price.

I have mine hung on the wall and couch roughly 8-10' from the TV.  I do not recommend much further away.  Cartoon movies and Bright movies look great.  Yes there is clouding in very dark scenes but so far this has not been a huge problem.  Please remember this is a middle of the line LED TV.  I paid $1250 for TV, 2 sets of 3D glasses, and a 3D BRplayer.  You do get a \"soap opera\" look when watching regular HD TV shows but I have noticed this with all the 240 Hz LED TV's and you can turn off the 240 Hz.  Honestly after a could of days you get used to it and eventually other TV's don't look right without it.2. 3D - Not very impressed with 3D but I believe a lot of this has to do with the technology.  Even the top of the line display TV's in stores don't look that great to me.  I would not buy this TV if you are only getting it for the 3D experience.  If 3D is the way you want to go, you are going to have to pay $$$ for it.  I would just wait for the technology to get better or change all together.  I do not believe shutter glasses will be the standard for long (seeing as how LG already came out with \"non\" shutter 3D glasses).If you are only looking for a 2D LED TV I would not recommend this.  There are much better LED TV's for the price (based on the package deal $1250. I do not know what the TV price alone is).If you want to check out 3D on some sports and some movies I would recommend this but don't kid yourself and think you are getting a top of the line 3D TV.I do not regret my purchase but if I had to do it again I would have opted for a 50+\" 2D plasma TV and waited a couple years to see where the 3D technology settles before going 3D.", "Date": "April 12, 2011"}, {"Title": "Toshiba almost succeeded with a real winner here except for the clouding (uneven backlighting)", "Author": "AF", "ReviewID": "R3NRJB0D1YEIMZ", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "The TV is really impressive.

The styling alone supersedes that of many other manufacturer models not to mention the clarity & fine details exhibited in the picture. Internet capability is also great, experienced no problems. Toshiba does have a software upgrade (February 2011) which I did install.My one & only issue with the TV is the clouding appearing on dark scenes. The TV is fine when it initially goes on, there are no clouds or uneven backlighting present. However, after warming up for approximately 25-30 minutes, the clouds begin to appear creating the uneven backlighting on the screen. The clouds become very noticeable in dark scenes, even while viewing movie credits. They are very pronounced in the center & right side of the screen.The clouding is not a problem during the daylight hours. However, at night in a dark room while watching movies having dark scenes, the clouds really stand out & are highly visible. The clouding is extremely visible when changing inputs on the TV as well. The clouds on my set look very similar to the ones shown in the photos posted on the Amazon website, almost like flashlights being held behind the TV screen.  My other Toshiba set (47ZV650u) does not experience any clouding issues at all.I have tried every conceivable adjustment on the TV in attempts to eliminate and or reduce the clouding (even those posted on this site) without having success. Some of the settings did help slightly but the clouds remained visible. I reached the point where the picture quality was becoming an issue the more I tried to tweak the settings to reduce the clouding. I called Toshiba & Toshiba did not appear to be aware of any clouding issues on this set (so I was told). I was advised it may be a defective panel & was also asked to send in photos of the problem. I suggested to the representative to visit the Amazon website to review the write-ups & photos. Judging from the many reviews on this set, the clouding problem appears to be an inherent problem on this particular model.Even though the features & the price of this set were great, I have decided to return the set.", "Date": "March 20, 2011"}, {"Title": "TOSHIBA 55WX800U", "Author": "Dave", "ReviewID": "R12ZEFQ446MW8S", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I love this TV.

Understanding that is not 100% fair for this comparison by using these two which they similar but not exactly same level.

Make sure to get one or two pairs of 3D capable HDMI (Ver 1.4) cables.Audio Performance:Today's thin panel TV is hardly to provide a satisfied sound quality for all the programs. Its tiny speakers work okay for news and programs which don't have a very dynamic range. Need a separate audio system to carry the sound if you need anything else more than a news watching. It can't compare with my older SONY which has a very nice and large speaker on each side, but I don't think it is fair to take stars away from this performance, because it almost become an industry standard for this measure.Net APPSThe \"Net TV\" is very easy to set up and works flawlessly.

It is wireless enabled and seems to perform better on my network than the tv wireless. Both are easy to set up.My reason for the 4 star rating is twofold.The tinny sound coming from the speakers can sometimes be harsh and annoying and no adjustment to the menu audio settings will do much to improve. I am running sound into my JVC 5.1 receiver thru optical connection and using its SEA to fine tune the sound.Certainly no \"rich bass\" as touted in the manual.Since there are no RCA audio out jacks on the TV this would present a problem if your receiver had no  digital inputs.Posted on 1/31/2011torfleet@aol.com", "Date": "January 31, 2011"}, {"Title": "Appearance/light reflection/connectivity", "Author": "danny", "ReviewID": "RSQKA1SGHGO6W", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "This TV provides a great picture, but the screen is too bright showing relections of anything in the room.

We were told that t.v's this large (46\") had to be shipped by a company that would call us and set up an appt to come and deliver the tv to our home and we would have to inspect it before the shipper left. I often checked the tracking updates on my amazon account and our set arrived at the second shipping compnay on the 11th at 6am.

We were very frustrated and pretty angry that it was going to take another week to get our new t.v., if we had been informed that they only deleiver on thursdays in our area we would of paid for quicker shipping to avoid this issue. We ended up driving about 2 hours away to pick the set up ourselves. We spoke with Amazon about this issue and they offered us a 20% discount on our NEXT shipping cost which is a total of 11.00.....

I had no intention of buying a 3D TV until I saw the sale Amazon had that included the 3D glasses for 55\" LED 3D HDTV for $1579. It was a very lucrative deal since I was going to spend close to that on a regular LED/LCD TV anyway. I added to cart three times and then removed. I was skeptical about the TV since there were very few reviews on Amazon. And finally, I decided to pull the plug and ordered it anyways. Thanks to the Amazon's 30 day risk free return policy!My TV was delivered just before the Christmas. Now I have been using Toshiba 55WX800U for close to a month. Here is my review.Appearance: It is very slim!! Screen is very reflective and shiny. If your room lighting is adequate it should not be a big issue. Plug in your cords before you If you decide to wall mount the TV since, it leaves very little gap between wall and the TV.Picture clarity: We were really stunned by the crisp quality of 2D video. Black were dark black. We did not notice any disturbing ghosting or clouding as other other reviewers have experienced.3d effect: Since, I do not have a 3D player at present, I was not able to test 3D on this TV. I have ordered Samsung 3D Bluray player. I may update it later. If you buy HDMI cable, make sure it is HDMI 1.4 in order to view 3D material.Network: It was easy did not have any issue connecting to my wireless router. It does have a wizard to connect to the router or you can choose advance settings if you are comfortable with the manually setting up the network. Even though other devices showed strong signals, to my surprise TV's network software reported my wireless signal are week. huh..NetTV: The first time I pressed the NetTV button on the remote. it downloaded the updated software from Toshiba I had to wait till it was completed. I used Pandora with no issues. Youtub/xl was kind of slow. I think It would be easier to hookup a PC directly rather than waiting for the slow response from the Net apps. You can download other Yahoo widgets to your TV from the Widget library.DLNA: The TV can be setup to work as DMR and DMC. This is a cool feature. I was able to connect to PS3Media Server and Serviio DLNA server after some tweaking. Windows media player 12 worked flawlessly as a DLNA server with this TV. I was able to play audio/video files stored on USB drives and pictures from SD Memory card with Media Player built in the TV.  For more on DLNA supported formats with this TV, check out Toshiba's online manual. [...]Summary: Toshiba doesn't have picture-in-picture or side-by-side picture modes. The remote can operate five other devices apart from the HDTV itself. If you are purist about the colors and visual image productions, check out the review here to tweak enhancement setting [...]Occasionally, I noticed some flickering I think that is caused by quality of the source material but turning off ClearFrame 240 and setting film stabilization to low solved the problem. Connecting my PC with HDMI was simple I connected it to HDMI4 slot on the back of the TV.  My only complaint is, it takes about 20 sec to start when powered on.Overall, I am very happy with this TV.  I do not regret my decision. I think it is a good investment compare to price I paid and features packed in this TV!!", "Date": "January 16, 2011"}, {"Title": "Yahoo Widget Gallery", "Author": "jimmytalty", "ReviewID": "R2OO8TC0E9NY3D", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Thanks for all of the great info in the all of the reviews.

Well, when they went to deliver the TV again I couldn't get a hold of them to schedule the time, I called about 15 times in 2 days and nothing, then I finally get a hold of them and they tell me i missed the cut off for the next day, i will have to wait a week. I was so furious as you could imagine. So i called amazon and complained about the terrible shipping service, so they called the shipping company and told them they had to deliver the TV. So I finally was able to get confirmation that the TV was set to arrive this past wednesday. Well, i waited and waited... no TV. So i call amazon again, while on the phone, the shipping company called me to tell me the weather was too bad to deliver and they would deliver the next day. Well, it arrived, but 2 TV's came, the one i had asked to return and refused delivery and the new one. Well, good thing both came because the box to the 2nd tv had a 2ft gash in the side of the box. I'm pretty sure the TV was shattered again. But, luckily, my TV is in perfect condition :) Amazon said they will be refunding my account in about a week.Now, set up was a breeze, set the tv on the couch, put in the 9 screws and my gf and i set it up on the stand. Hooked up my 2hdmi cords to the cable box and ps3. Set up to my settings and tv works perfect. Set up wireless and that works too. Pandora isn't set up for some reason. But i think it needs to update over the next few days or something. Netflix works fine.Sound, not bad actually, not surround sound, but its loud, no static. no problem. just what i expected.Picture: great picture. Watched nascar and no streaking. Watching T3 right now on FX and no problems. There is a slight glare, but not bad. Just what i expected. T3 is pretty dark in the 1st half of the movie so that is why there is a glare with the daylight. I have 11 windows where my TV and vaulted ceilings. I have not seen the bleeding other people are talking about but again, its not pitch black in my house and honestly, i think people are being too critical.Quality: The stand is very sturdy if you set it up right. And the TV is the most beautiful TV i have ever seen. Much better than Samsung. Took 9 seconds to turn on. Very limited delay in changing channels. Even non-hd channels look good, 480ip. They are just square instead of rectangle like the TV.I have not used it much yet, but so far, I have no complaints. After a week or 2 i will update again after i try to use more of the settings. I will mention, i programmed the cable box, dvd/vcr combo no problem. I can use everything on the TV remote :) For $1,580 you can't beat the price/quality. No regrets. I also bought the square trade warranty just in case. You never know... Good luck to those thinking of buying it!Update: so, there are backlight blotch issues. Only noticeable in dark scenes at night. Annoying at first but u have to get over it. Almost every led tv does this. And this is $400-600 cheaper than any other tv close to this. 3d conversion from 2d doesn't work very good. Tried side by side and top and bottom. And gave me a headache. No big deal because not much 3d use now anyway. Also, 240hz on and off is not noticable to me and soap opera effect is still there. Usb drive works great!

In any dark scene this problem is obvious, even after changing the backlighting, brightness and Dynalight settings.

Samsung's lackluster warranty service motivated me to return this TV within the 30-day Amazon window (starting to regret that decision now).

Angel \"americanpride\"", "ReviewID": "RQ8EEHLYV7AYI", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I uploaded some pictures to show how reflective this television is.Upon receiving this television, I found the box to be thin and unbalanced.  Felt as if it could easily fall over if bumped, so if you have kids or pets around when unboxing you should be extremely careful.My first impression of this television was that it looked like a dark mirror.  The amount of reflection is crazy.  I have two LCD televisions (37\" Westinghouse and 52\" Sony) that have a matte finish and there is very little glare/reflections on those.  The reflection was beyond distracting.If you purchase this television and want to view 3D content right away then you need to either get a bundle with the glasses or purchase the FPT-AGO1U Real D 3D glasses from Toshiba.  They currently cost about $86 to $120 per pair.  You will not be utilizing 3D much, if ever, if you don't have enough glasses for everyone.The built-in speakers are good for a flat screen, but I use and recommend a receiver and speakers.  If you do not have a speaker system, then these will be adequate until you do.Picture Quality - The picture is good as long as you are in a dark room (to avoid reflections) and can get past the clouding issues.  You need to tweak the settings out of the box due to the soap opera effect (Turn ClearFrame 120 off!)  The clouding is bad.  I see clouding in all quadrants of this tv during dard scenes, especially the lower right quadrant.  This television uses Edge-Lit LED technology and it really does make the lighting in the entire picture change especially in dark scenes, in a negative way.The 3D is very good.  I have tested this tv with 3D trailers on VUDU, 3D videos on my PS3, and 3D games on my PS3.  I did see some ghosting, but it either goes away after the tv warms up or I stop noticing it.  The biggest negative about the 3D is the need for glasses, and these are HUGE glasses (but comfortable enough to watch a movie).  Obviously, your 3D milage may vary since there is limitted content and if you don't have enough glasses for everyone watching then you won't be using it.Another thing that bothered me with this tv was the lack of component connections.  It does have 4 hdmi connectors, but I do have a some game systems (Wii, Xbox, PS2) that I need to be able to connect via component cables.  I can only connect ONE item at a time via component cables to this television without a switch or a receiver.It also only has an optical output for audio (which is nice to have), but to connect it to my computer I need regular stereo rca output.  My other televisions have both.I was impressed with the wireless connectivity.  I am able to stream Netflix and HD content via VUDU without a problem over my wireless network and it looks great.  As of this review, it unfortunately does not have Hulu nor Amazon On Demand apps.

I'd love to have the options to just buy the tv only.  I already have a universal remote (plus this tv will let your android/iphone work as a great remote), I already have external sound, I already have a satellite box (but soon I'll be ditching satellite and cable tv entirely, as well as physical media like blue-ray or dvds - soooo 2000s).* built-in apps - AWESOME - just need to have more of them, namely one for each network television station and hulu.... the vudu app is great - the picture quality insanely beautiful.* thin - wonderfully thin, gotta love it* Soap Opera Effect - yes, the 240hz and pictureview and whatever other settings are out there to sharpen the image work, and work too well... just turn these options off under your \"movie 1\" settings and you'll always be happy, because this gets rid of the effect.* SHINY - my LEAST favorite part of this TV - why oh why do all TVs have to be shiny?  here's my suggestion: ship the tv's with an \"anti-glare\" sticker on the entire screen (to also protect against scratches during shipment) - if people always watch tv in dark rooms, have them remove the dang sticker revealing a mirror-like finish.  If they watch TV in a bright room (I live in a high rise in Arizona - it doesn't get much brighter than here), then suggest that they keep the film on.

Upon turning on the unit, it takes about 45 seconds for the pictures to come on which I'm not quite sure if it is a function of the TV or attributable to AT&T; Uverse. Other TVs in the house does not exhibit this symptom so I'll say it's the TV.When starting, it does a picture resolution selection but the highest resolution I've been able to watch on this TV is in 1080i even though I have HD programing through AT&T; Uverse. 1080p may be available though when watching Blue Ray movies.The 3D feature looks funky. You see double images and would kind of IMAGINE the 3D environment for one to make sense out of the picture, compared to Samsung back lit 3D LED which uses a different 3D format.Out of the box, the system is a little hard to configure and setup. Certain things are not explained. The picture that shows up on the screen is a small 12x12 inch window in the middle of the screen. I don't know why Toshiba did that. I'm not sure how I got rid of it.Finally and this is the most important: The unit does not have analogue Audio/Video output for connection to say home entertainment center. If you are planing to connect AV out to Home Theater through this TV, you may disappointed. Connection to another AV receiver is however available through HDMI. Enough about the negative sides.What I like about this Toshiba unit are:Its razor thin thickness, nearly mounts flush to the wall. Problem is if you ever have to go back to plug in a USB thumb/Flash drive to browse your pictures, you may have a hard time sticking your fingers in that tiny space between the wall and the back of the TV. Not a problem for tabletop mounted or if you used a wall bracket that protrude from the wall.The WIFI feature enables you to connect the unit to your home network for Youtube, Pandora, Yahoo Widget browsing etc. Wired LAN is also available too.The touch screen power button at the right-bottom of the unit that you have to slide your fingers over to turn it on/off if for some reason you cannot find your remote. It's lit at system bootup but nearly invisible after bootup. You have to know that it's there or you may not find it.

The remote works ok and does connect to other brands. In my case it works just fine with various models of the VISIO blue ray players.  Now the not so good. The sound is ok but the built in speakers have little or no bass output.Also there is no analog sound out so headphones or older amplifiers can't be connected. Some of the menus are a bit buried. Not awful but not at your fingertips either.  And finally the bad. Don't plan on connecting to the internet with this TV if you use Apple computers and connect via AT&T.;  I am pretty tech savvy and ,while I did manage to connect one time via ethernet, wireless is a totally lost cause.

Nor incidentally could at&t; although the odds that something might be done there are much higher as AT&T;'s support system is ... not the best.

The picture looks fine, and just what I've been expecting. I didn't test the 3D because I don't have a 3D bluray player. just think it'll be nice to have the 3D feature now and reserve it. However it will not recognize our home wireless network after trying an hour to hook it up. I'm a tech person so if I can't get it done, nobody will. It simply can't find the wireless N signal for some reason. Switching to 802.11b didn't help either. I'm completely puzzled. Finally I decided to hook it up with the good old ethernet cable, since the wireless router is only 5 feet away.The biggest problem I found is it takes about 15 to 20 seconds to turn on. You press the power button, and the light will begin to flicker then steady, but the picture will not appear. This delay is annoying but ok since I only turn it on a few times a day. However when you switch channel from a HD to a SD channel, it takes another 15 seconds to show the picture. The TV screen is completely dark during this period. Since some of my favorite channels are SD, I have to switch channels maybe 10 times a day. That's excruciating. Think I'm too impatient? Well, if I lose 3 minute a day waiting for the channels to switch, over a period of 10 years I'll lose 7 whole days of my life sitting there waiting for the channels to switch.

In fact, it is OMG fabulous!The longer I have this TV in my home the more I love it. The picture is so pristine and the sound so crystal clear it's like a little piece of heaven in my living room.Set up was easy. I connected it to my computer to watch Netflix movies with no problem. The cord I ran from my computer to the TV is the highest quality one I could find to eliminate the ghosting effect. The ghosting problem often happens when the signals from the computer or other source aren't running smoothly or in unison.Since I don't have, nor do I want, cable I have a Terk HDTV antenna. This antenna brings in an excellent HD signal as evidenced by the eye popping images that appear on the screen of this TV.I read several reviews mentioning glare so I put my TV in an area where window glare wouldn't be a problem and made sure my lamps were positioned so light reflected from them wouldn't be a problem. Gave me an excuse to rearrange my living room.I'm not down with all the electronics techo lingo and particulars others have talked about in their reviews. But, I do know a great picture when I see it. And I've been mesmerized by what I see on this TV since getting it set up. Someone might think I've never seen a TV before. Don't have 3D glasses or the 3D Blu-ray player...yet...but, I am impressed with what I'm seeing 2D. Still, I think they should throw in one or two pairs of 3D glasses with the TV.Hooking up my standard DVD player was not an issue. This surprised me since I thought this type of TV would only play Blu-ray DVDs. The standard DVD movies look so pristine on screen.The sound is really good and can be adjusted to your liking. I plan on getting a surround sound system.If you think the price of the TV is too high, think about all the money you will save staying home watching movies on it and enjoying a dinner you cooked, or popcorn you popped in your microwave instead of paying a zillion bucks to go to a restaurant for dinner, then to a theater to see a movie, and buying popcorn with a drinks for everyone. And, hey, let's not forget the money you'll save on gas not driving to the movies or wanting to leave your home anymore than you have to.Honestly, I don't know how they can make a TV with a picture and sound any better than what this Toshiba offers except to actually beam the actors and the studio set or stage directly into your home to perform personally for you.Some friends were staying with me while they were in town.

First of all, I bought this after returning a 55\" Samsung 3D LED that had horrible white clouding/backlight issues, but that had an awesome picture.  The picture quality on this Toshiba is good, but not as good as the Samsung, and although the clouding exists it isn't as bad.  After trying it out for a few weeks I've decided to return it.  I'm going to give up on LED technology...I know many people probably have good units or don't notice the backlighting, but these TVs are too expensive to have an issue that distracts from the picture.  Obviously manufacturing don't quite have LED figured out...at least not on the lower end models.  That's too bad.I'm returning this for a couple of reasons1)The backlighting although not significant is still present in the corners and center of TV, which is too distracting to me2)As several have mentioned the reflection on this TV is insane...almost like looking into a mirror.  I have this in a basement theater room, which is dark, but during the day or with lights on watching this TV becomes a pain.3)the screen is difficult to clean!  A few have mentioned this too...I got a minor smudge on this and can't get it clean.  I don't get it.4)THE 3D HAS ISSUES.  Like others mentioned something just isn't right with the 3D on this TV.  The picture quality is reduced and in some cases I could still see double images.  On the Sansung I tried a few weeks ago, the 3D was great. So I had another TV to compare to.  Don't know if it's the TV or the Glasses, but somethings off.P.S.  Price on this was great and I got a deal with 6 free 3d glasses.

We placed one on the TV stand and the other in front on the floor to compare, and played the same blu ray at the same time. At first the Toshiba looked better and was noticeably brighter, but as we watched more scenes the Panasonic started to look better and definitely wins for shadow detail as well as color accuracy. The motion was also much smoother on the Panasonic. We tested the TVs using Despicable Me (3D and 2D), and when any of the characters were moving quickly the Toshiba looked choppy or a little garbled (240Hz mode on). Neither TV was calibrated, so results may vary. I have a calibration DVD for picture, but didn't get that far because of the 3D picture quality. 3D picture quality (at least with Despicable Me) was horrible. There was so much ghosting that we didn't think the glasses were on. We know that the glasses work, though, because coincidentally Panasonic and Toshiba use the same 3D technology and their glasses work on each others sets. The Toshiba 3D glasses are very comfortable, and I prefer them over the included Panasonic glasses (very uncomfortable) and the rechargeable Panasonic (comfortable, but not nearly as much as Toshiba's). There's a chance that the Toshiba TV is defective, but some scenes looked decent so I doubt it. We'll be returning the TV due to the 3D picture quality (we may keep the Toshiba glasses though because they worked better and felt more comfortable than the Panasonic). If properly calibrated the 2D picture quality would be pretty good, and if you like a brighter picture it may be better than the top rated Panasonic. The last items to note about this TV are that the screen is very reflective and the TV appearance looks amazing. It looks about as good as any TV could when it's off, and the screen is reflective enough to clearly see yourself in the TV (lines aren't even blurred).

It does in fact take much longer than my old Samsung to change channels, very annoying (I don't know what the other review was talking about -- I think they were comparing it to another Toshiba?). One of the main reasons I chose this TV is because of the internet/streaming functionality -- so I could avoid needing another network/media player. However, the Netflix app seems very primitive -- it can only view films from your instant queue (no browsing of genres, selecting other movies like other TV netflix apps have). It has no support for Hulu, which most other internet TVs have. I tried the DLNA functionality with a few DLNA servers and it refused to play any content saying 'media not supported' (the same servers played content fine on my Samsung). The TV even identifies itself in my DLNA server log with 'Intel DLNA SDK' or something, like the software engineers didn't even bother to change the identifier. This is all with the most recent firmware update, by the way. In the end, even if the TV does look nice, I couldn't stand the software long enough to even test the picture.

I was upgrading from a 46\" LCD Samsung I have been very happy with, did the white glove delivery from Amazon almost three years ago, but was ready for a larger tv in a larger space.  The disappointment arrived today.  The 'we cant find your house' call from The Deliverance delivery guys was the first bad sign, then they told my wife who was home they were just going to put it in the garage.  I get home excited to set it up and right out of the box there is a dent on the back bottom side from where it was dropped at some point.  I get the DirecTV box hooked up to it after I figure out the TV mount on my own because the manual is no help on that, then the Toshiba remote doesn't even work.  I try every AA battery I have including the ones included with the remote, and the AUX button is the only one that lights up.  I finally program a DirecTV remote to work with the TV and am extremely disappointed in the picture quality.  It is supposed to process faster and be crisper at 240 hz 1080p ... but it looks like my friend's DLP and the speed lags/drags when I watch sports.  A highlight of a touchdown, the ball is a blur???? This was supposed to be my NFL playoff and super bowl TV, but it is going back and I will stick with Samsung who I have been happy with on two LCDs.", "Date": "January 13, 2011"}, {"Title": "its ok not great", "Author": "Rambler \"rabbit brain\"", "ReviewID": "R1QLD7UYDRYUMZ", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "Con-No 3D glasses come with the TV.  -When I turn the TV on, it takes 20 seconds before the picture shows up  -My Tv does wobble quite easily if touched.
