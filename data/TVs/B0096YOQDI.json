{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Great TV/ Great Price", "Author": "Sam", "ReviewID": "R387J6498RTREW", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This is a very nice TV at a nice pricepoint at $598. The picture quality and audio quality are both above my expectations. Barely anyone can tell the difference between 60Hz and 120 Hz, and I don't feel that paying the extra is worth any more in picture quality. Vizio is a quality company, based in California. This TV is to replace a Samsung 52 in LCD that stopped working (flickering continuously on-off) in past weeks. From a quick look at Samsung at online forums, it seems all models of Samsung are prone to this type of failure, and I simply did not want to go back to a company that disappointed me. A TV should last until you are ready to replace it with a new one.As for this not being a Smart TV, it is pretty clear it is not a Smart TV from doing your due diligence beforehand. Regardless, I look at the new technology of smart TV's as just another useless addition that increases the chance of it failing prematurely. This is a great TV if you don't need the Smart TV option.Overall, it is a quality TV.

There were white lines being made down the left side of the screen. I got it replaced and so far the new one hasn't done that, but I don't think it has been 20 days yet.However, it does have one issue. The bottom 1/5th of the screen flickers. Certain colors make this more apparent. Blue seems to make it most obvious. So far, this doesn't really bother me, but if it gets worse I may have a problem. The first TV that I replaced did NOT have this new ones problem, so it seems that there are a variety of issues this TV may have, but I figure that's the price of paying less for a great TV.Other than this the TV more than meets my expectations and as long as it doesn't get worse I will keep it and enjoy it, knowing it is well worth the price.EDIT 2/12/2013The problem DID indeed get a bit worse, so I am returning and trying yet again, hoping the next one has no issues, at least for the month I'm allowed to return it in. Geez, hope nothing happens after that period with next one. I really don't want to try any other kind of TV, as this one has the picture I want, when it works perfectly haha.

It is HUGE! The picture is so crisp and clean and the colors just POP!. The sound is excellent. My husband and I purchased this brand because we had a 32\" VIZIO when they first came out about 6 years ago. It was a flat screen when flat screens first were becoming popular. To this day, that 32\" television is WONDERFUL. Just as crisp and great sounding as when we first purchased it. We chose to buy a 50\" to upgrade our tv to a bigger size. We couldn't have asked for a better prouct. I highly recommend VIZIO  to anyone wanting a wonderful. television at a great price.The delivery company that Amazon used were very professional. The men brought the televsion in and removed it from the box, set it up for me and made sure it was in good working order before leaving.  I was able to connect my HDMI cables and my cable box with no trouble at all.I called VIZIO  to register my television and ask a few tech questions and the gal I spoke with was very helpful, knowledgable and extremely friendly and customer service oritented.

Then every time I shut the TV off, it would not remember the settings. So, I called the company and a Vizio AMERICAN based representative helped me reset the TV and it was all fixed. Since then I discovered that the problem was really my cables.  Although, even with my older bad cables I could still adjust it to a decent picture, it now looks really good even with my old DVD player, VCR and composite WII input.  However, I would be careful not to buy this one for a small room unless you are going all HD, because it will probably look a little grainy.  My room is fairly large and so I have no issues with this, I could just see it being a problem for some if you are too close to it.

(Title as of 11/19/12 states: VIZIO E500AR 50-inch 1080P Ambient Light Sensor 120Hz Smart LCD HDTV) The E502AR is a smart TV (note the single number difference in the model number - 500 vs 502), but somehow Amazon has the E500AR listed as a smart TV at the smart TV price (this used to be $598, now it's $679... hmmm). It was in my cart while I researched options and I was notified that the price increased... funny enough the price jumped from the $598 price for the 500, to $679 (which happens to be the price for the 502 on Vizio's website).Also, thanks to Amazon's incorrect listing title I accidently ordered the wrong one. When the price on this one jumped, I found it on another website (store that rhymes with ball mart) for what I thought was still the $598 price for the SMART tv. WRONG! It's NOT a smart TV, and now I have the hassle of returning this one and now I can't find the E502AR anywhere (after deeper searching it is out of stock at ball mart and Amazon only has the 500).IF YOU WANT A SMART TV THIS IS NOT IT! DON'T BE CONFUSED BY THE SIMILIAR ITEM NUMBERS AND DECEIVING ITEM TITLE! To get this same TV, but have it actually be a smart TV you need the 502. Check Vizio's website for all the differences (and good luck finding the 502!).Amazon, PLEASE correct this error. This TV should NOT be listed as a smart TV, and should only be $598.
