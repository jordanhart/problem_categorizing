I think I paid about $200.00 for it. When I got so sick of it I couldn't stand it anymore I bought a 19\" Magnavox for $167.00. It is not the price though that made me hate this TV. Its all the little things. Like the DVD player that quit after 3 months. And things that you take for granted like the \"TV Guide\" feature it doesn't have. And when you change channels with the  up/down channel keys, you have to wait for each channel to come in before going to the next; very annoying. Its been awhile since I threw this TV out, but I kept thinking to myself I should warn others. So please, do not waste your money on this.", "Date": "April 7, 2014"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": null, "Features": null, "Name": null, "ImgURL": null, "ProductID": "B005D5TSY6"}}
