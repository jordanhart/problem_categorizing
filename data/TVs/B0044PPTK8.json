I purchased this TV as well as a multi-regional DVD player to watch PAL DVDs while living in the US.  An adaptor plug needs to be purchased if living in the US. Once I had an adaptor plug and an HDMI cable, the TV setup was easy.  The color is good, the picture is crisp and I'm thoroughly enjoying it.  An amplifier would help the sound quality.  That may be my next purchase.", "Date": "June 7, 2012"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "$649.74", "Features": "Sony 40BX400 40\" Multi-System LCD HDTV\nThe Sony KLV-40BX400 40\" Multi System LCD TV is notable for its ability to receive local programming anywhere in the world.\nFor starters, the KLV-40BX400 delivers Full HD in 1080p (1920 x 1080) resolution for an incredibly crisp picture.\nSony includes multiple sound modes, including Dynamic/Standard/Clear Voice and surround sound to ensure that you're a part of the action\nIt's a snap to access all of its features through its graphic user interface and full-featured remote control", "Name": "Sony 40 \" Multisystem TV KLV-40BX400 Pal NTSC 110 220 volts 50 60 hz", "ImgURL": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/5156Rrc%2BnCL._SX300_.jpg", "ProductID": "B0044PPTK8"}}
