Even when I bought my last tv, it was just months before the broadcasts signals went digital.  However, I only used it to watch movies from our dvd and video tape collection.  I stopped watching broadcast tv years before.About two months ago, TigerDirect had this HDTV advertised for $399 w/ an additional $50 mail-in-rebate.  I bought it on the spot.  (Two (2) days later MicroCenter advertised this same set for $350 without the hassle of the m.i.r.)*** ***  ***Westinghouse offers several similar 46\" HDTV's.  So, be careful which one you choose. I don't have any experience with the others so I'm not offering performance-comparison, just the features and the performance of the \"DW46F1Y1.\"*** Inspection ***This tv is relatively lightweight for a big tv.  Our UPS carrier, a woman of smaller stature had no problem lifting this big box out of the truck.  If I had to guess, it's no more than 30 lbs.  And, the weight is evenly balanced, so it doesn't feel heavier than it really is.Viewing angle:  46\" diagonally/ 1080P- 120Hz (refresh rate)Height: 24.5\"Length: 42\"Width: 3.5\"Weight: ~30 lbs.Surround Speaker: \"TruSound HD Stereo\"Bezel: 1\" beautiful, black piano-lacquered frameFour (4) Picture modes: User, Standard, Dynamic and MovieFour (4) Audio modes: User, Standard, Movie and MusicLeft side--HDMI port #3Right (Audio) In portLeft (Audio) In portVideo In portBack side--RF- (Radio Frequency) InCoaxial InComponent video output (Y, Pb + Pr)HDMI #2HDMI #1Service In (USB outlet)*** Performance as a secondary computer monitor ***I bought this primarily to serve several functions and not a sole television receiver.  Because this HDTV has HDMI built in, I was able to directly connect it to my iMac.  This configuration enables me to extend my computer screen landscape by 46\".  Plus any media, whether native on the harddrive or streaming via an internet connection means, I would have the space and the resolution.As you'll see in the clip, as I worked on the left, I was streaming Terminator 2 from Netflix.  The picture was impressive.  The native sound on the tv is okay.  Just okay.  Nothing extraordinary.  But, I have a great pair of JBL speakers that I used in place of my computer's native speakers.  Because the Westinghouse is now an extension of the computer, the video file streaming from the computer and played on the TV also has the JBL as the default speakers.*** Performance as a HDTV--Playstation 3 ***I don't play games but a neighbor was kind enough to let me borrow his son's PS3 and I played this game for about an hour.  In the video, the HD resolution was breathtaking.  No lag, no artifacts and the relatively small bezel meant that you had a clean space to work with.*** Performance as a HDTV--films: DVD & Bluray ***If the gameplay was enough to sell me, seeing the difference in my favorite film, The Lord of The Rings as viewed from the standard dvd and the Bluray version, it was a done deal.Even with a Bluray player that upscales dvd's, occasionally, you'll see some residue/ artifacts with films on dvd, however, remastered film on Bluray looks absolutely phenomenal.  That's particularly true when comparing the opening sequence of The Two Towers.I apologize for the video clips not being anywhere near capturing the visuals on the tv, I'm working with a small 720 video cam and I'm limited by its capabilities.*** Related recommendations ***MC/ Visa-- Retailers that have a brick and mortal footprint, if the sale price is the sale as their online price and if you pay with a Mastercard or Visa, they (the credit/debit card) company will double the manufacturers warranty under their Buyers Protection clause.  So, if you decide on any electronics, it's especially important to keep the receipts.Warranty extra--Inside the bundle, you're encouraged to take out an extended warranty from Square Trade.  They said, the offer is good for 30 days, but when I reached Square Trade by phone they actually said, on HDTV's it's 90-days until the insurance offer disappears.  So, a three (3) ext warranty for $66 seems like a good deal.*** Conclusion ***+ Versatile as a standalone HDTV, gaming monitor or as external computer monitor.+ Screen is vibrant.+ Very thin bezel.+ 3 HDMI inputs and older ports (for analog equipment)+ 4 preset Visual modes+ 4 preset Audio modes+ Price--keep an eye out for sales, it occasionally drops to $375 (not including s/h)+ Lightweight.  Can easily move around.- Speakers could have been better.  (Recommend that you purchase a quality 5.1 theatre system, especially for Blu-ray discs.)For a name brand unit that sells for the same price as \"no name/ generic\" brands, this is an outstanding price.  And, the picture is MUCH better than the big box offerings.5 stars.", "Date": "June 19, 2013"}, {"Title": "Ug", "Author": "Captredbeard \"Techie\"", "ReviewID": "RTU50P9L6IN9E", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "Took a chance on this since there are so few reviews out there.1.

It's been three days and no word back from Westinghouse, I have a tv that can't watch tv.2.  All four corners are dark.  My guess is they over-corrected the edge lit issue that make it too light in the corners, but they went too far the other way and now every bright scene has four dark corners for about 2 inches.3.

The product quit working after thirteen months, which was conveniently right after the one-year waranty expired. Westinghouse promised to have their customer service people contact me, but they never did; so all I really got after spending a long time working through the automated system was lip service.

Exactly 14 months later (just outside our warranty window), the power supply failed on it without warning.  THe TV just turned off and never turned back on again.  We initially bought a new power cord, but it was a component within the TV.  Since the warranty had just expired, we considered a TV repair store, but the cost to replace the defective unit (if that was the case), would have been half the cost of the TV itself, and there was no guarantees it would work even then.I was very disappointed by this-- $500 down the drain. The TV functioned well when it functioned-- clear and nice resolution picture (we never used the sound system). But we should have known better than to go with an \"off\" brand and skimp on the extended warranty. I guess the 'old fashioned' idea that a company should stand behind a product and replace something that breaks is something from the past.", "Date": "June 16, 2013"}, {"Title": "OK", "Author": "Doug Tompkins", "ReviewID": "R1R9YAU01YUHW", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I bought this TV for my bedroom.

It was cheaper than popular brands like LG, Samsung, etc. so I took a chance. The picture quality is poor. My big back old fashioned Toshiba colour TV has better picture quality - by far.
