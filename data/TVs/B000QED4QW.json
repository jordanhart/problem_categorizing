Within 3 weeks it starts to randomly - and frequently - shut itself off. Not just turning itself off but powering all the way down - and won't come back on for hours. Again, I thought \"aggravating, but thank goodness I got the extended service plan\".WRONG! They're giving me the runaround (company is \"NEW\" - Amazon lets these crooks advertise right next to these products). Maybe it will all resolve - but in the meantime, I have no TV. So buy yourself the good name brand and save yourself the considerable aggravation. The Haier brand is suppose to be big in Europe. Europe may come pick up this TV at any time!Well, it's over two weeks later - finally got a call back (they're suppose to return your call in 24 to 36 hours). I called 9 times. Extended warranty won't cover because it's still covered by the manufacturer warranty. So they (Haier) have me describe the trouble (TV's stone-dead) and then they order the part they think it might be - nobody comes out to look at the set. It takes 7 to 21 days for the part (if it's the right guess?) to come in. Then they're suppose to come out and install - and hopefully it works - hopefully I described \"dead\" well? Run! Do not walk from this TV.", "Date": "May 27, 2008"}, {"Title": "Menu screen issues", "Author": "A. Walter", "ReviewID": "R377082U1OIFO5", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I bought this tv February 10, 2008.  At first, I loved it.  But yesterday the menu screen started popping up randomly and frequently.  I did some troubleshooting but it's still there.  I tried contacting Haier but ended up leaving a message because I didn't want to wait on hold all day.  A tv is pretty worthless if you can't watch anything because the menu screen is up half the time.", "Date": "March 24, 2008"}, {"Title": "We love it!", "Author": "B. Showalter", "ReviewID": "R375NN0O36ODHV", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "We bought our tv in January 2008 and now its October 2008 with absolutely no problems at all.  We even moved 1200 miles in that time and I had to pack it up and load it into a U-Haul.  It made it out just fine and is working like brand new.  If it's left without any input for a period of time (like your dvd player was playing and is now off) it will turn off automatically, but I have no problem turning it right back on and have actually found that pretty convenient that it does that.  I read lots of reviews from the 32 inch Haier HDTV before I bought this one because no one had reviewed this one yet.  I waited to review but we've had it for 9 months now and it works like it was brand new.****UPDATE****It is now December of 2011 and this TV is still going strong! My husband and I have since upgraded to a larger set and gave this one to our son. He uses it all the time and no problems at all.  It was a great purchase and is still fabulous.", "Date": "October 2, 2008"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "$969.99", "Features": "HDTV ATSC/NTSC Tuner\n2 HDMI Inputs\nResolution 1366x762\n3D Comb Filter\n2 Component Inputs\nHDTV ATSC/NTSC Tuner with 37 inch LCD display", "Name": "Haier HL37S 37-Inch LCD HDTV ATSC Tuner", "ImgURL": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51DptvKEeyL._SX300_.jpg", "ProductID": "B000QED4QW"}}
