I cannot think of a better TV for a second TV.  One wouldn't suffer too much if this were the only TV.  It allows for an easy change in configuration so your screen can always be full and the figures in proportion and does this much better than our first line set while costing just a fraction of that set's price.  The picture is great and the sound from the speakers is  more than acceptable.  It is just hooked to standard cable, but I ran a tuner scan and found some local broadcasts at 1080i.  I do not understand why this brand is not found more easily and widely.", "Date": "December 7, 2013"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "Unavailable", "Features": "TV Type: LED-LCD\nScreen Size Class: 32\"\nVertical Resolution: 720p\nMaximum Resolution: 1366 x 768\nScreen Refresh Rate: 60Hz", "Name": "Hiteker 32\" LED-LCD 720p 60Hz HDTV | E32V7/WT", "ImgURL": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/31CaCChEeXL._SY300_.jpg", "ProductID": "B00DO33SL8"}}
