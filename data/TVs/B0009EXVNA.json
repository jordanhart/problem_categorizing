I was a bit concerned about loss of contrast to ambient light but am pleased to discover almost no change in the way the picture looks day or night. If you buy this set be sure and spend an extra 150-200 bucks on an upconvert DVD player, the difference it will make on your current DVD collection will blow you away!  The set does a nice job with standard definition signals as well, always a concern with so little HD programming currently available.  I work in the home theater department of a major electronics retailer and did my homework before deciding which set I'd spend my money on. This set won hands down over any of the other currently available models. It looked great on the showroom floor but it looks even BETTER in my home.  My neighbor across the  street has a 42 inch plasma and it's nice, but i can't wait to show him this 50 inch beauty! I think he'll be a little jealous,  especially when he hears what I paid compared to what he shelled out for his plasma ;) If you're looking to go HD, this is definitely the way to go, more screen for your buck and a picture that will make even the most uninitiated viewer gasp.", "Date": "June 11, 2005"}, {"Title": "AWESOME!", "Author": "J.

The picture is great for DVDs (progressive scan) and for HDTV--we get a number of channels over the air, using a standard antenna, and cannot imagine going back to normal TV. Analog cable is okay, but I wouldn't buy an HD TV if that was the bulk of what I watched.When the TV was shipped, there was a slight blemish on the screen; I'm not sure if that occured during shipping or was a manufacturing defect.

I got the 4-year on-site Extended Warranty at Best Buy for $300 when we bought it and I'm glad we did.  Since this is a relatively new technology, there are bound to be problems that slowly get worked out with each new series that's released.  Last March (at the start of March Madness no less), our screen started randomly freezing with a black and white image on the screen that looked like a photo negative.One call to Best Buy and within a couple of days, a service guy came out and said he had to replace the digital board...We could still watch TV, but just had to shut it down and boot it back up whenever the screen froze...Sometimes 2-3 times a day, sometimes no times a day.  Once the new board arrived and was installed ($292.95 parts + $150 labor), it worked like new for about another month when it did the SAME thing again!This time a different service guy came out and installed a brand new light engine AND digital board ($1,303.72 parts + $150 labor)...Basically ALL NEW GUTS in the TV!  They're the latest version too because he actually had difficulty getting the ports/jacks to line up properly between the new guts and old back cover.  That's when he said they don't make the older parts anymore, since they've made improvements in the technology and use those when repairs are needed...Sounded good to me, so I bought into it!One thing's for sure...The picture has never been better on this screen with both Std Definition and our DirecTV HD feed and OTA Zenith Silver Sensor HD local channels.  So why would I give a product 5 stars when we experienced such problems with it?It's easy...This set delivers a stunning large picture that never degrades (mechanically) over time, and it was $3,200 new when 42\" plasmas were $7,000 to $8,000.  In another 3-4 years, those plasmas will be worthless and we'll just put a new bulb in our DLP and it'll look good-as-new!  Technical difficulties with new technologies should not be unexpected, but rather anticipated...Thus, the reason for purchasing an extended warranty.After more than 1-1/2 years of viewing enjoyment, our $300 warranty paid for $1,900 of brand new parts, including improved technology!  It's like insurance...You don't want to use it, but if you do NEED it, you don't want to find yourself without it.  Since this 50\" DLP is now only $1,800, you should seriously consider it the front-runner in any large screen HDTV purchase comparison.  Don't just consider what you get in picture quality NOW, but what will you still be enjoying several years from now after your neighbor's plasma with multiple screen burn-ins finally gives up the gas and goes screen up in the landfill!", "Date": "December 20, 2005"}, {"Title": "Excellent TV", "Author": "C.

I then added Digital Cable using the cable card.  Without a set top box my cable bill went down (part of a roadrunner and digital package).  The picture quality on HD broadcasts make you feel like you are in the room with the people on screen.  The standard analog channels look poor.  The large screen only accentuates the poor signal quality provided by the cable company.BTW- Time Warners definition of \"digital cable\" is approximately 30 digital channels and the other 50 (?) are analog.  Hopefully over time this will improve.DVD movies vary in quality from excellent to okay.

The cabinet is not distracting from the picture as I find the case with other sets.  Every connection imaginable available and easy to do.  Overall I'm very happy with this set.  Now there is a little story - When the TV arrived the hurried delivery team unpacked the set, put it on the floor and turned it on to prove that it was working.  The set came on and a menu was displayed.  Satisfied that the set was working, the delivery team turned it off, and I accepted the TV.  Little did I know that the unit would not stay on for more than 20 seconds without automatically shutting down.  The troubleshooting guide was not able to help me diagnose the problem so I called Samsung.  The Samsung sets come with a 1-year IN HOME warranty.  The in-home part is uncommon with other manufacturers.  I simply had to schedule 1 hour out of my day (they were able to come the next business day) to meet the Samsung service agent.  They replaced the entire inside of the TV and it now works great.  I'm unsure if the set got damaged during shipping, but the in-home service was a breeze.  I now have essentially a brand-new unit.  Samsung was a good deal.  So the lesson being - keep your unit on for a few minutes when it is delivered, and buy Samsung (or another with similar warranty) and protect yourself.  These are delicate units and even a little jostle can shake things to broke.Originally purchased and reviewed in Aug. 2005Updated Jan 2007 - Still performing great.  Set has never required maintenance or a new bulb.  This was a great purchase, I continue to be impressed with this units picture.BIG UPDATE SEPT 2008 - After a short life, my tv now 3 yrs and 3 months old with very minimal usage (avg. 15 min/day - I'm away a lot)is dead in the water.  Light engine is the suspect.  Minimum $800-$1200 to repair, no service center close to me.  So, same TV new is only $1200.  What choice do I really have.  Essentially, I have to write off the TV.  I'm so utterly disappointed with this product.  No TV should cost you $800/year to own.  Samsung no help - out of warranty of course they feel no accountability to taking my money and giving me 3 years for that kind of money - no value.  This is the 2nd time the TV is broken, and both times the entire inside needed replacing.  Never even go to replace a bulb.

Upon exchanging the set for another identical set, the problem still exists on the new one, leading me to believe this is a problem on all of this model.  The Samsung web site says that a 1/2\" deviance is \"acceptable\", so if you have the same problem, don't expect the manufacturers warranty to help.  The pincushion problem is not nearly as noticeable in 16:9 format, but if you can't stand the stretching of a 4:3 signal to 16:9, this will be an issue for you as well.The remote control looks like something out of the '80s.  It is functional, but for a big screen TV, you expect more.  I suggest the Harmony remote control, and just toss the stock remote control in a drawer for emergencies.When I spend over 2000 bucks on something, I expect perfection, but did not get it with this set.The Good:-- crisp, bright widescreen pictureThe Bad:-- archaic remote control-- slightly concave screen causes pincushion deviance of anywhere from 1/8\" to 1/4\", very noticable in 4:3 modeUPDATE 1/27/2006:After a few months of owning this tv, I started noticing smudge marks on the set that were not on the front of the picture; these only occured while the picture was a white or very bright color.  I called Samsung after seeing this was a common problem on their support site.  Within a few minutes of talking ot the operator, I had a number of a local shop that is certified to do Samsung repairs.  They were over at my house after about a week.  The repairman replaced the entire engine and ordered a new screen.  After another few weeks, after a replacement screen was obtained by the repair shop, the screen has been replaced.  All of this was done at no extra cost to me, but did take about 3 weeks total to get fixed (not really Samsungs fault).The concave shape of the screen that I complained about in the review is now gone.  My main complaint is that both of the sets that came out of the factory were faulty in one way or another.  I am put off by the low quality coming out of the factory, but when you have this TV with a flat screen and a new engine, it looks pretty darn good.", "Date": "September 13, 2005"}, {"Title": "Read the fine print before ordering TVs from Amazon", "Author": "MBert", "ReviewID": "RQ3B9KFP36LWX", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "Be aware of Amazon's return policy before you order a large TV.I purchased the Samsung DLP 50\" TV from Amazon and was delivereda broken piece of equipment.

I researched quite a bit before settling on DLP and then on this particular model.One negative, it only has one HDMI input. I can't understand this, obviously I need at least a TV input and a DVD input. Why not two HDMI inputs? There's probably a good reason that I'm not aware of, but it seems odd. I'm not even sure if other TVs have multiple HDMI jacks, I'm purely speculating.But let me comment on HDTV in general:1. Its incredible. The picture is spectacular. I'll watch just about anything that's in HD. I have about 8 HD channels, and I mostly ignore all the other channels. A couple nights ago a buddy and I realized we were watching ice skating. The TV is that good. Football is spectacular. I'm sure the Winter Olympics will be awesome, World Cup Soccer, Stanley Cup, NASCAR, playoff baseball,...2. When you spend the time and cost to get one of these, set it up right -- don't just plug it in. You need to get the right video cable (HDMI, DVI, or component all work fine, this is critical), and you need to page thru simple menus on the TV, cable box, satellite box, DVD player, game console, etc.. Don't spend the money and then set it up wrong. Its not hard at all, but if you skip this, you've wasted your time and money.3. If you watch DVDs, you need a progressive scan DVD player to see the best picture. Don't bother with upconverting.4. If you're ready to buy and are paralyzed by anticipation of the next great model and the next big sale, pull the trigger immediately. I wasted a year before finally making the purchase. The DLPs looked great a year ago and cost about the same. Now they're a little better. A year from now they'll be better still. Stop waiting, just buy it. You'll be so glad you did.5. Before you buy a TV, DVD player, and cables, check for sure that you're doing it right. Draw it out if you have to with connections between devices.

Despite it having the latest chip and increasing the color wheel speed from 7000 rpm to 10,000 rpm, the rainbow-effect is still very much there (esp. when watching at night). Dark scenes (Lord of the Rings) seem to amplify it.The best I can explain the rainbow effect is when you move your eye quickly from one point on the screen to another point (natural due to subject matter being watched), there's a quick flash of green,blue,red silhouette of the image you were watching, like a ghost effect.If I strain my eye to keep it from happening, it makes it worse. I found that if I relax and just focus in the center of the screen, it goes away (until you start watching TV like you normally do, which is moving your eye with the subject matter).It's even noticeable from when I'm cooking in the kitchen and my head turns around with the tv in the background. I get flashes of color in my peripheral vision. I guess this is why it makes some people sick to the point of throwing up.I'm really IMPRESSED with the picture quality that the DLP produces, but this flaw is quite hard to ignore. My wife and I are going to give it 30 days to see if we can live with it or not. We really want to keep the TV!!! The TV can be watched in the brightest of environments with natural sunlight. The imgages are still better than plasma or LCD (in my opinion).

But, with every big purchase and life changing event (SD->HDTV) a small amount of advice before taking the plunge would have made things go a lot smoother, so let me tell all of you who are thinking about buying this TV a bit of the details that I had to figure out on my own.First, as an owner of a PS2 I was not very happy about the review here that stated the 5067W had a full second delay when using a console.  After further research I found that most DLP sets suffer from this as a result of the time it takes to upconvert the analog signal, but one small bit of information I found made all the difference in the world.  The Samsung set has a GAME mode you can select for any of the various inputs that drastically cuts down on the delay, and to do away with it completely I recommend buying a set of component AV cables for your game system for a full digital to digital signal (plus it looks fantastic).Next,  HDTV... As a DirecTV subscriber I was upset that it would cost me an additional $550-600 to convert my Tivo and dish to an HDTV set, and furious when I found out that only 3 of the four major local channels and five additional total choice stations were available in HD.  In my mind it wasn't worth the money to convert my service to HD for such a small number of channels.  I was also upset when I saw how crummy a SD broadcast looked on the new TV (due to the 640 lines being upconverted to the higher HD resolution of the set... its like taking a low rez photo and magnifying it to twice its size).  The solution?  Buy a $40-50 HDTV Indoor  Over-the-Air antenna!  Having the typical bad/fuzzy experience with bunny ear antennas in the past I was highly skeptical about the quality a simple antenna would produce, especially for HD broadcasts... I thought I was going to be proved right when I plugged in a Terk antenna I bought and tuned to our local Fox station only to see a bad reception with a lot of snow... of course what no one bothered to tell me was stations broadcast HD on a different channel!After fixing that problem we watched our first HD broadcast Monday night (\"24\") and I'm now a believer.  This set is awesome!  HD looks fantastic and our overall experience couldn't be better.  This set has more inputs than I have components, with the VGA input being a personal favorite, allowing me to run my iBook on the TV (crystal clear picture) and using iTunes and iChat at levels I never thought possible.  The remote needs more work, and less TV Guide plugs, but the on-screen menu is a joy to use.I highly recommend this TV and a Terk HDTVa antenna to go with it for local HD broadcasts.", "Date": "March 30, 2006"}, {"Title": "Good Picture, Some usability issues", "Author": "Thomas", "ReviewID": "R1FBNGKEG3SQVD", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "The picture on this TV seems very good.

The TV does all very well.I like the sound from the TV as well.  I am just using the TV's speakers for audio and it sounds great.Some of the features in the menu system are not very intuitive.  For instance, there is a DNIE demo function which shows half the screen with DNIE on and half with DNIE off.  It is not obvious how to set DNIE on or off after you see the demo.Also, The TV lets you create a favorite channels list for use in antenna mode.  It was not obvious how to tell the TV channel up/down buttons to only cycle through the favorite channels.  I hope this is possible otherwise it renders the favorite channels list useless.On other note.  Becareful buying this TV online.  You can not return it if you do.

First, we selected this 720p set because we didn't have any high definition (HD) inputs, and 1080p models were half again more expensive.  The Samsung DLP had good reviews both here and cnet, and it fit nicely in our space.  Though they weren't the cheapest mail order, Amazon was still $300 less than local electronics stores (including shipping) and with a $2k purchase we wanted someone trusted.Second, the ordering, shipping and delivery process couldn't be easier.  The shipping company emailed me with a response number seven days after ordering.  I called them back, gave them directions, we set up a day, they called an hour before, they showed up on time, unpacked the set and took away the packing material.  Clean and easy.TV worked fine straight out of the box.  Ten, count `em, 10 inputs! - 2 RF, 3 composite/S-video, 2 component, 1 VGA, 1 DCMI/DVI, and two 1394 Firewire (one in, one out) ports.  Connected our satellite receiver to the s-video and picture defaults looked very good with a standard definition TV signal.  Widescreen DVDs even better, but DVDs are still not HD.  TVs in general are getting as complicated to setup as computers.  This is part of a home theater with separate Dolby digital amp & 5.1.  With a TV, satellite, VCR, DVD, amp and computer, and all with their own remotes, any installation will not be simple.On a lark, got out an very old rooftop FM antenna (not TV), *laid* it on the ground in the front yard, and connected it.  *Wow*!  A perfect HD picture!  True, the signal strength was not high (we are 43 miles away according to antennaweb.org) but for an non-TV antenna on the *ground* - it still picked up 28 over the air stations, including 3 in HD.  All in all we've very happy with the picture.  There are lots of picture calibration controls if you need then, so far we have not.  I'm off to buy a good UHF TV antenna; all the HD channels here are in the UHF band.Now other things.  The Samsung remote is marginal; it controls the TV fine, but can't control the satellite receiver (*no* codes for satellite receivers are listed in the manual) and is of limited use with our combo VCR/DVD.  Even with the TV some functions take many clicks through a menu to operate, especially the picture-in-picture features.Bottom line: Great picture, great selection of inputs, lots of flexibility in set-up, easy order and delivery process.

Brilliant picture, very good sound, crisp HDTV reception from the built-in tuner when attached to simple rabbit ears (your mileage may vary), and worked great right out of the box.BUT...now that I've finally seen the dreaded \"rainbow effect,\" the picture is starting to drive me crazy, and I'm feeling the first stirrings of high ticket buyer's remorse.When trying to decide between big screen technologies, I went with DLP because of the lower cost, as well as the fact that there was no burn-in risk (and much of my viewing is still in standard 4:3 ratio...I can't stand the squeezed and zoomed efforts to fill a 16:9 screen by artificial means).I'd heard about the \"rainbow effect\" - where viewers see brightly colored rainbow flashes of color - but hadn't noticed the effect in the showrooms where I looked at DLP sets. To understand the \"rainbow effect,\" you need to know that DLP sets - from any manufacturer - can really only display one color at a time across the entire screen. By changing these colored pictures quickly on the screen, your brain artificially perceives the intermediate colors. And the effect is great.But if you move your eyes rapidly, looking from one part of the screen to the other, or if the picture on screen is moving wildly/rapidly, some viewers will see a trailing image in which the individual colors blink into existence. It happens as fast as a strobe light, and many (most?) people can't see it at all. But if you CAN see it, it may significantly reduce your viewing pleasure (my nice way of saying that you may throw your hands over your eyes and scream \"RAINBOWS!!! AIYEEE!\")I watched this set for a week without seeing anything, then I watched \"The Bourne Supremacy\" which is filled with jolting camera work and super-fast cuts. I saw rainbows EVERYwhere.  So my recommendation to anyone considering a DLP purchase is to find a way to spend some real time watching a real movie on the set before buying - not just 10 minutes in a showroom. In fact, take a copy of \"The Bourne Supremacy.\" If you don't see rainbows watching this film, you're home free.Summing up, I'd really say that this Samsung is a 5-star set, but if your eyes and brain pick up on the rainbow effect, you may only get 3-star enjoyment.

Sachan", "ReviewID": "R3TCLX6YXYKOJW", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Here's a feedback which I left for HLP 4663 model TV also. HLRs are older than HLP and HLN models and the feedback below compares HLP/HLN/HLM. It does not has the number of input/output (composite/component etc) since that can easily be found on the product description page.This reviews pretty much applies to all the DLP level TVs from Samsung. I researched for around more than couple of months before finally buying this one.Samsung initially started with HLM/HLN series DLP models which were using HD2 chip from Texas Instruments and the contrast ratio was 1000:1. This performed very well in reviews, quality and black level as compared to Sony LCD rear projection.The next series is the latest on which is HLP xx63 series where xx is the size in diagonal (HLP 4663, HLP 5063). The improvements in this are 7 segment color wheel instead of 6-segment, which gives better color. This also uses 3rd generation chip HD3 which has contrast ratio of 1500:1. The bulb are also better in this one since there were some problems in the earlier version of the TV. This is a great TV, light weight as compared to some other and plasmas.The next series which is out only in 2 models is HLP 5085 and HLP5685. These are also 7-segment color wheel but they have HD2+ chip. This is 4th generation chip and is better than HD3. Its contrast ratio is 2500:1 which should mean better black levels. These are the ones with pedestal which looks cool in the picture but is kinda bulky looking in the store. I'm not sure why this model is not out in 46 inches, may be it doesn't make difference in smaller sizes.Next, 5th generation chip is going to be xHD3 and should give around 4500:1 contrast ratio.Overall, DLPs are better since they have better contrast than plasmas and weigh less. They also don't have a burn-in issue like plasmas. HLP series is the best one till now and Samsung is the oldest player in this.Other manufacturers are also catching up, so this should drive the price down further. good for consumers.Hope this helps and good luck shopping.--------Some more feedback on the picture and input modes after two weeks into the purchase:The contrast ratio of HLN/HLP series are good provided you are watching the TV at the same height. If you watch from slightly above/below or left/right, then you'll see it slightly less bright. Just like a laptop screen behaves, maye slightly better.It has following picture modes:- 4:3 standard definition (SD) cable programming. puts black bars on the side of the picture if you watch it in this mode.- wide mode (16:9). if you watch SD tv on this mode, it'll stretch the picture- panorama mode. stretches only the outside portion of the picture making center of the picture in the correct proporting (aspect ratio) but the sides bit distorted- zoom1/zoom2: they just soom in from the center with different stretching methods.Component inputs (in SD and HD) aspect ratios only have normal and wide options. Normal being a little pinched, while wide is normal.-----Some more feedback after 5 weeks of purchase.I started seeing some problems with the lamp. The manual says that when the bulb/lamp needs replacement, all the three lights on the front switch will start blinking. Atleast couple of times a day, the following was happening:- when I switch on the TV, the lamp will try to bring the picture while the audio was there- after couple of seconds tv will go to standby mode- it'll turn on again after couple of seconds and try to bring up the picture- and go again the loop to standby modesomething this happens 3-4 times and the pictures comes and sometime it just gives up and the tv turns off.I'm glad that I bought the warranty after couple of weeks from Circuit city itself, otherwise lamps are not covered in one year Sammy warranty.", "Date": "December 8, 2005"}, {"Title": "Excellent HDTV and excellent delivery", "Author": "DadofThree", "ReviewID": "R3TW4RU15SWIEB", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I've had my Samsung HL-R5067W for just about two weeks now and it has been a joy.  High-def is bright and clear, with DVDs very close behind.  Setup was easy and the TV worked well out of the box, although I agree with the other reviewer that everyone who spends this much on a TV should spend just a few minutes going through the settings to ensure it's all optimized.The only negative I've noticed: In dark areas that are out-of-focus, there tends to be a fair bit of video noise (pixelation).  Those aren't parts that your eyes typically go to (my wife never noticed until I pointed it out), but on a 50\" screen, it's more noticable.  This isn't a defect - just a side effect of the digital processing.  Other brands might handle it better, but at this bargain price for a 50\" true HDTV, it's a minor picture flaw.  The TV show \"24\" probably shows the most noise because of the camera work and heavy use of dark, out of focus backgrounds.  Shows like \"Without a Trace\" don't blur the background as much and are completely crystal clear - amazing.  Either way, this really is a minor point for me given the great bargain and overall amazing picture of this set.Ultimately, for the cost of a comparable plasma (around $4000) I got:- my Samsung DLP, that I consider to be equal in terms of picture quality- an Onkyo progressive-scan DVD changer- a beautiful HDTV \"console\" from Crate and Barreland ended up with a hefty amount of change left over on top of that.  Hard to beat the value proposition.Amazon.com's delivery service was excellent, by the way.  No problems, communication was great, and I received the TV on a Saturday afternoon (no time off from work!) right on schedule just three and a half days after placing my order!

The TV was in great shape when it arrived and the delivery company unpacked it, moved it to my upstairs room, no questions asked.  How easy!This TV is a great size for the room I've got it in; our sitting area is about 8-10 feet away.  I ordered the HD digital cable from our local provider and...WOW...just incredible on those channels.  Even non-HD channels look good (in 4:3 aspect; I don't stretch it) on most channels.  However some regular cable channels don't look great.  This had been reported by some, like Consumer Reports, saying the picture quality suffered if viewing basic cable inputs.  Fortunately, all those channels have HD versions in our area so I can get over it.  There were absolutely no problems with its use straight out of the box.  No perceivable noise or sounds.  All the pixels seem to work great.  The sound is incredible.  We don't listen to it real loud most of time, so I don't often get the volume much above 10 or 11 (out of 30 or 40?  I don't know; haven't been up that high).  I know some have commented on the remote being confusing, but it turns out we use our digital cable remote to work the TV and so it doesn't matter in our case.There's also discussion about DLP vs LCD vs Plasma.  I was considering comparable Sony's LCD as well, but the price dropped significantly on the Samsung when I was ready to buy, and my amateur eyes couldn't perceive any significant difference between the two, standing in a brick-and-mortar store.  Plasma is the best, of course, but is just too freakin' expensive, and honestly once you get a DLP (or probably LCD) in the house, without a comparative plasma beside it, you'll forget about that comparison, unless you're a video afficionado or need something only 4 inches thin.

I thought TVs were built to last longer than 6 years, but alas, almost 6 years exactly, and my TV is on the brink of dying.  I'm thoroughly upset that I have to shell out more money to buy another TV so quickly.  About half a year ago, my TV starting blacking out randomly - the audio would continue, but the video would completely black out. It was not my lamp needing replacement, because if you turned off the lights in the room, you could see the lamp was still lit. I had to turn off my TV, wait for the lamp to turn off, then turn the TV back on, and it would be okay (if i tried to turn it back on before the lamp turned off, it wouldn't work).  In the beginning this was happening maybe once every few days.  Over the last few months, the frequency has become to the point where it's almost unwatchable. Last night, in the span of 3 hours, it must have blacked out at least 20 times, sometimes 3-4 times in a row (where I would turn off the TV, wait for lamp to turn off, turn back on the TV, video would come back on but black out a few seconds later).  Thank goodness for DVR, but this is not really the way I want to watch football games, or any shows for that matter!  I tried researching my problem, and it seems like it's a very common problem with Samsung TVs, though no one had a solution.

Back in 2005 when I originally bought the TV, Samsung was relatively new to the field, but the ratings were great, so I took a chance and went for it.

Samsung took all my information and contacted a service provider in my area.  The service person was able to come 3 days later and installed a brand new light engine.

When the movers arrived the tv worked fine, but minutes after they left the tv picture froze, displaying a black and white image that looked like a photo negative. This is exactly what Dennis reported. I actually read Dennis' review but dismissed his problem thinking that these problems wouldn't happen to me. I assumed that any problems would show up within the first 10 or 20 minutes. The problem with that assumption is that many of the internal parts work fine until they're heated up, so the initial inspection wont reveal any issues until after the delivery guys have left. Some people may not be aware that Amazon doesn't do returns of tv's 27 inches or larger once the delivery guys leave. I knew this, but took the risk anyway.On the upside, the repairs were covered under the regular factory warranty, I didn't need an extended warranty of any kind. They had to replace the light engine, which would've cost $1350 + labor, but cost me nothing, thankfully. One thing to note is that the light engine and digital board, which break down the most, are generally on back order for several weeks so you may have to wait awhile. Another thing to be aware of is that although I live in Los Angeles where there are several authorize service centers, only one had enough parts on hand to come out and test my tv. They basically replace one component at a time until the problem goes away. So, if a service center doesn't have enough test parts on hand, then Samsung wont send them out. This could increase your wait time even more.One thing that I thought was pretty cool was that Samsung said they would replace my tv if the parts were on back order for more than a few weeks. It never came to that, but it was nice to know.After the repair guy fixed the tv, the regular analog cable signal looked pretty grainy. I should also say that it looked grainy when the delivery guys dropped it off, so it wasn't the repairman's fault. The repair guy told me that the tv is designed to display HD signals, not the regular analog signal. I was kind of disappointed because the local Time Warner Cable charges $60 a month for HDTV, it's not cheap. I naively thought I would get HDTV signals for the major stations (NBC, ABC, CBS, FOX, and WB). He said that regular analog signals would cease by the year 2009, so I'm hoping that at some point I can get basic HDTV for the same price I'm now paying for basic analog cable. Ok, I'm a little cheap, but I'm married and this is what it's like :)I gave it a 4 because even with the initial problems I had, Samsung honored their basic warranty and were pretty prompt, even with their back order problems. The tv is was still worth the $1700 I spent on it (after tax, after Amazon's sale price, their free delivery, the promotional code I found online, and the 1% off from my citibank card). The analog picture wasn't great, but it was good enough for me to await lower HDTV prices. It looks pretty good as a monitor when I'm playing downloaded tv shows from my computer. I can actually read the computer text. I play some emulated Super NES games from my computer and they look great on the 50 inch screen. The speakers are decent, I didn't even hook it up to my surround sound system yet. There are tons of inputs and features which you probably wont even use, but it's nice that they're there, just in case. The tv is fairly light, my wife and I can move it around very easily.

I've seen other complaints of similar behavior online.  Usually the issue is identified as a bad video board that runs ~$800.  Every other TV I've ever purchased has lasted at least 15 years.

DVDs and video games look fantastic on the HL-R5067W.What does not look good, however, is regular definition content.

It happens to be a bit worse with this particular model. On the other side of that, the HD image and DVD/Game picture was superior to the competitors.In summary, if you watch mostly standard definition still, DLP and particularly this set, is probably not for you. Perhaps consider a Plasma since they are now entering this price range. If you watch more higher resolution content or are a console gamer, this is the best DLP I have seen, and the price has really come down since the 1080p sets are out now.The remote control, hd-tuner, sound and osd are all solid and about the same as the competitors.

I was convinced it was the best TV for the money, and that I would be totally happy --- WRONG!Out of the box the TV is impressive despite the white glowing thing in the middle of the screen (only seen when tv is off).  It has something to do with the reflections within... not a big deal.Analog picture sucks, HD is amazing, DVDS  are below average.  Viewing angle is TERRIBLE.Viewing angle is important to me.... ever since I saw those big old projection tv's back in the 90s that basically looked like crap unless you sat dead center infront of it.  We are way to advanced with technology to have limited viewing angles now.That being said........can you see the tv when setting offset--- yes, but it is darker...and not impressive.The noise from the colorwheel/fan REALLY annoyed me.  It was loud sometimes, quiet others, but Samsung assured me this was normal.If you turn this tv off, and then right back on again, it makes a horrific cracking noise that makes me feel like the tv is going to die right there.  I don't know if this is normal.pip is pointless if you have a cable box too... one of the main reasons I got it.  I couldnt get pip with the cable box.But the real problem with this tv, the factor that eventually made me return the TV and get the fantastic Panasonic 50\" plasma (top rated consumer reports plasma which I LOVE AND HIGHLY RECOMMEND!), was that the samsung DLP had SMUDGES/FINGERPRINTS inside the freaking screen!!! I spent 10 minutes trying to clean my screen before i realized they were INSIDE the screen...... give me a break.  I pay $2000+ for a TV that someone compromised with their lucky handprint?  Forget it.... projection tv's just feel weak to me...they seem to have too many moving parts....If you want the best...... Get a Plasma... Burnin???

OTA broadcasts in HD are very nice.  Video games look very nice (especially Xbox 360, intended for HD).HOWEVER, gaming on lesser systems, like gen1 Xbox, PS2, GameCube, etc. will leave you with a half-second lag between the time you do something on the controller and when it actually happens on the screen.  For games where timing is important (most, though some more than others), this is a killer.  It has been said that setting your input to the \"GAME\" label addresses this, but it most certainly DOES NOT.NEXT, today's DVDs are meant for 480p resolution, so they must be upconverted (either by the TV or an upconverting DVD player) to display on this TV.  Even upconverted, many DVDs still look terrible, especially in darker scenes, where you will see all kinds of heavy distortion/blockiness and solid textures that appear to be moving (when they shouldn't be).  I assume (and hope) that once HD-DVD (or Blu-Ray) comes out, those DVDs will look perfect on this TV...  But don't expect it from standard DVDs that exist today.FINALLY, there is an issue of \"video lag\", where the video is a fraction of a second behind the audio (if you send your audio to your receiver for surround sound), creating a lip-sync problem.  It's not ALL the time, but MUCH of the time.  If your receiver has an audio delay feature, this can help, or you can buy a 3rd party audio delay device.  I see these as Band-Aids though, to address a problem in the TV that should not exist.  I feel that if the TV had this kind of issue, then it was not ready to be sold.SUMMARY:  This is a good TV that has potential to look great, but not without upgrading all your other equipment too.  This means potentially new (1) Receiver (for audio delay feature), (2) DVD player (to an upconverting model w/ HDMI, which will still be unsatisfactory in many cases -- hi-def DVD player and movies are the true solution here), (3) Gaming system (that natively supports 720p, so TV does not have to upconvert the signal, which is the supposed cause of the gaming response lag), (4) Cable service (standard cable looks pretty bad on this TV, need HD content) and/or OTA antenna (better results than same channels over HD cable).See this forum BEFORE you buy, it's dedicated to this particular TV, and has LOADS (too much for some) of info, good and bad!

Then the many mechanical parts started failing.  I replaced the bulb once.  No big deal, but it still cost $120 to replace the bulb.  Since the end of 2010 the DLP only would work on the HDMI setting.  My analog channels and other inputs (much like other people said) have green lines going through the screen.  Good bye playing Nintendo Wii after this happened.  Then, about 6 months ago, my HDMI input stopped working and the lamp light would stay on with no picture and then shut off by itself.  I did a lot of research into the causes of the problems.  Basically it seems like the analog and digital boards need to be replaced.  Those cost $500 at least to get both of them new or re-worked.  I obviously wasn't going to do that when I can go buy a LCD (never again buying a Samsung DLP) for that much practically.  I read a lot of forum's and people said to take out the PCB and apply pressure on the DNIE chip on the digital board.  I've been doing that for the past 4 months and it helps for a few days and then fails again.  I then decided to rig something to apply permanent pressure to the chip in the casing because someone suggested that.  That didn't help.  I then thought perhaps I just needed a re-flow of the solder on the digital board to at least get my HDMI working again.  Using a microscope and soldering iron I re-flowed the board.  I did this 4 days ago and expected the worst when I plugged it in.  However, my TV came back to life and it worked solid for 4 days until this morning.  It's back to the same problem of shutting off by itself and now I can't get the picture back.  I've tried everything I can without pumping money into having the problem looked at.  Now the question is, do I store this somewhere in case there's a lawsuit against Samsung?  I really thought this TV since it was so expensive six years ago would last me 15 years minimum with the only addition being adding a new lamp when it burned out.

Especially it is easy to set up.The only thing I am not quit sure is that when I play animated movie, the color of white seems not comfortable for eyes. It looks like there are one layer \"float\" on the screen. But it is hardly visible. When I watch a real movie, everything seems good. My wife prefer Sony.In a word, very good TV, but may not as good as Sony.", "Date": "March 20, 2006"}, {"Title": "Samsung HL-R5067W 50\" HD-Ready DLP TV", "Author": "Steve Murphy", "ReviewID": "R24GHU0HUG52QM", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I am dissapointed in the picture quality.
