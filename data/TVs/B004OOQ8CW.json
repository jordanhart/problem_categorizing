I did contact LG recently about any harmful emissions or radiation that might come from the screen (as I use it quite a bit for both TV viewing and as a PC monitor), wondering if I should buy protective eye gear (I had been using various lens but decided to ask them before I purchased another pair....I had 2 pair break). They wrote back the same day and said that there is virtually no radiation from the screen.End of UPDATE.The set up is fairly easy although I found the manual to be lacking in more detail, especially concerning a better explanation of some of the features.The HD picture is just AWESOME and BEAUTIFUL. I thought the screen might be a little too big for my computer but I was totally wrong....it is just great! I do not have a HDMI connector for the PC, only the RGB, but it is still just outstanding. Hook-up was a matter of just connecting the plugs.The sound is better than good, but not great. (BELOW you will see how I was able to improve it....QUITE A BIT!!)I was going to give it 4 stars because the non-HD channels are just good, and acceptable; but, the more I look at it, I realize it is actually pretty good. So, it warrants 5 stars.I have seen a number of HDTVs, especially in showrooms, and this one seems to be better than those. It truly has an amazing picture with HD and I am very pleased with the purchase.UPDATE 07/09/2011: After tinkering with the set for a month or so, I have been able to improve the sound CONSIDERABLY.....and it was pretty good to start with. Here's how I did it: Press \"Menu\", then \"Audio\". Turn \"Auto\" sound OFF! Next, I have  the \"Clear Voice II\" turned \"On\" and set to 0 (the more I increased it to the maximum of +6, the more background static I got). MOST IMPORTANTLY, I use the \"MUSIC\" mode..this produces a much more dynamic sound! Then adjust Treble and Bass to your liking and CLOSE. I get a really great sound. I use 56 treble and 89 bass.This is a 10/29/2012 UPDATE: I had ordered the Bose SOLO one piece system which is a single unit dedicated to increasing TV sound quality. I followed their instructions to the tee and used the best connection they recommended, as well as turning off the TV speakers when testing the sound.  Oops.....the LG had a nicer and more dynamic sound! I have since returned the Bose system (they were great about taking it back....even paid for UPS return postage). Actually, the SOLO unit has gotten some bad reviews on here, even though more good than bad.UPDATE 10/31/2012: After messing with the \"Video\" for over a year I have finally gotten what I consider to be a better picture than the \"Standard\" or \"Intelligent Sensor\" modes. Basically, I use the first option of 16:9 Ratio....then skip using the \"Picture Wizard\" (it is quite involved but it might work for you)....and chose the \"Vivid (User)\" option for the viewing mode. You can see what you like under the various adjustments of \"Sharpness\", \"Contrast\" etc.. Under \"Advance Control\", I have all the options set on \"High\"  except for \"Black Level\", which I have on \"Low\". Then \"Close\".", "Date": "June 1, 2011"}, {"Title": "Great TV For The Money", "Author": "Moviegeek", "ReviewID": "R367A4L0TFWJVU", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I must preface my review by saying I didn't buy the LG 450 online, I bought it at a big box store because they had a better price:I wanted an inexpensive TV for the bedroom and the LG 450 is a good choice, the picture quality is very good for it's price. I didn't need 120Hz so I saved $150 by buying the 60Hz model. The LG 450 has Expert ISF Settings so you can have it professionally calibrated or do it yourself, it has a built-in blue filter and calibration wizard. The ATSC tuner is very powerful because I get all the local stations OTA with an indoor antenna. This model is not internet enabled so you need a set top box to get Netflix, etc. As with all TV's the sound isn't great but it does have bass and treble controls.

Runs like a champ, I haven't had a single issue. I will probably not upgrade for another year.== Original Review ==I honestly didn't know what to expect. I bought this TV on sale at Best Buy for 100 dollars off. I was in the market for a new TV, actually my first TV purchase.After a week of use, I am very very pleased with my purchase.The picture quality is fantastic. Every aspect of the picture can be customized- how warm the picture is, brightness, gamma exposure, etc. Let me say, out of the box the picture was great, this options are more for if you are very particular.The sound quality is adequate. Not the absolute best, but it is a very solid TV. My dad's bravia's sound quality is a lot worse so I am thankful that this setup is good.As far as features are concerned- it has all of the standards (sleep timer, auto-on/off, etc). It is missing picture-in-picture but this seems almost irrelevant for the size of the TV. I am throughly impressed with the number of inputs and outputs on this TV. 3 HDMI ports, 2 regular RCA (red, white, yellow) inputs, and the PC cord. The PC cord input even has a headphone audio input! This makes using my long cord very easy and converter free.As a note, I use the TV with my PS3 and PC, and both look and sound fantastic.I am very pleased with this purchase and would recommend it to anyone.", "Date": "May 27, 2011"}, {"Title": "Awesome low end TV", "Author": "Tan", "ReviewID": "R2VLV8ADX3436I", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I've been watching HD TV and movies from the LCD monitor on my computer for the last few years because I vowed I would not spend more than $500 for a boob tube, but now I've finally found something that I would be happy with for $499. This LG is a very basic, no-frills TV, but it's all that I need in a TV. The features are very base level and the specs on the contrast may make it seem like it has a phenomenal picture but it's really just average for this price range, which is to say that it's perfectly adequate. It's basically what you would expect from an IPS panel. You can move around the room and the image is perfectly viewable no matter where you sit. The backlight is adequate and turned all the way up is not glaring.One of the first things you'll notice is that the power \"button\" is not a button, but a touch-sensitive area that requires no effort to turn on. That's nice because the TV is so light that pressing a conventional button on this TV would probably move it around a tiny bit. The TV takes a few seconds before you see an image but that's quite tolerable. Changing channels is about as fast as other recent TVs but definitely slower than a computer with a USB tuner. That's perfectly fine for me since I don't intend to channel surf with this TV.It's nice that the unit offers a calibration wizard but I did not like how the recommended contrast setting made darker images lose detail.  I ended up turning the contrast almost all the way up. There's really not much to say about the image quality.  It's perfectly decent and I didn't find any noticeable flaws. So far I've mostly used it to play Lego Batman and there is no image lag that I've read about in other TVs. One thing I've noticed is that with computer to HDMI connections, the default is overscan mode so you have to adjust your video settings to decrease the image size to fit entirely within the TV screen. Once you do the image looks great. There is also VGA port, but that it does not handle full HD resolution.There are two menu systems, a quick menu and a more comprehensive menu that gives you all of the controls that you would ever need. That's thoughtful of LG as I've always disliked having to delve deeply into a menu system to do something as simple as deleting an unwanted channel. It still takes a minimum of three presses though.  It would be nice if they had provided a button just for that on the remote.Like many TVs at this price point, it only provides optical audio out which is ironic since most buyers of  cheaper TVs don't have stereo systems that have optical in. Fortunately, there is at least a headphone port that can be used to connect to computer speakers or even a stereo receiver. This is important because the performance of the built-in speakers are not proportional to the size of the screen. At 42\" this is a decent size for a small home theater yet the speakers cannot provide that experience. That's OK--I didn't expect it to and I've got external speakers to take over.Although they skimped on the audio out, they covered the video inputs well.  There are component as well as composite inputs as well as three HDMI ports. And there is a conventional USB port instead of the more limited memory card reader. I played a couple videos through USB and it handled the job flawlessly. I was very pleased to find that it kept track of where you stopped a video last time you watched it. It's little things like that that make this TV stand out from cheaper ones.I did a ton of shopping to find something with a good picture that doesn't break the bank. Many new TVs sold now are much more expensive and have a lot of buzzword features which this unit does not have. This unit is basically a brand new TV with last year's features. I'm fine with that as long as I get a bigger screen for the money.", "Date": "June 9, 2011"}, {"Title": "Average 1080p LCD, dead pixels on our first set", "Author": "M", "ReviewID": "R1DAGPZG9NQVVF", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "The brown plastic strip across the bottom looks like a sticker and we feel that it actually makes the TV look cheaper than it is.

Side by side with the Samsung equivalent (both tv's set to default settings) the colors are noticibly less vivid. Even when toying with the settings, it just doesn't have the same WOW factor. For almost $100 cheaper (listed $379 at time of review), ~25% at this price point, worth the minor sacrifice.All in all, happy with the purchase and would buy LG again as long as they continue to price lower than the competition.", "Date": "August 5, 2011"}, {"Title": "New to HDTV", "Author": "OldReno", "ReviewID": "R39JS1QKM1EUS5", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I'm finally coming into the 21st century with a flat panel HDTV. When the big switch came to HDTV, my satellite provider said their signal would be adjusted and I wouldn't need to upgrade the receiver or my older 27\" Zenith since it was still functioning perfectly. Recently, my Zenith started acting up so I started shopping for a new TV and settled on the LG 32LK450 1080P. All I can say is WOW!!! I'm sorry now that I waited so long to upgrade. I connected it to the receiver I was using with the Zenith but will be having the satellite system upgraded to HD next week. With the awesome quality of the picture already, it is hard to imagine it could get any better. I'm not a techno geek so the audio for me was fine right out of the box. All I had to do is take it out of the carton, attach the stand, and plug it in. When turning it on the first time, there were a couple on-screen settings to put in order then it was ready to enjoy. Amazon had the best price I could find so they got my order. Standard shipping took a reasonable 7 days from their warehouse to my house.

I did not require internet connectivity, smart functions, Hulu, Netflix, True-motion processing, 3D, automatic espresso's, or a shiatsu back massage. All I required was a nice screen so that I could watch direct tv and blu-rays with my fiancee. So when I recently received a kindle special offer for $100 off on HDTV's sold by Amazon, I decided that it was meant to be.I ended up purchasing this set for $397.00 shipped to my door (On 09/12/11). Simply a mind blowing price for a full 1080p 42\" lcd screen. I am pleased to say this set has already past my expectations for a product at this price point. The TV took me less than 10 minutes to get set up (by myself), and the picture is just incredible. I have a 2010 Samsung 46\" LED LCD TV in my den that I paid $1400 for last year. This set looks just as good, and its very hard to see the size difference between the two screens. I almost feel like I'm watching the same TV, but for $1000 less.The sound is a bit lacking (as noted in other reviews), and the inclusion of only an optical out for audio is puzzling since most people looking for a low end tv still use analog audio. Luckily my bedroom stereo has an optical input.Pros:- Price- Fantastic Picture... Rich colors, bright whites, dark blacks, etc...- Easy to use menu- 3 HDMI outs and a USB input- PriceCons:- Speakers are lacking- No analog audio outConclusion:This TV is a fantastic purchase if you're looking for a bare bones 40\"-42\" LCD TV.

Like the other reviewer this is my first HDTV so if there was anything bad to say about this tv it would have to be pretty significant.  I don't see any Y in the product code anywhere so I guess it's entirely possible that Amazon only sells the VA versions and not the IPS.  Overall, the color and resolution is great and so is the sound.  Xbox games look fantastic and HD movies are clear. With about only 6 screws the floor stand assembly wasn't difficult at all and connecting devices to the tv is also very hassle-free with a few HDMI and USB ports on the side as well as the back.  Lastly, the remote doesn't take long to learn and is free of convoluted unnecessary buttons.The options menu is very easy to navigate.  Adjusting the picture isn't difficult at all.  Along with the normal picture adjustment settings there are preset picture setting shortcuts that are for specific functions (ex. sports, gaming, movies, ect.) making it very easy to switch from one viewing experience to another if you're that type of person.  The lighting issues that some other people might be having are easily fixed by going into the display options and changing the picture mode (intelligent sensor issue) or just by lowering/turning off the energy saver option (screen dimming issue).  Hooking my pc up to the tv was extremely easy; the only problem was getting an audio cable that connects the pc to the tv speakers.  I doubt most people would try this but you can just use the same cable that they sell at Walmart for about $10 that connects a mp3 player to your car's head unit and not have any problems.  The only problem I have is that the tv display of the computer screen is a little too large and cuts off the very right side just enough to where you can't see the vertical scrolling bar for internet explorer or any programs' red close button.  I tried fixing this but the manual says that some graphics cards cause the image to not be positioned correctly on the screen so I guess it's not a common problem.", "Date": "July 26, 2011"}, {"Title": "Decent HDTV", "Author": "Truth Seeker", "ReviewID": "R3CSH8O6LRXI75", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I recently purchased this set and two things come to mind:1. This HDTV is nowhere near the sleek slim device as shown in the pictures. It is actually a quite bulky unattractive bezel. Look closely before you purchase because there is an atrocious light brown sticker like strip across at the bottom of the bezel about a 1/2 inch thick. I find myself looking at that more then the TV at times (reminds me of austin powers staring at the Mole on someones face) just cant help it.2. The picture is OK, i have an older 2008 Samsung LCD TV which looks a bit crisper and clearer on ESPN, dont ask me, did a bit of calibration too. Bluray does look great though cant complain about that. Also a very slight bit of motion blur watching football. I know its only 60hz but never experienced that before.Overall a decent set for the price, nice features, plenty of inputs, good PC connectivity, cant complain too much aside from the aesthetics of the Bezel, also LCD is older technology. For a mere $40 you can upgrade to the LG 32 LED version with a sleeker, sexier bezel and avoid that atrocious brown strip and bulky panel. You also get newer technology.

It is the first HDTV I purchased, but I have spent very much (too much) time in front of HDTVs thanks to family and roommates. I try to research products thoroughly before making a purchase, and after reading reviews everywhere I could find them I decided to purchase this television. For under $600 USDs I did not expect a spectacular TV, I expected a pretty solid picture that would handle my gaming habit and the occasional DVD/Blu-ray.Assembly of the television was very simple, requiring 8 screws to attach it to the stand. Two of the screws seemed to be the wrong thread and did not tighten as much as they should have, as a result the TV leaned forward slightly (not enough to bother me.)I'll skip initial impressions and finish up with my overall opinion:I used the TV for a week predominantly playing XBOX 360 hooked up via HDMI before deciding to return the TV. Despite tweaking all the video settings (and they are fairly extensive) the picture quality was not what I had hoped. Images were washed out, and overall unclear.I decided to replace it with the LG 42LK520, which has 120Hz, a slightly higher contrast ratio, and TrueMotion support. The LK520 was $610 on Amazon, and was absolutely worth the extra $85.Even if you are looking for a budget(I assume you are if you are looking at a $600 LCD) SPEND THE LITTLE BIT EXTRA to get the next step up (42LK520, IT IS WORTH IT.", "Date": "August 4, 2011"}, {"Title": "32-inch LG HDTV is high style", "Author": "Nicholas Hoogs \"Early 60's Zealot\"", "ReviewID": "R1XG7R5RDFTN69", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "My wife and I purchased this hi-def LG TV for our NJ condo, which we rent out during the summer season -- the smallish size fit our smallish living room perfectly and the price (419) was right ... it arrived in several days and we set it up for renters due to arrive in a few days.  It was a little tricky fitting the table stand pieces together (not as easy e.g., as the Vizio or Olevia TV stands -- talking about the \"feet\" and platform that snap onto the TV chassis to enable it to stand on a table). But my wife figured it out.  The set up was an expected breeze, the remote worked perfected, and the HD picture was as good as any I've seen. Also, there is an easy aspect-ratio selection feature, so you can watch 4:3 movies in their original framing instead of having the picture drawn out to 16:9, which makes everyone look fat.The one issue that could be improved here is the sound-system.  We do not have an external home theatre set-up in the condo, so we used the TV's sound; unfortunately, the speakers are located on the bottom side of the screen -- i.e., pointed downward toward the TV table.  That obscures the sound a bit, makes the volume lower than if the speakers faced out -- worse, the TV volume is not very powered, which means the volume cannot be cranked up as loud as one might want.  LG obviously adopted this design to improve the appearance of the unit -- and it works!  The set is beautiful -- (no visible built-in speakers to mar the appearance!) In our small unit we wouldn't want to play the TV overly loud anyway -- so as not to bother neighbors.

BAAAAADDD Amazon!", "Author": "Stranded in Salt Lke", "ReviewID": "R1UBDTLS7LOHK4", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "First a word about Amazon. I purchased this TV on September 12th and elected FREE Supersaver shipping. Amazon said they shipped it on September 15th, three days later. But somehow Fedex didn't receive it until September 19th, one WEEK later. Amazon said it would be delivered on September 21st. So, I took the day off from work. NO delivery. Fedex said it would be delivered September 23rd, so I took ANOTHER day off from work. It was finally delivered late in the afternoon on September 23rd, 11 days after I purchased it. So, aside from Kindle purchases which come electronically, this is my LAST experience making purchases from Amazon.Now, the TV:First, as others have said, the packaging is VERY flimsy and not suitable for Fedex/UPS shipment. Mine arrived with several punctures in the shipping carton. I made sure to note damages when I signed the Fedex shipping receipt. LG should upgrade the packaging of their TVs since their current packaging is simply NOT suitable for Fedex/UPS shipping.The printed manual that comes with the TV is a generic manual that covers about 30 models that LG makes; LCD,LED,Plasma and 3D. So, finding assembly instructions for your particular model is very difficult, and in order to save space in the manual, the instructions and drawings that you will find for your model are brief, primitive and useless. Have someone handy around when you try to assemble the stand. And, have a long-throat Phillips screwdriver available. The operating instructions are also primitive, generic and unuseful.Having said all of this, this is a GREAT TV! I've waited to post this in order to allow 12 hours of burn in. But from the get-go, the picture is FANTASTIC!!! Rich, detailed and vibrant with very good depth. Flesh-tones are AMAZING. The most accurate and vivid flesh-tones I have ever seen on any TV. I find flesh-tones to be the achilles heel of most any TV, but the LG is EXCELLENT in this regard right out of the box. Overall, the picture is simply outstanding using the standard settings without even using the PictureWizard calibration aid. As others have suggested:1) Turn off Auto Energy Savings2) Select \"Just Scan\" for aspect ratio3) I find the \"Standard\" picture settings to be more appealing than the \"Cinema\" setting (which I find to be too dark). The Standard settings are perfect!The sound is OUTSTANDING!!! Much better than I could have ever imagined from in-set speakers. I've selected the \"ClearVoice II\" enhancement at a level of 3, and I'm blown away with how good this thing sounds.I AM a sports fan and I'm watching Notre Dame beat Pitt right now. Even with the 60hz refresh, the picture is crisp and clear. While I'm  sure that the 120hz 42LK520 is lovely, save yourself $120 and get the 42LK450. You won't regret it and the savings will pay for a week or two of beer.The remote is very well organized and intuitive.

The rear plate portion of the stand has a hole - this is so you can permanently mount it using the stand as opposed to mounting on a wall, if desired (a wood screw is included for this purpose).If I may pause for a moment: I see many other reviewers complaining about this TV's picture and sound. I have to ask, since you try to come off as some diva audio/video-phile, why didn't you just go for the top of the line Sony Bravia's, and be done with it? What do expect for under $500?Back to the TV: Features - too many to list. I used the picture calibrator to \"set up\" the tv. The Intellisensor option works well, but occasionally, I will switch it to'Vivid', depending on the channel/show/movie, etc. I basically let the TV do the work via auto settings as much as possible. Works nice for me!Picture - sharp and clear for a 60Hz. I have an HD cable box and use one of the HDMI ports. Looks great! The non-HD channels look decent, but that is about it. Just for the heck of it, I hooked up an antenna and did an auto-channel search. The 'on-air' HD broadcasts looked excellent. As far as picture adjustments go, I too, turned off the energy-saver feature; while I appreciate the idea of it, the picture was just a little too dark. Perhaps they will improve this in the future.Sound - it sounds great! I don't know why people are complaining about this? Sure, connect it up to a surround system - that is ideal. But the TV's speakers themselves sound fine.Let's see, what else... oh yeah, the model I received has the number \"CUSYLH\". Some people want to know this information. Something about what kind of screen panel it is?The screen itself is matte, but has a slight glossy look to it. While it does a good job of eliminating glare, there can still be some reflection from windows/lamps/lights, etc, but it's OK.The *only* thing I do not like, is the brown colored trim running across the lower portion of the frame. This definitely cheapens the look of the tv. I see where LG was going with it, but it looks dumb. It has four colors of brown (dark to light). It looks like an old 16bit gradient - not smooth, but blocky.All in all, this TV is a great buy for the money.", "Date": "December 8, 2011"}, {"Title": "Great TV", "Author": "photodragon", "ReviewID": "R1BEJGVX7HZHIA", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I got this TV as a black Friday sale.

Can be used as a computer monitor (good, but not great picture using a VGA cable; better with a DisplayPort to HDMI cable, but couldn't make it work at 1080p 60hz). It has headphone 3.5mm audio output and 3 HDMI inputs. USB port for music and video files, although it doesn't accept lossless audio. TV can be rotated sideways up to 20 degrees on the stand.Cons: The automatic screen adjustment is not customizable (I wish it was brighter than whatever it selects; but you can turn off the automatic adjustment, so not a problem). No button for on/off captions (you have to go through the not-so \"quick menu\", requiring 4 or more commands). My previous Sharp TV had a smaller remote (3/4 size) and was more functional (the TV menu organization was better too). The stand could be better (TV wobbles on the stand when you touch the TV; not a problem if you never touch it or hang the TV on the wall). The stand was also harder to install than I expected (the manual doesn't explain very well and you need a long screwdriver).It seems like I got a VA panel (product code CUSDLH), but I don't dislike it (perhaps the IPS is better, but this VA is not bad even from a 45 degree viewing angle).", "Date": "July 2, 2011"}, {"Title": "Great TV!

The picture is pleasing, and a CCFL-LCD picture seems to suit my eyes better than seeing the \"sparklies\" on LED-LCD panels.  It may not have the latest-and-greatest technology, but it looks extremely good to me.But I can't seem to get the sound to sync-up to the picture, it's just a tad behind the image on the screen.  It doesn't matter if it's from a disc, from satellite, over the internet, or from local broadcasts; you see the lips move a heartbeat before hearing the words.  A bit disconcerting.I have shut off everything in the Sound menu, wondering if pre-processing was the problem, but haven't had any luck so far.  Have also reset the TV to factory defaults without solving it, and even tried to run it in store demo mode.  All the same.Has anyone else seen this?  Is there a solution?What I like most about LG televisions:1. Swivel stands.  LG puts a swiveling stand on almost all their televisions, and that's a perfect option for a 32-inch set.2. Programmable off-time.  You can program an LG to turn itself off (or on) at the same time every day, without any additional information.  When the television is in a bedroom, this is an extremely convenient feature - much better than a sleep timer.  Although the sets also have normal sleep timers, we like the programmed off-time much better.3. I can turn off the LED status lights.  I can turn off the standby (red-colored) LED, or I can turn off the power-on (green-colored) LED, or I can turn them both off.  Or leave them on... I never understood how anyone thought it was a good idea to have a bright red LED on when you turn off the television, especially at night, in a bedroom.  I can turn the standby LED off and leave the power-on LED alone and get a good night's sleep.  Great feature, infinitely better than partially dimming the LEDs.  Seems to be unique to LG.UPDATE: I asked for a replacement because of the audio problems and OMG!  Could it get any worse!?  Somehow the original had the IPS panel and the replacement has a VA panel.  Maybe it's just this one panel, but you have to be dead-on center to see the picture.  Left or right, high or low, and the side of the panel opposite from you is washed-out (Yes, it's calibrated).LG swaps in lower-quality panels every so often, apparently at whim.  I never thought about it because they swear all LCD panels they use meet the same specifications.  Hardly.This isn't an issue of response time for playing games.  I don;t play games.  The issue is that one person on one side of the bed sees a great picture, the person on the other side sees half a picture.Amazon had this problem with LG last year in the LE5300-series, and it's just a crap shoot.  I'm not happy with how Amazon is handling this at the moment - they're being a bit cranky - but I'm close to reaching thermonuclear critical mass with LG.It's just anything for a buck and none of us should take it.

I can understand the gripes from some people receiving a television that doesn't work, but rejects happen everywhere, and you just have to hope yours isn't one of them. Thankfully, as far as my experience goes, I honestly couldn't ask more from a tv. I didn't care about getting one with internet capability, so if that is what you want, go with something else. However, if you want a television with great picture and above average sound, go with this. The price seems to be the best out of all the rest, and I can't see how most could ask for more. I would recommend a sound system to get the most out of it, but it's not as if the sound is horrid. I'm simply saying that if you care alot about sound, I don't think this will meet your needs completely.On a side note: You will need to mess with the sound and picture settings to get the best experience, but in my opinion, that should be expected. After all, what other electronic device agrees with everyone's expectations before a little \"tweaking\".Here's my two cents: After reading all about this television on amazon, realizing what features came with this tv and what didn't, my only concern was whether or not the picture would meet my entertainment desires.

Product arrived in perfect condition, so kudos to Amazon and UPS for such a speedy and safe delivery.This TV will be for the bedroom and looks very sharp on top of my large dressing cabinet.  I've read other reviews about some sort of \"ugly\" brown bar along the bottom of the TV?  I personally do not see it?  I know it's a matter of preference and everyone's different, but it's really barely noticable, unless you've fixated on it, I suppose.Plugged in the TV, attached to my rooftop antenna (I cut cable a while back), and did an autoscan for channels.  That took some time.  You need to go get a snack or do another project while you're waiting for that.  When it was finished, I had more channels than I've ever had with my still existing tube style tv and DTV converter box.  Maybe I just need to do a rescan with the old tv?  I got at least 50 - 60 channels, OTA.  I will definitely be editing some out because they're either too weak of a signal to watch, or in a language I don't understand.  What's confusing, is that there are DTV channels and TV channels (those are snowy - as in an old analog tv?).  Not sure I understand that, but they'll probably get deleted too.The picture quality in the OTA HD channels is quite good.  Some of the stations look as though they're broadcasting in 720p HD and some are in 1080i HD.  Haven't seen a 1080p yet?  I don't see a whole lot of difference between the 720p and 1080i.  I'm still waiting for my video streaming device to come in.  I'll most likely comment on any issues there.  I have 6M DSL service which tends to be more in the 4M realm.

I've had excellent experiences with other LG products, and the price was exactly where I wanted it.  Being able to label the inputs so instead of AV1 and HDMI2, it says VHS, DVD and CABLE was a huge help for my mother.  The picture was beautiful and it was the first LCD TV I've purchased (I have other DLP TVs) and it really is amazing.  It's also in a room full of windows, but the picture was bright and clear with plenty of contrast, even with the picture control turned off.  Set to 'sports' it was even brighter and sharper.I can understand now why they have 120Hz TVs;  when viewing some content at 1080p (like a blu-ray of Avatar) I could see a sort of flicker when the camera would pan, or especially during the space CGI scenes.  I assume a 120Hz or higher TV would eliminate that, or hide it better.  I'm just usually very sensitive to these things, (I see rainbows on the DLP, for example) plus my mother will only be watching HD content on cable.  I doubt she'd notice or be able to distinguish the difference between 60 and 120Hz.  My wife didn't notice it, even when it was at it's worse for me.It's an excellent TV.

We bought a Phillips 32\" CRT about 7 years ago and after repairing it once to the tune of $200 (we initially paid $350 for), I decided it was time for a new TV.  We settled on this one.  We needed to get a DirectTV HD box in order to get HD out of it, but we already had the wiring and appropriate satellite so it was a no brainer.  In HD, this TV is spectacular.  At 42\" it's huge.  The contrast is fantastic.  My mother came over for a visit and could not believe how incredible it looked.  In non-HD, it's very good if you set the screen ratio back down to 4:3.  A little bit of a pain but I imagine all HD-TV's will be the same.  If you walk into Walmart and look at what is on the wall, they all look awful in non-HD.  But with DirectTV-HD, almost everything I want to watch is in HD, I was actually surprised how much is in HD.  3-4 years ago, nothing was in HD.  The sound is good, it tops out a good bit quieter than our CRT did and the frequency response seems different, it has much less bass and more treble.  But it is certainly adequate.  I'm not interested in external speakers but if I want to be blown across the room I'm sure I could attach them.If I had to do it again, I would buy this TV.

It really fine tunes the image quality.Where do I start?  This LCD TV is replacing a 23\" Samsung computer monitor that I have been using as an entertainment viewing screen in my bedroom.  As such is the case, I have been looking to make the purchase on a big screen TV for a long, long time.  This search came to a conclusion earlier this year when I found a deal on this TV.  Admittedly, what drew me to this purchase was the brand name and the gleaming reviews on multiple websites.This TV delivers excellent quality picture and sound.  The image is crisp and remarkably clear.  Color clarity is spectacular for this being a cathode back-lit model.  I find black levels to be perfect for my viewing needs.  I typically use this TV as a computer monitor for viewing film, regular HD television programs, gaming, and everyday internet browsing.One of the features I like the most is the picture image wizard.  You can quite literally set the picture features to your liking with a very easy to use step-by-step wizard.  Couple this with the automatic backlight setting, you get the best possible viewing experience.I read through dozens of reviews that were somewhat critical of the sound, but I should say this: for a 3\" panel, the built in speakers outperform pretty much every other LCD panel I have seen in my search for a new TV.  The bass is present and acceptable for a normal listening experience, but won't compare to a separate audio system.  Regardless of that one minor and understandable drawback, I find that the clearvoice setting and infinite surround have the effect that I believe they were intended to achieve.  Clearvoice emphasizes and amplifies mid range audio frequencies where you will typically find vocal ranges.  Infinite surround also achieves a sort of surround sound effect.  Its not absolutely amazing like some of the new sound bars, but it is present and effective at some level.Long story short, I think if you get this TV you will be greatly pleased.  Granted that everyone's taste is different, I'm still quite certain that this TV offers up tunable video and audio performance that will appeal to even the most discerning video/audiophile.", "Date": "February 18, 2012"}, {"Title": "Good value option", "Author": "Spanman", "ReviewID": "R3JD2FH00X3EDI", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "The TV was offered by Amazon at the lowest price point about 4 weeks ago.

If you are planning on using the digital tuner for over the air signals, it seems to be only mediocre. The picture is very good from an HD source. The sound thru the on board speakers is adequate. A full range of adjustments are possible, but I have stuck close to the defaults for the Cinema mode for both color and sound.

In fact the first one doesn't apply if you're not using the stand.1) The wells that you have to screw the base into require a *very* long screwdriver to properly tighten 2 of the 4 screws, but if you mount the tv on a wall or backstand unit, this is a non-issue.2) The speakers are a bit weak by themselves.  There is practically no bass output from them, so you won't \"feel the rumble\" if you plan on just piping the sound into this set.

I spent a long time looking for the best deal on the \"Bang for your Buck\" HDTV. I am set up with a nice 3d blu-ray player and an xbox with an old Sony surround sound system. I could use even my old surround system with the optic cable, and have two different HDMI inputs for my blu-ray and XBOX so that I have surround all the time and never have to unplug cables. The picture quality goes from decent to very good after 12 hours of viewing. I think the picture quality on Netflix and regular movies is alright, and the Blu-rays are fantastic (obviously worth the 1080p vs 720p those who are debating those two). The sound with the TV by itself is ok (I read that it is better than most) and the settings are easy to mess around with. If you are looking to use this TV for yourself you will be MORE than happy I guarantee it. If you need to impress friends or loved ones that are intense critics or you yourself are a master of the HDTV world as many I read on here are then you should probably spend the extra money on a 120 hz or a top of the line TV.

This may be a matter of taste; but I think most people like cinematic, high contrast capabilities in their TVs.

Probably just a bad individual TV, as I hadn't read about this flaw from other reviews, but had to return it nonetheless and can't give it the 4 stars it deserves (but also don't believe in giving 1 star for what is an unpredictable flaw - presuming you get a working version of this TV for about five hundred bucks, you can't go wrong.", "Date": "August 18, 2011"}, {"Title": "Plays Media Files From USB Drive w/o Problems", "Author": "sandpiper", "ReviewID": "R2RIKCSSZ9AJN6", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I hooked up a 1TB WD USB drive and this TV picked up my media files without any problems.

I'm very skeptical about things like this, especially with such a reasonable price, but I'm very impressed. In fact, I think some of the reviews for this TV might actually hinder someone's decision to buy it. First of all, this TV is for my room. It's not for my living room or my home theater or what have you. It's for my bedroom. The size is great and the sound, unlike other reviews, is just fine. In fact, after reading the reviews on the questionable sound quality, I went out and bought a cheap soundbar from Target just as a precautionary thing. I hooked up the soundbar and it sounded good but then when I took it away I didn't notice that much of a difference with the sound, so I boxed the soundbar back up and I'm just using the TV as is. Another thing that concerned me a little about buying this TV was the \"brown bezel\" that has been bothering some people. It's on the very bottom of the bezel, it's about an inch high, and it's not a huge deal. If you can't concentrate on the TV because you're looking at this brown faux-wood looking bezel thing, then that's your issue. Another great thing about this TV is the picture. I'm sure for more money the picture could be a TAD better, but what impressed me is that I didn't have to upgrade my FiOS box. So maybe this TV has an HD adapter built in, I don't know, but the picture looks good with the regular cable box, as opposed to my brother who has a magnavox flat screen and had to go to verizon to get an HD box (which is an extra 10 bucks a month).

I had that one for over 6 years, and was very happy with it.  I wanted to upgrade to a 1080p TV, and needed a 37\".  I also wanted 3 HDMI inputs, something that is very hard to find in that size and combination.  With my previous experience, I decided to go with LG.  The TV had everything I wanted, but there was a problem with the sound.  After selecting an input to turn on, say, the cable or my Playstation 3, once it had started up a minute in to whichever device you were using the sound would go out for about 3 seconds.  I tried numerous devices, cables, etc. but it still happened.I called LG, and they were going to contact the service agent in my area.  He said I needed to have the main board replaced.  Once it came in, he replaced the board and the TV wouldn't even show a picture.  The gentleman said it must be a bad board, and that he would order another.  A couple of weeks later, the 2nd board showed up and was installed.  The problem did not go away, and a 3rd board was on order.  At this point it had been 2 months and no resolution was in sight.  LG told me that if the next board didn't fix it, that I could put in a request for a review of the item for a refund.  LG, however, has to approve a refund and could offer a replacement but it wouldn't necessarily be the same model.  Since this was the only model I could find through LG with the specifics of 1080p, 37\" and 3 HDMI ports I knew they would not be able to replace it since this was not the 2012 model.I wanted to exchange it through Amazon at the beginning but they had been sold out.  Also, the returns department could refund me based on how old the television was.  So even though I had it 2 months and it hadn't functioned properly since day 1 I could receive less than I paid based on the fact I had owned it for 2 months.  I returned it to Amazon and purchased a Panasonic instead.

Set up was quick. I did need to find a rather long and slender screw driver to get the tiny screws into the base. I love that it has 3 HDMI ports and two RCA inputs. Picture is alright- not quite as good as my ex's isymphony, but still lovely. It did not come with an HDMI cable. I was able to program my directv remote to work all of the controls on the television, satellite and dvd.

Still liking it. Got it hooked up to the ps3, bluray is knock-your-socks off pretty. Sound's still leaving a bit to be desired. Gonna look into getting a speaker bar. It is a dust and finger print magnet, so keep your little cleaning cloth that comes with it nearby. I noticed that it does have a little sticky plastic wood grain thingy on the front of the tv that I hadn't noticed before. It's starting to peel off, which is why I noticed it. I think the tv would look nicer without it, but I'm worried about pulling it off because I don't know if what's behind it is worse looking (why else would they put it there?).

The TV I was picking up was to be an all-purpose replacement for a trusty old Samsung 23\" 720p bedroom tv (the living room tv is a 50-incher): for 1080p via dedicated blu-ray player; for Xbox 360; an hdmi cable box; part-time use as a 1920x1080 PC monitor via vga for a secondary pc; plus extra connections to possibly run an older PS2 via component or other consoles as I see fit.  It handles all of these functions with great aplomb, something which cannot be taken for granted.  For instance, when researching the owner's manuals for competing televisions there were often caveats such as not offering full 1920x1080 via vga.  And this 37\" size seems perfect.  Expansive and immersive up close yet holds up quite well from a distance, and fitting just right in a crowded entertainment center.Image quality is indeed excellent, with the issue regarding relatively light black levels easily addressed through the extensive tweaking options.  Screen brightness is also readily modified via the green \"Energy\" button (Off/min/med/max/auto).  This is something I always used on my old Samsung (3 settings) as well.  Full brightness on when playing blu-ray or 360, but when watching CNN or what-not there's no reason to waste the screen blaring brightly.  I personally don't let the \"Auto\" setting choose for me.  For gaming, there is not truly a dedicated \"Game Mode\" like on my old Samsung (the \"game mode\" here is basically just some brightness presets), but that is moot given there is no input lag to be found.  And I am one who plays various types of games requiring responsive input such 2D shooters like Raiden IV, racing games such as Forza 3, intense action game Vanquish, and the usual fps titles.The wealth of settings also extends to picture configuration, such as depending on source the usual 16:9/Just Scan/Zoom options but also a handy Cinema Zoom allowing quite a bit of flexibility.  To wit, my settings have resulted in \"Cinema Zoom 15\" when bringing to full-screen/proper aspect a channel that shows only a small center-boxed 16:9 image under natural circumstances.  Also, there is a dedicated function to properly center the vga pc image.  If you initially encounter an off-center pc image simply call up the \"Screen (RGB-PC)\" option.Last but not necessarily least is the surprisingly loud and capable built-in audio, a major weak spot on my older Samsung.  While I have an external stereo system that I never forget to pump things through when playing videogames or movies, I am also content shutting everything else off and using the onboard speakers when watching normal television.

Assembly was quick and easy. It worked without any necessary set up right out of the box. This set also doubles as a giant monitor for my desktop PC. If you're really into your TV's imaging, this is a good set to go that won't leave you feeling poor or ripped-off. I've bought a Westinghouse (geat deal but never again) and two Samsungs (great sets for good money). I'd have to say that my Westinghouse is about a 4/10 and the Samsungs are both 9/10. This would be a 9/10 with consideration of picture quality, built in sound, features and price. If you demand that most out of your set, this is definitely a good buy. If I had to choose between an LG and a Samsung for a future purchase, I would have to put them side-by-side and probably let price dictate the purchase.The calibration menus are pretty detailed. They allow for two user-defined settings which is perfect for my console gaming and PC gaming.Pros: Beautiful image, great built-in speakers, nice color, user friendlyCons: Contrast is up nearly all the way, so I feel that I will need to recalibrate in a few years.Neutral: Brown gradient strip at the bottom that supposed to add....style?

Since the television was less than two years old and we had invested in the Sony brand, we were more than a little discomforted.Having to go through this process once again and invest in a television for our home, I decided to research and review customer ratings on Amazon.com.  I appreciate Amazon, its resources, its' commitment to offering competitive prices, as well as all the customer reviews.I thoroughly examined a number of customer reviews which I appreciated and they helped me decide on a LG 32LK450 32\" HD television.  We have dual sources for programming, so having a quality tuner was necessary since our location is a rural area and most OTA (free) television reception is degraded.  We also were interested in the viewing angle and certainly the picture and audio quality.We've only had it a short time so I can only report my satisfaction to this point.  HD picture is GREAT!  Non-hd good and understandably reduced quality.  The viewing angle and audio is more than satisfactory.  The TV tuner appears to receive as many channels as our Sony did, however without the degree of fragmenting and pixilation associated with weak signals (even during recent inclement weather).  This suggest it's a better tuner, which were enjoying.Having taken so much time researching, unfortunately I missed out on Amazons' Black Friday specials, missing a great buy.  However to Amazons' credit, their low price guarantee allowed me to get a very good price a week later($324).Also I would like to add that we decided to purchase a Square Trade 4-year warranty($54), hopefully to protect against a television departing before its time.So currently we LOVE it...to be continued...", "Date": "December 8, 2011"}, {"Title": "Highly Recommended", "Author": "Thursday Trader", "ReviewID": "R3N94R4KI95BY8", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Purchased the LG 32LK450 television from Amazon and it arrived quickly and in perfect condition.

Just upped and died. A week earlier, my wife and I were discussing what we'd do if it ever did go, and we said we'd get someone to repair it. Hah! Nobody repairs anything with a tube anymore. So it was a good thing we started to look.The first consideration was size, and the place we have to watch this set can take a 32\", but even a 37\" would be too large. We headed over to BestBuy - the only game in this town - and looked at Sony, Samsung, LG, and Toshiba. A couple of years ago, we would have chosen the Toshiba, but we didn't care for the picture quality (even though we diddled a bit with the setting in the store). The Sony was $200 more, and for the amount of TV we normally want, that put it as an outside choice. Samsung was more money, but over all, we liked the picture on the LG best.We took it home, hooked it up (the hardest part was deciphering the instructions for installing the stand: the \"manuals\" are truly terrible) and that's when the fun started. Turns out you CAN'T watch hi-def on a HD set unless your cable box can get to the HD channels. I don't know about other \"services,\" but Comcast charges an extra $30 a month. Well, it's baseball season, so what he heck. We now get about 20 HD channels.BUT, if for example, we're watching Channel 3, it says \"Watch in HD,\" and you have to press \"Enter\" to get to Channel 703. That goes for most broadcast stations. It doesn't seem to apply to three of the PBS channels.Okay, so much for basics. The remote was great, but now we have to use the Comcast remote which was not designed for human use. The buttons are all wrong... but this is about the TV set. After fooling around with the various combos, we settled on \"Expert 1\" where I could set the contrast, brightness, etc. Vivid was the next choice, and most of the others didn't work out for us. Every once in a while, we hit a channel where, although it's HD, it doesn't fill the screen or the colors are \"off.\" But we go back a looonnng way, and when we got our first color TV, we learned to live with purple people, so we can cope with the foibles of Comcast and channels.Why 4 stars? It IS energy efficient, but the cable box runs about 100 watts. It has a clear and bright picture, and it isn't LG's fault that we're not willing to pay $130 a month for all HD and the \"premium\" channels. But, the sound is variable. By that I mean that it can change from channel to channel, but look at this variation: for baseball, we turn it to 18-22. For broadcast news, sometimes as high as 25-28. But for PBS - which is rarely in HD if you watch \"Mystery\" and even some \"Nova,\" I've had it up to 90!!! It's not muffled, but why so high? I have no idea.(We were deciding whether to get external speakers, but changing the \"RCA\" cables for one HDMI improved the sound by 100%. Now, normal range is 10-20.)As for the following: Intelligent Sensor, ISFccc Ready, and Picture Wizard, they seem useless. At least we haven't found a use for them. We do like being able to plug a digital camera into the front, though we probably won't do that more than once or twice. And I have my photos on a USB drive that plugs into the left side. You can access the pictures and your own music on that drive with the LG remote. However, there is good an bad in that. If your pictures started with a 3.2 mp camera, and now go to a 14 mp, many will not be in HD and many will show the poor quality of 3.2 mp from 2001-2005. So, we won't be watching slide shows any more than we did when we bored people to tears in 1970.I do recommend the LG. But check with your cable company or Dish or whatever to find out what you need. BY ALL MEANS, GO NO LOWER THAN 1080p! Anything less, and you might as well do without HD. Want to see the difference: At your local video store, try a 32\" 720p and a 32\" 1080p. Perhaps a 19\" is okay at 720, but anything that remotely resembles HD has to be 1080.P.S. This set has been on sale for as low as $359 at BBY. The week after we bought it for $420, it dropped $20, and BBY was - as usual - great about giving us the $20 back.

I mounted it on my existing wall mount. The I/O stuff is mostly on the back on the left side (viewed from front), with secondary I/O on the left side. The main I/O panel on the back faces back, so no crawling to try to see labels on the bottom.The physical appearance is clean. It is as thin as I could wish, and the plain black border is pleasant.One thing that is outstanding about this model is something that not everyone cares about, but if you need it, you want a good one. That is the over the air tuner. It is excellent. I previously had been using a converter box as a tuner, because the Brand X (Sabre) TV I had had the world's worst tuner. I have a small outside antenna mounted on the exterior wall. The converter box received the \"local\" stations from about 30 miles away well enough. With the converter box, stations 50 miles away were shaky to the point being unreliable. This television not only has solid reception of all those, but it has slightly broken reception from an area about 85 miles away. I could no doubt get those solidly with an elevated antenna. The tuner is so good that you will have to spend a few moments cleaning out a bunch of poor signal stations from way off, after you scan in the channels. And you can stop the scan at any time, which was nice, because I didn't need to scan for cable channels.The picture was good out of the box, but I did some adjustments and found it even better. Nice blacks. Accurate skin tones. Over the air DTV is very crisp. Very good sound from the onboard speakers. All I want is good sound, and I can get it without accessory speakers or home theater systems. And enough adjustments to audio and video to shape both to suit individual taste.

Out of the box it performs well enough, but I would definitely urge you to turn down the Sharpness control significantly.

However, upon looking for a bedroom television, I realized how helpful they are and decided to write one for our living room TV.This television was one of the best investments I could have made.  It's made it through three moves and is still going strong.Pros:-Multiple HDMI outlets allowing for optimal gaming and video streaming (we have our XBox, Wii, and cable box connected).-The sound is great!  I'm sure it would be better if you hooked up a home theater system, but we found no need for that.  The only complaint about sound is that the volume level changes when using different inputs (even though we have not changed the volume).  That's an easy fix though.-60Hz is perfect for us (We returned the 120Hz version because things looked too fake and it saved money).  60 Hz works great with gaming and watching football or other sports.-Different viewing modes and sound settings allow for a quick change depending on what you are watching/playing.-Easy to use and navigate remote and menu system allowed me to have my television up and running in no time!-Note: You may want to follow instructions and have an extra hand when putting it on the stand if you don't mount it.  There are numerous screws and you have to hold it all in place.  It's just easier with an extra hand.  Plus, with a wide television, it's easier to set it on your stand as well.  It's not heavy, but it's better to be safe than sorry.-Cons: None so farAbout our TV users:  Constantly streaming from Netflix and Hulu via Xbox and Wii; avid gamers; avid football fans", "Date": "December 7, 2012"}, {"Title": "Great TV for the Money !!!!!!", "Author": "Jim Williams", "ReviewID": "R22FX2XPWVPUZE", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Great TV picture.

This is one FANTASTIC video monitor - flexible, easy to install, hook-up, adjust etc., and just plain beautiful to look at. (Recently bought a standard DVD of \"Tale of Despereaux\" [CG Animation] and it just sparkles! Live action adventure stuff is beyond belief. \"...Center of the Earth.\" Etc.) Color, contrast, resolution...everything is top-notch in my opinion. I no longer send my money to the Gods of Cable and Satellite TV, so I can't speak to the standard digital signal quality, but I can't imagine it being anything less than amazing.2. I know there are more expensive monitors I could have purchased, with sophisticated high-end features to delight most blue-ray snobs, but I really don't need that, and honestly I can't afford to get into that stuff at the moment - and I'm totally satisfied without it. (I mean, how perfect can perfection get?) :-)Now for the small \"but\";3. My only regret about this purchase has to do with a small/medium \"flaw\" or smudge in the upper right portion of the screen. (Not a surface defect.) I read a few other reviews that mentioned a similar problem, and when I bought this unit \"used\" at an incredibly low price, I bit my lip and hoped that I would not get \"bitten.\" Well, I did get bitten...and I've been watching this screen for months now, wondering if I was ever going to get the energy to complain and maybe send it back for a replacement.Believe it or not, I finally decided to accept the unit with the flaw, and train myself to react to it in a more positive way. The flaw looks like a faint, narrow, three-inch long fuzzy distortion of some kind that seems embedded in the structure of the matrix. It only shows up under certain conditions, (blue sky, certain flat-colors, fast camera-pans,) but most of the time I don't see it at all. As a typical perfectionist, and a Quality-Control Manager from years past, I squirm whenever I see the thing, but I'm usually the only one watching movies in my house these days, so I've learned not to squirm too severely.  My trick was to see the flaw as a Harry Potter type scar. He grew up seeing his own facial damage as a kind of badge of courage and magical experience, so I figure I can do the same with this. Believe it or not, it actually seems to work for me.Now, you're asking, WHY DIDN'T YOU SEND IT BACK???? (Idiot!)My reasons are several;FIRST, the unit arrived at least a week earlier than I could have hoped for, providing me with weeks of unexpected video amazement. (Actually shocked me when I saw the Delivery guy carrying it out of his truck.) (And no, he didn't hurl it into my yard like in those YouTube horror-clips.) YIKES!SECOND, while unpacking the wonderful beast, I came close enough to the screws that hold the back-panel on, to cause an unexpected spark. This happened twice, and nearly knocked me on my butt, so it may very well be that the unit arrived in perfect order, and my own haste and carelessness may have caused \"the scar.\" Since I can't be sure of this, I allowed myself to \"take the hit\" on this one, and keep the unit \"forever and ever\"...Halleluiah.THIRD, the unit is just heavy enough to make me second-guess packing it up again and sending it away to be replaced. I'm getting just old enough these days to avoid anything that strains my poor body beyond a certain point.So, Why am I admitting to my acceptance of an obvious flaw? I'm doing it to make it clear, that even with the flaw, this screen has been giving me the best video viewing in my life. I occasionally watch video etc. from my computer (internet) through the HDMI Cable (Computer > Pioneer AV Amplifier > LG Monitor,) and even there, I am continually amazed at the clarity, contrast and saturation of the image.Obviously, I am thanking LG for creating such a wonderful monitor, and I'm recommending this unit to everyone.(\"Inexpensive\" doesn't have to mean inferior.)", "Date": "November 8, 2012"}, {"Title": "Pretty good.", "Author": "Tim", "ReviewID": "R20PKCY98AZ1O6", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Color and clarity are superb.

First some background: I was in the market looking for a reasonably priced (I am a college student on a limited budget), good quality TV that would be a good enough size to put in the family room of the house I will be moving into next year (currently I am living on campus, planning to move off). I spent weeks searching between all of the big box stores (Walmart, Costco, Bestbuy, etc...) trying to find something enough that would not break the bank. It seemed that the global, more mainstream brands like Sony and Samsung were too darn expensive, and I was destined to settle for a lesser known store brand. I was set to settle on a Vizio that had mediocre reviews when I stumbled upon this puppy on Amazon. To my surprise it was on sale for a fraction of the retail price. I knew that Amazon is a fickle mistress that changes with the tides, so I snatched this deal up immediately.Shipping and handling wise, I used my prime membership and it arrived in no time at all via UPS. Taking it out of the box, the TV had no cosmetic damage and it seemed to be packaged quite solidly (but I would advise against dropping this thing in box to test that theory). Turning on the TV and going through the initial set up, the TV was in perfect condition, with no dead pixels or software issuesPicture quality- I am not that big of a picture snob, so I consider this picture to be really damn good. I tested the HDMI picture by playing a 1080p video from the interwebs and playing some high resolution games on our X-box. Every time, the picture was very impressive sitting from my couch. As a note, I turned off the eco feature that dims the screen according to light. For some reason it was very noticeable to me regardless of ambient light in the room.Sound- I took the advice of others and tweaked the sound. Right out of the box the sound leaves something else to be desired, so do what I did and use the recommendations of other reviewers as a baseline and tweak to taste.Connections- Unlike the \"newest\" model, this TV comes stacked with 3 and not 2 HDMI ports. This is really handy because it allows us to keep our cable box and X-box constantly plugged in while leaving the 3rd port free (we usually stream stuff directly from our laptops through HDMI). This also boasts two older-tech AV ports, handy for plugging in older devices such as our Wii and Nintendo 64 which. There are also many other ports which are listed in the description. Needless to say this is stacked with plenty of connections/ports which makes life a lot easier, and me a lot happier.Luckily it seems that as always the other reviewers on Amazon did not lead me astray. I was able to snatch up this sweet deal of a TV without having to compromise quality. I have had this TV for a couple of months now, and I am absolutely pleased with my purchase. In summary this is a good quality, good looking TV that provides a lot of flexibility for whoever buys it. If you have the opportunity to get this model on the cheap, I highly suggest you do what I did and buy it while you still can!", "Date": "June 1, 2012"}, {"Title": "A Great TV, Affordable Price!  No Complaints!", "Author": "ZbadhabitZ", "ReviewID": "R1XZSWINNL278A", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Like many other reviewers, I came to Amazon in search of an affordable, 1080p, 32-inch TV.  After some extensive research, I settled upon this product, and decided to give it a go.  To make note, I use this product solely with my third-generation Apple TV, which provides 1080p content.  I have not tried it with cable, Blu-Ray, DVD, etc.After ordering this product, the box arrived at my home just three days later (I paid for no \"expedited\" shipping).  In awe of the prompt delivery time, I opened up the package, and found the television very simple to set up.  If you are using the table-top stand, some basic assembly was required, but the instructions were very clear and easy to understand.  The television provides an incredible number of inputs, which I cannot comment on as I am only using one HDMI input.  Additionally, the remote is very intuitive, easy-to-understand, and functioned as expected.In terms of actual performance, the television is really quite great.  The sound quality is exceptional (I typically leave it at around 12 or 13 volume, which works well from hearing across the room).  Like previous reviewers have noted, adjusting some of the brightness and contrast settings can really help to adjust the perfect viewing environment for your home.  I spent about twenty minutes playing with the settings, including using some settings another reviewer posted, but ended up finding some of the preset settings worked best.  I tested a few 1080p items (a movie, a downloaded TV show, and Netflix streaming), all of which really looked great.  I found that when standing very close to the television, the picture quality appears rather standard, but when sitting about 8 or 10 feet back (which is, realistically, how people watch TV), it is that crisp 1080p quality you'd expect.I really have no negative things to say about this television.  For the price, I think it is an exceptional value, and would happily buy again.  If you're willing to spend more, yes, there are other products out there that provide a more lively picture, but in this price range, this absolutely is the best television I've come across.

I could not find any one in store  that comes close to this price range. So, i am happy with the purchase from a price point!I use this TV for viewing standard and cable TV programs. The image are good but not as good when compared to a prior Sharp Aquos LCD Tv i used to own. For some reason, the image does not \"pop\" and lacks the clarity and crisp that higher end LCD TV has to offer. That said... Again, it only cost less than half the price of those TVs. I guess something gotta give, the balance between quality and price. To reiterate, the picture quality is definitely good... Just not great.I purchase this tv set using the amazon prime membership... Hence they really did delivery within two days, amazingly.... And i am really pleased. The tv came in its original packaging... And the set up took less than 30 mins... The based board needs to be screwed to the main tv unit but it can be comfortably done by just one person and the program set up is pretty intuitive. Just press the automatic config button in the tv menu and you are all set after  5 mins of channel search.One word of warning - this tv unit has a tendency to \" forget\" saved channels.. This means that saved channels in prior channel search gets mysteriously deleted or omitted after about two weeks of use ( and i mean light use as i dun watch tv everyday). I had problems with Animal Planet and NatGeo... There may be other channels. At first i thought that the problem was with the cable... Then I realised that the problem is more with the TV rather than the cable network. To fix this problem i had to go through another 5 mins of channel configuration to search and save the channels. It is troublesome... But not sufficient for me to return the unit.I would definitely have rated this tv at least 4 stars ( for its value for money proposition) however, i reduced this to 3 stars because of the channel omit issue i mentioned above.", "Date": "April 22, 2012"}, {"Title": "worth the wait", "Author": "tanders684 \"t-la\"", "ReviewID": "R2OXJ4GP8WXOLN", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I waited a long time to get my first HDTV.

Since some very recent reviews complain about the picture, I wanted to give our experience so far.  The picture is outstanding, setup was easy -- even adding a Sony wi-fi Blu-ray for our first foray into that world -- with pre-existing DirecTV.  Sound is good to quite good.  I was apprehensive about the hookups since we are on a wireless rural tower that has its challenges.  Streaming (NetFlix, Amazon) has been good to excellent and fairly easy to set up as well.  I was reluctant to get rid of the old Toshiba CRT TV with excellent sound and picture, as it was produced back in the day when quality in TVs was reliable.  However, the captain is extremely pleased with this set and so is the admiral (60-somethings).  I was sure the 42-inch screen would be overwhelming since we only sit about 11 feet away, but it's great.  Even photos displayed from our modest point-and-shoot Canon are great. Beautiful screen with non-Blu-ray DVDs, streaming, and HD TV stations, but also very good with non-HD stations.  Excellent with Blu-ray.  Minor point, but the remote is the best ergonomic design I've seen.  We did buy locally since country living makes product returns, especially of this size, painful.

The dynamic contrast settings seem to do a decent job at compensating for the LCD technology though.

HOGG", "ReviewID": "R2PADF6392HXRF", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I picked this up back in June (or July?) from a local not-so-big-box electronics-and-appliances store (they've only got 2 locations) for $469.99 (they price matched HH Gregg without any hassle) + tax - 5% cash back on my Citibank Mastercard... $481.09 total.  Really nice picture quality after spending quite a bit of time tweaking/calibrating the picture (there are tons of picture settings, some meant for a professional calibration).  Very nice picture as long as I'm looking at it straight on (I lost the panel lottery and got a VA panel :( ).PROS:* Lots of inputs!  TWO composite, TWO component (none of that combined component/composite input crap), an RF (wouldn't really be a TV without one :-D ), three HDMI, a VGA (some TV's don't have this), a USB (to view pictures and videos and listen to music from a thumb drive), and a headphone jack (quite a few TV's nowadays don't even have an analog stereo out!)* Nice HD and decent SD picture with natural colors... worlds better than the picture of the 13 year old Sanyo 32\" CRT TV it replaced.  I did have to do quite a bit of messing with settings though and I have the backlight cranked out to nearly the max values.  I'm worried that the backlight will crap out in 5 years or less since this TV runs about 14-16 hours a day at my house.CONS:* The viewing angle of the VA panel!  It's terrible!  The picture looks washed out unless I look at the TV straight on.  At least the stand swivels and I can swivel the TV so I can look at it straight on, but some of the picture is cut off when I swivel it in the entertainment center it sits in.* The sound.  It's not horrible, but the 32\" Sanyo it replaced had MUCH better sound.  Being in an entertainment center cabinet helps the sound somewhat.Overall:  Nice TV and so far so good, but I'm wondering if I would have been better off to pony up the extra $100-$200 for an LED-backlit model since this TV runs 14+ hours a day?  The Sanyo CRT TV is still OK, aside from the cruddy picture quality, after being run 14+ hours daily for 7 1/2 years.UPDATE (1/6/14):  Still fabulous two and half years after purchase.  Awesome picture.  The only reason I'm leaving my review at 4 stars is because of the poor sound quality from the built-in speakers, but most HDTV's have crummy built-in speakers, and this LG set is no exception.", "Date": "January 5, 2012"}, {"Title": "Good product!!", "Author": "Satya", "ReviewID": "R16OJTVJQTB1OY", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Everything about this TV is very is good.

While I like the natural color quality in the regular LCD, my wife liked the crispness of LED-LCD picture and also the thickness of the LED LCD TV was way smaller than the regular LCD TV. While personally I liked the regular LCD better (you get a more natural TV like color feel), my wife liked the LED-LCD (you get a more Computer Monitor like feel). Another thing to note, LG 42LV3500 I received has a matte finish (but don't expect the matte level of computer monitors, there is still some glossiness on LG 42LV3500, but it sure seems like a Matte finish screen. It could even be an IPS panel but I don't know that for sure). LG 42LK450 I received has a glossy finish. Some people might like glossy monitors as opposed to matte and possibly because of the same reason I felt the regular LCD had more natural looking colors.I used the following 1080p video on Youtube to test the TV picture quality and sound quality as well. I got this link when I googled for 1080p songs. This is a song apparently from Indian cinema with A.R. Rehman's music with bright colors in the song. Make sure you change the 360p on the right bottom of the video to 1080p HD before playing the video. Just search for \"ROBO HD VIDEO SONG Endhiran Bluray 1080p x264 DTS 5 1 Raj1402\" in youtube and click on the first link.[..]I used the bluerigger HDMI cable running from my computer to the TV. You can see how this song and it's bright colors fill the screen, it is simply stunning on the TV.Sound qualityIf you want to avoid going through manual audio quality set up, just choose Cinema sound mode (You don't need need to necessarily choose Cinema picture along with Cinema sound, you can choose Cinema sound quality and leave the default/off picture mode) and the cinema mode sound is pretty loud enough for me.Refresh quality [60hz]:Honestly I am yet to notice what people seemed to talk about a lot. I think choosing a HDTV can be a hit or miss depending on the model. So just because a model has 120hz doesn't mean you are gaining something. You might end up losing on the picture quality if that model turns out bad. Same with looking for a SMART wifi TV and taking a gamble on possibly losing out picture quality. I can tell you from my own experience, both LG 42LV3500 and LG 42LK450 have stunning picture quality.If you are going to be watching sports all the time, this may or may not be the right model for you, but I can't really speak for it because i don't watch much sports and i haven't notice any difference on fast moving movie scenes. If you keep looking for a difference, you may notice something that might not even be closely related to the 60hz refresh rate but you might think, \"oh, this might not happen if it was 120hz\". Bottom line, if you are very particular about it, go to Best buy or your friend's place with some fast moving sports video and request them to check your video out on both 60 & 120hz TVs and see if you notice any difference and whether that difference makes any difference to you.Now coming to the POSSIBLE TV return/exchange hassle (I could have just been the unforunate one but Amazon has ensured SO FAR I never felt that way - but I plan to update this review if they don't continue giving me the same comfort feeling with this TV buying experience episode)My first LG 42LK450 arrived with a gaping hole on the center of the box [I guess it happened during shipping]. I REFUSED the delivery. So no real hassle there for me. Courier person offered that I open and find out if there any damage. If I had done that I suppose it would equal to accepting the shipment and then I would have gone through the return process. Anyways, I simply refused the courier person's offer and delivery. Amazon sent me a replacement immediately. The replacement arrived in good shape but when I kept using it, it was emitting a strong plastic smell from behind the TV whenever the TV was on. Amazon was very sorry, created an RMA and it went back to Amazon as well.My first LG 42LV3500 arrived in good shape [i mean the outside box] but had a dent behind the TV that was causing light bleed right at the place of the dent.

There are some reviews out there which are skeptical of the blackness of the picture and quality of moving pictures with the 60hz refresh rate - but I couldn't be happier.  This is my 4th HDTV, 2 crts, 1 lower-end 42\" lcd Black Friday deal from a few years ago and now this 42\" LG LCD.  This is by far the class of the lot, and a real value at under $500.I've got it running 1080p with my Xbox 360, and 480i through my ancient DirecTV box.  Video games and dvds are excellent, the picture is smooth and the colors are quite rich and bold.  Even TV shows look solid with the crappy input quality, which is a pleasant surprise.The sound from the set leaves a little to be desired, but most manufacturers bank on the consumer using an alternative audio system anyways.  I used the TVs built-in speakers for about a day before robbing the 2.1 Altec Lansing system from my desktop.  One nice thing about the TV is that it features a headphone jack as one of the audio output options, so you can hook up darn near any speaker set to it.  I've actually already ordered a higher end 2.1 system with an Optical Input to step-up the quality and return sound to my desktop.Overall, I really couldn't be happier with my purchase.  $500 to spend on a luxury item doesn't fall from the sky often around here, so I like to research my purchases pretty hard before buying.  LG is one of the few manufacturer who produce their own screens, so that's a bit of a perk, and the 1 year warranty through LG is always a plus.  Don't be fooled by critical reviews who expected a $1000 tv set for ~$500. The tv is very aesthetically pleasing, and it's performance will make you smile.Buy without worry.

One thing I noticed, not unique to this TV I'm sure, is that if the received picture is not good quality, it can be worse than on a CRT set. However, when receiving an HD picture on this TV it is impressive -- at times almost 3-D. I like the remote control -- good ergonomic design.This is my first widescreen TV and I don't like the \"stretch\" factor which makes everyone appear very wide! This is not always the case and seems dependent upon the program being broadcast. Fortunately, the remote has a ratio button that allows changing the ratio to be done relatively easily to suit the various broadcast formats being received. But then you sometimes end up with a picture that doesn't fill the whole screen horizontally. Life gets more complicated every day!If I had it to do over, this is the TV I would buy. I considered a \"smart\" TV but decided not to go that route. Their main advantage appears to be the ability to download/stream movies, which I am not into. I understand they give a lot of trouble and many get returned. There's just too much stuff in them to go wrong. Besides, if it's like my recently purchased \"smart phone\" it would be pathetic. The phone does a lot of stuff when it's working but occasionally it decides not to send or receive PHONE CALLS and requires rebooting. Sometimes it reboots itself.

I came across reviews for this LG set, which is slightly bigger, cost about the same, yet has more hdmi inputs as well as headphone jack, among other connection options.I had this item shipped via overnight shipping.SHIPPING:-The tv arrived the next day, but in less than pristine condition. A plastic part from the frame had broken off during transit.Things got worse as I actually hooked up the tv. There were dark vertical lines down the screen, apparent only against a light background, but still quite obvious. What most likely occurred is that the tv was shipped FACE DOWN on the screen. I looked at the box again and noticed that the cardboard grain is vertical and the spacing matched the lines on the tv.This is enough to convince me that shipping a large item in a hurry by harried, hurried, rushed delivery companies during one of the most hectic shopping and shipping periods is not necessarily a good idea.THE TV:PROS:1. lots of connection options: 3 hdmi, speakerphone jack, side hdmi with component in, digital audio out.2. big screen for the price.3. the menu system is intuitive (for the most part) and offers lots of options.4. excellent menu system for calibrating and adjusting the picture.5. sound quality is not bad at all.6. documentation is very good, albeit on a cd.7. LG is thoughtful enough to include a microfiber cleaning clothCONS:1. the tuner is not very good. It doesn't pick up as many stations as the samsung, and is VERY slow to run through all channels in auto tuning.2. picture quality is not very impressive, at least not compared to the samsung.3. customer service is a joke. I called several times and none of the speakers could speak english fluently. They were very confused by some basic questions about inputs and connections.PICTURE QUALITY:The LG was a big disappointment, no pun intended.First, the good news. In ideal circumstances, the LG can give you a very good picture, even an excellent one. For instance, if there is no natural light, and you are watching a perfect high def digital source (a recent film release on blu ray), the LG does in fact look very good.HOWEVER, picture quality with broadcast sources is really bad. It's not clear why, but satellite and over the air digital tv sources look horrible. There is a horrible amount of noise for instance on the local network station, which is less than ten miles away, and broadcasts in 1080i.With satellite tv, pixelation, artifacts and noise are very apparent. The samsung handles both broadcast and satellite sources with ease, however.Also, the LG's picture is much darker, the colors less saturated and they are not as accurate as on the samsung. Samsung color accuracy is excellent: the blues on avatar are beautiful for instance.By comparison, it seems almost impossible to get a nice looking picture color wise, with the LG. I spent many hours using the picture wizard as well as manually adjusting the multiple picture settings on my own. Regardless, the picture seems too dark even with contrast settings set to near max, and everything seemed to have a gold/brown/green cast. It almost seemed as if outdoor scenes were always filmed at dusk, or indoor scenes in poor lighting.Given these serious problems with picture quality, I am puzzled by this tv's stellar reviews. It's likely that the majority of buyers are stepping up from old CRT's or older generation lcd's and find this unit a big step up.However, I am comparing this set to a new samsung, and the differences in quality are very noticeable. The bottom line is that it's not fun watching broadcast tv on this LG. The picture is always noisy, even with very strong signals broadcast in 1080i.Do yourself a favor and take a look at a samsung.", "Date": "January 1, 2012"}, {"Title": "Great Value TV", "Author": "heymatan", "ReviewID": "R26Q7HHPQKLCQS", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I bought this TV as an upgrade from the 32 inch 2010 model (32LD450), both of them have been great TVs for my relatively basic needs.

It either dims the screen so much you can barely see what's on, or jarringly goes back and forth between bright/dark.

It is what you get for the price, a lower end HDTV.I had previously owned a Samsung, and its picture quality was superior to this TV.The HD picture quality is reasonably good, though not as good as my previous TV. The picture quality for the SD channels is not at all up to the mark.Also, the TV does not have an inbuilt antenna to catch over the air channels (or has one that did not catch any channels for me).I got one for ten bucks at RadioShack. Some of the OTA channels show disturbance when I press \"Info\" on the remote.I don't know if this will be true for cable also. I have no intention of having cable, and I plan to integrate this with my Logitech revue, which I ordered this week from Amazon. We will see how that works out.The sound is not terribly good, but I always have my TV sound hooked up to the speaker, so I don't care. I am not too picky about sound too. Also, the TV software does not show information about program schedules of a particular channel. It only shows the current program, and the next one, and thats it.So, all in all, a no frills TV. Don't expect too much out of it. The price point is what won me over. I plan to combine it with a smart box, and make it as smart as I want. The price on the TV leaves enough on my wallet to go for a top notch smart box. I am not much of a cable watcher. I watch most of my stuff over the net.

Also darker scenes just aren't as crisp on the LG and the volume on the panasonic seems deeper and louder.  The brown sticker on the bottom of the looks cheap to me.  As to the other reviewers who complain about the smell, I agree with you and it took a good week to clear the smell out.  Where this does edge out the panny is NO dead pixels out of the box.  Good QC LG!  I also like the swivel stand, Panny doesn't have that.  LG starts up about 3 seconds faster if that matters to you and has better menus.So in summary 1 point off for motion blur and 1 point off for the brown sticker and smell.

This TV size fits perfectly in my bedroom.I first purchased another popular brand Vizio 32\" LED and it was not heavy to lift, it only weight about 4 or 5 lbs., but I was very unhappy with it. Maybe the one I received was defective, but I had to return it because the color looked faded on all channels and sound was terrible.  The sound, sounded like you were in a tunnel.I ordered the LG 32LK450 HDTV online and received Free Shipping for this particular model, which I had no idea that it would be FedEX overnight from the company I ordered it from. That was a plus for me, because my old TV died and I needed a new one right away. I'm very happy that I decided on LG 32LK450 model, after researching the Internet for reviews, and it showed good ratings. I did know that LG made great cell phones, but had no idea that their HDTV's were this good. LG gave me great customer service when I had some questions about the setup.

Most VA cases I have seen are 32 or 37 inch.  I received it and got unlucky with the \"D\" panel which usually means VA instead of IPS. I  ran the loupe test and confirmed that it's 100% VA.Pros: Cheap, Nice picture, plenty of inputs, looks good with 360, decent input lag, nice basic features, the blacks are pretty good.Cons: Ugly brown bottom, chance of getting VA, very barebones, there's no way my VA version has 4ms response time.Overall, I would have rated this tv a five but just because LG runs the panel lottery ima give it -1.I've yet to run 4:4:4 chroma. I've heard mixed reviews to whether or not the VA panel can do so. Ill come back and edit it later.If your really picky about IPS i'd stay away from buying this model on Amazon.", "Date": "January 17, 2012"}, {"Title": "OK - But you get what you pay for ?", "Author": "James F.

The biggest problem was that all so fashionable black piano gloss bezel. I am so not-into that annoying shine some think looks awesome that I already purchased big value pack of 1200 grid sanding paper to deal with the problem. I looked at ViewSonic 42 inch ( have 2 wide screen computer monitors from them) but it was not in stock and price was 150 bucks more for no reason. About shiny frame - you watch TV and on top of frame light reflection from behind you see also picture reflection of the TV in the frame as well. Therefore, my choice was this LG model 42LK450 after checking, looking, testing, reading reviews and deciding what I want - cool TV, not a headache. IT DOES HAVE SHINY FRAME - BUT IT DOES NOT GIVE REFLEXION PROBLEM DUES TO THE WAY IT IS POSITIONED. Some complain about sound - well, takes 5 seconds with remote to turn sound setting to Music or Cinema and you are fine - it is changing sound EQ settings and dynamic response. Better yet - get sound system with the sub if you like house shaking and do not expect 500 Watts hyper bass and heavenly treble from unit that measures couple of inches in thickness. One mention here - the audio out is fiber optic which is excellent because no magnetic distortions and hum noise, but your sound system will need to have that and many do (good fiber audio 6ft long can be purchased on Amazon for something like 6 bucks). Bottom line why this TV:1. LED LCD with very good picture at about half k price delivered2. fully and in detail adjustable picture3. few sound modes4. solid construction (I stay away from cheap because they cost too much eventually)5. watching picture one can tell if it is SD or HD - this TV is not faking output6. many different inputs including regular VGA and flat mount HDMI for wall hanging7. component and composite input for any new or old DVD player you may have8. USB for firmware update and whatever you fancy and9. NO REFLEXION FROM THE FRAME without having to sand it down (it is 90 degrees flat and resonably thin yet strong)10. NO REFLEXION FROM THE SCREEN - it is made OEM semi- matte like good quality computer monitors11. nice digital TV tuner antenna input - you can retire your PITA analog converter boxand use LG TV remote to control off the air channelsYou could spent 2k on same size TV that will have some more goodies, like Netflix net connect, very high refresh, or be programmed to make coffee and walk your dog (just kidding), but considering technology fast pace, I am happy to have 42 inch Hi-Res screen from no-nonsense TV made by reputable manufacturer that works so well. I will buy OLED as my next TV, I am certain, but for today, winter 2011, I am very happy with my decision on this LG model. I wish you could see and hear the latest Celtic Woman concert on this television running on PBS off the air now when I type this review - it feels absolutely and positively divine.", "Date": "December 5, 2011"}, {"Title": "Amazing TV for a Fabulous Price", "Author": "tech*geek", "ReviewID": "R239CN2GCBSKNO", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I'm currently using this in my college dorm room and plan on using it for as long as it lasts.  The tv has a glossy black  black finish on the base and edge of the tv which looks nice.  Whats not as nice is the fact that there can be some bad glare off the screen due to this glossy like finish on the screen.  The function buttons on the television are all touch sensitive but I do NOT think they are very responsive, there are times where i try touching them like an ipod screen and times when i feel like I have to mash down in order to get a response. Moral of that story, don't lose your remote!!!!The remote itself has a matte black finish and is ergonomic in the fact that when you pick it up your thumb will hover right over the volume, channel, mute, and home buttons and using those all feel very comfortable.  If you want to access the number buttons or setting sbuttons you'll have to shift your hand up or down, the remote feels very long, but the buttons here are really responsive :)The inputs on this tv are what you will expect on this class, a composite, hdmi, headphones output, and usb input on the left side of the tv *** whats nice is that none of these are visible when viewing the tv, they're tucked away slightly behind the tv.  As a result of this, there is not a real accessibility difference between these side and back inputs.  My favorite inpt on this tv is the RGB PC input.  using this with my lenovo thinkpad there are times when the tv doesn't recognize the pc, but after unplugging and replugging the RGB cable back in the resolution and color is incredible.  This means watching videos and movies from your laptop is made easy, and using it as a dual monitor is EASY!!!Then the major use I get out of the TV comes from the Xbox 360.  There is no motion lag from playing games like Halo, or Madden and split screen gaming has never looked better.There are extensive options for adjusting color and picture settings, as well as a consumer friendly color calibrating option.  If you have any questions about specifics here feel free to ask, but you most likely wont have to adjust these setings too much.  the color was calibrated just fine when used as a photoshop monitor for my laptop.The price was perfect, amazon shipped it for 4 dollars overnight with amazon prime, that's flat out amazing.

One thing I'm really impressed with is the HD image and the sound at this price range.  I've seen more expensive TV's that don't perform as well (that might be age, though).If you are not too much of an audio-videophile, or haven't even made the jump to HD (like my sorry butt until recently) then you're gonna LOVE this TV for just about all your video entertainment needs.It has a good enough amount of inputs for me.  The 2 HDMI and 1 on the side, 1 AV and 1 on the side, RGB, 2 component are all there... and a USB but haven't used that yet.  It also has DVI audio and Optical audio which I don't have or use.  I have pretty basic needs.  I have a ROKU player and watching Mad Men on netflix looks awesome.  The volume output is perfect for me.  It has some cool features in regards to that, but whatever, it sounds good.  Play with the settings (I find that can change the quality dramatically for different situations and inputs).One drawback on my order, it was manufactured in Mexico and came with a broken power supply, and so was shorting out when it powered up.  LG, mad props to them, because they had somebody come out within a week, a very nice service guy, and he replaced it at my house within a day or so.  No having to lug it out anywhere.  Obviously, it is what they had to do in order for me to not be totally angry and furious.  Once my TV worked and wasn't filling my house with smoke and noxious poison... I was a lot happier.  So, that worked out.  Just be aware that if smoke and bad smells happen, it's not normal.  The factory repairman from LG said that it probably occured in the factory, which it appeared to me to be the case.  Again, once it was repaired, it worked great.I don't want to blab on about it.  Probably a good TV for your guest/kids room if you're snooty about the picture.

When the price came down significantly on Thanksgiving Day, we jumped on it and got a great deal. Since it is a Christmas gift, we all had to wait to see if it measured up to all the reviews. Our experience so far has been that it is OK but nothing to be impressed with. The color image was poor to begin with so we used the menu options to find the best picture quality which is great until you save the changes and then try to watch sometbing. There is a feature on this unit that automatically adjusts to the lighting in the room. The TV appears to be trying to make adjustments constantly which causes the color quality to be affected and the image gets washed out. We are still trying to find a way to turn this off in hopes the color image can improve. We may eventually find a solution but for now, I would not purchase another LG LCD TV knowing I would have to constantly be trying to get it to look acceptable.", "Date": "December 31, 2011"}, {"Title": "Calibration", "Author": "C.
