The adjustable shelf is attached by screws, and I realized after I put it in that my Wii was too tall to fit on the space I left.  So you should definitely buy it, but measure your components before you screw in the shelves.  It was pretty easy to fix though, so no worries.  It is designed to work with the big DLP Mitsubishi HDTVs, so don't buy this unless you are planning to use it with one of those.  It is set up to lock into the bottom of the TV and hold it down.", "Date": "November 19, 2009"}, {"Title": "Great stand, but a bit expensive", "Author": "s-kaf \"Sam\"", "ReviewID": "RXMGDLCS4VTD1", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "The stand arrived in a large box, because it's fully assembled (for the most part).  All you have to do is mount the horizontal bar (to support the adjustable shelf), screw in a couple of support brackets for the horizontal bar, and put the shelf on the bar.  That's it.  This took just a couple of minutes to do.  Overall, the fit and finish is excellent, and the build quality is excellent too.  However, it's rather expensive for what it's worth.  $400 dollars for a TV stand seems high (and $500 that some retailers are charging for it is simply ridiculous).Nevertheless, I'm very happy with it, especially since it's custom made for Mitsubishi DLP TVs; and was, for all intents and purposes, fully assembled (plus shipping was free...that could be upwards of $50-100 right there).  I highly recommend this as a good investment for the Mitsubishi 73\" home theater TV's that this stand was designed for.  Besides, if you consider all the other stands out there, I found it rather difficult to find a good one that would even hold a TV of this size...most seem to be designed for 65\" or less LCD's.  So this may be one of the few choices available for a TV 73\" or larger.  Still a good pick, however.On a related note, I considered using one of the TV setup and installation services Amazon advertises...$100 for TV setup, and furniture assembly for an additional $99. I'm glad I didn't consider this, because there was really nothing to assemble furniture-wise, and I asked the driver about TV setup (I just purchased the TV today, because I wanted to have time to setup the stand for it first)...he said they typically unbox it, and place it on the stand for you (but no hookups, picture adjustments, etc).  If you're technically-inclined (there typically isn't much to hooking up AV equipment, unless you have an overly-complex theater setup), and can spend an hour or two adjusting the TV's picture to your liking, then you can save the $218 over using the hookup and furniture assembly service.", "Date": "February 25, 2010"}, {"Title": "Nice stand for the 73\" DLP", "Author": "D.

I somewhat knew to expect it damaged because of reviews I have read about UPS items shipping that are heavy weight.  UPS will not let you open package and see if it is damage.  Package was in decent condition.  After opening up the lower shelf had a crack in it.  the TV shelf was pulled away from the side support on one side.  Might not be only UPS fault but the stand is made of pressed particle board.  I am not going to send back the stand. It is very hard to see damage when viewing.  The crack on lower shelf is hidden by a component and the top shelf connection to the side support is not to noticeable.  I will buy some black paint to and hide the damage.  As to the stand itself usage.  The center glass shelf support does not do a good at holding much weight.  I never did see any specs on weight support for the center shelf.  With my AVR and center speaker on the shelf it sag quite a bit.  I ended up cutting two 4 inch pieces of wood and sprayed paint them black.  I then put them under the glass shelf about a third of the way from the sides. No more center glass shelf sagging.  One of the reasons I bought this stand is that the center shelf was adjustable which is A1.  The WD73740 locks in just fine.  I got the stand a day later after the TV arrive so the TV was on the floor at first.  Really a good stand for usage but I wish it was more quality built to with stand damage in shipping.  The particle board just to cheap.  Really like the stand besides the mention quality.  Would buy again.  Looks great.  Especially like the adjustable center shelf.

I asked the men handling the delivery to bring in the stand first, which they did.  Upon unboxing the stand I found all parts required for installing the glass middle shelf and fastening the set to the stand were present.  The stand itself was in perfect condition, with no chips, scrapes or scratches. Installing the middle glass shelf and fastening the set to the stand was very simple and straightforward.  I especially like the way the top shelf of the stand is constructed, allowing the base of the TV to kind of \"nest\" in the top shelf.  That feature, plus the bracket which fastens the set to the stand in back makes for a very secure union of the two pieces.  The glass shelf can be installed at any one of five different heights, thereby giving you a good deal of flexibility as to its positioning.  This shelf is sturdy enough to hold both my DirecTV receiver and my new Panasonic BluRay player, as well as the center speaker of my surround sound system.  All in all, I feel the two units together present a very pleasing unified appearance and I'm really not sure how this stand is inferior to the other 73 inch stand which Amazon sells for an additional $100.00.

Scroll down and check the details.OK, now I've mounted my 73738 on this stand, and it fits perfectly.The support for the glass shelf is a padded piece of steel square tubing, and the rear supports are pinned in place. I find the shelf PLENTY sturdy.Also, I went to the store to get some felt gliders for this stand.

I think the base is overpriced considering it is made of particle board and one piece of glass.  It needs some panels on the back to hide all the wires, and ideally some doors on the front to protect components from dust accumulation.Summary:  I opted to bite the price bullet to avoid the necessary search to find a TV base that was the right size and looked good with the TV.
