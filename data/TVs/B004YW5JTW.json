They do not provide a code to \"plug in\" to your other remote, so you have to find this set's remote and keep it close to turn it off and on and with some systems, I am sure, change volume.  That is very annoying.  I can barely keep my beer in sight let alone two remotes ... \"arrrrggggghhhhh!!! wherzza r'mote\" is the phrase heard while running this TV.", "Date": "February 20, 2013"}, {"Title": "Do not buy this especialy from HPP Enterprises", "Author": "mkwrench", "ReviewID": "RSCYC9IOXBMG8", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "Im reviewing my seller and the product. If you buy this TV you will be dissapointed, the picture was acceptable untill it stopped working 26 days after purchase, the sound is horrible so it will need patched through a reciever, the menus and operating system were slow and clunky. There are also no universal remote codes for these cheap TVs, so you will need an IR learning remote. I purchased this TV from HPP Enterprises, who shipped promptly but in the original packaging without covering it. The original packaging was damaged beyond use by shippers, the contants inside the box appeared undamaged. I tried to return the product for a replacement or refund (within HPP's 30 day period) only to find that HPP Enterprises will not accept returns without the original packaging and considers the matter closed. Im not a pack-rat or hordrer who hangs on to old cardboard so I do not have the box. HPP Enterprises has my money and I threw the piece of crap TV in the trash (should have thrown the money in the trash). Lesson learned: Do not buy products like this based on price. : Do not buy from HPP Enterprises, unless youre a packrat or horder who can hold on to all of your shipping containers, in which case they would likeley have a backup excuse to not honor their return policy anyhow. I hopes this helps someone and steers them from HPP Enterprises and buying products based only on price. I had to rate this at one star only because Amazon would not allow me to put zero stars, which beter represents how I feel about this POS and its POS seller", "Date": "September 16, 2012"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "$419.99", "Features": "HDMI Inputs\nSleep Timer Function\nMulti Language on Screen Display\nFull Function Remote Control\nVesa Compliant", "Name": "Supersonic SC-3211 32-Inch 60Hz LED-Lit TV", "ImgURL": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51R1F%2BYqCKL._SX300_.jpg", "ProductID": "B004YW5JTW"}}
