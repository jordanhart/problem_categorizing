{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Best in it's class", "Author": "HookEmHorns", "ReviewID": "R2YOZ4POF9KRSC", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I have had a Westinghouse 1080p 42inch monitor for a few years and have really been pleased with it.  However, with the new features on the market (120hz, 24p, etc) I was ready to upgrade.  I initially ordered a Samsung LN46A550 46-Inch 1080p LCD HDTV.  The picture was actually really good on this set, but the glare on the case was VERY annoying.  It also lacked the features I was looking for in a new set, but I tried it out because the price was so good.  The glare was too much to put up with, so I sent it back and started to research Sony's since they are one of the few sets on the market that you can still get without a glossy case.I sure am glad that I found Bravia Z series!  WIthout going up to an XBR, the Z series is the way to go.  If you look at the specs - most of the high end features offered by the XBR are already in the Z series, so it is a really good value when viewed that way.  It makes sense why the Z is not offered in a 52 inch size - it would probably really impact sales of the XBR.  What a great looking TV (both the picture and the case).  I have been extremely impressed with both the blacks on this LCD as well as the vivid colors it produces.  The amount of picture calibration offered on this setup is remarkable - especially compared to my old Westinghouse.  I find the 24p mode on Blue Ray disk to be quite impressive - it really adds a whole new level of enjoyment to watching Blue Ray movies.  The 120hz mode is also wonderful when watching football.  I really cannot say enough good things about this TV - spend the extra money that the Sony brand demands, and you get what you pay for.Although I did not have the issue with this TV, there is a lot of discussion around the Internet about a sparkle issue that this TV has.  Be advised that this was an issue, but Sony has released a firmware update that resolves the problem.  I have done the update and everything is running great.If you are on the fence between this and the Samsung LN46A650 (which is in the same feature class as the Sony), be aware that the Samsung has a very glossy screen - not to mention a sure to be dated red outline on the case.  This really kills one of the great features of LCD's!  The only Samsung I would even consider against this Sony is the Samsung LN46A550 46-Inch 1080p LCD HDTV, but it lacks 120hz, 24p, and has that hideous glossy case.  It seems to me that there is no viable competitor to the Sony Bravia Z-Series KDL-46Z4100!Another side note... When my TV was delivered they also picked up the Samsung for return.  The delivery guys were telling me that they have to pickup Samsungs EVERY day because people are returning them.  He said they have never had to pickup a Sony.  This is proved if you look at the used/new link under the Samsung and Sony's - you will see tons of open box Amazon Warehouse Deals on the Samsungs - but none on the Sony's!", "Date": "October 12, 2008"}, {"Title": "Awesome PQ and no glare!", "Author": "John", "ReviewID": "ROMOKXAP4EYPW", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I decide on the 46z4100S for the following reasons;a) No glossy screen glare or bezel glare!b) small bezel, allowing larger screen on wall spacec) 3\" depth on \"in-wall mount\"d) 1080P/120HZ/motion controlThe Picture Quality is so crystal clear......... just great!

Five stars, for sure.", "Author": "forhakim", "ReviewID": "R1L7UUQ8C6R3WZ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I had been researching TV's for about a month or so. I knew I wanted an LCD in the 42\"-50\" range, backed by a trusted brand name, with if not cutting edge technology then at least most of the latest and greatest features on current high-end models. This because a TV is something I buy and use for many years, and I don't want my set to become obsolete two years from purchase date. So after reading many product specifications, manufacturers' descriptions, reviews from other users and professional reviewers, and spending many hours walking through electronics stores and looking at displays, I picked the Sony Bravia KDL-46Z4100. The next closest contender was the KDL-46W4100. However, the Z series won out, although it was a couple of hundred dollars more expensive, for these reasons:- Much better looking set (I'm talking about the physical TV here) with a very slim bezel and all-black design, as opposed to the two-tone black and silver of the W.- 10 bit color processor, which gives far more on-screen colors. I didn't think this was a big deal, until I saw a W and Z series side by side in a store, and the display happened to show a sunset. The W had distinct bands of color, while the Z had a gradual change of color.- DLNA. I don't use this option yet, but it's nice to know that I can if I want to. I have a PS3, which also has DLNA, and I use that to beam images/music/video from my computer to my TV. The reason I use the PS3 is because its DLNA capability is wireless, while the TV's is not. This is an important caveat for those to whom the TV's DLNA capability is important. There are ways to make it work wirelessly, like hooking up a bridge, but I have not tried that. However, just know that out of the box, the TV can't do wireless DLNA.I also compared this TV with the XBR series, and found that it has almost all the features XBR has but for many hundreds of dollars less. I just didn't see any huge benefit in going for the XBR versus this model.As for comparison with other brands: I did consider Samsung, LG, Sharp, and others, but only Samsung seemed to have products that could take on Sony's Bravias in terms of picture quality and features. However, in my humble opinion, Samsung shot themselves in the foot by putting glossy screens on their LCD's, thus defeating one of the primary purposes people are moving from plasma to LCD. This is something I read about and didn't think was a huge difference until I did a side-by-side comparison in the store. The Samsung ToC models reflected the image from the TV displays across the room. The Bravias did not. I have a living room with many windows, so this instantly killed the Samsung's chances.As for this TV: I can't say enough good things about it. If you are a techno geek, there are enough settings and features to keep you busy playing with them and setting them for days. If you are not, and just want to take it out of the box and use it, then it works too because setup couldn't be simpler. Just set it where you want it, hook up the power, connect your DVD/STB/receiver/box etc, and it's good to go. You can tweak settings to your heart's content, but don't have to. I was amazed by the picture right out of the box. The first movie we watched was Wall-E on Blu Ray, and the picture just blew my mind. We also watched a few episodes of Lost, and there were various scenes where the picture almost looked 3-dimensional, like looking out a window. Just amazing colors. We actually paused the show a few times to admire the picture. :) Oh, and the surround sound speakers are pretty good too. I hooked up my USB flash drive directly into the TV, and played a few songs from there via the TV's speakers, and it sounded very crisp. I'm not an audiophile, but to my ears it sounded more than satisfactory.Is the 120Hz a big deal? Here's something anecdotal (and the sample size is only one), but for what it's worth: I was standing in the store and looking at the display on this TV for a few minutes. Then I turned around and looked at another TV that was showing the same display but had a refresh rate of 60Hz. I instantly started getting a headache. This is not a definitive scientific test, but I thought I'd mention it.Nice little touch: the TV stand has a screw-hole in the back to fix it to the unit it is sitting on, to prevent the TV from toppling over if pulled too hard. You don't have to use this, because the stand is sufficiently wide and deep to take the weight, but just good to have. I don't know if all such TV's come with stands that have this. I appreciated this because I have a 2-year old child at home. It will take two people to lift the TV and set it up, either on its stand or wall mount. The TV is light enough that I can lift it on my own, but I'd rather be cautious with an expensive electronic device. I'm also happy that the box fit on the back seat of my Maxima, otherwise I would have to hire a truck to bring it home.Complaints: The remote is too large, and is a basic universal remote. It works just fine for this TV, and will also probably work fine with most other standard devices, but lacks the very important learning feature. I actually like the layout of buttons and the ergonomic design, just not the size and the lacking feature set. Also, the slim bezel around the TV is high-gloss, so it reflects light from other sources. Nitpicking here, but I wish it were matt.", "Date": "December 1, 2008"}, {"Title": "top notch lcd tv", "Author": "Michael Dobey", "ReviewID": "R20DNXPTV03UTL", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Many folks are going for the samsung lcds because the blacks look blacker.but those tv's have a glass screen that reflects everything.  This tv is sharper than a xbr4 or xbr5 , those were last years models.  the engine in this tv is equivalent to a xbr6.  I replaced a great 50 inch sony sxrdtv with this one. Sony's newer 52's didn't have all the features of this one.  the s, v, and w's are fine tv's but they don't have deep color the new color standard that future discs will have.  Nor do they have x.v. color which is here already and is used in digital photos.  this one does.  the w does have 24fps or film speed that words with a ps3 or blu ray player to show a movie in it's real speed.  Of course this isn't a benefit for older dvd's as they are processed in a 2:3 rate anyways.  that means that one frame is dropped for every 3 shown.  but for blu ray this feature rocks.  And like ALL lcds standard non hd tv looks ok but they don't put standard tv on in showrooms. so people take these tv's home and expect it to look like HD content.  this is true for all lcds, plasmas , lcos , dlp's and the rest. But this tv  shines with hd content and blu ray.  However,  I will miss the extra four inches of screen. but this tv is in many ways future proof for a while.  the 120hz feature for motion and other features make it one of the best tv's made so far.  The toshiba 540 and 550 series are comparible but this tv is the clearest of the new tv's.  xbr 7's will come soon but they will be much more expensive. the jump in size from 46\" to 52\" is also a  substantial jump in price. So I can live with a 46\" tv with this quality.  This tv took 2 days to get to denver. which is great! I picked it up myself as the box and tv are not too large and this means I don't have to hang around waiting for a delivery.  I would say that if you have a smaller tv 46' or less go down to ceva wharehouse and get it yourself.  This tv though with it's three key features: deep color, x.v. color and 24p or 24 frames per second film speed for blu ray only I would say make this tv in many ways future proof.  I knew when I bought the sxrd that new technology wasn't far off that technology is here on the sony z series and it's good enough on the sony to make the tv  a keeper for many , many years.", "Date": "September 20, 2008"}, {"Title": "Highly recommend this TV", "Author": "Michael A.

For example, I watched \"I am Legend\" and it looked so realistic, it was shocking.Can't wait to see how Blue-Ray will look.There are clearly many features I am yet to explore, like the ability to store pictures in the TV.Really awesome investment.

It was a great TV that I had purchased 5 years ago on sale for $190 at Circuit City. It still amazes me that after 5 moving (inter/intra cities and states) and after 4 TV stands this set stands like a rock (No really! It is that heavy).Anyway, my quest started off with the first question that almost anyone would have at the beginning. Plasma vs. LCD. After reading tons of articles, comments and reviews on this subject I concluded that both were superior technologies and one couldn't go wrong choosing either one. It was a personal choice then.Contradictory to my opinion \"personal choice\" really isn't that easy as it sounds. This being my first HDTV I had a whole bunch of questions creating chaos in my mind with zero answers to fight them off.My requirements list looked something like this:  * Budget < $2000 (incl. tax, shipping and other basic cables)  * Size > 40 inches but less than 50 inches  * Preferred the best or second best brands in that technology. This is usually debatable but my choices were pretty clear with Sony and Samsung as one and two for LCDs and Pioneer and Panasonic for Plasma's respectively.  * Low power consumption  * Low heat emissions  * Deep blacks (as much as possible)  * Reasonably good speakers  * 120 Hz for a LCDLuckily, some very personal choices like low electricity consumption and less heat emissions nailed my choice to a LCD pretty quickly.So I started looking in to the Sony and Samsung lineups. Amazon had certain TVs with 5 stars based on 400+ reviewers. But once I checked them out at Fry's it was clear that they had a reflection problem. My living room has two huge windows and that would make it impossible to ignore it. Even otherwise when I looked at a Sony and its Samsung counter-part it was pretty clear that Sony was way ahead in clarity (No, I do not own a single Sony product).From that point I concentrated solely on finding the best possible Sony for my budget and other requirements. In about an hour it was clear that the XBR line-ups were out of my price range. So I started delving into the Z-series which is the top of the line non-XBR set from Sony. In fact I think Sony never made a 46'+ on this series to avoid XBR's sales drop. The S-series seemed to lack many of today's technology and the W-series was just today's technology that would be outdated in six months. The V-series fit somewhere in between. So clearly Z-series was the one.My research made it easy to narrow down the retailers to Costco and Amazon. This is heavily biased and can be debatable again. For that very reason it is pointless to list my reasons on picking these retailers here.Costco seemed to promote Sharp, Samsung and Vizio and hardly had Sony in its lineup. Amazon on the other hand had the Z-series for a huge discount (30% for the black which was my preference). While I debated and kept reading articles on the \"best time to buy a HDTV\" it became clearer that the answer could only be \"when you are ready to buy\". So I placed the order on Amazon.comI am waiting for my set to arrive. Will update on the experience once I get through it.UPDATE:----------In my last post I wrote about my experience in ordering a Sony LCD from Amazon.com. I had ordered a KDL-46Z4100 (black) from Amazon on the 29th of October and the delivery estimate was the 8th of November. They did better ... it was delivered on the 5th.The logistics was handled by Eagle/CEVA and they called up and gave us a time range of 9 to 1. It was delivered around 12:30. I was happy with the way everything was handled and would definetely recommend Amazon/CEVA after my experiences.Note: CEVA delivery guys said that even though Amazon promises white glove delivery which includes setting up the TV on its pedestal CEVA does not authorize them to do it. It was not tough to get it on to the pedestal but I was a bit curious to know why Amazon doesn't mention this online.", "Date": "November 10, 2008"}, {"Title": "First LCD TV", "Author": "O.

I recommend adjusting the following.1.  Turn off Cinemotion - made normal TV difficult to follow as it forced odd panning.2.  Turn off Motion Enhancer - also caused odd picture distortion.3.  Turn on the light sensor - the brightness of the picture adjusts with the light in the room, and is much more balanced instead of being overpowering and almost blinding.4.

I rule out Samsung due to the glare.  Finally did the purchase during black friday. (Cheaper by now).  Matched it with PS3, Tversity (free software as media server), Logitech Z5500.Pros:  1: PQ is exceptional. Especially with blu-ray.  720p material is also stunning via PS3.  DVD without upscaler are so-so, however, after upscale with PS3, it is acceptable viewing from 6 feet and beyond.  2: Minimal glare, still some with direct light shine upon it.  However, if viewing angle is within 30 degress, it is acceptable.  3: 120hz, or motion enchancement is great, have to see it to appreciate it.  4: Price drop every other week since Thanksgiving.  You can spend less than $1500 to have it.  Nothing in such price range can compare with the z series.Cons:  1: Very blocky output for low resolution materials such as PS1 games, VCD's, mpeg1.  Need to view those blocky images from at least 8 feet away to avoid getting a headache.  2: Took more than one time (initial setup) to get most of the digital channels from cable line without cable box, and still get the channels with wrong network labels.  3: Optical output is wonky while the on board speaker just suck.  4: DLNA for photo viewing only, kind of pathetic.  5: Don't expect the Sony tech support team to help with any issues.Conclusion:  All the cons cannot out weight the fact the z4100 looks so good with the picture and the thin bezel.

I have purchased 4 LCDs and one plasma from Amazon and delivery was excellent.  The plasma was defective but it was not a result of anything the deliverers did wrong.

I have always known Sony TVs to be high quality and reliable........until now.I babied this puppy on delivery, as if it were fine crystal.  It sits on top of a cabinet, free-standing, with plenty of ventilation in a large room.  For 23 days it worked great.

It didn't even work with my Sony DVD player  --just random vertical lines and no sound.  I called Sony.  They put me in touch with their technical repair contractor, QualServe.  They sent a tech 8 days later.  The guy replaced the heart of the thing....the main processor and circuit board.  No change.  He was stumped and called Sony.

I originally bought a samsung ln40a550, but wasn't very happy with it. I really don't like that most manufacturers have gone to the glossy frames. It's just stupid. Any ambient light source is going be be reflected and distract from the picture you're trying to see. The samsungs (and most others) have a wide bezel (frame) that creates more of a problem. This Sony's bezel is only about 1 inch wide. The other issue with the samsung I bought was the fact that they make the middle range models with lcd displays supplied by multiple manufacturers, and of varying quality. You can't tell which one you get until you open the box. Go to google and search 'samsung bait and switch'. It's interesting, there used to be an amazon discussion called 'Amazon.com: Customer Discussions: Samsung \"S\" panel bait and switch?' that had a lot of good info about this issue, but Amazon removed it. (I can't say I care for Amazon censoring these discussions as long as they're not obscene or something). I guess it was causing too many people to return their samsungs. Bottom line on the panels.S = made by samsung at samsung factoryA = made by auo for samsung -outsourcedC = Made by chi-me for samsung - outsourcedThe quality appears to go from best = S to worst = C.Anyway, I returned the samsung, did some more research and bought this tv. I like it. The 40 inch just didn't cut it, needed something bigger. Some movies are in a widescreen format that is even wider than 16:9, so you need the bigger screen to get a watchable size.I also wanted the 120hz refresh rate with the 'motionflow' software. Judder is something that I've noticed before, and it bothers me. I don't see it on this tv.One very good recommendation, that I found in another amazon discussion,(see: Darkness and dullness in the picture quality of the KDL46z4100) is to disable the automatic light sensor. It doesn't appear to work very well, and most of the people who wrote in were complaining about the picture being kind of dark. Once you do that, the picture is outstanding.

I pretty much knew that I wanted an LCD, so I didn't really look at plasmas.  It basically quickly came down to Sony vs. Samsung.  I have a PS3 and love Sony, so Sony probably had a slight advantage in my eye.  I viewed many different tv's in various electronic stores, and there are truly many great pictures out there.  I basically decided I wanted a Sony (saw more reviews about technical issues with Samsungs and just always trust Sony) and for about a month I had my eye on the 46xbr6.  I then was slightly torn between the 46xbr6 and the 40xbr7, which I could have gotten for the same price.  However, I was worried that the 40 would be too small (and now that I bought the 46 incher, I'm happy I did).  I was relatively close to pulling the trigger on the 46xbr6, when I was strolling through the Sony store and talking with a rep.  He said he thought the 46z4100 was probably the best bang for the buck, and had all the essential high end features of the xbr6, less the built in sub-woofer (I know there are other minor differences).  The z series was also very slim and stylish, very nice looking set.  I checked out the picture and it was super clear, and I knew that hardly anyone but a professional would notice any difference between this tv and a more expensive model once it was in my house.  I saw the price on Amazon for the z, about $500 less than the xbr6, and I pulled the trigger.Let me tell you, I am extremely pleased with this tv and so glad that I did the research and went with the model I did.  The picture quality is stunning!  I'm using the settings for this TV found on Tweak TV and it seems very nicely calibrated (very good basic setting if you don't have calibration software).  Colors are great, blacks are deep; peoples faces look very clear and lifelike.  The PS3, with both games and movies, is picture perfect!  So fun to play PS3 games and watch Blu Rays on this setup.  I also got Comcast HD cable hooked up and the picture quality is stunning on that as well.Some have complained about the speakers, but I find them quite adequate and actually more than enough for the average person (quite fine for me).  You have to make sure to go into the sound options and turn on the surround sound feature.  You can also mess with individual settings, I like Dynamic with treble 7, bass 9, s-force surround and voice zoom +2.The TV is great, and for the price I got I just couldn't be more satisfied.  I run everything through 2 Mediabridge high speed HDMI 1.3b category 2 cables that I got for a great price on Amazon as well ($9.99 each).As far as Amazon, the experience was quite excellent as well, and I'll not be afraid to purchase from them again.  I ordered the TV on 2/12/09 at about 11:00 p.m. and received the TV by noon on 2/18/08 and the shipping was free.  That coupled with no taxes made this one heck of a deal, and I saved at least $600 or more over the best deal at any store.  Additionally, the price dropped $120 a few days after I ordered, and I found the customer service number on here and called.  They quickly agreed to give me a credit for the $120, no questions asked.  The overall experience was great.  (I assume this price match may have been because this TV was offered directly through Amazon, not some other vendor.  They may offer price match with the other vendors, but not sure)Very Happy!(p.s., there seems to be absolutely no clouding or \"sparkle\" on my tv, not sure if those problems were just with the first few shipments of this series or if I just got a good tv, but there seem to be zero technical flaws with my set)*update: just upgraded to the newest software version 205r.  This update is really nice and seems like it improved the picture quality on my set.  It looks close to perfect now; I recommend updating by downloading from the Sony site, it's quick and easy.  I've never had any issues with any prior software versions, but I feel it's good to have the most current version; that's one of the great things about having a TV with a usb port, etc.", "Date": "February 22, 2009"}, {"Title": "Sony--the best!", "Author": "Chuck \"Colorado 2\"", "ReviewID": "RINQLTWYEHRCC", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Because this is our first flat panel tv, we did extensive research for months--at local stores and on-line.  We checked out specs and reviews for weeks, and came to the conclusion that nothing compares with Sony and Samsung.  Considering that we wanted 1080p resolution, 120 hz recovery, and a 10 bit processor, we narrowed the choices down to the Samsung Ln46a650, Samsung Ln46a750, and the Sony KDL46z4100.  We also devoted a great deal of time looking at these 3 units side by side in local stores.  The pictures and quality of all 3 are very close, but we chose the Sony because of the glare and bezel problems of the Samsung; we also had heard that the remote on the Sony was far better.The members of the sales staff at Amazon were great to deal with.  They answered all questions with expertise and assisted throughout the entire process.  Amazon's price is simply the best.  Because we live in a rural area in a Western state, we had to be patient with the delivery company.  Weather and other difficulties resulted in the set being delivered a week late; however, the 2 delivery men could not have been more courteous and helpful when they arrived.We have only had our Sony for a couple of weeks, but we are very impressed with the quality, features, ease of use, and technical support from Sony.  We watched several programs on a standard Dish Network receiver for 3 days, then had the high def equipment installed.  We do not currently have blue-ray, but the performance of the kdl46z100 with the 1080I Dish Network transmission has been excellent.  This set also permits as good a picture as is possible with non-hd programming.  The remote is superior--period.  It is by far the best designed and functional remote we have ever used. Beginners will love the ease of switching to different settings for several uses.  Those more electronically gifted can tweak the settings to their heart's desire.  I personally have enjoyed setting up 3 different custom settings with all sorts of refinements.  By adjusting the settings, DVD's on a standard DVD player can often-times look as good as HBO or Starz broadcasts offered by the dish companies. The included sound system is similar to most sets--rather weak in volume due to 10w speakers.  If you are able to hook up to an audio receiver, you are much better off.We have our set in a great room with sunlight pouring in from many large windows.  The matte finish on the screen is amazing, keeping glare from both natural and artificial light sources to a minimum.  Samsung owners tell me this is a huge problem with their sets.  We called Sony technical support to assist us with plugging in and using our digital camera to view pictures--they could not have been more courteous and helpful.  Viewing pictures on this tv is amazing--a most enjoyable experience.As indicated, we are very happy with our purchase from Amazon, and we look forward to many more years of Sony quality.", "Date": "December 19, 2008"}, {"Title": "THE BEST!!!

There was also a problem with color accuracy (-5% green and -15% red), which seemed not easy to correct by adjusting \"Saturation\" and \"Hue\".  The most disturbing thing was that when the TV was displaying some test patterns like half dark gray/half white screen, there was a visible area (about the size of a football) in the center that appeared slightly darker (like some dirt) than other areas of the screen.  This suggested ununiformity problems with the screen.  I'm still testing the TV by watching different disks and programs to see whether the ununiformity issue is tolerable.

The design with the small silver bezel is what really attracted me to the TV much nicer than the shiny black or even reddish colored bezels from Samsung (that is just my personal opinion).

I've also tried streaming video from a DLNA server and found it somewhat limited, While JPG images can display easily and you can play MP3s, (I got that working in just a few minutes), Sony doesn't guarantee support for anything other than basic mpeg2 video format (and I've had little luck even getting that to work). Since most internet video is distributed in other formats, this means you're going to have to get another device (HTPC, Bravia internet link, Roku box, Xbox, PS3, etc.), in order to get internet video. Depending on your plans for other home theater devices and budget, you may want to upgrade to the 5100 series or XBR for the additional internet based features, however if you're like me and getting a HTPC anyway, then it doesn't make sense to spend additional money for features you'll have through other devices.", "Date": "December 2, 2009"}, {"Title": "Great TV", "Author": "M.

I have more faith with the Sony brand than others, so I focused primarily on Sonys.  I began monitoring the prices on Amazon before Thanksgiving, and after visiting SonyStyle, Best Buy, Circuit City...I realized it was worthwhile to purchase on Amazon in regards to price.In regards to Amazon:At the time, TV was listed as $2,299.  Amazons price in the end was $1,446.  Without paying taxes on top of the savings, it saved close to $1,000.  I don't know who in their right mind wouldn't take advantage of Amazon's price.I was worried about the delivery method and if my TV would arrive in excellent condition.  Unfortunately there was minimal damange to the plastic frame in the back.  I called Amazon about the damange, and within 3 minutes on the phone, Amazon had placed an order for a replacement.  It was a simple process and a breath of fresh air compared to the majority of other customer service centers.  Although, the replacement TV had the exact same issue as the original TV delivered.  I recommend anyone that ordered this TV through Amazon to look on the left side panel where the extra HDMI Input is located and make sure there is no damange to the structure.In the end, I spoke with Amazon customer service and ordered a new TV, and they would pick up the original defective TV.  TV arrived today and old TV taken away, upon initial inspection, no visible damage.  Besides the structure damange, Amazon is still the place to go.  I am sure the same issues could have been experienced at any other vendor, as I believe it is just a defective problem with the TV's design. But personal experience with places like Best Buy, etc., returns are complicated and near impossible.I will always recommend Amazon for major purchases, like a TV.In regards to TV:Great features, great size, amazing picture.

After doing a lot of research and reading lots of reviews online (including watching Cnet videos) I decided on this TV.  Now you might be wondering exactly why I decided on this TV:1) Great size (46\" is perfect!  I'm glad I didn't go lower or higher because lower would have been a wee bit too small and my space wouldn't be able to handle larger)2) 1080P! (around black friday and christmas time I read lots of things that said 1080p wasn't worth it when 720p was getting so low priced, I'm glad I trusted the things that said 1080p rocks instead ^_^)3) 120HZ (I love action movies and knew that this was a must have feature for me)4) Good on-board sound (I considered getting a sound system but decided against it... it would require setup and tweaking time + take up space, luckily this TV has fantastic sound~)5) Good price range (ok, it's not the cheapest TV you can get at this size with the features I mentioned above.. but it had great reviews, people rarely had bad things to say about it, and I kept on finding myself back in front of it when I went to Fry's to view TVs)6) Easiest to view in person - I was always planning to buy it on Amazon but since a TV is such a bit investment I wanted to find one I could also view in person.  Luckily Fry's had the TV, Circuit City did (well, before they went bankrupt), and I even have a Sony store near me.7) It looks nice - I ended up with the black model when I was originally considering the silver/chrome one (it was the only one amazon had at the time I first started looking) - it's nice and sleek, I keep my room dark so I don't see bright spots on it, and it's really easy to forget the borders are even there.  My other choice had been the Samsung with the touch of red but I just couldn't stand that extra little feature - it was too distracting and sleek is much nicer.The only thing I would ever say was a downside to this TV are the CC.  Not necessarily because of how they are but just the fact that there is only one CC option - but it seems like multiple CC options might have gone away with CRTs, so no biggie.  The CCs are still very legible and are easy to forget about.One last word to the wise - regular def TV does not look great on this thing unless you tell it not to stretch it.  Even if you don't stretch it (do regular 4:3 ratio) it still doesn't look fantastic but I knew when I was buying it that getting channels in HD would be an important thing to do in the future.So really even though CC and regular def viewing are somewhat downsides this TV is so fantastic and it's so easy to forget about those two little things when watching something that I still think it deserves 5 stars.-For people wondering about delivery - it was great, got it setup with a time and date I wanted although I had to call the delivery service directly because otherwise they would have waited a day or two to call me : P  The guys who set it up were great and also setup the stand for me (I had no idea how I was going to do that on my own so I was very grateful) + they started the setup for me and made sure I could get a feed.", "Date": "March 4, 2009"}, {"Title": "Z Series is Awesome", "Author": "SEMPER FI \"MOM\"", "ReviewID": "R1688D1HXZTVVE", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I just received this Monday.

I was mostly comparing Sony & Samsung but also took a look at Toshiba. In fact, I had pretty much decided on Samsung and then had a change of mind. These brands all have some good quality sets.I chose this Sony because the previous (non-HD) Sony TV we had was still working great after 10 years with no problem and I felt more comfortable with their reliability ratings in Consumer Reports. Another reason, like others here on Amazon is the less reflective screen.  I had decided to go with a \"W\" series Sony with the 120hz motion enhancer but decided to upgrade to the \"Z\" series when a really hot price came out. When I purchased it, the Z was only $100 more than the W series TV and was $1000 below the list price, which turned out to be $500 less than the popular local big box department store. Plus free shipping, no sales tax and white glove delivery. The Z series has a couple of upgrades to enhance the picture and network other tech devices in your house (which I don't need right now, but you never know down the road).As far as delivery, no major problems. It took less than a week for delivery. I was pulling up to our driveway and the delivery truck had pulled up a few minutes before me. There was just one guy and I saw him drop the TV slightly as he was trying to lower it onto his cart, so I would recommend making sure you are there to help get it out of the truck and carry it in. Not a real heavy TV but a little bulky for one person.  But the TV was packed very well and had no damage.The driver helped put it on the TV stand and I hooked up cables to make sure we had a good picture and there weren't any initial problems while the driver waited for me to do so.When I thought I was having a problem at first with HD channels, I called Amazon to ask some questions on what to do (Sony wasn't much help but given my problem I can understand why, it wasn't an issue with the TV). Amazon was ready to replace the TV instantly if needed. I decided to troubleshoot some more and figured out my DirecTV receiver needed to be reprogrammed. But my point with this is Amazon was great on the phone and they were ready to back-up the product they sold.We are really happy with this choice.

I even went to Best Buy to compare picture from the different manufactures. Sony and Samsung defiantly stood out from the rest. I decided to get Sony because of the non-reflective screen, slim profile and my trust in the brand name. I went ahead and ordered the TV through Amazon as they had the best price. When I received the TV, I immediately noticed that picture significantly downgrades even when viewing from the small angle. Don't get me wrong, this TV produces some amazing quality picture, unfortunately you must be right in front of the TV to be able to enjoy it, even few degrees to the side extremely degrades the quality.  Blacks become gray and colors become faint.  I didn't notice this effect at the Best Buy because all of the TVs there are setup for \"Vivid\" colors, which improves viewing angles significantly. At home \"Vivid\" mode is too bright and impossible to watch. Cranking up Back Light would make viewing angles little better but will make it unwatchable in the center. This is no good setting that will fix this issue.Seriously, who would spend so much money on a TV that you can only enjoy if you sit right in the center? This is extremely disappointing for a Sony LCD TV to have such bad viewing angles. I thought that there is something wrong with my TV, so I went to the internet to research different forums. It turns out that many people have this exact issue with this model.  You can read it yourself on AVS FORUM. Many claim that a step down model KDL-46W4100 even has better viewing angles.  If not for this issue, the TV would be golden; everything else about it is excellent. Buy this TV if you don't have any friends or family or somehow your living room is setup where everyone would always sit right in the center (unlikely).I returned this TV and ordered Samsung LN46A650. The viewing angle issue doesn't exist in this model. The picture doesn't degrade at all when moving from side to side (amazing). I am really impressed with the black level and colors of that TV.  The styling is incredible. Samsung beats Sony in every way. Also the reflective screen on LN46A650, that I was afraid about, turned out to be a non issues for me.

I was concerned about cost because Sonys are typically at a higher price point than most available LCDs.  The Sony 46\"  KDL-46Z4100 actually fits in the space of a 40\" Samsung AND it's competitively priced (on Amazon, it's a steal).Picture quality and features (120hz, motion enhancement, PIP, range of wide-screen formats, etc.) are top-notch and with 4 HDMI inputs, I'll be able to use it for TV viewing, DVD, gaming and wi-fi internet access.  I wanted to get a silver one, but for some reason that version was a little more expensive than the black.  Still, I got a great TV for a great price with excellent HD quality.

We finally decided on the Sony and purchasing online through Amazon. We have only spent an hour or so with the new TV, but so far we are very impressed with it. There were a couple reasons we chose the Sony over the Samsung. One reason was consistent with all the reviews about glare on the Samsung. I noted the glare several times in different stores and happened to be able to observe the z4100 and a650 side by side at an hhgregg store. The two looked virtually the same except for one very noticeable difference. That difference was the glossy screen on the Samsung. I think the ideal tv would be one that produces images that cannot be discerned from real images. It was obvious on the Samsung that people looked too shiny and those same people looked more life like on the Sony. As a side note, the hhgregg we were at obviously did not have a looping video stream but instead had some movie playing on all the tvs on the wall. This movie was featuring two people rolling around in bed, which was causing one of the employees to be shouting for a channel change. It wasn't until the scene changed to full frontal nudity of a woman at the bedroom door that the channel actually got changed. Two full walls of tvs showing that was certainly interesting for a couple seconds. Back to topic, the other reason we chose the Sony was the cabinet. A Circuit City we were at had the a650 setup with a nice recliner about 10 feet away. When we sat in the recliner, the red touch of color border which also has a transparent rim was annoying. It seemed it would be distracting while watching tv, although one would probably get used to it. The z4100 has a much smaller frame, so small I thought it might seem cheap, but it doesn't in my opinion and does not detract from the image at all.One last thing... we were hesitant about buying a large tv online with regards to shipping (and waiting). However, as much as we looked, Amazon continuously had the lowest price and offered free shipping. The shipping worked out great. It came through a forwarder that was extremely helpful and I was able to pick the tv up from their facility 4 days after ordering and 3 days before the estimated delivery date. I was surprised when I saw their backroom and how many large tvs (ironically mostly Samsungs) that they had. I was told they would all be gone and delivered by the end of the day.

However after a few hours of watching it, the left half of the screen started to flicker. Soon after it got worse then it was nothing but colorful, vertical solid lines.After being passed around several times by Sony's customer service (none of whom speaks clear english), they finally told me to call a repair guy. I did, and took time off work to meet him. He told me that they needed to order a new 'panel' and that it will take one month for it to arrive. He also told me that the part may or may not fix the problem, and that the he will need my assistance installing it. At that point I said forget it, I am not taking off work again for something that may or may not work. Especially since this was a brand new TV, I expected a replacement TV. Again after over an hour of trying to get a hold of the right customer service rep, they told me I can return the TV, but Sony refused to ship out a replacement.Mind you, they do not package these TV's in a normal box, but a couple of layers of cardboard that needs to be binded (strapped) together. I did not have a binder or straps, so I used rolls of wire and duct tape from the garage.To make things worse, we got the sony credit card to get free interest. This was a mistake because it takes 30-90 days to process the return. So Sony has their TV back, but it is \"in process\" for a credit. We spoke with the sony credit card people and they said that we still have to make the payments if the return is not credited to our account. She said that once the return is credited then they will refund our money.As this is my first HD TV, I can only assume this process would be easier if I had bought from the store. You can return it to the store... right? Sure, you may save a few hundred dollars buying online... but trust me... don't take the risk. There is too much technology involved and there is a greater risk of something going wrong.

But, in my case, Amazon had my order filled by Vanns.  When I saw the Vanns reference while I was placing the order, I looked all over the Amazon site and did not find that ordering through another supplier meant another type of delivery or that I had any choice about who actually filled the order or what that would mean delivery-wise.  As it turns out, I did not get the white glove delivery.  Instead, I had to deal with FedEx Ground and their policies (no appointment--they will just tell you the day they are coming) and do all the other things that it looked like would be taken care of by the Amazon delivery company.  FedEx did bring the TV inside.  The Vanns customer service person told me that sometimes they ship by Yellow Freight.  I don't know how far Yellow Freight will take it from their truck (whether they leave it on the street and I have to take it the rest of the way?).", "Date": "October 31, 2008"}, {"Title": "Sony Bravia Z Series KDL-46Z4100/B 46 inch 1080p 120 Hz", "Author": "Nuz", "ReviewID": "R3VCSJORFXTGS0", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Jan 6, 2009 - The Sony LCD-TV and Amazon met ALL of our expectations and performance requirements.
