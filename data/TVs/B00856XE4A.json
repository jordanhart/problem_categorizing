It arrived well-packaged and protected. No dead pixels.The TV performs great. the picture is sharp and the colors are bright. it is of a good size for several people to view, though obviously, at 32\", this is not the world's largest screen. But it is sharp and stylish and for $200 (price i paid on Amazon) it is a great TV choice.", "Date": "December 10, 2012"}, {"Title": "Great tv", "Author": "K.

Mears", "ReviewID": "R2GK1MHTBUL7Q", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Bought this just after New Years for great price of $206.24. A day or 2 later, price dropped to $185.62  I took advantage of lower price guarantee and Amazon refunded me the difference. Price now is about $279.00  Got a great deal. I am a big fan of RCA tvs. Bought a 36\" big screen (big tube) back in 1990 and it lasted up to just a couple years ago when a mover damaged it while moving. Probably would still be working. Bought a flat screen 26\" RCA about 4 years ago and it is still working perfect. I understand this model is made by OM corp so hopefully it is just as well made. My only suggestion would be to make the clock work both 12 and 24 hr format. Only has 24 hr format. Also my RCA I bought 4 years ago had ability to label each input so you could easily tell what is connected to each input. Example HDMI 1-Directv, Composite 1- WII, etc. This model doesnt have that feature for input, but does have channel label. Channel label doesnt help if you dont use air or cable input since Directv is connected to HDMI. Very happy with very nice picture and sound. Easy to use on screen menus. Just wish menus would not disappear after a few seconds if no activity. Cant go wrong with this tv.", "Date": "January 16, 2013"}, {"Title": "All Good", "Author": "Falsesmall", "ReviewID": "R1C4LONMWZHHA8", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Bought this TV for my son's bedroom. Caught it on an Amazon sale for $185.00. Are you  kidding me?? Frankly this TV would get a 5 star review even at the \"regular\" amazon price of $279.99. The picture clarity is just about perfect with HDMI connection. Sound is good. I have a ProScan in another room which is manufactured by the same company. I was hoping this TV would match that one for quality. It seems to have surpassed it. The stand is solid and it is a good looking all black TV. It came with free shipping and arrived 3 days after I ordered it. Very pleased with this product, and Amazon, with their fine service.", "Date": "January 8, 2013"}, {"Title": "Great TV", "Author": "Ruth", "ReviewID": "RTMDHEILQ9F7", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I must say this is a great TV.

Installation became a problem when, while trying to screw in the coax cable, the coax connection fell off the tv into my hand. I don't appreciate paying close to $300 for parts to fall off. The side view above is not for the tv listed. There aren't that many connections on this tv (only 2 hdmi and 1 set or rca).

The first TV had a sound problem.  Voices intermittently sounded tinny and then this problem became more prevalent.  The remote for the second TV did not work right out of the box.  I have had the third TV for a little over two weeks and have had no problems at all.  I cannot blame the manufacturer for everything, as I think the delivery carrier could also be responsible.  TV was left upside down on porch : ((Good, sharp picture, easy to set-up and good sound.  I live in a very small house, 525 sq. ft. and sound quality is good for the space, both in living room and bedroom.
