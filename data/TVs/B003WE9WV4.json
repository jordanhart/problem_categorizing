{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Good bang for the Buck!", "Author": "R. Kadash \"Rich\"", "ReviewID": "RXUR8Q6VCSB7S", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I've had this TV about a month now and am generally pleased with its performance VS price. I purchased this TV to replace a 44\" 720P Rear Projection that was in my living room. This TV easily out performs that old TV. This TV is really very good when viewing HD sources. I matched a Visio Blu Ray player to use with this TV and there is amazing clarity. But, there is a noticable drop off when viewing non-HD sources like standard TV channels. Seriously, I don't think there are many 1080p sets that offer great standard definition viewing performance. Also, please note that there is an illuminated VISIO faceplate on the face of the TV that stays lit all the time. Now, using the TV in my living room this is not a problem for me, but if I had the TV in my bedroom it would drive me insane as it would probably illuminate half the bedroom! So far the only way I know to turn that light off is to unplug the tv from the power source. Please note that the remote for the VISIO TV was smaller than the remote for the VISIO Blu Ray player-that just seemed a bit odd to me. I also have difficulty menu-editing as when you are done editing they tell you to hit a button with a symbol on it that does not appear on the remote! Note sound output is pretty good-better than my 40\" Sony Bravia, but I also am using a 5.1 HDMI theater sound system with it so I can pump it up even to higher levels when needed. On one BD I even had to turn the sharpness down bacause the main actor had 5 o'clock shadow that was so clear it was making me dizzy.", "Date": "October 5, 2010"}, {"Title": "A Few Quirks, but the Quality Makes Up For It.", "Author": "Canis Majoris", "ReviewID": "R34CFEJHSKFSA4", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "So how about we get right down to it?There are a few things with this set that are a little annoying:- Sometimes, for no reason at all, the set will turn off and turn back on. The set will also turn off when going through the setup menu after pressing the 'Ok i.e. Select' button. The latter does not happen everytime, but it does it do it.- This kind of goes along with the above. Startup is kind of slow at about 10 seconds. Time between channel switching is about 3 seconds, which also feels a little slow.- The stand that came with this TV will not swivel to the right (when you are facing the TV), but will turn to the left.- Setup. Took about 30 minutes for this to fully search, and program all of the analog/digital channels in my area (about 120). This is not an issue if you have satellite or a cable box.- Sometimes when I am switching channels, the sound from the channel I eventually end up on distorts greatly and sometimes does not come on at all. To fix this, I have to switch channels and then back again.****As you can see there are a few problems with this TV, and although I still do not consider them a deal breaker --only if the price of the TV is such that it is much lower than its competitors, note what you might be getting should you purchase this set.However, because of the good price  and relatively moderate annoyances of the above dislikes, this is still a great set to buy.Here are the upsides:- Picture quality. It looks fantastic on HD channels, and when watching sports. This is a 120Hz TV to help with watching sports and/or video games. On this particular TV the latter setting is called \"Smooth Control\". I left the smooth motion on high when watching basketball and football names, which greatly reduced blurring so that it was not really noticeable at all. Moreover, there are three different settings to adjust the smooth control : Low, Medium, and High. I did not notice any difference between them. Yes you can adjust this setting to stay completely off, leaving your movies in their normal framerate (24fps) instead of the \"soap opera effect\", which looks like 30fps. The setting is located under Menu----TV----More.- Sound. Speakers on these TVs will never compare to aftermarket speaker systems, but I must say that the wait until you do purchase that system will not be terrible one. The audio, especially in surround sound, does very well at filling a room with a robust volume and with a variety of different sounds/instruments.- Automatic picture adjust. Automatically adjusts levels of brightness/backlight to accommodate ambient light.Comparing to TVs of all brands, this one is a must buy in the area of LCDs of the same picture size if it is 100-200$ less than its competitors.", "Date": "November 22, 2010"}, {"Title": "Amazing HDTV, but with a few very minor glitches", "Author": "Denny S. \"Denny\"", "ReviewID": "R24I4DQC7XB98T", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "As of late 2010, I don't think there's a better 47\" 120Hz HDTV anywhere for $679. (The comparable Samsung 46\" model cost between $120 to $220 more, depending on whether you purchase the Samsung LN46C630 or the Samsung LN46C600.)About the picture: I have carefully compared the Vizio E470VA picture to the two Samsung models above and can attest that the picture of the Vizio is almost equal while watching HD programming. When the Vizio is hooked up to DISH Network, HD programming such as ESPN and other HD cable channels is absolutely stunning. However, on NON-HD channels and shows, the picture is  hit-or-miss, based on the production value of the original program. Some NON-HD programs look clear,  but others look grainy. Either way, that's not Vizio's problem as I see it.Next, the SmoothMotion feature looks amazing on sports and on some movies and shows, but on other programs it makes the picture have that \"soap opera set\" quality. So, you may want to use the SmoothMotion feature on some programs but then turn it off for others, based on your own taste. (It's easy to switch on and off using the remote.) Some people may desire to  leave the feature turned off, which is fine too. I've read that LG and Samsung users often turn the comparable feature off. It's a matter of personal taste.About the sound: The SRS TrueSurround HD and SRS TruVolume features are great. Sometimes I felt like the surround sound was shaking the room it was so crisp and powerful. I was deeply impressed with the built-in speakers, and I see no reason to purchase an additional sound bar.  However, with the special sound settings turned on, the volume can unpredictably rise sharply  *depending on the recorded sound quality of the program being viewed.* So, much like the SmoothMotion feature mentioned earlier, you have to be prepared to turn the SRS TruVolume feature off if you get volume inconsistency while watching some shows or channels not created according to new HD standards. I keep the special sound features turned on most of the time, and I occasionally I have to turn off the SRS TruVolume when I get an inconsistent rise or fall in volume. I don't see this as a knock against Vizio, but perhaps the company can figure out how to control that better in the future.About a couple rare glitches: One glitch is that the remote \"menu/ok\" button (which you use often to adjust settings) will every now and again turn off the TV. I read that this has happened to another Vizio 47\" user, so I think it's a manufacturing glitch. It has not happened to me often, but I did have it happen a couple times when I was using the remote a lot. Oh, well. No TV is perfect.Another glitch I saw once or twice had to do with the sound getting out of sync with the speaker's lips. I do not know if this happened because of DISH Network's pause feature, but it may have been caused by the feed/connection coming from DISH. It has not happened in DISH's live viewing mode, so I'm wondering if it is a DVR-pause issue from my Dish hookup.  The issue tends to resolve itself within a minute, or I can change the channel and change it back and the issue is resolved.Finally, this E470VA is one of the  attractive looking Vizio models.  The casing design is sharp and sleek, unlike some of the \"ugly\" Vizio models, such as the similar E470VL.For $679, I just don't see a better 47\" out there. The price/quality ratio can't be beat by Samsung or LG.", "Date": "December 25, 2010"}, {"Title": "Excellent Picture and Sound", "Author": "EMTP EJ \"EJ\"", "ReviewID": "R1NUA4K3ANY768", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Assembly  and set up was a snap.We didn't have a good DVD or Blu-ray player, so we use the Xbox360 to play DVDs and it's excellent.The first movie I watched on it was 'How to Train Your Dragon' and it was incredible.

The research seemed like it would be a good tv I had seen it in person in target the picture was decent.  I was nervous about getting a vizio as it is well the low end product but everyone I talked to said vizio is a great brand to buy very reliable and good prices.  HA It ended up being the biggest mistake.First to start with amazons large shipping department is not like its reqular shipping.  This is done by frieght carrier.  I got a company called pilot.  They lost the tv had lousy service and it took over two weeks to get to me.  The people did a terrible setup job.  Good note is that amazon handled this fairly well and discounted me 67.00 for my troubles.  which made this a better deal.The tv looked good after I fiddled with the settings.  After the first day it shut off suddendly I thought I must have bumped the button.  But not so it would just shut off at random.  Three days it started loosing the sound in the middle of the show if I restarted the tv or hit the back button on my dvr it would fix the issue.  I tried changing cables and then one of the HDmI inputs failedBesides these issues the picture seemed decent the sound was decent it was a nice large size.  For the price it was about the quaility I would expect but having a tv that loses power and sound isn't so nice so I called amazon and they sent a replacement.  This time it was from a company called ceva who had excellent service, setup and the unit arrived promptly.I get it setup and on the second day I started having issues with random power loss and loss of sound.  I had it For me 700 bucks is a large expenditure. I wanted something nice and that works well.  I'm terminally ill and spend 90% of my time in bed watching tv.  So I really wanted something to make my life more enjoyable.  A faulty tv is not this something.I called amazon and did an exchange.  After alot of research I choose a Samsung LN46C650 for 840.00 with a free wireless lanstick adapter.  WOW this blows the vizio out of the water.  The image and colors are a huge improvement.  You get alot more features including internet tv.  The samsung is 46\" vs 47 on the vizio but you get so much more and the quality is 10x better.  Even is you have to pay $250-300 more it is worth it to get the samsung.Bottom line not reliable. Low price for low features and an ok picture if the unit works.  Save some extra money and get the samsung LN46C650 or LN46C630.  The vizio it is a decent picture where the samsung picture looks like you could walk right into it.  Maybe other vizios are okay but this model is not it has big problem I got two units with power and sound loss and serval other reviews note the same issue.  I won't buy a vizio every again.The only good thing I can say is amazon does have excellent customer service and they went out of there way to make sure I was a happy customer and to meet my needs.", "Date": "January 30, 2011"}, {"Title": "Vizio LCD", "Author": "Doug", "ReviewID": "R26TQHW31AY70T", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Great product.

We replaced a 47in rear projection HD TV with this unit and I can say as far a video quality go, this far exceeds the old unit. Even on non-HD video sources this TV is far superior. When watching HD sources the picture is fantastic. WE have a 1080 up-conversion DVD player hooked to it and it is great to watch all our old movies in new higher definition. The one area that I find lacking is in the sound. The sound from the built in speakers is awfully thin and tiny. We took care of that though by connecting a home theater system for sound. That combo, this Vizio E470VA hooked to a home theater system is just awesome.I am lowering the rating I gave this item because their customer service stinks. We had an issue with the remote control while still under warranty. I called Vizio and they had me walk through a whole series of steps to verify the remote was bad. Once verified -it was- I was given a number to reference for replacement. A month later, no replacement so I called again and gave them the reference number. They had no record of it. I told them the remote was bad... and guess what????? they wanted to go through a whole series of steps to verify.....we did..it's STILL bad. Another reference number, another two weeks, still no remote. I ended up buying one from wal-mart instead and am giving a less than glowing review.

The only issue I found with this tv is that it only has one component/composite connection.  This is only one combined connection so you can't run component and composite at the same time.  It's an issue for me since I don't have all new equipment and I still need a vcr to allow my kids to watch the good ole cartoons.  Luckily I had an old receiver I ran everything through and just ran one composite cable to run my dvd, vcr, wii, etc.  I have my satellite connected through 1 of the 4 HDMI ports.

It was on sale for $680 which made it a great deal. As far as the image quality and sound I would rate this TV pretty decent. There are some issues with it that you might want to be aware of before purchasing though.The first issue I noticed was IR interference. As soon as we replaced the old TV with this one, all of the remotes in the living room stopped working. For instance the Dish network remote works about 25% of the time. Sometimes its impossible to get the volume to go up or down without holding the remote just a couple feet from the box. This wasn't just a dish problem because the issue also prevented my WDTV remote from working. I have turned off the Ambient Light Sensor and this has resolved the interference. This could just be me, but why include a feature that someone is surely going to use if a direct result is that all other remotes no longer function.The second issue I noticed was the smooth motion feature. This could be a defect in the TV I got but the Smooth Motion Demo mode is supposed to display the screen split, allowing you to see what it looks like with smooth motion on vs smooth motion off... This doesn't even work on my TV. You turn the demo on, it does absolutely nothing. On top of that I notice a lot of stuttering and lag on my television. The two sources I tried were SD Dish Network programming (plugged in Coax), and HD and SD content from the WDTV box (plugged in HDMI).

It worked great for the first 4 days, but after that, the screen started flickering green whenever it switched between commercials and/or tv shows. It also occasionally shut off the video completely, but the audio would stay on. If we shut the tv off and turned it back on, the video would come back. Called Vizio and they had me reset the tv, then said to call back if it happened again. Worked great for 2 days, then started up again, but worse. Called back and the guy was very rude. He kept telling me it was the cable and to contact my cable company. I kept telling him that wasn't the case, that our other Vizio tv worked just fine with the same coaxial cable from the same outlet. He finally believed me and told me to submit proof of purchase and then they would issue a replacement. A few days later, they called me back and told me they don't have any more of the same tv in stock, but that they would upgrade me to a 46\" LED 3D HDTV with wireless & bluetooth. I looked on Amazon and it is a $400+ upgrade, for free!! I was happy with that and am now waiting for the delivery company to come install it next weekend. Hopefully this tv just had a flaw in it and that the new one works just as good as my smaller Vizio.Now as for the sound issues everyone else mentions, I have no idea, as I have had mine hooked up to surround sound since we bought it.", "Date": "March 24, 2012"}, {"Title": "Great tv!

So it was out of warranty by one week, and we only used the set for 2 months, the tech said it would cost $500 to fix, forget that. After that bitter pill I was determined to get the cheapest set (NON plasma) I could find at close to that size. Found this as a refurb at many places (first looked at Tiger Direct, with shipping it was over $640, I think) but the Amazon seller \"OnSale\" had it the cheapest at $545 with shipping included, I just looked since this was purchased 6 weeks ago and OnSale doesn't have any except new ones but that can always change or try ebayfor a refurb, since it's an older model I would be looking at buying a new one because the newer models should be the same $800-900 price listed here.Got it shipped by a freight company with no setup included. I also need to mention that I am not at home because I'm away working and so whenever I have to replace a TV it's something I will rarely or never use and I hate it. Anyway the Wife picked up on the sound thing the first week and I noticed it while chatting with her by Skype, the volume would come out of nowhere. So since it's only supposed to have a 3 month warranty (refurb) she called Vizio and arraigned for them to service it. They asked her to take 3 pictures of it while it was on, why? I guess there is a hidden bar code that shows up, who knows. I was thinking they were jerking us around with the pictures thing as a inside gag. Anyway I'm sure they are aware of the audio issue with this set beforehand and it would have been nice if they took care of it since it was refurbished but they didn't. My wife was very pleased with the Vizio service people and they sent a tech out (not sure if it was local tech or from Vizio, wife couldn't tell me), the tech replaced a major board on the set that improved the picture a little and fixed the sound so she is happy and I'm happy that I only had to pay $545 for a 47 inch LCD HDTV.Bottom line, I have no idea what the picture, features, or sound is like as I'm not watching it, but I'm sure it's decent and it was the cheapest I could find, my wife is picky and she's happy and she was used to a Samsung plasma and she says the Vizio is just as nice or maybe better. Now I just hope it holds up but my experience is the cheapest electronics I purchase last the longest in most cases so I'm not sweating it.", "Date": "August 7, 2011"}, {"Title": "Bang for the Buck", "Author": "Hendi", "ReviewID": "R30T057HGNZKOF", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "When you factor in price, quality, and performance, this unit is great.
