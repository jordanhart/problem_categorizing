I bought it a few years ago and it's has been a good tv with decent picture and audio. Since getting this tv, I have viewed many other LCD tv's and found that the picture on this is not bad compared to higher end tv's. There are some downfalls though. For one thing, if you are viewing the tv at more than a 30 degree angle, the picture becomes blurred and grainy. The color could also be better but for a relatively cheap tv, it's not bad. The one thing that really threw me off was the lack of any audio output. I recently bought a set of wireless headphones so I could listen to the tv at night without bothering others in my family who are trying to sleep. I was shocked and disappointed to find that there is absolutely no audio output. In my opinion, this is a major flaw in the tv. If it weren't for this, I wouldn't hesitate to buy a Proscan TV again.", "Date": "February 25, 2013"}, {"Title": "Great tv, Great price", "Author": "Kindle Customer", "ReviewID": "R3EQQIGUQVEYI9", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I chose this tv for the price and at the time free shipping.  So far it's very good quality, but I cannot program my DTV remote to completely interact with it.  It seems as though this particular product's model  number is not on their list.  So I am stuck using 2 remotes.  The Proscan remote for volume and power,  and the DTV remote to change channels.  Other than that it performs well and I like that it has 2 speakers for good sound quality.", "Date": "May 26, 2013"}, {"Title": "Got this tv 3 years ago, still holding strong", "Author": "Timothy Tharp", "ReviewID": "R262XKZ728QV8G", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "i didn't buy this from amazon, i actually bought it from best buy. i see all these review talking about it being broken and bad, well i have had mine going on three years now and it still works like a champ. i have a gaming monitor that has 2 ms response time, and when i play on this i don't notice any delay, so im assuming the response time on this is 2 ms as well. i use it every day for at least 6 hours, and it has lasted me this long. so for $276, this is a great deal for a great tv.", "Date": "November 26, 2013"}, {"Title": "Love it!", "Author": "Macy", "ReviewID": "R388Y8M3AR3JZ1", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "It does everything that I know how to get it to.

The picture quality is great, even on non-HD programs. The available adjustments menu is precise and allows complete customization. But the sound is lacking. It is hollow sounding.

This does the job well.  It is in my living room so gets used only when I have my annual family visit.  The color is good, as is sound.  It was easy to set up.

Last year I bought an Itouch that had to be replaced. At least that was obvious right away. This item just shut down for no apparent reason after 2.5 months , so now I have a $300 paperweight. If I had this  even closer to a year I'd understand.Try finding support for this POS; good luck.  If I bought this refurbished or second hand I'd get it. Both of these were brand new so I don't , unless Amazon buys refurbished  items and puts them out as new. From now on if I need an electronic item I'm going to Newegg. I've never had a problem there.", "Date": "September 28, 2013"}, {"Title": "So far, I like it.", "Author": "Hot Air", "ReviewID": "R1K8SMWQHI5P50", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Less than three months of use is much too soon to rate a TV, but I like it for now.

It was shipped to her in July 2013. She had someone set it up and it worked fine for 10 months and now no picture. She had the cable company send someone out to check on the problem and it is the TV not the cable. Since I had it shipped to her, the \"original receipt and warranty card\" went to her. She didn't hang on to any of the paperwork. I looked up how to claim a defective TV on the Proscan site and she would have to ship it back to the manufacturer at her cost. Meanwhile, all of the packaging was tossed out months ago.What a total hassle and not worth it. If you buy a TV at Costco, even if it is a fews YEARS old, not months, you can just bring it in and they will give you a store credit towards a new one. Never buying a TV from Amazon or Proscan.

Also the contrast is washed out. You can try to change some of the settings but you never get a true color/contrast rendering. Also BE AWARE: If you are using an HDMI connnection you CANNOT change the tint setting. It only allows this setting to be changed when you use the old low-resolution coaxial cable to connect to your cable box or dvd player. I highly DO NOT RECOMMEND this product.
