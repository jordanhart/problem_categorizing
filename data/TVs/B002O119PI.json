It actually sounds like there's a piece of plastic muffling the TV speakers, which is not just annoying, it's perplexing.  Why build an \"eco\" green TV that's just going to end up in a landfill with the rest of the trash?", "Date": "June 21, 2010"}, {"Title": "Should have waited", "Author": "Montrosian", "ReviewID": "R1GHW4G8EMX68V", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I bought this TV because it was the only model available in my price range in stock. Should have waited.As has been mentioned in other reviews, the sound is barely adequate, and that's if it's being viewed without any outside noise interference at all. An electric fan can drown it out.The picture is good. No complaints there. Reliability is terrible. Sometimes when the power is turned on no picture will appear. The unit needs to  be unplugged for several seconds, then retried. This sometimes works, sometimes doesn't. Sometimes the volume and mute function can be controlled by the remote; sometimes not. Sometimes adjusting the volume results in the TV turning itself off. The sales associate at Target confirmed that they have had numerous complaints and returns of this model, and suggested that I exchange it for a different brand.If the model I had purchased functioned at its best consistently, I would give it three stars. Due to reliability issues, one star seems appropriate.", "Date": "May 24, 2010"}, {"Title": "Not worth it", "Author": "Tia", "ReviewID": "R2MESBC9LV48US", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "The picture on this tv is great.  It is also light weight.  My issue is the volume.  Even with the TV on full blast it was barely audible! I called westinghouse and they said for me to buy a home theater sound system.  Uh, I just bought a brand new tv, should i not be able to HEAR IT without a sound system? It is packed up in the box and being returned today.If you already have a home theater sound system, then this tv might be fine for you; but if you don't have one, i would not recommend it as you won't be able to hear the tv!!", "Date": "January 14, 2010"}, {"Title": "Westinghouse TV failed after 21 months", "Author": "K. OLEARY", "ReviewID": "R1VLXJ97OFUQ3U", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I bought a Westinghouse SK-19H210S in February '08. It was an acceptable, modest cost HDTV until it suddenly stopped powering on 21 months after purchase (and very light use during those months). I can't speak with certainty about other models from Westinghouse, but heed my experience!New it was $330 plus tax. Now it is worthless.Though well out of its one-year warranty, I thought it worth asking if the company would address the problem (since who would ever pay a nickel for a TV that would die in less than two years). A Westinghouse customer service supervisor said they would only stand by their one-year warranty.I won't buy a Westinghouse TV again, and you shouldn't buy one in the first place. A tip: Many Visa and MasterCard bank issuers include a one-year warranty extension on products with warranties of three years or less. If your bank offers this benefit, save your itemized original receipt, your card statement, and your warranty terms so that you can make a claim through Visa or MasterCard.", "Date": "December 15, 2009"}, {"Title": "Don't Buy a Westinghouse TV", "Author": "Capester8", "ReviewID": "R33D8OKE6BNOEZ", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I bought a Westinghouse 19\" LCD flat-screen TV (SK-19H210S) from Best Buy a little over two years ago. I used it as a mostly second monitor for my desktop. It worked great ..... at first. Great picture (when the picture was directly from the cable input) and all was well until it mysteriously stopped working. I had only had it for a little under a year at the time and used it lightly - maybe 10 hours a week on average. I'm very busy and figured it must be a loose connection or something simple so I wasn't aggressive about getting it off the wall and looked at while it was still under warranty - Big Mistake! I'm now the not-so-proud owner of one dead Westinghouse TV. Whoever heard of a $300 TV that dies in less than a year of light use? I called tech support and they had no magic bullet for getting it to work, but they did offer to replace it with a 26\" TV if I would send the old one to them (at my expense) along with another $200. I don't think so. No sense throwing good money after bad.

It has great features like energy efficiency, it exceeds the energy star rating by 20%, you also have 2 HDMI inputs, a YpBpr input, and a video input. The picture quality is great as well and have been getting very good customer feed back on this unit. Westinghouse is also offering great support for the unit since you can email a technician directly if you have any questions or concerns about the TV or if you simply need to know how to perform certain function, it is all as simple as emailing [...].
