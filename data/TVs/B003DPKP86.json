{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Great for TV or Movies (do firmware update for video games)", "Author": "Jasper", "ReviewID": "RZCMTD9M3A7J9", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Multiple EDIT sections added, Philips fixed the lag issue in the latest firmware release.If you don't want to read the whole review: This TV is pretty good for movies and TV, but is unusable for video games. EDIT: The latest firmware update fixes the lag issue! Thank you Philips for listening.Postive features :The image looks very good. It is a 120Hz 1080P TV with anti-judder. It does an excellent job of anti-judder or \"digital natural motion\" as they call it. It produces good contrast (for an LCD) after calibration, and after some painful calibration color can look OK as well. There are 3 HDMI inputs, composite, component and S-video. There is coaxial audio out (more on this in a moment). I had some friends over and they all agree it looks great. EDIT: After using DNM for a while now I actually prefer it off, mostly because it makes film look like video. You may want to take this into consideration before buying a 120Hz over a cheaper 60Hz tvMissing \\ Lacking features:There is no vga input. There is no digital audio in - other than HDMI. There is no optical audio out. There is no full resolution 1:1 signal to display (image is always overscanned in 1080p). This means there is no way to get all 1080 pixels width on the screen and the image is cropped between 2.5% and 5%. Note that 1:1 is available when a non-HD or non-SD resolution is passed over HDMI. This issue is minor, only noted for completeness.There is only one user preset, and if you change any display setting after selecting a preconfigured preset (game, movie, sports), you overwrite your user preset, so you have to remember or write down your calibration settings. This too is a minor issue.There are limited user configuration options: you cannot set gamma, you cannot control the level of digital natural motion, you cannot turn off dynamic contrast, you cannot set HDMI black level. Most people won't understand those settings anyway. A TV calibration professional will have access to more calibration options using the maintenance mode where they can set white balance and cut-off levels.Negatives:Lag. Even with \"Game\" preset, or with 120 hz turned off and virtual surround turned off there is substantial lag. This makes it unusable for most video games. Philips is working on this, so I hope a future firmware update will resolve this issue. EDIT: Philips did resolve this and I am glad to report that the game mode and even slight modificiation of the game mode (to create a personal profile) has minimal lag. 120Hz has unavoidable video lag due to the fact that the TV has to \"see\" the frames before it can process the inbetween frames.Even though there is lag in 120Hz mode and in games (EDIT: after firmware update lag in game mode is negligable) you do not notice it on movies because the audio is re-synched, but this forces me to use the coax audio out to my older receiver ([Device -> TV -> Receiver] instead of [Device -> Receiver -> TV]). The alternative would be to use a receiver with lip sync functions. Philips tells me a receiver with HDMI 1.3 should sync correctly.If you have to use and older receiver, like me, then be aware Digital audio out is only Dolby Digital. A DTS bitstream passed to the TV seems to be decoded and ouput as stereo. Chances are that if you have a receiver that handles the new DTS formats then it will also do audio sync for you anyway.If there is a firmware update from Philips that addresses these issues I will come back and alter this review (looking forward to that).  EDIT: Thank you Philips for fixing this issue.Bottom Line:If you do not intend to play video games then I can recommend this TV. EDIT: Firmware update fixes the video lag. I can recommend this TV.", "Date": "September 28, 2010"}, {"Title": "With the right settings this TV is a great buy for the price!", "Author": "LLCoolJay", "ReviewID": "R2AEL8PAAQMHCF", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I bought this TV as a second choice when the Vizio I wanted was out of stock. As most reviewers have stated the picture quality on Blu-ray and my now  defunct HD-DVD movies are spectacular! It makes watching a movie a new experience as the high def and natural motion feature gives the movies an almost 3D realism and pop, very satisfied with that! View from angles produce slightly softer picture but overall still solid. I havent experienced any of the sound fluctuations that other reviewers have talked about so far but I have noticed that if you hookup a sound system through the component cables there is a noticeable lag between the sound and picture so it looks like your watching a Kungfu movie :(  I'm going to see if using a sound system through HDMI solves the problem (I'll update this review if I get any results).Now to the meat and potatoes: I see everyones been complaining about videogaming on this tv. I first had this problem myself but ONLY on my Xbox 360, PS3 games play magnificently on the TV with no lag or screen distortion. I have found that if you turnoff Natural Motion 120hz and use an HDMI hookup instead of Component the lag will no longer affect gameplay. (Dont put Game Mode on as it will switch 120hz back on without you knowing which will cause the distortion and lag again) I'm VERY HAPPY I found this out because Im a huge gamer and I almost took this tv back before I made this discovery.All in All, I am very satisfied with this TV and would recommend it to anyone especially for its affordability and the fact that it performs so well in spite of the cheaper pricetag. Just be sure to make a few adjustments to your setup in regards to your picture and sound as well as your gaming setup. Hope this helps anyone on the fence about this HDTV, now back to Call of Duty lol", "Date": "December 27, 2010"}, {"Title": "Buyer Beware - Only lasted 18 Months", "Author": "Chicadita", "ReviewID": "R4NCXOCKMCWJB", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I have this TV and the picture just went out.

Fortunately I registered the TV and called immediately.  We were given the option to get it fixed locally (parts and labor paid for by Philips) or get a replacement shipped to us.  We opted for the replacement (refurbished) and was told it would be delivered within a week or so.  After a week, we received a call that our model is not available and we were given the option of another model, which we agreed to.  The other model is slightly newer but has a slower refresh rate (60 vs 120).  Now it will be another 5-10 business days for this one to arrive.  I'm glad this TV died within the warranty, but who would expect a $550 TV to die in a year?  Poor quality in my mind.

Moreover, when the 120hz refresh rate is turned on, this particular t.v. produces ghosting and blur artifacts; especially during fast or even normal movement in video. Evidently, this t.v. doesn't have any image blur reduction technology. I suppose the 120hz refresh rate only reduces motion jitter. Furthermore, this t.v. doesn't have a VGA input!!!If you're buying this t.v. because of the 120hz refresh rate and/or you plan on playing video games on it, i don't recommend purchasing this T.V.

Picture quality is very good, and sound too.  I have basic and expanded Cable but not digital cable or box.  The TV is picking up about 40+ digital stations without having to pay for digital cable.  I can choose to watch most channels in basic or digital mode on another channel.  It is also picking up all the extra 50  or so digital music chancels and others that I could not get before.  Excellent.Amazon.com's handling of the sale , delivery was very pleasing and the free shipping is always a bonus!!I had tried to purchase the TV about 2 weeks prior but could not be there for it's delivery so waited.  The price had gone up by $30 by the time I could purchase it.  On the day of delivery an email came from Amazon showing the price to be again $30 less.  I called support and asked if they could refund the $30.  They did without any protest. I  Think I got the email because I had forgotten to take it out of my 'wish list'.  As you can imagine I was very happy to get it at the lower price.  The price had still been the best at Amazon, even with the increase than I could find at any other trusted website.My only complaint is that amazon has very skimpy information on products, the detail are minimal.  Thus I have to go to various other sites to get the full specifications on anything I buy at Amazon.  Whish they could remedy this as it takes too much time to find the nitty gritty information and you have to know what you are buying.JK", "Date": "November 4, 2010"}, {"Title": "40 inch tv", "Author": "Greg Lewis", "ReviewID": "RZWISJLNR0DM1", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This philips HD tv is the best tv I ever had.2 years in and no problems at all.PS3,cable,blueray surround all hookup and work flawlessly right out of the box.0 lag on games ,awesome HD picture and good loud sound if you use the tv speakers.glad to have it.", "Date": "March 29, 2013"}, {"Title": "philips 40\" TV that i bought from amazon warehouse", "Author": "shu-tech", "ReviewID": "RS751KL45OFWI", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "the product is fine it's just the way that it arrived that is not fine because the box was wide open and the parts were all missing like the power cord and the screws for me to hook it on to the stand but with that aside the tv is a great value i mean as much as i would like amazon to send me some compensation for their shipping issues i think over time i can let that go it still bugs me that the power cord was not there i mean what kind of crap is that but anyway the tv is fine on picture quality it's great for movies but gaming is not the best on this set you cannot play with the 120HZ on it will cause a serious jitter in the screen and lag between the controller response to the character on the screen well in most games anyway but yea that's about all i have to say about that i do have a video of me opening it but i don't feel like uploading it right now maybe later. just leave a comment if you want me to upload some videos of the tv and the unboxing and stuff", "Date": "May 15, 2011"}, {"Title": "awesome TV if you get a update", "Author": "malcom77", "ReviewID": "R35XTWVFSXFWEN", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "This tv is great. only problem i've ran into is when i have multiple electronics plugged in it can be annoying because it will automatically turn them on.

Some shows it complements, and others, not so much. the first peripheral i hooked up was my xbox 360 using the Component red blue and green, and i didn't get any sound. after checking, my component wires are faulty, so i reverted to standard RCA. Has a terrible lag in both sound and video. the video lag was so bad you couldn't pass a tutorial in any FPS. then i got an HDMI cable and tried that. on Video Games, the video Lag is improved, but is NOT gone, in fact, i haven't played a game on my xbox since i bought this TV. the audio out is in use as well, powering a few satellite speakers and sub i have, and with RCA input, you get a really bad noise distortion, to the point you can't make out what is being said. but this problem stopped with the use of the HDMI. also, it has been brought to my attention that Philips has a new Firmware update for the video game lag on this tv, and i will be trying that out tonight, fingers crossed. Also worth noting is that my PS3 doesn't seem to have any lag on video or games, through the HDMI.. which i found to be weird, but, whatever, at least the BR player doesn't lag, right? the menu isn't enough options for trying to fix these problems either, only have an on/off for 120 hz, and a few scaling adjustments, nothing concrete to alleviate the video game lag. all in all, i say 3 stars, because the TV is huge, love that, picture is really good, when you have the right hookup, and the tv sound is what i would consider mid to low quality. but for the price, it is what it is. if the firmware update doesn't solve my XBOX 360 problem, i will be returning this tv and finding one that doesn't lag.", "Date": "February 6, 2011"}, {"Title": "Buena imagen y buen precio", "Author": "julio corrales \"perrys\"", "ReviewID": "R2FTAY7CFVFZHZ", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Compre este producto en marzo 2011 muy buena imagen y un precio excelente menos de 500,  un poco deficiente el sonido como casi todos los LCD, lo unico malo es muy dificil de establer la calidad de la imagen, tendra que pasar un  buen rato tratando de lograrlo, pero cuando lo haga  tendra una excelente imagen,  no active los 120 hz, o tendra una imagen un poco rara como de novela americana, el control remoto muy basico, un poco lento el paso entre canales por lo demas buen televisor para una alcoba.", "Date": "March 31, 2011"}, {"Title": "Excelente imagen mal sonido", "Author": "Kent", "ReviewID": "R24PG8DYX44W32", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "El TV tiene una presentacion muy elegante y estetica, la imagen es de muy buena calidad pero la calidad de sonido no me gusta para nada , pero prefiero que sea debil en sonido que en imagen", "Date": "December 28, 2010"}, {"Title": "$120 shipping!? ----------------------------Shame on you Amazon!", "Author": "danbir1", "ReviewID": "R3GSY3CCYEI4BV", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I don't believe what Amazon allows itself to do, they send me an e mail, and when I go and look at it (and I am looking to buy a TV), I find a decent price, but, I also discover a $120 shipping charge!I am directing all future Amazon mail into my JUNK box.
