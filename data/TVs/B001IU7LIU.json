{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Nice looking TV but poor picture quality", "Author": "Kenneth Briggs", "ReviewID": "R8HHB2TDNA8KS", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "I needed this size TV to fit in my kitchen and this one fit the bill.  I like the TV, it's overall appearance and it seems to be solidly built.  I thought all LCD TV's would have at least similar picture quality, I guess I was wrong.  This one is fine if you are viewing from \"the right spot,\" but if you are too close, or to the side, it is horrible. Being in the kitchen I can live with it, but if returning it were not a hassle, that is what I would do.  To be fair, I am not able to hook it up with the HDMI cable; if i could do that, possibly the picture might be better, but I don't know.", "Date": "January 31, 2010"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "Unavailable", "Features": null, "Name": "15\" Element Electronics WideScreen 720P 1280x800 16:10 LCD TV FLX-1511B", "ImgURL": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/31oPsWZHhtL.jpg", "ProductID": "B001IU7LIU"}}
