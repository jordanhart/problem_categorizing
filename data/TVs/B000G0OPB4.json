{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Nice TV", "Author": "Frans Schalekamp", "ReviewID": "R1NVYYYCHRL5G5", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I use this TV as a computer monitor, using the VGA connection. The colors of the TV are stunning, especially when watching DVDs. The only downside is that the black color is not black enough when watching darker movies, even when I change the back light setting to dark (and ignoring the soft but persistent hum that the TV then generates).One note on setup, especially when you are using the TV as a monitor: Change the aspect ratio setting to \"no scale\" (in the swiss army knife menu). The TV normally stretches the picture a little to fit the screen better, causing blurry pixels. This setting doesn't do that, which makes the picture much better from closeby.", "Date": "December 16, 2006"}, {"Title": "Nice TV, if it worked.", "Author": "M. S. Kubota", "ReviewID": "R1FEZ2T0YL3331", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "Same problem as others who have this TV (from other reviews/ forums)- When you turn on the TV, you get an incredibly loud speaker-damaging buzz that won't go away unless you unplug the set.  The remote won't work until the TV has been on for about a minute.  Viewsonic will make you pay to ship to California... I've only had this set for 4 weeks!  Then it will take at least three weeks for them to decide whether to fix it or send you a replacement.  I think if I had to do it over again, I'd spend a few hundred extra and get something reliable or at least something that the manufacturer will stand behind.  Also, it seem like they have this same problem with TVs of the same series but different sizes.", "Date": "March 13, 2007"}, {"Title": "Television's electronics are messed up!", "Author": "Tom O.", "ReviewID": "R2VRCT7A7HDBA5", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "Every other time you turn on this TV the speakers buzz (extremely loudly!) and the on-screen display doesn't work. Sometimes the volume won't work. You have to turn this TV on and off to get it to work again. I set up an RMA online but ViewSonic never replied to my request. That was months ago. I also asked a ViewSonic rep who frequents my business to help - and she wouldn't. \"Contact our Tech Support,\" she said. I wish I could!
