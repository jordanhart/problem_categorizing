Dont get me wrong you get alot of tv for the price, but the only bad thing about this tv is the contrast ratio. Its only 1300:1 which is crap if you want a true hi def tv. On the other hand the sound quality is great. the internal speakers with the bass really make it like your in the movie. I have mine set up to a vizio 5.1 surround sound bar and couldnt be happier. I think this is a great starter tv for anyone looking for a deal. My xbox 360 games look great on it, but still the contrast ratio sucks.
