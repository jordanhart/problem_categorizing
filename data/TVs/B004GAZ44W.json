Instead of buying a computer screen, for the same price I got dual use out of this tv/computer monitor combo!! It was great having to option to either project from my computer using the hdmi or just watching tv. The picture is very crisp and bright and the sound was great too. I highly recommend this brand and this size is great for small offices or college dorms too!!", "Date": "January 3, 2011"}, {"Title": "Dynex 15\" LCD TV WoW!!!!!", "Author": "Live InFull", "ReviewID": "RTPFQRDXNAE41", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This TV met all of my expectations.

Bradley", "ReviewID": "R19A9WJ9EY4DAF", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "We've owned a Dynex 32\" LCD TV for 3 years and 1 month. It has begun turning itself off and on--basically power cycling. It will cost more to fix it than buy a new one. Note that Dynex is the house brand for Best Buy and that they do not stand behind their product. Basically, you need to view this as a short-lived disposable TV because that is how they are manufactured.", "Date": "January 1, 2011"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": null, "Features": null, "Name": null, "ImgURL": null, "ProductID": "B004GAZ44W"}}
