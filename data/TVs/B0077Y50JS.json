{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Impressive 3D HD TV in spite of poor Voice Control Features", "Author": "Chris from Michigan", "ReviewID": "R2GHSMDI54KJDE", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "As with any major purchase I did so much research before selecting the Samsung UN60ES7500 60-Inch 1080p 240 Hz 3D Slim LED HDTV.  I looked at all the major brands including LG, Sharp, Toshiba, Panasonic, and Sony.  I spent several weeks in my free time doing this, reading and comparing specifications, and checking customer reviews on sites like Amazon and Google Shopping.  Where available for each model I looked at I read CNET and Home Theater site reviews as well.Based on the available technologies I had to decide between Plasma and LED for starters, and then Active or Passive 3D. From my research online I discovered there were proponents in each camp, and finally I reached critical mass and realized without some hands on comparison I would never be able to decide.My older son and I went down to the local Best Buy and basically tried all the brands mentioned above and both active and passive 3D technologies.  The  Samsung UN60ES7500 immediately blew away the biggest myth I had read of with Active 3D and that's not having enough of a viewing angle when move away from the center of the screen.  In 2D and 3D TV we could see the picture fine when being on so much of angle where you wouldn't be able to see the front of the TV!The TV picture for both 2D and 3D is FABULOUS!  Totally blows away, as I would expect, my 5 year old 50\" Panasonic plasma, and my 2 year old LG 22\" LED TV.  I could not be more pleased!On the rare occasions I use the pass-through mode of my AV receiver, the sound quality if the TV speakers is decent;  certainly far better than the two aforementioned TVs.Of course while doing my research I came across complaints for this line of TVs from Samsung, such as you could not use a mouse or keyboard with it, but under mine int he setup mode are setting for a Bluetooth mouse and keyboard.  I'll have to try that on a later date and update this report.  I also read complaints of different color lines down the display, light bleeding around the edges, and other issues, but as I said previously the picture on this unit is amazing!More than a few of the reviews I had read mentioned the Samsung line my TV was a part of were turning themselves off for no reason.  I'm theorizing this might have been because they had automatic power setting set to do this, or perhaps the voice command feature misinterpreted some TV dialog as a command to turn off the set.  One reviewer mentioned when they removed theirs from the network this issue stopped, mine has been on my home network since the day it arrived, with no issues.  The wireless network setup was quick and easy in fact and I've had no network related issues on either of my home wireless networks, both of which use different security settings.Speaking of Voice Commands, this is one of Samsung's 'Smart TVs', meaning you can use a set of predefined commands and hand gestures to control it.It should be noted I did NOT buy the set for these features, which is good because they are, in my humble opinion, not ready for prime time.  Trying to get the TV to recognize, even with the TV muted, voice commands is a hit or miss proposition.  It either does not recognize the initial command phrase, or it can easily misinterpret commands.  How it thinks \"TV Power Off\"is the command for \"Current Time\" is beyond me.  The hand gesturing also needs work.  Trying to get the on screen menu to come up when holding using the waving gesture it expects, even after going through the setup calibration,  rarely works, but get a bit tired and raise your hands while stretching, and Bam!  it appears!Hopefully subsequent firmware upgrades will improve this, but if you main reason for getting a Smart TV is for these features, you will be sorely disappointed.The TV comes with a number of pre-loaded applications, such as a Netflix library and there is an application store you can choose more from.  There are both free and paid apps.  As the TV has a built in camera, there is also a Skype application.  This is also a decent web browser;  with a wireless keyboard and mouse this would be a very easy way to surf the web, check your email, etc.So, in closing, if you're looking for a TV based on being able to dump your remote and use hand gesturing and voice commands to control it, this is NOT the TV for you.  You'll be very disappointed in the poor implementation of these features based on today's firmware.If on the other hand you're looking for a large screen, network connected 3D HD TV with a fantastic picture, a boatload of applications, and a plethora of other features this is an ideal purchase.Because of the poor implementation of the Voice Command and Gesturing features, I'd give this TV four out of five stars.Updated 6/8/2012Now that I've had this TV for just over a month I thought a brief update was in order.  I've seen no issues that other people had reported such as the power going off, lines down the screen, dead pixels, etc.From a display standpoint for regular and 3D material this unit is fantastic and I am still blown away by the picture.  It responds well to action scenes for TV and Movies, and for video games as well from my Xbox 360 and Home Theater PC.As to the Smart TV functions such as voice control and gestures, they still really stink but can be downright amusing at times!  Try to get the gesture control to 'see' you and no luck.. Yawn or stretch a bit and there it is!  What I really find funny is dialog on the TV will often pop up the dialog for voice control and it will think I want to turn off the TV.But again, I must stress did not buy the TV for that functionality.If these features worked well it would certainly be a plus, but since they do not my original rating of 4 out of 5 stars stands.Updated - 11/12/2012It's been just over six months now and I figured I'd add a quick update.  With the Smart Features (Voice and hand gesturing) turned off the TV is perfect!  I've not had any trouble at all with this unit in six months and the picture remains fantastic.", "Date": "May 5, 2012"}, {"Title": "Backlight issues when all or one part of the screen is supposed to be black", "Author": "Daniel F Moore", "ReviewID": "R1LPB9IB0O28BN", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "Pros:+The picture is great but for reasons that are hard to explain, it takes some getting used to. I am switching from a old 1080i projection screen that had more of a movie feel, while watching a movie on this set seems more like super sharp TV.+The 3D picture looks great.+Was able to connect to laptop for view 3D enabled games via HDMI (note you need to adjust the picture settings to prevent edges from being cropped)+Netflix, VUDU, and Pandora apps work great... have not used Skype yet. Many of the other apps seem of questionable value.+You can connect a Samsung sound bar via HDMI and the TV will use it automatically if it is turned on, and the TV can control the volume on it. Note that you still needed to connect the optical audio cable, and doing this will consume one of the three HDMI ports...Cons:+Backlight issues when all or one part of the screen is supposed to be black but some areas are lighter than other areas of the screen. This \"hotspot\" issue can be mitigated by reducing the backlight setting (advanced picture settings) but it does not resolve the issue. I contacted Samsung support who acknowledged that this is a known issue with LED TVs ...  It is annoying given the price of this TV but it is normally not noticeable. I am considering returning the TV but have not decided yet.+It is difficult, but not impossible, to use the 3D glasses with normal eyeglasses+You cannot connect a USB keyboard+The touch pad remote control is an interesting concept, but I end up using the second, normal remote instead.+If you put tape over the camera, the remote control does not work. I am not really down with having a camera connected to the internet pointed at my bed. Although, some people may consider this an advantage...", "Date": "June 16, 2012"}, {"Title": "Great picture, very poor usability", "Author": "Matthew Enthoven", "ReviewID": "R20AOQAW16HRNQ", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "So, I returned my 60 inch TV after learning of some fatal design flaws...The first, and biggest, is that every time the SmartHub servers go down, the T.V. basically becomes inoperable. An error message that's something to the effect of \"ERROR_MSG_BIND\" pops up every 90 seconds on the dot. And it's not my network - it's that there was \"scheduled maintenance.\" You can't use any of the SmartHub apps during this time, but that's nothing compared to the error message that pops up even when you're just trying to watch normal TV or play X-Box.With that in mind, the SmartHub is very sluggish and generally unresponsive. The voice controls are extremely poor, and the T.V. often misses them. The motion controls require your room to be extremely well lit in order to be effective, and generally aren't great either.The most annoying thing is just the popups. It's as if Samsung just missed the purpose of watching T.V.When I'm watching T.V., I want to be completely immersed.I don't want a single pop up, ever.I don't want the T.V. to pop up with a huge voice icon because it thinks I said something. I don't want it to pop up with a hand-waving thing because I put my arm around my wife. I don't want it to pop up every 90 seconds telling me the SmartHub servers are down. I don't want to get updates every 25% when the T.V. decides that it's installing an update, with or without your permission. I just want to watch T.V.And there's no way to turn it off. No \"do not disturb\" option. No \"disable popups\" option. I was so shocked that I did the trifecta - I called, chatted, and emailed Samsung and got the same identical response from all of them.If you're someone who really cares about immersion, do not get this T.V.All of the professional reviews you see will focus on picture quality and what not, and if you're like me, you can't see the difference in any of them.What the reviews don't talk about is usability. This T.V. has the worst usability of them all.", "Date": "April 10, 2013"}, {"Title": "Great product with excellent 2D 3D HD Audio and Video", "Author": "Rishi", "ReviewID": "RX76IMI199JB0", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This is a great TV to my house, it has great 2D and 3D HD Audio and Video. it has almost all the new technology that you can think of, at this point in time. picture quality is unbeatable, i replace Sony bravio 32 inch tv to this 60 inch 3D LED TV, this is a drastic change, with smart TV option. can do Skype video calling sitting at my couch, take picture / video, voice control, motion control and interact with TV.  you need few days to explore and experience all the features and capabilities available in this TV. AllShare app is great feature to see pictures video or song from other devices sharing the same wireless network. though there is a downside of browsing experiences with this Smart TV capability, once you connect a wireless keyboard & mouse, you can just browse with this TV from your cough leisurely. since i bought this TV just in 2 months after they came to market, i had few apps like YuppTV which didn't support. but i was not worried as the 3D Blu-ray player that came with this TV (free), supported the YuppTV app and which also has the smart TV capability. watching such a big TV at home, you just feel like the program is just happening in your house. There is no words other than experiencing it. i would highly recommend this product.", "Date": "May 29, 2012"}, {"Title": "VERY Happy", "Author": "Billy J. Gardner \"audio engineer\"", "ReviewID": "RXQ6O24NGNRSU", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Okay, after a day , here are my thoughts. First I'll say that I'm not a video guy, but I am a professional re-recording mixer in NYC with 20 years of experience and am around high quality A/V every day. I decided to get the 60\" ES7500 and save a few hundred over the 8500 because I preferred the black border and swivel stand compared to what I'd be getting for the extra money. I'm extremely happy with my purchase and am blown away really. We updated from a 55\" Sony HD rear projection TV.  I made sure the set never got laid down flat, even when attaching the stand, because of potential yet temporary problems with the image quality.  All pixels are working, no banding that I can see, and very little clouding or flashlighting, which will supposedly improve even more over the next month.  It looks amazing.  I played around for over an hour before calibrating and got very worried about how my Apple TV was looking. Not video, which looked great, just the shadows of pictures and the menu. Shadows were kind of black specked instead of a nice gradient. This turned out to be because of the TV settings out of the box.  Once calibrated, the Apple TV is arguably my best looking Source.  Because of the supposed issue with Micro Dimming only working in Standard mode, I stuck with that when calibrating - Movie mode looked washed out.  If you're not sure what you're doing search the web for calibration settings for this TV or the ES8000.  Starting there and even just doing that will make a world of difference.  Even without calibration equipment though, you can easily buy the Disney WOW discs to help you tweak from there or start from scratch.  Here are a few specific thoughts though after calibration...-On my Apple TV input, blacks look BLACK but the DirecTV input got light and washed out when I set the HDMI Black Level to Normal, which is normally a preferred setting. On that one input, I actually put it back to Low though. The DirecTV input was terrible with it set to Normal.  I'm not sure why but have read that this can be the case with some set top boxes.-My Harmony remote, which I feel is a must-have, is set up with a Utility Activity to automatically activate the TV's SmartHub (for apps) without changing the input, while mapping the controls to the TV. If you try to switch to another Activity on the Harmony though without first turning off the SmartHub, the TV's input will not change.-Using Motion Plus can make images move too smooth for me and I hate that \"soap opera effect\", but with certain content, especially some panning in 24p film, having it off can be \"jumpy\", studder. Having Motion Plus on Custom, with a Bur of 10 and a Judder of 0, has been suggested by some but I felt it still wasn't perfect. It was creating a odd look once in a while that I can't explain. For me, setting Motion Plus to Clear was the ticket. I also tried all those variants with LED Motion Plus on and off, so to be more specific, Clear and Off was the ticket for me - a perfect middle ground.-Lastly, I was very worried about the viewing angle, especially on the 7500 compared to the 8000. For the normal Joe reading this, don't let it worry you. Can I see the difference off center? Of course. But none of my family notices at all. I'm really surprised how happy I am with the viewing angle after reading so much about it.", "Date": "September 5, 2012"}, {"Title": "Not bad, but spend the extra money and get the 8000 series", "Author": "J. Dufrene", "ReviewID": "R2OT1MG40WGNMG", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "Not a terrible tv, but far from perfect. First and foremost, light bleed is pretty bad. I tried to watch a dark movie with a lot of night scenes, and it was so bad that it was hard to make out faces in the areas of the screen where the light bleed was the worst.This new wave of \"Smart Tv\" technology absolutely annoys me. The first thing I did was turn all the \"smart\" features off, and get it set up as what it is....a tv. I don't know why people expect one device to take over all the tasks of rest of their home, but it's getting ridiculous, and has caused the tv manufacturers to focus on all this extra junk instead of focusing on the most important thing, which is picture quality. I honestly don't feel that picture quality for tv's has progressed at all over the past several years.Anyway, sorry for the rant. Overall, the picture quality for bright/colorful scenes is quite good, but the light bleed definitely kills it from getting a fourth star. The light bleed was so bad that I ended up returning this tv, and buying the UN60ES8000 which is a FAR better tv, in my opinion. At the time of this review the price difference between the two models is less than $300, which is well worth it. Spend the extra $300 and you will be much happier.Keep in mind that all of these Samsung tv's (even the uber expensive 9000 series model) are only edge lit LED. None of them are full array LED, so light bleed will always be an issue, but it seems the higher the model series, the better they keep it under control.Bottom line, unless you're getting this particular model for a crazy cheap deal, skip it and go with the 8000 series, or even better yet, spring for an *actual* full array LED set.", "Date": "November 16, 2012"}, {"Title": "GREEN LINE DOWN CENTER", "Author": "Chris", "ReviewID": "RNDDP3IW2HWQM", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I have had this tv 11 days now with an average of 8-10 hours of viewing per day.

But took the risk of trying it out. Everything went fine without any issues.The delivery was perfect. In fact, they delivered it 4 days earlier than expected. It was a white glove delivery as promised by the seller.The TV looks great. The Picture looks crisp and clear. I have a bright living room and this TV looked the same at all angles and sunlight, way better than I expected. The 3D was good, the only drawback being the glasses cannot be folded and we have to find a good location to store them safely. The TV was able to connect to my home network and the internet without any issues. With dual core, the speed is also good. I am yet to try netflix of any other streaming services still. I tried the wireless keyboard and mouse and they work great. It makes working with the apps more like our computer. It also helps a lot if we browse using the TV. One downside is with the way the textboxes are handled by the browser, where we get a virtual keyboard eventhough we have a wireless keyboard configured and takes up the space. This product misses the wireless bluetooth keyboard. At this price range, I expect the keyboard to be with the TV. All the samsung tv's from Costco contain the keyboard and when I verified with the customer service agent, he also mentioned that the keyboard will be coming with this TV. It was very dissappointing.I did not try the voice control or the motion control as I am not a too big fan of them. The smart touch remote is also not very useful as the touch pad is not as good as the laptop touchpad's.To summarize -Pros:1. Good picture quality2. Picture looks good from all angles even in a bright room3. Allowing a wireless keyboard and mouse is a great feauture for browsing4. Full blown browser5. Good selection of apps6. Apps and browsing are quite fastCons:1. Only 3 HDMI ports2. For this high end price, I expect a bluetooth keyboard to be with the TV3. The 3D glasses are not foldable and no pouch to store them carefully4. Smart touch remote's touch pad is not as good as I expected it to be", "Date": "May 14, 2013"}, {"Title": "Just not acceptable if you care about PQ", "Author": "Brandon", "ReviewID": "R1M6UWYYGR03JG", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I've had three (four if you include the 7100 I tried as well) of these TVs and they all exhibit bad screen uniformity problems and flash-lighting/clouding - (some worse than others - but all entirely unacceptable IMO). After realizing that this is just inherent to these sets (Samsung techs all but confirmed that) \\and that some people just apparently aren't bothered by it (I can't quite come to grips iwth this but it must be true and based on peoples viewing habits), I bought the new Samsung F8500 plasma and couldn't be happier. All the clarity, detail and brightness but with deep blacks and perfect screen uniformity and no clouding whatsoever. It's a massive improvement in PQ and well and worth the extra dough.If you get one of these sets, watch a movie at night in a darkened room and see if it's something you can deal with. I don't imagine any real cinephile who likes concert films or movies with any dark scenes finding this TV acceptable. Also the dual core processor with 2012's Smart Hub is very sluggish. This has been massively improved in the 2013 models.If you're going to spend this kind of money, IMO the TV should look great and a dark screen should be a dark screen, not some clouded mess. Viewing angle is pretty bad as well with off-axis viewing presenting totally washed out images. I could live with this but not the clouding.Some people suggest you have to be in a blacked out room to see this but I can see it plainly in the day with curtains drawn and plenty of ambient light. And don't' fool yourself, it doesn't get better over time or with calibration - it's a major flaw with the tech. The picture looks stunning iwth bright scenes, but awful in dark scenes.Another problem with this TV is that, while 3D generally looks amazing, it has problems resolving dark backgrounds and thus backgrounds in darker scenes while watching 3d produce massive amounts of crosstalk in these areas, making them hard to look at. The F8500 btw doesn't exhibit this at all while keeping all the 7500's 3d aweseomness.I'm actually a big fan of Samsung products (I have phones, TVs, appliances etc), but this TV, while impressive at first, just let me down in the end.

We made a huge mistake and now we are stuck with a $3000 TV that is failing more with each day. We purchased it from Best Buy who will not let us return it because 30 days past. This problem started a little over a month after purchasing. The TV begins to flicker non stop, static, rays of colors, and turns off and on non stop for 30 minutes.. until we unplug it for 20 minutes. This happens when we increase or decrease the volume after TV is on for at least an hour. This repeats and does not stop.When we contacted Best Buy they offered to send a tech over, we agreed, made the appointment for a Saturday... which resulted in a phone call on Friday, day before.. that they do not send techs to homes on weekends. This resulted in another 3 weeks delay while we tried to contact Samsung support. They too offered to send a tech over and we agreed. I took off a day of work only to a phone call stating that without PROOF of the issue we were having, they would not come and service us. So I wasted an entire day because we didnt have any proof ( since the problem we are having with the TV only occurs after an hour or so of the TV being on, and back then we didn't know this ) so now we finally got proof, and following week we were supposed to have the tech come out...guess what? They did not show up! Once again we are stuck with this TV. We are now waiting for Tuesday March 19th..AGAIN for a tech to come out. We are extremely disappointed in lack of support from Samsung.A product of this expense should not have such a bug. It is not worth it.

It is not perfect but its good qualities far exceed any minor flaws. The picture Is great and the 3d is exceptional, as good as a movie theatre. It is also upgradeable in the future with an optional evolution kid starting in 2013. In a HDTV it is all about picture-picture-picture.Now here are some flaws. The voice and motion functions have various flaws from time to time but unless you are disabled you really don't  need  them. If you think you are going to control the entire tv with voice/motion you are dreaming it is easier to push a button. But there will probably be software upgrades in the future to make it better. It does connect to the internet but in order to search you have to move the mouse arrow from letter to letter to spell the site address very slow and time consuming. There may be an optional keyboard but Samsung needs to come up with an actual mouse like feature to make the internet as fast as a computer. I have a wireless mouse and keyboard and I just plug a HDMI cable in the TV and use the TV as a monitor from my laptop and it works great. There are apps like Netflix which will stream movies etc directly from the internet on the TV. You may not be able to use your cable on the remote. An Ir blaster is provided but Comcast in my area does not allow their cable box to be controlled by Samsung's Ir blaster . So you still have to use Comcast's remote. If these things bother you then you really don't need a HDTV.The picture is the best picture I have seen on a HDTV from my cable source. The 2d to 3d works but you really need 3d programming. Comcast has some 3d programming on demand. I watched a program on Comcast in 3d in which it was exceptionally clear and in your face as good as a movie theatre. My wife jumped out of her seat. I had a friend come over to see it and all he could say was wow. I was very surprised to see this TV produce that quality of 3d and from local programming. I might also mention that the camera works fine.In conclusion best HDTV with 3d for the price.", "Date": "April 25, 2012"}, {"Title": "Amazing TV with great features  But.. - decide for yourself", "Author": "amazonbuyer12 \"buyer@amazon\"", "ReviewID": "R37EOP2LJ27HLN", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "First of all  I made good decision to buy it from a local store Fry's instead of Online.

I switched on the TV next day, it basically showed screen spliit into two : one half showed good picture , the other half  showed image blured with pink color. Packed the TV and  returned to Frys.

I can take it to Frys any time and don't have to  depend on the awful samsung support.I have been a Sony loyal fan for a long time.. and switched to Samsung recently for their cutting edge features.. but I may have to think twice now before buying samsung product.Also I noticed that I don;t have many apps that I used to have on my blu-ray player bought 2 years ago.

Spoke to Samsung and was told a tech will arrive on Monday only to be contacted and told that they didn't have a tech available for that day it was just a tentative schedule not actual.  No big deal I just want TV fixed and so they come down Tuesday and replace LCD screen and after some research I learned that this is actually quite common with this model.  TV looks great and tech leaves I start running through some test to ensure all is good and notice motion sensor is not responding and camera does not work.  I know that this is most likely caused by a cable being disconnected during LCD replacement or tech not plugging cable back in.  He informs me that he will not be able to return to fix TV because he is not in charge of schedule and I will be contacted for new appointment.

The picture quality is great between the two models. I honestly can't really tell the difference. People go on and on about how the black levels in the Panasonic model is better..but to be honest most people don't care or notice. Personally, I keep the brightness up high on my television and I don't like when things get too dark (even though it is meant to be like that sometimes).--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Thoughts on 3D-I generally do not like 3D on most TVs because, for some reason, I get headaches when using them for over an hour. I will say that I did not experience that using this TV, which is a plus. I still however get some eyestrain but it is not as bad as the 2010 model from Samsung.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Here is the main reason for this review.For those that watch international television this is great. I have in-laws who stay over my house for months, and they are from India. They love watching Indian television but hate using the laptop. This TV has a great selection of apps that allow for IPTV. Granted the quality is not fantastic (not tv problem, the country just doesn't have HD channels yet). Basically it is like netflix. We pay 10 dollars a month to get access to Indian television and instead of watching it just on the laptop, we can watch it on the TV. This is the selling point for me and am sure that others will agreeI do not know if the VT50 has these apps or not but when I am spending this kind of money for a television, I would like to get everything right the first time and not deal with returns. I know that my previous Samsung supported the app, hence why I upgraded to this one.----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Here is my biggest complaint-The TV has TERRIBLE VOICE CONTROL. If you have an accent....good luck. If you speak without an accent....GOOD LUCK. It is just terribly implemented and literally a waste of time. Just use the remote and forget about that feature-The TV has BAD Kinect like features where it can track your hand, which you can use to lower the volume without having to reach for the remote.....just reach for the remote. The concept is great on paper, but it is implemented poorly. The camera either won't pick up the hand or will pick up a hand even though nobody put their hands upDo yourself a favor and avoid using those features. They are great to play around with for a while, but get tedious and annoying quick.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Sound-GET SPEAKERS......simple as that.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Build Quality-Boy does this bad boy look nice. It is thin and sleek. It powers up really quick. The remote response is great and the remote is built well (not bulky or overcrowded). The TV itself is not made from all plastic and has some metal feeling to it. All and all this has a solid build quality to it.-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------BOTTOM LINE-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Would I recommend this? Yes I would. The price is high but if you are looking for a quality LED Television look no further. You really do not need the ES8000 or higher features because all the important ones are built into this model. Also the list of apps is massive, so if you watch a lot of international television then this is the model for you. All and All I am satisfied with this product.NOTES-If you have questions let me know and I will respond as soon as possible-I will update if I have any issues with the television", "Date": "December 4, 2012"}, {"Title": "Great picture quality terrible app experience", "Author": "A.

Second bad thing is the integrated browser is pretty much useless as is. Its not the browser but lack of a keyboard with mouse. The built in technology in this TV has the ability to fix both of these prooblems since it can do bluetooth pairing. As soon as they have a keyboard and mouse that will pair with it, that will fix the browsing experience. I also think samsung has some home audio devices in the works which will be bluetooth capable.

Maybe $2,500.00 - $3,000.00 is not a lot of money for some folks to spend on a television, but it is to me.  This is money I'll never get back, nor derive true enjoyment, nor value from due to the DEFECTIVE SAMSUNG product that I purchased.  After the one year warranty period SAMSUNG Television screens tend to show burn-in and ghosting with horizontal lines, along with very heavy distortion of picture on right side of screen.  This problem is systemic in all their LCD's and LED's.  Consumer's have complained all over the internet.  There are even numerous Youtube postings with the exact same problems as in my DEFECTIVE SAMSUNG model, as well as the same DEFECT in many other DEFECTIVE SAMUNG models.  This defect occurs upon start-up, and lasts for the first 15 minutes of trying to view a program. Then the picture gets progressively worse over time and continuously declines.I tried SAMSUNG's Executive Customer Relations Dept. and was told:  \"We will do nothing but refer you to a local Authorized Repair Shop.\"  They were downright blunt and rude to boot!  I feel robbed of $2,900.00!Furthermore, I was informed that the repair will consist of a diagnosis visit, and then another visit to install a replacement \"Panel\" that costs $1,300.00 for the part plus $279.00 to install, plus taxes......all told, another $1,719.16....at which point the technician basically stated, \"just buy another TV.\"SAMSUNG customer service also told me that their Televisions depreciate at a rate of 20% per year, and that they do not repair any of their products after 4 years!  Their own repair people told me to just buy a new set!!!If I save one family the heartache of losing they're hard-earned money on SYSTEMICALLY DEFECTIVE SAMSUNG TELEVISIONS, and a company that offers zero customer service....I'll be happy!

I then tried to change setting on the TV and followed recommendations on how to set but still I was not satisfied. I then went out and bought one of those expensive HD cables and hooked it up and wow.. big change! I then bought one for my Blu-ray dvd player too to get the same quality. I highly recommend you change or upgrade your HD cable.. don't have to get the most expensive but an average is better than what the cable company provided.I didn't buy the TV for the voice or motion technology but I have to say its crap. Maybe this model was the first version but voice does not work..especially if you hook up a cable box which most believe you have too if you want HD channels. The voice works on the TV itself so no box connected.. otherwise I can get the tv to turn on/off by saying the command.. hi tv power on.. The motion for the tv does not work at all.. when I yawn or stretch my arms out that when I see the mouse pointer on the screen..

The keyboard pairs with the tv in an instant and works the tv like a remote should.

I'm hoping a combination of upgrades to the firmware and replacements for the poorly constructed aps are in the makings.

It has been about 6 weeks, and I have to say that I am pleased with my purchase.  Pros - picture quality is excellent during bright scenes. This applies to movies, sports (except soccer), and the 3D. It is a nice bright picture, and the 3D is very good. Some think that 3D is a gimmick, but I believe if you see Prometheus or another good 3D movie, you will not go back to 2D.  I thought that the PQ is better on this TV compared to the Sharp Elite and the Sony 950. I played around with the latter 2 at Best Buy, and was not impressed with them to pay 7000 and 5200, respectively.  - The price of $2200 is a good price for this unit, I believe.  - The thin frame and bezel make this an attractive unit.  - no banding problems like I had with the ES8000 (see my review of that pile of junk).  - The only Smart feature I have used is the browser to look at Youtube videos. It was a pain to type without a keyboard (can be bought separately) - but it was cool to see videos and access the Web on a TV. Surely this is the future of TV, with apps, full and fast web access, etc. I believe the processing power needs to be improved, something that upcoming years should address.  Cons - The ugliness of the edge-lit technology definitely shows itself. There is noticeable 4 corner flashlighting on dark scenes and some clouding. I suspect that to some extent this is true for all edge-lit units. The blacks are going to be much better on the Sharp Elite and the Sony. You have to decide how much this is worth for you. In my opinion for the average TV viewer the Samasung is as good as the other two. For those who watch blu-rays and want a movie theater experience the edge lit deficiencies may be unbearable. The dark scenes in \"Pitch Black\" are not as pitch black as I would like. But remember the Sharp and the Sony cost multiples of this TV.  - For some reason soccer seems to bring out a problems that a TV is having. The players at times show motion blurring, and the grass appears to go in/out of focus. I am not sure if the more expensive brands have this problem.  Overall I think for the price it is an excellent option. The 7500 series is much more reliable (so far) according to my experience and AMZN reviewers.  I would not buy any of the other 2012 or 2013 Samsung Smart TVs. For the average viewer this TV is excellent for a bright nice picture and good 3D. Those with a ton of money and those who like dark movie-theater experiences may like the Sony and the Sharp Elite better. However you are paying for these local-dimming TVs through your nose. And again I felt that for average cable TV viewing the Samsung picture was as good, if not better. I would not consider plasmas because I like a bright high quality picture - and every plasma I have seen is intrinsically dimmer. I believe that light measurements show that plasma cannot output as bright a picture as an LED. The only people who like plasma are CNET editors who like a movie theater experience sitting in a dark room.  I did not want to spend more than 2200 becuase I think that in a few years 4K or another standard will supplant the current 1080p. Alternatives to look at are the Sharp Elite ($7000) or the Sony 950 (5200). But why pay this much when even Sony has announced a 65\" 4K TV for 7000 dollars? My plan is to hopefully use this TV for a few years, and then upgrade to 4K as 4K progamming becomes more common.  By the way always buy from Amazon, not 3rd party sellers or brick and mortar stores. My experience with Amazon has been excellent. If there is defective TV AMZN will bring a new TV and switch out the defective one. I have gone through this three times.

I'm a very loyal person to Samsung, so my search quickly revolved around which model and size I was going to get.

I got my TV within 3 days from ordering, and it was hand delivered to my house, unboxed, and tested out before the delivery person was finished. I also got a 2% Amazon reward offer, low price guarantee, and was in a bundle with a soundbar (which I am using on my bedroom LED due to my 7.1 surround system that is matched with the new Samsung). I'd suggest everyone purchase their new TV from Amazon.This TV has blown me away. Period. Picture quality is outstanding. The clarity is amazing. From my old DLP, it makes everything I watch seem like a whole new experience. I'm familiar with Smart Hub since I have a Samsung Blu-Ray player, so the familiarity is a nice touch.

They have been turned off since I purchased the TV. I did not buy the TV for such features. That being said, I love this TV. The screen quality is absolutely jaw dropping. I have watched a couple of 3D movies, which I was never a fan of, but they looked amazing and didn't make me dizzy like in the theatres. The TV was easy to set up. It is super thin and weighs under 50 pounds so wall mounting was a breeze. I'm a gamer and the xbox 360 looks amazing outputting in 1080p. The one problem I did have which is a Sony problem not a Samsung issue was with my PS3. I have really come to hate Sony because of little issues like this one I'm having. To cut cost, Sony took out a special chip in the PS3 slim. This chip I'm talking about made the system compatible with all manufacturers televisions. Now, without this so called chip, the PS3 will only work on Samsung TV's WITH a specific HDMI cable. Problem is, you have to actually do research on forums to find which HDMI cable works best. A pretty cheap fix as the cable that works best is a cheap one. Getting back to the TV being reviewed, I have read reviews about a lot of screen glare. I don't know what these customers are experiencing because I have quite a bit of lighting in my home and I haven't experienced annoying screen glare. I've even focused my attention on it and still couldn't notice screen glare. I do have my lighting on the TV set for Dynamic, which makes it a very bright and vivid picture which may help reduce screen glare. All in all, this TV is very well worth the price even when not considering all the bells and whistles such as motion control and voice activation.", "Date": "December 3, 2012"}, {"Title": "Super Picture Quality", "Author": "mbulld103", "ReviewID": "R2H11I61VFJH96", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I would recommend this TV to everyone.

No question.

Very 1982 in terms of trying to find settings that work, sound good, and enable control with a single remote2) Motion sensor is really sensitive to light - meaning that unless your room is lit beyond a comfortable level, the camera will not pick up your movement.Setting up the internet and app store were a piece of cake as well.

Simply, this picture is absolutely amazing. I had no idea what I was missing after having been watching TV on my Panasonic 50\" 1080P Plasma that I had for about 6 years. I thought I was getting the best picture I could with that tv.I still don't know what \"smart tv\" means. I bought two of these, different sizes, one has many more features (this one) than the other, and both are called smart. This TV has a feature where you can operate the tv using only voice or just your hands. I thought this was cool at first, but it's a really a gimmicky and annoying feature that you'll probably tire of quickly, and turn it off after a few weeks of having this hand pop up on the screen every now and then, without doing the gestures you are supposed to do to activate it. Instead of becoming active when you want it, it activates itself. Comical at first, but I quickly became annoyed with it.Further, with these voice and hand gestures, it's designed to work with a set-top cable box and the TV. I couldn't get it to work with the cable box (comcast). So really the only use it has is to turn the tv on or off or activate the menus.There's two remotes. One would suffice. All I needed around here was another extra remote! They could have combined the two into one really nice digital remote, but for some reason Samsung felt the need to have the two.One thing that sold me on this one is the fact that it's an outgoing model and as such I saved a lot of money over waiting for the newer model to come out. And, this tv has a slot in the back that will accept a module that will apparently increase the tv's functional memory and getting it up to speed to the newer sets. A nice feature, although I'm sure it will be on the spendy side when it comes out.As a promo, it came with a Samsung Tab 2 7\" tablet, which I hate.. It's a very functional tablet, well made and lots of features, but it's just too complicated and too difficult to find what you're looking for. I'm an apple fan, which is probably the problem. Further, can't get it to work properly with the IR receiver on the tv, and even though a selling point for this was to be able to completely control the tv and set top cable box with the tablet, it just doesn't work for me.  I'm curious if anyone else was able to get it to work properly.Overall though, I highly recommend this set.", "Date": "May 8, 2013"}, {"Title": "Smashing TV and smashing service", "Author": "Mark Celusniak", "ReviewID": "R1XOCLS5722E2J", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Amazon continues to amaze. First shipment was a smashed TV near the bottom, didn't realize it for a few days as I did not take it out of the box immediately due to cold temps (can't bench test a sub freezing tv apparently). But as I discovered it, logged into my account, used the \"call me\" feature, spoke with someone IN ENGLISH and in the U.S., and they helped to order a new one and have a swap delivery done. Quick, simple and courteous, and genuinely upset for me that I had the experience. New one arrived, in good shape, no issues to this day. TV itself is great...low glare, high quality picture, multiple connections, LAN port for web tv. One major down is Samsung for whatever reason DID NOT include a discrete audio out signal for internet applications and the two way HDMI port doesn't seem to feed audio back to the receiver to play sound through it. So I ended up having to get another iTV for Netflix and other web apps in order to listen to audio through the external speakers. The 3D glasses are cool but certainly not a necessity, though have to say it's neat to watch HD video reconverted through the monitor to 3D like...for example home video through the GoPro camera viewed in 3D enabled mode (with the glasses) does give an even more \"you're right there\" effect.By the way, purchased the Galaxy Tab with this thinking you could convert cable/DirectTV stream back through to the tablet so as to be able to watch paid for programming...but the AllShare software only allows you to control what you're watching on the monitor through the tablet...not for the tablet to be able to view what might otherwise be on the monitor. Upside of all share is whatever content is web enabled/shared with those devices is also able to be seen on any other device. For example, when I pull up my Dell PC, microsoft media player now magically has access to my full audio and video library that is set up on home sharing through the mac upstairs that I basically run as the server for the house for all media content.", "Date": "April 23, 2013"}, {"Title": "So far so good", "Author": "kenofpace", "ReviewID": "R9DAY2WOFBNDA", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Received and set up this tv over the weekend.

Will update this review in a couple of weeks. Voice prompts are ok. TV will turn on when I give the command. Have to use the smart remote for other commands, still playing with it though. If I have to pick up the smart remote to give a command, might as well just use the remote to do what I want to do.
