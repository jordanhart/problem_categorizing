{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Excellent so far", "Author": "Robert D. Cowart \"bcowart\"", "ReviewID": "R1OT5N0RE64QXG", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I purchased this set at Costco a couple of months ago, after reading numerous reviews of every popular 47\" set.  I almost purchased the competing Vizio instead, but  read that they are manufactured by the same company anyway. The JVC was a little less expensive. I believe I paid about $500 for it.At first I was disappointed by the image, which seemed over-saturated, almost like a 'posterized' filter in Photoshop. Turning the Color intensity down didn't do the trick. I was about to take it back to Costco when I discovered a web page that had the settings for best picture on it. Someone had done a professional calibration analysis and posted the settings. Thanks to some generous soul, I dialed them in, using the various menus on screen, and voila! The image went from a circus look to having fantastic skin tones, and tremendous realism. I hooked up the sound to my stereo system and amazing Mirage M-1 speakers, and wow. It sounds great and looks amazing. I don't remember the site url with the settings, but you can find it by Googling.I haven't used my video projector system since I got the JVC. Poor thing. Abandoned. The clarity of the JVC trumps the size (9 feet wide) of the projection setup (Sanyo Z2 projector), at least for a while. Half the time, at least, I'm watching Netflix and YouTube streaming over my iPad, plugged into the JVC set with a composite video in, and it still looks fantastic. Hardly HD, but still a great image, and the iPad makes an excellent hand-held controlller. Since the JVC is not a 'smart' TV, you have to use something with it that has smarts. I'm a stickler for accurate aspect ratio, and can't stand going into a restaurant where they have a wide screen displaying 4:3 material in 16:9 with people's heads stretched horizontally. This JVC has a button right on the remote called WIDE. You can quickly change the aspect ratio, with four different settings, without digging into menus. You can manually stretch the image vertically and horizontally via menus if you have a weird, nonconforming source, too. I have not needed to do so, however.My only complaint overall is that it switches channels too slowly to make channel surfing much fun. I prefer instant response to a channel change but, oh well, a small price to pay for a terrific TV. We'll see how long it lasts. Costco gives an extra year of warranty automatically, so that's some comfort there.", "Date": "September 22, 2012"}, {"Title": "Why so few reviews? THIS TV IS AWESOME!!!", "Author": "Mr Test Taker", "ReviewID": "R2FLQJNGXAHXGR", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Sorry Amazon but I bought mine at Costco for $499+tax. I was a little skeptical initially because I could find few reviews on the Internet when I found this model at Costco. Even CNET didn't review this product. Don't know why, but boy am I pleased to take a chance to buy this TV!I believe many of you are concerned about two things: (1) This TV's refresh rate is only 60Hz; and (2) This is an LCD TV, not either plasma or LED-lit. I can tell you with confidence that these things mean really nothing to your eyes! JVC's BlackCrystal technology is awesome. As an earlier reviewer mentioned, the factory default should be changed for better picture. Once it's done, you will be surprised how beautiful it looks! Watching Blu-ray movies is a jaw-dropping experience.HDTVs are no longer money cows for manufacturers, and JVC had to cease their domestic productions in Japan and Asia several years back. Too bad for them as well as for us consumers as their technologies are still topnotch even in today's standard, and they shouldn't go to the landfill for many decades to come! This is especially true for someone like myself who don't care about 3D just yet. Viewing angle is also great. I have no problem watching the screen from various angles. My JLC47BC3002 sits in my bright living room with roof windows and I can enjoy watching TV day and night with no problem.Two things that could've been better: (1) When the TV is turned on, a huge \"JVC\" logo appears as if it is a PC not a TV. A little annoying and this behavior seems unchangeable. (2) The TV comes with only two HDMI jacks. Right now, this is not an issue to me as I only connect a FiOS DVR, a Panasonic Blu-Ray player, and a PC (I use the SVGA port for PC). A PC makes the TV \"smart\" with accessibility to the Internet in a most flexible manner. Why would I need to spend extra $$$ only to get a limited list of apps?The TV supports HDMI v1.4 (of course!).Supports HDMI-CEC.[Input Jacks]HDMI ...............................2 (1 back 1 side)VGA (for PC)........................13.5mm audio input (for PC audio)....1Component (for 720p HD).............1Composite (for Analog)..............1Analog audio........................1Coax (for Analog)...................1USB.................................1Most (if not all) of the PC resolutions are supported. Mine is 1366x768 and it looks good enough. If you plan to connect your PC with only a VGA female port, please be sure to get a male/male SVGA cable that supports the highest resolution 1920x1080. I bought one (12-ft long) for $13.99 at a local store.Audio sound quality is very, very good indeed. Something you don't expect to come with an LCD TV of this price range.", "Date": "October 18, 2012"}, {"Title": "Brilliant vivid picture.", "Author": "R. A. McQuay", "ReviewID": "R2O0ZN1AQLOUAI", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "The plan was to buy a Samsung but Black Friday I saw the JVC for $399 so I took a punt. The color is vibrant, fairly accurate and did not need adjustment although I immediately turned off both types of noise reduction as they reduce picture quality. Contrast is much better than our 8 year old Hitachi RPHDTV; text is clear and easy to read and we noticed details in Rango that we missed the first time. Game mode on my Onkyo receiver did however produce intense motion blur on Xbox 360 games but turning it off fixed the problem and I noticed no video lag whatsoever. I have always been very sensitive to 60hz refresh rates on CRTs but I have no issue with 60hz on an LCD, I know there are people who worry about it as I did. There is some delay when changing channels, about 2.5 seconds which might bother me more if I was a channel surfer but 99% of my viewing is off the DVR. The JVC has HDMI v. 1.3 and supposedly supports CEC but my Onkyo is a v. 1.4 and CEC will not work. Not the latest and greatest television but I didn't need all the bells and whistles (internet, apps, 3D) and for what I paid it is a fantastic bargain.Subtracted one star for the channel change delay although it doesn't bother me much, it will bother some people.UPDATE: I tried the calibration settings from televisioninfo.com and they do look better on broadcast channels but look terrible on cable channels like Discovery, Food, etc. Overall the settings desaturate and yellow the image, whites come out almost sepia toned. I saved the settings under custom and will do a little tweaking to make it less yellow. CEC, the ability for one HDMI component to control another, does work somewhat. The TV remote will power down the Onkyo receiver but that is of minimal value. It was easy enough to program the Onkyo remote to control the JVC as the code was built in. My only complaint since the initial review is that the JVC remote has to be held at just the perfect angle or it doesn't work, maybe the included batteries are weak. The Onkyo remote works perfectly fine at any angle for controlling TV volume and on/off so it isn't a big deal. I'm still very happy with the purchase.Update Dec 2013: Been a little over a year and I'm still very happy with the purchase.", "Date": "November 30, 2012"}, {"Title": "Perfect TV for My Rec Room", "Author": "D.

What a bargain!A great 42\" TV is even greater at 47\". Here is my review for the 42\" version of this TV. Same comments apply to the 47\" I now own.JVC has long been a video superstar, even though their products don't sell as well as bigger brands such as Sony, LG, Samsung, and Sharp. Maybe they are weaker at marketing, because they sure can make great products at outstanding prices.It's in my basement rec room. I replaced a 36\" JVC CRT TV that finally went bad after 15 years. It weighed 120 pounds and was very deep. Pre-HD model.This 42\" TV (now the 47\") has a stunning picture, and tweakers will have lots to play with in the menu. It was very good right out of the box. I have not played with the picture settings, but I will in the future. Front-facing speakers have some of the best sound you can get. Just enjoying the heck out of it right now. Excellent for sports. Fits perfectly with my Harman Kardon AVR 75 high current receiver, Lite-On DVD Recorder, Wii, and AT&T; Uverse box. Adding a Sony Blu-Ray player for Christmas, replacing Lite-On DVD recorder.I wanted the best picture at the best price, with no extra bells and whistles that may be obsolete in 12 months.Not interested in 120 Hz. Not interested in 3D. Not interested in Smart TV features or WiFi. If I want to surf the web, I'll jack my laptop into the TV for the best possible experience.The base is very easy to set up. One connection and you are good to go. No tools needed.Pros:1) Outstanding picture2) Best in class sound3) Smooth motion/refresh - who needs 120 Hz?4) Lip-sync - 5 settings (all TVs should have this)5) Decent remote (mostly use the Uverse box remote, not the TV remote)6) Setup is a breeze7) The physical TV itself looks very impressive (some TVs look awful)8) No unwanted features (3D, 120 Hz, web apps)Cons:1) TV takes about 20 seconds to get from pushing the power button to displaying an input signal.2) Only 2 HDMI inputs. With a newer switching A/V Receiver, this is no issue. Only 1 HDMI is needed, as everything goes into the receiver, then one cable goes into the TV.", "Date": "December 10, 2012"}, {"Title": "Outstanding sound and great picture too", "Author": "Dick Oliver", "ReviewID": "RSRUNURBIKRHB", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Unless you are hooking your TV to a separate sound system, the quality of the sound is a HUGE part of the viewing experience. I bought this after comparing sound and video quality of many TVs in several stores. The ample soundboard is far superior to anything in this price range, with nice full-bodied, clear sound and excellent simulated surround effects with the built in 5.1 decoder. The picture is also top notch, with automatic adjusting for light levels (matters more than you might think), dark blacks and vibrant but realistic colors. Lots of connections too, 2 HDMI inputs plus component and composite in, PC VGA with its own 1/8\" sound input, and a headphone jack (though that is located in the back of the unit, a bit inconveniently). We have Fios and a Blue-ray with Netflix and no color adjustments were needed for the picture to look outstanding.Overall, if you find a decent price on this just buy it. There's nothing comparable near this price range when you factor in the outstanding audio.", "Date": "January 12, 2014"}, {"Title": "Exactly what I wanted", "Author": "DGlo", "ReviewID": "R21KYOEYU5E6EQ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I recently purchased a Vizio 46-in E-series television at Costco. As much as I wanted to like it, there were so many unacceptable issues that I had to return it. FWIW, Costco has a very generous return policy. After much research (and agonizing), I contacted some of the reviewers on this very board. With their comments at my disposal, I purchased the television listed here. I love it!The pros:1. Excellent picture. The Vizio always seemed washed-out and flat. The JVC is vibrant and alive in any mode.2. Matte screen for viewing in sunny room. My previous Toshiba Regza was always enjoyable to watch in a sunny room. I moved the Toshiba to the guest room. The Vizio, because of its polished surface, reflected sunlight very annoyingly. The JVC is a joy to watch in any light.3. Sound. I have the JVC connected to an old analog receiver and speakers, but it almost doesn't need it. The sound is surprisingly excellent for a flat-screen TV. The Toshiba was OK. The Vizio was metallic and thin.4. Screen Modes. No matter how hard I tried, I couldn't get the Vizio screen to match the color I had in mind, even in Custom Mode. In fact, there wasn't any mode that seemed satisfactory. The JVC is fine in Standard Mode, Game Mode (for my son's Xbox), etc. For the Custom Mode, I tried the settings recommended by a few posters here, but I wasn't quite happy so I adjusted them to my own satisfaction. Very good indeed.5. Frame around screen. This is a personal preference. The bezel is shiny and I like it because the TV is freestanding. If I had mounted the unit on the wall, I would probably have preferred a thin frame. But I'm very happy with the frame.The cons:1. Limited hookups. Only two HDMI hookups. That's all I need, but I'd be in a quandary if I needed more. There is only one component hookup, although I have both a DVD player and karaoke player. The answer was to buy a component splitter. It was cheap and it works fine. I also wanted to route the TV sound into an analog receiver. The only audio out is a mini-plug. I was able to buy a cheap miniplug-to-RCA red/white audio cable, although it caused me a bit of heartburn until I successfully connected it.All in all, I'm very pleased with this purchase.", "Date": "March 5, 2013"}, {"Title": "December 2012 online Walmart, delivered by Fed-Ex", "Author": "Ratchley", "ReviewID": "R2ZCNE2QG6N34I", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Just got the JVC 47\" from Wal-Mart site-to-home with FREE shipping, for four-forty-eight $$ (slightly more with taxes).  Wow, wow and wow even if its not the $399 Black Friday special. What a bargain folks!  Easy to install and setup, factory settings are just fine, and the speaker quality is very respectable.  Only minor irritation (I knew about this pre-purchase) is the single component input panel for older a-v components (red, white, yellow cables), so will just have to get off my bum whenever I want to switch between DVD player and Nintendo Wii.....guess if you want all the bells-and-whistles, you'll have to pay for them.", "Date": "December 21, 2012"}, {"Title": "Great TV", "Author": "Robert", "ReviewID": "RWRTXV6EMDY0P", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Just purchased this JVC 47\" from Amazon.com for $499 and it was a steal!

I tweaked the settings for a little while and the results are something else. It has a really beautiful picture. It is sharp, clear and better overall, in my opinion, than the others on the wall Walmart. Granted, those are probably not all adjusted properly. Even so, I doubt too many of them, would out do this tv's quality of picture. The audio is also very good. Now, only time will tell if it is as long lasting as JVC's older tube types, one of which I have had for 20 years now and is still going strong. I would definitely recommend this tv for its beautiful picture and apparent great value at only $499.00 at Walmart.One comment, I don't care much for the remote, seems to be weak.

Even now, it is still in $4xx range. I was looking for the 42inch model for a long time before BF day. But at that time, the 42inch is just $10 less the 47inch, why not get 5 inch more for just $10.Initial experience wasn't that good, as the big and \"ugly\" JVC logo displayed so long before the TV could be operated. And the menu fonts are so blur and unclear that I thought I got what I paid. However, it turns out the build-in fonts need a lot of optimization by the manufacture. As if I connect it with external signals e.g. the computer or TV box, the fonts are fantastic! Not sure why JVC or Vizio (they all made by Amtran) could not improve it and give it a decent menu as other big brands.After one month trial, overall, I love it. The color is fantastic, the backlight is very even and the picture is vivid. The menu setting is good either, as you can adjust the wide setting (normal, zoom...) extremely easily by remote compare with some of other brands.  And the contract is good to me either. And for the sound, I think most people will love it with XinemaSound 3D. If you don't want the TV to process audio too much, just turn it off. The speaker itself is good. The TV provides 3.5mm audio output and the output volume is in right range and strong enough for two ear buds. That is a plus! And if you prefer connect a PC, the VGA port supports the 1080p I think.For the motion programs, however, I saw some raw edges and the motion is not that smooth. Not sure if it is due to 60Hz itself, or due to the program source. Two functions not work well for me. The Ambient Light Sensor seems too strong to dim the TV even I set it to low. Have to turn it off. The adaptive backlight works not good either. You can observe a 1~2 seconds delay for it takes into effect. I have to turn it off either.Overall, I love it.
