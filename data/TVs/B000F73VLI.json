Tait", "ReviewID": "R21OK9KIE76MKU", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I too bought this TV from Target on Black Friday and have not had a problem.  For $180 you aren't going to get a Sony or Samsung-like picture.  I have noticed that the picture is slightly better than my old TV when I watch satellite but when I play DVDs the picture is really pretty good.  I wanted the TV mainly to save space in my bedroom and I didn't want to drop $400-500 on a similar size from one of the better electronics companies.  On the whole, I'm pretty satisfied.", "Date": "December 23, 2006"}, {"Title": "It's Okay", "Author": "Sarah", "ReviewID": "R5EI3715MWF7B", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I bought this TV on Black Friday at Target for $179. As far as flat screens go it is not the best. The picture is not that clear, but it is not the worst I've seen either. If you have really high expectations about the quality of picture I would get a better known brand of TV. However, if you are just looking for a flat screen at a good price it would suffice.", "Date": "December 4, 2006"}, {"Title": "Not Bad", "Author": "Amy Lynn", "ReviewID": "R15G9K2L8UEYYD", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I recieved this TV as a gift. I already own a Samsung large screen but I figured I could put this one in a kitchen or a smaller room. It definitely has a 'Unique' shape to it. As far as picture quality it dosent compare to the Samsung. I owned another 20 inch LCD that broke and that one had a better picture on it than this. The sound quality isnt bad. The more I looked at it the more I liked the shape of the TV. The TV is very light weight and the plastic material used isnt what Id call 'great quality'. Its sufficient, it works fine and its not bad looking but im sure you could find something better out there... but for the price its a decent deal and does the job.", "Date": "January 21, 2007"}, {"Title": "Monitor blacked out", "Author": "Tifepiphany", "ReviewID": "R10YC7UIPY903R", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I bought this less than a year, and the monitor is now pitch black.  There is sound but no picture!  Since it is past the 90 days, there is nothing target can do.  I knew the LCD monitor will no last, but didn;t think it would be less than a year!  Waste of money!!!!!!! Never buy Target brand again!", "Date": "March 24, 2008"}, {"Title": "Very good picture, light and never had problems", "Author": "S.

It has 1080p resolution which provides excellent picture quality. This enabled me to connect a HD receiver. If you want a sony you pay accordingly. This TV is very economically priced and works best. Its the best, if you are looking for a spare TV in either childrens room or in Kitchen.", "Date": "October 28, 2007"}, {"Title": "DONT WASTE YOUR MONEY", "Author": "Holiday Hugs", "ReviewID": "R7POM8MFBYMTA", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "Bought this from Target for $349. just AFTER the 90 days, it got pixel burn, red and blue dots over the screen. we followed all care to avoid this so dont know why it happened. also the remote only works if you hold it in a specific position and it is dark in the room, a real pain. Target will not accept since it is after the 90 days so i have had the \"pleasure\" of calling TruTech and being told it will prob cost $80 to return and repair. this TV is not worth even that, we are really disappointed.", "Date": "April 5, 2007"}, {"Title": "Horrible!  Should be 0 stars but it won't let me", "Author": "Colleen in NY", "ReviewID": "R1718L4MRGMHDK", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "We bought this TV on Black Friday at Target for $179.  Within one day the display was mostly lines, rarely had a picture.  It was totally unusable and we returned it the following week.  We were going to exchange but we checked on Target's site and found many reviews of similar problems for it also when my husband went to the store the response he got was \"oh, another one\" (and this was not the same store it was bought at, so not just a damaged shipment).  I feel sorry for those who bought it as a Christmas gift and will have some friend or family member disappointed because they can't return it and get a better brand without paying a lot more.  We knew it was a low price, but figured since the usual was so high that it was just to draw people in, not a unit that they had problems with that they just wanted to dump.", "Date": "December 10, 2006"}, {"Title": "JUNK!", "Author": "Disappointed Buyer", "ReviewID": "R3POEYPLWELDRR", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "We bought this item over the summer (more than 90 days ago).  Yesterday, for no reason, the TV died -- partial blue screen, partial white screen, non-responsive to any remote control signals or manual commands.
