I have owned it for two weeks now, and I would like to share my experiences.  First off, I cut the TruMotion stuff: not interested in that 'soap opera look.' No further comment on it.Color is a little off, but not too bad.  Maybe me just being overly picky/critical.  Delving into the 'advanced' menu quickly fixed it.  Black levels on this TV are phenomenal.  This is the closest to a plasma picture I have noted on a LED.  The only thing is the image processing.  Going from light to dark or vice versa will cause a 'jolt' in brightness as the screen attempts to catch up with the image.  It freaked me out at first, but, since then, I have reduced the screen's overall brightness, and I have not seen another instance (not to say that is what fixed the 'problem').I am not into 3D, but...I tried 2D to 3D conversion on 'The Dark Knight Rises'.  I was impressed, very impressed.  So much so, I went out and bought Jurassic Park 3D.  Much better 3D than the TDKR conversion.  It pops.  No bad artifacts or anything, just pure dino-in-yo-face action.  All that being said, I will probably never use the feature again.SD up-conversion was very good.  I was afraid my collection of DVDs would be choppy or pixelated, not the case.  All content looks great on the television.  (TV paired with a Panasonic BDT220)If you have any questions, I will do my best to answer them.  I am no videophile, but I am peculiar about the picture.In all, Sony has brought forth a great television with a lengthy list of features at a great price.", "Date": "April 12, 2014"}, {"Title": "Happy", "Author": "Joshua Kebschull", "ReviewID": "R1H5FQUDO5KSN7", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I purchased this from Best Buy for the same price (plus taxes), I was weary about buying an item of this size shipped to my house.I am not very tech savy when it comes to Home AV.  To put it into perspective, the last tv I bought was one of first LCD generations LG 32' (first XD system) for around $2300. Phenominal TV for the times, but it doesn't hold a candle to current tech.Fast forward, I finally got the itch for a new tv because I was getting the AmazonTV to replace using the horribly slow online content with my Samsung Blueray. I knew this was a Smart TV, and I originally wanted my money to go more towards the picture quality than features....until I saw this TV!Like the other reviewer, I was on the fence between this, Vizio M501d-A2R which was $200 cheaper, or a 60'' Sharp Aquos for $999 that was a clearance model 2013.I still had skepticism about Vizio long term, and the Sharp was possibly going to be too big for my single-bedroom apartment, but the biggest factor was screen quality, which the Sony trumps all!I considered LG and Samsung, but Samsung has left a bad taste in my mouth with the last two products I've owned from them, and their panel picture seems overly saturated, which is nice if that is what you like. LG has a more natural screen like Sony, but the models in the same specs just didn't measure up in picture quality not to mention if I wanted a LG with 4 HDMI, I would have had to spend a few hundred more to get it. The Sony is really that good!I am still toying with the settings (there is a lot of them) and have no experience with the 3D since I do not have a 3D source, but my understanding is that the components used to make the 3D panel is better quality than the 2D panels which improves the 2D quality as well. The blacks are very black, but accurately differentiate shadows. I cannot comment about the hertz rating with the 120,240, 480Hz stuff, but there is more than enough custom settings there to get the exact performance you are aiming. I believe some sources stated that the 2013 version of the 800 series were a bit of a letdown, and that those same sources state that the 2014 (this model) is significantly better, and dialed to compete with other brand's high models that cost $100s more, and I honestly believe it looking different brands/models side-by-side.Nearly every aspect of this TV is understated with the exception of the actual panel which pops with very vibrant and natural picture. The bezel is very thin so there is very little distraction. There is a small light that can be configured to your liking that will flash when there is remote activity or turned off. I turned it to low so that it isn't distracting while watching TV, but when it goes to screen saver mode (when my pandora times out after a few hours) I know the TV is still on.The remote was a bit of a letdown cosmetically. Even my 2003 LG LCD had a much nicer remote, but I plan on investing into one of Logitech's universals to simplify things anyways. However, it is easy to understand and navigate with so in the function department, it's all good. Everything is done on the screen anyways. It has 4 HDMIs which I had a requirement of 3+, but in the end I couldn't get the Audio Return HDMI to function properly sending the audio signal to my AV Receiver so I ended up resorting back to running everything into the receiver and having one HDMI going to the TV. The Good thing is that even with the pass-through, the banner will still recognize the device automatically.All-in-all, if picture quality trumpts all, and you want a 50\" from a company that  is a proven performer in the AV world. The biggest companies in the biz (Samsung, LG, Sony, Sharp, Vizio) all offer great product, and there are small differences between the brands. The only one that measured up spec-wise was the Vizio M501d-A2R which also had a really good picture and a $200 cheaper price tag, but the Sony wins out hands down with a bit better screen quality, less glare, and the peace of mind that it will most likely still be working 12yrs from now in a world of planned obsolescence and product engineering. I feel that Sony is a superior product in that respect and feels a little bit more \"future proof\" as future proof as a tech product can be these days.", "Date": "April 11, 2014"}, {"Title": "Breathtaking", "Author": "matt kramer", "ReviewID": "R1VZ121UDZVBT4", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I have owned several modern tvs: Panasonic plasmas, Samsung LEDs, sharp LEDs.

I was comparing it to a Samsung H6350 in the store and while they both seemed to have a good picture, this Sony won out due to the very nice and clean looking design (and it has a light on the front, I'm a sucker for LEDs).The picture settings took some tweaking right out of the box which is to be expected, TVs seem to come with the contrast and saturation up way to high, and I cannot stand the \"Soap Opera Effect\" so the motion smoothing had to be turned off.The sound sucks, but it's no worse than any other flat panel TV.Navigating the Smart TV menus is pretty fliud, no major lagging after button presses, except when hitting the Netflix button on the remote. It takes a minute for it to start up.I will update after I have had the TV for a while if my feeling for it change, but so far I think this is the best $1000 I've spent on a TV.UPDATE 5/19/14Wall mounting. This TV includes wall mounting hardware for mounting the TV flat against the wall, with the face ending up 4 3/4\" from the wall. It's very different from your standard TV mount as it uses the base stand and some small brackets which you attach to the wall and they clamp on to the stand which is not attached to the back of the TV. This method works well though and it feels pretty secure when mounted but the TV is light anyway. The downside to this mounting is that it does not tilt or swivel, and if you want to use a standard VESA compliant mount you will have to buy an adaptor because the mounting locations on the TV are not VESA compliant.Still loving the TV, I have yet to try a real HD source (Bluray) but everything else looks awesome.", "Date": "May 15, 2014"}, {"Title": "Love the contrast ratio", "Author": "MarkUS", "ReviewID": "R2DY0AHNNCSQCO", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I bought this TV, to replace/return the LG Electronics 55LB7200 55-Inch 1080p 3D Smart LED TV.

Watching Game of Thrones, with dungeon scenes is very good*Feature-pack; ie: USB formatted w/ exFAT can be read; screen-mirroring w/ my SGS5 works flawlesslyCons:*If you're mounting, do your research*Remote control is plain and pretty old-style*Came with a power-brick, 19.5V; probably why the TV is not heavy*Speaker on the TV is not acceptable (just like all flat-panel TV's out there)*No VGA, DVI, &/or DP (just nit-picking, since newer flat-panel's don't have this)*\"Amazon instant video is not yet available for this device\" -huh? At least Netflix, Youtube, and Hulu works*No freebie's, compared to LG who gives out 1-year free subscription to Netflix. Just thought I put it out there.This is the first time I've owned a Sony TV.

I\u2019m leery of glowing reviews that seem suspiciously like paid endorsements.  On Amazon in general i have seen some patently fake positive reviews that I am sure were planted...Anyhow, on to the review... this is a FANTASTIC tv.  I love it.  if you look at my review history, you will see I tried a couple of Samsungs.  Well, don\u2019t bother.  This tv has apps that actually work, is easy to set up, is beautiful to look at (it has a very minimalist screen edge), and most important the picture is beautiful. I made some minor adjustments, but out of the box it was almost perfect.Navigation is intuitive (trust me I know because I\u2019m a tech-idiot and I am also easily frustrated with poor user interfaces).I have not  had issues with poor quality of older content like some reviewers had.  In fact, I almost didn\u2019t buy this tv because of a complaint from another reviewer about that.  I tried a different tv instead and returned it.  Then, I went to a big box store and actually saw this tv in action.  Glad I changed my mind.Frankly, I did try a couple of other tvs and there simply is no comparison for the price. I bought a Vizio M series at Best Buy, got it home and was so disappointed!  Horrible upconversion and a super glossy screen..back it went. This tv has a less glossy screen.  I\u2019m not sure if it is matte, but it is not too reflective like the Vizio.Tried a Samsung 6000...UGH.  WORSE than my 2008 samsung!  That TV had the absolute worst black levels I have ever seen...Tried a Samsung 6350 had a fab picture, but horrible , buggy apps and horrible tech support, too.I have not tried the 3d on this tv, so I can\u2019t comment on that, but at the store where i went to preview it, it looked fine to me...I don\u2019t use the tv sound because I have a receiver.  I don\u2019t ever expect a tv to have decent sound anymore as it is a conspiracy to get you to buy a receiver haha!The only thing I don\u2019t like about this tv is the remote.

So far so good.The good news is that you can turn off the trumotion effect and have your movies and tv shows looking normal. However, I have trumotion on for sports in the 'sports' mode and baseball looks fantastic. The menus seem a little rough to navigate but nothing too bad. The speakers sound pretty darn good considering how flat this tv is.Which brings me to my next point...THIS TV LOOKS SEXY. It's the perfect amount of minimalism with the screen running almost to the edges. Simple bezel stand and the tv for the majority, is only an inch thick except down near the bottom. The reference photo on amazon definitely makes the tv look thicker than it is.For under $1000 I don't think you can go wrong.

I've read some of the reviews on here about color and how bad it is.  I say, those people need to go have their eyes checked!!!!  This TV is Amazing.  I was a bit skeptical at first.  I saw this on base (I'm in the AIr Force) and I had to get it. Electronic stores always have sufficient ambient lighting when viewing LED TVs.  I was skeptical about getting it home and watching it in the dark (how sometimes you get the LED backlit dark spots in the corners of the TV).  I took this one home and NO ISSUES WITH DARK SPOTS!!! The sound is \"okay\" at best.  I am going to pick up a Sony wireless sound system. It has numerous features.  Also, for all you fellow gamers out there, this TV will be getting Sony's Playstation Now.  An app that allows you to stream PS3, PS4, PS2, PS1, PS Vita, etc games straight to your TV.

The picture was the best in the store and for the price seemed a steal. As was explained to me the 3D aspect, even if you're not going to use that capability, leads to a sharper picture.The initial scheduled delivery didn't happen because the contracted delivery company never received itI had to contact Amazon to reschedule delivery so it arrived a week late. A minor hiccup, if frustrating at the time.The included TV stand, which seemed secure at the store, instead proved to be very unsteady. It uses two screw contact points reached through recessed points at the base of the television and uses an assembly that requires two more screws to put together and mount it to the stand. The television wobbles when secured to this stand. I contacted Sony and their representative's only suggestion was to hire someone to professionally install it. That's ridiculous for this simple assembly (four screws). I build furniture as a hobby, so the problem isn't that I don't know how to use a screwdriver. Either the stand, the assembly design, or the screw holes themselves are deficient. It shouldn't wobble from the vibration of someone walking by. Unsatisfied with the included stand I attempted mounting the television to a TV stand.The mounting hardware for securing this television to a TV stand or wall mount is not VESA compliant and only has two mounting points on the back and doesn't seem secure enough for the weight. There's an adapter for that, recommended by another Amazon reviewer which should be recommended for anyone considering this television.Edit/Add on May 15, 2014: In a reply to this review SONY asked me to contact their customer service by email. I did so twice. It has been over a week and I still have not received a response, not even an automated one. I received the mounting adapter I ordered from an independent supplier and will attempt to install the television this weekend. Customer service has been very disappointing. I am downgrading my original rating to 2 stars because of this. Three weeks since ordering and I still don't have a functioning television.Edit/Add on May 16, 2014: I have mounted the television using the Sony VESA Wall Mount Adapter for this model and it seems to be working fine. The picture is gorgeous, the sound is adequate without a soundbar, with a soundbar it's great. A compatible soundbar or sound system is worth getting. The television does not overheat like so many other televisions do, which I ascribe to the superior electronics. I've tested it with a Wii, Blue Ray Player, Netflix, and Amazon Prime (through the Wii player for now) and love the television, but I have hated this experience. The guts of this device are extremely well designed, but the exterior seems to have been designed by a committee more interested in saving $0.50 on the two standard mounting contact points that are missing than caring about their customers.If it weren't for the shoddy and non VESA mounting system that requires you to buy an adapter and additional hardware to mount it to and the nonexistent customer support I would rate this television as five stars. Even with the adapter I still do not have confidence that this television will remain mounted and not fall to the floor six months from now. I would never recommend this television to anyone who either wasn't an audiovisiual technicial themselves or who didn't want to spend $400 having it professionally installed and $40 more on the adapter and yet even more on something to mount it to. This has been a very disappointing and frustrating experience and if I had it to do over again and could have gotten this television back into the box and a response from SONY I'd have returned it and bought something else.", "Date": "May 4, 2014"}, {"Title": "Beware Off-Axis Viewing....", "Author": "LondonLover", "ReviewID": "R2AYTZWAXDJN2I", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I just purchased this TV for my elderly mother.

The Sony is good but there are a few flaws that prevent it from being awesome.  As another reviewer mentioned the colors are off.  When watching dimly lit scenes, things that are blue show up as purple.  In many scenes there is a noticeable blue tint to the picture.  And most unfortunate of all is the very poor picture quality on older movies or TV shows.  They look so bad that we can't even watch them.  I have several other flat panel TV's in my home and this one is the worst when it comes to color and viewability for low definition broadcasts.  I even have a bargain basement Sony up in the bedroom that we bought at Walmart that makes a better picture.To be fair there are some great features on this TV.  When watching DVD or blu ray movies the picture is so awesome that you wonder why it isn't on everything else.  HD signals from the cable box are pretty good but not as good as the discs.  Anything filmed prior to HD suffers a greatly on clarity and color.  What I can find is that this TV lacks a crucial contrast adjustment and a function that would allow you to select a warmer tone.  There are many adjustments available but not the most critical ones that would boost this picture to the next level and quite possibly fix these issues.Here are the pros as my family sees them:DVD and Blu Ray movies look fantasticThin bezel around the edge makes the TV look as if you're looking through a window3D pictures are great and full of color.  Sometimes can be a little fuzzy but overall really greatBlacks on this TV are unmatched by anything else we have seen.  They are deep and rich and true.The cons are:TV sound is terrible.
