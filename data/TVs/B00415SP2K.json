It also has a tuner so it picked up a few over the air digital channels.  We installed it in our RV and went camping the same weekend we received it.  The first evening in the campground, we put a DVD in it and the DVD refused to play it.  We tried another DVD, same issue.  The player was defective.  We contacted the factory and they promptly issued an RGA, but it cost me $60 to ship it back to them.  I am currently waiting for my replacement.  I will give the next one another chance to perform.  Unfortunately, we did not even get to play a movie to rate it's screen.", "Date": "November 18, 2010"}, {"Title": "Extremely Happy,", "Author": "soll", "ReviewID": "RBMAVABRRTMRL", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I have numerous LCD TVs but they are all larger than this one. I wanted a 15.6'' inch for ease of portability and the ability to take it on trips and to be used in different rooms as needed. Without getting technical, this unit seems to have a very sharp picture, great contrast and brightness, and a easy to use remote. The DVD player is high quality and for a DVD model the price is on believable. and with Removable Base Stand you put it on the wall I'm sure you will be glad you chose this TV...it's a rarity.", "Date": "October 6, 2010"}, {"Title": "great van tv", "Author": "K.

Picture and sound are good for a 15'' TV.I'm giving this 4 out of 5 stars because the OEM (Pyle) packaging and manual are awful.  Also, I'm not sure if the OEM package includes the 12v (cigarette) power cable or if the seller included this (per the description on Amazon) because it is not listed on the OEM package.  Both the manual and OEM package indicate the DVD is on the right side; however, the DVD is on the left and you have to reverse the directions for inserting the DVD.  The manual also says to use the Input button to set the TV to DVD, but you need to use the Source button and down/up buttons to change the source to DVD before you can insert a DVD.Overall, this is what I expected, but it took an hour to figure out how to load/watch a DVD.", "Date": "May 16, 2012"}, {"Title": "FANTASTIC!", "Author": "ladyblue", "ReviewID": "R2SSKGQGLD9Q6G", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I got this for my husband who is a truck driver.

The LCD is crystal clear in cable or free off air reception in  1080i HD. No need to have a converter box since it is already incorporated with this unit.

It was the only model that fit into our cabinets and had by far the best price.  We are delighted with this television after about a month of use.  With a small digital antenna, it picks up several great channels and plays DVD's very nicely.  The audio is just fine.  I recommend mounting it on an articulating arm, because the image is not good unless you are looking \"straight at\" the screen.", "Date": "May 20, 2013"}, {"Title": "12 volt tv", "Author": "Allan Nevols", "ReviewID": "R1GEEDS9ZF8BLL", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "works great on disks with good picture quality and sound.

Setting up should not be that difficult!!  This TV did not come with an antenna coax.  SO I have not even been able to use this TV to see if it works.  Even tried a DVD and was not successful.  Too bad I do not have a five-year-old grandchild OR a computer expert to get me up and going.  Very disappointed about this.  I now have the coax but need a degree in electronics to be able to use this TV.
