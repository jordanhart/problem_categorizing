I have been really pleased with it in every respect. The picture has real depth (thanks to plenty of pixels) and the sound quality is amazing (I have taken to playing CDs through the sound system from my Panasonic DVD burner).But it really scores on consumer friendliness. You can adjust picture attributes for each input individually; no more having to find a compromise between off-air and Tivo.You can adjust Zoom to the extent you wish and more..It is a great buy.", "Date": "November 13, 2005"}, {"Title": "Not for analog signals", "Author": "ZBatia \"cyber teacher\"", "ReviewID": "R1EF9N5XS75JP6", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I bought this TV for our kitchen because I wanted to see what is written on a screen, and don't see clearly our 42\" TV from faraway in a living room (open space with a kitchen). The new TV has a great set of features including an ability to change the size of the screen (wide, normal, and the ZOOM mode is really great). Similar TVs from Samsung and Sharp have terrible sound and are underpowered. This TV has 6 Watt amplifier, and I use it at 40%. Overall, I am satisfied with the TV even the quality of an image sent over the cable (Comcast) is terrible. You may ask why I am satisfied. If you look at it from 5-7' distance, the picture is quite good. I am planning to change the cable and to use the digital signals. The quality of signal will be much-much better. The TV has a very stable base, tints pretty well, and also can be tinted horizontally (I love it because depending where you are staying in the kitchen; you can always adjust the screen for better viewing). There are several video inputs that I did not explore, yet. The remote control is simple and efficient; also you can use the buttons on a top of TV.The 19\" size can be great for any bedroom, as well.I'll provide more details soon.OK, I have used the TV for about 5 months. To my surprise, the quality of the image has not improved when I connected it to the digital signal from my DVR with a Comcast digital cable.I went to the BestBuy to verify my assumptions. None of the LCD TVs of this size (except expensive Sony ~$1000) have better quality of image: all of them suffer from worse quality if to compare to the same size conventional TV. The only way to watch this kind of TVs and see no image problems is to sit at least 6-10' away from the TV. You may ask me: Would you buy this TV now? My answer is NO. For those who use LCD TV to watch the DVD movie, it is justified but for me it's not.I respect the Panasonic brand for many years. I don't think that Panasonic released a poor quality product; I'd rather blame the technology. Sony used more advanced technology, and therefore, the quality of image is consistently better.", "Date": "March 1, 2006"}, {"Title": "Defective - perhaps..", "Author": "Alex \"Alex\"", "ReviewID": "R3TX00IFEZF5YV", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I bought one of these televisions from 6th Avenue Electronics (which will NOT accept returns for LCD TVs or plasmas, so be careful when purchasing from there) for hi-def gaming on my XBox 360.
