Keep in mind, this is 5 stars because of quality vs. price.  You can find much better in Samsung and LG however, this is not a 2 grand tv.  The colors are good, sometimes on the warm side which I prefer, but the TV is solid.  Refresh rate is great and no ghosting when playing games on my PS3.  Light and sturdy built of quality materials.  Will buy again no doubt.", "Date": "December 2, 2013"}, {"Title": "great cheap and light tv", "Author": "Aaron \"aaronw_234\"", "ReviewID": "R3T2BVX003G7UZ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Worked right out of the box, good picture quality, super light weight.
