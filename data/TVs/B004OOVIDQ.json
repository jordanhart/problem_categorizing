I completely overlooked the 60hz refresh rate because I wanted so bad to get an LED TV and I thought I made a mistake by not getting at least a 120hz refresh rate for sports viewing. Well, I can honestly say with a straight face that I definitely did not make a mistake. No motion blur and I watch a lot of baseball and have been watching Wimbledon and neither the baseball or the tennis ball has any motion blur what so ever. I know the TV salespeople that push 120hz for sports fanatics will not be happy when I say that you do not need 120hz for sports viewing for this particular LED TV. I don't know about other 60hz LED TVS but this one does not have motion blur and you know how fast a baseball travels and tennis balls go pretty fast too. Now I read somewhere that anything 40 inches or smaller that you won't notice motion blur. That may be the reason why I am not noticing motion blur but it doesn't matter to me why I can watch quick moving sports on this TV without motion blur. I'm just thrilled that I didn't make a mistake and that viewing sports on this TV really is a great experience.

I have run every game I love on this TV and have not regretted one single second. My set arrived within 2 days of ordering and it's setup took all of 15 minutes.

Harward", "ReviewID": "R1FIFXQA8RGUGH", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I am pleasantly surprised by this LCD/LED TV. It has the fantastic and unexpected characteristic of not being in any way annoying or unpleasant.Let me explain.For some reason, nearly 100% of the flat panel televisions I've owned over the last 3 years have been in some way annoying or just a pain to use. The first was a Sharp 32\", and it was okay except for being slow at channel and input switching, which got on my nerves after a while. It also had a weird auto-dimming feature that you *could not shut off.* Dumb. The second, a Sharp 37\" was simply bigger, but shared most of the problems and annoyances, but I had already learned to deal with them. Finally, a huge upgrade to a Samsung 46\" ultra-flat wall mount LED-backlit panel that we thought would be perfect and the godsend of TV's--turns out, no, it's also annoying. The input switch dialog doesn't go away after selecting inputs, meaning that you *must* keep the samsung remote around so you can press the OK button. Also, the panel itself was slow! Impossible to use as a monitor since the mouse took about a second to catch up with your movements, and it had too high a lag for gaming (but was better in \"Game\" mode) Anyway, I digress...This TV has no annoyances I can find yet. Honestly, nothing is wrong with it. Every turn of the corner, every new feature, every time I go to use it I'm simply *delighted* at how nice it is to use and operate, as well as how great the picture is, and how there's literally zero delay or lag in the picture. Absolutely fantastic on all counts. My favorite part is how fast the menus and input switching are, and how intuitive they are to use. The input selector has clear large icons showing all inputs and which ones are connected, and goes away cleanly after selecting one without further interaction, meaning I can use my universal remote and stash the LG one! Beautiful. The gaming performance is also top notch, and it even works great as a monitor with clean clear text and good contrast (plus it saves picture settings per-input so you can set up your PC with lower sharpness and matched color!)I'm even impressed by the little technical things: for example, it has an Optical audio TOSLiNK output port--and it redirects the HDMI digital audio to it! This is fantastic since it allows me to use HDMI audio and still get the digital audio to my older receiver (which doesn't have HDMI support) while using the TV to switch sources. This actually saves me 3 digital audio cables and opens up 3 Toslink ports on my receiver--incredibly useful, and even the top-of-the-line Samsung behemoth would not do this.A couple other notes: don't be fooled by marketing gimmicks that are plentiful in this day and age. 3D? Don't bother. 120Hz? Doesn't make a bit of difference. \"Tru Motion\" or \"Motion Smoothing\"? It will make you sick, trust me. This TV has none of those, and good riddance. It's so nice to see a TV which is simply solidly built with a focus on the useful features.Overall this is just an impeccably designed TV with the right balance of features, picture quality, and most importantly, solid User Interaction design. I'm so impressed with this TV that If LG keeps this up then they'll never lose me as a customer. And at this cheap a price, this is honestly the best value TV on the market at this size and resolution. Don't hesitate.*UPDATE* 1/26/2012 - Well, I had my 37\" LG 3500 for about 4 months, and then it was unfortunately stolen (yep, break in and robbery, no kidding--always use your deadbolt). So I went for the same model, but in the 42\" size since I loved it so much. Needless to say I am still completely satisfied, the 42\" model is every bit as good as the 37, with no noticeable difference in refresh or game lag or picture quality. This seems to be a very good panel. Picture is superb at 42\" and it makes 1080p even more worth it, Blu-Rays and DVD's alike look great.One thing I noticed as I got the TV set up for the first time is all the normal stuff I do whenever I get a new TV--but I thought I'd document it. First, turn off the \"Power Save\" mode, it just dims the screen during dark parts and doesn't do it perfectly, so it does get annoying. The panel is very low-power to begin with due to the LED backlight, so there's not much to worry about. Fortunately easy to turn off. Second, anything with a techie-sounding marketing name in the menu? Yeah, shut it off. \"Real Cinema\": off. etc. I increased the backlight just slightly since my TV is in a fairly well-lit room, but you may not need to. Contrast, brightness, color, sharpness, all have wonderful defaults and don't need changing. TV looks great after those adjustments.Still very impressed, very happy, and glad for the upgrade even though the robbery was very unfortunate.", "Date": "September 26, 2011"}, {"Title": "Gaming glory", "Author": "Timothy Bennett \"Electronics dreamer t.j.\"", "ReviewID": "RKU4GHL23F05F", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I chose this tv because after a lot of research i knew i didn't want a 120hz tv because i hate the way it makes the picture look.  Like a soap opera.  Good movies feel like you're watching the movie being made instead of a cinematic experience.  So i knew i wanted a 60hz tv because 120 is a joke and marketing scam.  Read any avs forum.So what makes a good picture.  The response time.  That is the amount of time it takes a black to turn to a white.  The largest color change in the spectrum.  The longer this process takes, the more blur.  Blur is B A D.  Plasma's have such a good picture quality because the response time is .001ms.  Most LED tv's are 8 to 5 ms.  This tv is 4ms.  This is also very crucial for gaming because it can actually make your eyes hurt after a while and the blur will also make you think you saw something that you didn't actually see.  4ms is very fast for a 60hz tv and especially on a bigger tv.  Some computer gaming monitors reach down to 1 or 2 ms but most 5ms. I've gone with the gaming monitors before and only brands like Samsung and Lg do a good job of making a good picture.One last thing about the picture.  This tv does have some edge bleeding.  It's not that bad but it's there. I've seen a lot worse.  In fact it is minimal on this tv so i was happy.  You only notice it when the screen is black though.As for looks.  My friends comment on how thin it is everytime.All in all i am very happy with the picture quality, the looks of the tv itself and one thing that i forgot to mention is that this tv does an awesome job at reducing glare.

The picture on this LG set is even better. My expectations were not high as I thought for the price of this being so reasonable for an LED set there would be something I didn't like but boy is the picture on this set sweet. I have a high end Sony LED set and the picture on the LG LED set is just as nice.It has a fairly thin bezel and its foot print is not too much larger than the 37\" Samsung I bought a year and a half ago. The styling is very clean and looks nice although the bezel is on the shiny side but thats the case with most sets these days. The menus are very easy to navigate. As for the sound its pretty good given the constraints of the thinness of the panel. I think the Cinema sound mode sounds best.I did need to fiddle for about 20 minutes with the picture settings to get things right but once done this picture really pops (the out of the box settings are not great). While this is a 60Hz set I don't notice any motion blur watching sports (motion blur really is not an issue with the modern quality displays anyway) so not going with 120Hz set will save you a few dollars.

Very close to SAMSUNG (I still think SAMSUNG has the best TV on the market right now), but this TV is much better than SONY in regarding to picture and sound. This LG has a feature call PICTURE WIZARD, which will walk you step by step to show you how to calibrate your picture, I thought that was very nice.  You can be able to view it at a different angels without worry about the clarity of the picture. The price on Amazon is very good, beside they will match price if you see somewhere has lower price.

Set up was a breeze. Display controls are limited and remote is a little cheap. This model directly challenges the Samsung UN40C5000.

Hillman", "ReviewID": "R3GGDD3XDTB0RR", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I bought this TV for my bedroom, so I was looking for a 42\" TV for wall mounting.  I could not go larger than 42\" for the wall location, and I didn't want to go smaller.  I did not want a Vizio TV from Costco, because the models they had contained features I did not need, and they were not very good looking.  I could care less about 3D and built-in Wi-Fi, and I learned that 120Hz refresh rates ruined the look of most broadcasts and movies (soft \"soap opera\" look with 120Hz).  After reading reviews here, I also learned that the LG TVs smaller than 55\" don't have the ability to turn off the 120Hz feature.  So the LG 42LV3500 was perfect for my needs.  The LED backlighting provides \"instant-on\" viewing without any warm-up times with conventional LCD TVs.  The TV is also thinner and lighter than conventional LCD TVs.  The thinness is also its downfall.  With a TV that is only about 1 inch thick, there is no room for quality speakers.  You can only do so much with 1 inch depth.  The stereo speakers are at the bottom of the set, which is slightly thicker than the rest of the TV, to accommodate the speakers.  However, they are still very small speakers that distort quite easily, even with vocal dialog.  Since it is a TV for the bedroom, I wasn't expecting movie theater quality, but the built-in speakers should at least handle vocal dialog without distortion.  Thankfully, I have a two-channel digital receiver with speakers directly below the TV, so now all audio goes through the receiver, and the built-in speakers are turned off.  So it is highly recommended to use an external audio source with this TV.  I would imagine that every LED TV that is 1 inch thick has lousy built-in speakers.  They are all limited by design.  The other downside to this TV is that the power cord is hard-wired to the TV, which can make wall mounting difficult.  It is far easier to route the power cable through the wall without requiring the TV to be on the wall.  That is not an option with this TV.  I was able to get the job done, but it just took longer.  Now the TV cannot be removed from the wall unless I also pull the power cord out of the wall to do so.  That was a bad design choice by LG.  Would have been far easier to have the power cord plug into the back of the TV.  The picture quality is superb for anything you throw at it.  Broadcast 1080i, 720p, and 480p images look excellent, and 1080p Blu-Ray looks amazing as always.  I love the look of the TV too, just a simple no-frills black border.  The 3 HDMIs meet my needs with my TiVo HD, Blu-Ray, and AppleTV2.  I even have a VHS deck plugged into the standard AV in, through the receiver.  You can use the side HDMI and still hide the HDMI cable so it is not visible.  If you need more than three HDMIs, you should consider a stereo receiver with HDMI to handle the video switching.  Since this is a bedroom TV, I can get by with the built-in HDMIs.  I use a Logitech Harmony remote to control all the components.  The LG remote is quite nice for a TV without all the fancy features.  The best part is that I got this TV in \"Like New\" condition from the Amazon Warehouse for $476 (The new price at the time was $529).  It was a customer returned item.  It still had the factory packaging on the TV.  So for the amazing deal that I got on this TV, it is a fantastic TV.

While I like the natural color quality in the regular LCD, my wife liked the crispness of LED-LCD picture and also the thickness of the LED LCD TV was way smaller than the regular LCD TV. While personally I liked the regular LCD better (you get a more natural TV like color feel), my wife liked the LED-LCD (you get a more Computer Monitor like feel). Another thing to note, LG 42LV3500 I received has a matte finish (but don't expect the matte level of computer monitors, there is still some glossiness on LG 42LV3500, but it sure seems like a Matte finish screen. It could even be an IPS panel but I don't know that for sure). LG 42LK450 I received has a glossy finish. Some people might like glossy monitors as opposed to matte and possibly because of the same reason I felt the regular LCD had more natural looking colors.I used the following 1080p video on Youtube to test the TV picture quality and sound quality as well. I got this link when I googled for 1080p songs. This is a song apparently from Indian cinema with A.R. Rehman's music with bright colors in the song. Make sure you change the 360p on the right bottom of the video to 1080p HD before playing the video. Just search for \"ROBO HD VIDEO SONG Endhiran Bluray 1080p x264 DTS 5 1 Raj1402\" in youtube and click on the first link.[...]I used the bluerigger HDMI cable running from my computer to the TV. You can see how this song and it's bright colors fill the screen, it is simply stunning on the TV.Sound qualityIf you want to avoid going through manual audio quality set up, just choose Cinema sound mode (You don't need need to necessarily choose Cinema picture along with Cinema sound, you can choose Cinema sound quality and leave the default/off picture mode) and the cinema mode sound is pretty loud enough for me.Refresh quality [60hz]:Honestly I am yet to notice what people seemed to talk about a lot. I think choosing a HDTV can be a hit or miss depending on the model. So just because a model has 120hz doesn't mean you are gaining something. You might end up losing on the picture quality if that model turns out bad. Same with looking for a SMART wifi TV and taking a gamble on possibly losing out picture quality. I can tell you from my own experience, both LG 42LV3500 and LG 42LK450 have stunning picture quality.If you are going to be watching sports all the time, this may or may not be the right model for you, but I can't really speak for it because i don't watch much sports and i haven't notice any difference on fast moving movie scenes. If you keep looking for a difference, you may notice something that might not even be closely related to the 60hz refresh rate but you might think, \"oh, this might not happen if it was 120hz\". Bottom line, if you are very particular about it, go to Best buy or your friend's place with some fast moving sports video and request them to check your video out on both 60 & 120hz TVs and see if you notice any difference and whether that difference makes any difference to you.Now coming to the POSSIBLE TV return/exchange hassle (I could have just been the unforunate one but Amazon has ensured SO FAR I never felt that way - but I plan to update this review if they don't continue giving me the same comfort feeling with this TV buying experience episode)My first LG 42LK450 arrived with a gaping hole on the center of the box [I guess it happened during shipping]. I REFUSED the delivery. So no real hassle there for me. Courier person offered that I open and find out if there any damage. If I had done that I suppose it would equal to accepting the shipment and then I would have gone through the return process. Anyways, I simply refused the courier person's offer and delivery.

Pictures are very crisp and clear without any blurring problem with watching the NCAA tournament games all week. The sound is very adequate for watching TV despite other people's complaint about it. This TV has a refresh rate of either 2.4 or 4 msec so it is pretty fast. You really do not need the 120 Hz speed. Watching HDTV programs or Bluray movies with this TV is pretty amazing in terms of picture. However, I like 1080p plasma picture a little better. I have an LG bluray player and this TV communicate with it automatically, which is cool. I also have it hooked up to an LG bookshelf speaker system via the TV optical output and it works great. As for people who complain that it does not have an RCA analog audio output to connect to outside speakers, you should be able to connect a computer speaker set with or without subwoofer via its headphone output. It also comes with an adapter cable to convert the 3mm computer audio input or headphone output to RCA analog audio connections. I assume that people want to be able to connect better speakers to watch movies or sports on TV so they do not have to turn on their receivers every time. I just happen to put my TV in the kitchen where we watch TV the most so I do not have room for a bulky receiver and a surround speaker set. As far as providing sharp pictures, this TV delivers big time. The screen is somewhat glossy but it is not as glossy as the Samsung's unit. I prefer the glossy screen because it gives clear pictures with more vibrant colors IMO. I noticed that when I watch a standard definition program, I can see some blurring effect so I think the cause is not the TV but rather the programming source itself.", "Date": "March 18, 2012"}, {"Title": "Best TV ever!!", "Author": "Will.White78", "ReviewID": "R2Y02XJX78HYUS", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I have had this TV for almost 3 months now.

It was on pretty much all day for all these years and served me well. But the monitor finally gave out a few months ago. After some research I replaced it with the LG 37\" LED-LCD flat screen TV, a size that just fits in my TV cabinet. Comp[ared to the Phillips this TV is one quarter the weight and and equally slim, so it was very easy to handle. The biggest problem I had was attaching the stand, which on my own took more than an hour; it was a cumbersome process for two parts. The TV comes with a sophisticated built-in set of adjustments so you can get the picture that is best suited to the room and lighting. It also has a feature where the image adjusts itself as lighting conditions change. All of this was fine. However, I was expecting to be wowed by a new state of the art image, and I have to admit I was disappointed. It improved as I fiddled with the settings, but ultimately, compared to the grand-daddy Phillips, I was surprised to find the image lacking in a certain depth of color and saturation compared to the Phillips. I liken it to the difference between a high quality photo image taken with film and the same image taken with a digital camera. It's just missing something and I was expecting it to have added something more. The picture is sharper and the colors brighter, but something is just off. For instance, I am very aware that news broadcasters are obviously wearing make-up for the camera. Also, in the past I was able to used my Bose Speakers via my DVD player/receiver along with the TV speakers. With this TV, that arrangement produces an echo, so I have to chose one or the other; so I use the good speakers with music shows and the TV speakers for regular viewing; this also was a disappointment. That said, now that I have had it for a while, it is a perfectly fine superior piece of technology and I am happy with it. While I might have gotten an image a little closer to expectation by visiting retail stores, there is something to be said for having the TV delivered to your doorstep in a box, trouble-free of having to transport it across a parking lot and across town. All in all I am happy with this purchase, but I would recommend some comparison shopping first, not that I am convinced that would have made a difference.

Both were 42 inch LED, which I wanted, but the only difference I could see was that the LG 42LV4400 had 120 hz and this one had 60 hz.  Also, the 42LV4400 had a 10,000 contrast ratio, while this one had 3 million.  However, research suggests TV manufactures really stretch the truth about contrast ratios, so take them with a \"grain of salt.\"Well, I decided to choose this one because I heard the 120 hz was unnecessary for sports (its broadcast in 60hz anyway), and because some reviewers said the 42LV4400 TVs seemed to stop working after a while.So glad I chose this model!  You DO NOT need 120 hz.  I watch football and basketball and there was absolutely no video lag whatsoever. Sports and movies looked fantastic.Pros:- USB input on the TV plays music, photos, and VIDEOS.  Many other TVs can only display pictures via the USB drive.- Power, channel, and volume buttons are on the front, not the back, of the TV.

I have an older MacBook that does not incorporate audio into its HDMI output, but this HDTV has an audio input port associated with its HDMI 1 port, so a separate audio cable from the laptop provided audio for streamed Web.

The LED really makes for the best picture quality. Bright and colorfuland all I have it on is the \"standard\" option. To me that's the best option. It does have a built inHD & digital tuner but it only gets a few HD and only a partial of my digital channels. I live inthe Chicago land area and have Comcast. So I had to plug in my digital box to recieve all of the digital channels.No HD but oh well. The sound is really just OK. BUT if you read Consumer Reports,all of the LED TV's from every brand, have just OK sound. If you think about it, these TV's are sothin, there is no way you can get any kind of quality sound in such a confined space. But I think it'sOK for the majority of people. If you want to watch movies and crank up the sound, I would sugest hooking aseperate sound source with additional speakers. So the lack of a compatable built in HD/digital receiver andsound quality I will deduct 1 star but I don't know if the camptibility issue is with comcast of themanufacturer and the sound, like I said is just as good as most other LED's.

Images really pop.- No issue with motion blur, unless your cable provider is at fault.- Ridiculously energy efficient. I think it was like $13 a year assuming 5 hours per day.- Built in menu driven TV image calibration.  This really helped to get the best image quality.- Super thin- Anti glare really works.  I have a fish tank near my couch and it no longer casts a reflection while watching TV.  When the TV is off, you can see a bit of reflection.Cons- Viewing angle not as wide as Plasma.- Sound from speakers are a bit weak.

I used to work in a major department store for 7 years so, I have sold a lot of lcd/led tvs when they came out and this was one that I really wanted to get my hands on but, at the time, the price was, well, out of my price range.  It is not surprising that the quality is so good considering that LG used to be known as Goldstar until 1995.  It also shows that it picked the right company to take over which was Zenith, which was a superb, well-known household name at the time.  Who knew that a company that was founded in 1958 that produced such household appliances such as washing machines and air conditioners would be the second-largest manufacturer of tvs.  I couldn't believe on how fast the shipping was.

All I can compare it to is our old 25\" low-cost big-back TV.We've had the LG TV for almost a week now, and we've used it to play video games, watch live soccer, watch cable, stream Netflix through an Xbox, and play DVD's on an Xbox.  We're pretty happy with it over all except when watching cable.  When we're using it to play video games or to watch DVD's and streaming Netflix, it's good, but cable shows look awful.  We called the cable company and they suggested that we need an HD cable box to fix the problem.  Unfortunately, we didn't know we'd need an HD cable box to get a decent picture on the TV, and since we are not prepared for the extra monthly expense right now, we are stuck with a lot of ghosting while watching cable.  The sound isn't as good as our old TV either, but we can live with that.  I am not completely happy with the color and brightness even though I have gone through and changed all the settings a dozen times and have used the Picture Wizard, but it's not bad.  I also don't like having to stretch the shows to fit the aspect ratio since it distorts the picture, but what's the point of the bigger screen if the picture doesn't fill it?  The zoom option works better, but it's still not ideal, and I am tired of changing the settings every time we want to watch something different.  Honestly, I would like to send the TV back and go back to our old big-back TV, but the big screen is great for Xbox and movies, so we will keep it and eventually get the HD cable box.", "Date": "January 10, 2012"}, {"Title": "Very good TV at the very affordable price", "Author": "Michael Z.

Upon arrival, everything about it was seemingly great, except... I noticed that the right edge of the screen (about 20%) was a bit darker than the rest when looking at a white screen.

However this one was apparent while looking straight at it (on the right side). It was unacceptable and I returned it.

This one had the best reviews and at the time of my purchase, 5/25/11, I found the best price of of $499.99 with free shipping to be through Amazon. Pros: Exterior: Clean lines, exactly as shown. Picture quality as expected. Cons: (1)Was looking forward to the auto-dim but it seems to work in reverse of what I expected. Thought the picture would brighten up when the room was darker and alternately become darker & more contrasting when the room light was brighter.  Instead, the picture becomes very dark, the darker the room. So, now instead of watching TV as we used to with just the lowest of a 3-way bulb on, we have to make the room brighter so the picture is brighter.  Haven't messed with trying to see if we can turn the dim feature off, so don't know if it would make the TV's light & dark any better. But, in short the promoted feature does not work as we expected. (2)Reflection off the screen is greater than my old regular TV. (3)There is no separate Audio connection for other speakers. So, in order to use our other Stereo system speakers, we had to connect them in a way that allows only their use and turns off the TV speakers entirely. With our old antiquated TV, we could either listen to non-musical programming via the TV speakers or use the stereo with greater bass, etc., for music. Now there is no sound at all from the TV unless we manually first turn the stereo on.Added notes: (1) I called LG directly to see why their 120Hz 37\" model was being discountinued. For what it's worth.. They said something like not all other devices can be connected with the 120Hz.  I truly was not clear with their explanation.(2) FYI..
