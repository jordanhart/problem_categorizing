This is a great TV for the price. The remote control has many useful features that saves time sifting through the on screen menu while watching TV. I love the \"Aspect\" button to make partial screen broadcasts into full screen (Cinema) on the TV with a one push of the button. Also, the \"Sleep\" button is very useful. The sleep feature was not even listed in the specs. The QAM tuner allows watching all unscrambled digital and analog channels without a Set-top box. Picture is sharp and the internal speakers are clear, nice and loud. I don't understand why there are so many unfavorable comments about the sound. My most favorite feature is the \"Favorite\" channels buttons on the remote (No pun intended), which also was not listed in the specs. The four favorite selection buttons on the remote makes it a breeze to select and access your favorite channels.I bought a 46\" Samsung smart TV two weeks ago for $200 more than I paid for this TV ($399). Samsung customer service in India were terrible. I am so glad I returned Samsung and bought this TV. I discovered that I don't need/want the Smart feature for internet access on a TV.  It was so slow and froze so much, it was crazy. A computer is much better access to internet. The old adage that a higher priced item is not necessarily better; hold true with this TV.", "Date": "December 29, 2013"}, {"Title": "Guys.......Buy from Walmart online......at $399....", "Author": "Rajeev Desai", "ReviewID": "R3DPVZ6PTYE671", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Guys, I bot this same TV online from Walmart at $399.I donno why Amazon is showing a price of $760!So is Sceptre own site.It is showing $999!...........Wow!Great TV, excellent sound,light weight, ROKU ready, HDMI .....and ofcourse excellent pic quality too....everything excellent.....You can't get a 50 inch ,ROKU ready,lightweight at this price .............guys go visit Walmart site and buy it from there........", "Date": "January 3, 2014"}, {"Title": "Excellent value at $399", "Author": "Bob Elkind \"eteam\"", "ReviewID": "R34YR0OZJL3HL", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "What I like:1.  Does all the things a TV should do2.  Audio (speakers) not great, but not horrible.  Certainly usable.3.  3 HDMI inputs.4.  Enough flexibility in picture controls to 'dial in' very nice image quality.5.  Uniform picture quality across the screen -- no 'hot spots' or backlight bleedthrough6.  Blacks are decently black.  Not completely black, but close enough.7.  Packaging in shipping box was *excellent*.8.  Cable connections are to the side or down, not straight back, which makes wall mounting *easy*.9.  Image processor does a decent job of scaling 720P material to 1080-line display.10. The user manual is available online for download (but as this is written, you have to get the llink from the Sceptre tech support folks).I don't use the Roku-ready feature.What I don't like:1.  The digital audio out is 5.1 *only* for tuner broadcasts.  Any other signal sources, including HDMI (and Roku, if used) are dumbed down to 2-channel stereo at the digital audio output.  So if you want surround sound, you must connect program source directly to audio rig and *not* use this TV's digital audio output.  By the way, this (irritating) design is typical of most TV sets from most manufacturers (including Sony).Also:  For best image quality, the optimal 'aspect' setting is 'FULL (100%)'.After display calibration, here are the settings I used:Mode:  userBrightness:  38Contrast:  75Color:  39Tint:  +4Sharpness:  0Temperature:  NormalAdvanced:  Movie mode ON, all others OFFExcellent value at $399 (walmart).", "Date": "January 25, 2014"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "$999.99", "Features": "50 Class LCD HDTV (viewable 49.5\")\nSupport 1080P HDTV - 3 HDMI Ports\nWith MHL Port\nRoku Ready\nSRS TruSurround HD", "Name": "SCEPTRE X505BV-FMDR 50\" LED Class MHL Ready 1080P HDTV with ultra slim metal brush bezel, 60Hz", "ImgURL": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41uWXMs5uAL._SX300_.jpg", "ProductID": "B00H3IPSJA"}}
