{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Unexpectedly FANTASTIC!", "Author": "Ethan Winning \"Ethan Winning\"", "ReviewID": "R34F7I0N94G97C", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "We have had two new HD TVs for just a bit over 5 months. One is a 23\" Sony and one a 32\" LG. The Sony hooked up easily, but the LG was like our first color set. We diddled with picture, sound, aspect ratio, and other settings to get the best picture and sound on each channel. I still don't know if the differences between channels is resolution, settings, or in the case of the news, makeup. But we were just happy to get it so that we could see all the face lifts...Now for the Haier, a relatively unknown Chinese brand of high definition TV. I plugged it into our Comcast cable box using an HDMI cable, and bingo, a bright and sharp picture with wonderful sound. For a few minutes I was sure a mistake was made, and we had been given a 1080p instead of the 720 that was on the box. Perhaps anything under 50 inches doesn't matter. We think that the Haier is just as good and maybe even a little better picture than the LG! Not one factory setting had to be changed!The sound from the built-in speakers is excellent - in part due to using an HTMI cable - and the Sound Leveler really works. No more spikes when changing channels and it even works on commercials that used to blare 10 db higher than the program.(The hookups and quality are very good with our DVD player and photographs on a flash drive, but they will not be used very much. The TV will not be used with our computer, so I can't address that either. Some will complain about the inputs being placed under a lip in the back, but most HD TVs use the same configuration because so many people will wall mount the TV. If the plugs were straight in, the TV would not be flush with the wall.)Initially, we had so much trouble with the remote from Comcast, that I was about to give this only 4 stars. We can only get HD through the Comcast box, and the Comcast remote - as bad as it is - should be our only remote. But the Comcast remote would not accept the two codes for the Haier TV, and I thought we would have to use two remotes. I called Comcast, and they gave me the same two numbers that came with their box. I called Haier, and they told me that they DIDN'T HAVE CODES FOR Comcast.All was not lost, however. I went on line, asked for \"Comcast remote codes for Haier,\" and the second link was a discussion where one respondent said, \"Try the codes for DURABRAND.\"The third code under Durabrand (10178), and we were set!(And, since I've now been asked this question 4 times by people who are concerned about whether it will fit into their cabinets, the set is 31.25 inches wide, i.e., side-to-side! The 37.8 inches they refer to is diagonally!)I said in the title of this review that it was unexpectedly fantastic. Well, this is a phenomenal TV especially considering that it was the least expensive of all 32 inch HD sets. We now have great Hi Def in our bedroom where, in six minutes, I'm going to watch the last game of the World Series! (Sure, I could watch it in the living room, but I like new experiences.)EW", "Date": "October 28, 2011"}, {"Title": "Great picture quality with a great price!", "Author": "Michael Daugherty", "ReviewID": "RLNNXZYBMEZ69", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I purchased this TV to replace an aging 55\" rear projection Mitsubitshi that i had set up in my office.  While browsing the deal sites I noticed this TV listed at $197 dollars and clicked the link to the Amazon site.  I was not familiar with the Haier brand of televisions and thought of it as a cheap knockoff TV with subpar screens.  There were only four reviews of this TV while i was contemplating the purchase and though they were mostly good i was a little leery about buying this. Amazon made the decision easier by offering a 30 day guarantee with free return shipping so I went ahead and purchased the TV.  I am a subscriber to Amazon Prime, so 2 day shipping was free.  The TV showed up on my doorstep 2 days after the purchase.  Thank you Amazon.  The box that the TV came in was in great shape.  There were no dents and it didn't look like the box had been abused.  The packaging for the TV was superb.  I unwrapped the TV and removed the plastic on the front of the TV.  The front bezel is a very shiny plastic.  The stand which is also a shiny black plastic comes with 4 screws to attach to the TV.  This TV comes with a glowing light at the bottom center of the bezel which indicates whether the TV is on or off.  It shows red when off and green when on.  Nice touch for such a low priced TV.  I hooked my DirectTV box to the TV and selected the correct HDMI input.  The inputs on the back are not exactly in the best positioning for connection of your devices.  I assume they configured the hookups that away because some people like to hang the TV's on the wall install of the stand.  The picture on this TV is very clear with very good color saturation.  Some TV's look a bit washed out but not this TV.  Would this TV compare to a high definition TV such a Sony or Samsung?  I would say no, but you would pay much more for one of those TV's.  Some people have said that the sound is not very good on this TV.  I find that the sound is more than adequate.  It gets plenty loud in my office.  I've never owned any TV where the sound is great coming out of its own speakers.  Thats why they have surround systems.  People, for the price you cannot go wrong with this TV.  If this is the size of TV you are looking for and are wanting to use it in a bedroom or office or anywhere a smaller TV is adequate I would say...Buy it now!!!  Before the price goes up.", "Date": "November 10, 2011"}, {"Title": "GOT DirecTV REMOTE CODE SO IT'S BASICALLY PERFECT", "Author": "Jon", "ReviewID": "R3BIZSCI1JZ5AK", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "DIRECTV REMOTE PROGRAMMING CODE FOR THIS HAIER 32\" HDTVCODE:  10178As my first HDTV I don't have anything to compare it to, but after a week, I am thoroughly pleased and happy with this new TV purchase.Sale price was awesome and free almost next day shipping (ordered sun, arrived tues)Great picture quality, great sound, nothing bad or even annoying to say about it.", "Date": "November 8, 2011"}, {"Title": "Superb TV for the Price.  Excellent picture BUT sound could be betterl.", "Author": "B. Berkowitz", "ReviewID": "R34YF12T1OL4YN", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "Okay, here are my initial impressions about the TV:Pros:1.  I'm pretty pleased with the picture. It looks very crisp and bright. It may not be 1080p, but all the experts say the human eye can not discern the difference between 720p and 1080p in a 32\" TV (assuming your nose isn't pressed up against the screen).  There is a large window behind me and the glare was pretty bad but closing the drapes solved that problem.2.  The buttons to control the TV are conveniently placed on the side and aren't particularly noticeable.  It creates a nice \"clean\" look from the front.  The buttons do feel a bit cheap to the touch though.3.  Very nice viewing angles.4.  The sound is clear and powerful.  But I think mine may be defective since I hear a frequent popping noise which others haven't mentioned.  It seems to go away after the TV \"warms\" up but it is annoying. I'll likely exchange it if the problem continues over the next couple days.5.  A decent number of ports for this price range including all the standard stuff as well as two HDMI inputs and a USB input (not for movies, only music and pics)5.  THE PRICE, THE PRICE, THE PRICE.  At under $200 you can't go wrong.Cons:1.  It is noticeably thicker than other LCD TVs I've seen. I was pretty dissapointed about that. It's not as \"sleek' as I would have liked but of course you can only see this from the side. From the front it looks good. Overall, not horrible but its probably twice as thick as my living room TV, maybe more.2.  It has a high gloss finish along the edges of the TV and the entire remote is a matching high gloss.  It looks nice new but quickly becomes a fingerprint magnet.3. All of the ports except for the RCA jacks and the USB port are on the bottom - VERY inconveniently placed.  If you need to change out cables frequently, this is not the TV for you.  Hopefully you'll only have to do it once during the initial set up.4. I was really excited about there being a USB port but you can't play movies from this. Only jpeg pictures and music. Strangely it couldn't find any on my external hard dive but it is a 1TB drive and maybe it had to scan the whole thing and I didn't want to waste too much time on that since I don't plan on using that feature.  Also the port is on the side and a little too high up.  My portable hard drive has a very short cord and could just barely reach it.7. The remote feels light and cheap but is fine and is better than many other remotes I've seen.  Not too small to get lost but not too big to be inconvenient.9. As I mentioned, the sound is nice and powerful but mine appears to be defective.  Not sure how great the quality control is that this was missed.  Luckily Amazon makes it painless to do an exchange/return on these types of things.Other thoughts:1. For some reason I expected the screen of a 32\" to be larger. Maybe I'm spoiled by my living room TV (50\"). I measured the screen with a tape measure, careful not to scratch the screen. It came to roughly 31.29 inches.  Not really a con but did seem smaller than I expected.2. Energy guide states it will cost an avg. of $22 a year to run the TV. Not sure if that's good or bad but since its less than $2 a month, I can certainly live with it.3. No fancy internet apps or anything, but who cares when so many peripherals offer that now?  My Wii, DVD player and WD Media Player all offer Netflix streaming for instance.  So why pay extra to get in on my TV also?Overall, I'd probably give this thing 2 or 3 stars if I paid $700 for it. Being that I paid under 200, I'd give it 4 or even 4.5 stars assuming the sound hiccup problem gets fixed.  I would have given it 5 stars had the sound worked out of the box.UPDATE 1: I attached a WD Media Player through a component cable and it kept saying \"no signal.\" After disconnecting and reconnecting the cables to no avail, I unplugged the power to the TV and plugged it back in. Then it worked. Strange. But the quality was subpar - I could see lines running through it and at first there was a noticeable green hue. I switched back to HDMI and again the picture was very crisp.  Luckily there are two hdmi inputs so I'll just forgo the component hookup.UPDATE 2:  Just wanted to update everyone that I got my replacement TV.  I had said that the tv was great but that there was a problem with the sound (plenty loud unlike what others stated, but there was a background pinging sound).  Otherwise the TV was great with no other problems over the week or so that I had it. However, the sound problem did not go away.I'm happy to say that the new TV does not have this problem.  It may not quite be as loud as the original one, but can still get to be plenty loud when I crank up the volume.  However, I have no distortion at all.  I've therefore upped my rating to 5 out 5 stars taking into consideration the price I paid.  I'm very happy with it and its grown on me a lot.  My only caveat is that Haier seems to have mediocre quality control so there will be some bad apples in each batch.Conclusion: With Amazon's 30-day free return policy, easy exchanges and price guarantee, you can't go wrong with this purchase.IMPORTANT UPDATE 3! After watching TV for about 15 minutes, the sound distortion started yet again and is incredibly distracting.  I can't believe two TVs would have the identical sound problem.  I contacted the manufacturer about this problem and lowered my review to two stars until I get to the bottom of this.  I'm very dissapointed right now.UPDATE 5.  I've had the TV for several months now and after about 1 or 2 months, the sound problem went away and hasn't come back since.  Very strange.  The manufacturer never did respond to my inquiries though.UPDATE 6- 1 YEAR LATER:  Okay, I'm still very happy with this TV.  In fact many of the minor things that bothered me at first, no longer do.  Picture is still great, sounds is still strong.  Occasionally, the sound distortion I originally described comes back.  Not too often.  Pretty rarely.  But when it happens, if I turn the TV off and then immediately back on, the sound goes away and doesn't come back for a long time.  I upped my review from 2 to 3 stars because the sound should work all the time.  But it is a small price to pay for the deal I got.  Keep in mind, it was unheard of to get a 32\" TV at this price last year.Again, if not for the sound I'd give it 5 out of 5 stars.  If you have a separate sound system, this is a winner for you.", "Date": "November 9, 2011"}, {"Title": "A Very Good TV", "Author": "Charlie The Pug", "ReviewID": "R1ZKFX4ML6G93L", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I have Amazon Prime and my TV arrived in 2 days.  Amazon is absolutely fabulous when shipping you products when you have a Prime account.  The TV arrived in a brown box with some information about the TV written on it.Setting up the TV was easy, but when I opened the screw package 2 screws out of the 4 were shorter than the other two.  It took me a few minutes to figure out that the 2 shorter screws were for the 2 top holes, and the other 2 longer screws were for the bottom 2 holes.  The manual shows all screws are the same size.I plugged the HDMI cable from my HD Direct TV receiver into the back of the TV, and plugged the power cord into the TV.  As noted in another review, where you attach the cables to the TV, the inputs are on the bottom of the set.  This is rather strange, as you have to tilt the TV to make sure you align the cables properly.I turned on the TV and immediately noticed it only showed 480P on every station.  I could not get the TV to change to 720P.  I then moved the TV to another room and it showed 720P.  Later, I realized the HD box in my main room was not set properly.Picture quality is very good.  For $197.00 you cannot go wrong.  There are 6 preset picture modes, which can easily be changed by pushing the picture button on the remote.  I am using the Vivid mode.  If you want you can use the Custom mode and adjust the TV the way you like it.I watched a HBO move which said it was being broadcast in 1081.  It looked great.Sound quality is not bad.  To me the TV sounds good.Build of the set is very good.  It is not a real thin TV.  I am comparing this to a 32-inch Samsung TV, which is a little narrower.Heat.  This TV generates some heat. Much more than the 32-inch Samsung I own.Manual.  I had no idea they could make print so small.  The manual is just a basic manual.The remote is fine; not the greatest, but it serves its purpose.  It works well.Note:  If you are using DirecTV the TV can be programmed to work with the DirecTV remote.  It took me quite awhile to get it to work properly.  The screen said, push the volume button.  If the volume moves press OK.  I did this.  When I went to use the DirecTV remote it didn't work.  Finally I just paged through the codes and I got a code to work.  I have no idea what the code is.  I was just lucky to get it to work.I am very happy with this TV.  The price was right, the picture quality is good, sound is OK.  I would buy another product from Haier.Update  Last night while watching TV I noticed a clicking or popping sound that another person mentioned when changing channels.  When you mute the sound you do not hear the noise.  It is coming from the speakers.  This is not a real problem, but the TV should not do this.  I don't  believe it is necessary to send the TV back.Haier, if you monitor this site you should contact me.  I will also try to get in contact with your company.", "Date": "November 9, 2011"}, {"Title": "Fantastically priced TV", "Author": "Erik Jensen", "ReviewID": "R19KNGVADHBF4O", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I had been looking for a cheap 32\" for a while to replace the old 20\" tube in our \"game\" room when I stumbled upon this TV. I decided that the price was exceptionally right and that it might be sold out in a few days, so I went ahead and ordered it for  $200. I've had it for about a week and it so far exceeds all of my expectations. At first I was worried about the sounds because so many reviews criticized it, but I found them to be bearable through a simple solution.PORTS: This TV includes two HDMI ports and a component and composite port as well. Some people complained about the awkward placement beneath the TV; however, really the only time you have to put up with this is during the setup, which takes less than 20 minutes.SOUND: Now, many people do not understand that you cannot hope for Bose quality sound from a cheap Chinese $200 TV; while the speakers are a bit tinny, they can easily stand by themselves if needed. I, however, simply found an small old boombox and hooked it up to the TV through the headphone jack. This made a phenomenal difference and actually made the sound much more enjoyable.PICTURE: This TV is supposed to run at 720p, and as far as I can tell it does an excellent job at it. Everything is nice, sharp, and clear and is amazing quality for such a cheap TV. I've played a few DVDs and a few shows from Netflix through the 360 and all of them have run pretty close to perfect. The picture quality is completely satisfactory for us and our needs.GAMING: As I mentioned earlier, the plan was for the Haier to go to the gameroom to hook up to our Xbox 360. We hooked it up via an HDMI and BOOM, we had a crystal clear image. We played Reach to test it and I can say proudly that it had almost no lag while running the game. Like I said, Netflix through the Xbox looked great when we watched GI Joe.Overall, I would completely recommend this to a friend, or anyone for that matter. The price is the cheapest you'll ever find a 32\" HDTV anywhere and come up with a quality product. I am very satisfied and have nothing bad to say about this product. If you're on a budget, or just want it as a bedroom TV, buy it NOW while theyre still in stock. =D", "Date": "November 16, 2011"}, {"Title": "TV Dimensions are smaller than listed", "Author": "Mario the Gator", "ReviewID": "R2NXWS6ZFRJ2ZN", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I just bought this TV.

In terms of picture quality, I would rate this set above average.  Please note that I highly recommend a 1080p image over a 720p such as this one (particularly if you frequently watch blu-ray as I do), however the difference between the two is not very noticeable on a 32\" screen.2. The sound quality on this TV is pretty good (sometimes the built-in speakers can be terrible on these units).3. I also like the design of the remote, which is small and sleek.  For those who hate those large remotes with a hundred buttons that you never use, this is the remote for you!**********NEGATIVES1. All the important inputs, including HDMI, digital coaxial, and cable are all in the worst possible location - they are located at the very bottom of the TV, in the back, facing downward (see product photos).  I suppose this is okay if you are mounting the TV on a wall, but for those who want to use a TV stand it is a real nightmare to plug cables into the back.2. I frequently use a set of headphones while watching TV (so I don't disturb the rest of my family).  In every television I've ever owned, when you plug the headphones into the headphone jack, the TV automatically disables the speakers.  With this TV, that is not the case - the speakers continue to emit sound even after you plug in headphones.  It seems the only way to turn the speakers off is to use the \"Mute\" button (the sound still pays through the headphones)...  But whenever you go to adjust the volume, the \"Mute\" is disabled and the speakers turn on once again.  This makes it impossible to adjust the volume through the headphones without the speakers roaring to life.*EDIT* It is possible that I received a defective product, and so this may be a problem with my TV unit only.  I cannot say for sure, because multiple attempts to contact Haier about the issue have been unsuccessful.3. If you have a problem or need help with a product, it seems that Haier is not very responsive.  I wrote to Haier by email for product support (about the issue with the headphones).  It has been 5 days and I have not received a response.  This is too long... in my experience most electronics companies will respond to your inquiry in 48 hours or less.*EDIT* It has now been 15 days since I first contacted Haier, and have attempted to contact them again since.  They are non-responsive to emails.**********In closing, I was unfamiliar with the Haier brand when I was sent this television.  Upon further research, I learned that Haier is a Chinese company and is the world's largest producer of household appliances, and I guess they are looking to increase their TV presence here in the states - but they have a long way to go.All the essentials for general TV viewing are here.  But while picture and sound quality is at above average, there are many minor issues that prevent me from recommending this television.  If you are looking to buy a TV for video gaming or for a home theater, I would recommend a 1080p television from a more reputable brand.I believe that a TV is a serious investment, so why not spend a little more and get the highest quality product?", "Date": "October 29, 2011"}, {"Title": "Great deal but be aware this requires VESA 400x200 mount.", "Author": "T.

Britt \"Radio Rah\"", "ReviewID": "R2E1LOVMGHDMDG", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "This TV is perfect for the person who needs a Television for a spare bedroom, a dorm room, guest houses, motel rooms, kids room, game rooms, etc. If you are a practicle person who doesnt like to spend more then absolutely needed. This is a great TV! The picture quality may not be as good as a TV costing 100-150 more...but it's not far from it(comparing to an 32 inch LG purchased 6 months ago for mid 300. The picture from 2 feet away I can pick it apart and say my LG is processing the antenna signal much better...The Hiaer makes people look as if they are oil paintings sometimes...however from a natural viewing angle say 5 plus feet away... the Hiaer looks sharp and the colors POP. The colors a very saturated with the presets... graphic extensive commercials gave me a happy feeling, And I use energy saver mode setting. However, you can customize it how you like. If you are the type of person who enjoys the shows or movies for the writing and acting and you arent always seeing it as an obsticle course for your televison(by how well it processes blacks, or handles frame rates) this picture quality is more then enough. 90 out of 100 people would be fine with this TV's image quality. The sound is for a bedroom not a living room. Meaning you will need to hook up a surround speaker system to get rich loud sound and bass. Which I think is the case for all TV's. I have found theater mode to be fine for the room the TV is in. Which is the smallest bedroom of a 3 bedroom home. It would suffice in any of the bedrooms but not the living room (which has a wide space). At about level 30 to 50 I can enjoy the TV from 6 plus feet away while lying in bed. PS3 looks great through the HDMI, My laptop looks great through the HDMI(better then my 1080p laptop screen).I believe Haier is trying to infiltrate the American Television market with this TV here. They are a reputable Chinese company better known for kitchen appliances. This TV model was not on their website and their other TV's had price points just about where everyone elses are now. It makes sense for then to make a great product at a price that under cuts the competition if it gets them inside your home. Once it's there, it's gonna stay.

I am using it primarily as a gaming display for my XBOX360 and to stream Netflix and I am very happy with my purchase despite the mediocre sound quality of the television.POSITIVES:*Excellent picture quality. Above average backlight, superb color reproduction and stunningly clear images. (I am using a high quality HDMI cable; I have not tried any other inputs).*Easy to use menus with many options. Customizable inputs, full sound equalization, full display color controls.*Fully-functional, well-designed remote control.*Exceptional viewing angle. The image quality is hardly diminished when viewing television from a 45+ degree angle from 15+ feet away.NEGATIVES:*Mediocre sound quality. Speakers distort at medium volume when playing action video games. Sound is mostly unaffected when customizing sound settings and adding more bass with on-board equalizer (I will note that I have the television connected via headphone jack to a Pioneer sound system and the sound quality is excellent).*No RCA audio outputs. However, sound quality from headphone jack is excellent and is controlled along with the television volume via remote control -- which I am very happy about.*Limited inputs/outputs (see Amazon images).All in all, for the price, this television far exceeds my expectations. I will be using it as my primary television in a small apartment and I expect to use it for a very long time. The image is better than any of the 32\" televisions at my local Best Buy (LED models included). I just don't agree with some of the other reviewers who claim the sound quality is above average; I think it is rather average.For $197, you can't go wrong.

I'm not sure what the other reviewers who complained about the audio were expecting from a 32 inch TV. The volume is strong in my 14'x15' room, and it's not even turned up halfway.The remote is basic but has some style to it, like the piano-black finish.Appearance-wise, the TV is attractive from the front, and it's a bit thick from its profile. But because my TV is in the corner of the room, I don't see the sides.Changing channels on my cablebox between HD channels is fast, taking less than a second, and so is the changing between standard channels. Where the TV slows down a bit is when changing from HD to SD or vice versa, which takes about 4-5 seconds. The TVs start-up from standby is just under 10 seconds.So far I'm extremely happy with this TV, but I have not tested all the other inputs. I have no issues at all and am considering grabbing another one before they sell out.I did notice the holes on the back for the wall mount are further apart than on other 32 inch models, which causes you to spend a bit more on a larger wall mount than the regular 100x200 or 200x200 VESA.

I did briefly hook it up in our bedroom to the HD DVR just to see how it would look with a HD source, and it looks good.

For a playroom, guest room, etc, it would be perfect.The Haier's sound isn't terrible, but it isn't anything to write home about either. It's a little tinny and you have to crank it up pretty loud to hear over the treadmill in the exercise room. Which brings me to the one thing that drives me nuts about it - when you want to crank it up from, say 20 to 80, it seems to take ages for the volume to increase. I have never seen a TV's volume move so slowly before!

Since I had a crappy old tv in the bedroom I was looking around for a new tv when this one caught my eye. 200 bucks for a 32 inch set? Now that's a deal!Pros:Affordable!LightweightRelatively Known BrandCons:Picture quality could be much better(see explanation below)Sound is HORRIBLY LOWATSC tuner not that great.Ok for the explanations.This tv IS a GREAT VALUE for what you're paying. Its pretty lightweight and the brand is fairly new but recognizable. The picture quality is NOT terrible but since I am used to my Bravia that runs at 1080p it was a strange adjustment going back to a 720p set. There's more pixelation than on the Bravia.(side note: I watch over the air tv with a basic antenna on both tv's).On this set the tuner gets most over the air channels but it is a hassle trying to fine tune the signal; whereas on my Bravia there is almost never any interference when watching over the air channels.Also this tv sometimes produces an image quality that makes some shows look like cartoons. In a sense if you have ever watched the film \"A Scanner Darkly\", you'll see the resemblance. Look up that movie and you'll see that that is what some channels look like on this tv. Its NOT a HUGE problem but it will take some getting used to.Now the biggest con is the sound. I kid you not, it is TERRIBLE. If anybody else tells you any different, then they probably live alone or in a quiet library. These speakers are EXTREMELY LOW and the equalizer doesn't make much of a difference. Luckily for me, I had some spare Altec Lansing computer speakers lying around and they work perfectly with this tv. Since they are plugged in through Headphone jack it was simple to just plug them in and get great bass from them. If not for my speakers, I probably would've returned this tv.So in conclusion, I am very pleased with my purchase and you will be too if either: you have never owned a flat panel tv OR you don't care about low volume speakers OR you are just looking for a very inexpensive tv that simply gets the job done for what its worth. 2 hundo buckeroos?

Here is a log of the experience I had when I filed a claim:07/26/12 - Called Haier America at 1-877-337-3639 and talked with customer service to file a warranty claim against the 32\" TV purchased from Amazon.com on 11/22/11.Customer service scheduled a service call with a company named \"WWTS\" for Thursday, 08/02/12, between the hours of 8am - 5pm.  She indicated that they will call me to confirm the time when they will show up.  WWTS phone number is 1-866-856-9897.07/27/12 - Received call from service shop from Lowell, MA (978) 848-9000 requesting information regarding what the TV is doing.  Explain that the TV will go Blank with no picture and no sound but the Standby (Red) light and On (Blue) light will change when you push the power button.  Also explained that the TV will come back on if you put it in Standby mode for approx. 30 - 60 minutes then turn the TV on, it will come back on and stay on.  He said that he's going to order two parts for the technician repair guy today and it should reach them within 3 - 5 business days.  Once the technician receives the parts, he/she will call me and schedule a date and time to come and repair the TV (so the 08/02/12 date is no longer valid).08/01/12 - Received call from the technician from WWTS wanting to schedule an appointment to come and repair the TV.  Went ahead and schedule it for today at 3:30 PM.The technician came and worked on the TV.  He struggled to get the back cover of the TV off but finally he was able to get it off (after about 30 minutes).  It appears that there was something on the top of the TV was latched on tight.  He replaced the Power Supply Unit (PSU) and the Main Circuit Board (MCB); the two parts that was ordered and shipped to him.  He tried plugging in the TV and it did not work.  He then tried to switch different combination (i.e. - New PSU & Old MCB, Old PSU & New MCB, etc.) but none of them worked.  What happens now is that as soon as you plug in the TV, the LCD would come on but no picture or sound and the Blue (On) light will come on and stay on.  Before when you plug the TV in the outlet, the Blue (On) light will come on temporarily but the LCD would not come on (it always stayed off) and the Blue (On) light will change to Red (Standby).  So now, the TV is completely disabled.  At least before, the TV worked.What's in the TV now is the Old PSU but a New MCB.  The technician kept the New PSU and my Old MCB and placed it in the box that the replacement parts came in.  He called into the Tech Center to inform them of the situation.  He indicated that they are going to be shipping him some other parts and as soon as he receives them he'll contact me to schedule another visit to try and fix the TV.08/07/12 - Received call from the same technician and he indicated that he received the part that he ordered last week.  Went ahead and scheduled another appointment for this afternoon at 3:00 PM for him to try and fix the TV for the second time.He came and attempted to fix the TV for the second time at 3:00 PM.  He installed the new MCB (the newer one that was ordered from his last visit).  He got the same results as last time (the Blue (On) light will come on and stay on but it does not change to Red (Standby) light).  He then tried disconnecting the three wires attached to the back of the TV (the Speakers, USB, and Video A/V cables).  The TV then appeared to have some functions.  He then replaced my Old PSU with the New one from last time that he took with him and tried plugging everything in (including the wires on the back of the TV), and the TV would not function.  He basically gave up and called his Tech Support to explain that this was his second attempt and he could not get the TV to work.However, I noticed that on the MCB, there were two male plug slots where the USB wire could fit (identical pin configuration).  I advised the technician to maybe try plugging the USB wire into the other male plug slot and see if that does anything.  When he did that, the TV now functions!!!  So, all along, he probably could have gotten the TV fixed the first time.  It would appear that he forgot how the wires on the back of the TV was originally plugged into the MCB when he first took it apart and when he installed the new MCB & PSU, he plugged the USB wire into the wrong slot causing the TV to be non-functional.Also, Because the technician kept taking the TV apart, he broke a little latch that holds the Blue (On) & Red (Standby) light chip that is attached to the back of the TV.  When you look at it, there's a slot for this chip and there's two little plastic latch that holds the chip in place.  With one of the latch broken, the chip kind of dangles and it will fall out very easily.  When I put the TV together, it seems that I was able to close the back of the TV and the chip seems to have settled in place and the Blue (On) & Red (Standby) light functions okay.One thing that I noticed after this repair was that before when you plug in the TV, the Blue (On) light would come on and after a few seconds, the light would switch to Red (Standby).  The TV never comes on during this process.  Now, when you plug in the TV, the Blue (On) light would come on and the entire TV will also come on.  You can use the function keys on the side of the TV or the TV remote to control the TV (i.e. - change channels, change volume, power off, etc.) but it does not automatically change into Standby mode like before.This does not pose a big problem other than when the power goes out then comes back on, it will turn the TV on because it appears now anytime when the TV goes from cold (i.e. - no electricity flowing to it) then to warm (i.e. - electricity is now flowing to it), it will cause the TV to come on.  So now, anytime when I'm going to be gone for an extended period (i.e. - overnight trips away from home) I will need to make sure to turn the surge protector OFF!  This is to ensure that while I'm away and the power does go out then come back on, the TV doesn't come on and stay on for an extended period of time when nobody is home to turn the TV off.I wanted to wait for awhile to see if anything changes but as of the date of this posting (10/28/12), everything is still the same.  The TV is still in working order other than the problem of going from cold to warm.  It will be interesting to see how long the TV will last (maybe another year???).", "Date": "October 28, 2012"}, {"Title": "Ripped off!!", "Author": "zorakondvd", "ReviewID": "RJKD5ZG8BDJRP", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "TV is not fully functional.There is severe audio static -- it sounds like my TV thinks it's a faulty AM radio and there is constant white noise and AM radio hiss.I was ripped off!", "Date": "August 6, 2012"}, {"Title": "Be Aware  - Quality Issues", "Author": "Kenya L.

I have been debating doing it for awhile but recent events have made me feel that I should.  So, here goes... I purchased 2 of these TVs in November of 2011 during the pre-holiday blitz.  I was looking for a great deal and I thought this might be it.  I was quite wrong.  I placed 1 tv in my master bedroom and the other in a guest bedroom.  Master bedroom worked fine.  I was quite impressed with the picture quality - on par with some of the best.  However, the sound quality was extremely poor.  I added some external speakers to it though and all seemed fine.  I had guests in town in late January.  I hadn't really used that TV but expected no issues with it.  It was brand new.  TV worked fine for the them on Day 1.  Day 2 - the TV would come on but picture and sound were blank.  Nothing.  Black.  I did a little research and saw that this was a fairly well know issue for at least this model of Haier TV (please search on Amazon for discussion forums on this topic and other general feedback online - you will find plenty).  After seeing how prevalent of an issue this was - I just decided to contact Amazon for a refund.  They were gracious enough to accommodate my request and did indeed refund my money.Now on to the TV in my Master.  I did encounter the same issue with this TV a few weeks later.  However, I was able to reset it by holding the power button down and the TV started back working fine.  Fast forward to 2 weeks ago.  TV had been working fine but I came home one evening and turned it on...  out of nowhere... nothing.  Just did not work.  Could not reset it.  Nothing.  I contacted Haier directly.  Unfortunately, my experience with their customer service was extremely poor.  I just had the feeling I was \"bothering\" them the entire time.  They initiated a service request to my home from a provider that was 2 1/2 hours away.  The thing is, the repair company never showed up to my home.  I waited the standard 4 hour window - tried calling - no answer.  And they never called.  Again, I contacted Haier and again I just felt like they didn't care.I just decided to scrap it and buy another brand.  It's not worth the trouble honestly.  Clearly there is a quality issue with these TVs.  What are the chances that I purchased 2 lemons?  Rare.  It is a shame that a company is able to sell a product that they have to know is clearly defective.  But, I've just decided that I will never buy another Haier product and I have certainly shared my experience with my family and friends.  I also felt obligated to share this experience with other potential buyers as well.

Fingers crossed the 2nd TV won't be a lemon as well...--I ordered this TV during the amazon sale just prior to thanks giving. What a bargain! It worked well and the picture was great until one day it just randomly decided to not turn on anymore. I tried unplugging it then plugging it back into the power socket and it wouldn't work. Waiting a couple of hours and then plugging it in the power socket again didn't do anything either. So I called Haier America and they told me that a repair man will be scheduled to fix it at my place. Then another phone call later they told me that the repair wasn't confirmed, that it would only happen after internal approval. Approval on what?!? My TV was fine until it decided to just stop working barely a month after buying it and it needs company approval for it to be fixed/exchanged?! Anyway so I wait for them to call me back regarding status of repair approval. I get a call 3 days later telling me that they have run out of spare parts required to fix the TV so they'll need to submit my case for an exchange approval. Great...another 5 day + wait. I waited and waited and nobody ever called back. I left 2 voicemails and still nobody called back. On the 3rd try I get through and the customer service rep opens my case to tell me that it has been approved for an exchange. AWESOME.

I have to question anyone that tells you that the sound is acceptable. I was already disappointed; my old lady heard it, and gave me the evil eye. Compared to the CRT TV it replaced, it sounded like a tinny cheap radio. I had a pair of old computer speakers. connected them to the headphone port, and problem solved (luckily).Curious Price Note: The 20\" TV it replaced was purchased in 1989, and I paid $379 for it (it was stereo!).

I got to admit that I know nothing about TVs, but I got to say that it wasn't so great as I read on the reviews. What I like about it was the price ($200 is not too bad) and the delivery that was free and fast (it only took three days to arrive). I was exited at first because I read all the good reviews about this TV (which most of them were 4 or 5 stars), but then I saw the bad reviews and I got worry because I didn't want to receive a TV that later on I will have to return. However, I decided to stop reading the reviews and wait for it to see it with my own two eyes. When I received it and open the box, I checked everything: all the parts where in the box, it arrived in good condition, and the hook up was easy.  Now, here is my opinion about the picture quality. I read in a review that \"if you are close enough you can see little dots on the TV\" this is actually true, but I'll say they look more like blur edges on the images. Now, I read in another review that \"the picture quality of this TV was as good as a 1080p TV\" I don't think this is true. I went to my friends house the other day and we watch TV (he has a 1080p HDTV) and trust me it looks nothing like it; although, I was trying to watch TV through an antenna (Not recommended if you live in a basement or in an apartment with no windows at a building's lower level), so I think it might seem different depending on your cable provider. I won't say don't buy it, just like I won't say \"OMG is the greatest TV ever, you should buy it.\" However, it is 32\" better than my old tv I'll say that!, but if you know about picture quality and you are specting something great!! maybe is not the right TV for you. But wait, I'm going to put cable in my apartment and see if my picture quality changes. Then I will change or most likely update my review. I hope my review could help you in anyway.-------Update-------After having it for a little more than a week I can finally say that it doesn't worth $200 to me, I've seen better TV's that cost less. The speakers of the TV do not work properly it makes kind of a \"s\" sound. However, I hook my TV to a saround system and it solved the problem right away. That is the reason why I decided not return it. But, if you don't want to pay more for a saround system, then my recomendation is not to buy it and look for something else; otherwise, you are going to have a headache traying to understand why stuff from your tv don't work.", "Date": "December 9, 2011"}, {"Title": "AHHH!!!

TV looks great and the picture is awesome.  There are only two issues.The first, a small issue is the jacks in the back of the TV.  By this I am referring to your HDMI, AV, Headphone jack and any other connections.  The way they are placed makes it difficult to utilize when you cannot see them.  I often had to put the TV at an angle and have my wife hold it while I plugged in the cord.  This is not a deal breaker.The big problem is the speakers.  These are the worst speakers I have ever heard that aren't blown out.  I have better speakers in my Archos Tablet and if you are wondering what the hell Archos is that just proves my point.  This problem is fixable but it will cost you money.  I was able to connect decent computer speakers that cost me 35.00 on sale from 60.00.

I was concerned about the quality for the price but based on the review and Amazon's generous return policies, we decided to take the plunge.  For the most part, we are very happy with the TV but as expected there are some seriously nagging issues.  Whether or not they are a dealbreaker remains to be seen.Pros:The picture quality (PQ) is excellent.  So far, we've tried HD TV via the internal QAM tuner, DVD, Blu-ray and Wii.  All the images are very nice.  In this size, 720p is perfect.  Actually, 720p is perfect in the 50\" plasma we have as well so PQ was not a worry.  I immediately took the TV off the Vivid settings and used the Theater setting which is very nice.  Setting up the TV is very easy.  Getting the stand on requires four screws and a long philips-head screwdriver with a small head.  The TV is very light so it's easy to work with.  The inputs underneath are something I wish my wall mounted TVs had and I didn't find them hard to reach.  There's inputs for everything from HDMI for the Windows Media Extender to component for the Wii to coax for the cable.  There's also a QAM tuner so the TV can tune the unencrypted digital cable channels  (PBS, NBC, ABC, CBS, etc.) in HD without needing a converter box.  The TV is a perfect size for the kids' use.Cons:The sound.  The built-in speakers sound like my cell phone speakerphone at best.  I knew this from reading the reviews and planned to just plug the headphone-out into a simple bookshelf system which has a single AUX input (so 3.5mm headphone to L/R RCA).  The speakers are bad enough but what happens when you plug into the headphone jack, the only audio out, makes the situation worse.  Unexpectedly, plugging in headphones does not automatically mute the built-in speakers.  And, to get proper sound from the headphone connection, you need to turn the volume all the way up.  You can then mute the TV and the sound still comes out the headphone jack but turning the TV off then back on turns off the muting and blasts the speakers again until you mute.  This makes it really hard to workaround the built-in speakers sounding so horrible.  Since I expect my kids to use this, I really don't want to have to deal with this.If it wouldn't void the warranty, I am tempted to open up the TV and disconnect the internal speakers permanently.  It'd be no big deal if the headphone jack muted the horrible internal speakers as expected.  I am going to give the digital coax output a try and see if, unlike the headphone jack, it's independent of the TV volume.  If it is, then I would give this four stars.  Otherwise, I will be returning it.[Update] Neither of my bookshelf systems have a digital coax input so I've gotten an RMA for the TV and bought a different one for $30 more that has the necessary audio connections.

My mother had ordered one for $199 and after seeing it, I decided to buy one for my bedroom. Had seen the reviews talking about the horrible sound and other problems but I really like this TV.Pros:Picture quality. I don't have cable and use a digital antenna to get signal. Watching a college football game right now in 720p and it looks beautiful. When I hooked up the TV the person who used it last had \"Vivid\" setting on, so I just left it considering how good the picture looks. The secondary channels that come in 480p look decent. Not great, but not terrible. Plan on watching Blu-Rays and Netflix as well once the player arrives.Sound. This may not always be a pro, however. I use this TV in my bedroom and I am about 5 feet from the screen. I have the volume level at 20 and it is plenty loud and easy to understand what is being said. When I was at my mother's house (who has Cable through a converter box), she had the volume at about 80 and it was not as loud as what I'm hearing right now. I don't know if that is a problem with her TV, the cable, or what. But since others complained about the sound, it seems to be random as to how your unit will be.EDIT: 11/29/11Hooked up a pair of Logitech 2.1 Computer Speakers to the TV via the headphone jack. It's somewhat strange as to how the volume is controlled: I have both the bass and the speaker volume all the way up. However, the TV volume still controls the speaker volume. You need to turn the sound up on the TV and then mute it so the sound only comes through the speaker system. A little bit annoying but it sounds a lot better now.Remote. Very nice looking remote. Gets fingerprints easily.EDIT: 11/29/11I just got a blu ray player and hooked it up to the TV with an HDMI cable. It does say when hitting \"Display\" that the image is in 1080p. I don't know if that's correct but it's what is appearing.Cons:Design - All the hookups being on the bottom is somewhat difficult, but as long as you aren't constantly plugging/unplugging things in, it's no big deal. Just hook everything up at the same time. As others have said, it is also a fingerprint magnet, but I don't plan on touching the TV much either.There is also a small popping/clicking noise occasionally when I change channels.If you can get this TV for $199 or below, I highly recommend buying it.", "Date": "November 25, 2011"}, {"Title": "fantastic", "Author": "gegegege", "ReviewID": "R1PC0HRCUV3B2E", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Very perfect.

The TV is used to play PS3 games and to view TV while working out on treadmill and stationary bike. I have Comcast Cable connected directly to the TV without a cable box, so I don't get HD TV on it. The channels in standard defintion at 480i are just horrible. Some of the channels in 720p are slightly better. The channels in 1080i are decent. I was thinking that it just wasn't exceptable even at the under 200.00 I paid until I played a Blu-Ray movie on my PS3. Wow, what a differnce in HD. The Haier is excellent in HD. Also games played with my PS3 look great. I own a 58\" Samsung plasma and a 32\" Phillips LCD so I know HD is much better than SD. But on my other 3 HDTV's including the much older 26\" Sylvania, the SD channels are much better than on the Haier. The audio has a lot to be desired. I have a 5.1 surround sound system made for the XBOX 360 connected to the Haier that addresses the poor audio situation. One other strange issue is how the TV channels are numbered when you do the auto channel search. Some of the channels are numbered like, 17.1, 17.2 17.3. I never saw that before. One positive is that the Haier found a lot more digital channels without a cable box than the Sylvania could.******UPDATE November 28, 2013*****After just over 2 years of owning this TV it just completely died. The only thing that works is the blue/red on and off indicator light. I see many more people here had the exact same thing happen. I'm 59 and have owned many TV's over the years and never had one brake in 2 years. Not even close. I will never buy another Hair TV and anyone who does is wasting their money because they will prematurely break down. Too bad I cannot give it zero stars.

I expect things to go wrong with electronics, and this broke during the warranty period so I was not too concerned.  Bad mistake.  First, although I live in Tampa, FL, which is a HUGE city with a population of almost 350K people, there was not a single authorized repair facility in town.  My choices were too drive to Zepherhills (100 miles round trip) or St. Petersburg (60 miles round trip) for repairs.  Please keep in mind that I had to make that round trip twice.  After several weeks of the repair facility trying to get it fixed, not being able to get parts, etc etc, it turned out it was the motherboard and the TV had to be replaced.  The repair facility was not authorized to process the replacement paperwork, so I had to go back to them and pick up the TV so I could send Haier the labels off of it. No big deal, I figured everything would process quickly, and I would get the replacement soon.  I have now been waiting over 3 months for this replacement, and as of today it has apparently still not shipped.  Of course, they could not tell me it had not shipped, they just didn't have any tracking information yet, but, according to them, it should ship out in the next 7 to 10 days and everything is going as it should and right on schedule. (As it should and on schedule???) Please understand this was a $249 dollar TV, not a $1000 unit!  I had an issue with a $600 iPad and Apple replaced it within 2 days.  Sorry, I won't buy anything by this company again.  This was my first and only purchase.  If yours lasts, congrats!  If not, prepare to go through repair/replacement purgatory.This is an update to the review - it is now January 14 and I just now received my replacement TV.  Almost 4 months after taking it in for repair.  If this is going to be a main TV in your home, please think about it hard.

From the beginning, the picture was fine and the sound was kind of murky, but for the price, it seemed like a good deal.On June 22, the television stopped working.  The LED power light would turn red or green, but there was no picture and no sound.  I called Haier America about the set and they send a technician out who could not fix the set onsite and, as it turned out at his repair center either.  Two weeks later, a replacement order was issued for the set and that's when the customer service horror truly began.Two weeks later, still no contact.  At this point, I contacted a Haier representative who said she would email me the paperwork they needed to process the return.One week later, still nothing.  Another call determined, they got the email address wrong.  I received an email with the paperwork, filled it out and sent it by overnight shipment.  About a week later I finally get a call from a representative who wants to know if I still have the television.  I call back the next day to find out what she needed.Another week goes by without a call back.  The another week goes by.  Finally, miracle of miracles, I get a call back.  Now I need to return the television.  I call back again.  They will send a shipping label - albeit grudgingly, but I have to find a box to send it back.  The original one got thrown away back in February when I was still mistakenly under the impression that the set actually worked.So now I am waiting for the shipping labels and am steeling myself for several more weeks of trying to get a warranty replacement out of a a company that refuses to be accountable for its own shoddy merchandise.

No one called me.After about 3 weeks, I called Haier. They said I need to send in the receipt so I can get a replacement.  I did.  I called after a couple of weeks.  They told me they didn't get my receipt.  Then, someone else left me a message and told me they did receive it, but that I would need to fill out an \"affidavit to dispose of it\".  Huh?Then, I talked to a different person who said he would email me the affidavit.  Nothing.  I called again about a week later.  Someone finally emailed me the affidavit to dispose of TV and also said I needed to send the stickers on the back of the TV.  I sent both in certified mail.  I called after certified mail was received.  They told me my letter wasn't received.  I told them it was certified and it was received.  They told me they'd call me back.  They called me back and said my letter was actually received and now they would put me up for some sort of review.  No one called. I called them. They say actually now they want me to send them the TV.  But, my husband has already disposed on it as he was told to do in the \"affidavit to dispose of it\".  They said they will have to talk to higher ups and get back to me.  They get back to me and said they will be sending me a replacement TV right away.  That was July.No TV.I talked with Haier about a week and a half ago.  They had no record of previous phone call and asked me if I sent in my stickers and affidavit.  I explained the situation.  They said they had to speak with higher ups.  They did and called me back, apologizing and assuring me they would be sending me a tv and that I would not need to call back.No TV.Talked to haier on 8/22, just to make sure TV was being sent.  She had no record of precious conversation.  She asked if I'd sent in my TV.  I explained.  She said she'd call back that day.  She did not.Talked to haier on today, 8/23.  Rude guy told me my case had been turned over to some department and someone would get back to me in 3 to 4 business days.  Ahhhh!!!!UPDATE 8/31 Surprisingly, no one called back in 3 to 4 days.  I called today.  The lady said apparently my information went to the wrong place. UH-huh.  Also, she told me they have no record of ever receiving my stickers on the back of the TV or my affidavit to dispose of TV.  (So glad it I sent them certified mail!)  She also acted like I was making up the stories of being promised a TV, as there is zero record of that in my case notes.  Finally, she told me someone will get back to me in 48 business hours.  I made sure to record her name this time.  To be continued...UPDATE #2 No one called.  I called back on 8/31.  Lady says she has no record of me sending in serial tags or affidavid to dispose of it, but someone should get back to me in 48 business hours.9/6 No one called me.  I called.  A different woman says my case is in tier 2 and other people are in front of me so I have to wait my turn.  She told me someone would call me back today.No one called...again.9/7 I called. Put on hold for about 15 minutes. A man told me the notes from the 2nd guy who came to repair my TV were incomplete.  Interesting--I've never heard this before.  He told it should be resolved by Monday and someone will call me Monday.  I told him I'll plan on calling Monday.At this point I have no expectations of getting a replacement TV.  Just curious to see all excuses they can come up with. :)Another UPDATE: 9/11 (Tuesday)  I called.  Talked to a guy. Very nice. He told me TV was officially declared  broken on 9/7.  Put me on hold for at least 20 more minutes.  Hasan told me he couldn't get a tv sent out today.  Things got messed up because I didn't send in all three things (receipt, affidavit, and stickers) at the same time AND because I didn't send in the TV which I was told to dispose of.  He told me he would personally call me back a week from Wednesday with some type of a resolution.(One week from Wednesday)--nice guy didn't call.  I called Thursday, Sept 20.  Talked to a woman who told me they didn't receive the affidavit or stickers.  Put me on hold.  She would have her supervisor look  at this and expidite this and he is very good at calling back.The supervisorr didn't call 9/21 I called and talked to a man.  He said he talked to the supervisor of the previous woman I spoke with. The supervisor was busy with another customer but will call me back by 8pm and tonight AND just to ensure I get called back he (guy on phone) will also call me back before he leaves at 8pm.No one called.9/24 Talked to a new woman.  She said everything has been approved for exchange and proof of purchase has been validated.  And it should be completely approved by tomorrow and sent out to warehouse.  I'm to call back in 48 hours to confirm.  If there are any problems I can ask to speak specifically with her and she will get an email, then call me back.9/26 Wednesday--I call to confirm that my TV has been sent.  Talked to a different woman.  Apparently my TV replacement still says it's approved, but my case is still lingering in \"unresolved\".  The woman said she would email the lady I spoke to on 9/24 and have her call me if there are any updates.  She said I should call back in 24 hours and it should be taken care of.9/27 Thursday.  Called back and spoke to someone new again.  Said it was still in unresolved, but it's been approved so he said it looks like it should go through.  I mentioned that it's been in  unresolved for a few days.  \"Any idea what is not resolved?\"  He put me on hold to check on it.  He said it's been approved, but they're just dotting their i's and crossing their t's--making sure they didn't miss anything.  It should be resolved in a couple of days.Amazing. :)", "Date": "August 23, 2012"}, {"Title": "problematic", "Author": "saints-r-us", "ReviewID": "R2BXIDJQQXP21F", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "this tv broke on me 3 times in 8 months. haier sent a technician out to fix it twice. on the third time the technician could not fix it so they allowed me to send it back..it has now been over 3 weeks and they still haven't sent me a new tv", "Date": "August 23, 2012"}, {"Title": "Do Not Buy This Television, If there's a Problem, You're Screwed", "Author": "Kasey", "ReviewID": "R1X9Y9T3JITDD7", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "If your tv works, great!

If you are ready to go to sleep, it wakes you up.  Guess I'll just use the TV remove to turn it off, it doesn't make any noise that way.I did have to use Durabrand to make the Direct TV remote work.

Actually, the color and clarity are better than my 55 inch Samsung that I bought last year. I am thinking about selling the Samsung and getting a 55 inch Haier for under $1000.  There is no reason to spend what I did for the Samsung.  LEDs are overrated--this Haier is an LCD without any back or edge lighting---which I think makes the picture too bright.

Right now I see it is still under $300 but a bit more.  I have used it for over a month and decided to write a review about it.Firstly, I bought this TV for my room and have it hooked up to my computer through an HDTV connection.  I have a Raedon 6870 GPU and have my main 22\" monitor connected to it and this is the secondary monitor I use to watch streaming video and play my computer games from my couch.  I do not have this TV hooked up to an off-air ant, or cable, or satellite.  Just to my computer.  So I realize this review will not be of benefit to everyone.For the sound I bought a cheap pair of logitech speakers that do the trick just fine.  Have them connected to the audio out on my motherboard.  So as far as the sound on the TV itself is, I don't know how it is, nor do I care, and that was never a concern for me when I purcahsed this TV.  I have read it isn't that great.  Which I can't tell you one way or the other.  But the sound with my logitech speakers I bought for $20 off Amazon is great.  Here is a link to those speakers if anyone is curious:  http://www.amazon.com/Logitech-S220-Speaker-System-Subwoofer/dp/B000RQSGYO/ref=pd_cp_e_2Now to get to the TV.  I have it hooked up at a native resolution of 1920x1080.  The color that it comes with out of the box is horrible.  And the presets aren't any better.  In fact I got a little dispondent over the matter.  As I have a Vizio in my main room and the color on it is much better.  But with a little tweaking the color is actually quite good.  You cannot change the \"tint\" option through the HDMI connection but you are allowed to tweak Brightness, Contrast, Color, Sharpness, and also have an advanced section to change the monitor temperature along with other things.  For anyone that is curious these were the settings I was able to tweak it to:  Brightness 50; Contrast 52; Color 57; Sharpness 57; Color Temperature - Normal; Backlight 6; Overscan on; Adaptive Contrast Off.Now in order to change the tint which was still off I used my onboard graphics card software: AMD Engine Vision Control Center.  Through this I changed the Hue to -6 and the Saturation to 99.  It was a very small adjustment but it took away some of the greenish tint that was left that I could not get out through the adjustments on the TV itself.  Useing the computer software I got an excellent picture.  Without it I felt the color to be somewhat lacking.Now my overall verdict.  Out of the box the picture quality to me was pretty poor. But not bad for $200.  After tweaking to both the TV adjustments and computer software the picture is actually quite good!  Very good in fact.  For $200 I can accept that.Now I have played several games on it already.  Skyrim, and Call of Duty Moderen Warfare 3, Need for Speed Shift being among them.  And I have to make this observation.  The contrast between black and white is very weak.  In almost all of the game settings I have to set the in-game brightness all the way up.  But that is okay.  I have watched several football games in HDTV as well as several HDTV movies as well and they are all very good quality and color.Also there is a slight twicker on this display I don't have on my other two HDTVs.  It is not quite annoying but almost.  Because of the low contrast between black and white, the inability to change the tint through HDMI settings on the TV itself, and this faint twicker, from the backlight I believe, I gave this TV a four out of five stars.  I only docked it one point because I already knew this was not going to be a top of the line TV because of the price.

I did not have high hopes for this TV but we're not videophiles or audiophiles so we decided to give it a try.Upon unpacking, I did not find a user manual.  EDIT: Found out later that it was misplaced; manual was indeed there!  I thought that was a big funny.  I figured I'd look up the manual online and on Haier's site I couldn't find the \"D\" model for their 32\" TV.  Interesting.Then I tried to attach the stand.  I think the stand that came with my Vizio 20\" TV is more sturdy than this thing, I thought as I started to attach the screws.  Unfortunately, two of the four screws just did not attach.  Two were great and sturdy, but the other two (upper ones I think) simply fall into the holes.  I noticed that 2 screws are longer and 2 are shorter, so I swapped them out.  No luck.  I tried my own screws and they also fell through.  I think the portion on the TV itself is stripped or something, it just does not hold the screw.  Very disappointing.As disappointed as I am, I'm not sure if I want to bother returning.  The mount still holds with 2 screws even if it wobbles a bit.  The TV itself works fine.  And I think my solution is going to be to just buy a wall mount, so here I am back on Amazon.The picture quality is \"meh\".  From any sort of side angle, the TV is very washed out.  Not a huge deal since it's in a corner in my bedroom.  The audio is fine for me.  The text and closed captioning is very crisp and looks much more readable than my old 22\" CRT it replaced.  Connections in the back are fine -- some here complained but it seemed typical to me.Overall I got what I paid for and then some.  Is it a good TV?  Meh, the quality seems mediocre.

I purchased it for $170 after applying my Amazon points.  Especially for the price, I am pleased so far.  I had read the reviews already posted here on Amazon and knew what to expect.  Here are my thoughts:ProsEasy to set up. Stand installed with 4 screws, plug it in, fire it up.  It quickly located my cable channels, although I had to turn it off and back on before I could navigate through the channels.Picture quality is very good for a 720p at this price point.  Nice and bright, vivid colors.I think the menus are easy to access, read, and navigate.Nice looking TV.  Definitely a major upgrade over the old-school CRT we had in our family room up until now.ConsSome parts feel a little cheap, but not to the point where its a big deal on a low priced TV.Sound problems have already appeared.  We had been watching a show from Hulu on our blu ray player and then popped in a DVD.  Immediately we noticed popping in the speakers and distorted sound, particularly on deep voices.  Anyone with a deep voice sounded like they were being interviewed on the news with intentional distortion to hide their identity.  Having read that others had experienced similar issues, I paused the movie and turned the TV off and back on.  The sound immediately sounded fantastic (I already adjusted the equalizer settings), with nice rich tones and no distortion.  As I sit here writing this about 25 minutes later it still sounds good, but obviously I hope this distortion/popping issue doesn't happen often...or get worse.  Honestly, at under $200, if I have to turn the TV off and then back on to clear the distortion on very rare occasions I can live with that.That's the story so far.  I'm happy with it.  For serious movie and sports viewing I will continue to use my 50-inch rear projection Sony in my mancave, but this TV will definitely serve it's purpose as the unit for my wife (who isn't picky about audio/picture quality) and daughter.UPDATE----After a few more days I can report that the popping/distorted sound problem has occurred two more times, both when using my blu ray player hooked in through an hdmi port (I don't know if that's relevant or not, but it has not happened at all when watching cable TV).  Both times I simply switched to a different input and then switched back to the blu ray and the problem went away.  So it is not a big deal, at least to me, although I may at some point invest in an a/v receiver and speaker system to get a better sound experience AND eliminate this issue.I can also report that blu ray movies look outstanding on this TV.  After a few days I am even happier with the TV than I was when I typed my initial review.UPDATE #2----After noticing that the sound distortion problem never occurred when I had my Xbox 360 hooked in to the other HDMI input, I checked out the audio settings on my blu ray player; I changed the HDMI audio output format from Auto to PCM and have had no sound problems since.UPDATE #3---- I can happily report that the TV is still working great.  We graduated to a 42\" screen for our living room, so this 32\" Haier is now in our bedroom.  The picture quality still impresses me for what was such a good bargain at the time of purchase.

I bought this tv when it was priced at $199, but I would not buy it at the current price of $316, there are much better tv's out there in the $300 range.  The low price is what prompted me to purchase considering it would be used in a bedroom.  The color is great and the picture is very clear.  The viewing angles are good as well and this tv has adequate number of ports.  The one thing that I do not like about the tv is the sound.  It has a very \"tinny\" sound.  The big, heavy CRT tv that I used before purchasing this LCD had a much better sound and is nearly 15 years old.  If you purchase I would recommend getting a soundbar or some other system to connect it to.  The sound was very frustrating to listen to.

It arrived well packaged within a few days and I plugged it up. Instantly worked with zero problems. As a monitor this screen is HUGE and I actually need to back away to let my eyes adjust. Watched a movie on it and the picture is great. I wasn't familiar with the Haier brand but my GF did some research and set my fears aside. A week into using my monitor and seeing it work she ordered one for herself. That right there speaks volumes, and I can honestly say this was a great purchase. No issues after 3 weeks of use and it is far cheaper than any other brand at this size with the exact same feature set.No its not 1080, but i don't think i need that to see the significant improvement over my monitor and even my TV screen. The remote is easy to operate, speakers are on par with any other set you would purchase, and the screen is plenty large enough to show two program screens at once. I use my computer on a producers desk and needed a large enough area to show two programs on one screen at once. I was looking to go bigger and add a second screen later.

I had heard of Haier before, but I had never owned any of their products. This was to be our turning point from the older \"tube\" TVs, so I wasn't expecting much for $200. After receiving it, I was so impressed with the bang for the buck that I ordered a second one this morning, though the price went up to $199. I will bite the $3 price increase (!) and enjoy the TV. To get the best picture, I had to mess around with it a bit, but I like to fiddle with stuff anyway. I have no complaints about the sound, though I pump it through my 7.2 surround sound system anyway. Since we are in Germany, it's nice that it is an auto-voltage and multi-system TV. I haven't tried playing games on it, but for DVDs and Blue-rays, it's great. Some people like the indicator light that is red when off and blue when on. I'm not a fan, but that's what electrical tape is for. Luckily, the light is in a spot where I can hide a little bit of tape. The documentation was not great, and the remote works well, though it looks quite dated and the buttons are difficult to distinguish in the dark. I was easily able to program my AV system's remote to work with it, so the included remote is irrelevant to me at this point. The picture actually seems to have gotten smoother and better in the week or so that I have owned it. I'm not sure if I'm just getting more used to it, it's burning in, or it is learning to upconvert my DVDs better, but whatever the case, it seems sharper and brighter than when I first tried it. I would highly recommend this TV for anyone who is budget-conscious or doesn't want to spend double on a 1080p screen. It should be good for a bedroom or even as a second monitor, with its computer input. It connected to my laptop's HDMI output flawlessly to play Blue-Rays. When you pull it out of the box, I would suggest playing around with the brightness, contrast, and color settings until you get them where you like them. The only input I have used is the HDMI through my AV receiver, so I cannot attest to the quality of the picture using other sources, although, other than my laptop, my other components use the regular old RWY cables to the receiver.

It is sitting within an Armoire and thus had the plastic stand attached to it.  The 4 screws included are 2 different lengths.  The shorter 2 screws go on top and the 2 longer screws on the bottom of the plastic stand.  I almost screwed into the frame of LCD panel, but stopped when I met resistance.  Any parent knows how difficult it is to RTFM (there is a manual that we don't normally read) when their children are excited, let alone a small herd of 8.  In this case the manual is incomplete in that it doesn't tell you that the screws are of different lengths.  The manual shows they are of the same length!Those people having trouble may be due to the longer screws going into the frame of the LCD.  It looked like it would do some major damage.For the picture itself, the screen picture is real nice and the color is ok.  The reviews for the sound are right on.

The TV does not slide into the stand, so I had no choice unless I wanted to lean it against the wall. Once hooked up and turned on the picture was mediocre at best for a High Def LCD TV. The real disappointment came when I turned up the volume. I have heard better sound out of the old speaker box that you hang on your window at the old Drive-In theatres. The surround sound was a joke. I had to turn the volume up fully to 100 and then it sounded like someone was talking into a bucket. The sound was dull and hollow. I tried to watch it but the sound was so bad I boxed it up and shipped it back 2 days later. The best part about buying this TV was Amazon.com's amazingly easy and fast return policy.

They said they would call back in a few days with a diagnosis. 5 days later they called saying Haier had the parts in back order and they still did not know what to was going to happen so they would call back. I called Haier again and they said they might send me a new TV but it would take up to 15 business days from the day they placed the order, but they had send a  request already to fix and they needed to wait for a resolution so they would call me back in a few days. The thing is there is only a 30 day money back warranty so... it's almost over and I have a broken TV sitting in my living room and no concrete answer from this company.

When I purchased it during a big Black Friday promotion in 2011, the online reviews were generally very positive on all attributes.  It didn't say it was the best product out there, but I was looking for something at a bargain to replace my 1980s hand-me-down television.  I just wanted a decent sized flat-screen that I could use to pick up local channels with an antenna and play DVDs.Upon receiving the television, I immediately had two very annoying issues.  While the picture was excellent, the sound was just miserable.  The reviews indicated the speakers were somewhat tinny, but I could manage that.  Unfortunately, no matter what preset I chose or custom adjustments I made on the audio settings, I could not get rid of the terrible crackling sound whenever it played a scene with low music or very quiet background.  I also attempted to remedy the situation with a variety of exterior speakers and sound systems but after three failed attempts, I gave up.It also failed miserably at picking up local channels.  I purchased a new antenna, hooked it up, and...nothing.  We fiddled with the antenna thinking maybe it was defective.  However, when we took the antenna downstairs and tried it on the other television, it worked just fine.  We then tried bringing in another antenna to try on this TV, but again, no luck.  Thinking it might be the location of the TV, we brought the other TV upstairs, hooked it up in the same spot with the new antenna and it worked brilliantly.  Apparently, the antenna hookup on this product is just as terrible as the sound quality.After a year of trying different tactics to resolve the sound and antenna problem, I'm finally replacing it with a reliable brand - Samsung.  I've purchased other Haier products before that performed perfectly (mini fridge, standing fan), but I will NEVER purchase another piece of media equipment from them.  The only reason I gave this product two stars is that the picture was really good, so I suppose a person with severe hearing loss might find it suitable for their needs.", "Date": "December 30, 2012"}, {"Title": "Hazier LCD HDTV 32\"", "Author": "DJS", "ReviewID": "R3FU3T9UK82MHO", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This TV was a great purchase.

This means that you must interact with Haier America, their North America branch of operations. This also means that there is no Haier electronics store to bring your TV to for repairs. Haier America customer service must have improved since the slew of \"black screens\" at the beginning of the calendar year, because, out of 7 phone calls, I managed to speak to a native English speaking human 5 times with an average hold time of 10 minutes. Each time, the representative was polite and professional and arranged for repair via a 3rd party repair company, or provided me with information about appointments. However, it is in these 3rd parties that service problems arise. The first 2 companies ditched 3 arranged appointments. Since appointment times were during the week \"between 9am and 5pm\", I missed 3 days or work for nothing. No repair, no income. The final company showed up on time and swapped out one of the boards. Since then, the TV has functioned normally (1 month, after 3 1/2 weeks of no-show appointments).This TV is meant to be accessorized. That is to say, it has 2 HDMI ports, VGA, headphone jack, coaxial, RCA, and HD component ports. Like most LCD TV's, this model has terrible, tinny sound. Use external speakers. Almost everyone has a sound system. If not, $30 computer speakers will suffice and are a good investment.As an 720p TV, it displays crisp images for HD movies and video games via my XBOX 360. Most HD movies are only 720p, and 1080p is utterly wasteful in anything smaller than 46-52in. So, the specs of this TV are perfect for its size.As an older LCD, viewing angles are not great. Anything more than 20-30 degrees off perpendicular is somewhat difficult to watch. Lighting in the room can also affect viewing very strongly. Callibrate appropriately to minimize these effects. Also, some dark scenes in movies and TV shows can be hard to see, regardless of adjustment (contrast).For $200, you can't get another 32in HD TV brand new. This TV is perfect for those with a budget and are not afraid to follow through with said budget. **Read the warranty** (last page of the User's Manual). Rather than spend another $300 for a \"good\" Korean, Japanese, or American brand, I'd rather spend that money on rent, food, unnecessary video games and accessories.", "Date": "September 1, 2012"}, {"Title": "Great TV/Extended monitor", "Author": "Samuel Park", "ReviewID": "R1LI4HULNYLBRH", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Great tv for price at approximately 200. Have had it 9plus months. Watched many DVD quality tv series and bluray 720p/1080movies.As reviews have mentioned the sound isnt great. It is okay for watching news etc but if you want to watch movies or want good built in sound this is not the TV to get unless you have some speaker set up. Aside from the weak sound system no complaints.Id give it a 5 star since it is exactly what I asked for, and I usually have it hooked to computer and its speakers so that isnt a problem.Good image quality, maybe could use a little color tweaking but not for the average user.Pros-Bargain price $200 for a 720p 32 inch late 2011(along with free shipping)-does what it should-easy plug and play HDMI and has VGA if you are trying to hook to a older systemcons (mostly related to sound)-sound is something a little better than might come from a typical laptop speaker (of course it can get much louder than the average laptop though)-when using the \"headphone out\" to connect to external speakers I need to turn it up very loud to get it to a relatively 'normal' volume, maybe the gain is set too low (this isnt a problem with HDMI/computer set up since you can just have the sound coming out of whatever speakers your computer uses)-Fixed tilt angle and fixed height setting (this may be normal for LCDTVs but this is the first one I bought so Im not sure)", "Date": "September 1, 2012"}, {"Title": "Great Value!", "Author": "D.

Heard a loud pop 3 days after setting it up, and it was dead.Contacted Amazon, for a return. It was fulfilled by Amazon, and the vendor would only ship the replacement set to my nephews address. This cost me delivery from his house which is why I am not sending this one back again. It will add up to half the cost or more of the original set. After setting up the replacement, I noticed it would occasionally say no signal when I turned it on. Moving the hdmi cable to the other hdmi port on the TV solved this. Now every one out of three times I have to move the hdmi from one hdmi port to another. Change the input settings. Had Comcast come and check the box to make sure that was not the problem.Changed HDMI cables with no change. Sound is truly horrible, but the picture does have nice pop. It is a TV in the bedroom, but I am going to give it away and replace it with a better set for maybe $30 to $50 more than the original price. Do 2 things, avoid this company, and buy directly from Amazon, not a fulfilled by Amazon. The vendor was nice, but insisted the TV go to my nephews which required him to ship it to me. This did not affect my rating of the TV, it still is a 0 star TV. Haier you should be ashamed , and you also Amazon for allowing this obvious crap to be sold.

So, first problem, dead batteries. Also, the remote buttons have a very spongy feel to the them that I don't like.Next step is to scan for stations. This must have taken 10-15 minutes. I'm not sure why so long, but it finally finished and I tuned to a channel. The audio is horrible. It sounds like an AM radio in a tin can.  I adjusted the equalizer which improved it a little. Boosting the volume level way doesn't help. All the sound is coming out the back of the TV. Second problem, in a standard house with background noise, the built-in audio is just not useable.But the real reason I got this TV, was because it has a headphone jack. My hope being that, finally, I could plug in external speakers and adjust the volume with the TV remote. Zilch. No sound out of the jack. Not through speakers or headphones. Third problem, headphone jack doesn't work and it doesn't even cut out the lousy, built-in sound when you plug something in.Three strikes and you're out.

At the time, the reviews on Amazon were almost all very postive.  It had a beautiful picture for a few days and then the TV never turned on again.  Even while it was working the sound was subpar but could be remedied with computer speakers.  I called Haier and was told somebody would call me back.  It's March and I am still waiting for that call.  I exchanged it for a new one from Amazon and the new haier lasted less then 24 hours.  Same problem, it would not turn on.  I sent it back to Amazon and bought a Vizio and haven't looked back.  Since my November purchase you will see that the Haier has accrued a lot of negative reviews, mostly with problems similar to mine.  Clearly, Haier cares not about the quality of the product they send.  With Amazon having to deal with so many of these returns it does make me wonder why they would deal with such a piece of trash.  Bottom line, if you like frustration then feel free to buy this TV.  And call their customer service.  And rinse and repeat when you get the replacement.  If your life is busy enough then do yourself a favor and buy something else.  Even an old black and white TV with rabbit ears would be better.

No power was getting to it at all.I know cause I tried different outlets and no red or blue lights(off and on lights)would come back on. That TV just died a quick death. Should I regret purchasing a little known brand TV-Haier-from Amazon.com because the price was great? So far-yes.I called Haier on Jan 13 to get it fix or replaced. I will say that they did call me back to let me know what the progress was as I went thru the waiting game. By Jan 22,I got a call saying they would exchange the TV for another because replacement parts would take 41 days to recieve. They sent me a label to send it back thru FEDEX. I took it to a FEDEX place on Jan 26 and waited for awhile. They said it would take 7 to 14 days.So on Feb 17,when I hadn't recieved anything,I called Haier. After being left on hold for 5 min or so,a lady explained to me they got the TV on Jan 27,processed it on Feb 2,then everything stopped-no explanation. Told me it was a good thing I called them!

He also said that they lost the TV I sent back. He said they would send the replacement TV out that day. It takes 7 to 15 days to arrive so we're going into March now.

At the time, this was selling for $200, and I had to jump on it. Just under a month later, I returned it for the $300 LG LG 32LK330 32-Inch 720p 60 Hz LCD HDTV, which was one of the better product-related decisions I've ever made.Why the dissatisfaction? The sound quality was one of the main reasons. It seemed to vary between being tinny at best, and unusable at worst, full of echoes and just sounding awful. I tried hooking it up to my old computer speakers, and as others have mentioned, you have to mute the TV to stop the terrible sound from coming through its speakers, and the TV unmutes itself every time you turn it off and on. A minor inconvenience, I know, but the frustration adds up, especially in a bigger purchase like a TV. I know that \"you can't expect decent sound quality from a TV at this price range,\" but the LG, for instance, does just that. Not powerful enough to blow a woman's clothes off, as the saying goes, but I've been using it for 2 months now without the computer speakers and have been quite pleased.Picture quality looked great to me, but I had only my old, crappy 22\" to compare it to, which was so blurry you couldn't read on-screen text in a video game, so that's not much of a comparison.Overall, it just felt... cheap. I wanted something that would last for a while, and I just didn't trust it to do that.Especially now that the price has gone back up, there's really no reason to get this when you can get the aforementioned LG, or this Panasonic Panasonic VIERA TC-L32C3 32-Inch 720p LCD HDTV, or this Philips Philips 32PFL3506/F7 32-inch 720p LCD HDTV, Black, for a few dollar more.", "Date": "February 17, 2012"}, {"Title": "Great for the money", "Author": "truelluzions", "ReviewID": "R1RW7JNEH9KG2E", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Shopped around for awhile and found the Haier.

The video quality has actually exceeded my expectations, while the only downside I've noticed is that the audio sounds a bit tinny and lackluster. The remote is not over-sized and seems quite nice.My greatest concern when purchasing my new TV was avoiding that annoying tint when viewing at an angle. Fortunately, I haven't noticed this issue in the slightest with the Haier. My primary use for this TV has been playing my 360 and watching shows/movies from Netflix. The video quality has been truly vibrant and crisp, especially when using an HDMI cable. The Haier is also VESA mount-compliant. With the wall mount, you really gain a nice amount of space in even small rooms.So far, my main gripe is with the audio quality. It seems as if the bass is barely present, and adjusting the audio settings doesn't seem to remedy the tinny sound (i.e., it sounds as if the sound is playing through a tin can or something). However, it isn't too big a deal in my case, as I often use my Tritton AX 180s while gaming, and even while watching Netflix. If I grab the Ear Force DSS, it'd be even less of an issue. For anyone who has their own sound system, the issue is obviously nullified. I've also read other reviews which praise the Haier's sound quality, so it may be that my unit has some slight defects. Now, I wouldn't usually expect much out of stock speakers for an LCD HDTV, but when watching TV or playing games on my cousin's Olevia, the sound is actually very impressive (to be fair, though, it's larger and thicker, so is able to accommodate larger speakers).The remote has a sleek, black plastic casing, the only drawback of which is the absorption of fingerprints. The interface is also simple enough for pretty much anyone, and I found the buttons to be a comfortable size; I dislike the controllers with the tiny, horizontally shaped buttons.Overall, I'm very pleased with the purchase. The video quality more than makes up for the audio issues for me.As a side note, my TV seemed to be packed quite well; although the box seemed to have taken a beating, the TV was unscathed (I only add this as I don't if there's much variation in how well sellers package their TVs/monitors).", "Date": "January 5, 2012"}, {"Title": "Mostly satisfied", "Author": "jillio26", "ReviewID": "R1WV4V0TSA6JZY", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "This is my first T.V. purchase so I'm no expert.

A week passed and no response from the e-mail. After another week I resent the e-mail and they just stated \"Yes, we received your e-mail.\" Nothing about the new remote, so we called again and was told remotes were on backorder. We asked when it was coming in and was told they would have to call us back; that was 2 weeks ago. We did ask about just getting reimbursed for a universal remote, but they wouldn't. We tried a universal remote we already had for another tv, but no codes work. We have tried codes people have tried with this same tv, cable codes, etc. All in all we have tried about 50 different codes with 2 different remotes (our cable remote and a universal remote). SO, since this tv is for our bedroom, we find we are not watching it because upon getting sleepy we have to get out of bed to manually turn off the tv, plus you cannot access a sleep timer (if there is one) through the buttons on the tv. Lazy I know, but we shouldn't have to adjust for something we paid money for. And, the Haier company is terrible about getting us a remote that works for this tv.

The video is fairly decent for this lcd television.  Not great but pretty good for the price.  Audio is another story.  It is plain awful.  It will do the job for a very small room and for those that really do not care about sound.  But if you care, even the slightest, this unit is not for you.  It has the classic down/back firing speakers which automatically make most LCD tvs sound muffled/odd .... but this model has just plain tinney/weak sound regardless which settings you fool with.  Now, take this from someone who finds audio to be as important as sound when viewing content, so this may prove just fine for many people.The thing that really makes this unit bad regarding sound is when you try to use it with a soundbar (with audio from the tv driving the soundbar's sound).  I cannot speak for the model (in general) but the one I received would not mute the sound to the headphone jack when MUTE was pressed on the remote (or a programmed harmony remote).  Why is this important?  It's the only audio out on the tv at all ... no audio out jack or other audio pass-through jack ... you must use the headphone jack to get sound to a soundbar and the MUTE on the tv will not MUTE the output to the headphone jack.  To make things worse, in fact, when a headphone or cable IS plugged into the headphone jack, the tv will not mute the sound automatically (as you would normally expect when something is plugged into the headphone jack).  Think about it, when you plug in a headphone or cable into almost any electronic device's headphone port, the unit directs all sound to the headphone/cable, essentially muting all other sound outputs.  Right?  Well, not on this tv.  There are no controls in the menu to fix this so I assume this is a flaw or defective unit.  Not sure which.So, I give it 4 stars for picture (for the price, that is) and the overall price but only 1 star for the sound, giving it a 2.x score rounded up to a 3 star rating.", "Date": "December 28, 2011"}, {"Title": "One Fine TV", "Author": "Charles S.

What I didn't expect is that both nights we've used it, the picture has disappeared. This is on a composite input, but not sure it matters. I can get it to come back but cycling through the inputs using the buttons on the TV itself, powering it off and back on. Or maybe it's just turning it off and back on a number of times that makes it work.I read some other people have been able to solve the problem by holding the power button until the picture comes back, but that has not worked for us.

I spent two weeks trying to adjust the settings, but just couldn't get over the horrible picture quality.

Lopez \"Big Vee\"", "ReviewID": "R3U3JYLV0E3QBX", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I ordered this LCD TV for several reasons. First, I wanted to upgrade from the 27 inch flat screen Olevio I bought 5 years ago.  I recently moved and needed a larger screen to fit my living room so a 32 inch monitor will be perfect & not the focal point of the room; Secondly, I saw this item in stores and the picture quality was top notch for its price range(non-scientific comparison to other showroom models);  So I missed the black Friday & cyber Monday events but was able to catch this monitor for $249.  It came to  $280 after tax/s&h.; The price sealed the deal;When it arrived, from Amazon.com, I plugged it into Verizon Fios cable box; I entered remote control code 186 and the t.v. and cable with remote were set up and done.  Took all of 15  min from box to table to watching t.v. :)Pros:  The picture quality is excellent for the price range; 100x better than the old flat screen by Olevio.  I didn't have to adjust the image at all; vibrant colors, sports look great=no blur or shadowing or pix-elation.  No glare on the screen from sunlight either; can be viewed from 179 degrees from left to right.  So placement or seating angle is not an issue.  Screen is not a 32 inch on a diagonal measurement but, (more like 31 inches) but hey... the price can't be beaten. The monitors border is done in black gloss, makes for a nice touch (not the usual dull black plastic).  And the stand took a whole minute to connect.  Two short screws & two long ones. The monitor is very light, one person can carry it from room to room without assistance.  Imagine trying to carry one of those old 32 inch CRT tvs by your lonesome.Con:  Only 1 downside to this t.v. and that is (like everyone else noted) the audio quality is poor; speakers are mounted at the rear so the sound projects back and away from the viewer.  The best sound should surround you.  These speakers emit a metallic sound like someone is talking through an open can of soup with a string attached to it (lol);The Fix:  As with many newer televisions entering the marketplace, the expectation is that you/me/the consumer will purchase a 2.1 or 5.1 or 7.1 speaker system; Creative labs makes some great sub $50 speaker packages... the 2.1 models are great, I have owned 1 and it is connected to my p.c. and it kicks buttowsky!  Ordered another for this t.v.  and it will rock; Total cost with the new speakers will be about $300 but I still come out on top when you compare the price for a 32 inch monitor w/o creative labs speakers w/sub-woofer :)Addendum: I've been running this monitor for 4 days, not one problem; was able to adjust audio to get a great sound from the 7 watt speakers by increasing the base and reducing the treble; also, sounds even better when I hooked up HDMI cable to Digital Cable box which does a better job with the sound than the component cables; moreover, after doing research, I checked my product model number and noticed a sticker on the back.  My model is a newer one ending with the letter (a) L32D1120a; some of the reviewers may have purchased the earlier model, which may have been plagued with issues;  Moreover, all channels seem to be running on 1080i and not on 720p. :) Image is perfect when viewed beyond 4 feet; not really a good monitor to use at a desk as there are shadows on images viewed inside the 4 foot distance.

The pricing on this went up and down quite a lot of times, but I was lucky to get it when it was under $200. But even at the current price ($249), it is still a damn good deal!Setup: (4.5/5)Easy as it gets. You don't need any training for setting this TV up. It took me 5 minutes to screw on the base (4 screws, need a Phillips head screwdriver), put it on my TV stand, power it on and connect the HDMI port to my PS3. I'd imagine it would take a bit more time to mount it on the wall, but since I didn't need to, I can't comment on that. Right now, I have it connected to my PS3 (HDMI), Roku (HDMI), RCA Basic Indoor Antenna (Cable), and occasionally, my laptop (VGA). The placement of the ports is a little weird, in the sens that they are not where they normally are on TVs. They are placed under a recess pointing downwards, which is a little tricky to use sometimes, but since I just connected all my cables in the beginning before pushing the TV stand up against the wall, all I had to do was connect the other ends to their respective devices. But I can see that being a problem for some people.Picture Quality: (5/5)In short, it is great. Like other reviewers have said, it shows up as 1080p, and yes, it sure does. Although not always. The PS3 menu always shows up in 1080p, but the games run at 720p, even though I know they support 1080p. That might be because of some setting I haven't used, so I'm not entirely sure about that. My Roku is 720p only. But the antenna gets some digital channels, and I was watching NBC at 1080i, according to the broadcast. So, the resolution is here and there, but overall, the picture quality is awesome. All colors are reproduced very faithfully, and blacks are especially awesome. You can play around with the settings to get your perfect match, but it was working just fine for me out of the box.Sound: (3/5)The sound is adequate on this one. Its not too loud, and it certainly wouldn't be enough to fuel a party. But I have it hooked up to my Bose 2.1, so I don't really use the TV's speakers in any case. Still, this is a review, so I would have to say the sound is not up to the mark. I would suggest to invest in some good external speakers unless you plan to use it as a bedroom TV or for kids.Value for money: (5/5)Again, I got this for $198, and that is why, even with the bad sound and iffy port placement, I would give this a 5 overall.

Upon setting it up I was extremely happy with everything.

For example, if I am using Composite 1, it will randomly switch to Composite 2.  Sometimes it doesn't happen at all, sometimes it happens once every 20 minutes, or sometimes it seems to happen once every few minutes.  This happens no matter what input the TV is on.  It is completely random and I can't figure out how to fix it.I have tried covering the sensor on the TV, thinking maybe there was interference from lights or another electronic device but it still switched to the next input.

I will probably have to add some additional speakers which seems to defeat the purpose of getting an inexpensive tv.12/26 update: I had the cable company double check and they verify the connections are good and even replaced the cable box so the only remaining piece of equipment is the TV.  I have requested a replacement from Amazon.  Will update when the new item arrives and I will confirm that I had a defective tv or that the sound really is that bad.12/31 amazon return was quick and easy but the replacement tv had the exact same sound so clearly this is not a defect but a design flaw.  The equalizer setting does not help as the lowest sound range doesn't respond (I think the onboard speakers simply cannot produce sound sub 150htz which makes for the tinny sound.  Another problem is that the power for the speakers is very low.  I had the cable box set to maximum so the signal getting to the tv would be stronger but the volume is still quite weak and, when played at normal volume, produces a background distortion. If you have ever turned up an amp very high with nothing playing, you will have heard the kind of background hum and crackle that this tv produces.I added satellite speakers and plugged them into the cable box and this resolved the issue: the volume and sound were fine run outside the tv.  This of course is not a good solution as my satellite system does not have a remote control but it does clearly show the problem is in the tv, not external.  So it isn't possible to avoid the bad sound unless you buy a satellite sound system with a remote at which point you would have negated the one advantage of this tv which is low price.", "Date": "December 19, 2011"}, {"Title": "NO MANUAL VERTICAL PICTURE CONTROL", "Author": "Bohica \"Bohica\"", "ReviewID": "R1FKCFTO8RSLUW", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "This Haier L32D1120 32\" TV replaced a smaller Visio TV.

I did a remodel addtion on the house. Everthing ended up in the garage. 2 yrs latter I finaly got around to cleaning it out. I have DTV in the house and in the garage. I have a Tivo DTV reciver out in the garage. I had a 16 inch sonicview tv. So i decided to get a bigger tv for out there with more room to move around now. I looked all over and i do mean everywhere. I saw this one and gave it a try. I got it fast and in great shape. I already had a wall mount(peerless LMAM1940) so i didnt need to look for one. I had to use the extra brackets cause it's not a standard mounting size.  Now as far as the tv goes i am very happy with it. I used 2 HDMI cabels on it.1) DTV Tivo duel tunner2) Blu-ray player (Panasonic)  It has good color and i found you can adjust each option to differt settings. Although I havent had to adjust much from factory settings. I am happy enough with the sound. I found  the codes for the peanut remote for the tivo so I only have to use 1 remoite. I have read where people say its tinny, but what would one expect for a tv. I tried the head phone jack and it gave me very good sound. When I used the head phones i noticed that when lowering the volume it stayed muted, but when I riased the volume it takes the mute off. The differnt in size between 16 inch and 32 is so much, everyone looks at it and say wow nice big tv.  As for what else I have so you know I have some knowledge about this.1)52 inch Sharp, HDRV DTV, Panasonic blu-ray, Panasonic DMR-EH57, Sony tunner for suround sound (5.1)Energy speakers2)32 inch Sharp(AQUOS), DTV Tivo, Panasonic DMR-E100H, wall mount(peerless LMAM1940)3)40 inch Samsung, HDVR DTV, Panasonic DMR-E100H, Sony 400dvd player, wall mounted(peerless LMAM1940)4)21 inch Samsung(touch of color),DTV mirrowed, wall mounted5)21 inch Samsung(touch of color), HD DTV, Panasonic Blu-rayI did all the work myself on everthing I have here, so I kinda of know what I am doing when it comes to tv's and what it takes to have good pic and sound. I have run this tv for days on end(sometimes 24-48 hours straight) and not had any trouble with it at all. I did find out that is you want to use a USB stick to watch a movie it does not suport it. I use my bly-ray player if I want todo that. If you are looking for a good tv for a nice price, I would grab one of these. I dont gives many reviews, so that might tell you how much i think of this tv. I hope i help someone thinking of getting this tv.

What you'll get at most, would be a low mid-range and most high range frequencies, and a very poor, if not to say, no low range frequency (a.k.a. bass) at all!Fortunately, I anticipated that problem and had bought a simple but powerful set of speakers with a subwoofer before, and I just plugged them to the headphone plug of the TV, which brought me a very rich sound quality (full coverage of low range, mid range and high range frequencies).Overall, you really get something for what you pay, and add just another $48 extra bucks for a set of \"Eagle Tech ET-AR504LR-BK 2.1 Soundstage Speakers with Subwoofer\" or another set of speakers you trust, and you'll be set!I would recommend this product for those with low budgets at the moment!UPDATE 12/16/2011:I just wanted to add that now that I'm plugging it everyday to my laptop, it actually displays my image in a resolution of 1920 x 1080, most commonly known as a 1080p resolution... the image is so crystal clear that I can even work my photos in Adobe Lightroom using this TV!

I've read that the sound is crystal clear right out of the box. While this is true, there's almost no bass whatsoever so it's a crystal clear crispness that's lacking in the power department. Even at higher volumes there's no bass, and there's no option to bass boost or tweak the sound to give you more. Also, the casing seems a little cheap, it's a little thicker/hollower than most, and I'm sure a small drop would crack it pretty good.Everything seems to be working fine after a few weeks. Although, I tried plugging my roommates surround sound into the audio cables (simple red and white) and that doesn't work for some reason, not sure why. The picture's great, and I use a simple HDMI cable to hook up to my laptop and I can stream or watch files of 720p movies and they look great up on the screen. Again, great value if you can pick it up for under $200.", "Date": "December 15, 2011"}, {"Title": "SUPER EXCITED!", "Author": "MANDY2022", "ReviewID": "R2KLXCFIAZGJHT", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I got this TV at such a GREAT price I was afraid that the quality may not be up to par.

Upon powering on, the colors are sharp, but a little more red tone.  Very very little, it can be quickly adjust.  I tested it by connecting to HD cable channels and regular TV antenna.  I am please with the result.  However, for some reason, it doesn't pick up channel 7, ABC channel when I used the antenna.  I am not sure if it is the TV or antenna.  My other TV which is only 15 feet away, it can detect chancel 7 without any problem.  (Note: in both case, I was using the same indoor antenna.)It is a very simple feature TV, which is ok.  Only complains are the remote control material quality.  It seems like it uses cheaper plastic, not as durable as I should be.  However, the software and layout of the remote control is ok.  Very simple and easy to use.The other comment I have is the cable connection placement.  It is on or face the bottom .  There is good and bad to it.  The good is that you need short cable and it fit the cable direction, which usually from under the table or from floor.  Then, the cable doesn't need to bend 90 degree.

You can turn up the volume and hear the audio fine, but it sounds flat.What led me to return the product was a loud audible buzz or hum that would emanate from the set when I plugged in a composite device. It didn't appear to be coming from the speakers, rather the set itself. The buzz would continue even when the volume was muted.Let the number of Amazon Warehouse used units give you pause before you purchase this off-brand set.

I've seen better, but this is 720, you can't expect the quality of a 1080 LG.  For our purposes, the picture quality is fine and we are happy enough with it.  It is noticably odd up close.  Stand 4-5 feet away and it's fine.The sound quality though, ugh!  Tinny sounding, voices sound weird on regular network TV, it's not like we were expecting a theater experience but for regular everyday TV viewing the voices sounded so weird that we tried to buy a soundbar to fix how terrible it sounded.  It was just not watchable.  We have two other LCD tvs, we know that the sound isn't always great but I've never heard one this bad.  Design flaw 1.Picked up a soundbar, only to learn there is no audio out, only a headphone port.  Design flaw 2, but luckily we have a cable that can do headphone to a soundbar that we just happened to have at home.Design flaw 3- The TV speakers don't mute automatically with a headphone plugged in.  Who uses headphones and expects the whole room to still use it?  Seriously, it's dumb.  So you must mute manually leaving a mute symbol in the upper right corner that doesn't go away quickly.  TO make it go away faster, press display twice.  Turning the sound down affects what goes to the \"headphone\", so turning it all the way down means no sound.  To make the soundbar work correctly, your best bet is to turn the TV volume almost all the way up.Then when you turn the TV off and on again, the TV speakers roar back to life and scare the bejesus out of you.  ITS SO LOUD!  So each time you turn on the TV, you'll have way too loud sound, then hit mute, then hit display twice and then and only then is your TV watchable.  Personally, not willing to do all this every time.  Especially considering the soundbar blocked the remote reciever, so you had to go stand right next to it for your eardrum assault.In the process of returning.  I really, geniunely never thought I'd be the type of person to leave an angry 1 star review.

The speakers sound like they are literally a tin can though, but I knew that going into the purchase. For the bedroom the sound is fine since I don't have it up that loud anyway. You really only notice the \"tinney\" sound at a higher volume. Purchasing a separate set of speakers would fix this problem. Though it's really not that big a deal to me. I have Directv and many of the HD channels will automatically upgrade to 1080. I love this! And Directv has the codes to program your remote too. Setup was a breeze and the remote was operational in minutes. For the average viewer you will never notice a difference in resolution between the 720 and the 1080. Seriously, you would have to break out a magnifying glass to notice the difference. All in all you can't go wrong with this purchase.**Update** It's now been two weeks since I purchased this TV.

This makes it unable to connect directly to a soundbar or stereo receiver for the best sound quallity. You will have to go through the headphone jack, but the quality won't be good that way.3. I'm not a fan of the stand for the tv. Most televisions that I've seen make it possible to slip the tv on and off of it for easy removal. With this tv you have to attach the stand to the back of it with 4 screws.I would give this tv 5 stars if it had better audio quality and audio features.

More than likely I'll just pick up a surround system to add on since the TV has the connections on the back to add the sound system for those that want to add one. I strongly suggest making this purchase as an extra TV for your bedroom or den because it's a perfect size for an intimate setting and is so easy to set up.

The TV tunes the HD signal and produces a picture that is very good to excellent, as good as my recently purchased 26\" VIZIO.

Unfortunately there was a problem with that: the sound only worked good when the input into the TV was through HDMI.  If we used any other input (composite cables, RCA cables) then the sound through the receiver had severe static.  So, figuring this was a defective TV, we returned that one and Amazon sent us another.  However the second TV had the exact same problem.  Haier customer service did say they could send a repair tech out to check the TV, but that just seemed too much of a hassle.

All TV's are hooked up to antenna. The Haier has the noticeably worst picture. Grainy and the pixels are noticeable. Not terrible, but not optimal either.-  You cannot use independent sound input with HDMI inputs. The sound must come through the HDMI. This was a bit problematic on the playroom HTPC which used separate audio. I had to reconfigure the sound channel to carry over HDMI.- The audio is bad, even for an LCD/Plasma. Hollow and distant. Fine for a playroom TV, though.- The Tuner isn't great. On the same antenna, my Vizio pulls in more channels and has greater strength on them. In the playroom, the HTPC does the tuning, so another reason to switch.- The OSD menus are good. Pretty intuitive and easy to navigate.- Can't beat the price- The remote is good, but comes with \"heavy duty\" batteries.

The Haier is setup in an armoir so this may help reflect the sound better in the enlosed bedroom.

I did mess with contrast, sharpness, brightness etc. and it helped to some degree.2) Sound is what one could expect from a $200 set. No rich base, kind of tinny, but definitely tolerable. Although, when changing channels I noticed an audible clicking sound coming from the speakers. It didn't really bother me, but drove my wife nuts.I did attempt to hook it up to my home theater and here is where things really got off track.  The only audio out on this TV is the headphone jack. Here are the steps I followed to hook it up to my home theater:Step 1, Get a cable that converts from mini-jack to standard left/right composite(RCA plugs). Notice that plugging the cable into the headphone jack of the TV doesn't mute the speakers.Step 2: Mute TV speakers.  Turn on the home theater system and notice that I have to have the sound cranked through the home theater system to hear the sound from the TV when the TV's volume is set to \"normal\" listening levels (but is currently muted).Step 3: Un-mute the TV and turn up the sound to a level that makes your ears hurt, then re-mute the TV.  Now the sound comes through nice and clear on the home theater system.Step 4: Turn everything off (TV & home theater system).Step 5: Turn TV back on a while later.Step 6: Change your underwear when the TV's now un-muted (this is reset when you turn off the tv) sound kicks in and scares the crap out of you.You may also have this same experience if you ever hook your MP3 player up to your stereo system at home (or in your car).

Next hurdle for me was to figure out which port was for the antenna (indoor). I ended up calling customer service, but they couldn't tell from the manual either where the antenna went. I decided to read the set-up guide ONE MORE TIME, a little more closely and figured it out. After that setting up my channels was a cinch. I was very surprised at the \"Look\" of the images. Pop out at me. When watching one of the old black and white movies I noticed the characters in the front of the screen were crisp and clear while those in the background were fuzzier. This seems to be true of many of the other color presentations, too, so must be the 3D feature that emphasizes the main focal point and leaves the rest a bit blurry.The volume seems to be working okay. I had read about other brands whose volume was not controllable, but only very loud; however this Haier seems controllable. Also I was told I'd have to get adjusted to the brightness in my bedroom caused by the larger screen size, however I didn't find that a problem, either. So far, so good. Only negative is that screw issue and the customer service not knowing where the antenna cord went. Especially happy with the fast delivery of this one item.

Since I typically don't watch much television, this unit has more than served its purpose.  The setup was simple, the picture is clean, and the sound is sufficient.  I haven't had any problems at all with the set, and because of the HD, I've started to watch more programming, especially the NBA.After several weeks, I was so satisfied with the tv that I ordered a second one as a gift for my mother.  Right out of the box, the tv's remote wasn't operational, but the tv itself seemed to work just fine.Thinking that a replacement remote might do the trick, I contacted Amazon and received one free of charge within a week.  Since the replacement remote also didn't control the tv, I suggested that my mother take the set to a repair shop.  Upon learning that the set had a damaged motherboard (or something to that effect--the repairman indicated that the cost of the repair wouldn't be worth the expense), I contacted Amazon about the problem.Within 10 days, my mother received a brand-new television to replace the damaged one, including free shipping of the damaged unit back to Amazon. The replacement tv has operated without incident, and my mother loves the clear picture, vivid colors, and booming sound (she is \"hard of hearing\").  A working remote is particularly helpful for those times when we tell her to lower the volume.  :)With that kind of first-rate customer service, there's no reason not to take a chance on what many might consider an \"off-brand\" tv made in China.In a nutshell, because of this experience, I will make all of my electronics purchases from Amazon in the future.

The purchase was for our children's room which would only be hooked up to a DVD player to be used when we had guests over.  Out of the box, I got it mounted on my wall and realized the RCA component jacks on the side of the TV was not working.  I verified with my other TV to ensure that the problem wasn't with my 5 year old DVD player or with the cables, and found it was the TV.  I called customer service and they told me a technician would have to call me.  Then I tried connecting the RCA component jacks found in the rear of the TV to the DVD player and found success!I could overlook the defective side component jacks on the basis of the TV being really cheap and that I would only be using the TV to view DVD movies.  However, on the same day, the input button on the other side of the TV (which also had other buttons like power, volume, channel) stopped working.  In fact, the button worked for me TWICE and just quit working.  \"Wow, talk about cheap\" was all I could think of about this TV, but again told myself that as long as the picture and sound worked with my DVD player, it was still worth the $200 bucks I paid.  Well a week later, we had some guests over and I popped in a movie in the DVD player.  After 20 minutes of viewing, the kids were complaining that the image had gone black.  I went to investigate and found that it was on the wrong input.  At first I thought one of the kids might've hit the input button on the remote, but the remote was on top of the bookshelf where I had left it, untouched.  \"Weird,\" I thought.  Then another 15 minutes later, the same complaint arose!  Again the TV jumped to the next input and so this time I sat there with the kids watching the movie, and sure enough, after 10 minutes of viewing, the input switched again!  By then the kids gave up on the TV and left the room to play, and I knew I had to return the unit back to Amazon.  The question was though, do I get a replacement Haier TV or a refund?It was 3 weeks since I made that first phone call to Haier, and no technician ever called me back.  Since then, I tested the TV again on 2 different occasions, and once it played a full movie without the input issues while another time, the input problem arose again after 30 minutes.  I went back to Amazon to read the slew of new reviews, many negative, and wondered if I'd be gambling to request a Haier replacement, since many of the issues with the TV sounded worse than what I went through.  And being the fact that I rarely used the TV (it's only when we have guests over), can I take the chance that the TV will work for me after long periods of time (especially since Amazon's 30 day policy will have expired)?  At the end I decided to return it for a refund and opted to pay an extra hundred bucks to upgrade to a Sony BRAVIA KDL32BX320 32-Inch 720p LCD from Amazon.  And what a difference between the two LCDs!  Both the picture and the sound from the Sony was a huge improvement over the Haier (I played the same movie on both TVs as a comparison).  And everything was working, as it should.  No compromises on the Sony!

They are wall mounted in each of my two son's rooms.  The tvs arrived very quickly.  Got them set up very quickly.  The picture on the tvs are very nice.  I cannot see a difference in the 720 in these vs the 1080 that I have in my living room.  Perhaps that is due to the size.  Please note that I do have HD programming and most channels are watched on those HD channels. Occassionally I will see that the boys don't have an hd channel on and the picture still is nice.  Not as crisp as the HD but still very viewable with no complaints.  I do not have these on the table mounts that come with so I cannot comment on those. I will say that if you wall mount these you will have to find screws that work. That was the only issue (especially when you are impatient and setting up at night when hardware stores are closed!).  The screws that come with the tv are for the stand mount and are about 1/2\" too long for using with a wall mount.  What we wound up doing was actually cutting the screws that came with so that they would fit in the back of the tv with the wall mount.  This worked perfectly.  Sound is very good.  The connection locations are mostly facing downward on the back.  I cannot see this being a problem with stand mount as it looks like there is plenty of room for both.  The front of the tv comes down about 3\" past these input points so there is also plenty of room to hide the wires through the wall if wall mounting.

Granted, for the price I didn't expect much. I had also reviewed previous reviews and knew that I might want to add speakers due to their poor speaker quality- I did and it helped the sound immensely. Unfortunately, within a week of setting up the TV, I started having problems with the signals getting back and forth between the TV and cable box. I had to reboot the cable box once to twice a day. Many times I had to call the cable company for assist with the reboot only to find that the TV had overloaded the box and the signals were not acknowledged. Yep.. another box bites the dust! For months, the cable company would come and exchange boxes, check signals, etc. Finally, they replaced ALL the cable from the street side pole to my house. To be doubly sure, they even replaced all the inside cables- an easy feat as my house is one floor and can be accessed from below. Once done, they gave me a brand new high speed cable box and crossed their fingers. Finally, the box worked and the TV FINALLY displayed the errors behind the mess, which were: 'HDCP Authorization Failure' and 'HDMI Port Disabled'.. the TV was bad all along.I called HAIER on 4/11/12, there started my lengthy relationship with them. To make a long story short, they sent a replacement TV and the same problem occurred. It took me FIVE months to get my money refunded LESS a 10% user fee... not that I got to use the TV. I would never buy a HAIER TV but have no complaints about the little HAIR refrigerator or window A/C's I've owned.", "Date": "May 4, 2012"}, {"Title": "Haier TV - Complete junk & awful customer service", "Author": "Ursula", "ReviewID": "R1FI5QPORGTLWO", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "Shoppers Beware - Never-ever buy Haier's junk! Gave it one star only because you can't give zero.  Purchased this TV in November 2011. It died February 1, 2012 after about 20 hours of total use. Unfortunately, found out on the web that I will have plenty of company.  Called Haier customer dis-service and was first told they will arrange for technician to service in-home. After 2 weeks and no call from technician, called back and this time told that TV will be replaced. Another 2 weeks and no TV called again and was told part are now available and will send to house and technician would call. Parts arrived, technician called and came to house. Surprise! - Wrong parts. More waiting and at least 12 more phone calls over second month with no TV and finally got agreement to have TV picked-up and replaced. After 3 days and no pick-up called again and customer dis-service could not locate record of pick-up order. 2 days later pick-up was made and new TV was supposed to be sent out immediately upon pickup. That was 2 weeks ago. Called customer dis-service and they could not locate shipping record for replacement TV. Promised to call me back next day. No call after 3 days. Called again and was promised that TV will ship today. Told them I'll call back for tracking number tomorrow. Called back after 2 days and was told TV did not ship becuase they have to send an upgraded model and they needed my permission.  They told me model number and interestingly - sounds like the one I orginially bought.  Maybe the upgrade is that this one will actually work.  Promised that new TV would ship within 2 days.  Will call them back for the tracking number but not holding my breath that these liars will actually manage to get it shipped. Nearly 3 months now and still no TV. These people are crooks!  I will be reporting this entire incident to the FTC and New York State Attorney General and encourage others who experience this company's useless products and service to do the same.

The set does not get a lot of use so I thought I would wait until closer to the Holidays and look for a deal.  I came across this Haier set on Amazon's site for $197.00 so I thought why wait.  I didn't need a lot of features just a 32\" set with a decent picture.  The reviews seemed to be positive so I ordered the set and received it in 2 days.  Unfortunately the set arrived DOA.  The stand by light (red) and power light (blue) worked but nothing else.  No picture and no sound.  I called the Haier toll free number and spoke to customer service, Adam, to see if there was anything that I was missing in the set up.  He said normally he would tell me to unplug the set for an half of hour to reset it but since the set never operated that would probably not work.  Adam was a great customer service rep and said he could arrange an in home repair appointment with the locally apprtoved repair service.  Since I was replacing a TV with a bad power board I opted not to have it repaired and contacted Amazon for a replacement.  The replacement process on Amazon's website was fast and painless.  I am hoping that when I receive the replacement TV it will live up to the reviews.  The only reason I am giving this product 1 star and not zero at this time is because of the great treatment that I received from Haier's customer service and the ease of arranging replacement with Amazon.  Once I receive the replacement TV I will readjust my rating.
