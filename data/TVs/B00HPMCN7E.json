{"Reviews": [{"Title": "GREAT QUALITY FOR AN EDGE-LIT", "Author": "Joe Phil", "ReviewID": "R2771HM7CHLE8", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "First I would like to start by saying THIS ITEM JUST GOT A PRICE DROP.Second, IGNORE THE 1STAR REVIEWS. They were made by immature people who do not own the TV and just lowered the ratings!Now this is an initial thought and opinion review. Keep in mind that this set is EDGE-LIT and does not offer local dimming. With that aside there is very minimal edge \"clouding\" but, picture quality is flawless! Blacks are true and colors are vivid with the presets. You will however, definitely get the most out of it if you do some slight advanced picture tinkering. The new wedge shape allows for better speaker placement so sound is very crisp and clear, just as with the picture, it is best to tinker a bit with the audio settings to find what best suits you.CONS: The remote needs some getting used to. It doesnt have a MENU button and some settings are hidden. Using the options button pops a number of settings on the side of the TV but not the full package(if that makes sense). To get your complete settings you need to press the HOME button which will take you to Sony's PS4 style interface and scroll to the settings tab3D is okay at bestMY TOTAL RATING-3.8 out of 5", "Date": "April 7, 2014"}, {"Title": "I am a bit underwhelmed after owning it's predecessor.", "Author": "J. A. Torres", "ReviewID": "R1MWK1J3Z086L2", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "After 2 months of anticipation I am not jumping for joy about this TV. I originally owned the KDL65W850A and was wowed from the second a picture came on to the screen. The blacks were deep an rich the color popped and was accurate. Unfortunately I kept receiving TVs with panel problems (Banding then clouding). I tried four of those before I gave up and decided to wait for the new models due on March of this year.After taking Amazon forever and a day to get this TV (KDL70W850B) in stock, I finally got my TV delivered today 4/10/14 and when I turned it on I immediately knew this TV was not going to wow me like the KDL850A. The colors looked dull and not as accurate in comparison. I also noticed a bit of white clipping before making adjustments. I noticed also some ghosting and luckily after a bit of tinkering it seemed to subside or it could have been the specific TV channel picture was of poor quality. The blacks are good but not great. I also noticed a bit of clouding and ever so slight flash lighting while looking at a total black background (Windows desktop) while sitting in a darkened room. I was a bit bummed to see that since only 1 out of the 4 KDL850As I had received had those issues. I can definitely tell you for sure that the Tri-Luminous display makes quite a bit of difference and SONY made an big error removing it from this TV. Sony should have forgone the extra 5 inches in screen size and just tried to continue improving on what they produced last year with the KDL850A. I also read somewhere (not 100% sure) that the panel manufacturer for this TV are not the same as the one for the KDL850A.Some other quick things of note. Sony Changed the home screen layout from the KDL850A. Now the configuration icons are located at the top right hand corner of the screen and are quite a bit small for such a large screen. Looking for the software update location was a bit frustrating as they also moved that. You have to hit home on the remote the go to the upper right hand corner of the screen and click on the question mark and scroll down to I believe is Support and click that and then scroll down again and click update software. I also want to add that the GUI seems like it lags a bit as well as the response time in the remote.I will add more info and correct any while also adding pictures in the coming days. For now I am rating this TV a 3.5 out of 5Update#1Noticed the picture on the TV no matter how much you calibrate looks soft and lacking in clear detail also there seems to be a slight motion blur and the only thing that helped was changing the settings so I ended up with the Soap Opera Effect.Another thing, the clouding is much more pronounced than I originally thought. Earlier I was watching in a semi dark room and it was noticeable but not overly distracting but at night in a pitch black room watching a dark film like Tron or Riddick was painful. Increasing the Advanced contrast feature helped reduce the clouding a bit but it also degraded the picture quality. I tried using the Disney WOW disc and while it made some slight improvement overall, I don't think it will be enough to keep me from returning this TV. I think since I can not afford the 4k SONY tvs that I will try the KDL65w850A once more and see if I get lucky this time. At this point I would of even gone a lot smaller and tried the KDL-55W900A but it seems Amazon is not carrying it anymore other than used ones through it's Warehouse Deals.Update#2Some additional things I want to add. First the viewing angle is not fantastic. At about 45 degrees about a 1/3 of the screen or slightly more seems to become a bit washed out. So if you have a large L shaped sectional or a side chair setup off to the side of your main seating area, the person sitting there is not going to have the best viewing experience but then again very few TV offer anything better. Second my experience playing FPS games. I played COD BO 2 multi-player for 2 days (Not 2 days straight, heh) and felt there was a considerable amount of lag on Game mode scene select. I tried other modes and it just made it worse. I don't know what the lag time is on this TV but I cannot believe that is the same as the W850A (18 ms). It's not horrible like with some TVs where it takes away from the total gaming experience but it was noticeable and took a bit of time to get used to. I personally would not recommend this TV to anyone who does a lot of FPS multi-player gaming. Last thing I want to add is that I was very irritated at the fact that the 55 inch version of this TV has the Tri-luminous display tech on it but the 60 inch and 70 inch do not. I have a really hard time understanding SONYs thought process on this. Although it might explain why the 55 inch and the 60 inch are the same price currently on Amazon. It just makes no sense to me. I would of gladly spent a few bucks more if they included the Tri-luminous tech on the 70W850B so I didn't have to fork over $2000 more just to get that tech in a 65 inch 4k TV. But maybe that is SONYs plan to force people to buy the new tech.", "Date": "April 10, 2014"}, {"Title": "WOW  WOW", "Author": "T.

Different tones of black are very noticeable. Gray scale's very nice. NO Banding  No Flash Lighting.  EDGE LIT with FRAME DIMMING. I think  Sony chose frame Dimming rather then Local Dimming to keep the 850B affordable. It does the job, beautiful beautiful picture. HD channels look pretty dang good even though they really arn't true HD. CNN will blow your mind. Even Non Hd channels look terrific. I was in such a rush to write this review I haven't had time to check out the  3D, That is not why I bought this TV.. Wedge design was created to hold larger speakers and they are real good, nice crisp clear sound. Which is one reason I went for the W850B. I personally don't feel I need a Sound Bar now. Remote is a little different then what i am used to, not having a menu button but it's really  not a big deal.It is  a VERY Impressive looking television, and you are able to adjust the stand to  fit on your entertainment table. Width is 68 inches, my table was 54.. Apps are nice, although amazon not there yet even though it's Icon is.. Says coming soon. I hope I have covered what most  prospective buyers are concerned about. If not please feel free to ask away. I am thrilled with my purchase and happy I waited for Amazon to offer it.I am a Loyal Amazon purchaser.  My delivery company was CEVA and I truly  received the White Glove treatment, they were fantastic.", "Date": "April 10, 2014"}, {"Title": "Bought it on the spot!", "Author": "Elliott Marshall", "ReviewID": "R3236N95RSMJUD", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Saw this TV yesterday and the Sony rep showed us features that were very appealing, as was the fantastic and realistic picture and resolution.
