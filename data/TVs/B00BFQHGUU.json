I thought it was a great deal for $479 (+CA tax and $5 enviornment fee).Skip first paragraph if you don't want to hear about how unsatisfied I am with Delivery.First I want to say that I am a little upset at Amazon and there Delivery partner in my area CEVA. I have prime and I had set up a delivery for Saturday morning. Friday night I receive a call from CEVA telling me that the TV hadn't arrived and that it would arrive on monday night and shipped out on tuesday. I am not sure if it was AMAZON's fault (their page showed item as delivered to CEVA) or CEVA's fault, but that took away the convinience of schedule delivery promoted by AMAZON Prime. Ok, just wanted to mention that. Now on to TV.Took TV out of Box and I loved how it really had a thin Bezel. Vizio promotes this and even though it isn't extremelly flat all around, the thin bezel makes the screen look bigger than a 55\". Package came with screws screwdirver to install the included stand. It wasn't difficult but you might need help lifting TV and resting it on its screen side to install the stand.Setting the TV took around 10 min. Took me around that time because I wrote my info to register the TV with VIZIO, and this takes a little while going through letters and numbers with the remote.HDMI and other video inputs are on the back and on the side. I really love the side inputs because they help delete clotter from the back if you're putting next to a wall.The picture did look good but it was not what I expected (and have seen 120hz) do. VIZIO promotes this TV as a 120hz Effective refresh rate and it actually acts more like a 60hz. Not sure if I am suppose to do something to make the Effective Refresh kick in, but to me it just seems like VIZIO lied in this department. But besides that, picture looks great and again thanks to thin Bezel, screen looks great.I really loved that the tV came with smart apps, it made the value even greater. The first app I tried was Netflix and it just kept giving me an error that it couldnt connect and to try going to netflix.com/help (i think). On that site, Netflix suggest to unplug tv for certain time and plug it in and try netflix again. The other one is: While on the netflix app (showing error message), press the following on your remote, Up, Up, Down, Down, Left, Right, Left, Right, Up, Up, Up, Up. This will bring up a \"secret\" option that displays a \"Deactivate\" button. Choose \"Deactivate\" and press OK. Get out of the netflix app and open the app again. This allowed me to get into netflix and log in. I actually tried the second method first and it worked. That is the only app I have used so far.I am not expert when it comes to TV settings but I did feel that the TV could look a little better, so I looked around for picture settings. Unfortunately there isn't many setting available from major review sites besides CNET and reviewers like ourselves. I actually used the settings that someone posted on this site for an A1 series tv (because there were non specifically for my E550 A0. Also, CNEt says that any settings you find for the following tvs, will work well with any of them since they all have around the same mechanics.

Hall", "ReviewID": "RG6A1MAH8A4D2", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I can not rate the TV itself because it never worked due to shipping damage but based on other reviews I have read, maybe it was a blessing in disguise. I got this as a lightning deal for a great price and although I selected my desired delivery date at purchase time, that date was changed for some reason. I was excited for the TV to arrive and read on Amazon's site about what to expect and do when it arrived. I live in the northeast and it was winter so the temps were cold on delivery day. Amazon's site says not to turn the TV on until it has had time to come up to room temperature when outside temps are cold. Here is where the deceptive part comes in; when the delivery guys came and brought the box into my house, the guy asked that I not unpack the TV for 30 minutes due to the temp difference indoors/outdoors. I did not really think too much about it because it was similar advice as given on Amazon's site. Shortly after the delivery service left, I began to think about what they said and thought why can't I unpack it? As long as I don't plug it in for 30 minutes, I should still be able to unpack it. So, I opened the box and pulled the TV out. When the TV slid out, I noticed some white foam pieces came out as well. I thought, not good, those foam pieces were supposed to protect the TV. I then noticed the TV bezel around the screen had damage. Now I can't say for sure but it seems to me the delivery guys told me not to unpack it for 30 minutes instead of just not to plug it in for 30 minutes because they knew the box had been dropped and the TV might be damaged. I immediately called Amazon customer service and they asked me to plug the TV in and see if it worked. No joy, the TV would only display a blue screen. I was bummed out when the customer service rep told me I could not get a replacement because they were sold out. I have to give Amazon customer service 5 stars for their assistance and for taking the TV back and issuing a full refund.Lesson learned, make sure items are unpacked and checked for damage before signing anything and letting the delivery service leave.

The smart menu also has quite a bit of lag when opening it up. The stock color settings are terrible especially the reds, and i am no videophile.

I received it on time and the shippers were kind enough at going through the checklist for everything. 100 % functional, good so far.The first quirk I noticed was with the quality of the build. The plastic felt cheap and weak, and at times when moving it felt like the whole thing was held together by glue. But of course this IS the budget model from Vizio, so that is understandable. What was NOT ok was that whenever I moved the TV and gently shook it, the screen itself moved between the plastic as if it was not anchored/glued correctly, or it was so badly constructed in the first place that it couldn't survive the shipping all that well. I was expecting the TV to not turn on or work, but to my surprise it turned right on and started up perfectly. It still has the slight wobble in the screen if it is moved, but based on the fact that it still works correctly, I don't know if this one TV just happened to be damaged, or if it is just the way that it is made. Regardless I had to deduct a star for this reason.Quirk number two is a little more technical. I have my tv hooked up directly to my computer through HDMI and I was running my 2.1 sound system directly to the computer. Now that I have my cable and XBox hooked up to the TV as well, that setup no longer worked. So I hooked my RCA cables (Red and White) from the subwoofer (Built in amp) to the tv to make all audio run through the speakers. Then I had to turn off the TV speakers. So far so good. Then I changed the tv from fixed volume input to variable, so that I could control the volume with the TV remote instead of the speaker knobs themselves. Afterwords, everything was working correctly, I thought. Then I noticed that the sub was not producing any sound. Come to find out, with the setting on variable, the TV was not sending the low pass signals to the sub like it is suppose to. I called Vizio to find out what I could do to fix the issue. They said I needed to use optical output to make it work correctly, so I got a converter, and of course the same issue was happening. I ended up just switching back to the fixed input and just manually change the volume when I switch over to the cable or XBox.All in all, the TV is a really good TV. The smart apps were pretty lackluster, but I never use them so it doesn't bother me, but if you want to stream Netflix or Hulu Plus or some other service, then consider getting another TV. If not, then for the price this TV is a great choice.Also, a lot of people were complaining that the color was terrible when they first turned it on, and that they had to go through all these different adjustments to get it bearable, but when I first turned on my TV, I didn't think the color was that bad, and within 5 minutes of playing with the options, I was able to get it like I wanted.

The biggest gripe I have is the remote. It is too small, buttons are too small and close to each other (because it is too small) and no backlighting for the remote buttons. Have to turn on an ambient light to see the remote buttons to navigate. I am continuously hitting a neighbor key (fat-fingers), or sliding off a key to hit a key next to the original one I selected. Very annoying. I want a GIANT remote with GIANT, BACKLIT buttons.I did have to replace my first set. After 14 hours of perfect picture, the picture turned into the look that you have with old-fashioned color film negatives. I called Vizio, they asked for a photo, which I furnished. They said I had a lemon and was unfixable and could send another set to arrive in 7-10 days. Since I just bought the set at Walmart three days earlier, I said no, thanks and exchanged it at Walmart. No questions asked.But, other than that, I am pleased with my replacement set so far. I set my settings starting with Calibrated settings and then moved backlighting to 75%. That works fine for me; my viewing room is pretty dark. The Smart TV feature isn't what I thought it would be. It presents more options for more gateways to web-based presentations or streaming than I got from my old Sony Blue-Ray gateways. (Example, many local tv and weather news \"channels\" for various spots around the country. So, I may eventually find them useful. Netflix and Hulu have one less button to push and you don't have to turn on the Blue-Ray to get your wifi going, as the wifi in Vizio is on all the time the router is up.I was pleasantly surprised that you can see the signal strength of sources & channels if you hit the Source button, wherever you are. Found that Fox, ESPN, History, and ABC channels (and their affiliates) are 720p and all other tv channels are 1080i; whereas netflix and blue-ray are 1080p. So, I learned something new. Found out that TV broadcasters don't plan to upgrade their broadcast strength for a long time into the future, which is interesting. And, movies aren't going to increase their current 24 frames per second soon, either.

Many reviews here for the Vizio E550i-A0 but many do not discuss about the remote. The remote does not come with a keyboard or a slide out keyboard like other smart Vizio TVs, though I already knew that. However, the remote is GARBAGE which makes me want to take -1 star away from this HDTV. The lag is so significant it irritates me. One good example is that it takes a good 2-3 seconds to even turn the volume down or up one notch and etc. Compared to my other HDTVs, they barely take a millisecond to change a channel, volume, inputs, and etc. I do not know if it is the remote or something else.

I pay attention to all the settings, color balance, black levels, white levels, dead pixels, and I would die to see a picture in a improper aspect ratio.I color matched my computer monitors and even sent 2 of them back due to color banding or a dead pixel so, yeah a bit picky...For my TV the important things for me was good viewing angles, and good black levels, and overall good quality on picture and colors.This TV surprised me with a picture quality I would never expect from a cheap brand name.  I have seen this brand before at a friends house and it looked horrible, but that was a much older TV, much cheaper (only 720P) and he probably never even tried to calibrate it.I ran 2 calibration disks on this and from there tweaked by eye to my preference.I manually turned off/on all the extra image processing features and when I was done, this thing looks great!My black levels are good enough that I can see anything I should in a dark movie setting, and my blacks look BLACK and my white levels while not as great are giving me a nice perfect looking white shade and overall coloration that makes me happy.For the money I paid for this it was a steal, and I only wanted it for the TV itself not any of the smart features that are also included.My largest + is that the image scaling on this TV is not just 1:1 or stretch, it also had a aspect ratio fill and that is perfect for SD content to make it fit my screen without distorting it.The largest - is that for some reason they do not have a VGA connection that I consider standard on any HDTV.  I also really didn't like the power cable connection.  I wish it was a standard 3 pin like computers and computer monitors use as they fit more secure and offer more protection than the 2 prong accessory style plug this uses.But this was my gift to myself and the family this year and its a present that we enjoy each and every day.

Both my TV's are LAN connected thanks to an ethernet switch behind both TV's. Sound isn't that great (get a sound bar).

Wish I could give more info but it seems to suit with fine with Directv HD. I LOVE THE YOUTUBE app! I use that all the time and it works so well on this TV (see question regarding that below)I do have a QUESTION for anyone who reads this review. The 47 inch razor and this E550i-A0 are both smart TV's with the same apps. The Razor TV's Youtube App isn't nearly as responsive as this app. It works, but navigation is very slow... Once you start playing the video's on the app, they play fine, it's the moving up, down, scrolling through videos that's a major difference from one tv to the other. I even cleared all memory on the Razor and deleted apps I never use, there aren't that many that I want honestly, but it's still slow navigation.....If anyone has any suggestion as to why it's slow navigation on one tv, but not the other, let me know.More about the Vizio Youtube app. I LOVE it and I'll tell you why! When it first came out, I didn't like it at all. But Vizio must have updated this. Now when you log into your youtube account on the Vizio app, you can see your uploads, your favorites, people you subscribe to and THEIR playlists! You can rate videos, or subscribe to a channel etc. This Youtube app can do so much more than the youtube app on my panasonic bluray player. I just wish the one on the razor TV was more responsive when navigating.Conclusion: I've had Vizio TV's since 2006. The one this tv replaced was almost 6 years old with no issues.

I immediately noticed that the picture quality was poor, despite several good reviews. The biggest problem I had with this set, is that there was purple ghosting following moving subjects, especially people. This seemed to be most aggregated when light skinned people were over a dark background.The viewing angle on this TV is terrible. Just a little off to either side, or above, and the colors shift and desaturate severely. The 120hz was a joke, it had no settings for motion smoothing, and I could see no difference compared to my 7 year old LG TV.As far as features, it did have a lot of built in Apps and a decent interface, but the processing was slow. I often resorted to my Playstation or ChromeCast instead.I did not realize the \"E\" series was meant for economy. I thought I had done my due diligence reading reviews but apparently those owners were not nearly as picky as me, or they were just blind. I suspect in reality, they upgraded from either a smaller set, or a non HD TV and did not notice the problems over impressively large display. During the ordeal of trying to figure out the \"problem\" (which there was none, it was by design), I visited a local Best Buy that had the set and noticed it was the same, and much worse than surrounding sets.I do have to say, Amazon 30 day tech support was fabulous. Much better than Vizio's own tech line. Vizio kept insisting I send still pictures of the problem or try to get a video of it and denied any such problem. I know it's a real issue as I did find one other review that indicated that they noticed the purple hazing. Eventually they agreed to refund the purchase, as they \"no longer had the TV in stock.\" I suspect that Amazon with their suppliers have some creative marketing with how they list items, as this TV was not listed as being sold by Amazon before the lightning deal started, nor after it was over, only during the sale.I was very disappointed, as I purchased this TV on a black Friday lighting deal. I was not a good value, and all my effort to get the deal, was in vain as all Amazon could understandably do was refund my money.The return process was a little cumbersome, as the courier CEVA, never showed up when they were supposed to.

Then remote stopped working, then picture and sound problems.  Sometimes picture w/o sound, sometimes vice versa.  Called vizio customer service numerous times.  Americans that can be reached anytime is good but they were not helpful.  Over and over again, unplug this, hold this for 30 seconds, reset this, take batteries out and push buttons, clear memory, unplug, repeat, rinse, wash... Rep told me problems with interference on my network.  Solution turn file sharing off, unplug this from router, unplug that.  Me: but I want to use file share, that crap is plugged in for reason.  Them: You have problem with network.  Me:  Vizio tv has problem with my network, Panasonic works just fine.  More calls, more troubleshooting.  Finally I say no more troubleshooting and they ask one more time then we will send replacement if it does not work.  Try, fail, vizio sends email for replacement asking for copy of receipt.  Email copy of receipt.  Get email to call customer service.  Customer service, let's try some troubleshooting.

It's about the same thickness as a lcd tv with a CCFL backlight. Semi-glossy screen.  I have it wall mounted in a bedroom, so these things don't bother me that much.The TV smelled really bad out of the box.  The only other time I've noticed anything this bad smelling was when I bought a refurbished bluray player, and I assumed it was due to the manufacturer having to do some soldering repairs on it.  When I got the tv box open, I was afraid there was something wrong with the set, due to the extremely strong smell, but it worked fine.  The full strength of the smell went away after about a week, but I can still smell traces of it at times even today (after about a month later).  Not very pleasant having to sleep through the smell in the bedroom (hazardous?).Image quality is ok.  I have a Sharp 60\" led edge lit lcd tv from costco, and the image quality on that set is slightly better (but it also cost me 3x's as much).  I tried to make adjustments to the settings, but ended up just going with the factory settings after some fiddling.The only app I use on the tv is youtube, and it works.  The UI to access the app is not very friendly IMO.  Instead of just selecting the app to launch directly, you have to select it, go through some popup preview, and then navigate down to launch the app (~ over 5 button presses instead of 1 or 2).  It does load slightly faster than my ~2 year old sharp tv, so I'm guessing it has a faster processor.There's some bug when I try to pair my android device to control the youtube app, where it either completely fails to pair or ends up rebooting the app several times before it syncs.  It's a little quirky with my other tv sometimes as well, but not as bad as the vizio.  It does end up working eventually (through app reboots on one or both devices), but it's kind of a pain to have to wait for the two devices to figure out how to play nicely together.  On the bright side, once paired, it's fantastic.There's also a unicorn carrying a magic pot of chocolate bunnies that flies out from the screen, leaving behind a colorful flower rainbow trail in your room when you tap the edges of the set in a konami code pattern.  The bunnies are great, but I mean, really, what's a guy supposed to do with all those flowers?  Dislike.  I kid. I kid.  ... those flowers make great decorations.In summary, if you want a relatively cheap, thick, smelly, smart (insert obese celebrity reference here), decent looking tv, buy it...and NO, there's no unicorns!  that was a joke.

The delivery sheet states that it's a 2 man delivery. There was only one person. It was supposed to be unboxed, plugged in, and turned on. None of this was done. He set it down, had me sign for it, and left. I had to unbox it and when I turned it on the screen was cracked. I will never order anything like this from Amazon again. It's much better to go to a local store. I'm also probably going to cancel my Prime membership. I have to do it by next Thursday to not be billed. I just want to make sure it won't affect this return. I've been extremely happy with Amazon up to this point. Unfortunately it only takes one incident like this. I do apologize for the fact this isn't actually a product review but I'm very upset that I had to waste a vacation day to sit and wait for a broken tv. The delivery company was Pilot Freight Services.Edit: After reading some of the comments I wanted to add this edit in a more calm manner. Amazon normally does a very good job at least for me in the past. I feel they may have dropped the ball on this. I've been a prime member for several years and it's coming up for renewal. They may have offered to give me the next year free. It's not a big cost to them and and it probably would have appeased me more for having to waste a vacation day. Do they really owe me anything, of course not but sometimes customer service is about making the customer happy when the company does something wrong. And since it was delivered in a broken condition they choose the carrier so it's their fault until the product is opened and turned on for the first time. And I think that rather than me having to take another day off they should insist that the package is picked up either Mon-Fri after 4:30 PM or on a Saturday. I think the main thing I want people to realize is that for deliveries of products such as this you may be inconvenienced several times. Probably not since I'm sure most deliveries go smoothly but I thought mine would go smoothly also and here I am.Edit# 2: I talked to Amazon Customer Service on Sat Sept 21 to see if we might be able to come to an arrangement. Customer Service was great and part of the arrangement was that the bad tv would be picked up when the new one is delivered. They are also going to see if it can be delivered either after 4 PM during the week or sometime on a Saturday which would be great.Edit# 3: This is my final edit. I received the television today a little after 4 PM. Amazon and Pilot were amazing in taking care of the issue. Kings Express was a little harder to deal with but finally gave in and delivered it after 4 PM so I wouldn't have to take more time off. I think the picture is great. I'm not a great tv critic but while watching some shows I was amazed at the blue of their eyes. We watched a show on Amazon Prime and it was nice. Didn't have any issues with it. It was streaming through cat-5. I like the fact that you have the Amazon Prime button on the remote. The cable box was a little trickier. I haven't gotten a digital box from the cable company yet so during the setup I was picking the cable box but finally figured out I had to pick cable coming straight from wall. The sound is a bit hard to make out since the speakers are in the bottom of the tv pointing down. Eventually I'll get a receiver and speakers for better sound but for now it's fine. So the 2 star downgrade is for the delivery and sound. The main reason I feel so strongly about the delivery is that maybe 90% of the people have a flawless delivery and no issues with the product.

A month out of warranty started to see lines in the TV. 24 hrs later the tv is all lines now you can not see any picture.. Called vizio, they didn't even bother to say they could fix it. They refused to help at all. Said I was SOL on the tv and I should buy another one.I have never had a TV go out after a year of use. I will never buy a Vizio again.", "Date": "December 30, 2013"}, {"Title": "no comparison", "Author": "zoey", "ReviewID": "R60VC44YT1LMB", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I purchased this TV online at Amazon after looking at other TV's in person with the same make up. When I got the TV I was disappointed in picture quality. It is not near as crisp and clear as samsung or sony or even LG. I should have gotten samsung. It looks like a small photo that you tried to make to large and is fuzzy.Also dissatisfied about the\"smart\" capability.  I thiught u would be able to go onto the internet and search things or check email but you cannot get google you are locked into yahoo and only the apps vizio provides AND if yiu do make use of the apps...like facebook..I trued that and was sadly disappointed that it did not fill the screen it is just a small pic on the side :(", "Date": "August 29, 2013"}, {"Title": "The VIA features and delivery are not so good, otherwise good.", "Author": "Amazon Customer", "ReviewID": "RB4XLWJVJJY5B", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "First, the scheduled delivery was anything but. 3 hours late, no phone call or other notification. I called CEVA at an hour and a half late and was promised the driver would contact me with an updated timetable. He didn't. (Update: he did call my work number and leave a message, not sure why.)  Luckily I took the whole day off instead of just the promised window or I would have returned it. Don't count it on it being there within the promised delivery window. It was easy enough to screw the stand onto it and plug the cables in, although the recessed area for the HDMI, LAN, etc. is not wide enough and you have to put a pretty sharp bend in all the cables if you want to have the TV flush against the wall. After turning it on, the setup app locked up twice and I had to unplug the TV to restart it. Early on there is a registration screen asking for email, town, etc. Surprise, there is no apparent way to enter text with the remote so I entered 5s for everything. Later I managed to get the answer of of Vizio's online chat support after navigating the Spanish Inquisition of registration and scripted support jail: click the OK button in the text box to bring up the on-screen keyboard. This tip comes in handy when activating the Netflix app and some other features. Possibly Vizio has a note in their support database about a crabby customer named Mr 55555 55555.But, since I got everything up and working it has been good for the price. The screen is crisp and clear, I like the smart dimming feature, it works well for me since there is a sliding door right next to the screen, I used to have to close the curtain to watch when there was sunlight coming in.", "Date": "May 17, 2013"}, {"Title": "Got this on black friday for $480 on an amazon lightening deal", "Author": "David Zuckerman", "ReviewID": "R1AOUIY1ENBXKL", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Works well.
