But so far its been good to have this TV at home. No significant issue is noticed. The sound bar remote is integrated with some key functionality of the TV. For eg. you can use only the sound bar remote and switch on the TV with that, that makes life easier.  2D to 3D conversion is good when content is played from  a DVD or Blueray. Most of the streaming content is of less quality and those with low quality its better to watch in 2D rather than 3D. I have XBOX console with me and most of the stuff I watch by streaming thru XBOX. Quality is good when streaming thru XBOX. I watch cable TV rarely, since most of the stuff is thru streaming nowadays.", "Date": "December 31, 2012"}, {"Title": "all it was described to be", "Author": "Ron McBride", "ReviewID": "R2S58ZYP49ZLI5", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "My new LG55LM4700 is an amazing set. The 3-D is breathe-taking. Even the simulated 2-D to 3-D is good. But playing a 3-D Blue Ray DVD will blow your mind. They image looks as if it is right in front of your eyes and the depth goes to infinity. It came with a sound bar which is okay but not as impressive as using surround sound. I'd purchase a 4600 without the sound bar especially if you already have a surround sound system. I was hoping to use it as my center speaker but can't.", "Date": "May 2, 2013"}, {"Title": "Great Package Deal!!", "Author": "Corey D.

This tv is very cool..has 3D options that you can use with some DVDs and it works...fun for children especially..Love the soundbar..just enough loudness for a great room.  It was all very easy to set up (I am a senior citizen) ..I had one call to the customer service of LG and the guy was very nice and helpful..That was it...all good to go...Got the sony bluray dvd player to go with it..has easy access to netflix and other things...I thought about a smart tv first...but decided on this one first to get something different than samsung and second I didn't want a bunch of stuff that could go wrong on the tv.  Box was delivered by truck..great condition!

I finally decided to buy and bought the same tv with LG wifi blu ray player for $799 from frys during Thanks giving sale. Color calibration is outstanding. Sound bar is amazing. 3D effects and  quality are surprisingly good. I was scared of seeing bad pixels / motion issues. 120hz trumotion is amazing. I'v been watching NFL in this tv and this TV is awesome. You can control TV and sound bar with one remote. 3D blu ray player was a bonus.", "Date": "February 1, 2013"}, {"Title": "Nice TV", "Author": "Timothy Keen \"kkid\"", "ReviewID": "RB1MANB12QY4P", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I purchased a 55LM4700 at Best Buy.  I am pleased with the picture.  It definitely deals with motion better than my old Sony HDTV.  The sound bar works fine, but is unimpressive.  There is barely any tonal difference between the built-in speakers and the sound bar.  Maybe if I crank up the volume to a high level the soundbar would stand out, but I don't use the TV that way.  No regrets on the purchase.  If you find a good, price go for it.

The TruMotion is a scam and doesn't exist.  They can't prove that it works and you can tell when watching sports that it doesn't.  I have a Visio from 2 years ago that has better motion control than this tv.  I made the mistake of buying before I researched it.  Won't make that mistake again.
