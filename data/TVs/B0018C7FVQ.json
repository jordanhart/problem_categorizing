They gave me a four day window then moved it back another week which caused me inconvenience since I was in town for the original dates but out of state for the second. Had I known they were going to change the dates I would have found another vender.The price was ver good, however. I saved $700.00 by not going the retail route.It all worked out and I am happy with the purchase.", "Date": "July 14, 2008"}, {"Title": "Vertical Lines ruin a great picture", "Author": "Christopher R.

A few weeks later, a vertical line appeared on the left side of the screen.  We will now have to work with Mitsubishi's customer service to determine what the problem is and how they will fix it.Overall, the picture is great after the line disappears (usually 30 min after turning it on).", "Date": "November 28, 2008"}, {"Title": "Flawed after one year", "Author": "Russ Widstrand", "ReviewID": "R3RW3NRHDAZMQR", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "After one year this tv developed 3 lines at the right side of the screen.
