I had Samsung 40E5050 which too I liked very much. But there was probably some technical issue....that would sometimes produce spark like sound,so I returned that TV. The Costco in my place didn't have that Samsung TV anymore. Since Samsung was very good for me as per picture and sound and price....I couldn't decide which to buy now. Then I saw this Sony Bravia 40R450A (2013model) for unbelievable price. I had always thought of buying Sony but didn't buy because of price. But this 40\" led Sony is priced unreasonably low, price is comparable to other brands whereas the quality....its very high !!The picture is simply amazing and there are various preset modes to select or one can manually set his own preferences. I have not changed any picture setting though.Though 60hz, it has Motion Flow of 120. so I think it is comparable to 120hz TV of other brands. There is significant improvement in judder which I used to get in my previous TV.I use indoor antenna and don't ask me how good is the reception of this TV. I really recommend this TV for those who use indoor antenna....I can get so many channels now, that too very clear. This one has the best reception when compared to my previous Samsung and JVC Black crystal.I use Roku with my TV and it has no issues.The TV is very slim and light. The bezel is very thin. it occupies little space.This TV also has fm in it but I haven't tried yet.For me its an useless feature.It is also smartphone enabled.DRAWBACKS:It has only 2 hdmi ports and has only one usb port which can be used to play photos, music and video(unlike Samsung, it supports very few video formats(xvid and avchd). whereas Samsung would support almost any video formats).OVERALL, I recommend this TV to anyone who want quality in low price.", "Date": "March 20, 2013"}, {"Title": "When combined with other Sony (and Roku) products, this becomes perfect", "Author": "B. Lee", "ReviewID": "R1GO29RN1M0X2K", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "What if you could get a high quality Sony smart television with access to Netflix, HBO Go, Hulu Plus, Pandora, and more... And what if it output sound to your receiver without needing any additional cables than the hdmi in you have plugged in already?  What if all this could be had for a shade over $500?Such is the case when this TV is combined with the Roku 3400R Streaming Stick.  Plug the stick into HDMI 2/MHL, and after a quick setup it's all controllable with the TV's remote.Even better, I also have a Sony STR-DH720 receiver and an older Sony BDP-S370 Blu-Ray Player.  First cool feature - HDMI-CEC/ARC.  This means the Roku outputs surround sound to the receiver without needing any cables.  Just use the Bravia Sync button on the remote to select TV speakers or the amplifier... Which it will automatically turn on and off as needed.  That's cool.  The blu ray player is also controllable through this menu, and the volume automatically adjusts the right input.So that's the cool feature stuff, but how is the TV compared to other sub-$500 40\" sets?  Very competitive.  We compared this with a Toshiba 40l2200u and a Vizio 39\" Smart model, both priced at $400.  The Toshiba is not competitive with either of these models.  The Vizio seems to have slightly better motion resolution but with less vibrant color capability and far worse sound.  Roku's streaming platform has more channels and is more stable than the one built by Vizio as well.  The Samsung 40\" 5300 is the next best choice, but the Sony is more attractive (to me), sounds better, and I trust Sony gear more than Samsung.The only con I've discovered so far is some motion blur, primarily with cartoons.  Black eyeballs will pop up behind moving characters... I'm not sure if I can defeat this with a setting (there are lots!) but it's mild and only occasionally noticeable.PROS:Excellent out of box PQMHL port for streaming accessoriesARC for fewer cablesBetter than average flat panel soundPrice for Sony's rep and featuresBravia syncCONSMotion could be betterBezel, while nice and thin, is very shinyThis is the best TV in our house and the best I've seen in this price bracket.

A lot of other reviewers give you the details about this TV...so read on for those. The reason I looked for and purchased this TV was to get a 50 inch SONY LED HDTV for under a grand without all the bells and whistles I don't need. Specifically, the SMART TV features. I already owned a SONY Blu-ray player with wi-fi ($129 2 years ago) that had all of the features of a SMART TV - Netflix, Amazon movies, Pandora, etc. so all I needed was a simply elegant TV, which is what I got. Had it out of the box and set up in under 10 minutes. With, my blu-ray player connected I can access the exact same content that would have been on the much more expensive SMART TV. Picture quality is great. I paired this with a SONY HTCT260 Sound Bar and we couldn't be happier. FYI- the SONY 50 inch TV only has 2 HDMI inputs, so I also purchased from Amazon a Portta PET0301S 3x1 HDMI Switcher with 3D Support. You can plug up to 3 HDMI cords IN-to the switcher with one cord from the switcher OUT to the TV. What I love about it is when I turn a device ON, such as my BluRay Player, the switcher detects it and pushes that image to the screen - realizing that is why I turned it on - because I want to watch the BluRay player!! Genius! It even turns the TV ON if it was off. Although that may be a function of the SONY devices working in harmony rather than the switcher. Either way it's way cool.All this SONY equipment plus the Cable HD Box left me with 4 unique remotes. Aargh! The wife was not impressed. So, I purchased the SONY Universal Remote RM-VZ320 for about twenty bucks. And, voila!! Happy wife. Happy life!! The remote works great too! Pays to buy ALL SONY. Thanks SONY and AMAZON - a great combination!p.s. count up how many HDMI cables you'll need and order them at the same time from Amazon - great prices. Ask me how I know? Yep.

(50\" Version: KDL-50R450A)", "Author": "WARRZONE", "ReviewID": "R19X8SQHWEHNWA", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This TV has a fantastic picture. The direct LED backlight prevents any uniformity issues. The Motion Flow XR 120 works and is sufficient for games, movies, or other entertainment. I did not have to mess around with the advanced picture settings in the menu. I ended up leaving it on Standard mode. The TV styling (build) and menu styling (interface) are very nice. The TV is well-built and does not feel cheap, and the stand is not flimsy.I'll include my selection process in case you're interested. My suggestion would be find out what your requirements are, and then, try to find a TV that fits your budget.I measured how far away I sit from the TV and found the sceen size I needed. Here's a chart for reference:Screen Size Recommended Range35\" 3.5' - 5.0' (1.0 - 1.5 m)40\" 4.0' - 6.0' (1.2 - 1.8 m)50\" 5' - 7.5' (1.5 - 2.2 m)60\" 6.0' - 9.0' (1.8 - 2.7 m)I did not want a Plasma because of the energy use, heat output, dim in well lit rooms, burn-in potential, irreparability/or very costly, etc. I know most people have great plasma sets, but I did not want or have the money to fool with it for a little better blacks and contrast. Plus, the plasmas weren't any cheaper, but they did have the \"smart\" function.I did not need a Smart TV since they typically have a clumsy interface, and it drives up the price. Updates are slow and their app selection is more limited than boxes like Roku or Apple TV with Airplay. I use my Xbox 360 and soon my PS4 for apps anyway.I did not need a 3D TV, which I see as more of a gimmick. Would it be nice to have? Sure, but not for $250 more. Converted TV programming is not worth it. It is hard to get real HD content on Blu-Ray, and even then, HD stereoscopic 3D is best viewed on a 100\"+ quality screen (my preference is silver) using a good projector ($1500+) with at least 1k lumens (most have more than that now anyway).As a rule, I don't buy budget brands because the quality is usually not up to par. Toshiba and LG have had perfomance reviews recently (i.e. their stated high refresh rate seems to help nothing, black levels are bad, and well-lit room image quality is bad). I had a Sharp die on me, so that left my choice between Sony, Samsung, and Panasonic. Samsung and Panasonic were overpriced. That left Sony. Sony had one that fit my budget.I mentioned some of the positive aspects of this TV, so now I will list the few negative apects of this TV that I have found. The corners are a little dark, but they are barely noticeable unless there is one color across the screen. It's much better than flashlighting that some edge-lit models have. The sound quality of the speakers is similar to that of all flat-screen TV speakers, so I had to get a sound bar (HTCT260H). This isn't a negative, but Bravia Sync works well (HDMI CEC). The TV only has 1 true HDMI port. It's a good thing it has ARC, so no HDMI output is really necessary. The other HDMI port is shared with MHL on the left side of the TV, which I did not know before I bought it. I thought I was getting 2 stand-alone HDMI inputs + 1 MHL port. The only one HDMI input in the back situation makes my decision for me on how to set up the cables -- I will be running everything into a switcher, then into the sound bar, and then into the TV (using high speed HDMI cables). The remote does not have a dedicated settings button. This means I have to take extra steps and press \"Home\" and scroll down and select \"Settings.\" However, there is a sort of dumbed down settings menu called \"Options\" which does have a button on the remote. Also, I'd prefer the remote to be backlit and have bluetooth capabilities (to control PS3, PS4, iPhone, etc). I may have to get a Logitech universal remote eventually.The positives, by far, outweigh the negatives (more like minor annoyances). This is a no-nonsense TV, and for the street price of $599, this TV cannot be beat!NOTE: At the time of writing this review, the Sony store says that this TV is no longer available. They were in stock just last week. I wonder if they are sold out, or if the TVs are discontinued so early. Sony should bring them back if that's the case. If you cannot get this TV, the closest thing to it I would recommend would be the Panasonic TC-L50E60 (street price: $699-$799). It is a little more expensive because of its \"smart\" functions, but its \"smart\" functions are more extensive than most.EDIT 9/14/2013: It turns out the TV is too popular. It was not discontinued, it sold out. It is back in stock in the Sony store for $599. Don't overpay the Amazon third party sellers.

I just watched the panthers and patriots play and it was as clear and crisp as my eyes can handle. I even watched the Brooklyn nets game and nothing changed brilliance remained. I was skeptical because of the ratings i was reading with the black lighting and blah blah spec talk. If you want a t.v. with a great picture plus reliable name brand and low price this is the One like the matrix. I even got a chance to catch some x men part two and it remained crisp. At night they gave the movie RIO so i took out my judging goggles and the picture, colors everything was just excellent. Definitely more bang for your buck. As far as video game ratings go i test it out with MLB the show 13 and it was clear and crisp no complaints in that department. I don't understand why people give ratings and judge the t.v. down to the specs.

Then I tried a Vizio which was a very nice TV but would not interface with my JVC Home Theater regardless of different cable arrangements. Returned that one. This 50\" inch Sony is a winner for me! I had trouble with connecting it to my JVC Home Theater/DVD system. Three different Sony techs (via phone) were very patient, we tried all the cable connection possibilities. Finally the 3rd tech told me to get the Optical (Fiber Optic) cable which would give me the TV's audio output. With the Optical Cable attached, the tech guided me in setting everything up and all works fine now. Kudos to Sony for excellent support!Although I'm not using the TV sound now, I thought it was better than most flat screen TV's. The picture is superior/best in my opinion.

The most important part of any television is it's ability to reproduce accurate color and black levels. Smart features, internet connectivity, etc. are all ancillary features that don't affect the monitors ability to display a realistic picture to faithfully reproduce the TV/Movies that you are watching. The Sony KDL-40R450A is an absolutely stunning television. It's black levels are the best I have seen on on any LCD. It's color reproduction in cinema picture mode is perfect. With any television it's the quality of the source that really affects the image most. With some reference Blu-rays, \"There Will be Blood\" \"Blade Runner\" \"Apocalypto\" the image is as good as the Kuro. That's not to say side by side you can't tell the difference, but when viewed independently the Sony holds it's own and I don't find myself noticing the difference.I know most people don't watch OTA TV anymore but with a basic antenna I can pick up all the local channels in HD. Sunday football comes in perfectly. Sony really nailed it when it comes to editing channels. It never blasts you with static if you land on a bad channel it simply shows a blue screen and says no signal. You can easily browse the spectrum and hide b.s. channels you don't want. QAM works marvelously as well. Menu's are pretty if not the most intuitive.Aside from it's stunning image the TV has beautiful industrial design. It's narrow bezel, simple stand, and branding are all understated. It looks expensive and feels very well built. It's light enough for one person to move around.If you want netflix, hbogo, hulu, and streaming buy an Apple TV or Roku. The menu and capabilities of those devices are much more refined and advanced than any built into a TV.The only downside I can see for some users is connectivity. It has only two HDMI ports and one component.

This is definitley one of the best Sony TV at a lower price. The best part of the TV is the picture quality. The HD shows and movies are so crystal clear and definitley enhances the movie watching expereince. Another important point to note is the sound quality. I have placed this TV in a relatively small living room and I am blown with the quality of the sound this TV produces without any external amplifiers etc. It was also really very easy to setup the TV did not have any issues. Almost at the same price of this TV there are smart TV's from other brands but I decided to chose this model over those for the quality of the product when compared to those models. Definitely you don't really need a smart TV if you already have roku or a blu ray player or gaming consoles because believe me I have seen other models at my varioud friends place with samrt TV features but this TV is way far better in quality of the product.", "Date": "October 30, 2013"}, {"Title": "Awesome TV for my Bedroom", "Author": "Kristofer S Camago", "ReviewID": "R3QD5KY3K27EAY", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This TV is perfect and gets the job done.

Bravia sync comes in handy when you pair it with another Sony compatible product like a soundbar - which I obviously did. HDMI ARC is very useful since there are only 2 HDMI inputs on the TV.

For some reason, I saw a Samsung 40\" at Sears and decided to order one like it from Amazon. After doing some research and discovering that Samsung was putting cheap Sharp panels (or worse, Chimea panels) on their tvs I found that I could determine whether the tv I received was truly a Samsung tv with a Samsung panel like the one I saw at Sears, or one with the cheaper panel. Sure enough, the Samsung tv I received from Amazon had a cheap Sharp panel, so I returned it to Amazon. I explained to the Amazon rep what the problem was and I wanted a Samsung tv with a Samsung panel, he said he understood and would ship me another tv right away. When I took the tv out of the box, once again it had a Sharp panel, not a Samsung. I asked for return authorization and sent it back, again explaining to the rep why I was returning it. Next thing I know Amazon said I could not order another. When Samsung was caught installing the cheap panels on its tvs it made national news, but  Amazon seemed to be completely in the dark, which is kind of hard to believe since many of the reviews clearly stated that people knew they had received Samsung tvs with the cheaper panels on them from Amazon. After reading several reviews on this Sony tv I decided to order it instead. I am completely satisfied with this tv, the picture is just as good, if not better, than the Samsung, and I am wondering why I ever decided to go with the Samsung to begin with. It dawned on me that if a company like Samsung is willing to cheat its customers then I do not want to be buying their products because I no longer know what I am getting.

Edwards", "ReviewID": "R285ME63NIU76X", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I will begin by saying that I am very picky about the accuracy of my TV,  I was pleasantly surprised to find that my Sony TV was very well calibrated, right out of the box.  This is one of the most accurately calibrated displays I have seen at its default settings.  The only adjusting I did was to change the mode to standard mode and set the white balance to neutral.  Everything else was spot-on.  The skin tones are right on the money. The contrast is perfect.  Also, Sony did a great job with their dynamic contrast enhancer.  It works much better than Samsungs (which isn't very dynamic).  However, for movies, I would turn this setting to low or off. This is my fist Sony, and I am impressed! My previous TVs have been Samsungs, but the last one I bought (UN37EH5000) had such a lousy calibration out the the box, I became frustrated with it and finally returned it.  Faces were purplish-red and no amount of adjusting could make it even come close to the Sony.  White balance calibration helped but the only way to fix the Samsung would be with a professional calibration using the service menu.  I realize that most TVs require a professional calibration.  However, I think manufacturers should be able to at least get the calibration in the ball-park. I applaud Sony for doing an excellent job with this one.Added 9/4/13 - I continue to love this TV.  There is one feature that I wish it had - an over the air electronic programming guide (EPG).  This TV only shows the information for the current program. According to Federal law, broadcasters MUST include program guide information as part of the ATSC standard.  However, TV manufacturers have no obligation to make it available to viewers.  This is where Samsung really shines.  Samsung TVs show program information up to 12 hours in advance.  You can read detailed information about the show and even program the TV to change to the channel when the show starts.  Some television manufacturers have apparently chosen to cripple this feature. In so doing, they're tilting the playing field in favor of cable or satellite TV purveyors. It's almost comical, but my new Sony requires its clock to be set manually. Yet the current time is embedded within the ATSC signal and is provided once every second!  That's absolutely ridiculous!  My Samsung sets its clock from the broadcast signal.All I can say is this:  Come on, Sony!  Climb aboard the bandwagon! You are already extracting the information for the current program.  Pay your programmers to develop some code to extract the rest of the information into nice on-screen programming guide. Then you can use the code on all of your TVs.  As more and more people get frustrated with exorbitant cable prices and discover that they can get superior HD quality over the air, they will be switching.  Seems like you would want to position your products to capture that market.  While you are at it, give us a signal strength meter too.  Again all of my Samsungs have one.  Heck, even my Radio Shack converter box that I got years ago when broadcast TV went digital, has an EPG and a signal strength meter.

Running on my ps3 games like borderlands 2 and Ni no Kuni look fantastic but some games that are up scaled a bit more have a lot of strange pixelation, but its mainly because the tv is trying to guess the pixel color I'm guessing, but games still look great.  On my ps4 though battlefield 4 and FIFA 14 look just amazing to say the least.  Particle effects and explosions are insane and I've had my girlfriend walk in while I was playing FIFA.

Also watching movies look great the colors seem to be spot on and textures look great, also with the size upgrade from my last tv allows me to notice a lot more detail.  The only complaint I have about this tv is the sound.  The two 8 watt speakers don't really do much to impress.  I'd recommend getting a sound bar or a full system but I mainly use my headset for gaming and just turn the volume up when watching tv or movies. Also it doesn't have a built in surround sound like my old Samsung.  All in all though I think this is a pretty kickass TV for the price and can even compete with some other tvs hundreds of dollars more.", "Date": "December 15, 2013"}, {"Title": "GREAT TV!

You can get all of the technical specs for it from the internet or from SONY.  The most attractive thing about this TV is the simplicity.  Since it lacks wifi the menus are ultra easy to understand and navigate.  Mine was purchased for a primary user who is over 70 years old and not too tech savvy.  He got the hang of it within 10 minutes.  Setup out of the box is very easy.  You run 2 philips screws snug in the base to attach it to the screen assembly and it is ready to go.  There are only 3 screens you see before you start to watch TV.  The first screen asks what language you prefer, the second is to set the date and time, and the last screen scans the over the air channels for self programming.  Once this is done the TV will start playing on the lowest number formerly VHF channel. The TV has the usual audio and video settings you would expect.The default settings are really good as is but you can fine tune things.  The speakers are really good for how small they are to be able to fit into the assembly.  There is no rich bass as is expected with speakers of this size.  I ran an external amplified sound system to get better sound quality.  To do this you can use the optical audio output or simply run a 3.5mm cable from the female port on the TV.  The only thing that keeps me from giving this TV 5 star is the design of the remote.  I have owned Samsung and LG TVs that were more expensive and less expensive but all of them had better remotes in terms of design and function.  The plastic the remote is made of is on the cheap side and looks sort of like X-brand electronics grade of materials.  The buttons are also on the small side and very close together.  If you have large hands this could be a problem.  Also, when you change channels you have to input a minimum of 3 characters.  You put in the main channel number, push the dot button, and enter the subchannel number.  The TV will reset from the input of buttons to the current channel within 3-5 seconds if you are not pushing a button.  The combination of the small buttons and short idle time is problematic for someone like the primary user of my TV.  Keep this in mind if you are a senior citizen.Initially I was hesitating to buy the TV because it lacked wifi but I decided I would buy an external box to stream video from services such as Netflix or Amazon.  However, if you read reviews of smart TVs you see many complaints about slow loading video, poor quality, or freezing.  This is due to processors that can not keep up with the quantity of data in HD programming.  The life expectancy of a TV is usually 4-7 years in most cases with normal use.  As data keeps growing and becomes more demanding your built in processor will become more and more obsolete.  The best alternative is a box such as Apple TV or Roku.  I will be getting an Apple TV with this Sony since that box can be used with a bluetooth keyboard I already have to input search queries instead of using a remote like a wireless mouse to click on an on screen QWERTY board.  I have had the TV a few weeks and so far so good. I will update this if something notable happens with the SONY.It should also be noted that this TV in made in Mexico and not China like the majority of the TVs on the market.

Plus the sound was good as well. The design is nice, sleek and slim (but not quiet as slim as other models).

It has an LED screen with motion flow at 120 HZ, a full 1080 picture, Bravia sync so you can depend on it communicating with other plugged in devices, and a variety of other useful stuff, such as:  the auto-wide option that enables the TV to choose the best size screen for different formats, and  digital media choices such as photo, music and video. The motion flow system makes the 60 HZ seem like 120, and is wonderful. And by the way it weighs an incredible 16 pounds and could be carried by most anyone. I hooked it up to my Direct TV box in five minutes and all was done. With all this, the price was what I would call low for any HD TV.Having listed some of the terrific features of the TV, there are some notable differences between it and my old Bravia XBR2. First - the actual screen material for the 40R450A seems to be a little less great than the XBR2.  I have Direct TV, which I've had for years, and with this TV, just once in a while it's not quite as silky a picture as was the XBR2, especially with SD, which the early Sony HD capable TV's were famous for. I would say it's at its top performance on nature shows, which to me look about as good as a picture can look. The auto-wide, as I said, is great -  I don't understand why anyone would disable it because it chooses the correct picture size/ratio for each show, and seems awfully handy. Of course you can override this, but not usually with very good results. The sound is ok, it doesn't seem to easily distort or anything, just lacks the desirable basses and full sound you will get with a sound bar, which I do recommend. I would think each person would want to choose their own picture settings, so won't bother to list my choices, but I will say I use lots of backlight and it seems to work extremely well.Overall, for the price this is an amazing TV.

The only cons I would bring up is that 1) it has limited (just 2) HDMI ports, but this is generally okay with me since I only usually hook-up a DVD player, and Satellite connection. 2)The table-top stand is pretty rickety, so secure it well to any surface with a couple of drilled screw holes (unless you simply hang it with a solid bracket on the wall). I bought a 2X4, just to give it a little more height, and srewed it into that, and then secured the board against each side of a wall it sets next to. 3) The remote is fairly primitive, so don't expect a lot, although I suppose Sony assumes you will buy a more expensive \"all-in-one\" remote, which you should definitely budget for in this case.

I hooked it up and instantly noticed that the picture isn't as crisp as my Mitsubishi, the default color settings appear overly bright and cartoonish (that was easily cleared up with a few adjustments). The first thing I turned on is game 1 of the NLDS baseball playoffs between the Reds and Pirates, I was very disappointed with Sony's XR120, it actually looks like they just printed a fancy name on the TV box and did nothing to the TV itself. The motion blur on this TV is more than abundant!

The base was easy to put together and it sturdy.  The TV itself is very light and easy to move around.  And, the price can't be beat. It is much better than TVs that cost $100-200 more (though it is not wireless nor wireless ready so be aware of this when purchasing).It is easy to set up and use.  There are little or no adjustments needed to the picture as the factory settings are very good (unlike on most other sets I have purchased). This Sony isn't a Smart TV though so for people who watch Netflix, Amazon, etc. you will need to purchase a separate adapter. This wasn't a problem for us though since this is in the bedroom where we mostly use On Demand features when not watching regular TV. Also, we have other Smart TVs in the house.  I was happy to save the money on the price by not having these features. At 40 inches it is the perfect size for a bedroom TV. This is now \"the TV with the best picture in the house\" according to my wife who has a much better eye for this than I do!  Sony has always made great TVs and this hasn't changed over the years.  Next time I need a TV, I will look at a Sony first.If this TV fits your size and use needs, you should buy it.

I bought both the 32\" and 40\" versions for my apartment because they were such a good deal! I've always been a big fan of Sony's minimalist design and high quality, and this TV series does not disappoint.While other brands' products scream \"I AM A FANCY TV - LOOK AT ME!\" Sony always does a good job of keeping things elegant and understated. In fact, the only thing on the bezel (other than SONY) is the energyStar certified logo. The controls are cleverly hidden in a recess on the back-right-hand side. This simplicity is also evident in the menu system, which is very easy to navigate, as well as the remote, which is laid out very intuitively with just the right amount of buttons.Picture quality is as good as I expected. I'm mostly streaming things off of my AppleTV, and I have no complaints of black levels or colors being off. I was very glad to see that this TV has a light sensor, which adjusts the TV brightness to the level of light in the room, as well as a digital optical audio out for my sound system. My only gripe is that there are only two HDMI inputs - one in the back and one on the side, but this seems to be par for the course in this price range.As a bonus, Sony Includes a USB port on the side, where you can plug in a thumb-drive or portable hard drive to play music, or view videos and pictures. In my testing, it worked pretty well.

I was using my PS3 for testing and even Borderlands 2 looked great during movement and fast turns.On a note that I haven't seen in reviews, the Sony controller that is supplied with the TV also works as a remote for your PS3. You can navigate the main menu, stop, pause and play your blue rays your watching on it and the whole nine yards. The only negative thing I honestly can say about this television is the high gloss screen. It reflects very badly even in a room with no windows.

I started my search looking for a tv between 36 and 45 inches for less than $500.Some tvs might have a great picture, but they are are marred by a cheap design with a flimsy frame and an unsteady stand. Out of the box Sony's 40 inch LED TV has a sexy and sleek design. The border is super thin at not even 3/4\" thick and even though its plastic it feels and looks solid. The base is also solid, it is short keeping the screen safely low to the table, and it is wide, almost as wide as the screen itself leaving no room to wobble.The picture quality is excellent when the settings are correct (guides can be found on the web). As a plus the presets can be individually customised. Once I found a setting I liked the picture has great color and contrast with pristine details. I am currently using an xbox 360 hooked up with the hd component cables that came with it, a samsung smart bluray player, and a digital antenna. They all give me equally great picture.This is not a smart tv meaning no internet and no video services but honestly this is an unnecessary extra when all of the applications I need can be found on xbox or installed to my bluray player.If you search for a professional review the only thing they complain about is the viewing angle. My tv is in the corner and when I sit  near the wall to either side the blacks arent quite as dark but it wont be noticeable to the  average person.Overall this tv is a great for anyone wanting a medium sized, great quality, inexpensive tv.", "Date": "December 27, 2013"}, {"Title": "Great TV", "Author": "Len S.", "ReviewID": "RZVULX3TRI5KO", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Easy set up - great picture - just what I was looking for in a bedroom.

Samsung may have the best picture quality but honestly, after watching some tv on my new Sony TV set, I have no complaints about picture quality at all, HD content is excellent.I also prefer the simple and elegant Sony interface over Samsung's cartoon-ish interface, and Sony tv set doesn't make annoying sound when turned on and off like Samsung tv does.If you use USB sticks to watch video like I do, it might annoy you that Sony only supports MPEG1 and MPEG2 formats, but you can always convert file-types on PC. If you already own a Blu-Ray player, it probably has a USB port that supports all kinds of file types anyways.I think 40 inch is a sweet spot for TVs, because you can either sit up close without noticing pixels on the screen, or sit far back and yet not feel like the screen size is too small.

The reason I mention all this extra information is that Sony's TV components are great and as a TV brand they are still unmatched. They are pricer than Samsung (which has nice TV's as well). You can get bigger picture TVs from brands like Sharp, Pioneer, and Vizio for the price, but Sony TV's are the top of the line...just read the amazon reviews. If price is your bottom line Sony is not the TV for you but if Quality is them look no further.

When there was a close-up of the players the picture actually looked pretty good. Colors are this TV's strong suit. However, when the teams began each play the scene was not at all good (not for an HDTV). Players were out of focus and colors looked \"strained\". If you set at least 9 to 10 feet away from the screen the ill effects lessen ... you could probably deal with it. But my thought was why the heck should I? I spent only a hundred and fifty bucks more and bought an LG 47LN5700. The difference is night and day. Without exaggeration I have never seen a better picture. I haven't even had to change the factory settings. This is a \"smart\" TV but if you do not want to get involved with those extra features you don't have to. The picture is simply spectacular.

Since this the elapsed from purchase to problem diagnosis, Sony will on swap it out with a refurb only!  Amazon won't allow a return because of the time lapsed either.  I will never buy a Sony again, and am thinking about returning my Pioneer receiver to Amazon too.  This whole ordeal has been a nightmare!  I bought this Sony over a Vizio because I thought they sold quality products.  Wrong!  And to make matters worst, the CS sucks too!  I will simply purchase from Costco from here on out.  The few dollars I saved with Amazon and Sony was simply no worth effing hassles!12/4/13 UPDATE:  After speaking to Sony's \"Customer Relations\" they asked that I fax a copy of my receipt to them.  I scanned and emailed it along with a prolonged explanation.  Two days later they just called and said they are going to send me a new tv along with a return label for an old one!  I bumped my review up to three stars because of this and assuming the new tv works properly I might bump it up to 4.  Actually, I like the picture quality and the slim design, but this has been a frustrating ordeal.12/14/13 Update:  I finally received my replacement TV.  However, between Sony and FedEx, it did not arrive when my initial notification stated it would, therefore I burned time off work waiting for it.  Of course switching out the two TVs was a hassle since my first one was mounted on the wall.  Additionally, the return packaging was a PIA.  Their detailed instructions were for not.  Their glued-up multi-piece foam rubber pieces that were hot-melted together fell apart, therefore it was a frustrating jigsaw puzzle packing this up.  I have it ready to return to FedEx and hope it arrives safe and sound so Sony doesn't charge my credit card.  I am tempted to bump this down to two stars but at least Sony gave me a new TV.  However, the whole 3 month ordeal has been a nightmare!  BTW, I noticed this TV is made in Mexico.  I would not buy this TV again.", "Date": "December 2, 2013"}, {"Title": "Excellent TV !

I have found that if i \"wait approximately a minute\"  and go ahead and start loading the blu ray player but still stay on tv input  BEFORE switching to HDMI 1 input that i can sometimes see the previews and pop up menu BUT with some discs (i.e. Jack the Giant Slayer and Phantom of the Opera 1943 for example) even when i do that  when i finally enter \"play\" to begin the actual movie i once again get sound but no picture and have to again toggle through the inputs or turn tv set off and back on & since the blu - ray player is still playing when i do this i then finally see the actual movie. THIS IS NUTS!. I have owned the set for over 3 months and have primarily used it for cable and watching many standard dvd films with a different dvd player using the tv's composite input and everything has acted normally (sound is fairly mediocre though). I recently started purchasing more BLU - Ray discs and have to go through this \"ordeal\" with many of them (even though this same player acts normal with an older bravia). So i am therefore thinking it is something to do with this newest Sony tv. I have a large film  & music library and with standard dvd players have had the great option of using the repeat feature on the remote to have the film or music videos play continuously (video \"wallpaper\"). It seems that this great option is being either dropped from many blu - ray players and/or the blu - ray discs themselves often wont allow \"repeat\" although many standard dvds and players do allow repeat. Thats a shame. I didnt totally figure out this blu - ray playback \"quirk\" till after my warranty has expired a short while ago since i didnt have alot of blu ray discs and i thought at first it was the player acting \"goofy\" but now i think its the tv acting \"goofy\".

Initially had some buffering problem for the youtube app, but all the other apps worked fine. Yesterday the tv hanged, and was not opening any app saying not connected to internet (\"ERROR_MODEL_BIND\"). I had 2 laptops and a smartphone connected to internet without any problem, and tried with LAN connection too! Nothing worked. Called up Amazon support who were very helpful in diagnosing and then they forwarded to Samsung tech support who just said the problem is with internet provider. I decided to return the Samsung TV.Now i had to have a new TV immediately. Thought of buying higher 40\" model from Samsung/LG (with dual core processors). Headed to Frys today. There, they took me to compare Samsung 40\" 5300 and Sony40\" KDL 450A with two USB sticks. USB sticks had some pictures, including the one multiple shades of each color. The photos looked stunningly accurate in Sony, but was not accurate in Samsung. for the different shades, samsung seemed to have color blindness while the Sony showed the colors differently! Wow! They suggested i but a blue ray player + Sony KDL450A so that can get good TV + dedicated player for streaming/media. I had not thought about that! Said lemme do some research and get back! by 6:30 in the evening today i went back and bought Sony KDL450A(Frys have a good discount on this model, ~50$ less than next best price in the internet) + Sony BDP-S5100 blue ray player. Was very happy that i got a good deal.Came home, hooked up the new TV. My kid was watching Pingu on Samsung 5300 (through youtube, it occasionally works now), and I put Pingu on the new Sony TV through Sony blue ray player's youtube app. Lo!! The picture looked washed on Sony! There were pixelations here and there. Samsung had better smooth picture, while Sony's was grainy and washed. I spent more than an hour to change settings on the Sony TV and blue ray player to get a better picture! nothing worked. Tried different videos on both the TVs - a movie, music video etc. Everywhere, Sony's clarity was bad compared to Samsungs! Sony had better sharpness, but looks like the video processing engine is not good in Sony! So it will be going back to Frys soon. Samsung is returning to Amazon tomorrow.

In all fairness I only installed it last night and haven't read through the full manual. In 2008 the HD technology was still new and had not been adopted by the majority so it may just be that the Sharp was somehow optimized for use without it, while today's tvs assume most people have it so they don't bother? An HD antenna will be my next purchase to see if this TV can be improved. I really hope it helps as so far it's been a disappointing win.Update -As some have educated me now, all of these tvs are LCD, it's just the backlighting being done by LED. Anyway I did get an HDMI cable and it improved picture quality tremendously. I'd stick to my original review in that you don't want to buy this TV if you don't have some sort of HD capability, the picture is just unwatchable without the HDMI cable.Also want to add that I've noticed a strange habit of the TV...There is a horizontal rolling effect going on sometimes...like being underwater. maybe a techie here can shed some light on that.
