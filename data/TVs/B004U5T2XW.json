It has a fantastic picture, lots of great apps, the remote is great, everything about it is fantastic - except for one thing: the TV is unwatchable.This TV has a major firmware flaw. When the TV encounters a significant scene change, particularly if the scene change involves a sudden, black image, the TV turns itself off. Pulling the power cord for a few seconds to reset the TV fixes it for a while - but the problem eventually returns. Watching a Blu-Ray disc is impossible - the TV turns itself off almost every 30 seconds or so. It happens when watching something via HDMI, it even happens (less frequently) when watching something on the internal built-in Netflix app. Obviously there is a firmware problem in the code that is decoding and displaying the image - I suspect when an exception happens in this code, the TV turns itself off.Doing a Google search for \"M550SV\" and \"turns off\" you can see that this is not an uncommon problem - it's quite widespread. It is also happening to the M420SV, the 42 inch version of this TV. Repeated calls to Vizio customer support result in denial of any known problem, and claims that it must be \"power related\" - telling me to go buy a surge suppressor (I already have one on the TV). When I pressed them on the issue, they agreed to send a repairman to my house to \"replace the power supply.\"Replacing the power supply is not going to fix a firmware problem. The problem can be easily demonstrated by playing a pre-recorded video that makes the TV turn off at the same spot every time, as I demonstrate in this video.Unfortunately, as much as I love this TV, I am going to have to return it. I cannot live with such a major fault. And while I have purchased (and recommended to others) Vizio TV's (as well as other products) before, the replacement for this TV is not going to be a Vizio. What a shame.", "Date": "June 7, 2011"}, {"Title": "Nice product and everything is working well...", "Author": "Kenneth E. Lenard", "ReviewID": "R2MLSZYHB28MZU", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I received this TV on Friday 6/17 after a lot of nail-biting because of the power/firware issue mentioned by a few other people.  First off, the TV is very slim and the picture on it is very good.  I am still futzing with the picture options but I think I have everything set the way I like.  I have it connected via HDMI to a Comcast DVR and also an XBOX 360 (also via HDMI) and everything is good there.  Also, I was able to get the unit very snug to the wall using a PYLE PSW598UT wall mount (also from Amazon).  I have a recessed power outlet behind the TV and all of the cables are hidden and it looks really nice being such a thin TV and then having it right up against the wall.  The TV was on a lot today and never shut itself off.  I also got the TV to recognize my wireless router and I played with the apps a little bit.  The remote is a bit clunky but I like the way it works.  The only issue I have with it is the sound, which is okay but not great.  I changed the audio settings and equalizer settings (I set it to ROCK which seems to have the most bass).  But as I went between the unit that this one replaced (a 50\" Samsung which is now in a different room) I noticed that the audio on the Samsung is MUCH better than the Vizio.  The 37\" Vizio I own had sound that was so bad that I had to by a soundbar for it.  I don't think I'll need one for this 55\", but it's always possible I'll get one.  I will update this review as pros and cons come up but at this point, I'm liking it.** UPDATE **I have been playing with the video settings on the TV for the past four days & watching quite a bit of baseball, news and other HD content.  I don't know if everyone will benefit from this, but after looking at the various settings, the best combination seems to be:SMOOTH MOTION  :  MEDCINEMA MODE  :  SMOOTHNOISE REDUCTION  :  LOWMPEG NR  :  OFFCOLOR ENHANCEMENT  :  RICH COLORADAPTIVE LUMA  :  LOWFILM MODE  :  AUTOSMART DIMMING  :  OFFAMBIENT LIGHT SENSOR:  OFFI like the screen bright and everyone in my house agrees with that.  The smart dimming plus the ambient light sensor both being off along with the picture mode set to VIVID makes for a pretty bright screen but I like it.  I will admit right now that I do not know what all of these things do so I just played with the settings until I thought I had the best picture for me.  Also, the 50\" plasma that was in this space before had a better viewing angle.  It was bright, crisp and clear from angles and across the room.  This one is very good from directly in front of the screen and although it's okay from angles, it's noticeably darker which is why I keep the picture settings bright.  I have not changed the other video settings at all (BRIGHTNESS, CONTRAST, SHARPNESS, etc).  The TV has stayed powered on and has not surprised us by turning itself off or anything else.", "Date": "June 17, 2011"}, {"Title": "Just a couple of features away from delighting me...", "Author": "David St Thomas \"Student\"", "ReviewID": "R1W4HVZHSR9CL3", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Overall I enjoy the Vizio M550SV TV. I bought it at Costco at the end of the model year for $1199. They just now have a coupon deal for $200 off and I went back and got the additional savings. Even though the new models are just about to come out, for just under a grand this TV is a smokin' deal. I added the extended Square Trade warranty for $59.99 and so I have 5 years of total coverage, to boot.Add what I wrote to other owner's comments - basically, it's just a good TV that does what you want it to do. It's not the very best, just the very best for the money. It's also an attractive set without some of the flashy distracting bright silver styling accents that Vizio has used in the past.The reason I'm adding my review to the mix is just to let potential buyers know a couple of things that I've discovered.1.) Updates to firmwareThis is an internet TV. Updates to firmware come through periodically over the internet. This process is automatic. You are notified at power-on when this occurs. You must have the TV connected to the internet to get these updates. You need a wireless or a wired connection. I use a wired connection and have not used the wireless option. Updates to firmware include new VIA apps, functional improvements to the TV itself, as well as updates to the apps.2.) PIPThis is one of the prime reasons I had to buy this TV. It's a hard feature to find nowadays. I think the advent of time-shifting via Tivo devices and their ilk has rendered it less useful for most people, but since I use the QAM tuner in the TV to watch basic cable from Comcast in Boulder, Co., I find value in using PIP to \"power watch\" more than one channel at once.Yes, this set has PIP, and POP is also pretty useful. PIP puts the second picture inside the main picture, and PIP puts them next to each other. POP distorts (squeezes) the two pictures side-by-side to fit them on the screen. It's not too pretty, but it gets the job done. Since the TV has a single tuner, the second source must come from somewhere else, and this is basically going to be one of the HDMI inputs.My previous TV was a Sony XBR that had a great POP option. The TV had two tuners, and the remote had hot buttons to swap audio/control/source between the two pictures. This was great for \"power watching\". The M550SV has no such hot buttons and requires you to go back into the menuing system to switch audio and this is laborious and takes time. So if you're trying to watch something over on another channel during a time-out during a football game, it's tougher to get back to the game quickly as the timeout is ending. That's just an example of what I am calling \"power-watching\". Maybe not many people do that. I would have GREATLY preferred that Vizio gave me a couple of hot buttons on the remote to control PIP/POP toggle rather than the ludicrous and colorful Amazon/Netflix/Vudu Via app hot buttons. These are basically of small use to me, since the VIA button gets you to the full range of apps and remembers the last one you used. With just a bit more thought, Vizio could have hit PIP/POP out of the park, but I guess beggars can't be choosers.3.) QAM/ATSC tunerThe QAM tuner allows you to access the basic cable digital channels. You just connect your cable to the rear of the set and scan your cable channels. The ATSC tuner allows you receive Digital broadcast stations with an antenna. As far as I know, all standard TVs come with this feature today.If you use a cable or satellite DVR connected via HDMI, you will never see this, at least not for now. If you ever decide to dump your premium service and go back to basic or use an antenna via the ATSC tuner component then you will care about this.The QAM tuner works well, and the only thing I wish it had were a \"favorites\" section. Comcast still gives me all my basic cable channels, but other than local Denver/Broomfield broadcast stations, the channels such as WGN, Discovery, TBS, etc., are located at funky locations such as 79-2. It would be great to be able to assign both a label to these channels (so you know what they are) and also put them in a table of favorites that could be selected via the remote. Again, with just a little more attention to detail, Vizio (or whoever designs their stuff) could have hit this out of the park. I realize I'll have to live with it.The only problem I've run into is that one channel, TBS comes up on the M550SV with picture, but no sound. I suspect this has to be a Comcast issue, as it's a single channel out of dozens. I have a couple of old Panasonic DVRs that have QAM tuners and they get TBS sound and picture, both. And at the same channel assignment as the Vizio. But the Panasonic tuners are different and receive some channels in mysteriously different assignments - most noticeably two of the three PBS stations coming out of Broomfield. I know, because I have seen, that Comcast is constantly jacking around with the signal mix coming through the cable - channels go away and come back. So maybe the TBS issue will clear up in time - I don't have the temperament to try and deal with Comcast customer service and if I want to watch TBS I can just use one of the DVRs. It's a bizarre problem. I don't imagine I'd get far with Vizio customer service with this, so I won't bother.4.) VIA AppsThe VIA apps work OK. The Netflix app works well. I much prefer the ROKU with its remote to the Vizio app with its remote for controlling Netflix. But the Netflix picture coming over the VIA app is high quality. There is a Skype app, which I would like to have, but it requires a costly webcam sold by VIzio and apparently no other unit will work. Kinda dumb,  and they don't seem to be selling many of these.I'd love to have a VERY BASIC web app on the set just to quickly access the web once in a while to save me the trip upstairs to my office - I don't have a wireless tablet lying about, yet...Apps like Twitter seem to offer minimal control and this is frustrating to me.5.) The remote control.This works well, but it is small and the buttons are hard to learn. Vizio tried to fit a lot of buttons into the smallest space possible for some reason. You can find pictures of this online, search \"M550SV REMOTE\". You can see how it is laid out and that most of the buttons are the same size and close together. I like to learn a remote and use it in a dark room from memory/feel. Let me tell you, this remote will take a long time to learn at my stage of life where I seem to forget as fast as I learn when I don't use something every single day.The keypad remote on the back of the remote works OK, and it's as tricky to use as any small keypad. It can really be handy setting up the apps and doing the initial setup of the TV.6.) Picture setup.The picture setup as provided is unacceptable.I worked with a blu-ray calibration disc and have found these to be a reasonable starting point for picture tuning.Your preferences may be very different.Picture mode: STANDARDBrightness: 53Contrast: 62Color: 49Tint: -3Sharpness: 8Color Temperature: CUSTOMAuto-dim is handy, but I turn off or set to LOW all of the other advanced compensators (Motion flow, etc.).You really don't need these, but watch a variety of things (movies, and sports) and see what you think.The menuing/setup system is painless, and I suggest you explore every option of the entire menu system to fully set up your TV.I can''t recall all of what I did, but certain things like turning off the lighted VIZIO logo on the frame are things I definitely wanted to do.----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------I hope this information, in addition to the other reviews, is helpful to some shoppers/owners.", "Date": "March 9, 2012"}, {"Title": "Best Value in an HD TV", "Author": "AlanD", "ReviewID": "RVHNHEMMX0X82", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I picked up this TV at my Walmart and am just THRILLED with it. The picture and clarity are amazing (you'll be blown away if you watch a blu-ray disk on it.) It's priced at least 200 dollars less than other more known brand equivalent TVs.Stand assembly was easy (they even INCLUDE a phillips head screwdriver in case you don't have one).I'm still having fun playing with all the Internet Apps on the toolbar (new apps are sent to your TV automatically.)  The remote control is cool, with a standard setup on one side, and a QWERTY keyboard on the other.One caution:The set I purchased had a power issue, it turned itself off occasionally.  I called Vizio tech support (they're located in South Dakota). Within a week at no charge two men arrived at my door to pick up the defective TV and deliver and assemble my new one which has worked perfectly for the last month. I could not have been more impressed.Friends of mine who own Sony and Samsung TV's cant believe the picture!I'm so pleased with my purchase.", "Date": "June 16, 2011"}, {"Title": "This is a great TV", "Author": "Tom  Halvorson", "ReviewID": "R26P348C0UMX3", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "For me and my family this TV is darn near perfect. We upgraded from a 53\" Panasonic projection that we've had for almost 12 years. Right out of the box I got it hooked up and working fairly quickly (with some goofs on my part hooking up the surround system, Direct TV and the Bluray). But once it was set up, I was blown away. It's a bit of a shock going from 60hz to 240hz. After previewing a few movies I could see what I have been missing all this time. Some do not like the increased frame rate and turn that off. But for us, it is almost too surreal how everything looks. After popping in the first Lord of the Rings movie, it was incredible the detail that came out of the grass and the foliage. A well done movie will look real. Others, will obviously look fake which is the slight downfall of such a sharp image. But there, I blame Hollywood rather than the TV. The colors are good, good shading and blacks, though I can see where some would have issues with this. I tend not to look for details in dark objects, but I guess some do. The matte screen is a blessing as we have a very brightly lit room and this TV has nearly no reflection from sunlight or other off-light sources. The menus are pretty easy to navigate, I haven't had any issues as of yet that others have experienced. I was hoping not and have been very please with the performance of this TV. My issues, which are very minor, have to do with the remote. Its good, not great, as the QWERTY keyboard is on the flip side of the remote and not a slide out like on other remotes out there. And for some reason while using the keyboard you still have to point it at the TV like a remote which make typing rather awkward when your facing the screen directly.

I have owned several Vizio TV's now and have Never had a Problem. Which has not been the case of so many others I Have talked to about thier purchases. Several Friends have purchased various other brands in the last few years and at least half have had major problems occur shortly after the warrenty period.Now for the Details.I can not imagine a better picture when fed a True HD signal (although even Most Non HD DVD's Look Great) . It may require a little tweeking of the settings to adjust to Your liking but it will perform.But as is the Case with ALL Large True HD TV's, Non HD material is going to leave a LOT to be desired. I knew this going into the world of Large 1080P TV's. That Older TV material and lower grade feeds like a VCR or older game consoles are going to kinda look like Crap. There is Sadly No way around it. For those of us Old enough to now how bad TV could be when an antenna signal was to weak on UHF stations this wont be to much of a problem. But Younger Purchasers who have only known cable might be put off.As with so many new sets you have to turn off the (in this case the \"Smooth motion effect\") setting found under the advanced setting of picture. It will drive you Nuts. For more on this look up Soap opera effect on google to learn more.I have NO idea why they even have this effect since I have NEVER been able to watch anything from any source that it didnt ruin the viewing of.Now for the \"So I would buy this TV Again but I wish this was Better\" Stuff.The Remote for this TV Sucks.  No way around it. You dont buy a TV for the Remote but you will spend a LOT of time holding it and Sadly this one should be better. But Do not Fear. I spent a day or two shaking my head, Thinking.... Wow. they had such nice, easy to use Remotes on the older sets. Who designed this one, and how he Should be Fired for such Junk engineering. when I thought Gee, I wounder if the Old Remote will work on this TV..... YUP it did.  Not only did it work but it was able to do things that the included new one couldnt. Stuff they for some reason thought you woudnt want?like screen down sizing. which comes in VERY handy when you want to watch something you have from the old days like a converted VHS TO DVD family movie that looks like crap on the full screen but gets MUCH better when down sized to half screen. or ability to just push a button to go to tv or hdmi verses this included remotes need to go to a screen and scroll down and pick an input, or freeze the picture. All of which you can do if you get ahold of an older remote.I could go on about how the buttons are small and in bad places or how the remote has no hourglass shape to hold onto, but I think the point is made.So moving on.  Inputs. Didnt keep me from setting up the TV, But WHY in the world are they Not centered on the back of the unit. and facing down. Rather than being high up on the left side and facing out. You need an extra Foot and a half of HDMI cable to just plug in no matter how you are using the TV. I (as I expect MANY Really do) have the TV set up on a TV entertainment center Table using its base. (Wall mounting seems great till you Really thing about it and the wireing and moving options)Even still you want the inputs to be in the most central location for the shortest and least amount of cable clutter behind the unit.Also this unit ONLY has 1 Component/AV input. In my case I had to use an AV switching block to connect the NON HDMI units that we wanted to use. (XBOX, Game Cube, Ect) I understand that they are thinking forward on this stuff, But there are still a Lot of Recent things that still only use AV inputs.But I did in the end manage to get everything working if with a little effort, so I cant Dis to much.So, Pick this TV for the Picture Qaulity, Longevity, and Price. But Live with the Bad Remote and Poor input location and choices. (but find an older Vizio remote... Vur5 I think is the model) and you Shouldnt be disapointed.", "Date": "February 5, 2012"}, {"Title": "Amazing!", "Author": "Jessica Shaver \"iblvn4him\"", "ReviewID": "R2WDSPA2MSQAJF", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "We purchased this tv and absolutely love it.

This model gives more future and options for what I paid for, but not losing out on the picture quailty.  Now as you all know it is hard to compare picture quallity between TVS at any stores because I=they dont have the settings equality and the inputs are not all HD.  Unlike some buyers posted that they have shut down issues, we watched it for hours after I have installed on the wall did not have have any issue at all.  We watch BluRay, and DirecTV both standard and HD, the TV did not shut down at all.  PEOPLE, THERE ARE LOWER RATINGS HDMI CABLES!!!!  The picture quality is the best so far.  As for the sound, its better than my old LCD, and besides all LCD TVs sound quality sucks due to limit of space in the tv to put speakers.  At 240HZ, LED Lit, built in WiFI and Web Apps for less than hundreds even 1000s dollars less than other brands or models, you can not bet or compare.  For $200 more, you can get the 480HZ with 3d glasses included, which I dont care about.

Jenks \"Banaltra\"", "ReviewID": "RNZQD2C0QFOV5", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I bought this TV last year right after Christmas. I had read the reviews at that time about the picture black out problem. It SUPPOSEDLY was being addressed through firmware updates. Well, in February I called Vizio to tell them about the ongoing picture blackout. I will say at this point that the Customer Service reps are all very well trained and polite people. And in all honesty I let this go on too long. But every agent that I spoke with had something new that I needed to try before anything could be done. This was as basic as watching to see if the light went off on the front to having to put a mirror BEHIND the TV to see if the light went off. This last step came about because my TV sits up on a mantle and I could not climb up and observe this before the picture returned. (Let me add that I was forced to take the TV off the wall mount AND remove a wood frame that had been built around the TV itself to accomplish all that Vizio required me to do.) So they sent a technician out who replaced the powerboard and the motherboard. An hour after he left the exact same problem began again. So did the phone calls to Vizio. Now they sent out a \"recertified\" TV. According to the CS rep, this is a new TV that has been bought back from a store like Costco or Walmart. They said that the TV would only be opened to be checked out by Vizio. So the TV was delivered and set up and seemed to work fine while the delivery person was there. After he left we turned off the TV, went out for a little while and came home. When we attempted to turn on the TV, it would not power on. The only way we could turn on the TV was to unplug it and plug it back in. So once again I called Vizio. Let me interject that we are now into August. And once again a \"new\" TV was delivered and the old one picked up. And once again the TV picture would black out. So another call to Vizio who now felt that the problem was on my end and possibly related to my cable. It did not seem to matter that we had run the TV through our BluRay player or Apple TV when the cable was not hooked up at all to the TV. Again the technician came out and replaced the power and mother boards as well as checked our equipment to be sure there was not a problem on our end...which there was not. Again I called Vizio and this time was told that I would receive a replacement model of equal or greater value but that it had to be approved. The next thing I received was a telephone call requesting my original receipt from Amazon. Luckily I had kept it so I was able to email it to them. (I really do not thing that they were expecting me to have it.) So now I have been told that I will be receiving a refund AFTER they have received the TV. Apparently they do not trust me to return to the TV but I am supposed to trust them to send me a check in 3-4 weeks after 9 months, 22+ phone calls and uncounted hours on the phone with them. Originally they were sending me a prepaid label and were expecting me to take this 55\" monstrosity to a mailing site but saw the unwiseness in this and will be sending someone out to box it and pick it up. So that will take a week off my waiting time. I do not know about you but I do not have an extra $1500 sitting around to be able to go out and replace the TV while I wait for the new one. So I get to go through the prime football and holiday season waiting for Vizio to get around to refunding me MY money. I feel I was more than patient and understanding throughout this long, tedious, ridiculous situation.

After being put on hold, he came back and apologized that the guide function has been removed from Vizios, and that the owner's manuals have not been updated. The reason given is that most viewers use cable and satellite guides, so they discontinued that function. That doesn't make much sense, with so many people still watching over-the-air broadcasts.A quick Internet search found that Vizio lost a lawsuit with the provider of that function, and were forced to stop installing it.

The large problem is that the sound cut out on us. Every time we turn on the tv, we have no sound. If we wait sometimes the sound begins to come in slowly (on and off until it is on all the way). Sometimes it never comes on at all and we have to turn off the tv and start over and HOPE that the sound would come back on. We're looking into getting it fixed but we'll see. The other problem is the all-in-one controller. NEVER lose your remote or you will pay dearly. The first time I tried to manually turn on the television, the knob fell off. The controls on the actual television appear to be an afterthought. Luckily the remote that came with it is great. Hope you don't have similar problems with the sound.", "Date": "December 11, 2011"}, {"Title": "Fantastic! ...cept one minor detail.", "Author": "LucidLegend", "ReviewID": "R3BOMSSSST70OM", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This is a great LED TV.

After contacting my dsl service provider, I figured out they were not the problem.  So, I contacted Vizio and they figured out it was the television that needed to be repaired.  Since I have had the tv just over a year, it would not be covered under warranty.  Vizio said the work would cost 301.00 to repair the t.v.  I paid almost 1600.00 when I bought my tv brand new.  Save yourself the money and trouble, and buy a tv from respected brand that has been around for a while.  You may read other reviews where people say they love their vizio.
