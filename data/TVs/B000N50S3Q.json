{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Nice but could be better", "Author": "Mike Hall", "ReviewID": "R168JHF8GHWJU4", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I'm not an expert reviewer but a reasonably knowledgeable electronics consumer.  Here are my observations from a week's use of the LNT3253H. I won't repeat the specifications and the like that you can find most anywhere. I suspect that some of what I say is applicable to other panel sizes in the 2007 53 series.A successor to last year's popular 51 series, the 53 is really more of an updated version of 2006's highly rated LNS3296 with a little more contrast and one more HDMI port and a USB port.  (I was told by Samsung customer service, 1-800-726-7864, that the successors to the latter line will be 1080p.)PROSSharp picture with vibrant color in HD.  Subjectively:  when viewing HD feeds in the showroom, the 2006 version of the Sony Bravia XBR has better picture processing than this model, and the 2007 Toshiba Regza is comparable to the LNT3253.Very high quality panel with no dead pixels.  It is said that Sony and Samsung LCD panels come from the same Samsung plant.  My set was manufactured (probably assembled) in Mexico.Uses the desirable Cold Cathode Fluorescent Lamp (CCFL) according to Samsung customer service.Nice contrast; I was told by many people, though, that dynamic contrast has a bit of marketing hype to it so just don't buy an LCD model because the dynamic contrast is slightly better than a competitor's.  Sony avoids talking about it and their Bravia sets produce excellent pictures.2 RF inputs, one for antenna and the other for cable/satellite.  Competitors I've seen don't have that feature in their 2007 32\" sets.Digital tuner is high quality; very sensitive.  Let me clarify that the digital ATSC tuner will receive analog NTSC signals.  That's not entirely clear from the product specs, and competitors usually indicate their tuners are ATSC/NTSC/QAM.  This HDTV does all of that.Remote is logical and easy to use; better than the 2007 Regza's (I didn't compare it to the Sony's).  Nice that the Samsung recognizes input sources and allows one button scrolling through connected ones rather than having to go to a menu.  Don't know if source labeling or picture settings by source are available.Audio:  pretty typical, meaning not superb but adequate.For the most part, a well-engineered and elegant set with nice touches, like unobtrusive function buttons in the front (some other manufacturers like Sharp and Toshiba just don't get it that some sets will go into tight spaces like cabinets; they put the on-board function buttons on the top or side of the unit--how inconvenient).CONSThe single pedestal stand is a nice piece of engineering but could not be securely fastened to the set I purchased, so it was wobbly and, worse, made the set noticeably sag to one side.  I checked two other display units in electronics stores and discovered that they did wobble.  Other 32\" sets from Sony, Sharp, and Toshiba, while not capable of turning on their pedestals, are solidly anchored.  I don't know whether it's a design or manufacturing flaw -- or both.720p resolution, 8 ms response time, and 10-bit processing. Most experts seem to think there's really no discernable difference in 32\" sets between 720p and 1080p at typical viewing distances of 8 to 10 feet. I disagree; there is a difference to my eyes.  Eight ms response is good, but 6 ms is better for action scenes.  Samsung touts 10-bit processing on last year's 96 series models, but not on this one (which Samsung customer service confirmed to me it has).  Perhaps that's because competitors are upping the ante with 14-bit and better processing.Blacks are not as black as they should be on this set, and most annoying, there is some residual image on occasion.  The test:  MGM's lion logo goes immediately to black for about a second before a program begins.  On my 19\" Samsung Synchmaster LCD, the black stays black after the logo disappears.  Same thing on my 12 year-old Panasonic direct-view (CRT) 32\" set.  Not so on this set; a residual reverse image of the MGM logo lingers on the black screen.Legacy analog from over-the-air analog broadcasting and VCR is substantially lower quality than on my analog set.  I know that Samsung claims its engine helps make analog pictures look sharper, and they do when DNIe is turned on, but they're still disappointing when compared to a quality analog set.  (Digital broadcasts and DVDs are fine; I use the excellent Sony DVP-NS75H upscaling DVD player.)An audio nit:  My old Panasonic TV allowed control of the sound level output and muting of the home theater receiver from its remote.  This set's remote does not do that, requiring the use of the receiver's remote for volume control and muting.  The Samsung's is supposed to be universal, though, and might be programmed to do so.  Another nit:  Muting is not 100% complete.  There was slight sound leakage in all muting situations (both from the remote and \"internal muting\") on my set.  It seemed like Lilliputians had taken up residence inside the set.NOTESYou can turn off the obtrusive (to me) bottom blue light if desired from the menu.Samsung has some info on their website about the unit, including the product manual (very nice--why can't competitors do something this simple and helpful?).The power cord is detachable from the set (yes!).  It's three-pronged, with a grounding prong (reflects Samsung's monitor heritage?).A brief note about size for those of you changing from old-style analog direct-view sets to an LCD like this.  A 32\" analog set is a 4:3 ratio set; while a 32\" HDTV LCD set is \"widescreen\" at the theater-like 16:9 ratio.  What this means in practice is:  on your old analog set some DVDs and broadcast HDTV programs are centered on the set with black bars at the top and bottom (some DVD players will allow you to \"zoom\" and crop the picture to fill up the set, but you lose program's side action).  They should fit just fine in your new LCD, though.  Analog content that fills up the screen of your old analog 32\" set is centered with black bars at the sides on your new LCD set.  In effect, with older content, it's like watching a program on a 26\" set, not a 32\" set, according to the experts.  I hope this isn't too confusing.  The bottom line for me:  when replacing a 32\" analog set, think about going to a larger 37\" or 40\" LCD set if your budget and shelving can manage it.I discovered that my AmEx and Master Charge extend the in-home parts and labor service warranty for an additional year; my Visa does not, so it might be a good idea to check with your credit card company prior to purchase.There were a few issues with the LNT3253H that surfaced during the week that I owned it.  I strongly recommend thoroughly previewing (kicking the tires, as it were and checking your preferences) this or any other large screen TV before buying it from any online retailer (BTW, it seems that most of them will not accept returns).  You may wish to check with Amazon customer service to find out exactly what the return and refusal policies are, since, as many of you know, once you hit the \"buy\" button you may get the dreaded \"your order is being processed, you can't make any changes\" message if you change your mind.The set and box are not heavy and can be handled reasonably well by one person.", "Date": "April 14, 2007"}, {"Title": "From an LCD-HDTV first-timer...", "Author": "Steve R", "ReviewID": "R3RPQJJSAIBLU1", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I bought this set a week ago, after our 11-year-old, 32-inch, JVC tube TV shorted out. I'd had plenty of experience with LCD computer screens but I'd never really experienced anything but tube TV before. So, although I did plenty of homework before buying the Samsung, it's been a week of learning a LOT of new stuff. Here's what this newbie has learned so far, which will probably be helpful mostly for those who have yet to venture into the land of LCD and HDTV.THE TV ITSELF:Although the Samsung was my among my top picks after doing the research, when I saw it on the wall at Best Buy, the decision was pretty much made. Although I know the stores crank up the brightness and contrast, I figure if they do it for all the sets they have, then you're still on a relatively level playing field. And the picture on the Samsung stood out from the others like a diamond in a mound of charcoal. Rich contrast, sharp resolution, bright without being glaring. (We settled on the 32-inch because our family room is tiny and we are not more than five or six feet away from the screen. Standing that close to the larger sets was kind of overwhelming.)When I got it home I wasn't disappointed, and found the same qualities in the set I purchased as the store model. It was fairly simple to hook up to my cable box and DVD player, and I was watching TV within half an hour. Everything was pretty intuitive, which is good because I am NOT a read-the-directions kind of guy. And the piano-black casing is stunning, although, as another reviewer mentioned, the stand can be a bit wobbly. Be very careful if you have little ones who like to mount furniture.There is a variety of settings for picture and sound quality (including an equalizer mode). The sound is adequate but not dazzling. However, for movies and concerts, I usually channel the sound through my DVD player anyway. I was especially happy to find effective settings to adjust screen brightness for ambient room light, because our family room has a huge wall of windows that make the room extremely bright, so much so that on brilliant sunny days, our old tube TV was almost unwatchable. So far, I've yet to see any conditions in which I can't see the LCD screen perfectly.Overall, the Samsung seems to deliver well on its promises, but what impressed me most (again, keep in mind I'm a newbie here) was the picture on HD channels. It's simply amazing. I was watching a baseball game in HD the other day and they showed a slow-motion replay of a player sliding into second base. You could see every grain of dirt on the base path. The definition is mind-boggling. However...THE LCD/HD EXPERIENCE...Though I was most impressed with the HD picture, I was also disappointed in the non-HD resolution. I guess the most important thing I can impart to other newbies is this... LCD/HD sets are really made for high-definition broadcasting. On those channels (which now make up maybe five percent of my cable company's offerings) the picture is superb. On all the other channels broadcasting in standard format, however, the image appears in a standard-format square on your new wide screen, and the resolution (which used to be great on the tube TV) is actually pretty poor, depending on what you're watching. Additionally, keep in mind that the full-screen image on your tube TV will be much smaller on a wide-screen TV of the same size. Both the Samsung and my cable box have options for changing the picture size, so that you can expand the square image to fit the wide-screen format. But this only distorts the image and can make it even blurrier while cutting off a significant portion of the picture. Also, there's not a lot of standardization in the way different stations format their picture: most are just in 4:3; some are in \"wide screen/letter box\" but it doesn't fill the whole TV screen, it just appears as a rectangle picture surrounded by a larger black rectangle; and some that are in full-wide-screen mode still leave a black strip at the top and bottom of the screen. I'm considering getting the cable company's \"HD Tier\" package just so I'll have more HD channels to watch, even though the programming isn't all that spectacular.So, if you're considering this Samsung as your first foray into the world of HD, I think you'll be impressed. But be prepared to sacrifice size and quality on your non-HD channels (and there are MANY), and don't think that when you bring the set home, suddenly those \"I Love Lucy\" reruns on TVLand will be in stunning wide-screen high-definition clarity. It doesn't work that way. In fact, it works the OTHER way. The HD capabilities just bring out the flaws in broadcasts that were never meant for HD.Hope this helps.", "Date": "July 27, 2007"}, {"Title": "Excellent HD TV, But Requires High Quality Video Feed", "Author": "Buddy S", "ReviewID": "R1N72RS96D131T", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This TV is capable of producing outstanding video, but it demands a very high quality video feed (HD source through an HDMI cable) to perform up to its full potential.  The video adjustments also require considerable tweaking to achieve optimum performance.I have owned my Samsung 32\" HDTV (model LNT3253H) for about six weeks.  The TV is connected to a Comcast HD Motorola cable box with an HDMI cable.  The HD video quality is excellent and the standard definition TV video quality is surprisingly good.  It is important to note that these results were achieved only after a good deal of tweaking with the video adjustments.  I usually avoid looking at instructions, but I found that this is one product where reading the Owner's Instructions was very helpful.  There are a large number of possible adjustments, including some that I had never heard of before.  These include Gamma, Color Space, White Balance, Edge Enhancement and Digital Natural Image Engine (DNIe).  The Instructions explain what each adjustment does and the on screen Menu permits you to see the effect of each adjustment on the fly, as the adjustments are made.  There are also a large number of video source inputs, including 3 HDMIs, probably more than most people will ever need.The TV audio is surprisingly good, especially considering the fact that the sound comes out of two small slits in the front bottom of the cabinet.  TV audio is not a big issue for me, however, because I have a home theater system that I usually use when watching TV.  But I have no hesitation in using the TV speakers on occasion.  The TV sound does not approach home theater quality, but it is perfectly acceptable for watching many programs, especially those that do not involve music or are not broadcast in surround sound.I have a very old outdoor analog rooftop antenna that was connected to my previous TV, a 27\" Sony cathode ray tube set.  The Sony pulled in about six local analog channels through this antenna.  The new Samsung, connected to this old antenna, receives nothing that is watchable.  I have not tried an HDTV antenna with the new Samsung.The DVD video quality, using a standard definition progressive scan DVD player that did not perform upconverting (a JVC XV-N44SL) was only fair to good -- nothing special.  I was disappointed with these results and purchased a new Sony upconverting DVD player (a DVP-NS90V).  The Sony DVD player connected to this TV with an HDMI cable produced a dramatic improvement in video quality.  I have not deducted from my 5 star rating for this product because of the lackluster non-upconverting DVD player video and poor antenna performance.  I did not buy the TV to watch analog over the air TV broadcasts and I assume the antenna performance would improve if I were to use a new antenna designed for HD reception.  Also, the DVD picture quality did improve significantly with an upconverting DVD player.UPDATE 11/13/2007:  I recently purchased an HDTV indoor antenna (a Terk HDTVa.)  With the Terk antenna connected, the TV pulled in 18 local over the air channels and 5 of these were in high defintion.  The high definition reception was crystal clear.  Also, those local HDTV stations broadcast in Dolby 5.1 audio were received in 5.1.  My five star rating for this product remains unchanged.UPDATE 1/26/2008:  As stated above, I usually did not use the TV speakers while watching this TV.  But, about 6 weeks ago while watching two back to back NFL football games on a Sunday afternoon with the TV speakers on, I experienced the \"audio drop off problem\" several times.  (This problem is discussed by some other reviewers and in an Amazon customer discussion thread.)  The audio cut off completely.  I could temporarily cure the problem by turning the TV off and then back on again or by using the remote to scroll through the input sources back to my football game (on an HDMI input) or by turning the cable box off and then on.I called Samsung during that week and the service representative recommended \"resetting\" the TV which consisted unplugging the TV for 30 seconds.  I told him I would do this, but added that I wanted the current firmware version for the TV.  He then sent me an email, which led to a link on Samsung's website and I was able to download the new firmware to a USB flash drive.  The email had complete instructions on how to obtain and install the firmware upgrade.  The flash drive plugged into the left side of the TV and I had no problem installing the upgrade.  After resetting the TV and installing the upgrade, I have had no problem with the TV audio and I have made heavy use of the TV speakers in the last six weeks to make certain the problem is resolved.My TV was manufactured in Mexico in March, 2007 and it was shipped with firmware version 1006 and now has version 1022, with the recent upgrade.  I should note that \"resetting\" the TV caused it to loose all the user adjustments I had made to the default settings, including adjustments to the TV video.  I now write down and keep in a safe place the numerous adjustments I made to the default settings on this TV - if you loose power or unplug the TV, all of these adjustments will be gone.I also note with some concern that a few Amazon reviewers who purchased recently manufactured versions of this TV continue to encounter audio problems.  A TV that can not produce reliable audio is a serious problem.  I, however, am not changing my 5 star rating for this product because I have to judge this TV based on my experience and not that of others - the audio problem I encountered was quickly resolved by \"resetting\" the TV and installing the firmware upgrade.", "Date": "August 13, 2007"}, {"Title": "Know the ins and outs before you buy an HD TV", "Author": "Penfist \"Dulce bellum inexpertis\"", "ReviewID": "RP90BR404PL7A", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "This Samsung TV is an excellent product. We bought it as a bedroom TV to replace a 26 inch conventional model. Understand that this TV is going to have a higher resolution than most of the signals you will send it. We have the system hooked up to DISH HD, a Playstation 2 and a Zenith DVD/VCR combo. The DISH HD output looks pretty good via HDMI. The Playstation 2 output is as good as you can get from a Playstation 2. The Zenith output is often pixelated and grainy. That's what happens when you mix and match old technology with new technology. I can live with it but consumers have a responsibility to understand that this TV will not make your old videotapes look better. In fact, they will look worse. So will DVDs unless you invest in progressive scan.The TV itself is well designed with an excellent picture (depending on source quality). Blacks look pretty black and we have experienced none of the blurring some older LCD TV owners complain about. Only one thing about this unit irritates me - the control on the right side of the TV itself. They are very hard to read.

Irwin", "ReviewID": "RN924OY4819RI", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "For a 32\" LCD HDTV in this price range, i can't justify getting anything else. the TV is an absolute blast to use, the quality is amazing, it seems to be built well, and i'm immensely happy with it so far.SD Quality - like almost every LCD HDTV out there, the SD quality on this unit leaves much to be desired. it may be the poor cabling in my apartment for my cable channels, but they look pretty bad. i'm guessing that if you had a good quality cable line run to the TV, it would look better, because the digital SD channels from my cable box look pretty good. also, it's not the fact that it's SD that is the problem... because SD DVDs and 480i digital over-the-air look great. it's just cable, and presumably analog over-the-air as well. so make sure you have a good quality cable line run to your TV/cable box and maybe even an amplifier.HD Quality - outstanding. 1080i looks indistinguishable from 720p, as this is a 720p TV with a good 1080i deinterlacer. i don't know why someone tagged this as 1080p, since it clearly doesn't support it. but the quality is amazing, especially with the contrast as high as it is. I have not tried anything over HDMI, since i don't have any HDMI devices. but analog component looks great.Contrast - i have found some of the \"Dynamic\" settings can be a bit extreme... i actually had to tone down the contrast a little, and i turned the dynamic contrast to Low. Also, this is a very BRIGHT TV, but luckily you can adjust the backlight. on the backlight adjustment that goes to 10, i have mine set at 7, and it's still very bright.Games - i have a Nintendo Wii hooked up via component and it looks great. it's also nice since it supports 480p and 16:9 mode, so in the games, such as Wii Sports, you can have vertical split screen that is actually useful. There is also a \"game mode\" to enhance how games look on the screen, but i have not yet used this.Over-the-air - This TV does include an OTA tuner for HD and SD digital. I hooked up a cheap little unpowered antenna and i was able to pick up in-town 480i digital stations fine, and they looked AMAZING compared to their cable counterparts. I wasn't able to get any HD channels without a powered antenna, since all the broadcast towers are out of town, but i'd imagine you'd get a much better quality (assuming you can get a good signal) than from digital cable, which suffers from severe compression artifacts in my area.Inputs and Outputs - there are PLENTY to go around, but considering i have 6 component devices, it would be nice to have more component inputs. there are 3 HDMI inputs, one on the side, and two component sets. In addition there are 2 composite inputs for SD, one on the side, and a PC input. DVI is supported in the HDMI port with an adapter.Remote - the remote is easy to use and comfortable. There is a handy P.Size button at the bottom (blue button) that allows you to change between 16:9 stretched, Zoom 1 (cropped), Zoom 2 (i think an even tighter crop), and 4:3 pillarboxed for SD programs, which is very handy. For example, when a widescreen letterboxed program comes on an SD channel, you can go to Zoom 1 with a push of a button and it completely fills the screen, unletterboxed and unstretched. The volume and channel controls are also backlit with the touch of a button.Sound - the sound is a good and bad thing about this TV. it has a cool virtual surround feature that actually sounds pretty neat, especially while watching concerts and programs that make good use of stereo sound, and it has optical output to run to a 5.1 unit for audio from OTA HD or HDMI. The downside is that bass is lacking, but considering how thin the TV is, this is not surprising, and i'd posit that the sound on ths TV is better than other LCD HDTVs i've heard in stores. There is an equalizer as well to fine tune your  sound. Another cool feature is that the speakers are under the TV, so the bezel is significantly smaller than other competing units.Appearance - the unit is a piano black, plastic finish, and there is a glowing blue LED at the bottom. the LED is not distracting at all, and you can program it to be on when the TV is on or off, whichever you prefer. The whole unit is very customizable, you can adjust many tiny details of the image quality, sound quality, channels, and settings for the TV. The controls on the TV itself are touch sensitive and on the side of the unit. The only downside is you can't really see what they are unless you're in a brightly lit room, so i end up relying on the remote more than the controls on the unit. The upside of this is that you wouldn't know they're there upon looking at it, and it makes the bezel very attractive.", "Date": "June 12, 2007"}, {"Title": "Defective and Nonexistent Customer Service", "Author": "Amazon Customer \"Internet Business Lawyer\"", "ReviewID": "R2GYCJBHMIHYPA", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I bought this TV a few months ago.

However, I came to notice a major issue. While displaying video over component or HDMI, most commonly in progressive scan resolutions (480p, 720p), my set has a \"tearing\" issue. This is a small horizontal line that moves up the screen from the bottom. It happens randomly. I did some research and found on the AVS forums that half the posters reported to have this problem with their set. Luckily, it can be fixed. You must call Samsung support, tell them you have the \"tearing\" issue and that you want the newest firmware, which remedies the problem. They will either send you a USB thumb drive in the mail with the firmware or they will provide you with a download link. This problem was quite bad for me when playing Xbox 360 in 720p over component video.So, to get the best performance, be sure to get this updated firmware, version 1020. You can read about this problem by searching \"tearing\" in Samsung's FAQ for the LN-T3253H.***********I've had my Samsung for about 2 weeks now and am throughly satisfied.  I did an enormous amount of research before purchasing this, and consider myself to be very knowledgeable regarding technology.  I was also considering the 32\" Sharp Aquos 1080p model and the Sony Bravia 32\" model.  I ended up choosing the Samsung because the Sharp was significantly more expensive (due to its 1080p capability) and because the Sony didn't look good enough to justify its higher price tag.  I use this set in my dorm room.It's hard to judge any LCD, however, in the store because they generally turn the brightness and contrast to their maximum values to make the TVs stand out.  I learned a very valuable lesson: calibrating your television truly does bring out the best picture.  Even if you don't buy a calibration DVD (like Avia or DVE), look up CNET's picture settings for this model.  While it won't look as \"good\" at first, your eyes adjust to it and notice more detail and a more lifelike picture.After calibration, my Samsung set produces a stunning image.  I have an Xbox 360 (Component), a Playstation 3 (HDMI), broadcast TV, and my Macbook Pro (VGA) all hooked up.  Picture from all sources is amazing.  What really surprised me, though, is how great my Mac looks on this TV.  It acts as a 1333x768 LCD monitor and the image is superb.  I used to have a 42\" DLP with my Mac connected via a DVI -> HDMI cable and the picture was just OK.  Now with the LCD, I plan on browsing the internet from my couch.Both DVDs and Blu-Rays look wonderful.  The speakers are underpowered and inadqueate.  If you're spending this much on a TV, it's only logical to get great sound as well.  Right now, I have audio sent to 2.1 channel Logitech THX speakers which sound leaps and bounds better than the built in ones.  (I'll be upgrading to 5.1 channel surround soon)  The stand is not wobbly like other reviews have said, perhaps they just overlooked something.  There is a ziploc of screws that comes in the box.  Be sure to screw them into the back of the set after you snap the stand on, it makes it much more secure.Bottom line, if you're in the market for a 32\" LCD, you've found it.

I bought an HDMI cable yesterday. It didn't take long for the audio to cut out and start stuttering. I'm not talking about a split second but cutting in and out continuously. I also have digital audio running into my stereo receiver and switched to that and it was fine. So the problem in that case was isolated to the HDMI source.  I had to unplug the TV and let it reset to get the sound back to normal. Then the audio was fine. I must say that kind of thing only happened once so far. Since, there have been very short sound and picture dropouts but they might have just been some kind of digital glitch from the cable company. I called up Samsung and they sent me a firmware update via email link. It turns out its the same as whats already on the TV. They could have saved me the effort by telling me how to check the firmware and confirmed that way it was already up to date. From what I read a new motherboard with its soundboard as part of it should solve the problem so I called Samsung and they setup up an appointment with an independent service center not Samsung to come work on the TV in a few days. The manager at the service center said they will replace the motherboard.  The service manager said he's already changed six boards. For the gentleman with the wobbly stand. Try screwing the stand to the screen and that should solve your wobble. If you just drop it on and don't screw it yes it will wobble and list to the side if its unbalanced.  A great picture, beautiful styling and great features, hopefully the sound problem was not a reoccurring problem and the board change will fix if it is was anyway. Well the service company came and changed the board and I watched the ballgame last night using the straight HDMI input and the sound was cutting out constantly.

Nothing will stop it until I turn it off.  It's definitely the TV and not the cable hook-up because I have unplugged the cable and the TV still makes the noise.  The sound is like like the whistling noise a tea kettle makes when it's boiling--which means it is very loud and very annoying.Right now my brand new $900 Samsung TV is nothing more than a very expensive dust collector until it's fixed--and I am not happy about that one bit! I am so sick of modern technology not working!  My cheap old $100 Walmart tube TV works better than this.When I purchased this Samsung reviews were stellar and I didn't think twice about buying it.  Now I am reading all sorts of similar hissing and buzzing complaints.  Well but for the loud hissing sound, I would have given the TV a 5-star review too based on the picture quality and features.Since this technical issue is not happening on every TV all I can say is if you buy it, cross your fingers and hope you are one of the lucky ones--for two months I thought I was.  I hope Samsung can fix my TV and doesn't make me ultimately regret not purchasing the Panasonic TV I was looking at that also received rave reviews.UPDATE:  Samsung did fix my TV under warranty. I called Samsung.  Samsung put me in touch with a local TV repair shop.  Service shop picked up my TV and kept it for about two weeks to repair.  Returned it with hissing supposedly fixed.  A day later hissing started again.  Called Samsung back to complain.  Samsung sent the TV service shop another work order.  Service tech came by and said he had the parts to fix it right then.  An hour later, TV was fixed.  Haven't had a single problem since (it's now the end of July).The TV tech said Samsung used the wrong part on some models which causes the hissing.  Replace the part (which he did) and hissing should cease immediately (which mine did).Based on my experience, I would buy a Samsung again.

TV was delivered inside the house and unpackaged.  From order to arrival, it was only 3 business days!The TV is well constructed as you would expect from Samsung.  The sound is great, the picture even greater.  Why buy anything else than a Samsung!  I have 2 of them now, the other a DLP.If you're considering a smallish LCD for a bedroom (like me), and thought about going the cheap route with D.R., Vizio, Olevia, etc., don't.  When you compare the features and picture and sound quality of these brands to the Samsung, it's worth the extra $200-$250 to get top quality.Setup was a breeze.  Nice side panel \"touch\" controls and a good remote.  Tons of connections in the back.  Very light weight. The stand is nice looking and functional, if maybe a bit loose, but once screwed in, no issues.Feature-wise it allows you to control about everything to customize the picture to your taste.  For a bedroom, an LCD screen is quite bright, but you're able to dim the backlight and the brightness to dim the image down to a more viewable picture that doesn't light up the whole room...without reducing image quality.  All the HDTV channels look beautiful, especially sports and HDT.  I have it hooked up via Comp Video, since my current cable box doesn't have HDMI.  I can't imagine much improvement through going HDMI, other than less cable clutter.  SDTV channels, while side-barred, are not bad either.  Maybe a bit better than my DLP, but it's close.Overall, if you're considering an LCD TV with 720p/1080i definition (I see no need to go with 1080p on this screen size,  Also-- NO ONE is broadcasting in 1080p and you couldn't tell the difference anyway at this screen size), this is the one to buy.

Otherwise you will wait for few more days for them to call you.I am in NJ area using Cablevision.  For the first two weeks I was without IO and digital box.  So I was connected directly to the cable.  TV had no problem finding all available channels, including digital for ABC, NBC, FOX and few others.  They transmit in 720P and picture is just fantastic.  But you may need to control what mode to use on HD and SAP channels yourself.Running with DVR box:  First of all cablevision S. Atlanta DVR box produces really good quality.  But make sure you configure your box correctly to recognize all modes this TV supports.  Otherwise it does automatic conversion to what it thinks your TV supports.  Converting 720P to 1080i, no matter how good conversion chip is - still will not create original quality picture.  You want to see 720p transmitted channels in 720p and 1080i in 1080i.Connection: USE HDMI cables for DVD and digital cable box.  You can notice the difference in picture quality.  TV has two HDMI inputs in the back and I think one on the side.  There is also optical input, but I did not try it for sound yet.Short story.  Even without any adjustment the picture is stunning - no comparison to older model.  My TV is in the bedroom and surround sound is more than satisfying for the built-in speaker.  The only LCD that I can think of that may produce a bit better picture is Sony XBR2 or 4.

I'm going to cut and paste a comment from the 3253 forum that seems to point to a problem with this generation of Samsung LCD HD units. This comment out of all of them seems to point to THE FIX by the Samsung service techs needing to swap out the main electronics board that includes the sound card...read on: In reply to an earlier post on May 23, 2007 7:26 PM PDTAndrew Chabak says:I had the same problem: as directed by Samsung I replaced the Comcast cable box, and then even replaced the HDMI cable. The problem remained. I contacted Samsung again, and they sent a Samsung repairman. He then replaced the main board which contains the sound card. Now it works correctly...no sound dropout! Also, I was told by the repairman, that this is a newer version of the board, and this problem has been fixed by him in the past. Call Samsung and ask for someone to come by and fix it. They have some bad boards in these. - Further comment by me: I see in the 3253 forum that there is reference made to other firmware or software updates/fixes being developed...yet those customers that have applied them still have the problem but at a lesser level of occurrence. I'll be calling Samsung tomorrow to see if they want my business .... and will judge how serious they are about tackling the issue that exists.

The tv & box arrived damage free.  The trucking company that delivered the TV (EGL Logistics) telephoned to schedule a delivery, delivered the TV within the scheduled time period and opened the box and inspected the TV for damage.  The driver did a great job in showing me where to look on the tv for signs of shipping damge.Setup of the TV was simple - I did not even need to read the manual.  When you first turn the set on, the tv goes through an automatic setup which was very nice.  The remote control works very well and has a nice lighted display.  I initally thought about purchasing a less expensive Olevia model, but after reading owner reviews, it was clear that some TVs have less than desirable remote controls and cumbersome setup,  I wanted a TV where there was a high degree of owner satisfaction.The picture quality is excellent.  I was also pleasantly surprised by the sound that the tv is able to deliver.  I read a previous review where someone said the TV was not loud enough.  My living is 20' x 30' and I have not ever needed to get even close to having the sound turned up to 1/2 of maximum volume.  There is a clear plastic piece at the bottom of the TV that deflects the sound into the room.  I like this model other than less expensive Samsung models of the same size, becuase the speakers are on the bottom of the TV, rather than the sides of the screen which, to me, makes the set look better when hanging on the wall.Before buying, I went to the CNET.com website and they have a short video of their review of this TV.One thing that I wish the TV had is an electronic program guide similar to what can be received by digital cable or satellite.  When viewing over-the-antenna broadcasts, you can view a description of the programs that you are watching, but not find out what will be broadcast on the channel at a later time.  However, it's not really to big of a problem for me, because the TV has 2 coaxial antenna inputs.  I have the antenna connected to one and DISH satellite to the other.  By clicking on the antenna button on the remote, I can view an eletronic program guide and then switch back to antenna.  I do this, becuase I do not subscribe to DISH HD programming and just watch HD over my local channels over the antenna.After purchasing the TV and reading the owners maual, I found that there is a Samsung wall mount option that plugs into the back of the TV and using the TV remote control, you can move the entire tv up, down, left & right.  I'm not sure why you woulf want to do that, but you can with the optional wall mount.I ended up purchasing a Peerless ST640P for my Samsung and am very happy with the mount.  I chose this typ of mount over a mount with a single arm that can be pulled out from the wall and rotated left, right, up and down, becuase I wanted to install the mount to a wall stud, and my wall studs did not line up with the center of where I wanted the TV to be when flat against the wall.  The ST-640P allowed ofr me to place the mount off-center of where I wanted the TV and then I could move the TV on the mount approximately 5\" to the right or left to center the TV in the position I wanted.If I decide to purchase another LCD TV, I would purchase another Samsung of the LNT xx53 line.", "Date": "June 23, 2007"}, {"Title": "TV tuner works poorly", "Author": "Paul M.

So I found a revised circuit board available at [...], part # BN44-00155A. The new board cost was [...].To replace the board I placed the set face down on my living room carpet. I removed the screws holding the back panel to the front. I easily located the PCB...the power cord is connected directly to it via a small cable...and pulled 3 or 4 attached cables. The cables appear to be relatively fragile so be careful with this step. I removed 4 screws that attached the PCB and reversed the process with the new board and back panel.I turned the set on and it has been operating noise free since. Another advantage is that it seems to have improved the picture quality to some extent. At first I thought it was just me but my girlfriend was the first to mention it.

I had been researching an array of TVs and finally decided that LCD panels are the way to go.  At first I thought I'd spend only $400-500 on an Olevia since they tend to have pretty decent quality for a low price event though they are not a big name brand.  THEN... I came across the LN-T3253H at Fry's.  It was $1100 and on sale at $899+Tax = $1000.  I started researching the TV online and compared its features against other big name brands.  No other TV came close to having the same amazing features for the same price.  Others would have only about a 4000:1 contrast ratio and fewer inputs but would still cost about $1000+.  Finally, I found this beautiful TV for $879 at BestBuyPlasma.com.  This came without the addition of tax and with free shipping. BEST PRICE AROUND!After having this beauty for about 4 months now, I have not had a single problem... except when I first configured it with my computer. I looked up the best recommended picture settings and adjusted it accordingly.  It's only a 720p but the picture quality makes up for the lower resolution. The screen produces extremely bright and vivid colors.  I tested this by looking at 5MP pictures that I had taken down in the Caribbean.  I couldn't believe the details and color contrast that can be rendered.  Plenty of settings on this TV make it perfect for anyone.

Then, in the course of one evening, the picture went bad.  Brightly lit scenes were almost impossible to see because the whites overwhelmed them, people's faces looked like they were lit from within, and there were color artifacts and extensive blurring in fast-moving scenes.Samsung has a NO REPLACEMENT policy -- they will only repair the set, even if that means replacing most or all of the electronic parts.  That would have been OK, if I could have gotten the TV fixed easily, but it was not to be.  On the first service visit, the technician replaced the main board and power supply, but that did not fix the problem.  Having already been without my TV for two weeks, I tried to expedite the part (screen and screen driver) needed for the second effort.The technician told me I had to call Samsung.  Samsung told me only the technician could place and expedite the order.  Finally, after asking to speak with a manager, the Samsung customer rep called the technician's company directly, and then assured me (on  Monday) that the part had been ordered and expedited, and that it would arrive with the technician no later than Friday morning.  (She also told me if the second repair did not fix my set, I would get a new one; but I never got as far as testing that.)The following Monday -- the first day I could get on the repair schedule -- I was told that the part not only had not been received, but had not been SHIPPED by Samsung.  When I called Samsung, I was told that my repair ticket had been CLOSED.  The customer rep opened a new one, but then told me that I would need to call back, as the service dept was too busy to talk with me immediately to figure out what had happened to the previous order.  When I asked to talk with a manager, I was told I would have to hold for 10-15 minutes.  When I asked to have a manger call ME, I was told that was just not possible.At this point, I called Amazon, and was told that they would refund my money and would also pay the cost of return shipping.  The most amazing part of the whole experience was that when I called Samsung back and told them I was going to return the TV and would never buy another Samsung product, the customer rep with whom I spoke displayed no apparent concern and made no effort to change my mind.  The same was true of the person who called later that day to ask how my repair went (presumably based on the erroneously closed ticket) and if I was satisfied.

Not an expert, but I made sure to do my homework and ended up with the Samsung 32\" 1080p LCD HDTV.PROS:1. Brand name. Samsung is a recognizable name, a Consumer Reports recommended buy, and not nearly as overpriced as Sony.2. LCD. LCDs have a better picture in brightly lit rooms. Avoid plasma if you have a lot of light.3. Cool case. Samsung has the coolest looking case, hands down. OK, I take that back. Sony XBR2 has the coolest looking case, but Samsung has the coolest looking AFFORDABLE case.4. Size. The 32\" has the best picture quality of all the larger TVs. Any larger on an LCD, and the picture for standard definition TV gets fuzzy. And at 32\", you don't look like you're compensating for anything.5. Lots of holes in back. You can plug everything you own into the back of this thing: DVI, HDMI, PC, and multiple sets of all the usual suspects. There's a set of holes hidden along the side, too, for easy access.CONS:1. Brand name. You pay a little more for Samsung than for a less recognized name that Consumer Reports says will perform just as well.2. LCD. In a darker room, plasma will have better contrast and deeper blacks. Tweak the picture settings on this TV, though, and you can have a satisfactory picture all day (and night) long.3. Cool case. It's shiny. In a well lit room, that means it reflects light. Be mindful of how you position this TV in relation to your windows and lamps. You're best off having windows and lamps behind it or to the side, and not directly across from it. Otherwise, the reflections dancing along the case can be distracting during boring movies.4. Factory settings. Standard definition TV looks awful in the factory settings. You'll have to play with the brightness, contrast, sharpness, etc., to get a decent looking picture. \"Decent looking\" = comparable to ye olde tube TV, which I'm pleased to report LCD technology can now sufficiently mimic.NOTE:- I haven't watched anything in high definition on this TV. (No HD channels and no DVD player yet.) Looked purdy in the store display, though.- 1080p will be appreciated by picture snobs only. If you plan to mainly watch standard definition TV, 720p and 1080p will look exactly the same. You will only notice a difference in HD, and only if you're sensitive to a high definition picture.

For set-up I've just got the cable plugged directly into the TV, so I just get the network HD channels (our cable company's HD line-up isn't worth the extra $ to get it yet).  The non-HD channels are disappointing and I think my old TV set actually had a better picture.  This is my first HDTV, so I can't say if all non-HD channels look as poor via an HDTV or if it's this particular model.  The HD channels though are excellent.  One downside I've noticed though is if a channel is in 1080i the picture will break up a bit with fast moving action - this doesn't happen with the 720p channels.

I'm not as technical as many of the reviewers on here but from a layperson's perspective, here's what I liked:1.  As with all Samsung products, you get a really good quality TV for a really competitive price.  Many of the comparable TV's I looked at were 150-200 more for the same essential features.2.  1080p is really REALLY clear, but you need an upconverting DVD player to really capture the full effect.  You can find them online for under $100, and Amazon is even giving them away (as of today) with purchase.3.  As other reviewers have noted, the picture quality is noticeably lower on non-HD channels, but I don't think it's the TV itself, I think it's just a general HD/non-HD comparison that you normally don't get all within the same set.  My recommendation is to not watch the TV from ~10 feet or less and you won't notice much difference.About 3 weeks after I purchased this TV from Amazon, I noticed a solid (thin) bar which appeared to be dead cells (or whatever they're called).  I called Samsung, they sent out a technician 2 days later and replaced the screen at no charge within a week.  So, for anyone who thinks that they'll be missing service quality should something go wrong, my experience showed me that my concerns were unfounded.", "Date": "March 27, 2008"}, {"Title": "Great TV", "Author": "J.

After being on for an hour or so the units would start to emit a high frequency whine. We tried everything to isolate the problem, all to no avail. The problem was in the TV. Samsung support and warranty was of no help, they had not a clue as to what was causing it, or at least that's what they said. The longer the unit was used the louder the whine would become. Some research on Google turned up references to this problem with several different manufactures,(common components?) not just Samsung. Some tech sites said it had something to do with high voltage transformers inside the TV overheating. Whatever the problem is we ended up sending both units back and moved on to a Sharp.

The point of this review is that I am extremely pleased in my purchase.I was thinking about getting a TV for a long time, but with all things technology, prices and specifications changed nearly daily with no real consistencies. However, Halo 3 was due to release soon and I knew I would buy it, so I had to sit down and plot which TV would be best for Halo 3 and my new Xbox.The first thing I thought about was size. I am in a dorm room so over 40 inches would be a waste of money and would hamper my experience. Originally I had thought about getting a monitor and then hooking up the xbox through VGA but decided against it as I might actually want to watch TV (plus my computer would hardly use the monitor as it's pretty old). Then I looked at 23-26\" TVs. The samsung 23\" looked pretty good but unless it was right in front of me, it might be too small. The 26\" looked like it was having some problems and it wasn't until I saw this 32\" under \"Also purchased\" that I began taking seriously the thought of a larger TV.In many respects this TV had more than I was looking for. I am not a big audio/visual nut so I had no use for HDMI or tons of components but they seemed like a nice thing to have, so it wasn't a disadvantage. I also wondered the size would be too big with too much pixelation of an image. I knew it was 720p but everyone always talks about 1080p and that's the only thing to get. However, it wasn't until I actually purchased it that I realized that most HD TV shows air at 1080i so 1080p would have to stretch that image. I didn't think it would be worth the additional 300 bucks or so for 1080p.I decided on this TV because it had a great style and no problems. Plus the price is coming down. The problem is that this took nearly 2 weeks to get to me which was more than frustrating. I don't think it was Amazon's fault as they sent it out pretty quick but the shipping company itself is probably to blame.The TV is fantastic. There really is no comparison if this is your first HDTV. The slim dimension of the TV made my TV at home look like Michael Moore (eating a burrito). Channel through standard definition channels is quick and responsive but it takes a second or two to switch to higher definition. I never really thought they would look good (thought it would be overrated) but the difference between HD channels and regular is apparent. The nicest part about switching channels is that as you switch to a channel the TV will list what that channel's resolution is. So for NBC HD, it will say the channel name and say 1080i under it. Great to know that you're watching HD, even though you will know immediately.And yes, Halo 3 and all other games look amazing on it. The sound isn't bad at all either.The problem I have is this tearing issue. Don't read ahead if you're like me and once sometimes tells you something is wrong, you find it. I first saw this when you go into the xbox 360 dashboard and shut it off. I think the image comes up so quick that you can see it tear across the screen. It's like a part of the screen is being blurred. I thought this was the Tearing issue that there is a firmware update for so called Samsung to get the update. MAJOR problems with that. First they tell me they send me the update in email but I never get it. I call them back and they say they're going to send it again. I call back after that and they tell me that my version number is wrong. Huh? They then send me a tech (who doesn't show up the first day). He shows up a day later and tells me my firmware is already up to date. He was a nice guy thought so I can't descredit him.So it turns out that this issue can't be fixed. I can now see this whenever something fast is happening on screen. You can't really see it if you are playing a game, but you can see it in videos sometimes. Maybe I am just looking for problems and am making too big a deal out of it because I want my TV to be perfect? I don't know. It's still a great TV. Now I just need to set up the color and stuff still. I'm so bad at that.Anyways! It's a great TV and if this is your first, you certainly won't regret it.", "Date": "October 4, 2007"}, {"Title": "Samsung LCD 32\"", "Author": "A. H.

It sits on the back edge of my desk and allows me to kick back in my chair and view the screen while operating the mouse on the return part of my desk. I trade stocks for a living and this is the absolute best combination of equipment I've been able to come up with.The LNT3253H and LNT3242H both have picture-in-picture, so I can watch realtime streaming quotes from Scottrade on the lower left part of the screen (max 20 stocks to a board, no limit on boards), realtime chart on the upper part of the screen and also watch and listen to the talking heads on CNBC on the lower right corner of the screen.This has to be the ultimate set-up for stock traders. I paid for the PC and the TV in just a couple of days of trading.I gave the Samsung 4 out of 5 stars because of a slightly annoying glitch in the sound accompanied by a little video squiggly every so often. I've ordered the same HP setup for my wife (also a trader) but we will be using a Sony KDL32M3000 for her monitor, hoping that it will not have the glitch in it. By the way, there is no glitch in the PC portion of the feed, only in the television part of the feed. We have two other TV's hooked up to the same cable line into the house and they don't squiggle, so I'm pretty sure it's the Samsung's fault. I'll report back on the performance of her HP/Sony combination.Well, here is is a few months later and we have the wife's trading room set up with a Sony KDL3200M. It doesn't have the glitch in it that the Samsung has, but it isn't as clear as the Samsung. I've tried every resolution available on the PC and just cannot get picture quality like the Samsung has.

It replaced a 10 year old 27\" Sony Trinitron TV in our master bedroom.  We've run it at least an hour and a half per day and have not had a single problem with the unit.  Delivery went flawlessly.  Two polite gentlemen carried the unit up to the master bedroom, unpacked it, powered it up, and walked me through the startup menu to demonstrate that the unit was not DOA.The best thing about this HDTV is the PQ.  It is excellent from all input sources, even SD satellite signals via the RF connection.  The PQ on this set from all sources puts to shame the PQ on our 4-1/2 year old Samsung DLP HDTV.  It brought the WOW factor back to HDTV for me.  It is obvious why the Samsung LCDs in general and the XX53s in particular scored so well in CR's evaluations.  Also, viewing angle with this set is as good as any LCD HDTV I've seen.  Finally, don't be worried that this unit is 720p resolution and not 1080p.  You don't need 1080p on HDTVs 40\" and smaller, as you wouldn't see any difference in PQ with 1080p compared to this HDTV's excellent 720p PQ on only a 32\" screen.Since this is a bedroom TV, we are relying on the on-board sound system.  We have not been disappointed.  It is excellent considering that it is a TV sound system.The unit gets high marks for overall styling, but the remote is only average.
