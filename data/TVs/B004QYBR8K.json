I got this about 3 months ago when I saw that it was only 270 and had 1080p and 120hz.I am using this as a PC monitor, Television and for gaming (PC, PS3). It is quite good for those purposes and it even looks good with bluray movies. This is a GREAT value and a really good TV in general. Do yourself a favor and buy this if require a good TV at a great price!I have  not been disappointed, however, it is not perfect.Pros:- VALUE- Brightness- Inputs (3 hdmi + others)- No dead pixelsCons:- Fuzzy text with PC (not bad, just not crispno matter how many settings I try)- Sound isn't great, but didn't expect it to be.", "Date": "September 27, 2011"}, {"Title": "Very poor", "Author": "George_T \"George_T\"", "ReviewID": "R2JQN1KYHKS0FT", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "Bought one at my local Frys (for about $40 more than on amazon unfortunately). Hooked it up and there were funky line patterns all over the screen and you could barely see the blue of no signal behind it all. Took it back to store for another and there were no problems on initial start-up.Here's the bad news. My Onkyo blu-ray player when connected to this tv will have HDMI problems. What happens is intermittently every 2-8 minutes when playing the blu-ray in 1080p via HDMI, the picture will go blank but still have sound. I have the same exact problem when playing games on the xbox360 when connected to this tv, but even worse the xbox will do it in 1080i also, and so often in 720p mode.Just for some background, this TV replaced a 3yr old Olevia 1080i 27\" 2nd gen refurbished LCD than NEVER had any issues in any playback modes.I solved the problem with the blu-ray playback by setting the output on the blu-ray player to 1080p24 instead of 1080p.However, I have to keep the xbox360 at 720p to minimalize the picture going blank via hdmi connection.Another issue is a few times the TV picture has gone into a power save type of mode, but sound still playing and it takes a power off/on to resolve it.Also, the remote is a total POS. Occasionally you go to turn up the volume and the tv powers off, or the channel will change.Still waiting on an email response from Sigmac support.When I registered the TV on their site, I had a personalized email response in a few days confirming registration and warranty. I also emailed their support immediately after I registered and I still haven't heard from them a week later, so obviously their support is very poor also. I guess it will go back to the store before the 30 days are up if I don't hear from them shortly.I also notice it will look really, really smooth on playback with blu-ray in 1080p and 1080p24, standard dvd's upscaled to 1080i on a seperate sony dvd player, and also cable HD channels for about 5-20 seconds, then it lags and stutters a bit, then clean and fast, then lag and stutter. Enough to really make it worthless in my opinion with all the intermittent HDMI problems on top of that.If you need a 32\" LCD monitor for a computer to do office stuff, browse and email it would probably be a good deal. For dvd/blu-ray/HD playback it fails utterly.This is the 2nd defective one in a row. Quality control seems very poor. The processing for HD playback is utterly horrible and faulty. The HDMI intermittent video issue is another killer of anything good about this LCD. What a disappointment this has been for my first experience with this company. I should have spent a little more and gone with an LG or Visio. Even my old, screen burned, 2nd gen refurbished Olevia this replaced performed better in 1080i and 720p any day of the week.What a bummer", "Date": "November 25, 2011"}, {"Title": "Good TV for the price", "Author": "tech", "ReviewID": "R2TI9PZRYNZIYE", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "In mid 2011 for a 32\" 120Hz TV/monitor in the $250 range this seems to be as good as it gets!I found this TV #open box# at frys and decided to give it a try.

It's great as a TV for local broadcasts, streaming video from the Roku XDS, and Blu-rays from the Playstation 3.The only technical issue I have is that it will only display clearly from a computer at WSXGA+ resolution #1680x1050#.

The other 5%?  Well occasionally it'll stutter, but only happens for 1-3 seconds when it does.  Rest of the time the 120hz is extremely smooth and clear.  When it works, it's amazing the price i paid for it and i don't really find the occasional stutter to be that bothersome.The audio is ok.  Unless you buy a truly elite tv which costs in the thousands, you're better off adding a separate sound system to complement the tv.btw, i notice stutter with all inputs, not just HDMI which leads me to believe it's a problem with the way the tv displays video.", "Date": "November 9, 2011"}, {"Title": "Best HDTV for under $300", "Author": "Dark Dezzick", "ReviewID": "R3C45Y6VEXSGFL", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "The tv works very well and looks great with my Xbox 360 connected by hdmi. The sound is better than expected, but still not great (that is not however a bad thing for me, as I use my stereo for sound). My only real problem so far was that it wasn't level (about 3 degrees off, noticeable to myself). I did adjust the stand (which seems to actually be bent slightly) to make it within .05 degrees from being level, so I will see if it stays how it is or settles back to it's original state.Sorry for all the parenthesis...", "Date": "October 6, 2011"}, {"Title": "This is a BIG computer monitor", "Author": "Jerry McManus", "ReviewID": "R3F5V3Z5XGTZQZ", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I purchased the Sigmac NE32AB as a computer monitor and I am very pleased with the result.I have an old, dusty Dell computer on my desk with an nVidia GeForce 6600 video card that I purchased several years ago.  No problem at all driving the 1080P (full HD!) Sigmac in 1920 by 1080 resolution at 120 Hz.  The picture is crystal clear at that native resolution and the screen real estate is unbelievable.  I dabble in computer graphics and it is a joy to use the complex and often cluttered software on an HD monitor that's almost bigger than my desk.I should note that I also needed to purchase a DVI to HDMI adapter (in my case single link DVI-D), but those are inexpensive ($10 - $15 range) and well worth it.Features I like:- Sleep mode.  The Sigmac is smart enough to turn itself off after losing signal from the computer when it goes to sleep.- Swivel base.  No tilt on the base, so you will probably need to elevate the Sigmac a bit, but the base does swivel which is a nice feature.One small downside:- Offset picture.  The picture from the computer is not centered on the Sigmac, it is offset to the left by about half an inch.  No idea why, but it's probably just a quirk of my old hardware.  The setup features on the Sigmac allowed me to move the picture horizontally, but only by about a quarter inch.  Unfortunately I could not find a way to move the picture on my nVidia card, so the computer picture is cut off a bit on the left.  This does not prevent me from using any software, just a bit annoying.  That is the only reason I did not give this five stars.Update:It occurred to me that I should make it clear to folks that although the Sigmac LCD TV makes a fine 32-inch full HD computer monitor, you will NOT get advanced (and expensive) video timing features for the $300 price tag.Case in point, while fiddling with \"overscan\" settings on my nVidia card I accidentally put the video timing in a state the Sigmac didn't like.  This resulted in a blue screen with a little box floating around that simply said \"Un-Support\".  Not fatal, I was able to fully recover by plugging in my old monitor and re-installing the video drivers, but not a pleasant way to spend a Sunday afternoon either.More things I like:- The Sigmac has no problem switching between standard resolutions, but the content may be centered on the screen and not scaled.  By setting the flat panel option on my nVida card to \"adapter scaling\" from the defaults of \"monitor scaling\" or \"centered\" I was able to play an old 640 by 480 game that was nicely stretched to fill the whole screen.- The 15 pin VGA PC input on the Sigmac also works well at the standard resolutions, especially the native 1920 by 1080 resolution.", "Date": "October 21, 2011"}, {"Title": "Great item, but where is the headphone jack?", "Author": "Reggie S. Jose", "ReviewID": "R3GX804LVDVR4V", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "This is a wonderful little set, providing a medium sized screen with 120hz and the best resolution currently possible (1080p). Plenty of inputs, pc compatible, and sleek. Great little set, great price.The problem is -and perhaps I am simply overlooking the jack- a lack of a headphone jack. There is a pc in audio jack, but that does not run the signal out of the tv set into external speakers. The tinny speakers are fine at moderate volumes, but when a tv like this is surrounded by a simple but nice system and can't utilize it, that is a wasted opportunity. There is a coaxial jack for audio, but unfortunately not all speaker sets support this. (Every page that sells this unit states that there IS a headphone jack, amazon included. But even the paperwork included fails to mention a headphone jack.) Again, I hope I am missing this essential input and someone can tell me where it lies hidden.", "Date": "October 20, 2011"}, {"Title": "sigmac 32 inch Hd Tv", "Author": "1969mustang", "ReviewID": "RLR9AWW0KKZXG", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "The tv has a bad humming in the volume  and I sent it back and they said that was normal.

I just got cable in my room and I needed to replace my PC LCD with one that would also make a decent TV. I didn't need a TV with a bunch of bells and whistles cause I don't watch TV much but I needed one that I would not go blind sitting just a few inches from on the computer. This is exactly it. It took me awhile to figure out that if you don't have a VGA capable video card like me, using the HDMI port will only get 1680x1050p unless you use an HDMI to DVI cable which will make the TV show 1920x1080p properly on the PC using the HDMI port but without a VGA cable. My pc experience exploded when I saw my games and youtube on this huge 32in panel. It didn't cost me much (like $300 including tax) and the 120Hz is great for my Blu-Rays and shows.
