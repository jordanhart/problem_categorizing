{"Reviews": [{"Title": "A Decent Low-End Flat Panel Display", "Author": "D. Nielson", "ReviewID": "R1V1OS7X8CTC87", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "FYI: I purchased this set from a local retailer as the price was cheaper and I could get it 'NOW' instead of 2-3 days later.I wanted to post a review as the prior 3 star review was not quite objectionable to the actual picture quality and ease of use of the display but rather a review of something more nitch. Hopefully my experience will give you a better insight on the TV.I am going to stress one thing first about this display... It's basic, very basic... You're getting one premium and that's the smart features, however that requires either a ethernet cable ran to a router/modem or dongle which is additional cost.  This is a 1080p 120hz non 3D set that delivers in a lot of areas.  Don't be swayed from this purchase because it doesn't have the luxury hot-rod features like some of the other sets have.The first thing I will say is how clean and slick the display looks. It's a nice compliment to a living room without looking too shiny with unwanted silver/white accents.  Secondly, the set finish over the display panel is a semi gloss that doesn't reflect that badly.  This is comparing say a vizio's ultra glossy finish to this set...  Lastly, this set probably weights 40lbs and is easy to move around.  I live in a second story flat and didn't like the idea of having to move something 120lbs up the very narrow stairway.The setup of the actually display (out of box) was painless.  The manufacture did a great job of packaging the set and made it easy for the user to be up and going in no time at all.  My last Samsung set took more time that I would think necessary to unpack, assemble stand and mount to stand.  I will say though that overall I would consider this TV to be fairly standard in ease of setup.  I have purchased 3 other sets this year and all of them were easy to assemble (out of box) to either stand/wall units.The prior viewer mentioned that the setup was confusing/clunky and I have to disagree there... The internal setup for wifi and getting the television ready for viewing was not confusing at all.  It's very simple and walks you through everything you need to do.  You're not wondering what to do after you're done with the steps provided.  For most people you're going to take the set plug it in, set it up and then never mess with anything else other thank backlight/brightness for others the menus and adjustments for settings is there. There are some sets with more extensive functions to this one but overall it'll accomplish what you're trying to do.  There is tinkering there so if you like to muck with settings you'll have the option to do so.  This TV could not be easier to use.. Big menus/font and clear concise directions. Easy and painless...Now on to the picture quality... I have to say I am rather impressed considering this set it is under one grand.  It's not the brightest set and it's not going to have the best color out there either. I am not going to review indepth on those issues.  I am going to say though, this set delivers with a good picture that most are going to notice if you're upgrading for an LCD or Rear Projectioon LCD television.  The first movie I watched was Avatar and Life of Pi as a demo to the brilliance of this set and I would pleasantly surprised at how it delivered.  No, it's not the best out there but it's very good for the price you're going to pay.  Also the true-motion or as some will call it, the Soap Opera Effect (SOE) does a good job with this TV (if you like this feature). Personally I keep it turned off unless I am watching sports...Sound from the TV? Ugh... I can't 'do' internal speakers from any TV - you might like the sound but I never have from any TV I have owned. I will say I give the sound of a TV NO weight in my final conclusion of it being good/bad.The remote control - this is why I give it 4 starts. The remote was doing very well on the upper half but then the directional pad and surrounding buttons are just too close together.  If you have thinner hands you'll be okay but if you have bigger hands you might fat-finger another button and that could be annoying as it was for me..Premium features/Smart TV function - This is the only modern premium feature that is offered on this set.  I personally use a MICCA device and ROKU for this media use.  However if you can consolidate thoses devices on this set but it'll be at a cost... the set does not include a wi-fi reciever built in. I can't understand companies would still do this but some sets are still this way.  The TV requires a wifi dongle that'll allow you to gain connectivity to those smart functions and amps but the cost is going to range between 25-45.00 depending where you buy.  Sure, $25.00 is not a lot of money but it's still an annoyance if you have to buy something additional to make a function work on theTV.  THis is not really a huge deal breaker for me anyway so I don't give it weight in my decision, but wanted to make everyone aware...My final opinion is this set is a nice bang for the buck! It's a 2013 model backlit LED that sells between 700 and 900.00.  Most retails will have this set priced in the $800 range and at that price point it's worth it.Good luck on your decision.", "Date": "July 28, 2013"}, {"Title": "You can't find better for the money", "Author": "DSA", "ReviewID": "RXCK93MV00QSP", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "After spending a few weeks scouring over TV reviews and going to various retail stores to check out sets I thought I had narrowed down my search to either an LG 55LN5700 OR a Samsung UN55F6300. I knew I wanted at least 55 inches, and I wanted 1080p and 120Hz. I honestly didn't care whether the set was a \"Smart TV\" or not because I have devices that have apps installed already (Xbox 360/roku). That was until I stumbled on this set at Sears. I paid $742 for this set including sales tax. It was listing on amazon for $849. But that's not the only reason I went with this set over the others.Firstly, this set is EXACTLY like the 55LN5700 but instead of having built-in WIFI, it requires either a hardline ethernet connection in the back of the TV or a wireless USB dongle that you can pick up for around $30 (you don't have to use LG's dongle specifically. Netgear and Linksys also make one you can pick up at Wal-Mart). If you have all of your stuff in one place like I do, then this is no biggie. Just run an ethernet cable to the back of the TV from the router and you're good. The only time this might be a problem is if you have the TV far from a router, which in this case you splurge on the adapter. As far as wires and wall mounting go, you're likely to have to run SOME wires, just grab some wire ties and run it with the power cord. The TV is a Smart TV, it's 1080p, 120Hz, has \"TruMotion\" technology, Easy Share, is Magic Remote compatible, Miracast capable, MHL capable, basically identical to the same class LG smart TV's but missing the built-in WIFI.Here's a quick price breakdown on Amazon as they stand today 9/15/2013. This was worth mentioning.LG 55LN5700 (WIFI) $1,099.00LG 55LN5710 (Same as other but no WIFI) $849.00WHAT I PAID AT SEARS: $742 out the door including sales tax.So if having built-in WIFI is really that important to you, you can spend the additional $250 to get the TV that has it OR you can get the 55LN5710 and buy the USB dongle on amazon and only spend $875.49.  In fact I think Amazon has a deal going now where you can get the TV with the adapter together for $849. I'm not a mathematician, but I'll go with Saving Money for $250, Alex. And that's just on Amazon. You can get the TV for less like me by shopping around locally IN SOME CASES.Now, let's talk about the picture. Because what's more useless than having awesome features when they're paired with a terrible picture? This screen BLEW ME AWAY. The colors are bright and vibrant; the clarity is crisp and clean. The 1080p really shines through when you are watching HDTV or Blu-Ray. Yeah, there are some folks out there who'll say you have to spend upwards of $1500 for a quality picture on a TV this size but let's face it....this is the real world and times are rough. You want to get the most for your money and I do too. I'm not into spending more than I have to for something equally as good if not better. I compared this screen to Samsung's and other LG's that were higher in price as, well as other manufacturers both higher and lower priced and for the money this is the TV you want. In fact, when i compared it to the same caliber Samsung, this LG had it beat in picture. The two were nearly the same, but the LG looked sharper, and words were clearer on the screen. Just so you know, that same Samsung is now listing on Amazon for $1,197.99. Also as a side note, While LG and Samsung aren't the same company they're very close to being so. They use the same assembly company in Korea and the parts that are installed in both machines have very similar OEM numbers. They also use the same warranty service companies to service their machines. They are both Korean built machines and are nearly identical in every aspect minus the software and PRICE. Think about that before you dish out the extra $250+ on a Samsung because a salesman at Best Buy tells you they're better. Besides, LG is a name brand just as much as Samsung. I've also been gaming on this TV from my Xbox 360 and I haven't had any issues. GTA IV, Farcry 3, Call of Duty for example all look and play great with no motion blur AT ALL which is important for us gamers. I'm looking forward to hooking up the next gen consoles to this TV because I know the graphics will look amazing.Now let's talk about sound. I was rather impressed with the stock sound on this set. With TV's being so thin these days you almost expect horrible sound quality. The quality of the sound on this set is certainly something I could live with if I had to or wanted to. The trebles and mids are crisp and clear with no distortion whatsoever at any volume, but it is lacking in bass because of the tiny speakers. Like I said, it's livable, but if you want true deep sound, you'll need to look at getting surround sound or a sound bar with a wireless Subwoofer. I'm not going to dive deep into the options of sound extensions, but this TV does have ARC (audio return channel). This is something you definitely want in a TV these days. ARC allows you to connect a device (such as a sound bar) directly to the TV with an HDMI cable so you can control the sound and function of the device/soundbar with the TV remote. Also, no more turning on the TV with one remote and the sound source with another. When you turn on/off the TV your soundbar/device will do the same.  This function is cool for folks who hate having 3 remotes lying around (like me). You just need to make certain the device that you're connecting to the TV is HDMI compatible and you're set. The TV acts like a switch and all the sound for each device connected to the TV will get sent to the soundbar automatically. Oh and before I forget to mention it, this TV has 3 HDMI ports, 3 USB ports, 1 set of RCA component hookups, and 1 optical audio out port on the back of the set. It also has a Dual Core processor.Smart TV on this set is awesome. The layout is super easy to figure out and not hard to utilize at all. The remote is very basic but lets you control everything with ease with the exception on the web browser. For that, you'll want to have the Magic remote. It's just too hard to browse the web with the standard remote. But then again, who really does this on a TV? The TV has apps that you can install and all of the basic streaming apps such as Netflix, YouTube, and  Hulu Plus are present.  The only app it was missing was the Amazon Instant Video application which became available immediately following the TV's first update to software version 4.00.20. This may or may not be a bonus for you if you already have devices that support these apps like an Xbox 360 or a Roku, but if not it's definitely nifty to have. Even with those devices I find myself just using them on the TV instead, just so I don't have to pick up my Xbox controller (there goes my controller/remote OCD again). Also, the apps are very responsive. On some of the older Smart TV's there were issues with the apps taking forever to load. I haven't had this issue at all on the 55LN5710. It actually seems like it's faster accessing Netflix on the TV than when I use my Xbox/Roku to access it.The build quality of this TV is impeccable. It's super sturdy and very sleek. The only thing I hate is the stand, which feels cheap for such a large TV. This may not affect you if you plan on hanging it on a wall however.The TV is easy to set up. From the time I unboxed it, to having it playing a Blu Ray was about an hour. You open the box, install the stand, hook it all up and turn it on. It guides you through the setup which includes setting the date, time, general location (for programming purposes), and updating the software. It was painless. No issues at all, even with using an Ethernet cable instead of the WiFi dongle. Some folks have said you can't use this TV without the dongle and they are wrong.That concludes my review. If you have anything specific you'd like to ask, then by all means ask. Sure, you can go out and spend $1,200 + on a TV with the same features and specs, but why would you? This TV will astonish you for its relatively small price tag.

Lots of apps. Overall, Im satified with this Smart TV. Glad I bought it when I did at $699... I see it's at $849 today but Im sure it will drop again.

Amazon is selling this for the same price as the one without the wifi dongle and its ready to go right out of the box. The LG 55LN5710 is basically the LN5700 without built in wifi so that eliminates that decision since this one is a few hundred dollars cheaper. SMART TV is user friendly and very nice to have built in netflix, apps, etc.I previously had a 42\" LG tv and the remote hasn't changed much but the features and presentation are much nicer. Some people have complained about the remote but I find it easy to use and just the right size and I have normal to large hands. Upon turning on the TV it walks you through a quick set up which is nice and gets you connected to wifi within in minutes (assuming you know your router's password). Slim bezel is a nice touch providing a sleek look. The picture quality is fantastic as you would expect from an LG. Audio is decent for a TV with the option to distinguish between wall mount and stand configurations. When I changed it to wall mount I could notice an immediate difference so it must be taking advantage of the wall reflection.The main selling point on this TV is obviously the price point. For $699 you just cant beat it. You get a high end picture with some bells and whistles for nearly half the price. With 3D TV basically dead at this point there is no reason to be on the cutting edge. Get this TV and you won't be let down. As other users have pointed out, wireless dongle ships separately via prime so it'll beat the TV to your house. Delivery company will open TV if you'd like to verify it works correclty. Another nice feature is that it is ready to wall mount right out of the box. Maybe that is a new LG packaging feature but the stand etc is detached in separate packaging so that saves the hassle of having to remove it (or adds the hassle of having to install it if you plan on using it).", "Date": "August 27, 2013"}, {"Title": "Beware of the \"Smart TV\" - DHS security update", "Author": "JMB", "ReviewID": "R1BBEDYZICTST0", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "Beware of the \"Smart TV\"Today's  DHS daily email referred me to this article which states that LG Smart TV's are collecting personal info and sending it back to LG servers\u2026 From the article: \"However, even if the feature is disabled, information from the LG Smart TV is still sent back to\u00a0LG's servers.\"LG's response: \" the retailer who sold the TV should have made customers aware of the Terms and Conditions associated with the use of the device.\"Here is the article: http://news.softpedia.com/news/Your-LG-Smart-TV-Is-Spying-on-You-Even-If-You-Tell-It-to-Stop-401874.shtml", "Date": "November 21, 2013"}, {"Title": "Very happy", "Author": "JoggerMan", "ReviewID": "R18JZ1BPGESO6D", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Replaced my 40\" 60Hz tv with this one.

First off, i liked the idea of their Enchanced Delivery, even though i was skeptical, just thought they would just drop the tv off and leave, but nope, it wasnt that way at all.  I was actually running late and the delivery guy waited for me to get home, and then he did bring the tv to my upstairs apartment and unboxed it and set it up and did not leave until he knew that it was working properly.I was very impressed, the tv was bigger than what i expected to see and i thought the picture was great on hd movies, however will probably purchase a dvd upconversion for my other dvds to help them be more hd format.  I know some people have said some bad things about this tru motion feature, and i will admit i thought it looked different at first, but i think it gives it a more realistic look when watching a movie, but then thats just me.  I also purchased this wifi dongle to get my internet, and no problem at all hooking into my internet wifi, very easy, no issues yet.  Which i also purchased this wifi dongle from amazon too, alot cheaper that way.Overall i am very pleased with this purchase and got it at a great price that cant be beat, i only have one negative thing to say about this tv, and it isnt the tv itself, it is the remote control, which i see alot of others on here have also said, but i wish there was a different remote i could get for this model, because the buttons are very close together and when you use the scroll pad below, i tend to push the smart button and go to the settings and internet applications, so i just have to be careful.  I am debating whether or not to get a extended warranty on this product, but i think it would be a good idea just in case something goes wrong, they will come to your home and fix it, or so they say...

Everyone who has come over has been impressed.- Side-angle viewing is no problem, even at extreme angles.- Smart TV functions are easy to use.  Would be better with the Magic remote, and I am a little dissappointed that I would need to spend another $100 to get full utilization of the TV by buying a different remote.- Weight is very low.

Lemieux", "ReviewID": "R2ZD82VJHBO38E", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I purchased this TV from Sears last week.  Now that Amazon collects sales tax here in Massachusetts, the price was about the same either way.  Having bought a TV from Amazon in the past which arrived with a cracked screen, I opted for the local seller.At half the price of my six-year-old 40\" Sony Bravia, with a screen nearly twice its area, I think this TV is an excellent value.  I use it for both TV viewing and as a large-screen computer monitor, and it works fine both ways.  Switching between inputs is a little clumsy, though, with the large menu involved.  A simple on-screen list like my Sony uses would be faster and easier.What I find most annoying is that this TV will only work with proprietary LG components.  It would not recognize any of the three different USB wifi adapters I tried nor my excellent Logitech video camera. All of these devices are recognized by my computers running Linux, which is the basic OS for the television itself.  It would be trivial to include the full suite of drivers that come with standard Linux kernels in the TV's firmware, but LG forces us to buy only its branded devices.  I hate being nickelled-and-dimed to death by these kinds of proprietary limitations, especially when I already have an array of hardware that should work without problems.  Without these restrictions I would have given this television five stars.I avoided the wifi issue by routing a wired network connection through a wifi-connected Linux laptop.  I also attached the camera to the laptop which means I cannot use the TV's built-in Skype application. On the positive side, I do appreciate the ability to watch Instant Video directly rather than having to use the laptop or my PS3.One other issue I'm having is routing audio from the optical port to my now rather ancient receiver.  I've tried both the \"auto\" and \"PCM\" settings, yet neither of them seem to work with my receiver.  My PS/3 works well with the receiver's optical port using its Dolby Digital circuitry, so it has to be a limitation of the TV.  I Googled around to see if there are solutions to this problem, but so far I don't find any.  Sometimes this is a restriction that the manufacturers impose to avoid enabling pass-through of high-definition audio that arrives on an HDMI port.  However I cannot even get the sound from the TV's own tuner to work with my receiver, never mind getting the audio from services like Instant Video or external HDMI sources.Remember to upgrade the firmware; mine came with a 3.x version, while the current release is 4.x.", "Date": "November 13, 2013"}, {"Title": "Shipped on date specified.", "Author": "milo tuma", "ReviewID": "R1KM9DBBCC1YT2", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Very nice picture.

My only other Large-ish TV is a Samsung 40\" purchased ~3 years ago and is still going strong.Pros:Out of the box, setup was a breeze and the picture was decent.  The manual doe not provide much, if any, clues how to dive into the bowels of adjusting the picture but if you spend some time with it (I'm still tinkering with it) there's a lot there to make the picture quite nice.  If anybody out there has this TV and has detailed settings info., I'd love to see what you're using.  I transferred my cable modem/WiFi router from our iMac PC and hard lined into the TV.  This allowed me to not have to buy the WiFi dongle that is required to access the Smart features.  Silly omission by LG not including the dongle.  Like I said, only had it for a few days, but so far it's a keeper.Cons:Minor deduction, but a swivel stand would be nice.As mentioned above, no WiFi dongle.The biggest is the lack of, and the required purchase of, a 2013 Magic remote (except for the higher end models).  And seeing how they are virtually out of stock/back ordered (except for the Korean and European models), anywhere in the US, it can leave you in a bit of an annoying bind trying to navigate the Smart screens. Purchased together the dongle and Magic Remote would be upwards of additional $100.  BUT, alas, I found in some obscure blog info. regarding an LG Remote app.  I have a Iphone 4S, found the free app in the app store, downloaded it and it works great!  My kids and I were really pumped with this discovery.  Not sure if this app is available on other mobile platforms. Anyway, the TV is a good one but LG really dropped the ball in this respect and honestly, I was considering returning the TV based simply on this gripe.  But, all seems to be well so far.  If your in the market for a mid ranged larger sized TV, it's a good choice.  Sure would have liked to found it at $699 like some other reviewers did.  Oh yeah, paired the TV up with the 300w LG sound bar/sub woofer combo and it sounds great.  The TV stock speakers, like most, have A LOT to be desired.

I'm not a TV expert or anything, but I'm very happy with the color/picture/etc.  I got it set up on our wireless internet with no problem.  Then I tried to log into Netflix (I already have an account).  So.....maybe I'm an idiot, but I couldn't figure out how to get a keyboard instead of just numbers (this is where the $80 Magic Remote may have been helpful).  Anyway, I checked the entire user book and nowhere does it say how to get a keyboard.  I also checked exhaustively online, but no success.  So, I called LG's 1-800#, waited about 15 minutes, and finally got someone a half a world away.  And here's the answer: press the OK button.  Seriously, I tried every other button.  It is kind of a pain to navigate this way, but at least you can enter letters once you press OK.  (Again, might've been worth it to buy the Magic Remote.)  The next problem was not being able to find LG SmartWorld (where you buy apps, even free ones like Pandora).  It simply wasn't there.  I logged on to the site from my laptop, set up an account, but when I went back to the TV could only browse the internet through the TV, which is not where you buy apps.  You have to do it through the SmartWorld application on the TV.  I checked the Help instructions on the TV, but still couldn't find it.  I was too lazy to call the call center again, so I just continued to watch Netflix.  When my husband hooked up our Dish Network satellite, then the \"card\" with SmartWorld on it miraculously appeared.  I click it, all relieved that I'm finally going to be able to get some apps, choose the first one I want and......(drumroll).......SERVER ERROR 404.  Ahhhhhh!  From one thread I found online, it may be that my Belkin router isn't compatible with the TV.  I still haven't gotten the motivation to call the 1800# again.  So Netflix and Dish Network it is.
