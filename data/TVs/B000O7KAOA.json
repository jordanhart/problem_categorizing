Anyone who is serious about TV watching should buy decent speakers, one good choice is Onkyo 908 (1,000 watts) for about eight hundred bucks, a cheaper alternative is Logitech 5500's (505 watts of power) for about two hundred fifty.I bought Digital Video Essentials to make sure I have the proper calibration, some values had to be changed a little, some significantly.  Overall result was a darker picture than before, but my amature eyes can't tell if it looks much better or not.  This supposedly how it was \"meant\" to be seen by directors, what would I know?I wall mounted it a couple of days ago.  Here's a tip, DO NOT do it alone.  My hands are still shaking just thinking about it.I bought the mount that handles 36-50\" screens (Peerless ST650P) and it worked great.  Here's a hint:  use the metal spacers unless you want the screws to fall out (manual says you don't need to...but trust me, I mounted the 42\" and 46\" Sharp TVs and the screws would barely hold).Cleaning the screen:  I use Monster ScreenClean.  Yes, it is expensive.  But after you use it, you can't tell that the screen was ever used before.  Perfectly glossy surface with no dust, no streaks...nothing.  I have used it on my laptop, my PC screen and TV, I have seen nothing better.If you have any further questions, you can contact me at tkacle at hotmail dot com.Overall this is an excellent TV and well worth the money.", "Date": "December 9, 2007"}, {"Title": "Great picture, great sound... as long as you don't use \"surround.\"", "Author": "Brian Leone", "ReviewID": "R1YFIJXH1NSLMP", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This tv is hanging on my wall, and it's fantastic for gaming, movies and tv. The OLC feature auto-dims the screen according to ambient lighting, which is very good on the eyes. The blacks are the darkest I've seen on an LCD, and the response is more than fast enough for intense gaming.There are more than enough HDMI and component ports, however it lacks a DVI port. Not an issue in my case, but it may be bad for some. The sound is really good, so long as you don't use the \"surround\" feature, which bumps up the bass farther than the speakers can handle for some reason. I have since set up a receiver and 5.1 surround, so this doesn't really affect me. I recommend doing the same if you're looking at this tv.All in all, great deal for the money.", "Date": "August 13, 2007"}, {"Title": "Fantastic HDTV", "Author": "M.

Stoll \"cindys\"", "ReviewID": "R1X8BUC65133IP", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Sharp Aquos LC46D82U 46\" 1080p LCD HDTVAfter looking at Best Buy, Circuit City and hours and hours of research on the internet, we selected this LCD TV by Sharp.  Best Buy listed this TV on \"clearance\" for $2499.99. It is at the top of the pack for technology vs. value.  We saved $500 on this TV by ordering it with Amazon.  I did some research on a few of the other sellers of this TV on Amazon's site and they did not have a glowing reputation on internet review sites when you ordered directly from them.  These companies faired better on Amazon's site, but we decided we felt better parting with our money directly to Amazon.We purchased this TV well before Christmas expecting delays.  It couldn't have gone smoother.  In 10 days we had our TV and this included the Thanksgiving holiday.  Eagle shipping called us to expect delivery soon and then called again to set up a date to meet at our residence.  I shared the concern of another reviewer that they contract out to private people to deliver the final leg.  He arrived in a dented minivan with no help or dolly.  Fortunately, my teenage son was home.  He gave me a pencil to sign the invoice, but I donated an ink pen to him. He was nice and thanked us for our help with getting the big box into the house. I believe it weighed almost 90 pounds.All in all, we are quite pleased with our experience.  The TV is fantastic and we got a great value. The TV went down slightly in price the following week and Amazon refunded my request with lightening speed on the same day I e-mailed them! Most people are worried, like me, about the experience, not the technology of the TV.  Not to worry--all is well.", "Date": "December 5, 2007"}, {"Title": "Sharp Aquos LC46D82U Is A Winner", "Author": "Scott R. Marshall", "ReviewID": "R1RH2HAJDW863Y", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "We bought this Sharp Aquos HDTV through Amazon in December 2007 and are very pleased with the quality of the set and delivery service.Like you, we had to decide whether to go plasma or LCD and determine the appropriate size for our viewing distance.  We knew we would get a better price online so we went to Best Buy and Circuit City to look at their selections.  We knew we wanted either a 42\" or 46\" for our 8 - 10 foot viewing distance so we watched the quality of the picture on these sets.  Many showed some form of pixelation in fast moving scenes yet this Aquos did not.  Other sets showed the glare of the storeroom lighting because of the glass panel (common on plasma.)  The matte finish panel on this set did not show any glare.  The choice we made was this Sharp Aquos 46\" LCD.We purchased the HDTV through Amazon with free White Glove Delivery and were given a 2 week delivery date.  Eagle Global Logistics were the carriers.  Once I received the confirmation email with tracking number from Amazon, I began watching the progress.  We live in Virginia so I cringed when I saw the initial scan was Reno, Nevada!  Received a call from Eagle 7 days later to schedule delivery... 7 days earlier than promised.  The carriers arrived at our door in the 4 hour time frame given and brought the TV into the house for my inspection.  The box was in surprisingly good condition and the contents looked fresh from the factory floor.  Delivery guys were friendly and polite.We do not use the remote that came with set nor do we use the buttons on top of the set.  Our HD cable service provider's HD service kit came with a universal remote control along with the converter.  We can turn on the TV, DVD, HD box, and stereo all with one click.  The built in speakers do however produce a good sound on their own.  Standard channels look very good on the set, DVDs look great, and HD programming is awesome!So prepare yourself for full HD when buying a new HDTV.  Go 1080p, pseudo 120HZ refresh rate, matte finish LCD panel, and size your TV to the room.  Bigger TVs viewed at a closer distance do show pixelation.", "Date": "January 1, 2008"}, {"Title": "The best purchase I've made in over a year", "Author": "C. Tyson", "ReviewID": "R19F00F6GYDVRT", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I don't know where to start, so I guess I'll go back a couple months. Back in November I had purchased a 1080P 47\" Westinghouse from BestBuy, the TV featured blacks which looked like grays, 30 second warm-up period and finally locked up after less than two weeks. I returned it for a full refund and began researching other brands/models. After all of my research it came down to three choices: Sharp Aquos, Sony Bravia XBR and Samsung. In the end I went with Sharp, the CNET review sold me.So I finally ordered my Sharp Aquos early January, I've never bought from Amazon before and with the exception of my mattress and box spring I've never ordered something this large online before. I have to admit I was somewhat afraid of which could lie in store for me. But all of my worries turned out to be just worries.I received my LCD TV in less than a week of ordering it and fell in love with it. Blacks look like blacks and the contrast level floors me. Mass Effect for xbox360 is absolutely breath taking. For games like Burnout Paradise you actually get drawn into the game because the color is so vivid and the refresh rate appears almost instantaneously. High definition content looks spectacular too, watching Transformers on HDDVD was almost as good as it was on the big screen.The only gripe I have with it is that I think that it uses a 6-bot color profile and not an 8-bit color profile. Maybe I'm being too picky, just about everything I've thrown at it has looked flawless. Overall it's a great LCD TV for anyone looking to upgrade or buy their first LCD panel.Also, I wish all of the LCD TV manufactures would have continued to support the DVI-D interface longer. Most people will just do what I did and use a HDMI-to-DVI-D cable to power my MCE system, but HDMI-DVI cables do not support dual link DVI, so there is less bandwidth in the cable. If companies like Nvidia would release HDMI port equipped cards I wouldn't even mention it, but the only products offering HDMI ports on them are motherboard manufactures using onboard graphics...yuckOne final note, Amazon has made me a firm believer in them after this purchase. With-in 30 days they lowered the price on this TV, so I followed the steps in order to be refunded the price difference. I was on the phone for less than 5 minutes and they green lighted my refund difference. I still can't believe it, it was so simple and hassle free.

The Sharp Aquos has an incredibly beautiful HD picture. (Can't wait for more HD channels.) The non HD programs have a tendency towards the extreme on dark colors and blacks. We understand that this is typical but cannot say for sure if our Sharp is any different than other high quality LCD's. My husbands only problem with this TV it is that the manual controls are on the top and we have it set up in a very tight cabinet, so they are hard to get to. Some day maybe we will mount it on the wall and then we would have absolutely nothing to complain about!!

Egle", "ReviewID": "R3MCARG9VWQ1UE", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I originally owned a 42d62u that developed problems and sharp replaced it with a refurbed 42d64u that came with problems.  They replaced that set with a new 46d82u that i received today.  It is an 803xxxx serial. I could not be happier having owned sharps with problems i was not expecting to be this pleased with the set.  The picture is amazing and looks great with both cable hd and bluray.  Sharp went above and beyond what i would expect a company to do when dealing with a warranty claim.  My 62u was 2 months over the warranty when they agreed to replace it, which is why they sent me a refurbished 64u and not a new one.  When that set had issues they upgraded me to this new 46d82u.  Great set that handles everything i've tested with no motion blur, no banding and an overall amazing picture.  Do not let sharp's lcd issues scare you away from their lcd's.  They have the best customer service i have ever experienced, they stand behind their products, and will make every effort to make the customer satisfied if they have a set with a problem.", "Date": "April 4, 2008"}, {"Title": "Great TV", "Author": "Robert A.

Damaged. The cardboard sleeve had been impacted twice - obvious impacts, as you could see the gaping cardboard flaps for each. The transparent front panel of the TV was badly dented and scratched, so I had to refuse shipment.Despite Amazon's \"white glove\" shipping, someone, somewhere was careless, caused obvious damage to the box and TV, and nobody beyond that stopped it from proceeding to me.I think EGL (Eagle Air Freight) subcontracts out the last step(s) of the shipping to locals. In my case, possibly incompetent locals. They placed the TV down with the damaged side of the box facing away from me, which may or may not have been intentional.I took a pass on a replacement from Amazon. Once was enough - at this juncture, I'd rather spend a few extra hundred dollars and take care of the shipping myself.My negative experience is suredly the minority case, but food for thought.", "Date": "November 28, 2007"}, {"Title": "Sharp has a Winner !", "Author": "B.

The TV is great.  Amazon is a dead end in terms of customer service.I ordered the TV, which was shipped by Eagle freight from Sharp's HQ in NJ.  It arrived, and I made the mistake of picking it up on the weekend from thier SoCal shipping center (so I wouldn't have to take time off waiting for a delivery truck).  Well, I got the TV home, put together and the monitor was damaged in shipping (yes, everyone's fear).I called Amazon and they told me that a new one would be shipped and that I just had to return the old one in its packaging when Eagle delivered the new one.  Eight or nine days later, four hours after the delivery window, it arrived.  Eagle unpacked it, it worked, they took the damaged TV, and they were gone.Then I recieved an email from Amazon stating that if I didn't return the original TV, they were going to charge me.  So I logged on to their site and wrote them an email telling them exactly what happened. I got an email saying that they would look for it and there should not be a problem.  Well, two months later, they have not found it, so they charged my credit card an additional $2100 for a TV that thier delivery people picked up exactly as I was told by Amazon would happen.  Now I have to fight them for the $2100 they billed me.Amazon sends these notices announcing they are charging you $2100, but you cant respond to thier emails.  You have to log on, fill out an email form, put in your order number, and reexplain what happenned.  It feels like you are communicating with a black hole, especially when they do not allow you to respond directly to their emails, but have to start the whole process over anew.  It reminds me of calling a credit card call center where no one really cares or pays attention to what you are saying.My advice: Think Globally, Buy (& return) Locally.", "Date": "December 30, 2007"}, {"Title": "Money!!!", "Author": "Rob Witt", "ReviewID": "R1NEV4WB5MLT5G", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "great picture quality, awsome for gaming, amazing HD quality but the sound tends to switch between mono and stereo during movies and tv shows. a little box shows up in the corner of the screen but not sure if you can turn that option off.", "Date": "October 10, 2007"}, {"Title": "Best In Class", "Author": "R. Garrelts", "ReviewID": "R3NDMOAAVEJX41", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Few possessions inspire as much emotional response as electronics - and specifically the amount televisions do. For that reason I'm a bit hesitant to review the Sharp Aquos LC46D82U. So I will begin by stating clearly that while I believe the 82U - and now the 84U - are the best TV's in the mid-ranged HDTV market, there are better televisions out there - though not at a mid-range price point.Now to the details, I've owned my 82U for a little over one year and in that time I've watched everything from 1080p Blu-Ray movies, standard definition and HD cable, 480p DVDs and upconverted 1080i DVDs. I've also used the set for gaming and have tried everything from Sony's PS2 and PS3 to a Nintendo Wii. The obvious conclusion from viewing all of those different formats is that the better the source  the better your picture will be.High definition sources such as Blu-Ray movies and games all look astounding. As expected standard definition sources look just \"okay\". In my experience using the Aquos (and other 16:9 HDTVs) is that standard definition content is best viewed in letterbox or 4:3. Stretching the picture to fill a 16:9 screen results in less than desirable picture quality. Either way adjusting the picture size is as simple as a button press on the remote. Watch what looks best to you.The LC46D82U offers a fantastic 4 millisecond response time meaning that the motion blur once attributable to LCDs is gone. Content once the bane of LCDs such as games and sports programs are easily handled by the Aquos.The available dynamic backlight offers a continual adjusting light engine that can create rich black levels and vibrant bright colors. Out of the box the Aquos offers several factory presets for lighting and picture control though thankfully each is independently adjustable. My advice is to acquire a configuration disc to properly tune the settings for optimal picture quality. Several stores also offer professional set up services though I think they're generally overpriced.One of my favorite features of the Aquos is the construction of the actual screen. The Aquos offers one of the best screens I've encountered in HDTVs. The material of the screen serves to deaden ambient light while allowing for tremendous picture quality. What it means is that the Aquos can be successfully utilized in even very bright rooms without experiencing a washed out picture.The speakers included with the Aquos are functional and aren't intended to provide a movie theater like experience. The slim profile of the Aquos being the main restriction to the size and output of the speakers. That said I've found no gripe with what's included. The speakers are clear and play sufficiently loud to satisfy those used to television speakers.Before I purchased my Aquos I heavily researched competitors in it's class. What I found was that the Aquos suited by needs and budget best. I would recommend others to do the same. All told I am extremely pleased with the my Aquos and recommend it to anyone looking for a mid-ranged HDTV.", "Date": "November 17, 2008"}, {"Title": "Great product", "Author": "Yuhong Liu", "ReviewID": "R220MK6B1COW0Z", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "First, this LCD TV has gorgeous outlook, which makes luxury feeling.2nd, the glass cover makes it easier to clean.3rd, the most important is its image is sharp and color is amazing.One improvement could be done is to have its stand be flexible for the TV move certain angles (say 15 degree).", "Date": "July 12, 2007"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "Unavailable", "Features": "46\" HDTV LCD-TV with Full HD 1080p Resolution\n120Hz Frame Rate Conversion\nFive 1080p inputs (3 HDMI, 2 Component)\n10,000:1 Dynamic Contrast Ratio\n4ms Response Time", "Name": "Sharp Aquos LC46D82U 46-Inch 1080p LCD HDTV", "ImgURL": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/31k9NIPaz7L._SX300_.jpg", "ProductID": "B000O7KAOA"}}
