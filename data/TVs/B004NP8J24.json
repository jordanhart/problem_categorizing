Bought a Westinghouse 3260 with Costco deal last June and got the Costco 2 year warranty plan so slept well even though brand had limited reviews at the time. It started acting up - jittery screen then black in October. Costco helped me get Westinghouse customer service but got the ship to Texas and pay charges result as other reviews state. After 3 weeks got a replacement that remote would not work on so Westinghouse has sent me a \"comparable\" replacement - model 3237. My math skills tell me it is a lesser TV based on \"lower\" model. Guess they had to replace so many 3260's they ran out.

Costco was very good in handling the complaint, but Westinghouse's service was bad. Westinghouse knew from the numerous previous clients complaints the problems were pretty much the same, they should have just asked to mail the TV back to them for repair, instead they required that I take two pictures of the problem and send it to them for review and I had to follow up with the problem.

The screen crapped out, as many others have said, in the first week.The store (BrandsMart) was no help and just referred me to Westinghouse.Westinghouse refused to service the TV at my house or allow me to take it to a local repair shop. I had to mail the TV back to them AT MY EXPENSE. $70 for nothing. My TV was return a few weeks later with the exact same problem. This time they sent me a shipping label after much complaining. That was months a go and I still have no TV. Customer service keeps saying they will replace it but the TV is on back order. I bought this TV in July and here we are at on January 23rd and still no TV.Finally they are sending me a different model. The agent had no stats on the new TV and there are none posted online. I have no idea if they are actually sending me a similar TV.I will never by another Westinghouse product!!!!!!", "Date": "January 23, 2012"}, {"Title": "Should have read reviews before buying...ours died too.

The trailer had a two year warranty on it, we we thought the TV was covered like all of the other items. Well we found out differently when we took the trailer in for some final warranty work. The dealer was told that the screen on the TV would go on and off. Not a problem until I called 3 weeks later looking for our trailer and found out that they had moved lovations and that the TV only had a 90 day warranty, because it was installed afterwards. We argued with the dealer, but they wouldn't give us any compensation, so we went looking and found the comments for the TV. Horrible TV and Manufacturer support.

I picked it up for $259, which seemed like a really good deal.  My problems with the TV are:1)  Sound:  It's awful...as in the worst sound quality I've ever experienced on a TV.  I'm fairly certain my phone has better speaker quality.  This isn't a deal breaker though, because it's relatively easy to find an external speaker that's affordable to resolve this issue.2)  Picture:  As many other reviewers have noted, I experienced the dreaded horizontal line problem.  The picture flickers, lines appear, and the picture either returns to normal or disappears entirely.Bottom Line:  I returned the television to Best Buy to fix the horizontal line issue.

I've had it for 2 years now and it's worked fine, albeit two small problems:One: The sound quality is poor.  I would watch \"Friends\" on dvd and noticed immediately that some of the voices, mostly of female characters, would create a buzzing in the tv.  Keeping in mind that I haven't watched anything else that old (circa '94) on dvd, I haven't noticed any buzzing like that since then.  With that said, the sound quality, even without the buzzing, is something you're going to want to upgrade with a sound system if you're at ALL a sound buff.  It's 'acceptable' as is, but you won't be ooohing and aaahing over the sound.Two: The link to the HDMI cable is sometimes lost, but very seldom.  This could also be the Xbox 360 I have hooked up to the other end of the HDMI; I never really found out for sure which end of the cable was giving me trouble.  I used multiple HDMI cables, so I know it isn't the cable itself.  What happens?  The picture will go out temporarily, usually restoring itself in just seconds.  The Xbox 360 will say something to the effect of \"HDMI link lost\" and then \"HDMI link found.\"  Unfortunately this will sometimes happen 2 to 4 times during an episode.  Then I fiddle with the cable, unplugging it and replugging it, and the problem seems to go away for 4 more months until the tv is moved or repositioned again.Other than those two minor problems, the picture quality is great for the price I paid and I'm happy with the tv.", "Date": "September 20, 2011"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "$299.72", "Features": "32-inch LED TV features HD 720p resolution,\ndynamic contrast  ratio of 100,000:1.\nConnectivity includes two HDMI inputs,\n1.0\" Edge / 2.3\" maximum thickness\nUses 10% less energy than a 60 watt light bulb", "Name": "Westinghouse 32\" Class Edge-lit LED HDTV", "ImgURL": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/31qrQcQgywL._SY300_.jpg", "ProductID": "B004NP8J24"}}
