A great way to unwind after a busy day ... didn't expect to enjoy watching TV so much outside at night, but it's been a pleasure. The TV looks good, too. Got the silver. Advice: go big. Well worth it.", "Date": "August 16, 2012"}, {"Title": "Novel Concept, just doesn't compare to my Samsung in my living room, office, and bedroom", "Author": "Brian Wright", "ReviewID": "R3S0Y0ESQHLGTA", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "I purchased this TV to have something outside by the hot tub to watch Sports broadcasts on cold nights in the winter relaxing in the hot tub and hot nights in the summer when cooking out. I must say overall I am very disappointed of the general appearance and the picture quality of this TV compared to my Samsung's that I have throughout my house. The overall picture quality is nowhere near what you'd expect when paying $5,000+ for a T.V. however it's nice that it can survive in all the elements so I suppose that is what you're paying for and not the picture quality.", "Date": "February 21, 2013"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "$7,443.77", "Features": "SunBrite 55 Inch Flat Screen Pro Series Outdoor All-Weather TV - SB-5510HD-SL\nAll-weather Aluminum powder coated Silver color enclosure\nBONUS Table Top Stand - BONUS Dust Cover\nHigh-resolution 1920 x 1080 pixel Full HD 1080p\nResidential Warranty Two-year, in-factory, parts and labor - Commercial 1 Year", "Name": "5510HD 55\" 1080p LCD TV - 16:9 - HDTV 1080p - 120 Hz", "ImgURL": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/514WaRdQ7-L._SY300_.jpg", "ProductID": "B003GVT5NI"}}
