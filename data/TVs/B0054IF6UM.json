{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Great TV, sans the speakers..", "Author": "Tobias Milton", "ReviewID": "R8M1WSMW3ISFR", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I had never purchased a Westinghouse-branded item before, so I was skeptical. But at this price point, it was the only option that had all of my requirements: 1080p, 24\". A comparable Samsung is at least 50-100 dollars more.Pros: -The picture is STUNNING. Full 1080p resolution makes Battlefield 3 and Skyrim look fantastic. I use the TV mostly as a monitor.  -The weight is almost nonexistent, and it is thin as a razor, taking up very little space.  -The base is fairly sturdy, with a simple thumb-screw securing it.  -Menus are easy to navigate, and the remote has buttons for all inputs, so switching to HDMI from TV is a breeze.  -The brushed graphite aesthetic is pleasing, and only the base is glossy.Cons: -The SOUND... Is like 1,000 harpies giving birth to Lord Voldemort while he hugs Draco Malfoy. It is detrimental to the auditory canals, and it's uncomfortable for everyone involved. No bass whatsoever.  I had read the reviews warning of this, but I ignored them. They were being generous.  -The buttons on the TV and remote feel kind of cheap, but they are responsive.  -The inputs on the back are kind of oddly placed, especially the coax cable, but it works out well. Having a USB port and 2 HDMI ports more than makes up for it.Overall, it's a great deal, especially if you get it at $200 like I did. It offers a ton of screen real-estate (I upgraded from a 22\"), and plugging in my nice Logitech speakers fixes the sound issue. I would definitely consider buying Westinghouse again.", "Date": "January 3, 2012"}, {"Title": "Good, but with some issues.", "Author": "Shawn", "ReviewID": "R22SFMWJL2SGCX", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I got this TV about a month ago and so far it's pretty good. The price point was right (I paid $170 at Costco) for what I wanted to spend on a 24\" 1080p TV, so I considered it a good deal for me. But, there are some concerns.Overall I really like the TV, especially for the price I paid, but the remote is... not very responsive, or at-least the range/angle of the sensor in the TV or the remote itself is rather limited. More often than not I need to aim the remote DIRECTLY at the sensor and make sure I don't just tap the buttons else it won't register. Not a \"huge\" issue for mer personally, but it's still a concern and an annoyance.One other annoyance is that the coax is situationed in such a spot that it's hard to screw on an antenna (or what have you) since it's facing sideways to the left and is pressed right up against the back of the TV. I was able to connect the antenna, but it was a pain in the butt. I can understand why they did it, but they probably should have created a bit of an indent behind it so the consumer could have an easier time with it.I would recommend the TV to anyone who wants a cheap HDTV but doesn't want to settle for 720p, no TV tuner, or a serious lack of connection ports (such as only 1 HDMI, and no VGA or USB). The visual quality seems very nice to me (of course I'm sure the true high def devotee's will notice a difference), and considering that I'm heavily into gaming on my 360 I can say it's a solid solution for a cheap gaming set.If anyone has any questions about the TV feel free to comment and I'll see if I can answer them.", "Date": "November 25, 2011"}, {"Title": "Westinghouse 24\" LED TV LD-2480", "Author": "L. Vint", "ReviewID": "R12PQR2SUROGPK", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "The first set I bought had to be returned immediately upon opening because the row of jacks on the back of the set were jammed into and behind the outside case, rendering them completely inaccessible.The second set had the jacks in the right place, but their design and layout made using the mislabeled coax jack (antenna connection) extremely difficult.  Note:  A coax cable cannot be attached to the television jack without a 7/16\" open-end wrench or a needle-nose pliers and a lot of patience.Be warned!  The \"instruction\" manual that comes with this TV is the absolute worst I have ever seen for ANY product of any type.  It is written in broken English that makes little or no sense.  There are NO step-by-step set-up instructions; the diagrams are useless; no terms or acronyms are defined anywhere; and there is no trouble-shooting guide.A couple of direct, word-for-word quotes from the manual:-- Important Safety Instructions (page 2)  18.  The use of Television in moderate climate.-- Picture Menu (page 11)  3). Clock:  Fine tune the screen width.-- Audio menu (page 11)  In this menu, you can ajust the sound effect here.Typical of the complete lack of forethought that went into creating the owner's manual, the buttons on the remote diagram are numbered at random, making it very difficult to use.  Going straight down the column, the diagram buttons are numbered 1; 23; 24; 21; 16; 17; 3; 4; 5; 6; 7; 2 on the left side and 9; 27; 25; 26; 19; 20; 15; 18; 8; 11; 12; 13; 14; and 10 on the right side.  It doesn't matter, because the explanations are mainly non-existent or make no sense.  (Example:  27.  COLOR KEYS Reserved Keys.)Summary:POSITIVE POINTS:  Once I figured out how to finally get the set to scan channels, the picture quality was excellent; it's not bad from side angles either.  The textured case has a nicer look than many other TV's of a similar size.  I paid $162.50 at Target, which I thought was pretty reasonable.NEGATIVE POINTS:  The sound is HORRIBLE and the limited number of available audio adjustments do not help.  The instruction manual is a joke.  Unless you have had extensive experience with similar electronics, you will never figure out how to set up this TV for even the most basic operations.", "Date": "July 7, 2012"}, {"Title": "Not terrible, not great", "Author": "L M V", "ReviewID": "R2X8KY7YNSFI13", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I bought this television at Target. The price was great (189.99) considering the size and the fact that it's 1080p.  I couldn't find anything comparable.  The picture looks great. The coaxial cable connection is poorly placed and difficult but not impossible to connect.  I do not have issues with the remote control as others have stated. My only problem is the sound. It's terrible. Very \"tinny\" and sounds muffled. I've tried to adjust the settings but I can't tell the slightest difference.  I am going to try connecting external speakers to improve the sound quality. Overall this television is great for the price, size and picture resolution.  The one major deterrent is sound quality.", "Date": "December 29, 2011"}, {"Title": "5 Stars For Its Price Range", "Author": "wizkid1", "ReviewID": "R8UH2ETSNF9XL", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "On thing most people should do is compare there purchase to a tv in the same price range. not the 200 dollar more Samsung, Phillips, or LG. And i will do that here to give you a better review for what its worth.The picture is Superb. Put up next to TVs like Sanyo and RCA the colors are more vivid its a lot crisper and things looked more realistic on this TV. at the same distance from the other tvs in the lineup you noticed no pix-elation compared to the others. 1080p at 60hz refresh rate it Makes a huge difference on the TV when stacked against a 720p of its same size.The layout of the ports in the rear are easily accessible. Its a plus that it has two HDMI ports when most TVs at this size only have one.The TV has a nice textured look opposed the the cheaper glossy look for the frame of the TV. the remote also is complemented with the same texture. The TV has a classier then normal look with this finish.The menus are very easy to understand and thorough for the TV. allowing you to change all the settings you think you normally would.The TV also can be run in an Eco-mode sacrificing the brightness for power consumption dipping the TV lower then the estimated $6.66 to operate a year according to the energy saver label. Which TVs in the same size category usually take $9 and above to run for a year.The speakers are defiantly lower quality and somewhat tinny but these days most people have some sort of speaker system or surround sound system to compliment the great picture so it shouldn't be a problem. They do fine otherwise watching normal TV after you tweak the sound menu settings.The remote is very button happy, having all the options adorned on it it was a bit hard to navigate at first. after clicking each button to see the function or reading the guide you will be used to it. It does have two nice buttons that adjust the sound setting and video settings to different presets on demand without having to go through the menu.  The menu button isn't clearly labeled on the remote so i found it at first by trial and error. As i stated before the remote has a matching finish and is light and thin and fit s your hand fairly well. It does lack on thing in the array of buttons seeing the TV actually has two HDMI ports, the remote only has one HDMI button that only selects the first HDMI. in order to access the other HDMI you will need to hit the menu.The TV is very thin and fits anywhere. it doesn't create much heat at all and has a very sturdy construction to it. The base could possibly be stronger but that's with any TV these days seeing most of them hope you opt to the wall mounts.For 199.99 At target and 179.99 on target online the TV is priced well under the average for its size seeing most at this price are only 22 inches.I recommend this TV for any on looking to upgrade or ad a TV to the bedroom den or rec room. It would perform anywhere in the house but its size could only accommodate a smaller crowd of people.To sum it up the ld-2480 is a Five star TV for its price. Has what your looking for in a HDTV ( a great picture ) and is a better designed TV then most. So grab one while they're still in style.", "Date": "March 6, 2012"}, {"Title": "Good for price", "Author": "J & M's mom", "ReviewID": "RNLKMP3XAZ3FG", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I to bought this at Costco; for a guest bedroom.  Perfect size, light weight, pretty good picture.  I totally agree with the other reviewer: the cable connection is tough.  I don't have big fingers, but it was difficult to spin the nut given the tight space!  You can do it but it takes some time since you can't spin it easily.  The connection is up high along the side, which is odd and in my case very visible.  Overall though, I don't regret the purchase.", "Date": "December 22, 2011"}, {"Title": "Sound sucks!

We purchased this TV to replace our 19\" TV/VCR combo bedroom TV that we have had for 16 years.  After 2 days with this POS we returned back to the 19\".  Stupid me for not reading the reviews on here or Amazon.  Had I, I wouldn't have purchased this TV.  We ended up doing research and settling on the Samsung 22\" which is MUCH MUCH better.The picture quality is great however the sound quality is unacceptable.

Very good picture.  Low power usage with the LED.BAD: A common complaint with flat screen's; poor sound quality.  The set up is not clear.  If you have Digital channels you must obtain an activation code from the manufacture by telephone or over the internet.  During set up you have 3 choices \"Cable\" - \"Antenna\" - \"QAM\". If you are setting up cable for digital you must select QAM and you must enter an activation code.  If you simply choose \"Cable\" you will not get the digital channels (I only received the analog channels provided by my cable company-Time Warner). This was not clear on screen during set up or in the owners manual.  The poor instructions and need to get an activation code was time consuming and frustrating and resulted in a lower rating of this product.

The picture is great, it's easy to use but the sound is very tinny & hollow.  I did adjust the bass and treble which has helped.  Am pondering returning it for better sound which will mean higher price.  Don't use this room for more than working out so I may just let it go.For the reviewer who said flat screens in general don't have great sound, that is most certainly not true.

Later, it took a crap on me and looking into fixing it, finding out it would cost more than the TV was worth. So I rectified the situation by purchasing another Westinghouse because despite the depressing end of my previous TV, I was impressed with Westinghouse. Going from a 720p/1080i to a 1080p is rather pleasing. The image is sharp and is probably one of the best televisions I ever owned...However...The sound sucks. I couldn't help but agree with another review where they said the sound was \"tinny\". Not to mention, if you end up playing anything with high bass too much, the sound decides to take a pregnant pause, and then resume. It's sorta annoying.So, much like the other chap, I'm going to look into getting some speakers for this guy. Also the coaxial input is awkwardly placed.But I can't complain.

I purchased the 24\" 1080p at Target on Black Friday for just under $150 & it functions great (video) & looks great.Any amplified computer speakers will also work as a solution to the sound problem.The reason I purchased this TV is I thought it could be a backup to my 28\" Hannspree computer monitor, if it ever malfunctions, until I could purchase a new monitor.
