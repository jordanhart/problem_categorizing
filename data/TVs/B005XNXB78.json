The blue power light remains on, and can be turned off and on with remote, but no picture!  The Warranty is a standard 1 year parts/90 days labor, which is normally the real cost of a warranty.  Today, I was quoted $150 and up to fix the unit, which is over 50% of a new one, so it is now JUNK!

It was used very little for about 2 months.  This year it worked fine until yesterday and suddenly stopped working.  I called customer service and because it was over the one year warranty they would not do anything at all!  The customer service agent would not even allow me to speak to a supervisor to explain the circumstances.  I have never owned a Haier tv before and will NEVER buy another.  This is the only review I have ever submitted on any product but felt the need to do so because of the terrible quality.  BUYER BEWARE.

You might be able to get some really good speakers to plug in, but the increase in cost got me to the combined price of paying for another TV with equal picture quality TV AND good sound (and less hassle).

They told me they would come pick up the tv twice and neglected to at all over 5 weeks (We haven't had anyone in that neighbourhood they said...). I had to re-register my repair twice and still no show. So I called Haier again who arranged for a replacement. 3 weeks later I'm told that they are out of that TV and I can wait till they make some new ones or, just get a full refund. I opted for the refund because in the meantime, this TV completely quit working.It is now January 16th and no sign of a cheque. I've been told 3 times that it will be there soon- they only cut checks once / month so it can take up to 35 days to receive it. They have had to re-order the check to be cut twice because of \"oversight\".This product is Garbage and their warranty is useless.It is not worth it to try it out- Google HAIER WARRANTY issues and see that it is their company policy to lie, deceive and attempt to wear down their customers legitimate warranty claims in order to avoid the responsibility (a word which has no equivalent modern chinese translation, apparantly...)", "Date": "January 16, 2013"}, {"Title": "POOR PRODUCT AND WORST CUSTOMER SERVICE", "Author": "TRAVEL LADY", "ReviewID": "R1JFAHCEEPZQDR", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "THIS ITEM ONLY WORKED 3 WEEKS.
