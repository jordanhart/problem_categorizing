I love the high definition picture from my local cable broadcasting; which is free.  This TV has a lot of good features for the price.  Picture quality for high def and regular TV are both excellent. Especially for the high def channels. Sound is good. Nice designed LCD TV package, just looks good in the bedroom.

Lee", "ReviewID": "R1LMCLDZ5L55T1", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "For the price the quality of this little tv is amazing.  I purchased this LCD using a gift certificate my sister gave me.  Honestly, never thought this brand of LCD was any good.  Reading reviews like this one was what finally made me push that buy button.  Last year I purchased a much larger Sony brand LCD that works well and paid over $2000.00 US for it.  The VIZIO has a built in Digital tv converter and picks up digital signals using a standard antenna the expensive sony says it does this but does not and would need a digital converter box!  Finally for around $300.00 the Vizio 720p HDTV is well worth it.", "Date": "November 10, 2008"}, {"Title": "Great TV for a great price", "Author": "Philosopher", "ReviewID": "R2UI3UYZOHDJAD", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "For under $300 I have nothing but good things to say about this TV. It supports all of the video outputs that I have. Both my 360 (component) and PS3 (HDMI) games look great on it, and so does \"I am Legend\" on Blu-ray.

The picture is good and you can't beat the price.  I'd definitely recommend this HDTV.  I had a Magnavox 15 inch HDTV before this TV and HATED IT.
