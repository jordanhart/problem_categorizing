{"Reviews": [{"Title": "My Sharp LC70LE735U Experience", "Author": "tkeeg", "ReviewID": "R2EW9HVH5HUQ5Z", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Hello everyone,My current TV, up until last week, had been the 65\" Mitsubishi High Definition Rear Projection TV, model # WS-65813 Diamond Series. It was Mitsubishi's top of the line TV at the time and arguably one of the best performing HDTV's in 2004, #when I purchased it new#, and it is still working like new today. I'm one of those people who didn't need a new TV, but wanted a new, slim TV so I spent the past few months researching which one to buy. After spending countless hours on forums and reading endless reviews on different models and after viewing many of the contenders in person, I chose the Sharp Aquos LC-70LE735U and am so glad that I did.I ordered the TV and am happy to report that it arrived in perfect condition six days ago without so much as a mark on the box it came in. I don't know if it is because I am getting older or not, but I must say the TV felt heavier than the 99 pounds it is listed at.Anyway, on the same day that I ordered the TV I had measured the height from the floor in my living room to where my face is located while sitting on the couch. I then used that measurement to calculate how high of a stand I would need so that my face would be perfectly centered in the screen of this TV during normal viewing. Based on those measurements I purchased a cabinet that stood exactly 17\" high. When I put the TV on top it, using the stand that came with the TV, it lined up perfectly for my seated viewing position on the couch, with my eyes being dead center to the height of the screen. From the TV screen to my face is 10 feet and for me it seems like a perfect distance for both regular & 3D viewing of a TV of this size.Moving on to the calibration of this new TV. The TV worked great right out of the box, but I know that a properly calibrated TV gives a superior picture. Because of this I researched all of the available calibration DVD's that were available for self calibration of a TV.. I am aware that this is not as good as paying professional to do it, but for my purpose, it will suffice since my viewing preferences may not exactly match that of a hired calibrator. I decided to go with the new Disney WOW Calibration Disc in Blu-Ray. It is in stock & very reasonably priced at several online retailers. Anyway I spent several hours with this disc and am so glad that I bought it. I can't say enough good things about it. It was easy to use and had a lot of powerful tools on it to assist in making your TV the best that it can be when doing the calibration yourself.After I was all finished with the calibration I sat back & viewed the fruits of my labor while watching the \"Experience\" part of the Disney WOW Calibration Disc. For those of you who don't know, the Experience\" part of the disc is a series of clips from different Disney movies that will really show off the picture details & colors of your new set. All I can say of OMG....I couldn't believe how fantastic this TV looked! I am so glad that I bought it over the other TV brands available. I would have liked to have posted some still shots that I took of a few of the clips off the TV, but unfortunately there is no utility on Sharp's website to do that for a review.The next thing I tried out was the 3D capabilities. With a TV of this caliber & price point I would expect to have at least two pairs of 3D glasses included, but sadly, none are so I bought 4 of the Sharp AN-3DG20-B glasses separately. They are lightweight and fit well over my prescription glasses. Since I don't own any 3D movies I used the On Demand feature of my Comcast Service and watched some of their free 3D content. All I can say again is OMG. The 3D is outstanding! I was blown away and so were a few friends who came over to check out the new TV.Is this TV perfect....no. If you look for faults you will eventually find some very minor ones on certain content, but this is true of all TV's. In my humble opinion is about as close to perfect as you can get with today's technology at this price point.Shortly before posting this review, I watched several network shows including Dancing With the Stars & X-Factor on Comcast Cable. I have to say that I was just blown away by the sharpness, color depth, details & black levels displayed by this TV. It was in a word....AWESOME !Maybe I'm just lucky & got an exceptionally good set I don't know, but I am one VERY HAPPY Sharp Aquos LC-70LE735U owner !Regards,Tom from New Jersey", "Date": "November 23, 2011"}, {"Title": "Even Better than Plasmas!", "Author": "Discerning Shopper \"Jeff\"", "ReviewID": "R2HHSCVKVEJP5E", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I purchased a Sharp 70LE734u a few months ago for my bedroom, and have been so impressed by it that I decided to \"upgrade\" my 63\" Samsung Plasma (PN63C8000) to a new Sharp 70LE735u.  I decided to go with the 735u because it offers 3D capability, and I've heard from a few Magnolia salespeople that manufacturers put their best processors into their 3D sets.  The picture is amazing on both of my Sharp 70 incher's, but I think I give a slight edge to the 735u for a picture that \"pops\" right out of the box.What can I say, these sets are enormous, with big bright colorful pictures to match!  I think the \"Quattron\" 4th color (adds yellow to the pixels) really is worth it, I've never seen such bright, vibrant colors.  And according to their Energy Star labels, only cost about $22/year to run.  The only negative thing I can think of to say is that now I find it very difficult to tear myself away from the tv screen.  I doubt I'll go to any concerts or sporting events anytime soon, as watching them on these sets is actually better than being there, in my opinion!  Compared to my Samsung plasma, the Sharp's picture is bigger, brighter, more colorful, and more lifelike to me.  From someone who's owned about 15+ plasmas in his life, my advice is to buy the largest screen that will fit and that you can afford.  For those lucky enough to be able to own one of these Sharp's, enjoy!", "Date": "November 29, 2011"}, {"Title": "Disappointing at First but Great TV After Some Calibration.", "Author": "sarifin", "ReviewID": "RM08741Z0EDTE", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Being a technology professional, My expectation on this television was quite high from the moment I saw it in Best Buy.  I did a good amount of research for about 2 weeks.  Read every reviews about this television in online stores, watched every You Tube Video's about Sharp Products in the same line spoke to sales associates in two major stores.One thing I could not understand why people gave this TV a 5 start rating.  In my opinion in this world of evolving technology there are very few products that deserves a 5 start.  Oh well, after 10 days I can say that this TV deserves a 4+ ratings in my opinion.Watching Blue Ray DVD in Best Buy was quite satisfactory in this TV but my concern was much more about quality of HD channels from my Cable box.Oh well, finally ordered and received this TV about 10 days ago from Amazon.  Saved about $500 as Best Buy would not match Amazon Price.Initial experience of this TV was not as pleasing as I thought would be.  I was almost wanted to call the Amazon vendor and return this TV, but decided to start playing with picture  calibration settings.Took about two days to adjust these settings to close to perfect.Within a day after calibration, I realized why this TV is rated 5 in most reviews.  The pictures are amazing.  HD video from Cable Box looks amazing and Blue Ray DVD's are just flawless.I am giving this TV a 4 Start cause, I did notice few minor issue.  In my honest opinion TV this size and caliber should not have few of these issues.Here the pros and cons of this TV as per my 10days of experience.Pros------- Nice Size, Perfect for a room size of 15-20 foot.- Amazing picture when configured properly.- Lots of Applications including Netflix, Youtube, Pandora, VUDU, Blockbuster, Picasa.- Wireless internet is flawless.- Plays DLNA content very well, no lag at all.- Easy to use Remote.- Good 3D quality (Only Tried 3D demos so far)- 2D to 3D conversation works well.Cons-------- Sound is not as good as it should be for TV this size and caliber.- No 3D glasses, had to buy extra glasses.- Took good amount of time to calibrate, colors, hue, sharpness.- I am not sure if this TV is true 240hz.  Aqua motion seems Sharps own interpretation of 240hz.- Did notice some pixilation in first few days.- Heavy about 100LB.", "Date": "December 31, 2011"}, {"Title": "70\" Sharp 3d good replacement for Mits. 73\"", "Author": "Garry Amann \"archer\"", "ReviewID": "R2F9OG6MXC5FFI", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Sharp 70LE735U is a Great TV!

If you pause a movie they might stay on, they might not, keep them pointed at the screen.  I also on the 70 sony sxrd.  I kepy waiting for sony to make a 70 inch 3d.  I was going to get the 65 inch they were suppose to release.  They kepy putting the release date off.  Started looking at the sharp 70 inch 3d. Never owned a sharp tv.  Since it was 2000.00 dollars cheaper than the yet released 65 inch sony I decide to buy it.  The glass where kind of cheap.  Dont be fooled.  They are kinda of flimsy like kids cheap play glasses.  They are great. They are easy to use, they are rechargeable, you forget you have them on.  My wife even likes them. I just wished they worked on the sony.  Now the big suprise the TV.  I kept thinking this TV is as good as my more expensive Sony.  My wife said it best. \"this TV beats the one in the theator room.  So save some money and get yourself a better 3d experience.

I'm one of those people who didn't need a new TV, but my wife wanted a new, slim TV so after viewing many of the contenders in person at ABT, I chose the Sharp Aquos LC-70LE735U and am so glad that I did.\"This TV has the most amazing color I have ever seen, that extra yellow pixel and 240Hz rate make a HUGE difference. I bought my TV at ABT Electronics and Appliance Store in Glenview, IL. I really should have bought from Amazon because I could have saved $320 in taxes (which I could have used for glasses) but I was impulsive and wanted it NOW.I didn't have a 3D disc but my son had a Ratchet and Clank 3D PS3 game so we loaded the newest firmware on it which supports 3D and WOW WOW WOW. Insane to play this game in 3D. I can't play but my son is an expert (what 14 yr old isn't) and watching him play this game was like watching a movie in 3D. Things were just flying at us and it seemed like we could see behind the people and objects.Can't wait to get Avatar 3D.I ordered 4 Sharp AN3DG20B 3D Glasses from amazon for my Sharp LC70LE735U and LOVE them. Lightweight and comfortable. I don't know what the more expensive ones feel like but these are Excellent. I would say don't waste the extra $75 on them just buy these. Plus if you scratch or break these lenses it's only $75 to replace rather than $150.The only thing I'm bummed about is that the 80\" set didn't come with 3D and 240 Hz Or I would have bought that one instead.I was going back and forth between this TV and a Projector Which would  have given me a 109\" screen but I think I would have missed the true blacks and the vibrant colors so I'm Very Happy with this TV.12/19/2011 Edit  I just got my Avatar 3D from Ebay. A Panasonic 3D TV/BD Player/Glasses kit/ purchase is the only way to get this disc promotional 3D disc right now until the middle of February when the exclusive deal that James Cameron made with Panasonic runs out. I saw this movie in the theaters in 3D and I've got to say that this movie in a way looks better at home than the theater. The Colors and Picture are so amazingly crisp and clear, and if you have a proper surround sound will blow you away. I'm probably going to see it 3-5 times as we show our TV to all of our friends. Just an incredible TV. And today only in the low $3035,99's to purchase from Paul's' TV on Amazon. What a deal for this TV. I just wish the 80\" was 3D.  If you're going to buy the Avatar disc on EBay Make sure you are carefull and see that it is not the rip off bootlegs coming from Hong Kong. And what I always do when things are sketchy is send a question like, \"are you selling such and such on EBay\" because if the persons EBay site has been hijacked only the owner gets the email from you to respond to and not the hijacker and they will confirm whether it is legit or not.

I purchased this tv about 6 weeks ago and I was originally very happy with it. Then after a few days of owning it I started to notice the clouding issues as well as the motion blur and pixellation. I have a large bright spot in the lower right hand corner of the screen which is very annoying. It is only noticable on dark scenes which I guess is a plus. Most of the time I don't notice it. However, whenever I try to watch a movie at night, there is the glaring bright spot again. I thought about sending the tv back but decided against going through the aggravation of repacking everything. Now it's too late and I feel as though I'm stuck with it.The tv does have beautiful color and there are many picture calibration options. The 3D is great. Another downside is that you have to buy the glasses which are about $75-$90 per pair. I was lucky enough to get 2 pairs on an auction site for $95.If you plan on mostly daytime viewing and don't mind the clouding issues and dirty screen effect, this may be a good tv for you.I do suggest going to the store and looking at it before you buy one.Hopefully you will get a better one than I did.Good luck!", "Date": "February 10, 2012"}, {"Title": "Amazing TV!", "Author": "Dodgson, Dodgson, We've Got Dodgson Here!", "ReviewID": "R2UDRTB11W3PMO", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I previously had a 55\" Mitsubishi HD Rear Projection TV (Diamond Series).  It lasted for about 8 years until a few months back when it started having problems and the TV would keep turning off every couple minutes...then finally it would not power on anymore.  Seeing that it was taking up valuable family room space and the picture quality was obsolete, I decided to start shopping around for the best TV.I spent several weeks going back and forth between LCD and Plasma, but in the end, I decided that based on the viewing location (brightly lit room during the day) and paranoia of screen burn-in on plasmas, I decided that LCD was best for me.  After lots of research the 70\" Sharp LC-70LE735U ended up being the winner, giving me excellent picture quality and a giant screen at a non-premium price.I ordered the TV and was surprised when it was estimated for delivery in 1 week courtesy of Pilot.  They called to set up an appointment and I before I knew it they were hauling in the enormous box containing my TV.  I made sure to have them take the TV out of the box to be sure there was no damage during shipment.  Everything was perfect.After hooking up my OPPO BDP-93 Universal Network 3D Blu-ray Disc Player, I started calibrating the TV with the Disney WOW: World of Wonder [Blu-ray].  After spending all night calibrating, I was able to achieve deep blacks, bright whites, and accurate colors.  Naturally I had to test out my work, so I popped in Up (Three-disc Blu-ray / DVD Combo) into my Blu-ray player and the picture quality was stunning.  The clarity and colors were simply amazing.My final step was to test out the 3D capabilities of the TV.  I threw in The Lion King (Four-Disc Diamond Edition Blu-ray 3D / Blu-ray / DVD / Digital Copy) and evaluated the experience.  Using my Universal Infrared Active Shutter 3D Glasses for 3D TVs (Samsung, Sony, LG, Sharp, Toshiba, Philips, Haier) I was blown away by the amount of depth of the 3D Blu-ray.  There was minimal cross-talk(ghosting) and the picture seemed very bright despite being in a bright, sun-filled room.  I'm about to order Imax: Hubble 3D [Blu-ray] so I can really see 3D perfection.Overall, I am so glad I chose the Sharp.  It has truly created the theater-like experience that I have always wanted in my home.

Ironically, for about a year, my wife had been suggesting a flat panel upgrade. Odd...isn't it the husband that usually wants to upgrade electronics? Well, her wish came true when the three color image wouldn't stay converged followed by a complete power supply failure. The hunt for a new TV was on.Our minds were made up before the actual shopping began and we went straight for the Viewmongus 80\" Sharp Aquos.  But once we saw the picture quality, our hearts sank-the image was soft and grainy and color was lacking. It was nothing more than a 70\" with bigger pixels. We looked at both cable TV and Blu-Ray content and the results were the same, the 70\" Aquos with four-color Quattron technology had a sharper image with much better color. What a disappointment. We really wanted VIEWMONGUS!Our next look was at Mitsubishi's 82\" DLP rear-projection. After careful consideration, we decided on something we could hang on a wall. That led us to the Sharp LC-70LE735U. Of all the 70-inchers under $4000, it really did have the best picture.Once we got it home and set up, I found that most of the reviews found here had some thread of accuracy. First, Blu-ray content is spectacular. The colors are incredibly rich and the image is as sharp as any TV out there. Second, it's true that when viewing bright panning images (like ice or sky) that take up a large portion of the screen, the dirty screen effect shows up. In order to see the effect, the image must be bright and the camera needs to be panning. If the image is static, the effect isn't very obvious and when it's dark it's virtually non-existent, though some video feeds can exhibit blocky artifacts when the screen is dark.One thing to remember is that, more than a CRT or DLP TV, these new LED/LCD TVs are very sensitive to quality of the video source. I've found that watching standard-def TV content is much harder on the Sharp vs. my old Mistu rear-projection. Even HD content from my cable provider can look iffy if it's not a clean, true 1080i feed (some channels are worse than others). It's almost like the quality of the panel exaggerates the imperfections of lesser signals. BTW, Blu-ray looks awesome. I'm not a fan of 3D, but How To Train Your Dragon looks great in 3D and strangely, the dirty screen effect is absent in 3D movies.As for calibration, I have two calibration options, Video Essentials in DVD and Disney WOW in Blu-ray. I used both and discovered that my TV, out of the box, wasn't too far off. Skin tones needed the most help, but minor corrections to color and tint corrected this and now the set looks fantastic.I turned off the film effect (completely off) to get rid of the soap opera effect but left AquaMotion240 on. I bought high end HDMI cables even though they are more marketing than necessity and I'm running everything through an Onkyo receiver.This TV isn't perfect but it's big, has the four-color Quattron and it cost me $3000. Like I said, it forces you to make compromising decisions but after several weeks and careful tweaking, if you want a 70\" TV, I feel like it's worth buying.After 13 flawless years, my 65\" Mitsubishi Diamond rear-projection TV died.

First off, once you watch a movie on this TV you will never go back to anything smaller. The size gives you that feeling your in a movie theater. The screen is HUGE!!Out of the box, I turned on the TV and watched some content. At first I thought the colors were amazing, but then noticed that skin tones were off, the brightness was off...and so on. When I mean off...its off. I tried using some of the calibration numbers posted here and in other forums but nothing looked right. I finally bought a calibration disc and a blue filter, then got the TV dialed in. Once the colors and tint were dialed in this TV is amazing! It takes some work though to get it to look right.The 70 inch screen size also really brings out the 3D more then it did on the 55 inch TV. Avatar in 3D made me feel like I was watching it in the theater again. For 3D, this is the way to go because of the size of the screen. I did find that the Toshiba though handled ghosting images a little bit better then the Sharp. The Sharp 3D glasses have some pros and cons to them. They are lighter and feel better to wear because they use rechargeable batteries. The problem with this is, you have to make sure you recharge them. I liked my Toshiba glasses more, the batteries lasted six months before I had to change them. Also, the instructions state you have to plug the Sharp glasses into the TV using a USB cable. You have to turn the TV off, attach the glasses, turn the TV on, charge the glasses, turn the tv off and disconnect the glasses. Sort of a pain if you ask me.Pros: Size of the screen vs. price  3D movies look amazing  On GAME mode there doesn't seem to be any lag when playing the PS3.  Colors are vibrant and incredible contrast  This is a TV for people who love movies!!!Cons: Its NOT a TV for sports fans or if you watch a lot of cable TV. If your cable provider uses a lot of compression so they can give you more channels...it WILL show. Sports will pixalate.  The TV should have a blue filter button on it, so it would be easier to calibrate the TV  The TV allows you to have different settings, it offers Standard, Movie, Game, User..and so on. The problem is that ONLY movie mode will allow you to turn the color gamut from expanded to standard. It is VERY hard to calibrate the TV when the color gamut is on expanded. That is why in almost every forum they calibrate the TV and give calibration settings in movie mode. They should allow you more freedom to turn this off in other modes. For me, when the color gamut is on expanded, anything that has an exact \"yellow\" crossing guard sign color shows up green.For the price this is the BEST TV on the market for the size of the screen.  The TV needs to be calibrated to get the colors, especially facial tone to look right.", "Date": "May 4, 2012"}, {"Title": "LC70LE735 70 1080p 3D LCD TV", "Author": "Patrick Howard", "ReviewID": "R1LZBXTTZBMT7P", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This Sharp LC70LE735 70 1080p 3D LCD TV is great TV, easy to setup and has a brilliant picture.

Besides, I have dealt with Amazon on other purchases and the one time I did have an issue they were on my side supporting me immediately.  Entire transaction from purchase to shipping to delivery went great.  Note that delivery service does not put the stand on and hook up to your home system.  The most they do is to take it out of box and plug it in to verify operation.  The original notification I got from Amazon said \"White Glove Service\" but when I inquired they said that was a mistake and it is just basic service even with Amazon Prime.The TV picture is outstanding.  I did make a few adjustments using the Disney Calibration Disc that several reviewers recommended although out of the box it was not bad at all but the calibration made it more towards my particular taste.  Prefer the movie mode as the auto mode did not see to be as crisp and sharp in my opinion.  Definitely turn off the power saving mode.  Set came with it in off mode and when I enabled it picture did not look so good.  Maybe Sharp has been listening to customers and have set up from factory with customer recommended settings.Great overall experience and product.

Deciding on this particular model came after lots of research and scoping out other TV's instore and online. The room I have this TV in is gigantic and exceptionally bright with a wall of over 25 feet of sliders facing the TV. I do have blinds on the sliders but they aren't true blackouts and do still let quite a bit of light in, also my sectional is over 20 feet away from the wall the TV would be displayed on. I had considered an actual projector but the benefits seemed minimal and for every day use it just wasn't functional to watch the news on every morning. DLP's are old technology and just didn't work in my space and plasma's would have a horrible reflection and be way too dark plus hog energy. Anyways I could not have made a better choice for this space. This TV has lived up to every hope and dream I had plus more on top.The picture is OUTSTANDING! I have friends with Samsung's and also Panasonic 3D Plasma's and they come to MY house to watch TV. This model has a huge advantage of having a full backlit screen instead of just the edgelit of the newer models. In a bright room like mine this made all the difference in the world. The time I bought the TV was just the time the newer models were coming out. Usually you think \"Newer is better\" right? WRONG in this situation. The edgelits can't come anywhere close to the richness in color you get on the TV and actual HD definition. I wouldn't trade this for the newer model at all and only become more in love with my purchase each day.Some highpoints of the TV are as follows.1) Set up was easy and took a matter of moment's.2) This TV is very light weight and actually weighs less than a friend 50 inch Plasma TV.3) The full backlit is spectacular and the richness of color is unsurpassed.4) We haven't noticed any shadowing or errors in motion on the TV at all.5) VUDU and netflix are easy to access and movie download is simple.6) The active 3D quality is really unsurpassed7) Energy usage is great and I actually saw my bill LOWER over my previous older model set up.The only negatives I will say with this TV was mainly related to the delivery and also the web browser not being as well designed and more limited than the Samsung TV's. I have read that the browser is easily hackable to unlock but haven't actually tried it yet. The 3D glasses are relatively inexpensive and I ordered the knockoffs off of Amazon. I felt they should've included 2 pair for the price but that goes back to Sharp.No matter how many times you've checked it out in store when you actually see this TV in your home it's a million times better quality.Just watching the Olympics in 3D made this whole purchase worthwhile. People may say 3D is a fad and you won't use it but honestly I've gotten my use out of it and it was worth every penny.", "Date": "August 5, 2012"}, {"Title": "Dirty Screen Effect (DSE) may be a deal breaker ...", "Author": "\u00e5m\u00e2z\u014fni\u0101n \"Being an Earthling, Livi...", "ReviewID": "R37R5QGTWOKA88", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "If you don't know what DSE is, please stop reading as once you know/see it, you cannot unsee it.

A Sharp technician will come out in 2 days to see what can be done to this.  I REALLY would hate it if they need to exchange this set.  I got it at my local Best Buy but would hate to bother my friend again to lift, unbox, install, etc. all over again especially when quite a few LC70LE735U owners at AVSForum reported the same thing.UPDATE:  I finally watched BD 3D + 2D on my 735, DSE was at a bare minimal at long last.
