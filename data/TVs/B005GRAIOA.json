{"Reviews": [{"Title": "RCA 21.5 LED TV w/DVD purchased thru Amazon.com", "Author": "Angela M. Faria", "ReviewID": "R2RH7UX6C95DK", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I was pleased with the seller's service.  The TV itself has a great picture both on regular stations and HiDef.  My complaint is that the sound is missing a bass component because (to my ears) it is at a high pitch and \"tinny\" - like a speaker from the 1930's era radio.  Because of this, I'm using my \"TV Ears\" in order to have good sound quality.  The DVD component is kind of sluggish in accepting the DVD and at times won't give it back .  I have to press the eject button a few times.  One last item, the electrical cord and cable connections are not straight in the back; you have to go underneath a section of the back in order to connect them.  What a pain!!", "Date": "April 11, 2012"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": null, "Features": null, "Name": null, "ImgURL": null, "ProductID": "B005GRAIOA"}}
