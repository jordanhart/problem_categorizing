The picture quality is among the best I've seen anywhere, in fact, I'd even go so far as saying it is outstanding. I've been shopping around for an LED/LCD TV for some time now, and had my heart set on a Samsung or Lg. Why? Because they're the ones you see advertized everywhere -- they're the big boys of the industry. But a really low sale price on this Toshiba made the 58L7300 an offer to good to refuse, and I'm glad I didn't.For me, the magic number to buying a TV was below $1,000, as long as it had certain must-have features. They include:- at least a 55\" screen- at least 4 HDMI inputs- WifiThe Toshiba not only met all of these requirements, but it threw in a beautiful wireless keyboard, and a web browser as well. And the keyboard also works with my Samsung Galaxy 10.1 tablet, and my laptop. I'm sure I will get a lot of use from it.I gave this TV only four stars because the Internet set-up procedure was a pain, and the apps are kind of sluggish. I'm sure Toshiba is working to correct that situation. But the Internet setup is a one-time thing. The features are only the icing on the cake, and right now are not something I plan to use that often.The most important thing for me about a TV is picture quality, and this TV has gobbs of it. The funny thing is, I almost didn't buy this TV because the store I purchased it at had it right next to a $3,000+ Samsung TV, which they had adjusted to maximum jaw-dropping \"come-buy-me\" effect. It looked like the store personnel had made no effort to adjust the Toshiba's picture at all.To make matters worse, the store did not have any of its TVs hooked up using HDMI cables, so none of the sets was showing a true 1080p picture. But like I said, the sale price of the Toshiba was so incredible, that I had to buy it. I figured, Toshiba is a major TV manufacturer, and the 7300 line of TVs was only introduced a couple of months ago. So it's not like all of those leftover 2011 Samsungs that I was seeing on sale. And when I took delivery of the set, I went into the menu settings and and adjusted the picture settings, and it is now breathtaking.In addition, when connected to my HD satellite via a HDMI cable, the TV's picture looks, to me at least, better than my friend's plasma Lg set.Most people probably don't think of Toshiba when looking to purchase a new TV, but I heard awhile ago that they are the largest maker of laptop computers. Well, their experience with LCD technology sure shows up in their high-end TVs. I am extremely happy with my purchase.--------------------------------------------------Update on 6/26/13:I have owned this TV for two months now, and continue to be amazed by it. The picture is sharp and clear, the colors wonderful and the sound quality is very good.There are a couple of things I want to point out again. When I first received this TV, I was not happy with the picture. So I went into the settings and adjusted the contrast, brightness, sharpness, etc., to make things to my liking. But I know what I'm doing; a novice might have a difficult time with this and would want to consult a professional.I have not had any problems with my HDMI or USB ports at all. I have four different accessories plugged into my HDMI inputs, and they all work flawlessly.Two days I ago I turned on the TV, and a message appeared that a software upgrade was available. I clicked \"OK,\" and it downloaded and installed itself, no muss, no fuss.The TV's Internet experience is not the smoothest, but I have not seen another TV brand that has implemented this feature to be as easy to use as your personal computer. That being said, I don't really care about this because I have both a Roku box and an Apple TV plugged into my Toshiba TV, and they both work very well.As with anything mass produced, there are bound to be some that ship with problems. I guess I'm one of the lucky ones, because my TV is simply awesome.", "Date": "May 7, 2013"}, {"Title": "Good, but some flaws...", "Author": "Bob Continental", "ReviewID": "R28K58PZ8XGPZX", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "This is my second Toshiba television.  I purchased the 58 inch unit, in part, based on the outstanding picture quality of the 40 inch Toshiba I  already owned.  I waited three months after purchase and use of the television before commenting on what I perceive to be the pros and cons of the unit.The pros:First, I use a wireless connection.  I have not had any of the difficulties mentioned in some of the reviews regarding losing the wifi connection, and never have seen the \"blue screen of death.\"  Make sure your router is of sufficient speed to stream video seamlessly.  I use a Belkin N600 dual band router, with one band dedicated to the wifi connection to the tv.  Make sure you \"save\" the wifi connection per the instructions.  This could be the reason for losing the wifi connection.  There are several steps needed to connect to wifi and then save the wifi setting.  See my comments in the \"cons\" section.Second, I have not experienced the \"delay\" in the volume button, or switching from the internet connection or the Netflix app back to television.  It takes my unit less than 2-3 seconds to do so.  On start-up, unlike many led or lcd televisions, the Toshiba is almost an \"instant on\" unit.Third, the picture quality is outstanding, though tweaking of the factory settings will be necessary dependent on its placement in the room and the television's position in relationship to windows.  This would be necessary for any large screen tv, no matter the manufacturer.  Right now I just have the unit set to the \"dynamic\" setting for normal television viewing.  The picture in this setting is bright, crisp and clear.  If anyone would be interested in sharing their color settings I would appreciate it to potentially improve my picture quality.Fourth, my unit is used in a rather large room. I sit approximately 15 feet from the screen.  Both direct on and side viewing are excellent.  I have concluded that I do not need a sound bar.The cons:First, connecting and saving the wifi settings is confusing when you do it for the first time.  The manual is not very clear.  You have to use the remote, not the wireless keyboard that is included, to connect.  Once connected, however, the only time I have lost my wifi setting is after a power failure when the router went down.Second, there are limited apps, but I imagine over time additional apps will become available.Third, I am very disappointed in the wireless keyboard which was provided.  It seems sluggish and the built in pointer function is not precise at all.  It takes some getting used to, I imagine, but after three months I have not yet been able to master it.  If anyone has experimented with a different keyboard with better results, I would appreciate the information.Fourth, I too agree that having only one set of component inputs is a problem for those of us who don't have other devices with HDMI connections.  On the other hand, there are 4 HDMI connections.In conclusion, for everyday television viewing the unit is excellent.  The picture is crisp, bright and clear.  DVD's are just as good, even without an HDMI connection.  I do not seem to notice any problem with the sound level being inadequate.  Football has just started and watching the NFL broadcasts in HD this past weekend was awesome:  no blurring, no hesitation, and bright, vibrant color.  My other Toshiba is 4 years old and has never had a problem.  If this unit performs just as well I think it was a steal at the price I paid.", "Date": "September 11, 2013"}, {"Title": "Picture Settings", "Author": "Justin S.", "ReviewID": "RMYB8DMMT4KSV", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I only got this TV today, but I've owned Toshibas for five years. First thing I noticed on Movie picture setting was TOO GREEN! This is a great TV so I went back to the settings from my old 48\" Toshiba Regza from about four years ago. I think they work on this TV too. I've also noticed others looking for ideal settings for this TV. I think these settings are ideal, but to each his own. For what it's worth, here they are:These settings are for movies in 1080p or at least 720p in a dark room. For sports in a bright room or regular TV it will be different, or even for DVD, etc.Start in MOVIE mode. (press Pic Mode on the remote to get there). Exit back out of all menus once set on MOVIE.Press Setup on the remote. Go into the Picture submenu. Set the basic settings as follows:Backlight 32Contrast 81Brightness 3Color 6Tint 0Sharpness 4Go into Advanced Picture Settings submenu. Turn ON Color Master.Then go into Base Color Adjustment submenu. Adjust as follows:Red: Hue (H) 4 Saturation (S) 0 Brightness (B) -2Green: H -15 (yes that much) S 5 B 1Blue: H -11 (yep) S 4 B 0Yellow: H 3 S -4 B 0Magenta: H -2 S -2 B 3Cyan: H 5 S 0 B -1I can't figure out how to adjust Color Temperature beyond cool, medium, and warm. But if you can, adjust as follows: Red o 1 gain 11; green o 4 gain 2; blue o -1 gain -11.Turn OFF Auto Brightness Sensor.Dyna Light ON.Dynamic Contrast MIDDLE.Noise Reduction OFF (all of it. OFF. this is important. This should never be on for HDMI sources. There is no noise to reduce. Use this only for VHS or some other antique video source or maybe standard definition TV through HDMI).Edge Enhancer. OFF.ClearScan OFF. (I know this is an advertised feature of the TV but for movies in Blu Ray or other 1080p source, I like to watch in 24hz.that is how it looks in the theater. If you turn on clear scan, you are editing the true version. It also gives rise to the \"Soap Opera Effect\" where film looks like videotape).Again, these are my preferences for Blu Ray of other high quality (1080p) video. For 720p cable, especially sports events, I turn on ClearScan to Standard or even Smooth. I also will turn up Brightness and Backlight or even switch to other preset modes on the TV. But for ALL Modes, I leave those color adjustments to turn down the green. I think this looks much more life like. But experiment on your own. Cheers!I only ranked four stars because of clunky Internet setup and menus. Picture is five stars, especially when setup as above.", "Date": "January 21, 2014"}, {"Title": "Very Disappointed", "Author": "Thomas M. Taylor \"runman\"", "ReviewID": "RHF742ZVYK5E", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "This television replaced a 52 inch LCD that was 5 or 6 years old.  This Toshiba has good picture quality with deep dark blacks and rich colors, looks great while playing the xBox and very easy set up.Pros:Picture qualityPicture colorBlacksComes with a keyboard (although keyboard is about useless)ease of set upswivel baseI have a lot of home videos that I have made through the years to include AVI, MP4 and MKV saved on a USB hard drive.  This TV will play them all.  But please read the cons to see the draw back.Cons:Cloud smart TV.  Where are the apps?  There are about 12 apps. Netflix, Vudu, Hulu are the best ones, no Amazon VOD, CNET, Fox News, Revision 3.  When it comes to apps, there are almost none.This TV is slow.  It can take 20 to 30 seconds to switch from Netflix back to the home screen.  It takes so long I thought the TV was frozen and got the Microsoft blue screen of death.  50% of the time, when I press a volume key, it takes 10 seconds or more for the TV to respond.. This slowness is throughout the TV software.  When trying to go through home movies it takes a long time to get through the list of movies, and the search function is about worthless.The internet browser is laughable too.  The TV runs Linux and the Google Chrome internet Browser.  The Browser does not support flash.  That means you cannot watch Amazon prime videos via the internet and you cannot access YouTube videos via the internet, you must use the built in You Tube app.  That stinks because when searching for something on Google, I often find a You Tube video in the Google search engine, I cannot just click on the link, I have to stop, exit internet browser (takes 10 seconds or so for the TV to respond), go to the You Tube app (takes 10 seconds to respond)and then try and find the video, which can take a lot of time.The lack of flash support is a Chrome thing, but since there are no alternative apps for web browsing and no ability to download a flash player or software or apps for that matter, this is a major down side of the TV.The included key board is almost a joke.  You can use it to input user name and passwords into your Netflix and Vudu account but have to use the TV hand held remote to press the enter button.  Very frustrating.Every time the TV shuts off, I have reconnect it to my wireless network.  Nothing listed on the internet about this problem.The TV does include a Skype app, but you have to purchase a special web cam to do that.Another thing that I really dislike are the ads in the Cloud TV.  I am always getting a QVC, Disney Store and Angies list ads.  I guess it would not be so bad, but the apps for the TV are very limited and I think that Toshiba should be working on making the Cloud TV worth something and spend less time worrying about ads.  Vudu apps has better and more apps than Toshiba has.The included remote is not a universal remote.  The remote is set up for different devices via the TV software.  Once the set up is complete, you plug IR blasters to the back of the TV and place them 2 inches away from the device they are to operate.  The TV does come with two IR blasters though.The included remote must be pointed directly at the TV's IR receive for the remote to work.Toshiba has recently updated their software.  I think the upgrade went from \"sucking\" to only \"stinking\".I had the TV listed as 3 stars but now lowering the TV down to 2 stars.  If it wasn't for the facts that the wireless set up was easy and the picture was good, I would give it one star.Very disappointed in this TV.  I have had other Toshiba TV's in the past and they were good quality televisions.  Not to sure what happened here, but I will be returning this one ASAP.  My non working TV is almost better.8/12/13I got YouTube to work, but TV keeps loosing wireless connection when turned off.  I tried the IR blaster that comes with the TV.  It will turn my DVD player on and off, will not operate my Sony surround system...When you exit from one of the few apps on this TV, you get a blank screen.  After exiting, you them have to press the home button.  So if you purchase this TV and are staring at a blank screen for more than 30 seconds, press the home button.  The bad part about this fault is that the TV is slow to change screens any how.  You are not sure if the tv is stuck or just really slow at loading the screen.I did ask for help on the Wi-Fi drop issue via their web site, Toshiba was real helpful and requested that I called them.  They had no solution.I gave this TV 2 stars because the TV does turn on (one star) and has a nice picture (the second star)9/5/2013Since I have owned the TV, there have been 2 firmware updates,  well not really, just changes to the \"cloud\" portion of the TV.When Toshiba needs to change the advertisers on the \"Cloud TV\" home screen, you have to go through a process that takes 5 minutes or so.  The you get brand new ads.Still no flash support.The TV has become unresponsive twice, once randomly and once when Netflix was paused.  Look at the Toshiba web site, called tech support and their response was to unplug the TV, wait 1 minute, and then plug the TV back in.  Toshiba is aware of the problem and the problem in related to a DLNA problem.  This problem is not unique to this TV, Toshiba has had this problem for a couple years on different types of TVs, according to their forum.No apps have been added.  I think in total there are 18 apps.  Netflix, Vudu Youtube, Nova, Facebook and a few others...  That is it.  I was hoping that while they were updating the \"cloud\" that they would add a few apps.I fixed the Wi-Fi problem by adding a switch and running some RJ-45 cable.  So the fix is to turn off the WiFi and run a wires.Still has a nice picture though, which is great when Toshiba loads up new ads for you to look at when you turn the TV on.Update 11/7/2013The home screen on the TV no longer works.  When I press the Home button, I just a message that says it is loading and then a few minutes later and error message, the the TV repeats the loading and error message routine and the only way to stop this cycle is to unplug the TV and then plug it back in.The HDMI ports work fine.  To keep any \"smart\" function as far as a \"smart TV\" goes, I have had to hook an computer to the TV and use the TV keyboard with the computer.  Now I get Netflix, Amazon, Hulu and Vudu, thanks to the computer and not the television.Update 16/6/2013This is my last update for this TV.  I got tired of having to unplug the TV to reset it, looking at ads, the wireless not working and the like and I purchased a 60\" TV from a large discount retailer for less than seven hundred dollars.  And the new TV has a picture that is just as good, and has Hulu, Netflix, Amazon VOD, Vudu and others, plus the new TV actually has apps.", "Date": "August 11, 2013"}, {"Title": "Great TV for the money", "Author": "Ryan Raubolt", "ReviewID": "R1SYA7X61X5H5O", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Very happy with this purchase. The picture looks great and the TV is super thin. For all the features in this TV going with a Samsung or a Sony TV would have ended up costing me around $4K.Don't expect much with the included wireless keyboard, it's not great. The only thing I really use the included connectivity for is Netflix which works great on this TV.All around solid.EDIT: 6/27/13Had the TV for a little over a month now and found a really neat feature I wanted to share. When the TV is on Wifi and my phone is also on the Wifi network I can wirelessly connect my phone to the TV through my YouTube app. This is on my Galaxy Nexus running 4.2.2, there is a small TV icon inside the YouTube app that will push the video to the TV. What is really neat is that while the video is playing you can search for more videos on the phone without disrupting the video. There is also an option to add additional videos to a queue.

We got it all hooked up, and I was happy with the picture, but not in love with it.  I actually went back to the store we bought it from to discuss returning it and I looked at other TVs.  I found one that was much more expensive with a beautiful picture.  I just couldn't wrap my head around spending so much more money, so I started a review search on this Toshiba TV.  I found a wonderful review by Justin S.  He gave this TV a 4 star review.  He put in his review the exact picture adjustments he made to get the best picture.  I went through and did them all and voila!!!  I now have a beautiful picture just as life like as the much more expensive TV I almost bought tonight!!!

With this purchase, I was leaning toward Spending more money for a Samsung product, but couldn't get myself to pay the extra $1000 for an equivalent Samsung LED.I chose LED because I have a girlfriend who is lazy with the TV, and would be sure to \"burn in\" a plasma.I was very skeptical to purchase this TV based on some of the negative reviews.  Once examining other reviews, I notice that none of them complained about the picture quality.  For me, that is why I buy a TV.  It looks fantastic.I have a Blu-Ray, Xbox, Media Center Computer & rabbit ears connected to this TV.  The only issue I have had so far, is a design flaw when connecting your coax cable to the antenna input.  For some reason, the back panel \"juts\" out next to the antenna input, and requires a very small housing for the coax cable.  If you have a coax cable that has the extra \"assisted\" connector ( 1 inch long addition to connector that makes the \"male\" end easier to turn), it won't fit.  I had to buy a new cord with as little bulk to the connector as possible to get it to connect easily.  I am not taking any stars off, because it isn't affecting the quality of experience.-Wifi setup at the beginning was a breeze.  Haven't had an issue with it dropping signal, ever.-Switching inputs only takes 1-2 seconds-Digital Audio delay, they have a  function that lets the TV determine if there is a delay or a manual option.  I found the manual option to be very helpful-Picture qualityis amazing-netflix app is great!  (wish they had amazon prime app)  Hopefully will update soon.-I have not used the \"cloud tv\" very much, as I have media center connected.-Haven't used the keyboard at all.-Wall mounted, easy for two people to put up.Edited 4/12/14:I am so pleased with this purchase.  The TV still looks amazing.  I did end up calibrating the picture based on the review mentioned above, and it only made it better.  If i could give this rating more stars, I would.

I have spent hours unsuccessfully trying to connect to my wireless router. Menu settings allows three wireless setup options; Easy Setup, etc. etc. None will work. Decided my router was old and probably obsolete so I upgrade to a new Belkin AC Router. Improved the speed, etc of all my other devices on the network, but alas, the Toshiba still will not communicate with the NEW router. In checking the online forums, it appears the Toshiba engineers have designed a device that is almost impossible for a novice to connect as a wireless device. My next move is to rewire/reroute so I can hook up the TV directly to to the router via an RJ45 ethernet connection. The forums indicate this usually solves the connection issue (but did it really?)

I read the reviews, and all the complaints / low ratings were based on the 'smart' tv functions, no-one faulted the picture. For the price & size i decided on this over a 55\" Samsung, and i'm very happy i did. I had no need for 3D, and will likely not use the smart features at all, all i was looking for was a great picture & reasonable sound. This TV delivers that for sure, and to be honest after a quick look thru the smart features they were not at all bad, not terribly slow.

I only had a few issues with it.  I also have a 55in Toshiba.  With the 55in you can put up the stand first and then lift the TV onto it, which makes it possible for only one person to handle it.  With the 65in, the stand has to be attached to the TV first because the screws that attach the stand can only be screwed in from underneath the bottom of the stand.  So, trying to lift the TV with the stand attached will require two people, unless you are very strong.  Another issue is that there seems to be fewer settings that can be changed on the 65in than what is available on the 55in or maybe I just have not found them all yet.  It's a shame that companies no longer include an owner's manual with their TVs.  You have to go on the internet and download it. And the 55in has cable holders attached to the back for a neater appearance of the cables, while the 65in does not. Not a big problem, but thought I would mention it.  I have read that the sound on these thinner TVs is terrible because they are only 10 watt speakers and face downward, however while the sound is not great, its not that bad either, probably because I have it mounted on the stand as opposed to being flat up against a wall.Otherwise, the TV is gorgeous and the picture is beautiful. I have always liked the picture that Toshiba TVs have, I used to own a 60in rear projection TV before I purchased the 55in. I'm very satisfied with it and would recommend it to a friend.Updated 04/2014 - after only 4 months of heavy use, a light vertical ghost line has shown up today.  This is very disappointing since I have been a Toshiba fan for over 15 years.  It is too heavy for me to put back into the box and send to be repaired, so I'm hoping it doesn't get much worse.

If you switch between inputs like I do, such as from Dish to Antenna, or from a DVR to Dish to Antenna, etc. the CH RTN (Last Channel Return) button will switch between the last two channels you have viewed and between the last two inputs you have used.  Also, the inputs are numbered so to choose one you do not have to keep pushing the down arrow button until you reach it; you can just enter the number and you are there. One last feature that I have really gotten used to is the 1/2 mute, which works great during commercials, You can actually do something else like read during a commercial and you can hear at a low level when the commercials and the show returns.The reason I didn't give it 5 stars is because there is a bug that they need to fix. That is the input labels seem to get cleared out when the TV is powered off.  So you have to remember which HDMI or video inputs are for which devices that are attached. Once they fix that, I will be happier. As with all manufactures, I would prefer to have a hard copy of the User Manual, so I wouldn't have to have a PC next to me just to read the manual while trying out the features I'm interested in.", "Date": "August 31, 2013"}, {"Title": "Don't overlook", "Author": "Dave", "ReviewID": "R164QC5XTVF8Z2", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Casually looking for a tv turned into a purchase as it happens from time to time. In this case I bought from a big box store. Comparing this unit to others in the store was -- if you'll excuse my employing cliche -- night and day. The picture is exceptional. I find the Soap Opera Effect distracting so I turn down/off the clear scan feature myself. But, this thing is a great value and had a better picture than units priced $100 more. The smart tv functions are somewhat sluggish to be fair, but I also feel this technology is in its infancy and being that this unit connects to wifi, ideally future updates will help make it better.

Still problems", "Author": "Sage", "ReviewID": "R1VBLT6IN5TJ40", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "6/15/2013  The board was replaced and problems still exist. The sound keeps changing, then the input names get erased, sometimes the inputs work, other times they don't. Never had this issue with a 5 year older Sony and about the same with a Samsung. All I wait for now is the phone call from the freight company that will pick this thing up and return it to United. I did agree to a 15% restocking fee but who cares. II will pay for one so I know I can return it and get a different one if I choose to.If you want the best of everything, don't buy this one. Look at reviews on CNET, or CES to see what really works. If you are just looking for size with the cheapest price, this one will do well.I've had Sony, Samsung and Panasonic LED's and a 63\" Fujistu plasma so I know what works well. I got this one because I had so many miles on United it was basically free. The picture is great but will need actual calibration. I know what another reviewer says about calling for support. When you call, you go straight to the Phillipines. You are not talking to an engineer or anyone that really knows how it works. It's basically a flow-chart as you ask questions. They do a nice job but you will never speak to someone that actually knows how it works. The sound is pretty bad when compared to more expensive models but what do you expect? When you pay less, expect less. A soundbar at least is pretty much what is needed for any HDTV. If you are waiting for a big screen that will be about $1k, this will eventually make it.Let me answer most of your opinions with the fact that I have set up entire home theaters in the past and still own all of the proper items to get the greatest sound. Several rooms in in house with 5.1 surround sound. I know how most tvs work and I guess I should have researched more about this one before getting it.. The picture is great but definitely needs to be calibrated from factory settings. You will need a proper disk do to such work. People can be hired to do it. The remote is pretty much a loser so you will need to get a universal remote or some kind of IR blaster to use. It comes with one but if you have multiple items, it will be tough. I haven't even bothered since I already have Sony remotes. Sonos is on the way with a new sound bar. It does have wireless and wired abilities, but not as many online accesses as I would like. That's just a matter of contracts for Toshiba.It is very thin and sits on top of a table very well. It is typical wall mount capable too. When you get it make sure you download the newest firmware. If you don't know how, I recommend you buy from a dealer that will set it up and calibrate it for you, not just drop it off and leave it all up to you. If you know something about setting a HDTV up, and can do it, go ahead. If you expect all the sound, decoding, and remotes you get from Sony, Samsung, Panasonic or LG, buy one of them but you will pay more. I just wanted one as soon as possible so I got this one. Like most manufacturers there have been a few new firmwares already. If you expect the complete \"user guide\", that is missing too. You have to print it on your own. Another way to keep the cost down and save resources.I am having continuos troubles with the HDMI #4 input. When the TV is off for some time, and I turn the tv back on and doesn't have any picture from the Uverse box. If I unplug the input from the TV then plug it back in, it works. Then it will forget it again when it is off for some time. That may be an issue since AT&T; Uverse uses the cheapest style of HDMI possible.That doesn't happen on the Samsung I currently own and never happened on the Sony before this one. Both HDTV's that are at least a few years old or more. I have tried other HDMI inputs and they all don't work properly. I keep renaming the input sites and it keeps forgetting them and going back to original. I'm sure there is a short or bad design in the main board but it is scheduled to be replaced. I have to wait until Toshiba sends the part to the scheduled repair service. My SONY Blu-Ray works well and communicates perfectly with the TV. I will keep trying though.All in all, it's a nice HDTV, sounds OK, decent picture, thin bezels, works fairly well. I have lowered this one and added another review. Problems continue.

They claimed they would not know if my TV would be in stock till the day it was supposed to be shipped.When it arrived, I thought the picture quality was decent and the components all worked well.  Then I realized a cloudy gray spot in the middle of the screen during dark scenes.  They \"auto\" settings made the picture extremely dark and made movies very difficult to watch.  The picture features would not give me full control of the screen unless I wanted to set everything to the right levels.  The \"game, movie, standard...\" modes hardly made a difference and I found it ridiculous to go deep into settings for everything I wanted to watch.NHL Playoffs looked horrible. As did the NHL game coincidently.  The colors blur like crazy, even with the 240Hz turned on and theres visible verticle lines because the picture is trying to catch up.  I understand this is common in LCD, but I have never seen it so apparent.The \"smart tv\" functions are extremely slow and the keyboard is not as responsive as it should be.  Given the fact I have a PS3, I figured it wouldn't be a must have in a TV but I was sold on the interface and functions.  In my opinion, the smart functions are nothing to get excited about.
