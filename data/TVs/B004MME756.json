It did without problem. I ended up having to go out and on the way home rented a 3D Movie to play via Playstation 3 to the television. I got home, popped it in, set up the 3D glasses and settings and was AMAZED at how great the picture was. The blacks are truly BLACK (To the point where all black screens made me do a double take, thinking I turned the television off) and the colors were vibrant. I bought this blindly thinking \"Hey 3D Might be cool\" but have to say I am completely hooked on it now!The next day I plugged in my laptop via HDMI and ran a few tests, Input lag and dead pixels mainly (Input lag will be covered later). I noticed a problem...Two dead pixels, One fully black on red images and the other black no matter the color.I called Amazon and was met with a very nice representative who helped me get a replacement shipped under the agreement I'd ship the current set back when I received the replacement. She even upgraded my shipping to 1 day (Because I called on a Friday I guess and they couldn't ship until Monday).I received the replacement 7 days ago and after unboxing it and testing (once again) for input lag, flashlighting (uneven backlight), or dead pixels I saw no issues. The original television I got must've been an uncommon mistake.Over the course of the first few days having it I decided to get a calibration disk (after deciding I'd keep it) to REALLY see what this baby could do.After 2-3 hours of calibrating I was WOWED once again by how beautiful and picture perfect the image quality, blacks, and colors were. Everything looks natural and \"just right\".So, All in all I'm VERY impressed and happy with this product, The colors and image quality were far superior to anything I saw at my retail store (Which, ironically, sells this television for $400 more). Having now played through a few games on it, watched a few movies and done just about everything I could imagine myself doing I can't find a single REAL fault that would make me think twice about getting this again.INPUT LAG: I know this isn't covered in most reviews and this is SPECIFICALLY why I went with this television. The input lag is non existent. That isn't me telling you \"I don't see it while gaming\"... That's me telling you after testing it thoroughly. Input lag versus a CRT in Game Mode was an average of 16ms, One frame or less of lag. I've used this with a mouse and keyboard (which should feel it best out of anything, though the tests say it themselves) and there was nothing. Nada. Fighting games? SSF4, Tekken, and Mortal Kombat all felt or saw nothing. FPS games had the same performance. This set has been ran for gaming on a PC, PS3, and Xbox 360 and all of them are brilliantly flawless in performance via HDMI. This was NOT the same experience of my former HDTV.PROS:-AMAZING Picture Quality-Completely even backlighting-NO Input Lag AT ALL-IPS Panel-Fully featured settings list-3D Performance is mindblowing-Not a single dead pixel on the replacement-VERY Sturdy Construction compared to other designsCONS:-Power cable doesn't detach from the television, Not a problem for me but might be for others-Original unit had multiple dead pixelsOTHER COMMENTS:-Be sure to note that the screen and bezel are both GLOSSY, Some people are bothered by this but I personally think it looks great!This has been rated 4 out of 5 stars because of the pixel problems with the original unit, though I fully recommend this set now that I have one of proper quality.", "Date": "May 30, 2011"}, {"Title": "Holy Crap!!", "Author": "jomo", "ReviewID": "RDFRXJA93GD7Y", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This set is way better than i expected. Picture quality,color and contrast are stunning. I purchased this set for my son after reseaching every set in the 40\" range. Last years sony hx800,which blows away this years ex720,was the top contender until i found this set. I watched avatar 3D on this and the VT25 plasma and saw little difference. I also watched basketball in 3D on directv and experienced no motion blurr. I looked very hard for flashlighting and blooming but saw none. Positioning the leds on the top and bottom seems to work very well. My son played black ops and killzone 3 in 3D and we both were very impressed. I wish they made this in a 55'. I'm waiting on the xbr hx929 to come out. I saw the sammy und8000 at my buddy's house. I was not impressed. I like this panasonic better. The wifi dongle connected to my dir-655 flawlessly. The internet works but we we will never use it. My son and i both have htpc's connected to our sets which makes the tvs connection unnecessary. I am very pleased with this set and am glad i found it.

I was lucky and got one with no Flashlighting and no clouding.  From the thread on AVSForum com those 2 issues plague quite a number of the 2011 sets from various manufacturers.Overall I was quite impressed with the 3D in Avatar, most other movies look little better than 2D converted to 3D but I attribute this to the quality of the material being produced by the movie industry.  3D demos from nVidia via PC looked great and really popped so the set works well in that respect.2D to 3D conversion on the whole works OK.  It tends to make some mistakes on Landscape type scenes and does better with interiors although shadows and dark areas still seem way out of place at times.  It is quite clear some eggheads worked on getting the human form to convert from 2D to 3D pretty well though as people often look good.One main reason for this purchase was gaming and for that the extremely low input lag makes this a great set.The picture quality is very nice with deep blacks and good color with just one issue.Now on to that single issue.  Internally this set does a very poor conversion to 4:2:0 Chroma Subsampling even when fed a feed that is pure RGB or one specified as 4:4:4.  There is no way to disable this downsampling that occurs and it can damage colors that use red and/or blue when next to each other or black.  Panasonic support says there are no service menu options for disabling this downsampling as well.Most of the time this downsampling issue will not be noticed (most TV, DVD, most Bluray content).  However, when using Panasonic's own high end DMP-BDT350 bluray player and I would imagine several of their other lower end units that feature the \"High Precision 4:4:4\" Chroma Sampling for \"More Vibrant, Smooth and Truthful Color Reproduction\" this can be noticed on occasion.  This can also be noticed when using gaming consoles such as PS3 and Xbox 360.  It is also noticeable with a Home Theater PC and even the WDTV Live Plus.  It is the worst when Red or Blue text is on a black background.  I've also noticed it during laser grids in some movies (like when you see those red lines for laser security).  Note: output from the same exact devices to a Sharp LC-32GP3U and even a cheap 22\" Insignia did not have this Chroma Subsampling down sample issue from the same sources.  This issue occurs regardless of input used, options selected, and as previously described is impossible to avoid according to tier 3 support from Panasonic (which took 4 days to call me back).Overall this is a pretty good set for the price with 3D in this size range.  It has one very disappointing flaw especially considering Panasonic in their bluray player line have been since 2010 touting the value of accurate color reproduction.  This flaw from what I have read affects all of the 2010 and 2011 sets across the LCD and Plasma lines from Panasonic and is likely related to one of the processing chips they chose.I've decided to keep this set but I'm definitely looking to upgrade in a year or 2 when more sets in the same size are available with less issues.", "Date": "August 31, 2011"}, {"Title": "Fantastic HDTV", "Author": "D. Mui \"typehyDro\"", "ReviewID": "R1KZZFLDXBY8SC", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I bought this tv to replace my bedroom tv, which was previously a 32\" LG. The color on this TV is very vibrant and bright and has nice picture all in all.The 2d->3d feature is borderline useless. It adds very little depth at the cost of brightness, clarity, and sharpness. The 3d feature itself is nice, however I have yet to watch an actual 3d Blu-Ray movie on it due to the limited selection presently. The only actual 3d supported media is with Black Ops and Killzone 3 (both ps3 games) and on those it adds a very nice 3d effect, but once again i find it more of a novelty as it doesnt actually help you in any way shape or form and just ends up tiring out my eyes, but still a nice feature.The 240hz reduces motion blur alot more but doesnt get rid of it completely. It is leaps and bounds better than my old 60hz LG and 120hz Samsung however. (I had a side by side comparison with my LG and Samsung watching the Masters)The picture options were plentiful and allows you to change all the hues and colors to your liking.  The remote is sorta cheap (arent they always?) but it gets the job done. It is missing a profile button on the remote though (the button that changes from Standard, Cinema, Custom, Vivid etc...) and I find it annoying to go into the menu everytime to change it. (I like to play games on a higher brightness than when watching TV).I do wish the power cord was independent of the TV but thats not really a big concern.The slim frame of the TV is very nice and looks amazing if you hang it on the wall. The IPS Panel is very glossy and gets dirty VERY easily (fingerprint/dust magnet). I find this TV very glare resistant too, much more so than my old LG. The auto brightness calibrator is very good too, especially at night.On a side note I also use to TV as my laptop monitor since my laptop has hdmi out and initially there was no sound and i had to update my VIDEO card drivers to get sound back. So if you have that problem try updating as this is a really new TV Model.

I purchased it from Amazon Warehouse in \"like new\" condition for a SUBSTANTIAL discount.  The TV arrived in excellent condition and was, indeed, like new (except for the packaging).  I purchased this TV to replace a 32\" Sharp 720p TV in the bedroom.  I choose the DT30 because it was essentially a 37\" tv that has the dimensions of a 32\" tv and was able to fit in my wife's armoire (which I would ditch and put an even larger tv in its place if it were up to me).  I have to say though that, for a 37\" tv, this Panny really packs a big picture.  The image quality is truly jaw dropping right out of the box.  The color gamut is remarkable and vibrant.  The blacks are inky dark and even in high contrast scenes, I saw no evidence of blooming of flashlighting that is often complained about on some other LED-LCD TV's like the Samsung UN40D6500.  The IPS panel makes a huge difference--there is no meaningful loss of clarity in the picture when watching from wide angles.  This is a TV designed with gamers in mind.  According to many of the techies that post on AVS Forum, the tv's 2ms response time is no joke and there is absolutely no lag on this tv.  For gaming this is the number one tv on the market period.I am not, however, a gamer.  I want to spend my tv time enjoying a gorgeous picture--this tv delivers in spades.  It blows away my 40\" Sony XBR2 that sits in my den and brings high definition to a whole new level.  I'll give you an example of how much of a difference this tv can make.  Several months ago I owned a Sony Bloggie Touch (that I kept for a week).  At the time, I considered the Sony Bloggie Touch to be a piece of crap.  The 1080p video looked terrible on XBR2--grainy and excessively noisy, with lots of visible judder and trailing.  Colors were oversaturated no matter how hard I tried to clean it up.  I consider this video to be essentially unwatchable.  I ran this video through the Panny, with the Cinema Motion 5 dialed up to strong and noise reduction on and.... low and behold... even this crappy video looked great!!!  Now, the video quality on the bloggie is still crap (IMO), but if this tv can make that video look good, imagine what it does with high quality blu ray movies???  People, this is a true reference level TV and, in my humble opinion, this TV performs nearly as well as the Pioneer Elite Pro-111FD (still best tv ever made--if only I could have afforded one).  I was just watching Avatar off my Verizon Fios dvr box and you could swear you looking at a Blu Ray.  I also watched Clash of the Titans in 3d off of Fios on Demand (free) and the 3d effects were awesome.  The only knock on 3d performance would be that the 3d effect may be better on a larger tv, but even watching it at 10' away you still felt enveloped by the movie's 3d effect (the movie's plot itself sucked and wasn't close to as good as the original).The viera cast may be great, but I am currently having problems getting the tv to handshake with either of my wireless routers.  I am not ready to blame it on Panasonic yet and have a few more experiments to play with before I start calling help lines.  I'll update this part of the review when I have a fix for the problem.  Honestly, this is one heck of a t.v.  If you're looking for a 37\" tv and you're willing to spend the bucks to get performance, this is the TV for  you.Update 6/28/11:  I hooked up a wireless n router and was able to connect to the TV with no problem.  It seems the wifi issue I am having has to do with the security protocols I have set up on the avtec router that Fios uses.  I am running the wireless n router opened with no security protocols at the moment, which my not be all that smart--but I am only using the router to stream video and it's not being used for networking.  I'll continue to work on a solution.  That said, viera cast is a great product.  The navigation and set up are easy and it actually has really good apps: Cinema Now, Netflix, Amazon on Demand, mlb.tv, fox sports, weather channel, wealth hd, twitter, skype, facebook etc.  Video quality on netflix is very good--on par with my apple tv.  I had no delays with streaming and there is less buffering time than with my Apple TV (so far).  I just have to figure out how to run the sound back to my AVR from the TV.Update 7/13/11:  I am still loving this tv!  For the nitpickers out there, there is corner flashlighting on this tv during start up with an all black screen and there is blooming around the letter during movie credits.  I have yet to see an edge lit LED-LCD TV that didn't have these issues, but when when there is an actual video image on the screen, these problems are not evident at all!  If you turn off the AI function in the menu (which controls the zone dimming), the flashlighting issue improves (but does not completely resolve).  Again though, this is not a big deal unless you are insanely anal retentive.  I have also since connect the tv to my router by ethernet and it is working fabulously.  Viera cast is loaded with goodies.  One thing I would like to see improved is the Netflix UI, which does not give you access to the full netflix library and does NOT include a search feature.  This UI can and should be improved with a firmware update.  To really use netflix on this tv, you need load all the content you want to watch into your instant-q on your computer and then you can access it on viera cast.  Panasonic should buy an apple tv or roku to see how the UI should be properly set up.  Once streaming though, I have NO complaints about the video or audio playback quality.", "Date": "June 27, 2011"}, {"Title": "Compelled to write this review!", "Author": "Imran", "ReviewID": "R2R1MUP79FJI1A", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I usually do not write reviews. Because I am just too lazy. However writing a review for this tv is worth the effort. I've been through samsung d6400 Samsung UN40D6400 40-Inch 1080p 120Hz 3D LED HDTV (Black) and sharp aquos 3d Sharp Quattron LC40LE835U 40-Inch 1080p 3D LED LCD TV -Black (both 2011 models). But ended up returning both to Amazon due to severe crosstalk in 3d. Trust me, I tried all the settings to calibrate 3D on these sets but the crosstalk just didn't go away. Finally I thought of giving this tv a try. Let me remind you that up until this point, i almost gave up hope for a proper 3D on an LCD screen. However this tv proved me completely wrong. Its not the sleekest tv out there or neither does it has all the extra bells and whistles in the tv settings. However it does a few things and it does it right.The IPS panel with 240hz refresh rate made me a believer in LCD 3D technology. If you need a LCD panel that does the 3D right, then look no further. The only downside is that Panasonic, doesn't offer any screen size bigger than 37inches in their LCD 3d lineup. Which is a downer, however personally to me, I would pick a 37 inch over 40 any day if it does what its suppose to do.Viera connect is a breeze, and this is the only tv among the other two that i've used so far to offer youtube with account management. Did I mention the horrible light leaks I found on both samsung and Sharp? I am not trying to be a Panasonic fanboy here. Sharp and Samsung are both respectable brands but I sincerely believe that Panasonic is a bit underrated when it comes to tv's.Finally, five stars to Amazon for their excellent customer service.

When I was searching for a midrange TV, something around 30 to 42 inches for the den, honestly the Panasonic wasn't my first choice (because I didn't know about it). I started with the Samsung UN32C6500. This was a 32 inch LED TV that had a very pretty design and the picture quality was okay but it just wasn't enough and it was way too overpriced. I sold that TV and then looked elsewhere. I looked at Sony, LG, Samsung, and Panasonic LED TVs. That was when I found out the DT30 series. This is the first time Panasonic has jumped into the LED TV fray, so it was difficult to find reviews and information on the TV. The reviews that I had read had only good things to say about the series. The design wasn't as sleek as the Samsung that I had or the one that I was also looking at (the UN40D6400) so I was unsure of what to buy. The difference came down to picture quality. To be frank, I didn't think that I would be paying attention to color reproduction and picture quality as much as I am now with this new Panasonic. I don't mean that in a bad way, this Panasonic produces some of the best color, black levels, and image that I have ever seen and it continues to amaze me even after the first month. Combined with essentially an all in one package, this is an wonderful TV.PROS=================================- Black levels and color reproduction is amazing. No backlight bleeding. Words can only say so much, find this TV somewhere and see for yourself.- Plenty of connection ports- Panasonic VIERA Connect (internet applications) is simply and easy to use. A lot better than Samsung's Smart TV application set up.- Settings menu is very easy to use.- No dead pixels- 3D picture is also one of the best that I've seen. I've watched movies and played video games (Killzone 3 and COD Black Ops) from my PS3 in 3D and have noticed no ghosting or artifacts. Produces good depth too. Way to go Panasonic!- No input lag. I probably didn't get better at video games but my controls are registered much faster than my previous HDTVs and that can mean the world in a fast paced game.- Includes everything that you would possibly need. Wi-fi adapter and 3D glasses. One of the things that annoyed me with other TVs is that none of these things were included, which meant added costs for these accessories. Panasonic provides everything in the package, which is a major plus.CONS================================- The power plug is integrated into the TV. Although Panasonic provides a good way to hold the plug close to the TV when moving, I would've liked a plug that could be detachable.- Streaming Netflix from the TV doesn't produce a very solid picture (probably because the TV has to download and process the picture) and sometimes the audio is choppy. I just use my PS3 for that.- The wifi dongle adds another two inches to the back of the TV. Not a problem for me but just so that you know...it would've been nice if wifi was integrated as well but hey, at least Panasonic includes the dongle.ConclusionA+, get this TV if you're looking for the perfect midrange TV. I bought the 37'' (cause it was cheaper than the 32'' for some reason) and I was not disappointed in my purchase.

Removal of such a stand - once attached - also can be problematic when one or more of the screws cannot be easily removed.).One of the few things that I didn't like about this TV was the WIFI implementation. I would have preferred truly integrated WIFI like Toshiba sets have; I don't care much for WIFI dongles (WIFI added as an afterthought) that unnecessarily and permanently tie up one USB port and also give the manufacturer another optional item to sell you. Nevertheless, the WIFI throughput was very good - no complaints.However, I did end up returning this TV to Amazon for 2 reasons:1) The surprising overall thinness of these new LED-LCD TVs meant that I was able to fit a notably larger set in the same space and this is what happened. I decided to get a 47\" TV instead. It's a tight fit, but it fits. It's too bad that this same Panasonic TV isn't available in a larger size. At the moment 37\" is as big as it gets or I might have stayed with Panasonic.2) Also, my father who is in his 80s apparently has some problems viewing active 3D televisions and I decided to go the other route of passive 3D to resolve the issue of bothersome flickering that he was experiencing (only noticeable after viewing the TV for longer periods of time).What I have ultimately ended up with is a  47\" Toshiba passive 3D LED-LCD TV 240Hz with integrated WIFI (no dongle) also purchased from Amazon.com.", "Date": "August 3, 2011"}, {"Title": "I'm so glad I decided on THIS tv! - Another gamer's review", "Author": "JRest \"JRest\"", "ReviewID": "R1BRI5FHBVEEZ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I was reluctant at first at buying a Panasonic tv, since I've owned Samsung tvs.  The problem with Samsung at this time is that all their tvs in the 37-42 inch range were all 120 hz, and for 3D, that isn't optimal!

A tv with no input lag for gaming, a 3D TV with 240 hz in the aforementioned tv size, wireless connection to my network/internet.Simply put...THIS TV DOES IT ALL!!!Now there are some slight issues with the LED-LCD technology, like \"flashlighting\" which most of these tv's suffer from.  Finding settings on the aforementioned website in which people have the tv calibrated and shared the settings, made the tv (which out of the box was beautiful), minimizes the flashlighting issues.I've had this tv for 2 weeks now, and have experienced the 3D using the PlayStation 3 watching an old James Bond movie (View To A Kill) with the 2D to 3D conversion, it made the movie watching experience exciting.

I don't own any 3D titles yet but my gosh, can only imagine how that will look!I echo the sentiments of another customer, \"ZERO\", who posted on here in terms of gaming.  No input lag at all! I'm approaching 40 and enjoy my videogaming. I play PS3 as well as Xbox360 games and I seem to do better when I play on this Panasonic than when I play on the bigger DLP TV.  My friends even joke and know when I'm on this tv or my older one when end of game stats appear.The apps that come with the Vieracast, are your typical ones: Netflix, Accuweather, Pandora, FoxNews, MLBTV.com etc. and also have some mini games to play.  Best part is (which I discovered by mistake) is you can have the 8 apps open and in the center square, can have your tv/game or whatever you were watching on the active input, so you don't miss out on anything while messing around with the apps.The tv comes with a USB wireless dongle but also has an ethernet port.  I'm running wireless and when the tv was first turned on, it instantly recognized my router/network and within 25 seconds was online.The 3D glasses included are comfortable and I have no issues with them.The one thing I have not tried is connecting a computer, but I will be doing that soon with the purchaseof the recently released Mac Mini!!!

I don't have any test DVD with some pattern like old TVs used to have it just looks good and since most DVDs have their own problems and perfectionists would need to make individual adjustments anyway I just checked that making further adjustments is possible and stopped there.Also I didn't expect that away from big cities on standard over-the-air antenna of a camper it would be able to receive 25 channels. Pleasant surprise.The Glasses: they are certainly far from being comfortable. Also they have small height and sit far from eyes (to allow for regular glasses) so light can come through the space between your face and glasses' surface and create a lot of reflections from inside surfaces of the glass. in some types of light could be very annoying and mess up the viewing. As far as charging i haven't had any problem. i am sure it could last longer, i just plug it in after a day or two of viewing (2-3 hours) and never had a problem.I didn't test/use the network and internet features.", "Date": "August 5, 2011"}, {"Title": "Excellent 3D - Awesome TV", "Author": "AHannah", "ReviewID": "R1ZE1C1E76TJMB", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I've had this TV since May 2011 and still marvel at the excellent 2D and 3D viewing.The 37\" size is perfect for a bedroom or den.

I liked the 42E, but noticed some blurring with HD and sports content. It also was bigger than I needed for my home office. Despite my reluctance to pay nearly double for the 37DT, I've been thrilled with its performance. I watched a lot of football over the weekend (including a loss by my beloved Crimson Tide). Not the slightest blur or choppy picture. Avatar looked spectacular; even moreso when I watched it in 3D.At first, I thought Amazon mistakenly sent the 32\" version. No, it was the 37\", but the bezel is considerably tighter/thinner than on other flat screen TVs I'd seen. That's just fine with me. The swivel stand is a nice touch, too.All things considered, I'm very happy with my purchase. If you've got the $$, the L37DT30 is a fantastic buy.As always, Amazon's RMA procedures are unmatched anywhere. They picked up my L42E30 in one day (return shipping paid by Amazon) and the refund will be processed by week's end.

AMAZON ROCKS. Panasonic makes very good high quality televisions. Their plasma TV's are the best in the business. I own a 2010 Panasonic 3D Plasma. I can honestly say the picture on this  TC-L37DT30 is almost identical to the plasma. If you want plasma quality picture performance in the form of a 37\" LCD TV. This is the set for you. The picture is sharp and the colors are vibrant and accurate. One of the most important aspects of picture quality is deep black levels. With a little tweaking I can actually get deeper blacks out of this TV than I can with my plasma. You have to sacrifice a little brightness, but if you turn the backlight way down and have the AI picture mode on, this TV will produce the deepest of blacks. Because the TV use's local dimming edge LED's you do get some \"blooming\". When you have an all black background with bright text like movie credits for example. The black background around the text gets a little brighter than the rest of the screen. I've never seen this blooming effect while watching regular TV and movie content however. This slight bleeding of whites into blacks is inherent in all dynamic edge LED displays and in no way should be a deal breaker. Most edge LED TV's have flashlighting in the corners, this TV does not. As for the build quality, the TV is built out of metal instead of plastic. Even though the TV is very thin, it still seems very solid and heavy duty. The sound quality is good for a thin LED. The remote is easy to use and lights up red (kind of cool). If you're a gamer you can't go wrong with this TV. There is virtually no input lag in game mode. Motion blur is a non issue because the TC-L37DT30 comes equipped with Panasonic's redesigned IPS Alpha LCD panel. pixel response time is almost instantaneous, you don't get any of the trailing or ghosting like you get from traditional LCD displays. I don't know what it is but games look almost 3D on this TV when its not in 3D mode. You get a real feeling of depth and perspective. I've owned Sony, LG, and lots of Samsung, LCD's, they all have their good aspects but none of them are the \"total package\" like the TC-L37DT30 is.

My new TCL37DT30 arrived on 8/30/11.  I hooked it up that evening and after a few minutes exactly half of the picture was just vertical colored lines.  I unplugged and replugged and it continued.  I checked with my Seller and he said since arrived in box ok and not obviously damaged in shipment, my recourse was with Panasonic direct.  I called them on 8/31/11 and they said my only option was to take the brand new $1000+ tv to their local authorized repair person (15 miles away) for repair.  I did.  They called the next day to say they knew it at least needed a new board and they would order one from Panasonic and have in on 9/7/11.  I called on 9/7/11 and they said Panasonic could not recognize the board part number and they could not find it so they were sending the request up the line at Panasonic.  So I called Panasonic direct later on 9/7/2011 and after 35 minutes waiting on the telephone they said they could not help me as they could only replace my new tv if it was unrepairable after 60 days.  I asked the representative to ask management and they did and affirmed this policy.  I say - beware of Panasonic's products if this is the way they treat customers.  This is not a \"customer friendly\" policy.

Played my Blu-ray 3D Tron without a hitch and the included preview for Pirates of the Caribbean Stranger Tide in 3D made for a nice demo. I should add that it worked seamlessly when connected to cable box as well. I have not had a chance to try out the internet apps and Viera Connect feature but am hopeful that the promised app for use with a treadmill will be available to be used with my existing treadmill even if it requires adding some type of adaptor.

Makes watching TV so much better.. but the main things i figured out and an very impressed with are: the DLNA and Apple AirPlay.. DLNA simply took enabling streaming the DLNA D30 net under Win Media Player .. but the GUI on the TV is what amazed me most. It's very fast to find and fill the directory and even tho i have tens of thousands of folders back to 1980, it sorts them all by date, name and preference (favorites) and builds a directory VERY fast on screen with good playback control to pause, fast forward etc during playback of content from your PC's hard drive (only thing I really miss is the means to rotate the video 180 degrees on playback).. It plays all the formats (unlike if playing from USB) including .mp4, .avi. .wmf and AVHCD camcorder all seem to play and handle the audio fine.. The other exceptionally cool thing that worked just fine with the iPhones and iPad was the Remote app ( that lets you navigate the TV options vis any iPhone /iPad.. and AirPlay..  is really great option if you have HBO GO or any number of videos and pictures on these devices ( or your friends ).. it plays any picture slideshows or video with AirPlay, along with the audio just fine up on this TV.. it's great.Yes, it's so cool to be able to take a huge batch of pictures ( tho it does not do Movies) in the Viera Connect app, then post and sync them on Picasa with one click.. .. then play them as a slideshow  on this TV in the living room with background music.. but now i can also do the same via AirPlay and pick my own Pandora channel audio too.When i reviewed it last i had not set up the Logitec Harmony Remote .. and that works flawlessly too .. I have the Cox Cable Settop Box on HDMI 1, BlueRay on HDMI2, Apple TV on HDMI 3 and \"all others\" on a 5 way switch coming in HDMI 4.. that works great and a single button turns the TV, set top box, and AV switch ON or all three OFF.. and controls the volume displaying TVo'd content and channels etc.. from the Harmony remote. i have the older Logitec Harmony similar to the model 520 available now.Could it do even MORE? .. yes I'd like a web browser, and a few other things but this TV is a huge step forward for me.. and am very pleased.----------------The 1st one i received looked fantastic. ( It looked far better alongside several other mrf's 37 inch models at Fry's too).. but it would only stay On for 5 seconds to 5 minutes before the screen would blank and POWER ON LED would start blinking.. The Panasonic support rep took 30 minutes to pick up and answer.. but confirmed it was bad after repeating several checks I'd already tried.  Amazon's customer support is great, and sent out a new one the next day and I've had one evening to play with it so far..  A key reason I got it because this 37 inch diagonal screen fits with about an inch to spare within a 36' wide Home theater cabinet. The picture is superb, set up was easy, reloading a new firmware update took about 10 minutes total on a wired CAT 5 connection but it took it fine, Netflix, Picasa, Twitter, etc.. were easy to set up thru the remote.. but i definitely miss the KEY thing all these internet capable TV's seem to lack .. which is a plain and simple Chrome, FireFox Safari or IE browser.. you are locked into their Viera Connect content and that alone REALLY irritates me.. if anyone knows how to get a browser installed and woking on this TV I'd be all ears..  Content from my Cox Set Top box, Apple TV, LG BlueRay and even some picts and videos from a camcorder via USB thumb drive all look great but the USB video's I played said \"Incompatible Audio Format\" i may need to covert them i guess.. more on that unsolved issue later.. the Digital Audio thru my Sony AV switch and the local speakers sounded great, and the volume is twice what my older Samsung TV would produce.  i use a Logitec Harmony Remote and need to set this TV up on it, and also have been using a 5 way external HDMI Switch and tho it works fine i want to dedicate the 3 or possibly 4 inputs to the HDMI jacks provided and leave the 5 way external HDMI switch for future devices.  I have not tried using the Apple AirPlay or Remote yes and when i tried the DLNA option it could see the two shared drives but not let me see any content in them yet.. likely a setup issue..  Overall I am very happy and will update this review as I learn more about how to solve the issues seen so far..
