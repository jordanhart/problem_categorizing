My first smart TV maybe I can replace my Roku. Nope not all. Although the quality o the picture is very crisp and clear with bright colors. The smart TV part is not good. You only get 3 apps (Netflix,YouTube and Pandora) that's it.  I was reading and assume it would be a interacting smart TV kind of like the Toshiba Cloud just strip down. Well it's more like bone dry. They should never market this as a smart TV by any means. I'm giving it 4 stars for the picture quality. But big fat zero for it being a smart TV.", "Date": "May 7, 2014"}, {"Title": "Not compltely sold on this", "Author": "User1", "ReviewID": "R1EOCAALDTIIRD", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I purchased this to replace a 47'' LG 47LN5400 that had been stolen. I really liked that TV, so when I was doing my research and shopping around I was using that TV as my baseline for comparison. I was pretty set to go with LG again, but when in the store I was unimpressed with the re-design done to the LGs. For some reason the backs of the LGs are thicker now than they were in 2012 and I think the red LG logo looks cheap, but anyway this isn't a LG review and the exterior looks are not really part of the TV viewing experience anyway.While browsing in the store I came across this Toshiba that on paper seemed to be an upgrade from the my last TV in terms of the 3x HDMI ports (LG only had two), slightly larger screen my (previous one was 47''), smart capabilities (my previous one was not), and in the same price range. I did a side by side comparison of the two TVs and was still thinking that the LG's picture quality looked better, but ended up pulling the trigger and getting the Toshiba thinking that it might look better once I got it home and was able to mess with the picture settings some more.I have a couple hours now of viewing time and messing with the configurations, but am still not confident that I made the right decision. There just seems to be this washed out look that I can't seem to get rid of and I still think that the LGs colors look slightly richer. If I can't get this TV to display to my liking, I'll likely end up returning it and just going back to the LG.My last LG and this Toshiba are both entry level LEDs, so I'm not expecting either too blow a 4k TV out of the water. If this Toshiba had been my first LED I'd probably be satisfied with it, but since I have such a direct comparison to one I was completely satisfied with - the Toshiba is leaving me with doubts.", "Date": "May 17, 2014"}, {"Title": "Deep Blacks and Great colors.", "Author": "Mike V.", "ReviewID": "R372HW99R68E5U", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "Granted, this set its not that smart but for the price its awesome. Its great as a 2nd TV for a bed room or even the livingroom. It has great resolution and no blur in fast moving scenes or games. Very bright and deep rich colors. It does have a few faded clouds you can notice when the entire screen is dark but not to bad to affect the picture quality in any way.Update: 05/29/14Now that i had some time with this TV. I was able to play with its settings and calmly check it out. The clouding issue has become to noticeable and distracting to the point where all you see while watching a DVD or program is the blotchy faded clouds all over the screen. Specially in dark scenes. I've visited the store and checked Toshibas other models and sizes and they all had similar issues, some worst than others. I was really trying to like this set but couldn't get rid of the clouding issue.  So, today im exchanging it for a dif brand. Besides for $50 to $100 more you can get a much better set.

Well, I think the image is very good and until now I did not noticed the \"black\" isues reported by other users, but this is my very fisrt LCD/LED/Plasma TV, so everything will look great when you replace your old Standard Definition TV.I watched my first movie and everything was good (audio not so good as in my old TV anyway, but if you have a receiver, it does not matter). Then I configured the Wireless network in order to watch Netflix, and I turned off the TV for a while.  I turned it on again and I started having weird issue with the TV. When I clicked the menu, no menu was displayed, opening Netflix did not work, \"Home\" button did not work .. after many tries, I could show the menu and reset the TV as the User Guide suggested and the problems were gone ... but sometimes Netflix does not load or show connection issue (my wireless network is OK and Netflix works OK with my WD TV Live) ... sometimes seems to be hang and I needed to be unplugged ... I think the software has some \"bugs\" and if I can not find solutions in Toshiba Support (like firware upgrade, for example), may be I will return the TV to Best Buy and get a Vizio E-Series instead.", "Date": "June 9, 2014"}, {"Title": "Makes my PS3 and Netflix look great, but not too Smart.", "Author": "Phatcub", "ReviewID": "R2RIY8ZDRPKIH8", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I bought this tv because of the price and it was smart. For this price you don't get all the bells and whistles of a high end smart tv but you get a really nice picture. If you have kids and plan on using the stand, then once again this tv is not for you. I love the fact that I can do media share, Netflex, and some Youtube. I will let my PS3 take care of the rest and my games look great. This TV should not be considered 120hz TV, I have been hard press to see the difference and there's no clear cut way to active this \"ClearScan\". It's very frustrating.Pros: Price  Picture  Wifi  Connections (3 HDMI's, USB)  Netflix, Youtube, Pandora, and  MediaShare  DTS/Dolby sound decoderCons: Wobbly stand  Very few apps  60Hz (with built in 120Hz ClearScan on Cinema Feature) I personally don't care for that soap opera look.Maybe in the future Toshiba will add some more features, but this tv is their middle set not dumb, but not super smart either. If you want a decent set in a second location, like the kids or wherever without breaking the bank or on a budget like myself. This model will get the job done.

Motion blur average, but on the lower end of average. In put lag is low 30.1 msec. With regards to the smart tv aspect of this tv truthfully the term smart tv is not regulated so you can basically add 2 apps and call it smart, but for the price and contrast black levels this tv is great deal. I would recommend this tv over the l2400u model cause of the extra HDMI port so you can connect a roku to it and there you have a great smart tv with features that beat other smart tvs at a lower price.Now on to other reviews, I don't understand why the lower reviews cause this tv is the SAME basically as there 40 inch L2400U, the only difference this has a smart tv feature and one extra hdmi.If you look a the 2400 reviews almost 5 stars, so don't know why this is so low.I found this review that helped me buy it [...]", "Date": "June 24, 2014"}, {"Title": "price is right but tv needs imropvement", "Author": "Yaza T.

You can see blotchy bleed through anytime there are dark areas in the picture.-The audio is some of the worst I've heard from a TV of this price range.-Pressing mute on the remote first lowers the volume, then you must press again to actually mute it.
