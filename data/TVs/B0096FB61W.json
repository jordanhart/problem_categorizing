{"Reviews": [{"Title": "I Love It", "Author": "Veil_Lord", "ReviewID": "R1G8ZSD8LU6V0J", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "One of our TVs died and since our last LG has been going strong for years we started looking there first.  It doesn't hurt that it's got features like an on/off timer that other brands inexplicably lack.  Most LGs also have a swivel stand which I think I've only seen on a Samsung otherwise.  Neither are deal breakers, but made LG more attractive as a brand.We picked up one of these on a good sale.  Including all taxes, it was a bit cheaper than Amazon has it listed.  We got it in part because of the 3D, but really mostly because it was a good size, good price, and in our experience good brand.  Spent a bit more than we'd planned, because we were going to only get a 32\" 720p TV, but I think the extra was worth it.  We'll likely keep it for many years.First off, the picture looks good.  I'm not a connoisseur of video and mostly we're using up-scaled low-def video, but that looks fine and it's 1080p so high-def should work fine.  I can only say that from 6' back or so the picture is quite enjoyable and 3D mode looks nice.  It will do 3D on most any video, though obviously you'll get a better result if there's something that's meant to be 3D.  The sound was perfectly fine for my liking, though I've read some people find it a little wimpy.  Of course if you're big into sound, you probably already have stereo speakers you can wire into it.A primary concern I had buying a new TV is that it had composite or RCA jacks.  Those are the yellow, white, and red cables that were big back in the CRT TV days.  It also supports component connection, but it's shared so you can only do one or the other.  My PS2 and GameCube both use composite and they play just fine on the screen.  They're not the prettiest, but they're not awful considering they're stretched further than designed.  If you have old VCRs, DVD players, or certain TiVo models I'd suggest getting a TV that still supports them.  You can get a Composite to HDMI Converter if you still want to use them later, but it's always more convenient if it's built in functionality.  Most current LGs seem to have the shared composite/component inputs.One feature we had no idea of, until we found almost by accident was the USB port.  I was going to upgrade the firmware, but used the wrong drive.  It had video on it and so I messed around and it played perfectly!  The video is a .AVI file, probably Xvid or Divx encoded.  It looked brilliant and saves us the pain of having to hook the laptop up to the new TV to watch family videos off of it, though we'd still need to hook the laptop up if we were streaming video off the web; it's not a smart TV.  I'm guessing it'll only play unprotected video off the Internet so probably no full TV shows, but you could download music videos or something maybe.I'll update the review if anything major comes up, but so far quite happy with the purchase.---Update 04/01/2013---I've found the TV will play protected DivX formats.  You need an account with the DivX site, then you download a short movie that \"unlocks\" the ability in the TV, then you're good.  It says you may need to redo the activation again if the TV needs a firmware update.---Update 06-06-2013---I put in a USB drive today and the TV was able to play .mkv files.  Nice.  So far, I'm pretty impressed with the videos it's able to play.", "Date": "March 1, 2013"}, {"Title": "Direct lit 3D TV...", "Author": "Edmonson", "ReviewID": "R12A95JYXTSRNL", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "This direct lit TV outperforms the edge lit TV(LGLM5850) that I tried out. The direct lit LM3400 model gives excellent picture uniformity unlike the edge lit LM5850 which had hot spots in the corners, particularly in 3D. It is thicker than an edge lit because the LEDs are across the back of the TV and need the distance from the screen to light the image, unlike edge lit TVs which have the light source from the edges. I'm impressed with the colour, and even the black levels are quite good if the backlighting is turned down though this will sacrifice detail in the shadows. However if one watches a lot of movies it might be worth buying a higher end TV with the better blacks, but to do so one would likely need to be spending at least  double on a TV so for $500 this is an amazing deal. The fairly glossy screen can be annoying though as it reflects objects in front of the TV. If this TV had a matte finish, or the anti-reflective filters that one finds on the higher end TVs (Samsung 6500/8000, or Panasonic ST and up) then it would have improved the viewing experience.  I did take this TV back to the store just because of its glossy finish which I found too distracting. This being said the TV picture looks great when watching sports or anything with bright images. The TV also has a USB port which plays MP4s and other sources. The 3D is great and there are even a few set A/V modes on the remote control to choose from so as to change the 3D picture from Standard to Cinema (darkest setting) to Game. The LG LM5850 offered a few more settings in 3D but was also limited when in 3D as one is unable to control the TV settings as one can do when watching a DVD or Blu-ray. Again one seems to have to opt for something in the higher end TVs, like the Samsung 6500 or 8000 series, in order to gain access to a full array of TV settings while in 3D mode. Though to be honest even with the very limited choices with this LG tv one could still get an excellent picture in 3D so I wouldn't say that this is a deal breaker at all. And even though it is 60hz I didn't notice any problems with blur when watching sports, like hockey. Its design looks a bit dated but the TV is surprisingly good for the price of about $500, especially if you're looking for a 3D TV. It has a swivel base and comes with four pairs of passive glasses. There are also tons of pictures settings to adjust if one wants to fine tune the picture when not in 3D mode. If you're looking for an inexpensive 3D TV that gives a very good picture then this TV might work for you.One caveat worth mentioning, though I'm not clear what the issue was, was that over about a month period the TV in 3D mode twice made a electrical sound through the speakers which was accompanied by a flash of light on the screen. Also, periodically the 3D image was a bit blurry and out of sync which I usually remedied by restarting the movie. Again, I'm not sure if this was a problem with the TV, or the way the 3D player and TV communicated with each other, or the way passive 3D works, but I have not yet had any problems in this regard with the same 3D player and another 3D TV (Samsung 6500) which I have recently bought which has active 3D technology.For those interested in knowing about the difference between the passive and active 3D technology, both are excellent though the passive technology splits the image and so only gives a 720p image compared to the 1080p resolution of active 3D. This isn't a big issue though if the TV is say 50\" and smaller when viewed from about 8 feet or more. The passive technology is the same as is used in the theaters. Viewed at a much closer distance one can easily see the horizontal lines of the picture with passive 3D, whereas the active 3D picture is clearer and more natural looking. The active 3D glasses do require batteries though and are more expensive than the passive 3D glasses. The active 3D also flickers a bit so the passive 3D actually seems easier on the eyes.", "Date": "April 30, 2013"}, {"Title": "Wonderful Product", "Author": "Yan Gao", "ReviewID": "R2HU5UZMH4FD", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Just got it yesterday. Love it!Picture/Sound is great compare with my other 1080p HDTV (Panasonic and Coby), in particular 3D was fantastic! The only minor thing is that the base (if not mount on wall) looks weak. It provides a screw to fix on the table surface but I'd not want to do that.", "Date": "January 3, 2013"}, {"Title": "LG 42LM3400 LED 3D HDTV", "Author": "KenG", "ReviewID": "R254YG4Z91OANR", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I just purchased this TV from Frys Electronics yesterday for $399.  I receive their weekly ads via e-mail and thought the price was a typo because of all the features this TV has.  I ordered it on-line for in-store pickup.  I brought it home yesterday and hooked it up this morning.  We were immediately blown away by the outstanding picture quality right out of the box.  No adjustments needed.We then played a Blu-Ray version of Avatar - incredible. We didn't buy it because of 3D nor do we have any 3D movies but since the TV comes with 4 pairs of 3D glasses we switched from 2D to 3D while playing Avatar and used the glasses. We could definitely see the 3D effect and the picture was still super sharp.  I can't wait to try a real 3D movie. The only spec I was concerned about was the that it is only 60Hz instead of 120 or 240.  We have seen no noticeable ghosting or shadowing during fast action scenes.BOTTOM LINE: Buy it - you won't be sorry.  Even if I had paid full retail ($699) I would still be very pleased with my purchase.  Just wish I needed another 42 inch HDTV.", "Date": "March 16, 2013"}, {"Title": "Fantastic Quality and Feature Rich", "Author": "C. John Smith", "ReviewID": "R3UL7N5DH5KR3W", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I was debating whether to get this or a cheaper LED with smart capabilities. I went with this one mostly because of the \"3 Million:1 Contrast Ratio\". I know that a lot of manufacturers lie about their contrast ratio and that it is mostly exaggerated, but I thought, 3M:1 would still mean it would have an amazing image, even if it wasn't entirely accurate.The second thing that sold me on this was the ability to use the USB port for music and videos. There were other TV's that have this same capability, there was even a Samsung that has the same tech, but after researching it there were a lot of complaints as to what you can actually watch through the USB port.I hooked up my 1TB HDD formatted to eXFAT and it was not recognized unfortunately. I then hooked up my 500GB HDD formatted to FAT32, and that was recognized. I was able to play .mkvs and MP4 movies and videos without problems. Unfortunately though .M2TS didn't seem to work for me. A great feature is that it will play the next thing in the folder, which is awesome if you have say, a music video folder, they would then play back to back which is great for parties. The music works the same way, it will play the next song in the folder, and it even has some cool visuals while playing music. This USB feature is probably the thing that made me buy this TV, I love not having to hook up my laptop or turn my PS3 on to be able to watch something on my HDD.The sound FOR ME is great, I don't have a sound system and I think the speakers from the TV sound great. They get loud just cranking it up halfway. Now other audiophiles might have something different to say, but my music sounded great to me coming from this unit.The picture is definitely amazing, I love it. By far the best picture on a TV I've seen. But then again this is coming from someone who replaced a 5 year old 32\" LCD TV, with this unit. Movies and games look amazing. I haven't tried the 3D feature on a real 3D movie or game. But I was playing COD and decided to try out the 2D to 3D conversion and it was surprisingly pretty cool. I can't wait to try the 3D out on something actually intended for 3D. I used the 3D feature for about 30 minutes and the glasses didn't bother me at all, also you get 4 glasses included which is great.As I said before I was replacing a 32\" with this 42\" unit. And I was VERY surprised when I picked up the unit only to find that it is MUCH lighter than the 32\" LCD.The screen also swivels while it's on the stand, which is really convenient. It makes getting to the back connections really easy.The buttons on the TV itself and great. They aren't physical buttons, instead they are touch activated.Lastly, the remote and controls are nice and simple and very easy to get used to.PS: A little tip, turn off the energy saving feature if you don't want your screen auto-dimming.***9 Month Update: Everything is still great TV is fantastic, still use all of its features, on occasion I'll watch a 3D movie. And I use the USB port to view videos a few times a week. And I love how you can easily tilt the TV to the side to get to the port, or to change view angles.I only have one gripe about this TV. The ONLY thing I would change would be the addition of another HDMI port. Well Picture-In-Picture would be sweet too, but that's not necessary.Other than that, it's perfect.", "Date": "March 21, 2013"}, {"Title": "Wow!", "Author": "Greg C. \"Greg\"", "ReviewID": "RTBRBG5HZJMB1", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I purchase one a few weeks ago on a special $399 deal.

I've tried the 3D and, while noticeable, it doesn't do much for me, but that's probably just my old eyes.  The difference between digital TV and HDTV is amazing, particularly since this is basically a bedside TV that replaced a 32-inch CRT.  The LED backlight makes a huge difference too.  I have widescreen LCD video monitors on my computer with fluorescent backlights, and you can see light in the blackest portions of the display.  On the LG, the LED baclight shuts down in the areas that are supposed to be black, and they really are black, a major improvement in visual dynamic range.
