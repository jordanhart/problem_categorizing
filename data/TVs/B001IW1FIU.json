{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Do not purchase Element electronics products.", "Author": "Drew Nuernberger", "ReviewID": "ROJIAER20PAAN", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "purchased this television from Target in November of 2013 and it went on the fritz in March 2014. I only get half a screen. I called Element and the only way they would honor the warranty is if I shipped it back to them, then they would send me a replacement. The catch is I had to pay the shipping charges, which for a 40\" TV weighing approximately 30 lbs with packaging cost $70 and the price may even be more depending on where you live. They have no authorized repair dealerships anywhere. I would advise that you purchase your television from a more reputable manufacturer. You may pay a little more, but at least you know that you are getting a good quality product from a manufacturer who will stand behind it instead of behind you (If you know what I mean). Also, always check if there are factory repair dealerships in your area. But let me repeat DO NOT PURCHASE ANY PRODUCTS FROM ELEMENT ELECTRONICS!", "Date": "March 10, 2014"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": null, "Features": null, "Name": null, "ImgURL": null, "ProductID": "B001IW1FIU"}}
