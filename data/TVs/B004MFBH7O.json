Moss. I love the picture. Very sharp and vibrant. I haven't given it a 1080p test but I'm not sure how important it is on a 24\". I love the thinness and the overall look of the set. along with a digital out it has an analog out (red and white) which I guess is hard to come by these days.THE SOUND.I thought something was wrong when I first turned it on. It seems that the new and thinner sets are going lack quality. I guess there isn't room to add quality speakers (so they say). And no headphone jack is a bummer. Seems like a bedroom TV so why not add it. I'm still going to give this TV a shot but if I can't fix the sound, I'll return it also. If you want to read my current audio fix read below.MOUNTING.I also purchased a Cheetah mount and there was another issue there. The corner of the plate that attaches to the TV covered up both HDMI ports. If you decide to mount it, you may want to look at the smaller version or another brand.SOUND FIX.I am still trying to work out this sound situation after a week of internet searching. I have a pair of cheap Altec Lansing PC speakers that I purchased and are powered by the TV's USB and using a Y adapter from the RCA jacks to the 3.5mm. Unfortunate issue is the TV cannot control the volume. I need to adjust it by the speaker's volume. This may be fine for movies, but for regular TV watching may be a pain with channel surfing and loud commercials. If the TV had a headphone jack this would not be an issue.UPDATE: Sent this TV back and picked up the Toshiba 26C100U. After I set it up and turned up the volume, all I could say was \"Finally. I can hear it\". Without jumping through hoops.", "Date": "March 31, 2011"}, {"Title": "Outstanding picture but sound is awful", "Author": "Steve P. Moss", "ReviewID": "R25XEVL7R5IUVB", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "The 24\" screen is perfect for our kitchen and the picture is truly spectacular. However the sound is just terrible. There is no distortion through the volume range, but the sound is incredibly tinny and phone-like. I am being totally serious in saying my bedside clock AM radio sounds better than this TV. That is what I don't get with the sub-29\" TV market. They will mostly be used in locations where there is no room or need for a home theater system, and yet clearly the audio is an afterthought.So ok, I can maybe find space to install a PC speaker system to make the TV listenable, but it only has line-out audio jacks, so the TV remote will not control the volume, and there is no headphone jack.This is such a glaring problem on small TVs, that I am amazed, or more accurately, annoyed it has not been addressed. I will have to return this TV.Have you noticed it is impossible to evaluate the sound of a TV in a store where they have 100 TVs on and all tuned to the same channel?UPDATE:  Returned the Toshiba after one week. I just could not get used to the audio. I got the 26\" LG LED LCD. Sooo much better audio, and with a headphone jack in case I do want to upgrade the sound, but don't think I will need to. It cost an extra $100 over the 24\" Toshiba, but the only add-on powered speaker system I could find with a wireless remote was the ZVOX Mini for $199. Made no sense.", "Date": "March 30, 2011"}, {"Title": "Stunning picture ....deplorable sound options", "Author": "Athena", "ReviewID": "R37U9NZ4PYAZ6E", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "I bought this television for my parents' bedroom.  The picture is incredibly beautiful and they both loved it instantly.  One has significant hearing loss though so I was planning to add a set of computer speakers to improve the volume and quality of the sound.  Unfortunately, that's not possible on this TV because it doesn't have a headphone jack.  I even bought a Y-cable to connect the RCA out jacks on the TV to the speakers; only to discover that the audio out has no volume control.The salesrep at the store from which I bought the TV wanted to sell me a sound bar.  When I asked her if she was seriously expecting customers to pay more than the price of the TV to get decent sound, she suggested that my parents could use wireless headphones all the time.  I also called Toshiba about the lack of volume control and the rep there said the expectation was that customers would be using a surround sound system with its own remote control...for a 24\" TV.I really think that Toshiba missed the boat here.  Buying an LED panel doesn't mean someone will automatically be inclined to spend a lot of money on add-ons.  And as we've seen, even if you are willing to spend something extra, nothing exists because a) without a headphone jack, the TV won't control the volume for external speakers and b) *all* the short (i.e. 20\" or less) speaker bars made are in fact PC speakers.  Toshiba could have made a major splash in the small screen market with this panel if someone had actually thought about about the sound issue.  If the cost of an extra headphone jack was too much, a simple software option to control the audio-out volume would have made a huge difference.UPDATE: I took it back and got an RCA at Sears.  It also has an LED panel and includes a headphone jack.  So now we have a very good picture and have added some inexpensive computer speakers for much improved sound.", "Date": "April 1, 2011"}, {"Title": "Disappointing", "Author": "Mary Ann", "ReviewID": "R2G9REKBBYJRTF", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "I got a great price by buying an \"open box\" but now I see why it was returned.

I don't know why but so many tv's do not come with headphone jacks anymore.  Like some one said for a tv that is a size most people use in the bedroom, headphone jacks would be a good idea.

The salesman insisted that it would sound just fine in our average size, quiet bedroom.  BIG MISTAKE!  Are you old enough to remember transistor radios?  Cause that is the sound quality that this TV's speakers produce.  We were replacing our old 19\" box-type TV that had great sound so the difference was really noticeable.

So when I needed a new TV for my kitchen, I was happy to get another. The 24 inch was the perfect size.Didn't take long to set up, nice looking, sharp picture. My only complaint is that the sound quality was very tinny. Thought maybe it was because of where I placed the TV. Went back to store looking for speakers, salesman (who sold me the TV) laughed. He said alot of people complained about the sound and I needed to buy an amplifier to go along with the speakers.Plus, if I did that, I would need to control the volume thru the amp not the TV remote. If the salesman would have mentioned a sound problem, I might have spent a bit more money for a better TV!!!!Because it's for the kitchen, it's serving it's purpose and not worth the effort to return.I set the audio bass on high and the treble on low,it's a bit better but still not the quality to where it should be.

It's just plain awful.  Cheap computer speakers would be better... though since there's no headphone jack, that's not really an easy option.  We managed to attach a pair of old (but decent) speakers to the TV through one of the audio outputs, but the TV speakers continue to work as well, so you still have to hear the tinniness on top of the halfway-decent sound from the external speakers.The second problem is the picture.  While the TV can detect DVDs and automatically switch to an appropriate fullscreen mode, it does not do the same with television signals.  Setting the picture to anything other than \"4:3\" results in distortion... and \"4:3\" is no good either because it cuts off a lot of vertical space on either side of the picture (which is very noticeable when the actors are not centered in the frame; the widescreen programs become obvious).  We've played with all the picture settings and called tech support twice... but it seems that the only choices are a stretched picture or a cut-off one.  Why the TV can't detect whether a TV signal is widescreen or not (while it can do so with DVDs) is beyond me.The third problem (and it's kind of a major one) is that the TV has no manual.  It comes with what is essentially a \"quick start guide\", but it doesn't have any information about the TV's more advanced features.  And when I went to the website to find the manual, I got a message informing me that there was no manual for that product!  No manual, no helpful advice from tech support...  I realize this is an inexpensive TV, but is it too much to ask to be able to, you know, watch television on it?", "Date": "August 14, 2011"}, {"Title": "Sound just gets worse.", "Author": "Jeff Chandler", "ReviewID": "R2JJXMO6JAF4HK", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "Picture was surprisingly good.

Sound BAD!", "Author": "Dave", "ReviewID": "R2U149YDWX64CB", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "As others have said, the picture quality of this set is very good, but the speaker quality is absolutely horrendous. The only solution is to add some form of external amplification and speakers or perform a warranty voiding modification to the set.Now this being a 24\" set, I don't really envision this set as being the center piece of a home theater setup, but apparently Toshiba does with their pitiful built in speakers. Okay, so the speakers suck, why not just plug in a set of cheap computer speakers? Well, you could but the only audio outputs on this set are two fixed line level rca jacks-not variable. This means the volume of any external speakers cannot be controlled by the tv. Okay, so maybe like me you have an extra amplifier and speakers around that you can hook up. This works, but I found (at least on the one I got) the line level jacks on the tv produce a noticeable background hum. Not as noticeable when listening to programs, but once you know it's there it is kind of hard to not be aware of it.The manufacturer of this set really dropped the ball with the speaker design. While this is just a 24\" set and there is no expectation of spectacular sound, this set is so below par in this area that it is hard to believe that what I previously believed to be a top tier home electronics manufacturer would let this product go out the door. It makes no sense for them as anyone who buys this set will be totally unhappy with the sound quality. I guarantee that this set will have an extremely high return rate because of its extremely poor sound quality. Most people aren't going to go through the expense and hassle of sound add ons and will simply return the set. I understand that manufacturers are in a squeeze to cut costs,but products still need to provide a level of performance that is reasonable.

Olson", "ReviewID": "R1BHIVMYSDZ6OT", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I bought this little ten pound TV for the bedroom to wake up to, using an external timer. Fortunately it remembers the stations and most settings when turned on after having main power cut off by the timer. Power demand is 35 watts. The picture is very nice when viewed with center at eye level, but lying down in bed and viewing the screen from various points below the surface it's standing on, you find the picture gets darker, with blacks behaving very oddly. The natural step to avoid this is to tilt the top of the screen forward, but the mounting base only permits tilting it backward - - no doubt for safety reasons. I found I needed a one inch thick bar of wood under the rear edge of the stand to keep the picture from darkening too badly, watching from my bed, but then if you decide to stand, viewing it from way above, the picture gets very light and bleached out. I added wires to hooks in the wall to keep the tilted screen from falling on me during an earthquake.Sound quality is indeed poor with very limited low frequency response due to the narrow oblong speakers required to fit in the cabinet. But stereo right/left RCA connectors and optical audio are provided for an external amp with larger speakers.A 60 page User's Manual can be downloaded, and it helps a lot with navigating the menu system and getting the most out of this product.", "Date": "May 18, 2011"}, {"Title": "Purchased as laptop and video monitor", "Author": "stvbck", "ReviewID": "R3V73D3EHKW7L4", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I purchased the Toshiba 24SL410U to use as an external monitor for my laptop, a display for DSS/DVD/VCR, and as a future monitor for a planned new computer.My laptop has VGA out (ATI Mobility Radeon Express 200) and my video outputs are either component or composite.At first, the picture was very poor. Ridiculously over saturated color, much too bright. The picture on my old CRT TV was much better. It took hours (I almost gave up) of playing with the TV settings, video card settings, and DVD settings to finally get an acceptable picture. A lot of variables. I'm now satisfied with the image from the computer, and the image from video is equivalent to the CRT TV. Contrast, backlight, and brightness had to be turned way down, and individual hue, saturation, and brightness under \"base color adjustment\" had to be turned down for the computer.The sound is weak, but I did not intend to use the internal speakers anyway.I realize I'm using a HD device with SD inputs, but was surprised to find that a SD picture on a CRT is just as good if not better than a LCD TV.

We've \"adjusted\" the sound as suggested by turning the bass all the way up and it's still pretty bad.  For the money, there are way better choices out there.Toshiba TV's in general also have some interesting quirks.  The \"mute\" button requires 2-presses to go on full mute.  The first press reduces the volume by half, the 2nd press is full mute.  Once the TV is fully muted, the Closed Captioning kicks on.  Neither of these \"features\" can be disabled.  Maybe somebody finds this attractive, but we don't.  We have 3 Toshiba TVs and the CC issue is only a problem for the one TV we have hooked directly to cable (the other 2 go through a box that must filter out the CC).  The double-press for mute is also very annoying, not sure why somebody at Toshiba thought it would be fun to make everybody who presses the mute button, double-tap it.  Since we don't use or want 1/2 mute, we have to press the mute twice to make it work.One more thing...the channel option setup screen (where you select the channels you want to see when surfing and set the other channels to be skipped) is presented where you have to select the channels you want to skip...this is just the opposite of what you would expect and the first time through I selected all the channels I wanted to watch.  Of course surfing through the channels showed exactly the list of channels I didn't want to see and I had to go back through the setup screen and reverse all my selections.I didn't get around to setting the TV up when we first got it, other than to confirm it works and of course, throw away the box....otherwise we'd be taking it back.We bought it for the kitchen, but now I'm thinking we'll replace it and move it to the spare bedroom.", "Date": "September 2, 2011"}, {"Title": "Yes, the sound quality is atrocious.", "Author": "Liam Phoenix", "ReviewID": "R8BQKUP3AOBBV", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Look at all those audio outputs on the back though.I have a PC + Line-in and HDMI carrying audio from gaming consoles and a little $3 adapter plugged in to the red/white audio out for 2+1 speakers via the headphone-style jack.

The resolution for my gaming experience, with HDMI cables, is fantastic.

It sounds canned, or something.  I would gladly buy a TV that's one inch deeper in size if it meant better sound speakers.  But since it seems like every other review here has been written about the sound, I thought I'd pick out one other inconvenience.  Since I didn't have a remote I had to rely on using the physical buttons on the front of the TV to change channels, switch to gaming mode, etc.  The buttons work almost like a touch screen - you don't depress the button but almost sort of swipe your thumbprint.  And that's a problem since the button areas are extremely faintly marked.  Now, 99% of you will probably be using a remote so it's no big deal, but I for one am constantly pressing the power button on this and my main TV.  And if something is used often enough to become an annoyance, it will be.But the benefits far outweigh the drawbacks.  Just might I suggest you try and get it for a discount rather than full retail.

I didn't even think you could get speakers this bad, much less in a TV costing this much. Anyone who says they had no problems with the sound is either functionally deaf and lying, or has never used their ears before. I have $7 earbuds that sound better than this TV.The worst part is, the picture quality on this TV is staggering. Even when watching standard definition programming(BBC on Comcast, anyone?), the picture is amazingly clear and noise-free. Add to that a wide range of inputs and it seemed like the perfect TV for my home office.But the audio! I even tried updating the firmware, but it just updated it to the same version number, and the sound isn't any better at all.

So I brought it back to Best Buy and traded it in for this tv and a rabbit ear antenna (about $15) plus about $40. I don't have cable tv. The tv was put in my bedroom on the second floor and works very well, both picture and sound.The reason why I'm giving it a 4 instead of a 5 rating is that there was a smell to it when first used. I assume that this might be common to most new tvs but I'm not sure. After a few weeks there is only a slight trace of that \"burn in\" smell.Yes, I would recommend this tv to someone who doesn't have a lot of room for a tv, especially in their bedroom..", "Date": "December 24, 2011"}, {"Title": "Toshiba 24SL410U", "Author": "Fletcher Hanks \"Fletch\"", "ReviewID": "R2ZATH70ZZY3SH", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This TV accepts my computer for playing downloaded videos from youtube like \"Zeitgeist - The Federal Reserve\".
