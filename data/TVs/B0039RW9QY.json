{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Absolutely wonderful picture!", "Author": "TK-2243 \"Stormtrooper\"", "ReviewID": "R1LFY2QF06P7PY", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I received my 60pk950 about a week ago and absolutely love it.  This was my first HDTV purchase and I spents months researching different brands and models.  I was originally set on buying a Panasonic, but the refusal to own up to the rising blacks and floating blacks steered me away.  Why give money to a company that won't admit to issues with their products?  I bought an LG BD390 after reading stellar reviews on the blu-ray player and that led me to considering one of their televisions.  I joined the AVS forums and spents months reading threads and posts on most brands and models available.  My concensus is that the LG owners had the least amount of issues.  Samsungs frequently buzz and the Panasonics have black issues.  LG seems to be the underdog, so they are really out to impress their customers.As for the TV, I love the picture and blu-ray discs look fantastic.  I imagine that they look just as solid on the 60PK550, but I wanted the bells and whistles that the 950 offered.  Also, the Trublack filter DOES make a difference.  Here's the deal, glass reflects so you will never have a TV that has no reflection at all, but the filter greatly diminished that issue.  Very happy with that.  I had thought about getting an LED, but since I pretty much only watch films, the \"soap opera\" look to LED/LCD drove me nuts.  If you prefer the cinematic look, plasma is really the only way to go.  I can understand why people like LED, but it wasn't for me.I am not a video expect, but to me, the picture looks great.  I can stream Netflix with no problem using the wifi dongle (included) and the widgets are moderately cool.  They are nothing to get excited about, but I'm sure more will be added over time.  Blu-rays look stunning.  I can't stress that enough.  This TV is 60\" and I can sit 5 feet away and not notice any breakup at all.  Smooth as day.  I also have an Xbox 360 hooked up and haven't noticed any lag issues at all.  Buy this TV.  If you don't need the Trublack filter, Netcast or widgets, the 550 should suit you fine.", "Date": "August 3, 2010"}, {"Title": "LG 60PK950 - Overall an Excellent TV!", "Author": "Tony L", "ReviewID": "R2RKDIBN4K8FTE", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I purchased my LG 60PK950 about a month ago after several months of research comparing plasma with LED/LCD; I am VERY impressed with this TV!  It is LG's 'top of the line' plasma, so it has all the bells and whistles you could expect.  Here are the things I like best:-  High quality picture, with beautiful colors and excellent black levels (thanks to the new tru-black filter)-  Internet widgets work great and are easy to setup-  Excellent value for your dollar.  I got this TV at a great price (substantially under $2000) and it compares easily to TV's close to $1000 higher in price.-  Minimal plasma effects (image retention, ghosting).  I have never seen any ghosting or image retention artifacts.  From what I've read, if they do show up, you can easily remove them by running an IR program overnight to clean up the artifacts.-  Great viewing angle!  Much better than my previous Samsung DLP TV.  The LG is bright and clear even at 160 degrees.-  Power consumption is much lower than last year's model.  I think it uses somewhere around 150 - 200 watts depending on what's being shown.  Still more than LED LCD which can be below 100 watts.  Previous plasma TV's consume up to 500 or more watts.My only 'less than stellar' comments for this TV are:-  I wish it had Pandora radio and another movie source in the widget list.  It has VuDu (which is cool), You Tube, and Netflix; but I was hoping it would also have the CinemaNow that is included with LG's Blu-ray players.  I'm hoping it will be included in a future software update.-  DTS audio is not decodable from video on a thumb drive.  It will play 1080p high quality video from the USB ports, but audio seems more limited.-  This TV just missed the cut for 3D, but my personal thought is that 3D will not be mainstream until the glasses aren't required.  If you must have 3D, LG just released the PX950 line, but it will be pricey for several months.-  More glare than my DLP TV.  Initially I was a bit disappointed at this, but when you combine a plasma picture (not as bright as LED) with a solid glass front, some glare during daylight is unavoidable.  My solution was to turn up the brightness a bit and draw the blinds for daytime viewing.  If you are a constant daytime viewer, you may want to consider another model.  But for me, I mostly watch in the evening and the picture is just stunningly beautiful with rich colors and great contrast and black levels!All in all, I love this TV and highly recommend it.  The most important aspect is the TV's picture quality and the look/style in your room.  This TV gets the highest marks for both.  The rest is icing on the cake in my opinion.  Do your research and if you pick this TV, you won't be disappointed.UPDATE: LG just released a software update that added CinemaNow movie streaming and MLB.com baseball widgets!  Also, there is a new widget that says \"Coming Soon\".  So, I am excited that LG is in fact adding to the software on this TV and not just adding to the new models!  Still would like to see Pandora and Amazon video in a future release.", "Date": "September 11, 2010"}, {"Title": "Now That's a TV!", "Author": "chamber79", "ReviewID": "RGGL3ZLWS69B9", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "We got this tv when we moved out of state for a new job, which happened to be away from our families. I have to say this has to be the best HDTV we have ever owned. We have 3 HDTVs in our home now, but the picture quality and user interface on this LG is far superior to my Toshiba and Samsung. I hooked up our new Moxi DVR and have never looked back. The LG widgets are great for some quick information, and you can personalize them according to the user. In fact, you can have multiple users personalize their own widgets. I also really like the integrated Netflix, Vudu, Twitter and other apps on this LG. We have saved so much money from not going to movies and just waiting for them to be on Netflix or Vudu. Soon we will be hooking up the integrated Skype app & camera to see our families who live in other states. It really surprised me when I opened the box and it contained 2 remote controls, the sleek black Wii remote type one and a regular one. Also that it came with an LG wireless internet usb dongle so I didn't have to hook up my Ethernet to it. I hooked up the Ethernet anyway since we wired our house for that, but the dongle works great too! As far as glare goes, we have had no problems whatsoever. We have lots of big windows and have never had glare issues. Another thing I noticed is that it turns off and on so quick. Some people might think that's a weird comment, but after you get your Samsung jingle every time you power on or off, it get's annoying. It seems as if the Samsung has to wait for the jingle to happen to power on or off. One additional thing, when you are in a an app, if you happen to leave the screen for a while without any movement, the tv automatically shrinks the picture size and uses it as a screensaver moving around your screen. Remember the old Windows logo screensaver that would bounce around the screen and never quite line up exactly in the corner? Well it is like that, but a full screenshot in HD. All in all, this LG is a GREAT tv, with a great picture and great apps. Who could ask for anything more!", "Date": "June 25, 2010"}, {"Title": "Awesome TV!!!!", "Author": "utmikeg", "ReviewID": "R1BTXBE6FNV2R3", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "After recently selling my home that had a custom 96\" LCD projection home theater installed, I needed to buy a new TV. I did a lot of research on the new TVs and the different technologies out there like LCD, LED, Plasma, 3D, etc. I came to the conclusion that the LG 60PK950 was the best TV for my application. It arrived last week and boy am I impressed! This TV has a clean and crisp picture. Frankly, I don't miss the home theater now that I have this set. The colors are awesome out of the box without calibration yet. The Tru-black filter is really nice and definitely helps since I have this tv located in a room full of windows. I've read about other people still seeing reflections but I can barely see them if I concentrate on them. This is a great set for the money and I'm glad I pulled the trigger. I've had a number of people comment how sharp the picture looked. I even have a brother-in-law already wanting to buy one too. Buy it and move on. You won't be disappointed.", "Date": "September 21, 2010"}, {"Title": "Great TV.", "Author": "Purplehanker", "ReviewID": "RTJMAOR1HFVL2", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Like everyone else, I read lots of reviews online before deciding which tv to purchase.  I ended up choosing this one because of the size, features, and price.  I have had the tv for just about two months and I love it.  I thought the size was going to be a bit big for my room, but I quickly got used to it.  Anything smaller now would seem silly.  I never even went into a big box store because their selection is not as good as Amazon and who wants to pay sales tax.There are only two minor problems I have found, but both can be corrected.  First, I initially had component cables running from my cable box to the tv.  Because of this, I had a faint red and green line continuously traveling up the screen.  I switched to a HDMI cable and the problem disappeared.  The other problem is the sound.  The speakers are in the back of the tv, so if there is a room on the other side of the wall in which the tv is positioned, they can hear everything.  A sound bar would easily fix this problem, but I have not purchased one yet.  As for the sound quality itself, it is perfectly adequate.  I watched Iron Man 2 last night and everything sounded great to me.The remote is easy to use, and I loved how the wireless internet device came with the tv.  I have had no problems with this and the quality of Netflix movies is very good.  They load in less than 10 seconds.  One last nice touch to this tv is the input selection.  The input button on the remote opens a full screen menu that has all selections in front of you.  The inputs with cables connected are highlighted so that it is easy to choose what you want without having to hit the input button many times to scroll one by one.So in summary, this is a great 60\" tv.  Just be sure to get HDMI cables for it.", "Date": "November 13, 2010"}, {"Title": "Beautiful Big Screen", "Author": "Awdio Kreep \"tlaloc\"", "ReviewID": "R2TQYFUKCJQGY7", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "A beautifully designed television -- black with one piece of glass covering and overlapping the front of the TV.  Great screen, rich colors.  Good backlit remote. Lots of options for adjusting the picture.  Includes a wirelesss adapter to connect to Netflix, etc (even though I eventually used an ethernet cable from the router).  Happy I got this thru ONE CALL.  The remote is very powerful and works without having to be pointed directly at TV.  A second remote is included.  BluRay movies through the HDMI input are terrific.  I considered Panasonics and Samsungs but I think this LG Infinia premium model matches up with features and picture quality -- and you get a slightly larger 60\" screen instead of the 58\".Cons: So-so sound, but this is common among the thin screen modern TVs.  No Closed Caption button on remote.Other: Runs warm.  Has lots of input jacks.  Red LED in bottom right corner when TV is off.  Blue LED in center bottom lights and then goes out shortly after turning TV on.  I use it for over-the-air TV.  Excellent tuner -- it scanned and picked up over 120 L.A. area channels (most of which I have disabled).  Takes two people to unpack and handle.  It weighs over 100 lbs.  Stand is pre-attached.After owning for two months, I upgraded from 4 to 5 stars.  I recommend it without reservations to anyone who wants a TV of this size for the home.

This set is so thin, it looks like an LED from the side (which is great)!  The picture looks great right out of the box and it was a piece of cake to setup.  The NetFlix and other integrated features are nice and produce a great HD picture while streaming.  Note that low resolution sources (SDTV or DVDs) will look pretty poor when stretched to a 60\" screen, but as long as you stick to 480p or 720p at a minium, it will look great!", "Date": "October 26, 2010"}, {"Title": "Great Picture -- But Required Service Call in First 60 Days", "Author": "Det_Wings", "ReviewID": "R7CWNEWGH3VGY", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I am really impressed with the picture quality, especially after fine tuning the picture with DisplayMate software.  The colors are very vibrant and the blacks very deep.  (You really shouldn't rely on the preset settings for your TV; DisplayMate will help make sure the settings are appropriate for your lighting.)I decided to go with plasma and compared the LG with Panasonic and Samsung.  I ended up going with the LG primarily because it was the only one that properly handles 1080p/24 sources, such as bluray players; some of Panasonic's 3D televisions do, but at nearly twice the price.  The LG was also less expensive (OneCall had the lowest price and were great to do business with.)The main drawbacks with this model are excessive power consumption (compared to LCDs) and the weight; it comes in at a whopping 120 lbs -- definitely needed to call for backup when I set it up because it is much too heavy for one person.The other problem is that the display developed a 2-1/2 inch solid black line from top to bottom on the left edge.  I guess this isn't particularly uncommon for flat screens, but it was still annoying to have to call LG within a month of using the TV.  To LG's credit, they quickly arranged tech support and the TV repaired.  I understand this is fairly complex technology, so I'll judge a company on their customer service.  LG was very easy to deal with.  I still feel a need to knock the overall rating down one star because it's not an inexpensive product.Before you decide on which TV to buy, whether plasma, LCD, or LED, check out sources such as cnet, Amazon customer reviews, and DisplayMate.com.  Do not rely on how the picture looks based on how BestBuy, Walmart, or any other big box store sets them up; they use settings you won't/shouldn't use at home, and you probably don't have 100 fluorescent lights overhead in your living room.", "Date": "December 22, 2010"}, {"Title": "Wonderful Product and Wonderful Service by Seller", "Author": "F.

Sony, for instance, seems to have a better record upgrading their software and supports Amazon Video on a wider set of models (and older ones).", "Date": "March 28, 2012"}, {"Title": "Fantastic TV", "Author": "FSM1010", "ReviewID": "R1PE1FH6IFTEFU", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "First thoughts:-> This TV is huge! Also, it's very ascetically appealing. The bevel on the TV gives it a great frame without looking tacky or heavy. One of the major design sells was the blue edge around on the outer edge of the bevel, however it's hard to notice in anything but a highly lit room (why would you have one with a plasma TV?), but I don't care because I didn't buy it for the blue edge.Pros:-> The picture quality on this TV is truly fantastic, and I keep it on THX Cinematic almost all of the time (which makes my life easy). I compared the quality against my roommate's 47\" Vizio LCD 1080p TV and as expected the color accuracy and black levels don't even compare. With the same Blu Ray movie playing on both (Lord of the Rings: Fellowship of the Ring) there were times in the Mines of Moria that whole facial expressions were lost to the Vizio that were easily seen on this TV, and it was abhorrently obvious my roommate wanted to seal my TV.-> Viewing angels are great, though I don't often have to worry about it with the swivel stand.-> My old analog stereo system works great with the TV using a simple digital to analog converter I ordered with the TV for $40.-> The see-through stand and design of this TV. From the power indicator lights that only turn on temporarily as to not distract your eye from the TV picture, to the seamless transition from screen to bevel without an indent this TV is just gorgeous. The swivel stand works well, and comes in handy more often than I had expected.Cons:-> The reflection on the screen can be pretty bad. I definitely recommend this TV to cinematic enthusiasts that plan on having darker curtains and if they have a light on it'll have to be something with off-lighting.Other Thoughts:-> I have an analog stereo system, and so I use a digital to analog audio converter that takes the Toslink audio cable from the TV and re-outputs it to my red/white cables for the stereo system. On the last TV the sound system was hooked up to (A Vizio LCD) I had the audio output set as digital and that worked fine, but on this TV that doesn't produce any sound. Setting the audio output as analog fixes this issue, odd... but it works and sounds great so I'm not going to worry about it.", "Date": "June 30, 2011"}, {"Title": "Great TV", "Author": "Greg Koons", "ReviewID": "R1SESGDK4CPUNA", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I bought this TV around Holloween and have loved it since day 1.

It looks great and was easy to wall mount using the VideoSecu wall mount (http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000NMFCIA/ref=oss_product) sold by Amazon. I wasn't a huge fan of the pre-set picture options so I used their built-in picture wizard and I'm impressed with the realistic picture that the wizard helped me achieve. For some reason this TV is fluctuating wildly in prices (as of January 18th 2011). Currently it's going for about $2,400 but it's been as low as $1,700. For under $1900 I think this TV is a steal. I researched TVs for about nine months before buying this one. It's LG's top of the line 3D plasma for 2010 and early 2011. For some reason they decided to price this at less than the cost of their top of the line non-3D plasma (at least when it's at the lower end of its varying price range). The TV looks absolutely great in 2D and the sample I've seen of 3D is a nice fringe benefit. If you're looking for a great looking, large TV at a good price this is it. Initially I was looking at LGs simply because of their look. The Infinia's single pane of glass is a much sleeker look than its competitors.

We researched our choice thoroughly. We couldn't decide between an LED or a Plasma. For our purposes a Plasma was the best value. We ordered the non-3D model because we thought we would not utilize the 3D feature. About four days after we placed our order we received an email from the vendor, Electronics Expo. After reading the email we became suspicious and actually reported them to Amazon.com as a spam. The reason we were suspicious is that the order number was different and they were offering an upgrade. We thought this must be a spam email. About a week after that, as we were going through the in-box deleting messages, we decided to investigate further. We looked up Electronics Expo's phone number from Amazon's website and called their customer service - just to see if it was a legitimate email. Well, much to our surprise customer service said that yes, this was a legitimate email! They were out of stock on the model we ordered and they were offering to upgrade our order, at no additional cost, to the 3D model. Of course we said yes! This TV is awesome, period. No regrets!
