{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Nice!", "Author": "Zachary J. Hostetter \"Zach H.\"", "ReviewID": "R15SN5H09DMG3B", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This is an awesome set, great picture in HD, and not bad on standard definition! I kind of took a chance on this as I could not find any information on response time, and I know the response time spec is nothing to really go off of anyways because there is no regulation on the perimeters for this stat. Regardless I had to work to see any motion blur on games, and I'm not even sure if it's more than just an effect when turning quickly. Playing a fps is like the difference between night and day when comparing this set to my early model LCD from Westinghouse. I got my Hitachi UT47V702 through an eBay store with cash back, and it came with the AVC08U unit (don't get this without it if you plan on using it as a TV without a cable box). According to the manual it only supports up to 1360 x 768 RGB input, and it doesn't support PC resolutions through DVI to HDMI (I haven't really tested either yet).  I know some people think it's bad to have the tuner box separate from the TV, but I think it's a fabulous solution to making the TV so thin and well styled.  Besides if you want to mess with your inputs it's way easier to move around the small AV unit (smaller than any VCR), than it is to go digging around behind your big screen. It's also a handy way to limit the amount of cables running to your unit.  The speakers leave a bit to be desired, but what can you really expect from two 6w speakers? The only thing I wish were different was if the AV unit had an analog audio out, because now I have to get a 60$ converter for my old stereo unit, or upgrade to a digital surround set.", "Date": "February 11, 2010"}, {"Title": "Great", "Author": "Randall Harrington", "ReviewID": "R22M63MCUH9OFH", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I bought this tv and it is great I love the 120 hz it removes any motion blur plus it really helps because it allows movies to be viewed with their natural 24 fps.  Hitachi also offers many great features like 1.5 inch thin display.  Highly recommend.", "Date": "March 9, 2009"}, {"Title": "4 years, 3 houses, still works like a charm", "Author": "neverhaveiever", "ReviewID": "R9Y3DRVXC8BSE", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "title pretty much sums everything up. I'm no tv geek nor did I really dig too deep on the specs when I purchased this TV. But the fact that I purchased this as the display/floor model and have no burnt out pixels or anything else happen that best buy employees insisted was going to happen requiring me to purchase their warranty, I'm extremely satisfied with my purchase and felt the need to write my first ever review on amazon to balance the ratings out from the other review that rated this tv as 1 star although they don't even own it.", "Date": "August 26, 2013"}, {"Title": "reliability", "Author": "Patricia Macy", "ReviewID": "RHAQ62SIVGK9Y", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "This television has been nothing but trouble.  The screen has been \"greening-out\" for varying lengths of time ever since we've had it--less than 2 years.  It has been in the shop since early July (3 MONTHS) and they still can't figure out what's wrong.  One part had to be fabricated in Japan--that took 6 weeks.  Another part is now \"on order\".  What a joke!  For $2000 you would expect a better quality product.  We also own a Sony tv which has been superior in every regard to this Hitachi at less than one-third the price.  I will never buy another Hitachi.", "Date": "September 26, 2010"}, {"Title": "DO NOT BUY HITATCHI PRODUCTS!!!!!!", "Author": "N.

Since then it has broken down twice and cost as much to repair as buying a new TV. Both times requiring \"new parts\", the first time $500 dollars and now it is in the shop again for the third time!! Hitachi should give us a f***ing refund for their sh**y products that we thought was such a good deal and ended up being a very expensive TV. It is going in the trash cause that's what their products are Trash!
