At its highest volume, it is still not very loud.  But more importantly, it's poor quality even for the price.  I had mine in for service 4 times in 9 months.  Since I did not buy the extended warranty (it was supposed to work, right?), Best Buy (it's a BB brand) had to send it out for repair each time.  They replaced the mother board twice.  BB was finally good about it and replaced the TV with full credit towards a different TV.  Wish I had bought a different brand to begin with.", "Date": "September 29, 2012"}, {"Title": "Good for the price", "Author": "aliwishes", "ReviewID": "R161UF85C4938J", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I`ve had this for a couple of years now. Good picture. Good sound. Wouldn`t hesitate to buy another and am looking at the 42 and 46 inch models. It took a bit of programming to set up but if your knowledgeable it is easy and fast. Great customer support.", "Date": "January 20, 2014"}, {"Title": "Great TV, Great Price", "Author": "Staci", "ReviewID": "ROUHQ3QO9KNV8", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I have had my Dynex TV for 1 year and I have NO COMPLAINTS!  I have an amazing picture for the price - I truly would not notice certain details, and those High Def TVs are almost annoying because of how clear they are.  I love it because I can hook the TV up w/ the HDMI cable and I get a DVD player with my computer and I can watch episodes from Netflix, iTunes, etc on my TV.Great Buy!", "Date": "August 27, 2013"}, {"Title": "good tv", "Author": "james", "ReviewID": "R3MDKYPTVFSZN0", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Had it for 5 months now.  Its hooked to an old x-box 360. It displays a very nice 720p resolution picture which the x-box feeds it.  Its hooked up to its component inputs.  Hd cable to an hdmi port looks fine.  So far it does everything Iv'e asked it to.

The picture is pretty good considering the price and the audio is actually quite good and loud if you want it to be.

It worked great right out of the box. The sound wasn't that loud, but that wasn't a huge concern of mine. On 4/4/12, it just stopped working. All I got was a blinking power light; no picture, no sound, no nothing. I took it to Best Buy the next day. They told me it would be 7-10 days for it to be finished being repaired, since they had to send it out. On the 10th day, I called to inquire about it. It still wasn't finished, and nobody seemed to know what was going on. I was promised a call back, and never got one. I called every 2 days, and got the same story. Not once did anyone ever call me back.On 4/30/12, I called and unleashed my anger on them. I was told that the part had JUST been ordered, and it should be fixed and on its way back to my local Best Buy the next day. I waited 2 days, and called back again, and was told it still wasn't fixed, that the part hadn't arrived at their repair center yet. I was told by a manager that if the TV wasn't back by 5/5/12, that I would be given an \"exchange\" for a brand new TV of the same make and model. They honored that, and I received another DX-32L221A on 5/5/12.Everything worked great for a couple of months, then I started having intermittent \"outages\". After a great deal of troubleshooting on my end, I discovered that one of the HDMI ports stopped working. It is now 10/8/12 and I will be taking it back for repairs AGAIN! Only this time, I won't be as patient or as nice.", "Date": "October 8, 2012"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "Unavailable", "Features": "Ultraslim design (3-9/10\" deep): Ideal for wall mounting (with optional mounting kit, not included).
