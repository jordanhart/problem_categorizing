{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Got this for my dad, he loves it more then he loves me.", "Author": "chris gargarello", "ReviewID": "R2RMI2W58O5G11", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I bought this TV for my dad. I always wanted to buy him a huge TV and this was the one I picked. He had a 50\" Samsung DLP from 2006 so it was time for him to get a better set with better picture. He loves DLP and this is the only company in the game so thats what I got. I ordered it from dell and it came to him in a week. I paid 1000 with free shipping and a free 2 year warranty. I was not sure of the quality of this, do not listen to the guy that complains about the white dots, this TV has a new chip that has resolved this problem.  I was hoping that this TV would look as good as my Samsung DLP with led light engine. I got the 61\" the last year they made them and it is a fantastic tv and I wish Samsung had stuck with DLP. He got the monster and set it up him self and got it working, point of this, setting up TV's is not the old mans thing so it must be an easy one to set up. It took him a few days to tweek the picture the way he wanted and when he did he sat down and watched Snow white and the Huntsman on Blu-Ray. The picture was so good it blew him and his wife away. he said and i quote \" it was almost to much for his brain to process\". He loves this TV more then me I think.  Bottom line, this is a fantastic buy. If you have no need to hang a TV on a wall this is the best pick for the money. The picture will keep up with any LCD LED or plasma out and will cost about 1/3 of the price. The bulb will need to be changed in a few years and cost about $60. They have made changing the bulb easy as cake. 3 screws and its done, my mom could do it. If you are thinking of this TV or one of the other Mitsu DLPs, go for it! I think you will be happy you gave t a shot!!!! Happy retirement dad, enjoy sitting on your ass watching this beast!!!!", "Date": "October 19, 2012"}, {"Title": "Best TV", "Author": "Roberr", "ReviewID": "R3EUWMEHXV6N8F", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "best picture i have ever seen,easy set up, like going to the movies, i dont think iweel ever go to the movies again", "Date": "December 27, 2012"}, {"Title": "Huge TV!!!!", "Author": "Austin  Brown", "ReviewID": "RQNDZ0ZHJJR9T", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "The other reviews are correct.  i did see a slightly warped image when i first hooked up this tv. I have a computer, Xbox and WII hooked up.  To fix the picture for the wii and xbox, which are hooked up by component using a splitter, i had to press the format button on the remote to set the display to standard.  I still can not get the display perfect from my computer although i am going form display port to HDMI.  The computer display is slightly warped on the right side,  It is not enough to notice during movie playback. but you can tell the edges of dialog boxes are slightly bent.  On another note. make sure you can manually ajust your picture size output from the video card or the display from the computer will not fit the screen.  Adjusting the resolution will not fix this.Other than the warp issue, the display is absolutely stunning.  I can see the picture in daylight and it is really crisp.  Best of all, it is HUGE.Over all i can't complain about this tv, it is huge and it did not cost me $2000.", "Date": "December 30, 2012"}, {"Title": "big", "Author": "Lori Nichols \"william Barnes\"", "ReviewID": "R1L0C6I5XMGGP4", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "this tv is so asome, beautiful picture and sound. with my new Bose suround system this is defenetly home theartre at its finest", "Date": "December 29, 2012"}, {"Title": "a great product at a great price", "Author": "mad_buyer", "ReviewID": "R3GXS72NARCRE4", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I bought the Mitsubishi C12 73 inch DLP for my wife after owning a 65 inch Mitsubishi 732 for years.

Hahn \"apostate apostle\"", "ReviewID": "R2LFI9PC3K0MQK", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I have never really cared for projection TVs but they have come a long way.  They have improved the angle of view issue considerably, but continues to annoy.  If you look strait at it the picture is amazing, lay on the floor or stand up, you notice the difference.Pros:Huge screen, great picture, heck it's a tv what else matters right?  I do not have the issues other reviewers have mentioned, their sets may have been damaged in shipping. I think it is more fragile than normal flat screens.Cons:1. When you are on over the air (antenna) and change channels it pauses for several seconds, I assume while it syncs with the digital signal, however it will not respond and gives you no indication of what is happening.  We use \"hdmi in\" most of the time so it's not a big deal for us. Just thought I would mention it.2. Lack of ports (input and output) this model only has the basics, we added a Yamaha RX-V371BL 5.1-Channel A/V Receiver AVR between the HDMI sources and the TV to be able to add surround sound.  Most people are doing this anyway. (so no Surround sound on OTA) Just double check the ports beforehand.3. The overall construction does seem a bit on the cheap side, button feel, screen moves slightly etc.  But honestly everything is these days.4. Size, the back really sticks out there, I know the design requires more room, but I expected a bit less real-estate. \uf04aI still give it 5 stars with the few minor issues when considering the price.", "Date": "December 28, 2012"}, {"Title": "So far.. not too happy..", "Author": "Matty", "ReviewID": "R15ZXCRW9UVF6W", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "Bought this product for a great price.. 980 bucks including shipping and tax.. the tv looked great when i first got it.. i watched 6 hours of flawless tv for the first two days.. my friends were all in awe that a dlp could have such a great picture.. which it did.. until the third day..

Several days ago. Whle the picture is pretty amazing I note a couple problems which lead me to return the unit.1. Rapid clicking sound when changing channels. I have the TV connected to a HD TiVo via HDMI cable. When I go to change the channel, the tv monitor speakers produce a very rapid clicking noise until the next channel finally comes in. I note this sound is also produced when rewinding, pausing, or replaying anything from the TiVo Box.2. White dots problem. I note a small square area , that leaves a latent image of a square pattern of white dots, the size is about 3\" x 3\" and appears only briefly and sporadically upon the screen.For a brand new , out of the box TV I am not happy with the above.
