{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Value, performance, quality - this LG TV delivers", "Author": "StevenJ", "ReviewID": "R3BE7CRS9ELX32", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Let me start by saying that I am not a videophile, but when it comes to purchasing a television I can be very picky. I went through the whole LCD vs. Plasma dilemma 3 years ago when I bought my Samsung 5084 (one of the best non-Pioneer plasmas at the time). That said, I was ready to supplement that unit this year with a 'smaller' LCD for the bedroom (didn't want to sweat IR, horizontal line bleed, etc). Needless to say, LCD options in the 'budget' range lack features that alleviate some of their drawbacks, forcing you to suffer through motion blur, clouding, and terrible black levels if you choose a set for ~$800).Enter the 42\" plasmas. For the sake of comparison, I decided to investigate the plasma alternative once again. This essentially brought me to the Samsung C450 due to my positive experience with the 5084 and glowing reviews for the C450. Unfortunately, users reported an audible buzzing noise from the Samsung (a noise I know full well from the 5084 and did not want to deal with on a bedroom set).Enter the PJ350. I only became aware of this set after seeing it next to the Samsung at the store. From a design perspective, it tops the Samsung with an ultra thin bezel, very thin chassis, and no 'touch of red'. Furthermore, I heard no buzzing from the LG floor model, while the Samsung sounded like someone was digging honey out of a beehive. Since it is a brand new model I had no reviews to rely on, but I took the plunge.Picture quality from this unit is superb for any sub-$1k TV, much less one at this price point. This 720p set rivals my 1080p plasma in most respects, most notably black levels. I have only had it for a few days now, but setting the TV on 'cinema' mode at 70 contrast and 50 brightness is really impressive (I recommend switching those two numbers for several weeks to break in the unit). If you place your head behind the unit, you can hear the typical plasma 'buzz', but this is completely inaudible at any reasonable viewing distance. While this goes without saying, all the benefits of plasma are apparent with this TV: cinematic quality motion (none of that chincy 120hz movement), 24p bluray playback, consistent backlighting, etc. I have noticed a tiny amount of false contouring, but less than my Samsung - hardly an annoyance. OTA video quality is, of course, superb. The reviewer who stated that colors are not as vivid clearly didn't recognize that picture settings are independently adjustable for each input. This TV does offer a settings wizard to help set the picture based on your unit and environment, but I prefer manual adjustment to suit my personal tastes.If you're worried about not having 1080p, don't be. At this size, you will not detect a difference anywhere outside 4' from the unit. The screen is quite reflective, but if glare is your primary concern then you surely can settle for the inferior picture quality of a cheap LCD. While I have limited experience with my LG, I can honestly say that I am very pleased thus far.", "Date": "April 7, 2010"}, {"Title": "This cannot be a sub $600 TV...", "Author": "John P. Freeman \"All around smart-arse\"", "ReviewID": "RSYQA180G5HXH", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Well, after suffering long enough with my fiance's 30\" Philips tube set, I took the plunge and purchased the 42pj350. Let me preface this entire review by giving a little background here. I have worked for both Ultimate Electronics and American TV for a total of 4 years in the past and spend literally hundreds of hours looking at pictures on TV screens, adjusting them, using AVIA discs, etc... so I have a relatively solid base for judging picture quality here. I've loved Pioneer Elite projection sets and plasmas and sold many projection Mitsubishi sets on the basis of quality of the picture.So...I set the set home and unbox it. Seven screws later, It's on the swiveling stand (yes, swivel stand on a $600 TV) and has taken the place of the bain of my television existence - the 30\" tube. The only source I immediately have to try the set on is the composite Dish Network standard def feed, which really bummed me out. But, color me surprised when the channels, for the most part, look quite good from our 9' seating distance. Honestly, the little LG processes standard definition quite ok. After some quick picture adjustments (which I will talk about later), I start to surf around to find stuff to watch. NFL network has a game on - perfect for checking motion processing of a crappy 480i feed. Flawless. It looked damn good. I put the set in cinema zoom 1 (my fiance has had her old set in the same type of stretch/zoom ratio on her other set for years on standard def) and the picture quality is again more than passable for the signal. The deep blacks (compared to LCD sets I have owned) really allow the other colors on screen to pop nicely, even with contrast and color turned down. So far, standard def is a win.Next night, it's time for some blu-ray lovin'. I drag my HTPC out from the bedroom and plug the HDMI in...presto...we've got an actually very readable desktop in front of us. I didn't even set the resolution to the native of the panel, I left it at the native for my 32\" LCD in the bedroom and it was amazingly clear. The blu ray du jour of the evening is the biggest movie ever - the recently released Avatar. I get a warning about needing to update my player, which sucks because I don't have a network drop in the living room, but I decide to press on and take a chance. Holy hell..the 3 minutes of the movie that played looked fantastic. Compared to the 32\" Olevia we have been watching movies on in the bedroom, this is a different world. Rich colors, sharp detail, noise free playback (no crawling dots like I have experienced on fairly recent Panasonic and Samsung plasmas) that looked amazing at our seating distance. After she is in bed, I break out the Xbox 360. Forza 3, Grid, and Left 4 Dead all look better than they ever have in this house. The kids have a 32\" Vizio 1080p set in their room that we normally play on, but again, the deep black of plasma technology just pops the other colors off the screen. I felt like I needed to wipe the red from one of the Ferraris off of the screen because it just looked that wet. So far, so good with hi-def signals.We spent much of Sunday (today) with cheezy sci-fi moves on SyFy network playing. My first foray into daytime viewing. I can't really complain. Yes, it is a giant piece of glass and does reflect things. News flash...tube tvs that we have been watching for 50 years are glass, too. We have a window to the left of the television and it wasn't a distraction at all. On a black screen, yes, you can see reflections. I can't see them as a distraction to most normal viewers. Our viewing is predominately night-time, but I will not limit daytime viewing because of a little reflection between commercials. It certainly is less distraction than the double reflections of my parents' 50\" Panasonic with it's supposed AR coating. Reflections on that set turn into prismatic star shapes that apparently reflect off of 2 pieces of glass on the front of the set. After dinner, I drag the antenna out of the bedroom and rig it up for the misses to watch Desperate Housewives. Over the air HD looks stunning. It's truly amazing what 720p looks like on a 720p set. Yes, the native broadcast signal on ABC is 720p and it looks very, very good. I see no reason to spend twice the money at this screen size for 1080p and it's a damn shame that retailers are selling the 'you just HAVE to have 1080p' bill of goods to so many consumers when they would be blown away by the little LG that could. I'm a tough customer and have the box in the other room in case this set was going to perform like a $500 42\" tv. It absolutely did not.As far as picture adjustments go, it didn't take long to see what looked good, but I will AVIA this thing this week. I used Cinema as the starting point for out-of-the-box adjustments. Contrast is around 75, Brightness 50, sharpness turned way down at 30. I also set the color temp slightly cool - it looks good there with the Color Gamut set to Wide. Speaking of color..if you set the gamut to wide - turn the color itself down to compensate. I've got the dynamic contrast on low right now and it seems to work well. Normally, I would shut every picture feature off and go from there, but with the black level setting at dark, the low setting is in no way heavy handed in crushing shadow detail from what I can see so far. I turned the edge enhancement off, the dynamic color off (stange enough, this feature actually reduced saturation when turned on???) and the gamma is set at medium right now. True, there are much more detailed settings in the ISF modes, but I've got nothing but time to mess with them and the picture so far is quite good. Colors come off as damn accurate and that plasma black sets them off.Inputs on the set are plentiful with no less than 5 HD inputs (3 HDMI, 2 component), an RGB 15 pin PC input, and composite for legacy devices. The set does lack S-video inputs or analog audio output - 2 things that can be forgiven for an entry level set like this one. Plasma buzz? Nope. Just a slight high-pitch noise that is less noticeable than what the CRT it replaced emitted. Image retention? Have not seen this happen yet. My parents also have a 50\" Samsung (2008 model) and the IR is just unforgivable. 20 seconds in the DirecTV menu shouldn't leave an image up for 3 minutes after. I have been looking for it and didn't even see any after my unsuspecting fiance paused the DVR for something like 20 minutes before I woke up the other morning. The remote control and menus are both well laid out and intuitive. The remote is light years ahead of what Panasonic is sending out with their televisions. I swear they are off the same assembly line as their tube tv remotes from 10 years ago, which sucked big time, too.Honestly, I'm a critical guy with this kind of stuff and expected much less from this panel. I used to run movie theaters in my younger years and have the consumer electronics background to boot. That is a perfect storm of criticism for almost any television that I watch. For a $540 street product (hell, even Sears is pushing this thing for about that price at brick and mortar) I can wholeheartedly recommend it at this screen size. Black levels are quite good, colors bright and accurate, and no screen door effect to speak of outside of 3 feet.For those seeking a bargain in entry level plasma land - look no further.Update 7/20:After having the set for a couple months now, and upgrading my Dish Network to HD, I have a more in-depth experience with it. I am still very, very impressed. Sure, the black levels may not be Pioneer Kuro dark, but still leagues ahead of a standard LCD panel. Color reproduction is now spot-on after a couple weeks.It's difficult to really convey how much better colors look on this set than the LCDs in the house. The only word that I can summon is 'glow.' The plasma panel's colors glow...they've got some luminance off the surface of the screen, whereas the LCD sets come across as less natural in color fidelity. This can be attributed to the fact that plasma panels produce their pictures using phosphor (like CRT sets did) to produce the light. LCDs use flourescent lighting behind the panel to do the same. The colors jump off the screen. Reds, blues, and greens just glow with realism.This tv has really shaken my belief that 1080p is a must. My 9 foot viewing distance provides an excellent experience. Movies, TV shows, sports...they have all passed with flying colors. I would absolutely purchase this set again.For those who care, LG produces a 'Zenith' branded version of this and the 50\" model for Sears. The sets are identical, sans a couple video settings, the usb port, and a less full-featured remote. Generally, they retail for roughly $100 less than their LG counterparts. LG bought the Zenith brand name many years ago and break it out every once in a while to release more basic versions of their sets. I've examined them in a couple Sears stores and the picture performance is just as good as mine, almost 100% identical menus, and even has the swivel base.", "Date": "May 19, 2010"}, {"Title": "Great flat panel TV for the $$", "Author": "Joey in RaChaCha \"Joey\"", "ReviewID": "R2PK0IHTSMOFB3", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Strengths: Many different inputs (including VGA), easy-to-use menus, good remote, thin design, very sleek looks.Weaknesses: No native 1080p HD resolution (but it will display 1080p content as either 1080i or 720p), and no S-Video input.Have owned this unit for 3 weeks and I love it!! Granted it is my first flat panel HD-TV, but LG makes good TVs and the price was very affordable. The picture quality is great, and that's what we are all looking for, right? There are plenty of every type of input (except S-Video), and even SD-TV content looks great from any source or input. Sound quality is very acceptable from built-in speakers, although I have a 5.1 surround receiver setup also. I love the fact that the bezel (frame around the screen) is so thin -- makes the TV look like it's just the screen itself. And the unit is so thin front-to-back, it's almost as thin as the new LED TVs! After viewing many TVs in stores and friend's homes, I prefer Plasma over LCD for the contrast, better blacks and shadow detail. Also, even with contrast and brightness set to moderate levels (i.e. 65% -- you shorten the life of any flat-panel display by running it at 100% all the time), the picture is still very crisp, very bright, and the colors and detail just blow me away.

As I said I have seen many sets in for repair, but very, very few LG LCD of Plasma sets in for repairs. This unit 42PJ350 is very hard to beat. This 720p vs. 1080p business well it it very hard to tell which display looks best. ABC uses 720p and thei images look like things are actually in the room with you not on a display panel. I hear no buzzing, no image retention, no kind of bleeding colors, just agreat image reproduction on a plasma panel for a price just out of this world. In fact a price that not long ago would have cost nearly $2000.00. LG makes very good products and being a tech I feel that I know what is what with electronic for consumers. I wouls not hesitate to buy and thing LG makes. This set has caused many a comment by visitors to our home about the picture, the frame being so thin. A couple of well to do folks bought another brand plasma which they both say the LG just blows theirs away. I whole heartedly recommend this LG PLASMA to any one.

Their are a lot of settings for the picture color and settings and I've owned this TV two weeks and I'm still playing around with different settings.This can kind of be a pro and a con but the touch controls on the screen in the bottom right corner are VERY sensitive. You will have to look at them kind of hard until you can get use to what touch buttons you are looking for.I play a lot of video games and so far the TV has done okay in this area but I also have a 42 inch panasonic plasma and for some reason I can see the difference with how smooth the game plays with my games battlefield bad company 2 and grand theft auto. I also watched I am legend the blu ray on this plasma and another plasma and I saw the difference as well in the smoothness and how much the screen on the panasonic just felt like I was sitting the movie theatre.Overall this a great plasma TV with a great picture after you adjust the settings to your liking. I am a VERY picky person when it comes to TV's but I did not feel like spending $1000 on a TV right now and I am not disappointed with my purchase but even with all the features I enjoy playing my video games and watching my blu-rays on my panasonic more so this TV is getting returned.

I'm from Venezuela, and since, over more than 1 year i was planning and wishing to buy a HDTV. It was almost like one of my dreams, one of those that thanks to god i could accomplish. My search was really minucious and extensive, i have analized every detail of my future HDTV; Details such as: HDTV type... Plasma, LCD? Size...42, 46 o 50? Resolution... 720p, 1080p? Brand... Panasonic, Sony, Lg, Samsung? Contrast, Aesthetic aspect, and so many factors that i will not surely mention here because may be ill forgot.Im i mechanical engineer, and one of my hobbies is watching movies... so, i was really exited about having a HDTV, where i could play trough my pc, several hi-def movies that i have already downloaded, at least until i can buy my media player (Patriot Box Media Player). As i mentioned, one of my labors as engineer, if not the most important, is to choose the best quality at the best price; in order words... the best quality-price relationship! In your english terms, it would be BBB (the best bang for the buck), so i have analized and determined, over 6 months of research that...1) I live into an aparment, where my living room is about 10 feet x 25 feet, but im going to watch my tv from 7 to 12 feet aproximatedly, so, my ideal tv size was 46, because 50 was like toooo big, and 42 slightly small, but acceptable. Then, it was 46 or 42? we'll see later...2) HDTV type... Plasma or LCD? That was quite simple! Which has a better image quality for movies and sports? Which has deeper black levels? Which has a 0.00006 ms answer time? Which has a higher contrast ratio? For me, personally, and having seen several lcd tvs in other stores, the plasma tv beats totally the image quality on a LCD TV, its just amazingly better in every aspect, obviating the natural reflection of a plasma screen (glare). So, considering that actually almost all the Plasma TVs makers, have really improved every aspect of the plasma tvs, such as screen burning, screen life, produced heat, buzzing, glare and power compsumption, Plasma was just the best for me!3) Resolution... 720p vs 1080p... lol... it was hardly difficult to me! Reading and reading, reviews, comments, oppinions, tests, and so... but just 1 mark the difference for me... the price! At this point i thought: 1080p is better, but it really diserves an extra 300$? Why 300$? My budget was buying a hdtv, from 42\" to 46\", 720p or 1080p\" into a range of 500 to 800$. After a lot of research i found two fair options: The LG 42PJ350 (Plasma - 42\" - 720p - LG) and The Sony 46EX400 (LCD - 46\" - 1080p - Sony), both really BBB tvs, in my opinion; compared with many several others in their range. After all, i've decided for the LG 42PJ350, because for me, it was the really really BBB! Just 300$ less than the other option, of course sacrifying just the 1080p, but it doesnt matter to me because...* I'll use to play 720p bdrips on my pc (and futurely in my Patriot Box Media Player); but with high bitrates, 5000-8000 kbps, approximatedly 8 Gbs per movie, wich gives me 2 positive things (Ultra high quality video, even being 720p and not 1080p, and less disk space compsumption, without forgetting that it could easily go into a DVD-9!* On a 42\" Plasma tv, at a more than 6 feet viewing distance, the difference between 720p and 1080p, at least for me, its almost unperceptible; not forgetting that its also a fair size tv for watching my hd movies!* 300$ difference, its almost the half part of the price of its competitor.* Lg, panasonic, sony, samsung? are all good tv brands, every one has good tvs, bad tvs, tvs for refurbishing, but they are all good and known brands, so LG was good for me, considering also the more of 20 positive reviews over my LG 42PJ350.So my decision, was finally the LG 42PJ350... because of * Cheap: just 500$ * Big: 42 inches * Quality: LG * Better technology for my purposes: PLASMA * Aesthetic aspect: extremely beautiful, thin and just amazingly modern * Lot of connetivity: 3 HDMI, RGB, AUDIO ETC... just missing the DVI input * Image Quality: Totally beautiful thanks to its very high contrast and its dual xd proccessors * Just the best outside in Tvs...

This is one cool TV, it's extremely thin and the piano black trim is extremely slick.The remote control is great. The Sound is impressive. It's easy to set up. It's got a great price (I purchased for $550.00 but later saw this TV priced under $500 so wait for it to get low!) The picture is beautiful...except for one small issue... a dead pixel - the first of 3 minor issues that keep me from being happy about my purchase.1. Dead Pixel: The day after I unboxed and set up my TV I put in a movie which began with a solid white screen. Out of nowhere I noticed a tiny black dot on the screen just off the middle of the picture. I clicked through the channels hoping it would go away - but it was always there - an infamous dead pixel. Sadly, LG's warranty only replaced the TV if there are 7 or more dead pixels. Because this pixel is in such a central area, I can't help but notice it almost constantly while watching the TV.2. Burn-In: After a few weeks of use I turned my TV on noticed that there were remnants of and old image on the current one. With minimal use, burn in developed and is very obvious after this short period of time.3. Slight buzzing while Tv is On: Other reviews on Amazon mention this issues - The TV emits a quiet but noticeable sound that disrupts quite scenes of movies. I didn't think it would be an issue - but I do notice it.Overall, this TV looked great, and in many respects is. However, a few issues on LG's part keep this TV from being great.

(Amazon says this one year old model has been available \"since 2003\" ? An obvious misprint.)We use it in our small (12' x 12') living room to mostly watch High Definition cable TV  broadcasts, DVR recordings, and an occasional DVD movie. We watch a considerable amount of sports, and are not Blu-Ray collectors nor video gamers.Plasma HDTV technology seems to be becoming less popular with many consumers compared to LCD/LED, due in part to potential video burn-in, screen reflectivity, and higher energy consumption issues. We're mostly concerned with motion blur, good viewing at an angle, and excellent HD rendition of cable TV. Plasma's strong points are lack of motion blur, higher contrast, and deeper black levels. And unlike LCD, the picture looks great from anywhere in the room; not just directly in front of the screen. Since nearly all HDTV is still broadcast at 720p, the 720 vs 1080 debate was a non issue for us, as the difference in picture quality (even with a 1080p source) is nearly indiscernible at typical viewing distances, and didn't warrant the extra $200 for a similar 1080p unit. (We are watching this set from approximately eight feet away.) Have not yet encountered any burn-in or image retention issues, even after pausing video for ten minutes, or after DVR programming sessions lasting five minutes. The plasma screen is made of glass, so yes, reflections occur on sunny days, but they also occurred with our old CRT TV. Fortunately, window blinds cost less than spending a few hundred dollars more for a similarly sized, non reflective, motion blur prone 120 Hz LCD HDTV. We were initially interested in Samsung and Panasonic plasma units, but after reading of the dreaded Samsung 'Plasma Buzzing Noise' and the Panasonic faulty power supply's 'Seven Blinking Lights of Death' on several reviewer blogs (\"the Google\" can tell you more about these), we focused instead on LG. We've not encountered either of these problems with our new LG, nor have we read many similar complaints about their plasma TV's. This TV meets our needs, and its price was best in class.The LG 42PJ350's 720p Plasma HD picture is framed by a beautifully sleek, thin bezel, and looks amazingly sharp and lifelike. The extremely wide array of colors appear vivid and deeply saturated. Contrast, blacks and whites are all well defined. The fastest action scenes have no blurring whatsoever. Viewing Standard Def broadcasts on this TV is somewhat less impressive (the light gray bars left and right of the picture that LG imposes when viewing 4:3 ratio programs seem bizarre and annoying. I prefer to use the 'zoom' function instead to fill in the screen.), but still an improvement over our previous 32\" Toshiba CRT dinosaur. I strongly recommend using an HDMI cable if you are going to connect to a satellite/cable converter box or Blu-Ray/ DVD player. The upgrade in both video and audio quality compared to coaxial cable is remarkable. You'll be missing the absolute best picture this TV can show you without HDMI.We did encounter one drawback to using an HDMI cable between this set and an HD cable box/ DVR; the HDMI cable also carries digital audio, and alters the TV's and converter box's usual audio functions. This LG TV's closed caption function is then disabled, as well as the Motorola Comcast digital converter box's volume control (Comcast box's 'mute' still works, however.). This means you'll have to use the Comcast remote to change channels, and the LG remote for volume adjustment. Installing the old coax cable instead from the TV to the converter box allowed the volume/closed caption to function normally, but then the picture quality suffered. Why buy a High Def TV to view a subpar picture? Oh well, bye bye closed captioning. Perhaps a universal remote would make this situation more tolerable? Or is this a problem with using HDMI connection for ALL new HDTV's, and not just this brand? I'd appreciate helpful comments from others who have encountered this problem, as the LG website offers little in the way of assistance. An online instant chat with one of their techs yielded an odd, somewhat defensive, less than useful comment of \"That's the way LG TV's are made.\" (Maybe I was really chatting with 'Ask Jeeves', in his new gig ?)Audio from the PJ350's speakers is acceptable for a medium/small room (at 20 watts, they're loud enough, but have minimal bass, and seem to be aimed at the BACK of the set?), and there is an audio setting to enhance voices, but I plan to add a soundbar and a small powered subwoofer to complete our inexpensive home theater. And the LG \"Infinite Sound\" stereo wide feature was also disabled while connected with an HDMI cable.The included remote control is a bit awkward to use. The 'arrow' function buttons often need to be pressed more than once, due to their concave shape and slippery, hard plastic (not rubbery) feel. LG's menu seems logically laid out, and there are many options to adjust both video and audio settings.(Their \"Picture Wizard\" function helps adjust picture settings close to optimal. It gets close to where we like it to look, but your mileage may vary. I used it first, and then set the TV to 'Standard' with the following levels: Energy Saving = minimum for daytime, medium at night, Contrast = 100, Bright = 50, Sharp = 40, Color = 34, Tint = 0, Color Temp = W20, Dynamic Contrast = low, Dynamic Color = low, Noise Reduction = medium, Gamma = medium, Black Level = low, Color Level = wide, Edge Enhancer = on.) The rectangular stand is, like the TV frame, a glossy piano black (fingerprint magnet). It feels sturdy, swivels left/right, and was relatively simple (four included screws) to attach to the TV.I'd rate this TV higher than four stars on the merits of its beautiful picture, attractively slim frame, and excellent value, yet don't feel it deserves five stars because of the closed captioning/audio glitch. If it turns out that HDMI causes similar problems with closed captioning on every brand of HDTV, then I'd gladly rate this LG five stars.", "Date": "January 24, 2011"}, {"Title": "An Awesome Tv", "Author": "OmarS", "ReviewID": "R1DYUEVMUS77CW", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I bought this tv a week ago, it took me months to research, read reviews talk to sales reps, the whole 9 yards. I was seriously considering the Samsung, but after seeing the price for the LG, and comparing the designs between the 2 tvs, I decided to go with this one. Although it's 720p, and not 1080, this will do just fine in the bedroom, although for now, it holding up in the living room.The tv was very easy to setup, first I tried connection with the cable wire, image was horrible, then I tried it with the audio visual wire (red, yellow & white) I'm still in awe! The first few days, it was a little difficult to watch, getting used to the realism of the picture, the detail of the skin tone, the richness of the color, the detail in the  wood on a door, how deep the blacks look, I know this baby will look even more awesome once I get the HDMI cable.Very easy to go through the picture wizard, but when watching regular channels, I have it in Vivid Mode, with just slight adjustment to the brightness, contrast, and sharpness, and when watching movies I switch to Cinema Mode, the picture is totally amazing!!! The screen does have some glare to it, but all I do is turn off the lights and I'm good!I have the tv, the cable, and the DVR plugged into a Surge Suppressor 2160 joules, for that added protection. I know some reviewers report a buzzing noise, but I don't hear anything unless I put my head against the back panel, and it's only a very faint noise. The tv does get hot, but not as hot as some reviewers report.All and all I'm very happy with my purchase, and am definitely going to get the LG 50 or 60 inch for the living room. I WOULD recommend LG to anyone looking for a good plasma on a budget.Update 10-17-10I finally got my hdmi cable, and WOW!!!! My Comcast hd dvr's highest setting is 1080i, and if this is how a 720p set looks, I can't wait to get the 60\" 1080p set. The realism of the everything is unbelievable. The skin texture, and tone, the blacks, and colors are so realistic, the sound from the set's speakers for now is just fine. I want to go and re-watch all my favorite movies all over again. I've seen in some reviews where tend to have some problems, but I have none, in fact I have no problems what so ever, I'm very happy with my purchase, and will definitely keep buying LG. LG has really done a good job on this set, and would again recommend it to anyone. I hope my review has helped you in making a decision.Update 03-04-11I got the Yamaha YHT-493BL 5.1 Channel 500 Watt HTiB system.Setup is easy, mounting the speakers on the wall was very easy I only used 1 screw, the bass is good especially when watching movies. Since its a small woofer you wont get all the bass ranges but it really does a good job. There are so many features and options for you to set to get that perfect sound you're looking for, its owesome.What really blew me away was when I ran my Comcast HD Dvr through it with hdmi cables, it seems to have improved the definition of the picture, the deepth blacks, the colors, the skin tones, the contrast, the vividness and realism of the picture seem to just jump off the screen. The picture quality before had me in awe, but now I'm totally blown away.What can I say, if you're looking for a HT system for your apartment or a small tv room, to compliment this tv, look no further Yamaha has done a great job on this one.", "Date": "September 19, 2010"}, {"Title": "Pretty Sweet,  but annoying noise", "Author": "B.

Sitting 8' away, if I hit mute, it sounds almost like a cross between a loud mosquito and fly. This noise changes subtly depending on what the picture is - very bright or dark, different menu options, etc...It seemed to happen after I hooked up the blu-ray player (thought it was was the player). But if I disconnect it, the sound is still there.I called LG customer service, which was great - someone picked up right away and was helpful and courteous. Basically told me if it gets unbearable they'd send a rep out. But the guy told me it was basically normal, and that once the TV is \"broken in\" the noise would go away. Frankly I don't believe this, but if any of you can comment I would appreciate it. I haven't read any other comments from owners of this TV about any annoying noise at all.It could be that my ears are just very sensitive, and I'm actually looking for the noise now and anxious about it, but honestly it's just on the edge of what I can tolerate. I don't care how cheap or expensive the TV is, if I can't sit there and enjoy a movie without getting a headache, then I'll have to return this one (unless there is a fix or it goes away).I find after I shut the TV down, I still have the buzzing noise in my head for a little while after.If it weren't for this little noise, I would give the TV 5 stars.", "Date": "June 18, 2010"}, {"Title": "LG 42JP350", "Author": "S.

This is a great tv! It's our first flat screen hdtv. The difference between this and my old SONY Trinitron CRT is like night and day. The contrast is amazing, the colors are vibrant, off-angle viewing is flawless, and there are more than enough adjustments that you can make. The sound is good all by itself in a medium-sized room. And the screen is huge! I can't believe how wonderful it is to watch anything on this tv!Some technical junk: the digital tuner is excellent--it pulls in lots of channels, way more than the old converter box the gummint bought us. HD channels look fantastic. 720p is plenty good--I don't think you need 1080p, unless you have source material that can take advantage of it--and even then you probably won't be able to tell the difference. Most of what we watch is broadcast tv and old-fashioned dvd's, so we don't have much need of more pixels. If that sounds like you, then get a 720p plasma and save yourself $500+. Oh, yeah, and the remote control is very easy to use--big buttons where it matters and very intuitive.The setup is easy--it shouldn't take anyone more than 15 minutes.

Way to go, Amazon! and CEVA shipping too!June 6, 2010: A month later and the TV is still impressing me. I have since paired it with an LG blu-ray player with wireless internet streaming. The wireless player cost a bit more, but it's worth it. Otherwise you have to run an ethernet cable from your router to the player--and that could get ugly. The image quality on movies downloaded from Netflix is flawless. It helps that just the week before, my internet provider upgraded my dsl connection to 12mbps at no extra charge to me--though I gather that 7mbps is sufficient.One thing I wish was handled better on this tv: there is no \"sleep\" button on the remote.

I also needed the new TV to fit in our existing television cabinet.  This 42\" model from LG is actually smaller than any 40\" LCD I could find so I bought it.I had this TV for almost 3 weeks and was just about to give it a solid 4 star review when I noticed a red pixel that sort of sparkled.  Google \"LG plasma red\" and you will see what I found out, namely that LG plasma's have had a long history of random sparkling red pixels, due ostensibly to a poor design.  There appears to be some sort of \"fix\" where a tech (or you) can turn down the voltage on the circuit board but others claim this screws with the contrast.  Because of this problem, I can not recommend this TV unless, like me, you need it because it's the smallest 42\" or 40\" plasma/lcd out there.  In the past 2 weeks I've also seen the reviews on this unit quadruple so it will be interesting to see if any others have had this problem.Luckily I caught it within 30 days, and to their credit, Amazon sent me a free replacement (my 3rd since my 1st TV came badly damaged) but I am more than a little nervous and crossing my fingers since this problem can evidently develop out of the blue.Anyway to the rest:Picture: The picture is great.  Makes the LCD's I saw look computerish if you know what I mean...in short the picture blows away the LCD's I checked out. Sound is fine too, no issues here.Manual: The manual is poor, lots of functions and parameters with no descriptions of what they even are.  That said, a bit of tweaking gets you a great picture pretty quick. Contrast at 75-80 and Brightness ~55 is darn near perfect.Glare: Glare is an issue...at least during the day.  I came from an old tube TV so was somewhat used to it...even so, there is a glare problem during the day.  I don't really watch much tv during the day and can always close my blinds so I don't let it bother me a whole lot but I'd be lying if I said it hasn't been annoying. I will say that I don't have any problem with the glare at night, even with several lamps on in the room.  My room has a wall of windows which definitely exacerbates the issue during the day.Panels: I am the kind of person who is very picky about watching shows in their original format (aspect ratio).  If it's a 4:3 show (not widescreen), I'd rather watch it with panels on the side than stretch it.  Because of this, I was initially horrified to see that the panels on the TV are light gray instead of black.  I called LG and they told me this is to protect the TV from burn in. Unfortunately it also made watching anything with a panel horrible.  The light gray panels completely detract from the viewing experience.  They are so bright as to be almost ridiculous.  I was actually going to return the TV because of this issue but luckily the tivo box I bought at the same time also controls the ratio and thankfully uses black panels....whew.Burn in: For almost 3 weeks I watched more than 50% of programming with some type of black letterbox panel and never had any problems with burn in...I don't consider it to be an issue.  You just have to use your head.  After a few hours of letterbox watching just put an HD channel (they are fullscreen) on for a few minutes to be safe.So to summarize:Pros-Really nice pictureNice physical design & small size (it's smaller than any 40\" LCD out there)PriceCons-Red pixel problemPoor manualGray panels for letterboxing (no black option)ReflectiveMy initial review would have been 4 stars, 1/2 star off for the glare & 1/2 star off for the gray letterbox panels.

I mean, would you buy a Ferrari to use as your daily driver?  I am a casual TV watcher.  Yes, I love HD quality, who doesn't.  One thing you never see in reviews is that if you use this to watch regular ol' cable or dish provided TV you are not going to be receiving 1080p quality on those channels.  You will be receiving 720p most of the time.  When you will take advantage of 1080p is when you use your Blu-Ray DVD or PS3, etc to watch Blu-Ray discs.  Thats probably it.  Then ask yourself, how often do actually watch Blu-Ray discs.  If you say hardly ever to never like me, don't waste your money on 1080p or the mystique that goes around it.  I like watching my HBO HD and some other stuff but still like 50% of TV or more is 480i, regular broadcast.So, I priced this LG 42\" plasma out.  I found it sub $500 locally, new.  What I needed in a TV:1.  1 HDMI input2.  Some type of audio out.3.  720p4.  Skinny and nice and black and not too heavy (for if I wanted to wall mount it)5.  Reputable brandI definitely found all of that with this LG.  I will be using:1.  a Yamaha receiver with 4 HDMI ins and lots of output combination.2.  Cable box with HDMI out3.  DVD player with HDMI4.  AppleTV with HDMI outBecause I am using a receiver, I will have great sound quality, and the ability to easily switch between components.  I don't care about the amount of inputs the TV will have as it basically will work as a monitor, like on a computer.  For what this TV is, a monitor, it works perfectly.  The picture quality is very nice and the refresh rate looks good enough.  Again, remember what I am doing with the TV.  Make sure you calibrate it.  I suggest not using the built in speakers and buying some Home Theater system or receiver and speakers.  I have mine sitting on very nice corner TV stand.  I have mine in a corner where I will have sun glare around 3-5pm and make watching the TV a little hard.  So if you plan on using this is a really bright room, prepare yourself to buy some window trim or not buy this TV.  If the glare from the sun because too much for my viewing pleasure, I simply close the drapes.So in summary, great TV especially for the price.  Don't be silly and spend a butt load on a friggin TV.  I mean, c'mon people.Update: 3/19/13TV is still moving along very nicely.  No dead pixels, etc.  Picture still clear.

For the $500 I paid there is no way to guarantee a good picture quality unless you go plasma.  LCD's in this size and price range just can't match up.  I saw this deal running on Amazon the week of Black Friday, read overall positive reviews, and took the plunge (after shopping around extensively and reading a great deal about other sets of course).I will update this review later as I get more time with the set, but here are my initial impressions.Packing: Easy to take off the wrapping and get out of the box.  Not much extraneous packing material.  They do not give you a full printed manual, instead packaging a CD with the manual and giving an included manual that covers the basics needed to get things running.Build: Easy to mount on the stand, swivels without difficulty.  It doesn't have brackets to attach it to my entertainment center, something to keep in mind if you have young children around you worry may push/pull on it.  The TV itself is very thin and relatively elegant and overall very light; the design doesn't stand out in an of itself, but I don't view that as a negative.  With TV on and lights off you don't notice the bezel at all (the inside of the bezel on my Pioneer actually makes a slight reflection because the screen is inset a little bit).  It is a fingerprint magnet, something to keep in mind if you are going to use put your hands on it to swivel it often.  I will say that having the stand swivel is WONDERFUL.  Being able to turn it even just that 20 degrees to easily attach/remove cables, etc makes everything much easier.Picture: The only HD content I've had a chance to use so far is Fallout 3 on my Xbox 360, but I can say it compared favorably to my Pioneer.  My wife saw the picture and thought it was as good as the Pioneer (though she was only looking at the Xbox Dashboard, not the game).  I currently only have an SD setup from Dish to run to this TV but the results were surprisingly much better than I expected.  I have been spoiled by watching  exclusively HD TV broadcasts on my Pioneer for over a year now so I expected that watching SD content on a lower level TV would be painful, but it was adequate; ultimately of course you really want HD for everything or there wasn't much reason to get a nice TV.  I have a lot of control over the lighting where this TV is located so I am not as concerned about reflections/glare as others, but I did test it with every light in the room turned on (so fairly bright) and didn't have any issues viewing the picture.  If you're going to have a light (or window with light coming through) shining directly on the TV it may be a problem, but otherwise it is fine and w/o much glare.Audio: Nothing exciting here.  The speakers have plenty of volume.  Everyone who writes reviews always seems to think everyone should have a fancy stereo system for their HDTV, but that's not always feasible/practical.  I don't have a stereo system for either of these TV's and rely on the speakers built in to the TV.  The LG speakers are not as good as the huge speaker bar that came with my Pioneer, but at the very least the mid-range sounds are clear and audible, though it doesn't make much in the way of bass.  The speaker bar on my Pioneer is nice enough that I don't feel a need for extra speakers, but I do think the LG would benefit from some true stereo speakers from a powered receiver and if I can do so in the future I will.Remote: It's a bit long to easily do everything one handed but the ergonomics seem otherwise fine.Update 3/10/11:I've had this TV for a few months and have some new thoughts.  With more use I do agree that this TV needs additional speakers; not because of a need for higher fidelity, but because when the room is noisy (i.e. my toddler running around making noise), the built in speakers just don't get loud enough to hear over him.  I don't have this issue using the built-in speakers with my Pioneer.  The picture quality is still wonderful; I've had a chance to use a little bit of HD content on there and I have no complaints.  Depending on what you are doing I can see how the light reflection issue could be bothersome.  I have mostly used this with lights on in the basement and the small amount of reflection doesn't bother me, but if you are overly sensitive to that then it could annoy you with this TV.Overall I still consider this TV a great value and I am quite happy I didn't purchase an LCD, as I know there is no way I would have gotten a TV of this quality at this price.

In my opinion there is no comparison, I'll take a plasma any day.Bright light: I know people say that LCD is better in rooms where there is bright light.  I disagree.  I bought this TV to replace a very high quality 32\" Sharp 1080P LCD that happens to be in a room that has a 8'X 12' picture window on the opposite wall of the TV.  During the day you couldn't even see the LCD if the curtains were open.  With the Plasma you can see some reflection if you are looking for it but the picture is so much brighter and you can enjoy the tv with the curtains open during the day.Picture Quality: The picture quality on this 720P plasma blows away the Sharp 1080P LCD.

I am not a big fan of glossy finishes around the frame, but since it's so thin, I have no problems with it. All the controls on the lower right of the TV are touch sensitive and they are responsive. I just thought that I'd like to be able to select my input devices with individual buttons on the remote control, but you need to hit 'INPUT' and then select the input device by using the directional pad and hit 'ENTER', which to me is a bit cumbersome.Other than that, the picture quality is great, sound quality is adequate for such a TV, and the price is simply unbeatable!

It's a perfect balance, for my needs, between affordability and quality.  And for $500 you cannot ask for much more.  Picture quality is extremely crisp and clear, and I just love the glossy look that the front glass panel gives off.  I have no issues with reflections and there is a large window in the room and ceiling fan lights.  Sound is great for built-in speakers and I have no issues with it. No buzzing or noise from this unit is audible at all, from any distance.I attached a $9 RCA Indoor Antenna to this baby and now I receive free super-clear HDTV 'Over The Air', clearer than any cable company has ever delivered since there is no compression to deal with.  I am now going to cancel my cable subscription.  Review readers should note that I bought this TV with the sole intention to receive OTA signals which is why I opted for a 720p set instead of a 1080p set.  OTA broadcasts in SD/720p/1080i, NOT in 1080p and not for any foreseeable future, so there is no need for a 1080p set.  However, if you plan to watch a ton of BluRay or play video games formatted for 1080p, neither of which I plan to do on this set, then you might want to opt for a 1080p set because then you would have a use for 1080p.The PC connect works great and if I have a movie on my computer I just switch the inputs and now I can watch a movie on that instead of my computer monitor.The construction of this TV is very solid.  Solid stand with a swivel base that has a nice sized footprint.  It took me all of 5 minutes to put together.  The solid black frame is sleek and sexy.So to sum up this review, I am mighty happy with this product.  I knew what I was going to use this TV for before buying and I knew what this TV could deliver for those needs.

If you are looking for an awesome set with amazing image quality, you're in good hands with this LG. I offer for your consideration two points I don't care for.1) The speakers point down, so they are rather weak if mounted on a wall with nothing to bounce the sound waves. However, if you're using a surround-sound system, this is a mute point.2) The on-set controls for power/input/volume/channel are nearly invisible as they are touch-controls and you can not see them. So...if you don't have your remote you have to turn on a light to find the black-on-black button labels. They are flush/part of the plastic casing so there is no tactile way to know where the buttons are. I don't understand this.

I found I have to crank up te brightness and contrast setting and turn down the color temperature, to produce the picture I like.Even the Direct TV guy said the picture is nice and even slightly better than his 2 year old 1080P set he has and that there is very little difference between 720P and 1080P.So for the price, I'm happy. I would like a bigger TV as I watch from 10 feet away, but that's not the fault of the TV. Going to a 50 inch costs 50% more right there and going to a 50 inch 1080P twice as much. So I'm OK with this 42 inch 720P for the price.The TV is very reflective when it is off, like a mirror almost. But when it's on, it almost all goes away, no complaints on that front.Overall, can't go wrong with this set, with a nice crisp bright colorful picture. Can't imagine it getting better except for going to 1080P for watching Blu Ray movies. Sports broadcasts are all transmitted at a max of 720P anyway, so having a 1080P set improved nothing.If 42 inches is enough and you don't want to spend a fortune to get 1080P resolution - which is only marginally better to the human eye, this is a great TV for the money. And like my Direct TV installer said, there is more to a good picture than just the resolution of 1080P or 720P.The future is 3D is this set can not show those movies. But the future is still very uncertain on which #d technology will prevail I think.

Budget was under $1000. Looked at Plasma and LCD's.  1080P and 720P.  Walked into a F_y's and checked out their TV section.  Its very dark so Plasma's are equally matched up with LCD's. The LG stood out compared to the equivalent Samsung.  Could of been settings.  I turned down the contrast of the LG and it was still good.  It came down to a ISF panel Panasonic LCD and the LG Plasma.  I showed the kids (the biggest watchers of TV in our house by far)some TV's at Cos_co.  I pointed out the differences between Plasma's and LCD's they had on display.  Even with the screen reflections they liked that the plasma picture was great from any angle and just gets better as the watching environment gets darker.  With four young kids, there is never a time when they are sitting in front of the TV.  Went with the LG. Basically wanted a larger CRT TV that was HDTV so we went plasma. Wanted to buy from a Brick and Mortar but realized with the money saved(Calif recycle fee, Calif sales tax) I could buy from Amazon and also buy a TV wall mount, tripod for my pico projector, and longer warranty for the same price.  Went with Amazon.  Was shipped UPS ground. I went home for lunch and as luck would have it UPS had just arrived at my house. I trust their experience but the box was doing cartwheels coming off the truck. Scary!  Box was a little beat up as we got it into the house.  Big letters on the tape all over the box to reject it if the outer tape is broken. Well several were but some wern't. Crossed my fingers and signed off.  I know its silly but I really didn't have the time to fully unwrap it on my lunch.  Came back home and unwrapped it and all was well.  Break-in or not?  What to do? I decided to break-in the LG using solid color images running on the SD card (look on-line and download the Plasma break-in file).  Ran it at night while I was sleeping, roughly 6 hours a night for a week.  Waited another two weeks before I let the kids play Wii on it.  Sized the tv shows so no black bars would during the show (typically the bars would only show during commercials).  After all of the above.  Zero burn in issues and I'm not paranoid about what the kids are watching or playing on the TV.  Did the break-in help? Anybody's guess but as the saying goes \"an ounce of prevention\".  Does the picture compare to the $2K Samsung LED LCD HDTV's? Not in my opinion but I knew that going in at this price level.  Great family TV. Bottom line, I wanted a HDTV.  I didn't need the biggest, because for me big screen can only mean projectors (see my AAXA review)and 80\" or more. The tv does run hotter then LCD's but nothing that warmed up the house noticebly.

I bought it from PC Richards.  It replaced a 26 year old mitsubishi that was the most dependable tv ever.  Unfortunately mitsubishi tvs are out of my price range.  I was originally looking for a 26 to 32 inch tv.  The problem I found is that the smaller tvs are more expensive than this model.Before I bought I did a lot research.  What I found out is that plasma is a better picture and has fewer issues than LED and LCD tvs. But when a plasma has problems (which they do) they are very expensive that is why you buy the extended warranty.  The reason why I went to PC Richards is that they had the best price in the area.  they also matched the price of another local store (in NJ called electronic expo).  While they could not meet the price they took the difference of the price of the tv.  The only problem with PC Richards is do not go on a weekend or on a really hot night in the summer.You need 2 people to put the tv together and set it up.  It is not heavy it just large and delicate.  The tv has great reception.  I cancelled my cable and am now using Rabbit years.  I  am approximately 45 minutes north of NYC and I get 45 channels. there is no reason to pay for tv anymore.The picture it is crip and clean.  It is so clear that you can see the actors/ actresses caked on make up.  you really do not need the 1080 pixels.  the 720 is fine.The volume is fine I have it set at 36 out 100.  the Tv is in a large room and is just awesome.No defects.  There is  a disk for you to insert in your computer when it is connected to the computer for more features.You can connect the tv to the internet and you can watch tv on the internet.  Again, no reason to pay for cable.The picture shows the different colors brilliantly.Watching Avatar on the DVD player was an experience.As much as I will miss my reliable old tv, this one is a thing of beauty.  Just buy the extended warranty (for less than $100 dollars for 5 years-it is a no brainer).If you go to PC richards in Yonkers Daniel is really nice and honest. I first went to the PC richards in Norwalk and they were sleazy.While I know it is not going to last 26 years if it makes it 10 I will be happy.", "Date": "June 30, 2010"}, {"Title": "Great Value", "Author": "Julia", "ReviewID": "R3QF5P8J8A4H9A", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Have had it for 3 years, no problems, great picture.

Do agree with many reviews about the glare however we have this in our bedroom which is never really bright so does not have much effect on us. This unit sold me on LG so I have bought another LG since (LCD 37\") for my son's room. The only knock I have on the 42PJ350 is that when powered off the stand by light remains lit and it cannot be set to go off.

Our older TV was a 27\" tube TV that didn't cut it, and was way past its prime.

Being as how this is 16:9, and SDTV is 4:3, the image is stretched a little, but doesn't make it look bad. After bypassed my cable box and watched local HD channels, they looked great! Big difference, you could read the tattoos on the football players. So now, I play on getting HD programming.The only negative I have seen so far, is when watching non HD filmed program (Family Guy from years ago) that is broadcast on an HD channel.

All the over the air stations are broadcast at 720 anyways.  Buy this TV!  I actually got a free Tivo with the set, which I sold to a friend in need of a tivo.

It was very exciting, it was our first introduction to LCD television and it was a huge viewing area compared to the 68 cm television we had previosly.  Not to mention that it took up next to no space, it was very thin.  For the first couple of days everything was fine.  Viewing on the Digital TV was superb, even the sound was great, that was until we rented a movie.  The movie was \"Master and Commander\" and during the darker sequences there was an \"incredible\" amount of motion blur, at first I thought there was a problem with the DVD, but, as we rented other DVDs and from own collection it became apparent that it was the TV.  Shots during night-time sequences are almost unwatchable, at first I thought I could live with it.  But now ... I am totally disillusioned with it to the point where I want to get rid of it.  Night time shots from movies on a Pay TV service are even worse - I didn't think it was possible until I saw a James Bond movie - eek!  And I download a lot of TV series from the Net as most of my favourite TV shows get cancelled here after only a few episodes, and in the night/dark sequences, guess what, an absolute horrendous amount of motion blur.

Picture is good, has thin frame, easy to install, lots of features.  Compared to Samsung plasma screens, seems almost the same quality picture, and has a lot more flexibility of inputs, self-adjustment capability, 24p capabilities, etc, etc.  Noticed a little burn-in after it sat on YouTube for hours, but it didn't stay (they have some sort of removal system, but they don't devote a lot of information to it).  It is in a bedroom, so reflectivity has not been an issue.  The few HD materials we've seen have been fantastic, as have the many upconverted SD materials.  Haven't taken the time to try off-the-air reception, since we are more than 30 miles from most of the local transmitters.  I did notice the TV buzzing a little one morning, but not consistently, as seemed to be reported by 10% of Samsung owners.Now for the whining about Amazon.  The unit shipped to our local CEVA depot within a week.  Unfortunately, it sat there for more than another week with no contact from them.  Once we called 3 days in a row to complain, we finally aranged a delivery date.  I looked at CEVA Trak, and it seems like this may only be a problem for addresses delivered from DFW.When the CEVA guys delivered the TV, they asked if I wanted it unpacked.  Thank God I asked them to do it!  The screen was shattered on the right side (about 20% of the display) though there was no evidence of mishandling on the box.  I refused it and they took it back (though i got a handful of calls from Amazon and CEVA asking when I wanted to return it).Unfortunately, the TV I bought was not in stock anymore and Amazon was not willing to contact LG to get it.  So they refunded my money (did have to wait several days) and I bought it at a local retailer (but had to pay tax).
