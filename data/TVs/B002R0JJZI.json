Overall, I would say this is a quality product. The setup sequence worked well and in no time we were watching HD and non-HD material. This unit even made the non-HD material look better. Unfortunately, after a few days, the unit could not sense the input signal (RF) and displayed \"no input signal\". It would also not power off. Pull the AC (mains) plug, pop it back in, and it worked well. After a while, you had to pull and unplug twice before it would come back. Now it won't come back on at all. I brought it back to my home to try on my different cable system and it still wouldn't work.Dealer said I could get a replacement, so I guess the EZ exchange policy is really what matters. I've had two Viewsonic computer monitors and the prior model of 32\" LCD TV that have given me no problems.", "Date": "January 9, 2011"}, {"Title": "32\" ViewSonic", "Author": "Jeffrey", "ReviewID": "R3JNZM8TJ4JJEK", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I bought this television for my Mother, for Mother's Day.  I have a ViewSonic computer monitor, but have never seen one of their t.v.s ...  I am really impressed and expect the t.v.s to be in 3-D soon.  It is very thin and light weight.  Very simple to connect to cable and/or satellite connections. The colors are brillant and the clarity is excellant. I have a 42\" 1080i JVC television and it pales in comparision to the ViewSonic 1080p.  Rather continuing to praise this t.v., I will simply say the only cons are the lack of cables and the remote.  I expected a t.v. of this kind would have a variety of cables either HDMI or the Y-Pr-Pb cables.  You get a power cord and thats it. Of course, it comes with a base, but the t.v. can also be mounted to a wall. Again though, you will have to purchase the wall bracket mounting hardware. The remote is also a little odd, when holding it correctly it feels and looks like it is upside-down. The only thing that surprized me is that it arrived on a semi-tractor trailer rig. Overall, I would purchase one of these again, especially for a bedroom or for playing a PS3 or Xbox 360. It made my Mother very happy, so I could not have asked for anything better.", "Date": "May 24, 2010"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": null, "Features": null, "Name": null, "ImgURL": null, "ProductID": "B002R0JJZI"}}
