{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Very Happy with my Sharp LC60", "Author": "W.C.", "ReviewID": "R296QTDRKX2UJ", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I almost let some of the bad reviews of this TV prevent me from buying it, I'm glad I took a chance! I had some key requirements for selecting a TV for my family room. We have a ton of natural light in this room so a matte finish screen was a must have feature. The Sharps have the best matte finish on the market in my opinion, their nearest competition had significantly more glare in well lit showrooms when I compared them side by side. Another requirement was good reproduction of fast motion. We watch a ton of football, hockey and racing so screen blur would be a deal breaker. I had read all of the comments in other reviews about screen blur being an issue with this set so it was a key concern. I'm happy to report that this has not been a problem for me with this set. I suspect anyone who has run into any blur issues may have had signal source problems or poor quality cables, there may not have been a real problem with the TV itself? I'm extremely satisfied with the picture quality, movies, sports and Blu Rays all look amazing. The preset \"AV Mode\" viewing configurations have been perfect for all of my viewing so far. While it is true that this set may not have as many points of adjustment as others out there, I've been down that road with other sets. I personally don't enjoy tweaking my picture settings every time the natural light changes in the room, I like the presets and the ambient light sensor and they work well. I would agree with other reviews that the audio quality of this set is mediocre. This seems to be an issue with most of the slim profile TV's though and this way they can get an extra $150 out of you for a sound bar. I already had a nice  surround sound receiver so this is a minor issue for me. So, bottom line... I think it's the perfect TV choice for a brightly lit room (or any room really), great picture quality, decent black levels, no frills but no complaints at this price point.And in case any video purists out there suspect I don't know the difference in a great, versus an average picture... I also own a Panasonic TC-P55VT50 plasma, which is frequently cited as having one of the best pictures out there. I wouldn't say the Sharp is a match for the Panasonic, but if you account for the price difference it's close enough. I recommend the Sharp LC60LE600U.", "Date": "January 22, 2013"}, {"Title": "Videophiles look elsewhere", "Author": "K.

If you are a regular TV, Sports, Movie watcher that wants a gigantic TV for a great price, then please, look no further.  I have owned Aquos TVs (3 now) for the last 15 years of my life, and have yet to be disappointed.  The colors, quality, and sharpness of this TV is perfect for my tastes.  All movies and TV Shows through my Apple TV are crisp and clear (one warning, Apple TV DOES NOT show video at 120 Hz).  My XBox games are outstanding (again, XBox does not run at 120 Hz, either).  HD television channels are insanely good, and overall I am very happy with this TV.  I would highly recommend this to anyone but the most discerning videophiles.", "Date": "January 25, 2013"}, {"Title": "Sharp AQUOS LC-60LE600U", "Author": "jk", "ReviewID": "R1XLHRKY422PQJ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "If you are tired of paying for Smart TV since you already have it with one of your components and have no need for 3D, but want a pure 60\" monitor with a great picture for your home theater this is the answer. Very easy calibration with simple easy to understand settings this TV is outstanding! Unforunately, Amazon could not deliver the goods and after three weeks of waiting for them to receive stock on the item, I ordered it from Dell. Regardless of where you get the TV from I suggest you push the button as the price for this is great and don't waste your time on a Vizio for the same price as it does not have the quality.", "Date": "March 6, 2013"}, {"Title": "Great TV", "Author": "Bill Cavalieri", "ReviewID": "RS9T0FYS0XC9O", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "We bought this TV after reading reviews on it and several competing models. We already own a smaller SHARP AQUOS and like it. The picture on this TV is outstanding and I didn't have to tweak the color settings at all. I did disable the automatic adjustment of the backlight and picked specific device names for the inputs rather than \"HDMI1\" etc. The sound is acceptable, no worse than competing TVs sound, but a little thin for my taste so I added a decent soundbar to the mix. Sharp's AQUOS support line is excellent. I called them because it wouldn't finish the channel scan. If you have only HDMI inputs, like your blu-ray player and satellite box, you exit EZ-SETUP after you pick the language and TV location, then just hit input on your remote and select one of the HDMI ports. I called Dish to set up the satellite remote for the new TV, the \"device code\" for it is 521.We watched the Superbowl on it yesterday and I didn't see any blur or choppy lines during movement. We've watched some movies on it and my wife watched her dog show, no complaints. The big bright crisp picture is impressive. My wife said it was almost like being at a movie theater.There is no \"Smart TV\" function but I didn't want it. We have the Internet on our blu-ray player. If you need Internet connection buy the LC-60LE640U.", "Date": "February 4, 2013"}, {"Title": "So far, so good. Great pic, and no blur.", "Author": "B.

I didn't need the smart apps of the 640, as I have all thatwith my Blu Ray player. The TV's internal sound is not good, but I have a 5.1 surround set up, so that was not much of a concern for me. Otherwise I would just adda sound bar.The 60\" size is amazing, and I think this set is great bang for the buck.", "Date": "January 28, 2013"}, {"Title": "Digital audio output problems", "Author": "Saul Dolgin", "ReviewID": "R21BSAKKZ6ECBV", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "I bought this TV in December from a big box retailer.  The problem is the (optical) digital audio output does not work unless I change a setting in the Audio menu.  Every time the TV is turned off and then back on the audio output signal to the receiver stops working again.  As of now, Sharp USA does not have a fix for the problem.  There are other customers on Sharp's support website reporting the exact same problem with this particular model.We are using HDMI input 1 & 2 from Digital Cable (1) and Blu-Ray (2).  The optical digital audio out is going to a Yamaha receiver that works fine with 2 other HD TV's (both different brands).  The only way to get the source audio from the TV to send through to the receiver is to change PC Audio Select from \"HDMI\" to \"PC IN\" and then back again.  It also seems to cut out again once we turn off the components, switch input sources or even going between live TV and DVR recordings on our Scientific Atlanta / Cisco cable box.Otherwise, the picture is amazing.  Of the 3 HDTV's we own, this one has the most stunning picture quality.  It's too bad about the audio.  I might need to return the TV very soon if a fix is not made available.", "Date": "January 31, 2013"}, {"Title": "Great TV.. for the price.", "Author": "CSpaR", "ReviewID": "R1PYAKFTGNB52J", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I just bought this TV to replace a 3 year old Samsung 52\" LCD, without LED. It took me a while to figure out the menu options, but now it's dialed in and looking great. Like I named this review, it's a great TV... for the price. There are better ones out othere for sure, but not for 999 black friday. I didnt need wifi, which this doesnt have. However, my dvd player does have it so no worries.The picture is much larger than my old 52\", ofcourse. Picture quality looks alot better too. I use my test movie Star Ware 3 opening battle scene over Coresant. I had both TVs next to each other to compare, switching back and forth with an HDMI cable. I can see the difference. My Samsung has 150,000:1 contrast and 240 hz. This Sharp is much higher at 4,000,000:1 but only 120hz. I was worried about this, but scenes where I could see motion blur in a regular 60hz are not there in this 120hz Sharp.Like the other review said, the sales guy I talked to also said it's the same TV as the 640 model but without Smart and wifi. I thought I'd read a review that said there's a slight difference but they are essentaily the same. I'm a happy camper for sure. It's a low end price TV and you get what you pay for. A no thrills TV with great picture and size for the price.", "Date": "November 25, 2012"}, {"Title": "Decent 60\" TV for the Budget Conscious Shopper", "Author": "Glenville Pratt", "ReviewID": "R103F6JUH3SM63", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I was initially worried that I made a bad purchase, but the picture compares very favorably to my new Samsung 40 inch - only much larger.Like most televisions, the LC60LE600U needs calibrating, or adjusting, for acceptable performance.  The most useful change is to turn off motion enhancement, turn off OPC, and increase contrast and sharpness.Use the calibration guidelines for its sibling LC60LE640U as a starting point although this TV has fewer advanced parameters.  The guidelines can be found on the internet.  The OPC setting controls the brightness of the TV dependent on the ambient lighting in the room.  If you find the display too dark, turn it off or adjust the lower limit in the advanced settings.  Motion enhancement affects blurring so turn it off or change it to low.Update: January 27, 2013This TV is used with a wirelessly connected Apple TV3 (Netflix, Youtube, HuluPlus) and I haven't tried it with conventional or SD input sources.  At this size, the quality of your input source is important.In short, I am still happy with this purchase.", "Date": "December 18, 2012"}, {"Title": "Great TV but possible main board issue. Like anything else you buy is guaranteed  to not break!!", "Author": "Jeffrey Monahan", "ReviewID": "RIBKEU9HYJR11", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Great picture and descent sound quality. You can turn up the motion control and make it almost 3d with out the glasses. I am impressed with that for sure.  I hate people who knock a whole brand because of one problem. Stuff breaks and electronics die. It happens. I remember when TV's had tubes and they would go out. You put a new one in and kept going. It was a huge possibility it would go out. But whatever. anyways beware the HDMI inputs go bad on the main board. I got this TV back in march of 2013. Died yesterday 11-24-13 :( People at sharp were for the most part easy enough to talk to. They are sending out a tech to my house in a couple days. Probably not till after thanks giving is my guess. Don't blame them. What I've read is the HD inputs go out and force the tv to shut itself down. The only way to power it back up is to unplug the unit. But if you leave the HD inputs plugged in it will shut down within a min or two. But if you leave them out it will stay on but of course you will be just looking at a blank screen. We've done a master reset involves unplugging the tv. then hold vol down and input buttons. then plug in the tv while holding said buttons. A green letter K will appear on the left. then hold vol down and ch down till a service menu appears. let go the buttons and use the remote arrow keys and go to the 2nd page. the first like will say inut us. hit ok and the screen should turn green meaning the reset is complete then unplug and replug the tv and it is reset. Didn't help me but maybe someone else if you're having problems.  But besides this issue the TV has been great!! I would buy another sharp. I have a panasonic and a cheap visio. They've been great and would buy another one of them as well.", "Date": "November 25, 2013"}, {"Title": "Disappointing", "Author": "Not So Sharp", "ReviewID": "R2EZDUJCRBGRE0", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "After six months the TV stopped working.

Heck", "ReviewID": "R3KGH3HHC77HZA", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I just finished setting up the LC-60LE600U.  I bought this model because I didn't need all of the Smart Apps or 3D.  For all of those apps, I have a very nice Blu-Ray player which can accommodate those needs.Unboxing was not bad, but the TV is large and although I can easily lift the TV myself, it is much safer to have two people.  The only difficulty I had was the stand.  The stands exterior is black gloss plastic but the infrastructure is metal.  So it appears to be quite solid.  You attach two metal pieces to the stand which was easy enough, and then you and a friend lift and set the TV onto these two metal things which slide into the back of the TV.  So far so good.  So although the TV is not going anywhere, they want you to screw the TV into the stand.  That was the only issue I had.  I double and triple checked my screws to make sure they were the correct ones and I simply could not get them to go in.  So I elected to not even use them.  Like I said, the TV is not going anywhere and should you attempt to lift the TV, that stand stayed attached as well.Now that the TV was in place, I turned it on and performed the EZ Setup and we had lift off.  I read thru the manual at all of the options and made a few adjustments.They have a few great new technologies on these TV's, that look great on paper, but I would prefer not to use myself.  One of these was an option that automatically monitors the light in the room and automatically adjusts the screen brightness.  I found this to be irritating as the screen appeared to flicker from dim to bright on occasion.  This is not a negative thing because Sharp gives you the option to turn it off.  I'm also not a fan of the \"Truflow\" or \"Fluidmotion\" or all the other fancy names they give for the ability to smooth out the picture and make everything look like a video tape.  Unlike some other TV's I have had the opportunity to setup for friends, Sharp's setup controls are very easy to understand and to turn off that function.  In addition, there were some other picture enhancement functions I had not seen before that improved overall clarity.I was also impressed with the TV speakers.  Please understand, I do not believe the manufacture ever intended for their TV speakers to substitute as Home Theater speakers.  But for watching TV shows and normal viewing, these speakers are great.  When it's time to watch a Blu-Ray, the Home Theater system goes on and we use \"real\" speakers to listen to movies.  That being said, if you don't have the cash for the whole Home Theater experience, a sound bar is a great substitute especially if you use it for \"normal\" TV watching too. So for reviewers who have stated that they thought the TV speakers were poor, I guess it's about expectations.  I suppose if you mounted the TV to a wall, it might affect the sound because the speakers are on the back of the set, however I cannot comment on wall mounting and sound.I also wanted to comment about the TV remote.  I personally use a Harmony remote so the remote that came with the TV will get tucked nicely in a drawer; however, this remote seemed oddly out of place with this TV.  Again, it's probably a matter of preference, but the remote is very minimal.  It's small and the rounded ends seem dated.  On the plus side, because it is so small, there are not a lot of confusing buttons and the functions are straight forward.  Again, the remote for me is not a negative, but for some, it may be important.", "Date": "July 8, 2013"}, {"Title": "I must have gotten a lemon...", "Author": "Robert", "ReviewID": "R3KHZVKEXSRGDV", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I was originally planning on buying a LC60LE640U, based on the glowing reviews, but when I saw that Best Buy had this TV for $200 cheaper, I decided on this model instead. According to the salesman, the LC60LE600U was exactly the same as the 640U, only with all of the smart apps removed. As I found out, that's not entirely true. the 600U lacks many of the picture adjustment controls like RGB and Gamma that are on the 640U. While those extra controls may not be necessary for many viewers, it is something I wish I'd known beforehand.After setting up the TV and watching for a few hours, The remote stopped responding, and the set shut off a few seconds later. The only way to get it to turn on again was to unplug and re-plug the power chord. I was eventually able to fix this somehow by turning the TV on with all connections removed, and plugging the HDMI cables back in again. It never shut off by itself again after that, but it seemed like something must have been faulty.When watching movies, I had the same issue as another reviewer with motion blur/ghosting. The picture looks fine in bright, high-contrast scenes, but darker scenes became a smeary mess on the screen, to the point where it was almost un-watchable. Turning on motion smoothing helped a bit, but the ghosting was still very noticeable, and looked like something I've only seen in early lcd screens from the 90's. I tried every single setting and combination to fix this, but even at the most optimal settings the picture was bad.Needless to say, I returned it. I'm hoping that my set was just a lemon, because most reviews of this TV praise the picture quality. Some might say that maybe I was expecting too much from a cheap 60\", but the $999 Vizio that I replaced it with looks 100x better.", "Date": "December 1, 2012"}, {"Title": "Returned it", "Author": "JTM", "ReviewID": "R2P1MJ6NK74Y4G", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I bought the lc60le600u from another retailer after reading a lot of positive reviews for it and the 640u.

Unfortunately it seems it is no longer possible to buy a large tv without all the bells and whistles but still has a good quality picture.  After hours and hours of online research and changing settings I finally have a tolerable picture on HD channels but everything else is almost unwatchable because there is so much pixelation and blur.  The remote is horrible and the menus aren't much better. One of the most irritating things is that when you change the AV mode on any of the inputs it will not stay on that one when you turn the tv off.  So each time I turn the tv on I have to change it from the default of DYNAMIC (fixed), which is the worst setting because it cannot be adjusted, to the one I prefer. Talk about irritating!

I exhausted every conceivable combination of the limited amount of picture settings available on this set, but to no avail. Some salespersons might try to tell you that this set is essentially the LC60LE640U, but without the smart functionality. This is simply not true. This set is nowhere near the quality of the LC60LE640U, and that set isn't even that high of quality in the first place. This set does have an optical Toslink output, but the set doesn't pass audio from HDMI inputs through to the optical port, so what's the point. The included remote looks and feels like a children's toy, which in and of itself shouldn't be a huge factor, but in this case of an already terrible TV, it just felt like adding insult to injury. The picture, when not moving, is just a little bit worse than OK. The only way I could see this set being used is for PowerPoint presentations, but the VGA port on the unit I received was defective, so there goes that option. Besides, at this price point, you'd be much better off getting a cheap projector for that purpose. This TV is truly a disaster in every facet of its execution. I found out the hard way why no brick and mortar store ever has this set on display, they just have it boxed up in the back. Ultimately, I returned this set for the Panasonic TC-L55ET5.
