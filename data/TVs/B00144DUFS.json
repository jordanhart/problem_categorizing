I bought mine in 2003 and still use it today, no problems so far.  I love this TV, great sound, great picture and great HD.  It looks nice and has all the channels to hook up the gadgets.  It is a great TV.  Unfortunately everything is going plasma or LCD or what ever.  I paid just over $2000 for mine, 6 years later and at the end of its run this should be priced well under a grand.  Its not that it is not worth it, its just that its time is up.  I would check out the newer generation TVs, that is the best way to go.  Check out Panasonic, all my Panasonic products have lasted long past their prime.", "Date": "August 27, 2009"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "Unavailable", "Features": "Experience incredibly sharp picture quality, brilliant color and resonating sound\nStandard features for amazingly clear and detailed images\nImpressive stereo sound and enhanced, vivid color quality\nOffers big entertainment for your family\nBrand is well known for its reputation", "Name": "Panasonic PT 47WX49 - 47\" rear projection TV ( CRT ) - widescree", "ImgURL": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/21ck3A5oIPL.jpg", "ProductID": "B00144DUFS"}}
