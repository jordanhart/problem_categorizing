{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Worth paying more for the 500U than the 50U", "Author": "Chitta R. Baral", "ReviewID": "R3F0B4UJDAVKFB", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This model (Panasonic TH-42PX500U) is a lot more expensive than the Panasonic TH-42PX50U. The difference in prices in amazon for both items is a bit too much. This model is not available in most chain stores (Cicuit city, best buy etc.). A local store had both models and I could buy this model for a couple of hundred dollars more. I think for $200 more it is worth it, as it has the following advantage over the 50U.1. 500 U has 6 speakers (2 bass-reflex woofers: 6 ohms, 120Hz-2Khz, 10%THD) (4 tweeters: 8 ohms, 500Hz-15Khz,10%THD) 26 W power. VS50 U has 2 (16W, 6 ohms, 105Hz-20KHz 10%THD)2. 500 U has BBE ViVA HD3D sound.3. 500 U has a photoviewer (SD and PC card slots).4. 500U has Sd card slot5. 500 U has 2 rear and 1 front composite video input vs  50 U has only 2 rear ones.6. 500 U has 2 rear and 1 front S-video input vs  50 U has only 2 rear ones.7. 500 U has 2 rear and 1 front audio input (for video) vs  50 U has only 2 rear ones.8. 500 U has PC input (RGB-VGA) i.e., mini D-sub 15-pin (rear)9. 500 U has a audio input for PC (M3 stereo plug)10. 500 U has a TV guide on-screen program guide.11. 500 U has Picture-in-picture (split screen display -- 2 sources)12. 500 U power consumpition is listed at 357 W and for 50U it is listed at 399W.13. 500U dimensions: 28.7\" X 44.&\" X 5.4\"  50U dimensions  27 39/64\" X 42 3/64\" X 3 51/64\"14. 500 U is 88.2 lbs; 50 U is 76.06 lbs.15.

Huynh", "ReviewID": "R1RZW0B5QFOQPE", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Panasonic has proven again that they do make one of the best plasma TV out there.My TH-42PX500U arrived from Amazon is one perfect shape. Setup was super easy. The beauty of this plasma is viewing the HD channels...the quality is unbelievable.Yes, I did my extensive research before making my purchase.I researched LCDs and DLP LCDs (rear projection) as well as other plasmas.Pioneer PDP-4350 and Sony plasmas were considered until I compared the picture quality side to side at the store.Bottom line: the picture quality of Panasonic 42PX500U is equal or better in most cases.My only complaint: the TV only has one input feed for RF antenna. I would prefer two (as Sony and Pioneer do have) input feeds where I can connect an DHTV antenna and as well as cable antenna.Other than that, it's worth the keep!", "Date": "November 1, 2005"}, {"Title": "Beautiful picture", "Author": "Quoad Toad", "ReviewID": "R3QVE58FI8LRM", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This is a great tv.  The picture quality is supurb.  The images from HD programs are especially impressive.  I've had this tv for 2 months now and have no complaints.Features that set this tv apart from others:-PCMCIA slot - with a PCMCIA adapter you can use almost any camera memory card to view photos on your tv.-Even standard definition channels look great on this tv.  I know some people have had complaints that standard definition doesn't look as good as on a normal tv, but for wide aspect tv's, this one has great images in standard definition.-Nice sound/invisible speakers - You can hardly tell that this tv has built in speakers. The tv itself is black and the speakers blend in perfectly.  I used the tv speakers for a month before getting a new receiver and they worked great.I researched pasma tv's for a couple months before selecting this model.  The price is great (purchased for around $2,700) and the picture quality is excellent.", "Date": "December 6, 2005"}, {"Title": "Nice Picture, BAD Service", "Author": "Vernon F. Selvy \"Robbed by Panasonic\"", "ReviewID": "R9A9PKQDWLFTI", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "We bought or Panasonic in October 2005. We installed a cable card but were unhappy with the lack of a DVR. Almost immediately the TV Guide feature failed, then the clock, then the re-call program data feature. We got a new tuner installed (took 4 weeks) and then failed again. After 4 service calls (they recorded 2 because \"they don't count until we fix it\"). In February, Comcast came out and pulled the 'not ready for prime time cable card' and installed a cable box. The TV's features were built around the cable card and the service guys told me they are nothing but trouble. The second tuner was defective from the factory so they put the lame one back in. By now it was April and 5 months after buying my new plasma I've had very little use of the features I paid for, So I got a hold of Panasonic and they told me about the jerk (Peterson) field service rep who plays God about who gets a new TV. Long story short, you need to hire an attorney when you purchase a Panasonic product. It's now June, and after taking my TV into their shop for 3 weeks it finally works. But I have a used TV I've barely used and never again will I buy Panasonic.", "Date": "June 1, 2006"}, {"Title": "42 \" Plasma HD ready", "Author": "Milton L.
