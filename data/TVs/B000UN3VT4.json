{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Excellent HD LCD TV for the price.", "Author": "C. Brown", "ReviewID": "R2QN6CNB9FP460", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "After researching for 3 weeks, I was set on a Sharp TV.  Sony was too expensive for my price range, and while I read a lot of good things about Samsung, this TV's features for the price sold me.  After having it for a little while now, this is how I would rate it.Price - Excellent. 4.5/5  Sharp was the cheapest prices between the top 3-4 brands I looked at that had a familiar name and plenty of reviews.  I did examine other brands with lower prices on 1080p TVs, but I couldn't really obtain enough informational reviews or enough good ones to justify purchasing any of them just for the lower price.Picture - Excellent. 4.25/5.  I'll be honest, I was a little worried when purchasing a Sharp TV.  First of all, I saw it's previous model (the D62U) at a Best Buy and a Circuit City and was not totally impressed with the picture, but I had heard that sometimes bad feeds or other issues can make a store-display not as attractive.  However, my real concern was if my TV would have the infamous \"banding\" that seemed to plague some of Sharp's earlier models.  You can easily find out what banding is by searching something like \"Sharp banding issues\".  I won't go into specifics myself about that.  Anyway, I had read this model of TV -can- have banding, but that it is not near as common nor as significant in earlier models.  My TV has no noticeable banding issues at all, and I'm not going to go out of my way to nitpick and search for any small issues that may be there as I can't see them now.As for the picture itself, it is great.  Much better than the store displays for the earlier model that had me worry.  Obviously, out-of-box settings aren't the best.  At first I tried to change picture modes (of which there are several) to a User setting and tweak it using recommendations from some tech forums.  This became tedious as people posted different specs and none were really quite looking right for me.  So I gave up on that and just tried them on the default settings for what I was doing.  I set my HDMI PS3 input to Gaming picture and it looks great.  I see no reason to change it beyond that, it looks exactly as I was hoping for.  Same with the Movie setting as well for my DVD input.  No dead pixels and a crisp clear picture with good contrast black levels and brightness make it a great choice.Plenty of options available for picture adjustment as well.Features -  Very Good. 4/5  Plenty of inputs.  You can read the specs in the item description.  My only reason for docking it a point is because the 3rd HDMI and 2nd Component are located on the side and stick out when plugged in.  I can understand this could be an eyesore for those wall-mounting it or just not wanting to see them sticking out.  I am not using that 3rd HDMI port (yet), but I do have 2 component items hooked up and the cords sticking out the side and noticeable from looking at the TV straight-on plus the location of my TV itself does make it a tad annoying, but I am getting used to it and it's not really bothering me as much as it might others.Overall - Excellent. 4.75/5 (note, the overall is not meant to be an average of the other scores).  Overall, it's definately a great buy.  There is more that I could say and some things I have probably forgotten about that I wanted to say, but that's ok.  I don't want to make this too awful long a review.  So, yeah, basically my experience with this TV is amazingly good  and I would easily recommend this TV to anyone who asked me.  It's price, features, and picture easily won me over.", "Date": "October 1, 2007"}, {"Title": "In the interest of balance", "Author": "Zampano \"Film Geek\"", "ReviewID": "RIBPJECFUT6VV", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I am writing this because I have seen some reviews trashing Sharp's customer service, and I felt the need to share my own experience to even things out.I had originally ordered the LC-42D62U (not from Amazon - sorry!), but discovered some minor 'banding' issues with the set when I hooked it up.  Overall, the picture was outstanding, but in dark or deep shadow areas slight variations in tone were evident as horizontal bands.  If I'd only spent a couple hundred dollars on the set, I might have just let it go, but for over $1500, this wasn't acceptable.  I was initially nervous because, although most customer reviews for Sharp's LCDs were positive, some of the negative ones were accompanied by customer service horror stories.  So, with some trepidation, I called Sharp.  It was a Wednesday afternoon.  The representative I spoke to was courteous and friendly, and asked if I could take a digital photo of the problem and e-mail it to Sharp.  That was reasonable to me, so I agreed.  I didn't get a chance to send the pics until Friday around noon, from my office.  By the time I got home from work I had received a reply thanking me for the pics and promising a prompt reply.  By the time I woke up on Saturday, I had received another e-mail saying they had reviewed the pics, would exchange the set, and would contact me to make arrangements.  Monday morning I got a call at my office from another courteous rep telling me that my new set would arrive in 7-10 days, and the trucking company would pick up the old set when they dropped off the new - AND that since the D62 line was no longer in production, they would be sending me one of their brand new (thinner, lighter, more feature-laden) D64's.The exchange went off without a hitch, and the new set looks absolutely fantastic.  Like all LCDs, some fine tuning was definitely required, as the out-of-box settings are overly bright and saturated (to make them pop on showroom floors), but once the set is properly tuned it looks amazing.  Blu-ray is awesome!!So, the product is a definite winner, and my initial problems were handled with speed, courtesy, and professionalism.  All in all, I have to say that this turned out to be the best experience I've ever had with customer service from ANY company.", "Date": "October 15, 2007"}, {"Title": "Great TV", "Author": "ACA \"ACA\"", "ReviewID": "R2SVMLT5JQOJ6F", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "After many hours of research I came to the conclusion that this TV would be the right one for me.  I needed an LCD because the room that I have set it up in is very bright during the day and is in direct sunlight and LCD was the right choice.  I have set it with PS3 as my DVD/Blue ray player using HDMI and the picture quality is fantastic.  Overall I am extremely pleased with the build quality and picture quality of the TV.  The remote control is not the best in the world but is sufficient.  You will likely need a surround sound system since the speakers on TV's are not of the highest quality.  I have used a Yamaha receiver coupled with Infinity speakers and this has worked great.  One word of advise: If you buy from Amazon contact the seller after they have shipped the item so you can get the phone number for the shipping company so you can make sure someone is home when the TV is to be delivered.  I had no problems whatesover.  The TV arrived in great condition with no dead pixels.  Overall I am extremely pleased with this TV and the price obtained at Amazon was great.

My first week was with standard signal, great picture. No sign of problems reported with earlier Sharps such as banding or dead cells. Appreciated how easy it was to move around and how it fitted into my entertainment center where other brands would have forced me to go 40\". Yesterday I got HD satellite. Wow! Whether we watch high speed soccer games, or the Gallery channel fine art, everything is true to life.  The satellite intaller also said he had never seen a TV that recognizes the satellite box rather than him having to set it up. He also said it was a very good TV, and I guess he sees a lot.  The audio is very good. We don't have a home theatre setup, but the TV audio is more than fine.  Amazon was a good buy.  I see that Circuit City just advertised this box for a $300 discount, but still $200 more than I paid even if you include shipping.

I'm not the type of buyer to buy a new piece of electronic equipment on a fly. My last television lasted 10 years, needless to say I shop for a long term investment. This television in one word is \"beautiful.\"We (my wife and I) went to the store to buy a Sony Television--that's all we ever purchased in the past. They are simply too expensive and with the guide of Consumer Reports we started looking at the Toshiba televisions. We saw the picture quality of the Sharp Aquos LC42D64U and we were awestruck. We kept viewing other televisions and kept going back to the Sharp Aquos.It's just a beautiful piece of Art when it is off. It is incredibly slim and the shiny bezel gives it a golden touch. When it's on, watching the HD channels is so mesmerizing that it literally transcends you. The regular channels look very good as well but of course, not as beautiful as the HD channels. We have a standard DVD player and even with that, the picture is absolutely stunning--imagine with an HD DVD player.In addition, the television has an amazing list of features. It has several features including: an analog PC input, HDMI 1.3 with CEC and Deep Color support, side input panel, and a lot more picture adjustment settings. It also has an RS-232 control port if you have a control system for your AV. It has a USB port for updating firmware in the future which is a great addition (this will allow future HDMI protocols to be implemented).The only draw back I would give is that the speaker sound quality could be better BUT that doesn't take away from the overall performance of the television. If you have a surround sound system, then that reasoning is moot. If you don't, I would still purchase this television because the sound is very good, just in comparison to the television you'll expect a master sound theatre.", "Date": "December 19, 2007"}, {"Title": "Recalibrate and Enjoy!", "Author": "HDfan", "ReviewID": "R1J1UWP7388B8F", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "With a bit of simple recalibration the Aquos LC42D64U will live up to all of your expectations.  Turn to page 26 of the owners manual and adjust the picture to your liking.  I reduced the backlight by a few clicks and increased the contrast and tint slightly.  Your viewing conditions and own preferences will determine what looks best for you.  I also recommend turning on the Fine Motion function shown on page 27 of the manual.  This will ensure the TV achieves the 4ms Response Time as advertised.  The last thing to double check is that your cable or satellite signal is set at a full 1080i -- check your HD-DVR manual for details.  With these quick and easy steps taken care of I tuned into the Vikings/Raiders football game live in HD on CBS and WOW was I impressed.  The picture was crystal clear, bright but not overwhelming.  Even the fastest moving action was sharp and crisp, the colors saturated and vibrant.  I can honestly say the Aquos is everything I hoped it would be.

I also had tried a 40 1080p Samsung but the video noise on both HD and SD channels was really bad. So far I'm glad I purchased this sharp tv. I think they do some sort of upscaling on the SD channels because they don't look as bad as other LDC HD tv's. The HD channels look great and in my opinion there's less video noise and distortion then what I have seen on other TV's from vizio, Samsung and sony.

We are not appliance geeks and simply wanted a good TV. The Sharp fit the bill. Super bright picture, it looks fantastic even in our great room which has a wall of 16' high south facing windows. Far brighter and of course overall superior to a tube picture. The resolution is crisp, the colors true, and there is absolutely no blurring of motion or pixelation. The depth of field of a high definition broadcast is wonderful - the focus is superb from the batter in the box right back to the fans in row 30 in the same shot. The TV sounds great too, I'm not bothering to use external speakers. After looking at a few brands in a showroom I did not stress too much over this decision. The fact is that any one of the current models from Sharp, Samsung, Toshiba, Sony, etc., will simply blow you away once you get it home and stop looking at 10 screens side by side, trying to figure out which is better.", "Date": "October 22, 2007"}, {"Title": "Great picture", "Author": "troy sheets", "ReviewID": "RELTGKUD00GLH", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Fantastic picture quality on this TV.

The delivery only took 5 days, coming in 4 days early (yay), and went fairly smoothly (slight mix up about the actual delivery day).  It was handled by Eagle since I purchased this directly from Amazon.  I have HD cable service through Cox.  The HD images are superb, especially sporting events, though all of the cable HD content looks great.  The SD programming looks MUCH better than I expected even when it is zoomed to fit the screen.  Do not use what you see in stores as a reference because their video feeds must be terrible.  I was worried that SD programming would be unwatchable but it is not a problem.  I also don't see any banding or cloudiness issues I have seen the videophiles complain about.  Personally I think they are being hyper-critical when looking for faults.  This set has great black levels when adjusted properly.  The default settings are way too bright, but a little searching online will find good setup defaults to use for the best possible performance.  The Aquos 42D64U is a great value in terms of features and performance.  The picture and sound are excellent and it has a nice set of tweakable items to play with.  The design of the TV is classy and looks nice sitting in the room.  I would definitely recommend this TV to anyone.  Actually I have already made another sale for Sharp because my best friends father just ordered one based on our praise.  I am very pleased with my purchase and you will be too.

LCD's have come a long way in the last two years.  I paid less for this fully loaded 42 inch LCD than I did for my first LCD, a 30 incher with non HDCP compliant DVI hookup, no HDMI and no tuner.  The Sharp Aquos has everything you want.  1080p, 3 HDMI, HD component, built in tuner for cable and antenna, and it looks very elegant in with its svelted profile.  Calibration is key to getting your money's worth from today's televisions.  The bigbox stores are actually charging 200-300 bucks for calibration.  Unbelievable.  I used my old tv to calibrate my new one.  Now that I have it calibrated I'm in tv viewing heaven.  I just watched Bladerunner on HD-DVD.  It was a revelation, I was in awe.  If I could add something to the Sharp it would be to have unique video profiles for each input because each input is processing the video differently.  If I calibrate my tv to perfection for the xbox 360 it may not be the perfect calibration for the PS3 of for digital tv.  Calibration is not an exact science.  It's a lot like using filters in Photoshop.  I imagine in the future tv's will have filters just like Photoshop.  They could also name the inputs by type instead of generic \"input 1\", \"input 2\".  It could also  use one more digital audio hookup, either an additional optical or a coaxial which it doesn't have.  Those are very minor issues though.

I guess I was biding my time and hoping the prices would drop drastically.  Well, they have dropped - but not drastically.  But all the while, my top choices were narrowed down to 2 or three sets, this being one of them.  For me, price was a big consideration, as well has having 1080p.  Quality was a close third, though.  So once I found this set brand new for an unusually low price, I jumped on it and I'm very happy I did.I think Sharp created this 42\" size class of TV to stand out from the more common 40\" sizes.  But this TV is more than just a screen size - the picture quality (after some tweaking) is really excellent.  This is especially apparent when viewing outdoor landscapes (or golf) in HD.  There are far too many picture/color/hue settings to get into here, but I don't think this TV fails for lack of picture settings.  While the quality is good out of the box, a little tweaking will make it excellent.  You can find a few internet sites out there that give you some good picture settings to use.  Action and movement is pretty good - the picture blurs a little on fast camera pans, but so does every other LCD I've seen.  At 8 feet away, the slight blur is a non-issue.  You should know that the 4ms response times this TV advertises can only be had when turning on the \"fast motion\" option in the settings.  But I haven't even felt the need to turn it on.The built-in sound is good, though if you're coming from a cabinet TV that has built-in high quality stereo speakers, I can see why you'd be a little disappointed.  There is a surround sound simulator option that works pretty well to improve the sound.  Bass & treble can also be adjusted.  To me, the built-in sound is actually better than my previous 27\" RCA tube TV with stereo speakers.When you first turn on the TV, an on-screen wizard will walk you through setting up your channels.  Which gets me to my only issue with this TV: I'm running the TV using an over-the-air antenna.  My only beef with the TV is that once it automatically finds the available channels during the setup, it locks them in; you can choose to skip them, but should there be any other channels that the TV didn't find that you want to add to the channel list, the TV will not let you do it.  Bottom line: the TV will not let you \"add\" a channel to the channel list that it didn't find automatically.  This could be a problem with users of directional antennas.  I think Sharp could fix this with a firmware update, but to date, they haven't.In sum, this TV has one of the best pictures I've seen, the sound is actually good, and I'm really pleased with it overall.

We went to the store to do a side by side for this TV and other 42 inchers. This came out on top. True, there are newer models and other brands that were slightly better and have a higher price to boot. We're talking $500 to $1,000 more. If you want bigger than 42\" then we're talking about $100 dollars extra per inch. 42\" is just fine for our mid sized living room. Any bigger and it would have been over whelming (never thought I would say that).As far as this model: It has automatic color adjustments, so that you don't have to play with the color settings forever. Also good response time. The anti glare is awesome. Other LCDs and plasmas reflect like crazy. This one even has automatic brightness adjustment as it senses the amount of light in the room.

Well, it turns out I can review the support I got when the TV didn't work. The short story is that Sharp's support was fantastic.First, the Amazon White Glove delivery was great. Scheduling TV delivery was easy. The delivery was on time. The delivery guy explained that the service does not include assembly of the TV to the stand. This could have left me with a problem, as I would have quite a difficulty assembling the TV and placing it on the TV stand myself. But when I started assembling the stand immediately (which was simple and bullet-proof), the guy was quite helpful and actually ended up doing much of the work himself. I also appreciated the offer to take the packing material away. I have heard that thieves sometimes cruise the streets, looking for boxes like this on the curb as a marker of houses to \"hit\". The TV was on with a great picture. Having done more than his job, the delivery guy left.But when I went to set up the TV, it didn't work. The \"Easy Setup\" and \"Channel Setup\" options were not available. If you already have a digital TV, you know that you can't just select a channel number. The TV has to scan the signals from your antenna / cable box / satellite dish, decide what signals are available, and configure itself to receive those signals. The option that does this for the Sharp TV is called \"Easy Setup\" or \"Channel Setup\". Not having these available meant I couldn't receive TV except by using my old digital TV converter box.The service flier claims this TV qualifies for exclusive Aquos Advantage service. They offer a toll-free number and a web site. Yada yada. I called the toll-free number, and was shocked when a technician answered right away. I ended up calling several times and talking to several technicians. Each time a tech answered promptly. Each time the tech couldn't believe my problem. Each tech went through a simple and quick troubleshooting process with me, then offered a suggestion which involved some lengthy period of time with the TV turned off; followed by my calling again. Throughout the process, the support techs were polite, professional, and helpful. They did a great job of tracking previous calls. When it became obvious this problem was not going to be solved over the telephone, they arranged for a local company to come to my house.The local TV support company was just as great as the telephone support team. Before they came, they ordered a main computer board. Unfortunately, the main board was the wrong one for my TV. The tech wrote down the correct part number and left. A few days later, the new main board arrived and another tech came to our house. The tech successfully replaced the main board, but it did not solve the problem.At this point, the tech called his contact at Sharp. After a lengthy conversation, they decided the TV was stuck in \"hotel mode\". The purpose of hotel mode is to prevent hotel guests from re-programming the TV. After they went through the secret dance to put the TV in consumer mode, everything worked great.So here's my addition to the reviews already posted. Not only is the Sharp Aquos a great TV with a great picture. It's a product backed up with amazingly awesome support.

Was trying to decide between the Sharp, the Sony and the Samsung, also looked at the Westinghouse as I have one of their 32 inch sets and have been happy with it.Eventually chose the Sharp due to the small footprint for the screen size, and that I got 2 extra inches of screen for essentially the same price or less (Sony and Samsung are 40\").  Also, I'm a gamer, and the Sharp accepts the 1080P signal through the component inputs on the Xbox 360 just like it says it does.  The others may as well, but I couldn't find any literature documenting it, and good luck with the salespeople at electronic stores.I clearly made the right decision, the picture is outstanding after some tweaking of the settings.  Bear in mind you might not be happy with the set out of the box; give it a chance, you will be rewarded.  I have looked for the banding everyone talks about, and as yet have not detected it, and I have been REALLY looking for it.As for the comparison with the Westinghouse, this TV is a clear step above it in quality and contrast.

I checked the AMZ site for more than a month and read reviews and jumped in.  I had read several positive reviews about the buydig delivery process.  On the AMZ site about every third day bugdig showed up as the lowest price so that sealed the deal.  I totally agree that the shipping company they use (Manna) is very efficient with great communication throughout the process.  Unlike FebEx or UPS, they call first and schedule a time within a 4 hour window (nice).  Then I received another call when the driver was about 10 minutes out which was very cool.I paid $1389 which included std shipping.  It took about 7 days but hey...that was part of the deal.

I would highly recommend it if it were still for sale.I purchased mine directly through sharpusa.com in early September 2007. I got a special deal through my company (Sharp was a client), 50% off at the time, for a total of $1,000. I got it a bit earlier than retail stores and Sharp's website didn't even acknowledge the model at the time I got it. It may have been from the batch of models that they send to reviewers.I immediately did a full calibration on my TV and it has looked perfect for 5 years with:- No dead pixels- No banding- No ghosting- No dimming back-light- No sudden shut-off issues- No sound issues- No HDMI or other input issues (VCR, DVD, PS3, BluRay, XBox 360, Wii, etc...)- No issues of any kind, whatsoever, no howWe have used the TV at home for a total of several thousand hours. Sometimes we leave the TV on all day and all night (by mistake) and we haven't had a single issue.We have also moved 3 times with the TV with no issues with flexing or breakage during transport, nor any issues with the display afterwards.There were some firmware updates for the TV. I have no idea what they changed but they certainly didn't hurt the TV. It was easy enough as downloading the firmware package to a USB thumbdrive and selecting the update feature in the menu.The only time I ever thought that the TV was going out was when my PS3 would take 10 minutes to show up on screen with the image flickering black on and off faster and faster until it stayed on the HDMI signal. Well, much to my delight the problem was the HDMI cable (go figure). Swapping that out with a $2 monoprice cable solved the problem. I'll never buy an HDMI cable in the store again.It sucks that a few people have suffered through faulty models. I'm honestly sad to hear it because I love mine so much. I have no reason to get rid of it. I have it calibrated just how I want it and I see no reason to replace it. When it breaks I'm going to have a hell of a time finding a replacement to my liking.As for price, the list price was $2,000 at release (according to SharpUSA) and I got it for $1,000. I thought that was a great deal at the time. However, I just bought my mom a 47\" LG 3D TV for $400 at a retail store this month.

I love that you can set so many different factors to really tune in the picture how you want it (I have messed around with them, but ended up happy with factory defaults). It seems to have plenty of inputs, and it is a good looking TV overall. The picture is absolutely amazing! On standard definition programs, there is a very slight bit of overscan at the top of the screen, but that is hardly noticeable. There are only two things that I really found wrong with this TV. If it has been on for many hours, it starts to show some image retention problems (this could be a function of its four year old age). The sound is a bit tinny. I ended up hooking the sound output up to a cheap emerson stereo, and that sounds vastly better than this TV sound.Overall I am very pleased with this TV, considering I only paid two hundred dollars for it used.

Oh well, live and learn I suppose.)First I should say that I don't use this tv for the analog tuner or even watching cable tv, as I do not have a cable box or an antenna hooked up, nor desire to.  What I do use this for is displaying all sorts of content from browsing the web, to deathmatch games directly from my pc's video card (via dvi to hdmi cable) and gaming via my xbox.Let me say that if you're a serious gamer longing for the lag-free response time that you'd get from a crt, only on a large, high def screen, then you need not look any further.  This TV  has a game mode that's actually useful.  My mouse cursor doesn't lag, and timing sensitive games play just like on a crt.  All but the most seriously competitive twitch gamer would be quite satisfied with this tv.  It has a maximum refresh rate of 60hz so it's not as silky smooth as some of the faster crt's, but it's quite satisfactory for me, especially considering the other lcd offerings out there.If you're using this as a pc monitor it's also great, just make sure you hook it up through a digital connection, it supports just about any resolution I could throw at it.  And just press the \"view mode\" button on the remote to get the full resolution of your video device without any overscan, it makes for very sharp, readable text (especially at 1920 by 1080).As for image quality, it's top notch with only very very minor flaws.  It should satisfy all but the nuttiest of image quality enthusiasts.  Bright sharp screen, great colors, good viewing angle.  As for the flaws, you really have to be paying attention to notice them.  I suppose the most noticeable one is that on the left and right sides of the panel, the display is a bit darker, it's just on the very edge, so you won't be looking there most of the time, therefore, not that big a deal.  As for the banding issue, it's there, but it's a very subtle effect, and it's noticeable on some content more than others and doesn't detract from my enjoyment significantly.  There's also a very subtle issue that I suppose is only really noticeable when you're relatively close to the screen, i'm not sure if it's the way the pixels are arranged on the panel, or the way the panel processes images, but it manifests as being perceived as an uneven arrangement of pixels, most noticeable on high contrast areas along straight lines.  The viewing angles are great, but not as great as on my samsung, but the vast majority of the time this is not noticeable.I suppose if whether or not you choose this tv it depends on your priorities, if you're more of an image quality nut, then you might want to see samsung's or sony's offerings.  If you're more of a gamer, I'd definately recommend this tv over anything else out there.So in short, it's great for all my needs.

This TV has been fabulous and I don't regret buying it for a second.  The picture clarity and the pop of the colors is unparalleled.  Even in the store I noticed that the picture jumped out compared to the rest of the screens, including the Samsung TVs that I was comparing it most closely.  The 4ms refresh rate makes watching HD sports an absolute pleasure.  The box itself is a thing of beauty and spectacular engineering, the built-in speaker sound is more than adequate for regular TV viewing, and I find the remote to be sufficiently solid and intuitive.  If I had to make a complaint, I suppose that having the third HDMI port on the side of the TV is a little less useful that just having it in the back with the rest of them, but I haven't used it much.  Also, my Sharp Blu-Ray player (which I received for free with the TV) is less of a quality product, but it syncs up easily with the TV.  I'd probably get a Playstation 3 instead if I were purchasing from scratch, but hey, it was free so I can't complain (too much).  I also don't know how well the wall-hanging function works as I have it on the stand, but it is spectacularly thin so I would imagine that it would look great on a wall as well.Finally, I can't attest to the quality of Sharp's customer service, nor of the various vendors that Amazon lists, but I can say without reservation that the machine itself works wonders.
