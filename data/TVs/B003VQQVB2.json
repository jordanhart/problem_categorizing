{"Reviews": [{"Title": "GREAT TV for the price!", "Author": "Jaz", "ReviewID": "ROI07B6SU8DWC", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "PRO: I bought this TV at my local Costco for $799 and it's a SMOKING deal. This TV has everything you could want in a TV. 4 HDMI hook up's, it's got a tiny thin profile (less than 2\"), 1080p, 120h, and is LED lit.I liked the LED-LCD tv's better than the LCD's because they are brighter and the colors show more detail especially when there are dark colors, you are able to view the contrast between blacks and grays.I shopped around a while before finding this item, looking at Samsung's, Sony's, and even some LG's. After looking online, at Fry's electronics, and Costco I decided this was the best deal for my $. I was looking towards a TV with internet capability but did not want to compromise on TV size or quality to do that. Maybe I'll get a converter for this one sometime, but at the moment...I do love my TV!One downside for all Vizio previous owners...the preset picture settings are not as many as on other Vizio models. I have another 47\" LCD in my house from Vizio and there are like 20 different picture settings, this one only has 4 or 5, but they do cover the main ones. There is a \"home\", \"game\", \"movie\", \"retail\" and \"photo\". I think the \"retail\" is the most like the \"vivid\" setting on my other TV and I like watching things with brilliant colors, otherwise it doesn't feel like hi-def anyways.Good TV if your on the fence....go look at Costco they have it on display, it's a beautiful TV :)CON: This model DOES NOT HAVE INTERNET! This is not correct, it has every other feature, minus the VIA internet apps. It is 1080p, 120h, and is an LED-LCD. But correction DOES NOT have wireless built in like this amazon post describes.", "Date": "November 17, 2010"}, {"Title": "Adaptive Lumina can be turned off!", "Author": "Greg Cisko", "ReviewID": "R195SSS79WQGEC", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Yes this TV does dim with adaptive lumina enabled. Anytime there is inactivity or a dim scene it will dim. To fix this you go to DISPLAY mode in the menu and select CUSTOM. It is here that you turn off Adaptive Lumina. I confirmed this fixed the problem in a scene in Iton Man II (where stark kisses pepper).That said, the picture is spectacular. It cannot be beaten for the price. So while Adaptive Lumina is an issue... If you stay in the CUSTOM display mode Adaptive Lumina will turn off. So I do not understand when I see reviews that say this is still an issue even with Adaptive Lumina off. Perhaps they are not staying in the CUSTOM display mode?Also if you have a Harmony universal remote, you need to program some of the keys in RAW mode to get them to act right. Mainly any of the input selects.The tuner on the TV is fine with an over the air antenna (OTA). It even pulls in channel 2-1 in chicago with no problems. I did see on review question the quality of the OTA tuner. But so far it is fine.I gave the FEATURES for this TV 3 stars because of Adaptive Lumnina. It is the same reason I gave the TV (as a whole) 4 stars instead of 5 - which it really deserves if it were not for Adaptive Lumina. So far Adaptive Lumina is not a deal breaker.", "Date": "November 29, 2010"}, {"Title": "Vizio M470VT: auto-dimming problem", "Author": "-=McE=-", "ReviewID": "R1MJVHFL5GPLB7", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "This t.v. has a feature called \"Adaptive Luma\" which claims to automatically decrease the brightness of the screen in response to changes in lighting in your room. However, my t.v. automatically darkens the screen whenever there is a dark scene onscreen, regardless of the darkness in my room. For example, when a scene is taking place at night, the screen automatically becomes so dark that you cannot see anything on screen at all; it is nearly pure black. This problem occurs even when Adaptive Luma is OFF. Having bright lights in my room failed to fix the problem, as well. Extremely disappointing; I have to return the t.v.", "Date": "November 24, 2010"}, {"Title": "Very happy with our Vizio purchase!", "Author": "Care Q T", "ReviewID": "R28AWVW6N6VL3E", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "We have had our Vizio set up for almost 48 hours....love it!

You would not believe how long I've been researching, trying to find the tv with the most features at a good price.  Needless to say, I am very pleased with the tv, as well as the purchase price.  The tv is outstanding.  My sons and I absolutely love it.  The remote control does it all.  The only thing I would change about the remote, is that I'd love for the buttons to be bigger.  :-)BTW . . .the day after placing my purchase, the tv's price had increased from $700 to $929.

Vizio LCD", "Author": "Mom of Four", "ReviewID": "RD2D7WREJOTEA", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "I have been in the market to upgrade our 3 year old 37 inch Vizio with a bigger model.  Finally, this weekend I broke down and bought the Vizio 47 inch LED LCD TV from a local warehouse.  Right out of the box, I had problems with it.  After tweaking the settings (including turning off the ambient light sensor) I was able to get the picture looking pretty good.  But then I noticed a significant buzzing noise coming from the base of the unit.  It was very prominent when it was on an input that was not receiving a signal and got a little quieter when a signal was coming in.  The buzzing was not loud, but definitely noticeable and something I knew would consistently bug me.  Because there have been so many poor reviews on that model, I decided to take it back in favor of another TV.  Back at the store, I could not pass up the less than $700 deal on the Vizio E470VL 47\" LCD.  Although the picture didn't look as good as some of the other models in the store (sony, samsung), I could not justify spending the extra money for the other sets.  After getting the new TV home and setting it up, I am glad I stuck with the Vizio!  The picture is awesome!  I think it looks better than the LED TV I took back!  The sound is good and it operates without any noise, buzzing, etc.  This is the 4th Vizio I have purchased and I will continue to purchase and recommend their products.", "Date": "February 6, 2011"}, {"Title": "Great Purchase", "Author": "Kay L.

It did a good job for me for a year.  Then every 12 months Ihad to purchase a new light for it at $214.00 from a resource that I had to research and find for myself. I did a lot of shopping, checking Consumer Reports etc. and amextremely happy with my new VIZIO TV purchase. I can even watch it without my glasses (couldn't before this). The picture isvery clear at any distance, front-left-or right side. The sound is quite good and easy to adjust and doesn't seem to have the big loud change during commercials. I am very satisfied with the product, the price allowed by Amazon and the fast delivery. The 2 young men could not get back my drive, so they brought it back on a dolly 1100 feet, which is about a 1/4 of a mile walking.  They were very pleasant as they unpackaged my prize and checked it to be sure there were no damages and plugged it in to make sure all was working fine.  I would surely purchase fromAmazon again in the future.", "Date": "January 2, 2011"}, {"Title": "A fix to 'dimming'  Also a Great TV and Great Price", "Author": "J.

There has been some questions about the \"dimming\" of the picture when it is first turned on but there is an easy fix.

I do plan on getting a nice soundbar, as the TV lacks low tones. The 1080i/p playback is phenomenal, the rest (480i) is average.I read others complain about the auto-dim feature, you can turn this off in the settings, I keep it off. I would have liked to get the vizio internet apps, but oh well. It's still a great price, got it for ~800 shipped the Monday after Thanksgiving. Beats any in store price I found at Best Buy or Walmart for LED-LCD TV's. It's very slim, but by no means the advertised 0.87\", I have no idea where they got this measurement, it's more like 2-3\". Maybe they just measure the rim? LED-LCD's have a bright picture, and use less electricity.

I was afraid of what all my low / standard def signals would look like on this as I have heard many complaints and seen terrible pic on high def systems.  The default settings are all very good and even my low def signals and VCR look as good as my old TV, DVD and High def are incredible.  Screen is not glossy and reduces glare dramatically compared to my old Analog TV.  Edge is glossy though I wish it had a flat black paint.  Tuner is great pulling the signals I needed hooked up to my roof antenna.Reviewers complained of the base mount that juts out after removing the base getting in the way of flush mount.  Just remove 5 small screws that hold it in place and it comes off leaving a nice flat back.  I removed it and then used two of the threaded holes to mount my Sony Sound bar to the TV using a small steel flat bar from hardware store.  Now it swivels along with the TV.Reviews complain of the ambient light sensor.  Mine works great so I leave it on.Only a few negatives1) a minor faint light leakage into the picture from the base and top corner of the screen but can only be seen at night and when the screen is black as between channels or scenes in space in star trek.2) Sound is terrible and even at high base low treble setting irritated my ears but fixed that with a sound bar.3)  The remote does not have a CC closed caption button which I like to use when I can not understand the dialog.  CC does not automatically come up when I mute as all my older TVs did.

I'm not an audiophile but I'm already looking into purchasing a sound-bar.
