I've essentially written the same review on Amazon and a few other vendors selling this product.  I \"still\" believe that it's a discontinued product because Toshiba is pushing it's 120 mghz product and has entered into a relationship with Sharp for future sets.  This may well be a \"good marriage\".  But from my perspective, I've had this set nearly two months now and have read the reviews and specs on it for several months previous to purchase.  The price now (well under $ 2,000) is an EXCELLENT buy...\"for now\".  The set is thin where it counts and HUGE where it counts!  People literally stop talking when an HDTV channel is on when viewing this set.  It's that good!  No banding.  No ghosting.  No \"blurring\" with fast action (tennis, golf, hockey, you name it).  Regular DVD replay is excellent and you have options to improve the picture quality of those DVDs, if you love movies!  Standard TV is good and more than watchable.  Just go to Best Buy or any other retail outlet and see any of the \"Regza\" Toshiba sets (which may soon be discontinued).  They truly outshine all the competition ... Sony, Samsung, Sharp, Phillips, et.al. Then you can SEE for yourself.  But if it were me, I'd buy this same set all over again.  You're going to pay a lot more and get a lot less otherwise, if you pass up this Toshiba line.", "Date": "June 3, 2008"}, {"Title": "REGZA", "Author": "Arthur J. Coombs", "ReviewID": "RYGIKTAAA7ZQT", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I recently purchased the REGZA 52RV530U LCD HDTV.  I am very happy with the performance and picture. The screen size is manually adjustable which I really like.  My Sharp Aquos adjusts automatically to the input it recieves. Overall the picture quality is excellent and I believe matches the higher price sets. Fast motion is in no way blurry and I can't see any blurring at all.Beautiful set I would highly recommend.", "Date": "July 15, 2008"}, {"Title": "Good only while warranty lasts. Avoid ALL Toshiba HDTVs!", "Author": "T. J. Taylor", "ReviewID": "R3HU2CGV68Y9M9", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I have owned this TV for a little over 2 years.  It was a great TV while it worked.  Recently the right 40% of the screen stopped working, with the image being replaced by a colorful kaleidoscope of vertical lines.  After confirming that the problem was with the TV and not the cables or signal source, I looked on the Internet and was surprised to find how frequent this problem is with 52\" Toshiba hdtvs of varying designations.  What is also consistent among the many people who have had problems is the lack of support from Toshiba.  I haven't bothered to try myself -- yet... I still might -- but it doesn't look good.  Obviously, this specific TV isn't for sale any more, thank goodness, but if you're looking at reviews to get a sense of Toshiba's track record, please buy from a different manufacturer - one who builds products that last longer than their warranties and that they stand buy.  Don't risk getting stuck with your very own Toshiba Lemon.", "Date": "November 20, 2011"}, {"Title": "Very Good, but not perfect", "Author": "R. Barton \"BIG Daddy\"", "ReviewID": "R3Q3DNNXBJA31Z", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I bought this to replace one of the Samsung 40\"ers I won playing poker (long story). I wanted BIGGER than the 40 and caught this at a good price early xmas eve, so most of my comparison is to the Samsung it replaced. The Good: Bigger is better, much deeper and richer blacks, does not blur with speed ie football game etc, better viewing angle, better anti glare, auto channel scan picks up much more channels and much faster, auto channel scan auto tunes both cable, digital and analog tv signals and locked them in with 1 sweep, deeper and more detailed menu and options. Lots of manual pic size adjustments, 4 hdmi inputs, remote passthru  The Bad (or not so good): Colors are not as bright or sharp. Colors are not as 'REAL' ie skin tone etc. Sound system mediocre even with SRS wow, eq and enhancements (I use a very hi end audio system for movies anyway) remote kinda clutery and not friendly and range not good, deep menu and manual also clutery and somewhat unfriendly, fixed stand does not swival, only 1 cable/antenna input, so it is not possible to hookup both a Cable line and an (hdtv) antenna, 1 side input port, but no front port. Lots of manual size and pic adjustments, but the Samsung had auto settings for most and did it very well.. (who wants to go through lots of menu stuff when going from a widescreen dvd to a regulaor dvd) Has a \"Game Mode\" but it really sucks compared to the Samsung's.  Overall I am happy and satisfied with my purchase. The picture comparison to my old Samsung is a wash. Blacks better on Toshiba, Colors better on Samsung, but Toshiba doesn't blur.  Features about the same, but Toshiba had more manual adj and samsung more automatic. Last, this TV looks good, but was not the best in the store. The store had approx 40 tv's going all same channel and all of the 120hz pics where better, but some of the normal Samsung and Sony pics where somewhat better. All the other cheaper or 'off' brands like LG Vizio etc clearly had a much worse pic. I purchased this because the pic was certainly good to very good and the price was right $1100 + tax.", "Date": "January 3, 2009"}, {"Title": "WORSE TV Errror", "Author": "Agron Sherifi", "ReviewID": "R2LENQI0OPDIOL", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I bought my TV 15 months ago.  I was happy with it till the last month.  It went out. No picture at all.  Called the 1-800 was told we can not do nothing you should of bought the extended warranty and was hung up on. Very rude all she kept repeating you should of bought the extended warranty.  Sorry a TV should not break that fast.  Called back spoke with a \"supervisor\" told them same thing and giving a toshiba repair shop to call. There is nothing they can do.  They would not do anything to help rude people all was told you should of gotten the extended warranty. Emailed them 15 times not one email was returned back.  Called the repair shop I was told its a COMMON Problem and they charge 300 bucks just to come out to look at it.  DO not buy Toshiba products worse customer service and quality ever.  A TV is not expected to break within 15 months.  Bought the TV at Electronic Expo and explained my situation they told me the same that why you should always get the extened warranety Toshiba is crap.", "Date": "October 8, 2010"}, {"Title": "Good Picture / bad service", "Author": "E.

Fortunately it was under warranty but I have been waiting over a month for a replacement screen.In reading various reviews on the Regza series of LCD sets, there seems to be a lot of problems connected to the screens that occur on or about the time the warranty is to expire.  I had been very happy with the performance of this set and the problem seemed to appear overnight. I had planned on requesting a replacement of the set itself but I am now having second thoughts.  I wonder if the newer XV and ZV series are any more reliable.  I would be curious to know how many more folks have had screen problems.", "Date": "August 28, 2009"}, {"Title": "Bad TV : Just trash it after 3 years", "Author": "Sindy", "ReviewID": "R2Z60HT9CBXE16", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "This TV was good for the past 3 years.

They told me that it's off warrantee and i had to pay for shipping to send TV to them to evaluate if it can be fixed ( i have to pay for the repair - of cause).  Then i have to pay 35 $ if i want technician to try to trouble shoot with me over the phone.. This is really bad.. I don't recommend this un reliable TV to any one.  I wish i pay a bit more for sumsung or sony (which is working very well and last a lotttttttttttttt longer).Bye bye toshiba, this is my first and last toshiba product..Note :i did some research and there are a lot of people who has the same problems with me.. this is worse TV we got..Don't buy TOSHIBA TV", "Date": "March 13, 2013"}, {"Title": "Quality Sucks", "Author": "Xi Zhang \"Lovecar\"", "ReviewID": "R1N6D9KRF5IDB3", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "My Toshiba LCD TV just broke after 18 months.
