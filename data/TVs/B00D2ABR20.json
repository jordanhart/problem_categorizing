{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Cheep TV", "Author": "Paul Fischer", "ReviewID": "R1PY3MI9IYMSLK", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "The TV works well but is limited to ajustments. I only gave it three stars because I tried to link my cabel box remote to the TV so I only have to use one remote and it will not work. I tried calling the cabel company and that did not help. They said I need to get the code from the manufacturer and that they do not know the code. I asked Contex and they said there is NO code numbers for it. So now I have to use two remotes or maybe a universal remote will work. We will see.... But for $299 dollers it is so far a good TV.", "Date": "July 16, 2013"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "$389.95", "Features": "Backlight Type:\tFull-array  LED\nBrightness: 300cd/m2\nDynamic Contrast Ratio: 5000 to 1\nViewable Angle (H/V):\t178\u00b0X 178\u00b0\nTV with stand (Width x Height x Depth): 35.67\" x 23.82\" x 8.26\" , TV without stand (Width x Height x Depth): 35.67\" x 21.57\" x 2.99\".", "Name": "Contex 39-inch 1080p LED TV (LE39D3)", "ImgURL": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41cbtdpTz7L._SX300_.jpg", "ProductID": "B00D2ABR20"}}
