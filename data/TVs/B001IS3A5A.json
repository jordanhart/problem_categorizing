{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Sweet HDTV LCD", "Author": "BBooDad", "ReviewID": "RGI9DN8N2S4KK", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Just got it today, so still trying it out, but very nice picture and works well.  Only reason I didn't give a 5-star is that the manual doesn't tell the specifications such as 720p or 1280p or whatever, and doesn't really explain the \"Pix Shape\" options.  Also our Dish Satellite controller can't turn it on or off or adjust volume.  But picture quality is great, and the Pix Shape button gave us Harry Potter in all it's wide-screen glory from the top to bottom of the screen, instead of the black bars that it had top and bottom to start with.Big plus:  $100 cheaper and better picture than Sony Bravia 32\" when I compared them on the same wall at Walmart.", "Date": "November 11, 2008"}, {"Title": "Bad sound, can't handle darkness at all.", "Author": "Foohy", "ReviewID": "R2S34431XI51VI", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "First off, this TV has a decent picture when watching something with a nice daytime and bright colors. That, combined with the reasonable price, is what lulled me into buying it in the first place. I was satisfied with my purchase for the first few days, but then I decided to play Uncharted on my PS3 and boy was I in for a shock!I got to a section of the game where you go underground and everything is dark and lit only by torches. I couldn't see anything. I could see fine with my 10-year-old CRT SDTV, but not this. I even, grasping at straws, decided to watch some TV and see if it was the game that had problems--nope. I tried to watch Stargate Universe (a show with very dark scenes) and it was the same story.Darkness is not it's only problem, though. The speakers aren't very good at all. Loud sounds have a sort of 'nails-on-a-chalkboard' effect due to a lack of bass. I watched Gamer using this TV and each explosion was mildly cringe-worthy. I got used to it after a few days, but I still notice it. And it's rather annoying.Also, as a side note, the option to set the contrast does not seem to work for me. I have turned it all the way up then all the way down and notice no difference.I do not recommend this TV at all. It was a waste of my money and will be a waste of yours too if you have any standards whatsoever.", "Date": "September 11, 2010"}, {"Title": "Great for the price", "Author": "Michael Hambrick", "ReviewID": "R3RG7HBMMRHDGB", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I dont have this exact model but they are very similar. I just bought this the other day and so far I really like it. The tv shows dont look a whole lot better but that is probably because I dont have HD channels. I do have both my Xbox 360 and PS3 hooked up via HDMI cables and they both look great running at 720p. For the price it is a great buy for any gamer and any one with HD channels.", "Date": "October 3, 2009"}, {"Title": "Worked for a year, 2nd try for inverter", "Author": "J. Howard \"unknownsoldier1\"", "ReviewID": "RQWUAI5DF1OYP", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "Very disappointed in this, and became more so over time. Worked OK for a year, but the blacks and colors are muddy. (I reserve one star for completely useless). The inverter on the Sanyo seems to fail with regularity (for me and others). TV's (including these) should last years, but this is used constantly (8 hours a day). These are 720p scan, and better TV's are on the market. Skip buying this, and thank yourself for buying the warranty.", "Date": "December 17, 2008"}, {"Title": "Excellent for this price!", "Author": "Always Good Deal", "ReviewID": "R2FJMGRKMDU9ZD", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Sweet deal, great sound and vivid color!
