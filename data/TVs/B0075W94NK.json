{"Reviews": [{"Title": "TV is decent for the price but poor sound and worse customer service", "Author": "Teresa Federigi", "ReviewID": "R1A82ZX926FFN6", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "I purchased this TV about 6 months ago, the picture is nice, but the sound is very low, I purchased a power amplifier to increase the sound. I had it just under 3 months when it completely died, wouldn't power up.  It had a 90 day warranty that requires you to pay for shipping to be repaired and also requires you to send a $25 money order for return shipping if you want it repaired, or replaced.  I would never have bought it if I knew I had to pay for a defective product. I finally received the repaired TV between 4 and 5 weeks later, I hope it doesn't die again because I'm not blowing another $50 for it.", "Date": "September 12, 2012"}, {"Title": "Great TV! Can change picture size & sound of audio.", "Author": "metaluna00 \"Kim\"", "ReviewID": "R2GVQIVGDW2NXL", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Maybe the other reviewers didn't know you can change the sound of the audio on the menu button from the remote. I like the sound of \"news\" which is very clear. Treble, bass and balance are on the menu including home theatre, custom and music. You can also change the size of video on your screen. Mine is in my small home office and is the perfect size for a small room. The remote is very light-weight which is surprising since it's 9\" in height and 2\" wide. DPI is important and this has the highest pixels available. I'm looking forward to watching DVD concerts on it. Re: high def - we have it and I can't tell the difference in that and regular cable TV but my husband says he can. We think it's a great TV and are pleased with the quality.", "Date": "March 12, 2013"}, {"Title": "Very poor image for DVD", "Author": "Leo", "ReviewID": "R13MX5FMJ8A0GR", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "We didn't open the box until Christmas (Month after ordering).  We were not very impressed with the picture of the TV image and the slow response of the remote.  We became very disappointed when we finally put in a DVD.  The screen image is shadowed by red and blue lines across the screen.  The image is horrible.  Being busy through the holiday and then having to leave town on a business trip I now have to investigate options for returning the unit.", "Date": "January 14, 2013"}, {"Title": "All in 1  Nice HDTV/DVD/SD Card /USB reader/PC Monitor/ etc..........", "Author": "Mr Mike \"MikNas\"", "ReviewID": "R1SY87X8HN9FRN", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "This TV does it all in one unit.

It takes much longer than usual for the tv to respond to the remote control. Pictures are ok, but not that great. I thought the item is little pricey comparing to the feature and quality provided. I would look for a cheaper product with better quality next time.

It has enough outputs so that you could use it as a TV, console monitor, computer monitor and picture frame all at once.
