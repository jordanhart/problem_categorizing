When I tried to stream shows from my computer to this t.v, I got video but no audio.Most of the instruction manual and cd is dedicated to the EzSign computer setup.  This t.v. is basically for businesses so they can run their advertisements (EzSign),and not home use.I get better video and audio from my Olevia t.v.", "Date": "February 11, 2013"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "Unavailable", "Features": "TV Type: LED\nScreen Size Class: 37\"\nVertical Resolution: 1080p\nMaximum Resolution: 1920 x 1080\nScreen Refresh Rate: 60Hz", "Name": "LG EzSign 37LT560E 37 1080p LED-LCD TV - 16:9 - HDTV 1080p", "ImgURL": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/517rJxUNUZL._SY300_.jpg", "ProductID": "B007ZT1P6M"}}
