Excellent buy for the price.", "Date": "November 7, 2012"}, {"Title": "Will not work with the BOSE SOLO Speaker System", "Author": "Ray D. Ator", "ReviewID": "RCDJ5X6EJ22J4", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I was loaned this TV while my Sony TV was in the shop. The first thing I needed to do was to hook up the Samsung to my BOSE SOLO sound system so I could enjoy the sound instead of listening to the tinny little speakers that come with the Samsung. However, Samsung did not include a port on the back for either an optical digital audio cable nor a coaxial digital audio cable! They did provide a port for an analog stereo audio cable but come on, it's 2013, not 1973!So I hooked up a set of analog stereo audio cables (that have the old style RCA plugs at each end) but the TV did not play through them because there is no way to turn off the built-in stereo speakers. There was also no way to turn on the audio out jacks on the back of the Samsung TV set. They forgot to add this option to the on-screen menu that allows the user to customize their TV viewing the way they want.Then I contacted Samsung technical support. They told me that this model TV does not have an output port and so it cannot be connected to any external speakers at all.All I know is that in the future I will not even consider looking at a Samsung TV. I know that people loved these TVs in children's bedrooms or as a monitor for their X-BOXes, but that shows the limitations of these units.", "Date": "June 18, 2013"}, {"Title": "Great tv", "Author": "Z bro", "ReviewID": "R3F69Y2D76DP9Q", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Samsung is at it again with thier great televisions.  The picture is awesome.  I have it connected to a ps3 and games and blurays are awesome.  The sound isnt the best but what do you expect from a tv without a reciecer connected to it.  I have it mouted and it is perfect.  Bought It through the warehouse as I do a lot woth no problems whatsoever.  I also like the nice buttons it has. They are not actuals buttons that you push. You just swipe your finger past it amd it works..  great for am extra room bedroom or kitchen..", "Date": "January 17, 2013"}, {"Title": "Great TV", "Author": "Russell E.
