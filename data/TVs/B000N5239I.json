{"Reviews": [{"Title": "More Than Just Another Pretty Picture", "Author": "Scipio", "ReviewID": "RYAX584G69IWB", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I've already learned one important lesson in my limited experience with HDTVs - it's not all about the picture.  In the case of this unit, the picture quality was very comparable to the 23\" Sony Bravia HDTV I had recently bought (slight pluses and minuses for both), but the Samsung is far more well thought-out and user-friendly.  I'm really surprised at how big of a difference that makes, but it does.This TV will change channels fairly quickly (about the speed of a non-HDTV), whereas the Sony Bravias (and I assume others) are painfully S-L-O-W.  This was irritating enough when I was just using the relatively small number of over-the-air channels, with cable it can drive you absolutely crazy.Also, the Samsung will sense what inputs are actually being used, so that it will only go to the ones that are hooked up to a VCR, DVD, etc. and not S-L-O-W-L-Y cycle through them all, as does the Bravia (where it's a real drag if you hit that button by mistake).Another nice feature is that the LNT2653H has separate coax inputs for antenna and cable.  If you, like me, want to use both, this makes life much easier.There are actually a few other smaller items that are superior on the Samsung as well, but the real epiphany to me was that usability is so significant an issue in these HDTVs.  Don't get me wrong, picture quality IS important too and this one looks to me as good as any, but you can't really judge that aspect very well in a showroom anyway.  Once you get it home you have to actually use it - and the differences there are striking.I'll also mention that, at the time of purchase, the price at Amazon was significantly better than at any other reputable dealer I could find.  The unit came quickly and in good shape.I'll give it 4 1/2 stars, because as good as it is, it's still not perfect.", "Date": "May 8, 2007"}, {"Title": "A top notch HDTV for its size and price point", "Author": "Greg A. Neitzert", "ReviewID": "R2QZAZUVCB4WXQ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I'm a very picky electronics consumer.  I spent a lot of time researching HDTV trying to find the best value and features in a television for our bedroom.  Picture quality, technical specs, and motion handling were all very important considerations.  The Samsung LNT2653H 26\" LCD HDTV has exceeded all of my expectations.1.  HDTV - The picture quality with HDTV signals is astounding.  No big surprise here.  Samsung is known for great picture quality and this display does not disappoint.  Its unfortunate there are so many variations (720p, 1080i, etc) but this is not the fault of this TV or Samsung.  It just means - as with most of these TV's - you are constantly adjusting the screen size to fill the screen or putting up with bars.  Thankfully, this TV has a picture size button on the remote so you can quickly toggle between settings.This TV has a QAM tuner, which is the standard being used by cable companies for digital cable signals.  During the auto channel search, the TV found all of the unscrambled HDTV channels being passed by the cable company.  I'm not a digital cable subscriber, but our cable company, like many pass many HDTV channels 'in the clear' through the cable - even though most won't tell you this and don't advertise it.  This means if you can decode HDTV channels with a tuner (which this TV can) you can get the local channels (but not the subscription channels like ESPN, HDNET, FSN HD, etc) for no additional cost.  You might be pleasantly surprised when you do a auto channel search and you find some local HDTV channels being sent by your cable company.  With the QAM tuner, this TV can actually find and work with the digital cable.  However, the cable company scrambles the subscription digital channels and while this TV could display them (if they weren't scrambled), most cable companies will still require you to get their set top box.  But at least with the QAM tuner you can get the 'in the clear' HDTV channels the cable company is probably passing to you.Since this TV has a second RF input (the Amazon summary says only one but it is incorrect - see the Samsung website or the pictures for confirmation), you can also use the second RF (air) input to get your local HD channels if available in your area.  This TV has a built in ATSC tuner, so it can decode over the air HDTV signals - but you still need an antenna to pick them up.  I live in a city and can get several OTA (over the air) HDTV stations with my attached Terk HDTVi antenna.  However, since the cable company is sending the signals through the cable as well, I don't have to use it unless the cable is out. The second RF input is nice to have and a disappearing option on many HDTVs.  If you have cable, you may want to wait to see if the TV finds 'in the clear' HDTV locals being passed by your cable company before buying an antenna - you may not even need one.  Of course, if you are going to subscribe to digital cable with a HDTV package, you really don't need the antenna.The great thing about the 'in the clear' signals from the cable company is that they are strong and don't require you to move an antenna around to get different channels.  If you upgrade to digital cable with a HDTV package, you can get the subscription based HDTV channels in addition to the free locals.The TV has a built in digital signal meter, which will display a bar showing how strong your digital signal is.  This is useful if you have an over the air antenna for HD and you are trying to find the best reception.  Bring up the meter while on a digital (HD) channel and adjust the antenna to find the strongest signal.  Remember you might have to move the antenna to get different stations depending on your orientation to various towers.  Again, if your cable company sends 'in the clear' locals or you have the HD package with digital cable, this isn't an issue.With those stations, moving the antenna makes no difference because the HD signal is coming from the RF (coax) from the cable signal and its strength remains constant.2.  Standard definition/cable signals - Since most channels are still standard definition, how a TV displays them is vitally important.  Its not good enough to be great with HDTV if the standard picture is horrible.  This TV does a very good job with standard/cable signals in my opinion.  Many HDTV sets do a crummy job with analog signals.  This TV does some 'upconversion' and cleaning up of the image.  The result is that our standard cable channels look quite nice.  Of course the quality really varies depending on what your starting with, but I have to say the standard signal without question looks nicer on this TV than on the old tube TV.3.  Style and Size - For those who care about this, this is a really sleek looking TV.  Its got a glossy jet black (\"Grand Piano\") finish.  Its also very light (20 pounds).  This thing is lighter than the 19\" tube TV it replaced.4.  The 'hiss' problem - Many reviewers have noted a hiss problem.  I'm sensitive to this, my old TV had a hum/hiss that drove me crazy.  It had a flaky tuner which was causing it.  Our Samsung LCD panel is making no noise at all.  It was manufactured May 2007.  We've had no problems with this, even with the backlight turned all the way up.5.  Motion handling/blur/response time - The 'lag' time 'refreshing' the display has been historically the achilles heel of LCD TV.  This TV quotes a fast response time (8 ms).  While this number is important, you have to be careful because various manufacturers use different measures and the number they provide isn't nearly as important as what you actually see.  On older LCD TVs and even some newer LCD panels that quote faster response times, the display suffers from a blurring/distorting when the images are moving quickly - for example sports and fast action.  On 'no name' LCD panels, I noticed they really struggled to keep up with faster action sequences - EVEN IF they claimed a fast response time.  I watch a lot of hockey and the blurring on some of the panels during the action was unacceptable.  I've watched some football, baseball, and other fast moving action on this TV and it suffers very little from blurring.  I put in a few of my NHL DVDs and they looked fine as well.  While I can't say its 100% perfect, it is VERY good and isn't really an issue.6.  Picture control - This TV has countless picture control options so you can adjust the picture how you like it.  Its very flexible.Make sure to go through the manual and try out the countless settings you can tweak - picture mode (dynamic, movie, natural), white balance, noise reduction, etc.  The picture can change quite significantly depending on these settings and go with what you like.  How you set it up is a pretty individual taste thing.  I tried to use some signals from TV and DVD that had 'known' color patterns I could use as a baseline to get things tweaked how I liked it.7.  Input/outputs - This TV has various inputs and outputs ranging from composite A/V all the way up to DVI for high def sources, so its very flexible.  I have a progressive scan DVD player connected via component cables and the picture is awesome.8.  Value for the money - With this price, you'll be hard pressed to find a comparable TV with the quality and features at this price point.  If you want an affordable way to dabble into HDTV or a nice TV for your bedroom, this is a great choice.9.  Sound - The small speakers actually do a surprisingly good job.  Of course if you want serious sound, you need to connect to a good receiver.  In our bedroom this isn't an issue, and the built in speakers coupled with its virtual surround modes do a fine job.10.  Changing channels - Switching channels is very fast with this TV.  Many of these digital televisions do it slowly.  This is one of the faster ones I've tried.  This is nice, because the lag time on many of the televisions is annoying.  It sounds so mundane, but little things such as this can make all the difference.  The TV also has a 'Favorite channels' button on the remote.  You can flag any number of channels as 'favorites'.  Then, by pressing the \"Fav Ch\" button on the remote, you can jump from one favorite to another, skipping over the rest of the channels.  This is nice if you get annoyed flipping through countless stations you rarely watch.The only cons I would point out are pretty minor:1.  TV takes a handful of seconds to turn on.  This isn't that uncommon with these types of TV's, it probably takes 5-10 seconds.2.  Zoom mode overstretches some HD signals when not connected via DVI.  When you use the picture mode toggle button on the remote, depending on the input format (720, 1080, etc) the zoom mode can overstretch the picture and parts of the picture are cut off.  The TV has a 'just scan' feature but this only fully works with DVI input signals.  The result is that if you wish to have the picture always fill the screen (no bars) you have to switch the picture zoom mode from one channel to another depending on its starting signal input and resolution.  Kind of annoying, but until (if ever) we get one standard HD signal and resolution, this is the way it is.All in all, this is a very impressive TV and an incredible value at the price point its offered at by Amazon.  In addition, Samsung has a great reputation in this area and Consumer Reports recently noted Samsung as one of the best LCD TV manufacturers.  Great buy.", "Date": "August 14, 2007"}, {"Title": "High Pitched Noise Gives it 2 Stars", "Author": "Kevin Lowe \"Hawk00Eyed\"", "ReviewID": "R3PV676D08K83E", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "I have had the same exact problems as CJ.  The first one I ordered developed a very high pitched noise that was very noticeable.  It disappeared when the backlight setting was turned down to 5 or less, but above that the noise was not acceptable.  I called Samsung and they acknowledged that this was a defective product, so I returned it to Amazon for a replacement.  This 2nd product had the same exact problem.  Seeing as how no one else had reported this problem on Amazon or elsewhere, I decided to try my luck with a third one, but this third one had the same problem.  I too tried different outlets, and also even tried taking it to a friend's house to test if it might be my house's wiring, but it still made the noise.  I am going to return it, unfortunately 3 times can't be a coincidence.  Its too bad, because Amazon has the best price on this product, plus no tax and free 1 day shipping with Prime.If it were not for the noise, however, I would give this product 5 stars for its design and quality of picture.", "Date": "June 2, 2007"}, {"Title": "Great TV plagued by high pitched noise...", "Author": "Tony", "ReviewID": "R3D9NQCMEOK45E", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "Despite reading reviews about the high pitched noise, I figured that those instances were isolated.  However, I got my May 2007 manufactured set in late August and it has the same high pitched noise problem too.  This noise becomes increasingly distinctive when raising the backlight level.The backlight functions similarly to the brightness, but it works differently via illumination and doesn't modify the picture per se.  There are ten levels that correlate to how bright the backlight in the monitor is.  At level 6 (which another reviewer mentioned was a service desk's suggestion for a coverup that I find to be a lazy solution), the noise doesn't exist.  I hear noise at levels 7 and 8, but I can tolerate  it with a decent volume.  Level 9 was hit-and-miss where the noise is more noticeable with certain channels but not others.  Either way, I can hear it in my bedroom and it becomes quite evident at close range.  At level 10, look out!  Even with the volume up to a slightly loud level, I can hear the high pitched whine.  The picture quality itself isn't diminished when lowering the backlight settings; the lowered backlight setting merely results in less of the illumination effect that bolsters the image.  One shouldn't be as concerned about things getting blurry.Though Amazon has a nice return policy, I'm hesitant in shipping an entire TV back for another defective set.  So, I'm leaning towards keeping the backlight level between 6-8 and cranking the brightness setting up a little to compensate.  I won't get the benefits of backlight lighting as much, but I'm fine with that.  I might look into the suggestion of hooking up external speakers to help with the noise.It's a shame that such a pronounced problem affects this particular set for multiple people.  If it weren't for that noise, I would have rated this set with five stars.  I suppose that I could have rated this set four stars, but that would have implied good quality when I don't believe that anything with such a glaring defect for multiple people warrants a \"good\" rating.  I did mean to rate this 3.5 stars if possible.Aside from the noise, the picture is vibrant, my Wii graphics looks great despite the console's limited 480p capabilities, and there is a plethora of connection options from USB, HDMI, PC, component, and even the old composite/S-video combo.  Hooking up my computer to the TV is very convenient and turns this TV into a high quality monitor. The cabinet is good looking, the sound is decent despite the small speakers.  The remote isn't the most responsive I've had and it takes a while for the TV to turn on after pushing power, but those points are just nitpicking.Bottom Line:  This is a great set if you can live with the noise.  Apparently, that noise seems to be more pervasive than I thought.", "Date": "August 31, 2007"}, {"Title": "Great!", "Author": "The Black Vegetable", "ReviewID": "RLY4UBM9PM9V", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I did a lot of research before buying and I thought this was the best deal for the price.

Dual HDMI inputs allow both a hi-def DVD player and hi-def satellite receiver to be hooked up in minutes with very few cables.  The onscreen setup and usage is pretty intuitive and did not require reading any instructions first.

Unfortunately ALL the 26 inch Samsung sets make this high pitch noise.  You will be in for a difficult time if you think it is not an issue because you do not hear the noise or think it does not bother you.  Many years ago when in college taking electronics a professor told us of how a student once connected a small speaker to the frequency generator that were on everyone's shop bench in the classroom.  It would then produce a high pitch noise (similar to the one all these Samsung sets make) and no one would even hear it.  After a few minutes though, people would start to feel uncomfortable and irritable.  The high pitched noise IS very discomforting even if you do not hear it.  When the professor saw everyone starting to loose attention and moving uncomfortably, he asked who the wise guy was and the guilty one laughed and turned off the noise.  Unfortunately with this Samsung LCD TV you can not turn off the noise and you will feel uncomfortable being exposed to it anytime the set is on.  I returned my Samsung set to Amazon that fortunately has a great return policy.

I contacted Samsung and they had me send it to NJ for repairs. Well, I got the set back from NJ today (after almost 3 weeks) and it doesn't even look like the same set.

My brand new tv (barely 3 months old) that left here without a mark or scratch on it, was covered in scratches, back and front.Further unpacking revealed a 1\" diameter hole in the front left corner that was broken out of the set along with pieces of plasitc that just fell out of the packing. I was also completely missing the oval base plate that I originaly sent.  I contacted Samsung again and they said to return it once again to the repair shop in NJ to see what they had to say about it ?

Right now Im runnind regular Definition DIRECTV and DVD Player and the image quality is pretty good although I had one surprise that I did not realize. When running regular defenition the picture is stretched to fit the screen and images do look a little strange. The TV offers two ways of fixing this: a) change the screen size to 4:3 aspect and make your 26\" TV into a 20\" TV as black bars appear on the sides to correct aspect ratio. This is fine if you want a smaller picture I guess but if you are watching widescreen not only do you get black bars on side, but of course on top and bottom and the picture just became 13\" which I find incredibly irritating. B)The TV has a feature called WIDEFIT, which stretches picture to widescreen the corrects the picture but this ONLY WORKS if you are running the signal through HDMI output.

When I checked with Samsung, I discovered on their FAQ that their LCD TVs are subject to screen burn in:  \"In general, you should avoid keeping a static picture (that is, a picture that contains no or few moving elements) or a picture with static elements (black bars, black borders, logos, etc.) on your LCD TV for more than two hours at a time. If, for example, you have your TV set to 4:3, and have black borders on the top and bottom, or on the sides, changing the picture size for a minute or two every couple of hours, say during commercials or in between shows, would decrease the chance of screen burn in. Reducing the brightness and contrast of the screen when it is displaying static elements will also decrease the chance of burn in.\" So watching a long movie without changing the aspect ratio is enough to cause burn-in.

I had some challenges finding the correct settings on the TV and Direct TV DVR to make sure *most* broadcasts appear undistorted to fit the wide screen. I say most because sometimes programs are stretched to fit widescreen by the broadcaster, not by the equipment. As a rule, however, most things look correct, and either fill the screen, or \"bars\" are placed on the sides by the broadcaster or by the DVR unit. Make sure to set \"native/original format\" and to choose the widescreen ratio in your DirectTV receiver, then things will work fine. I also set the Samsung to automatically sense the right size rather than force one mode or another. I haven't heard any whining or humming from my unit, as some people have reported.

I called Samsung and they told me they have heard about this problem with there DLP TV that contain a colorwheel, but this product doesn't  contain a colorwheel. Samsung looked into it further and said it may be a defective powersaver (not sure what that is.)They were also vague with letting me know if there were many similar calls with this problem.  I returned the TV back to amazon (amazing customer service) and exchanged it for another one, thinking I had bad luck because I hear nothing but good news about this TV.

This TV will not work with a PC with DVI. Only the 2007 Samsungs will.The FAQ at the Samsung website says:If you have a 2007 Samsung LN-T LCD TV and it has more than one HDMI jack, you can use the HDMI 1 input jack to connect to your computer's DVI video output jack using a DVI to HDMI cable.No Samsung LCD TV built before 2007 (LN-S series, LN-R series, LT-P series, etc.) has a DVI input for a computer. All models built before 2007, however, have an analog, 15 pin D-Sub (RGB) computer input.Important: Many of Samsung models built before 2007 have a combined HDMI/DVI input jack. You cannot use this combined HDMI/DVI jack to connect your pre-2007 Samsung TV to your computer's DVI video output jack. Samsung TVs built before 2007 do not support DVI to HDMI computer video connections.HTH", "Date": "October 5, 2007"}, {"Title": "Item and Service was Great but someone stoll my Visa card Number", "Author": "Alfred Hellman", "ReviewID": "RRUFKE2IQ2S7E", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "The transaction to purchase and delivery was very good, however someone got thru your 'secure system\" and stoll my credit card number and bought $8400.00 worth of jewlery in London,U.K.Since this was my only purchase on the internet, I don't know any other way that this could have occurred.", "Date": "July 7, 2007"}, {"Title": "Samsung 26\" LCD TV", "Author": "sugar \"George\"", "ReviewID": "RTEAAHUXAMV7F", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "TV is probably a very good product but I was working with a height limit.

Got those.So outside of no wall mount and very snowy reception, it's great. Um... huh? I gave it the one star because it looks good when it's turned off.I guess I should point out that I pretty much detest the wide screen format anyway. I rarely watch dvd's so staring at tv shows with the people all stretched out and distorted doesn't really work for me. Yes, you can adjust it for standard screen, but then you've just paid a fortune for, in this case, a 26\" tv and you get to watch a 18\" tv. Wheeee!
