{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Excellent entry level 3D TV", "Author": "TJ", "ReviewID": "R2KFO173W0WPDT", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I've had this TV for more than a week and spent some time playing with it and have watched different TV shows, several movies, both 2D and 3D. I think I now have a pretty good idea about how this TV performs.First of all, let me start with a brief summary of pros and cons:**Pros:- Inexpensive- Pretty good looking- 3D- Many advanced controls for tweaking picture quality, ISF calibration ready, as LG put it. This is a huge plus for an entry level TV- Excellent picture quality and color accuracy, especially after being properly calibrated- Low power consumption for a plasma TV, has built-in smart power-saving feature. After being calibrated, it's less than 100 watts in 2D mode which is very low for a plasma TV and within the territory of LCD TVs.**Cons:- Only 720p. This actually doesn't bother me because I hardly notice any difference in picture quality compared to my 1080p TV unless I get very close, something like 2-3 feet or so.- A small annoying issue I found when I tried to calibrate the TV. No big deal but still annoying. I will explain later.- Looks like a mirror. This is actually a problem for all plasma TVs, the technology itself. If your room is not dark enough, or the TV is facing a window, the reflection can be pretty bad. High end plasma TVs have some sort of filter or something like that to reduce reflection but they cost a lot more. If your room is pretty bright, get ready to buy a dark curtain.Now let me go into some more details of my calibration process and how this TV performs.In fact, the TV has very good color and gray scale accuracy in \"Cinema\" picture mode. I used my colorimeter, downloaded a free copy of ColorHCFR calibration software and AVS HD 709 calibration pattern disc to test the colors and gray scales. I found Cinema mode has good gamma, color temperature, and luminance accuracy. It's not perfect, but it's not too far off. The contrast should be a little higher but for an out-of-the-box mode, it's very good. If anyone doesn't bother with calibration, just switch it to Cinema mode and increase the contrast a little bit, and it's good to go.For those who are interested in more advanced calibration, the TV does come with 2 advanced picture modes called \"expert 1\" and \"expert 2\" with small \"ISF\" logos. These two modes have all you need for advanced calibration, either by an ISF-certified professional or do it yourself (Although I dig into these \"expert\" modes, I'm not an \"expert\", not even close BTW). Go deep into one of these two \"expert\" modes, you can adjust individual RGB channels (both Contrast and Brightness), turn on color filters for adjusting color saturation and hue. The TV even has 20-point gray scale curve controls. Although this can be hard to use, it allows much more accurate gray scale adjustment. You also find primary and secondary color controls for CMS (Color Management System), which are rarely found in entry level or even mid-range TVs.I spent a few hours playing with these advanced controls and the results were amazing. The luminance, gamma, color temperature curves were all very close to the targets with very low deltaE values. Of course they are not as low as what I can get with my graphic monitor, but those numbers and graphs are excellent for a TV. After calibration, the colors look natural and smooth, the skin tones look great. 3D movies look great as well. I did notice some crosstalk/ghosting in some dark scenes but it looks like this problem depends on the content as well. I saw very little ghosting when watching Tangled 3D, almost no problem with the Ultimate Wave: Tahiti 3D and a little more in Shrek 1 and 2 3D.However, this was also where I found an annoying issue as I previously mentioned. The picture modes seem to work independently in different viewing modes like TV and Blu-ray. I have a blu-ray player connected to one of the HDMI ports. All my calibration was done in this viewing mode with the use of my blu-ray player. After everything was set and I achieved my desired results, There's no way to apply the calibrated parameters to all inputs. I calibrated the \"expert 1\" profile (in blu-ray viewing mode) and \"expert 1\" in TV mode doesn't have the same parameters, it actually doesn't change at all. I had to manually copy the numbers to my notes and transfer them one by one. I found this very annoying even though it's not a big deal and I could get around it. But it's very strange.Another issue I found pretty odd is the \"expert\" picture profiles are disabled in 3D view mode. So all your calibrated results have no meaning if you're watching 3D movies. I understand that all energy saving features are disabled in 3D mode but the calibrated profiles are gone too? Very odd indeed. Fortunately, the \"Cinema\" picture profile still works and as I said, it does a good job.This TV doesn't have any internet streaming service but who really needs it because if you buy a 3D TV, it's almost certain that you have or will have a 3D Blu-ray player and all 3D Blu-ray players have internet streaming capability. Why we need to pay more for a similar feature in a TV as well?In summary, Although this TV is certainly NOT among the best out there, not even close; It is an excellent TV, especially for the money. Having a lot of advanced picture controls is a huge plus. Excellent picture quality for the money. Despite some annoying but minor issues I found, I still give this TV 5 stars for its quality and value.", "Date": "May 16, 2011"}, {"Title": "WAS Absolutely Awesome! - UH OH!", "Author": "Erich3isAwesome", "ReviewID": "R3P7W2O9J2EA0Z", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "This TV is amazing, I highly recommend it. Great quality construction/design, great quality sound, great quality picture. What more can you ask for? Thanks LG!UPDATE:Haha So, the above post was when I originally bought my TV (2 months ago). Well, I have had it hung on a wall since purchased and everything has been awesome. Well, today after having the TV on for about an hour it made a loud \"POP\" noise and shut off. It won't turn back on. Boooo LG. It's 2 months old and died. I keep a very clean living space so I know dust is not the issue, I keep the temperature around 74-76 degrees. So, I can only sum it up to faulty hardware? Maybe this particular TV is the only one with this issue, I don't know. But, \"Life's Good\"? Now, \"Looked Good\".Amazon will not refund the purchase amount because I am outside the 30 day return window.Thanks again LG!! :)", "Date": "May 22, 2011"}, {"Title": "3D Awesomeness Ensues", "Author": "Will", "ReviewID": "RXT5ZZKGU3DE5", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "NEW EDIT (1/20/2012)PROS:Cheap 3D plasma TVGreat Calibration options for greyscaleGood Calibration options for primary/secondary colorsDecent picture (really good for the price point)Good 3DThin and attractive looking tvCONS:-1024 X 768 resolution (note:  this technically falls under 720p but normal 16:9 720p is 1280 X 720 which is 921,600 pixels which are 1:1 or square shaped, the 1024 X 768 is more commonly found in PCs, it's 786,432 pixels that are 4:3 shaped) this is usually for 4:3 televisions/monitors.  So the 720p here is actually a lower resolution 720p than that found in most 720p HDTVs (ie, has fewer pixels).-black levels not really great for a plasma set, comparable to other budget tvs-Energy saving modes are terrible-image retention may annoy some or scare some folks- 3D glasses, LG glasses have a 10 minute aauto-shutoff so most people have to resynch a few times during a movie (not a big deal, you just push a button on the glasses)Everything still works fine and I am not easy on my electronics.  The tv is on for 8+ hours at a time, used for all day gaming sessions, I smoke in my apartment too.  Just a few quick updates.This plasma display does show quite a bit of image retention.  This is NOT the same as burn-in.  Burn in is permanent, image retention is just an afterglow of phosphors.  The image retention goes away pretty fast, isn't very noticeable unless there is a black or white field.  Anyone using this set should set the image retention protection to orbit/orbiter/orbital (not 100% sure what they call it), this is far better than the normal setting.  Also note that if you change this to white wash or the color wash...when you exit the menu it will default back to normal and you will have to reset to orbit.I have calibrated my tv with the eye-one colormeter, the free program ColorHCFR, and a free test pattern disc from avs forum called AVS HD709.  I recommend this over the DVE disc because it's FREE, and much easier to use, also includes APL (average picture level) patterns which is a better way to calibrate a plasma.I do wish the blacks were better and the color gamut was closer to the 709 spec.  Blues are a bit undersaturated and the hue isn't quite right.  When I try to fix one of these issues, the luminence gets worse so you need to compromise on this as luminence and saturation are both controlled by \"color\", hue is controlled by \"tint\".  For most users who don't calibrate with a meter and aren't that picky about it, you probably won't even notice these inaccuracies, you probably wouldn't notice with calibration off a disc either, I only noticed it when using a meter.NEW EDIT (10/07/2011)I have finally calibrated my tv with the DVE disc, which I also bought from amazon.  I give LG 2 thumbs up for the calibration.  If you go into the picture settings and go to isf-expert settings you will find that this tv has red, green, and blue filters....AWESOME (yes DVE has the color filters but it's easier to calibrate with the tv filter).  You can also independently adjust each color along with the combinations (magenta, cyan, yellow, etc).  The color calibration is much easier this way.  BUT I have to also give a thumbs down.....you cannot output audio from the USB source through the optical out on the tv...BOOOOO.The LG50PW350 is probably the cheapest 50 inch 3D capable tv you can buy right now.  It's not 1080p but 720p looks darn good and is good enough for me.  Sure there are better plasma tvs out there and you aren't going to get the black levels of a kuro pioneer but the kuro is over 3K and this tv is only around 750.I chose this over a panasonic 1080p 50in 3Dtv because it's 500 bucks cheaper, and it has a pc input using the old VGA (15pin D-sub).  There is an optical out...I thought it was weird and useless but it's actually a good idea since you can use a USB flash drive or external drive for movies and the sound can go to the receiver for decoding.  read edit above...this doesn't work)Video formats:Through the USB this tv supports:H.264, mpeg 1,2, or 4 formats for video.MP2, MP3, DD, AAC, HE-AAC, LCPM for audio(and since you don't have to use FAT32 partition like with the stupid PS3 you can play larger files without streaming from PS3).One caveat: the energy saving star thing is kind of BS.  If you want a good picture you will have to turn off energy saving mode otherwise the whites are terrible (like looking at the tv with sunglasses on).If you have lots of cash and want the best....this ain't it and I'd probably get a kuro for high end (3K+ dollars) or a panasonic or samsung plasma for mid-priced set (1-2k bucks).  But you get quite a lot of tv for the money with this one.I would highly recommend this tv for people who aren't label-snobs, aren't crazy videophiles who swear they can see the difference between 1080p and 1079p, and are interested in 3D and HD but don't want to break the bank.Actually I have this tv for 750 bucks and an xga projector that can be bought for 400 bucks so for the price of the panasonic 50in 3D plasma tv (ST not GT version) I have a 50in 3D 720p picture and a 84in 720p picture.  It's like PIP only supersized.", "Date": "July 25, 2011"}, {"Title": "Very impressed, with one exception...", "Author": "Travis Keatley", "ReviewID": "R2HPOAMD0SOE1N", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "This TV far exceeded my expectations. As many others have noted, I too was concerned with the fact that this TV was not 1080p. My parents own a Panasonic Viera 1080p plamsa, and I would say, however, that this LG plasma is very close in quality. I thought that images would not be as clear and crisp as I wanted them to, but I soon found out that I was wrong. From a comfortable viewing distance of 7 or so feet, this TV looks amazing. The detail in characters of movies and games is also impressive. I popped in my Avatar Blu-ray and I was immediately won over. The contrast between the lights and darks is great, and the black levels are very good, which is expected from a plasma. The 600hz refresh rate and fast response time make everything smooth, especially with sports and video games.The only problem that I have with this TV is the fact that it does not make a good PC monitor. Whenever it is connected to a TV, the native resolution makes the desktop look a little large and mis-shapen, but when playing games from the PC to the screen, things look great. It is also nice that the monitor will accept the 1080p input from my gaming consoles and PC, so those look amazing as well.The 3D games look great, but I cannot yet comment on the quality of 3D movies. However, because of the great 3-D games, I would have to imagine that a 3D movie would be just as impressive. The 2D to 3D conversion seems a little gimmicky, but it does add depth to your favorite shows and movies. I still prefer the 2D to stay in 2D though.Overall, I would recommend this plasma. For the price and the inclusion of 2 free pairs of glasses (when I bought it anyways) this deal cannot be beaten. Excellent sound from the on-board speakers and equally amazing picture make me very happy that I bought this television.", "Date": "December 8, 2011"}, {"Title": "Turks Review", "Author": "Turk", "ReviewID": "R3JGLBU5DWGTMT", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "It is a great T.V.

They honored the price match but wouldn'tinclude the 2 free AGS-250 3D Glasses w/c Fry's Electronics also provided. Still, I wanted to try Amazon's and theSquareTrade Warranty being sold in this site.SOME RANDOM POINTS:\"Native Resolution and Aspect Ratio Issue\"The Native Resolution of this TV (42PW350) is 1024x768 w/c is a 4:3 aspect ratio (Aspect Ratio of the old CRT \"Tube\" TVs [\"square-ish]).But, the panel or the TV itself is 16:9 aspect ratio (today's standard wide screen). Pretty weird right? How is1024x768 be a 16:9? Guess, what: These actually have \"rectangular\" pixels. Sounds weird but it is.So it's 1024x768 pixels stretched to a 16:9 aspect ratio and thus causes some issues I will discuss later.ISSUES:\"PC Text Sharpness\"Unless you use the native resolution of 1024x768 (1:1 Pixel Mapping), text wouldn't appear right/sharp.It would look fuzzy.If you decide to use the native resolution (1024x768), text would appear very clean and sharp but you sacrificethe \"widened image\" due to the \"Native Resolution and Aspect Ratio Issue\"You want to maintain the correct Aspect Ratio of the panel (16:9), use an HDMI Port and set the Resolution to1280x720, 1366x768, 1600x900 or 1920x1080. You will still be able to get  more than bearable texts by adjustingHorizontal or Vertical Sharpness (or just sharpness) to your liking.I find the 1366x768 the best resolution when using the PC with (Horizontal Brightness at 60 and Vertical Brightness at 70).This resolution is also te usual native resolution of mid range laptops from 11.6 inches to 14 inches.\"Jagged Lines Issue\"Some lines appear to be more jagged and uneven than usual. The most likely culprit is the \"native resolution issue\".Scrolling texts look weird and most jagged lines (especially in video gaming can be annoying). No amount ofAnti-Aliasing for PC games seem to fix this.\"PC HDMI turning off when changing input\"If you happen to use this as a second monitor (extended desktop) and changeInput, like changing to the TV or the PS3, it turns off the signal to the TV from yourPC and the PC may just recongize that you only have you're primary display.\"PC HDMI Audio disappearing when chaning the input to another and changing back, especially if too long\".Let's say you're using the display as a PC monitor that also outputs sound. If you go change to your TV or anotherdevice, then go back again to the PC Input, it would lose the audio. Happens more often if you don't go backquickly to the PC Input. This can be very annoying and I had to reset the darn PC every time!Luckily, I found a \"glitch\" or whatever to fix this.When the sound goes off, I have to go to Right Click the Speaker Icon, Click Playback Devices and theit would suddenly change setting back to HDMI Output! (it seems to have automatically changed itself toOptical Out)\"Zoom In, Aspect Ratio Issue\"There is no way to Zoom In in a way one can maintain the correct aspect ratio of the content/video. That meansthat when you zoom in, you stretch and distort the image at the same time. There are two Zoom Options and bothdo this.\"Somewhat Laggy Remote Control Input\"Pretty responsive with the first few menus but when you get to the \"Expert Controls\" for calibration or other tweaks, itgets pretty sluggish. Not really an issue who don't care for calibration or more in depth tweaks.\"Grey Pillar Bars\"SDTV (4:3) Contents will show Grey Pillar Bars on the left and right side of the TV and can be very annoying sinceone is more used to Black Pillar Bars. This also causes a lot of content to show the subjectively annoying \"HorizontalLine Bleed\" (We'll get to that). There isn't any option on the TV to change the Grey Pillar Boxes into black. I read somewherebefore that it was done to minimize screen \"Burn In\". Zoom In if you don't want the Grey Pillar Boxes but you'll get a distorted, wrong aspect ratio image.\"Horizontal Line Bleed\"As far as I have read around the net (mostly on AVSForum), this is pretty common on the lower to mid range Plasmasets and even can occur to the highest.It's pretty hard to describe but easy to see. You can google and even youtube \"Horizontal Line Bleed\". This isone of the most annoying thig with this set.It's significantly more apparent with PC usage but almost non existent with regular TV use.\"Auto Brightness Limiter\" (ABL)Can also be known or called as \"Brightness Pop\"/\"Fluctuating Brightness\" sometimes.Most cons said about Plasmas are \"Image Retentions, Burn Ins, Heat and Power Consumption\" BUT no one ever mentions ABL! The dirtiest, deepest, darkest secret con IMO.The MOST ANNOYING feature modern Plasmas have and pretty irritating on this model. (Some models or units havethis pretty well implemented that it is not so intrusive/obtrusive)I encourage you to google it or youtube it to learn more about it.What it basically does is that when there is a lot of white or very bright objects on the screen, the display would suddenlydim! NO, this is independent of any power saving feature and ambient sensors! You CANNOT turn this off!It was said that this \"feature\" was made to protect the display and to limit power consumption.This is WORST when watching cartoons (Disney, Anime, you name it) when there are sudden changes in contrast onthe screen.If you also use this as a computer monitor, it's also very apparent when resizing windows.You can test it by first opening google in windowed mode. You can tell that it's a white background.Now, turn it into fullscreen mode and there will be more white on the screen but suddenly got dimmer!Also can be very bad when watching movies with letterboxes (black bars) as you may notice them suddenly gettingbrighter or dimmer depending on the scene.And if you don't notice it thats GREAT! But it doesn't mean it doesn't exist as you can do Test Patters on this unit.This is a great display for the price if one isn't sensitive to this \"Auto Brightness Limiter\".\"Glimmer/Shimmer\"It depends on how sensitive you are but the panel seem to produce shimmering/glimmering pixels if you have keen eyes.I just got used to it and pretty negligible when you're in a good distance.\"Flicker\"Again, it really depends on how sensitive you are but there are a handful of people who are sensitive to this and Iam one of those. The screen flickers so fast and causes me some more eyestrain compared to our LCD especially whenthere are a lot of solid colors on screen (Very Rare on typical Movie content that aren't cartoons or similar). Took me 3 days to get used to this.I thought I was going crazy but when I set up my 2333HD HDTV Monitor beside this PW350.. damn! This thing does FLICKER!\"Dirty Whites\"White doesn't appear just bright enough and look like grey. I read about this and seem to be pretty common with plasmas. The ABL issue is also related to this.OTHER CONCERNS:\"Glare\"This is a plasma screen without those more advanced screen filters and glare can be a killer.Make sure to take this in consideration specially in a bright room with lots of windows w/o good blinds.\"Not the best for brightrooms unless you're comfortable re-calibrating a lot\"\"Can heat up a small area around the TV\"\"No cell light/back light option\" - prepare to re-calibrate most of the time if you want accuracy.\"Mixed guidelines for 3d glasses usage when charging\". - manual from the TV's box saysyou can use it while charging, the 3D Glasses Box said don't as it may damage the glasses.\"3D Glasses turn off every 10 minutes if you stay still\" - Says so in the manuals. Pretty stupid and shouldhave been increased to at least 30 minutes.\"take good care of it specially for the first 100-200 hours\" - Most plasmas are more prone toimage retention and/or Burn In during these first few hours.\"Don't play too long\" - specially if the game doesn't have moving/changing/disappearing HUDs.It will produce Image Retentions and may result to Burn In if you game too much. (Change content every few minutes)\"Heavy compared to bigger LCDS\"\"Ambient Light sensor\"\"Touch Sensitive TV buttons\" - hard to use at dark rooms.\"No Head Phone Jack\"NITPICKING:Pixelization if too close to TV since it's a 1024x768 w/c I don't really consider as a true HD res \"1280x720, 1366x768 and 1920x1080p\"Really only an issue for computer TEXT.Jumping, glimmering and shimmering pixels if too close to the set, especially on darker scenes.HOW ABOUT THE 3D?:This thing is OK for Movie 3D content but not for games (details later).\"Crosstalk (double images in 3D)I experience crosstalk 20-40$ of the time depending on content (So far, Megamind 3D was the best 3D experience so far).\"3D correction\" option gave me a better depth and overall look io 3D Mode but it gives occasional artifacting like weird colors and worsebrightness sudden changes. Take your pic.Also, I had to make sure the room was dark and don't have much stuff where the TV's reflection could bounce off. It's very annoying if it does.As for the glasses, I do not notice any flickering but this can vary from person to person.My AGS 250 glasses had some mild buzzing sound though. Not too distracting at least.POSITIVES ABOUT THE SET:\"Displays correct aspect ratio with 16:9 even with 4:3 native res\"\"3D on the cheap\" Great for movies, not so much with games.. Games like Killzone 3, Demon of Ghost of Sparta havealot of cross talk and is bearly playable (there's also jaggies and far from accurate colors) Demo of motorcross was better. You really have to see this for yourself to decide if 3d gaming's worth it or if thisis the main reason you're buying this TV for.MPG, MPEG, DAT, TS, TRP, TP, VOD, MP4,MOV, MKV, DivX, AVI, Motion JPEG (AVI,MP4, MKV), ASF, WMV, FLV for usbCOMMON PLASMA POSITIVES THAT THIS SET HAS:-Cheap for the size and feature set.-More natural looking colors (can be subjective)-Barely any juddering/smearing/ghosting if any. (This doesn't have the \"smoothing effect/soap opera effect\" of those 120hz and up (like TruMotion in LG)] displays. If you like that don't go plasma.-Barely any input lag for games. This set does have some input lag and I will post some objective results later with millisecond timings.------------------------------------------\"2D to 3D Feature\" - not really good.Blue Mode/ Blue Filter for easier basic color and tint calibrationReal Cinema (for 24p content)Great looking minimalistic design with dense plastic/glass bezel.Metallic finish on the back.\"dense\" Plastic/Glass bezelWILL UPDATE and format the review better next time.

Currently you can get this set for much less than I paid and that includes 2 pair of 3D glasses. Even though this set is 720p, to my eyes, it has a great picture. There are many custom settings that can be made, but using the pre-sets I think the Cinema picture mode looks very natural. Regarding the tuner, the HD channels look great and even the SD channels look good. One difference I've noted with LG is when scanning through the channels, they group the SD and HD channels seperatly not sequentially. Be aware that this set only has a optical digital audio out (no analog or headphone jack). I used a Monopiece Digital Coax & Optical Toslink to Analog Audio Converter and it did not work (it appears this device can only handle PCM encoded material). If you don't have a HDMI capable receiver the LG LSB316 soundbar (which I'm using) works well. Regarding the 3D effect, I've watch Tron Legacy and Avatar (3D encoded using a PS3) -- the picture is stunning and the 3D effect is good with minimal ghosting. The only issue I have is that the glasses do not stay synched to the TV and you have to keep re-powering the glasses (multiple glasses tried). I have not used the 2D to 3D conversion by the TV.

Combine this with a Panasonic wifi enabled 3d Blu Ray player and  the experience is great. I have had it only for 2 days now and I am hooked on to it. The only problem is that the TV screen is extremely glossy and will refelect even the tiniest bit of background light, so you need to have your background dark, else you will see its reflection on screen.

But let me tell..3d tv's that require active shutter glasses are worthless without the glasses. adormama has other deals with a pair of glases and a dvd player included here on amazon. get it with the glasses cause they run upward of about 80 bucks apeice..before you buy a 3d tv see how much the glasses cost first ..otherwise you may end up paying more for the glasses than the TV and it will be exspensive later on or maybe impossible to replace  if the battery dies tor they get lost or broken..especially if the particular modle glasses are discontinued..I would suggest passive 3d televisions beacause the glasses are cheaper and easier to replace..hint : they're the same glasses they hook you up with if you go to a 3d movie theatre. the ones your kid walks out with cuz they look cool and no one really cares if you take em..even thought technically you're supposed to return em to the glasses recyling box.. I contacted adorama through amazon to see if they'll cut me a deal on some glasses otherwise I'm gonna return the set and get the package deal for the same price that comes with dvd player and two sets of glasses..

The LG appears to have slightly finer resolution (although the 2 have same spec) and very good color rendition, although I prefer the Panny's color.  Perhaps that might change after tweaking.  Beware that the screen is very reflective so not a good choice for a sunlit room.  720p is not an issue unless you're within about 5' from the screen.  Beyond that, I'd doubt you'd notice much difference from a 1080p unless it's used as a computer display.Sound quality is quite good but I use my home theater audio when it really matters.  Has the ability to play many multimedia files via its USB port although it doesn't handle some important audio codecs such as DTS.  Have been able to view 3D MPO photos taken with a Lumix FZ-47.  Very cool and the 3D movie viewing is excellently cool as well.  My purchase came with 2 pairs of 3D glasses and I was lucky to get the updated firmware that does NOT have the auto shut-off issue.2 quibbles:1. On HD channels showing 4:3 programming, I'm unable to change the aspect to fill the screen.  It's a concern because I want to avoid burn-in.2. On non-HD channels with letterbox programming, one can \"zoom\" to center & stretch the image vertically to fill the screen, but the setting is not retained once you switch away from \"zoom\".  A nuisance.I would rate the LG 4.5 stars but because of its outstanding value, I'll bump it up.", "Date": "March 15, 2012"}, {"Title": "Cant beat it", "Author": "2ndhandstory \"2ndhandstory\"", "ReviewID": "R1ZEGWRGTWZLTI", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Product has such a great picture.

I can't say enough good things about it. Sure, it's not as thin in depth or edges like the higher end models - it's still quite thin for a plasma. What's important is the picture quality - to me plasma TVs technology in 2011 like the one here is good buy for those that primarily use it for movies. Blacks are stunning and the colors are so vibrant. There are lots of settings too to tweak the image - surprising for a low end model. This TV can also can also play media files straight from the one of the USB ports. For example, I can store a few movies in a flash drive and just play it straight from there. During the time of purchase, LG also included 2, 3D glasses worth $65 each so at the price they're asking, it's quite a compelling package value.
