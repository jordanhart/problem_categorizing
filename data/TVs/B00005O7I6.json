{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Excellent SD home-theater set", "Author": "DragonBoy", "ReviewID": "R3UWV1XQQQP9ML", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I purchased a Loewe Planus six years ago and it is still running strong today.  The picture is clear and sharp with excellent colour, deep black levels and high contrast.  Except for the VGA input, all video sources including the tuner are 480i but get digitized and displayed using a line doubler at 480p, producing a flicker-free picture.  The built-in speakers provide amazing sound for a television, loud and clear with excellent bass though the ports in the back when the Planus is against a wall.  The styling of the set is simple with the screen slightly forward of the side speakers, giving it a more artistic look than the shiny-plastic appearance most sets have today.Some things to consider:- Six years ago, this set was at the top of its class.  It lacks in features compared to modern sets, however.- The set is a CRT and thus very heavy (~90 pounds).- The Loewe brand used to be distributed in the U.S. by Sensory Science, but is no longer.  Expect parts/service to be hard to come by.- The set will only accept 480i through its component inputs; 480p sources (such as progressive-scan DVD players) will not display correctly.  The only way to get true 480p is through the VGA input; there is no DVI or HDMI input.- There are five display options:  - 16:9 = The video is stretched horizontally to fill the screen.  Used to display 16:9 video squeezed into a 4:3 signal.  All other display options are for regular 4:3 video.  - 4:3 = The full video displays in the center of the screen unchanged at a 4:3 aspect radio.  There are vertical black bars to the left and right of the image.  - screen = The video is stretched uniformly to 110% its size.  There are narrow vertical black bars at both sides of the screen.  The very top and bottom of the image are cut off.  Used to zoom in slightly on a 4:3 picture or to eliminate minor letterboxing.  - cinema = The video is stretched uniformly to 120% its size and fills the screen with no black bars on the sides.  The top and bottom are cut off.  Used primarily to remove the top/bottom black bars from letterboxing.  - zoom = The video is stretched uniformly to 130% its size and fills the screen.  The top and bottom are cut off.  The left and right edges are also cut off.- In the above display modes, closed captioning can only be displayed in 16:9 and 4:3 mode.  Unless you are in 16:9 mode, turning closed captions on will reset you to 4:3 until you turn them off.  This becomes noticeable when you set the closed-captions to \"Auto\" mode (captions are off normally, on when the audio is muted).- There is a feature to automatically detect letterboxing and adjust to the appropriate size.  However, more and more television shows and commercials are in a widescreen format.  Especially during commercial breaks the switching becomes noticeable depending on the content.- Picture-in-picture (PIP) location is adjustable.  Input and channel settings for both inputs are remembered.- The on-screen menu system responds slowly but is laid out well.- The remote control is simple, well-organized, and well-constructed.  My only complaint is that the volume up/down and channel up/down are controlled by pushing right/left or up/down on a solid plastic ring.  If you do not push directly left or right sometimes it is easy to change the channel while intending only to change the volume.  When you are on an external input source, this channel change will immediately switch you back to the tuner.- The onscreen connections menu lets you activate the various inputs and modes, but the only way to deactivate them is to reset all the connections.  There are two antenna inputs, three video inputs (1 front, 2 rear), and one VGA input.  The video inputs all support both s-video and composite.  There is an additional component video input that shares its audio with VIDEO 1.  The VGA input supports only 640x480 @ 60Hz resolution.- The power button on the front is a master power switch.  Turning it off disables turning the TV on from the remote.  Turning it on only puts the TV in standby mode.  There is no way to power on the TV except from the remote.Despite its few disadvantages compared to modern displays, the Loewe Planus is a workhorse and stunning both visibly and audibly.  Mine has given me no trouble in the six years that I have owned it, and I see no need to go HD just yet.  I am rating it four out of five stars as it's a superb television for its age, but may not compare in features for its price against newer models.", "Date": "January 18, 2007"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "$799.00", "Features": "30\" direct view television.  1080I resolution.", "Name": "Loewe Planus PLA530 30\" Direct-View Screen TV", "ImgURL": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/21MEZRJTB8L.jpg", "ProductID": "B00005O7I6"}}
