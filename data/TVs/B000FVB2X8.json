{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Great HDTV, Huge Screen", "Author": "SMcrossbay", "ReviewID": "R2PIWTJ1PYEK2K", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I have had this tv for 1 1/2 years now. The lamp died about 2 weeks before the manufacturer's warranty was up so i got a free one. Mitsubishi was very easy to work with, I faxed them my original invoice gave them the serial number and they sent a new lamp in 4 days, no cost to us at all. We only paid $599 for this HDTV, got it brand new on clearance sale so we feel like we got a awesome deal on this. I STRONGLY suggest the purchase of extended warranties on these if possible, the lamps cost approx. $240 to replace. We now have another year and a half extended warranty from the store we bought it from that will cover any work, parts & labor and a one time lamp replacement (we were lucky to be able to have the manufacturer replace the first lamp:) Overall great product. I Like the fact that it allows each input to be adjusted with individual video & audio settings. This model has Picture-In-Picture capability, and our satalite reciever also has P.I.P so we have the ability to watch 4 programs(football games:) at the same time. HD programing is superb. I hook up my computer through the side S-Video panel to play online games and its awesome.Problems: Only problem we have had so far is the lamp going out. It still had 2 weeks left under Mitsubishi's one year warranty so they sent us a replacement through the mail with instructions on how to install, it was easy to install. Make sure you hang on to your original reciept/invoice in case of warranty issues and always register new products with the manufacturer. Some companies require you to register products with them in order to activate your warranty and if you don't register it they don't have to honer the warranty! Always read the fine print. Recently the lamp light came on again and it seemed the after only about 5-6 months the new lamps had died. When i took the lamp out the go get it replaced i noticed that it looked just fine. I plugged it back in, closed tha panel hit the reset button, and it has worked just fine for almost 2 weeks now. I called mitsubishi and they said if it was bad it would most likely looked like it blew up inside the lamp and the tv might give a false dead lamp light and in order to fix it you have to open the lamp panel, take out the lamp, re-insert it, close the panel(tv will not turn on with the panel open,) hit the reset button, then see if it works.", "Date": "January 25, 2009"}, {"Title": "Solid HD picture. NO reflections from screen!", "Author": "Aaron", "ReviewID": "R2RCK9D8JSMWIP", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "This review is for anyone considering purchase of a used WD-62531 (or the related models like WD-62530), because I found very few reviews when buying one.I purchased a used WD-62531 and it has a solid picture for HD source material. I've had it for about a week. General impressions:* BIG screen* Good quality image with HD source material. Even at 720p, still makes me sit there and watch nature programs that are quite lifelike* Mediocre quality with SD sources. Stretch mode is bad and distractive, so I view in 4:3 ratio with black bars on sides* Compact cabinet, especially with the matching stand (base of TV slides into custom contouring on stand). Screen is not overly high from ground so no neck strain if sitting on floor. Slides very nicely into a corner of the room.* Wide viewing angles, horizontal & vertical* Absolutely NO reflections off the screen. Quite astounding. I previously had a TV that was quite reflective and distracting. The 62531's screen doesn't reflect anything* Minor screen-door effect where things shimmer. Only noticed a couple of times on backgrounds with subtle gradients, like ice in a hockey game, and the blue sea in Finding Nemo.* Skin-tone color isn't quite right - slightly reddish.  I'm still making some adjustments to the color settings, so perhaps with a little more experimentation this will improve.", "Date": "November 10, 2008"}, {"Title": "Not bad for 1k.", "Author": "James Michael Bone \"WiiBaron\"", "ReviewID": "R2GELKOVHNWPXM", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I actually own the 62530 (1 less HDMI & DVI ).
