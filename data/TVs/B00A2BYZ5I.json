{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Excellent TV for the price, highly recommend", "Author": "Frugal Money 1", "ReviewID": "R240I9X63DN7T2", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Like many others, I read the great reviews about this TV and wanted to check it out.  I searched all over for a block and mortar store that had it on display.  At the time only some Best Buy and HHGregg stores were carrying this model.  I do not have HHGregg around me, but started checking out all the Best Buy stores near me.  Several had it in stock but none had it on display.  I don't understand why, because this TV rocks and would fly off the shelves even faster if they had it on display.  I took a leap of faith and bought it without seeing it and I am not disappointed one bit.  Unfortunately, it was not available on Amazon when I was ready to buy.  I waited about 2 weeks, but finally bought it at Best Buy.  I disappointed having to pay a little more because of taxes, but it was still worth it!The user interface is very user friendly.  I read some minor complaints about the remote, but it only took a minute to get used to it.  It is very similar to a Nintendo Wii remote with that pointer that shows up on the screen, so if you've ever played with a Wii you will have no issues.The picture is bright and very real.  This is especially true with Blu-Ray movies.  I have a Panasonic Blu-Ray playerPanasonic DMP-BDT220 Integrated Wi-Fi 3D Blu-ray DVD PlayerI watched a movie from the 1960's that had been redone in Blu-Ray format and was amazed at the definition.  It was almost as if the actors were right in the room with you.  I was expecting to have to adjust the picture out of the box, but that was not the case.  Newer movies are even better!  I was concerned about motion blur compared to the plasma TV's.  The only time I have noticed this is when following a football, baseball, puck, etc in a sporting event.  So far, everything else has been very clear.I love the fact that it has passive 3D.  The glasses are lightweight, cheap to replace if necessary, no batteries or charging needed, and it comes with 6 pair!  A lot of the other 3D TVs I looked at either came with only 2 pair or none and were active 3D and would cost you a couple hundred dollars to get a few more pair.  The TV does convert 2D images to 3D and does a decent job.  I have not actually watched anything in 3D format yet, so the jury is out on that yet.  However, of the other TVs I tested with active and passive 3D, I could not see any difference.  My wife struggles with migraines, and I was worried about some of the comments that active 3D may cause headaches.  She has no issues with headaches with the passive 3D.  However, she has not actually watched anything with active 3D, so I have nothing to really compare this to.  When we first tried the 3D my 5 year old daughter was actually trying to reach out and touch things which was funny and a good sign that the 3D works!The sound from the actual TV is the only poor thing I have found.  However, whoever buys this and doesn't hook it up to a sound system  is not the brightest bulb in the bunch!  I hooked it up with a digital optical cable to my older Bose Lifestyle 28 system Bose Lifestyle \u00ae 28 Series II (Black) DVD Home Entertainment Systemand the digital sound is amazing.I have not had a chance to check out the split screen mode for gaming yet.  Supposedly, with the right glasses you then cannot see you're opponents screen.  I'll try to update this when I get the opportunity. Xbox 360 4GB ConsoleI bought all Amazon Basics HDMI cables (4) AmazonBasics 2-Pack, High-Speed HDMI Cables 6.5 feet -- Supports Ethernet, 3D, and Audio Return [Newest Standard]and digital optical cable (1) AmazonBasics High-Speed HDMI Cable and Toslink Digital Audio Optical Cable, 2 Packand have had no issues.  The best part is all the cables cost me less than $30.  I would have easily spent over $75 anywhere else.Overall, I would highly recommend this to anyone!  I hope this helps you out if you are shopping for a big screen TV!", "Date": "January 19, 2013"}, {"Title": "Great tv", "Author": "art", "ReviewID": "R2MIS3IID2301U", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Best tv for the money .

Coming from a Sony 55\" NX720 (no slouch in PQ department either) I can say that the this set BEATS the Sony hands down. The build quality is excellent, and I like the design of the base. Where this HDTV really shines for me is 3D viewing! Having dealt with Active 3D technology from Sony for the past 1.5 years, I can definitively state that Passive 3D is BETTER for me. With Active the crosstalk was horrendous. The glasses were heavy, had to be charged, and gave me headaches due to the active shudder flashing. Plus, the crosstalk was present across the top of the screen, rendering 1/3rd of the picture blurry. This sucked for games and for watching ESPN 3D where the score text is kept. I've already watched Avengers 3D and Tron Legacy 3D on this LG and it's a brand new experience. I can actually enjoy the movie now. Everything is in focus and comfortable to watch. My wife and kids now WANT to watch 3D again! 2D viewing is a very pleasant experience, the best I've seen. The clarity is amazing.The TV interface is very well organized, and quick. The remote is easy to use (if you've used a Wii then you can use this) but I setup my Logitech Harmony remote so I don't really use the \"magic\" remote anymore. In short, I am very pleased with this LG set (my first LG!), the WAF is off the charts, and my kids love watching 3D again.My settings:Picture menu:Energy Saving: OffPicture Mode: Expert [1 or 2]Backlight: 50 (for 3D viewing, Backlight is 80, otherwise all the same )Contrast: 80Brightness: 50H Sharpness: 10V Sharpness:1 0Color: 50Tint: 0Aspect Ratio: Just Scan--Expert control menu--Dynamic contrast: OffSuper Resolution: OffColor Gamut: StandardEdge Enhancer: OffxvYCC: Off (grayed out)Color Filter: OffExpert Pattern: Off (grayed out)Gamma: 2.2--White Balance submenu--Default--Color management system submenu--Color Temp: WarmDefault (rest of settings)--Picture Option menu--Noise reduction: OffMPEG Noise Reduction: OffBlack Level: LowReal Cinema: OnEye Care: Off (grayed out)LED Local Dimming: Low (I experimented with each setting.

Riley", "ReviewID": "R2WYCPCDV3TZ6Z", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "We purchased this TV on Saturday and it was delivered on Sunday from our local electronics retailer.The 2D picture right out of the box (via Directv HD receiver) is incredible!  We purchased a \"Yogi Bear\" movie in 3D for us and our kids to try out the 3D.  We use our PS3 to play the 3D and it also looks incredible... you feel like reaching out and grabbing at the screen or dodging flying things as they seem to come right at you.  When researching both \"active\" and \"passive\" 3D, we decided to go with passive. Keep in mind that passive 3D can be viewed with light weight regular 3D glasses, while \"active\" must be viewed with battery powered glasses that are a little heavier and more costly.The internet access on this TV is great as well as the \"magic remote.\"  As stated in a previous review, if you've played a Nintendo Wii, you will have no problem using this remote at all.  I imagine the learning curve is rather short for anyone new to this type of remote.As it's only been 4 days that we've had the TV, I'm not sure how it will behave in the long run.  Thus far, we are very pleased and we had a Samsung prior to this TV.  I have to say we're sold on the LG 60LM7200...  although none of us are 49ers or Ravens fans, we're looking forward to watching the big game this coming weekend on our new TV!", "Date": "January 30, 2013"}, {"Title": "Fantastic!", "Author": "technojunkie", "ReviewID": "R3PG9O6T5LEUZZ", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I was upgrading from a very good Sony 60 inch DLP. Setup was easy, like the magic remote (only because I had a Wii).At first I was very disappointed with the picture, I thought it was very grainy, especially with people's faces. Graphics, like those used in newscasts were unbelieveably sharp. I may have had my DirectTV sat box set at the wrong resolution, I honestly don't know. I also know that the different HD broadcasts do not all look equally good. I had some initial problems getting 3d from my PS3 for bluray 3d dvds, but after talking with LG (unbelieveably fast and accurate tech support) they told me to change the output resolution on the ps3 to 1080p and boom 3d! Before that it kept saying that the disc has detected a hardware error. Similarly, my older Directtv DVR didn't do 3d (i didn't realize that), but 3d looked great after I swapped out to newer box I already had. I bought and watched Disney's Tangled (actually a pretty damn good movie) and the 3D, and I'm not exaggeratign, i'm very critical) was STUNNING! also the picture was FAR sharper than the (probably highly compressed) DirectTV broadcasts. The set is a great deal brighter than my Sony DLP was. I won't even wash out in a well sunlit room without being on max brightness. The set has NUMEROUS settings you can mess with to get just the picture you like and you can assign different settings to different inputs. I turned off the energy saver immediately (too dark). If you dont' have a 3d DVD or 3d on your cable provider, you can hook up the tv to your wired or wireless broadband connection and there is a great deal of free 3D content in the smart tv section. I highly recommend \"monsters of the deep\" or something like that. At the very beginning some kind of CG plesiosaur comes what seems like 5 feet out of the screen, and it's not a cheap effect either, it is truly stunning. The TV thankfully also has an optical audio out from the TV because although I run all my Video stuff through my sony amplifier (hdmi passthrough), you still might want to pump the TV audio through your receiver as the built in speakers are pretty \"meh.\" Even if you don't care about 3D, it's pretty damn cool when done thoughtfully. It also does 2D to 3D and does an pretty damn good job! In some instances people's faces look like they are separated from the rest of their head (kinda creepy) but some of the stuff actually is 3D (text and background and stuff....how do it know???) I still need to do a proper calibration of the set and am waiting for my disney WOW DVD to help with that. So far, every bit worth the money to me. Oh, one more thing, don't be too wow'ed that it comes with 6 pairs of 3D passive glasses, they are total crap! the lenses are just film. Get a good pair on the web for 12 bucks. All in all i'm very, very pleased with this purchase.", "Date": "February 9, 2013"}, {"Title": "What more could you want?!", "Author": "DDIGGS", "ReviewID": "R2GXC12YT9RYP", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "For those of you who are confused about the model this is the LG LM7200 since they don't name it in the description.  This is one of the top TV's hands down.  I actually purchased the new M Series Vizio 60\" before this one.  I ended up returning the Vizio because of usual problems with the remote not functioning and no buttons on the actual TV body itself, which made the TV features unusable.  So to make a long story short I traded for the TV I wanted in the first place which was on sale for 1499.00 $100 more than the Vizio.  Compared to the Vizio every things pretty much the same.  This LG just is way more user friendly.  I've owned this Tv for about 2 weeks now and have had not one problem whatsoever.  The picture quality is amazing and the 3D makes it that much more amazing.  2D to 3D feature is pretty good, not as deep as normal 3D but nice.  The magic remote is a great feature, though some may not like the remote I think its nice and makes it very easy to maneuver through the menu options.  If I had to be picky I would say the TV receives a weaker signal than most units but is good enough for the usage.

As has already been stated, the picture this set produces after adjusting the settings is awesome.

Btw, i used the settings listed on an earlier post by PERFECT CR and the settings were Perfect. On a scale of 100 I would give this TV a 99. I'm deducting 1 point because the remote doesn't have an input button. One must use the menu to select the correct input. But don't let that minor quibble dissuade you from checking this fantastic TV out.One could pay a lot more and not get a flat screen this good.Now i'm just waiting to receive my OPPO 103 BR player and see what this beauty can do with a real 1080p signal.", "Date": "October 1, 2013"}, {"Title": "A great TV", "Author": "J.

(when I first got my tv, it only played a few of the video formats I had on external hard drives... now it plays all of them, although audio is sometimes to low ( because of the codec being used) hopefully this will be the next update... anyways they have also improved the menu system which as stated above still has some work to be done. I guess I'm just happy a company is actually making meaningful improvements to the firmware.I got this at best buy for 1400 bucks on sale, but I would say it is a good tv for anything under the 2000 range.I hope this review helps, and enjoy the tv if you decided to get it.", "Date": "September 30, 2013"}, {"Title": "great tv", "Author": "roboabba", "ReviewID": "R35H362AB4NIBV", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "this tv is not easy to find for what ever reason.
