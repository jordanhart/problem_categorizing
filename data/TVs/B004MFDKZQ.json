This is my second Toshiba LCD, as I was very pleased with the 42\" I bought 3 years ago.I generally like everything about Toshiba TVs... good performance for moderate price, sensible menus and controls, quality, etc...That said, this TV sounds bad. If you care about sound and don't want to break the bank, I highly recommend Samsung's entry level models. I planned from the beginning to plug this Toshiba into a Pioneer receiver for sound, so I didn't even check the sound in the store. So, the poor quality sound doesn't effect me, but if you don't plan to use external speakers and a receiver, the sound might be a deal-breaker for you.Otherwise I am thrilled with everything else about this purhcase and have no regrets. I would have given it 5 stars if it had excellent sound.", "Date": "April 22, 2011"}, {"Title": "Good picture, bad sound", "Author": "T.

The TV is for my daughters bedroom.  The picture is fine - we have it hooked up to U-Verse via HDMI.  But the sound is awful.  It's bad enough that I'm debating returning it just for that.  It's like it only has tweeters - no midrange or woofers.  You have to turn it up really loud to understand dialogue.  Because of its use in a bedroom the sound really isn't that critical.  I'll give my daughter a week to adjust to the sound. If she's still not happy I'll take it back.  It's sad that the Emprex TV it's replacing sounded so much better.  Five stars for value, 4 stars for picture, 1 star for sound.", "Date": "May 15, 2011"}, {"Title": "Beautiful clear picture", "Author": "Richard G.", "ReviewID": "R3HFEV70UFTH6A", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I had already bought the 26\" version of this set and was so pleased with the picture quality that I went for the 32\". I have satellite TV and the HD image run through these TV's is stunning in it's clarity. If you can, do use the cables from your cable box to connect up, instead of just the standard coax. It's a knock out. Toshiba makes good quality televisions and they kept the price down, with these budget sets. Oh, and if you are like me, and you were agonizing about whether to spend the extra dough, to buy a 1080p TV versus a 720P? The need for the 1080p only comes into play when you get into the 46\" screens and beyond. Don't throw your money away thinking that you've got to do that. The clarity of this 32\" is perfect. My friend just bought a 46\" Sony 1080p for about a thousand bucks. Yup, the picture quality is the same as mine. Speakers: the TV makers pretty much assume that folks are running their sound through their home audio or stereos, as I am, so the cabinet speakers are not deluxe for that reason. It's a non issue. Also, rear port damage is usually caused by overly strained cables (the morons who make the HD cables seem to think 6' is long enough, I use a longer and softer cord for the connections to the back of the TV). Lastly, many thanks to the folks who took the time to review this television on the site here, because it helped me a lot, as usual.", "Date": "June 26, 2011"}, {"Title": "Great value for a selective bunch", "Author": "Autistic Aaron", "ReviewID": "R36LWG60J0OFA9", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "This is an excellent, quality television for the price.  It features your average customizable settings for picture; you can choose from presets or alter individual settings (contrast/brightness, tint, backlighting, and dynamic contrast) to your tastes.  Picture can be displayed in standard 16:9, 4:3, and three \"TheaterWide\" options (a Toshiba thing that I never really understood -- possibly put in place to fill the screen as best as possible for videos rendered in anything other than 16:9 or 4:3.)Inputs run the gamut of 2 HDMI ports, one component-in, two A/V-in, a digital audio port, and antenna-in.  I imagine this is plenty for anyone buying a 32\" television -- I use a receiver, thus, I only utilize a single HDMI port.  Even without a receiver, you've got the option of three HD inputs and two SD inputs, not including the standard antenna/TV-in.For gamers, the \"Gaming Mode\" should NOT be overlooked -- it minimizes the post-processing of the video signal to reduce the refresh rate as much as possible.  This translates to quicker reaction times from controller to display.  This can be especially helpful for rhythm/music games and fighting games, where split-millisecond inputs can make or break your experience.  I'm a big fan of the former, and for a LCD television, it definitely satisfies.  It isn't a perfect 0ms, but it's not far off.Other features include closed captioning, channel labeling, energy saving, locks based on channel rating and/or PIN code, sleep timer, and three languages for the menus -- English, Spanish, and French.  The remote control is no-frills, and can be programmed to control your DVD and/or Blu-Ray player.  It certainly isn't the most attractive remote control, but there are aftermarket options for those that need their coffee table or nightstand to look as good as their home theater setup.As for the selective bunch, there really isn't anything to complain about IF you use a receiver and surround sound system as opposed to the built-in speakers, and if 1080p isn't necessary for your needs.  It should be noted that this television does render in 1080i, but 720p is preferred for sharpness and clarity.  I tested the built-in speakers to see what others were complaining about, and they are certainly entitled to this gripe -- it's pretty bad.  For that, I docked a star.I've owned this television for around six months, and I love it.  Personally, I would give this television five stars for its value -- I got a great deal on it.  Considering current market prices, I can't appropriate the need for LED-LCD, 1080p, 3D, etc.  For those using a receiver with a separate sound system, this is certainly a five star value.  My family and I have owned nothing but Toshiba and Sony televisions for the past 20 years, and neither brands have let us down yet -- Toshiba makes reliable, quality televisions.", "Date": "June 17, 2011"}, {"Title": "Possible Workaround for Audio", "Author": "Greg Burton", "ReviewID": "R3BC9GHLPY5WJS", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I read the reviews that criticized the audio quality of this television and I purchased the TV anyway.What I have noticed is that when the TV sits on a tabletop on the supplied stand, that the sound fromthe bottom mounted speakers bounce off of the table surface and seems somewhat distorted.

Unfortunately, we had no idea how bad the sound actually was until we turned it on and heard it.  The other reviews warned us, but we thought that if it were an issue, we could simply attach a set of speakers and be OK.  We were WRONG.The sound quality of the TV speakers are terrible.  It really does sound like you're listening to a laptop computer.  Everything is tinny.  We tried to go around that by hooking up a set of 2.1 speakers we had lying around, except that this TV only has one audio out port and it is for digital optical audio (Toslink) cables.  I had no idea what those were until I did more research online.  As it turns out, its an audio cable format that is really only used by audio receivers and other high end audio equipment.  So if you don't have an expensive audio receiver and surround sound set, you won't have any GOOD way of connecting external speakers.Not wanting to return the TV, we cobbled together the next best solution.  We bought a Toslink (digital optical audio) cable from Amazon as well as a Toslink to Analog RCA converter box.  We then ran the Toslink cable out from the TV into the converter box, then a set of RCA cables into our 2.1 speaker system.  The end result is that we have great sound quality, but it comes at a bizarre cost.  We have not been able to control the volume through the remote control.  I have no idea why, but the audio out doesn't seem to be volume controlled by the TV.  Thus, we have to use the little dial on the speaker set to adjust the volume.  It's annoying for sure, but not the end of the world.So, if you don't have an audio receiver, I would avoid this TV.

It seemed to have the nicest picture, just barely, of the 32\" TV's priced around $300, at least as they were set up and configured in the store.  I didn't think to check the sound in the store.  I don't consider myself all that picky when it comes to TV sound, at least I've never felt the desire to add a fancy audio system to any TV.  The built-in speakers on every TV set I've owned have always been just fine in the past.  Not an issue.  I don't think I've ever heard a TV and thought to myself, \"Wow, what horrible sound!\"  ...until I bought this Toshiba.  Very tinny sound, no bass and practically no mid-range.  A cheap radio would sound better.  There is no owner's manual with this TV, just a quick guide sheet for basic setup which is NOT very informative.  The remote also looks cheap.  I hate to return items, but as soon as I turned on this TV set I knew it was going back to the store.  There is no way I can get used to that awful sound.  I have no desire to pay more money to add a sound system, which I'm guessing would have to be a rather expensive system since this TV only has digital audio out.

Even though the tv is offered at a low price it is not a steal, you have to buy external equipment just to hear it and in the end it costs close to $400.

I was not thrilled with the quality. The TV on the whole doesn't look very good. I know I didn't pay a lot for it but then I think there is a certain level of quality that one can expect. The stand is of a plastic sort of a material, flimsy looking. The picture quality isn't very good either. Standard definition looks just awful. I was also a little confused with the picture size formatting. The only way I could have picture on the whole screen was by using the 'Theatre Mode' but then the picture looked too stretched and unwatchable. Fast moving objects blur. Its a 60Hz 720p alright, but there is better out there. The only thing good I thought was the sound.

They have it setup for -all- HDMI connections AND the PC connection go through 1 single 3.5mm headphone jack... Not RCA... Not fiber... an RCA jack.  The fold out manual doesn't tell you this.  Neither does the online manual, except in one picture... just calls it an audio jack.
