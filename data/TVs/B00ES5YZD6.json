I really like the large 65\" Triluminos screen. This set has the deepest blacks and best colors ever.The other night I watched Avatar in 3D. Let me tell you, it looked much better than at the theater. The TV picture is plenty bright in 3D when wearing the active glasses. It's amazing how the colors looked so vivid even in 3D. At the movie theater the 3D picture was never bright enough and the dingy colors had that stupid greenish tint.  Now with this new Sony set I will be watching a lot more 3D movies.This new KDL-65W850A set includes 3 larger speakers which gives it really good sound.This is a Smart TV and has lots of extra's to many to name and includes many pages of easy to select apps to use. I counted a whopping 290+ apps once I connected it to my internet/router and selected Home/ all-apps. I would think anybody would enjoy owning this fantastic Sony set. Most of all I'm really impressed with it's 3D performance. The Triluminos picture quality is simply outstanding for general viewing and especially for streaming or blu-ray movies.Check out my many screen shots in the higher page numbers in these AVS forums below.

After getting this TV set up and getting to spend some time watching it I literally called a few of my friends and told them I was considering taking a job without so much travel just so I could be home more to watch this thing.  I seriously made that call.  The really \"bad\" part about this TV is it completely spoils you.  I can't even watch TV at anyone's house anymore because nothing looks as good as the picture on my TV.Now onto the details of this beauty.  There are some sample photos that come with the TV to really showcase the panel this TV uses.  I just looked at those sample images tonight with my family and everyone went WHOA when we flipped through them.  There are 2 pictures in that set of 4 that look identical to a 4K TV I was drooling over a few weeks ago in Chicago for about 3k more than I paid for this set.  The picture quality on this TV is just stunning.  The skin tone is perfect, the blacks are black, whites are white, no motion blur that I see and hardly any energy is used to run this TV.  When I saw the sticker on the TV showing energy consumption over a year I thought it was a joke.  I've had the TV on for several hours now and went over to it and put my hand on back and front of it.  There is no noticeable heat generated at all from this TV.  There is an alert LED light on the set that will display different colors depending on what you are doing with the set.  This is very similar to the lights on our smart phones.  I have a GS4 and when I have a text message the LED is blue, charging red, etc.  It's nice to see that notification LED now being implemented in TVs and it is helpful.  I run my sound through a 5.1 sound system so the speakers on the TV are really not something I care about but I tested them out and they sound surprisingly good for being so thin.Viewing angles - I tested out the viewing angles based on a question from a comment on my review and I was actually very surprised at how wide the viewing angle on this set is.  My previous LCD TV would start to get hard to see if you were much past 45 degrees from the center line of the set.  I can stand almost directly on the side of this TV and still see the picture perfectly.  It seems this TV really does to everything perfectly.Now let me talk about the design of the unit.  It comes with 2 remotes, a small one that is like a \"smart\" remote with less buttons and then the normal remote.  I was surprised at how few buttons there on the remote after getting to play with it.  It seems remotes get more and more stuff as each year passes.  There is a reason why this TV's remote has the amount of buttons it does.  It does everything perfectly.  If you are in an app using the \"smart\" features of this TV the options button brings up the app options.  Basically the buttons around the center (mostly just the options button) of the remote are context sensitive menu buttons that will have different features depending on what you are doing with the TV.  This might not seem like a big deal to many people but I noticed this immediately as a very smart and user friendly design feature.  The TV is incredibly thin and the silver ribbed frame is gorgeous and understated without being gaudy.3D - 3D looks better on this TV than at the movie theaters.  I wasn't a huge fan of 3D, having seen it several times, until I got this unit and watched Jurassic Park.  It completely blew my mind as well as my family who watched with me.  I'm now obsessed with 3D thanks to this TV.  The set comes with 4 sets of glasses.  They are very comfortable to wear and work well if you wear eye glasses like me.Smart TV - I always thought smart TVs were a bit of a gimmick until getting this unit.  I've spent the last 3 hrs watching NatGeo videos on the YouTube app on this TV.  I'm actually already looking at getting a nice small wireless keyboard to use with this.  My computer is already getting jealous because with how great everything looks on this TV why would I sit here on my PC and watch stuff on a 27\" screen when I can watch on a gorgeous 65\".That's all I can think of for now.  I will update my review from time to time with how my experience with this amazing set evolves over time.  So far it's better than any TV I've ever owned and better than any TV I've ever seen at anyone else's house.  The stunning picture, ease of use, 3D, apps and features, design - it's all flawless.  Sony completely knocked it out of the park with this one and I'm loving every second of owning this.- updated 1/9", "Date": "January 3, 2014"}, {"Title": "w850a > w900a", "Author": "C. W.

Make no mistake about it, the picture on the 850a is every bit as good as it's smaller 900 brother.  In fact, the uniformity is actually better on the larger screen (no idea why as this seems backwards to me).  The sound is also much better on the 850 vs the 900 since it has an additional speaker (3 in the 850 vs 2 in the 900).  I don't notice any difference in response time between the two units.  Visually, the 900 has a slight green border from the cut glass on the edge of the screen while the 850 has a silver steel mesh border.Both TVs are incredible but if you have the room and extra cash, go for the 65\" 850.", "Date": "December 5, 2013"}, {"Title": "Awesome TV !!!!!", "Author": "Dinesh Gurumurthy", "ReviewID": "R2NT4W85CUN5A", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I got my TV shipped from Amazon yesterday.

It's fantastic.I spent the last couple of months reading reviews, from Amazon, CNET, other sites. I had it narrowed down to the Samsung, Sony and Panasonic Plasmas.  After looking at all of the side by side, the samsung picture quality just wasn't on par with the Sony or Panasonic. However, of the two sets, the panasonic has a slightly better picture quality... but it's really only noticeable when looking at them both side by side. I didn't want to pay a $1k more for the panasonic - so I got the Sony and the Sony soundbar for the same price.Picture quality on the Sony is increadible.

I probably won't buy a TV from anywhere else ever again. I live in a big city and don't have a car.  Originally thought about having Best Buy or Costco deliver, or else borrow or rent a car/truck to move it.  Amazon's delivery service was a huge relief.  It was seamless -- I scheduled a delivery window about a week out, they showed up on time, unpacked it, put it on my TV stand, and checked to ensure it worked.  The only downside is they didn't call me at all, either the night before or even on 30 min notice; I actually called them twice as I was getting antsy.  But they were still on time nonetheless.As everyone else has noted, the TV itself is gorgeous.  In my mind, unless you're ready to jump up to 100+ inches with a projector screen, this is the perfect size.  Any smaller just doesn't do modern TV justice; any bigger just seems a bit obnoxious.  This is great for viewing distances between 5 and up to about 12 feet. The biggest problem is getting off the couch once I've turned it on.Not much else to say other then after hours and hours of research, based on reviews and price this seemed to be the best value for money for 60+in TVs.  I feel like my decision was validated; I don't think you'll be disappointed. Also, the fact that you can plug external HD into the USB slots to view pics/vids is a nice bonus.", "Date": "April 16, 2014"}, {"Title": "Love the Picture but waiting to get a set with less defects", "Author": "J. A. Torres", "ReviewID": "RHLYO55LQHI67", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I absolutely love the picture quality on this LED but I keep getting bad TV's. First one came with a big dent down the middle back of the TV and the packaging was unharmed. Second one, that is getting exchanged this Friday 1/31/14, came with a problem with the panel and sound. The screen has for a lack of better word ripples or a bulls eye. I am posting pictures to see if anyone else has this issue. The ripples or bulls eye is slightly noticeable dead center but you can still slightly make it out but very noticeable viewing from angles. It is also most noticeable on solid color backgrounds of White, gray and reds. Also one speakers has a hiss and pop sound that is intermittent. It shows up while using the built in tuner to watch TV channels. When tuning to a channel the hiss and pop starts and remains even after changing input selections (input 1, 2 etc.. etc..) Only way to get rid of it is to go back to TV input and keep changing channels till the sound goes away then it is gone on all inputs. Strange but once it is gone no other A/V equipment (Computer, Blu-Ray, or PS3) causes the sound issue on any other input for the exception of the TV input while navigating to select channels. I am hoping the replacement arrives and works as it should because minus these two issues this TV is a solid 5 stars.UPDATE: 2/4/2014I received the new TV yesterday and unfortunately it suffers from the same issues albeit not as much. The screen still has uniformity/banding issues just not as intensely noticeable as the first TV. Almost seems like it is dirty in places including both vertical edges. I think most people will not notice because you have to have a still solid light colored back ground such as white, gray or red. Also the sound ticking issue happened once so far on the left speaker again but once it was gone it has not returned yet. While the picture is nice and the blacks are very good for a LED panel I am still very bothered that a TV at this price point is plagued by such problems. I am currently deciding if I should live with/ignore the problem or exchange it or just get a refund and try something else. I will post new pictures of the screen when I get a chance. It would be great if any current owner of this TV can check for the issue I am having and if they can confirm they do not have the issue let me know the Date your TV was manufactured. I also want to state that Amazon has been nothing short of awesome through this whole process.UPDATE: 2/4/2014Hiss and ticking came back on the left speaker only and I cannot get rid of it. Called Amazon to setup another exchange. Decided to give it one more try since some people seem to continue to state they have not experienced any of the issues I have had with the picture. New TV should arrive 2/12/14 and I will update when it arrives.Just wanted to add both TV's were updated to the latest software and the defects persisted after the updates were completed.UPDATE: 2/8/14If amazon allows the link below and it works, it will take you to an image galley on the AVSforum where you can browse the pictures of people who purchased this TV. Some of the pictures show the good aspects of the TV and some show issues people are having with the panels including the issues I am currently having.www dot avsforum dot com/t/1491811/lightbox/UPDATE: 2/12/14TV #4 Came in today and there is good and bad news.First the good. The bulls eye or crescent shaped discoloration was not noticeable on this TV. Also I did several Test with the audio and heard no clicking but I also did not try the TV tuner at all this time. So either the problem did not exist on this TV or it is a problem that is created by the TVs internal tuner.Now to the Bad. First, The uniformity problem still exist and I am pretty sure it is just a problem that effects all these TVs and it is a problem that I would be willing to live with it if it wasn't for other issues that have plagued the TVs I received. Second this is the first TV out of the three I have had sent to me that had an issue with clouding or back lighting issues that were visible on a black back ground (I will post pictures tomorrow). This is also the first TV that I received that was manufactured December 2013. The others were from October 2013.Maybe I will wait till March and see what people say about the new models coming out. I will say it is interesting that Sony just put out, relatively speaking, this model and it is already replacing it with another one, next month, albeit a 5 inch bigger version which will not have the tri-luminous display. All in all this has been a pretty frustrating experience and unfortunately I will have to keep my rating at 3.5 stars. I am glad some others have had nothing but a good experience with this TV but I did not.FYI:The New Model of this TV is the KDL65W950B Not the KDL70W850B.", "Date": "January 27, 2014"}, {"Title": "Absolutely amazing.", "Author": "F.

My observations:1) Plasmas, in general do not have enough luminescent \"horsepower\" to create a true, crisp, clean, brilliant white compared to LEDs.2) Plasma blacks are indeed very deep - this ability for adjacent pixels to quickly go subterranean black serves to place a contrast around vivid colors to really make colors pop from the screen.3) However, on plasmas, shadow areas often seem totally \"black-washed\" - in the photographic sense where an image is over-exposed and areas that should have color and detail are washed to white, except in the opposite direction. On the plasmas, a shadow area of a room, a dark suit, black hair would often just be a total pixel-turned-off black, but viewing the Sony next to it I could see that there were still details to be seen in the shadow of the room, folds in the suit, highlights in the hair, etc.4) Colors -other than skin tones. In our store, part of the showroom video test loop is a scene where where sunlight shines in a forest and through leaves (green, fall colors of gold, orange, reds). Here, the top plasmas clearly excelled in presenting exciting, vivid colors with the Sony a very close second. Other LED's, the colors seemed \"thin\" with a slight white-washed appearance over the whole image.5) Skin tones. The human ear/brain is an amazing broad-bandwidth transducer & processor but numerous design curiosities tell us that the human ear is also uniquely designed to especially detect and process the slightest nuance of one thing in particular: the human voice. Same thing with the eyes/brain looking at a face and skin tones - it is very difficult to fool the eyes with anything fake about the human face: plastic surgery, botox, fake tan, make-up, etc. Skin tone is the hardest test for a color TV to get past the human eye. Showroom demo loops are filled with scenes with rich, saturated colors that really pop from the screen and stimulate and excite the eye/brain. But put close ups of the human face - especially from a spectrum of cultures - and... uhoh. Now some of the screens that looked so vibrant on other material look fake when trying to render skin tones. Skin tone rendering is the tattle-tale of coloring tricks used or mis-alignment. In my hours of observation, no set, plasma or LED, can nail skin tones as realistically as Sony.6) The Sony 4K sets were nice as long as they were processing 4K material. But, in our showroom when the source switched to BlueRay HD, the 4K Sony lost ground and the Sony W series excelled. Match the right tool to the job it was designed and optimized for and you'll get superior results at the proper price point.7) Bottom line: my money goes to the Sony KDL-65W850A for bright, vivid colors; crisp picture; and, perfect skin tones.", "Date": "December 16, 2013"}, {"Title": "As good or better than plasma picture...", "Author": "AMZ DAD \"amazmc\"", "ReviewID": "R35FDPIL5QK176", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Here's a simple statement.  A local high-end A/V outfitter recommended this tv to me, their basic synopsis was; this \"W\" series is basically the best tv sold without 4K and without the 4K price tag.  It's the same other than that and they were spot on.  I walked in looking at 65\" Samsung 7100 to upgrade our 50\" Panasonic plasma which was too glossy in our new house family room.

With the enhanced delivery process and even the expertise of the delivery man I'm not sure why I haven't done this sooner.  Pricing was essentially the same on amazon as in local stores but I will never again think twice about a large tv purchase on amazon.

I originally purchased the Vizio E701I-A3, but returned it after a month. The Vizio was a decent TV, but the picture washed out quite a bit when viewed from even a slight angle and it just wasn't an impressive picture. The picture quality of this Sony TV on the other hand, is absolutely stunning! It seems so lifelike. The Triluminous display is a real treat to watch. I don't know how Sony pulled it off, but the colors are fantastic. The display produces great flesh tones while at the same time making things like blue skies, green vegetation, colorful flowers, etc. look so vibrant, rich, and well, lifelike. The TV also has great blacks and handles motion really well. I used the Disney WOW calibration disk to adjust the display and only ended up adjusting the hue three clicks in the green direction, everything else was on the money right out of the box! I'm usually a bit sceptical about marketing statements like the one Sony has for this television \"Introducing a picture so lifelike, it's like looking through a window\", but I have to say that this statement sums it up quite well! The smart features are plentiful, work well, and the menus are well organized. It comes with two different remote controls, one is very simple and elegant, and the other has all of the bells and whistles. I can't say how well the 3D functions yet, but if it's on par with the rest of the TV, it will be top notch. The digital tuner is quite sensitive. The Vizio could find three stations, but this Sony found eleven. Both TVs were hooked to the exact same outdoor antenna. The only negatives I've found so far are the fact that you can't access the TV settings menus while using the Netflix app and the sound. The sound isn't bad at all, but it lacks a little in the low end, but I'd expect that from such a slim TV with downward firing speakers. I use a 7.1 surround system anyways, so for me it wasn't even an issue. Even if I could only use the built in sound I'd purchase this TV, the picture quality way outweighs any deficiency in the sound.

Watched the live performance of Sound of Music last night on this new KDL65W850A, I converted the 2d feed to 3D and it was stunning.  It seemed to vastly increase the size of the already big 65\" screen, and the conversion was just the right amount of 3D not overkill at all.

First starting with the only negatives I could find then the positives the tv has, thus this review will be updated.The current industry standard is edge lighting, cheaper and causes it's own issues.Edge Lighting1.Has to pass light by other pixels to light the middle.  The only time you'll see it on this tv is in \"I'm ready to display something mode\"  Such as input (hdmi,av) mode, device hasn't been turn on yet.+Positive is that when something on the screen is black it's black (local dimming). That includes bars(top-bottom, left-right bars), black background tv looks like it\u2019s turned off!2.A thin reflective plexiglass, defuses light.  At some point the plastic must flex to reflect light causing uniformity issues.  This tv minimizes that by flex only at certain points. The only way to see it is if you put  a plain background up using your pc (higher bpp). I only saw 3 bend points.+Plus for this tv is as long as there is a image on screen uniformity is not an issue.Image Processing As with most older signals don't look good in hd.+However on both tv's the picture improved in a few days on it's own.One of these sources is vhs.Initially there was this commercial with a female with black pattern see through shirtat first looked funny. Few days later not a problem, even watch a program with same kindof shirt no issues (Rachel Ray 1 hour).My only and ongoing issue with the tv is pixels.1st tv dead pixels,  manufactured Dec. 20132nd tv stuck pixel,  manufactured Oct. 2013If resolved, I will go into detail about all the positives of the tv.Is it a good led tv no, it's a great led tv.Is it the perfect led tv, the perfect led tv doesn\u2019t exist yet.This tv has the best picture of 2013, if it was full array, perfection would be very close.", "Date": "March 8, 2014"}, {"Title": "Amazing TV!

Every time I watch the TV I keep saying to myself wow. I also compared this to the Sammy 65H7150 and there is no comparison. The 65H7150 blacks are not detailed. I just see a blub. Picture details is not there and the colors/contrast seems off. Picture does not seem to be natural. When I saw the Sammy 65F8500 plasma, its was a comparable to this TV.  Again I am just amazed on the design and quality of this TV. You get the best of both worlds. The best blacks from plasma and best vibrant colors.

I have been a loyal Samsung user for quite some time and have always thought they had the best picture on the market.  It was time to upgrade my 55inch Samsung 120HZ LCD which was one of the best pictures I have ever seen (especially at that time) and it was a little pricey compared to others 4 years ago but it was well worth it.  Because of this and other Samsung experiences I chose to go with the 65 inch F7100 model and I could not have been any less happy with what I received.The TV sound was awful, I could turn it to 100% and still not hear it 15-18 feet away in the kitchen.  I noticed instantly as soon as I mounted it on the wall and sat on my couch which is exactly 7 feet away that any glare on the TV caused it to show what I call \"Rainbow Circles\" or prism like effect all over the TV.  It was truly awful, any dark scene was ruined because of this odd glare.  When all lights were off the prism was gone but then I saw the cloudy blacks I have read about in other reviews.  All of this amounted to one unhappy customer.  I called Samsung and they were awful, not helpful, and rude.  Their answer was \"Turn off the lights\" and one rep claimed they know all about the problem with the glare but have done nothing about it.I then have it returned to Amazon which I must say was a breeze, Amazon was a class act and made the process extremely easy.  I then upgraded to the Samsung F8000 model hoping it would be better but in the end the Rainbow Glare was still there which made it impossible to keep.I then went to 3 different Best Buy stores to see if this was all Samsung models and sure enough it was as well as some other TV's.  I asked the reps and they said they never noticed but when I pointed it out instantly saw it.This Sony was the only model in that 2-2800 price range I didn't see the glare issues on so I then started reading the reviews and I must say, I agree with all of them.  I have had the TV for 2 days now and the picture is amazing out of the box before any tweaking.  I watched blu ray Star Wars and SpiderMan and they were amazing.  The online (wired connection) is fast and no issues I could see so far.  The sound is good but I have it hooked to a soundbar anyways.I am extremely pleased to have this TV over the Samsung and love that Amazon price matched it so I got it for 500$ less that what it would normally cost.A few small notes though, the power cord is the dumbest I have ever seen.  I mount everything and so needed to run the power before mounting and I had to unscrew a piece of the TV to remove the power cord and it is a non-standard power cable so I think that is a little odd.  They also only had one audio out option and it \"forces\" you to have all sound the soundbar.  I personally like to keep sound through the speakers for the actual cable box sometimes but this is really a minor thing for me but still a little bit of a pain.

I purchased the Samsung 64H5000 plasma from Amazon and was very happy with the picture quality and price, but the fact that it was essentially unusable in daylight made me send it back.  I really wanted at least a 64\" screen, which would have meant going up to the 64F8500 plasma set, but I couldn't justify approx $2600 for a TV that I might get the itch to replace in a couple of years if 4K takes off.Turning my search to LCD TVs, they all appeared to be more or less the same in specs and price at each tier.  I went to Best Buy to look at the TVs in person and was blown away by this TV.  I then read the review in Sound and Vision, and my mind was made up.  I took a gamble and ordered through Amazon warehouse deals and got a used TV at a considerable discount.  The description said it had some scratches on the front, which I have been unable to see while scrutinizing closely. It looked like he TV had never even been plugged in before.After getting the tv setup  I have been very very happy with the picture quality.  The blacks look legitimately black, probably not as good as a plasma in a perfectly dark room, but I never have a perfectly dark room.  The colors on this TV look way better to me than the plasma's, especially the whites.  I set the TV using the Disney WoW calibration disc, and also used the settings provided in the Sound and Vision review, both look good.I don't really care about the smart TV features, so I can't comment about that, but I did get a free year of Hulu Plus from it.  I was pleasantly surprised by the 3D function.  It is something I never thought I would use, but I watched 15 mins of Pacific Rim from Comcast On Demand, and the effect was pretty good.I would highly recommend this TV to anyone.", "Date": "April 25, 2014"}, {"Title": "Great TV.

I bought mine 2 weeks ago. I did have some motion blur issues till I found setting the motion flow option to smooth and the scene selection to general cleared it up. This sony puts out extra colors and has deep blacks equal to any plasma set I have ever seen. It uses a fast 2.2Ghz quad processor and has a fast input lag of 18 ms if your into gaming. This set can power on and deliver a picture to the screen faster than any set I have ever owned. I upgraded to the latest software without a hitch.. Nice bonus got Netflix and Hula plus free for 1 year to boot ! 0 percent interest for 24 months make sure you pay it off or you know ....I like watching 3D action movies. This set when on Vivid is very bright and easily compensates for the loss of brightness when wearing one of the 4-pair of active glasses. Not only that but I found out the colors look very true when watching 3D. I watched Avatar in 3D and it actually outperformed the movie when I saw it at the theater. This set has three picture levels, vivid, standard and custom. I have some picture options I use for this set listed under, sony-65w850a-reviews in these AVS forums. It made a huge difference.

The headphone jack is not located in a very convenient spot.There is a considerable lag time after switching the unit on before it can accept other commands from the remote.

BDP-S790) It does pair with this TV's remote, but still missing some functions, like load & eject, so you need another remote.\"The PS3 & PS4 will not give you as good a picture, so my PS3 is on my backup TV now! Big difference in quality of picture!\"I talked to several sources on this TV before buying. The Sony Sales Rep at Fry's Electronics, Abt Electronics, Best Buy, online stores, 3-local TV repair companies (*On reliability!),as I especially wanted a great price and a solid running unit. This was not my first choice. I was going to buy the Panasonic Plasma, but after circuitry problems, and them closing their Plasma line, I passed. I looked at Samsung's lineup, but after reading all the \"1\"ratings here on Amazon, and my own three bad Samsung Plasma TV's, before switching to Hitachi, I passed on them too. Just too much Chinese factory board problems.I called Sony commercial sales division, my dad use to own a TV & Appliance store, and they confirmed to me, that the price was dropped for the holiday only.I asked about a bigger 240hz like the 900A, I did not want a smaller TV, he confirmed that it was not going to happen in 2014! It is just too expensive at that sales to cost point.This TV is only 120hz, unlike the KDL55W900A, (*Which I would have bought, if it had been a 65\", I have a 67\" Samsung LED/DLP, and 14\" screen width is too much to lose.), which is 240hz, but having spent well over an hour looking at both TV's, side by side running at Fry's, with the Sony Rep helping run the same source material, I could not tell the difference.These two TV's have \"ACTIVE GLASSES\" for 3D, (*It took some work (*You have to pull out the battery usage drain protector plastic, then push the button with your TV in the big remotes top center *3D button pushed~use 3D side-to-side setting on)*Make sure you go in after watching your 3D movie and turn it off!!!!!!If you don't everything will be trying to upconvert it to 3D, and look awful-I did not read the book.) You have to wait for it to say on the screen, after you push the glasses button, it will flash and then the TV will say at the bottom paired with 3D glasses.***Connections~ Sony is a LEFT SIDE INPUT, Samsung is a RIGHT SIDE INPUT. You may need longer wires or to totally reconfigure your setup like I did, and it will be a work in progress for my main computer. I love this screen, just like my Samsung led 67\"DLP for a computer, with my wireless, Logitech K800 lighted keyboard, & G700 gaming wireless mouse. Relax from 10' away with a cold beer & in a recliner to be on the net.***PS3--- REMOTES ARE NOT COMPATIBLE! ONLY WITH REGULAR BLU-RAY OR DVD PLAYER. YOU CAN TURN IT ON AND OFF, SO KEEP YOUR PS3 REMOTE HANDY!I ran my 1st at home 3D, and it was not close. A huge improvement over what I saw at Frye's Electronics on the same media. Lighting, and more distance back, makes a huge difference in quality of picture. So, expect it to be better, especially with a great Klipsch home theater system, and a great Pioneer 3D receiver.I watched the 3D Harry Potter, which came with my PS3 again, and I have to say I could see stuff flying out at me 7' from the TV. Way cooler than the miserable passive glasses at the Regal Cinemas. They took them away for the new 4K TV's. You get the full 120hz in both eyes on this TV, and 240hz on the 55w900A.I came in ready to buy the 55W900A, but refused to drop 14\" in screen. I watched multiple materials on the 55W900A and their newest 4K 65\" with non-4K sports, and there was not enough screen variation to justify the $4500 cost, to get a larger size in 4K.If you are willing to go to just a 55\" then the KDL55W900A  is a better TV than this model. You will get a sharper and clearer picture, no question about it!!!This one is identical except they took away 240hz. This TV has an outstanding viewing area. I went over 10' on both sides with no visible distortion.I would say, the glare issue is close to Plasma. I would not buy this TV expecting no light reflection in a high light room. You will see reflections, not as bad as Plasma, but close. Plus, this TV has a really reflective, high polished chrome stand. Cover it up, windows, and lights off, and its fine. I have been using it as a computer monitor with a white background, and even with my north side big sliding glass door 8' away, I can see no reflection in the white background on Google chrome.  This TV only has less than 60-days of sales, so who knows.This TV does a great job with concerts. I watched a great video \"Joe Satriani Satchurated live in Montreal in Blu-Ray, it was great. The sharpness was great, the Fenders were so clear, I could even pick out Joe's individual hairs on his arm.Yes, it is not as great as the 55900A, but I don't regret buying this TV.**Now the remote is a true learning experience coming from Samsung TV's. Even my PS3 did not like this puppy. I had to have the PS3 rep help me get it paired, and I still don't know one of the main functions, and neither did the PS3 rep.***Put some names on these buttons, screw this color coded, multicountry, one fits all remote. They do give you a small player remote too. Just plan on either reading this whole manual, or calling tech support on this no name on remote functions.The button the PS3 wants to pair with, \"Is not labeled on this TV remote!\" So, I am still waiting for time to get around to be able to use all the functions, plus this remote won't scroll sideways all the way for some reason. So, I am still using my PS3 remote for movies. I did not pair it up as internet, since my PS3 just works, and I have a fast computer. Now if my Apple Airport Extreme had more than three miserable Ethernet ports, I could use it without having to plug and unplug my PS3.The KDL55w900A uses last years highest quality 4K model components, so it has a great track record. No one I could find did not give it a great rating.Be aware that Sony does not warranty individual pixel failures, unless they are in a big group. So, if you see them die in the first 30-days run, don't walk, to see if you can get them to change it out. That is the biggest problem with all LCD/LED TV's. Fry's electronics covers it, but their extended warranty requires you to give up your first born child. Not really, but it felt like it when they told me their price. As for Square Trade covering pixels? Their sales rep said they are now matching the manufacturers warranty, but are considering changing that warranty feature!PIXEL UPDATE: 12/6/13: Don't buy Sony's Extended Warranty!!! It does not come from Sony!!! They left out the Sony Pixel coverage below!! If you want an extended, check with Square Trade (*Get their pixel warranty in email writing!) ask for discount, or look for online coupon! Don't pay full price here!______________________________________________________SONY'S FACTORY PIXEL 1-YR WARRANTY!!Worrying about pixels, I spent 4-hours to get this buried deep source of information, on the Sony pixel warranty, from Sony's El Salvador call center.This TV has 8,294,400 pixels, and 0.01%, or 82,944 have to be dead to warranty. How big is that area? 4.97cm sq. area with black pixels (*Stuck is red,green,blue~If it is this color try programs to unstick it!)If the various internet U-Tube, or Disney programs don't free them up, it is a goner.I called Square Trade, & that rep, who said he looked it up, was giving me a load of bull. He said they use Sony's 1-dead pixel for theirs. I knew that was a load of bull after talking to the Sony rep at my local Fry's. Never believe it until you see it.This TV has no clearance for any Center Speaker, and I won't put any TV on the wall!!Why?\"\"It absolutely shortens the lifespan of the circuit boards!!\"They run hotter, because you are blocking the vent sources. I confirmed that with some TV repair friends, who see lots of wall mounted unit failures. The cooler your boards, the longer they will last. Give it a couple of small computer tower fans, the best cfm, & quietest are Scythe Japanese fans, it will last longer!So, after a day of research, I found, and bought this great Solid Kiln Dried Red Oak American Made riser, to put my Klipsch Center Speaker under the TV. It came with a \"GREAT FINISH\" matching my black Klipsch, plus it \"RAISED MY TV ABOVE MY FRONT SIDE SPEAKERS!\" I have a USA made solid Oak entertainment unit.I did not want another pile of compressed Chinese sawdust unit!!!Why?My new Chinese camlock unit \"EXPLODED IN THE MIDDLE OF THE NIGHT!\" My Samsung 67\" LED/DLP TV, PS3, cable box, component Klipsch system, and all my media, came crashing to the ground!I ran out to a bonfire size pile of broken free Chinese camlocks!

I'm writing this review just simply to give the TV the credit it deserves. Without much time spent on it, I will not go into the details other than the color reproduction.A week ago I bought the Sharp 60\" LE model for $900. The color reproduction is simply awful out of the box. I tried to adjust a little, but don't want to mess with it too much. Since the 60\" is a little small for my space, I decided to go with a 70\" inch. At first, I have my sight on the 70W850B, the 2014 version without Triluminous. Further research, I learned that he last year model 850A has Triluminous. I went to the store to compare the 2 and it's very obvious that the 850A has much, much better color reproduction.With such low price, I went for the 65W850A and can't be happier. Out of the box, this TV color is so accurate. Black is deep, not Kuro deep, but very deep. Popped in a musical blueray disc and I was blew away with the deep, rich, and accurate color. At first, I planned to do a side-by-side comparison with the Sharp but after popped in the blueray disc, I figured it would just a waste of time. There is no need to further compare.

Newer is not always better.", "Date": "June 1, 2014"}, {"Title": "Fabulous TV", "Author": "Techtool", "ReviewID": "R3AG00E53JIH0W", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Too bad Sony apparently has discontinued this TV.  It has a spectacularly good picture, with great contrast and superb color rendition. I can't detect any motion blurring (but football hasn't started yet), and the \"soap opera effect\" is easily defeated.  The internet connectivity features work just fine, and set up was very easy, though some of the setting nomenclature is Sonyese, but not too hard to figure out.  Viewing angle is OK for an LCD set. I would say that the picture, other than viewing angle, is possibly better than my Panasonic ST-series plasma, but it's in another place and I can't do a side-by-side.  On the negatives list are poor internal speakers, as in every flat screen I have seen/heard (quickly solved with a Klipsch sound bar), some lack of uniformity around the edges of the screen on a pure light background (unnoticeable in normal program content except for commercials with a lot of white space), and I find the  shiny chrome stand distracting. 3D, which I don't much like anyway and just barely checked, is, in fact, 3D, but I don't find it all that great in this set.  At its current price this set a rocking bargain.", "Date": "May 22, 2014"}, {"Title": "Best 65 inch LED TV", "Author": "RMM \"RMM\"", "ReviewID": "R2PW47ZRVQG6VW", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I bought this TV from BB and had the GS install the TV on  a Chief mount in my living room.

No problems whatsoever with the scheduled delivery. They unboxed and made sure the set turned on and then went on their way. Next was the fun part. The setup. I won't lie, I was hesitant ordering this set due to some of the known issues by some in various forums. My set has a Nov 2013 mfg date and doesn't show any picture irregularities. So relieved. Glad I went for it. Nice that it dropped in price.whitesands over at the avsforums has great simple settings for Vivid and Standard.Killer Instinct and Titanfall look great. 18ms lag time make gaming that much sweeter.

My complaint stems from Amazon.  When I ordered the TV in January, it was advertised as coming with a free Blue Ray player which I never received.  When I contacted Amazon to follow up & see why I didn't get it & how to go about taking care of that, I was told that it wasn't showing up as a current promotion & that they had no way to see promotions that were offered but aren't currently available.  Since they had no way to verify what I was asking, they said that there is nothing they could do.  I find that difficult to believe am extremely frustrated with Amazon at the moment!***Update- Amazon contacted me & explained that I needed to add the Blue ray player to my cart in order to receive it free at the time of purchase.  Since they're out of stock on that model of Blue ray player at present, they've credited me for its value so that I can use it to purchase another item from Amazon.
