The very next day after I purchased it the price went up to $350, but today the price is at $300.  So I'm not sure why the price fluctuates so much but you may want to wait for the price to be at the lower end.  Well anyways I received the TV yesterday so the delivery was a little over a week for a NY to CA shipment.  So far I am very satisfied with the TV.  It looks very nice and in my opinion is nice enough to be a Living Room TV.  I use as a tv in my room mostly for movies and my Xbox 360.  I must say the 720p is sharp and like the other reviewer said this tv can go up to 1080p.  There are a ton of ports for everything HDMI, VGA, etc.  Oh also the sound from just the TV itself is solid.  One complaint I do have however is the power cable length as it is very short about 4 FT maybe.  The question with these cheaper brand TV's is always gonna be longevity and to that I can't speak to yet.  But as of right now I am very satisfied with the TV and highly recommmend it.", "Date": "July 23, 2010"}, {"Title": "Too big of a compromise", "Author": "A simple man", "ReviewID": "R6F04EFKZB3H5", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I just returned this and got an LG-32LD350 instead and couldn't be happier. Here's why:1. The tuner was really bad. This is critical for me as I don't use a cable or satellite box.  a. Took about two seconds to switch channels.  b. For the digital channels, it had a hard time with the HD channels. Kept getting pixilated and lost the picture completely for CBS.  c. For the analog channels, the picture was noisier than it was with my old CRT set.2. The lowest volume setting was too loud - could be heard in the other room3. The TV wouldn't always start. Don't know what the problem was, but in the week I had it, we had to disconnect and reconnect the power cord to the wall outlet in order to turn it on.Needless to say the LG doesn't suffer from any of these and my wife thinks the picture quality also improved, but its hard to be sure. Bottom line - there are much better alternatives for roughly the same price.", "Date": "December 9, 2010"}, {"Title": "Excellent for the price", "Author": "Rick", "ReviewID": "R2CTRF6DBP762A", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I just purchased this TV for under $300.00 and am very pleased with it. I only have 2 minor complaints. The first one is that the remote control refused to turn off the closed captions. I had to change the settings on the cable box to turn it off. The second complaint is that the HDMI cables that I purchased on ebay would not work with this TV. They work fine with my other 2 flat screen TV's but not this one.

Hook up was simple with no problems.  The speakers were a bit tinny but adjusting the bass helped some. The picture was very good.  I was going to use it in office and it was perfect size. Both my wife and I thought for the price it was a good value.  It was on for the rest of day and evening but when turned on the next day the video came on for about 5 minutes and then went blank. We could not get to respond to anything. If turned off and back on it would last about 5 or 10 seconds and then go off. Only response I got from Colby C/S was to take it back.Before taking it back I decided to check out the other one purchased for our son.  It was WORST!  After about 5 minutes BOTH audio and video went out.  It would not come on using remote or manual controls.  So we ended taking both back.Maybe one could be a fluke, but two I believe indicates a major flaw with the TV'S.  When I took them back to Fry's I asked the person if they had many returns and he replied they did.  When I asked what seemed to be the problem he just said they \"didn't like them\".I purchased these largely on the positive responses here but it certainly did not turn out positive for us.", "Date": "May 7, 2011"}, {"Title": "Great Priice but had problems", "Author": "Roberts", "ReviewID": "R2HIDOKVT0K9B9", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "I bought this TV for $267 new which is an exeptional price.  I connected it to a Blu-Ray player with internet apps and the picture was great.  I then began watching cable TV channels and noticed that some channels would blink on and off and had intermittent static.  Thinking that the problem was with the Cable TV company I called out a tech.  He tested the cable TV and then stated there was a problem with the tuner in my TV.  I told him that could not be true because my TV was brand new.  I then connected a different TV to the same Cable TV source and I could not replicate the same problem using a different TV.  I went to the COBY web site and found that the TV has a 90 day warranty.  You must pay shipping both to and from COBY.  COBY requires a $30 shipping fee up front.  My best estimate is that it would cost me another $60 and tons of aggrevation to get this TV repaired.

I searched around a LOT and many of the TV's selling this holiday season (in this size/price range) had mediocre to bad reviews on sound, picture quality, life span, etc so I was starting to think I would have to go up a level in price.  However then I saw this Coby.  The reviews were good not only on Amazon site but elsewhere as well.  So I got it (only $300) and I couldn't be happier.  The picture and sound are great, easy to set up and very easy to use.  It's very nice looking as well (doesn't look cheap) and we have been loving it.

It was easy to set up initially and just as easy to convert from my standard cable to a High Definition cable box.I'm as impressed with the picture (and sound) quality of the unit in my bedroom as I was in the restaurant. My only gripe is that there's no headphone jack to accomodate quiet viewing when I want to watch late night shows while my wife sleeps (or vice versa). I'm still hoping to find a way to accomplish that.The Amazon price was right and the delivery was timely.

After the 90 days (still within the year warranty) Coby will only take care of parts, so you will have to take it to a repair shop for them to do the labor.

I purchased it around November 2010, and have had it for two months now. Well, this Coby LCD has been giving me nothing, but pure joy. The one thing I will say about this TV is that it is more of a TV for gaming and watching files, dvds and blue-rays off a computer or a blu-ray player. For gaming, I have a Xbox 360 and PS2 hooked up to it. For just viewing videos and pictures I have a computer and a dvd player. Some people have said that the TV was too dark of a screen for gaming, but most games have an option that lets you control brightness, so it's not the TV, but just your gaming system. I have not hooked it up to an antenna, dish or cable, so I can't tell anyone on how it works with any of those connections. I do like that it has three HDMI connections, which made this the TV to get.The remote itself does what it's intended to, but you can get a universal one, if you feel that you need something better. For one thing, don't expect this TV to be like your other top of line LCD TVs out there. You can control brightness, contrast and such, but not on game systems, because they control a lot of that for you.

Reichert", "ReviewID": "R2MOARPHZN5M68", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "Let's face it. You buy this TV because you can't afford a better one. I think the reason it's so cheap is that it's the only way they can sell it.1--- The only redeaming quality is the picture. It's good most of the time. It does flicker now and then when changing (cable) channels.2--- The sound quality is atrocious. There is absoulutely no mid or low range and there is no audio out connection. So you can't connect it to surround sound.3--- The connections are really difficult to get to. They point down and are flat against the back. Even connecting HDMI was a chore trying to find the slot. You can't see it unless the TV is upside down. So you have to feel your way around it.4--- The HDMI connections are sensitive. Wiggle the cables and you'll lose the signal. Don't use the rotating stand of the TV (one of the cool qualities) or you'll lose the signal.5--- THAT FREAKING BLUE LIGHT!!! You can turn it off when the TV is on but when the TV is off, it comes back on. At night, in bed, it lights up the whole room. I'm not exagerating. Do a Google search for Coby TV Blue Light and you'll find other annoyed owners with the same issue. They say there's a fix. It's not true. At least not for this model. You can cover it up (with tape) but then guess what? The remote won't work. Do not buy this TV for the bedroom.Negative, I know. But honest, too.

Jenks \"Wizard\"", "ReviewID": "R2K56HBPETCF87", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I purchased this TV at a local Supermarket (Shoprite) in August 2012 for $199.99 plus tax.  The first one would not turn on, either by remote or manually.  So I exchanged it for the same thing.  This one turns on when it feels like it, often I have to unplug it and plug it back in, to get the switch or remote to work.  I sent an Email to Coby support, and the first email was answered right away.  But all they said was basically to return it to where I bought it or send it in.  Here is where you need to pay attention: Warranty states 90 days for labor, 1 year for parts.  TV's UP TO 32\" MUST BE SENT TO COBY IN GEORGIA, ON YOUR DIME EACH WAY.  TV's over 32\" in size  qualify for \"in home\" repair.  Shoprite has a 30 day return policy.  I then sent a 2nd email to Coby support, asking them if this was a common issue with this model.  They never bothered to reply.  The first one was missing the RCA cables that were supposed to be included.  The second one had the cables, but the all important thumb screw that mounts the stand to the TV was missing.  I found something in my workshop that worked.  Being used as a computer monitor, this set works pretty well.  I don't think a 32\" monitor can be found anywhere else for $200, so I took a gamble and kept it.  Even with a modest video card, my pc puts out a good picture with this TV. I'm using Windows 7 Pro x64 with an inexpensive Radeon HD 6450, the video card has 1GB of DDR3 and it's fanless.  It supports Direct X 11 and puts out 1080p.  I used a VGA x VGA cable at first, then sampled HDMI x HDMI.  After a little time tinkering between the tv settings and the video card software (Catalyst Control Center), the best picture quality is being obtained with a DVI to HDMI adaptor cable.  The fact that one could easily have a dual 32\" monitor setup for around $400 is interesting, but right now I don't have a need for dual monitors.  I don't play games.  I have my fingers crossed with regard to the on/off issue, that it doesn't get to a point where it won't come on at all.  Can't remark on the tuner or speakers, I don't use them, or have not tried yet.  But the 3 HDMI ports are handy, and the composite input could be useful.  CAVEAT EMPTOR!UPDATE: 11/11/12  We just went through Hurricane Sandy.  Our house is on high ground so we did not get flooded, but power and cable was out for a week or so. When it finally came on it was knocked out again by a snowstorm!  We used a small portable generator to run the refrigerator and this TV with an omnidirectional antenna.  It worked surprisingly well, picked up as many channels as the other TV would.  The ON/OFF situation hasn't worsened, it's just a little finicky.  You have to give it a few seconds to work, or try a few times.  Some times it comes on with the first try.  With so much damage to the power and phone and cable TV lines from the high winds, it seemed an awful long time to get power back. You couldn't really go anywhere, and even as the roads were being cleared of debris, it was nearly impossible to find gas.  This TV helped keep us from losing our minds.  The stations out of New York City (45.6 Miles away) all came in perfectly.  The news was all about the storm.  It was very sad to see how many people lost their homes.  We were fortunate not to have any significant damage to ours.  Atlantic City, near where the storm made landfall, is only 50.4 miles South from our home on the Manasquan River.  So I'm glad I kept the TV!", "Date": "October 20, 2012"}, {"Title": "Try not to run in 1080p...", "Author": "S.

As soon as you hit the power button, the blue power LED goes out and nothing else happens. The only remedy we found was to unplug it and immediately plug it back in, and it works. Not sure how long the TV would last doing this, there is obviously something wrong with it and could cause it to stop turning on completely in the future.Since it is only a week old, we are returning it to Best Buy and hopefully can get a replacement that works. If it does the same thing, then I will have to reduce the stars I gave the product. Hopefully this is not that common and I just happened to get one of the lemons.

I don't really like it but it's ok for a spare room or bedroom if you are not too concerned with picture quality or volume. This tv is absolutely not for those looking for high quality (or even middling) HD movie or game playing.Pros:- This tv is a very light flat screen lcd. It can easily be carried around to multiple rooms and has a relatively low profile for sitting on a dresser or desk.- It has 3 HDMI and 2 Component for HD sources. The built in tuner works fine for me with an antenna. Depending on your reception and location this can vary.Cons:- The picture quality is passable. In my eyes the colors are not accurate, I see a red push. Blacks are not very deep and combined with a bad viewing angle the picture looks washed out almost everywhere you sit. Movies and games with dark scenes are very hard to watch or play. There are not a lot of options on the set that would help you mitigate any of these problems.- The picture is not very sharp. This is especially evident with console gaming. There is lots of blooming and it reminds me of playing on a traditional SD tube tv. Also this set is not 1080p. It my be able to take a 1080p signal and downconvert it to 720p, but you are not viewing a true 1080p picture.- The volume is incredibly loud. Even on the lowest possible setting this tv will be too loud for discreet viewing if you have spouse or roommate who is trying to sleep. There is no audio out either, so no chance for you to hook this up to a stereo receiver or home theater receiver.- The HDMI ports are recessed behind a plastic cut-out. What's the big deal? The cut-out is very narrow and many HDMI cables have a head larger than the cut out. This ensures that the male end never completely plugs in flush to the female end. Some cables I am not able to complete the connection. With others I have to apply force and wiggle until I finally get picture and sound. The connection is not very secure and sometimes falls out.If you can get this tv relatively cheap it may be worthwhile for you as a backup or second room tv. Anything more than $249 and you should probably save your money. At the writing of this review you can probably find a better alternative for about the same price this set is currently being sold at on Amazon.
