On display at the electronic store it actually looked worse than my other LCD Samsung LN-3241D. After fine tuning and adjusting the picture, whether it was recent non-HD DVD's or HD content, with the 120Hz Motionflow, Pixar's Toy Story looked 3 dimensional, and the colors were nothing I had seen before from this DVD. I am so happy with this purchase and the higher price tag is well worth it. I also watched a streamed Netflix movie (Amadeus), using the PC input, and the movie quality was ok. With the Samsung the streamed quality is noticeably not as rich in color and a bit grainier. I Recommend this LCD TV. Sony is definitely the leader in high end TV's.  P.S.

The unenhanced contrast ratio is tops (if you study all the spec stuff, this means BEFORE they use the electronic make-it-look-better circuitry) and it really shows with a good signal. Sony makes cheaper 32\" models, and this is their flagship model. It cost a bit over $1100.It took 3 days to get it out of the warehouse and get me a tracking number and an email that said it would be here in 8-10 days. The freight company called me 2 days later and delivered the next day. The freight driver helped me get it out of the box and told me to keep the box until I was sure it was A-OK as he said another shipping retailer (Crut*******) wouldn't accept a return without the original box. The set was in perfect condition, all the little stuff (cords, remote, cable gizmos, etc.) was there, manuals in english and spanish (maybe french too, it's a world economy now, eh?), etc. etc. No evidence it was other than a grade A straight from the factory brand new \"first\" (Tig** Di**** sometimes sells refurbs, seconds, etc.).Took me a while to get it set up and figure it all out - I called Sony customer support 4 times getting all the home theater sound, DVD, VCR, HD satellite dual DVR stuff going. I am pretty techie but these things involve new connection types and the manual gives you the simple dumbed-down diagram that shows a picture of the set connector bay with cords going to various pics labelled DVD, VCR and a one sentence explanation. Sony support spoke good english and when questions ran off script they put me on hold and went and asked someone who knew more to find me an answer. Wikipedia helps too <grin> Sony support were more than willing to stay on the line with me and take me step-by-step through the hookup and trouble-shooting. Didn't think I'd need that, but these things are way more complicated than the old stuff from 10 years ago.I really liked the fact you could set up the TV on-screen input selector with labels that actually indicate what each input IS from (DVD, Satellite, cable, VCR, game, computer, etc.) and set the selector to NOT display (skip) unused inputs as you scroll through the inputs. My wife will probably be able to learn to actually run this setup by herself after a while. Hooray!I had a 24\" TV before this, and it is nice to be able to see a movie again without my picture being shrunk down with top and bottom bars to a 16\"-set-size picture. The HD is really clear, but even my plain vanilla DVD player (non-blueray) with the red-blue-green discrete video outputs make movies look really awesome. The Sony has a special converter to change the frame rate from the TV rate (30 per second) to the Motion picture rate (24 per second) which makes everything CRYSTAL CLEAR!!!I was a bit uneasy about ordering a big ticket TV from Amazon, but I'd do it again in a second.", "Date": "October 3, 2007"}, {"Title": "Ahhhhhh ...

I decided to splurge on this TV after considering lesser options and even older Sony 32\" models and I'm glad I did.  The 120hz refresh rate combined with the Bravia engine gives amazingly smooth motion for sports and action movies.  The color reproduction is great - I'm a stickler against bad skin-tone reproduction (just visit your nearest big box store to see loads of large screen junk with orange people).I am a big fan of smaller screens, by the way - in today's HD world I think that 32\" - 40\" at most is the current sweet spot.  Stretching available pixels any father dilutes the quality in my mind.  So if you don't have a McMansion and you can handle a smaller screen consider this TV - it is so vivid that it betrays it 32\" size by the way; you would swear it's a 40 incher.", "Date": "September 9, 2007"}, {"Title": "The one and only", "Author": "Gadget MD", "ReviewID": "R1XIDEIRTMBLII", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I am a big fan of Sony video products.

I wanted to use the TV as my PC monitor as well so I was interested in knowing about how different brands handled the hookup.  Most of the sales folks knew almost nothing about PC compatibility but I finally found a geek who could help me.  I was going to buy the Sharp Aquos until my wife saw the Sony right next to it and she thought the picture was much better.  It also appeared that hookup to my PC would be easier with the Sony (the Sharp Aquos had no PC input and would require a conversion cable).  Anyway, it was the picture quality that sold us on the Sony.I finally ended up getting the display model which was $300 cheaper than an out of the box set.  I also bought an extended warranty.Hookup to my PC was easy using the standard SVGA 15 pin cable which comes with the TV.  For hookup to the cable box, you must use component-in or HDMI. The cable guy used a component-in cable (only thing he had with him).  But later I purchased an HDMI cable from an Amazon supplier and now use the component-in cable for my DVD player.  The picture quality with HD programs using the HDMI cable seems only slightly better than component-in.  With non-HD programs, there is no difference at all.I am very impressed with this TV.  The colors are absolutely vibrant--I've never seen anything better.In retrospect, I might have bought the 40\" model instead (which is 1080P) but I had to compromise due to the size of my room and the fact that I am using it as a PC monitor as well.  But I do recommend that you get the largest screen size you can handle and afford.As another reviewer commented, being able to label inputs makes things really simple when choosing between your various components.  Of course, if you hook it up to a complete entertainment system, this feature diminishes in importance since you could choose your input with the receiver remote or, even better, a universal remote.The PIP is not really useful for me at this point since I am relying entirely on the cable box for my TV signal.  With this TV, you cannot choose PC as the large picture and have an HDTV signal running in a small window unless the signal is from an antenna.Bottom line from all this is that if you want and can afford the best HDTV, this model is at the top of the list.", "Date": "October 14, 2007"}, {"Title": "Faulty Panel Assembly", "Author": "Colts Fan", "ReviewID": "R3TUH78A4GV9R2", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I had this TV for 1 year and 10 months with no problems until a few days ago.

HD programming (via cable) looked fantastic and regular TV was pretty good.  The sound level was a little low on TV channels but higher on DVD.HOWEVER, I have since exchanged my old cable box for an up-to-date model that upconverts regular TV to 720p or 1080i, via an HDMI connection.  As an aside, this fixed the volume problem on the cable signal, but the TV picture itself is absolutely stunning.  Even on the cable channels that used to look terrible.  I set the cable box to upconvert to 720p, which is this TV's native format, and I can honestly say that it makes regular TV look like hi-def used to on my old HDTV!  Hi-def itself is unbelievable (cable & satellite broadcast HD in 720p, so it's a perfect fit for this TV).The Motion Enhancement control (what you get because of the 120Hz capability), when set on \"high\", makes everything look a little unreal, like a hi-def CCTV feed.  It's a bit off putting.  I leave it at the \"standard\" setting and it's fine.  I suspect that the 120Hz capability will become more useful when I invest in a Blu-Ray player (now that the format battle seems to be coming to an end with Blu-Ray winning), but at this point I cannot say if it is a must-have or not.  In the meantime, I've ordered an upconverting DVD player (Philips DVP5982 1080p Upscaling DVD Player) and hope that will give me the same boost in picture quality that the upconverting cable box did.Bottom line:  The set-up and menus are a breeze, the sound (now that I'm using HDMI connections) is great and the picture is pure joy.

It was a bit on the large side and I had to angle it into my entertainment center. The viewing angle is good, though, so this was not a big deal. The worst thing about this TV is that the remote has to be almost centered and in front of the TV for before the set will react to it. I have often lain on my sofa with one arm outstretched to find the sweet spot where the remote works. Really poor design. The sound is very good and I never added additional speakers. There are plenty of HDMI ports and the ergonomics are generally good. Unfortunately, the jack for headphones is on the side, so I was never able to use it as the side of my entertainment center blocked it. Finally, in 2012 a single vertical line developed about two inches from the right side of the set, but it is intermittently apparent, only when watching cable. It does appear when I watch DVDs, video cassettes, or ROKU channels. I really don't find it too distracting, but suspect the days of this set are numbered. At 6-7 years old this is really old technology now, so I am replacing it with a 32\" Samsung LED 1080p smart TV that uses much less power, has current features and, though it has the same size display, will fit into my entertainment center with room to spare, and for less than a third of what I paid for this TV.

I could have had a 1080pi with a beautiful picture for less money, but I am counting on the Sony reputation for quality..Possibly foolish.", "Date": "January 17, 2008"}, {"Title": "Only one coax connection?", "Author": "Flasch", "ReviewID": "R1G6K70N0E5LOD", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "The picture is great on this TV and there are a lot of things I love about it.We watch both cable & over the air HD. In our bedroom we don't have a cable box and only have a connection to cable via a coax cable. To switch between cable & over the air antenna HD signals we have to use and manually change an AB switch since there is only one coax input on the TV. This makes it very cumbersome to change these input soures. I guess we could just bite the bullet & rent another cable box from the cable company for $12/month and then use the HDMI connection.", "Date": "August 31, 2007"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "Unavailable", "Features": "10-bit 16:9 HD Resoluton Panel (1366x768)\nMotionflow\u00bf with 120 Hz High Frame Rate Technology\nBRAVIA Engine\u00bf EX & Live Color Creation\u00bf feature\nDMex compatibility\nFull HD 1080p Inputs - HDMI\u00bf(x3), YPbPr(x2), PC Input", "Name": "Sony Bravia XBR KDL-32XBR4 32\" LCD HDTV", "ImgURL": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41w1ULZn8QL._SX300_.jpg", "ProductID": "B000RUNZVO"}}
