I'd been searching for an HDTV for almost a year and a half, and when I found this one, i knew the search was over! Not only was i looking for a TV that would be \"top of the line\" in its technology, ablilities/features (it even has a PC input for computer link-up!), and most importantly its picture an sound quality, i also wanted a TV that would compliment any modern-looking room or apartment with a great looking, modern design. When I got this TV it not only had everything i was looking for in its features and abilities, it was gloriously beautiful in every way! With its stunning picture and design, this HDTV truly brings the \"television set\" into the 21st century in a big way! This one comes stock with its own bragging rights! I would give this one 6 stars if I could. You can't go wrong with this one my friend, its absolutely amazing!", "Date": "April 17, 2005"}, {"Title": "SUPER", "Author": "James B.

LET ME TELL YOU ,YOU WILL BE HARD PRESSED TO FIND A MORE CLEARER PICTURE IN A PLASMA TV. AS A MATTER OF FACT THE STORE I BOUGHT IT FROM, IT WAS SETTING RIGHT BESIDE A PLASMA SET AND I COULD NOT TELL THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE PICTURES. IT IS ALSO A BEAUTIFUL TV, IT REALLY MAKES A STATEMENT WHEN PEOPLE COME IN AND SEE IT FOR THE FIRST TIME. IF YOU WANT A WORRY FREE HD EXPERIENCE, AND ONE THAT YOU WILL NOT HAVE TO WORRY ABOUT AND ALSO NOT PAY THE PLASMA PRICES, ESPECIALLY FOR A 52 INCH WIDE SCREEN HD , LOOK NO FURTHER", "Date": "December 21, 2006"}, {"Title": "Worth Keeping", "Author": "Jerry K. Proctor", "ReviewID": "R1VAUSODUO2Q0G", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I've had this television for about 9 years. I had to have a board replaced in it which cost me a few hundred bucks but all in all this has been a great television. It has over 12,000 hours on it! The blacks on it have never been very good but the colors are outstanding. I almost wish it wasn't so good, that way it would make my decision to go buy a new set much easier. The design is awesome. I love the pedestal that it is on and also the side racks that came with it as special order.  It hooked up easily to my surround sound system.", "Date": "October 7, 2013"}, {"Title": "Withstands the test of time", "Author": "M. Clark \"Nerd Alert\"", "ReviewID": "R3NR0ED9S4JILF", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I've been using the HLP5685W for almost ten years now and could not be more pleased with it. DLP technology is still commonly used in projectors, but DLP TVs have mostly disappeared. However, they have some significant advantages which have led to me keeping this set over purchasing an LED LCD or Plasma in recent years. In particular, the ability to replace the DLP bulb (and color wheel if needed) means that the TV can be kept as crisp and clear as it was when it was brand new even ten years later. I know from having other LCDs and Plasmas that this is not true for them.In 2004, when this set was released, it was the cutting edge. It has VGA, DVI, multiple component inputs, and a single HDMI port. It is not a \"smart TV\", because back then they didn't exist! But it has served me very well for watching sports, Blu-rays and playing videogames. It is also flanked by very high quality speakers--so good that I simply stopped using my 5.1 system because it wasn't worth it!The only drawback, in my opinion, is also one of the benefits. That sounds odd, but I'm speaking of the pedestal. If your system and area you'll have your TV in can accommodate the footprint of the pedestal, it's very convenient to have it so that you don't have to worry about buying a shelving unit or hanging it on the wall as you do with a flat TV. However, if you don't have space for it, that can be a problem. Make sure you have a good space for a TV like this.Anyway, even nearly a decade later, I still think this is a great TV. I just recently replaced the bulb and the picture is crisp and bright--I love it! I don't feel like they make 'em like this anymore. It feels like consumer electronics and TVs in general are not built to last this long these days. It's unfortunate, but makes me all the happier to own this model.", "Date": "March 17, 2013"}, {"Title": "Samsung DLP tv should be recalled for defective dmd chip", "Author": "flbuttercup", "ReviewID": "R2VGESBDBABME", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "Want to pay thousands of dollars for a tv that has white spots all over the screen?
