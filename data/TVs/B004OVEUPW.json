{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Well balanced and well worth it", "Author": "S. Phibber McGee", "ReviewID": "R3TDAW112JL412", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I did considerable research before buying this TV. I had a wish list of features that the wife and I had come up with plus constraints on my budget and the physical size of the TV due to existing space within our entertainment center which was of the pre wide screen era.While we had to compromise on several of our wish list features ( Internet connectivity to access things like Pandora most notably) the items we did not get seemed to be pretty much standard across the 32\" size selection and apparently only available in the region of 42\" and above.I had occasion to visit LG's website to attempt to determine info that was not shown in the Amazon description and was very pleased with the support LG offers even in just looking at their TV pre-buy. I had a real time chat with one of their CSRs who was able to get me the info I was looking for immediately and make several alternate suggestions.The longest portion of my set up time was assembling the base and attaching it to the TV. The instructions are extremely clear and set up is a snap.We were initially somewhat dismayed at the sound quality and its apparent loudness as we are not using a surround sound system with it as yet. However after a little exploring of the extensive set up menus I located some sound configuration selections and by changing several of those made a huge improvement in the sound quality. The fact that in order to locate these setting I had to spend a great deal of time exploring and fumbling around as opposed to them being part of the set up wizard that you run the first time out is the reason for my 1 star deduction off the Ease of Set Up category.Our seating arrangement is ideally spaced for a 32\" TV and the picture is extremely clear sharp and bright at the recommended distance. We love the auto brightening and dimming feature of the display to match ambient room light. A minor note about this is that the sensor used to monitor the ambient room light is extremely sensitive to the point where a scented tea light votive candle burning more than 15 feet way from the TV and behind the viewing area was driving it nuts attempting to read and compensate for the room lighting until we moved it.In terms of \"bang for the buck\" and quality we are so pleased with this TV we are strongly considering getting a second one for our home office to do double duty as TV and computer monitor.", "Date": "July 16, 2011"}, {"Title": "Great TV, but first one had defective sound", "Author": "Cait B.", "ReviewID": "R120JIG0PT1JFE", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "We have a 60\" LG plasma in our den, which we love, so when I needed a smaller TV for the home gym, I bought this 32\" model.  It's got a great picture and it's easy to set up, and with a Roku it was cheaper than similar \"internet TVs\" that come with the streaming stuff (netflix, hulu, etc) built-in.  So for the price and the quality, it was just what we wanted.  However, after about 20 minutes of being on, the sound would fizzle once and then intermittently cut out.  It was almost like a feedback loop, once it started, the sound would cut out faster and faster until it just stopped working altogether.  At first we thought it was the Roku, so we exchanged the Roku box for a new one, but it was still happening, and we tried a jump drive, and some other ideas, but eventually realized that it was the TV sound cutting out.  We returned the TV for an exact replacement and have been very happy.  But if yours does the weird sound cutting out thing, exchange it for a replacement!", "Date": "August 21, 2011"}, {"Title": "Our first flat-screen TV", "Author": "Gary Speer \"gspeer9\"", "ReviewID": "RZ0QUA46EUTWA", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "This is our first flat-screen TV, and we bought it because LG was recommended to us by a young man in a Big Box Store who seemed knowledgeable after we'd asked him about 20 minutes of specific questions. This particular model seemed to have the best combination of features and price we could afford.We've been quite pleased with it. The setup was very easy (once our son came by and helped us move out the gigantic, heavy old-fashioned RCA set we were replacing) and it did well out of the box. Once we upgraded our Dishnetwork setup to HD and hooked it up, the picture quality both in HD and SD (it's fun learning all this new video lingo) seems excellent.The only complaint we would have is that the sound system seems noticeably lower in volume than we would like when we're playing anything on the DVD, DVR or Roku systems. I don't hear any distortion, it just requires turning up louder than I would prefer in order to get adequate volume.Overall, we're quite pleased with the set and especially at the excellent price we got on it through Amazon.", "Date": "June 18, 2011"}, {"Title": "Great Buy!", "Author": "Bassman6661", "ReviewID": "R1EO3HEFTFYYKB", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Bought this tv a little over a month and a half ago and I have to say first off I love it. The picture quality is amazing, the sound is good for flatscreen speakers, and it has some pretty sweet features. For example, normally to watch a movie I'd need to hook up my computer with an hdmi cable,  but if you have the movie file on your computer you can just throw it on a flash drive and plug it right into the tv since it has a usb drive on the side of the tv.

I paid only $332, which is great. Picture is stunning! The picture wizard setting allows you to get the best picture for that movie you're watching or game you're playing. Also, this tv does have 1080p picture capability. Sounds pretty good too! But you can always get a sound bar or system if you want more out of it. It may not be as thin as an LED but it's not a big deal. Remote is fairly basic, but I like it. Screen burn in is very unlikely with this LCD tv, unlike a plasma which you have to be extra careful not to leave it paused for too long. (We have one) You won't regret purchasing this tv.

I was looking for a decently priced 32' model for my college dorm room and tried out the Samsung, which lacked way too many features. Since purchasing this LG 32LK330 model I've been really happy. The ambient lighting sensor doesn't bother me because I turn if off anyways. I mainly use the 720p for my Xbox and it's perfect and crisp with the graphics (a lot of games aren't even displaying full 1080p anyways). I expected the sound to be tinny or lower quality because of this smaller model but was surprised that it was a lot better than my previous Samsung that I mentioned. I love the fact that the user interface of this LG tv is easy to use with adjusting sound and picture settings if you are unsatisfied with the default standard settings.On one side of the tv, there is 1 HDMI input, 1 AV input, 1 headphone jack and a usb 2.0 input. These were easy to access and you can watch movies from your usb. On the back you have 2 more HDMI, 1 component input, audio in and an optical out the vga input (for PC input). Overall I was pleased with all the inputs because it has all the basic things you need if you want to use a surround sound system or have other game consoles and dvd/bluray players. It was also nice that this LG model was on a swivel base. The base is still a bit wobbly after tightening it from installation, but I have no problem as long as it doesn't fall apart. All in all this model is a great model for being under $300. It serves its purpose well if you are just looking for a small tv or just casual/game tv.", "Date": "January 17, 2012"}, {"Title": "Affordable fantastic buy!", "Author": "JK's girl \"Scullery Maid\"", "ReviewID": "R2E0MUFB5JKVJQ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "My 32\" LG TV was a steal!!!

I purchased the TV for my parents.  There was quite a substantial motion blur with this set (even with the DVD player) and the edges of the images seemed to \"vibrate\"  The controls were intuitive, but I could not tolerate the picture. I'm not sure if I just got a bad set.  I bought a more expensive HDMI cord in hopes that it would improve, but to no avail.  I had to send the TV back.

Most of my viewing consists of sports, news, movies and some network and cable programs.And I'm an HDTV newbie. This LG LK330 replaced a 6-year-old Sony Wega, which was an excellent tube TV with a crisp picture and rich sound using DirecTV.Thus, the LG is my first step into the HDTV world, and my second LCD. We have a Vizio in the bedroom.Before buying the LG, I did considerable research, reading volumes of expert and user reviews on various sites and I compared specs and prices, eventually narrowing my search to the LG, Vizio and Panasonic. I went with the LG because, according to my amateur analysis, it offered the best combination of value and features.And when the Amazon price dropped I pulled the trigger.This TV was easy to setup. The instructions were clear and the remote took only a couple of minutes to master. I spent some time experimenting with the different video and audio settings to see and hear the differences and settled on the default standard settings.Right out of the box, the LG produced a good picture and sound with non-HD service while I waited a couple of days to get my DirecTV service converted to HD.With my new HD service, this LG really shines, and the 2-year-old Vizio in the bedroom is also a winner. While the color, definition and clarity on both sets are top-quality I have a slight preference for the LG, but this is totally subjective.I had read a few negative reviews about the sound, but my experience has been the opposite. The sound is distortion-free, exceptionally clear and the volume capability is more than I will ever use. Last night I watched a Tony Bennett performance and the sound quality was outstanding.Also, LG's Picture Wizard sensor and energy-saving option are worthwhile functions, producing a crystal-clear picture both in the dark and in a room filled with bright morning sunlight.This 32-inch LG is now our living room TV. While the room itself is large, the \"TV\" portion of the room has a seating  arrangement clustered around the TV, within a 7- to 8-foot distance of the screen and this works out perfectly.Overall, I'm quite happy with my new LG.", "Date": "January 28, 2012"}, {"Title": "Fantastic TV!", "Author": "$IDO@", "ReviewID": "R31A4DIS10ENA0", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "TV was very easy to set up, sound quality is great and so is the picture quality.

It came in the original box, which did have some minor rips in it, but that didn't impact the inside of the box when we opened it, the protective wrapping was untouched, (no rips in it). My husband put the stand together and he said it was very easy to understand the instructions in the booklet on how to do it, we also received all the needed screws to put it together. Before we took our huge 25\" old TV off the stand in the living room, we took the new LG to our bedroom and hooked it up to our antenna cable in there to see if it was going to work, (we don't have cable or satellite here, just a regular antenna).  We turned it on, went through the setup process, which for us was very simple and the TV did most of it by itself. When it got done scanning, we had channels on it, yes, the sound was low as read in earlier reviews, but also if you read all the reviews, some do tell you how to get that sound level up, which is going into the main, advance setup and adjusting the audio to the higher level, (also where you adjust your screen size, your clock, timer, child lock, etc). Since buying this and using it daily, we have not had any problems with this set at all!! It works great, the picture is very good, the sound once adjusted is good too, you don't have to turn it way up anymore once you make the initial setting in the advance setting area, (but we have noticed some channels do have lower volume then others), that is not the TV's fault though.  One of my biggest questions I had about the TV, (since we don't have anything but an antenna), was if we needed to use our digital box we had to purchase years ago, which was answered if you read all the reviews on, but the answer is no, you do not need the digital box to run this TV, it's made right into the set. It also picks up anything in the scan process that you might have hooked up to the set as well, such as cable and/or satellite, it even has a hook up for the computer, (which we have not used), but we have used the USB port to look at some pictures on the TV that I had downloaded into my flash drive, it read the flash drive as soon as I put it in.  The only thing I can comment on that I don't care much for is the remote control, the buttons are set pretty funny on there or it might just be me, but I'm always hitting the wrong button to try and mute the TV. Other then that, I have not found a thing wrong with it! I also went online to e-bay and found an extra remote for this TV so we both can have our own. I'm am very pleased with this TV we purchased, though some reviews weren't good, but we've had no problem out of ours. I would certainly recommend this set to anyone who is looking for a new digital TV.", "Date": "April 18, 2012"}, {"Title": "So far so good with a few caveats", "Author": "Bradford L. Geiger", "ReviewID": "R2L29RX1HXOQ83", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Just got this so I will update as I live with it. My first impression is that this is a solid tv for the price. This is best for a bedroom or second TV. It is relatively no frills compared to more expensive products but for watching HDTV it works well so far. The picture is quite good and the tv adjusts brightness automatically based on the light in the room. That seems to work well. Sound is just OK but again, plenty good for a bedroom. It is lightweight and easy to move. So far the menu's are pretty easy to use and intuitive.Two notes about set up. 1.the cord is short and does not reach from my cabinet to the outlet next to it. Easy enough to fix with a power strip or extension cord, but kind of annoying and cheap. 2. the manual is printed in tiny print and the illustrations are so small that assembling the stand was a mystery.  It was almost impossible to tell which way the parts fit together and then into the tv. Two of the screw holes are almost impossible to see or reach with anything but a long screwdriver. I got it together more from guess work than from the instructions.

With free shipping, no sales tax and a $40 credit card bonus, well, they came close to paying me to purchase.  I was a bit nervous about a few bad reviews, but even the very best TV's have negative reviews.  LK330 is a great set, nice clear picture, good sound, can't say anything bad, unless it burns out quickly.  Time will tell and I'll update review if I have an issue.

What is surprising is how little difference there is between the LG and the other two sets when viewing a 1080i program source. (We really can't tell the difference.) All three are excellent! The LG's automatic picture adjustment feature works well and makes setup simple.

It works, and the picture is good. It is what you would expect from a 720P. The sound is nothing spectacular but I have certainly heard worse. All in all, it is a very respectable unit.I do have a complaint in that the unit audibly heats up and cools down, by which I mean while it warms up (for the first 2 minutes or so) you will intermittently hear the case and/or inner components \"popping\" or \"cracking\" from heat expansion. Once it's up to running temperature everything is fine and there is no further noise. When you turn it off you get the same thing from the cooling. It seems like it is more of a nuisance than a real problem, however if any of this noise really is coming from internals then this unit will probably fail sooner as a result of all of the thermal expansion/contraction. I just don't know if that is the case or not. Only time will tell if this is a real problem, but by then it seems I will have probably gotten my money's worth out of it anyway.Maybe the newer units have fixed their heat sinks (or maybe not) so who knows what you'll get. For now, I have had zero dead pixels, zero problems with the lamps, and zero trouble with any of the inputs.I have a 47-inch LG TV downstairs that has been working like a dream for about three years now so I do lean toward LG in general, and performance-wise this smaller (budget) unit has held up just fine as well so far.", "Date": "April 23, 2013"}, {"Title": "LG 32LK330", "Author": "Thunderhed \"darkhed\"", "ReviewID": "R2RORJZUI21VI7", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I am very pleased with this TV.

We did a lot of research before deciding on this LG model. The price was great and the reviews all seemed to say this would be a good choice.  Set up was super easy.  We had to use the included stand until we have time to mount it on the swivel wall mount we purchased with it.  It does seem a bit unstable on the stand.  Way more wobbly than our other flat screen.  We're not what you would call tv snobs but we know and appreciate a good picture quality when we see one.  We have a Samsung 40\" 1080p LCD in our living room that has an amazing picture.  Before ordering this LG we went to BestBuy and checked out the picture quality there.  It seemed really good.  I'm not sure if they hook up the televisions there differently then we did at home but there is a drastic difference in quality.  I know 720p isn't going to be as good as 1080p but from all the reviews we read that shouldn't matter unless you are watching true HD signals.  is this not true?  The color on this LG is amazing.  Switching between different options is super fast and easy.  But on most channels the picture seems distorted and slightly stretched.  we tried all the different ratios and it didn't help.  We will call LG to see if there is something we can do to make it better but we might be sending it back.  Oh and bty, connection was through RCA cables, not HDMI.  Our cable box in the bedroom doesn't support HDMI.LG 32LK330 32-Inch 720p 60 Hz LCD HDTVAbove was our original review.  Since then we have experimented using a HD cable box that had HDMI outputs and that made a huge difference.  The \"standard\" cable box from Directv doesn't offer an HDMI output and is non-HD so we have ordered one so we can take full advantage of the tv. We have also since mounted to the wall mount and wow, what a huge difference that made.  We love being able to angle and swivel the tv to any preference we like.  It's also nice to swing it completely out of he way when not in use.

When it arrived I assembled the base and tv and plugged it in.  The picture was pretty washed out and blotchy.  I worked with the menu items and improved the picture somewhat but could never get rid of the pixalated edges.  It showed up mostly on the parts of the images that were at an angle, like a person's collar or between a commentators jacket and shirt.  It looked like hundreds of little stair steps instead of a straight edge.  Also, there was a ghost image (4 layers deep) to the right of the image. It most notably showed up when I hit \"pause.\"  The little vertical lines on the pause slide had several additional vertical \"ghost\" lines, to the right, in sequentially less vivid images.  I thought the problem my be due to my reception, but it did the same thing on a DVD program, so it had to be the tv.I called the LG number and spoke to a representative.  She said to unplug the tv and the antenna wire and plug it back in.  I did as she recommended, but nothing changed.  Therefore she said that's all she could do on the phone but they could contact a service rep in my area.  Supposedly the service rep would give me a call and set up an appointment to service the tv.  After three days of no contact, I called back and told the rep that I would like to return the tv.  He told me that they could not take the tv back, but that they were trying to locate a service rep in my area and would be able to do so in 3 to 5 business days.  I told him I no longer wanted a service rep, but wanted to return the tv for a full refund.  He told me that they could not take the tv back and would not refund the money.  (I've only had the tv 4 days.)I contacted Amazon.com, LLC and they agreed to take the tv back and refund my money.I appreciated the fact that LG answered the phone, but was extremely disappointed from that point on.
