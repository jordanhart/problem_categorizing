When they delivered this it was on the floor and my \"old\" 55\" was on the wall.  I swear it looked like I could grab the 55\" with one hand because this thing is so HUGE.  It's not light (over 100 lb.s) and it does take some tweaking to get the best picture (I'm not done yet) but talk about immersive television, this is like being at the theatre.  I decided not to wall mount it ( #1 it looked pretty good on the mantel, in fact it's about the same size as the fireplace and 2) I wasn't too sure the wall could hold it easily...!).There are a ton of settings to adjust and out of the box isn't the best, I'm using this with UVerse as well as Amazon FireTV.  It doesn't appear that the TV passes Dolby 5.1 through as an optical out (darn, but I have a workaround of splitting it before it goes in).  The HDMI ports are quite accessible (and less of an issue then getting to ones on other TVs I've noticed). WiFi works great.  Haven't quite found where you can update the firmware which I'd like to do.The apps are a neat idea.  One button push and you can get into Hulu or Netflix, unfortunately the p r o c e s s o r is s o s l o w you'll be there for 20 minutes just picking out a movie.  Too bad.  Maybe an update will correct his but it was pretty much unusable to me so I'll stick with an external device for now.Very happy with my purchase, the delivery company Amazon chose was fantastic, opened it up, set it up, tested it -- nice guys.Will update this once I've played a few more days.", "Date": "April 14, 2014"}, {"Title": "great picture quality bad delivery service", "Author": "Ted Thorne", "ReviewID": "RCQQR4HHTJAC1", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "amazing picture quality... great value for big screen.. wont find a better picture for price... have to read the online manual to be able to use and amazon app does not work at all just message will be available soon..  delivery was late by carrier and very poor delivery service...  do not believe what they say about them coming into your home and bringing it to point of use...  they drop at front door and want to plug in right there to prove it works..  but TV is excellent product", "Date": "March 23, 2014"}, {"Title": "3 Strikes & You're OUT! - TV gets DAMAGED in Transit 3 Times?!", "Author": "Christine Kane", "ReviewID": "R3E1T28G9QZMEB", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "We are giving this Vizio 80\" TV the lowest rating possible which is one (1). The reason for the low rating is because WE HAD TO REFUSE DELIVERY, NOT ONCE, NOT TWICE, BUT THREE TIMES because the TV is not packaged appropriately for any type of shipping/transport. Granted, the shipping company has some responsibility in that, since the boxes are very beat up by the time it reaches our house, (twice there were big holes punched in the box), but Vizio does such a POOR job of packaging to protect the TV, with very little styrofoam inside (only on the corner edges), and absolutely nothing in the front to protect the screen itself. The first TV actually had dead pixels, probably from being banged around in transit, so we refused delivery and had to order another one, and wait another week to get it delivered. This time, the box had a gash in the front of the box, a hole that went all the way through the cardboard box and it was pretty clear there was going to be damage inside. Sure enough, the screen was cracked and we had to refuse delivery once again. We were pretty skeptical and hesitant about ordering a third time, the frustration and disappointment of still not having a TV were getting extremely annoying, not to mention my husband took the day off of work for nothing! Amazon was at least helpful, friendly & apologetic, and we reluctantly decided to give it one more try. What are the odds of getting another damaged TV, three times in a row? Well, after waiting another 10 days this time, and my husband taking another day off from work, the TV arrived in a box that was in worse condition as the first two, and had a bigger hole in the side of the box. Not surprisingly, the TV screen was shattered and we had to refuse delivery once again. I'm not sure who absorbs the almost $10,000.00 price tag of 3 damaged TV's, but it's ridiculous that in almost a months time and three attempts, we still do not have a TV! We finally just had to ask for a full refund, as it appears there is no way this TV could ever arrive undamaged. Very Frustrated & Disappointed!", "Date": "April 10, 2014"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": null, "Features": null, "Name": null, "ImgURL": null, "ProductID": "B00HVX5OO6"}}
