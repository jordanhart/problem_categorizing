{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Great little HDTV", "Author": "Tony and Julie \"Tony and Julie\"", "ReviewID": "R3N36L38P4BI6U", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I purchased this TV from Costco locally where I live and I have been happy with it so far. The TV is very similar to the Samsung LNS2351D but lacks the Integrated over the air HDTV Tuner, and has a lower contrast ratio. This was no big deal for me because I don't receive over the air HDTV broadcasts where I live anyway and 3000:1 contrast ratio is better than most high end LCD HDTV's today. I use this TV with my Dish Network ViP211 HDTV receiver and it looks fantastic. The sound is decent and not too tinny. If I am not mistaken I believe these TV's were chosen by Microsoft to be used to show off the XBOX 360 at E3 2006 and at kiosks at your local video game retailer. The TV has one HDMI connector, 2 sets of component connectors, S-video, analog PC input w/ audio input. I use the HDMI connector to my Satellite set top box and I have a really nice picture. Not a lot of noticeable artifacting and nice clear picture. I've also connected my PC to this thing and it blows my other flat panel PC monitor out of the water. It is so bright and beautiful. I highly recommend this TV to anyone looking for a second HDTV for a smaller room or a really, really nice PC monitor.", "Date": "September 9, 2006"}, {"Title": "The Ultimate Gaming Monitor For XBOX 360", "Author": "M. Anderson \"Be Cool, Stay In School\"", "ReviewID": "R4K3HSM40J7ZP", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I went ahead and bought this set at Costco for $475 with a coupon and with the 100% satisfaction guarantee after talking to the video guy there. I had been using an older 20\" Toshiba flat screen CRT which was allright for getting the 360 system up and running. I decided to try this after finding out Microsoft used this same hdtv to demo their XBOX 360 launch last year. I plugged the Samsung in and connected the HDMI and setup the XBOX for HDTV at 720p and it was super easy. Worked right the first time with no hair pulling episodes. I had tried the game Gears of War on the old Toshiba and wasn't happy with it or the graphics. But, now after playing it on the Samsung, all I can say is WOW!!!! This is the perfect TV monitor for gaming. All the games, TDU, COD2 & 3, etc, are sooooo much better now. The AV connections are on the back of the tv, which I personally like and you can also use this tv as a PC monitor since it has that connection also. My next upgrade is to get a Klipsch 2.1 GMX sound system with powered sub-woofer for this bad boy. You can get a lot of advice from techies about tuner pixel refresh rate and all of that stuff, but take it from your average user, if you're looking for an all around great HDTV/gaming/PC monitor, this is the one that I recommend even being the SONY guy that I am.", "Date": "February 9, 2007"}, {"Title": "Samsung LCD HDTV is awesome", "Author": "Von Preussen \"kaiserlichehoheit\"", "ReviewID": "R3VJQCVJB3GCS3", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I have this Samsung 23\" LCD HDTV.  I purchased it for a Bedroom and Love everything about it.  I did alot of looking around at different brands etc of LCD Televisions and found Samsung had the best Picture Quality.  Also Consumer Reports said some good things about Samsung that impressed me...  I also had my Uncle who lives several houses down from me purchase a new Samsung Television.  His is a 37\" LCD HDTV...  The Quality that Samsung has been producing is awesome and also the Quality.I Love the Sound that the 23\" set produces.  It is so good and when I have a DVD playing it really makes a differance.I would recommend this Samsung Television to anyone looking for a good Set with high Quality Standards.", "Date": "August 13, 2007"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "Unavailable", "Features": "Built-in analog tuner (NTSC)\nBottom Built-in speakers\n1 HDMI Interface\nVESA compatible\nHD-grade 1280(H) x 720(V) pixel resolution", "Name": "Samsung LN-S2338W 23\" Wide HDTV Monitor with PC/DVD/TV Inputs", "ImgURL": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51XGN1YWKBL._SX300_.jpg", "ProductID": "B000G6300U"}}
