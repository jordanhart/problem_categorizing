Haven't used the EzSign software so can't rate that, but the TV's themselves have performed well for me. I've now installed over 20 of these over the past couple of years and they are sill working great. I've also done a few of the 55\" ones as well.", "Date": "July 1, 2013"}, {"Title": "Good Entry Level Digital signage display", "Author": "startrekkin", "ReviewID": "R3SZ59IY3BLMA8", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "This will be the second set I have used for digital signage.The Software is not intuitive and lacking capabilities that others have. You can't complain to much about \"free\" though.The set works well and has all the inputs needed for computer, component, HDMI and video. Even an onboard tuner canbe mixed into the USB signage playback.One glaring problem with the firmware is the NON ability to start playing from the USB drive upon startup.If I set the turn ON TIME, the USB source is not on the menu. So right now we are using the PC input so that no one has to touch a remoteor the display during the day.I hope LG can fix this problem. The consumer sets are even worse in that will only allow you to select a tuner channel and nothing more fromthe TURN ON menu.2yr warranty is a big plus for such a low cost set.For the right application, this set makes economic sense over a $2000 typical digital signage display.", "Date": "May 9, 2012"}, {"Title": "LG Electronics EzSign 42LD452B 42-Inch 1080p 120 Hz 1080p LCD TV", "Author": "Tonya Pate", "ReviewID": "R3KV7LM3K3AQZO", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Quality and clarity was perfect!
