I was slightly worried buying a product like this online but amazon could not have made it easier.  As far as the TV itself it's exactly what i would expect of a TV, i have not had any issues and the picture is great.  The sound is a bit odd (speakers face the back of the TV) but it doesn't really bother me.  Shipping was great too.  Thanks amazon!", "Date": "January 5, 2011"}, {"Title": "Not very good", "Author": "Robert", "ReviewID": "RUEW4B2VPQHXW", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I bought this TV a little over a year ago (black Friday). This is an honest review from someone who has watched Bluerays, broadcast TV, Netflix (through the networked (Ethernet) and PS3). I can tell you that even though this TV is advertised as a 240 Hz the motion is FAR from that. I have messed with the \"true motion\" and all the other settings and I can't get a smooth picture, and my standards are not that high. Even if you turn all the special settings on or off, you still get artifacts around people's heads, if that makes sense. Fast motion shots and games looks choppy and stutter. Not very extreme, but enough to be disappointed.Now for the reason I gave this set 1 star.This TV started to fail with about one month left on the one year warranty. The picture would start to freeze on any of the inputs (HDMI, Ethernet, Component etc.) It got so bad that I had to disconnect the power to reset the TV. Phillips had a tech come out and replace the main board. Sure as can be, 3 months later the same thing started to happen. I called Phillips and they are \"trying\" to get this to be covered under warranty, even though they pulled up all the case notes from when I called with this issue when it was under warranty.I'll let you know what happens with their tech support, but in summary, I would stick with LG, Sony or Samsung for a solid TV.", "Date": "January 10, 2012"}, {"Title": "Worth the Money!", "Author": "abc123", "ReviewID": "R3KSMODIX3R665", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This is a beautiful picture screen!

I choose this one based on other reviews and because of the 240 Hz.  The Picture is Great.  The Set up is super easy.  Watched the Super Bowl, and the NFC/AFC championship games on this HDTV.  Did not blur at all and the picture was excellent.  I have received a lot of compliments, as others are impressed with the picture too.", "Date": "February 20, 2011"}, {"Title": "Quality of picture is only good thing", "Author": "Alexander Kostromin", "ReviewID": "R3GXX39IWUX2M4", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "Quality of picture is very good especially dynamic parameters. When an object moves fast across the screen it does not become blurry. It is only good thing about this TV however. Spec says about angle of view: 178 deg, which is \u00b189 deg. Apparently it is a geometric limitation because raised frame does not allow it to be wider. In reality when angle of view goes beyond \u00b130deg picture becomes white washed which is very irritating. Aspect ratio is another problem. Even though there is AUTOMATIC aspect ratio in the menu it has never worked so I have manually to set up aspect ratio over and over once I switch a channel. Manual channel management is very primitive and underdeveloped. It is time-consuming tedious process when you need to set up channel(s) manually especially when there are over 100 of them. Lack of low frequencies (basses) in sound is normal for such a small design of audio system therefore I have attempted connecting a computer loudspeaker, but I found no 3.5mm jack which is standard for audio equipment. Only digital RCA audio output was there on the back nor I found mention of this jack in the manual. Thus I have to buy a special converter from digital to analog audio to be able to connect my existing audio system. When a manufacturer excludes the most standard thing from the design it looks to me a mockery. I am very much tempted to return this TV. I am only hindered by the size and weight of the package.", "Date": "May 29, 2011"}, {"Title": "Poor quality", "Author": "bean", "ReviewID": "R2ZSR8CVPY8MVP", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "We have a 50 inch Philips TV that like a million others has gone bad in the first few years. I highly recomend you research the complaints against this compay before you buy any of their tv's. If I had, I NEVER would have bought a Philips TV! The capicators go bad after a few years and will cause the tv to make a constant click sound and not turn on. This will most likely happen after the  warrenty is up so be prepared to shell out some bucks for a repair or a new tv because Philips will not do anything about it.
