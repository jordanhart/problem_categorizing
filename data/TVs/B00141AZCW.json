{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Nice tv for small rooms!", "Author": "Joe Consumer", "ReviewID": "R3R2KPY07ECVI3", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I purchased the Samsung LN22A450 after considering many other models in the Samsung lineup (the 19\" version of this set as well as the 6 series version).  I found that the 19\" was still a bit too small for my liking, and the 6 series did not have enough improvements over this model to warrant the $90 increase in cost (the LN22A650 was on sale at a local store for $550).  I ended up buying this television for $460 from amazon, and I am very happy with my decision.  The tv is a perfect size for my small bedroom, and the picture quality is superior to many other brands that I have seen.Pros:-Built in digital tuner can be used to receive FREE HD channels via OTA broadcasts when connected to an antenna (almost all hdtv's have this, but it's an important feature to note if you don't want to pay for cable)-PC input (VGA) can be used to connect a laptop for viewing streaming or downloaded internet content-Picture quality (free HD channels are amazing, and upconverted DVDs are also great)-Aesthetics of the tv set itself (it looks pretty slick when paired up with a matching upconverting dvd player, the Samsung DVD-F1080 1080p Upconverting Compact DVD Player)Cons:-Only 1 HDMI input-VGA instead of DVI input for PC-SRS \"surround sound\" is disappointing; I just keep it turned off and turn up the volumeDespite the few complaints, I still give this product 5 stars, because samsung seems to have gotten all the more important details right with this tv.  You can't really expect to get impressive sound from hidden speakers that are pointed downwards, though the quality is good enough for a small room.

My old CRT TV died, and I needed a new one. Wanted LCD for the lower power consumption and since nearly all of them are HD ready I wanted that too. From what I read, Samsung has the best LCD panels out there. The image on this one is extremely good, though in my opinion I wouldn't say excellent. At times it seems to blur momentarily. Colors are well represented. The features of the TV are nice, not much more than you'd find with older CRT though. This unit is very light weight and easily mounted to a wall. It doesn't get hot when on, which is nice. The remote is weird in its layout of the buttons. I guess it's a subjective thing, but the channel and volume up/down buttons are at the bottom of the remote, not the top and that's really annoying to me. Good thing I was able to get a universal to use with my cable box and DVD player. While I would otherwise give it a five star rating I will have to agree with many others about my one real gripe. The sound. The speakers are buried UNDER the TV, and point down. I have mine in a small bedroom, I don't have delusions of using this TV for a home theater but for four hundred bucks they could have put some better speakers on this thing.

I spend 2-3 months reading and visiting different stores asking lots of questions to a variety of salesman. Honestly I am a die-hard SONY consumer, but SONY did not have a set this size, needed for a spare bedroom. Having a friend who is a tv repairman, I was influenced somewhat by his opinion, as he sees sets all the time in the store for repair. According to him, the three brands that have the LEAST repairs are ...SONY, SAMSUNG and PANASONIC. He says \"you can't go wrong with any of those brands.\" I have to believe him. This set is excellent. The set up is a breeze, and the picture on standard cable is very good, HD is amazing. The prize at AMAZON is cheaper than any of the big box stores, but just so you know, if you just have to have it NOW, and can't wait a few days for shipping, HH Greggs will match the price within about $4.00, whereas Circuit City and Best Buy thumb their noses at you when you ask. They are just too big for their britches! That's about it...if you are looking for a set in this size, just go buy it. It's a super looking set, easy controls, easy set up, very good picture on cable, excellent on HD and a good price.

Crane", "ReviewID": "R2YM6VSX9BBNXT", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I always read customer reviews before purchasing a product, and before I bought this Samsung TV, I looked at all customer reviews for all 22\" flat screen TVs. I own another small Samsung and it works very well in the kitchen. What I liked most about it was the clear picture and the footprint and how little space it occupied, so I decided that another Samsung would be a good choice.  Ignoring the warning echos in other reviews, I thought this would be the ideal TV.What other reviewers mentioned was absoutely on target.  Information about the channel or anything else is so small and stays on the screen so briefly, that it is almost impossible to read.  Worst display I have ever seen.  I discovered that if you push the \"info\" button the display remains on the screen, but I have to cross the room to read it, as the print is still very small.  What were they thinking when they designed this display?Further, other reviews warned that if you were not directly sitting in front of the TV, you saw only black.  Having never had that experience before, I took that with a grain of salt.  Wrong.  The other reviewers are right. If you move even slightly away from the center of the set, all you can see is a black screen.  I have no idea why this is the case, but it is true. So, if you plan on using this set where you sit in front of it, with no one else in the room watching from a different angle, it works just great. If multiple people plan on watching together, you might have a problem.On the positive side, the footprint is sleek and takes little room.  The picture is very good (not as awesome as my Sony Bravia) but very clear. The design of the set itself is pleasing and the remote is comfortable to hold and fairly easy to control. You must, however, read the instruction booklet to understand some of the features (e.g. \"tools\" and the bottom colored buttons. Their use is not immediately obvious.)Some reviewers criticized the sound as \"tinny\", and I know what they mean.  It is not particularly annoying to me but if you are \"into\" audio, it might drive you crazy.Samsung produces a quality product, it will work for my needs, but this TV is not for everyone.", "Date": "December 31, 2008"}, {"Title": "Just OK", "Author": "MMPEE", "ReviewID": "R3K3A2DGSTAFYZ", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I read on Consumersearch.com that Samsung had the BEST small screen LCD TV (19\") and a couple of best buys in the larger LCD TV's.  So I figured that Samsung would be the best way to go for the size I wanted, 22\".I read the reviews on Amazon.com and was a little concerned, but went ahead an bought it anyway as my old 20\" tube TV was on the fritz and I needed to upgrade to a digital tuner before Feb of next year anyway due to the change over to digital transmission.I would have to say I agree with most of the other posts on this forum.  The sound from the little speakers pointing straight down is not great.  I will probably eventually get some better speakers to plug in.  Also as noted in other posts, if you sit below eye level of the screen the picture gets darker, if you sit above eye level of the screen it gets lighter.  Viewing from extreme angles to the right or left is not great either.As I don't watch that much TV and I have tilted the screen so that it is 'eye level' when I am sitting on my couch it will fill my modest needs, but I am not thrilled with the product.  Makes me want to go back to a CRT TV in the future, if any are still made.The Amazon price was great, much cheaper than anything I could find in my local big box retailer stores and it arrived a day earlier than predicted and in excellent shape.It would be nice if Samsung made the mounting stand adjustable so you could tilt the screen up/down/right/left to adjust for optimal viewing pleasure.", "Date": "December 6, 2008"}, {"Title": "Close viewing of TV", "Author": "Ronald Diprima", "ReviewID": "R26C59Z5GJZBAT", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "The Samsung 22A450 22-inch 720 P LCD HDTV,Black:I wanted a quality TV to watch while on the treadmill.

I have been using this TV for about 4 months now. After researching for months I finally decided to try the Samsung and I am not disappointed.  It has incredible picture quality and truly for a 22inch you do not need a 1080 (leave that for 32 inch and up). For the reviews you see about bad picture quality, that may be true for AIR stations but not for the digital ones.  Since we are switching to digital, who cares about the AIR stations?  FYI - I don't have cable so I am reviewing this based on stright digital signals.  Although you can get the digital signals without a digital antenna, I would recommend purchasing an antenna if you do not have cable.  The signals will be stronger and you will pick up more channels.  There are plenty of bells and whistles. My only regret is not waiting a few more months as the prices are much lower now.  The only reason I didn't rate a 5 is becuase it's not a SONY. Other than that, it's perfection!!!", "Date": "November 27, 2008"}, {"Title": "Poor quality and warranty service", "Author": "James M.

I didn't want a cable box cluttering up the room, and decided up front that our new kitchen TV would be wall mounted and have it's own digital tuner.  The other criteria was that I didn't want a black housing, so that narrowed down our choices to some silver models and this piano-finish white Samsung.  Our cabinets are all medium dark oak and all the moldings at the eating end of the kitchen are white with a sort of cream color on the walls.  We felt the black model would jump off the wall a bit too much.I read the reviews and have to admit I was somewhat concerned as several reviewers complained about the audio quality of this set. Samsung makes some beautiful TVs and while the only comparable model I could find at my local Best Buy was the black version of this set... I took a chance and ordered (through Amazon).  Well, I got the set and a Sanus VisionMount VM3 and I did the install myself.  What I did was run a 50' HDMI cable from my Family Room home theater setup along with a 75 Ohm digital cable at eye height along with a 110v outlet.  So all cables and outlets are hidden behind the TV as it's mounted diagonally in the corner.The picture quality with both the cable and HDMI sources is outstanding.  The audio issue turned out to be a non-issue.  There were some complaints about lack of volume?  Maybe Samsung fixed it because we have no complaints and I have no idea how loud it can go... but we rarely set the volume over 18-20 and I know it goes up into the 30's.  Click on the menu and select Audio, then look at all the options for fixed settings... (speech, music, movies, etc.) and if you're finicky, there's a graphic equalizer to tweak to your hearts content for a custom sound definition.HD picture quality is remarkable, and even the analog cable and digital cable channels are excellent.  My source is Comcast cable.  We've received nothing but compliments this past weekend as we hosted a sunday football party and the women loved the idea of a very stylish white TV suspended from the wall that can swivel in almost any direction.  The guys were more concerned with the picture quality of the games and I have to say that we have no artifacting or crystalizing at all.  Samsung hit a home run with this one.I'll also say that Amazon's price beat any local retailer by a mile (almost $100.00 less) and the only available white unit I found was at Best Buy but it was the 20\" version of this set and more expensive than the 22'!", "Date": "November 24, 2008"}, {"Title": "Nice TV but weak speakers", "Author": "joeThePlumber", "ReviewID": "R38H0LBMG4YIB1", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Very nice image, no problem at all.

I was going to buy a 26 inch set, however, the sofa's only 5 or 6 feet from the TV, so 22 inches is more than adequate. The picture is outstanding, however, I have one problem that cannot be solved because it's with Verizon, not Samsung.We have Verizon FIOS and our Samsung TV is connected to a Verizon HD box via an HDMI cable. It worked well for a few hours, but then we lost the signal to the HDMI connector. This happened on and off again for two days, so Verizon sent out a service technician. While he was at the house, he commented about the outstanding quality of the picture on the Samsung. He installed a new HDMI cable and he also attached Component Cables as a backup, just in case with had more problems with the HDMI signal.I'm glad he installed the Component Cables because we lost the HDMI signal one day after he left. Investigation with Samsung revealed there is an HDMI incompatibility with Verizon Set Top Boxes. There's nothing wrong with the Samsung HDMI connector, it's just that the Verizon Set Top Boxes are slightly behind the time and currently do not support the advanced Samsung HDMI connector. Hopefully a Verizon Firmware upgrade will eventually solve this problem.Until that time, we've been using the Component Cables to connect with the Verizon Set Top box and the picture is still outstanding! If you don't need a gigantic television, I highly recommend this 22 inch LCD HD TV.As for the audio, it's fine and on par with other LCD TV's. If you're an audio buff and need top of the line audio, connect the TV to an inexpensive Samsung [or any other brand] Home Theater system. That's what we did. I connected our 22 inch Samsung to an Onkyo Stereo Receiver, along with two bookshelf speakers and the sound is terrific.We're pleased with the 22 inch screen because we sit so close to the television.

I replaced our media room tv with a newer updated 50\" Panasonic plasma (TH-50PZ85U) which is fantastic...and for the downstairs livingroom and master bedroom I chose 32\" LG Plasmas (very good but no match for the Panny) and then came the dilemma for the kids room and guest bedroom...can't justify large sets or too expensive so I decided to bite the bullet and go with 20\"-26\" lcd's.After deciding on this Samsung based on generally favorable reviews I ordered two (shipped lightning fast by Amazon/UPS) and imagine my surprise when I found that the picture quality/features were actually above and beyond what I was expecting! These sets are very thin and light..minimalist bezel and stand with attractive black gloss. The colors out of the box were a little off but with just a few minutes of tweaking I had the sets looking very good...and not just \"good for an lcd\".The only cons with this set are pretty minor...the remote feels kind of cheap and is not backlit..but is laid-out well and has buttons for every function.

I needed a TV to go with a PlayStation 3, and this Samsung's HDMI input, 720p (and 1080i) image are perfect for those needs.There are a lot of reviews about this TV, so I'll just summarize the basic points.- It's not true 16:9. You can change the picture size easily from the remote, and 16:9 channels do create a thin letterboxing effect. However, the 'wide' setting eradicates these with no discernible side effects. Plus, for HDMI input, there is a 'Just Scan' option which seems to simply display every transmitted pixel - perfect for the PS3.- Yes, the sound is not perfect. Out of the box it is pretty flat. You can easily create a custom EQ which helps a lot. The speakers are small - it's a small TV - but perfectly adequate once the EQ is adjusted to suit your requirements. The volume level is perfectly fine - in my house it is set around 15-30 out of 100. So - plenty of room for much louder volume.- Picture quality is great. There is the problem of viewing angle. The best picture is achieved when viewing fairly directly. I sit a new feet below it, and the image is a little darker. From the left and right, this is also a problem. However - the TV can be tilted backwards on the stand. The stand can also be wall mounted, and the TV tilted forwards. So there is quite a lot of flexibility. This kind of problem is normal in cheaper TVs, but it is not that significant with this TV. I have certainly seen far, far worse.- I don't have any problem with the remote button layout. It's fine.- I miss an electronic program guide in the digital transceiver. It's an unfortunate omission, but I can live without it.- Image quality is excellent.- The PS3 looks great on it, and beside it. They are a match made in heaven - shiny, black, plastic heaven.All in all, I am very satisfied.", "Date": "January 16, 2009"}, {"Title": "Good TV ... with 2 problems", "Author": "P.

Holland", "ReviewID": "R2D05297OCTB0U", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "We purchased this TV as our primary TV for in the living room of our new apartment. We wanted something discreet- that would not take over the room as most TVs do so we figured a white LCD TV would be best. This Samsung has a great picture when on and when off looks very elegant. We placed it in the corner of the room on a side table and when off it merely compliments our decor. Primarily we watch it from about 8', but its also easily viewable from a sharp angle 12' away in the kitchen. We didnt mount the TV but the holes are there for mounting purposes and the directions include a section on how to best mount the TV. The A/V inputs are on the back of the TV, which would limit how close to the wall its mountable. We have had the TV now for almost a month and have nothing but positive comments about it.The only negative is that it is not true 16:9.  When viewing programs/movies in 16:9 format (which is the majority of movies now) the viewing size of this TV is technically about 20\" not 22\" which leaves black bars on the top and bottom of the screen 2-3\" thick.  For me, this did not affect my purchase because there are simply not that many TVs this size that are 16:9.I read most of the reviews on Amazon, especially all the bad reviews, and I have to say I have had none of the problems that were in the bad reviews. My TV didnt come with a sticker on the LCD display like some customers. HD channels (through Comcast) look excellent. Even DVDs viewed on our cheap, old DVD player look great. As far as the sound, my only guess is some customers must have received a flawed product. The sound is great, I have only turned it up half-way and it is plenty loud. However, the sound may be a little on the tinny side; but I hardly see how you could expect more from small, built-in speakers. I am a bit of an audio perfectionist myself and ever since I planned on buying a new HDTV I also planned on buying a new sound system.  (Correct me if I'm wrong, buy I thought it was well known fact that if you want an amazing picture and amazing sound then you will buy a tv AND a sound system- no matter the price of the TV.) Even so, after having the TV for a month I am content with the built-in speakers.

But any significant wind causes dropout of the digital signal.  I am hoping that the turn-off of the analog broadcast signals in June will permit an increase in the digital signal level transmitted.There are two problems I have noticed with this TV.  First, it is 16:10 not 16:9.  Thus an HD signal must be stretched by about 11% vertically to fill the screen.  Otherwise there is a 5.5% black bar at top and bottom for the correct 16:9 display.  It is slightly a problem for me.  Second, while this TV has several inputs: HDMI, component, S-video, and composite, there is only one of each and the S-video and composite share a common audio input.  This means that you cannot hook up a composite VCR and a S-video DVD player simultaneously.  One would have to buy a switch. This is a potential problem for me.Otherwise the picture is good, although looking a bit poorly interpolated at times, but solid with a good HD signal AND choosing the 16:9 display mode.

Feinberg \"Philip Feinberg\"", "ReviewID": "R32PJUOPMC6QEF", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "For background info purposes, let me first say that my Samsung is rooftop antenna-connected via an RF modulator, and it is not connected to any other units (VCR, DVD player, ...). This is the same setup I maintained with the 18 year old TV the Samsung replaced, and I simply ended up reusing the RF modulator as a preference option. This decision, however, turned out to be one supported by a Samsung tech support person, who said that the modulator would enhance the picture quality all the more.Whether or not picture quality is enhanced by the modulator connection, I cannot say, as I haven't tried my setup without it. All I can say is that the picture quality is excellent, and that is without having had to do any adjustment tweaking (sharpness, contrast, brightness, ....). Thus, I would rate picture quality as my Samsung's best, most satisfying attribute.I am also pleased with the user-friendly remote. The numerals are generously large, and are color-contrasted with the remote's black background, which adds to visibility ease. Other icon and identifier buttons are likewise easy to ID and access. Moreover, buttons are nicely clustered, enabling easy location/activation.Samsung also gets kudos for the user-friendly owner's guide, which even I --- a tech-challenged hater of instruction manuals --- was able to navigate for set-up and adjustments, thanks to the thorough and easy to follow, step-by-step instructions and helpful illustrations. I surprised myself by completing the set-up, including programming the remote, with little angst and no tantrums!With regard to dissatisfaction, I would rate Samsung's overall sound quality as its primarily negative feature. It is woefully sub-standard and most disappointing. Without exaggeration, the sound quality emitted by this Samsung model is actually inferior to that of my old TVs, low-end computer, and even my inexpensive radios. The sound is tinny and\"echoey\". And unfortunately,neither the manual-based sound adjustment options nor Samsung tech support contacts were able to completely overcome the sound deficiencies. I'm thinking that the type and location of the TV's speakers --- on the bottom of the unit --- may be part of the problem. However, I was able, by strictly trial and error, to achieve some sound improvement by playing around with the bandwidth adjustments (per the Sound Customizing section of the manual). I have since found that the sound quality, whether due to my happenstance adjustments or not, is just a bit improved, but tends to vary with channel (including digital), as well as with voice vs. music output. Actually, at times, the music-based sound comes through well. I don't understand the sound variability enigma here, which is somewhat annoying, but I have determined that I can live with the sound in its current state, though reluctantly so.The one other negative feature is the ridiculously small, channel ID caption square (blue background/white numerals) which appears at the top left on the screen when making a channel change. Now, my distance vision is quite good, and I have watched TV from the same distance for 32 years, never having a problem seeing any emergent captions, etc. on any TV. But with this Samsung, especially when channel surfing, I literally have to get up from the couch and move a bit closer to the TV to see the caption figures. And with the multitude of adjustments that one canmake for so many of the Samsung features, you'd think that the caption could be enlarged. But alas, a Samsung contact revealed no such option.Would I have purchased this Samsung, based on knowing what I know now relative to the above? I think I'd probably opt to check out other Samsung models or other brands altogether beforehand, which is my recommendation to other potential buyers.", "Date": "April 3, 2009"}, {"Title": "irratating noise, greate picture", "Author": "Flight_173 \"Flow on\"", "ReviewID": "R1S0OKFHABAE2O", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "bought this TV because of the price/pro's ration, and the good reviews.PROS1. the TV is the perfect size, fits nicely in my bedroom, and produces a suitable sound volume.2. the picture is crisp and clear3. sleek design and remote controller are both minor pros4. despite spec that say it only supports 720 pixels, when attached to my ps3 via hdmi3 cords it says I'm receiving 1080pi.CONS1. produced a faint but notable buzzing noise after 2 weeks2. shipped it to costumer repairs and after 3 phone calls and 2 1/2 months later it came back with the same noise.I decided to keep the TV, I turn off the incoming power to it before i sleep.", "Date": "April 2, 2009"}, {"Title": "samsung tv", "Author": "older and wiser", "ReviewID": "R2AE28FXCIVQ6G", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "good picture.sound not the best.when TV on standby you can hear a high pitch hum.", "Date": "March 11, 2009"}, {"Title": "Good little TV", "Author": "LBG", "ReviewID": "R13L3YIJP66E36", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I bought this for use in our bedroom, and knew from the start that we wouldn't be adding an external sound system.

Sets up digital for air very well. We do not have cable. We live in the city. We use an inexpensive HD antenna from WalMart that works very well and can be adjusted when needed. Cosmetically it is a beautiful little tv and the white is much easier to keep clean than our black touch of red-does not seem to be as much of a dust magnet as the black.  It is white for our bedroom, and there was not much to choose from in the white category.Cons:  The picture becomes dark or discolored when viewing from the sides or below straight on viewing. The sound is low at times and varies on different channels. The font when setting or trying to  change set-up on the tv is very small so can only be seen very close up. The sound cuts out and the picture goes out briefly if a person comes too close to the tv accompanied by an annoying noise (adjusting the antenna has helped, but not always). Maybe a better antenna would do the trick in this area.It is OK for our TV viewing in the bedroom, but we are looking for a different TV for the kitchen in the same size.

That probably wasn't a great decision.  It is a nice \"cheap\" TV.  The sound is good, the SD and HD pictures are pretty good, and the remote is ok.  However, it is what it is - an inexpensive, lower line TV.  The quality of the picture from side to side and and up and down (as other reviewers have mentioned) degrades quickly.  Not a good property for a TV used in a room where the viewer is moving around quite a bit.  I ended up sending it back to Amazon for a refund.  As usual, Amazon was great and it was easy to return.If you are using it a room where you are viewing it generally straight-on, and you don't need a large TV, this will probably work fine for you.", "Date": "January 25, 2009"}, {"Title": "Samsung 22\" television 720p LCD", "Author": "Elizabeth Bennet \"Ellen\"", "ReviewID": "R3PCIBK6MBW9WU", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Arrived quickly.

Because it is set further back from your eyes than a deeper standard TV set, the screen will appear smaller than a regular TV screen.

They forgot to order the part - ha ha ha! The TV had now been in the shop longer than it was in my home. They asked me if I was willing to wait for the part which should take less time than an exhange...I should have gone for the exchange, but I let them order the part.

They called the shop and learned that it was repaired 8 days ago and they didn't call me because they only call on saturdays (ha ha ha) and the Magical \"caller\" guy was out. What a disaster.
