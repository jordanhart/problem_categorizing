I looked for a long time and came up with only a few choices. I picked this unit because of the sound leveling feature (was tired of loud commercials at night). Also wanted a TV with a narrow bezel. The TV arrived in less than 24 hrs. .... GREAT. It installed perfectlly using the mounting stand. Its been only 3 or 4 weeks now but everything works great. The picture while not as good as my 26\" Sony LCD Bravia or 58\" Panasonic plasma is very good. Also, the sound leveling feature really does work.", "Date": "July 8, 2012"}, {"Title": "Toshiba 32 LED HD TV New", "Author": "sharonmeredith", "ReviewID": "R1Z8T3JFGWUFRV", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I am sorry for the person that wrote this first review.The Toshiba LED TV product is one of the best on the market. See the electonic website reviews like cnet. we just got the 40\".  We Have ATT Uverse.  It is AWESOME.  The graphics, sound, i cant Say enough about it.  It really does look like the people are right there in the room with you.  Maybe you need to work on your settings and learning how to use it.  We have a Samsung before this. And we have not had any problems with the remote although we have to use the ATT remote for most functions, which is fine, but the toshiba remote is just fine too.  We got it direct from Toshiba because we didnt want to wait. Evidently they are pretty popular.", "Date": "June 12, 2012"}, {"Title": "Great Product, Great Price", "Author": "BillK", "ReviewID": "R472XS8J8SJMF", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This LED HD TV was just what I was looking for. I wanted a 32\" TV to fit into a cabinet that I had a 26\" TV in. I only have 30\" to work with. The Toshiba 32\" is 29.5\" wide so it fit like a glove. I have had good luck with Toshiba's so I was comfortable with the purchase.

This set has a good picture and sound. However setting it up was difficult because it does not come with a users manual. You have to go on line to get it. Also the stand is very flimsy and cheap. Also like other reviewers I find the remote is cheap. I compare it to one you get at the dollar store. As other reviews have stated the set does freeze at times when changing channels.

It's a remanufactured TV, and their is some kind of anomaly with some of the red LEDs in the upper left quadrant of the screen, but you can only see it when the TV first turns on.

It works great as a television, but whenever we hook up his computer through the HDMI port to watch netflix or play a game, the color is VERY green. We tried adjusting the settings on the TV (it won't adjust far enough), and on his graphics card (same problem). We even installed some third party software to further adjust it, which made it better but it is still noticeably off color. We tried his computer on some different TVs and did not have this problem at all, it is just this TV. We have also hooked up other computers to this TV, and they also had this problem, but not to the same extent.Anyway, this TV has bad color when hooked up to computers so I wouldn't recommend it for anything more than using the coax input.", "Date": "May 24, 2013"}, {"Title": "Nice TV & Great Price!", "Author": "Stargazer", "ReviewID": "R23SAS82999N6U", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "What a great TV and it was priced right!

Very fast shipping.No complain about the quality of the sound and picture. However, terrible remote control and even the control on the TV itself. TV seems not really responsive to any changes (changes channel, volume,on/off, etc.) The remote control feel cheap, I hope it will last, only time can tell.Another problem is the packaging. The box got damaged everywhere. It looks like that this TV has been shipped from oversea to my house and has gone through a lot.For now, this TV can only get 2 stars. If it can last more than 1 year, I will upgrade it to 3 stars and that will be the most this TV can get. It would be an excellence bedroom TV (will be 4 stars), if not for the annoying remote control.(!5 stars TV will be my LG32LV2400 which I was able to get for $334 after tax (new)!)Update 05/03/2012: It seems like the TV gets frozen if you keep changing channel. I can't replicate the out come, it just gets frozen when ever it feels like, so I'm hesitated to call Toshiba.
