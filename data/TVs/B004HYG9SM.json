Very clear picture with just a hint of graying in the black areas. The 5.1 audio out is great for older style A/V receivers that don't handle HDMI input. One digital audio (toslink) cable from the tv handles all audio to the receiver that was input to the tv via HDMI. Easy set up but swivel base would have been nice. One piece of deceptive  advertising is the PIP funtion. Only available if you are in PC mode. Don't expect to get PIP from two sources unless one is main screen PC. The matte screen handles reflected light well and the glare from the frame is bearable. Very little motion blurring at this screen size with 60hz response and back lit flourescent versus LED isn't worth the extra money. Good solid buy at this price.", "Date": "April 12, 2011"}, {"Title": "Awesome", "Author": "R. Kavuri", "ReviewID": "RT2OIWSVF2TN4", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This Sony HDTV provides unbelievable options for picture selection and audio selection. The modes are pre-calibrated by Sony and I just love the various scene selection options, I just need to switch between the various modes based on the need (I just use the Game Mode and Movie Mode).I notice a lot of people complaining about the sound in their HDTV. I like the audio output on this Sony HDTV compared to the Samsung C350 that I owned before this one.Additionally, the remote has the option to control other HDMI output devices such as a blu ray player or a PS3. You can also connect a USB device to this HDTV and play songs or photos.I was not too impressed initially by the picture output but later realized that dullness in the picture was due to the light sensor, once I turned it off everything looks picture perfect. This is a 2011 model, and I guess there is no Sony HDTV that would provide you all these options for this price range.", "Date": "April 23, 2011"}, {"Title": "Superior TV", "Author": "70's_Rule \"mb\"", "ReviewID": "R33HOBI2NS1I6Q", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I've purchased and returned 2 LCD TVs: a Samsung 40\" LCD in 2008, and a Panasonic VIERA 32\" LCD just a few weeks ago.  Both of these seemed to be good TVs, but IMHO the Sony Bravia blows them both away, especially considering that Amazon's price is significantly cheaper vs the others.The set-up was very fast and simple.  I used the enclosed TV stand for my Bravia and it took less than 5 minutes to assemble.  The TV is extremely stable on the base, even a little more so than the Panasonic.  I had no qualms about setting it on top of a small, sturdy dresser to get some height for better viewing.The only snags I encountered at all were with setting up the HDMI interfaces between my Lenovo laptop computer and Panasonic DVD player/recorder.  At first the picture quality was marginal, but I think the HDMI settings must take some time to sort out.  The TV seems to be smart enough to eventually get everything set, and the laptop's external viewer settings did identify the Sony television and once that was done, I could make some changes to the view settings to get what I wanted.  (When I changed from the PC HDMI input to another source and back, the Panasonic TV wouldn't show the computer input and I'd often have to reboot the computer to get it to show right.)  So, patience is required to get your view settings as desired, but this TV can handle just about any preference!It's possible the Panasonic might have had a slightly \"crisper\" picture and less darkening effects with some movies, etc.  But I just turned up the backlight on the Sony and no more worries.  The sound on the Sony, however, is superior IMHO.PROS:Excellent remote control with logical labels.  ALL the buttons serve a useful purpose and their purposes can be learned intuitively and quickly through use.Ease of changing viewing width/angles to accommodate quality of source signal, on the rare occasion the TV didn't get it right the first time.Great sound quality and functions - RCA out jacks are critical!Video motion seemed very smooth - I have ear/balance/migraine issues and even so I didn't get a nauseated/dizzy feeling as much as I did with the Panasonic or Samsung (though the Sam's screen was too big for the room).Current price at Amazon - $358.99?!CONS:Dark/night scenes in movies could be a little \"too dark\" unless the backlight was increased.  I suppose this might shorten the life of the TV, but I don't think it's necessary to do this except for certain programming.Like most LCD TVs in this price range, the internal speakers are marginal.  I'm currently looking for a cheap external audio solution (e.g., higher-end self-powered computer speakers with an adapter to the RCA out jacks)This is a safe investment in a quality, solid TV - the cheaper TV models weren't \"enough cheaper\" to warrant taking the risk.  For a bedroom or small living room the SONY Bravia LCD 32\" is simply unbeatable for the price.", "Date": "July 18, 2011"}, {"Title": "high quality and great value", "Author": "S.

No jack for headphones, nor can the remote adjust the volume of the RCA audio outputs (I have to listen through headphones by connecting my headphones to the cable set top box, and then change the cable box settings every time I switch from speakers to headphones).Picture quality (black levels, contrast) seems excellent, with color looking pretty accurate to my eyes right out of the box. Without a colorimeter or spectroradiometer and software for precise measuring, it's difficult to say much empirically. I read that the Bravia3 engine improves standard definition (SD) quality somewhat from last year's BX300 model that has the Bravia2 engine. Not having watched a BX300, I can't say if the BX320 is that much better or not, but it certainly improves on the SD picture quality of other brand's sets I've tried out over the last few years and eventually returned, mostly because of SD picture fuzziness.I have most all the picture adjustment features for reducing noise set to off, and use the Cinema mode.Another similar set, the BX420, may be better if you plan to hookup a computer using HDMI (1080p looks better for this).Even though Sony doesn't manufacture these sets in Japan anymore, I'm hoping the reliabilty and longevity I've had with other Sony televsions in the past will continue with this set.", "Date": "August 13, 2011"}, {"Title": "A Sony For Less Than $400", "Author": "T.

McIntyre", "ReviewID": "RY7AYL1TV2SXR", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I wanted a good flat-screen for our bedroom that wasn't too big and had a good picture. So I ordered this TV with free shipping on late Monday night from Amazon for the price of $298. I received it 36 hours later on Wednesday morning. I could not ask for better delivery service.It was easy to set up the base for the TV - one screwdriver and 5 minutes later it's ready to go. Note that the base is fixed - it does not swivel which would have been nice. Also note that the base is quite sturdy - unlike the base for the Samsung LN32D450 that I was also considering. Simple hook-up for the HDMI cable (MediaBridge $9.99 6' HDMI cable also ordered from Amazon). I powered it on and ran through a few simple set-up menus and it's ready to watch. Very easy to set up.Picture is quite good but not awesome at 720p and 60hz specs. It's exactly what I expected from a $300 flat-screen. Sound is adequate but certainly not outstanding - again just what I expected. I'm sure a basic sound bar would improve the sound but at about $200, that would add considerably to the cost of the unit.Overall, a good TV at this price. I had watched the prices on decide.com and bought when it said the price was at the lowest point for this time frame. I feel that I got a good solid TV for a good price. My second choice to buy would have been the Samsung LN32D450 but its price was higher and the base was very wobbly. I also like the Sony picture over the Samsung's vividness.

I'll just say I am very happy with everything about this TV and only mention a few minor things I had a little trouble with.The first is my disappointment there is no input for headphones. I found that a little surprising since a headphone jack is basically ubiquitous on TV sets today.The second problem was that the TV would automatically change it's input source to HDMI whenever I turned on the LG BD650 3D Network Blu-ray Disc Player with Smart TV. My cable box is connected to the Component input, and the Blu-ray player is connected to the HDMI input. My family usually presses the \"All On\" button on the cable remote to turn on/off the TV. Doing so would turn on the blu-ray player and the TV would auto select that as the input source. I found this highly annoying. But I was able to find the control setting on the TV to disable that feature. Everything works fine now.I have not yet plugged into the PC input on the TV to test that feature.

The Sony Brovia must come in 100 different model numbers. and when advertised, most of the time, they just say \"Sony Brovia\" with an inch size.  I got what I wanted and it took some time to figure this out.  Also, I discovered that \"sales persons\" don't know the difference between the models and half of them told me that I couldn't get PIP in a 32\" model.

Of the 3, this SONY Bravia delivers the best picture and performance for the price, which says a lot considering that the other 2 are a Samsung 40 inch 1080p and an LG 42 inch 1080p, both of which are higher resolution.This SONY puts out a fine picture, with good blacks and enough contrast so that you can clearly see the action that takes place in dark scenes. I like its matte screen, which doesn't reflect a lot of room light and is also good when we watch it in bed with the lights out. The set was easy to set up and it has a decent remote with clearly labeled buttons.One of its big pluses is that it interfaces smoothly with our cable remote, which we have to use to control the set when its hooked up to our cable box (which is always). We have another television, a Samsung, that refuses to work well with the cable remote and this is a big headache. This SONY, on the other hand, operates very well with the cable remote. One click turns both the cable box and the television set on or off, plus adjusts audio and changes channels. So simple!I was hesitant about getting a 720p because I worried that the picture would not be crisp, but I figured that since this one was intended as a secondary TV for the bedroom it wouldn't matter that much. It turns out that I needn't have worried, as I can't tell the difference between this picture and the picture that comes out of our (supposedly) better Samsung.

My only complaint is the sound quality; if you turn the volume up to hear a person mumbling or whispering on screen you can get a weird humming noise when they speak. Some have said this could be fixed with external speakers but we haven't tried it yet.

So, I got a 22\" Sony Bravia for the back room (like a matching set!). Unfortunately, I lost the little guy in the divorce. Then that room was later converted into my drum studio (now that there's no more Precious Moments or Peanuts crap all over the place). But, I was still paying for the other receiver, and I thought it would be nice to have another smaller TV in the back of the house, maybe the kitchen? Then I couldn't find a 22\" Bravia. Well, wouldn't you know, I have an island counter top in the kitchen with a cabinet above it, and I swear to god that cabinet was placed just at the right height so this 32\" could fit perfectly underneath it! I heard poor reviews about the speakers on this TV, but I don't believe them at all. With the speakers set to the \"Dynamic\" mode: my kitchen is roughly 13' x 14', and when I'm sitting on the bar stool eating and watching the TV, or jamming one of the satellite music channels, it sometimes sounds like there is small set of speakers behind my fridge!!!

But, I like what I like and The Sony Bravia is a very satisfying TV. We had been watching a Sony WEGA and love it. It has now gone in the bedroom. I was convinced that The WEGA had a picture very close to the LCD TV's. But, even without high definition service, this little LCD is amazing. Picture quality is excellent, the price was very good, on sale, sound quality is certainly good enough for me. After looking for an LCD that we could use in our livingroom, where we sit at a sharp angle from the screen, I know I made the right choice. At any angle the picture doesn't change. It was packaged very well. I had been worried that it could get damaged in shipping and we'd have to go through a hassle with that. But I was pleasantly surprised by the good condition of the box.

This was a purchase for my husband's Christmas and he uses it in the office. I need some expert advice on how to adjust the set so the picture isn't so soft and blurry. It is at factory settings right now. I have tried all the settings that come with the tv but it still has a blurry kind of foggy soft looking picture. I have it connected to our Dish via a satellite antenna cable 75ohm, the required cable. I have tried various ways to get the picture to look sharper without so much blurring around images but it just doesn't work. I have gone into all the controls for resolution, gamma, lightness, sharpness, picture modes, back lighting etc. Nothing resolves this. I also kept it off for several hours because it was cold when it was delivered and I read that sometimes coming from cold to warmth can cause it to be foggy or soft looking. Is it because I don't have an hdmi cable from the Dish receiver to the tv? I don't understand why it isn't as sharp as my old hatachi rear projection 52 inch tv I've had going on 15 years which is hooked up via a DVI cable because it was the first tv to come out with a DVI hookup. I think this is a great little TV especially for the price I paid for it 298.00 including shipping. I just wish I could understand more about how to hook it up to get the best picture. We have the old Hitachi in the family room by the Dish receiver. The Dish receiver has dual tuners and the Dish technician ran an outlet to the office. My husband use to watch TV using the computer with it's built in tuner and watched it using a program we downloaded from the internet. It was soft looking on the computer but I chalked it up to it being a computer thing and the monitor we have. I hope someone has the answers on how to get a better picture because I know this tv is capable of a better picture. I have a new cable on order from Amazon to see if that resolves the problem.  I read all the hookup guides but to have hdmi in the office I would have to have a 100 foot hdmi cable. If I have to do that to get a quality tv picture I will. Please post if you are technically gifted in this area so I can know what to do. Are all LCD TV's blurry when you sit within a certain distance? Just need some good input.

The picture is great, but the sound on the internal speakers is mediocre.  I hooked it up to external speakers via my receiver.  The problem is that this television's remote control will only control the volume on the television's internal speakers -- not the volume of the external speaker output.  So your options are: to get up off the sofa whenever you need to adjust the volume/mute sound; to use a receiver that has its own remote control; or to live with the mediocre internal speakers alone.  This was not an issue with my prior TV: when I modified the volume or muted with the TV remote, all sound outputs followed suit.  I have confirmed this limitation with Sony.
