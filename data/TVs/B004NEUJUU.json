It have a wonderful picture and I could actually see the sub-titles on the foreign language films that I watch.  It was a dream.  Until last night... one of my cats unplugged the TV and when we plugged it back in, nadda, nicht, nein, nyet!  The red light would come on, but the idiot box wouldn't turn on.  Called customer service, they're only open 8am to 8pm Monday through Friday.  As if people don't watch TV on the weekends.  Called the store this morning and got a new one.  But I will never buy another Sansui product again.  And believe me, if we hadn't already pitch the older TV, we'd have been using that until I got paid at the end of the week.", "Date": "November 3, 2012"}, {"Title": "Inexpensive TV works well w/basic cable", "Author": "E.

I actually purchased from best buy...can't remember how much but it was on sale.  Had it since early 2012 and is quite reliable.  However, the wobble tv base it came with makes the unit lean forward.  No matter what we tried to do to remedy this it is persistent.  I am looking to use a wall mount instead, hoping that would allow for easier tv watching for my children.....it's their tv.", "Date": "March 8, 2013"}, {"Title": "sansui HDLCD3250 32 INCH 720P LCD TV", "Author": "greg @memphis, Tn", "ReviewID": "R16OBTH1K4B2D0", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "AN EXCELLENT TV SET EASY SETUP,EXCELLENT PICTURE QUALITY good price by AMAZON 2 DAY DELIVERY.

When we plugged it in there was a black line across the screen then the screen went black.  Tried to return it to the store but it had been over 60 days since purchase so they would not exchange it.  We called customer service and they told us they would not exchange it but they would pay to have it repaired.  The repair shop was an hour away and took two months to complete.  After we picked it up from the shop the TV lasted one night and now will not turn at all.  Tried customer service again and they said to unplug it for an hour to reset the circuitry.  We'll see if that works.  Next time will make sure to buy a better brand.  Will not buy Sansui again.  Poor quality and customer service.Uplugging it and resetting the circuit did not work.  Called customer service again and they want us to return the t.v. to the repair shop that could not fix it in the first place.  Horrible product from a company that does not stand behind their product.  Avoid this company!!!", "Date": "February 18, 2013"}, {"Title": "Cloudy screen...", "Author": "RickyC", "ReviewID": "R3P0CP4BZVOB0D", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "I bought one of these televisions (not from amazon), had it for about 2 weeks and noticed when it went into letterbox there was a \"cloudy\" sort of light appearing from the bottom of the screen that wasn't there when I bought it.The tv had a great picture before then but had to be returned 2 weeks in after purchase.", "Date": "March 7, 2012"}, {"Title": "Dead Pixels", "Author": "Raegan Webb", "ReviewID": "R30Q0ROAVPLA3R", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "I got this TV as a gift on Christmas.
