{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Not just good for the price...", "Author": "R. Casper \"Bob Casper\"", "ReviewID": "RR7BP5UD6XY4B", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "It is a good TV, period. Make that GREAT! No issues that are really causing a problem have come up since its purchase. Some minor issues that I expected after doing my research really never came up (except for poor sound), and really even they were nitpicky type things. We have ours hooked up to our Toshiba 3D Wi-Fi Blu Ray player, the Wii and our Tivo, everything works wonderfully.  Would buy this TV again and would recommend to friends.In a nutshell --What needs improvement:Sound is poor, volume setting goes to 100, but, sound only really increases till about 45 on volume bar.LED local dimming can show flickering (minor), if not set-up just right.Just a little slow to power on and to change channel inputs/channels (but, not really that bad).What makes it Great!:Touch panel buttons on front are great (power, channel, volume, etc.).Smart features are good (could be improved, but, are OK.)Easy wireless connectivity.Flawless 3D - very low eye-strain, little or no cross talk, very sharp image.Thin and lite-weight for its screen size.Hi-end, multi-featured, backlit Remote with quick access buttons (Netflix).We have had several Toshiba products in the past and I knew that they make a good product, this is no exception.  Here is my experience...After months of research and looking at this, and looking at that, I knew that there were three TVs that could do what I wanted.  1) 1080p 2) Passive 3D, 3) the \"just right\" refresh rate, 4) LED backlighting, 5) Wi-Fi/Smart TV capable - and at least 55in. screen.  There were about 3 that came out of that quest, this Toshiba, an LG and a Vizio.  The Vizio had a 480hz refresh rate, but, more is not better. Also, the Vizo had edge lit LED, which would contribute to less than desired contrast ratio.  Then, I learned that there were numerous customer complaints, on several sites - so that is what axed the Vizio early on in my search.  As for the LG, well, there again the refresh rate came up (I'll get to that in a bit). The LED back lighting was identical for the Toshiba and the LG, I was even told by the sales person that Toshiba had licensed that particular form of LED Local Dimming from LG (don't know if that is true or not), and in that aspect they performed the same.  So, with everything being almost equal I went back looked at the refresh rate. When I was looking at the LG 55 in. passive 3D TV model, I decided against that one because at best, I could not confirm that it even had 120hz refresh rate (which is what it said it did).  Even if it did, the way that passive 3D works (two different fields) you would need to half the 120hz and you are down to 60hz.  So, when I could confirm that this Toshiba has 240hz refresh rate, that is what sold me. I know I kind of sounds like Goldie Locks, this one is too high and the other too low - AND one was just right. But, remember, you will be looking at this thing for hours - the last thing I wanted was eye strain and/or a headache - and that is what you will get if the refresh rate is too low or two high.  After all, one of benefits of passive 3D, is less eye strain, so I thought I  should think seriously before tossing that out with another feature that put you back in a situation that could bring back eye strain.  OK then, back on track, with the Toshiba, I have 120hz for each of the passive 3D fields.  The Toshiba still works out mathematically with 3D video and 3D film to deliver a very smooth image, even in a very active movie or 3D sporting event.  So, that was my pick.  I know... broadcast station still send their signals out at 60hz, that is not what I am talking about (and for the record I am not talking about power supply either).  I was able to compare both the LG and Toshiba at the same time, when I bought the Toshiba, and it was a fair and close comparison. However, the Toshiba is clearer, sharper, brighter and less blurry (for actions scenes and text/credits).  Plus, the information for Toshiba is in the manual, on their website and sales people seem be very knowledgeable when it comes to the Toshiba.  It seems like LG's marketing team will say one thing, there manual says another and sales people are just as confused (if not more so) than the customer.  I know some are calling this a value 3D TV and are willing spend much more, but, for my family this is still a lot of money.  So, after I did a lot of research and if I am going to put out $1K or more for a TV, I need to know what I am going to get, sorry LG - THANKS, TOSHIBA!**UPDATE 02/22/2013**Clearly the best TV out there!  Still working great 1 and half years later (bought this one in Fall of 2011). I was planning on buying another TV at about this time, but, this one is still going strong (as is the Toshiba we bought before this one back in 2008).  I am excited to see what Toshiba will come out with for there next TV!  For all it's features, the high quality 2D and 3D picture and hi-end specifications this is the one to have.

My experience with most newer HDTV's is that factory pre-sets suck. In order to get the most out of the picture they have to be manually adjusted. And I have had a couple of people tell me their TV is broke because the screen keeps getting dark. And adjusting the one setting that is \"adaptive contrast\" or \"Auto Contrast\" fixed it completely.The images and experience that I received from this TV was phenomenal. Set up the image settings and installed new firmware (didn't watch with original firmware) watched 3d blu-ray, x-box, and 2d-3d convesion of standard blu-ray. All of which were great.

I will admit that the price of the Toshiba was very interesting at first. I have had Toshiba TV's in the past without any concerns. Since my past television decided to wear down I needed a new one. The passive 3D option was the direction I was willing to pay for rather then getting an active display and all the extra costs. So I went with the Toshiba hoping for a good product at a great price. Got the TV shipped for free through Amazon. Shippers did a good job. Set it up and powered it on. First thing that was noticable was the horrible, HORRIBLE backlighting problems with this set. Since I had never seen this TV before, I went to another TV store to find out by looking at several edge lit TV's. None had a problem with black like this TV had. So I returned it to Amazon and tried to replace it with the same model TV. Returning the TV was fine, and the shipping was great again. So here is the review of the same model and brand of TV.CONS:Backlighting-Still had problems with backlighting during dark scenes. A streak of light gray moved from the top right of the screen to the bottom left of the screen. This was to much of a problem for me to spend the amount of money that I did on the TV.Sound-The speakers on the TV are very poor and high pitched. I tried to adjust them, but it never really changed.Powering on-This set does take a long time to power up. Not really a big deal.Channel changing-takes longer then you would imagine to switch between channels when watching HDTV through the internal tuner.PROS:Passive 3D-The passive 3D was great for gaming and movies. No problems at all.Picture-The options availiable to adjust the picture is amazing. It displayed great colors and images when the TV was used and the picture was not in a dark screen.Remote-Was easy to use and the setup was easy to understand.Overall this TV is not a bad TV. Maybe I am just picky, but when you spend money you want a good product. This TV did not meet my expectations for the price it costs. Maybe it is because they purchased the rights of the technology through LG but did not build the TV the same. I don't know. And the poor backlighting problems I was experiencing with this TV was just too much.So I returned the TV and purchased the more expensive LG 55LW6500. What a difference 400 dollars makes!

It's not quite as \"plug-and-play\" as my two year old Toshiba LCD (takes some work on tweaking the video settings) but does have a very nice picture.  The speakers aren't the greatest BUT they also fire down and backwards.  I'm currently using a couple of books to help divert the sound forward and it made a huge difference.  I'll figure out a more permanent solution soon.  With the 2D->3D conversion you can tell it's not true 3D, but there's definitely more depth to the picture and is a nice feature that works well.  I also like the passive rather than active 3D implementation.  Connected to wifi easily and automatically found a firmware update and updated without an issue.  So far the only negative is the power on time.  It's not a huge issue by any means to wait 20 seconds for the tv to be usable, but it's definitely quite a bit longer than my LCD.", "Date": "November 27, 2011"}, {"Title": "I love this TV!", "Author": "Theresa", "ReviewID": "R1S5Q9194LWYPZ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I am so glad I finally decided to purchase this TV,I must have looked everywhere I could think of over the past few months looking at 55\" HD TVs. I already own a 47\" HD Vizio TV, but I wanted a bigger one in the living room, but I also needed to find the best deal I could. When I came across the Toshiba 55\", 1080p 240Hz LED-LCD HD, 3D, Wireless Internet connection television at the price I found it for, I knew I had finally found what I was looking for, but I still had my doubts as to what the quality would actually be as I have never owned a Toshiba television before (I have owned several of their computers however), so I took a little time to think about it before I actually purchased it, and I read the reviews, most were quite positive so I decided to give it a chance. Boy am I ever glad I did, I thought my last HD had an excellant picture, in fact people use to comment on how good the picture was until I got this one, the picture is so clear and so detailed you feel as if you are actually there(I still really like my Vizio to though). I think it is safe to say that I love this television. The set-up was so easy, and connecting to the Internet was effortless, I just told it to look for my home network and it found it, now I don't have to go through my game counsel to watch Netfix, and I love all the free widgets and Vudu and everything else you can get to online through this television. It has to be one of the best purchases I have ever made. The sound is good also, but I have my TV hooked up to my stereo system, it always makes the sound so much better when you hear it through an actual sound system.

After a fair amount of research I decided on an LED, primarily due to: picture quality and energy consumption.  After a fair amount of research, I realized i could get an LED TV with 3D capability.  So, I did price comparisons and read about active versus passive 3D.  I settled on passive and found this Toshiba model having all of the features I wanted, including Internet capability with wireless component included. After searching for a week on all sites, no one could beat the Amazon price which came with free shipping.  So, I ordered it and was given a 10 day shipping timeline.This coincided with the New Year holidays, but on January 2nd, I got an e-mail from them that the TV has been shipped via Pilot with the expected arrival date of 1/10. I was not familiar with Pilot so, i started reading the reviews about Pilot and discovered a lot of negative stuff on this site about Pilot. A couple of days went by and I kept watching the tracking system, the TV was en-route. On Thursday January 5th at 10:00 a.m. I received a call from someone what said he had my TV and was in the neighborhood and could deliver the TV that day. This was a company that Pilot uses in Michigan to make the delivery.  So, I called them back and asked them to deliver it after 3:00 p.m.  They transferred my call to the driver and he said ok.  He showed up at 3:15 p.m.  So, for those who are concerned about Pilot, I had no problem, just that I did not get an advanced notice of early delivery.He brought the TV in and unpacked it, but because of the cold, we decided not to turn it on at the time.  He wrote on the shipping slip, \"subject to inspection\" meaning I could return it.  After a couple of hours I connected the TV to our cable box and other devices and it worked just fine.This TV does exactly what is described as its features. When you install it, just take the picture setting \"auto-view\" and set it at \"standard.\"  The picture quality is excellent.  Also, after a little playing around, I connected it to our wireless and was able to get into Facebook, Flicker, etc.The TV has a feature that converts regular 2D viewing to 3D and comes with 4 pairs of glasses.  The remote has a very convenient button that you push to switch between 2D and simulated 3D. All of the HDMI functions work fine as well and they communicate with my cable box, surround system and 2 DVD players.The one drawback of this TV is its audio. The speakers are weak and point downward. So, you might be a bit disappointed if you are used to high quality sound.  Make sure you set the audio setting at SAP (that is not the default setting) or use a pair of external speakers.  This TV has a ton of features, I have not discovered all of them yet.

However this current model leaves a lot to be desired. It seems like a great deal at first glance, but once you take it home, unpack it and start viewing, you will surely be disappointed. If you have never owned an HDTV before, and have no point of reference, then you might be amazed. However, if you are used to looking at an HD screen, you will be instantly disappointed. The 2d performance is poor. When the TV goes blank, you can actually see the horrible uneven streak of grey (backlighting) on the screen. Before buying this TV, I was apprehensive about the 3d quality, which turned out to be my folly. It was 2d I should have been worried about. After all, 90% of the time is spent watching regular 2d programming and like Fredo, the 2d broke my heart. The picture is horrendous. I played with it for about 3 hours, and that is a long long time.

The ps3 plays 3d blurays & looks good on this tv, i prefer passive 3d like on this tv because there's no flicker & the glasses are basically free at theaters. i dont think the sound is as bad as some people say, its fine with me but if im watching a new movie i use my surround sound anyway.Cons:usb port is only 2.0 and doesnt play .flv files, doesnt play audio on some .mkv files (if the file size is too small), no usb keyboard support (needed since there's no keyboard on the remote).  3D is not worth the extra $ so far, I wish I had gotten a bigger tv instead of 3D.  The digital optical audio (fiber optic) has a delay unless you downgrade the video quality, so peoples' mouths dont sync with the words.** update 3-3-12 **downgrading this from 4 stars to 3, just discovered this tv doesn't play media from external usb hard drives or sticks unless they are formatted to FAT32, not NTFS or exFAT.  FAT32 doesn't allow files over 4gb in size, so this means I can't have 1080p movies on the drive since they are sometimes up to 20gb. And if your drive has partitions, sometimes the top usb port will only view the 2nd partition and the bottom usb port will only view the 1st partition, which is backwards.  I got a tv with USB built in so I wouldn't have to get an xbox or ps3 as a media player, so this really annoys me.** update 6-6-12 **the 3.5mm jack for the pc audio has slowly degraded and now is barely audible.  now i would have to get a new computer with hdmi built in, thats the only way ill be able to use the tv as a computer monitor (btw the tv has a vga port but dvi would be better).  Save your $ & get a bigger non-3d tv** update 12-31-12 **this tv just lost another star, down to 1 star now.  Because it doesn't accept NTFS drives, the standard for over 10 years now, I had to format my new 3tb external usb hard drive as FAT32 which is unstable.  After plugging it into the tv and back into my computer, I lost 500gb of data!!  Windows converted 5000 files - movies, tv show episodes, family pictures, and a book I was writing - to an unrecoverable .chk format.

Great price from Amazon. Amazon delivered as promised. TV screen started going \"white\" on it's own randomly within 5 days. This gets a little long, but I prefer everyone sees it so they understand. I called Toshiba direct on Jan 9th. They said the screen needs to be replaced, and they will do it no charge. They filed a claim and told me a repair rep would get to me within 48 hours. A week later I called Toshiba back. They said I needed to call the repair firm direct (why didn't they mention this the first time?) I called the repair firm direct. The company was Nexicore, who is a separate firm that does warranties. Nexicore needed to contact a repair firm in my area. Another 2 weeks went by. I called Nexicore AGAIN. They said the part had not come in yet, but when it does the local repair tech would contact me by phone and e-mail. Another 2 weeks went by, and I called Nexicore yet another time on Feb 1st 2012. They said the part was in and the repair tech had called and left messages (according to him). I told them nope, there is no way, and I never received an e-mail either, like I was supposed to. I originally gave them my business phone number and check messages daily. I re-confirmed the telephone numbers they had on file. I also gave them my cell number, and my cell phone is on me at all times. I am supposed to be getting \"a call soon.\" If not, I will call my credit card company, give them my exact documentation of 6 attempts to get this issue taken care of, and insist this TV be returned. I am a pretty understanding and laid back guy, but this is pushing it in my book. If I don't end up returning this, next time, I will spend a little more money and go with the V brand, which I have a 37\". I had one small problem with the 37\" V brand TV I had. That company was right on it, and I mean right now. Bottom line is that Toshiba repair service is very slow and unorganized. I have no idea if this will be fixed correctly. Whereas the TV looks great, colors are good, clarity is good, size is nice, apps work well, 3D works well, I would not buy another Toshiba because of the poor unorganized, very slow, and un-clarified service. Sorry folks. The TV is nice, but poor service counts with me.UPDATE: It's nearly a year later now. The tech finally came out and replaced the screen on this TV after multiple telephone calls on my part. He said \"I hate to tell you this, but it's not the screen. It's the mother board, but Toshiba says we have to repair it this way......one step at a time. I cannot tell you how many of these I have attempted to fix.\" Needless to say, I gave up after the problem was still there right after the tech replaced the screen (and he saw it). I called Amazon to return it. Amazon was really great to deal with, since I was past the 30 day mark. Once I explained the situation, and how long I had to wait to deal with repair service, they said \"pack it up and return it...we will credit you for it.\" Thank you Amazon!! What a great company to deal with. I ended up buying a 55\" Vizio with Internet, and I'm really glad I did. It's the 4th one I own, and I have only had one small issue with my 37\" once. They were right on it, and fixed it immediately. That is now my brand for TV's, and why I replaced the Toshiba with a Vizio. I have had great luck with them.

I cant say much about the tv widgets and net tv since i dont really use them i have my ps3 and comp hooked up so no need for them. Ive had this tv for about a month now and had zero problems with it. This is one of the cheapest if not the cheapest tv youll find out there for the 240hz 1080p 3d. I would recommend  this to any gamer or blu ray lover.

This incident has changed my opinion about Toshiba as a consumer electronics provider.The delivery and return process was handled very smoothly by Home Direct provided through Amazon.comFor any viewer who are not interested in home networking or internet browsing through TV, this is a good product with good picture quality and good 3D quality, the sound is not so good - but it can be adjusted to a reasonable level. The best thing about this TV is the built-in wireless adapter which connects to internet at very high speed and watching videos through Netflix or Vudu are smooth and easy without any buffering.

The people complaining about turn on/off time have never owned a smart TV.  First, the time is minuscule, smart TV aside, all large TV's take a few seconds to warm up.  Second, it's a smart TV, meaning it has a computer built in, it has to boot up and shut down properly.  There's an indicator light on the TV that removes all mystery, you know when it's booting up or shutting down, five or ten seconds is no big deal.  Not good for kids people say, hah!  Who spends this kind of money on a TV and then leaves it in the hands of children?  It's not a toy, either keep your spawn away from it or get a cheaper, featureless TV, simple.As for setup, it's nothing unusual, less than other models require.  You'll want to get familiar with the different pre-sets (movie/game/sports/etc.) and shut off the automatic dimmer.  The picture is outstanding, even when compared to TV's twice the price.  I do not see the backlight issues that others mention, as professional reviewers have mentioned, that's just splitting hairs.  You're not going to find another TV with these features at this price.As for aesthetics, this TV looks great.  It's simple, elegant and the TV itself is razor thin through and through.  The stand is one of the nicest I've seen anywhere, I was able to assemble all of it by myself, just read the instructions folks.The only downside is over-air channel switching and Netflix cache time.  Over-air channel changing does take a bit longer than expected, not horrible, but it could be better.  And, the channel guide only shows the station you're tuned to, requiring you to surf the spectrum to see what's on.  Netflix instant is not instant, although the GUI is the nicest I've seen for Netflix, it takes a while to cache before the movie starts (30 seconds to 5 minutes).  This has caused me to use a PS3 in it's place for Netflix, which works great with the TV's HDMI switching.  It's also worth noting that with the automatic HDMI passthrough, the TV remote controls the Playstation. The Netflix and channel switching/guide issues are the only reason that my rating is lacking that final star.  I'd hoped they would fix it with a firmware update, but Toshiba has moved on.All-in-all you're not going to get more TV for your buck.  Pandora is awesome (no ads), the Yahoo apps are useful, the remote is robust yet easy to use, the 3D is theater quality (uses the same glasses even), and the picture is outstanding.  You can nit-pick a device with this many features until the cows come home, but overall it's the best for the price, better than many at twice the cost.", "Date": "June 8, 2013"}, {"Title": "Worthless hunk of junk", "Author": "T.

Mericle \"Computer Geek\"", "ReviewID": "R17TN0Y7CWZTGB", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Before buying a TV, I did a bunch of research (literally hours), since it's a fairly big expense that will, hopefully, last a long time. I replaced a still-working LC-42SB45U 42\" 1080p 1920 x 1080 2000:1 LCD TV so wanted a set that was larger and 55\" seemed like a good size. I don't think I would want a bigger one at this point. One of my main reasons for buying a new TV was to get 3D. Since passive or natural 3D has lighter, cheaper glasses and less crosstalk and ghosting, I decided it was a must. Finally, because of the location of the windows and lights in my home, I wanted a TV with a matte screen. Most LED-LCD sets have glossy screens. I could only find two sets that met all three of my requirements, this one and the LG Infinia 55LW5600 55-Inch Cinema 3D 1080p 120 Hz LED-LCD HDTV with Smart TV and Four Pairs of 3D Glasses.I initially opted for the LG Infinia 55LW5600 55-Inch Cinema 3D 1080p 120 Hz LED-LCD HDTV with Smart TV and Four Pairs of 3D Glasses, however it only lasted a few hours before it stopped working. I wanted to simply have that one replaced, but it was permanently out of stock from Amazon.com itself. I toyed with the idea of buying from another seller, but a couple of things bothered me: LG's customer service was terrible and the screen on the LG, while matte, had an annoying rainbow reflection (I added a picture to that listing to illustrate this; the Toshiba does this, too, but to a less extent). So, I decided to buy the Toshiba 55TL515U 55-inch Natural 3D 1080p 240 Hz LED-LCD HDTV with Net TV, Black. I had read a couple of reviews from reputable sites which claimed that this Toshiba is good, but the LG is better overall. So, I prepared to console myself regarding the areas where this one didn't quite measure up to the LG. However, I was shocked at how much better the Toshiba 55TL515U is compared to the LG Infinia 55LW5600. I was surprised at how wrong those reviews got it. I was grateful that the LG broke right away, and that I chose to get this Toshiba to replace it.Toshiba 55TL515U versus the LG Infinia 55TL5600:* Toshiba has much better picture quality (color, deepness of black levels, contrast, clarity, and evenness of backlighting)* Toshiba has better aesthetics (TV is very thin, frame finish is nice, chrome accents are attractive, base of pedestal is glass)* Toshiba screen has less reflection/glare* Toshiba AutoView picture mode is much better than LG's default picture mode (LG's Intelligent Sensor dimmed the display too much when the room was dark)* Toshiba has built-in Wi-Fi (the LG has an included USB Wi-Fi dongle)* LG has a swivel pedestal* LG has more apps (apps on the Toshiba are okay, but there aren't as many)Because I have an Onkyo HT-S3400 5.1-Channel Home Theater System (mine is actually the HT-S3300), I have no reason to use the TV's sound so cannot comment on it, though other reviews mention that it's less than ideal. I have not yet used full 3D since I haven't connected a 3D Blu-ray player, but the 2D-to-3D conversion adds a nice amount of depth to the picture. I will say that the slow start-up time is annoying and is the primary reason I didn't give this TV 5 stars.

Anyway, I had a Toshiba 42\" LCD (REGZA 42RV530U) for the last 3 years and I thought it will be a nice upgrade to a 55\" LED, 240Hz and 3D. For this price there was nothing in the market and since I have had pretty good experience with the earlier Toshiba I went for this TV. What a mistake! We've had this TV for nearly 2 months now and I've sent it back to Toshiba for repair. Immediately after the TV arrived I noticed that there was way too much pixelation while watching cable channels. I tried Netflix and DVDs and the same thing happens. Watching sports on this TV is so awful and every time the ball goes up the air all you see is a bunch of pixels. Same goes with pretty much anything whenever there is motion. So much for the 240Hz! The earlier TV had only 60Hz and I always enjoyed watching sports on it. The backlighting was also pretty bad and there were white sports all over the screen. The earlier Toshiba also had some bleeding, but it was limited to the corners and never really bothered me unless it was a mainly black/dark screen. But this one has multiple patches all over the screen and its very visible while changing channels or inputs and makes your TV looks very cheap. I also updated the original firmware that came with the TV, still no improvement.Regarding 3D, there is a button on the remote which you can use to convert regular 2D programming into 3D. It works okay, but I don't think people will really use it all that much. Since its a passive 3D TV you can use your regular movie theater glasses (Real 3D) and no need to buy expensive glasses. The TV comes with four of those. For the regular 3D picture quality I can't comment on it yet as I'm only in the process of getting the new 3D Bluray player.The sound is not great, but I wouldn't list this as a complaint as a 55\" thin LED TV with hidden speakers should be used with a home theater system.Pros ------Looks very nice (when switched off!)Very thinMatt finish screen (I like this better than glossy ones, but its a personal preference)Lots of inputs/ports etc (4 HDMI, 1 optical audio out, 1 SVGA etc).Nice remote with backlit buttonsPicture clarity is good when there is no pixelation/backlighting (which happens all the time)Built in wi-fi (though app selection is limited and interface is poorly designed)Good cable/wire management setup on the back panelCons ------Picture quality is horrendous. So much pixelation and backlight bleedingTakes forever to start once you switch it onDoesn't remember the settings always. This is still a mystery to me. Sometimes the input switches back to ANT (antenna) or the picture size switches back to Zoom etc. No consistency here.Limited app selection and Netflix interface is a jokeNo buttons on the panel/side (not a major flaw, but just in case remote is not working or missing there isn't a backup)No true component or RCA audio out ports. The component RGB is combined into one output (Toshiba provides this and comes with the unit). Same for the audio out port (L & R are combined into one). There is an optical out (Toslink) though.Remote can't be configured as universal remote with other devices and/or Apple TV (minor issue)I originally wanted to return the TV and get a Samsung/LG instead, but I called in on the 31st day and hence the retailer won't take it back. Today I had the repair guys (Toshiba outsources this to some local company) come and pick it up. They already ordered the part (which is the panel and costs more than the TV apparently, the technician showed me the bill and asked how much I paid for the TV!) and hopefully I will get it back in 7-10 business days.Once I get the TV back I will do more testing and come back and update this review. As of now, I can give only two stars for this TV (1 for the looks/design and 1 for the price). Please go and check it out at a local store before you buy.--------Update after another month of replacing panel (Oct 3rd 2011).The picture quality is not bad, but nothing fixed the pixelation. 3d picture quality is better than regular HD programming and seems to be okay. However, now there is substantial white light bleeding from the corners now and it looks like there is a bulb switched on. It's impossible to watch dark or night scenes. I've had the same issue with my older Toshiba but it wasn't this prominent. This one is going back for repair again. What a nightmare it has been.--------Update after almost 6 months.I see the price has now dropped to around 1200 and it might be a good TV for that price.

He said the motherboard was bad and needed replacement.  After a week, he returned but had the wrong part.  So, another week goes by and he comes back with the right part.  He replaced it, but no change.  Then he said we needed a new wireless card. We were told after the 3rd service call, the tv would be replaced. The next thing we know, our local Sears took over and sent a local company to make repairs.  The new local company had no record of the first technicians repair attempts, so we were back to square 1.  The local company tried replacing the motherboard again, but no help.  They then came back and replaced the motherboard plus the wireless card, but no help.  By now, it's May of 2012.  Since then, it seems that the replacement parts are \"back-ordered\" so they can't come back for the 3rd time until they get the replacement part.Sears is being a total jerk of a company.  They will NOT refund our purchase price except for an in-store credit.  Needless to say, we're disgusted by the tv, the lack of support, and Sears' lack of cooperation.Never again will we purchase anything from Sears nor will we buy a Toshiba product again.", "Date": "June 21, 2012"}, {"Title": "Wonderfull TV", "Author": "tang32", "ReviewID": "R3R6PRWF1AZKP8", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I bought this TV about a week ago and it is perfect for me love everything some short comings the auto dimming switches alot sometimes during daylight times but not bad and I wish there were more apps for the internet but really good picture and the the 3D is good I havent yet watched a 3D Movie if you just watch it on regular movies it adds depth but thats about it so I cant wait to watch a 3D movie...

Not only do they sell defective product but their customer support is the worst i have ever seen! To start off, received this TV defective(box was in perfect condition), since it's winter the shipping guys told me to let it acclimate for 6 hours before plugging it in so it does not condensate on the inside and short out. After waiting overnight the TV turned on i did the setup and at the end of the setup the TV just shut off and 2 seconds later i heard the TV turn on again. I thought it it was some type of setting finishing the setup but then it just started turn on and off constantly. I first called customer support from Toshiba and they tell me that they are very sorry about it and that they will make a ticket for the issue and that someone from a repair company would call me within the next 4 hours. Nobody calls, i wait until the next day and call Toshiba back and they said that they will only call within their business hours(8am to 3pm eastern time, i am in the Midwest) i then call the repair company on their business hours and they tell me that they have not received anything from Toshiba and if they did they would have a automated system call me to let me know that they have received the repair ticket with the information they need to fix the TV. I then call Toshiba again and they said they had a problem in their system and that the call ticket was never sent to the repair company and that they will resend the ticket. I wait 24 hours and called the repair company again and they said that they were waiting on Toshiba to send them the part(usually overnight) and that when they receive the part someone will call me and set up a time to repair the TV. I wait 4 days and still nothing so I call the repair company again and they said that they still have not received the part to make the repair so i call Toshiba again(Saturday) and they state that the system that they are using cannot let them know where the part is and that i needed to talk with a manager(forgot exact the name of the manager) to escalate my claim and that they are only in during business hours(Monday-Friday 8am-3pm eastern time) so I had to wait to call them back. I call them back Monday morning and they told me that the part i needed is on backorder and that I had to wait 5 to 18 days for the part to go out and if it did not i would have to call them back to escalate my claim again. I wait a full week(6 days) and call them back the following Monday to check on the part. Today is Monday and the part is still not out and that I have to wait a few more day until the full 18 days so they can escalte my claim AGAIN so they can do something about it. I have decided to return this TV to Amazon. Called Amazon support and they will come and pick this pain in the rear TV in the next few days and will give me a refund as soon as they get the TV back. Amazon support helped me and with only maybe 10 minutes of my time. I will give Amazon credit they helped me out without jumping through hoops and waiting for ever to talk to someone. I bought this TV hoping to get a \"Good\" deal on a \"Good\" TV but have regretted every minute of it. Give it good thought before buying this TV and beware this is not the first complaint on the net on this TV for the exact same problem!!!! Hate hate hate Toshiba and their customer support.
