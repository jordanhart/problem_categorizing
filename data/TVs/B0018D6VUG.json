{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Excellent HDTV for the price", "Author": "Louis R. Primus", "ReviewID": "R10UC8DNZBPN7Y", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "So far, I have no complaints.  This TV doubles as a monitor, and it serves that purpose well.  After dialing down the brightness and adjusting my computer's resolution to match the 1440 x 900 resolution of the TV, it looks great.  The connection is DVI (computer) to HDMI (TV).  The TV also has a VGA connection you could use, and I imagine the quality is just as good.Since I don't have HD service from my satellite provider, I get only standard resolution broadcast, so an s-video connection was fine for that.  Quality is so-so, but since I was more interested in the TV's use as a monitor, I'm not complaining.  I can always upgrade to HD later, or try out an antenna.", "Date": "March 26, 2009"}, {"Title": "This TV is junk!", "Author": "brownstone47", "ReviewID": "R1PKX2ZQ77MDV2", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "Save your money.
