I did a lot of research over a period of many months before making this purchase and it really paid off. I got a great price from Amazon and the product itself is wonderful! Great picture, terrific color, easy to set up and use, great features, very attractive sleek design. It allows you to either go with the standard settings or make all kinds of adjustments to the sound and picture from the easy-to-use menu options. You can customize your settings (and save them) for the various HDMI and other inputs. I ordered it late on a Sunday evening and it was already out for delivery to my home on Wednesday morning. Pilot Air Freight called ahead to make arrangements for whatever delivery time was convenient for me. You choose your own time right down to the half hour, in fact, my deliver person was actually early! They gave me free white gloves delivery with a very friendly, prompt, and careful delivery person. They bring it into the house, unpack it and put it on your TV stand, all in just a few minutes--and in perfect condition! Non-HD over the air broadcasts look fairly decent on it. Ordinary DVDs look excellent--even from an ordinary DVD player. It has a USB port so you can look at your digital photos on the big 52\" screen, and believe me it makes them look fantastic--and huge! It's at its best when you watch Blu-Ray movies on it. They just look incredibly beautiful and the sound is gorgeous, even with just the onboard speakers. I can't wait to hear how it sounds with my new receiver and surround speakers! And it can play Master Audio disks. You can't go wrong with this TV. The price is right and it's worth every penny and then some. I love it! Thanks again to Amazon for a great product at a great price with super fast high quality free delivery!", "Date": "November 14, 2008"}, {"Title": "The Jekyll & Hyde of HDTVs", "Author": "webapalooza \"webapalooza\"", "ReviewID": "R3UYXT1DW7NNC0", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I spent a good 6 months researching HDTVs, reading reviews and visiting local stores to check them out before I decided on the Sony 52XBR6.  But now I'm returning it; read on to find out why.The only reason I went with an LCD instead of a plasma was because of the screen reflection issue.  Our TV will be directly across from a large bay window, with our sofa in-between the two.  So my wife and I didn't want to constantly have a reflection of the window behind us in the TV screen.  So I never even considered plasma for this single reason.After speaking to local salespeople, they recommended the Sony XBR6 over all other LCDs, including Samsung.  They informed me that although Samsung TVs look nice, they have a quality control issue, where they allow an error rate of 8%-9% off the production line, as opposed to Sony who only allows 1%-2%.  One store I went to that services the brands they sell said they stopped carrying the Samsung TVs altogether because they were spending too much time fixing them!  So I ordered the Sony XBR6 and my wife and I eagerly awaited delivery.Upon setting it up, the picture was fine: very clear, and HDTV channels looked crazy good.  We popped in the Planet Earth Blu-ray disc, and again we were blown away.  I also liked the on-screen menus -- very fluid, sorta like the PS3 or an iPhone.  We couldn't have been happier.  Little did we know that we were seeing the \"Dr. Jekyll\" side of this TV, and once nightfall came the \"Mr. Hyde\" side would emerge...That night, we sat down to watch a movie on Blu-ray.  Almost immediately, even before the opening credits came up (while the screen was still dark), I noticed lights shining from the corners and edges across the screen.  There were also a couple of cloudy patches.  I pointed them out to my wife, and she said \"It looks like a marquee sign!\"I played around with the picture settings for a while, but even when I set the backlight to \"Min\" (the lowest setting) and the power saving mode to \"High\" (which is supposed to reduce the backlight to save energy), I could still see the lights.  Of course, when the movie was playing I rarely saw them because the picture on-screen overwhelmed the flaws in the backlight.  But whenever a dark scene came on, or a scene faded to black before the next scene faded in, you could see these lights.  I saw the lights no matter what the source: Blu-ray, DVD, cable TV.  My stomach sank, because I found it so distracting that I knew I couldn't keep the TV if something couldn't be done.I contacted Sony tech support through their online chat feature, and after describing the problem and following a few of their troubleshooting tips, the problem remained.  That's when the Sony tech support said, and I quote:\"This is the characteristic drawback of LCD technology. If you think that the LCD technology is not acceptable, you may purchase a plasma display to avoid the clouds.\"Here's the kicker... Sony doesn't even make plasma TVs!  So they were basically telling me to return their TV and buy a competitor's product!So why am I giving this TV 3 stars instead of 1?  Because in all fairness it does produce a great picture when feeding it an HD signal, as long as the picture is relatively bright all across the screen.  If you watch mostly sports, sitcoms, and animation, you'll probably never notice the flaws in the backlight.  But if you watch a lot of movies or TV dramas with dark scenes in them, you'll find the backlight flaws totally unacceptable.  Maybe you'll get lucky and get one without flaws in the backlight, but that's the chance you're taking.As for me, I'm getting a plasma, reflections be damned.  In fact, I took my wife out to see the Panasonic plasmas at the same store where we bought the XBR6, and she said, \"THAT'S the reflection you're talking about?  That's not bad at all, I can live with that.\"  And besides, that's what curtains are for, right?  So it looks like our replacement TV will be a Panasonic plasma.But don't take my word for it -- see for yourself.  I posted some photos of the leaking backlight here: [...]", "Date": "January 3, 2009"}, {"Title": "Dazzling picture", "Author": "Terry94705", "ReviewID": "R8QHTOA2TXTNO", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This was a big jump up. The last TV was a 6 year old 20 inch JVC tube, so you might think we would be easy to dazzle. Nevertheless I did a lot of research before springing for this one.  Got it to watch DVDs; we don't have cable or dish, just an indoor antenna.  We were really surprised at all the new (digital) channels we got, even without upgrading our antenna --so don't be hasty in assuming you need to have an outdoor antenna, cable, etc., especially if you are in a metropolitan area.The old analog stations (say, channel 9) come in pathetically, but usually there are other stations associated with each number. For example, we now get digital 9.1, 9.2 and 9.3 --three different programs where we used to get one.  This was all a pleasant surprise.  We got digital versions of all the old channels and 7-8 new ones.  We even get a San Jose station that we haven't seen in years.Everything on the digital channels is gorgeous.  When I was shopping I saw big HDTVs where the non-HD picture was stretched and distorted, but you don't have to set it that way. You can set it so that each program comes in at its optimal picture quality. Some day, hopefully, it will all be HD, but the SD stuff looks pretty good on this set!  As for the Bravia XBR6 specifically, great black-blacks, but your detail within shadows is not sacrificed. It came set to \"vivid\" color setting, but I find the standard setting more natural. REally stunning picture!  Haven't watched any blu-ray disks yet (no player) but the standard DVDs look fabulous!This was a big purchase but I am very happy with it.  And--at least in the SF Bay area-- delivery was faster than projected and the CEVA white glove service was fine. They do not connect your components for you  but they do put it on a stand and power it up so you can be sure all your pixels, sound, etc, function.", "Date": "October 31, 2008"}, {"Title": "Beware of Mura", "Author": "R. Berg \"Bob\"", "ReviewID": "R1BC57FV3OGF9L", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Until the XBR8 is shipping, this is the top-of-the-line Sony LCD television.  Consequently, as you might expect, the color, image, and performance are superb.  The picture is honestly nothing short of spectacular.It was a great disappointment, however, to discover that \"mura\" (also called black clouding), an irregularity in the LCD panel that keeps it from going dark evenly during playback of a very dark scene or during a dip-to-black in the program material, is STILL an issue with the XBR6 family.  I found posts about this problem as far back as the XBR2.Simply said, \"mura\" (the japanese word for \"unevenness\") is a quality control issue. Some sets have it, some don't.  The larger the panel is, the harder it is to build it perfectly, and the nature of LCD backlighting makes it difficult to build a large, LCD screen that renders a pure black screen evenly without clouding.  But not impossible.  You see many 40\" sets with no mura at all.  Other manufacturers' 52's that have fewer accolades about their onscreen images don't seem to have the problem, although, admittedly, their operating images may not look anywhere near as good as images seen on this tv.Amazon is shipping my 2nd unit even as I write this...so we will see whether my first was just a bad panel, or whether Sony Customer Service's comment that \"some mura is typical of this unit and LCD technology\" is accurate.This is Sony, after all...and it's their best-of-the-best product in the family (if you don't count the $7,000 XBR8).  You don't expect \"good enough\" from Sony; they are the unit against which all others are judged, which means you expect \"perfect\".----Thursday, November 27, 2008I'm happy to report that the second unit supplied by Amazon is considerably more uniform in low light.  In a pitch black room, there is still a small amount of black level mura, but it is so much better than the first unit that I can live with it.  In a nutshell, if your viewing area is a very dark, movie-theater-like environment, you may see what I'm talking about.  But if you have even a small amount of ambient light in your room, you probably won't.", "Date": "November 22, 2008"}, {"Title": "Worth the Price", "Author": "J. McGee", "ReviewID": "RLS4BS2MRQVQO", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I bought the Sony 52XBR6 after nine months of research, including reading reviews of various LCD models on Amazon.com.  I found the reviews very helpful so that's why I'm taking the time to write this.I was considering buying a 52-inch Samsung model because of the many positive reviews, including top ratings in Consumers Reports. However a couple of the reviews mentioned Samsung's highly reflective screen.  That wouldn't work in my Arizona home.  The XBR6 is in my family room, the southern wall of which is all windows so we get lots of sunlight. No problem for the Sony.When I ordered the XBR6 I also bought a Sony BDP-S350 Blu-ray player and a Sony STR-DG720 audiovisual receiver, all through Amazon.  I've only had them for a week so still learning about them but they work great.  Last night I watched a blu-ray disc about Australia.  The picture was so clear I could stand within two feet of the screen without seeing pixels - amazing.I don't have a home theater set up yet. For audio I'm alternating between the TV's speakers and two JBL speakers (Model 4312 Control Monitor) I've had for years. The DG720 receiver's audio settings allowed me designate the JBLs as Front Speakers and combine the 7.1 multi-channels through them without loss. The receiver's audio settings are so flexible I can later add speakers, such as a front speaker and/or a sub-woofer, and just change the settings to accomodate them.  I really like that.My only complaints so far are the user-unfriendly operating manuals for the blu-ray disc and especially for the receiver.  Here's a couple of paragraphs from the STR-DG720 Operating Instructions:\"Sound may be interrupted when the sampling frequency, the number of channels or the audio format of the audio output signals from the playback component is switched\" (page 21)\"IF YOU CONNECT A SUB WOOFER.  This receiver will generate a low frequency signal for output to the sub woofer when there is no LFE signal, which is a low-pass sound effect output from a sub woofer to a 2 channel signal.  However, the low frequency signal is not generated for 'NE06 CIN' or 'NE06 MUS' when all speakers are set to 'LARGE'.\" (page 53)You audiophiles out there might read these and say \"of course\" but my response was \"huh?\"  Anyway, by comparison the TV's operating instuctions were a piece of cake.One final comment. I chose the slower, no cost, delivery option but still received the White Glove service because of the size of the TV. The delivery company's paperwork including the recommendation that I keep the large carton for a while in case the TV had to be returned.  However,the truck driver said he never had to return a Sony.", "Date": "November 20, 2008"}, {"Title": "What a picture!", "Author": "J. Carlile \"JC\"", "ReviewID": "R4PVGNXO79SDI", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I must say, colors pop out on this set like nothing I've seen before.  They're extremely vibrant, amplififed by the 50,000:1 contrast ratio which makes for deep blacks.  In a pitch dark room, the black levels nearly blend in with the surrounding environment.  This is important to me since my viewing area is very dark with no ambient lighting.Sound, for me, is not important on a TV since I have a home theater system.  I imagine most people buying such a big, expensive set are in the same boat.  I have listened to the speakers and I must say there's nothing special about them IMO. They're not big enough to put out much bass. I just took down my 8 year old 35\" Trinitron CRT and I hear no improvement on sound quality.  If you're planning on buying this TV and don't have a home theater system, I'd suggest looking into one.One of the only cons I can see so far is what another reviewer called \"mura\", or slightly cloudy areas on the screen when it's completely black.  I only notice this when nothing else is on the screen so it's not that huge a concern, but I did knock off one star because of that.  It's not enough of a problem for me to send the set back since the next one could be worse, and I haven't noticed it so far when something's on the screen. If the screen went evenly black, I'd easily give this set five stars.  I'm also not impressed by the remote.  The volume and channel buttons are awkwardly placed, making the remote off-balance when using them.  And the illuminate feature is lacking since key words aren't written on the buttons but above them, keeping them in the dark as the button is lit.  They could take some notes from Onkyo on this; their illuminated remotes are superb, and I use my universal Onkyo remote for this TV rather than the one included.All in all, I'm very happy with this TV.  The picture is by far the best I've ever seen. I would shop around for the best deal, however.  I had this in my Amazon cart at less than $2,300, and when I went to pay for it the price flew up to $2,500.  That's still not a bad price for this TV, but Amazon's prices on the set are all over the place as I'm sure you know if you've been watching.  There are places online that sell it cheaper, but be sure to review their policies before making a purchase, and don't fall for the high-pressure sales tactics that many employ.", "Date": "December 11, 2008"}, {"Title": "Five Stars but for I/O Layout", "Author": "Home Network Guy", "ReviewID": "R2U1GEEPUR4O0I", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Three quick points:(1) White Glove Delivery -- This is a big and expensive set, so I was a little stressed about delivery.  But I needn't have been.  Amazon's delivery service was excellent; the two representatives were competent and respectful (took off their shoes, didn't rush, unpacked and set up the set, etc.) -- a great experience.(2) Picture -- This set replaces a four year old Runco 50\" plasma in a large room with lots of windows/daylight.  What a difference:  not only is the picture just as sharp and detailed as the Runco, it is *bright* and easily visible, without reflections.  If you need to fill a big and well-lit room, this set will do it.(3) Mechanical Layout -- The only reason this TV doesn't get five stars from me is the illogical placement of the I/O ports (including the power cable connection) on the back.  Basically, there are four (and only four!) wall mounting points (holes for bolts) on the back, arranged like a square.  But the power connection is directly between two of them and the other I/O ports (HDMI, component, etc.) are in a group directly beside and on horizontal line connecting the bottom two mounting points.  This means that typical mounting brackets, which form what looks like a tic-tac-toe arrangement of four metal bars, actually cover most of the ports, making them unreachable.  I needed to saw off part of the lower mounting plate to make the ports accessible.  All that trouble would have been avoided by placing all the I/O ports in an area not on a straight line connecting any two of the four mounting points.  A silly mechanical design, but correctable (with a hacksaw!).  Anyway, all's well now, and this is a great set, and maybe my sawing experience would be avoided with a mount that doesn't have a cross-hatch (tic-tac-toe) bracket.", "Date": "November 29, 2008"}, {"Title": "super duper tv", "Author": "S. Stratton", "ReviewID": "R1KBDNW4KZLVHD", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Bought this TV about a month ago and it is really awesome. I love sony - you always know it's quality. Especially at the Amazon price - don't even think twice about this one. Delivery went well - no dead pixels - and the picture quality is really great.If you already own a cheaper large LCD (I also have a Vizio), you won't be blown away by the difference at first, but when I go back and watch my Vizio now, I notice the little differences. The sony just has deeper blacks and brighter brights. Its picture can be adjusted so you don't get much of that annoying LCD jutter, too (see next paragraph). In fact, the sony just has a lot more options overall, and it's really easy to customize to the way you like it (which you really should do to get the best experience).One suggestion: I've heard the complaint about the \"motionflow\" effect, which you can turn on to smooth out the picture and recude the LCD \"jutter\" you get during panning scenes, etc. Motionflow does make the picture extremely smooth - almost like you're watching something shot on a camcorder. While this elimiates jutter, it also takes the \"weight\" away from films, which are shot in a special way to give them that \"movie\" feel. Most complain that the motionflow makes movies too smooth to watch, and I agree - it's excellent for sports but I couldn't stand it during movies. But after messing with the settings, I've discovered that it's not only Motionflow that's to blame, it's a combination of the TV's Motionflow and Cinemotion effects. Go to the \"Home\" menu and edit the picture settings. Turn Cinemotion to \"Auto 2\" across all the inputs (mine was set to Auto 1 by default, which is the highest setting). Now watch a movie and crank up the Motionflow, and you'll notice extra smoothness but without that \"shot with a camcorder\" feel. I'm still playing with the settings but so far this seems like the best way to reduce jutter and get a great picture that's true to the orginial content.", "Date": "December 26, 2008"}, {"Title": "Outstanding HD TV", "Author": "George E.

The image has stuck with me despite my feeling that it wouldn't ever happen; there's something about sitting in a relaxing chair and reading the paper that goes unmatched with reading the paper on a computer monitor. But the primary difference is actually the chair. Who has a comfy reading chair in front of their computer?Sony's HDTV's have, in the last few years, crossed over from being only worthy as a television monitor to having qualities comparable to the best computer monitors. Their XBR2 series, which I just replaced, allowed for some crossover activities, but I was never particularly pleased with using that TV for computing activities.So now here we have a 52\" HDTV/Computer monitor, and while I realize that none of you are actually thinking of buying this to be your primary computer screen, quite a number of you will, I suspect, eventually use it as such as time passes and you realize what you have.Let's start by talking about Amazon's delivery service. Delivery came four days after my order, so that part worked well. But there was only one guy driving the delivery van. Have you ever seen one person try to carry a fully boxed 52\" TV? Not sure what the delivery company was thinking, but it was clear I wasn't going to get \"white glove\" service. With my help, we brought in the TV and uncrated it in the middle of the foyer to be certain that it had no cosmetic damage. Friends later helped move it into place.After an hour or so of rewiring (as now I can use the HDMI output of my cable box and Bluray player), attaching the external over-the-air rabbit ears (and if you've never seen OTA HDTV, it's a must -- not only a better picture but also more subchannel options than you get from your cable box), and setting it up for HDMI inputs from a digital camera, hooking it up to the wireless network via an Ethernet cable to an Apple Airport, and using its digital output to run a line to the sound processor, we were good to go. The TV works flawlessly. We had no difficulties with the setup process. The interface is similar to the one for Sony's Bluray players, so there's some benefit to staying within a brand family here.Overall, as others have already described, the picture is magnificent. After comparing it in the store to the 55XBR8, I can't say that I miss the slight advantage that the XBR8 has in picture quality. For the difference in price (about $4k), the XBR6 will be fine. Going from a CRT based HDTV to an LCD panel does have its differences. The only downside I've seen is that analog-based shows on older DVD's have a tendency to show some compression-related artifact that I never noticed on the CRT. Analog broadcasts are fair - Star Trek:TNG, for example, looks like it was filmed entirely through gauze. Standard DVDs look wonderful, particularly with the Bluray player, and all the HD sources are perfect, and so crisp in 1080p as to be three-dimensional in quality.Hooking up a digital camera through an HDMI output (such as available on the Canon 50D), leads to the ability to have family slide shows in a comfortable spot (the living room, where we used to pull out the slide projector) instead of surrounding the computer monitor. And the images look wonderful - we're not quite where we used to be. I still think projected Kodachromes have advantages over the digital reproduction at this size, but we're getting awfully close.The interesting thing is that the XBR6 has a VGA input that is really usable. Hooking a computer up will allow you to use this as a 52\" computer monitor. That means that the TV becomes a wireless internet hub even without the Ethernet input. Get your mail, look at pictures, play music (yes, there's a separate audio computer input), and read the newspaper now that some newspapers allow you to access the exact image of the newspaper as it appeared in print. And it all looks just as good (well, better, really) as it does on a dedicated computer monitor.So it's now a reasonable reality that you can purchase a computer, a BlueTooth keyboard and mouse, hook it into the back of the TV, and then use the TV as a dedicated entertainment hub when tied into the home theater sound processing equipment. Sure, you could have done that a few years ago, but it wouldn't have looked this good or worked well enough to lead to your actually using the equipment this way.

Sony actually shows you the picture as it's meant to be.The color range offered by the 10 bit panel & processor is very vivid. the 120hz Motion flow is perfected and honestly you cannot tell the difference if you purchase the 240hz in XBR7, you just pay almost 2,000.00 extra for a feature you won't feel.If you are watching this TV in pitch black room and you have a pitch black scene (with nothing but black in it) you will feel \"the clouding effect\" aka Mura, but it's not even worth mentioning since this is only viewable if nothing else was on the TV...I did the calibration using DVE bluray disk and using the THX. i want to say the the DVE was more detailed and specific than THX, but the calibration is highly recommended.I hooked the TV to my PS3 and the whole experience was beyond Amazing... on my previous SDTV i could hardly read anything in the PSN now it's all crystal clear and beautiful.

My panel lasted slightly longer then T.Lam's, I got 20 months of that beautiful picture, I mean crappy panel.Problem:  One day I started seeing vertical sparkly lines on the top/middle and right side of the screen.  At first it was a few lines. A couple weeks later,  the screen has a dozen or so sparkly lines down the middle and right side.  The lines are standard grid pattern from the panel, each about 8\" long.I contacted Sony. Technician came out ($125 from my pocket) and confirmed it was a bad panel.  Technician told me new panel is $2400 and said I should basically trash it, not worth fixing.I agree, why the heck would I pay $2400+labor to replace a panel that might have the same exact problem again in short time.Now it's time to go shopping for a new TV. Obviously, I will never buy another Sony product.  When I get a new TV I'm going to take a bat to this one and hang it from my garage with a big sign that says Sony TV's are crap.

The S550 came in a couple of days, the TV was almost immediately listed as being at Pilot which is the third party delivery service used my Amazon for my area near Birmingham, Alabama.  Amazon also uses CEVA in other areas of the country.[...][...]The TV picture is fantastic in both SD and HD. I immediately played the only Blu-ray DVD I had, \"Kung Fu Panda\" in 1080p and was thoroughly impressed. Then I used my Dish network to play all my SD stations, they all looked great. I planned to upgrade my Dish network to their HD package but the SD picture was so nice I was worried I wouldn't see much of a difference. Well, I upgraded and the HD channels on Dish (which are all 1080i) look super. I don't want to review Dish HD here but I found  many (about half) of the Dish HD channels that are marked HD are \"a work in progress\" -- they come in letterboxed and don't look like HD, the other half look just like the output of my Blu-ray player, very sharp! The golf channel is so good it changes the viewing experience, I can see the slopes in the green and read the putts!I am so pleased with the \"out-of-the-box\" picture that to date I have not made a single adjustment to the picture. I usually use the TV speakers which are very good but when I watch a Blu-ray movie I switch the audio to my stereo. The \"variable\" audio output on the back of the TV allows me to control the volume using the TV remote. It also has a \"fixed\"audio out option but I haven't used it.The TV is very nice looking, I don't notice a glare from the black bezel as some others have noted. Nor have I seen the \"mura\" or uneven backlighting some others report. The blacks are so deep that if there is an all black border, the black bezel merges with a black background and I can't tell where the TV picture stops and the bezel begins.As you face the TV all of the input connections on the back of the TV are on the left which, for my installation, was surprisingly inconvenient since the far left on a 52 inch TV meant the \"center\" connections on my old TV had to be rerouted quite a bit to get to the connections of this very wide TV. It would seem more logical for Sony to group all the connections at the center of the TV.I connected my Nintendo Wii up to one of the standard video ports on the TV, it worked fine with no adjustments needed. The Wii sensor bar fits and blends nicely on the top bezel which is flat.Overall, my Amazon buying experience (price and delivery) was superb and the Sony 52XBR6 TV is fantastic and combined with the Sony S550 Bl-ray player produces a very high quality and detailed picture.", "Date": "January 18, 2009"}, {"Title": "Second Time's the Charm", "Author": "A. Nichols", "ReviewID": "R1NHQWE1WH2DSC", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "There are many reviews already raving about this amazing 52XBR6 TV, so I'll just say that I fully concur. Therefore I'll share some of the other great things about my Amazon experience.First, while waiting for a great sale price after Thanksgiving, and seeing the price bounce all around the $2400-range, I pulled the trigger at $2349. Two days later it hit $2219 for just an afternoon. I called Amazon and asked for a credit, and they took care of it, $130 back in my pocket.Second, delivery was great, not once, but twice! (more on that in a minute) TV arrived about a week after I ordered it, excellent! Pilot Freight came in, unboxed the TV, set it on the stand, let me check it out, then left with the box, 10 minutes tops.Third, a few days into ownership, I noticed the clouding effect (mura) that a few people have discussed in this forum. It was slight, and only noticeable on a totally black screen, but it was there. I waited a couple weeks, cleaned the screen a few times, but it didn't go away. For this price, definitely calling for a replacement. Called Amazon, very friendly Customer Service, explained the issue, and in less than 5 minutes I had another TV on the way. Seven days later the new set arrives. Pilot brings it in, sets it on the stand, and takes the first TV with them. Simple enough.Lastly, I continued to use my TV while waiting on the replacement, so I truly had no down time and really no hassle at all. I've had the replacement set about a week and no clouding (mura). I've read that the mura is a manufacturing defect in the LCD screen, its either there, or its not.In summary, as with many of my Amazon purchases, I'm very pleased with both the product and the service. So if you're looking for a new 52\" TV, buy this Sony, and buy it from Amazon, the price and service can't be beat!", "Date": "January 10, 2009"}, {"Title": "Wow!", "Author": "William R.

At BB, the samsung model really stood out because of its style and picture.  What finally sold me on the KDL52XBR6 was the consumer reports ratings for manufacturing defects of the Samsung models. Sony ranked number 2 in manufacturing defects and samsung was much further down the list.  No one who has bought an LCD Tv from Amazon with an extended service plan has had a good turn around time for repair. My choice was based on going with Sony because of the quality of the manufacturing process and near perfect picture.  I think that the Samsung model has a slightly better picture and added abilitites to stream network media but for ease of use, ease of setup, and reliability Sony can't be beaten.

Picture quality is excellent on both systems, and both TVs have gained the all important approval of my wife.  The \"MotionFlow\" can create an \"odd\" look to fast moving images - such as when a football player is running down the field - but setting the system to less active settings returns the picture to the type/style I'm more comfortable watching.  I would not consider myself an ardent supporter of all Sony products (as I've had issues with other items, such as their AV receivers), but in the area of LCD televisions I believe you can't go wrong with their XBR line.  Amazon's free White Glove delivery (via Pilot) was fast and efficient, too.", "Date": "December 13, 2008"}, {"Title": "Oustanding Picture Quality", "Author": "gone_west", "ReviewID": "R3KD1DBU1IPS9N", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Previous Setup: Sony Wega 36 + basic cable for locals / direct  tv for everything else + tivo + Bose Lifestyle 1-2 System for sound.Current Setup: Sony 52XBr6 + direct tv dvr (dual channel) for everything including local channels + Bose Lifestyle 1-2 System for sound + Ethernet connection to the direct tv dvr for on demand service. Upgrading the satellite dish for HD capability also got us a dish that could handle local signals.Yet to do for setup:  Use the network features of the set and add a blue ray player. Since we rarely used the dvd or vhs that were connected to the Sony Wega, a blue ray is a low priority.  We will probably never use the tv for playing games.Delivery: Oustanding. Ordered through Amazon and received the set  in 5 business days. One notice from Amazon when the set shipped and would be at my house, and one notice from the delivery company about delivery time.  I did nothing but open the door for the delivery folks. They took care of the unpacking and setting up the tv.  They made sure the remote and the set worked, and they were off after no more than 15-20 minutes from start to finish.Picture Quality: More than for any other reason, this is why I bought this tv.  For me, the decision process started and ended with picture quality, everything else a set had to offer was just extras, nice to have or something to ignore.  On the XBR6, HD is stunning. SD is excellent. This is equally true for sports, movies, news, evening soaps. The XBR6 delivers a vibrant picture whether you are sitting straight in front of it or off to one side or the other.  The factory settings are very close to the mark, if not on it. If you decide to tweek the picture for personal preferences or to accommodate room lighting,  the manual and online menus are easy to follow and offer concise explanations.No reflective glare:  Concern about glare and reflection  was a critical decision point for me because the set was going into a room with multiple windows and skylights  Daytime with the Sony Wega's reflective crt screen had been horrible. Now, after watching the XBR6 on a few sunny days in a row, glare and reflections are subdued/tamed except on very dark scenes.  On colorful scenes, the glare and reflections just aren't noticeable.  I am very pleased.  My expectations have been more than exceeded.  The Samsungs I strongly considered as well as a couple of plasma sets got nixed because of my concerns about reflection and glare. A small negative for me is the reflective quality of the plastic frame around the set.Sound System:  Sound quality from the tv was never a decision factor for me just as it wasn't 10 years ago.  A 10 year old Bose Lifestyle 1-2 system  was easily  connected, and  its Dolby 5.1 output sounds better than ever.Quality and reliability: Sony is number one in service and reliability.  The rest are still learning.  You can look it up. I did.Misc. : 1. We have a small net monthly savings by going with direct tv for the local channels, dvr and hd. This amount does not include the foregone costs for tivo since we had paid a one time fee for the life of the unit to avoid month to month subscription fees to it. This amount does include the rip-off monthly fee increase for high speed internet access from the cable company because we discontinued cable service. After eight years with tivo, I thought I'd miss it more than I have, but the features on the direct tv dvr are very similar.2. There is a couple of seconds delay when switching from one channel to the next. I assume it is due to the  line from the satellite that is being multiplexed as a dual line. It is more than acceptable to me, but the pause that refreshes is noticeable.3. The Tv Guide feature that Sony is promoting is useless for satellite subscribers because it is incompatible (unsupportable?) with them and also redundant, just as it is with cable.4. You don't need to pay a premium for hdmi cables. See the discussion on avsforums about them as well as their discussions about lcd televisions.  The discussions can be over the top and sometimes make a fringe issue sound like it is the center of the universe. These folks care about their viewing experiences. They also seem to know something. They are more reasonable than a person who faults a set sold in the US for not supporting a frame rate used overseas.5. When doing diligence, I used cnet's reviews, myproductadvisor (to better understand my own requirements and what features are out there, although it seems to have a Samsung bias), other expert reviews, end user reviews (like this one and the others here), the manufacturer websites, and visits to several stores to see with my own eyes.6.  I am 100% satisfied, a very happy camper. I had high expectations from order placement to the day to day set usage, and those high expectations have been met. Sony, Amazon, direct tv and Bose are a great combination, and they've clicked at every level for me. I think they are the best at what they do.Thanks for listening. I had fun.

Marino \"GeekDomo\"", "ReviewID": "RKH9ZBMQTEO13", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I was fortunate to demo this unit for over 2 months and the entire time I owned it I was flabbergasted at the beauty of the image. The blacks are really black and the colors pop with little to no banding (shaded color bands sometimes show up on an image). I saw no pixization or any real jaggies.Usually in my reviews I get all geekafied in my tech specs. Sony has provided many if not all specs you will need right on the Amazon page. I will however, try to explain the resolution thing a little.1080p is so much higher quality than the 1080i. I looked up some info about it and here it is:--------------What is 1080p?The number \"1080\" represents 1,080 lines of vertical resolution (1080 horizontal scan lines), while the letter p stands for progressive scan (meaning the image is not interlaced). 1080p can be referred to as full HD or full high definition to differentiate it from other HDTV video modes. The term usually assumes a widescreen aspect ratio of 16:9, implying a horizontal resolution of 1920 pixels. This creates a frame resolution of 1920\u00d71080, or 2,073,600 pixels in total. The frame rate in Hertz can be either implied by the context or specified after the letter p (or i), such as 1080p30, meaning 30 Hz--------------What this boils down to is a picture that is exceedingly life-like. With the Sony brand you can be sure of high quality. While you might find a 1080p television somewhere at a lesser price, you may pay for it in the end.Justified:Last year I threw away a 1985 25\" Sony Trinitron television. In its day it was hugely expensive. But it lasted 22 years. If this television lasts that long the cost per year ownership is like $9 a month.Sony also has a really good tech support. On my Grand Wega I had an issue and within 2 days a tech showed up at my house to fix it. All parts and labor were taken care of (it was still under warranty).You really need to see this television for yourself to understand the beauty of the picture. It is astounding. Watching NFL games on it made it seem like you are sitting in the stands, except for the beer and hot dogs its is as real as it gets!To really rate this tv head over to your local big box store and demo it. Then come here and buy it for significantly less.Pros:>> Amazing clarity of picture>> Awesome universal remote>> Black blacks>> little to no bandingCons:<< Costs (see justification above)<< getting furniture to match it (ultra modern looking)<< 3D interface was not so user friendly but very manageableIf you buy this television I doubt you will regret it.

Purchasing this TV is the culmination of our research. We narrowed our choice between SONY, Samsung, and Panasonic Plasma.This thing looks great out of the box in both HD and SD. The brightness is cranked all the way up and you can tell. So I've turned that down a couple of notches on all my inputs.Not all 120hz sets are equal, this setting is highly dependent on the TV's processor, and SONY simply has the best. There are three settings for this function (off, normal, and high). Normal mode is perfect, the image really pops off the screen and NO ARTIFACT with action/sports! High mode is just too artificial looking. Even off mode looks great, more like watching a movie in a theater, less polished.The contrast ratio is excellent, and in a dark room it looks great. No light bleeding, rich dark blacks. No glare, and we have it in a room with a lot of windows.The colors are vibrant without being too \"over the top\" which I found the Samsung sets to be. There are plenty of adjustments that aren't too complicated. Each input can be adjusted individually which is nice when switching from cable to video games to blue ray player. Cinema mode makes the TV look just like a plasma set (warm and dark).The speakers are actually great, however, I don't use them. I love the TV's design and appearance very sleek and modern. It's also very light, about 70 lbs without the stand.This thing is also future proof, it supports deep color, and 24p.Most importantly the price is right on amazon!! No sales tax alone saved us over $200. We saved at least another $400 from other places we have looked. Even if we had bought this set at a higher price I wouldn't be disappointed. This is simply one of the best Tv's money can buy right now.The only downside to getting such a good price is that you don't receive the \"white glove\" delivery. A very minor drawback.

But after spending some time watching it, she did comment that she can see the details in movies clearly even without glasses. I guess that's the whole point of getting this TV. Like others have commented, the image quality is superb. However, I noticed that the screen isn't 100% evenly black when nothing is displayed on the screen. Then again, I'm not planning to sit in front of the TV to watch a blank screen. The built in speaker was average at best. Fine for watching news & TV shows, but a surround sound setup is a must to get the full movie experience. Since I already have the PS3, operating the similar menu layout was a breeze. The only other model I seriously considered was the Samsung 52\" ToC 860. That's a fine unit too, but I've always had good experience with Sony TVs, so I went with what's familiar. The new Sony XBR7 series with the 240Hz feature wasn't significant enough to justify spending an extrat $2K. Of course, the new XBR8 55\" model is out of my price range.

Furthermore, I just realized the LCD panel is actually made by Samsung NOT Sony. If you buy a Sony TV; why is the LCD Panel (the most important and expensive part of the TV) is made in Korea by Samsung.  The picture might be good but how long will it last.....for me it only lasted 1 year and 4 months.  Also If you do a simple search on Amazon you will find that Amazon does not sell Sony XBR LCD TV directly anymore since I guess they have so many complaints from their customers on the Sony LCD TV. Go ahead look and see you can find Amazon selling Sony XBR LCD TV directly...Amazon actually refer you to another brand like LG or other brands when you are looking any Sony XBR LCD TVs.....and my Full Story below:5/9/2010- I brought the Sony XBR series TV on Amazon about 1 year and 4 months ago and now the TV have failed. The picture quality was amazing until just yesterday the picture started to degrade and now it has green clouds and rainbows all over the pictures. I just call the Sony authorize tech service from they said it will cost me $75 for the in house service since it's out of warranty. They also said that if it's the LCD panels has failed then it would cost as much as the TV itself. This is my first LCD from Sony but I have 3 other Sony TVs- 1 30\" Sony CRT, 1 47\" XBR rear projection and 1 65\" XBR rear projection TV. All the previous Sony TVs had no problem at all and I am still using the 65\" rear projection TV. What happen to Sony's quality and reliability product? I guess it went to the same place as other first rated Japanese products like Toyota. They are just too busy on cutting cost and lower their reliabilities so they can rack in the billion dollars profit. So if you like the picture quality of Sony TVs; be advice to buy their extended warranty.  I wish I did because if the LCD panel failed then my LCD TV is just a big 52\" black picture frame hanging on the wall.  If you really, really have to get a Sony XBR LCD TV then I would recommend to get 5 years extended warranty plan for $299-it will save you a lot of frustration. And after 5 years, you will probably do a upgrade anyway.5/11/2010 update: Today the tech came and verified that the LCD panel has gone bad after 1 year and 4 months of service. In the tech's own words-the panel is a factory defect since it should not failed after just a little over a year of service and that I should call Sony and see they will reimburse the cost of the panel. I am so disappointed on the product since I did not just buy any Sony TV but the top of the line XBR series TV. I called Sony and told them the whole story but they just told me to fax all the documents -receipt and repair cost to Sony and they will evaluate it. I will wait and see what happen - but at this point I am really disappointed and frustrated with the whole thing! :-(Update: 5/13/2010-Just received a call from Sony \"Customer Relations\" today.  It's official-Sony don't stand behind their products.  They will not pay for the cost of their defective LCD panel since it's out of warranty (1 year) after 1 year and 4 month of service. They just lost a loyal customer. No more Sony products in my house.  Sony customer relations representative even has the nerve to offer me $900 reimbursement on a $$3517.75 repair cost. That's right-I will have to pay $2617.76 to fix my $2018.88 LCD TV.  So if you buy a Sony TV and you have a defective LCD panel after 1 year of use then you can just throw that TV in the trash because Sony will tell you go F yourself and trash the TV.  Good luck on buying a Sony LCD TV because you going to need it-and looks like from my research, I am not the only customer that have a defect LCD panel after 1 year.  In fact, the LCD panel is not even made by Sony but Samsung made in Korea.  Samsung LCD Panels have notoriously for premature failure of their LCD panels.  So no more Sony LCD for me or should I say Samsung LCD TV ....", "Date": "May 28, 2010"}, {"Title": "Disappointed in the Sony KDL-52XBR6", "Author": "Cortezer", "ReviewID": "RMFGE1TMXS3W3", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "As of the date of this post, the XBR6 has been replaced with the XBR9.  We didn't purchase this 52XBR6 from Amazon, but it wouldn't have mattered.  We had about one year and five months of good service from this TV.  Then, the dreaded RED line started to appear. 3 1/2\" from the right (above the green power light)there is now a very bright red line running vertical from the bottom all the way to the top of the screen.  Two years and five months now since purchase, we have been living with this line for about a year.  Contacting Sony last year when the line was first noticed met with the same result as the last call I just placed two days ago to explain that the line has gotten brighter and more vivid than ever before.Sony says I should contact an authorized repair facility and Sony will offer some 'consideration' concerning the repair of this very expensive TV.  Sony requires a 'diagnostic evaluation report' which is required at our expense.  Fair enough, it is over the 1 year warranty after all. I spoke to two such authorized repair places.  The first, told me to send in a picture to verify that the panel was indeed defective.  My description over the phone was enough to come to the defective panel conclusion.  For a modest $50  I would get a faxed or emailed report to say that the repair would most certainly exceed the cost of a new 52XBR9 TV.  This person (Mike) was very helpful and was more than willing to say that this 'red line' problem is prevalent in the Sony TV's in this XBR series.The second place I called said it was $100 to send someone out to verify what they concluded over the phone to be a defective LCD panel.  No mention what the repair cost might be, the repairman would have to see it first.Did I spend the money you ask, to have it verified?  NO.  I looked all over the Internet to see that this is a very common problem with the Sony LCD TV's.  The red line problem is not always located in the same spot on the screen, but the problem and diagnosis are the same.  Defective LCD panel.Almost all of our components are Sony.  TV's (over the years) DVD and Blu-ray players, CD players, amplifiers, even speakers.  We will probably not buy any more Sony products, especially $3000 LCD TV's that start going bad after a year plus.FYI - We hadn't considered an extended warranty on this TV at the time of purchase.  Even the sales people said that the Sony made LCD panel was as good or better than LG or Mitsubishi.  Now, I have read where the panel in the XBR6 is a Samsung, not even a Sony.  Shame on you Sony!My recommendation:  Steer clear of a Sony but if you have to have one, shell out the extra $300 - $500 to get a 5 year warranty.  You ARE going to need it, guaranteed.Update (same day as original post):  I added 2 pictures to show what the red line looks like and where it is located on the screen.  Please click on 'View and share related images' to see what the red line looks like against a grey screen (unused input setting) Note: I suspect that some negative reviews are generated by competitors of a given product.

The picture is excellent and the color is great.A few months ago my wife started asking about the vertical line down the right side of the screen. I had trouble seeing it against a darker background but it was definitely there. It's in about 3 inches from the right side running from top to bottom and it about 1/2 inch wide.I thought that it was the source that was no good, and it would come and go. Recently, it has been happening more frequently and the line has gotten a little wider (it's actually multiple, close lines). It shows up with the blu-ray, it showed up with my Comcast HD DVR, and it now shows up with my DirecTV HD DVR (HR-21). But it comes and goes without touching anything.I contacted Sony online, who suggested that I change the socket that it is plugged into. I have it on an expensive surge/power control unit. The unit shows voltage and status and everything there is fine. This is not a problem with the socket, it's a problem with the panel. I asked about warranty and unfortunately it's one year, that's it.I looked on the web and found that someone else had the same problem with their same unit, but their line is 3/4 inch in from the right whereas mine is about 3 inches.I thought that Sony was known for quality, so this is a big surprise.

I was looking at a Sony laptop, since I want all of this equipment to work together, but this has changed my mind.If I were doing this again, I would look at Panasonic or Samsung.I gave the low rating on picture quality because when the line appears, it really annoys me.

A lot of people falsely assume it's the 120hz that makes the pq look soap opera-ish but it's actually the motion enhancer which can be turned off. The 120hz is always on and has no negative effect on the pq at all. The colors are excellent and the picture is smooth. Watching Blu-Ray films on this tv is a sight to behold, it will make you a believer in movies again. I game on this bad boy and it handles everything with ease. My PS3 and 360 look outstanding and I never have to use the game mode except for when I play Rockband, FPS with no lag. The 4 HDMI ports and 2 Component makes this one tv that can handle all of your devices. The sound is phenomenal as well it plenty loud and does the trick for those late nights when you don't want your surround sound going. The menu system (just like the PS3 and PSP) is very easy to navigate. There is a lot to love with this tv but there are a few negatives. It like all LCD tv's may suffer from clouding and uneven back-lighting; if it does it should only appear in a very dark image and shouldn't be noticeable.

I'm not repeating what others have accurately depicted and I'm sure you have done your physical in store comparisions before or after reading this.This set has an incredible picture as did some other comparable Samsung units I considered, however the sound on this unit tipped the scale in my favor as I don't plan on feeding it through a sound system all the time. My brother had performed his own independent research and ended up with the 46\" version of this set right before the holidays.  Actually I'd prefer the touch of color (TOC) Bezel with the Sony sound system although I'm completely satisfied with this unit and the integration of the speaker across the bottom.I haven't integrate the ethernet port into my home network yet, but did pop a USB stick into it.  Viewing high resolution photographs from a professional camera setup is something that puts 10 inch digital picture frames to shame. Navigating through folders in an explorer style point and click with thumbnail images is fast and easy.I wasn't in a rush to order this and my patience paid off as Amazon ran a Blue Ray combo special after Christmas that saved me an additional four c-notes and this made Amazon the cheapest Web deal by leaps and bounds for me.Unless you own them, don't forget the HDMI cables.  Good cables (V1.3) that also support 1080p data rate start at ten bucks on the same site, so don't get swayed into the big fat expensive ones that only local brick and mortar stores seem to sell.Lucky for me, the TV, Sony Blue Ray (550) and the cables all arrived the same day despite three different shipping methods for each.  This was truly my \"Three Kings day\".One further tip, even though I have two High definition Cable DVR Receivers, I wasn't aware they also have a built in picture zoom feature besides the zoom built into these TVs.  After a short panic attack almost suspecting a defunct TV and after a few hours of swapping TVs, and cable boxes, did I realize the source of the problem was a ill set cable box. Definitely freshen up on the capabilities of your set top box before slapping these puppies together, especially if times of trouble.I read the other reviews about shipping and must say I had a positive experience. The web site accurately states tracking info, and I received a phone call the day of delivery informing me they would be a couple hours earlier than expected.  Two men carried the units, were professional and courteous. They unboxed it at my request and waited for me to inspect it for damage. I saw them momentarily put the box down in some snow (OMG) while closing up the truck, so a wet and possibly dirty bottom can be expected. Be prepared with some floor/carpet protection if its coming into your O.R.I've never heard anyone say that set is too big except my wife.

Of course, I'm no techie or TV-phile, but to my standards, the picture quality and sound is premium.

The Sony, though, had deeper blacks and seemed to have a brighter picture, so I ended up choosing the Sony in the end.Bottom line, I'm sure the Samsung would have made a great TV in the end, but I'm very satisfied with the Sony XBR.

The color saturation is beautiful, and black reproduction has to be the best I've seen thus far for an LCD television.I have my PS3 and Xbox 360 hooked up to it, and absolutely love the 120hz refresh rate while playing games.  Both systems look great on this set, and I also have all hookups ran via HDMI.  As far as the sound is concerned, I can't really comment on the built in speakers since I have a full set-up, but don't expect anything theater-quality out of this thing - or any other LCD for that matter.  I always laugh when I hear people complain about the sound out of an LCD or Plasma TV - what they heck do they expect out of something that is 1 - 3 inches thin?Overall, I am extremely satisfied with my purchase, and would do it again in a heartbeat.

Pretty early on I decided on a Sony Bravia because our living room has a lot of natural light and the \"piano\" finish of the Bravias is a must for avoiding glare. I also decided on LCD because my kids have a tendency to leave the TV on with a movie paused and I didn't want to worry about the burn-in of a plasma TV. I looked at many, many TVs at various stores and liked the piano finish better anyway, and the Bravias have an expensive appearance that some of the others don't. Once I decided on a 52\" size, the last thing to decide was whether to buy the V model at 60 hz. or the W or XBR at 120 hz. The more I researched this, the more confused I got. I saw a few comments about artifacts and blur with 60 hz. (not specifically at Sony, but 60 hz. TV's in general) and that concerned me, yet when I looked at the V models in showrooms I could not see any problems, and I am very picky and sensitive about such things. My conclusion is that this is not an issue of 60 versus 120 so much as an issue of how individual LCD TV's process signals, and the Bravia does an excellent job on this front. Also I'm a gamer and I wanted the perfect TV for displaying the PS3 in HD with no blurring. I finally made my decision after talking to an XBR owner that commented that he disliked the \"soap opera\" look of the 120 hz. so much that he keeps the \"Motion Flow\" turned off permanently. I had no desire to see movies in a way they weren't intended (Motion Flow even removes the intentional swipes and blurs from movies), so decided the extra cost of 120 hz. was not worth it. I have had my V model for 3 weeks now and can say most assuredly that it is perfect, I am quite content that the extra money on 120 hz. would have been wasted! The picture is truly a thing of wonder, it's incredibly crisp and clear. I've watched movies (mostly Blu Ray but DVDs as well) of all types including fast action and there is no blurring on this TV that wasn't also on the big screen when I saw the same movies at the theater, IE movies are displaying exactly as they should. In fact, my older daughter and I both felt that the movies actually look more detailed on the Bravia then they did on the big screen. I'm not big into sports, but I've watched some basketball games on cable (HD broadcasts) and again have noticed no blurring or artifacts. Everything I've watched in HD looks great, SD isn't so hot but that's not what I got this TV for.A comment about cables- HDMI cables are a must, do not use component cables or the picture quality will suffer. I hooked up my PS3 with component cables initially (because it's what I had from the old TV), but while Blu Ray looked very good DVDs looked lousy (I found out that the PS3 will not upscale DVDs to 1080 unless you're using an HDMI cable). Once I swapped the cable to HDMI, not only did the DVDs look much better but Blu Ray movies were elevated to unbelievable quality! And the PS games looked much better too, Metal Gear Solid 4 and Ratchet & Clank Future are stunning! Likewise the cable box was hooked up with a component cable, when I switched it to HDMI the HD channels were significantly better.I've seen some complaints about the Bravia menu interface, but it is just like the PS3. I found it intuitive and easy to navigate without the need to reference the instructions.The built-in speakers are adequate, but as most other people have commented you really will want a surround-sound system to supplement the Bravia experience.If you're only going to buy one Blu Ray movie, make it Kung Fu Panda. Whenever anyone comes by your house, pop that in to blow them away on just how good your new Bravia is. The textures and detail are positively jaw-dropping. The first time we watched the movie we barely noticed the story because we were so busy commenting on the incredibly rich background details! Actually all the Blu Ray movies I've watched on it look great, but that movie has a sensitive touch in the details in it that many others don't.So if you're like me and are confused about 120 hz. versus 60 hz. in making your decision, have no fear.

Cardwell", "ReviewID": "R1XYJWNAUQVJSA", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "After much, much research opted for this set over the similar Samsung mainly due to reviews of the Samsung which mentioned \"poor customer service.\" Paying this much I wanted the best TV & Customer Service should I need it.  Being a Sony, expensive at that, I didn't think I would ever need it anyway.Purchase, delivery throught Amazon was awesome as always. Bought Sony components including amplifier and blue ray, and Peerless (wonderful) mounts for all.Mounted and installed easily.  Beautiful!  Absolutely awesome picture. In blue ray it was literally better than actually \"being there.\"  I thought 16:9 and 4:3 controls were odd, but I was fine with that. I was amazed and very happy with entire purchase.......for about 90 days!Suddenly and without warning, the bottom third of the screen goes fuzzy.  Really, I can describe it as the bottom third refreshing at such a slow rate the previous frames are visible for a good 5-10 seconds.  Now this is only the bottom third of the screen mind you, the remainder is fine. It does this regardless of the source.I contact Sony's Customer Service through website and easily order service. I precisely describe problem. Sony automated site says it's under warranty and they'll dispacth a repairman. The first technician available is a week out.(You can pick the date-neat enough) Instructions are you must remove from wall and leave where tech can get to rear of tv. Technician arrives, looks at picture for 5 seconds and says \"you were absolutley right in your decription. You need an entire new screen!\"  He says that will take 3 weeks to arrive.It's been over two now and I haven't yet heard from them about scheduling a date. That's were we are.  Meanwhile TV still sucks and the wall is a mess.Amazon got me the TV is less than a week. I'm going to literally video the \"rescreening\" process and make sure the TV is in like-new condition.  Sony should have replaced the TV immediately. How much does two techs trips and a new screen cost.  I'm sad. Hope you have better luck. I'm very disappointed in Sony.", "Date": "June 3, 2009"}, {"Title": "bob's your uncle", "Author": "TONY AQUILANO", "ReviewID": "R37OT6I5KHP48A", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "if you demand the best for your dollar.,.,boom.,.,this TV is for you.,.,after i got this thing out of the box it was 38 minutes till i was up and running.,.,boom.,.,the sony user interface is the best on the planet.,.,with in minutes the remote felt like it has been in my hand for a life time.,.,and trust me i am a hand made man.,.perfect.,., perfect.,.,i love this thing.,.,now leave me alone there is a great rerun of NEWS RADIO on.,.,boom bob's your uncle.,.,", "Date": "February 24, 2009"}, {"Title": "Sony 52\" XBR6 LCD TV", "Author": "Snowman", "ReviewID": "R24X0WDISUG8SS", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Sony Bravia XBR KDL-52XBR6 52-Inch 1080p 120 Hz LCD HDTVGreat \"FREE\" 'White Glove' delivery service.

I have had several Sony's of varying sizes. While there me be others out there with as good a picture, there are none as reliable over the years in my experience. The price of these LCD screens is dropping rapidly making them more and more affordable in the larger formats. I highly recommend this set. Though a little more expensive than some of the others, Sharp, Panasonic, RCA, Magnavox, etc., it's what's inside that counts. Spend a little more if your shopping.

If you want the best go with the sony XBR.  If you want to think you got the best, get a Samsung.  In my opinion Sony has made the best TVs for years and will continue to do so.  There's a reason why they are more than the competition.I'm not sure why Amazon allows some of the reviews here.  I don't think you should be allowed to post the price from another website in a review as someone else did.  I got a better price from Amazon then the amount posted by the reviewer anyway.  The white glove service was as described; I have no complaints.Also, I'm tired of seeing reviews of 1 star because the product took a while to arrive, or the product was damaged and you never got to use it.  How can you rate a product if you never actually used it?  Should you give a poor review because some shady seller took a while to send it to you?  My point here is don't give a product a bad review just because there was an issue with delivery, the product conditon upon arrival etc.  Rate the product for what it is.", "Date": "December 12, 2008"}, {"Title": "High end Sony", "Author": "K.

La tecnologia empleada en esta TV es de las inimaginables. Una unidad que lo tiene practicamente todo, desde los puertos necesarios para conectarse con cuanto equipo electronico existe hasta la capacidad de dejarte sin aliento especialmente en las peliculas de accion, excelente imagen y sonido.Una cosa mas, esta TV es tan buena como la imagen que recibe. HDTV (High definition) deberia ser la meta. HDTV se puede conseguir de las siguientes maneras:1.- En USA, con una antena amplificada la cual jala la senal del aire, de donde se puede captar descenas de canales HD.2.- Servicio de cable HD, por lo general las companias de cable te rentan la caja por aprox diez dolares extra al mes.3.- Servicio de Satelite, lo mismo que con el cable hay que pedir el servicio.4.- Blu Ray, WOOOOOW!!!!5.- PS3Definitivamente recomiendo esta TV.
