{"Reviews": [{"Title": "An amazing TV, but expensive", "Author": "Mark D", "ReviewID": "R1O5SNO7KMERF6", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I have had the Elite for about three weeks.  I couldn't be happier with it, aside from the price.  The picture is extraordinary, the blacks rich, the colors vibrant, and I haven't had it calibrated yet.  One thing I wasn't expecting, but was thrilled to find out, is the quality of sound that comes from this TV.  On my Sony (KDL55XBR8) the sound was pretty good, but there were times when I felt the need to turn on the audio receiver.  As a result I bought a $300 soundbar.  But now, with the Elite, I don't need it.  The quality of sound coming from the Elite TV's own speakers is superior to the sound coming from my soundbar.  The dilema is, now what do I do with the soundbar?If I had to pick one thing that stands out on the Elite, I would say the black levels.  They are absolutely astounding, to the point that I was distracted by the depth when I first starting using the TV.  I have read that the black levels are better than for the previously made Kuro.  I have never seen the Kuro's picture, but I would have a hard time imagining blacks any deeper than these.Though I always sit directly in front of my TV I was actually surpised when I had to get something on the other side of the room and the picture did not significantly degrade as I got farther off angle.  This is a huge improvement over my Sony KDL55XBR8.I talked to a Sony rep at Best Buy a few months ago when I was getting \"the itch\" to buy a new TV.  I was frustrated to find out that (according to the Sony rep) the HX929 was not a step up in quality from the XBR8.  I said, \"It's been almost three years.  You mean to tell me that in three years Sony has not come out with a better TV?\"  He advised me to stick to my XBR8.  I was astounded.  Then I heard about the Elite at Best Buy a couple weeks before they came out.  I talked to two of the sales people and they were both excited about the new Elite's coming out.  When they came in a couple weeks later I knew I had to have one.  So if you have a KDL55XBR8 and you want a TV that is better, with better picture, sound, black levels, and motion enhancement (and you have the money), this is your TV. You won't regret anything about the purchase...other than the price.", "Date": "October 9, 2011"}, {"Title": "It's REALLY a Pioneer...", "Author": "Maek", "ReviewID": "R37OATABXVDIKN", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I was originally thinking about getting the Kuro when Pioneer was still around but wasn't in the market for one yet and was saddened to hear that they were discontinuing the line prior to my ability to afford it.However, on one fateful day prior to the Super Bowl, I saw the unmistakable gold lettering of an ELITE model in Best Buy's Magnolia section.  I was surprised to see it and asked about it...and that's when I learned that it actually was a Sharp.  However, never fear...perhaps you may be put off by the fact that it's technically owned by Sharp now, but the Pioneer techs who originally made the best flat screens in the world have returned the Elite model to the showroom floor.And oh, what a TV it is.  I was worried primarily for 2 reasons:  a)  it's an LED (and was therefore worried about luminosity compared to some of the best plasmas) and b) this was the first time that Elite ventured into 3D territory.  However, I put it through the ropes and here's what I have to gush about:1.  Luminosity.  Seriously, this TV will put any plasma to shame...it makes our 8-series 58\" Samsung seem somewhat dim in comparison.  Whites are eye-piercingly brilliant.  Local dimming of the picture is divided into 216 individual areas providing the cleanest looking, properly illuminated images that cheaper LED offerings may otherwise fail to deliver.2.  Colors.  I read the CNET.com review which contradicted itself by saying that the colors were excellent as a \"pro\" and that blue/green was not quite as accurate as a \"con\" (make up your mind, CNET).  I, however, found that the colors are perfectly reproduced and a side-by-side with the Samsung revealed no apparent disparities.  Both sets were producing the same shades when running the Aquarium 2.0 dynamic screen background on my PS3.  Colors are vibrant and well-produced.  Sharp's inclusion of a 4th pixel color on their other AQUOS actually makes it to the Elite and does a fine job.3.  Blacks.  Or, should I say, BLACKS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  By far, the deepest blacks that I've ever seen on ANY TV.  Even our Samsung plasma seemed to be a \"dark grey\" next to it.4.  Reflectivity.  CNET.COM complains that the TV exhibits \"bright reflections.\"  Wrong...the TV does quite well with its quite-obvious anti-reflective single pane glass construction, similar to the Kuro in appearance and performance.5.  3D.  This was the feature that I was worried most about.  We put it through the ropes at Best Buy by utilizing Legends of the Guardians and Tron Legacy, both films that utilize a lot of dark scenes.  What was I looking for?  Luminosity and ability to depict a 3D picture in dark scenes that stores typically try to avoid through the use of much brighter movies (like Cloudy with A Chance Of Meatballs).  The TV surpassed expectations.  Reflections on digital warriors' helmets were extremely well-contrasted with very deep blacks inside an extremely well-developed 3D picture.  Luminosity takes a hit through the use of 3D glasses, of course, but Elite TV makers thought of that as well through the use of an independently-created setting for 3D image brightness which compensates for this and produces an impressive image that doesn't get significantly impacted by the glasses as a result.  Legends of the Guardians was equally impressive, with cracks and crenellations in an owl's claw being eye-candy to watch in 3D.  My favorite aspect of the 3D glasses is an individual setting which allows users who don't care for the 3D picture to switch it to 2D on the glasses; the glasses will automatically flatten the image so viewers can choose to watch the movie in whatever manner they wish.  BIG PLUS.The TV comes with 2 pairs of glasses and each extra pair will cost $99 which is about the going rate.  Glasses utilize a built-in, rechargeable Lithium-Ion battery which charge via standard USB cables.  Battery life is an impressive 100 hours...I've put mine through about 40 hours so far and haven't had to recharge them yet.  Glasses are reasonably comfortable, although don't expect much from them.  Also, you can either buy the Elite glasses or the Sharp 3D glasses; the ONLY difference between them is that the Elite glasses don't sport the Sharp moniker on the side.  Sharp wisely kept their name off the front of the TV and justifiably so...it may say Sharp on the back, but this TV is Pioneer through and through.Is the TV itself still as expensive as the Pioneer Elites used to be?  YOU BET.  I'm not going to lie; this TV is going to put a hole in your wallet - prices range anywhere from $4,500 to the full MSRP of $5,499.  I would venture to say that at any price tag below $4,000 that it would be an absolute MUST GET.  Above that, it's completely dependent upon whether or not you're passionate about a perfectly pristine picture or not.  Don't get me wrong, Panasonic and Samsung put out extremely good TVs and that may be just to your liking, but they will never hold up a candle to this screen.  Elite may be a presumptuous name, but it lives up to it.It's great to see the Elite TV back and in 3D, no less, with a picture that squashes plasmas and is the best that I've ever seen.  My wife and I have no buyer's remorse.", "Date": "March 2, 2012"}, {"Title": "Finest TV on the Market - Hands Down!", "Author": "J. Kent Layton", "ReviewID": "R2ZBP2K4JMO1SX", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "We went through a startling odyssey in trying to get a new television that we liked after our 2-year-old 52\" Sharp LED died. Not counting the fried 52\", we went through four, yes count them four, TV's - a Sharp 60\" LC60LE631U, two Sharp 60\" LC60LE635U's, and a 60\" Samsung PN59D8000, all LED's and all plagued with problems right out of the box ... dim areas on light screens, flashlight \"bleed-through\" on dark scenes, horrendous pixelation. You name it, we went through it.We were unwilling to go with a Plasma TV because - although plasmas are highly rated in picture quality - they suffer their own series of potential problems, such as screen burn-in, occasional dead pixels, and that they tend to run hotter than LED's, etc., etc. Also, frankly, we simply didn't like the display of even the top-notch plasmas as opposed to the LED's. One came close - the Panasonic TC-P65VT30, but it was out of stock at all retailers within 100 miles, and it was about five inches too big for our entertainment center. On the other hand, we very much liked the fourth pixel (yellow) which Sharp added to their LED TV's. Even so, after going through four of their sets (including the 52\" that died) with all sorts of issues, we were not willing to try a fourth. The Samsung UN59D8000, however, looked like rubbish by comparison. All of those TV's went straight back to the retailer.This whole mess took days to sort out, and numerous phone calls to Sharp Customer Service. Sharp had us send photographs of the issues, and they all agreed that the sets had problems. They apologized profusely for our trouble. However, when push came to shove, they were wholly unhelpful and told us to make another expedition to a retailer - both to return the bad set, and to pick out a new one. They did nothing more than apologize. Hesitantly, we decided to give Sharp technology one *last* shot, and tried what is currently the best-rated TV in the latest Value Electronics HDTV Shootout. (For the first time, an LED beat out a plasma in a direct competition. And the winner was: the 60\" Elite - which is built by a joint effort of Sharp Electronics and Pioneer.) This TV blows everything else *out of the water* - and believe me, we've stared at many, many a TV screen and many reviews, and many specs sheets, all during the past month.The 350-odd local dimming zones of the Elite are an incredible feature which deepens black levels to true black, while pushing more light through super bright areas nearby. This feature works incredibly well, except under one very specific circumstance: when viewing a scene where the room is very dark, and someone's face is brightly illuminated, and they're moving around a lot very quickly. In this situation, you get a small light-shaded halo directly around the face. It's easily remedied by turning the local dimming off in the settings. But under every other type of viewing, the local dimming is spot-on fantastic.The addition of the yellow sub-pixel is an incredible concept brought in from the Sharp end of things (some people don't like it, but once you see yellows on Sharp screens, I couldn't go back to the dull yellows on other sets). Although their customer service was terrible, Sharp's fourth-pixel concept blows all other LED TV's out of the water. The 120hz and \"FluidMotion\" 240hz settings really look marvelous; on previous TV's, I defeated the higher hz. rates because I thought they looked terrible. Now I'm enjoying them ... tremendously. The processing power of this TV is amazing.One of the most incredible displays of this TV's quality is what it does to the light-colored eyes of actors and actresses. Whereas the Samsung P59D8000 made Daniel Craig or Olivia Wilde's eyes look very dark in \"Cowboys & Aliens,\" (we were laughing, saying the TV made everyone look like moles) pop the same movie into the same system, but substitute the Elite TV, and suddenly their eyes look incredible - nearly electric. Every pore of every face is shown in all its, er, glory - you can also see just how much stubble is on the chin. This TV is a makeup artist's worst nightmare come true.Also important is the back-lighting on this TV as opposed to edge-lighting technology of the 835 or 831 Sharps, or \"that Samsung\" we had for 24 hours. Edge-lighting can leave shadowing effects that are distracting when viewing fast-moving content; the back-lighting on this set leaves no shadowing.3-D viewing is a very interesting experience; two pairs of glasses are included. I would say that, for the sticker price of the TV, four or six should be included. However, we got the TV at an incredible sale price, not much over the sticker price of the 835U, so I'm not personally going to grouse; the 835 Sharps don't come with any - even though they should, too. I was never convinced of the \"coolness\" of 3-D televisions, even poking occasional fun at the 'weirdos sitting around with the stupid glasses in their living rooms.' So I did not get this TV for the 3-D experience. However, I've picked up a couple of 3-D Blu-rays, and a nice Pioneer 3-D player, and I was actually enjoying the experience for a few minutes before the novelty wore off, I got a slight headache, and I switched back to 2-D. Still not a 3-D fan, I guess. Maybe I just don't \"get\" it. [Shoulders shrugging.]There are many settings which can be adjusted to suit your personal viewing desires. Blu-rays like \"Cowboys & Aliens\" or \"Avatar\" look insane - visual drugs, I call it. I'm done with smelly, stinky movie theaters - where people make noise, goof around, and leave gum on the floors, all at $10-12 a ticket. Literally, buy some microwave popcorn because you'll never need to sit in a theater again. Ever. Got a load of DVD's? Don't worry, they upscale really well on this TV. You can see some minor compression noise, but it's still a beautiful sight. Cable or satellite feed at 720p? It will look amazing, too.This television is very heavy for an LED set. That's fine by me, I'm from the old school and tend to equate \"heavy\" with \"quality\". However, it must be handled carefully both in shipping and setup. If you have a wooden stand as opposed to a wall-mount, make sure it will take the weight. My 1-year-old top-of-the-line entertainment center began to sag under the weight and immediately needed to be propped up underneath.All in all, this is one incredible television. Don't bother with the edge-lit LED's; if the price of this set is a big concern, do careful homework and shop the sales. Be a careful consumer. Think carefully about the extended warranties, particularly since the price of these sets will likely go down in the future.

I was wondering if the Elite Pro-60X5FD TV is worth a higher price compared to other high-end TVs.  I did an intensive research and narrowed down 4 models: Panasonic 65VT50 (plasma), Samsung 65ES8000 (LED), Sony 65XBRHX950 (LED) and Elite Pro 60X5FD (LED).  First, I purchased a Samsung 65ES8000 TV and I returned the TV because of a banding problem (strips of light and dark backlighting) and other issues, such as difficulties to operate the voice and hand motion commands and the unnatural pictures.  Then I purchased Elite 60X5FD and I am very excited about this TV in terms of its overall quality (high quality picture, simple and elegant appearance, quality exterior materials, and easy to operate.)  I give a 5-star rating because: 1) Elite TV is the brightest one in the market (it is an excellent TV for a room with lots of windows), 2) the deepest black TV in the market (it generates very high quality pictures), and 3) The Elite's Authorized Service is very helpful (using 800 number) whenever you encounter any issues.  For example, I broke a bundling wire string and they send me a new one via FedEx within 3 days, free-of-charge, even it is my fault for the damage.  My Elite TV does not have dead pixels and does not have the \"banding\" problem in the first try. That represents good quality control. One thing Elite can improve is that the two medal posts attached to TV base should be installed in the factory so that the delivery person can insert TV directly into the base for a speeding setup. There is no perfect TV in the current market. I strongly believe that the Elite Pro-60X5FD TV is not pricy and the product is very well justifiable for the money you spent.", "Date": "January 21, 2013"}, {"Title": "The Best Image Quality Around, But Imperfect", "Author": "P.

It really is outstanding.Both 2D and 3D picture quality rival or surpass any TV ever made!That said, you sort of expect perfection from a TV set so expensive, and this set falls a tad short. The biggest issue is that backgrounds can flicker under the wrong settings and circumstances (as if a flickering candle lit one area of the screen) and you can notice slight banding every once in awhile.The good news is that tweaking settings can alleviate the flickering problem to the point where it's no longer distracting, but you should set your expectations that this is the best set around, but is nevertheless imperfect.", "Date": "January 28, 2012"}, {"Title": "Great TV, but....", "Author": "PB", "ReviewID": "RKE9JVPCZSYAF", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "First off, I'll say we love the picture quality of this TV. It's beautiful. When we purchased it we had already researched and viewed many, many different TVs from different manufacturers, from lower priced to higher priced. Then we saw this TV and it was all over.There are great points, and bad points, and very bad points, to this TV. Hence the 4-star rating. I almost gave it a 3-star but we really like the picture quality so I didn't.Very good/Top notch:1. Picture quality. I'm not that tech savvy so I'm not going to attempt to explain this in detail. It will be written for the layman. I just know what type of picture I like and this is it. Some 2D movies nearly appear 3D on this TV. Colors are bright and blacks are very black. It's crisp, clear, beautiful color and I love it. Motion doesn't jump as it does on other TVs and you can sit in any chair in the room and still have a great picture. That was important to, for when we have guests over. The picture is the main reason we spent this type of money on this TV. It was/is our most important feature. We don't care about sound, obviously, as we use a home theater system. It was/is the amazing high definition picture quality.2. Bonus--This uses almost non-existent energy for a TV of this magnitude: $20/year energy cost with 179 kwh per year use. This is incredible--lower than any comparison model on the energy guide. And you STILL get the best picture I've ever seen.Bad:1. No cable card outlet. (???!!!) You HAVE to pay for a set top box for this TV due to it not having a cable card slot. I feel that was a huge oversight on the part of Sharp.2. No Amazon Prime button. They weren't looking at all the new things when they designed this. They have Netflix but not Amz Prime. Definitely a negative for them.Very Bad:1. Ghosting. Our first TV had this weird ghosting effect in many movies and a few TV shows, happening within the 1st 20 days. Sharp replaced the TV immediately, which we appreciated. At this price, this shouldn't happen. What I mean by ghosting is the back screen turns so white that it nearly looks like an x-ray in the foreground (people, etc.). It lasts for a second or two. It's been nearly a year now since they switched out our first TV and it's now starting with the newer one.2. Even worse: The TV has lost the ability to communicate with the remote. We were stunned that this happened, and we ended up needing to go to the TV itself to turn it on and off. Now we're very active people and like moving around but not with the TV, and definitely not at this price--this should never happen. It's never happened on another TV I've owned. It can screw up the universal remote turning on everything else correctly as well, we've found. A tech come out and told us that this has turned out to be somewhat common on the Elite TVs. He didn't know why and there haven't been that many sold so that's not a good sign. Very thankfully we purchased the extended warranty that is taking care of the problem.I would suggest to anyone considering this TV that you purchase the extended warranty if you buy it. Our problems were obviously not just a quirk of 1 TV. Both TVs have had the ghosting problem within the 1st year and the latest one has the remote problem within its first year. Another reviewer commented on the infrared remote problem with his 70\" w/in the 1st 3 mos. Particularly with the tech telling us he has seen this on other Sharps and that it's more common than not, you're shooting yourself in the foot if you purchase the TV without a warranty that will cover things that go wrong in the 1st 2 years at the minimum. We've had 2 major things happen within just the 1st year.
