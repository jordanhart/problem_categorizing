That ended after 5 weeks, we had turned the TV on, went into the kitchen to make lunch, came back to a black screen.  When we looked closely, we saw a spider like crack underneath the glass and the TV would not turn back on.  The TV had been sitting on its TV stand since amazon had delivered it without being touched or moved.  We are currently working with the Samsung warranty to get this problem fixed but I just heard back that they say it is \"physical damage\" and not covered under warranty.  After some research, I found a forum on c-net dedicated to this issue - hundreds of angry consumers with the same exact experience we had - all flat panel samsung tvs that mysteriously cracked under the glass without anyone touching the unit.  In most cases it took them weeks/months of complaining and filing to get resolution from Samsung - usually with first a rejection under warranty.  It is just not worth the trouble.  I am hoping Samsung comes through to fix the issue, but it is not looking good. At this point, I'd recommend avoiding Samsung all together (believe me, I did not think that a couple of months ago - I thought they were top of the line which is why we were willing to spend so much on the tv) - the complaints I found were on Samsung brand tv's specifically.  They obviously have a defect issue with the number of complaints I have seen.  This is my first ever negative review and I have avoided posting anything until I gave Samsung a chance to fix the issue and after hearing that we incurred the \"physical damage\" and that is not covered, I have to say something and post this review - it is just not right what they are doing.  I plan on filing with the BBB and joining all the consumers on the forum who have already filed with the NJ Attorney General's office.", "Date": "December 7, 2010"}, {"Title": "Samsung Plasma Beats LED/LCD", "Author": "Wildcat Guy", "ReviewID": "R2W0GW1UVPY9XD", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I had the c8000 55\" LED for over 3 weeks and loved the bright and clear picture, but it was hard to get the settings right for normal viewing, the viewing angle was atrocious vs. even LCD screens,  and parts of the screen in dark scenes still have some clouding.  I sent the LED back and purchased the c8000 58\" plasma.  I'm very happy with it so far, especially after tweaking the settings.  Now, I have all the pop of the LED but with consistent colors, better blacks and unlimited viewing angle.  The details. . . .ProsGreat uniform picture - great price  the $ vs. LED.  Easy to self-calibrate vs. the LED Samsung.Remote is very nice compared to the bluray remote (same as the c8000 LED remote), but I'm using a Harmony 900 for all my components so it isn't used.You can turn off the motion judder canceller and ditch the soap opera effect when watching movies.  Cinema Smooth makes high-end movies look great.Bright screen compared to plasmas I've had.Real 3D content (Monsters v. Aliens) looks great (even with a 1.3 highspeed HDMI cable -- however, 2D to 3D conversion of regular programs gives only nice depth - not pop out 3d.Very thin TV - fairly lightweight for a plasma - nice stand (stainless) and bezel (dark gray), but not as cool in my opinion as the LED version which has a stainless bezel.Netflix app works through both through the TV and the bluray and surprisingly has good pic quality - not bluray like, but close to DVD quality with no glitches (assuming you have a fast internet connection).Much less screen glare than the c8000 LED. This TV does not have a matte screen like many other LCD HDTVs, but Real Black Filter kills the glare much better than the c7000 plasma I saw at BB. Note that the c8000 LED has an incredibly shiny screen, making it difficult to watch in a bright room.Like all plasmas, the screen looks the same despite your seating position in the room.  The c8000 LED has a good picture when straight on - but move a few feel off center and the picture would fade substantially.  No such problems here.ConsTV isn't wifi - need a $80 adapter or have to hardwire it - TV firmware didn't update through the adapter - had to update on Samsung site with USB.Overall a top notch TV that is larger than the LED, has a better and more uniform picture, lower glare, better off angle viewing and is cheaper.  What is not to like?  Here are my settings after having the TV a month.  If you have a bright room or if you like the \"pop\" of the LED, these settings will blow you away.  If you have a dark basement or watch only at night, dial the CellLight back to 10 or so and maybe put the color on normal vs. cool and you'll be set:CAL-DAY Mode, Cell Light 20, Brightness 50, Color 50, tint 50/50, Sharpness 40, cool, native, MJC off, Filmmode 1, black (darker), dynamic contrast (med), gamma 2, other settings on auto.  Cinema Smooth to \"on\" but it only works on bluray 24p input.", "Date": "April 30, 2010"}, {"Title": "Picture Perfect in Ohio", "Author": "M. Van Allen", "ReviewID": "RP8EV6SGOUOPN", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "An amazing plasma TV! Wanted to upgrade from a bulky and heavy projection TV upstairs to new flat screen TV to make a media room in finished basement. Wanted latest 3D technology that wouldn't become obsolete so soon. Didn't go to local stores to view demonstration of TVs since don't know how well they are set up. Instead relied on Internet reviews posted on various models by owner of new TVs. Samsung PN58C8000 plasma recived lots of good reviews including comments on how picture didn't change with viewing angle or across screen, 600 Hz sub-field motion, deep blacks and only 1.5\" thick.  This was most expensive purchase we've made thru Internet & it turned out fine! Order was completed on a Tuesday morning, set was shipped Tuesday afternoon and arrived at our Ohio home that Friday morning in fine condition. Set was placed on VAS TV stand we got from local Walmart that allowed 70 degrees rotation left or right so it could be viewed at kitchen or media room. Stand that came with TV provided 20 degrees left or right rotation. Used HDMI 1.4 cables to connect Samsung 3D Blu-ray disc player BD-C6900 and cable box. Set had no noticeable buzzing with or without ferrite cores on power cord which smooth out power voltage spikes. Set was manufactured in June 2010 so buzzing reported by some earlier reviews must have since been fixed by Samsung. We have not yet used Internet to upgrade TV firmware.2D  After using and testing this plasma PN58C8000 TV for over two & a half weeks, it is capable of providinig an essentially perfect picture at any angle and across screen from edge to edge. It is amazing how picture has much better detail, bolder colors, brighter screen and very sharply outlined text than older 1080i projection TV.  Many adjustments can be made to picture in Mode, Advanced Settings and Options menus. Most can be left either at factory settings, Auto or changed once for viewer preference. Mode provides six pre-set picture type configurations of cell light, contrast, brightness, sharpness, color and tint(G/R) plus BD Wise configuration for Blu-ray discs playing on Samsung 3D Blu-ray player. These allow picture settings to be selected for one's preference, program source & time of day. Write down factory settings for each picture type before making any changes to them. TV remote is a nice contemporary design that allows quick access to picture Mode using Tools or Menu buttons.  Samsung 3D Blu-ray disc player has inter-connectivity features of BD Wise and Anynet+ of this TV that automatically sets optimum resolution and other linked operations thru HCMI 1.4 cable. It is one-half the size of older Blu-ray players, loads discs in one-third the time and has neat contemporary touch controls with blue see-thru disc window and logo. Has built-in wireless LAN which we haven't set up yet. Provides great picture for Blu-ray and DVD Movies & is frequently bundled with Samsung 3D TVs.  There are two test patterns for settings on shades or colors in Menu- Picture- Advanced Setting- Expert Patterns. But much more comprehensive HD set-up & tests are on Blu-ray disc, DVE HD Basics, available from Amazon.com. It explains how to set-up TV HD picture & Audio for optimum capabilities. HD video calibration patterns are provided for brightness, contrast, color, sharpness, resolution & geometry plus 1080p advanced video test patterns & demonstration videos. For Cal-Day picture mode, the TV was run thru video calibration & basic set-up patterns. This plasma TV passed every test pattern & could be set-up for exact reproduction of the incoming video.  Setting for Cal-Day mode provided by another reviewer of this TV at Amazon.com works good and only slight changes were made for viewer preference. My settings for perfect picture reproduction in semi-dark basement are: Cell Light 10, Contrast 90, Brightness 50, Sharpness 0, Color 50, Tint 50/50. Advanced Settings- Black Tone Dark, Dynamic Contrast Low, Gamma +1, others Off or Auto. Picture Options- Color Tone Normal, Film Mode Auto 1 or Cinema Smooth (only Blu-ray 24 Hz), rest normal, Auto or Off (Motion Judder Canceller Off). Cell Light can be increased to 15 or 20 if room is bright or just want very bright picture. Note that Sharpness adds artificial edge whitness not in original video & should be set to 0 for best picture fidelity. For personal preferences may want to increase Sharpness to 20- 30 or change other settings such as Black Tone, Dynamic Contrast, Gamma, Color Tone and MJC. Any of Picture Mode Setings can be changed for viewer preference.3D  Only true 3D content available at this time was 3D movies Monsters vs Aliens and Cloudy With Chance Of Meatballs released at end of June. Viewing Monsters vs Aliens was amazing with great picture depth & occasional pop-out-of-screen events. Much, much better than old eye fatiguing red/blue 3D glasses. Shutter battery operated glasses that came with Starter Kit are very light weight and comfortable. They can fit over regular glasses & operate way off-center & up to 20 ft from IR emitter on TV's lower left corner. One neighbor viewing 3D movie on this TV said it was better looking than 3D shown at movie theaters. Samsung 3D Blu-ray disc player interacts with 3D TV so the 3D movie is automatically set for 3D picture.  It is very important to initially set 3D View Point to -1, factory settings of 0 or plus 1 resulted in ghosting & double background images for 3D Monsters vs Aliens movie. Access thru TV Menu- Picture- Enter- 3D- View Point. Once familiar with TV settings one can always go back to View Point & make adjustments to see what happens. For personal preference, Picture Options- Motion Judder Canceller can be set to Standard or Smooth. Picture Modes available for 3D movies are Standard, Movie & BD Wise.2D to 3D  With only three clicks on remote, any incoming video from cable or Blu-ray disc player can be converted to a 3D picture. Hit 3D button, Enter & then on left double single person icon. Be sure to set focus/depth of the 3D image in Depth to 8 or 9 to give better 3D effect rather than factory setting of 4 or 5. Access thru TV Menu- Picture- Enter- 3D- Depth. 3D effect is not as deep as 3D movies & doesn't have pop-out-of-screen effects. But it gives a more realistic picture to any movie or cable program including some commercials. Like watching out of a window with background off in distance.  HD programs such as entertainment & sports benefit much from conversion to 3D. Blu-ray and even DVD movies take on a nice 3D effect- particularily with foreground/deep background scenes. Avatar 2D Blu-ray movie converted to 3D was pretty awesome, especially the flying scenes. Other movies meant for 3D, such as Journey to Center of Earth, have many scenes of foreground/deep background that have good 3D effects. Animated movies like Up, Cars, etc., really benefit from 3D conversion providing more immersion & enjoyment. Flying movies like 2012, Pearl Harbor, Amelia, etc. achieve great depth in the flying scenes. The series Over America, Over California, etc., and Wing Flight (available from Amazon.com) are really awesome when flying over cities, mountains and alongside the birds.  This TV was worth it just for the amazing 2D to 3D conversion of programs and movies since true 3D movies & cable programs are so few right now. It is entertaining just to review past viewed movies to see how more realistic the picture is.Audio  As expected, the built-in small two speakers audio is poor, typical of flat screen TVs. It is mandatory that at least a 5.1 receiver/speaker set-up be used to get nearly the theater experience. Doesn't have to be very expensive or new system to achieve the enjoyable surround sound to go with fantastic looking movies. Samsung 3D Blu-ray disc player only has one HDMI 1.4 output, one digital optical output, analog 7.1 output & 2 Ch analog but no HCMI 1.3 output for current receivers. Newer 7.1 audio receivers have HDMI 1.4 pass-thru to TV & best Dolby & DTS capability. Otherwise a 5.1 receiver that supports lower quality Dolby Digital & DTS thru the optical connection to disc player is ok, like our 2001 audio system that can still rattle the walls. We plan to up-date to 7.1 HDMI 1.4 pass-thru system later.Summary  A TV capable of giving perfect reproduction of original video at any viewing angle and can adjust many things for personal preferences of picture. 3D movies are awesome & gives occasional pop-out-of-screen effects. 2D to 3D conversion of cable programs & movies can give really nice realistic effect when have foreground with deep background- particularily flying & mountain scenes. TV is worth it just for 2D to 3D convesion. 3D glasses are comfortable & fit over regular glasses. Samsung 3D Blu-ray player is outstanding with small compact design, amazing quick disc load times & contemporary design with touch buttons & see-thru window above disc. This plasma cons are the poor audio which is universal with flat screen TVs making at least a separate 5.1 or better audio system mandatory for theater like expeience. (Didn't deduct rating for audio.) Also, this size plasma set uses 440W of power compared to 201W for old 57\" projection TV & more than same size LCD flat panel TVs. But this is equivalent of only 2 more light bulbs being on and is small price to pay for exceptional picture with 3D capabilties.", "Date": "July 28, 2010"}, {"Title": "DO NOT BUY!

There is a 12 month warranty on the product, but when I called for service I was told that Samsung will not cover \"physical damage\".  There warranty says they will cover problems due to manufacturing or workmanship.It turns out many people have this exact same issue.Problem with the workmanship of this model:1) This is a known problem related to \"thermal expansion\" and the thinness of the screen.2) This is my second TV of the same model that was broken -- first arrived with cracked screen and was replaced.3) The TV repairman that Samsung sent to investigate said that out of 1000s of TVs that he repaired, only 5 have had cracks like this and 3 were of my model4) Looking on the internet, specifically at Amazon where I bought it, only the Samsung plasma TV has a cracked screen problem.  If you look at the reviews, you'll see many customers who've had this issue.

I thought it would be helpful to others if I shared. Long story short, I've gone through the UN55B6000, PN58B860, UN55C7000 and PN58C7000 and PN58C8000.We moved into a new apartment, and needed a new tv to go over our fire place. We were upgrading from a 5 year old Samsung 720p DLP TV.--UN55B6000--Loved the form factor of the TV. Got it home and after a few days I was just unhappy with the overall look of the LCD/LED. I really saw a lot of motion blur.--PN58B860--I returned the LED TV and went with this TV. I absolutely LOVED the picture quality of the TV. But it buzzed terribly. It sounded like a bug zapper. I could actually hear it over top of the regular tv volume at a 12 ft distance. Best Buy swapped it out for another one. The second PN58B860 buzzed even louder. I gave it about 3 weeks to see if it would get better but it didn't. So I returned it and waited for the 2010 models to come out.--UN55C7000--When I heard that the new 2010 models were out, I went down to my friendly Best Buy to hopefully pick up the new plasma. Unfortunately, they only had the new LED in. The sales person told me that all of the issues were fixed on this set that I was unhappy with previously with the UN55B6000. He convinced me to give it a try and that if I were unhappy with it that they would gladly take it back. Sure there was still lighting in the corners and some motion blur, but it was much better. I still wasn't sold on this set, as I LOVED the PQ on the plasma. I decided to go with the plasma and return this set.--PN58C7000--Awesome picture quality - however, it's stuck in the soap opera mode and can't be taken out. To me and everybody I know, it looks like a soap opera in fast forward. I can't stand to watch the tv in this mode. It's very odd to me that it's this way, as only the 8000 is supposed to have MJC, so why does the 7000 have it but not have a way to take it off? I found a work around that allows the user to turn the game mode on/off that then caused the MJC to turn off. As a result of this, I returned it to Crutchfield and upgraded to the 8000 series. By the way, can somebody explain to me who would want to buy the 7000 series plasma and be stuck with having MJC on? I just can't figure it out!--PN58C8000--I LOVE this TV. Seriously, it's amazing. I like the dark grey bezel better than the black of the 7000 series. Something about it looks more gadgety/elegant. This TV makes a sound when it's on. I can hear it 12+ feet away when sitting right in front of it. It's definitely not a buzz like the PN58B860 that I had before. It sounds more like a fan running. When the volume is at a regular volume I don't notice it at all. When you engage the 3D mode, it gets MUCH louder though. Still hardly notice it. In comparison to the Xbox 360 fan noise, it's much quieter.", "Date": "May 27, 2010"}, {"Title": "Great Picture - Runs a little hot though", "Author": "WillJ \"Will\"", "ReviewID": "R2MJWZIY1DMZQA", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I just purchased this from Amazon as my main TV.  I ordered it online and scheduled a delivery right from Amazon's website.  I had a choice of delivery as soon as 3 days or as long as 3 weeks from what I could tell.  I got a follow-up email the next day from the delivery company confirming delivery.  On the appointed date, they showed up ontime but had the wrong TV.  He called his dispatcher and they had to return to base and get mine.  About 4 hours later, they showed up with the right TV.  The box looked undamaged but I opened it while they were there to make sure it was OK inside. They only unloaded it into my garage which was OK for me but they may have brought it in the house if I asked them to - They seemed friendly and cooperative.  So, you may get them to delivery indoors to a particular room if you want - I guess it depends on the driver.I upgraded from a 6 year old CRT rear projection HDTV (1080i).  Overall I am very pleased with the picture quality but it took me a week or so of playing with the picture properties to get it where I liked it.  Out of the box it was pretty much set correctly as far as color but I had to fiddle with the contrast, brightness and gamma to get the best picture - Initially it was fairly dark and dull.  I wound up with the contrast and brightness up to 75 and the gamma at +1 and the sharpness at 20.  I have read that I will probably have to readjust these in a few weeks as the TV needs to have 200+ hours on it for the phosphers to settle.  I turned off most of the other stuff for picture control (black, dynamics, film modes, etc..) as I wanted an unadulterated picture.  I was worried about glare and brightness but these are non-issues completely.  I have it in a south facing room with a double window on the adjacent wall.  No problems with screen brightness or reflections.  In fact, my old CRT reflected a lot more than this TV.  It is plenty bright and I do not have to fiddle with any shades.  I don't know yet but the rub about screen burn-in seems to have been addressed with a feature built in to the TV that causes pixel shift every 10 minutes - this is on automatically and can be adjusted or turned off.  I didn't notice it so I left it on.  There was only one warning in the owners manual about screen burn-in unlike my older CRT where there were bold warnings on every page about screen burn.  (I had that TV for 6 years with no hint of screen burn).  I don't play any video games and there are no kids to leave the TV unattended with fixed images so I don't expect this to be a problem with this set either.  I read other reports from others of a buzzing sound from this set or similar sets - mine is dead quiet.  No buzz whatsoever.  I noticed it did come with 2 ferrite cores to be installed on the power line if necessary so this buzzing sound could be an AC line power issue - perhaps geographic in nature depending on where you live and the kind of power (dirty vs clean, etc..)?  Don't know.  Mine is mute.Compared to my old rear projection CRT HDTV, the sharpness of this set is MUCH better. I can see things in the background that I couldn't see before.  On close-ups, it is phenomenal.  I can see the thread patterns in clothing like never before.  Yeah, I could see the nosehairs on my older set but now I can see a little too much of that nosehair.  The graphics are much better too.  TV guides and menus and so forth are much sharper.  When I bought my older set, I didn't see a lot of difference between the plasma and the CRT at that time.  Boy has plasma really improved.  This picture is as sharp and bright and most any modern TV - yes even LCD.  You have to go to the new 9000 series LED-LCD from Samsung to see any better picture - But that TV is $6000 in a smaller size.There is no motion blur or off-axis viewing issues with this set like LCD or LED-LCD.  It is also very thin at just over 1.5\" - thinner than most LCD's.  It weighed 84 pounds with the stand and I was able to lift it by myself up onto a low boy console (wall mount comes maybe next year).I haven't used the 3D yet but probably will in the future.  Nice to know it is there.  I haven't used any of the net stuff like Amazon or netflix nor have I even hooked up the ethernet.  I did download the latest firmware via thumbdrive from my computer and it worked flawlessly in about 15 minutes time.One feature I didn't realize the set has was HDMI control (ANYNET+).  I plan to buy a new AVR surround receiver in the future which will allow me to watch TIVO through the receiver without having the receiver on.  This is HDMI pass through in a sort of standby mode.  I have a sophisticated home theater setup but sometimes it is overkill to have all that equipment on just to watch the news - I want to just watch the TV and use the TV speakers.  This feature should allow me to do this once I buy a current receiver that supports it.The downside to this set, and the only one downside so far, is the heat this thing pumps out.  It is a like a little furnace.  It will raise the room temperature a good 2 degrees (11.5x15 room) in just a few hours.  I thought these new sets were energy star compliant but I'm not sure where that comes from.  I assumed that it would be NO WORSE than my 6 year old CRT but it is (much worse).  My 6 year old HDTV CRT consumed 195 watts (57\" TV) and this bad boy pumps out a whopping 440 watts (58\" TV) according to the back panel information off of both sets.  As a result, my electric meter is spinning and the TV is heating up my room.  No problem in the winter I guess but right now, it has me sweating.  I knocked it back 1 star for this but this may be severe on my part as power consumption my be something that Samsung can do little about for Plasmas.Overall this is a fantastic TV.  I bought this thinking I would keep it a year or 2 and upgrade to a local dimming LED-LCD as I figure that technology would have evolved to a point where the price would be better.  $2500 for this plasma set is a bargain.  With the extended finance option, it is a steal compared to other retailers.  I wanted a 63\" but it was another $1000 so this size is sort of the sweetspot, price-wise.  Mabye the local dimming LED-LCD's will come down in a couple of years to where a 63\" or larger will be around this price.  That 9000 series Samsung LED-LCD is nothing short of phenomenal.  Still have that darn motion blur though with LCD..............", "Date": "July 5, 2010"}, {"Title": "Scrumptious picture.", "Author": "Gregory Lee \"Greg\"", "ReviewID": "R619UZ1DE761", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I've had my pn58c8000 for a week, as I write this, and I'm very happy with it.  (I didn't buy mine from Amazon, since Amazon won't ship it to Hawaii.)  Here is my take on a few issues that concerned me when I was deciding to buy:(1) Is the c8000 plasma enough better than the c7000 to justify its higher price?  I think the jury is still out.  The c8000 provides control of the Motion Judder Cancellation feature, while the c7000 doesn't, at least out of the box.  But a future firmware release may add that control for the c7000.  Most commentators dislike the MJC and just want to turn it off.  I like it, personally, but in any case, it's good to have control of it.  The Real Black Filter of the c8000 may or may not improve the apparent contrast of the picture, but it certainly doesn't hurt.(2) Will the TV buzz?  Samsung and other brands of plasma sometimes make an irritating buzzing or humming sound.  This pn58c8000 is my third Samsung plasma TV, and none of my sets have buzzed.  When my pn58c8000 was delivered, before I would sign a receipt, I listened carefully to it with the sound off, and I had my wife listen, also.  No buzz -- dead silence.  (But that doesn't mean your set won't buzz -- it might.)(3) Will bright patterns be burnt in to the screen?  Quite unlikely, I'd say.  It's never happened to me.  (I have had retained images on my previous plasma sets, but they go away after a few hours.)  What little danger there is can be avoided with just a little care.  Every few days, at least for the first few weeks, use the TV's menu selection for Screen Burn Protection, Scrolling.  The white edge that pans across the screen will make any retained image obvious, and if you see any, just let the pattern run on until it \"shocks\" the pixels to remove the image.  (I just now did that, for the third time since I got my set, and I saw no retained images at all.)(4) How does 3d look?  I don't yet have a 3d blu-ray player, so I can't tell you about 3d blu-rays.  I do subscribe to DirecTV, so I've watched several hours of their n3D channel programming, using the Samsung SSG-2200AR rechargeable glasses.  It looks good to me.  I do occasionally see some \"ghosting\" with screen graphics, when a faint image intended for the opposite eye is visible.  And I could wish for higher light output for sunny scenes.  (The 3d LED sets, I understand, are worse on the ghosting issue, but better at providing high light output.)(5) Does the 2d to 3d conversion work?  I was surprised at how well it works, but I don't actually use it very often, so far.(6) What about setting up the network?  Nothing to it, if you've got an ethernet cable connection to a well functioning network.  I simply plugged in the cable and turned on the set.  It was all automatic.  It took a while for the TV to download the standard applications from the Samsung internet servers.  I haven't taken the time yet to do more than play a few UTube videos.  Seems to work.  On the other hand, playing photos/music/videos from the DLNA servers on my local net does not seem to work at all well.  The TV can show menus of the available files, but so far it has refused to actually play anything for me.  (I do have two other working DLNA clients, a PS3 and two DirecTV boxes, so I don't think it's a problem with my installation.)(7) Do the picture controls need to be changed?  Yes, I think so.  Mine looked good when I first turned the TV on, but not great.  But there are plenty of user controls available (this is a strong point of Samsung TVs).  Here are the picture settings I'm using now: Mode Movie, Cell Light 15, Contrast 62, Brightness 72, Sharpness 15, Color 41, Tint 50/50, and Advanced Settings: Dynamic Contrast Low, Gamma +1, Flesh Tone -9, and Picture Options: Color Tone Warm2, Motion Judder Canceller Smooth, and 3D: Depth 7. Other controls I have at their default values.  It looks great, to me, but it might be a little dark toned for some. (Settings edited 7/25/10 to make colors more subdued.)(8) What settings to use for 3D? The shutter glasses cut out some light and impart an orangey tint, so to get a natural looking picture, you have to compensate, somehow. I'm not all that happy with the following settings, but it's the best I've been able to do.  Mode Standard, Cell Light 18, Contrast 76, Brightness 68, Sharpness 20, Color 43, Tint 54/46, and Advanced Settings: Dynamic Contrast High, Gamma +1, Flesh Tone -9,and Picture Options: Color Tone Cool, Motion Judder Canceller Smooth. (3D settings edited 8/1/10.)(9) Screen reflections?  I have my TV in a very light room, with multiple windows on three walls.  There is a window behind my chair, and I do see its reflection in the TV screen, during the day.  It's slightly diffused by the TV's screen coating.  It doesn't bother me, and my wife hasn't mentioned it, one way or the other.--Greg", "Date": "July 21, 2010"}, {"Title": "Wonderful Television that is Not Perfect", "Author": "Keynote", "ReviewID": "R11CZNAA2E58DS", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I have to say that the picture quality on this television is almost perfect. I have had many televisions ranging from Samsung LED 55UNC7000 to Panasonic V10 plasma. Out of all of them, this television has the best picture quality. The black levels are super and the video processing is excellent. The remote control is really nice and is backlit. I really like Samsung's PQ, especially when it comes to color saturation. If you are looking at this television in a store and think that the colors are washed out, then they probably did not change the default settings. I prefer Samsung's PQ to Panasonic's, due to how vibrant the colors are on the Samsung.Television Issues:Even though I love this television, it does have some issues. This television does give off a buzzzzzzzzzing sound. Some people may not consider this an issues because the loudness of the sound might depend on their setup (how close the back wall is to the television, angle of the TV, sound dynamics of the room, etc.) My television makes a popping sound sometimes, maybe due to temperature changes inside the unit. One other thing that I am noticing on the PN58C8000 is the dejudder mode is causing strange things to occur on the screen. For example, if a person moves their head quickly, there is sometimes what looks like pixelation around the head. This occurs frequently.Overall this is a great television, but it looks like Samsung did not learn from last year. I would give this television 5 stars if it did not exhibit these strange and maybe annoying sounds.", "Date": "April 24, 2010"}, {"Title": "Incredible picture for 8 days......", "Author": "Greg Ritchie", "ReviewID": "R2O6O5MLD0D2MD", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I bought this set on a pre-boxing day sale mostly based on the strength of the editor and consumer reviews on CNET.

There are many settings and spending a little time with it will result in a picture you would not think possible out of a television.These new plasmas are light and thin, much lighter than previous plasmas.Samsung claims the are no more burn in issues, and the tv needs no break in.This is still a hotly debated subject, so I would not recommend any still picture for hours on end just to be on the safe side.I have ZERO buzz out of this set, although some have complained that the set they purchased has a buzzing noise.No common lcd issues such as flashlighting, halos, color bleed etc.Reflections can be a problem as with most LCD tv's and plasma's, I have always kept the blinds drawn for daytime viewing although I am the only one in the household that notices it.The internet acces is a plus, I bought samsung's wireless dongle and it connected immediately to my wireless network.Netflix on this tv is awesome, which puzzled my as the quality on a computer screen is less than average at best.This tv is just full of options, more of a mini computer.For the money, this top tier Samsung offers the best picture and features that can be found at a price at least a thousand less than samsung's comparable LCD.The remote is much improved over previous samsung remotes, and has a good layout.So don't let the dim unadjusted picture in a store sway you, they are kept like that to influence you to the LCD which carries a higher profit margin.I guess you could call this set one of the best kept secrets on the plasma market and carries my highest recommendation.The only thing that was laughable was the delivery.The set was supposed to be brought inside and tested to see if it was working.The trucking company sent out one little gentleman, that looked to be in his late sixties, I had to get my teens to get the set in the house, this poor guy had no chance to get it in.I shudder to think what would of happened if there was no one available to help, or if the tv had to go to a second floor.I was expecting two people, which I felt was needed, but the shipping was free, although substandard for those that don't have the ability to help.Unpacking the tv takes less than a minute, remove the strapping, remove the 4 plastic clips at the bottom, and the box slides off the top, with the tv ready for mounting, which is a TWO person operation.If you wall mount, remove the base screws BEFORE you remove the tv from the bottom of the box, the base will remain in the box when lifting the tv with no effort required.Make sure you install the ferrous cores on the power cord on installation.The power cable must be looped though these cores, or the cores will slide up and down the cord.These cores need to be kept withing one inch of the tv and the plug.A higher end power strip is recommended for power surges, as even the smallest wear down the tv's electrical comonents over time and can lead to premature failure.", "Date": "June 27, 2010"}, {"Title": "TV broke after 4months", "Author": "Fir9starter", "ReviewID": "R1EKU0Q10BJMGB", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "TV had great picture when it worked, but it broke after 4 months.

Hom", "ReviewID": "R3C1KZXKPN382I", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I've had this 58\" TV for a little over a month now and I am still amazed at the picture quality.  For reference, I upgraded from a 60\" 2007 Sony 60A200 rear projection television.  When I was shopping for a new TV, I researched the subject for weeks.  I was deciding between this Samsung plasma, Panasonic's VT series plasma, and LG's top of the line local-dimming LED TV.  I was set on the LG until I read reviews on AVS forum that the screen was highly reflective and thus, not so good in daylight conditions.  However, I really liked how slick LED TVs look with their very slim profile.  I decided to go with plasma since plasma TVs have very deep black levels.I chose the Samsung over the Panasonic for a couple of reasons:  First was aesthetics.  The Samsung TV is just beautiful.  The profile is very thin and can be easily mistaken for an LED TV.  The bezel is a matte dark charcoal grey.  I really love the matte finish as the glossy finish on many TV bexels is distracting, IMO.  The other reason I chose the Samsung over the Panasonic is because of the rising black level problems that Panasonic had with their plasmas last year.  Some people say that the black level problem has been fixed while others say that it has not.  Either way, I did not want to take a chance.  I've heard that the Panasonic has an outstanding picture, but my Samsung's picture is just amazing.  Saturated, accurate colors with deep black levels.  I'm watching a football game right now and I can't believe how black one of the team's jerseys are.  Simply beautiful.Couple of notes on this TV:- The screen is not reflective whatsoever.  I watch TV during the day on the weekends and I have a very large window adjacent to the TV.  No reflections whatsoever.- The TV has a VERY wide viewing angle, unlike LED TVs.  No drop off in contrast or picture quality when viewing the TV from an angle.  Also, the TV swivels about 20 degrees each way.  Very smooth and stable.  Great when I'm in a different part of the room, but still want to watch something.  I didn't realize how useful this feature would be.- You can turn Motion Dejudder off.  Some TVs, especially LED TVs, have a \"video\" or \"soap opera\" look to them.  It's as if you're watching a home video production.  Some people like this but others do not.  With this TV, you can choose this setting or turn it off.  I believe this is one of the big differences between Samsung's 8000 vs. the 7000 series plasmas.- Some Samsung TVs last year exhibited a buzzing sound when on.  Mine has absolutely no buzzing whatsoever.- Bult-in Netflix and Vudu services are outstanding.  Check out Vudu if you're looking for high quality HD movies on demand.  Simply beautiful.- I did not break-in my plasma like many people on [...] recommend.  No matter.  I've watched lots of ESPN with static images and movies with black bars above and below and I have not seen any image retention or burn-in.I'm so impressed with this TV that I'm going to get another one later this year for my family room.

I wanted something thinner, so when you walk into the room you don't see a side of a TV. I leaned plasma given the response time, viewing angle, and value/$ relative to the LCD/LEDs.  I did not want to have any motion blur given I am a gamer as well.  So, this TV is great.  Solid picture and the settings another reviewer recommended seemed to work well.No buzzing as some reviews noted. I was amazed at how easily it connected (wired) to my network for the apps and the model number was already available as an add-on to my Harmony 900 remote. The TV is a bit shiny, but most of them are.  The TV is in a media room, so it is dark most of the time.  The color of the TV is graphite in color, which is a step up from the 7000 which apparently is just black.I figured if I am upgrading I might as well get one which is 3D ready.  However, I did not purchase the Blue Ray or Glasses yet.  Reasons why:  (1) there is no content available (even AVATAR isn't out in 3D).  (2) I have a PS3 and later this year it will be able to process 3D Blue Rays, (3) XpanD X103 3D Glasses will be available in July (I emailed the manufacturer)and they can be used on any 3D TV and at the theater...for about $129/each.

At first I was against buying a 3D tv though the stunning 2D picture quality turned me around. I now enjoy both options of viewing.I do not write reviews, though and writing this one as a warning.This tv is beautiful. I however would never have bought this plasma version, if I had not been constantly told that burn in was a thing of the past for these newer model plasma. I would likely have opted for the LED. I am pretty unhappy when I notice scenes that expose my 4:3 burn in. It is quite annoying to have had a tv 6mths to find that you were not supposed to watch it regularly and all shows AND commercials must be streched or zoomed. I went through the break in period well though it seems there are just so many things you may not watch. In particular, ESPN HD, or use the Dynamic (torch) mode as this is the only thing I can think of that would have caused my problems. And shame on me for letting my kids operate it and watch Nick shows which are all 4:3, as are most commercials. Although it is not clearly \"in your face\", unless you actually sit down and read the manual from start to finish, any burn in issue is not covered by warranty.If burn in were a thing of the past, I think they would cover this. With all it's stated \"technology\" to prevent burn in issues, I find it to be quite misrepresenting. I could so called \"fix\" possibly by burning/aging my entire screen, though this should not be neccesary. Still, I have a very beautiful picture for allbut lighter scenes.

A beautiful TV but for some reason thesunlit room I have it in and the fact that you pretty much have to be in a small arc in front of the TV for the picture notto bleach out became like an O C D thing that I couldn't get over. The bad news is after 2 weeks I had gotten used tothe sharp, well defined picture with muted colors and now have to get acclimated to the deeper colors and blacks ofthe plasma. All that being said, The Samsung is a beautiful TV with plenty of preference adjustments. Thanks to anotherreviewer for giving me a starting point. I got lucky in the exchange process and got the free starter kit Samsung was offeringso I got the Bluray 3D player, 2 pair of glasses and the Monsters vs. Aliens disk.  I figured I might as well get a set with the3 D capability. It is just a novelty now but more media seems to be on the way and it is a fun experience.I have only had it a day but what can I say. It's a Plasma and a good one.Update to my review: Problem has arisen Just over a year now and a dark band has started to appear across the top of the picture at intervalsHaven't contacted Samsung yet and unfortunately i did not get an extended warranty. How do they know to break right after the warranty is upOn a side note the 3d blu ray player was garbage. Constantly froze and stuttered. Bought a new more expansive model BD-D6500ZA (i know anything is more expensive than free)and its mostly good but chooses not to like certain disks and requires a rebootUPDATE  The Bad news: Well the problem with the band got worse and expanded to a sort of pinkish wash across the screen on white backgrounds.  Now the good news: After several calls to Samsung they agreed to do a one time extended warranty for me. OK Great.. but wait.... the part ( and i guess they knew the problem cause their service people never came out) was no longer available. Now what? throw it out?

I knew that I wanted a 55\" or plus tv.  I wanted the best HD quality I could find.I initially was going to go with the highest rated 2009 samsung but had heard a great deal about a buzzing issue (PN55860?).  It scared me off.  I then switched and decided on Panasonic.  I then found out that they have issues with not maintaining the blacks and that \"graying\" occurred after so many hours.  I checked that one of the list.  Next up was the LG and I nearly pulled the trigger on the LG LE8500 despite how pricey it was.  I still have no criticism of that tv, but I found this one and was able to get what I hoped would be as much or more t.v. for the price.I did not care about having 3d, but thought it would be pretty cool to have it anyway.  I bought the bundle through Amazon which included the 3d blue ray player and 3d kit.  I have not yet checked out the 3d so I am not able to comment as to the 3d technology.I have seen the picture and it is lights out incredible.  I have to say that the room it is in has a great deal of outside light and it doesnt adversely effect my viewing.  It looks great on our wall as well.  I can hear no buzzing that is emitting from the tv at all.  I may not be as acutely aware of those hard to hear sounds, but I hear nothing.I probably would be frustrated that the tv is not wireless ready out of the box (you have to buy a usb connector), but that is a non-issue since the blue ray player is wirelessly connected to the internet.  This is particularly awesome given the great things that come with (especially pandora...great for when you are working around the house and just want a playlist to go).I was also happy with the freight company that Amazon hired to have deliver the tv.  They brought it in, assembled what was needed and then ran a full check on the tv to ensure that it was working and fine.The tv is thin.  I dont know how to convey how truly thin it is.  I also like that Samsung was smart enough to make the HDMI outlets on the side and that area recessed so that I could flush mount it to the wall without the tv sticking out (which I did and purchased a peerless flush mount through Amazon as well).  I couldnt be happier with the way this worked out.This entire unit is driven by a newly purchased yamaha reciever with surround sound that has this setup sounding absolutely epic at this point.I have to say, although I just moved in and have barely had a chance to really sit down and relax to enjoy a full length player or even the 3d, I am extremely satisfied with this product.I hope this helps others like myself that have been concerned with spending this much money on a product you fully hope you will be satisfied with.  Good luck and hope your luck is as good as mine.UDPATE:  Have continued to have really good luck with this model.  I adjusted the settings and watch band of brothers in HD the other day and it was unreal.  It wasnt even bluray.  The one thing I would caution most people on is the 3d.  While it is really neat, do not think that this going to be like going to the IMAX and watching AVATAR.  It adds a great deal of depth and does give a 3D image, but it isnt as though things are popping out of the set like crazy.  If anything, it adds more depth \"into\" the set.  Still very cool and lets hope that the 3d market continues to flourish.  I would have bought this with or without the 3d and rarely use it.

Unfortunately, when I received my TV, it too had screen cracks on the top left and right and along the bottom.  I've given the TV an average rating when it may well deserve a top rating, because this is the only way I can pass the information on to other customers.  It seems that all of the Amazon customers with similar situations have been blaming the shipper, but I believe it is a Samsung packaging flaw.  I have owned several large screen LED and Plasma TVs.  The first thing I noticed that was different about this TV was that the center pedestal came pre-attached.  Also, it only had rigid corner and center styrofoam blocks for support.  When I discovered the cracked screen, I examined the packaging closely and noted several potential causes.  First, when placed on a flat surface with the TV inside the box and the top box cover removed, I discovered that the TV rocks on the center styrofoam pedestal support from side to side. This means that the bottom center support is higher than the side supports.  Second, there is no side support, except for the box, to absorb downward stresses.  This means that if any stress is applied to the top, the top styrofoam blocks would transfer the stress from the top corners of the TV, diagonally down the center of the TV to the pedestal.  This is because the side supportS are slightly shorter than the center support.  I believe this is the cause for the frequent screen cracks and not the shipping.  I recommended to Samsung that they remove the pedestal for shipping, or at least, place it on a soft, flexible, foam block, and add rigid side support so that stress from the top will be transmitted down the sides and away from the TV.  It has been frustrating for me, and other customers, to wait for the TV only to find it damaged when opened.  I'm also sure that Amazon can save thousands of dollars by helping avoid unnecessary damage.  Until the packaging situation is resolved, Amazon should insist that heavy objects NOT be placed on top of the TV box.  Unfortuantely for me, Amazon does not have a replacement TV and will not transfer the starter pack and bluray player promotion to another, more expensive TV.

I'm a freak when it comes to image quality, and while this screen was my second choice after the Panasonic series, my wife got the last word as the design of the Samsung was much better (come on Panasonic, design isn't that hard!).Overall the image quality is great, and there is a vast range of settings to play with in order to get the image you really want to. It's also pretty easy to switch between modes, and for people who use different sources (bluray, TV, DVD, video games) it helps a lot.Likewise, I live in a very bright flat in LA and this plasma is definitely one of the best I've seen in a bright room.I unfortunately can't comment on the 3D quality since I don't use it yet thanks to amazingly poor quality of this generation's 3D glasses.However, there is one drawback which makes it impossible for me to fully love it. The TV produces a pretty loud buzz depending on the brightness of the image. This is something Samsung do disclose on their website, and that is usually inherent to plasma screens, however this is my 3rd plasma and this one is definitely louder, to the point that you WILL notice it whenever there is a quiet scene in a movie (especially if your TV is mounted on the wall as it reflects the buzz from the back of the TV). Thankfully 95% of the time it's ok, but if, like me, you like your sound to be pure and have invested in a good sound system, it's really annoying every now and then to get sound pollution from your screen.It's not a total deal breaker, but had I known that when I made my choice I'd have probably fought a little more for the Panasonic.And now one piece of advice: the other thing I don't like about it is the smoothing of the image. Quite frankly this isn't just for Samsung, as in general I've never seen it working great on any TV, but these smooth modes add an incredible amount of artefacts in some fast moving scenes (like for instance the flying sequences in Avatar), and it seems that TV manufacturers still haven't cracked how to get this mode to work the way it should.So if I may make a recommendation to anyone considering to buy this screen, MAKE SURE YOU SET UP YOUR BLURAY PLAYER TO 24p frame rate, and activate the \"cinema smooth\" mode on this TV (I think it even triggers it automatically when your source is outputting 24p). It simply ensures the TV works normally on 24 frames per second, like a movie does, and gets rid of all the judder in a much more natural way than the standard smooth mode of the TV.", "Date": "February 1, 2011"}, {"Title": "Cracked Screen alert!!!!", "Author": "Brad Jackman Clooney \"musicmaker\"", "ReviewID": "RJ7EPU1Z8JT9B", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "My first TV was delivered with cracks in all four corners and another huge crack from the middle top to the center of the screen.

I am just into my first week of use and so far none of that has happened but others had their cracks occur after just a few weeks  of use so I am bracing myself about that happening anytime soon.Having said that, it has so far been one of my best TVs so far.  The older Panasonic plasma I owned still has more impressive colors and blacker blacks than this thinner one from Samsung.  The 2D to 3D conversion, however, is quite impressive and just for that alone the price is very much worth it. The conversion is almost perfect, but a few things have to be adjusted to optimize the quality of the picture.  Do not put the 3D depth beyond 6 as it will cause some subtle convexing or fishbowling effect of the image.  That is most obvious when there is text on the screen.  Adding the anti-judder effect gives the movie a TV-soap effect.  Smoothing out the judder makes the movie loose its cinema theater quality and makes it look like made-for-TV soap movie as it eliminates the 24p quality of the movie.", "Date": "January 23, 2011"}, {"Title": "Just incredible picture", "Author": "Wambli Ska", "ReviewID": "ROFYWP1VVKVO8", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I got this TV just over a month ago and the first weekened I had it I found it hard to leave the house.  Forget about the 3D capabilities for now (though I have to say they are MUCH better than the junk you see in theaters).

At 7,000,000:1 Contrast Ratio even the regular crapy HD broadcast from your cable provider will blow your mind.  It is so realistic that your brain actually protests and tells you that there is something wrong.  At times you feel like you can reach into the screen and touch things...  Playing a Blu-ray DVD is where this TV really shines at the moment.  I was watching the latest Star Trek and the scenes on the bridge were just stunning.  You can actually see the flaws in the actors makeup!!!  Movie directors better watch out with this new generation of equipment.  The screwups in their work come glaring at you from that ultra clear picture on screens like this.One feature of note.  The TV has a 3D mode built in where it actually takes an HD 2D picture and applies some tech magic to do a faux 3D.  I though this would be a cheesy ad-on that I would never use... Wrong...  If you have a good HD broadcast like some of the newer nature shows that have been recorded in the last few years when you turn on this 3D mode and put on your glasses, while you do not get a true 3D image out of it, it does add depth to the picture you are watching making it an experience on it's own.In summary, welll worth the money spent, specialy if you get the bundle with the new 3D player and the starter package with the glasses.

The clarity is unbelievable as well as the depth given to the video.  Normal cable (from comcast) is also excellent on the HD channels and very good on the normal SD channels.  The speakers are pretty good considering they are placed on the back of the TV (I guess it bounces the sound off the wall for increased effect).  I do have a Samsung surround sound system for the movies and is recognized by the TV for easy control.One of my hesitations from purchasing this unit (compared to the more expensive LED 8000 series) was that some people have reported in the reviews a buzzing or humming sound from the set.

My brightness is set at 45 and I hear none what so ever.With the bundled 3D player and glasses this makes for one excellent entertainment system (even more so with a surround sound system).Another great feature are the updates.  Keep the TV connected to the internet and it will always be up to date with the latest firmware/software so that it functions at its best.I am very pleased with this TV.", "Date": "June 13, 2010"}, {"Title": "only for dark rooms or nightime", "Author": "R. McLaughlin \"Stinkyonion\"", "ReviewID": "R1MBXITUD27CBE", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I have studied this TV on several occasions along with the comparible Samsung LED 3d and the panasonic plasma tv.  I have viewed 2D and 3D sources, and 2D to 3D converions.Pros:  This TV has a superb 2d image, very similar to the other tvs in this price range.  This TV is about an inch thick.  Styling is great.  Makes the Panasonic 3d plasma look like it is from a decade ago as it is 4 inches thick.  The Samsung glasses are like twice as comfortable as the Panasonic glasses.  The 3d picture is great, almost as good as the Panasonic (but is difficult to say as I was forced to view different source material).  It is definately better than the Samsung LED 3d tv which had significant artifact with fast motion in 3d.  The best of all:  STUNNING 2d to 3d conversion.  Couldnt believe it.  I watched a Blue Man Group concert and some other stuff, and was blown away.  I would never have thought that a processor could extrapolate correctly 3d from 2d but WOW.  I have heard quality depends on the source material and I dont know if I was just lucky or what.  Far better than expected.  The audience clearly extended away into the distance.  The performer's hands and the like would reach out towards me.  Seemed very natural, and similar to material shot in 3D.  2d to 3d NOT available on the Panasonic.  Cons:  I would give it 5 stars EXCEPT for the absence of a antiglare surface to the screen. Samsung advertises \"True Black\" antiglare treatment, but whatever that is it doesnt do anything to my eye.  Just look at the screen.  It is like a mirror.  Type the model number for the 50 inch model into Youtube and watch videos from it.  If you have a window behind the viewer, it will be perfectly portrayed on the screen.  Very disappointing, but common to all plasmas and all sizes of this model series.  The Panasonic has a slightly darker screen which makes the glare slightly less apparent, and the Samsung LED has better antiglare as well.  This TV is heavier than I expected, and was told that that is because it has 2 panes of glass, but then someone else told me it has one, so I dunno.  The remote has flush buttons which while stylish to me are less preferable than traditional buttons which I can press by feel without looking at them.  Summary:  The picture in 2d and 3d is very close to the Panasonic's quality.  But, the SAmsung surpasses the Panasonic because of the 2d to 3d, the vastly more comfortable glasses, and the thin screen.  Highly recommended.  The Sony and LG models release next month (June 2012)but are thought to be inferior based on reviews from CES 2010 (as they are LED models, not plasma which is better for 3d due to much higher refresh rate).Addendum:  I have now had my TV for a couple of weeks and viewed a fair amount of source material.  I have not had much of a problem with glare, except when viewing very dark material in the daylight (rare).  The picture is spectacular and I am still in love with the 2d to 3d conversion (it just amazes me).  I have had none of the pops and buzzing some have complained of, but I do sit about 12 feet away and maybe it is very subtle?  Cant wait for ESPN 3D to broadcast World Cup Soccer in June 2010 (Comcast and DishTV have are carriers).  Still glad I didnt get that fat Panasonic with uncomfortable glasses.Disclaimer:  I will admit that I do not own this TV--I own the 63\" model of this same series, but Amazon would not let me  review that until it was offered for sale by their site.  Now that it is offered for sale (preorder) I will add my review there.", "Date": "May 7, 2010"}, {"Title": "New 3d tv from Samsung", "Author": "K.

I bought this tv to replace my Sony 52\" XBR4 becuase I wanted the new 3D technology as well as well as a good HD TV. This is my first Plasma TV. I have 4 other LCD TVs that work great but I was really impressed witht he picture of the Plasma. The black are definately blacker than my LCDs. For a general HD TV it has the best picture out of all my TVs and it is also one of the best I have seen on the market. The internet on the TV is pretty good. It was easy to set up. I am using it directly connected to my router so it is wired. I did not fell like paying $80 extra dollars for the wireless adapter plus I had a Gigaswitch located in my rack that was easy to run a cable. The apps for the internet were quite responsice to my surprise. I though there would be a long lag time but that was not so. You have access to sports scores, weather, YouTube and Netflix just to name a few. I did notice a buzzing noise at first as mentioned in other reviews but it was only there when I initially installed it and now it its no longer there.Now onto the 3D. I demoed it at the store and I was pretty impressed. It was on a 47\" or 52\" LCD I think. It was not until I got the 63\" in my house that I was blown away. The 3D on the plasma was so much better. The picture just looked like it was going to pop right off the screen. I was really impressed with the 2D to 3D function of this tv. It actually works. It may not be the best but it works quite well. Yes you do look silly wearing the glasses but they felt really comfortable. I wear glasses and the 3D glasses fit right over them nicely. I did not get dizzy or get any headaches.I wanted to clarify some information about setting up a 3D system. when going to some stores i was given some wrong information. I was told that I would need to buy all the same brands for all the equipment needed. So I would need to buy the Samsung TV, Glasses and Blu-ray player. I knew that I need the TV and the Glasses to be the same but the Blu-ray player does not. I wanted to purchase the Panasonic Blu-ray player becuase it had the duel HDMI ports on it so that I would not have to upgrade to a receiver that has HDMI 1.4 to get the HD audio. I did purchase the Panasonic blu-ray and it works just fine.The reason I did not give it 5 was becuase it is a really new technology and I have only had it for about 2 weeks.

When it comes to TVs, I'm no expert by any means but I do my fair share of research before committing to spend anything above $2000. I've always been an LCD-type guy and didn't like plasmas because of the previous issues with them (burn in and lifespans). But with adequate research, I discovered that these areas have been exploited and highly improved by plasma manufacturers making the issues almost a thing of the past. I'm also the guy who likes new technology (I'm a programmer/application developer) and like to show off my new toys to friends. So why did I chose the plasma technology over the new technology, LED?...I'll start off by saying that for 2 months, I was torn between this plasma model (PN58C8000) and the LED UN55C8000. I did a lot of research, comparing and contrasting these two Sammys. Even got a chance to see them side by side at a local BB store. As others stated, the Brick and Mortar stores are not the best place to compare any TVs, including these two units because the LCD-LEDs will outshine the plasmas most of the time due to their brightness and also store settings.On January 28, 2011, Best Buy priced these two units only $100 apart; the LED being the cheaper one (that was heck of a deal). At the time, both offered the same 3D bundle (3D BluRay and Starter Kit). On February 1, I pulled the trigger on the plasma because of these advantages over the LED:1) Superior picture quality when viewing at an angle.2) It's 3 inch bigger than the LED. Although not much, I can still brag to my friend that mines is 3 inches bigger than his. No pun intended.3) Got this TV because of Superbowl XLV and all I can say is WOW. Everyone who came to my Superbowl party was talking about the TV and how life-like it looks, as if they were part of the game.4) Movies = No Soap Opera effect and more fluid and natural looking.5) It's 600Hz subfield motion, not 120 or 240. That means 60 frames per second x 10 sub-fields = 600 flashes per second, making the picture more fluid and less to none artifacts.6) This I really love. When watching a classic movie, such as Goodfellas, it gives a Movie Theater feel and picture to it. This is one of my favorite movies and my LCD (LN46C630) doesn't do it justice as this plasma does.7) Response time. For gaming and sports.8) Very minimal to no ghosting (crosstalk) in 3D.9) During dark scenes, no clouding present on-screen. This is actually one of this TV set's plus, the images pops out while background retains deep blacks.10) Cost less than the LED.Disadvatages over the LED:1) Less energy efficient2) Only a .2 or 1/5 inch fatter than the LED.3) Yes, it is still susceptible to image retention but it goes away fairly quickly. Haven't experienced it, personally.4) As for burn-in, with pixel shifter on, Samsung techs says it's almost impossible to get it.5) Not really a disadvantage but the LED does have a more pop to it because of its picture sharpness. This may also be a disadvantage, IMO, of the LED because it makes some scenes look rather fake or weird. For example, I watched a TV show on my friend's set and during a scene where a trash can was behind the characters, for some reason the characters were popping out and made everything else looks like another dimension. It's like taking a cut-out and pasting it on a piece of paper. Some people like this and some just don't. But again, that's all subjective. Personally, I could deal with if I had the LED.Other notable aspect I wanted to mention is the humming or should I say buzzing. Some reviewers experienced buzzing with these sets and some of those reviewers experience it worst than others. After chatting and speaking with several Samsung techs on different occasions, they all told me that it is normal for a plasma to buzz but not to an extent. My set does have a hum/buzz but I only noticed it after reading the comments from other online reviews and actually paying really close attention to it. I have to literally put my ear behind the TV set to hear it but when viewing it in front, it's not present. You have to try hard to just hear it. And since I have a surround sound (paired the set with the Bose Cinemate II), I don't hear it during viewing.As for 3D, I watched Monsters vs. Aliens and it's like watching it in theaters. Haven't tried the set with gaming but I've read that it's pretty amazing.Hopefully, this review helped in some way for those looking to buy either of the two models mentioned.Happy hunting and good luck on your decision. Either way you go (LED or Plasma), you will enjoy your new HDTV. Me and my friend does.Additional sources:[...][...]", "Date": "February 16, 2011"}, {"Title": "Missed on a few technical areas", "Author": "Bismark", "ReviewID": "RSGGPHYA27YBD", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "For a TV of this price, I had expected better technical performance.  The primary problem this TV has is that it does not process audio signals properly when the customer has a separate 5 or 7 channel audio receiver / speaker system. One would expect the TV to pass through any digital audio signal it receives over the HDMI 1.4 interface to the optical audio output which one would hook to their receiver.  However, this TV down grades the audio to 2.1, (I assume that is what it needs for the built in speakers)  The solution is to connect one's sources to the receiver and have it pass on the video and audio to the TV. This works for the customer devices, but does not work for internet provided content, as that is transmitted directly to the TV over the internet.Thus NETFLIX and other internet audio cannot be run into the receiver in its native mode, but only 2.1 format.  It took me 4 days to get Samsung technical support to confirm this fact.Another smaller problem is that there is no way to delete local media \"devices\" once the TV finds them.  In my case, when I got the internet working (easy to do, BTW) the TV found three of my computers and continues to list them as \"Devices\" although I am not sharing anything from them.  I am sharing using Samsung PC Manager, but that is the last \"device\" the TV found, and so any time I want to access media from my PC such as pictures, songs or video, I have to push the \"A\" button on the remote and skip over the \"devices\" I don't share.  It should be possible to delete devices that TV has found.I put this information here as it seemed like a place that customers might actually read.In general the TV works very well and it would be too much trouble to return it for these aggravations.

Blacks are deep, colors look natural and not oversaturated.The audio from the tv is sufficient, however, I have it hooked up to a 7.1 surround sound system, so the tv audio rarely will be used.I like that the tv can see all of my devices hooked up to the network and can pull in my music, photos, and video content. I have tried using the Hulu Plus and the Netflix apps that are built into the tv, and they also work well.  My only complaint is with this, though. I cannot seem to find a way to turn off the \"soap opera effect\" from the motion judder canceler. It is visually jarring to watch something that looks like it's being fast forwarded.As far as 3d content, I watched the first shrek movie that came alone with the package.  It does a great job with 3D. I also used the 2D to 3D conversion to watch Mission Impossible that was playing on tv.  While not quite as deep as with shrek, it did a good job of showing depth in halls and separating the actors from the background.I also have a PS3 hooked up and tested out a couple of the 3D games available including PAIN, and Avatar.

I have an older theater system that only supports 1.3 HDMI. so wiring the HDMI cables from the cable box and the DVD player directly from the devises to the TV and using optical cables from the devises to the home theater works perfect. if I sent the HDMI thru the theater sys I would get 1080i and directly to the TV, 1080p. the unit is just gorgeous, the cables are easily accessible because the unit can swivel to give easy access. the wireless hookup was very easy all I needed was my security key and there you are. downloaded the newest firmware to my usb from my computer then plugged into the TV it auto installed. the online software all downloaded without a hitch. without any problem recognized my 2 other computers and accessed them with no problem. okay so how is the 3D, well thru the Blue Ray it is just like the theater experience. But you can also watch any program whether a DVD movie or any TV program in 3D. I would recommend to chg the 3D settings though, for 3D DVD set the 3D to 0,1,-1 for non 3D DVD and TV programs set it to 8, to give a more pronounced effect.

Brathwaite Jr", "ReviewID": "RB4MYG6P896ZX", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "My old Sony Trinitron FINALLY died and I was SOOOOOOO happy to replace it.  My wife thought I was just trying to find an excuse to buy a new Flatscreen TV. LOL  I was happy to upgrade and couldn't wait to buy a new HDTV.  So I set my sights on a flat screen TV with excellent picture quality, feature rich and internet capable.  I'm a big movie watcher so picture quality was of the utmost importance.  LCDs are the hot TVs now with a lot of additional features and I really wanted to get into streaming internet video to my TV.  So that's where I focused my search and that's where the future seemed to be going.In my research, I found that LEDs were closing the gap for LCDs and Plasmas.  So when I was making my selection I had the following TVs on my list to choose from; Samsung  UN55C690 LED, LG INFINIA 55LE8500 LED, LG INFINIA 55LE5500 LED, and as a late add the Samsung PN58C8000 Plasma.  I have experience with Plasmas as I already had a Panasonic 50\" and I really enjoyed the picture quality.  So I had this constant internal dilemma that I LCDs were just not going to match up with the picture quality.  I searched high and low for an LCD/LED HDTV and just could not find any within an affordable price range with comparable picture quality.  For me that was the tie breaker, and trumped any feature an LCD could offer.  Because ultimately that is what you do is watch TV so it made sense for that to be the highest priority when searching for a new HDTV.So I took my list and started to go to stores to scout the TVs and started at Best Buy.  The salesman there pointed out something when I asked \"why should I get an LCD over a Plasma?.\"  He said \"look at the TVs we feature in our showroom, 95% are Plasmas because they still have superior picture quality over LCDs.\"  So it re-enforced what I believed all along that Plasmas were the way to go.  So I turned my focused to Plasmas and found the Samsung PN58C8000.  This attractive thin flat-screen really caught my eye.  The picture quality is stunning! I love the Dynamic Picture and Movie modes.  The blacks are fantastic and it has a nice bright picture in a lot of sunlight.  My wife laughs at me when I sit back in appreciation of the quality and my satisfaction in my selection.  I honestly really didn't want 3D but I looked at it as an additional feature rather than an added incentive to buy it.  Maybe I'll use it in the future but the side effects of watching for long periods in 3D freaks me out.  The Samsung PN58C8000 has a lot of menu settings to customize the picture or the TV overall which I like.  The Tools menu setting allows for quick changes to the picture and sound whether its a lot of sunlight or to enjoy the darker settings for watching movies.  Out of the box, the settings are a mess so take your time getting them just right.  Another great feature is the Internet TV and the Samsung Apps.  With this feature, you can get quick weather/news/sports updates as well as save some money by not paying for premium cable movie channels and instead stream Netflix movies.  With a decent wireless router, you can stream pretty seamlessly with little delay while watching a picture.  I was impressed!  However, I was disappointed that I couldn't use any wireless adapter since the Samsung adapter is expensive.  I actually tried a Cisco wireless adapter but it didn't work.  But once I did get the Samsung wireless adapter, it worked like a charm.  It was very easy to install.  I had to put on the extension it came with as it was too close to the TV and interfered with the signal.  For my other HDTV that is not internet ready, I hooked up my Wii and now I'm good to go with Netflix on that one as well.Now I may be impressed with the TV overall but it does have some drawbacks.  For instance, the factory settings gave the picture a Soap opera look which was really annoying and worried me a bit at first.  It really changes the feel of a show/movie and not for the better. Once turned the Motion Judder Function off, it eliminated the soap opera feel.  It really should be called soap opera function because it didn't improve the motion picture but moved the picture slowly like a cameraman was filming it in real-time.  One key that that truly concerns me is that the TV runs extremely hot.  Now although this is normal with Plasmas, the Samsung PN58C8000 seems to be much hotter.  I did an unofficial comparison with my other Plasma and I touched both to see and the Samsung PN58C8000 was much hotter.  This hasn't caused any issues at this point so as of now I'm not too concerned about it.  I've had the TV over a month now.  The remote control it comes with is sleek but it's not an universal remote therefore it's useless for the long term.  Lastly, the TV packaging was minimal which surprised me for a TV this thin and fragile.  The first TV shipped to me was damaged with cranks throughout the picture screen.  Fortunately, the company provided good service and replaced it with no problem.  I was relieved I didn't have to fight like a mad man for a new one. LOLOverall, the Samsung PN58C8000 is an excellent TV with superb picture quality, great extra features with minor issues.  If you are looking for great picture quality, a slim look at a decent price, this TV fits the bill.  I'm REALLY happy with the purchase! BTW, Avatar looks AWESOME on this TV!

Plasma panels pixels can't generate different shades, so they need to use so-called dithering. For temporal dithering, they refresh each frame a few times. This TV uses 600 Hz subframe rate, so each frame is refreshed 10 times. Each pixel can be turned on for 0 to 10 times per frame; this creates 10 grades of brightness. Spatial dithering uses a group of pixels (4x4) to make a pattern. A side effect of dithering is the picture noise.With 2D program, the dithering noise is not much noticeable from viewing distance. But with 3D program, a picture for each eye can only have half as much subframes (5), and one subframe may be completely blanked to suppress ghosting. Because of that, the dithering becomes very harsh. It's almost as bad as old 16 color GIF files viewable on ancient PC EGA display controllers in circa 1990.Also, the 3D glasses lose sync very often. Then one eye may see a discolored image, or the eyes will switch the images, causing weird \"inverse perspective\" effect. I suspect it's because the plasma gives off too much its own infrared noise, and also the glasses don't detect the switching rate and won't sustain the proper switching when they lose the signal.Because an LCD panel can control brightness of each pixel individually, it doesn't need temporal dithering and should not suffer from excessive dithering noise for 3D programs.

I obtained his address and contact information from the Samsung website.  I also took photographs of the TV misbehaving and enclosed the photos with the letter.  I also sent copies to my dealer and to Consumer Reports.Within a week after mailing the letter, I received a phone call from Samsung corporate.  They offered to replace the TV with a new, SMART TV (actually, a 60\" as opposed to the 58\").  All I had to do was pay an exchange fee of (as I recall) about $350.00.  This included air transportation and delivery of the new TV.The new set was delivered and they took away the old set.  I am very, very, happy with the outcome.  I do not know if the new set will last any longer, but the point is that SAMSUNG CAME THROUGH with a reasonable solution.  The new set is one of their newer SMART TV's with Bluetooth as opposed to infrared 3d glasses.  Its a great set and I am so happy.I will continue to purchase Samsung products.OLD INFORMATION BELOW:TV is 2.5 years old, paid $3K.  Until the past few months, watching this television was like wrapping yourself in a blanket made of milk chocolate...warm, sweet, and utterly satisfying.A few months ago it developed a purple/pink horizontal band whenever source material is mostly white.  I thought that, perhaps, my HDMI cable was responsible, but I replaced it and no difference.After researching this issue online, I have found that I am not alone.Unit is out of warranty and repair is $1,200.00 (replacing the display).  Obviously, no one would spend $3K on a television that only lasted 2.5 years.  I don't think I want to spend the $1,200.00 to repair this.  Prices have come down and I presume I can get a comparable TV for significantly less than $3K.After discussing this problem with service agency, I called the Samsung \"Executive Customer Relations\", who told me there is nothing they can do.  I am supposed to get a telephone call from a supervisor/manager, but I do not have my hopes too high.Anyway, of course I am sick over this.  Television is still watchable, but the pink band is getting progressively worse.  Samsung claims that this is not a problem they are aware of.  Yea.  Sure.  I wouldn't be so pissed off if they would come clean.Their online support not helpful, and simply told me to call a repairman.At any rate, I am not going down without a fight.  I am trying not to sound too hysterical, but rest assured, Samsung has not heard the last about this.  I would be happy if they split the cost with me.  Although $600.00 is still too much to pay, its within the realm of reasonable.  I'd even accept a $500.00 credit toward the purchase of a new Samsung TV.If I am completely unable to get any satisfaction from Samsung, I guess I'll never buy another Samsung product.

I have taken care of the TV to prevent burn in (or so I thought), which everyone states should not even be a consideration with these newer plasmas. Unfortunately, I can tell you this is NOT the case. I estimate I have about 400 hours on the TV. I watch some 4:3 content (about 25% of the time), but try to watch full screen HD whenever possible. A couple nights ago, I noticed lines where the outline of the 4:3 picture ends and the vertical black bars begin. I read up on this and tried displaying snow for a couple hours. This did not fix the problem. The Samsung manual also suggested I use gray bars instead of black for the borders. This information is found under the Screen Burn Protection section. Well, this model TV does not even have that option. What makes it worse is that in an entirely different section of the manual under Size, it warns about watching 4:3 content and how this can cause burn in at the edges of the 4:3 window. Of course, it also states that this is not covered under warranty. Who is going to look under Size to read about burn in when there is a specific section called Burn In Protection? They need better tech writers! Needless to say, I'm very disappointed that my nice, new TV now has these lines on the right and left sides. Tech support was pretty useless and literally read me the manual verbatim as far as fixing the issue. They also told me this is not covered under warranty, but I already knew that. I was hoping they would have some compassion. Oh, and the people that say there is no humming, they must have bad hearing. It is actually quite loud, but I figure that is the trade off for the better picture over LCD or LED. This blows my 40\" Samsung 120 hz LCD out of the water when it comes to picture quality. The humming only becomes unnoticeable once your volume is turned up to about 18, which is 20% of the max volume. So be warned, despite all the hype that burn in is no longer an issue, I can tell you otherwise. I know they have newer models now, but this was top of the line last year and still had the issue. I would be careful. Just don't watch ANY 4:3 content. I should have told my toddler no cartoons. Or, I could have stretched the image and watched everything out of proportion. It wouldn't make sense to change this setting 2-4 times a day depending on the channel I am watching.NOTE - I tried putting this exact review on Samsung's website (cut and paste), but it was rejected because it did not meet their posting rules.

I must say the thing that has blown me away the most about our new home theater system is this TV. It replaced a 42' Vizio that was only capable of 720p but still gave us 4 or 5 good years, and is still performing well in the upstairs bedroom now. I originaly bought the TV for it's 3D capabilities, and while they are certainly as good as advertised, the star of this show is it's picture quality. Everything we have watched on it looks absolutely unbelievable. From old episodes of 24 on Netflix streaming to the newest movies on Blu-Ray (Avatar/Star Trek, etc). The colors are vibrant, blacks levels are great and the clarity and detail is incredible. As far as the 3D side of things goes, I must say for the most part it is pretty great also.

I bought mine 3 months ago from Amazon & have been extremely satisfied with the deep blacks, accurate colors & incredible detail from this HDTV. The 3-D has been an unexpected, welcome surprise as well.Like many of you I researched & researched & researched to find the best HDTV that fit my budget. We're remodeling our game room & wanted to move our 46\" Sony XBR LCD in there. Since we were very happy with the performance of the Sony my bias was to buy another top notch LCD, only this time go with LED backlighting. Fortunately I took my time making up my mind.I really wanted to stay with Sony, but they seemed to drop the ball with LED. The XBR-8 was great but no longer in production. Their follow-up LED based models weren't as good & they were much more expensive. I looked seriously at Sony, Samsung, LG & Vizio but each had one or more things that kept me from taking the plunge. I just couldn't justify spending major $$$ & accepting one or more flaws. I was somewhat of an early adopter with my Sony XBR, but here in 2010 I expected HDTV's to be clearly superior & more reasonably priced.Yet the reviews by consumers & the pro's seemed to show that even though LCD's had come a long way, they still were far from perfect. Even models costing over $3,000 had flaws I couldn't look past for a TV that should be in my living room for 10+ years.Rather than continuing to pound square pegs into round holes I expanded my parameters. One thing that my favorite product review site [you know it - the round red ball with the name that sounds like sea net] noted time & time again in reviews of LCD's was that plasma HDTV's generally produce deeper blacks, making it easier to get better contrast & better color reproduction. And plasma's pictures are the same from all viewing angles.So I started researching plasmas. I finally narrowed it down to the Panasonic TC-P58VT25 58-inch 3D Ready 1080p VIERA Plasma HDTV & the Samsung PN58C8000 58-Inch 1080p 3D Plasma HDTV (Black).The Panasonic had issues with black-level loss with 2009 models [that is now showing up in the 2010's], so that gave me pause. Also the price point was so much higher for Panasonic TC-P58VT25. Although Sea Net had not yet reviewed the Smasung PN58C8000, they had reviewed the PN58C7000 & gave it very high marks.Right about that time Amazon had great pricing on the Samsung & they offered a free Samsung 3D Starter Kit SSG-P2100T & a free Samsung BD-C6900 1080p 3D Blu-ray Disc Player with a purchase of a Samsung 3-D HDTV. I decided to take the plunge.Amazon's White Glove delivery service was fast & flawless. Once I got the TV set up I used Sea Net's calibration settings for the Samsung PN58C7000 [the PN58C8000 still wasn't reviewed there yet]. The picture was stunning. HD programming was fantastic, SD programming was great & Blu-Ray movies were outstanding.An unexpected benefit was how awesome 3-D programming is. I never factored in 3-D since it's so new so I had very low expectations. All I can say is WOW! Lucky for me it turns out that plasma's outperform LCD's in 3-D capability.When Sea Net reviewed the Samsung PN58C8000 earlier this month I changed my picture settings to the calibration settings from the review for the PN58C8000. WOW!! I thought my picture was excellent before. It's even better now.I am extremely happy with my purchase.

Samsung has really improved the plasma tv quality exceeding the quality over the latest LED/LCD lineup.  There is nothing better on the market today at this price point.  Amazon was wonderful to deal with.  The representatives that I called to help track and expedite the order were immensely helpful.  Both Amazon reps and I had to call the forwarder and carrier multiple times to ensure the e.t.a. was met. But in the end, we got it on time.  The T.V. was connected after the delivery by my friend and very quickly we realized that the T.V. does emit a very discernable high pitch buzzing/hissing sound after power-up.  He put the ferrite cores around the power cord as suggested in manual and it made no difference.  When you have the t.v. on at normal volume levels, you barely hear the noise.  We hope it does not get worse.  But the picture quality is awesome. Blue Ray, Direct TV and 3D sources never looked better. Getting this product from Amazon made so much sense.  The local retailers who offer this product were more expensive and had much longer lead times for delivery.  I had some concern with ordering such an expensive and large item from Amazon.

No television is perfect and this is important to realize as some reviews I have read seem to be searching for television nirvana.  I did isolate a bad pair of glasses (1/6) that would drop sync and Samsung was both fast and efficient in dealing with the issue today.The television is beautiful from its superficial appearance to substantive qualities.  I have compared to the VT25 series and they both have strengths.  To me, the c8000 beats the VT25 in accurate colors and grayscale, proper SD video processing and proper 1080p/24 playback.  These are more important to me than marginally better black levels (after admitted rise by Panasonic).  I place a high weighting on Cnet / D. Katzmaier opinion, review and testing methodology and that is the source for my last statement.The c8000 also adds nice features like a robust online IPTV platform that is always being updated.  Vudu HDX streams are unbelievable that such high quality video can stream seamlessly.  When I test bandwidth with the TV tool, it usually only reports 3-4 Mbps but I have never experienced a hiccup with HDX.  Netflix, on the other hand, often switches between its two best quality streams on HD movies.  Vudu beats Netflix HD hands down.The other interesting feature is 2D to 3D conversion.  It does work and work well to add depth of field.  I have experienced consistent positive results.  I was amazed to discover this feature also works with streaming IPTV content, e.g. Netflix, VUDU.  A nice touch.  It also will output from the TVs optical toslink output 5.1 dolby sound.  Keep in mind, 5.1 sound coming in to the TV through HDMI will not go out the TV optical jack as 5.1.  5.1 only comes from the TV optical output when using rabbit ears ($10 generic set is just as good as $100 amplified HD antennas IMHO.  It works for HD fine if you live in a metropolitan area), or when streaming IPTV like Vudu (Netflix only streams 5.1 from the PS3 platform currently).This is my first plasma and I replaced (moved to basement) a KDS55A3000 SXRD Sony.  The SXRD technology never got a fair shake because of the 12 depth of the cabinet.  At any rate, that TV is still on its original bulb and still beautiful.  This plasma obviously has much better viewing angle and deeper blacks.  The bars on a 2.35:1 film are inky black and actually more so than the 54 inch VT25 I saw at a relatives house playing Avatar.  Now, he does not have 100 hours on the set or has it calibrated yet (to be fair), but I saw some burn in and uneveness on a black screen.  Again, I assume it needs more time, but the VT burn in was obvious after just a couple of minutes which was surprising.  I have not seen even a hint of retention on the C8000 since the first day I turned it on.All in all, a beautiful TV and glad I purchased it.

It wasn't that I wanted a 3D tv, I just needed a new tv and figured I had better get one that is 3D capable.Now, if you are like me and want to get a 3D tv, but aren't sure what to get, let me help you out.  I chose this TV over other LCD tv's for two reasons.  1) I went to several retail stores and watch the Samsung and Sony LED/LCD tv's and was even able to compare this tv side by side with a the Samsung UN55C8000 55-Inch 1080p 240 Hz 3D LED HDTV.  My conclusion was simple, the plasma has better viewing angles and contrast than the LCDs.  Trust me, viewing angle makes a huge difference with the 3D.Now, as for 3D content, I got Monster vs. Aliens and Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs... both look fantastic.  But were I was blown away was when I downloaded WipWout HD on Playstation 3.  The 3D graphics are stunning.  I mean really stunning... it is like nothing you have ever seen before.The best way to describe the 3D effect on this tv (and all active shutter TV's I have seen) it to compare it to looking into a box.  Most of the 3D effect goes deeper inside the TV.  It is kindof like looking out a window and seeing beautiful landscapes stretched out before you or seeing deep space.  Some of the effect pop out of the screen (in the beginning of M vs. A there is a guy playing paddle ball and everyone jumps when he hits the ball out of the screen).As for non-3D content, this is the best TV I have ever owned for watching movies and sports.  The contrast is amazing.  For video games, I still like my Sharp LCD (mostly because of the brightness).  Of course as more 3D games come out, I will probably grow to love this TV even more.All in all, great buy!!!

GORGEOUS picture, menus that are sensible and easy to navigate, lots of useful features.  I shopped around for weeks looking for the right 3D TV, and I'm extremely pleased with my purchase.  When I purchased, I was ultimately deciding between the Panasonic 55\" Viera 3D Plasma TV, and this one.  I also looked at the equivalent LED models, but for heavy motion and 3D, everyone agreed that plasma was the way to go.  They were right =).  I do have some complaints about a few features, but nothing that ever made me wish I'd bought a different TV.  If I went back in time to 2010 & could buy this TV all over again, the only thing I'd do differently is I'd get the 65-inch version of the same TV ;).  Maybe when Samsung comes out with a 90-inch version, I'll upgrade =).Picture----------------PROS: The picture is STUNNING.  Everyone loves to come over & watch my TV because of how bright, crisp & beautiful it is.  I'm not a total videophile, but I did compare dozens of TVs both in store and in reviews, both LED and Plasma -- this was one of the best models in its price range, and in my opinion, it has been worth every penny.CONS: None, really.  Like I said, I'm no videophile, but I haven't found a *single* thing about this TV's picture quality that I didn't like.  You'll definitely want to adjust the picture settings for your room/tastes/ambient light.  Not difficult to do, and Samsung includes several useful presets.  It's worth noting (and everyone seems to agree) that the \"motion judder canceller\" feature is totally useless.  Not a big deal since I just turned it off & haven't thought about it since, but worth noting for those who buy the TV & then wonder why everything feels like it's moving really quickly/oddly on the screen.  Reminds me of the early versions of \"anti-shake\" picture stabilization on video cameras, which used to make me seasick.  Maybe this feature will be improved over time, like it was with video cameras, but until then, turn it off.3D----------------PROS:The 3D is gorgeous!  I just bought \"How to Train Your Dragon\" in 3D and it's *mesmerizing*.  Watching the 2D version afterwards just wasn't the same.  The TV came with 2 pairs of 3D glasses (Samsung SSG-2100AB) and The Complete Shrek Collection in 3D Blu-ray (4 movies).  Shrek Forever After is the only Shrek actually *made* for 3D -- the others were converted afterwards, so the 3D won't be quite as stimulating, but that isn't the TV's fault. Another plus of this model (one of the reasons I bought it instead of the Panasonic) is the built-in 2D->3D conversion.  I didn't expect a lot from this feature, but its actually been somewhat useful.  Definitely works best with newer high-def/Blu-ray movies, especially computer animated ones (Blu-ray 2D Avatar with the TV's 2D->3D conversion was really quite impressive!), but I've even tried it on a few TV episodes off Netflix & it still produced pretty decent results for a software conversion.  You'll never get the same quality as a real 3D source, and some movies work a *lot* better than others, but it's definitely been nice to have this feature, especially with the very limited selection of 3D movies available on disc so far (more on that next).Side note: For anybody wanting a bit of a psychedelic experience, connect your computer to your TV, play some music, and turn on a visualizer (like the iTunes Visualizer) so it appears on your TV.  Then turn on the 2D->3D mode on the TV & watch the visualizer in 3D!! The effect is *really* quite cool.  As with movies, some visualizers work better in 3D than others.CONS:Sadly, even in 2012 you still can't get all the 3D movies on blu-ray without buying specific TV models (thanks a lot, TV manufacturers -- 2 years later & I *still* can't buy Avatar 3D on the open market - WTH???).  It took a year before I could buy \"How to Train Your Dragon\" on 3D (it's still only available through Best Buy).  And of the 3D movies that are released, many of them weren't shot with a 3D camera or designed for 3D, so not every movie will pop out at you like Avatar or How to Train Your Dragon (even in theatres), so that's not the TV's fault.3D Glasses:----------------PROS:The samsung 3D glasses were actually among the more comfortable & lightweight ones out there at the time I bought this TV [...], which makes a *huge* difference.  I tried the Panasonic 3D glasses at the store, and they were so heavy they hurt my head within minutes.  Nobody in my home wears glasses, so I can't speak to how well the standard Samsung 3D glasses fit over regular glasses.CONS:I wish the Samsung lenses were a little \"taller\" -- you can't really tilt your head up/down very much while wearing them.  I bought a pair of the XPand x103 3D glasses, and although they aren't quite as sleek & lightweight as the Samsungs, they work with any 3D TV, and the lenses are a bit taller, which is nice.  **One MAJOR issue with most 3D glasses (not just Samsung's) I've tried is GLARE.**  The glasses have an EXTREMELY glossy finish, which reflects light from almost anywhere in the room.  It's a problem with the passive glasses at theatres as well as most active-shutter home glasses.  The glare results in eye fatigue & a distraction from the movie, which really sucks.  I've heard some people attach electrical tape or black fabric to their glasses to block out light from the sides/top -- it would definitely help.  For now, I turn off every source of light I can find when watching a 3D movie (which also isn't perfect for your eyes -- its better to have a dim, warm light on).  Lastly, having to pay $100 per extra pair of glasses sucked, but nowadays they are half that price, thank goodness.Menus / Ease of Use:----------------PROS:With the explosion of features in modern TV's, including internet connectivity, TV's are a lot more complex to use than they used to be (and they keep getting worse every year).  Despite that fact, I found this TV to be pretty easy to use.  The menus overlay the picture, so you can make adjustments without being forced to completely interrupt what you're watching.  They are easy to read, sensible and straightforward.  Definitely above average for TV menus.CONS:Nothing major.  I kinda wish you could rename the input sources using your own names like \"Roku\", \"AppleTV\", \"XBox\", etc, but it's not a huge deal.Looks/Size:----------------PROS:With the TV having become the anchor of most living rooms, looks are pretty important (especially with a huuuge TV like this).  I'm pleased to say that this TV looks wonderful, whether its on or off.  It's super thin, has a non-distracting & very pretty brushed metal frame with a clear plastic bezel, and the connections on the back are well organized to prevent a tangled mess of cables.  There are basic buttons like power & volume nicely placed in the bottom right corner of the TV bezel, so you're not totally powerless if you accidentally leave the remote in another room.CONS:None, really.  I will say this: 58 inches felt soooooo ridiculously big when I bought the TV (especially since my living room isn't very large), but if you really love movies, especially 3D ones, nothing is ever big enough.  I'm not sure it would have been worth another $500, but I kinda wish I'd bought the 65-inch version =).Inputs/Outputs/Connections:----------------PROS:This TV has gobs of connections: analog, digital, input, output, audio, video, ethernet, etc.  All my devices are digital now, so I only use the digital connections, but many people have expensive analog receivers, so it's great that there are plenty of options here.  I bought an HDMI->MiniDisplayPort/Thunderbolt adaptor that lets me connect my MacBook Pro to the TV (it carries both audio & video if you have a recent model MacBook/Pro), and it works great.CONS:One big complaint here: Why is there no headphone jack on this TV??? I want to be able to watch movies at night without disturbing my roommates/neighbors, and this TV has no headphone jack.  I bought the Samsung Home Theatre in a Box Samsung HT-C6900W Blu-Ray Home Theater System (5.1 receiver w/ 3D blu-ray player), but that *also* doesn't have a headphone jack (grrr...).  The TV does have an 3.5 mm analog audio out I can plug my headphones into, but it is meant for line level out, so there's no way to control the volume! (adjusting the TV volume only affects the volume of the TV speakers).  To work around the issue, I bought a cheap in-line headphone volume control that works (Koss VC20 Volume Control), though I'm considering getting a real headphone amp for best quality sound.  IMO, though, the TV should simply provide a headphone jack.  Also (and this is extremely minor), I can't seem to get the audio return channel over HDMI to work -- despite the fact that both the TV and my Samsung receiver/blu-ray support HDMI 1.4, I still need to use an extra digital audio cable to send sound from the TV (and any devices connected to the TV, like my Roku) to the receiver.  I don't know whether its the TV or the receiver that isn't handling the return audio correctly (the TV definitely has the HDMI port marked with \"ARC\").  Not a big deal to go buy one more cable, but annoying that it doesn't work as advertised.Also, the TV doesn't have built-in wifi, but my Samsung HTIB receiver does, so I haven't really needed the TV's internet connection.  With all the internet connected devices coming into our living rooms, it's annoying that half the devices require separate wifi adaptors.  If you're familiar with basic home networking, I recommend skipping the overpriced wifi adaptors & instead buy a single wireless router/bridge that you can run all your internet connected living room devices through.  It's cheaper, lets you configure all your internet settings in one place, and you can add new devices simply by plugging them in with an ethernet cable (instead of buying additional wireless adaptors for each device that might need them).  If you're not familiar with basic home networking, and don't have a friend who can help, then you might just have to pony up & pay for the adaptor, or move your existing wireless router to your living room (which is what I ended up doing since that's where the cable TV/internet comes in anyway).Remote Control:----------------This might sound silly to some, but I think many people paying over $2000 for a television are pretty picky about our remote controls.  If you can't understand this point of view, try unplugging the mouse from your computer & see how easily you can control the computer using just the keyboard -- most people won't even know where to begin. TV's are a bit less complicated than computers (though they get closer every year), but this will give you some idea of how important it is to have a well-designed remote... at least until we have the computer from Star Trek running our homes.PROS:The remote for this TV is very sleek and pretty, feels sturdy, and has a backlight for seeing the buttons in the dark.  It also integrates with other Samsung devices so I can use most of the buttons on the TV remote to control my HTIB/blu-ray, (and vice versa), which is handy.CONS:2) On this remote, all the buttons are embedded under the smooth surface of the remote, kind of like your microwave's buttons.  This makes it look cool and easy to keep clean (probably a big plus if you have kids or pets), BUT it sucks for tactile use (basically, using the remote without having to look at it).  Because the buttons are all one surface, you can't feel your finger moving from one button to the other, which makes the remote almost unusable without looking at it.  When using most TV remotes, I can adjust the volume/channel without having to look at the remote to find the buttons -- you can just feel the buttons with your finger, and the up/down buttons for volume/channel control are almost always shaped so you can easily recognize them just by touch.  With this remote, despite a slightly-embossed \"+\" and \"-\" emblem on the volume buttons, I almost always have to look at the remote (which, in a dark, late-night watching environment, means I have to press the backlight button first just to see it) and find the buttons before I can press them.  This is even more annoying due to the fact that this remote has a *ton* of buttons -- far too many -- making it confusing to look at and much larger than it needs to be.  The remote that came with my Samsung blu-ray HTIB system has the same layout, but at least it has real/raised buttons, and the volume/channel/play/pause buttons glow in the dark, so you don't have the press an extra backlight button to see them, and they are shaped so you know what button you are pushing without having to look.  This TV remote is so long & has so many buttons that it would probably be easier for users if they mounted the volume controls on the side like cell phones do, and also make the backlight an on/off switch instead of a button that lights the remote briefly & then shuts off again.  This could also be side-mounted so you can find it quickly/easily.  Samsung also has a remote app for my iPhone, but I haven't tried it, since that's just another remote I'd have to press one button to see the screen, enter an unlock code, launch the app (at least once per viewing session), and then of course there's still no tactile feel -- that's a lot of overhead just to adjust the volume.  I wish all remotes were as simple & well-thought-out as my Roku remote, or my old TiVo remote (the original silver one, not the peanut shaped black one).  I'll probably consider investing in a Harmony remote to replace my two Samsung remotes.Audio:----------------I don't use the TV speakers -- all the sound goes to my HTIB receiver, so I can't really comment on the TV audio.Internet TV:----------------I almost never use the built-in internet TV features.  I have a Roku that has a MUCH better interface to Netflix, Amazon (which you can't even get through the Samsung interface) and Pandora music streaming (great for parties/gatherings).  On the TV/HTIB (both have Internet TV capability), I watch an occasional YouTube video, but that's about it.  I did set up an NAS media server via the AllShare (aka DLNA) feature for watching digitized movies and listening to my own MP3s without having to plug in my iPhone/computer.  The interface is a little clunky, and either my NAS or my Samsung won't allow me to rewind/fast forward/skip video, which is INCREDIBLY annoying!! But as long as all I need to do is pause/play, it works very well & looks great.----------------Despite my detailed account of the \"cons\", overall I'm very happy with this TV where it most counts: picture, 3D and ease of use (with some grunts about the remote).  Although the 2011 models are out, most of this review will still apply, but you can get the added benefit of a wider selection of bluetooth 3D glasses instead of IR, which would be nice.

While waiting for the replacement I decided to watch the TV since it was already set up to see what I would be in store for.

They are laggy, run in the foreground and can cause you too have to wait for timeouts (or turn off the unit).  Pandora is a nice to have and the Yahoo bar apps are nicely done but some of the rest are just too slow.  I can get to my laptop and pull up facebook or twitter far faster.  The commitment of the media sharing developers at Sony and other TV manufacturers to UPnP as a standard protocol needs to die.  It actually is impossible to work with.  What is so wrong with allowing Windows or Samba shares to connect?Directv, in the recent software updates, added Media Share capability thru a locked down format by way of UPnP.  When the Samsung attached to the share it doesn't let go, and crushes my HR21-700 with network requests, this causes the interface to be even slower than usual.  I ended up unplugging it from the network to get my performance back.Accessories and Packaging:The remote that comes with a high end TV should just be replaced with a Universal model these days.  Toss in a Harmony One or something similar rather than what they provided.  Who doesn't have to use a Sat / Cable box these days that will require it?  The universals are so good that it doesn't make sense to reinvent the wheel.  At the very least partner and make a version specific for the TV that will support other devices.Selling a $2500 TV that doesn't include at least 1 pair of 3d glasses is a smack in the face too.TV Performance:Colors out of the box are great.  The standard setup is almost perfect but tended to be a little dark for my room.  After some tweaking with settings I am pretty damn happy.  The menus are intuitive and snappy.  Mode changes are great because you can setup different color settings between one input to the next.  Took me a bit to figure out that the PS3 needs to have the TV run in Game Mode.  This is a huge boost in performance.  Very happy with this TV's ability to be both a casual watcher and a gaming / BlueRay watching performer.Audio Performance:I compared it with or without my SurroundBar and it is night and day.  The internal TV speakers are kinda weak, but at under 2 inches thick what can you expect.  Get a Surroundbar at the very least (I have the Polk 6000 IHT) or hook it up to a surround system.  The settings allow you to send all sound to the external speakers which will turn off the volume controls TV.  One annoyance is that you loose the EQ settings and configuration if you send the signal out.  Since I do not have a receiver that can EQ the input this stinks.  For most people who use the internal speaker or have higher end surround systems, they wont have this issue.Overall, love it.  Worth the money?  Still deciding.

Additionally, the 3D features were not a factor in purchasing and have not been used.  Any review from me on 3D would be centered around the need for active glasses which wouldn't really be fair anyway.The picture is almost completely customizable.  To say it is crisp or vibrant or bright may be misleading as everyone enjoys a different picture nuance.  I will say that the black levels are excellent.  Some have mentioned a \"buzz\" with this series, but mine has been thankfully completely exempt from that bug.  To achieve the best picture you have to have some knowledge of the settings on all devices involved or pay for a proper professional install and calibration so be aware.  I was able to handle it based primarily on experience and supplemented by Google.  Black levels are the most likely to suffer from mis-configuration based on the device.  It's simple to fix, but then again so is everything once you know how to fix it.I do not use the speakers, so I cannot comment on their performance.  The physical design of this TV is also outstanding.  The quality is top notch and I love the clean and modern design.  There are control touch-buttons on the lower right on the clear acrylic frame.

There are multiple picture modes which can be set including a Day and Night mode.  Each TV input has its own full picture mode palette.  The image is smooth and natural and demonstrates every reason I prefer plasma.The Yahoo widgets and Internet@TV apps are awesome.  The ability to stream Amazon movies is surprisingly useful.  The $5 credit for registering the TV with Amazon will rent nearly any HD movie to give you a free taste of the quality.  The TV can output the audio via digital optical cable to a receiver capable of surround output for those interested in that.  There have been a couple issues with playback but in every instance, Amazon has contacted me pro-actively to issue a credit the next day.If you're in the market, you can't go wrong with this set.", "Date": "February 22, 2011"}, {"Title": "Excellent Value", "Author": "Richard", "ReviewID": "R2P6XJQWZ7CEPL", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I wanted a 58 inch Samsung plasma TV for a year or so, but decided to wait until the 3D models were available.  I'm glad I did.  The picture quality is great.  I have absolutely no complaints.  I have the sound tied into my audio system so I don't have to rely on the built in speakers which may be a little weak for an audiophile like myself.  The 3D with the Monsters vs. Aliens video is great.  The 3D mode for 2D HD broadcasts is okay, but nothing to rave about.  I can't wait until more 3D programming is available.  Overall, I am totally satisfied with the TV.  It is everything I expected plus more.

I get an aura effect, while they're moving. There's an outline of distortion around a person. This occurs in sports and in normal programs. It's not on everything but happens frequent enough to be annoying. Given that this is a plasma this effect surprised me.2. My receiver is always switching to TV mode instead of HDMI. Which prevents the volume control from working the receiver. I'm not sure who's communicating the handshake incorrectly but I often have to turn on the receiver link, then switch the receiver to HDMI 1, after the TV switch it to TV/VCR.My receiver doesn't allow an HDMI as TV/VCR (go figure)3. The optical out is only in 2.1 sound, not 5.1 sound. Any , music & movies I download via Netfix, Amazon or Hulu+ and HDMI (direct to TV, not through receiver) are only in 2.1 sound not 5.1 as from my cable connection(HDMI).

Young", "ReviewID": "R2BWC4FFUUW5DC", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "For the most part I am in full agreement with the reviews that have been posted. Picture quality is great, Nice clean look, I am not experiencing any noticeable noise/buzz from the tv. Delivery from CEVA was not as smooth as I would have liked, I chose scheduled delivery 12 - 4 PM, I did not receive a call the night before nor the morning of the scheduled delivery. Rather than trust fate, I called CEVA at 9 AM they were surprised that I had not been contacted and did apologize. They then indicated that I would get a call from the driver an hour before the delivery. Being that it was a Friday rather than waiting for a call from the driver, I decided to leave the office a little after noon. It was a good thing that I did, when I arrived at home (around 12:30) the delivery truck was there and the driver indicated that had another five minutes gone by he would have left. Bottom line, you definitely want to be proactive if CEVA is delivering.Delivery issues aside, two other items of note. There are currently no games available from Samsung Apps for the plasma TV model. This is not well advertised, even Samsung Tier 1 and Tier 2 support were unaware of this. It took me a week of calling Samsung before this was disclosed to me. Apparently more focus is being placed on the LCD/LED TV where Samsung Apps is concerned. I've posted my initial chat transcript below for those that are interested.One other, in my opinion, odd limitation is the default behavior of the TV when the Samsung Blu-ray player is turned off if using the Anynet+ feature. Anynet+ is Samsung's implementation of HDMI CEC. This feature is pretty handy, for example when I turn on the Blu-ray player the TV is automatically turned on and the input is automatically change to the HDMI input that the Blu-ray is on. The behavior I don't like is when the Blu-ray player is turned off the input on the TV is switched to the Antenna (TV) input. That may be fine for most folks but it sure would be nice if that default behavior could be changed to automatically switch it to another input such as HDMI1 which is the input I'm using for my CABLE STB. It's not a huge issue I just find it strange that it's hard coded and cannot be changed.Ultimately despite this, I still would have purchased the Plasma TV over the LED TV.info: Please wait for a Samsung Agent to respond.info: You are now chatting with 'Rachael T'Rachael T: Hi, thanks for reaching out to Samsung tech support.

With it on, it is amazing to see fast scenes but in slower scenes (especially with tv/movies) it creates a surreal look that I don't like.  I keep it off 90% of the time and there will be a distortion with really fast moving objects.  This was a big dissapointment for me as I selected a plasma due to the 600hz and figured I would not have this issue.  I think overall it's still a better tv than the new LED's though.  It's much heavier than the LED, though.  There is also a pretty good reflection but I hear the newer LCD/LED's have a reflection as well.", "Date": "August 31, 2010"}, {"Title": "AMAZING!! AMAZING!!

NO BUZZING SOUND!!  ONLY IF I MUTE THE TV I CAN HEAR A LIL SOUND.  SOME REVIEWERS COMPLAIN ABOUT TOO MUCH GRAY (JUST CHANGE HDMI BLACK LEVEL TO LOW ON ADVANCED PICTURE SETTINGS!!!) THIS SET BLOWS KUROS BLACKS AWAY!!!!BUTTOM LINE: PICTURE CANT LOOK ANY BETTER WITH RIGHT PIC SETTINGS AND  HDMI SOURCE: PS3, BLUE RAY, COMCAST HD, ETC.THANK YOU SAMSUNG!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

THEN I WATCHED BOXING ON HBO HD ONDEMMAND WITH 2D TO 3D CONVERSION, I LOVED IT EVEN THOU ITS NOT A POPUP 3D BUT IT FELT VERY NICE, THE AUDIENCE WAS CLEARLY EXTANDED AND I ENJOYED EVERY SECOND OF THE FIGHT! I THINK MOVIES AND AND SPORTS LIKE BOXING WOULD LOOK REALLY NICE ON 3D HD. BTW ESPN3D IS FREE FROM COMCAST AND ITS 1080I NOT 720P AS REGULAR ESPN HD :) AND IT TAKES LESS THEN 5 MINS TO ACTIVATE IT BY CALLING COMCAST. THE PS3 HAS A NEW UPDATE 3.30 AND THERE IS AN OPTION ON THE VIDEO OUTPUT UNDER SETTINGS TO ENABLE 3D OUTPUT FOR TV IN USE ONLY IF YOU DO IT THROU MANUAL OPTION AND YOU HAVE TO SPECIFY TV SCREEN SIZE (MINE SHOWED 58 INCH BY DEFAULT) BUT THERE IS NO 3D GAMES AS OF NOW YET :( ONE THING I AM WORRIED ABOUT IS THAT THE SCREEN BURN PROTECTION IS GREYED OUT WHEN WATCHING 3D, BECAUSE 3D ONLY AVAIL ON SCREEN FIT, NOT 16:9 AND YOU CANT ACTIVATE PIXEL SHIFT.
