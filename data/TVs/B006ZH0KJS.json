{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Beautiful TV with a cool remote", "Author": "Gkcmilner", "ReviewID": "R3QN1VNLIRQRMI", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I have been using my TV for about 4-days now.  I know Amazon has a separate shipping/packaging review area so I won't let what happened reflect on this rating, but I do want to mention that the TV was shipped in the store box with no additional packaging or protection. The first TV arrived with a cracked screen, but Amazon overnighted another TV (packed the same way) and it arrived OK.I bought this TV based on my experience testing one at a local electronics store. I was really impressed with the 3D quality using passive glasses which was a requirement for me (I did not want active shutter); I also really liked the remote. I found it super easy to type in the search fields and to make on-screen selections. It's very accurate and easy to use. And since the TV also has an IR receiver I was also able to add the TV to my Logitech Harmony 880 remote as well.It has taken some time learning how to use all the TV features correctly because the owner's manual is weak, which is probably my biggest complaint. It took me a while to figure out what all the 3D setup options were and what all the selections were for. The on-screen interface is very cool and super easy to navigate; especially with the magic remote. The only thing lacking that I wish it had is Pandora radio. There must be some legal reason because when I use the TVs web browser and go to Pandora.com there is no audio. IN LG SmartTV there are a lot of free apps, including some cool 3D programing.Picture quality is great with plenty of brightness. I was impressed that it was to my liking right out of the box. There is a short setup process when you first turn it on that lets you turn the energy saving feature on/off (I chose off) and if the TV is in a store/home (I chose home). It has no more or less light bleeding than any other LED TV I sampled, and has no light leakage. My Samsung had a more even backlighting, but that is only noticeable when it's a black screen; and seems to be a problem with a lot of LED TVs (all the ones I looked at anyway. One thing I would like to point out is that I seem to get the best 3D experience when the room is completely dark. I normally watch TV with a soft light behind the TV, but I now turn it off when I'm watching 3D. Glare also really impacts the 3D quality.To top all of this off, the TV is one of the most beautiful sets on the market. I replaced a 40\" Samsung LCD, and I was worried that this 47\" might be too big in the same space; but because it is almost frameless it is only 1\" wider (the Samsung had a distracting thick, high gloss frame). It has a sleek modern design with brushed metal accents. The stand is a very heavy plastic with a matching brushed metal finish.All-in-all I am extremely pleased with my purchase. I feel I got a great price and I love the package deal from Amazon that included LG AG-F216 Cinema 3D Glasses Family Pack (6-Pairs) for 2011 LG 3D LED-LCD HDTVs and the LG NB3520A 300W Sound Bar with Wireless Subwoofer.***UPDATE***After using it a bit more I wanted to add a couple things:The light bleeding I mentioned earlier is only noticible on the initial startup splash screen where the LG logo is on a black background. Once the TV warms up there is almost no noticable light bleed on dark scenes. I am very happy with this.When watching a movie from a flash drive, the play, pause, forward, rewind, buttons on my Harmony remote don't do anything. I have to use the magic remote.We watched the Immortals in 3D and the effects were nothing short of amazing. We are so happy with this TV.***UPDATE 2***If internet access and Apps are important to you, you might be disappointed. To me the LG Smart TV Apps are pretty much worthless. I like Netflix, Amazon VOD, Pandora Radio, iHeart Radio, and Slacker Radio. The only one that this TV has is Netflix (it does work well). The TV has a decent web browser, but when I go to any of the radio websites they block the sound. Navigating Amazon Prime VOD is just a terrible experience and not worth the effort. I will be connecting my Logitech Review back to the TV. Bottom-line: Great hardware, disappointing web connectivity.If this were a 10-star rating system I'd give the TV an 8.5The 3D really impresses.", "Date": "March 21, 2012"}, {"Title": "Smart, and Easy to Use", "Author": "Rex Kullmann", "ReviewID": "R1XMP47ISSBN84", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This handsome TV features a thin bezel and modern look, ease of use with attractive menus and very good picture quality.Set UpLike all other flat panel TVs, once you unbox the set, you'll need to assemble and attach the stand.  LG's stand seems a little flimsy.  There's some give when you touch the TV and the manual gives specific instructions on where you should grab the TV when you pivot it on the stand.  I've had no problems, but a more substantial feel would be comforting.When you first turn on the TV, it takes you through a few easy steps to set it up.  Pairing with the remote, joining your wi-fi network, choosing your energy saving preferences and the like.  My TV also found a software update once it was connected to my wi-fi and prompted me to upgrade.  Easy.Performance and The FlawI'm a TV production veteran of many years.  I'm really picky about picture quality in some respects, but don't care a bit about some of the things some TV reviewers seem obsessed about.  What you can see with test signals isn't very important.  What matters, in my humble opinion, is what you are seeing when you sit down to watch.  Are you watching the movie or watching how your TV performs?  The LG's picture quality is very good, but there's one Flaw that takes me out of the moment and makes me pay attention to the TV.The LG 6700 uses LED edge lighting.  It results in splotchy light leaks around the perimeter of the screen.  The Flaw is visible during dark scenes and in a darkened viewing room.  How bad is it?  It's invisible 99% of the time, but when the movie ends and the credits come up, there's those glowing globs around the edges.  When the hero goes into the haunted house with a flashlight, there's those ghosts all around him.  Turning on the Energy Saver feature, which reduces the backlight when the room is dark, lessens The Flaw somewhat.It's pretty easy to overlook The Flaw since the LG has a great picture otherwise.  Good, well saturated color, plenty of contrast and good brightness.  3D performance is stunning.  If you want to change something, you'll find every adjustment you can think of in the settings menu.  So overall, I rate the LG's picture very good despite The Flaw.This LG is one of the many new TVs that use glossy screens.  Glossy screens give a more vivid and colorful picture than non-glossy screens, but at a cost.  They are much more reflective.  Is a glossy screen for you?  Pretend your TV screen is a mirror.  If you're sitting on your sofa looking at that mirror, would you see a strong light source, like an unshaded lamp or a window?  If so, you'll prefer a TV with a non-glossy screen.This LG's audio performance is mediocre.  There is an EQ built-in the settings menu, but using it to boost the bass makes little difference.  The speakers just can't reproduce it.  While the audio is fine for dialog, I think LG assumes you'll use a sound system if you care about fidelity.3DThe LG uses passive 3D glasses.  They produce a good 3D viewing experience and have an advantage over active shutter glasses in that they are much cheaper to buy, don't use batteries, and are universal among brands.  Next time you see a Real D 3D movie in the theatre, hang on to your glasses.  They work fine with this TV.  You get 6 pair of 3D glasses with this LG.  Your local Best Buy carries additional glasses from LG and Real D including kid sizes and clip-ons and high-priced premium stylish ones.Here's the part of the review where I expected to dismiss the 2D to 3D feature.  The LG, like many new BluRay players, will synthesize 3D from regular 2D content.  Darned if it doesn't work pretty well.  It's not as good as real 3D, of course, and you probably won't use it that much.  (Are you going to start watching CNN in 3D every night?)  But for a few choice programs, it's surprisingly good.There's a button on the remote that toggles 3D on and off with one button press.  All in all, LG has done everything possible to make 3D simple to enjoy with a minimum of fuss.  Push the 3D button, put on the glasses and eat your popcorn.Smart TVThis TV has apps, just like your smart phone.  There is no longer a menu where you adjust picture and sound settings.  There's an app that does that.  There are apps to switch inputs, search for available video you can download, browse the internet, turn 3D on and off, display media from your smart phone or computer, display the user's manual and on and on.  21 apps come preloaded on the LG, and you can download more.  Most of those are gateways to other content, including a lot of children's programming.  Most are free.You can get to the apps you've installed through the My Apps menu, or through the home screen which also has a \"Premium\" menu where you'll find Netflix, Hulu, Vudu, YouTube, Facebook, Twitter and more.  The \"3D World\" menu has a number of streamable 3D programs.  Most menu screens keep the program you were watching when you entered the home screen boxed in the upper left corner.  You can select it to close the menu and return to your program.LG's operating system seems rock solid, but some of the apps are buggy.  The internet browser, for instance, seems impressive at first with tabbed browsing and flash installed.  But some websites will lock it up, even to the point where it's difficult to make the browser quit.  And while flash is present, using it will bring a warning that you're using an old version and it won't be supported for long.  Another app, AccuWeather, gave me a face full of error messages when I tried to add Fort Lauderdale to my favorite cities.Still, LG has sent out at least one update since my set was built, so there's reason to believe the bugs will get squished eventually.Media Link allows you--theoretically--to view your computer's media files on the LG's screen.  It requires a third party app, Plex, to be installed on your computer.  I have a MacBook, and the Apple version of Plex crashed immediately when I launched it.  No Media Link for me!The RemoteLG has gone its own way with the remote control.  Instead of a wand with a zillion buttons, you get a wand with a few buttons that works like a Wii controller.  You wave it in the air to move a cursor on the screen.  It's clever, but I have gripes.First of all, the buttons are mostly surfaces flush with the face of the remote.  Also, there is no light or glow-in-the-dark lettering on the remote, so when it's dark, you're left to fumble about on a seemingly featureless wand.  I don't know how many times I've moved the cursor over the icon I want, then pressed the button only to have the muting come on.  That's the button directly below the select button.While you're waving the remote around, it stays on.  When you're still for a few seconds, the remote turns off.  So if you're perusing the menus and pause to read something, the cursor will disappear and you'll have to shake the remote to get it back.  When this happens over and over, it gets annoying.  Also, if you take a swig of your drink, then bump the remote when you put down your glass, a big red cursor pops up on the screen to spoil the mood your movie was trying to build.While I struggle with this remote, everyone else in my household like it.  Pointing at icons on a big screen is much better for them than searching for the right button on a crowded remote.  Ordinarily, I put the original remote away and just use my universal remote.  Not this time.  Everyone but me wants the LG remote.  It stays on the coffee table.  But I'm not out of luck.Even though the LG remote is an RF remote, the TV accepts IR signals, so my universal remote will work with it.  Well, up to a point.  I can navigate using arrow keys, but there is no button to call up the \"home\" or \"My Apps\" menu.  The upshot is that I'll be able to do all the non-smart functions with the universal remote, but apps and on-line content will require the LG remote.The Bottom LineThe LG is a smart, easy-to-use TV with a lot of really cool features.  Picture quality is very good and highly adjustable.  Plus it's a handsome piece of hardware with its thin frame and nearly all-glass face.  Yes, I have a few gripes, but there were plenty of cool surprises to offset them.

This TV is light, good quality picture, Passive 3D (big for me), and has no noticeable delay when gaming.Some problems, to get the PQ so good, they went with a glossy screen (seems to be somewhat the norm now) and this causes some reflections, but nothing too bad.The remote took some getting used to, but I have a universal remote if I just need to switch inputs. The remote it comes with is great in my opinion for navigating the menus and store, etc. It does a good job.One minor annoyance, if you move the remote a bit (move the table it's on, drop it, knock it off the couch, etc) it makes the cursor appear for a few seconds.  This happened when watching netflix, but nothing too bad.The reason I gave it 4 stars is the netflix and hulu apps work well, but have this weird glitch that would happen every 5 minutes where it looks like it just panics and shows a lot of random cached pixels. I'm hoping this is a software issue that can be fixed.", "Date": "March 6, 2012"}, {"Title": "Great TV but let me tell you about Amazon's TV \"Price Match\" and \"Enhanced Delivery\"", "Author": "SmartConsumer", "ReviewID": "R1ZGVOHVAGRO3U", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Let me say that the actual tv, itself, is FANTASTIC. The picture is crystal clear, it is thin as a razor, and it's by far the best 3d technology on the market.That being said, let me tell you about Amazon's \"services\" on their TV price match and enhanced delivery.First the price match. I bought this tv new for $1,499.00 on Amazon (from Amazon) with free shipping. Because the tv qualified for Amazon's \"price match\", I checked out one of their qualified competitors and saw that it was $1,449.00 with free shipping (there's a list of websites and they will only match if the price comes from one of those websites). So I was excited to call up Amazon and get a $50 refund, right? Seemed pretty straight forward.Well, it turns out that Amazon adds this phantom $50 charge to their competitors' prices in their \"price match\" because of their \"enhanced delivery\" (I'll get to the delivery part in a second). That's right, even though the shipping was FREE on Amazon, they tacked on that 50 bucks and called it a service, claiming since they (Amazon) were going to come in my house and plug up the tv to ensure it works (this is the enhanced delivery as opposed to just standard delivery where they drop it on my doorstep) that they were going to add the extra money to make it \"comparable\".I tried to explain that the price differential was $50 and that shipping was directly comparable, but they argued back with me for close to half an hour. I argued this was a \"price match\" and not a \"price + service\" match and that at no point had Amazon ever informed me that I was paying $50 for a guy to plug my tv in (who would willingly do that as a consumer?!). They claimed it was built into the price ($1,449). I told them I was misled as a consumer, believing that I was merely paying for the product itself ($1,449) and was receiving free shipping. I tried to explain to them further that I was not getting that service from the competitor - nor did I want it - yet another reason not to factor it in. They told me that I was still getting it from Amazon, so when I tried to deny the service and opt for standard shipping (I might add I didn't ask for a $50 discount from Amazon for the downgrade in shipping), they told me that it was not an option and I *had* to pay for the enhanced delivery...Now on to the delivery itself. I finally realized that I wasn't going to win with Amazon so I waited for my order. The shipper told me that I needed to be at home between 3pm and 7pm for the delivery. So I took off of work early and got home at promptly 3pm. About 6:30, the shipper called me and stated that my tv never \"made it on the truck\" and that they wanted to come back the same time the next day. They said they were really sorry and that I would be the first order delivered so I wouldn't have to wait so long. So I took off work early AGAIN to wait on the delivery. Long story short, they did not show up until 7:15pm. When they did finally show up, it wasn't a \"they\", it was a \"he\". And I had to help \"him\" haul in my own tv from his truck, up my driveway, up my stairs, and into my house because, well, one man can't realistically carry a 55 inch tv by himself.After helping the man carry my order in (what if I had been a petite woman or an elderly man? How would this guy get it in himself? He had no dolly!!!!), he started asking me to sign. I looked at him in disbelief saying that this was \"enhanced delivery\" that I apparently paid $50 for and left work early 2 days in a row for! Get the tv out of the box like you're supposed to, plug it in like you're supposed to, hook up the cable to make sure it works like you're supposed to, test at least 1 hdmi outlet like you're supposed to, and clean up the mess and haul away the trash like you're supposed to! These were all things Amazon told me he would do and were even on his checklist that I had to sign at the end. However, he said Amazon had noted that he was to simply come in and plug it up to make sure it turns on! Amazing! Who would pay $50 to have their tv carried an extra 10 feet inside the door and have it plugged up just to see if the electricity works?! \"Oh yes, I see a bunch of snow on the tv - it appears to work great! That'll do. Thanks\".Anyway, sorry for the rant, but my experience with Amazon has been AWFUL. Just a word to the wise - beware the enhanced delivery and price match guarantee. It sounds good on the outside, but when it comes down to it, THE TV THAT YOU WANT TO PRICE MATCH MUST BE AT LEAST $50.00 CHEAPER FOR YOU TO GET REFUNDED A SINGLE PENNY!!!!!!! Also, make sure you get your money's worth from your \"enhanced delivery\" that you're secretly paying an extra $50 for!!! Make Amazon give you the EXACT details IN WRITING of what you'll get with that service!", "Date": "June 1, 2012"}, {"Title": "Beautiful Design, Great Picture and Sound", "Author": "skypros", "ReviewID": "R147IZ7EB38K92", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This has to be one of the most beautiful TV's out there! The silver band arround the TV along with the silver \"bow\" style base and almost no bezel make for a very stunning look.The picture (once calibrated) is really good and the sound is the best of any flat screen TV that I have owned.I have a Yamaha YSP-101 (aka ATS-1010) Sound Bar that makes my Movie watching 100% better....

It really is a stunning television that looks amazing on or off. It's an efficient design, also - even after several hours of 3D use, it barely even warms up and certainly doesn't get hot.Cons: Some people won't like the remote, but you program a Logitech Harmony or another universal remote easily enough. WiFi antenna seems weak, but that's not a big deal if you can use ethernet. Included (via LG app) 3D demo content is pretty terrible - don't judge the 3D until you watch a decent 3D blu ray (not a post-conversion!) like Legends of the Guardians, an IMAX film, Tron (my favorite 3D demo), etc. I can't speak for the sound (I use an external 5.1 setup) but I'm sure it's terrible - that's just the way it is with slim televisions. If you're unhappy with it but don't want to spend much money, buy a $100 soundbar like one of Vizio's. If you're dropping $2k on video, be prepared to spend at least a little money on audio. Even a cheap soundbar (from a name brand!) will drastically increase the quality of your home theater experience. Not a lot else to complain about... LG has done a great job with their 2012 line and it still surprises me that I now own an LG set and didn't stick with Samsung or Vizio.Other thoughts: I am using the \"Cinema\" color preset until more people own this TV and can give some input on how they set theirs up. I'll also be using Disney's World of Wonder blu ray to calibrate this a little better myself this weekend. But for the last week, I'v been pleased with the preset. I should also point out that the 120hz \"true motion\" tech isn't bothersome from LG. With my last Vizio set (a \"240hz\" but really 120hz 2D tv) it was awful and I turned it off immediately.Like others have notes, the bezel is really 5mm (when tv is on) and 2mm (when tv is off - nearly edge-to-edge glass) but it's still incredibly small and will blow people away.One last note! I have this TV on a stand designed to hold a 47\" display. Since the bezel is so small and the TV is LED (and therefore very lightweight), the total width of the TV is 48.5\" and my stand is exactly 48\" wide. It looks like a perfect fit and really emphasizes how huge a 55\" TV is, in an average living room. If you are shopping for a stand to go with this new TV, don't worry about what size the stand was designed for - they are made to accommodate heavier non-LED televisions, so as long as the stand is about 48\" wide, you can use it!EDIT! :: It's been two weeks since I wrote my review and my opinion hasn't wavered. I would make the same purchase again, even skipping the next model up (240hz, dual core processor) in favor of this one. I have calibrated the set to my liking and have shown it off with several 3D blu rays to friends (Hugo, Tron, Legend of the Guardians) and they've all been very impressed. The 3D is fantastic, but make no mistake - using this set for primarily 2D content will not leave you dissatisfied. I've also used it quite a bit for gaming (Xbox, PS3[with and without 3D], and PC games through Steam) and there is no noticeable blur or ghosting whatsoever.

I also have a 60\" LG plasma in another room.Pros:* BEZEL: The slim bezel is nice. I was able to replace my old 50\" plasma with this 55\" model using about the same amount of wall space, thanks to the thin bezel.* POWER & HEAT: The power consumption and heat generation is superior to my old plasma. Nice... especially in Texas where you don't want more heat.* SLIM & LIGHTWEIGHT: Very slim TV - nice... and less weight too* SMART UPDATES: Can update itself using an Internet connection (I'm using a wired connection)* FULL HD (1920x1080) beats my old plasma* OPTIONS & SETTINGS: Lots of configuration options & settings to tweak (if you want); the \"Picture Wizard\" is a good place to start to adjust some basic (& important) settings.* 3D GLASSES: Six pairs of 3D glasses is a nice little bonus (but all adult sizes - no \"small kid\" 3D glasses).* 24 FPS PLAYBACK: Can play back 24 FPS film material correctly.Cons:* VIEWING ANGLES: The screen viewing angles and \"stability\" (changes with viewing angles) are noticeably reduced from my old plasma TV (but are supposed to be \"good for LCD\").* MAGIC REMOTE: The \"magic remote\" could use some improvement, though it's not all bad. Unfortunately it can fall over a lot, and the cursor can disappear for seemingly no reason.* NETFLIX APP: My wife tried the Netflix app, but likes the TiVoHD Netflix interface better - especially for pausing/playing & controlling the stream... but she is very picky. I think it's decent (especially if you don't plan on pausing the stream), though definitely not the best I've used.* GLARE: Compared to the plasma I had, the 55LM6700 screen has more glare and the screen is glossy; windows or bright lights in front of the TV could be an issue, but I've seen worse. I now see how I've taken for granted the good anti-glare screen of my old plasma. You may be better off with a matte screen. This is one of my biggest dislikes of this unit.* WEB BROWSER: Too slow to be useful.Other:* IMAGE QUALITY: It was harder to beat the image quality of the plasma than I thought... while the image quality is good to very good (especially when well adjusted), I think you have to go plasma if you want the very best. Tweaking the settings can get you closer though (but you won't be able to match the viewing angles of a plasma).* MAGIC REMOTE: The \"magic remote\" is both \"cool\" and annoying at the same time. Sometimes it has a bit of a fit and doesn't do what you want... and it can fall over a lot.* 3D: I just tried some demos accessible from the TV's features and the 3D was impressive (but the resolution was not because unfortunately they were not HD demos but maybe there are some there or they will add some HD demos later).* TWEAKING: If you want to tweak/calibrate, then the \"Disney WOW: World of Wonder [Blu-ray]\" is good. I'm still messing with the settings but think I'm getting closer to some that I like simply by using the included \"Picture Wizard II\" option in the menu.* I ordered my TV early May, 2012 and the unit I received was made in Feb, 2012.* Assembled in MexicoConclusion:If you want the best/excellent image quality and viewing angles, then I recommend a good plasma. For slimness, energy efficiency, and still good to very good picture quality, then this is a nice set if the glare from the glossy screen won't be a problem for you. I feel comfortable giving it 4 stars. If this had all the benefits of good plasma image quality, then I'd give it 5 stars.I will update this review as I use the TV more and find more pros/cons.", "Date": "May 5, 2012"}, {"Title": "Extremely Satisfied with this TV...

This won't be my last and only 3D TV for sure but I think I will be hanging on to this one for a while...The first thing that attracted me to this TV is due to a visit to my local BESTBUY store, It was sleek, the almost no bezel feature is very sexy.  Before I saw this TV, I thought my first 3D tv would be one of the SAMSUNG SMARTTV with the built in camera, but at 3500 a pop, I thought I'd be waiting longer.OK on the the good things about this TV.Passive 3D technology - This TV came with 6 pairs of 3D glasses, that's a big plus because I planned on showing my new TV off to family and friends. Not very long after delivery and installation, all glasses are on everybody's eyes and jaws dropped at how stunning the pictures are, even with 1080i highest resolution our dish provider has to offer. This technology also saved me another few hundred bucks from having to buy matching Active 3d glasses in the case of having a Samsung or Sony 3D TV. Expect me to spend those few hundred bucks on a pair of OAKLEY 3D spectacles for some added style :). Oh, and I am keeping those free 3D glasses the next time I go to see a 3D movie in the theaters.2d to 3d conversion - This is an awesome feature... I don't see this getting any better in the future...I mean, it literally eliminates the need to buy 3D blu ray movies. Regular programming on any channel is converted to 3D instantly and I don't know if I'm bugging but the picture quality are actually better when they are converted 3D than 2D... Excellent feature. I literally have my 3D glasses on all the time when I'm in front of my LG and almost walked out the house wearing them (no kidding). Even my PS3 games and XBOX 360 games are converted, while I don't really plan on playing games on 3D, the cutscenes are just simply amazing.Magic Remote - Do not listen to the bad review about the remote ,it is an awesome remote.... even more responsive than a Wii remote if you ask me... You'll love it. One simple button for 2D to 3D conversion. No button for input selection but I found out that if you move the wheel one notch down (or up) it asks you if you would like to show the input selection screen which is a very helpful feature. I also love that it is a simple remote, not a lot of buttons on them, I mean who really uses TV remotes these days, everyone has either a learning remote or their cable remotes to use.Smart Content - too many, I'm not done playing and exploring them... not all of them useful, but hey I'm not complaining.Free 3D content - when connected to a wifi or an ethernet cable to access the internet, this TV came with a handful of 3D content for you to enjoy instantly, so you really don't have to rush to your local video store to buy a 3D movie and waste another 35 bucks for a movie.TV Features - are endless, I don't think there is anything this TV won't do. A TV is a TV, I have a computer to Skype or Facebook so I don't know what Samsung was thinking, I have a PS3 and an Xbox connected to this TV so streaming downloaded movies to this TV is a breeze.  The USB ports are also very useful for putting movies on a USB stick. I haven't been very successful playing MKV files on this TV directly, but streaming it through my Xbox or PS3 fixed that problem.Speakers - If you went this far buying this awesome TV, you must already have a stereo system in place to compliment your home theater and if you didn't yet, you'd be a fool not to buy at least a sound bar for it. Even if you only plan to use this in a bedroom. The sound is sufficient.120HZ - ok so you've seen other TVs advertising 600Hz for Plasmas and an extra few hundred bucks for a 240Hz LED higher model. I do not have bionic eyes to even tell the difference to be honest. And with what I am currently seeing and after seeing movies after shows after movies on this TV, I'd say save those few extra bucks, stick to this one and invest on a sound bar instead.The BAD - Absolutely NOTHING...My next 3D TV - Another one of this but bigger,  now I know that it is worth my money to buy another LG, but bigger.Amazon lists this TV (at the time I bought it) at 1799 plus tax with free white glove delivery and 24 months no interest financing on my Amazon CC, This morning I found it elsewhere for 1467, no tax and free freight delivery, luckily the site that had this TV listed for the lower price is one of the sites that Amazon accepts for their TV low price guarantee offer, called Amazon right away and after about 3 calls, 2 hours on the phone, 5 representatives and a supervisor later, I finally got the amount difference refunded back to my CC. I will definitely recommend this TV to ANYONE and EVERYONE... Once you have this TV, you will be enjoying it for months , or years to come...What are you waiting for... This is the Cheapest 3D TV out there for its quality, style and features. You will not go wrong, If I didn't already have 55 inch screens on every room in my house, I'd buy another one of these babies.I hope this review helps... Happy 3D watching :)", "Date": "May 13, 2012"}, {"Title": "LG's Lemon", "Author": "Over The Rainbow \"Whyrens\"", "ReviewID": "R2KW7JGEJ9RHYN", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I purchased an LG LCD/LED flat-screen television in January 2012. In late June or early July the television stopped turning on. I contacted LG and a service contractor was dispatched to repair the television. It was approximately a week between when the television broke and I contacted LG and when it was repaired.During the week of October 1st through October 5th the television broke again (the brightness level began flickering and an intermittent blue bar, approximately 1/5th the width of the screen, appeared vertically down the side of the screen and I do not recall exactly which day the problem started). I again contacted LG and again a service contractor was dispatched to repair the television. The service technicians arrived on October 10th, at approximately 1pm, and again repaired the television.Shortly after they left I found that the television would go blank after it had been on for a while. The length for which the picture would remain on varied, but it seemed to last longer if the television had been turned off for a while. The blue light in the lower right-hand corner remained on (it didn't turn to red) so the television was on, but there was no picture or sound. I called the service contractor who stated they would need to order a part (the contractor returned and tried to fix it with what they have but the problem remained). I then contacted LG to report the problem in order to make sure it was documented and to find out exactly how many times I would have to go through this before LG would admit they sold me a defective television and send me a new one.I found my experience dealing with LG's customer service to be extremely frustrating. The representative who I initially spoke with, Mary, was unable to assist me so I asked to speak with a supervisor. The supervisor I spoke with, whose name I cannot recall, seemed to be determined to do anything except assist me. I asked her how long this was going to go on, how many times I was going to have to go through the aggravation and inconvenience of having my television broken before LG would take responsibility for the lemon it sold me. The supervisor seemed determined to place the blame on anyone except LG (me, the service contractor, the retailer, Amazon), anyone except the company who actually manufactured the defective product. She kept insisting (in a deliberately obtuse manner) that she \"cannot predict the future.\" I wasn't asking her to predict the future, I was asking her how much aggravation and inconvenience I would have to go through before LG would provide me with the product I paid for: a functioning television.Since the first supervisor seemed to be deliberately refusing to assist me, I hung up and waited a couple of hours so that I would not be furious when I tried again. Once I had calmed down I called back to LG's customer service phone number and asked to speak with a supervisor. I spoke with Candace who was just as unhelpful as the first supervisor I spoke with. I asked Candace to have the part that the service contractor needed shipped overnight, so that they would be able to return and fix my television the next day, October 11th. Candace refused and again attempted to shift responsibility for rectifying this problem to anyone other than her. She stated that shipping was between the service contractor and the parts department, and when I asked her to contact either or both to ensure that the part would be here the next day she refused. I asked her to connect me with the parts department, so that I could speak with them about having the part shipped overnight, and again she refused. She informed me that the parts department does not converse with anyone as unimportant as the consumer.I then wrote a letter to LG explaining the situation and how upset and frustrated I am by it.  In response they sent me several \"canned,\" form-letter type responses that did not help, in any way, in resolving the problem. I called the service contractor on the Monday following the most recent breakdown, October 15th, to see if they had even received the part and they had not. They contacted LG's parts department and were informed that the part had been shipped \"recently\" and did not have a tracking number. Since they ordered the part on the previous Wednesday I do not know why it would only have been shipped \"recently\" on Monday, six days later.I continued to write to LG, requesting that my letter be forwarded to someone in a position of authority, and was continually assured by the customer service team that no one in authority is interested in resolving this problem, so they would not bother them with my letter.  I was, after a week of back and forth correspondence, eventually offered a 3 month extension of my warranty.  When I responded that, at the very least, considering all of the time I have spent and inconvenience I have been put to as the result of their having sold a defective product (and the fact that I no longer have any faith, what-so-ever, that this lemon will continue working for more than a few months at a time) I would like them to extend my warranty for a full year I was told that they couldn't possibly extend my warranty by a year because they don't offer extended warranties.  So they can extend the warranty by three months, even though they don't offer extended warranties, but not by a year, interesting.A couple of days after receiving the offer of a three month extended warranty, and the assurance that Amber C was the absolute highest authority I would be allowed to speak with, I received an email from Stacey Casals, Manager /Executive Services /CAG, who offered me a six month extension on my warranty.  I wrote back to her explaining in detail why this is not acceptable.  I no longer have any faith in LG's product, what-so-ever, and I have put hours and hours into dealing with a television which seems to refuse to function for more than a few months at a time. Every time it breaks I have to take the time to call LG customer service and report the issue, wait for them to contact the service contractor who I then exchange several phone calls with, and then take time to be in my home when the service contractor comes to fix the television and wait for them to finish before I leave.Frankly it's all a massive inconvenience and it's only been kept from being more of one because I work a non-standard schedule. If I worked a normal 8am-5pm schedule I would have had to take time off from work every time the service contractor came to fix my television. As it is, I work a graveyard schedule so I am not working, I am sleeping, when they call and when they are available to come fix my television. Which means that my sleep schedule is interrupted, and anyone who has ever worked a graveyard schedule knows how difficult it is to get enough sleep under the best of circumstances.As far as I am concerned, the television should have been written off as a lemon after the third malfunction and replaced. As I stated before, I no longer have any faith in this product and I anticipate having to replace it not long after the warranty expires. I do not believe it is unreasonable to expect that a new television last, at the minimum, two years so I do not believe my request for a full year extension of my warranty is unreasonable; especially since as far as I am concerned it should have already been replaced as defective.After writing the above response to Ms. Casals she ignored the issue for a little over a week and then wrote back to me, in a rather dismissive manner, stating that she was sorry I am not satisfied and hopes that I will reconsider.  This is was not acceptable so I filed a complaint with the BBB.After delaying for over a week LG responded to my complaint stating that all electronics \"require service\" and are subject to \"occasional failure.\"  I responded by pointing out that three malfunctions in as many months for a television that is not even a year old is far beyond an \"occasional failure,\" that it is, in fact, a lemon.  LG responded to that by claiming that my television has not failed three times, they claim it has only failed twice (as though that would be acceptable for a television that is less than a year old), which is apparently their way of avoiding having to take any responsibility for their defective product.  Apparently to LG two malfunctions that happen one right after the other are only one malfunction, even though they were two separate problems requiring two different parts to be replaced, and they expect me to accept that three now equals two.Uh, no.  In the normal world, three does not equal two and up is not down.  My television broke three times, I should know since I had to deal with the hassle, and has had to be repaired three times.  LG's creative math does not change the fact that this television is a lemon and should have been replaced and it does not make their actions any more acceptable.I am now stuck with a lemon of a television that I expect to start throwing sparks or performing some other interesting trick at any time, and which LG refuses to replace.  All-in-all, LG's response to this matter has been terrible. I strongly urge anyone planning on purchasing any electronics in the near future to avoid LG products at all costs. The frustration you will experience and the time you will spend trying to get your product to work will not be worth it in the long run, I can tell you this from personal experience. LG's complete and total refusal to accept responsibility for their products is maddening.", "Date": "October 19, 2012"}, {"Title": "Great TV backed by an expert review.

I upgraded from a LCD 47 inch and did all the research before purchasing this tv. The 55 is a great size for 3d viewing. I really didn't think I was going to be one of those who got \"sucked in\" to the 3d hype. This tv made me a believer. We even host 3d movie nights now and all of our family and guest really complement the picture and experience. To get the full experience you will need to buy external speakers with a sub-woofer which I already had at the time. Makes all the difference when watching movies. At about $25 per pair for 3d glasses it was a nice complement to get 6 of them right off the bat. If your into playing games the \"Dual Play\" feature is a very neat technology. Just search youtube and watch a video explaining what it does(would take too long to explain). The tv can turn anything type of programming into 3d. Watching sports is a lot of fun in 3d but you really need to have HD cable/dish to enjoy the picture. Watching standard blu-rays in converted 3d(not actual 3d movie) gives the movies a special \"oomph!\" Really makes watching old movies a different experience. The wife even got me to watch \"Wizard of Oz\" with her. Particularly didn't care for that movie for a long time. It was quite enjoyable in converted 3d. If you go through the reviews most of the negatives will be those who got a broken or defective tv. I would disregard them. This tv will not disappoint.

Good deal I think.I'm not a crazy techie, but here are my amateur thoughts..1.The passive 3d is really awesome. way better than I expected.2. There is color/edge burn that's noticable when I turn on the TV, but it seems to go away and not be an issue when I'm watching just about anything. It's a slight greenish color. Seems rather amateurish to ship such a nice TV with that glow, but it's not nearly bad enough to where I'd return the TV3. The picture really is fantastic and the \"professional picture setup\" tool or whatever its called was nice to go through.4. Here's a really annoying but fixable issue. The USB ports on the back ONLY support NTFS and FAT32 files systems. That sucks if you're a mac user like me. If you plan on playing movies, you're stuck using NTFS (FAT32 has a max file size of 4gb.) If you have a Mac, like most of us, you're USB HDD or USB stick is likely formatted for Mac, furthermore Mac's do NOT natively support writing to NTFS devices. I tried several workarounds until I found the solution. There is a program you can buy (free 15 day trial to make sure it works) called Tuxera NTFS. Download/install this and it will allow you to reformat your USB stick drive (using Disk Utility) as NTFS-Tuxera. Now using your mac, you can transfer files onto the stick, and the TV will play it just fine (I just tested it on an 7gb .mkv file). Btw, I tried several freeware mac-ntfs solutions and none of them worked (I'm using Mac 10.7x btw).5. The Built in Youtube really sucks. There is a major sync issue between the audio and video. Also, the youtube app froze up and forced me to restart the TV several times.6. The remote / nintendo Wii knock-off is OK. I think most people will want to get a new remote, but it's not that bad. Not that good either.7. Did I mention the TV looks really awesome? Both aesthetically and the picture itself are gorgeous.8. The 3d glasses are actually really comfortable and very light. You could easily watch back to back to back 3d movies with these babies before you'd get tired of having the glasses on.9. Despite the issues listed above, I'm genuinely happy with the TV.

We were not actually interested in purchasing a 3D TV until realizing that after a couple days' worth of research, most non-3D TV's at this size just didn't have comparable features at similar price points.  So we opted to go for 3D, especially with the bundle offer.  There was also another bundle being offered which included a Blue Ray player (as opposed to the sound bar and extra 3D glasses), but the reviews on that BR player were pretty awful.Picture quality seems quite good for the very first LED/LCD TV I've owned.  I would say the quality and depth of the blacks and whites are on par with my Panasonic plasma TV (of course I made sure to go through all the settings and ensure 'Local dimming' was set as high as possible).  In addition, high-level motion doesn't produce any blurring or artifacts as far as I've noticed, and I've watched a few high-action movies just to test that.  So LG's \"Tru-motion\" software mapping, to bump a true 120Hz refresh rate up to ~240Hz seems to work fairly well.  The only issue is that there is no option to turn off the Tru-motion feature.The TV itself is very handsome, the bezel is very slim, and it is very light (<45 lbs I believe).  Even though it is a 'passive' 3D TV, native 3D content is absolutely beautiful.  I have to say, that even the feature to upconvert 2D -> 3D content works quite well.  It's not nearly as noticeable or beautiful as watching true native 3D content, but it does 'work' well regardless.This unit has a bevy of inputs/outputs: 4 HDMI inputs, including one dedicated for ARC and one for PC.  3 USB inputs, one dedicated for external HDD usage.  Also standard RJ45 LAN, DB15 VGA (PC), and an S/PDIF optical output in addition to standard RCA audio outputs for sound.  You'll definitely want to output the sound to some type of external system because the included 2x15 watt speakers are not great.  Since this bundle came with the sound bar system, it was a perfect fit.This TV also has wireless, but be forewarned - it supports standard WEP security only!  So if you utilize any other advanced wireless security protocols such as I do, WPA2 (TKIP/AES), then be prepared to either re-program your router, or just use the standard RJ45 LAN connection - which is what I opted to do.  I didn't like that shortcoming, which is part of the reason I dropped the rating for this unit from 5 stars to 4 stars.The included Magic remote has a very slight learning curve.  It is quite sensitive, and if you happen to bump into it while watching TV you will see the little arrow appear on the screen for a few seconds.  But you will likely only need to use the Magic remote for setup, and when accessing LG's included internet-ready applications (Netflix, YouTube, Hulu, etc).", "Date": "May 9, 2012"}, {"Title": "Beautiful Looking TV .. to me", "Author": "CorbinA", "ReviewID": "R1EWWNIZHV862U", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This tv looks amazing hanging on the wall. That is why a purchased it. When you look at what is offered by this set compared to Samsung, it was a no brainer for me. I essentially purchased it for the sleek form factor. Yes, it has a unique remote, it has \"smart\" features, it has 3D, but those aren't quite the reasons I purchased it. I am not a hardcore videophile, nor an expert on picture quality. So coming from an average watcher, the picture looks great! That is really all I have to say about it since it's all that matters. The specs can say whatever they want, but at the end of the day, the only thing that matters is what your eyes see, and if they like it then you are golden.The reasons for buying a tv are purely subjective to the person buying the tv. In my case, I wanted something that looked good when the tv was turned off as well as when it was turned on. The housing being aesthetically pleasing, was high on my tv priority list, and had major pull for me buying either this one or the LM7600. There again simply came down to aesthetics and we preferred the stainless finish of this one over the darker graphite look of the LM7600. Both are essentially the same TV under the hood. A minor TruMotion hz bump from 120 to 240, and better \"blacks\" (whatever that truly means), but my eyes can't tell and I don't even know if I am that satisfied with these smoothing technologies anyways.  I guarantee you, when this tv is the only one you see (most homes have only 1 tv in their room), you will think it looks good.There seems to be a huge difference from seeing this tv in a brick and mortar store vs seeing it in your own home. It really shines when it is alone. The tv also looks tiny in the store, but huge in your home. 47 inches is PLENTY for me and I sit about 15 feet away from the thing on average. That is of course a subjective feeling too, but for me it seems just fine. The remote works fine, and I wouldn't complain about it. It serves its purpose and I will use it for the smart functions. I use a Logitech remote for most of my A/V equipment, but for \"smart\" functionality, this magic remote will shine. Its kind of a conversation piece. I wouldn't call it a gimmick as it does work quite well, and is a decent alternative to the standard tap 50 times to input your wireless network key. Yeah you all know what I am talking about too. When you can point to the letters you want on the screen instead of tapping over to each one, you will like the magic remote.I am sorry this is running longer than expected, I just want to hit most of the bases. The stand is not \"overly distracting\" as others have noted. I am not using the stand because I wall mounted it. I did set it up on the stand to make sure everything worked and it looked nice sitting there. The stand matches the silver bezel and looks very modern. This may not work for a rustic home, but it isn't overbearing. The minimal framing around the tv is the reason I purchased it. Makes you want to be delicate in handling it, but it does feel very solid.A quick note on screen reflectivity. It does reflect, but not like a mirror as some people have stated. You can tell efforts were taken to semi gloss the screen. What people need to realize is that when you have a 47\"+ piece of glass or plastic staring you in the face, you are bound to see some reflection. The thing is that you want some gloss because this is how you get the clearest picture. I don't know about you, but I have seen iPhones where people put the scratch resistant, finger print proof, anti reflective screen protector on and it greatly reduced their overall screen quality. The iPhone looks best without screen protection. This is the same principle when they put a matte finish on tv screens. The picture will be dulled somewhat to cut down on reflective light.In conclusion, I hope this review has been somewhat helpful. I aimed to answer some of the questions I had going in.

When I bought it I was so excited about the 3D. However, I did not use it that much because most 3d movies at their store is expensive, for me at least. They run approximately from 4.5 dollars to 8.** something. This is from a humble experience browsing the LG 3D World.The quality of the picture is Amazing, Seriously, all of my friends who visited me said that it is amazing.I also like the hulu and netflix apps and use them on daily basis, since I do not have tv cable. But I am getting one next week with HD Channels. so very exciting.so far I've owned this TV for 4 to 5 months. I've noticed that the remote cursor can become really annoying when it is on the couch and you move, the cursor moves on the screen from short time. It will disappear but it can be annoying when you and your friends are playing games. Also the cursor sometimes is not where you are really pointing the remote at, like it is slightly off the correct direction, especially when you are writing on the screen keyboard.The youtube app is not really user friendly. beginning from the search option browsing a specific channel. You cannot search in any other language that English, however, You can go to LG Search and write in Arabic or language you set in the keyboard option, after that choose youtube. If you choose the vid you want, it will take you to the you tube app. but you will be able to go back to the LG search page unless you exit the youtube app. It can become a hassle.When there is a dark black screen, I do see some light leaking from the top left side. It is small. I do not know whether it was like this when I got it or not. Not really a big deal for me.The browser is good but do not expect to watch large videos on it. it will crash by itself. I think due to the small memory the TV has.I like the wifi feature. I stream HD movies and shows from hulu and netflix from it without any buffering issues, it maybe due the internet speed I have 10 Mb/sI believe  that I've changed the remote battery around four times since I got it. You can use rechargeable batteries, so you can save some money in the long run.The sound of the TV is not really what I wish, I feel it like it is far away I do not mean it is not loud enough. Maybe due to my hearing. But I will get a home theater anyway.Today I just figured out that the tv can be swivelled without moving the base.so far for me, it is worth the money.", "Date": "November 9, 2012"}, {"Title": "Great TV!!", "Author": "jmua04", "ReviewID": "R1HGH8ABH5A0QJ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I caught it on sale for $799 and couldn't be happier.

After months of searching and realizing a Sony XBR series was out of my range, I found the LG series.  Consumer reports rated 2 LG's in the top 3 for 3D tv's along with the Sony XBR line of course, I took a look at them in a Best Buy and liked what I saw.  The passive 3D works great compared to the  cumbersome active glasses, the picture quality looked pretty decent at the store, and the unit itself was very nice to look at with a super thin frame and virtually no frame on the screen.-47\" was my max for my room size, so I decided on the 47LM6700.  Why not move up to the 7600??  Well price for one, and I am still skeptical about the advantages of moving above 120Hz.-Put the 6700 on my wish list, and watched it for a few months for price drops.  It was $1300 or so when I first started watching, and one day at lunch I saw it pop down to a irresistible $798.  With free Amazon standard shipping, this was a steal!  I hit buy before the price shot back up, witch it did in a hour or so!Arrived via UPS with only a small dent in the shipping box, no damage to the unit itself.  Took the unit out of the box and was stunned how great it looked.  Silver frame and a screen that goes pretty much(1/2\" or so) to the edge of the frame.  Did not get a wall mount yet so I put it on its stand( yes its plastic).  Plastic stand looks nice and contemporary, and holds the weight with no problem.-Hook Up-I have a DirectTV HD box, going through a pass through Yamaha RX-V473 receiver.(HDMI and optical audio from cable box to receiver-HDMI from receiver to TV).  Hooked up and boom!!!  Up and running.  Plenty of HDMI inputs to the unit, but as others have noted only 1 Component, and 1 RCA input to the TV.  So if you are not going through a receiver and have multiple RCA/component peripherals you will need another switch box.-Performance-First thing I checked was manufacture date, 08/2012!  And newest updated software on it, 4.whatever! So no worries about the 120Hz TureMotion not a on/off option concern.  Right out of the box, not a bad picture, TrueMotion was on so you get the \"soap opera\" effect, so I turned it off right away and gone!!!  Set up with settings from a  reviewer website, and with a few adjustments to my taste...WOW!  Color on this puppy is insane!!! Vivid and crisp, eye popping color.  The black levels are where this TV looses points, not so great.  But not to the point where I would even consider sending it back!  Adjust your settings, and you will get a a black level that looks just fine!! Settings are so numerous on this TV that you can adjust almost every option you can think of.  Sports, movies, and regular TV look great, no issues at all once settings are tweaked to your eyes.I notice some \"flashlighting\" from the top of the TV, but only during dark movie scenes where the top is black, and it is not to the point of annoyance or concern to me.  If you are watching the movie you will not see it, if you are watching the top of the screen you will!!  No corner blooming or lighting issues otherwise on my TV.-3D-Love it.  Passive 3D is the way to go, and LG has done it right.  6 glasses in the box are great.  Activated the Direct TV 3D channels and tested it out.  WOW, that is all I can say.  Purchased the LG BP620 3D BlueRay player, and a IMAX 3D Grand Canyon movies, and holy crap!  Water flying out at you.  No issues except for viewing angle and distance.  Be sure and have your TV set up at the right distance to make the 3D more watchable.  Too close and it will be hard to watch.  Viewing angle not so great, but hey, its a living room TV not a Imax theatre so Im okay with that.-Remote-Pretty cool.  I have no issue with getting use to the Wii remote style.  Its actually pretty intuitive to use.  I set up my Direct TV remote to turn unit on and off anyway, so I use the magic remote only to change inputs or settings.-Sound-Just fine for TV speakers.  No issue, plenty loud and plenty quiet when needed.-I would say there is no better TV in the Sub $1500 price range than this one.  4 Stars because nothing is perfect!  If you can get this unit below $1000 I would say go for it!!  I have loved this TV since day 1.  Adjust the settings to your eyes, this ay take a week or so, and you will love it too!!  I don't know what you are waiting for(except maybe a price drop) so buy it!!!!! Ignore the negative reviews.

Picture looks great; although contrast could be better of course. I think the picture on my old 2010 Samsung 750 Series LCD does look a tad brighter and more detailed.

Samsung truly has 5mm bezels on their high end LEDs which is half what this TV has. It's not a deal breaker, by any means but I was somewhat disappointed when I opened the box. Also the 3d is a little underwhelming as the effect is not quite as pronounced as on sets with active shutter glasses. The remote takes some getting used to but it's OK furthermost part. I did like that LG bundled a lot of free 3D internet accessible content with this TV, even though it looks like standard definition (480p, medium quality video it seems)I bought my TV for a $1004 from amazon ($4 for next day delivery) and I'm overall satisfied with my purchase.

Took it out of the box, screw the stand, plugged it in and bam! After turning it on, I was able to pair the remote right away and setup wireless connection. The setup wizard that pops-up the first time you turn the TV on was very straight-forward and easy to follow through. I don't have cable and I couldn't connect to the antenna yet since I was missing an adapter but I was able to watch some YouTube videos, try out some free 3D shows and connect my laptop via RGB. The picture, sound and menu navigation was all great!I love the Magic Want remote as well. I personally think it's better than clicking through with traditional remote. It feels more interactive.

The network services will send their video information out at 60 Hz. The TV will not change that data. The TV will process the signal to increase the refresh rate to 120Hz automatically. The INFO bar will NOT display the change to the signal.\" to me that makes sense, I'll dig around some more and update this if it's wrong.Another thing I liked about this TV is when using the Netflix app you can covert the movie from 2D to 3D something that the Samsung I had before could not do.", "Date": "June 10, 2012"}, {"Title": "Amazing TV, 3D!

Waited and saw it jumped up by $30 but then noticed that I could get the package Blu-ray BD620 3D player and six more pair of Passive 3D glasses for free just by getting the TV and adding the items to my cart as long as they are provided by amazon.com!  Have received the TV and am very impressed!  So far I have only seen the 3D content via the downloaded stuff or by the 2D to 3D conversion.  Very nice.Rushed home when I saw it was delivered in the middle of the day.  They did deliver it to my side yard out of sight and I do live on a private street. Nonetheless, I had it inside in 30 minutes and I stayed home just long enough to set it up and verify the firmware.  After reading 35+ pages of issues and praise on AV forums I wanted to make sure the TV I had had the 03.20.93 update.  I saw on the back it was made in May 2012 and I was able to confirm I did have the x.93 update and I could choose settings for TruMotion.  Linked right up to my wireless and checked for an update - none.  But I'm happy with this version.  I feel for all you early adopters who bought this and are still stuck at x.31 with TrueMotion issues.  Also I have had it on for the last four days for over 5 hours and no restart issues.This TV replaces a four year old 42\" LCD Phillips that worked wonderfully.  But the Phillips TV had such wide borders, the 47\" LG with its thin borders only took up another 0.5\" in width so it fit inside our cabinet nicely.  The Phillips used 180W-300W, was not 3D, and does not have the brightness, crispness, and sharpness of this one which is rated at 110W in the manual.  The blacks may have been better on the Phillips but I am very impressed and happy with this TV and consider this a strong improvement.  While I am a picky Tech-person, I have found no flaws with the TV.While the TV has reportively better side viewing angles up to 30deg, if you are out that far and watching 3D it seems a bit distorted.I have not watched and 3D Blu-Rays yet because the player package is not even scheduled to ship for another month!  Oh well free 3D player and free shipping, I can wait.  I see the four year old Yamaha AV receiver is HDMI 1.3 and will not pass the 3D and Sound content through nor does it have the Audio Return option. SO I'll be running the 1.4 HDMI cables from the New 3D Blu-ray player directly to the TV,  and Hopefully I can get the Digital Audio out to be fed to the AV receiver without a noticable delay.  Otherwise I'll be getting a new AV receiver.  I only have a PC and Wii hooked up to it and have not had any playback issues.The six glasses that come with the TV are just two in plastic sleeves in a box for three boxes.  The six free ones came in a cool cylinder and have their own nylon-type package sleeve and lense wipe fabric.  Also instead of the traditional black or dark grey, these came in orange and white and just a bit of frame style.Have to say I don't really care for the Magic Remote.  If you have the option of 4 HDMI, 3 USB, Component, and Composite sources, and devices to fill them, you probably already have a universal remote by now.  Initially, it seemed I would have to keep this Magic Remote (RF) alongside my Harmony (IR only).  I have however, successfully reprogrammed my Harmony Remote able to select the proper input with the cooresponding activities on the TV as well as other commands!  And yes until I got the TV all figured out to work with my Harmony, that accidental touch of the Magic remote and the cursor appearing is VERY ANNOYING!I hope to update this again once I have the 3D blu-ray player to really see its 3D ability.UPDATE (06-28-2012)The TV portion works well.  Apparently you can combine Antenna and Cable box into one and it will scan for them all.  Antennaweb said I lived between 5-6 miles from the TV towers.  At first I oriented the antenna on one part of my roof, but it seems the neighboring church cell tower there interfered with the signal.  Moved it to the opposite part of the house and got 67 channels!  Woo Hoo - one issue I need to figure out is that channel 9.1 will not pass sound through my AV Receiver.  But all the other channels including 9.2, and 9.3 do.  9.1 will play through the TV speakers.  But why?  Need to find out.And last night the TV informed me there was an Update (03.21.40)!!!!

I researched and came made the decision to purchase off of Amazon however my mistake was choosing a third party and not Amazon directly.  I purchased through Amazon from Audio Visual and told my wife that I would rather pay a little more and have a new one, than pay less and take a chance with either a used or refurbished model.  I did pay more and boy were we excited to get this TV.  The delivery person had to be dialed multiple times and when finally decided on a delivery date called late that day to say he might have to wait to the next.  He kindly responded to my resistance and delivered it later that evening which made us happy.  It started with the box, it looked like it had been through a war, it was beat up, crumpled the packing inside was all jumbled, and I had a sinking feeling taking it out of the box that there was going to be an issue.  There was, upon turning on the TV was wiped out on the left side, had lines running through it, it was internally busted.  Amazon tech support was great they helped and it was still no good so we have since returned this to the supplier.  It has been over two weeks since returning and still no refund.  This company is Audio Visual and they are HORRIBLE, do not buy from Audio Visual or even better a third party from California period just in case they change their name, it has been a literal nightmare.  Customer service horrible.  Return policy I have a feeling they will take forever to give the money back, amazing since it comes out of your account immediately but the return my be here upon the return of Jesus.  Amazon is working with us to get it back so being fair I will give them their due time, but since this occurred we purchased from QVC received excellent service quick delivery and incredible door to door service.  The delivery man was a marvelous professional and the TV itself is more perfect than I could have ever wanted.  Be careful ordering from a third party you have been warned, I may never get my refund but at least I have satisfaction and knowing that paying a little more in the end was worth it.That being said the TV is incredible.  The apps are great the remote is a cool point and click like a virtual mouse.  The blacks are so dark when there is a pause I thought it turned off.  It looks like the cast is in my living room on high definition.  There is no distortion ever period, perfect crisp and so clear it like being in person, and sports oh man basketball I can see the sweat on the court no kidding.  No wacky expensive glasses and be-a-utiful in its design.  Very small bezel on the outside makes it look like you are looking into a window.  It is so crisp and brilliant and well just perfect.  The stand is easy to put on and it swivels, there are plugs for plugs all the HDMI I could ever need.  I would only opt for passive 3D and know I and my kids would destroy expensive glasses, you can use the same ones as the movie theater, the 3d is amazing better than the movie theater without annoying people kicking my seat and no wires plugs, batteries or unknown consequences to our vision.  It is the best TV or should I really describe this as ENTERTAINMENT showpiece because TV is just too simple to describe it.  I will forever be a loyal LG customer just with wisdom of hindsight if you want my opinion, pay a few bucks extra to ensure you get a brand new perfectly delivered, nothing is more painful than telling your buddies who came to this great unveiling that it sucks because the company you ordered it from delivered a broken showpiece.  Be safe pay a little more get brand new from a trusted source, you will love the TV!  I am sitting in a room with a basketball game on right now and my friends are watching it in 3d, they have not said anything in over 30 minutes, it is that cool.  Oh and works great with my Playstation 3 (Plays 3d movies perfectly)  and even used with my gaming computer, just use the game setting and it looks perfect.

We barely had to make any calibration outside of turning off the TruMotion option. And speaking of a cool remote, I thought I had to set the star trek like phaser remote to stun. Super cool, super sleek styling and a super bargain at this price. I've read quite a few reviews regarding the sound quality but I can honestly say that the sound from the stock speakers are pretty good. I do agree that if you want theater like sound then yes, you need to invest in a surround speaker system. If I wanted to be picky, the only thing I wish it had is Pandora and Amazon VOD.

It will take some adjusting to get it to look fantastic, but fantastic it will look. The settings I found here [...] work great and provide good picture quality under nearly all circumstances, especially with 3D on which we will touch on later. The colors are vivid and accurate, rich and immersive; watching The Avengers or Alice in Wonderland prove this beyond a shadow of a doubt. The backlight is very bright if need be, but I found that 41/100 is about all you need in a typical room. As for the local dimming feature, leave it on high! I found this to eliminate any blooming issues, which I did not experience like some others have. The dimming also increased the depth of the black level significantly. Trumotion, as usual, does not do anything for me. 60hz was how movies were intended to be viewed so this is how I view them. This is part of the reason I opted for the 6700 instead of the 7600. There are lots of explanations and opinions for and against 120 and 240hz. Since I do not use the Smoothing feature I will not comment on it other than to say it decreased the PQ substantially for my taste, and made everything look dream-like. Adjusting PQ was pleasant as well. I am not sure why CNet complained because I found the settings to be very adequate and provided for a great amount of control over the look of the set.- DesignThe design is the most striking feature of the tv besides the PQ. The bezel around the top and sides are barely a 1/2 inch thick, and the bottom bezel is all silver with the LG logo. To say the least, this set is sure to dazzle your guests. The stand is no different, a u-shaped base above which the tv appears to float. The stand is plastic, but you cannot tell unless you touch it. The silver around the edges is a nice touch too. This set is so thin it looks nearly impossible. The speakers are the thickest portion of the set and even that is barely more than an inch.- SoundThe built-in speakers are decent. Better than that of the Vizio LED sets out there by a long shot. They are no replacement for surround sound though. Nothing more to say about the speakers besides that they will suffice in a small room, set to \"Cinema\" mode.- FeaturesInputs a-plenty. HDMI, USB, VGA, etc... hohum...Everything you need. WiFi connectivity works flawlessly and quickly. The apps are neat, clean, and function as they should. Premium video services may seem a little short, ahem AMAZON! Not sure why, but even LG does not even know when it will be available. This should not be a make or break since most Blu-Ray players stream Amazon Instant. Other than the lack of Amazon Instant the set works flawlessly. Hulu displays just like on a PS3 with all the necessary function, and same applies to Netflix. The LG rental services work very well also even for 3D movies.- 3DThis set produces stunning 3D. To me this is the most attractive feature of the set. This set functions flawlessly in 3D, with practically no ghosting from any horizontal viewing position. This means that if you have a long couch people at the ends are not going to be cheated or sick halfway through from ghosting. Changing perspective vertically beyond the top or bottom bezel will produce ghosting, but the results are fantastic when sitting at the proper height. Keep this in mind when you are purchasing if your set is hung high on the wall; viewing angles should be considered. 2D to 3D conversion is okay, better than most sets I have seen, but regular shows and movies are still better viewed in 2D. The glasses are comfortable and the do not pinch the sides of your head. My wife wears her prescription glasses under the 3D pair without any discomfort- RemoteRemote works fine.

I was a bit hesitant to purchase given CNET's 2.5 star rating and some of the negative reviews here but decided that the 50% off MSRP price was worth it.  I can only imagine that CNET's review came out as 2.5 stars partly because of the original sticker price on the units; if I paid $1749 I probably wouldn't be overly thrilled with my purchase but for almost half that price this TV is absolutely worth the price.3D looks pretty good, whether it's 2D converted to 3D or true 3D content.  The regular 2D quality isn't the best on the market but for a 47\" TV under $1000 it is solid; it is important to compare TVs in the same price range and is not really fair to compare the best Panasonic plasma TV's image quality to this TV's.  Netflix, YouTube, Hulu Plus, MLB.tv and some other apps are all included with the TV so you don't even need an Xbox, PS3, or other device to watch movies on Netflix.  To anyone looking for a TV for under $1000 I would highly recommend this and feel like it's a solid purchase even if it didn't contain 3D but getting the addition of 3D is a nice bonus.Some people have complained about the remote.  If you've ever used a Nintendo Wii then this remote will be very familiar to you.  It acts just like a Wii remote where it's motion sensitive and you move a cursor around the screen.  I personally am not in love with it, but honestly who uses the remote that comes with the TV anymore these days?  You're likely either using the remote provided from your Cable/Satellite provider, or if you're like me you have a Logitech Harmony universal remote that controls pretty much any device you can think of (I recommend either Logitech Harmony 900 Rechargeable Remote with Color Touch Screen if you like to be able to change channels through walls or not aim the remote at the TV or the Logitech Harmony One Universal Remote with Color Touchscreen if you prefer direct line of sight like traditional infrared remotes).Also, I was planning to wall-mount this TV so weight was a factor for me too.  If wall-mounting was not a factor then I would probably look at Panasonic VIERA TC-P50ST50 50-Inch 1080p Full HD 3D Plasma TV (I know you can wall mount a plasma but I didn't feel as comfortable putting 71 lbs above my fireplace).  If 3D was not a factor but wall-mounting was a must then I would probably look at Samsung LN46D630 46-Inch 1080p LCD HDTV (Black).

Once you get used to it, its pretty easy to navigate.-- 3D is superb. Passive 3D is the way to go and LG has nailed it this time.-- In built speakers are loud among all LED TV's I have seen. This thing is thin and yet its packed with powerful speakers.-- Smart TV is as good as other LED tv's but I don't use them as I have a Roku/PS3.Cons-- Glossy screen, glossy screen, glossy screen. Its the biggest irritation. It just bugs me to the core that sometimes I can see everything on the TV except video.-- Black levels are very average but somewhat fixed with dynamic contrast set to high. I have seen Sony producing mind blowing black levels.-- My first unit had clouding but replaced it and its gone now.-- Until recently, there was no trumotion control feature.

I don't have a plasma sitting next to it to compare, but the colors are wonderful, and picture is great.Great design. First thing my friend said when he saw it, \"Wow, there is like no border!\" He's pretty close to correct.

I honestly am quite surprised that I enjoy the 3D as much as I do. I will explain later in the review.WiFi! DLNA- I haven't used it yet, but I know I will in the future. Wireless streaming? Awesome!TruMotion- TO EACH HIS OWN! Yes, some people HATE this feature with a passion. Leave it on and you will get used to it. I prefer it on, but if you don't, don't complain! Just turn it off.The Bad:The shiny screen can be a problem at times, as others have said. It is especially annoying during 3D movies, and it can sometimes take you out of the movie for a brief second. You only notice it in dark scenes, but do recognize that it's there.Remote design. I mentioned the remote in the Good because I like the way it performs. However, the shape of the thing is so annoying! It rests on one small flat surface in the front, and a single point in the back. When its resting, it is insanely easy to knock over. LG should really re-design the shape or else offer a stand to set it in.Digital Audio output only. I don't know if this is a thing with most TVs, but I was hoping for a headphone jack or RCA out, to hook up to a older speaker system. Oh well..The speakers. For some movies, you have to turn them up to 70%, Xbox games are usually 40-50%, and TV is like 10-20%. This can be a problem when switching between inputs.The apps. No Pandora was a big bummer. vTuner (radio app) instead is quite nice, and plays most local radio stations.LAG! There is a reason they make this TV with a Dual-Core processor. Sometimes, the TV will lag considerably and take a minute+ to load apps. Never any lag with the Magic Remote, only apps. Twice it froze loading Hulu. A quick off/on fixed the problem, but still. I don't think the Dual-Core is worth the extra cost, but if you have money to blow, or just won the lottery, do it!## General Review ##The first thing I want to point out is important for anyone using old RCA input systems. I hooked up my old PS2 to the RCA input and put in Guitar Hero. I had the video settings on \"vivid\" or something, and noticed my game was lagging considerably (0.5 seconds+). I freaked out and began furiously searching the internet. I figured the TV was trying to upscale the poor picture, but I couldn't turn it off. In the Picture settings, there is a mode for \"Game\". Turning this setting to Game mode fixes the problem. I was quite relieved and wished I knew about this earlier!3D review- When I purchased the TV, I had little hopes for the 3D. I have been to 3D movies in theaters, and always left with a headache and wishing I had just seen it in 2D. I rarely expected to use the 3D feature.I borrowed the new TRON movie in 3D from a friend. I popped it in and jumped to the middle. Unbelievably, I accidentally seeked to one of the best 3D scenes in the movie. (In the movie, Sam gets the light-bike handlebars and jumps on them, right over the camera. When you see it in 3D, you won't forget it.) I was so amazed by this scene, I immediately watched the entire movie. Loved it! I went out and got other 3D movies, and really enjoy them as well. I am surprised to say, that I really enjoy the 3D experience on this TV. I personally find it better than the movie theater's 3D. If you don't like 3D, that's fine! There's a way to change the \"depth\" of the picture from a little to a lot.Because this is a 3D TV, that means... *drum roll please*.. Dual Play! Have 2 kids or play video games with friends? No question, get this TV. In video games, the screen is usually split when you have 2+ players. Dual Play allows you to take your half of the screen, and it makes it full screen. While you see your character in full screen, the person next to you sees their own different screen in full screen. I don't believe any Active 3D TVs offer this feature currently. Although this TV will likely never offer this feature, in the future look for TVs that allow 2 different programs simultaneously. You see your program, while your partner sees their own. Probably 2+ years away, but interesting concept.Again, the apps on this TV are terrible except for maybe 2 or 3. If you want \"apps\" wait for a TV that integrates with the Android Play Store (or similar). There's a radio app, Netflix, Hulu, and some other video streaming services, but that's about it. LG, why do you even include the Games section? The games have like 2 reviews each, and all look ridiculous..Noteworthy, LG is supposed to have an Android app that works with this TV. I haven't looked into it yet (I believe it is called SmartShare?) but will in the future.3D gaming and 2D -> 3D conversion: Games that are made for 3D are amazing. My friends were freaking out playing Black Ops 2 in 3D. That being said, there are very few games made with 3D in mind. Halo 4, not so great.. This leads me to my next point, 2D -> 3D conversion. This is a very hard feature to rate. I've watched some TV shows in HD and turned on the 2D -> 3D conversion. In the end, it didn't do very much. It seems to set the picture back in depth, but doesn't really bring anything forward. It does however, make you feel a little bit more like you are part of the show. If you're going to sit down and watch something without interruptions and really get into a show (lights out), turn on the 3D. If you are running around, doing chores, etc, just leave it off.I don't know how big your room is, or how it is set up, so I will give you my dimensions for reference. The TV is set up in the corner. I usually sit about 12 feet from the TV. The center of the TV is between 3- 9 inches above my eye level. It is currently on the stand, but will eventually be mounted on the wall. I watched TRON in 3D from about 12 feet away, but I have played 3D games as close as 5 feet, and had little to no problems. The glare can sometimes be a problem, but if you sit dead-center in front of the TV, you will also sometimes see yourself. (weird)One thing that bugs me, when you're in an app (vTuner, Hulu, etc) you can't bring up the mini-menu on the bottom. I have tried many times. You have to press the Home button to get out of the app (lame..)With all that being said, I feel I have done a somewhat structured review of the TV.*Note* regarding Amazon- They will price match the TV for 15 days (I believe). Sounds great, but what they don't tell you is when you buy the TV, they are going to automatically mark it up! I bought it at $1187. The next day, the TV is $1200. The day after $1300. The prices on this TV seem to fluctuate daily. Check back often.Amazon's shipping was decent though. Two guys came to my house, installed the stand, and set it on the floor. They put the batteries in the remote (backwards the first time *face palm*) and waited until the TV turned on using the remote. They obviously smoked, and made the room stink a little, but that's not Amazon's fault.", "Date": "February 26, 2013"}, {"Title": "Awesome TV", "Author": "twindad2k1", "ReviewID": "R38DPCZOKZJY6V", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Gotta say, I'm blown away by this TV!The picture - both 2D & 3D - is superb.  The sleek attractive styling really makes this look like a piece of art (okay, I know, it's still a TV).

They also have a fairly robust internet browser (although it appears to lack flash support...?).  LG is releasing new apps constantly, so hopefully (crossing fingers) all the popular apps will be available soon.LG's Smart Share is a nice feature as well...it automatically found my media servers and so far has played just about every file I've thrown at it (including half-SBS 3D MKV files).LG's Simplink is really nice too . . . it controls many other devices, even from other manufacturers.  I can actually power-on, control, and navigate through my Samsung BR player menu using LG's remote.And speaking of the remote, this Magic Remote, although at times overly sensitive to movement (don't leave it sitting on the couch with your fidgety kids!), is really pretty cool.

It takes a little getting used to (technically, it's closer to a computer than a TV) but it's well worth the effort.First, the primary function of a TV, which is the picture display.  It is awesome.  I can watch TV without glasses.Second, the Smart functions (which is why I bought the TV.)  The WiDi connection and the DLNA server interface make connection to your PC and network  information fairly easy (WiDi takes a little effort, but LG customer support blames that on the laptop manufacturer.) The Internet is somewhat cumbersome because of the lack of a keyboard, but it will do.  If there's a need for a high resolution Internet display for a presentation, etc., it's probably best to do a WiDi connection to your laptop.  The mouse wand is a little hard to get used because the pointer arrow is not aligned with the mouse wand, the arrow responds to wand movement, e.g. move the wand to the right and the arrow moves to the right, even if the wand is aligned to the left of the arrow.  It's also annoying, because if you bump the wand while watching a movie, etc. the arrow pops up and has to be moved off the screen with the wand.One of the other Reviewers pointed out that a keyboard can be plugged into a USB port, but not a mouse.  In order to fully use the Internet, functionality for a bluetooth keyboard and mouse would need to be added.On the negative side, no LG products, including TVs, DVD players, etc. have Amazon Prime and it definitely does not work through the Internet.  Also, LG products are saddled with overseas technical support, where you can barely understand the Rep.'s accent, even if you can find someone who is competent technically.  My technical support Rep. told me that my TV didn't have WiDi and that I had to buy an external PushTo box.  When I spoke to his Supervisor, he told me that the TV did have WiDi so the problem had to be with the laptop.  Eventually, I was able to get the right combination of settings, but it typically takes a dozen or so attempts to make a connection.  Once the connection is made though, it's solid.This is actually the second LG Smart TV that I bought this year.  I liked the first one so much, I bought another one.In conclusion, the LG Smart TVs are a new generation, and there are growing pains, just as there has been with the entire technology industry, but I definitely recommend buying one.", "Date": "December 29, 2012"}, {"Title": "Erased many doubts", "Author": "Moogii", "ReviewID": "R214NRNCBZUKAL", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "There are quite a number of reviewers out there who had numerous complaints about this TV.  The complaints were mainly about this TV not being able to display 120hz, the ability to toggle on/off to increase motion smoothness on fast action programming such as sports.Bear in mind that many reviews were made late 2011, early 2012 so I can't really question the negative reviews put out at the time.  It may be that firmware upgrades may have resolved many issues.I'm only able to speak from my limited, 3 days of experience with this TV and I can say with confidence that there was no picture issues whatsoever.  If you are a pixel freak, nothing in this world will satisfy you so stop yourself from getting this TV.  Now for the 99.5% of the population that are avid or casual TV viewers, you may be pleasantly surprised.  I saw no issues with ghosting or blurring on sports programming as many have pointed out.  I watched 2 NBA games, and 1 NFL game in full.  I have also popped in avatar blu-ray and can say that the picture is just beautiful.Don't try to judge this TV from subpar quality from the HD channels out of your cable or satellite STBs.  The reduced quality of HD content is not the issue of this TV but the source.  If you have issues while viewing blu-ray, it could be a sign of a faulty TV.  There are defects on any products out there regardless of how good the quality controls are.  Therefore, I'm typically not the one to put out bad reviews based on defects.  Fortunately, my set came without any apparant defects.2D to 3D:It is great for adding slight depth to your standard 2D content.  However, I would not regularly view contents using 2D>3D as pictures won't look as great in 3D as 2D.  It's a neat gadget, but it is in no way comparable to actual 3D contents.  If you expect bodies to fly out to front of your eyes, you'll be disappointed.  If you take 2D>3D for what it is, an ability to create some depth, you'll be satisfied.3D:LG 3D is top notch.  Not much negative could be said.  Watching several 3D contents, I noticed barely zero crosstalk compared to an active 3D set I also own.  My eyes are less strained as well on this TV but don't expect zero eye fatigue.  It's still 3D which causes your eyes to work harder.Gaming:This TV's response time differs greatly depending on the label assigned to your HDMI inputs.  I can say for sure that if you label your input \"Game\", you will get a higher response time that results in input lag in games that require fast responses.  Instead of being dissapointed, change the \"picture mode\" to \"Game\", and give it a try.  Otherwise, you can label your game input as \"PC\" and it will use a low response time regardless of the picture mode.  I have played Call of Duty, Black Ops 2 and Madden 13 without any issue after these adjustments were made.Comparison to step-up model:I myself have wondered for very long time If I should get the 47LM6700 (TruMotion 120hz) or 47LM7600 (TruMotion 240hz), and was at few times a click away from going for 7600 because of the negative reviews of 6700.  I for one am glad I saved $200 and settled with 6700.  My main concern was coming from ghosting, blurring issues reported on 6700 but saw none of that.  In addition, the difference in contrast ratio between the two models is negligible at best and again, if you are a spec, detail freak, go for the 7600.  If not, 6700 will do you just fine.Overall:I'd say this TV is one of the best \"bang for your buck\" type of deal out there.", "Date": "December 20, 2012"}, {"Title": "I like this TV but.....", "Author": "M. R. Galde", "ReviewID": "RJLE8Y512BIG5", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Let me start off by saying that I highly recommend this television and after a few months of playing with it I have been happy with this set; however I am going to be a little critical to a few issues that I will discuss later.To describe my setup I am running this television connected to my TiVo TCD750500 Premiere 4 Digital Video Recorder (Black) and through a very basic home theater audio system. The audio on the TV is fine but I have yet to find any television that has been able to have an acceptable audio system for watching movies with so I refuse to be too critical of the audio. I will say however that the internal audio is much improved from my previous Toshiba television but you need a additional system to have any real experience no matter what television you decide to purchase.Picture quality is great, I think it took me a little under a week to get my settings just right and some of the auto features were nice but I still had to adjust the automated ones to get it too my liking. Video from a direct cable line was what you would expect but this television puts the channels in an odd menu I was not familiar with. If you are going through a cable box or a TiVo then this should not even be an issue but just a FYI.I also have a PS3 and a Xbox360 hooked up to this and my PS3 needed me to set a few other setting enabled on its side to enable 3d games as it detected my 3D TV. The Xbox 360 only needed a minor screen adjustment to make use of the full screen. My Tivo on the other hand is my powerhouse in my media hub as the majority of my entertainment comes from that and I have no issues except with the television remote.LG has the magic remote which to be fair is not bad, I honestly don't use any original remote for any TV and end up replacing it for a more universal option but the magic remote is a nice feature when operating the smart features of this television. The television also has a feature when you can use the motion remote to control other devices like a TiVo which caught my attention but later became a disappointment. To be fair it does look as if it was made to interact with just cable boxes but it did have the option for the TiVo so I wanted to give it a shot. For the most part the communication between the TV and the TiVo for this feature can only run through the HDMI cable and it seems to only be able to do this about 85% of the time. I also can really only change the channels on my TiVo which again might be fine for a cable box but I would really like to see some additional features put into this because it's an interesting idea but I don't believe it's very well published.The Smart feature of the TV has the best web browser I have seen so far on a television and it runs most sites just fine. Someone said they could stream movies from amazon instant video from it and I did try this but have been unsuccessful. I also would not recommend this as it does not seem to be optimized for this but the web browser was much more impressive then I would have imagined. The apps included are alright, Netflix and Hulu are two that I use all of the time and they work well on this system. The youtube app which is not a LG problem has this horrible interface that every other device has that annoys me and I really wish google would change. My only other complaint is with the still ongoing dispute between Amazon and LG over its Amazon instant video streaming rights. I knew this tv did not have it installed when I purchased it but I would really wish these two would figure something out because it's the only app I really miss outside of Pandora. Pandora is a whole other licensing issue that LG can't really control tell next year so that's just a wait and see deal.Overall I like this television, I never had a ghosting issue while watching TV but it has come up while turning on my set or waiting for a smart feature menu to load, other than that it just looks like a normal led cycle where they were not told to turn black. During a movie playback I have yet to discover an issue. And lastly the 3D is impressive and I enjoy it allot. The game mode is very nice and I am glad LG made the frames orange as they are easier to find from the rest of my black frame glassesLG Electronics AG-F310DP Cinema 3D Dual Play Gaming Glasses (2 Pair). If I ever need to replace my 3D glasses I could just go out to a 3d Movie and just swipe them from there to rebuild my collection.

When I got the TV I wasn't disappointed and the size was just about right, in a small to median size room I warmly recommend to get the 55\".Picture - The picture quality is amazing but keep in mind you might need some tweaking to set it up by YOUR standards, it took me about 3 days of tweaks here and there until I got the image quality I like. the TRU MOTION feature is definitely unnecessary as you will get the infamous \"soap opera effect\" because of the high frame rate, I only use it for sport and live shows, the image quality is as GREAT without it. I'm not experiencing the flashlight issue as some mentioned here.3D - 3D is with no doubt high end quality perfect picture as well, I also own a VIZIO 3D TV and have some issues with its 3D, like uneven 3D image and the right bottom corner always blurry, with the VIZIO you can see a clear 3D only if you sit in front of the TV at the same TV height. These issues don't apply to the LG, I can sit in all angles of the TV and still see a normal and even 3D image, and...you get 6 pairs of 3D glasses. the 2D->3D feature is 'cute' but not perfect and I probably won't use it but who cares that wasn't the reason I got the TV.DLNA - The DLNA is awesome and one of the main reasons behind this purchase, it connects to media servers on your computer and plays anything I tried so far, whenever it recognizes a media server it adds it to the input list all you need to do is then go to you computer and allow this connection, you can download the LG share software.Smart/Apps - Well this one is a big disappointment and I hope LG will add some more serious, useful and entertaining apps. I only use netflix but it would have been nice if they had a better selection. I didn't check other smart TVs besides VIZIO so maybe boring apps selection is common with smart TVs, I can say the VIZIO selection is not better.Browser - the browser is very nice although when trying to watch online videos it will crash saying its out of memory.Remote - I read some reviews here complaining about the remote, well...it's not as bad as ppl  indicated here and I didn't experience any issues operation it but keep in mind you can't fully operate the TV without the magic remote, the funny thing is I saw video reviews where the host tried to lay the remote on its back and complaining it always fall...WHATS THE PROBLEM LAYING IT ON ITS SIDE?!...other remotes you can't lay on its side, this one you can.Pros - Price, image quality, 3D, DLNA....for me it's basically almost everything but depends on preferences there are some cons as follow...Cons - 2D->3D is not perfect in-fact useless, low end Apps, glossy screen(like a mirror in day time).*** I really didn't like the packaging of this TV as well it really looks like an open box...I will write a packaging review with images.  Also the shipping was by a private company because it was over 48\", It was a free 2 day scheduled delivery for Friday, they called me the day before and said they will ship it the next Thursday, I didn't agree and told them it suppose to be shipped tomorrow...they started to negotiate the delivery day until I got tired of it and told them I'll contact Amazon, they immediately changed and said they will deliver it at the scheduled time.If anyone would like me to share my picture setting let me know.", "Date": "September 22, 2012"}, {"Title": "This TV Deserves Five Stars", "Author": "S. Peterson \"theswedishchef\"", "ReviewID": "R10E8PU41UQHON", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Amazon ReviewThis is not a fresh out-of-the-box review as we've had this amazing TV for a couple months now. I have never been a fan of 3D. The few movies I've seen in the theater I've seen in the theater I've not liked. So all that to say, I'm a genuine 3D skeptic.Let's start with the bad:My wife hates the remote. Understand that she still cannot figure out how to answer her cell phone and is the type that if it has more than an on-off button, she gets confused. The colors are very very vivid, almost to the point of distraction. Adjustments have not helped to our personal liking but that's just us and this is a minor issue.Now for the good:I love the remote and so do my kids. It's very similar to the Wii. It's an amazing looking TV, very svelte. Although it came with a white glove service, I was unable to take full advantage of it so I had to set it up myself. This was also very easy and rather basic. The picture quality is super crisp and almost too revealing. You can see every imperfection Hollywood does not want you to see.And now for the hard part:I love the 3D. We immediately purchased a 3D compatible BluRay player and a movie. I was amazed. It's a PIXAR movie and I've not yet purchased a \"real life\" 3D movie. However, I was blown away with the 3D and I am no longer a sceptic and anti-3D guy. This TV does a great job rendering and presenting the film with no glitches or other bugs.Final report:I'm going to give it 5 honest stars. Although my wife would give it 3 because of the remote she hates, I am giving it 5 because I am so amazed at the quality, the looks, the ease of set-up and I'm blown away at this technology. Albeit I did grow up with black and white TV in the early 60's and I am easily impressed, this is truly an impressive TV and one of the best toys I have. I'm actually proud to own a TV like this.", "Date": "August 3, 2012"}, {"Title": "First impressions", "Author": "Tim", "ReviewID": "R3LMG61ZFGP5MJ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "My first impression is that this TV is beautiful.  I got this TV along with the LG NB3520A 300W Sound Bar with Wireless Subwoofer bundle deal from buydig for 1800$ shipped.  The TV itself is beautiful and I can't wait to mount this and the sound bar on the wall together.  I've never been huge on 3d but the cinema 3d on this tv is great and may have convinced me to buy a few 3d blu-ray movies.Pros: Passive 3d is excellent.  Picture quality is also very impressive.  I bought a spare remote to replace the \"magic\" remote, but to me it feels very natural and I may very well return the spare remote because I like the magic remote so much.  Glasses are very comfortable and inexpensive.  Super sexy stand and bezel.Neutral: Slightly glossy screen but doesn't affect me even in a relatively bright room (knew it was like this going in to the purchase). TV sound is meh but I'm assuming most people will have external sound anyways. People are complaining about the thickness of the area where the mounting hardware is screwed into the back of the TV, and where the I/O is connected.  Personally, I like not having to use as many breakout cables and have all of my inputs mounted permanently on the back of the TV. Nothing to lose and have to re-purchase.Cons: Place you magic remote on the end table because if you bump it or drop it on the floor a big cursor will appear on the screen while you are gaming/watching a movie.  There is a little bit of back-light uniformity problem in the four corners but it is very minimal and is only noticeable (to me) when the screen is completely black.Can't comment on the web browser/netflix/apps as I haven't used them yet. I had trouble having the TV connect to my router with just my SSID and password, so I had to delve deeper into the expert connection options before I got it to connect.Update:The \"special dual play\" glasses are not for sale yet but I successfully modified two pairs of my glasses for dual play and tested it with GT5 on my PS3. There was very little ghosting and it worked!Also I was able to connect a wireless usb keyboard and it works with the tv/browser/apps but I usually use my laptop as a HTPC anyways", "Date": "March 20, 2012"}, {"Title": "Finding a balance between function and form", "Author": "A. Sinnary", "ReviewID": "R1EJ1HOI96TKW2", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I purchased this TV after reading countless positive reviews from Amazon, DigitalTrend, and AVSforum.  I still posit that this TV is the best bang for buck in its class.  The more savvy shoppers can scoop them up from major retailers for $900 as long as you keep an eye out.  For a new TV that offers SmartTV, 3D, and an incredible design that's a steal.  Most of the reviews stated the TV could handle whatever was thrown at it.  However, I must disagree.Just so you can get an idea what I use a TV for, this is going to be primarily an extension of my desktop monitor.  I'm going to watch anime, movies from my computer, streaming tv shows from Amazon Prime and what not.  I would also be playing Skyrim, Guitar Hero, and a few classic consoles.For me purchasing this TV was between this one and the older LG PA6500 series.  I knew that the Plasma was going to have a better image no matter what, but I thought with so many positive reviews for this LED and it only being a bit more, I would take the plunge.Positives:Incredible design with a very thin bezel and an overall thin TV.  And if not being thin is enough, the TV puts out little to not measurable heat anywhere you put your hand.  Whether it be in the front, the back, side, anywhere.It is a fantastic value because for the LED+ Local Dimming.  It's not as amazing as true local dimming, but it helps a lot with light bleed.It is ISFCCC ready so you can really calibrate the image.Generous amount of inputs.The SmartTV offers flash support.The remote is very clever.  It makes navigating from bed a comfortably lazy affair.The 3D, though gimmicky, is neat because it doesn't need the bulky active 3D glasses that give me a headache after some time watching.Loading a flash drive with video files and plugging it into the TV works quite well.  It supports many inputs and can resume from previous playback.The TV offers SmartShare, which is also nice.  I couldn't manage to get it working, but I'm sure someone has.  I was reading online that people were having stability issues when using the Nero Share software that is bundled with TV, however if you use Windows Media Player, it should alleviate some of the crashing.Negatives:The TV doesn't have true 120hz refresh rate.  It's 60hz out of the box, and after running through the updates, it offers the TrueMotion \"120hz.\"  Essentially, it fills in the missing frames that never existed so the image looks smoother.  In fact, it creates a bad soap opera effect, even when you turn the dejuddering down to 1.Originally I had it connected to my computer using a HDMI cable, however the colors ended up looking very bad and there was very significant input lag.  Nearly an entire second it felt like.  So I had to use the VGA input knowing that would slow the time down.When using the VGA input, it's limited to 60hz and no modifications can be made other than color.  So the Smoothing, active contrast, etc is all disabled when using the VGA input.  I'm guessing it is because there is no post processing when using VGA since the computer can do all the processing.  Unlike using HDMI where the TV has to do post processing.When using the VGA input to watch movies, it took a considerable amount of calibration to get the colors closer to what they need to be.  I have a fairly high end monitor with very high color accuracy.  I know for a TV to be that accurate is expecting a lot, but it was pretty far off.  Out of the box, everything is much too blue, the contrast is all wrong, and things just looked blurry.  After calibrating it and leaving it on the gaming mode (to disable any extra post processing to lower lag time), I finally have it at a comfortable level where I don't notice the color being so off.The TV offers ho hum gaming performance as well.  Using the VGA input and playing PC games, I find there is still lag time even with it using input and turning off all post processing.  Using my XBOX and playing games I notice there is quite a bit of blur from the post processing.  As a comparison, I tried playing games on an old Plasma we have in the house and it was definitely no competition.  When it comes to games, I'll just have to use my desktop monitor so I can stay competitive in the more high paced games.SmartTV on this TV is nice that it exists.  Most surprisingly is that it has support to browse the internet.  However, some of my favorite sites like SouthParkStudios don't work.  I was really hoping this would work, as I would love to not need my computer to browse some of these streaming sites.  What happens is that it will start playing the advertisement (the advertisement always works), then once the video should load, it loses the connection.  I'm guessing this is probably something related to the limited flash support on the TV.  As I recall, the TV does have Flash 11, so it should work.  Alas, it does not.  Some of the other live streaming sites, if they did manage the work, the image very extremely laggy.  The TV just doesn't have the processing power that it needs to accomplish some of these tasks our smartphones take for granted.  And finally, the browser crashes a lot with a low memory error.  It's nice that the TV has internet support, but it is very limited.  Again, it looks like my TV will just be a TV and it can't replace some of the lighter tasks I was hoping it would.On the same line as the SmartTV.  It doesn't offer Amazon Prime support, Pandora support, and a few other major streaming services.  It would have been great for them to include that, it is what it is.Now probably the biggest issue I have is this.  On Any input that offers a still image with simple lines (think of a colored comic), if you walk up to the television, you will see a very clear ghosting effect.  If you load up Cyanide and Happiness on a black background and that's the only image you have on the screen, look at some of the lines.  It creates a parallel yellow blur to the right of the image.  This to me is a significant problem.  I can deal with the colors being off.  I can deal with a little bit of light bleed around the edges.  But that blur on a still image just makes me think something is wrong with this TV.  Unfortunately, if it's not the technology, it's just the design of the television as a whole.Conclusion:With all of that said, I would in fact recommend the TV to someone who is not nearly as critical as I am.  All of my non-artistic/critical friends love the TV.  It has a very sexy design for a television.  It's glass from edge to edge with a thicker bezel on the bottom.  It's just a very modern design.  The fact that it has built in WiFi and offers NetFlix support is great.  If it offered more streaming sources, I'm sure that would help it more.However, with that said, if you're like critical ol' me and you want your TV to be an extension of your desktop monitor, this is probably not the best choice.  Going Plasma is the only thing you can do to fill in the quality gap.  I tried the 3D, I don't care much for it.  The SmartTV is nice, but my desktop is so close by that it's a non-issue.Alas, there is a final dilemma.  This TV is an incredible value.  The value shopper in me is telling me to keep this TV and get over the things I'm complaining about.  The techy in me is telling me to ditch it and move on.  I am by no measure completely blown away by this TV as all of the review sites stated I would be.  However, I do feel I will settle with this TV.  Comparing everything out there in the LED range, this is easily the best for the price.  While I can get better color and a larger TV if I go for a Plasma, I am not the only one that will be using this TV.  Everyone else that would be using the TV, however, absolutely love it.  The only thing that's left is whether or not the TV can stand the test of time like our old, and still running, plasmas have.", "Date": "August 2, 2012"}, {"Title": "Looks great excellent picture", "Author": "Gary", "ReviewID": "R11E9FAGCMV7P", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I received my T.V. on May 5,in perfect condition via Fedex.

I now have 4 remotes. Ah, well.ORIGINAL REVIEWThe picture quality is very good and the overall design is excellent (exception noted below). The 3D works surprising well for non-native 3D images.A few annoyances:The magic remote is terrible. Out of the box, the cursor would automatically move to the top left corner. Only a power down for 10 min would solve it, and not always. In the past week (I've had the set for 2 weeks now), the \"magic\" cursor doesn't even show up any more and the buttons are extraordinarily laggy. It takes 5-10 button pushes to register something simple like a channel change or power off. LG is sending a replacement, so we'll see.The \"smart\" apps leave a lot to be desired. The Netflix app glitches spasmodically and the software just isn't very polished--searching for a Netflix title is painful (even when the magic remote actually works). YouTube is unusable because of audio sync issues. Aside from Netflix and YouTube, there is a bunch of crapware. The NBA app is a joke with no video highlights. Pair it with Apple TV or Roku for best streaming options.The listed depth of this TV is 1.3\", and it is spectacularly thin... mostly. There is a chunk of black plastic 2 1/4\" deep that cannot be removed. It runs along the entire bottom of the set and houses the speakers. While it probably makes the sound better, it mars an otherwise beautiful thin design.The TruMotion 120Hz feature cannot be turned off in the settings. For some reason, it does look like it can be turned off in the higher end set (LM 7600 with 240 Hz).

This is a fantastic TV overall with cinema screen, it's gorgeous. Great 2D and 3D picture quality with lot of details. Audio quality on this TV is not bad.  I connected this TV to Sony blu ray home theater BDV N790W that has Audio return channel (ARC). Please make sure Simplink is ON and ARC on to get sound thru' home theater. It's a delight to watch 3D movies on this TV with passive glasses with minimum eye strain. 2D to 3D conversion is superb. I would recommend to do a Google search for correct picture settings if you are not happy with your factory settings. Screen uniformity and black levels are good.Remote is a joy to use. Typing is extremely fast comparing to regular remotes. Full web browser works well for almost on all websites, but I did notice some web based video files are not played. DLNA support is good. You tube works great. Netflix streaming is good as well. There are lot of 3D contents in 3D world. Decent amount of apps are available.Screen glare may be an issue if a light source is in front of this TV. I also noticed a small lag when you switch between different screens for example, when you are watching TV and want to go to home menu, it takes few seconds. It's not a major issue, but a minor inconvenience.

DO NOT BUY USED OR LIKE NEW. I bought it used and learned my lesson. It came without the plastic protectors on the side and without the side Styrofoam, yes it came broken on the side. Update this T.V. as soon as you get it to get all the features. Comes standard with 60hz. The update will all the 120hz to be available. For any type of T.V. viewing, this T.V. is great. I did a lot of research and chose this one. The 3D viewing is fantastic and if you have an issue with it you can easily adjust it to make it right for you.  Also, you don't have to be looking at it straight on like most other 3D T.V.s. Video games come in great as well. The LM6700 is great for the pocket book and if I had the money I would have gone for the LM7700 with 240hz but the only time this comes into play is some things while playing video games; no issues with movies. If you are wondering what the difference is,120hz vs 240hz let me clarify, the high speed artificial motions like a football flying in the air on a replay in a video game will not flicker so much with a 240hz T.V. as with a 120hz T.V. It is a minor difference like I said but I know some people are extremely picky. It comes with 6 pairs of 3D glasses. Three boxes with a cleaning cloth in each box. I have had no issues at all with the glasses. At the movie theaters my wife would get headaches watching in 3D but not with this T.V. (same glasses). I have tried the active shutter type T.V.s and glasses and just didn't like how it felt. I got an odd feeling between the eyes like when you hold your finger there without touching. For normal 2D viewing the 1080p is absolutely amazing with movies and video games (no flickering in 2D). Now with all that said, it is a SMART TV. You can spend a couple of hours playing with it and it's apps. It has a landscape app with a fireplace and waterfalls (free) that is impressive. There are games you can play for free and buy to utilize the magic remotes motion control features. I have the internet connected with wireless high-speed N router so the internet portion may be different when connected with a LAN but I doubt it from other reviews I have read. The web browser is lacking speed and you can't download Firefox even though it is android technology.  Forget watching Netflix or Hulu Plus because it will buffer every five minuets. YouTube you have to let it download all of it before you hit play. I have my PS3 connected to the LAN to do all of these things as you can have Amazon Instant on the PS3 unlike the LG T.V. Overall, just a great T.V. for the series that its in and the 3D technology is top of the line. Smart features are really nice and I hope there are more updates to come to enhance the internet use of this T.V. (again not connected to LAN).", "Date": "December 23, 2012"}, {"Title": "Best 3D 55\" Television for the cost", "Author": "Oldtech 45", "ReviewID": "R2VPYBQ9HW0LXD", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "1.

I thought 3D might be mostly a gimmick, but even 3 months after purchasing the TV, I still get excited about 3D movies.The selection of apps is a bit light, but I don't think that's worth taking off even one star. The bottom line is that TVs are never going to offer the up to date apps and features that you can get with an HTPC (Home Theater PC) - and even if they did, nobody would want to use them with a TV remote. Instead of spending a lot more money on a TV that offers something marginally better, spend a little on a Boxee and get not just dozens of functioning apps, but also an easy way to stream wirelessly the media on your computers. That's the setup I use, but I added a 2TB external HDD to the Boxee. Thanks to Boxee, the HDD becomes available on wifi, which means I can save to it directly from my home network.All my TV is streamed - either from Netflix, Vudu, or Amazon. I don't have a cable subscription or even an antenna. So streaming content matters a lot to me. However, TVs are not and may never be as good as a community maintained tool like XBMC (powered by a full feature computer), or even a dedicated media device like Boxee.

The picture quality is fantastic and the sound is more than adequate for my liking.  I'm just not totally sold on the remote.  The concept is good, the fewer buttons the better, but I just don't like the shape of the darn thing.  It's difficult to grasp and it doesn't lie flat very well on a surface.  The volume control is hard to operate and the + and - should be large, highlighted in white, and raised.  The channel button is totally useless, since the cable remote is still needed to change channels.  All of the other functions work fine and I do like the screen pointer, but please LG make a conventional shape remote for us old-timers.With all this being said, I still think the product deserves five stars.  I had pretty much narrowed my choices to Samsung and Sony, but when I read Consumer Report's review of LG I started doing more research into this brand.

Found some great reviews of this TV on TV review websites, saw about 30 great reviews on Amazon, and figured its from LG so it'll likely be good. I don't usually buy products that haven't had MANY positive reviews, but went out on a limb this time.I'm by no means an expert on TV image quality, but to me it looks great. One thing I was concerned about was glowing blacks I've seen at some of my friends' (older) TV's. This set has local dimming. Whether its that or something else, the blacks look great.  Another concern I had was the 120hz giving movies a weird \"too real\" look like I've seen elsewhere. Also not an issue here.As for 3D, I haven't tried it out with any dedicated 3D films. 3D was not a selling point for me on this TV. The 2D->3D conversion works, but I'm old fashioned and prefer to watch plain ol' 2D.The internet/wifi (Smart TV) features are good. Pandora is missing from the lineup of apps, but it seems like overkill anyway to me to have a giant screen displaying images just to get some audio. That's what stereos are for!Lastly, the remote works great in my opinion. If you've ever used a remote for a Wii, its like that. There were lots of complaints with the remote for the LW5600 version of this set.

You really need to do a little homework since the TV alone will not give you the TRUE 3D experience unless you plan on just using it to watch regular television and nothing else. First I ordered myself the LG BD670 3D Wireless Network Blu-ray Disc Player since the current blu-ray will NOT be able to play 3D content blu-ray movies. Per the recommendation of my friend, the first 3D movie I ordered was Tangled (yep it's a Disney movie but it was highly recommended). I made sure to have a couple extra HDMI cables on hand and I was ready. When the TV arrived I was impressed on how lightweight it was. It only weighed 69 pounds compared to my 50\" plasma which weighed 90 pounds. Secondly the TV is so incredibly thin, thank goodness the stand gives it great stability because at first I was concerned it could easily be tipped over.Now time for hooking up all my goodies. I previously had a Wii, Xbox, DVD recorder, DVD Surround Sound Home Theatre and Panasonic Blu-ray Player. Oh what a headache I had trying to connect all these devices back. After eliminating the DVD recorder and two hours later, I finally had everything hooked back up. The major problem is that this TV only comes with ONE set of AV/RCA Component Connection inputs. Luckily my Xbox and new LG Blu-ray player uses HDMI connections but my surround sound system, Wii and DVD recorder uses AV/RCA component connections. I ended up connecting my Wii by just the regular AV/RCA plugs and using the three component connectors for the surround sound. Then I ran the audio in and out from the blu-ray player to the surround sound. By doing this I had to eliminate my DVD recorder and I am not able to use my surround system when just watching regular TV or playing video games. LG should of included at least a minimum of two or more AV/RCA component connections inputs instead of having so many USB inputs. In time I will have to get a newer surround sound system which uses the OPTICAL Digital Audio Output jack technology or HDMI which LG is pushing to use. I did just order the ViewHD Wii to HDMI 720P / 1080P Upscaling Converter, hopefully this will allow me to use the AV/RCA component inputs to hook up the TV to my surround sound. Even though the sound on the TV is pretty good, it would be excellent on my surround sound.I am not going to talk about technical stuff like the Hertz, retina display or resolution - that is not my cup of tea. All I know is that it was extremely easy to setup. The colors are vivid and the picture is crisp and clear. I just love how there is hardly any border around the screen, it might measure about half an inch if I had to guess. One bit of advice, I am all for energy efficiency but make sure to turn off the ECO feature. I was having one heck of a time trying to figure out why the TV's picture would go darker after a bit and then realized it was the ECO feature.The Magic Remote takes some getting to use at first, but you will love it! The scrolling wheel is a great way to quickly jump through the channels or you can use the pop up numeric pad to enter a specific channel. I really was hoping that one remote would control all LG Smart TV devices (SimpLink) but it does not. It will control basic functions such as play, stop, rewind, etc. for the blu-ray player but I still have to use the LG 3D Smart TV Blu-ray player remote for the search feature when using the apps or settings menu on the blu-ray player. Also if you accidentally bumped the remote, the cursor (selection arrow) pops back on the screen and you have to wait 5 seconds for it to disappear by itself. There is no \"exit\" button and you can't \"hide\" the remote to make it disappear on your own.It is true, you can turn any channel from 2D to 3D. It is not going to look like the true 3D from a 3D movie, but the picture will look more vivid and come more to life. I really like how easy it is to turn the feature on and off by the touch of one button which is located on the Magic Remote.Let's talk about the applications. Wowsers - this TV offers so many from the start.  Amazon Video on Demand is an available application as well as all the common ones like YouTube, Facebook, UStream, etc.  There are tons of many other others to chose from.Even though I have pointed out several flaws I found while setting up and using the LG 55\" 3D Smart TV, it is still a beautiful LED television that will leave you breathless when you see it. The ease of use, features, remote and the vividness of the picture is enough to give it 4 stars.EDIT 05/07/12: Wanted to mention that the Wii to HDMI 720P / 1080P HD Output Upscaling Converter worked excellent for eliminating the AV/Component connection for the Wii and using one of the HDMI input on the TV instead.", "Date": "April 27, 2012"}, {"Title": "So Far So Good......", "Author": "S.

Everything is a personal preference but I would highly recommend spending some time calibrating this set once you get it set-up. I was a little worried at first because the picture seemed too dark but I quickly realized that this was the result of the energy efficiency mode being on. Just turning this  off massively changed the viewing experience but after doing a bit of customzied calibration from another website it looks absolutely awesome.I have not tried the 3D yet but, to be frank, I really do not care that much about this feature.

Even standard def DVDs look great (not sure if that's because of the TV, or the upscaling from the Bluray player). The automatic 2D to 3D works surprisingly well, but it's by no means perfect and isn't a replacement for genuine 3D Blurays, but it's fun to play with. It came with 6 pairs of 3D glasses which was nice (they are the simple passive \"sun-glasses\" style glasses, not the bulkier (and more expensive) active style.I was a little worried about reflections from the glossy screen in my livingroom, but reflections are hardly visible, unless you are sitting to where a lamp reflects directly from the screen (I had to relocate a lamp because of that).When I first used the remote, I thought it was great - it acts like a mouse that you move in the air to move the mouse cursor on the screen. But after using it for a while and the novelty wore off, now I'd give up the mouse cursor in exchange for more buttons - it only has buttons for \"Back\", \"Home/Menu\", \"Volume\", and \"Channel\". I wish there were an input-source select button since I switch between input sources a lot (Roku, Bluray, DVD, Cable box), so instead of as simple button press to switch sources, I have to push the menu button, use the pointer to point at the input sources iconand click, wait for the input sources menu to come up, then point at the input source I want and click.I'd rather have 4 buttons so I can just select HDMI 1 - 4. I don't use my TV as a web browser, so the mouse-cursor part of the remote is just not that useful. However one nice thing about the remote is that it's an RF remote, so you don't need to point it at the TV and even if someone is standing in front of the TV it still works.The TV supports HDMI-CEC to allow compatible Blu-ray players and other components to be controlled over the HDMI connection. This works with my Panasonic Blu-ray player, but I already have a universal remote that controls the rest of my devices, so this isn't as useful as it might otherwise be.The biggest shortcoming for me is the lack of Amazon Instant Video built-in to the TV. It has a Netflix app built in (and a whole app store of free and paid games and other useless apps (at least useless to me)), but no Amazon.I was hoping to move the Roku to another TV, but had to keep it on this one to use Amazon. I'll probably end up buying a new Blu-ray player (not LG since their Blu-ray players don't have Amazon either), and use it for Amazon instant video so I can move the Roku to another TV.*UPDATE*They've added an Amazon Instant Video App to the TV, which is nice.", "Date": "February 27, 2013"}, {"Title": "very pleased", "Author": "person", "ReviewID": "R28XC7PKM4AZ2", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I love this tv, excellent picture and sound.  3d tech is by far the cleanest and most eye popping I have seen yet!Do yourself a favor and buy this right now.", "Date": "January 30, 2013"}, {"Title": "Great TV, with annoyances.", "Author": "Mike", "ReviewID": "R3I6D8J6PQQM2V", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "First impressions after a day:LG Cinema 3D is simply amazing, and if you're looking for the best 3D on the market, this is it. Passive 3D IMO is ideal to active, and you can upconvert to 3D, which looks really good most of the time (sometimes it just adds depth). When watching Hulu, the 3D turns itself off every time a commercial comes on, which is annoying to turn back on again and again. Aside from that it's amazing. So far.The TV has a beautiful picture, with lots of options. The bezel is ultra thin and the stand pivots. Everything is brushed metal (or brushed metal-looking plastic), and the whole setup is really sleek. I can fit this 47\" in the same space as my 3y/o Toshiba 37\" since there is virtually no bezel border on the LG. Unfortunately it's a glossy screen so you'll have to cover any windows in its reflective view or just move your setup altogether.Other reviews speak of glitches involving the internet apps like Hulu or Netflix, but immediately upon connecting the TV to my wifi, it downloaded an update. I don't really experience any app glitches other than some minor initial connection issues to Hulu here and there. The hulu app is glitchy in other platforms as well, so I think it's just hulu.The TV speakers are OK, but what are you really expecting from a thin TV? It's not easy to include booming speakers in a 1/2\" space. I have a brand new Sony STR DH720 receiver, and with Audio Return Channel (ARC) enabled on the LG, it sounds great. Unfortunately every 10-30 min the sound cuts out for a second as the receiver re-detects the input. This may not be the TV's fault, but it doesn't happen on anything but the TV input so I'm thinking it is. The glitch occurs only on audio received from the TV into the amp via ARC. I set the audio out to PCM only instead of auto, to no avail. I'll test out more settings and even a higher quality HDMI cable to see what happens. Another problem involving ARC: the provided manual doesn't tell you to turn on \"Simplink\" as well as ARC, and I went crazy trying to figure out what was wrong, including exchanging my receiver and multiple HDMI cables. REALLY annoying issue! The TV has an option to turn on ARC, which you figure would turn it on without enabling some other setting. NOPE.The magic remote is cool, but to me it's yet another remote on the table, and it doesn't have quick keys like pause, play, etc. It also produces a pointer on the screen every time you move the remote, so it shouldn't lay on the couch or anything that easily moves. I have a Blu-link universal remote which controlled everything, including my ps3. It can learn buttons from other remotes, but not the LG magic remote. I will have to buy the Harmony 650 now and return the Blu-link. Another annoyance.All in all it's an awesome TV, with just a few annoying issues.

I despise companies that \"filter\" reviews on their website, not allowing any bad reviews. One only needs to go to their website and see no bad reviews, and compare to all the bad reviews here on Amazon. For this alone, I'll never buy an LG product in the future.First I like the picture quality, the 3D looks great, and the Passive 3D glasses are very comfortable compared to the Sony Active 3D glasses I have tried. I was really impressed the first few days, but now I have had the TV a month, and I am no longer impressed. Had I not won this TV in a sweepstakes, I would have taken it back. As mentioned I've had the set a month, and not a single firmware update.Sadly this set has many problems, many if not all of them could be fixed with a firmware update, but reading some of popular internet forums like AvsForum I hear LG is horrible with firmware updates. There are also many other people reporting issues like the TV just rebooting on it's own, etc. But I am here to post my thoughts on the TV.1> I can't view a Netflix movie without the Netflix app freezing up, requiring a reboot of the TV. My old Sony TV as well as my PlayStation 3 stream just fine, so I know it's the TV. I also have 20meg Comcast/Xfinity so I know it's not a bandwidth issue. I will say one positive thing about the Netflix app is that it supports Closed Captions, which my old Sony set did not.2> Their suggested Plex media server software sucks, it freezes, and simply won't play media or constantly stops, buffers, and then plays, repeat, repeat. These video streams are from sites like Hulu, ABC, Crackle. I have used PlayOn for streaming for years, but when that is running on my computer it causes the Menu system on the TV to freeze, so I have to disable the PlayOn server, and reboot the TV. So now I have no way of streaming TV.3> Poor Korean to English translations everywhere. One thing about Sony, they may be Japanese, but they know where the bulk of their customers are, and work hard to translate things.4> An app store full of worthless apps, so much for a smart TV. Even one of their \"featured\" apps called K-Pop, is geared towards Koreans.5> No music streaming services like Pandora, Google Music, etc.6> After the TV has been running for a while, I sometimes am not able to open the \"Home\" menu to change inputs or what not. So I have to shut the TV off, and back on.7> I wrote their email support, and was told to call. Why even have email support if you're not going to support people. If I wanted to speak to someone in India, about a Korean TV made in China I would have called.8> There is no option to adjust their Trumotion feature.9> Small gripe, but you have to set the time manually, unless you connect to an Over the Air antenna, in this day and age with internet time sync why is this feature left out?10> Final last small gripe, no custom label inputs, thus my PS3 & Xbox are both labeled \"Game\"Well that's about it, hoping for a firmware update soon, but not counting on it.

The cinema view (no frame around the edge of the screen) is very nice, and everyone who sees it notices it right off the bat and makes a complimentary comment.The colors are fantastic, and clarity, too.  One problem with this is that you can TOTALLY tell when a television show is not filmed in true HD (ie 720p instead of 1080p)...so not all \"HD\" channels are truly HD...The remote interface is cool.  Very much like the Wii, it's a point and click, as in you get an arrow that moves around and like a wand, you just aim and click.  There are many apps, including Hulu and Hulu Plus, etc. (They are listed above, so I won't bore you.)  Be aware, if you do not have very high speed internet service, you will have trouble with streaming HD movies.Setting up the WiFi is easy.  Just follow the directions and be sure your router is set to \"pair\".  Be sure you have the WPA code available, too.The sound is great--and I LOVE the option to amp up voices.  I have a problem with my hearing and cannot hear mid-range tones (voices).  I have always had trouble with normal TV's.  Not this one.  Awesome.Watching movies is clear, and the 2D-to-3D feature works amazingly well!  (Better than the new Titanic movie, I can tell you that...the one they just redid in 3D...)  I'm impressed!The 3D movies make you want to reach out and touch someone.  Really.The glasses are really nice!  They are light and you don't realize they are on after awhile.  Unlike the old-school 3D TV's, you don't need batteries.  And getting 6 pair is a super deal.I left it on for hours, to see if it got hot (like some other TV's do).  It did not.  Very nice.Now, the bad...(Yup, there's bad...and no matter what I did, I couldn't get around it.)The black depth could be better.  It's more like dark gray.  I turned off the backlight (it's annoying to me) and still I don't get the depth I'd expect from a TV.When the TV shows a black (yes, dark-gray, but for all intents it \"thinks\" it's black) you see various halos around the screen's edge.  At first there was just one.  Now there are 6.  I called customer service, and they were NOT HELPFUL at all.  I had the TV for a day and called, and still they tried to blame it on using HDMI cables, instead of the supplied component cables.  I switched to component, and the halo was still there.  I switched back and it didn't change.  Nothing to do with cables.  I googled it and it seems that this is a common problem.  But LG threatened to charge me if I asked someone to come check it out.  Not cool.  Even when I told them that I was reviewing it here, they didn't seem to care.Obviously, I am not going to pay to have someone come out...So, the bottom line is that it's a great TV, but not perfect.  If you're into deep colors, you have to really play with it to get it, and still your blacks could be better.  The halos drive me batty, but not enough to get rid of the TV.  They do not show up when there is an actual show on--only when it's a black screen, like the menu or when you turn the cable box off and you get the blank screen.The voice-option makes it a winner to me.

We took 2 pairs of movie theatre 3d glasses and swapped the lenses so you have one pair with 2 left lenses and another with 2 right lenses. Please note that there is a little trimming involved, because you cannot just \"flip\" the lens as the lens is um.... one way. With this there is a small gap in one corner of the transferred lens which doesn't affect game play at all.*the usb supports h.264 mp4's as well as divx which I thought was great. It also powered a 2.5 external drive*the remote... As others have noted, if bumped (after you have set it down) the little arrow will move around the screen, just be aware, however it really isn't that big of a deal.*the remote... I can see some people loving/hating it  I personally think its about time, (who likes pecking up, down, left, right)however,  I do think that a trigger placed on the bottom to \"engage/disengage\" it is the only way that I would change it. Also sometimes when browsing through menus and files there is sometimes a slight delay, although I think that's just Bluetooth, again not really a big deal. You will adapt to using the remote with use.Other thoughts... We found that you have to play with the 3d settings a little based upon weather you are converting 2d to 3d or watching a 3d optimized movies. (for the best results) When using 2d to 3d  change the depth and while watching 3d optimized use the  preset \"cinema\". This seemed to work best.

This TV is frustrating because when viewing a blue ray, it looks unbelievable. Colors are vibrant and you get that pop that you are hoping for when you spend $1500 on a TV. The problem for me is that I am not watching blue rays all day long. We mix up our content from Hulu plus, DirectTV both SD and HD, to playing some Xbox games. The SD content just looks horrible.

HD content was just OK. Xbox games looked pretty nice, and there was only minor lag. Another issue was that the built in apps are nice, but the audio was never in sync with the video. I am truly disappointed that I have to send this one back. I wanted it to be so much better than it actually is.", "Date": "August 29, 2012"}, {"Title": "Perfect Picture at Reasonable Price", "Author": "William Johnson", "ReviewID": "R1Q80H5VKNROJ6", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I've been enjoying this television for a couple of months now and I couldn't be happier.  Great picture and, believe it or not, sound as well.  It arrived in a timely fashion in the manufacturer's carton and damage free.I paid $899.99, on Amazon along with some unexpected free promotions: six additional 3D glasses and a BP620 Blu-Ray 3D player.

When I inquired the customer service rep told me that this was the way they handled \"free\" promotional items.  When I complained, a supervisor resolved it.My best advice for those buying on Amazon - Place the time in your shopping cart and watch it carefully for a few weeks.  I checked it two or three times daily to catch the lowest possible price.  Then when the price drops to something you like, jump on it and purchase.

The Magic Remote is easy and intuitive to use.  The firmware update allowing set top box control works well with DirecTV.  Wifi and network connection is effortless and navigation through all menu's is simple.Although the appearance and features of the TV weighed heavily on my choice to purchase the lm6700, picture quality still holds the trump card.  Additionally, reliability and quality control factor into the choice as well.  I received two 47lm6700 sets.  Both suffered from heavy light bleed in the top left corner.  The second set had a matching affliction in the bottom right corner.  Understanding the light bleed is more-or-less inevitable on edge lit sets, both TVs had an inordinate amount.  In a dim room, with the backlight lowered to 5% (5 of 100), the light bleed was still distracting.  It seems that the I may have received two sets from a defective or bad batch.Taking advantage of Amazon's generous TV return policy, I sent both sets back.  In the end, based on my experience, I was unwilling to take a chance on the LG brand once outside Amazon's 30 day return window.Ultimately, I think the thin bezel series  is a top choice if aesthetics is your primary concern.  However, if picture quality is of greater importance, I would suggest looking at a different brand.", "Date": "August 4, 2012"}, {"Title": "47LM6400 (Costco version). . .Very deep blacks, semi-gloss screen and inumerable settings = great TV", "Author": "Calder", "ReviewID": "R2K2M975MJR042", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Recently we decided to upgrade another one of our flat screen units.  I am a fan of Panasonic products and, despite misgivings after reading some bad press and questioning what I feel is a shady marketing campaign for the set I was interested in - decided to give their VIERA TC-L47E50 a try.  It was a total waste of time.  I then started researching numerous other options.  There are some nice units in this price range, but nothing else I looked at can really match the 47LM6700.  (I have the 47LM6400, but I cannot find any differences between it and the 47LM6700.  Although some charts do not list the same feature sets, everything I subsequently checked appears identical.)At any rate - the tv.  One of the most important features, for me, in LCD/LED performance is the appearance of black levels.  We have a 60\" Sony that does a great job.  This TV may be better.  I would actually describe the black levels as \"inky\" - among the best I have seen on any LCD in this size and price.  While some reviews - such as Digital Trends - have similar opinions, CNET's US site claims black level performance on the 55\" version is lacking.  I am perplexed by CNET's findings and wonder if there might be inconsistencies in these panels.  I can state, unequivocally, that the black levels on my 47\" set impressed me without any calibration, as soon as the set was on.  That isn't to say this set will not benefit from calibration.  The \"cinema\" setting, I think, is fairly yellow, and the \"standard\" setting tends to wash out bright colors.  These are easily corrected through some manual calibration - and this set has a ton of setting options!  It utterly destroys the Panny I tried in regard to its numerous possible picture configurations.The physical frame and screen on this set are beautiful - among the nicest we viewed in the numerous stores we shopped at.  Some higher end Samsungs probably had the closest appearance in terms of body style and presentation, but Samsung is not a brand I am interested in. The LG has a semi-gloss screen.  The gloss can add a bit of depth to the black levels and richness to colors - in the same way the glossy screens on some plasmas enrich the black levels and colors.  I do not think it is a stretch to say the black levels on this set, with additional calibration, can approach a plasma look (though you're unlikely to match a good plasma's black level performance on this or any LCD/LED, just yet).  Despite these positives, the semi-gloss can also be a drawback.  If you are buying this set to place anywhere near a window or bright light source, please keep light reflections in mind.  The semi-gloss screen will readily reflect light sources.The \"magic\" remote is easy to use and functions similar to a wireless mouse.  When we unboxed it I groaned and my wife initially made fun of it. . .but when I started using it I took to it immediately.  It is quite ingenius - but I suspect people will either love it or hate it.  If you prefer a conventional remote you can always program an all-in-one to work with the TV.I hooked this up to a soundbar and stream PCM sound from the set and I have it hooked up to a power saver surge protector with the TV running as the \"master\" controlling the other audio and video components.  The TV has a nice selection of network options, including, of course, Netflix.  Unfortunately, it does not currently come with Amazon's video service.  It also has an on-screen web browser you can use, which I found relatively easy to navigate with the remote.This is a superb set for the price.  You may also want to consider the 47LM7600, which is 240Htz (120 native/240 via software) and available through Amazon.  The 3D is a nice addition and looks fine, though it wasn't a feature I was terribly interested in.  LG wasn't very high on my radar when I started shopping for a new set.  They will be one of the first brands I investigate the next time we buy a TV.", "Date": "August 3, 2012"}, {"Title": "Unbelievable image quality, build quality, thin bezel", "Author": "Sprout", "ReviewID": "R1AO3FB9RGNJ5A", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I've been staunchly holding onto my old Samsung 50\" DLP, replacing the bulb every year or two, simply because I had yet to see an LCD or Plasma screen match the image and color quality of that old DLP.  Well, after receiving this TV, the Sammy was instantly relegated to the garage (I can watch Formula 1 racing while working on my own cars, it makes me feel way cooler than I am).The first thing I noticed was that this TV is very solidly built.  It's heavy, and it feels like a slab of 1\" steel plate (though not quite -that- heavy).  No creaking or flexing of plastic when removing it from the box or putting it on the stand, and it comes with handy edge guards that protect it from bumps while also giving you a more solid grip.  It's also very thin, too, certainly thinner than my old 19\" deep Sammy.  I'll actually need a wall mount or a new TV stand because it looks silly on the Samsung's old pedestal.Plugging everything in is a breeze, lots of HDMI ports, optical audio, and a handy ethernet port (though it's got built-in wifi).  Turning the TV on, I finally experience the thin bezel around the screen.  At sitting distance, it almost looks like the image is floating in the air, the frame around it is thin enough to blend in, which does actually make the viewing experience slightly more immersive.LG's interface software, and its cool motion-controlled remote (think like the Wiimote) is pretty stunning.  I use a Google TV box so I haven't played with the LG's software options too much, but from what I could tell it is supremely usable.  It will even stream media from your network with hardly any setup, though I can't speak to the formats it plays well with.The overall image quality is stunning, I don't know a better way to describe it.  The color and lighting is smooth, but the details are sharp, there's no grainieness, the blacks are truly black without any weird halo effects that I could see.  LG really does make some of the best panels out there.The 120hz upsampling of standard TV is...neat.  It's very effective, it really does make things seem super smooth which might be an advantage for sports.  It's hard to get used to, and it took me a while to figure out why everything felt off to me when watching normal programming, but it's easy to turn off, you can even reduce the intensity of it to get -some- smoothing without going overboard.  Higher framerates are the wave of the future (already standard in Europe), so I guess I should be trying to get used to it, but it makes everything feel like a soap opera!I didn't have a terrible amount of luck with the 3D, but I never really do.  I'm glad they're passive glasses, though, and they don't seem to reduce brightness too much if at all.  There's an option to have the TV try to convert -everything- to 3D, which is actually hilarious, things pop in and out of plane, people's faces go from normal to inverted (i.e. their facial features actually go inward toward their face), we actually had a pretty good laugh at it until the headaches started, but what can you expect from a TV trying to convert a 2D image into full 3D?  Not happening.Anyway, it's a fantastic TV, thin, thin bezel, gorgeous image quality, lots of options, built in software for all sorts of stuff, sturdy build quality...

Except, it's not. We've taken to watching You Tube shows, but forget it on this TV.  A 30 minute episode on YouTube locks up the TV forcing me to have to reboot. Netflix works okay for a while, then stutters. I tried to use the Mog app to listen to music, and it shut down after a song or two at most. If I had to guess, I would say the CPU can't handle these apps. Our $99 Logitech Revue handled all of these just fine though. Just to be safe, I moved my router downstairs and tried it both wireless and wired. The wired connection kept dropping - though I can't say whether that was my router or the TV. Otherwise though, it had no effect on the TV's performance.Basically, as a TV it's a pretty good device. As an internet connected smart TV...even 3 stars is probably a little generous.

This tv is a computer and a TV. 3D is awesome. It looks cool even when not on. I download a free app for my cell phone to work the tv. Its way cool and nobody in the room knows why the volume is changing...I have the 55\" for the money this tv is up there with techno and will be a contender for years to come.

It is the prettiest TV I've ever seen.The picture - after calibration using CNET settings, and TURNING TRUMOTION OFF - is very beautiful. You'll see every pimple and wrinkle on characters' faces.Add a decent soundbar, like the LG NB3520A, and you'll never want to be away from your TV.THE BAD:1. The Smart TV features are virtually unusable. The \"magic remote\" is hard to use (and I say this as someone who has an XBOX, PS3, and Wii), and Amazon Instant Video is missing.2. 3D movies look like they were shot by a soap opera or reality TV show crew. That's true for LCD/LED TVs in general.But the cons are easily overcome.1. Just get a Roku, and put the magic remote in a drawer somewhere.2. 3D is more of a gimmick than something you can enjoy on a daily basis. If you want to show off 3D to your friends, use IMAX documentaries, which look fantastic, especially Deep Sea. If you want to avoid the soap opera effect altogether, you'll just have to skip LCD/LED TVs and buy a bulkier plasma.Overall, I'm thrilled with my purchase.

After a lot of research and almost pulling the trigger on the LG Cinema Screen 47LM6200 47-Inch I was pleased to get this at $999.99 on a great sale.  It is worth more considering the features and looks great.  Looks great and the surround makes this TV, I would not buy a TV that has a large surround (bezel?), this one looks great. Unless you want glass to the edge, this looks like a floating picture as far as I am concerned and would not pay more to have less, this one is perfect.  The 120Hz has no lag and the colors are amazing.  The 3D feature that allows you to watch anything converted to 3D is a novelty, but fun.  My family has watched two movies in 3D so far and it isn't like the movies, but to have it at such a great price it well worth it in my opinion.  I bought an accompanying LG 3D DVD player for it as well (also at a great price), and have been very happy.  Setting up was fairly quick, but software had to update, so be prepared to wait hours possibly, I let it run overnight.  Some reviewers rated the remote control poor, but it isn't.  It takes a little to get used to and LG now offers an on screen App for almost every cable provider. I just programmed my FIOS remote to do everything, but it works fine.  Internet was something I wanted, but haven't used much.  It works pretty quick with our wireless router and I would not buy a TV without it.PROS:ColorSoundRefresh RatePicture qualityEase of useCONS:Set-up due to software updates)A little more glare when I had it in a birhgt room initially, but have since moved it to a darker room and it is amazingRecommend checking this out in a store, you will fall in love with it and is worth it over the 47LM6200 if you can get it at the right price.3 months in and Loving IT!LG Cinema Screen 47LM6700 47-Inch Cinema 3D 1080p 120Hz LED-LCD HDTV with Smart TV and Six Pairs of 3D Glasses", "Date": "August 1, 2012"}, {"Title": "Great Set!", "Author": "dbrozes", "ReviewID": "RYAQY2Y6CYZMV", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "The set took a little while to get use to, but the quality is remarkable.

The picture is beautiful and the 3D works really well! I had to do quite a bit of tinkering to get the desired picture but once I found the sweet spot its been nothing short of awesome. This piece is also really beautiful and looks amazing in my bedroom. When and if I decide to mount the TV on the wall I can only imagine how incredible this will look! I would without hesitation recommend this TV to anyone I know and for the price point at around 1000.00 ( give or take 100.00 or so depending on the day of the week ) this is a no brainer. Amazon is also the greatest online site in the world. They did a price match for me based on a one day sale at another site and the price I paid is almost criminal.One more huge props for Amazon... I was hooking up a new Blu Ray player and noticed a small area at the bottom of the bezel that was slightly bent. I was bummed as I'm an electronics nut and like everything to be perfect. I contemplated starting the return process for a new unit but the thought of having to disassemble the base and then repack the unit was giving me second thoughts. I decided that I would go through the hassle of returning and contacted Amazon. The customer service person I was dealing with was amazing. She told me they would gladly replace the TV but they couldn't guarantee the replacement would be perfect either. This is not an Amazon issue. The new LG TV's are so thin that the box that houses the TV is not very thick. Apparently there has been quite a few issues with shipping damage on these new LGs. She said they were doing research on how to ship them more efficiently. She then asked if the dent was in any way causing an issue with functionality of the TV, I told her not at all. She then offered me a 15% discount on my purchase price if I'd like to keep the television. Are you kidding me! I accepted as the dent / bend is really only visible if your looking at the TV from the side and still Is small enough that I'd have to point it out if you weren't looking closely. In the end I have a fantastic TV for an unbelievable price from a tremendous company. Amazon will begin charging tax in CA next month. I always thought the day that happened I'd be pretty much through with them. Not anymore... The customer service I received was world class and I will now gladly pay the extra 8.75%  for that alone.

I'm happy with my purchase and won't return it, but I can see saving myself a few hundred bucks and skipping the extras I already know I will rarely use.  The 3d conversion is a cool gimmick but for the eye strain it doesn't really give you much after a few minutes of showing it off to your friends.  Internet ready TVs are new to me, and its cool because you can update the firmware via wifi, and run your favorite internet apps like netflix without any box or extra piece....but everything is becoming a netflix receiver and most likely you're going to hook one up anyways (the free bluray player for example.)  Also you have a computer to browse the internet, you're not going to use your television with no keyboard and a goofy mouse remote.Then again, bragging about how many features your TV has may be worth the extra few hundred dollars.I was going to dock one star for the weird remote, but I don't want to harp on companies trying new ideas, even if they are just robbed from a video game system.

This television is still being sold and advertised as WIDI compatible - but if you run anything more current than Windows 7, you are out of luck - LG refuses to update their firmware, and so the WIDI feature is useless.You CAN NOT stream HULU, You-Tube, etc. through the web-browser - those will only work through the subscription services - or, through WIDI, by using your laptop.

The design-style is definitely spelling High-End...frameless with all brushed metallic finish and no cheap shinny black plastic in sight!

The picture quality is amazingly clear and the 3-D effect is great although the 2-D to 3-D conversion may need some setting adjustments to suit personal taste but still effective in general! There are many 3-D short videos already loaded in this TV so, I can watch them for free (for awhile, any way). The smart remote will need some practice....it works fine (as a mouse or a TV remote control) but can be tricky! It can definitely be improved by adding few more buttons for more conventionally operations.... its flush-mounted buttons look good but not user-friendly. The TV's internet browser is basic and works fine in most cases but, don't compare it to a regular PC or Mac....Cons: Again, the smart remote is not as straight forward as the conventional ones...some simple operations may take few more steps than the regular remote. The weakest part is there is no detailed instructions to tell you how to make all those setting fine-adjustments (in case if you don't like the pre-set colors, etc.)....you just have to play with it and experience all that by yourself.Other Thoughts: I have got 2 other LG HD TV's and they all represent great value with great quality. In general, this one will rated as a great high-end TV with amazing design-style and picture-clarity...especially, if you can get it on a special.

The silver bezzel is very small and looks awesome.  The picture is great in dark rooms but the glossy screen  gives trouble in bright rooms.  What good are dark black levels when the glossy screen just replaces dark scenes with a mirror right back at you?  But most new TVs have glossy screens so it is on par.  My 5 year old Toshiba LCD had a worse picture but at least it has a matte screen.  It took me a few days to get the picture settings adjusted just right.  I found that the energy saving mode needs to be set at a minimum of around 40 or higher.  Any lower and it starts messing with the colors.  I see very good color reproduction and very good black levels.  No light bleed through.  White screens like ice hockey do show the screen brightness is not uniform and makes me wish I had bought the next step up in quality.  Sometimes I will see some jaggies which I'm looking for a setting to adjust.  I see this because I am looking at screen quality but my wife who knows nothing of these details is absolutely amazed at the picture.  The Smart TV features are great too.

Personally, I've been blown away by the performance of this product.  This is the first LG product I've owned and it is on par with the higher end Samsung and Sony LCDs out there.  We've had no problems with the tv whatsoever.At first we had to get used to having our television on a smaller base.  There was worry that the kids running near it or moving too fast would cause the television to shake and possibly tilt. Thankfully this has not happened and it was a matter of getting used to the design as opposed to poor design.  Also, this design makes it super easy to dust/clean behind the television. That's been a nice bonus for me.Set up was easy and everything was basically ready to go out of the box.  Programming the cable control was no issue.  The actual remote to the television takes some getting used to because it acts more like a wand than a traditional remote control.  It is necessary to point to an item on the screen before clicking as opposed to pointing a remote in the general direction and clicking that way.  Not a deal breaker though and fairly easy to get used to.The picture is great and the television is very sleek, slim, and lightweight for the 55-inche size.The sound from the speakers is better than any television we've had in the past.  Usually, the volume is under level  12- the sound is that clear.  There have been difficulties with the volume levels when streaming Netflix.  Adjusting the sound settings corrected the problem.The wifi features work perfectly and having easy access to Netflix is a plus since that is one thing we use often in the house.  I've experienced far less lag than I did when trying to stream Netflix through the Xbox 360.Gaming looks insane on the TV.  My son loves using the 2D to 3D feature to view some of his games in.  Overall this feature works really well.  We actually use the television as 2D more often than 3D but I cannot wait for football season to start and watch my games in 3D!The 3D glasses that come with the television are okay.  They are easily replaceable and won't cost a fortune if something happens to them.  They aren't fancy but they do the trick and it's nice to have 6 pair so that the entire family can watch a movie at the same time.If I had to go out and buy a new television tomorrow, this would be my first choice.

Both worked out surprisingly well. In the full sunlight situation, I found that I preferred to set the screen to use LG's Intelligent Sensor. Yes, the screen was very bright and fought off glare well, and yes the picture was a bit oversaturated and the colors weren't perfectly accurate, but you can't ask for perfection in those kinds of lighting conditions. At night, the picture was truly great. I found that the Intelligent Sensor made the picture too dark in these conditions, but found that the Cinema (?) setting worked wonderfully. I definitely prefer a warmer picture to a cooler picture, and the Cinema setting is perfect for that. Other things:1. The magic remote takes a little getting used to, but I really like it. The only concern is adding another remote into the mix, and I'm not sure how well that functionality would transfer to a universal remote.2. In terms of apps, most are redundant as I have a WDTV Live and a PS3 hooked up, but the Hulu Plus and Netflix apps worked perfectly for me (via WiFi).3. More about the picture, I sent back a Samsung UN46EH6000 in return for this LG because the Samsung was having some subtle issues with color reproduction and flashlighting. The Samsung was driving me crazy because it was so close to being really good, but the subtle flaws meant that I was looking for them rather than just enjoying the content. The LG was nearly perfect in these regards! Very, very subtle edge bleed in completely black frames, but no flashlighting and really excellent color reproduction.4. Obviously, the TV itself looks fantastic.5. Some may notice that TruMotion on this model is not adjustable! LG has reportedly promised to add this adjustment in a future firmware upgrade, but to be honest, I can wait. Motion looks extremely well represented on the TV as is, another stumbling point for the Samsung.6. I haven't really tried out the 3D, other than using the 3D button to up-convert 2D programming. It looked OK, but I've never really been a big fan of 3D. Perhaps I'll give it another shot with actual 3D content.7. The one con I have come across so far is that one of the HDMI ports was cutting in and out. I attribute this to a very thick and sturdy HDMI cable because after replacing the cable, the port worked fine. I would point out though that the ports are a bit flimsy with a little more flex than I would like. It could be an issue as the TV ages.Overall, at the current price, this TV is pretty much a no-brainer in my opinion. 4.5 *'s.Update (06/08/12): Now this TV is selling for $899.99! That is a fantastic price on an excellent TV. If you're in the market for a TV at this size, there's no reason not pull the trigger now.Update (06/18/12): Just wanted to let people know that I called Amazon and they gave me a refund based on the price at the time for this TV. The price dropped to $899.99 from the $999.99 and they agreed to credit my card for the difference.", "Date": "June 6, 2012"}, {"Title": "Beautiful picture", "Author": "M. Kooiman \"nerdette\"", "ReviewID": "R373TN5UQNW634", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I couldn't be happier with this TV.  The picture is crisp and bright, not at all fuzzy.  You can watch normal TV all day.  My mother even commented the day after we set it up that she watched all her old favorite movies all day because the picture was so clear and pretty.  It comes with 6 pair of the 3D glasses and they aren't the super expensive type of glasses you need with some of the other 3D TVs that are out there.  The TV was easy to add to my already existing home entertainment system.  I just plugged the HDMI cable into the TV (access is on the side instead of making me feel around on the back of the set).  The remote control is, umm, different.  It works sort of like a WII controller.  When it moves, the TV senses it and a cursor shows up on the screen.  This is great when you want to do something with the remote and not so nice if you are lying on the sofa and have the remote beside you.  The remote was also designed to be comfortable in the hand.  I can understand this design in a game controller but for the TV remote it just makes it awkward when setting it on a table.  It also takes some getting used to moving the cursor around on the screen to select what you want to do.Since this TV came from Amazon, I feel like I should say something about the delivery process.  Amazon does not use US Mail or UPS for this delivery.  It was a professional delivery company (as opposed to package or mail delivery) and they called a few days in advance to schedule the delivery.  They showed up in the first part of the delivery window and carried the TV to the room that I indicated and then set it up and tested it for me.  They were polite and professional.Finally, 3D.  I learned something here.  I went out and purchased Thor 3D so I could properly test this TV.  I was so excited until I saw the blue screen telling me that my Blue Ray player could not play 3D movies.  Mind you, I bought the Blue Ray player in November so I would have one that could access Amazon Prime movies so I was really disappointed that I wasn't going to get to watch Thor in 3D.  However, I did watch the 2D version of Captain America using the 2D-3D feature.  It was \"okay\", not great.  Obviously the scenes that were designed to jump out at you really didn't but the TV did a decent job of creating a 3D effect with many of the shots.  My recommendation is that if you are going to spend money on a 3D TV, get the 3D capable player at the same time.", "Date": "May 17, 2012"}, {"Title": "Amazing picture, love the remote, User Guide leaves a little to be desired - Dock 1/2 Star", "Author": "Robert A.

My wife and I are thrilled, with the quality of the picture.During the setup I was unable to get my external Bose speaker system to work with the TV (it was working fine with the 55\" Toshiba Regza that was there before) and the Owner's Manual was no help, thus the knock down of 1/2 a star. I'm confident I'll get it to work in time but the logical outputs on the back or side of the TV don't exist though they do exist according to the manual and the on screen set up (one can choose between external or internal speakers).The remote control that's provided with the TV is very slick. It's like a WII controller. It takes a little getting used to but it wasn't long before I decided I really liked it. It's a \"minimalist\" remote and only has three or four buttons in addition to the volume and channel selector. Instead, one hit's the menu button and uses the controller to wand to a number of options, such as HDMI input. One can also turn on and off the TV's built-in 3D converter. The converter is converts regular 2D TV to 3D and is suprisingly effective.The sound quality of the internal speakers are fine but certainly don't hold a candle to the Bose so I'm a little disappointed with the current set up.", "Date": "April 26, 2012"}, {"Title": "Great TV!", "Author": "paul", "ReviewID": "R1JF0JRLHX9WNW", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Received this TV on 3/26 and have had it wall mounted and up and running on 3/27.

It's extremely bothersome and as I mentioned, tv loading time on home screen is ridiculous.

Coming from a 42\" Sharp Aquos that I had for quite a few years, I was stunned at how nice the picture quality on the LG was. It was an improvement in all areas: brightness, contrast, color accuracy, motion. Truly outstanding.In the process of installing it, it also became very apparent at how much thinner and lighter televisions had become in recent years. There is almost no bezel on the side. It is really a bit shocking when you first see it, but it makes for a fine aesthetic touch.The 3D features are quite good. This unit comes with six (6) pairs of passive glasses. This should be more than enough for a typical family, and we still have two of them in the boxes as spares. The 3D effect is adjustable to suit your tastes. Unfortunately, there isn't a whole lot of good 3D content out there yet. Before you judge it, be sure to check out a good 3D movie on Blu-ray. The effects are much more noticeable and brilliant there than they are on the DirecTV channels.Sound is acceptable, especially considering how thin this TV is. If you want big, movie-theater sound, get a proper sound system. Otherwise, this is fine for most purposes.The remote control takes a lot of getting used to. It works a bit like a Wii remote. Very few buttons, which at first was frustrating, but you get used to it quickly. There are two issues that I've found with the remote:1. It tends to be a bit inconvenient to switch inputs. Click the input button, select the input selection screen on the menu, scroll to the input, click it, and then you are done. I find it slower than what I'm used to.2. Sometimes, the volume buttons on the remote seem to stop working until I restart the TV. Seems to happen more often if you try changing the volume after not using the remote for a few hours.As of August, I've developed a big problem with the screen. The lower third of the screen has become unusable. There is a line of green pixels that goes from one end to the other. Everything below that is missing every other line, and the screen updates seem \"delayed\".

I love the power savings. *****A recent update allows the user to turn off 'True Motion'***** this is great as 120Hz looks weird to me and many others plus I've noticed a tiny issue dropping or stuttering frames every 10 seconds with certain content when it's on.Count me among those that don't like the remote. The motion control makes the experience slower and clunkier than a standard remote with the added hassle of a big arrow popping up in the middle of the picture every time you bump into it. The design also makes it difficult to do much without looking. I can feel my way around the basic function of all of my other remotes.These complaints are really minor quirks and I would recommend this model to anyone as it does what I need it to do- display video very well and looks very sexy on the wall doing it.

I'm having a very difficult time getting the calibration correct on this set. I'm currently using a PS3 with a 120hz HDMI cable to this set and the movies still look blurry and grainy. I've tried turning \"Real Cinema\" on and off, Smooth edges, etc but no dice. PS3 Games like BF3 just don't look right, very jagged edges and noticeable blur. I've also messed with the settings using ISF mode to customize as much as possible but no dice here as well. I've compared this set with a Samsung 42 (sorry don't know the model #) LCD and it blows this set out of the water as far as Blu-Ray viewing and PS3 Battlefield 3 gaming. The movies on this Samsung set has very smooth edges and no blur whatsoever, I guess because owners of the Samsung can turn 120hz on or off.Cable - HDTV viewing -Now this is where I think the T.V fails for me big time, maybe I'm just being too picky with the issues called out above but here is where this set in my opinion lacks. I watch sports, mainly NBA. I have my HD cable box going to the set via HDMI and there's soo much blur that I'm having seconds thoughts and probably will return this set if I cannot get the calibration correct. I bought this set to replace my Panasonic Viera 50 inch plasma and I may have to put it back up to watch sports because I can't stand the grainy, blurry motions with the LG.If anyone out there had issues similar to mine but has since resolved them or has some suggestions on how to calibrate this set for Blu-Ray viewing/Gaming/HD Sports, please reply to my post. I'm also going to try and switch out the cable box with a \"120hz\" set top and see If it improves.I have not had a chance to really test out the 3D but when I do I will update my post.--UPDATE--I'm returning the set Monday. The picture is horrid, especially for HD sports. I did as much calibration as I could in the 2 weeks that I had it setup and there's soo much blur. Purchased quality HDMI cables (120hz) and nothing I did helped the picture. Blu-Ray movies look okay but Samsung or Panasonic sets blow this out of the water.

The LM6700 has a lot of things to like in both performance and features, and in many ways it a very thought-out television.Picture Quality - For our basic TV watching we use a Tivo HD, which has a maximum resolution of 1080i. This seems to be ok for our 46\" Samsung LED TV, but the larger 55\" begins to show some picture degradation. Obviously, this is not the fault of the TV - just an observation. When watching Blu-rays you will notice that the picture quality is considerably better (the blu-rays are in 1080p). Also, the use of the 3D mode seems to help make the TV sharper, and really seems to maximize the capabilities of the unit.Brightness - This probably should fall under picture quality, but the LG LM6700 is not very bright. It is noticeably darker when compared to our Samsung 46UN8000. The claim is that this helps save electricity, but I am not sure if I buy that argument since all LED TVs will be energy efficient. The overall lack of brightness is my biggest overall beef with the LM6700 and is the reason for me taking off 1/2 star.3D Effect - To repeat a central theme - it is very easy to use. The passive 3D glasses means no batteries and no need to sync them with the TV. It also makes them lighter and easier to wear for extended periods. The 3D performance is nice and controllable, it may be a little less pronounced than the active shutter glasses - but honestly it won't make much of a difference. Another nice feature is they are much cheaper than active shutter glasses. The only issue is that the LM6700 lacks the brightness to be totally effective in 3D unless you are in a rather dark room.Remote - This is really a coo feature of the LG LM6700 TV, although not everyone will like it. The LM 6700 features a *Wii-like* magic remote that operates more as a point-and-click pointer than a traditional remote. It does take some time getting use to, but it does make it much faster to zip through menus and applications.Applications - Still a work-in-progress. At the time of this writing the MLB application still is not functional. Also, the YouTube menus could be made MUCH more user friendly (it is a shockingly bad interface when you consider the use of the point-and-click remote). However, the apps are *Grandparents Ready* easy to use simply push one button and then point to the app of your choice. While some apps are still missing (such as Amazon) I am sure that the next few months will bring the full spectrum.Sound - Not a booming sound system - but I would not expect it to be, since it is only about an inch thick. I will say that it does sound better than my Samsung 46UN8000 TV, so the sound is by no means a dog. In addition you also have an optical output for a direct output into your home stereo system.Network - Easy access to an LAN cable or the LM6700 is shipped with wireless capability.Other Features - 4 HDMI inputs - 3USB inputs - 1 optical output - 1 component input - and 1 monitor input.Final Verdict - If the LM6700 was about 30% brighter I would give it a full 5 star rating, but.... it is not. I love all of the features, including the ease of use in selecting apps so I can still give it a very healthy recommendation. The LM6700 offers a nice package of picture quality, 3D performance, and affordability.4 1/2 Stars", "Date": "April 29, 2012"}, {"Title": "slow and defective features tv", "Author": "Guyen \"gg\"", "ReviewID": "R3H6GP1543KMKL", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "Have been using it for over 3-4 months lot of defects. fails to connect to wireless or sometimes it takes too long to connect.You tube app comes with TV is a crap: hard to navigate, extremely sluggish response and lot of times, videos will not play at all and this leaves user very frustrated.Overall tv response to remote is very slow as it struggles to show various user interfaces.

Morgan", "ReviewID": "R12F5FM2ZX7SF", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I've had this TV 3 weeks. I am very pleased with this purchase. The picture quality was decent straight from the box. The built in picture setting wizard made the picture better. After calibration using Disney WOW the picture is amazing. The television has wonderful color representation. Crisp and clear display. Yes it does have a glossy screen but I actually prefer this as I feel it provides better PQ, assuming you can manage light sources. The remote is easy to learn and use. I do wish they offered a way to turn the remote \"off\" because any movement or bumping of the remote does activate the on screen pointer. I have little use for most of the apps that are with the TV. I've heard some are buggy but that a firmware update is due any day to address these issues. I've had no problems with flash lighting. The brightness is sufficient for daylight viewing. The menus are easy to navigate. I've even found that my Dish Network remote will work the TV. I can even change the input source by pressing the input source button repeatedly; it will cycle through the available options.My only word of caution is about Amazon's choice of shipping. My TV was shipped via CEVA Logistics. This has been nothing short of hysterical on how incompetent this company has been.First TV was shipped but never arrived. Tracking showed it was delivered to a local company for final delivery. Local company received invoice but not TV. CEVA unable to locate TV so Amazon ships a second TV.

This delays delivery 1 week while they work to get the TV where it was supposed to be shipped. I contacted Amazon who assured me they would contact CEVA to expedite. Next day I get a call from CEVA asking if they could deliver the TV tomorrow. I figured Amazon got on them about their incompetence and they were working hard to get the TV to me quickly. Next day comes and I get a call from the delivery driver stating he is 20 minutes out. 5 minutes later I get a call from a local freight company seeking to schedule delivery the next week, when I tell them the driver called and is now 15 minutes out she stated my TV was still sitting on their dock. Confused to say the least I told her I would call her back. 15 minutes later the TV arrives. Works perfectly and delivery is without issue. Paperwork shows tracking number for third shipment, however TV has sticker with tracking number of first (lost) TV. Needless to say I called the company back and told them to return their TV to Amazon since I already had one. In all it took almost 1 month to get a working TV to my house. Amazon customer service was great and provided credits for the inconvenience. This in no way affects my review of the TV itself, just beware that CEVA will likely deliver your TV and be prepared for possible incompetency's from them. Track your shipments and contact Amazon with any problems or delays, they will help much more than CEVA will.", "Date": "May 29, 2012"}, {"Title": "Not what I had hoped for", "Author": "BW", "ReviewID": "R1TS2628P0ZT51", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I conducted a lot of research on this TV before I purchased it, and couldn't wait to get it out of the box and set up.  I am giving this TV 3 stars overall because it does have some nice features and was simple to set-up.  The \"professional\" reviews about the 3D were true in that it is excellent.  It is probably the best 3d I have ever seen on a television.  However, I was very unhappy with the picture quality of this set.  I tried my best to calibrate the picture to bring the quality out as much as possible, but the picture was grainy and had a washed out look to it on almost everything.  The black levels were also very poor.  I currently have a 46\" Samsung LCD, and the picture quality blows the LG away.  As stated in some reviews, there was also a glare with this TV that made it difficult to watch in brighter rooms.  I found this set on sale for $999, and would have really like to hold on to it because of the price, but just couldn't get over the PQ on it to be completely satisfied.  If you are looking for a set that has nice features, great 3D and decent PQ, then this is the TV for you.  Otherwise, if you like crystal clear picture and deep blacks, i would not suggest buying it.  I have seen a lot of reviews where people strongly dislike the remote.  I will admit that the remote took some getting used to, but it really isn't too bad.  The only aspect of the remote that I found troubling is that when you are watching something, every time the remote is bumped, the cursor will show up on the screen.

When someone or something is moving onscreen I'm often clearly seeing distortion around that figure. I believe someone else here suggested this model is NOT running at 120Hz but rather 60Hz. Perhaps that's why I see such distortion.I could cite some positives about this model but why would anyone want to watch distorted figures moving about? This by itself makes me want to pass on this LG model and at $1000 such a serious defect is unacceptable.I kept this model for almost a full month and nothing I did improved the poor picture quality. If others don't see this distortion then they should be thankful they recieved quality units, because I most certainly did not.We also have a 26-inch LG model that has been of very good picture quality, so it would seem it just depends on the specific model sometimes.", "Date": "July 23, 2012"}, {"Title": "Great Professional Review here", "Author": "TheGraz", "ReviewID": "R2HXXR8OCKHTAY", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Great review from the Pros here.

Compared to my Toshiba and the older (one yr) LG, this TV is not good at all, in terms of picture quality. I believe LG cut cost by reducing the quality of the most important hardware component controlling the refresh rate. Although the model says it is 120Hz, the hardware is configured to deliver only 60Hz, as pointed out by many reviewers (you can check the manual as well - towards the end technical specs are given and refresh rate is 60Hz). This makes it as cheap as other 60Hz TVs, which you can buy from other discount electronic stores (except it has other 'gadgets' such as 3D, Smart TV features, etc.).  Please remember that you would not be watching 3D and use Smart features all the times (or you may be) - I assume you want to watch regular TV programs as well. So, if you are not 'used to' seeing `real' 120Hz TVs, this may not make a difference, but if you have seen other 120Hz or 240Hz TVs, then this TV will make a big difference in picture quality. Additionally, why would you pay for 120Hz when you are actually getting a 60Hz TV? Picture quality seems blurry (relative) and also sports programs will not be as crisp as a 120Hz TV. I hear that folks are 'waiting' for an enhancement from LG, but obviously LG will not upgrade the hardware - only firmware (programming) 'may be' upgraded to simulate 120Hz (do not know when, or it will be - so why take the chance).Anyway, I did not like the idea of LG actually giving a 60Hz TV and claiming it to be 120Hz with added 'gizmos', which is not what one would use while watching regular program. I am very disappointed and returned the TV, and now considering to get the previous model (which I believe came with actual 120Hz hardware).Hope this helps you to decide and good luck!", "Date": "July 3, 2012"}, {"Title": "I want to love this tv, but...", "Author": "Mec6288", "ReviewID": "R1DR98TBKX3PZQ", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I want to love this tv, but it has some serious flaws.

I figured you have two choices:1. Listen to a bunch of other subjective 4 and 5-start reviews from people who own the TV and have a stake in making themselves feel better about what they bought.OR2. Actually look at objective, measurable test results in aforementioned reviews that prove the TV is sub-par in the picture quality areas that matter most: black levels and contrast.Original Comments BelowI rated this TV two stars. The main reasons being poor black levels and poor contrast.To put it bluntly, the picture on this TV is sub-par in dark scenes (and in some bright scenes as well). That stinks if you enjoy watching a variety of movies. Try watching any movie with a lot of dark scenes (Batman, The Crow, Dark City, etc.) and you'll see what I'm talking about.I had high hopes for this TV after reading positive reviews of last year's model, but apparently this year's model doesn't perform as well, which is too bad for LG. It will probably be the last time I buy one of their products for awhile.Also, the Netflix app decided it would only work half the time, which is unacceptable, especially on a TV which is connected via wireless to the internet. Push out an update that fixes the issue, please.On the upside, this TV has a nice physical design, and has a lot of features built-in. However, what do you a buy a TV for? The bells and whistles, or a good picture for the price?Finally, the remote is gimmicky and annoying. A neat concept, but it really needs a lot more thought put into the design and usability, which leads to a lot of annoyances. If you own it you know what I'm talking about, and if you buy it you'll find out.My advice? Buy a different TV and forget about supposed 3D performance as a primary concern. 3D will likely be a small fraction of your TV watching, and the novelty wears off quickly.Here's the replacement I purchased after reading reviews: Panasonic VIERA TC-P50GT50 50-Inch 1080p Full HD 3D Plasma TV Excellent TV, AMAZING picture, overcomes a lot of the past downsides of plasma TVs, e.g. placing in moderately lit rooms.", "Date": "June 4, 2012"}, {"Title": "Nice Picture But beware of LG customer service", "Author": "B.

Came home late after work and turned it on at 9 PM by 10:30 PM the LED arrays are shot and the screen went dark.  The place I ordered it from won't take it back and I'm stuck with a technician coming to fix it this week.  The TV lasted less than 2 hours!!!!STAY AWAY!!!**UPDATE** Had to dispute with AMEX and Buydig eventually sent me a replacement.  Still the picture is okay.  I'm not blown away.  Should have looked at it at a store before buying it.  Even when it's functional I'm not impressed.  Can you say buyers remorse?", "Date": "March 10, 2012"}, {"Title": "rolled out too soon", "Author": "Jman", "ReviewID": "R6PWJKV9QI24R", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "Nobody knows how to make a 3D tv work.

It is pretty small, about 3/4 inch on the left and 3/4 inch on the right,  and 3/4 inch on top, but it is there nonetheless. LG is trying to make it look like there is not bezel, but there is. Also it does not come with a regular remote with numbered buttons and whatnot like last years model, only the gimicky magic remote.", "Date": "March 2, 2012"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "$1,749.99", "Features": null, "Name": "LG Cinema Screen 47LM6700 47-Inch Cinema 3D 1080p 60Hz TruMotion LED-LCD HDTV with Smart TV and Six Pairs of 3D Glasses (2012 Model)", "ImgURL": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/31d1ccU0EdL._SX300_.jpg", "ProductID": "B006ZH0KJS"}}
