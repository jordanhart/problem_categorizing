I have purchased a few other TV's in the past few months & all of them had to be returned because of defects.  This Panasonic is PERFECT!  I could not ask for more.  I do not have a DVR, Cable, Satellite or any of that high tech technology.  I just have a plain antenna and receive local channels & it works Great.The picture is bright & colorful and the 32\" size works for me as I live in a 1 br apt & use it in my living room.  It is my only household TV.  If I could have afforded a larger one I would have gotten it, but this is fine.  PLUS, I saved $152.00 by purchasing it from Amazon and received it in ONE DAY!  The sound is good also.I watch a lot of movies and stream my Netflix directly to it. Once in awhile I need to turn the sound almost all the way up, but mostly it is fine. (I do have a handicap in my hearing as I have a nerve deafness in my ears and it makes me very hard of hearing, so this may be the problem & not the TV at all.) Some day I will get a sound bar or extra attachment to enhance the sound system but in the meantime I am perfectly happy with this product and Amazon's service.I highly recommend it!

The black levels are deep and the whites bright. It does however have a glossy screen which can cause reflections on the screen in a brightly lit room. Also while most blurays look good on this television it does have problems with very dark scenes. For example in the Harry Potter movies the screen often turns so dark that you can't see what is going on in the scene. I believe that this problem is caused by the fact that this is a LCD TV rather than poor craftsmanship on the part of Panasonic. This is a small problem as the vast majority of blurays look good even in dark scenes.

You don't need a 1080p TV in every room in the house, at least I don't think so.  The fact that it has the new features (direct iPod connection, access to internet apps like Pandora & Netflix) was a definite plus, too.

Literally one day before the one year warranty expired, the TV suddenly went black and wouldn't turn on. Turned out to have the \"flash of death,\" meaning the most expensive repair it can need. I called the company, but could not get through, was on hold for an hour total and disconnected TWICE! That was a Friday. I called on Monday, but they said because it was now a few DAYS after warranty, even though the breakage happened before it expired, they would not honor the warranty. The call center is the most unhelpful, impossible to reach, circular mess I have ever encountered. They told me to go get it repaired, and said AFTER I paid for it they MIGHT cover part of the cost. They gave me an address nowhere near where I lived to do it, despite repeatedly telling them it was not near me. The rep told me he did not know how to get something for my city - really? I was in NYC at the time! They wanted me to go 40 miles away with no car, for a TV they may or may not partially cover! They were rude about it on top of it.I was told I would get calls back over and over, and this dragged on for a month but no one ever called back. Finally I sent a ton of emails and managed to get the problem escalated. I was told I had only 2 days to get the diagnosis, because after that the \"partial warranty coverage date\" would pass - despite the fact that all the time had passed because of their fault! I actually did drag myself all the way out there in a friend's car to get the estimate, and was told I would have to drag the TV back home and come back again, Panasonic did not compensate them to keep the sets prior to work done. The estimate was $412!! More than the entire set cost in the first place just a year ago. I had to lose my mind with the Panasonic manager (who barely spoke English) to get it covered. They did, but they refused to cover the \"diagnostic fee\" - which was a whopping additional $80 that I had already paid, because a previous rep told me it would be reimbursed. No one was held accountable, and at that point I just wanted to be done with this and make Panasonic pay as much as possible - if I didn't fix the TV, I would be out $80 with a broken TV.I used to think Panasonic was a respectable company. I will never ever buy a major electronic appliance from them, and I plan to spread the word as much as possible, their TVs are junk, and they do not stand by their products or their customers.

I bought this for my daughters birthday - she is away at college and is thrilled with the TV and its features.  Everything works and the feature set is great for a college age kid - the IPTV (Netflix) and ability to connect to her iPhone as well as the ability to look at pictures directly from an SD card are the big ones.  She had been using a 4 year old 24\" Westinghouse that was both a very marginal and small TV so this was a great upgrade.Now for Amazon - I bought this TV from the Amazon Warehouse and it was labeled as \"Like New\" this was okay as it saved me about $50.  Within 2 days of the ordering the TV the price dropped about $40 for the exact same TV - this always makes me crazy.  At this point the TV had been shipped but had not been delivered. I emailed Amazon (twice) and was told to go pound sand (twice).  I carefully explained that I could easily refuse the shipment and simply reorder the TV but that I wanted to save Amazon the cost of the return shipping plus the administrative cost of reordering the TV and the cost of reshipping a 2nd TV.  But in spite of this reasonable and logical request I was again told to go pound sand. All I wanted (requested) was a refund of the price difference - a reasonable request - I think.Over the past 10+ years I have been a good and loyal customer of Amazon.com but I have now lost a good deal of regard for this company.  I feel that their response was poor and does not reflect a good customer attitude.In the end I did not want to make my daughter a victim of Amazon.com's stupidity so I bit my lip and allowed the TV to be delivered - and I will pay the higher price.  I will not however forget and Amazon.com will be the ultimate looser as I plan to share this story as often as I can with anyone who might care to listen.  It's not the money it's the poor customer attitude.", "Date": "November 9, 2011"}, {"Title": "Panasonic brand a waste of money", "Author": "Chris", "ReviewID": "RDR1UHMLENQ82", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY ON A PANASONIC PRODUCT! I purchased a flat screen for a friend and it lasted less than 2.5 years. If there is a problem with your TV Panasonic does not want to hear from you if you need repairs but will gladly offer to sell you another piece of junk TV. Without looking at it Panasonic knew that the \"motherboard had been fried.\" Perhaps they've encountered this problem thousands of times before. If you look at your flat screen as a disposable product, the picture is great. If you'd like your investment to last a while run from the PANASONIC brand.
