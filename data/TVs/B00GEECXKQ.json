{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Best 60 inch LED for the price", "Author": "Kris", "ReviewID": "R2IVOPEJPO6VJ4", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I had been patiently waiting for this TV to become available via Amazon, mainly because of the unbelievably low price and good review given on CNET, but got tired of waiting and ended up purchasing this TV on 10/13 from Costco.  They had just gotten a shipment in that day and once I saw it in the store, I knew I needed to get it.  CNET had mentioned that the off angle viewing was not as good on this set when compared to LEDs from other manufacturers, but I haven't had any problems viewing this TV even from extreme angles.  The TV was not quite as bright as the LG next to it at the store, but I believe this was mainly due to the matte finish of the screen.  The LG had a glossy screen which made the picture very bright, but it also reflected literally everything behind it.  My TV is now set up in a very sunny living room and the glare is minimal.  Much better than the 37 inch Sharp LCD it replaced.  For those looking for a basement TV, a glossy TV or a plasma might be the way to go, but for me, the matte finish was the best option.  The TV has an extremely thin bezel which I really appreciated because it allowed me to get a 60 inch screen size out of a TV that takes up the same space as many 55 inch units.  Out of the box, the colors were pretty good, but I am still hoping to find detailed color settings posted by CNET or elsewhere.  If anyone has a good link, please share :)  The smart features work reasonably well.  Amazon Prime and Netflix both ran just fine.  My only complaint so far is with the Amazon Prime interface.  It is very paired down when compared to the version offered over my PS3 and it took a long time to browse titles.  If you know what movie you want though, you can simply use the search function.  So far, I am completely satisfied with this set and for anyone debating between a $1000 LG or Samsung 55 inch and this 60 inch Vizio, I would highly suggest getting the Vizio.  I was really surprised at how much larger the screen size was when compared to the 55s next to it at the store and the sharpness and clarity of the picture was comparable to the LGs and Samsungs costing several hundred more.  Costco is currently selling this set for $979, so hopefully Amazon will price match once it gets in stock.***Update***I found detailed picture settings for this TV posted by katzmaier on CNET and thought would I pass it along for others to try.

There is an \"E\" at the end of the model, so it may differ slightly. I looked at the tv, and it looks to have all the same features. The only difference seems to be the remote. The E model remote lacks a qwerty keypad. But that is not a big loss, as the smart features on the tv are not that good anyway, as you'll see in my review.So this TV is part of Walmart's BF sale for a second year in row. It must have been successful for them to do it again. This TV retails normally between $900 and $1,000 during the year. At that price it is a decent TV. For $688 it is a huge deal. I bought this TV last year at $688. Now that I have had it for a year, I think it is good time to review it.First, a bit of background. I repair TVs for a living. I have seen all kinds of TV installations I have probably repaired pretty much every model out there at some point, everything from a $200 Emerson to the $5,000 Elite. They all can break, or I wouldn't have a job.I use this TV a lot. I have a PC hooked up, along with multiple gaming devices and a cable box. I have used every input except the VGA (my PC is hooked up with HDMI.) I have used an antenna as well. Channels scanning is fairly painless if you want to go over the air. You can easily add new channels to your scan, and even do a partial scan. A standard definition picture does not look too great on this TV, but that is pretty normal with HD TVs in general. And odds are you probably wont be using viewing much SD content, if any. Pop in a Bluray and this TV will shine.This model has a pretty good picture. Even out of the box the picture will have some pop. The color is vibrant. You have quite a few options to play with to tweak it to your desire. It has a 120 Hz refresh rate, and it works pretty well for the most part. Sometimes a fast moving object, like a football being thrown, may have a trail on it. It is not a pronounced effect, many people may not notice it unless they really look for it. I only see this when watching cable. When gaming, I don't see it. All in all the picture is fantastic, and looks like a TV more than twice the price.A common flaw with LED is light bleeding. On a really dark image, some areas of the screen may be slightly lighter than others. This effect is only noticeable on very dark images, I can't see it unless my screen is totally blank. But each TV can be different, it can show up in a different spot and to a different degree in different TVs. Like I said, it is common among all LED TVs, especially bigger ones like this. During normal viewing, odds are you will not notice it. But for some people this is a deal breaker. Again, this TV is also $688. I'm willing to live with that, and it never bothers me.The TV has a gaming mode, which disables the post image processing. The reason for this is that all that post processing makes the image delay as it reaches your screen. For normal TV viewing, that is fine. But for video games, input delay can make your games difficult to play. Input Delay (or Input Lag) is the time it takes the TV to display an image. This is not to be confused with Refresh Rates, they are totally different. A long input delay will probably lead to your gaming deaths in fast paced games. For some reason no brand seems to list this stat. But there are people testing this, and the delay of this model is 31 milliseconds. That gives it a rating of Great from the Input Lag Database, which is their second best rating after Excellent. So this is good for people who plan on playing video games. You cannot get much faster than this without using a dedicated monitor.As a smart TV however, this TV fails. It does have wifi, and it is functional, providing most of the common streaming apps out there. But the interface is clunky, and apps are rarely updated. If you want to stream stuff on this TV, you are better off using a set top box or gaming console to do it. The remote has a qwerty remote, but it is also subpar. The remote is not bluetooth, so you have to have a clear line of site to use it. The remote has 2 IR emitters, one for normal use, and one on the side for the qwerty keypad. The qwerty buttons are small and close together, making it difficult to use. The 2013 BF model for Walmart does not have a qwerty keypad, but you aren't missing much. Do not buy this TV for its smart features.If you really want the qwerty remote, it is possible to get one separately from a site like Shop Jimmy. This remote should work, the remote part number is 0980-0306-1060, here is a link, Shop Jimmy just happens to have them on sale for $5 right now. Otherwise they will be $15 on ebay.[...]Again, this is only if you really, really want that qwerty keypad for the Walmart BF 2013 model.Now, for the broken TVs you see in other reviews. Last year's model for BF had a bad batch of panels. This led to some of those models having screen failures. Vizio addressed the issue by extending warranties for those serial numbers effected. I had this happen to my TV as well, 2 months after I bought it. I took it back to Walmart and exchanged it. I have no issues with the replacement I received, which is 9 months old now, and I use it a lot. I do not expect that will be an issue this year. Last year, the model was brand new. This year, Vizio has had all year to produce units for Walmart. So I would imagine those kinks would be worked out.There was also a sound issue where occasionally the audio would go out of sync with HDMI. I did experience this a few times as well. The issue was very specific as well, as it only happened with cable and satellite boxes. It never happened with my game consoles, and I play them more than I watch cable. This issue was fixed by a software update. I haven't had the problem since that update, which was early last year.So this TV is pretty solid. I do not regret my purchase at all. I did my research and got exactly what I expected. And for BF, this is still a great deal, even a year later. The only TV on BF 2013 that compares is from HHGregg. They will have a LG 60\" plasma for $600. If you are concerned about deep blacks, then that TV may be for you. Keep in mind that TV only has 2 HDMI ports, though, and you may get burn in on a plasma. If you do get a plasma, turn the cell brightness down and make sure to avoid having any still images on screen for too long, especially in the early life of the TV. The LG also has a higher Input Lag at 56 milliseconds and an \"Okay\" rating, so it is not as good for gaming as the Vizio. That is a full half a second for your inputs to show up on screen, which means you will probably die a lot playing Halo.Also, I recommend getting the extended warranty. That's only $68 at Walmart (10% of the TV cost,) and it adds 3 years to your warranty, giving you a full 4 years of coverage. Maybe you wont need it, but if you ever do, you'll be glad you got it! I work on all the brands, so you never can be sure how well they will hold up. It's also a good idea to compare different warranties from different stores. They may cover different things.I hope this helps!", "Date": "November 25, 2013"}, {"Title": "LCD panel failures & audio sync problems (now addressed with warranty extension and firmware update)", "Author": "S.

See below for details.)- Severe audio-video sync problems (In mid-January 2013, Vizio released a firmware update to fix this issue. See below for details.)- Still some glare in bright room- Takes about 8 seconds to \"boot up\" from power on (down from ~18 seconds before firmware updates)- Only one shared composite/component input for older devices- Slightly gray blacks and somewhat uneven back-lighting, although this likely varies between individual units- DLNA and smart-app implementations are very crude (you are probably better off getting a dedicated device to do these, like a Roku or Apple TV)- Ports hard to access on back, which is particularly a problem for the USB port, if you want to plug and unplug (somewhat inherent in thin flat-panel TVs)LCD PANEL FAILURE ISSUEMany owners, including me, were reporting a problem where the image would disappear but the backlight and sound would remain on. This required full replacement of the TV. On 2/8/2013, Vizio acknowledged this problem in a \"special bulletin\" revealing that a bad batch of chips were installed in units with serial numbers ranging from LFTRNWAN3800001 to LFTRNWAN4805300. It also affects a range of the 70\" E701i-A3 models. Vizio extended the warranty from one to two years for that specific problem. However, Vizio said it was \"promptly\" and \"proactively\" contacting registered customers about the possible issue, but, disappointingly, there is no evidence that they have done this beyond the bulletin and a blog post.AUDIO-VIDEO SYNC ISSUEMany people were reporting a variety of audio-video sync problems, particularly with cable boxes and Dolby Digital audio. Vizio initially blamed the cable boxes and had people set them to output PCM audio (rather than Dolby Digital). Unfortunately, that downgraded the audio to two channels only. However, in mid-January 2013, Vizio released a firmware update (version 1.1.5, which can be seen under Menu>Help>System Info>Version) that allegedly fixes the problem.Also, the Vizio seems more sensitive than average to different HDMI cables. Video periodically drops out completely (screen flashes to black for a few seconds) with cables that work fine with other displays.QUALITY/CUSTOMER SERVICEWhen my first unit failed with the LCD panel problem after only 23 days of use, I was very disappointed that Vizio initially only offered to replace it with a \"recertified\" unit. After a great deal of insistence, they agreed to send a new one.In addition, when I communicated with them about the audio-video sync problem, I was disappointed that they were blaming my cable box that worked fine with my other displays, and that they insisted that I downgrade to two-channel audio to \"fix\" their problem. In my online chat, the Vizio representative stated the following: \"The newer TVs that we manufacturer are set up for PCM rather than Dolby Digital. So it is not a defect in the TV, you will just have to connect it a different way.\"I have mixed feelings at this point.", "Date": "November 26, 2012"}, {"Title": "Phenomenal TV ~ Takes HD to a whole new level", "Author": "Expressed Reviews \"Expressed Reviews\"", "ReviewID": "R1N6E62PWU29IH", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This is without a doubt the finest TV that I've ever had the pleasure to use. In comparison to my 5 year old Samsung HD TV, this one makes the Samsung look like a part of ancient history. The first thing that grabs you is the incredibly sleek design. The bezel surrounding the TV is razor thin, thus there is no wasted space at all. Not only does this provide for excellent viewing, but it makes it possible to place the TV in a cabinet that's just slightly larger than the TV picture itself. It's unlikely that you would want to put it in a cabinet, first because it's difficult to find one that would accommodate it, and second because the TV looks beautiful fully exposed. As for the picture, it's extremely brilliant and so lifelike that when watching sporting events, you get the feeling that you're actually at the event. The same applies to watching any live broadcast, such as the news. The colors are vibrant and right on. In addition, the vividness is spectacular under all lighting conditions, as well when viewing from an angle. I have mine placed in a room that gets a lot of sunlight, yet somehow, the picture looks just as brilliant as it does in subdued lighting conditions. Although I have my own sound system hooked up to the TV, prior to doing so I tested the internal speakers and found them to be excellent for a TV of this size. The remote is very user friendly and works very similar to a smartphone. One of the nicest features of this TV is the built in wi-fi. I guess that almost all TV's have this feature now, but Vizio brings it to a whole new level. The wi-fi enables you to access virtually any channel that you could hope for, including the obvious ones such as Netflix and Amazon. There are so many other streaming channels available that you'd be hard pressed not to find something great to watch. I own another, much smaller Vizio TV, which I purchased for our kitchen, and I'm amazed at the picture and sound quality on that one as well. Vizio seems to have an advantage over other manufacturers, in that they provide a super premium product at a cost that is significantly lower than the competition. It amazes me that this TV cost about half what I paid for my Samsung, yet it's light years ahead in quality and features. The only concern that I have with Vizio, is that they don't have as long a track record as some of the other TV manufacturers. Only time will tell if their quality is long-lasting. Undoubtedly, by the time you read this, something new and improved will come along, but for the moment anyway, I believe that this is the finest TV that you could purchase for the price. It really is an awesome and thoroughly enjoyable experience to use and as far as I'm concerned, there are no negatives. I believe that you'll really enjoy using this fantastic product and that it will provide you with a great deal of pleasure.  It's much more than a TV, it's an experience, and a really, really good one at that. If I could give this 10 stars I would.", "Date": "October 10, 2012"}, {"Title": "Disappointed", "Author": "averagejoe", "ReviewID": "R1GHLF725W4G52", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I bought this TV on December 1, 2012.  Initially, I loved it.  I found a post that helped me calibrate the colors and I thought I was set for March Madness.  Then I noticed that red/orange items filmed in scenes of sitcoms seemed to bounce around.  I thought it was associated with the quality of the programming, but then noticed that red colored boxes on the ESPN ticker were also bouncing.  Bummer.  I was considering taking it back to Sams club - 90 day return policy - but was thinking I would live with it.  Then, on day 89, as I was watching the Daily show, it croaked.  The black started at the lower right hand corner of the screen and spread over the entire screen in less than two seconds.  Sound was ok, but no picture.  Tried \"rebooting,\" but nothing.  Luckily it happened before the 90 day mark - back to Sams it went. Would not recommend due to the color issue and the short shelf life.  Thank goodness it happened before 90 days - otherwise I'd be dealing with warrantee issues. Whew!Here's the bulletin from Vizio:VIZIO special bulletinPublished 02/08/2013 06:15 PM  |  Updated 02/12/2013 08:15 AMA limited number of VIZIO's E-Series 60\" and 70\" LED Smart TVs (model numbers E601i-A3 and E701i-A3) may experience a loss of video due to premature failure of a chip assembly sourced from a supplier.  VIZIO is working with its suppliers, retailers and consumers to resolve the issue as quickly as possible for affected users.  As part of its continued dedication to customer satisfaction, VIZIO is proactively communicating with its customers through direct contact with registered owners, through VIZIO's retailers and through online and social media about the potential issue, what to look for, and how to reach VIZIO's dedicated support team to receive help.What is the Nature of the Issue and Affected Range of Products?In a small percentage of units with serial numbers in the ranges of LFTRNWAN3800001 to LFTRNWAN4805300 for Model E601i-A3 and LFTRNXAN4500001 - LFTRNXAN4702936 for Model E701i-A3, users may experience a loss of video on the display although audio can still be heard.  This issue is attributed to a limited batch of chip assemblies from a supplier, in which there is a small percentage chance that the chip assembly prematurely fails; this causes the timing control board to be disabled, which disrupts the video signal to the display.  This potential issue appears to occur typically around the first 500 hours of usage or first few months of normal usage and does not present a safety concern.What is VIZIO's Response to Action?VIZIO has promptly notified its customers of the possible issue so that affected users can have their units repaired or replaced free of charge.  In addition, VIZIO is also extending its standard one-year limited warranty to two years from the date of purchase for this specific issue to ensure that customers who purchased the E601i-A3 or E701i-A3 can continue to enjoy their TV with full peace of mind.What Should VIZIO Customers do?If you have a VIZIO E-Series 60\" or 70\" TV with a serial number that falls within the ranges of LFTRNWAN3800001 to LFTRNWAN4805300 for Model E601i-A3 and LFTRNXAN4500001 - LFTRNXAN4702936 for Model E701i-A3 and experience a loss of video, please call VIZIO's Customer Care team toll free at 855-209-4106 or email them at: special.bulletin@vizio.com to directly reach our dedicated service team who will assist in resolving your issue as quickly as possible.", "Date": "March 2, 2013"}, {"Title": "Vizio 60\" Razor LED HDTV - Great Buy!", "Author": "DWatkins", "ReviewID": "RD5ISMXUL27UH", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I purchased this TV from Sam's club for slightly less than what it is listed for on Amazon.  The biggest headache with this TV was installing the wall mount to my wall (which has nothing to do with the TV).  I was pleased to find that the screws to install the wall mount were already included with the TV, since the TV is really thin in profile.  They worked perfect.  So far, this TV is awesome!  There was a little worry, at first, when I initially connected my cable box as I could only get 720p resolution.  I was not pleased with the picture.  Very disappointed, in fact.  Then, I did some research and got my settings to send 1080i HD from my box... TA-DA!  Picture is great!  It was easy to get the wifi connected in the guide setup.  Started using Netflix, YouTube, etc. immediately.  The picture is even better when watching videos from the net apps.... YES, even better!  I was stunned by the clarity of the app videos, and how well it streams media.  I did have to change the smoothing to Medium, as Harry Potter Deathly Hallows looked like a dark soap opera. That was the only setting that I needed to change from factory.  And the sound (w/o) external theatre sound was satisfactory.  I watched a TNF game and I had to turn around and look behind me as the built-in surround made the announcer in the stadium sound as if he were behind me (across the room from the TV).  The apps are intuitive and easy to use.  The remote control is great... the full qwerty keyboard on the reverse side saves you from pointing to letters and clicking on each one. The ability to type in your email, search term, etc. removes any annoyances from the experience.  Lastly, for the price, you cannot find a better LED TV this size.  So far, I am beyond pleased with my purchase.  I can only imagine when I connect the external sound system to it.  I am recommending this TV for ANYONE looking to purchase a TV.

I tend to upgrade every other year or so, and am never completely satisfied, always needing the \"next best thing\". This year i was kind of in a bind, my living room had a beautiful pn51D7000 samsung plasma hooked up to a 5.1 surround system, but i just needed something bigger. The samsung plasma had a beautiful picture, but i watch a ton of movies and really wanted that \"immersion\" that a bigger tv provides (especially with the surround sound) My fiance thinks i am crazy for wanting a bigger tv, and wasnt entirely supportive at first because she thought i was going to spend a ton of money. So, i did my research, and was amazed at how much prices have come down even over the past year. I initially was going to stay with plasma as i loved the fact that i didnt see any motion, and loved the truly inky blacks. I did not need 3d, as my samsung had it and i probably only used it twice (not that it looked bad, i just dont like wearing the glasses as it made everything even darker than a plasma already is) My criteria this time around were basically 60\" screen, good picture and bright vibrant colors under $1500. I have never owned a vizio before, i have always owned samsungs and lg's, my thoughts were that vizio was a cheap brand that sold cheaply made products. When i first heard about this E601-A3 on amazon, and saw the price, i figured it would be very cheap and i would hate it compared to the samsung. I then started reading reviews, and figured with amazon's awesome return policy that i might as well try this tv, knowing i could return it if it wasnt up to my high standards. I ordered it on a tuesday and received it friday, mounted it on my wall and was very surprised at the quality all around. The tv is beautifully thin, basically looks like a picture frame around the screen. The picture settings needed to be tweaked, and i am still tweaking them a little but the picture now is almost perfect. I tend to mess with settings the first 2 weeks i have any tv anyway, but i have no doubt i can get the picture to look exactly how i want it to look with a little more time. As far as flashlighting or light bleeding goes, it is there. It must be an inherent problem with all side lit led tv's, but i will say i only notice it when turning the tv on or off. When i am watching HD content, whether its through fios or on blu ray the black looks very very close to how my plasma looked, it really is that good. And i notice no light bleed in the corners at all, which is something i half expected. The smart function works very well, i use netflix all the time and love how easy it is to bring up movies/shows. A lot of people complain about the remote, i actually enjoy it and think its designed perfectly. Last but not least, i love playing sports games on ps3 and absolutely cannot have a tv with any lag whatsoever. This tv comes equipped with a gamer mode in the main options, it allows you to turn the mode on for all of the preset picture modes (vivid, standard, movie etc) and works flawlessly! i notice absolutely no delay or motion blur WHAT SO EVER. Very very very impressed, this tv makes a baseball game look like i am actually there, i actually have to squint when looking at the lights or the sun, its that good! Sorry for the long review, but i was in a huge bind over whether or not to get another plasma or try out an edge lit LED. For a tv this solid, with the options it comes with and the quality of the picture, i would have EASILY paid $1500.

Also coming from plasma I like my picture on the darker side, I feel it gives more \"depth\" and the best part is I don't have any bleeding when it comes to the Edge-lit factor. Will the picture blow you away? If this is your first HDTV absolutely, but otherwise you're not going to see a huge difference from the HDTV's from the past couple of years.  The 120hz processor is all you'll ever need, at least when it comes to cable..we have \"charter\" and they only support 60hz.

And if you are that concerned about the sound that it influences your purchasing decision, you should go out and at least get a \"home theater in a box.\"  Personally, sound is as important as picture, I have a 7.2 system (7 satellite speakers, 2 subwoofers) running off of my Onkyo NR609 receiver, total set up cost me just under 1K.  I need to feel the mortars and artillery from \"Band of Brothers\", \"The Pacific\", \"The Thin Red Line\"...etc. So like I said, go spend a couple hundred dollars on a 5.1 system, or for God sakes at least get a $80 sound bar.REMOTEFeels very well made to me, heavy, and the qwerty keyboard is very innovative and at times can be quite handy.  To be honest tho I don't use tv remotes often, my Onkyo remote controls my cable box, tv, blu-ray player, and of course the Onkyo receiver.  So I'm set.APPS/WI-FISo far just used Netflix, haven't tried my Amazon prime account yet but in all honesty, it is what it is and if one works there's no reason the rest won't.  Wi-fi was easy to set-up..so even if you're just a little tech savvy there's no reason it won't be easy for you.Let's see, what else?? No dead pixels, special delivery was good, they came in put it in my room, unpackaged it, assembled the stand and hoisted it on my TV center. They will take the packaging if you want but I think it's a good idea to just throw it in the basement as you may never know when you'll need it. Personally it's nice to have because I tend to sell mine every fall, although the only thing missing from this tv is 3D and I know I would just about never use it, so I'll be good with this tv for longer than usual.IMPORTANT! If before delivery the tv was in a cold vehicle like mine was(I'm a \"Yooper\")...make sure you give it plenty of time to warm up (I waited 4 hours)..otherwise your tv experience will be over before it could start!Here's my picture settings, and it's perfect as far as I'm concerned. Again, I like the dark picture..it prevents the \"bleeding\" from occurring and lest you forget, this a damn big \"flash light\" so why on earth would you want a bright picture?Back light- 50Brightness- 45Contrast- 45Color- 54Tint- 0Sharpness- 0 (the higher the sharpness, the \"grainier\" the picture..try it for yourself)Color temp- I switch between normal-cool, never 'warm' as I feel reds and oranges tend to be dominant and overwhelmingSmooth Motion effect- OffReal cinema mode- Off (that horrible 'soap opera' look...hate it!)Noise Reduction- OffMPEG NR- HighColor enhancement- NormalAdaptive Luma- OffFilm mode- OffBacklight Control- OPCAmbient Light Sensor- OffHope this is helpful!

Haven't spent too much time with this set. I was upgrading from a 6 year old 42\" Hitachi Plasma set. The Hitatchi still looked pretty great, but I've been convinced for months, obsessing over waiting for the right deal. I was sure that I needed an LG or a Samsung; the two top dogs (imo) with a great selection of mid-high range sets within my budget ($1500) There were plenty of similar prices for quality sets; anything 55\" + TV set within the last year, some nice frills to boot was on the table.The timing of this set's release was just too perfect. I wasn't even considering a vizio, but all the sets by Samsung and LG are already 6+months behind). And Vizio deserves credit for really stepping it up. I saw the review on cnet and gizmodo and was quickly sold. It looks and feels like a spiffy new high-end television. Also going from 42\" to 60\" is more impressive than it may sound. The set itself also damn thin and not too heavy. Especially compared to the smaller hitachi.It's worth repeating, I had a negative connotation with Vizio as low end, bargain TV's from walmart. But I'm truly impressed with the feature set.... loads of inputs, wi-fi capabilities, netflix and amazon prime apps  (total snap to set it all up)... i'm still discovering more eatures as I play with it. As soon as I threw the set on I fired up the on the Step Brothers blu-ray it was noticably crisper than my old 1080i set.Now I have some minor nitpicking to do. Not dealbreakers, but just thoughts. For one, he stand does not swivel. My Hitachi had this swiveling stand, and it was a great feature depending on how many people were viewing. Also I hate the smooth motion settings. It just looks strange to me, like everything turns into a daytime soap. Thankfully I can turn it off. I can see it being nice for sports games, but movies and most tv shows throw me off with the movement. My buddy was saying he likes it better, so I guess that's gonna be a personal thing. I keep it set off. Also, the remote is not backlit. For all those buttons on there, it would have been great to make it easy on the eyes when all the lights are out.Menus themselves are rather deep with settings and features, yet intuitive to get to the simple stuff. I love that you can browse amazon prime on the sidebar without entering an app. This means whatever else you're watching changes aspect ratio and continutes to play, while you freely browse new content. I was a little overwhelmed with the amount of features and settings, but it's not difficult to change some basic picture settings and keep it simple.There's no other set at this price point, this solid, this new and with so many features. It's worth looking at, and I predict it will be a big seller in the holidays.I'll update my review again as I play around more. Still figuring stuff out.I can't believe I spent over $2300 on a 42\" plasma and only 5-6 years later, sets like these are not only better but like half price. Also i was jazzed this tv was 30% under my budget. This set is a steal for $1000. Great timing Vizio.***updates***one week later - still happy as can be. no buyers remorse. several friends are considering purchasing the same exact set. i am convinced this product will keep me happy years down the road.some questions to other ppl who bought this set (sound off in the comments) : - any thoughts on using a soundbar? gizmodo [...] just ran an article on top four under $300 and the top choice was a vizio soundbar for $225... worth it? speakers are pretty good as is, just want psuedo surround... i still have a sony receiver and 5 pc speaker with 5.1 dolby setup but honestly it's just a little cumbersome these days.- any previous vizio owners; do they update the built in apps often? would love to have HBO Go on here ;)- what defines HD on the netflix streaming? this might just be off topic, as it's probably relative to the netflix app more than the set... it looks pretty good, but i definitely see some rough pixels here and there. pressing info just says \"XHD\"- is there a way to lock the settings? my son keeps on turning real motion to mess with me and it's the worst.", "Date": "October 19, 2012"}, {"Title": "Broke in less than a week!", "Author": "Jorge Carral", "ReviewID": "R1V9N1LPHSEGTI", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "Watch out with this TV, you can see from other reviews that some of these just black out.

I chose the 60\" size at a great price that beat competitors in the same segment. You get an unadorned relatively thin black bezel without the overuse of logos as you will find. The depth is pretty shallow. The HDMI inputs face down making wall mounting not a hassle. You're able to have the power LED indicator turn off while viewing so there's less distraction. Video games are very responsive to input with little to no lag (Playing Call of Duty: Ghosts currently on it). Picture quality is pretty good to the non-videophile (me) after some tweaking...especially the brightness levels which are initially blindingly bright. I do not regret my purchase.Now on to what most people reading these reviews is looking for: The negatives.panel uniformity is atrocious. This is to mean, on a black screen...the back-lit patches of light that will show through like dark grey splotches. This is something you won't notice unless you're watching a very dark movie/TV show. This varies from panel to panel, even among the same line of TV...I just happened to get what I got. At this price point, you will have some no matter what.The Apps are sorta hit or miss. Netflix works well enough and I have only encountered a few app freezes in a few months. Amazon GO app could use quite a bit of work as browsing movie titles is an exercise in reading very small print (App doesn't go fullscreen like Netflix). The other apps included are fluff for my uses. Could use a Spotify app like the Samsung units, and HBO GO! but that's nit picky.3-stars were given due to panel uniformity, medium picture quality, and Apps that work but aren't polished.I had to choose between screen size, price, and picture quality. I chose low price and large screen size and went with this unit and I do not regret my purchase.

The \"white gloves\" delivery service was excellent as well.Now, after 10 days of using the TV the only thing I can find to complain about is the physical size of the remote.  I'm an Olde Farte and have trouble seeing small print in dim light and using things with small keys.  The remote on this TV is one of the smallest I've ever seen and even has a full keyboard on the reverse side.  It is virtually impossible for me to read the labels over the buttons or use the keyboard but for younger users I don't think this would be a problem.Setup was a piece of cake and even network connections worked right out of the box.  I was able to connect and stream a Netflix movie and watched the entire thing without a single dropped frame or freeze.  I have 7mb DSL internet service.The picture is awesome.  Unfortunately, the Blu-ray player I ordered was caught up in Superstorm Sandy and hasn't yet arrived but HD picture quality over-the-air is almost 3D-like and does not fade or wash out in a bright room.A major surprise was the sound.  Most HDTV's seem to cheap out on the sound but this one seems much better than most.  I have it sitting on its stand on a wooden console and can hear the sound, crisp and clean, from 15 feet away.  I have the digital output connected to my A/V receiver but the additional sound quality comes mostly from the two woofers attached to that system.And that raises the only engineering complaint I have and would be true with the majority of HDTV's and that is the placement of the downward-facing connections.  The unit is so thin that connecting the optical output and HDMI inputs is difficult.  And seeing the various connections is almost impossible when the unit is placed on its stand.Overall I consider this unit an excellent value for the money (just under $1,000) and would recommend it highly.

This is the only thing I'm going to complain about. Using the qwerty remote on the backside takes some getting used to. It's a little laggy when typing and in my short experience, it has to be pointed the right way at the TV to get any reception.User-Interface - In no way is this a 4ghz PC with 8 gigs of RAM. It's a TV. The menu's and apps are big graphical animations and are a little jittery moving around the screen, but they are again adequate.

Has great picture. No wow here.Two hugh disappointments are: One; the internet connectivity is through a Yahoo interface except for Netflix. This means all the great content now available on the internet is funneled through Yahoo. You might say so what. Well use this Yahoo interface for a short time and you'll discover that it's extremely difficult to use. Why? The strongest negative is the fact that it's only displayed on the left third of the screen which makes it cumbersome to to view. Now don't forget this is a 60\" TV and it's still unacceptable to me to utilize only 33% of the screen. What was Visio thinking. At least give an option to expand the Yahoo interface size. Try viewing Amazon Prime videos like that and when you do Yahoo/Visio does not allow you to view your \"watchlist\" to play your pre-chosen video... REALLY!! I find that I will no longer use the Yahoo interface. As stated earlier Netflix views full screen because it does not view through the Yahoo portal. The whole Yahoo interface makes the Wifi almost worthless!!!Now the second disappointment; When Visio does a software update, (which it does automatically and you can't stop it) it wipes out all your settings.... Yes It wipes all your wireless internet settings, all your Yahoo interface settings and Netflix password settings. All your passwords for each individual app and Wifi settings will be lost. It took me over an hour to re-install all the passwords. This sucks and I just won't do it again! Why would you design an HDTV that wipes all your setting every time a software update is done. This is not new technology and one would think they would have field tested this HDTV. Guess not. Then while you are using the keypad side of the remote to speed re-entry up you will find the darn thing is rather intermittent and you have to sit right in front of the TV to get it to work somewhat.I have two Visio HDTV's and don't think I will be buying another.

For some reason the delivery guys refused to help me with this (I thought that was part of the deal with buying a large TV from Amazon?).  However, the TV is relatively light so I managed to do it single-handed.  Without the power screwdriver it could have been a problem though.- Setup was a breeze, as pointed out, choose \"HOME\" not \"STORE\" on the very first screen.- I made some adjustments to the TV settings, turning off smooth motion as suggested in other reviews here, then played with the colors until they were to my liking.  I can't see any difference in quality to the Samsung UN55ES7500 I returned.  Viewing is perfectly fine too, at wide angles.  Perfectly fine for any normal family basement/living room!- The remote is brilliant because it has a QWERTY keyboard on the back.  Unlike some other reviewers, I had no problems with the angle it was pointed at, the TV always could receive signals from it (despite it being IR, not Bluetooth).  This makes such a difference when entering user names, searching for things etc.- DNLA works like a charm!  I was able to watch videos and view photos from my Windows 7 PC via the \"media\" app.  My only gripes are (1) you are limited to the video and audio codecs that the TV has, with no opportunity to install your own (2) it does not start a video where you left off, and (3) you are limited to fast forwarding at an annoyingly slow speed, so restarting half-way through is a real pain.  (Side note: after I added some new media to my Windows PC the TV wasn't listing it, I thought it was because the TV did not have the required codecs, but that was not the case, it was actually a problem with Win7 - search Google for \"DLNA in Windows 7 64 bit - newly added files not available on devices\" to find the solution - I did what it said there, and the media showed up!).  After a couple of weeks of use, I decided to invest in a Roku and the free Plex app to stream my media to my TV - this means that the video/audio is decoded on the PC and therefore any media at all can be played on the TV.- The CNET review mentioned the basicness of the UI, but I actually really like it and find it far more sensibly laid out than the Samsung I returned, which I found to be too busy and confused.  I like the way that you can browse Amazon Instant Video while watching TV.  There is a dedicated button on the remote for Amazon and Netflix which is nice, and one for \"M-Go\", which I will never use and in fact uninstalled. I wish that could have been reprogrammed for the \"Media\" app.  The Facebook and Twitter apps also operate while allowing you to watch TV (note if you have apps turned off in Facebook you won't be able to log in from the TV - took me two TVs and a long time to figure that out).- I have not noticed any lip sync issues yet (either from cable TV, or from DNLA) but the TV does allow you to adjust the synchronicity, haven't used it so can't comment on its effectiveness.  ** UPDATE ** after a few weeks of usage, I am now starting to notice the dreaded lip sync issue, both from cable TV and while watching my Roku.  Switching inputs seems to reset it again.- Startup does take about 10 seconds (minor annoyance in my opinion)- Sound is a little bit tinny, I have invested in a sound bar to complement it.- I read some concerns somewhere about the stand not being wide enough, and the possibility of the TV tipping over.  It does not require much leverage applied to the top of the TV to pull it over, and I do think that a small child could achieve this if they were set on doing it, or tried to climb up it/hang off the front.  Whether or not it's heavy enough to seriously injure them though is a different question - it is so much lighter than CRTs were, or even older LCDs, so I suspect not, but obviously it all depends on what hits where.The bottom line is that I think it's a better value for money to spend less on the TV and then buy a $50-$150 media streaming app which is much more cost effective to replace down the line if something better comes along, than replacing a whole TV.Google \"Vizio E601-A3 Owners Thread\" for some other useful info by people who have purchased (or who want to purchase) this TV.", "Date": "November 17, 2012"}, {"Title": "Amazing", "Author": "Wilson x4", "ReviewID": "R19144X44POG8W", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I purchased this t.v. yesterday from Costco for 979.99.

I bought it at COSTCO and had no troubles due to their excellent return policy. The HD quality on this set ranks with the best but I would purchase an extended warranty (if available) as the picture issue seems to be a common defect.", "Date": "January 21, 2013"}, {"Title": "NICE FEATURES AND PICTURE, BUT NOT WORTH THE FAILURE RATE...", "Author": "Jason Legg", "ReviewID": "R3E2SKI0TLQWHT", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "The same thing happened to me like \"S. P. Linke\" customer review stated, I had it under a month, the screen went blank (but the backlighting and sound still worked). I read many other reviews about the same thing happening to many other users and physically drove and talked to the store associate at Walmart, he said that he has seen many other Vizio's come back with the same issues or another within the last month. Decided on all the information that I gathered that the higher percentage rates of failure for this brand was not worth \"the hassle that many other users have gone through in the past\". Due diligence to yourself and read what others have gone through, and find the best deals of TV's that WILL LAST LONGER. I returned my unit to Walmart and read good reviews on a Panasonic that they had displayed for \"around\" the same price. Went to Sams Club were they had the same TV for $100.00 off and included a 3 year warranty for only $60.00 (paid for by the money that was saved). The Panasonic only has a 2% failure rate instead of Vizio's 4%. Plus Panasonic makes there own parts instead of buying them from a major label and only buying enough for a production run like Vizio does. All TV manufacters will have problems here and there but look for the ones that have the least amount of issues that will also not give you the run around if you did for future reference.  Consumer Reports data indicates that most major brand flat panel sets have a 2-5% failure rate within the first 3 years, but the overwelming amount of set failures do occur before the factory warranty ends. So if you spend a small amount of time educating yourself before you buy, you might just save yourself a couple of hours, days and/or weeks of getting the run around from companys that only focus on the bottom dollar and not the consumers money and dedication to there brand (like so many commited users have found through long waited discriminating experiences). I think you might have bought a TV for the purpose of entertainment, not the negative opposite of waiting for a replacement, repair or run around from the brand that was supposed to last with your hard earned money.

I've never been pissed off enough to write one but this whole incident is outrageous.This will be my first, last, and only Vizio. I hate to condemn a company based on a single item, but this television's flaws are absurd. Why bother to manufacture a set with such a large panel and not do it properly? It's just a waste of components. Here are the issues I had:- Horrible light bleeding, not only from the edges (somewhat common with LCDs), but a huge section of the middle. Watching anything remotely dark looked awful.- Audio out of sync. Watching digital video from netflix or via my home network wasn't a possibility because of a very noticeable delay between the dialogue and lips of the actors. I use a home theater for my audio which worked perfectly with the previous TV and once again functions just fine with that set without any changes. I spent time in the menu attempting to correct the issue through setting adjustments but it is not possible. You'll see others had the same issue in other reviews. I wish I had read them before I bought it on Black Friday.- I re-adjusted the stand twice, ensuring that it was secured tightly and properly. The tv still leans back at an angle, which I believe was straining the panel and would eventually warp it.I use a PS3 for my streaming but I should mention to potential buyers that the \"smart apps\" are incredibly sluggish. A dollar store android tablet moves more fluidly than the app menus on this TV.The only positive I take from this experience is my new-found appreciation for my old Sony Bravia. Dynamic contrast ratio is a meaningless statistic. This tv claims to have a 1,000,000:1 DCR while my 3 year old Sony has 100,000:1. Comparing the contrast and black levels between the two is a joke. I realize how fantastic the Sony actually looks now that I spent a week trying to watch the Vizio.Those planning to order ANY TV from Amazon should read the following:I have to comment on the delivery carrier CEVA Logistics, which Amazon employs to deliver TVs. This is the most unprofessional company I have ever had the misfortune of dealing with. I stayed home all day waiting for delivery and as the 5pm window passed, I called the company to confirm that the set would still be coming. I was informed that the driver was running a little behind and should make it to my home by 10PM. He did not and the following day I received a phone call from my grandparents whom he had contacted after finding their number in the local phone book. In the process of accepting and attempting to return this TV, I have corrected both Amazon and CEVA on the phone number at least four times. When I finally spoke to the driver, I had to give him step by step directions to my house as if we were executing a CraigsList deal. I later asked CEVA if the drivers have GPS and was told that they ordinarily do not, unless the driver chooses to buy their own or use a smartphone. THIS IS A DELIVERY COMPANY THAT DOES NOT EQUIP THEIR DRIVERS WITH GPS! Are you serious??After setting up the Vizio and learning of all its defects and shortcomings, I initiated a return with Amazon on December 17th, 2012. As of January 2, the TV still sits in the box at my home and I'm awaiting a return phone call on the 4th to schedule a pickup thankfully via another carrier. CEVA has scheduled a return pickup 3 TIMES and not only failed to show up, but let me wait for them without so much as a phone call to inform me they weren't coming. Each time I call, it's as if they have no database to retrieve my information and are sifting through paperwork. It's a complete joke of a company and I will never buy a large item through Amazon again if I have to deal with CEVA.Bottom line: Yes it would be great to have a 60\" TV, but if you have $1K to spend on a set, go with a slightly smaller Sony, Samsung, Panasonic or LG. You get what you pay for. Do not buy a TV from any online store that does not have a physical location near your home. I've learned my lesson. Yes, you may save money on shipping, but you had better hope that the TV works flawlessly and you never have to return it. If you have to deal with CEVA it could be an absolute nightmare. Also, make sure you have someone in your family who is free to sit at your house and needlessly spend 3-4 days waiting on them to show up.", "Date": "January 1, 2013"}, {"Title": "WOW, i cannot believe the quality of this TV.", "Author": "Johnathan Bringmann", "ReviewID": "R3Q4X4UKF0ZR8R", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This TV is amazing!!!

Sound was still on and there was dim backlight, but no picture. I did some quick research and noted numerous complaints regarding this model experiencing the same problem -- seems to happen to a lot of these TVs bought over the 2012 holidays.I contacted Vizio the next day and found out they have a customer support team specifically set up to handle this now well-known problem -- pretty much admitting it is something they expect. When I explained what happened they immediately offered a choice of maintenance support in 3-5 days, or they would ship a new one in 8-14 days. No questions asked. I didn't want to go through this again in a few months so I asked how they are addressing the problem on the newer models now, specifically the one they would send us. They said they have changed out the questionable boards on this model so I opted for a new replacement to be delivered and am currently awaiting shipment.As for the TV itself, when it was working prior to the failure, set up was easy and the picture was excellent, except for some pixelation during fast action. I'm not sure if some of that was due to the board or if that is common with this TV. The sound is adequate only, so I connected it through a receiver so I get surround sound watching movies or playing video games.

As a I understand most of these  super thin TVs have poor sound, I would at-least get a sound bar to go with it.- Remote is awkward. While I applaud the effort to put in a full keyboard, it just feels funny when you hold it in your hand.

It was an all-around fantastic experience.TV reviews go into a lot of detail about specs that the average viewer will never experience or understand.  All you need to know is that the picture is amazing and this TV is almost certainly better than your current TV.  I watched a weekend worth of football, racing, and Blu-Ray movies.  Everything was a HUGE step up from my previous HDTV.  My previous TV also was 1080P and 120 Hz, yet this Vizio blows it away.  Even my wife, who could not care less, commented that the picture was an amazing change from the previous TV.Picture:  Very clear and crisp.  I am amazed at how the picture gives depth.  It almost looks 3D.  Very impressive.  My commented that she could now see all of the detail in people's faces.  It is that clear.  Blu-Ray was amazing.  Sports (football and racing) was very smooth action and crystal clear.  The picture is crisp, all the way to the edge.Connections:  We are using HDMI.Form:  Very thin bezel, which looks very nice.  The stand is basic, but looks nice.  I also appreciate that they do not use a bright \"power on\" light on the TV.  It is just a very dim white light in the lower left corner.  The TV is also very thin.Sound:  I cannot comment on the sound, as I use a surround sound system and I turn the TV speakers off.Remote:  The remote is very cool.

And it is a Smart TV. The colors are very accurate and very very good in bright room. The TV works great right outside the box but tweaking is needed for better picture quality. The QWERTY keyboard is heaven sent feature that all remotes should have it. It is so much easier to type things on screen when needed. This remote uses infrared to signal the TV, so you have to keep its sensor towards the TV but i was able to type perfectly fine from 14 feet away regardless of viewing angles, as long as you are pointed in its general direction.The best feature I love about this TV is its ability to play media via DLNA servers. As long as you are on the same network (Wifi or hard wired) you can listen to your music from your computer. This TV is definitely DLNA compatible.To make this feature work for you, i used Windows Media Player as Media Server and I was able to conveniently add music or save movies or videos to my computer's library, and watch & listen them on the Vizio.  All I have to do is Via Button>Media>and up pops the Computer's Library (DLNA 1) to use. I can also put .mkv or .mp4 movies/videos on USB flash drivers and it will play via its USB port but will not playback .avi files.Cons:1) This TV cannot match the black-level performance of Plasma, but definitely comes close to it after tweaking.2) Out-of-box needs tweaking for better picture quality3) You can download the Skype app, but will not work as this TV does not support Skype Camera of anytime.4)  There is a slight lag on the apps to cycle thought but not a deal breaker. But there is no way to configure the keys of the remote to your favorite apps.5) No 3D, but definitely not a deal breaker for me, my previous TV was 3D but IMHO i watched 3 3D movies in 3 years.6) The sound quality is awful from this TV so I definitely recommend using external sound source like surround sound systems.Here are my settings for the TV but you may change according to your liking:Hint: all picture settings can be changed, and there are lot of different settings in built.Picture Mode = CustomBacklight = 70 to 80Brightness = 54Contrast = 65Color = 49Tint = 0Sharpness = 3Color Temp = CustomRed Gain = 104Green Gain = 128Blue Gain = 0Red Offset = 129Green Offset = 128Blue Offset = 134Smooth Motion Effect = LowReal Cinema Mode = OffNoise Reduction = OffMPEG NR = OffColor Enhancement = OffAdaptive Luma = LowBacklight Control = OffAmbient Light Sensor = OffRemember, this is LED and not a plasma. If you want the best quality because you are videophile then go with plasma.Summary:Black Levels: Good but not great like plasmasColor Accuracy: Very accurate minor discolorationVideo Processing: Most of the movies are rendered 1080p/24 for its cadence. The Vizio has two settings that affect cadence/smoothness, named Smooth Motion Effect (SME) and Real Cinema Mode (RCM), and each has three positions. Among the possible combinations, the only one that rendered behavior as described above was Off/Off for both.The other SME settings introduce some level of artificial-looking smoothing/dejudder to film-based sources. As usual the Low/Medium/High options got progressively smoother. Meanwhile Real Cinema Mode (RCM) -- disabled when you turn off SME -- has Precision, Smooth, and Off settings of its own. Off introduced the least smoothing but did show that stuttering cadence; while Precision and Smooth, which introduced excessive smoothing again, looked basically the same to my eyes.Bright Light: It has matte finish, so no reflection, Works really good. But wish there as a glass in the front to protect the LED screen.Overall, this TV serves the purpose I wanted, cheap, superb picture quality with few compromises.

I just like the thought of knowing that I can watch football and see that the field is green and not some dark algae color like on some tvs. I read some reviews on cnet stating that the color isn't as accurate on panasonic brands and sharps which have a higher price tag. While that is somewhat true, if you read the reviews from others, if you set the color right, then you won't have to worry about the color. Just follow what one reviewer put on here or go to cnet for the color accuracy. The profile for this tv is so thin and the bezel is almost non existent!

I like buying from Costco because of their vetting process, great return policy, and extra year warranty on most electronics (2 years instead of 1).From what I can tell, this model was launched in September of 2012 and had a few bugs for the first few months or so, but it looks like Vizio has worked them out and the models on shelves today are mostly fine...  Also, from what I have read, it looks like those who did have problems were taken care of by Vizio.A few months ago I bought a 55\" JVC Black Sapphire from Costco for $679 and have been pretty happy with it and was planning to buy another for the den.  But when I got to Costco and saw the JVC and the Vizio next to each other, I couldn't help but notice how much more presence the 60\" Vizio seemed to have over the 55\" JVC for just $90 more...  So  I bought the Vizio.I am certainly not a huge technophile, but am pretty picky in general .  That being said, I think the picture quality of the Vizio  is excellent!  Not only that, but it is also highly adjustable and can be fine tuned to look it's best in it's environment.  There are a few preset picture modes, but I am sure you will find that adjusting the parameters inside those modes will yield noticeable changes that make sense.I was very impressed with the boxing...  The TV is completely protected in solid foam and is easily unpacked by releasing 4 cleverly designed latches on the bottom of the box which allow you to easily lift off the top.  (I also found that it is repacked just as easily... but more on that later.)Inside the box, the mounting base was neatly packed into grooves in the foam, as was the box containing the remote, mounting screws and power cord.  It does come with AAA batteries for the remote which is nice.The remote itself does feel a little cheap, but is perfectly functional and does have the handy QWERTY keyboard on back which makes entering information a little easier.  I do wish it was backlit, but for the price... who could complain?The TV itself is handsome and has a high end look.  The bezel is very thin, making this a sleek looking unit.  The bezel frame and mounting base are all black, offering a very clean look.  Upon powering up, it goes into a setup mode which is intuitive.  The startup time is pretty short.It has a few apps, but I only use Netflix.  Shows load very quickly with my cable internet.  The wifi receiver seems to be sensitive as it is showing full bars even though the TV is downstairs and the wifi transmitter is upstairs.There is one feature that this TV has that I hate, but can be disabled...  It is the auto adjust brightness feature that causes the screen to \"blink\" lighter and darker while watching.  It is meant to adjust the picture to best suit the ambient light in the room, but the adjustments are very noticeable, abrupt, and extremely annoying!  In fact, I called the \"Costco Concierge\" customer support line to see if there was something that could be done about it.  They could not explain why it was doing that because the help line worker had the wrong menu information for my model.  Since they could not tell me how to disable it,I assumed it was a bad unit out of the box and took it back to Costco for an exchange!I brought the second TV home and it did the same thing!  Ugh!  At this point, I was pretty disgusted that this feature could not be disabled, but I eventually figured it out and realized that the first TV was actually just fine.  The trick is that not only do you have to disable the auto brightness feature, but you also have to disable the brightness control in the advance menu.  After doing that, the issue went away.When I took the first TV back to Costco, I asked the lady at the returns counter if she saw many of these Vizios come back...  Her answer was \"No...  But a lot of Samsungs do get returned with problems.\"  Interesting.Being a \"bang for your buck\" type guy, I could not imagine paying any more money for another set given the features and picture of this one!

I sat in line for 6 hours on Black Friday 2012 and was 6th out of 20 to get this TV.  I got it home, out of the box and setup and was wowed by the impressive video quality.  At 52.5lbs, removal from the box is definitely a two person job.  The video quality is comparable to other units that I've paid thousands for.  True blacks, vivid colors and bright whites make watching my movie collection a blast!  With a thin flat glossy bezel that matches the base, the TV is ready for stand or wall-mount.  While on the base, the TV doesn't Pivot, which, in most scenarios isn't much of a loss.The built-in apps are just okay in my opinion, with some stutter or lag in the interface.  The apps are accessed by pressing the Vizio Internet Apps (VIA) button in the middle of the remote.  YouTube searches return a limited number of results with no option to load more.  Netflix and Hulu apps work okay, but I prefer the apps on my XBox 360 or Roku.  Netflix, Hulu, Amazon, and YouTube videos tend to buffer quite a bit using the built-in SmartApps.  Facebook and news apps also work well.  The Yahoo Widgets and available apps for download could use some diversity.  You also have a limited number of widgets/apps that can be installed at one time.  A built in USB media player works well for displaying photos and HD video loops or screensavers, or even movies (WMA/WMV/and some AVI/MPG).  I currently have this unit setup wired, but I've tried wireless as well.  Performance for me is basically the same on both.The built-in audio quality is quite good for a TV.  Two rear and two side HDMI ports, two USB ports and side located component/composite video inputs plus ethernet port, analog and digital audio inputs and VGA input provide plenty of connection options.  The remote control is a one-piece two sided unit that could use some improvement.  One side is a standard remote, while the flip-side is a QWERTY keyboard for typing text.  It feels solid and well built, however the small rubber buttons are not very sensitive, and aren't backlit.Getting the settings perfect for my environment and preferences took about 20-30 minutes with some HD source reference material.  Once set, the contrast and brightness work well and the colors are rich and vivid.  The 1920X1080 resolution and 120Hz refresh rate ensures optimal video and game quality.  Peripheral or off-axis viewing is also better than many comparable units.  This unit doesn't support 3D, but for us it's not really a big loss.When playing Video games, I noticed a perceptible \"lag\" where I would press my joystick and there would be small delay before my on-screen character moved.  I was dismayed and was worried that I'd have to take the TV back.  After some digging I found the solution to the problem.  First:  Switch to the input that the game console is located on.  2.  Press Menu >Picture> Picture Mode and change from 'standard' to 'game'.  3rd.  Press menu, choose the gear icon for 'settings'.  Move down to \"Game Mode\" selection and change from 'off' to 'On'.  Lag problem fixed.  It took me a few hours on forums to find out this undocumented fix.

I chose this television. This review is based on my initial assessment of the television, as I've only had it for a day. I will update the review after some long term use.I chose the Vizio due to the fact that, even though the Panasonic was rated higher in terms of picture quality, unfortunately it only had 2 HDMI inputs. The Vizio has 4. Everything in my living room runs on HDMI (XBOX 360, Cable, and Blu-Ray), so that was a deal-breaker for me for the Panasonic. I read a lot of reviews for this Vizio and I bumped into a lot of complaints about the remote control failing and the screen going black after minimal use. Most of these reviews came from people who purchased earlier models. Vizio addressed this issue and let people know that models that had serial numbers \"....WAN100... through ...WAN-800...\" were susceptibe to failing, so when I purchased mine (at BJs Wholesale) I checked to see if the serial number was printed on the box. It was! I chose the television with the highest batch/serial number AWAY from the faulty ones, so I ended up getting a serial number in the range \"...WAP300...\" so I am confident I will not have a problem.Out of the box, I was quite impressed with how thin the set was, but I was also concerned at how small the base was. After installing the base, I found that it's pretty sturdy. It wobbles a bit when jumping around (I have the Kinect for the 360), but nothing that would have me concerned that it would tip over. The frame/bezel of the television is really thin, giving you more television screen (60.04\" measured diagonally), but the downside to that is the speakers for the television are in back of the set. So if you don't have a surround sound system, the television sound will sound pretty cheesy. But I imagine that anyone in the market for a 60\" TV probably has a good system in place.After connecting my cable, Xbox and Blu-Ray, I turned the TV on and it walks you through the setup which is really simple. MAKE SURE YOU CHOOSE \"HOME USE\" WHEN IT ASKS YOU. Your other choice is \"Store\". This tweaks all of the settings to give you the recommended store settings, which could be way too bright and sharp for your tastes. Choose home use and tweak your audio/video settings yourself. You can register your TV if you are connected to the internet via wi-fi or hard-wire. It was cool to use the QWERTY keyboard on the back of the remote control. There are a couple of bad things about the remote; The keyboard on the back of the remote doesn't include numbers, so if you have an email address and/or password with a mix of alpha-numeric characters, you'll get a little annoyed having to keep flipping the remote over to type in letters on one side, and numbers on the other. The other downside to the remote, is when you're using the keyboard you have to be careful because it's not bluetooth, and if you hold the remote too perpendicular to your body, it doesn't register your key presses. Not a huge deal, but it can be annoying for those who would do searches on the apps that come with/can be installed on the TV.Once the setup was done, and after some tweaking of the visuals, I must say that I was impressed. The picture quality was noticeably better than my 52\" Sharp AQUOS LCD that it replaced. I wanted to see for myself about this \"Soap Opera Effect\" that is so polarizing with people. I turned on the Smoothing effect and turned it to the highest setting. I thought that it would be more annoying than it was. It did, in fact look like I was watching a soap opera on some shows, but my wife and I thought that it was pretty cool. To each his own. The good news is, you can turn it off if you prefer. We tested our Blu-Ray with a few different movies; Avatar, The Avengers and Finding Nemo. I must admit that, when watching Avatar, due to the smoothness of the motion and some of the shaky camera action, it was a little disorienting, but after a couple of minutes I got used to it. My wife even yelled, \"Well, there. look. Sigourney Weaver is in my living room!\" We tried The Avengers and Finding nemo afterwards and we were not disappointed. Absolutely beautiful. I'm sure that that there are TVs with a better picture quality, but not at this price-point and features.Some of you may have to adjust and/or your picture horizontally or vertically, which can be done in the menus, because the viewing area of the TV is larger than what the channel is projecting, so you may see a staticky digital bar on the edge(s) of your screen. Simple fix though, so don't panick.My only complaint about this TV is that you can notice some uniformity issues during pure black periods of viewing, like in between commercials, a pitch black room in a movie, etc. Certain areas of the screen look like a lighter shade of black than other areas. It doesn't bother me, but if you're used to plasma TVs and their near-perfect black levels, you'll probably find it a bother.Aside from a few little things, this TV is absolutely perfect for the price.", "Date": "April 5, 2013"}, {"Title": "Love this T.V.", "Author": "Grandma", "ReviewID": "R1TXNEAIM1AHQC", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "It took us a long time to decide on a big screen TV but finally after much research we purchased the 60\u201d VIZIO.

It was delivered on time, for free, and the drivers were helpful and professional. They informed me I would be unable to test my new TV until it came up to room temperature (3-5 hours)as it was winter in Chicago and the cold truck was below the ideal operating temperature. After a brief Google search I discovered that, sadly, they were right and I would have to wait to use it. Even powered off the TV looks great. Slim, sleek and shiny.When it finally came time, I turned on the screen and after a few minor adjustments, I was amazed by the picture quality. (A personal suggestion, turn off the \"smooth motion setting\" it creates a bizarre soap opera effect on everything.) Set-up was a breeze. Wi-Fi, digital cable, PlayStation and receiver were working together in no time. The included apps (Netflix, Amazon, etc.) run a little less smoothly than they do on my PS3 but they're not terrible and the included QWERTY keypad on the back of the remote makes the interface more enjoyable. There are 4 HDMI ports (more than most other 60') and you can name each of them on the TV so switching between inputs is super easy. The menu is not as intuitive as I would like but after you get used to it, navigating the settings is simple enough.There was one MAJOR problem, however. Once a day, at random intervals, the TV would just power down. It would always turn back on from the remote but, obviously, it was a nuisance. It happened across every type of use. Cable, PlayStation, native applications, everything. I tried a factory reset, changed outlets, surge protectors, and any settings having to do with power. No dice. I searched the internet and discovered that, although this was not a common problem, it was not unheard of. Many people had theories as to why this was happening, and suggestions on how to fix it, none of which worked.Realizing I was going to be unable to solve this problem myself, I emailed Vizio directly with a description of the problem. The next day they told me to contact Customer Service by phone. That annoyed me because I hate talking on the phone but, whatever. I called and spoke to an unbelievably friendly and helpful woman named Sandy who was in South Dakota. It was refreshing to speak with someone who not only spoke English but was pleasant and knowledgeable as well. I honestly cannot remember the last time I enjoyed dealing with a Customer Service Representative. She apologized, told me that Vizio was aware of the problem and that they would FedEx a new board to a local repair shop who would contact me to set up an in home appointment and take care of the problem.To my surprise, I was contacted that night by the repairman and informed that the service request was made and the part should arrive in 2 days. As promised he called back when he had the part and scheduled a time the very next day to stop by. The repair man arrived within the scheduled window, was polite and professional and in 15 minutes he was done.Since then, 2 weeks ago, I have had zero issues with my TV. I could not be more impressed with the way Vizio and the people they used, handled the situation.

I purchased it yesterday from Best Buy for $899 and I have been more than pleased with my purchase. The television looks even better at home than it does in the store. While at Best Buy I spent a lot of time going back and forth between the Vizio, Samsung, and the Sharp and the Vizio seemed to offer the best reviews as well as the cheapest price. While the Samsung smart tv might be appealing to the eye, it had the poorest reviews which is surprising for a television that costs $3k and up.I bought my first Vizio 32\" about 6 years ago and still have it in one of my guest bedrooms. It still work the same as the day I opened it, so I decided to consider the same brand when looking for a 60\". Overall I would have to say that I am more than satisfied with this tv.As far as screen quality and adjustments, I utilized the review provided on here by Kris and the picture quality is amazing. I however like that \"soap opera\" look so I do leave that feature on. Easy to turn off though.Also, make sure that your cable box is set to 1080p or 1080i. I forgot to check this until the next day and now the picture is even better!!The only con that I have found with this tv as of now is that the MGo feature does not work. Not sure really what it even is for, but a little obnoxious that there is a permanent button on the remote that will not do anything for who knows how long.And one more thing, I am pretty disappointed that the remote cannot be paired with any of my other devices such as my home theater system or even my cable box. So unfortunately, unless you want to lose the Qwerty remote, you gave to get used to using two or more different remotes.

I called Vizio tech support and was told that this is a known issue for which they are releasing a firmware update.\"Great, how can I get this update?\" I ask.\"We're pushing it out in batches of 1,000 at a time so as not to crash the server.

Everything worked fine out of the box, easy setup.  I should note that I'm not a major cinephile or audiophile, just an average user who watches about 2 hours a day between me and the wife...but for us the picture is great.I used some picture settings from CNET that I found online and they seem to make a really good picture.  If you were inclined to use a video tuning DVD you could probably get it down to near perfect, but honestly I can't really tell that much of a difference anyway and it isn't worth my time.  When it turns on, it shows a black screen with the Vizio logo...from that screen you see that the blacks aren't 100% uniform, but I still think the picture is fine and my wife gave me a crazy look when I pointed it out.We use it for cable television, netflix, and dvds mostly. We just moved into a new house and wanted a bigger television for the living room. The Netflix app works great for us over a standard wifi connection with WPA2.  The youtube app works fine as well.  We don't really use the other apps that came with it so I can't really comment.  The remote with QWERTY keyboard works very well and is useful for searching movies and clips on youtube.We use an LG speakerbar with a wireless sub, so I can't really comment on the speakers at-length, but they seemed fine for a normal size living room when compared to other built-in speakers I've used.  If you're an average user who wants a good quality 60 inch TV at a reasonable price with built in netflix, amazon prime, and youtube you won't be disappointed.  If you're the over-the-top home theater keeping-up-with-the-Jones' type who wants a picture that is top of the line and has 3000 pixels per molecule, then this obviously isn't for you.

Netfix, Amazon Prime and You Tube seem to work quite well, but for some reason Hulu playback will stutter at times, not sure whats up with that, the Roku box and PS3 which are right next to the TV on the same wifi network never stutter on Hulu.

I own two 42\" Vizio TVs so trusted the brand enough to order sight unseen.  I use it 60% as a computer monitor in the LR, the rest for watching cable TV.The picture quality if flat out amazing.  Blacks are blacker than regular LCD, the color depth and saturation was perfect out of the box.  Works great with Amazon Prime free videos and Netflicks with easy setup.  DVDs look real like you are a part of the picture, with lifelike color and brightness.  The only think I noticed is that you see more artifacts with YouTube videos simple because the screen is so large, so flaws in the video are more obvious.Remote is quite good, with a keyboard on the back that doesn't get in the way.  Much more intuitive than previous remotes.  Setup and menu functions are WAY more intuitive.  Renaming the HDMI inputs as \"Cable TV\" and \"PC\" were simple and fast.  The whole menu system is an overlay to the TV, significantly faster and easier than just a couple years ago.

After unboxing it and setting it up on the wall - very nice TV. It had great picture quality, little light bleed, and the imbedded Netflix app worked very well. The sound is a problem - constant lipsync issues with Time Warner cable and Netflix both - these are fixed by the lip sync timing function on the TV, but it's very frustrating to have to do that a couple times a week.Worse, less than a week after setup, it has stopped working and will not turn on at all. We've tried plugging and unplugging it multiple times, different wall sockets, the remote and the physical buttons, and it just wouldn't work. It's going back now.Pros:- Great picture quality, good blacks, little light bleed, etc. I was impressed, especially for the price.- Imbedded Netflix and Amazon apps work well- Thin bezel along with a thin TV gives it a stellar look against the wall. Very happy with that.Cons:- Lipsync issues. Ugh, I've never had this problem with a TV before and it was remarkably annoying. I'm very sensitive to this and it bothered me a lot.- No options for other apps to download- Weak DLNA function crashed frequently when grabbing items from my NAS. It couldn't handle the hundreds of videos on there, it seems.- Worst, it broke within a week.

For me it comes down to one word - Picture.  And this TV really does deliver in that category.  I always though I had a great Picture in 1080i and I did.  BUT this TV has 1080p and that is a world apart as far as clarity and wow!  The TV does not support 480i, but will support and switch automatically into 480p, 720p, 1080i and 1080p.  The biggest problem here is that knowing 1080p is out there, I have a really hard time watching some channels (networks) that are not broadcasting in the highest quality HD signals available.Sound - hey this is not my Bose Wave Radio/CD player.  It is a TV and has sound dependent on different broadcasters.  The built in Surround System does a very good job, but is not an Audiophile's dream system.  I can enjoy the sound of the Tenners on PBS just as well as Football or Wrecks at NASCAR.  If you want a better sound system, they are all over the place, invest in one, but this is more than adequate in my opinion.Internet Access:  Sure does have it and it works fine.  Speed of access is dependent only on the speed of your connection.  Mine buzzes right along and internet access is a lot faster than Direct TV.  Not as many \"wait while buffering\" messages.  In fact none while using internet access.Remote Control:  Really must have to access internet functions.  Cannot use to control Direct TV, so you will still have to have at least 2 remotes.  Backside of remote is QWERTY and used to enter information at times, not really that great but looks nice, can use the front just as well with a little more movement of keys.Last: Picture one more time.

Although I wasn\u2019t able to get a Black Friday type price, Amazon did have a brief price change on their site.  It went from high to lower and back to high again.  I contacted Amazon asking about their price-matching because I saw a lower price at a \u201cdiscount club\u201d.  Initially the rep said I did not qualify since they (Amazon) had to add the \u201cclub membership of $40.00\u201d to the club price.  That would have brought it back very close to Amazon\u2019s price.  We hung up the call and within 2 minutes the rep called me back.  He realized that Amazon had made the price change I mentioned above and said I DID qualify.  He issued a credit to my account which was reflected within 24 hours.  I also got Amazon\u2019s 2% bonus credited to me \u201cfor use on a future purchase\u201d.  Shipping & Delivery \u2013As an Amazon Prime subscriber I was offered delivery on 11/28.  Since Amazon also offered \u201cwhite glove\u201d delivery, with a scheduled date & time, I opted for it.  My TV was delivered on 12/1.  Although the delivery was about 1 hour late, I was still satisfied with it.  Sound \u2013I was OK with the sound from the TV speakers but I certainly recognize that there are MANY better options.  Having them rear-facing dampens whatever comes out of them.  As a result, I added a sound bar to my setup.  I am using the Vizio SB4021M-A1.  It requires one optical connection and a power connection.  Now everything sounds GREAT.  Wall Mount \u2013I opted for a wall mount from Monoprice(dot)com (less than $30.00).  It is a flush mount which can tilt some 15*.  With the TV mounted the front bezel is 4 inches from the wall.  The mount is \u201cPID 4174\u201d and is described as  \u201cPREMIUM Adjustable Tilting 2.5mm Wall Mount Bracket for LCD LED Plasma (Max 165Lbs, 30~63inch) BLACK\u201d on the web site.  This is one sturdy mount.  With a little help from the Mrs. it was installed & TV hanging in about 45 minutes.  Picture --I, like most users of this TV have played with the picture settings to obtain those which are ideal to me.  I have mine set pretty well, but I am still experimenting with them.  The quality of the picture and the colors etc. are just GREAT.  I\u2019ve heard many people complain about theirs, but mine are all anyone could ask for.  Accessories --I have a Vizio sound bar model SB4021M-A1 attached.  I also have a Samsung Blu-Ray Disc/DVD Player model BD-EM57C attached to my TV.  I opted to use HDMI ports 3 and 4 for my connections.  (Some people had difficulty using HDMI 1 due to its ARC feature and they thought it was possibly their lip sync problem too).  Issues \u2013Many people have complained about getting the BSOD (black screen of death) which led to repairs and or replacement of the TV.  I have not had such an encounter.I have had a minimal amount of lip sync, but the more I watch and pay attention, it appears to be a particular program on a particular network rather than a TV issue.  As a result, I have no complaint.The VIA bar (access to the SMART features) leaves a bit desired.  However, I didn't buy this TV to use it as a computer.  I've had no issues with any of the apps within the VIA bar, e.g. NETFLIX and others.  Conclusion \u2013I would definitely recommend this TV to anyone looking for a 60\u201d flat screen.  This TV replaced a Samsung 56\u201d DLP set that was about 7 years old.

There was no difference in price and I wanted to see the floor model before I bought. But I like the Amazon user reviews, this is my 'go-to' site for user reviews so I want to contribute my experience with this TV.The 60 inch screen is BIG! Not TOO big, mind you, but big enough, and we have a large family room, I think. I'm glad I let my wife talk me out of that 70 inch screen.  It would have overpowered that room. I suspect you won't see many TVs much larger than 70 inches in size in the future, I can't imagine a room in a typical family home that could handle such a screen.  Remember, they look a lot smaller in the showroom! It replaced an old 48 inch 1st gen Panasonic rear projection HD TV that was showing its age (but was plenty big screen wise)Image quality and color is REALLY good, and I have not noticed the narrow angle of view issue that many reviews refer to and I think we have a wide viewing angle in our family room. Image quality is good EVEN when using 75 ohmn coax, IQ with the composite cables are at least as good as with coax.  We have digital, but not HD cable service, so I guess we get our signal in at 480p from cable, but the image is excellent, better than the old Panny.From other user reviews, I had done my research and was prepared to make the needed adjustments that would take care of any lip synch issues I might encounter.  However, I didn't have any lip synch problems.  I wonder if that issue is related to a certain brand or type of cable box.Netflix and Amazon have dedicated buttons on the remote so using them is EASY.  Netflix comes in at 720p as always, and the image is amazing on this TV. I don't use Amazon prime.Regarding the remote, it's pretty cool.  On one side, it is a standard remote with dedicated Netlix and Amazon buttons on the front, and on the flip side,it has a full QUERTY Chicklet type keyboard. On the keyboard side, there are also some gaming type control buttons.  You can download games from the app store (run by Yahoo on behalf of Vizio).  Other apps include Crackle, Hulu+, Vudu, etc. Pretty much similar in variety and in operation to the Roku store. More on this in a bit.The sound is typical tiny and tinny tv sound.  But in defense, the bezel (the frame) around the screen is only about 1/2 inch wide and an inch or so deep, not a lot of space for room filling speakers.  I think we will buy a sound bar for this set eventually.  But I have some spare higher quality PC speakers, in the meantime, I will look into hooking them up.Edit 1/15/13:I've tried to hook up my computer speakers to this TV only to discover that there is no 3.5 mm mini-plug outlet.  There are 2 RCA audio connections on the back and theoretically you can get a converter that converts to a female mini-plug, but Best Buy and HH Greg don't seem to carry them.  I guess I could order from Amazon or other internet vendor, but it seems kind of crazy to pay all that shipping if you don't have other things to buy.  I'll try Radio Shack across town later today.Major problem? No, but a bit of a pain, yes.  The 3.5 mini-plug socket should be part of any device with audio, in my mind.End of Edit:Set up was kind of odd. My Comcast cable box is considered an antenna source if using 75 ohm coax, but a cable connection if using composite cables on the same cable box. (My Comcast Cable box doesn't have HDMI).  The directions could have been clearer on this.I think the User Interface for set up is kind of complex and not very intuitive. I think it could be easier to use. As I said earlier, you have the ability to download apps to the TV from Yahoo even a few games and special Yahoo content apps, however that process seems kind of hidden.  Once you get to it, it works great and it's easy, but getting there is a tad difficult.  That being said, it is unlikely a child would accidentally get there and download something you don't want on your set.The wireless internet connectivity works pretty well.  My wireless router is about 40 feet away on the same floor as the TV.  Set up was relatively easy, but the TV set could be a little better in telling you the status of your connection. I had connected to my router on the first try, but hadn't realized it.  So I kept trying to complete the connection and it kept telling me that all it could find were my neighbor's networks.  Finally I realized it also kept telling me that the network I was on might be a bit slow.  (It isn't, trust me, this, I know) So I tried to get on to Netflix, and son of a gun! it worked!All the confusion aside, once you get the TV set up the way you like, the day to day operation is pretty straight forward and not difficult to use. But getting there could be easier.  Vizio needs to work on the out of box user experience I think.I feel I got a lot for my money, and I would buy it again.  If the users are tech savvy, then they should not hesitate to buy this TV.  But if the users need help setting up a regular tv then they will need someone to help them set this TV up for sure.  But like I said earlier, the day to day operation is pretty easy.

With all that being said, if your looking for 3D in the here and now, go for an LG which is using passive 3D glasses able to see only 540 to each eye rather then active 3D glasses Full 1080P to each eye Panasonic and Samsung use, but it's going to cost you plenty more. I may also add that passive 3D glasses are cheaper, lighter and also don't require a battery.The screen is a bit reflective, but less so than other LED TVs costing much more.As far as the brand goes, Vizio is considered on the lower end by enthousiasts. Judging by the performace of this set AFTER it is calibrated one can certainly argue that point.I'm hoping it is durable enough to get me by until 4K becomes affordable.I would recommend this TV, but the settings need to be tweeked or you'll be looking to spend hundreds more on another brand to match its size and specs.", "Date": "December 6, 2012"}, {"Title": "Good product for the price", "Author": "Sunny K", "ReviewID": "R25FE4E0T44E0P", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This is a good product for the price.

I sometimes feel like I'm watching a play on broadway rather than an actual Hollywood movie. The clarity couldn't be better. I can literally see the pores on people's faces.All of my prior TV's, in my opinion, were thin enough. This TV is so thin, that in order to really get any thinner it would just have to be a screen and that's it. It's about an inch and a half thick.The sound quality is surprisingly not bad. Let's face it, you don't buy a TV for the sound quality. I mean where are they supposed to put the speakers in a TV that is an inch a half thick? Having said that, I can actually turn up the volume to where it's pretty loud (over half way) and it doesn't get distorded like all of my prior TVs did.The best part about the TV, in my opinion, is the fact that it's a smart TV. I love that I can listen to my favorite radio stations on Pandora or flip over to Netflix and watching a movie in stunning HD. I also love the fact that if I'm bored and want to search the web for funny or interesting videos I can do it right there on my TV on a massive 60\" screen rather than my little 16\" laptop. You can also browse Facebook and update your status on the TV as well.The setup is extremely user friendly. Within the same day, I was cruising through the menu and was pushing buttons on the remote without even looking. Speaking of the remote, it pretty much has every button that you would ever need to work the TV and all the aspects of the TV without being overwhelming and not being confused. You can go straight to Netflix with a push of a button as well as a couple of other applications. The only negative thing I have to say about the remote is that I can't program it to work my blu ray player (not that I'm aware of anyway).Overall, I'm extremely satisfied with my purchase. For the price compared to the larger named brands, you really can't beat it. The picture quality combined with it being a smart TV is an excellent duo.

No problems at all.So - the TV itself. OMG. The first thing I streamed from Amazon came across in HD and I literally was standing in my living room with my mouth open. Just amazing picture! I have since purchased a BluRay player - another thing I had been procrastinating on- and OMG again!!!! Worth every penny!!! I've used the Netflix and Amazon streaming apps and they work great. The remote is great - I have no problems with it. The display is sharp and brilliant even with the blinds open by it. The sound is good - particularly as compared to my Bravia. Note - I have not purchased the sound bar. I live in a condo and have to consider my neighbors so I won't really blast it but I haven't needed to put the volume above about 40.Hiccups -I think my wireless is a little fickle. If I stream to the Vizio, shut the TV off, and go to my Bravia and stream there, when I go back to the Vizio it takes a 2nd request for it to find my wireless. But it does every time. Honestly, I don't care enough about it to worry.I'm not wildly fond of the interface of the Amazon streaming app - it doesn't seem to have my watchlist unless I'm just missing something.

I would have preferred Amazon but the competition had the better deal that day.The picture is unbelievable. At some times it looks almost 3D or that you're looking out a window instead of into a screen. I won't even consider another brand than Vizio after seeing this tv. As far as I can see the picture is as good or better than a Sony or LG or any other brand costing several hundreds more for the same size screen but fewer features or inputs.I only have 2 gripes. One is the sound. The volume range is 0-100 and I usually have mine set in the 40-50 range to understand what people are saying and i'm directly in front of the tv at 10 feet yet when I go into the adjoining rooms I hear and understand the speech much better? My guess is the ultra thin design just doesn't make for good speakers or speaker placement. It's like the speakers were put in facing the back or something. Lastly that on non HD programs I sometimes see thin white horizontal lines like bits of string at the very top of the screen that move left and right and change width with the movement of the show. This may be a defect with my particular tv I will be taking this up with Vizio support. But I can elliminate the problem by simply switching to the HD version of that channel...lines gone. And why would I want to watch/record a show in 480I if it's available in 1080I (cable DVR's display only 1080I to save bandwidth. To get 1080P you need Satellite DVR's I want G4 and AMC so I'm stuck with 1080I cable) anyways and 90% of what I watch is on networks with HD available.UPDATE: The white line issue was a senior moment on my part. This is my 1st Flat screen TV all I had to compare it with was PC monitors and my laptop. I was unaware you could adjust the screen left/right/up/down These features are greyed out and unusable on my PC monitor. moving the screen just 2 points vertical eliminated the white lines. So I am upgrading the TV to 5 stars.About support; Vizio is outstanding. I made a call when the tv arrived because it was very cold outside and wanted to know if I needed to let the tv acclamate to inside temp before turning it on. My wait time was less than 5 minutes and I actually got to speak to a very pleasant person who could actually speak ENGLISH for a change!!! No outsourced support with an Indian guy named \"Bob\" and an accent so thick you can cut it with a knife speaking through a crappy scratchy sounding headset. Clear crisp English that I had no problem understanding with my tinnitus. It was a pleasure to speak with them instead of a chore asking them to repeat every other word over and over again.UPDATE regarding support. I think it's also worth noting that Vizio reads customer reviews and comments and attempts to resolve any issue a customer puts in his comments at least on walmart.com. That just shows their level of commitment to their customers. I am just blown away by the quality of support I see and have received.I wish I could give this TV and Vizio a 4.5 out of 5 instead of just a 4.Because the white line issue was my ignorance and not the TV I raised my review to 5 stars. I don't like to give 5 star \"perfect\" reviews because so many customers default to 5 stars or 1 and that's an emotional reaction not an accurate rating of the product. Like it automatic perfect 5 one small issue and people hit it with a 1 out of anger not taking into account the good things about it or the issue could be with them and not the product as was with me an the white line issue. I would prefer to rate items like PC software is rated. I would give it a 96/100 because I'm still having audio issues with hearing but not understanding speech when I'm in front of the TV yet hearing it fine from the sides or rear of the set even from another room. I'm listening at 45 and my poor wife who's trying to take a nap is getting blasted with like a 75 in the bedroom 25 feet away. I'm no audiophile I just want clear sound so I don't do external sound setups nor do I need another remote to misplace.

This is my 3rd Vizio and I have never experienced a problem with them. The little 24\" in my sun room is ideal. The 5-year old Gallevia 46\" that had been in the living room is now in the master bedroom. Talk about an upgrade!!Now, to the quibbles. I absolutely hate the remote control. I realize that, in this smart phone world, most purchasers will not mind the remote. Count me out. I don't and won't have a smart phone, even though I have a perfectly serviceable cell phone. I tried the Vizio Co-Star video streamer and returned it because of the ridiculous remote. I'm 69 years old and have always been very comfortable with a standard 10-key key pad (telephone or calculator). Even those are becoming a little difficult to use as the arthritis in my hands (particularly my thumbs) becomes more pronounced. The tiny buttons on the remote are all but impossible for me to manage. It's not Vizio's fault. They've geared this device to a younger demographic and I understand that. Fortunately, the Gallevia's remote works perfectly well, is back-lit, and far easier for me to use thanks to the space between and around the buttons. I found one here on Amazon and have ordered it, so I'll have one for each of my \"big\" televisions.

One of them almost knocked the TV off the oak stand (yes, it was secured with earthquake straps). It swayed and twisted and I thought it was going to break off its actual pedestal, on which other reviewers have commented. For a TV this size, Vizio put little thought into its stand, which is smaller and lighter than the Gallevia's.

The one thing I did immediately was turn off Smooth Motion Effect/dejudder to eliminate the soap opera effect, which I find distracting.Connectivity is also a strength. It's surprisingly hard to find a budget friendly TV with 4 HDMI inputs these days (cable box, HTPC, XBOX, PS3), but this set had me covered.  I was also happy to see RCA analog audio outputs, which work well with my old receiver, so I can safely keep my 20th century audio rig running for another couple of years.The smart apps are neat. We've used the Netflix and YouTube apps quite a bit, and they are functional and convenient. The Netflix app crashed once on the first day we had the set, which caused the TV to power down, but haven't seen it since.The one flaw/minor annoyance that I've come up against is with playing video from my Plex media server using the built-in multimedia/DLNA app, which finds the media server but throws a \"file corrupt\" error when attempting open a video. There may be a workaround to get it working, but I have 3 other devices that can do this already, so definitely not a deal breaker.Overall, I'm very happy with the purchase. Going from a 46\" TV to 60\" set has been amazing, and I have no complaints about basic features, picture quality, or connectivity, which all I need.

I am sure under lab conditions with actual electronic testing equipment that this one would not compete well with more expensive sets, but for a casual viewer just watching television it is incredible.  We were all blown away the first time we watched the 1970's show Gilligan's Island on this set via Netflix.  You feel like you are looking out of a window instead of watching television.  I have no idea how they can make a 40 year old show look so realistic, but it really is impressive. In fact, at times it looks almost 3D it is so realistic (although this is not a 3D set).  The only weakness that this television has is that the speakers are not very loud, so we usually turn on a sound bar that we had previously purchased from Walmart.  The sound bar supplements the TV speakers very well, especially with the high frequency sounds.  With the bottom/back mounted speakers of the TV the sounds are a little muffled sounding, but the sound bar completely correct that.

When I first started with Comcast, I had seen one Vizio fail after another and swore to never to buy one. Samsung TV's always were so solid with rarely any issues at all. However, over the years I have seen Vizio TV's become more of a popular brand with many people recommending the brand to me. After seeing this TV in Best Buy for the same price as on Amazon, I decided to go for it. I will admit, I was furious when I was getting the HDMI audio-lip sync problem right off the bat when I started watching it. I knew it wasn't a cable box issue because I just swapped from my Samsung 50 inch LED to the new one with no issues before. Looking at the bad reviews, I learned that the old firmware was the source of the issue and after 2 days of waiting, I turned on the TV with the message: \"Your firmware has been updated to 1.1.5\". Since then, absolutely NO issues whatsoever, the picture rivals if not BEATS my Samsung LED!

Shipping was free quick and easy, was delivered right into my apartment with no problems. Waited 4 hours before turning it on due to the temperature adjustment then began setting it up.  Before this I had a 42 inch Dynex and when I set up this new TV I was blown away at how much bigger it is, the difference between 42\" and 60\" really is bigger then you'd think.  Make sure you can be at least 6 feet away from the TV when watching, or else you'll feel like you're in the first row at the movie theater. The picture is great, incredibly clear and sharp when watching blu rays or even playing 720p games.  Sadly when watching HD cable it doesn't look as good (though not bad) but that is because HD tv is in 1080i and not 1080p like a blu ray is. A number of people have complained that the speakers in the TV suck or are no good, but I actually find them to be just fine, and since the TV is so big, the two built in speakers are pretty spread out so you get a full sound (though I do recommend buying or using additional surround sound speakers for the added benefit of a sub and more power).I didn't set up or use any of the internet apps because come on, that's not why I bought the TV and I have a laptop, phone and PS3 to do all that on. The remote is good enough, and the interface to use while messing with all the settings on the TV is real easy.  The only complaint I can think of about the TV is when you have the backlighting on (which you don't need on if you turn off the ambient light sensor) and the screen is totally black, you can see some kind of uneven lighting at the edges of the screen. This bothered/freaked me out at first because I saw other people complaining about this issue, but as I said before, just turn off the backlighting and it goes away, and even if you don't turn off the backlighting, as soon as something comes on the screen that isn't completely all black, it's gone.The smooth motion (120hz) looks awesome once you get used to it, but some people just don't like it so luckily you can turn it off easily in the picture menu.

Well, black are blacks and Downton Abbey is dark show (a lot of dark rooms and black suits) and I used it to tune in the color (black level).  Overall, black level is fine with me.  I could tell from one episode to another that Downton Abbey changes the lighting in each room.  Overall, black level is not an issue with me.  Watching any TV show, sport, or Movie will not disappoint.  The TV show Survivor is so vivid you might as well be there on the beach with them.  Now if TV channel isn't High Def you wont see high definition and you can't blame that on the TV. In regard to sound, I was pleased.  The glare is minimum.  There are a total of five windows in our living room.  I ended up using the pre defined sports option to watch shows and turned off a majority of the options to find a picture that is pleasing. In regard to set-up, it couldn't be any easier. You hook up a few wires and the TV autoscans channels.  The netflix/amazon/youtube options are great.  The Netflix wifi options pulls in a better picture than our ROKU.  The remote is award winning.  You'll see once you begin to use it.

In spite of several reviews detailing problem riddled experiences I took the leap. Of faith... It looked to me like most problems were related to sets manufactured towards the last half of 2012. My set was manufactured in mid January 2013 so felt a sense of confidence.  We will see.Out the box the picture did require some tweaking which was easily enough done using settings kindly posted here by another reviewer. One nice thing about this set is settings are unique to the input used, so your dvd could send different video characteristics than cable or satellite.This is marketed as a smart tv but it is only half smart since it does not have an internet browser. On the other hand using Netflix was easy to launch and streamed flawlessly through my wireless network - no hiccups whatsoever.  Speaking of wireless, that too was very easy to set up if not entirely intuitive but still easily enough done. Signal is very strong since the router is only 12 feet away.  Haven't used the other apps as yet.  I still want to connect the vga but only my desktop has that kind of connection and not practical to use that way.  I guess I'll research a wireless connection.Viewing from extreme angles is pretty darn good.  The resolution can be very sharp and I have to question the DirecTV signal input since my 46in Sony seems sharper on the same channel in some cases. That could be a function of my satellite which has a disengaged stabilizing rod that is causing some minor issues and will be reattached tomorrow. Hopefully that will correct what appears to be inconsistency between the two sets.Sound from the set is not that important to me since I have externalized it so I have no input there.  It sounded ok when I did open it up, though.I did call Vizio support for some question regarding initial setup and they were very helpful.Once again about the resolution, there are some tweaks in the menu settings that you must do to get the full HD experience. Initial viewing gave me some pause which gave way to relief after fixing.Less than a week in I'm pretty happy so far.  Maybe I'll kick to 5 stars after more exercise.  Those darn bad reviews scare me.  I'm considering an extended warranty through Vizio.And thanks to all the other reviewers here that helped me with my purchase.Update 2/17/2013 - still working just fine.  Discovered that pausing netflix for maybe a half hour (dinner) the tv just turns off.  But no worries, after the 20 second boot up we were right back to where we paused (The Grey with Liam Neeson.  Don't waste your time, btw).  The blacks are not as black as my Sony but I can overlook that pretty much, not overly bothered by it.  Still trying to figure out what code works on my old Sony \"learning\" remote, RM-VL600.  Learning in quotes because the only way I find it knows a component is by the code only, as opposed to pointing remotes at each other to learn that way.Update 3/20/2013 - TV is still working just fine. As for the Sony remote mentioned above, there is a learn function I discovered and now it is a one button press to everything on and off - TV, DirecTV receiver and surround receiver. Another nice feature is connecting audio output from tv to surround receiver gets sound from whatever programming used.  In other words, if I am watching Netflix sound is routed to my surround.  Without that sound would come through tv because surround had no audio input.

This may be partially due to the fact that we were able to tinker with the picture settings, unlike the store display model which was on the factory default settings.We watched some South Park (not like that's a good way to judge picture quality, but whatever) and some Always Sunny in Philadelphia.  I was unsure about our purchase, however, until we turned off the lights and watched a handful of episodes of Game of Thrones with my sister.  The increased contrast you get with an LED tv was immediately apparent - the white wall shining clearly behind the men of the Night's Watch, clad in black.  The picture was absolutely stunning through the 4 episodes we watched.The SmartTV functionality works exactly as I'd expected, and it's very convenient not to have to power up the Wii every time we want to watch something on Netflix.  I read some reviews which stated that the remote and its keyboard on the back side felt cheaply made, though this was not my experience.  The remote wasn't anything special, but I don't feel like it will break if I drop it or handle it roughly.The only con to this TV is that the sound quality of the built-in speaker is pretty poor.  However, if you're spending ~$1000 on a 60\" tv, you likely have already invested in an external sound solution.  If not, you'll want to spend a couple hundred bucks on a decent stereo sound system.Another thing to note is that I'm writing this review the day after we purchased it, and as this line of TVs from Vizio only came out last October, it's hard for anyone to really comment on their longevity.  For this reason, my wife and I opted for our retailer's 4-year extended warranty plan, but I will update this review in 3 months and again in 6 months or as soon as I encounter any issues with the product.In the end, I couldn't be happier with my purchase and wanted to add my voice to the others who say that this TV is the best 60\" LED tv for the price.", "Date": "January 13, 2013"}, {"Title": "Great Value", "Author": "johnny`s kindle", "ReviewID": "ROJ7WYV4R0WVZ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Picture is clear and love the price and that added plus is the smart tv.

The picture quality was decent (not spectacular), the WiFi wouldn't stay connected to my network, and the application menu seemed dated and slow. I ended up returning it, disappointed.Fast forward a few weeks to Black Friday... when this TV became available for $688 at WalMart, Amazon, and other big box stores. For that kind of deal, I thought it was much more appropriately priced - so I purchased it again, at $688. Out of the box, the TV had 2 lines through the screen, again disappointed - I called Vizio and their customer service was actually great. They promptly sent me a replacement unit (brand new, not refurb) within a week.The new replacement they sent has been great, the WiFi connects perfectly and no screen issues. Overall, for the price ($688)... I really can't complain. Don't expect top of the line Samsung picture (D8000, ES8000), but more in the 6000-7000 Samsung model range. I've owned many LED TVs over the years, and I can say that for this is one of the best purchases you can make if you can find the lower price. So why the 3 stars? Be prepared for potential issues; lines through your LCD panel, WiFi not connecting, it seems Vizio may have rushed these out of their factory in time for Christmas without properly completing quality checks.Is it the best TV Vizio has made?

I had some reservations but for the price this thing cannot currently be beat.The Good:- Obviously 60\" is a huge selling point at this price.- Picture quality is as good as I had hoped.  With quality source material this thing looks really sharp.- I was worried about the sound quality (since I currently don't have my home theater setup set up) but it's actually about as good as you can expect from an LCD TV this thin.- This thing really is thin and the bezel is slim as well.  It's also pretty light for the size.- The packaging was well-done and the stand was easy to install.- Wifi works well and I have streamed a ton of content so far with zero buffering issues.The Bad:- It really does take a while for this thing to boot up.  Not a huge deal but it can be slightly annoying.- The apps are totally functional but not exactly state-of-the art in terms of their UI and they can be slightly sluggish.- No 3D support (which isn't a huge factor for me but might deter some).Apps:- Amazon app is great but only 720p.  There is also a frustrating thing where, when navigating, the app remains in the side-bar and it would be nice if you could navigate titles full-screen (like the Vudu app allows you to do).- Hulu works really well and the shows look great (though again they are only 720p).  The interface is nice as well and it's easy to load up your queue on your computer then burn through it on your TV.- Vudu is awesome.  The interface is actually pretty polished and you can browse titles full-screen which is nice.  Vudu HDX mode is 1080p and is noticeably better than Amazon's HD content (I bought the same show and compared them back to back).  The only downside is: HDX generally costs more.  I have a lot of content already in my Amazon library so I am pretty invested in the Amazon ecosystem and will not be making the switch.  However, for rentals, HDX is awesome.  A final note on Vudu: it is owned by Wal-Mart which might be a consideration for some.- YouTube looks pretty shockingly good on the YouTube app.  The YouTube app's interface is also pretty usable and it's generally speaking pretty easy to find the content you're looking for.- The other apps I found to be mostly useless.  I don't need to browse FaceBook, listen to internet radio, or check the weather on my TV (since I have other devices that are better-suited for these tasks).  I know everybody has different needs so these features could be important to you.Basically, if you are on a budget and want a huge screen that looks great with built-in wifi and apps this thing is pretty tough to beat.  If you care about 3D but want to stay within this budget you might want to sacrifice screen size and go with a smaller 3D TV.", "Date": "December 29, 2012"}, {"Title": "best television i've ever seen", "Author": "Patricia Grindberg", "ReviewID": "R3S22HEYVYIFGF", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "i love all the features. of this tv.. including the internet feature.. it's everything i was expecting and more.  couldn't ask for a better television.", "Date": "December 26, 2012"}, {"Title": "Great TV", "Author": "B.

Asked the csr how he would like having no tv for about 2 weeks.  Csr didn't even say sorry.  Explained to csr that tv got great reviews until they started failling and that it might take months againt to figure out if my particular serial number is also bad.  Csr didn't even reply.  Informed csr that I will write this review and also on cnet.  Csr didn't say anything.I work in a call center, inbound csr.

Called again two days later - was told may hear from carrier after Christmas.  Wanted to order another TV but cannot do so until I receive credit from this purchase.

Do not purchase from Sam's any item you cannot return yourself.

The carrier that Sam's Club used never contacted me for a pickup. Finally I rented a truck and returned it myself.  Have been trying to have this thing picked up since 12/17/2012.

It has very little processing power for the host of apps it intendeds to make use of.  Long delays after button presses to access features, steaming apps will fail to to buffer and stutter or stop, and the TV will crash.The first one I purchased died in the first sixty days. I called the \"award winning\" customer service of Vizio and was told I could get a \"recertified\" model delivered to my house a week after I completed the information process.  So basically ten days for them to send me a TV that didn't sell somewhere else(they swear it isn't refurbished) all because the TV I bought blew up.  I instead opted to take the TV back to Sams Club and get a new one there.The new set has all the same issues of the old one, just has yet to die.  I called Vizio again asking about how to stop the steaming apps from crashing and stuttering and they put me through the old \"Powercycle it!  No no, Clear the settings!  Set it factory!  Now powercycle it again!\" bullcrap.  I tried to explain to the high school graduate technician I was dealing with that software and hardware related issues that were obviously causing this performance problem were not going to be solved by simply rebooting it.In the end, the technician told me \"There are no other solutions I can offer you at this time.\"Basically, \"We know it's broken, it doesn't work, sorry, we'll document your issue and maybe fix it later.  For now, too bad, so sad, Vizio.\"The technician swore the issue was absolutely unheard of by Vizio, despite the numerous posts on their own forums and all over the internet.In short, getting a solid TV with internet apps for around a 1000 dollars is unlikely.  Vizio tried to make that a reality but in doing so shorted various aspects of the process, resulting in this sub-par product.If all you do is watch Nascar and Football and want something huge to drink beer in front of, this may be the TV for you.If you want the full usage of the apps suite that a new age, connected individual would make use of, look somewhere else.TL;DRTV has bad hardware specs and is really slow, if you're just watching cable its fine, don't expect great streaming or functionality out of it.", "Date": "February 3, 2013"}, {"Title": "BEST 60 inch for under $1000!!!!!", "Author": "C.

I along with others got very lucky at this price I admit, but the TV is absolutely worth the 1K that you are being charged here at AmazonThe picture is fantastic....it sets up very easily and the keyboard on the back of the remote is a major plus for entering information. With the thin Bezel it gives a nice clean look and using a low profile mount it looks fantastic on the wall.Now it is easy to expound on all the virtues of the tv which there are many but I will give you SMALL issues I did have with it because that is really what you are looking for right?1) the Standard picture setting you get out of the Box have to be tweaked as they are way too \"colorful\"....use the settings giving in here from Kris above as they are an excellent starting point and then tweak a little here and there to your liking. The problem I had is that you had to redo them for all the different inputs.....it isnt a one time fix. Once you have done them for the inputs though they stay2) the hook ups and power connector are set a little far in IMO and make it difficult (slightly) to hook things in when you are mounting on a wall. If you are going for a clean install you want to hide the cluster of wires behind the tv so they will already be sitting there and you have hook them up last. A minor issue3) my Biggest issue with the whole thing really is the remote.......it is a great remote to be sure as I mentioned above but I think it was short sighted of Vizio to not make this a Universal remote. I was going to buy a Vizio Bluray player also but found out that even though both of the remotes are basically identical one will not control both pieces of equipment. Something for them to think about......It would make the experience better if they made the TV remote a Universal and also promote brand loyalty4) the access to Netflix and Amazon prime is excellent and the experience with Netflix is what you have come to expect but if you really look into it, the content in Prime streaming is actually surpassing Netflix now. Example (for us 40-50 year olds) you can now stream Friends and the West Wing on Prime and you can not do that on Netflix.....so the issue is that the interface with Netflix is excellent for saving what you are watching and your instant Que......Prime really needs to make the interface better. you have to jumps through a few too many hoops to get back to where you were.

The TV started out great, but there were two major issues:1) (Fixed) There was significant ghosting when watching sports, particularly when the ball (golf, basketball) was moving quickly across the screen.  Support was able to fix this by adjusting the \"Smooth Motion\" setting to off.2) One day, when we were watching the TV, it just went black.  The sound was still on, but no picture.  After unplugging it, resetting it, rebooting the cable box - everything, no luck.  We had to call support again and after reading them the serial number, they didn't even attempt to troubleshoot the issue.  They knew that this particular serial number had a bad component from one of their suppliers that they were already aware of.  However, no recall and contact was made to the customers.They are shipping me a new TV in 2 weeks as this is still covered under the 1 year limited warranty.  However, the 1 year is not being extended from the ship date of the new TV, it is still dated back to the original purchase date of the first TV, even though it is completely different unit.

I understand that all electronic devices have a failure rate, but 3 months for a TV is too short a time in my opinion.

I have not tweeked the video settings as it came to me.  I found no need to seek improvement.  I have the choice of running the sound thru a BOSE home entertainment system, but actually prefer the TV's voice sound.  I especially like the remote.

With current TV formats being delivered in different sizes, it is nice to be able to select the picture expansion choices, there are 4 choices, quickly and easily.  One of the main factors in my selecting VIZIO over other brands, is that their customer technical support is in UTAH, USA.  Without prejudice, I felt that if the time should come that I might need to talk to them, I would be able to understand them.  Well the time came, and it was a great experience.  I had forgotten how good customer service could be.  The video went out today.  I spoke to Liz at their support center.  In a 10 minute call, max, she had me unplug the TV, hold the ON button in for 30 seconds, plug it back in, turn it ON and see that the screen was still a deep blue.  From that she determined that they would send me a new TV, via freight, set the new TV up, repack the old defective one and take it away at no charge.  I do not know how I could ask for more.

We were going to go with the 55 inch but the 60 inch came on sale now before the super bowl.  Got the TV home and it shut itself off within 2 minutes.  In the spam of a 30 minute TV program it would shut itself off 3 times.  While watching the playoff games it shut down 15 times.  After two calls to customer service (which were pleasent)  they could not solve the problem and we took the TV back.  The second one has been fine so far. No problems and the kids and adults love it.What to like:1) Picture quality is quite good.As other reviews state you do have to play with the settings to get a good picture that is specific for your room.  I read several review stating to use the \"vivid\" mode.  This ended up being way too bright and made the colors run.  We are happy with the standard setting.  Honestly unless you have two TV's side by side it is hard to say that this is better or worse than brand name Samsung or Sony.  Watching sports or HD programming is very clear.  Just make sure to turn off the \"soap opera effect\".2)  Remote.Having the qwerty keyboard makes typing everything in for internet use and for setup very easy and quick.  Since we have young kids and watch most tv at night having the keys backlit would have been nice but not a deal breaker.3)  PriceHow can you go wrong for the price for a 60 inch smart TvNot so good:1) Time to turn onIt take about 15 seconds for the tv to turn on.  Not a huge problem just something some people may not like.2) Stand.We bought the tv with plans to mount it so it doesn't affect us but for those who are going to just use the stand make other plans to stabilize it.  This is a big Tv and it is very wobbly on the stand and could be easily knocked over by kids or pets  .Summary:  All in all the TV works great.  The picture is good and functions are easy to navigate.

The power light will come on and after 10 seconds it dims but no picture or light comes onto the screen.  After reading other reviews about a faulty video chip we were left with two options.  Either wait around for Vizio to send out a repairman or just return it back to Sams.  We opted for the return route.  I am changing the stars that I gave it initially because this will now be our 3rd Vizio 60 inch and we a not sure the quality of the TV is going to going to make it a good deal from a price stand point.

Required NO modifications to the picture, it was perfectly calibrated right out of the box. The TV speakers aren't great, but when are they? That's what I have external audio for. This was actually an open box, so I got it for $1,169. Almost twice what I initially paid for the Vizio(but $700 off suggested retail for the Sony and around $300 less than regular price), but after the problems I had with the Vizio and the stellar performance of this set, it is well worth it. Just thought this information might be helpful to someone.

This was a replacement for a Samsung that died at age 3 so now too surprised there is a problem with this one, seems to go along with big screen's. This time I purchased a SquareTrade 4 year warranty just to ward off evil spirits. Vizio says they want to hear about problems like this in the first 60 days, and ST says if Vizio doesn't resolve issues then they will get involved so I feel I have good warranty coverage down the road considering the TV cost. Otherwise, I would give it a 5 for the value & great customer support.UPDATE: 1-17-13- Manna Distribution delivered a brand new set in exchange for this defective set on 1/16/13, so only 16 days since first reported to Vizio, can't beat that, and I still have my Square Trade warranty to fall back on.

Bought a Visio sound bar for 99 on sale, this is an excellent TV and at power with Samsung, Sony or Sharp. It is not fair of those who are comparing this TV to Samsung 8000/7000 series costing above $2500.

My Samsung is professionally calibrated by Geek Squad. Even than this Visio is excellent. One thing the stand is weak specially if you have children in the house.

Had to haul back the TV home. Today I downgraded by rating to 2 stars/5.Keep tuned!==================================================================================================Got the Vizio from Costco this weekend of Dec 2012. Brought home, and replaced my 52\" 4 year old Samsung TV. Didn't buy another Samsung because of the service and LCD panel problems, but that's an entire different story. For the short term, no more Samsung TV please.The Vizio picture quality is stunning, both in terms of contrast clarity and vibrance. Watched ESPN football on this, and wow - amazing colors. Used its scanner feature to scan off air channels from HDTV antenna.Then tested the apps, Netflix worked beautifully, amazingly sharp pictures. The kids love watching Netflix on this TV. My son as I am sure will play PS3 COD ... and will love it.The audio is pretty good too, considering it comes from this 1\" thick TV... not much room to squeeze in decent speakers. Hooked up optical audio to my audio booster, and wow- got home theater 6 channels :-)What I liked about the TV:1. Picture quality with sharpness, clarity and vibrance.2. The best 60\" you can get under $10003. Smart features including Netflix, Youtube, etc4. USB ports that allow me to watch photos, videos, and listen to music off my USB thumb drive.5. Wifi and internet hook up.6. Low power, only estimated $17 per year electricity usage.What I hope Vizio will improve:1. The base/stand should swivel some angle so we don't need to move the base with the TV. The screws are kinda flimsy and weak.2. The mechanical design overall could be better, smoother, and more sexy. The outside plastic looks plain.3.

I bought mine at Target November 28th 2012. $1149.12 with tax and 3 yr in-store warranty. First one i got was damaged so i took it back and returned it the very same day i opened it up. Easy as pie return. this thing is huge. It will fit on a smaller stand as long as you think it will hold the weight. over time your stand may sag so in my case i reinforced my press wood  china thing i already had. if you get this tv and it's in the open or you have kids you would be better off getting a 60 inch stan so people will be forced to walk around the stand thus keeping someone from hitting the edge and possibly knocking it off.i noticed some people say the apps are slow to load. in a way i guess they are. BUT, are they comparing it to their phone? i personally do not have a cell phone at all so maybe,maybe not. the apps are not quick and scroll at the bottom of the screen and load times for those i would say are 30-40 seconds. when you decide the one you want to use there is a load time to consider. in this case i would say another 20-25 seconds. it does \"seem\" like a lot of time but for me i'm ok with it.my living room is 19 feet by 13 feet wide. the sound out of this thing as great for me and it's not even half-way up. i got a blu-ray surround sound home theater system on the way and now i wonder if i really needed it. also this tv has the hdmi (arc) feature on it. an audio return component i think it's called and if you want to use that feature MAKE SURE YOUR HOME THEATER SYSTEM HAS THAT FEATURE ALSO.packaging is easy to remove and all there is is a stand and 3 screws to put in....your done. mine is hard wired to my router for internet so i don't have problems that other people have in their reviews. remember that if your SHAREING this tv with other laptops/printers/computers/tablets in your home load times for your apps and down loading movies will suffer if more then one is use at the time. also if you are wi-fi house hold there are transmitting and recieving issues along with what was stated above. the world we live in has many thing communicating all around us. i bought a 50 foot cat6 cable and it runs under the floor in my basement.i have no cable or sattelite at the time so all i have is an antenna on my house with a pre-amp ($100). the tv will scan for channels and i got 25 plus one really bad analog signal...i didn't think it was used anymore. the menu was for me very easy to navigate and understand. the remote is a normal remote on one side and if you flip it over there is a key board style lay out of buttons on that side. sweet !The picture is very crisp with 4 sizes to choose from so if your channel is say 720 instead od 1080p you can just hit a button and widen it or zoom to get the pic the way you want it. there are about 10 different preset picture settings: vivid/football/baseball/basketball/movie/.....etc, etc or you can make your own up (custom). if i remember correctly there are 3 differenet sound settings to choos from.last night i tried out the Amazon app because i all ready  had a movie in my list i watched on my computer months ago. you need to have your computer on when you first try this app because your tv gives you a code to register your tv at amazon.com. i went to amazon via the computer and registered my tv in about 10 seconds..easy,easy,easy. sat there and watched my movie last night. took maybe 30-40 seconds to load and buffer in. great picture and sound.my sony blu-ray home theater system i ordered also has the internet hook up feature and apps so i i want to i could also use it to stream movies right to my tv. for me i am getting the NETFLIX subscription in the near future.one other note: while changeing channels for me with an antenna there is a slight delay. say 1-2 seconds. maybe because i don't have sattelite/cable hook-up.NEW NOTE ADDED NOVEMBER 30TH 2012: JUST DELEATED SOME OF MY PREINSTALLED APPS AND FOUND MANY MANY MORE AT THE YAHOO STORE ONLINE.

DON'T KNOW FOR SURE BUT IT HASN'T HAPPENED FOR AWHILE NOW.Update: March 25 2013 Tv Picture just went out. Had the Tv for 4 months now. Had to contact VIZIO Company Proper to get it fixed.

After getting off the phone from Vizio i have a repair number and 2 emails to confirm they have my Claim. The actual repair company will contact me in 3 buisness days inorder to set up an appointment to come to my house and repair it......Friday is a holiday darn it....pooey. I will update this post after repair.4-2-2013 took 1 1/2 hrs. repairman showed up with a \"kit\" containing all 3 boards for my tv. after replacing the 2nd board it fired up. the main video board was the problem. the power supply board was NOT replaced. Tv works fine now.

When we turned on the TV it was easy to connect to WiFi. There weren't any problems with setting it up. We ran out to get a HDMI cable so we could get the HD channels through our cable provider.

My bedroom tv stopped working about 3 months before hand so I had a choice to make. my wife and I discussed it and came to the conclusion that replacing the old plasma would be the best bet. Now I didn't buy this TV off amazon.  I purchased it from walmart since it was on sale. I initially wanted a 65\" Samsung but they had just changed out their tvs.This tv was less expensive and had the options I was looking for. 4 HDMI and a nice picture. Over all the price was right.I was excited to get this tv home and get it set up. I had sone other things to do that day so I hooked it up turned it on and set it up. I walked out the door not to get home until around 9 at nite.Boy was I surprise when I turned it back on to a bad popping sound. I couldn't turn up the volume or change input.  I turned it off again and POP. Turned it back on and POP. I could turn the volume up or access settings for around 15 seconds.  At which everything because useless.Now most people would have loaded it up and ran back to the store but the tv was to large for my car so I had to wait almost a week to return it. The picture quality was excellent but, and the tv speaker's sounded good. But I muted it and used my stereo instead.I then looked this model up and it had been recalled back in April of 2013. I found several people complain about the same thing. Vizio sent techs out and fixed the ones that people didn't want to exchange.Today, after the snow storms in the south shut us down for almost a week, I was able to return it. I was going to exchange it for the same model when my buddy asked if I was sure I wanted to get the same thing after all I have read.In the end I decided to get a Samsung for few more hundred and am very happy. It might not be a smart TV but I didn't need one in the first place since I have an xbox one and ps3.Would I recommend this tv? Honestly I have owned 3 other vizio and this is my first issue. Based on other reviews this tv has issues.  The interface is outdated but if you are looking for a tv and on a budget and willing to risk it. This is a good tv for the price.", "Date": "February 14, 2014"}, {"Title": "A great value for the money.", "Author": "James M. Hare", "ReviewID": "R2IVLZLUCMJBNY", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Pros - very good color, IMO, easy to set up, many 'tweaks' for display colors, great value for the money, lots of inputs.Cons - tinny sound, (just like every other flat screen).I bought this set to replace a 12-year old Panny projection tv that lost it's mind. I did a lot of research, and, trusting the Amazon reviews that seemed intelligently-written, pulled the trigger on this nice big Vizio.  My local Walmart online said they had it in stock, but when I got there and asked the kid about it, he claimed not to have any in back. He seemed more interested in selling a teenage girl a new iPhone, so I got back in my car and drove 20 miles to another state to a BJs Club to get it instead.  Same price, no sales tax.Got it home, out of the box, plugged it in, and set it up according to most of the reviews and instructions I'd seen - turn off the \"In-Store\" mode.  I have Verizon Fios and it usually delivers a decent picture and sound. I'm not an anal-retentive video/audiophile who whines about how much black separation there is in the shadows behind someone's chair in \"Matrix Reloaded\" or something, I just want blue sky, green grass and yellow...I don't know, corn, I guess.This set has FOUR HDMI inputs, which are currently the best way to deliver video and audio. There are also the YGB component (next best) and standard RCA inputs as well, and a bunch of others that you might need, depending on what you hook up. Something for everyone here, no worries.The Viz delivers a picture that is at least the equal of many sets costing $1500, half again as much as you'll pay for the Vizio.  Is it as good as a $5000 Sony? Not sure. But for me, the picture quality is much improved over the Panny, and, according to most reviews, stellar for a sub-$1000 set.There are a bunch of presets for various types of display, such as MOVIE, GAME, and various sports - FOOTBALL, GOLF, etc etc.  Since this is so personal, I'm not gonna tell you which is best for you, or even which one I use. Suffice to say that there are a lot of possible adjustments to various color, brightness, and contrast settings, and you'll just have to tweak it to your own satisfaction. This is no different from what you would do with ANY set, so it's not something worth getting worked up about.  Some  people just set it to MOVIE mode and forget it.The remote is simple to use, although I trained my Fios remote to mimic it for channel and volume settings, so I only need one remote. You only need the Vizio remote to make adjustments to the colors, and to use the 'smart' functions - Netflix, and such.The wireless internet connectivity was pretty simple to use, it announced itself and my router found it and all was right with the world.  We occasionally watch YouTube junk on it but other than that I'm not a big user of these features. They all work, and they're simple enough to use if you want them.Here are the 'downsides', if you can call them that. They're really the only negatives I can come up with after nearly six months with the set.1. The sound is pretty bad. ALL flat TVs suffer from this, you just can't put good speakers in a case only an inch thick. So I knew this going in, and have purchased the 42\" Visio4251w-B4  5.1 sound bar recently, which is a MUST-HAVE addition.2. I have a Blue-ray player HDMI'ed into one of the FOUR HDMI inputs, and when you put a DVD in, the TV automatically switches to that input, but it can not automatically switch back to the cable box's HDMI input when you're done with the DVD player.  So you need to grab the Vizio remote and switch inputs.  Not a deal killer by any means, but a minor annoyance.Other than those two minor little things, this set is a great value for a 60\" HDTV. The 'black screen of death' problems that were mentioned by several reviews back in the mid-2012 to mid-2013 time frame have been FIXED by Vizio, and from all reports, all sets built since about mid June 2013 are fine.  So don't worry about it.One word of warning - there are lots of blandishments to get an extended warranty for the set from SquareTrade, and others.  I originally did, after asking the SquareTrade CSR whether their warranty kicked in after the Vizio 1-year warranty, and being told it did. Then when I got the paperwork, it was clear I'd been misled - the Square Trade warranty OVERLAPPED the Visio for the first year, so you pay for three years but only get two. I cancelled mine, and they did return my premium.  The manufacturer warranty is one year, 100% parts and labor for anything, so you can't go wrong there.  Make sure if you get an 'extended' warranty, from any source, that it kicks in AFTER the manufacturer warranty ends. There is no reason to get double coverage.", "Date": "February 11, 2014"}, {"Title": "I love this television ... and I have it on my wall.", "Author": "John Chamberlain", "ReviewID": "R1PIF52A2BYAZR", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Had a problem after three months.

It turned out that the Bluray player connected to Onkyo was coming through to the TV, and blocking the proper handshake.

Its easily worth either that or the pre-sale price.  I went to a competitor brick and mortar and looked at the $2K TVs.  Honestly, I can't tell the difference.  LED really helps the blacks be a little blacker, and the power consumption is a whole lot lower.  It has 4...not 2...HDMI connectors, and you can connect your Wii to this TV.  This 60\" is plenty large, and much bigger than my old 42\".But what do I know, I'm probably just an average TV watcher, and I don't review anything for a living.

Set up was very simple, but it only has one old time coaxial cable input for the old timers out there that still have a number of products that need these connections. The smart apps work fine and are a real treat; however, I have found that the Netflix app freezes on a consistent basis. I purchased this TV back in April of 2013 and did not see any mention of this problem then. After coming back to Amazon for some other items, I have noticed a number of posts about this problem but nothing about fixes. Usually, the program will freeze around 9:30 at night. It happens at other times; however, 9:30 seems to be the most consistent. I usually have to unplug the power cord from the back of the TV and usually get a loud bang from the speakers when I do. I plug the power cord back in after a couple of seconds and then it usually boots up fine and I can go back to normal viewing the rest of the night. This does not seem to happen when I use another device like the Wii to access the web, but it always happens when I go through the smart apps on the VIZIO. I have not called VIZIO tech support yet to see if they can help, but that is my next step. Does anyone have any other suggestions?

If you have a separate sound system, you're good to go, if not, your going to want to get one.  I connect a compact sound bar and it's fine.  Another flaw is that the rear inputs are difficult to access when it is wall-mounted.  I imagine this is a common problem with wall mounts.  The inputs should be moved to the bottom of the set, so you don't have to pull the screen away from the wall and fumble around semi-blindly behind it.

Picture is bright and clear and color is good.  It's in a pretty bright room, one wall is all windows and there is not glare on the set, even when the sun is on that side.  Viewing angle is quite good, the picture can be seen from a pretty pronounced side view although of course the picture is not perfect from a steep angle....still quite watchable.LOVE the size!I actually do like the qwerty remote a lot, it's easy to use, responsive, and backlit....although we usually use the directv remote when just watching tv.  The set does require a few adjustments to settings for the best picture but that's really an individual thing and most sets will require some little tweak here or there to suit individual preferences.We had an issue where an hd movie from amazon prime was not showing the whole shot....it seemed cut off on top and bottom, despite numerous tries to adjust settings.  I called vizio and the tech guy talked me through a few things and then said that the serial number on our set fell within the range where a bad \"board\" was used and offered a replacement tv for us.  Sets made with this defective \"board\" were known to lose picture completely so of course, I agreed and was grateful that he offered it.Have had the replacement set for about a week now and we still love it........haven't gone back to check a movie out on it yet, but at least now I know I have a set without the defective board in it.", "Date": "May 3, 2013"}, {"Title": "Excellant Picture", "Author": "steven strand", "ReviewID": "R18WIHWHD7EM1C", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Other then the missing user manual, I am very pleased with the quality of the picture and sound quality !

I feel like I am definitely getting my use out of it.Cons, these are all minor, but worth listing and keep this from getting 5 stars:-Small number of useful apps. I've only used the netflix app and youtube app. I bet vizio changes to a new App provider (right now its called VIA through Yahoo) because there are simply so few and I don't think anyone is really developing new apps...haven't seen a new one yet. IF/when this occurs this app system will be obsolete...-The youtube app is so basic I just use my computer instead. You can only search for videos, view your subscription feed and I think there is a popular/trending category that I've never used. The worst part is the search results can't be filtered. You search, get maybe 15-20 results and that's it. If the video isn't in the first 20 or so results then you can't get to it without research with a more specific title. You also can't change resolutions. It automatically uses 1080p which is annoying if you're running low on bandwidth. It won't let you just pause and buffer forever either. So if you can't stream 1080p then you can't really use the app. All that being said my friend watches youtube videos on it all the time...I can't stand it though.-no internet browser-Can't use separate audio input if the video is coming from HDMI. I have a DVI to HDMI cable that I wanted to use to connect between my computer and the TV. DVI doesn't have audio capabilities so for sending audio to the TV I wanted to just hook a 3.5mm audio cable from my speaker output on the computer into the TV. This can't be done even though the TV has a 3.5mm audio in. It assumes the audio will come from HDMI if you are using HDMI. It will only play audio from the 3.5mm audio jack if the video source selected is VGA.Other:-I have to set overscan on my PC to be able to use the whole screen. I think this is my specific computer though. Just be aware if your input has black borders around google how to set up overscan.-VIA apps are written in javascript/XML so if you are handy in these languages you have the potential to write an app, although you can't send it directly to your TV. I think Vizio would have to approve it/put it on the app store...-Sound is just average and there is not a lot of bass.

Realize though your YouTube app is limited in its search capabilities. Instead of hundreds of videos showing up on something common, you get a choice of 10 videos or less to pick from, and no way to filter the results. Another bad thing about the TV is the coaxial cable connecter. Mine is loose. It is extremely touchy. I'm just hoping it doesn't fall off, as what happened to another Sanyo TV (very old) that I own. I also use the TV for a laptop screen. Using HDMI is very touchy as well, the screen goes in and out (but that is due to a very cheaply made 15 foot HDMI cord). I also purchased a VGA cable for it. Using that, works great except the top left of the screen will flicker and wiggle some to the point where that's all you notice. Bad cables I say, not the TV. I love VIZIO so much that I just recenty purchased a VIZIO for my mother. She received it yesterday and is already in awe. I think these TVs are shipped out too fast and a lot of small things are overlooked, (like my coaxial cable connection), but other than that, the TV is a great buy.

Not enough inputs, screen was too glossy, you name it, I was finding problems with all the TVs I was looking at. They had the 60\" Vizio hidden to the side. I walked over and my mouth dropped. The picture was amazing! The size, perfect! The inputs, what I was looking for. I decided to go with it knowing it was a well known name.I have had it for awhile now and LOVE this TV! It did not weigh much at all and was very easy to set up. I did not need the Smart part of the TV, I own a Roku and also a Blu-Ray player that has all the applications built in. However, it is a lot easier to use the application directly from the TV. It has a built in wifi with an N band, connecting it to my network was less than a minute! I loved that this TV has 4 HDMI inputs. I also like that it has two audio outputs. The other TV that I returned for this one only had one. I don't know a person who buys a big TV without hooking it up to a surround system. I had an older system and with the two outputs am able to use my older sound system and am very pleased!The thing I like the most, it is big but yet compact! It is hard to describe. It really is a wonderful huge screen but yet looks compact and perfect on a TV stand. I was sold on the matte screen as opposed to a glossy one. It picture is very crisp and clear!My daughter is so happy I bought it and I am glad my other TV broke or I never would have exchanged it for this one. Vizio is a well known name, my father owns a Vizio and I have always admired his TV. This one is just incredible! I would recommend seeing it in person first and you will see what I mean. I don't think you can go wrong with this one.", "Date": "March 25, 2013"}, {"Title": "Noticeable light leak issues, unfortunate deal-breaker for otherwise impressive TV", "Author": "Mark", "ReviewID": "R2036U9UZ9XC4U", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "I never write Amazon reviews, but after anxiously reading about and watching the price of this TV since last fall, I finally pulled the trigger and picked one up.

I'm guessing some people may not notice or care about this, but knowing I'll have the TV for at least 5 years and notice it every time, I returned it and picked up a Samsung UH60EH6000 for $100 more. It's a thicker design (as it's not edge lit) and the blacks aren't quite as dark, but it's full-array backlighting means there was no \"light leak\" and minimal \"clouding\".I'm guessing the Vizios are all slightly different, so you may have better luck, but it really sucks having to bring a 60\" TV back to the store unless you have a friend with a large vehicle.", "Date": "March 25, 2013"}, {"Title": "Great TV for the Money", "Author": "Robert Buchalski \"umpprez\"", "ReviewID": "R2QJ16PSQHLAW5", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Purchased this item in February and discovered that there were problems with one of the parts from a particular supplier to Vizio.

The picture was great. Connected the TV to the VHT215 soundbar via HDMI, the TV controls the sound card volume and the sound is awsome.  However, the internet connection would not work.  A new Linksys router, E2500, was purchased at the end of December 2012, but still no connection.  Linksys customer service instructed to reserve a port for the TV and set the port up as a DMZ with no download filters.  Vizio customer service told me my signal was not strong eneough, even though signal strength showed 3-4 bars, and asked me to make a wired connection with the TV 30 feet away.  I thought there must be something wrong with the wireless card in the TV and returned it for replacement.  The TV was replaced in early February.  The new TV had a similar problem as the original.  Even with 3-4 bars in signal strength the TV would connect to the router, but not download.  There were 2 more calls to Vizio customer service.  Both representatives read from the same script and said the TV was not getting adequate signal strength even though the strength indicated 3-4.  This time I decided to bypass the TV's wireless card and purchased a Linksys WET610N wireless adapter.  The WET610N connected to the wireless network at the TV.  The TV connected to the adapter with an ethernet cable.  Everything connected and operated with speed to burn.  It took over 2 months, several calls/chats to customer service, and $120-$140 for a new wireless router and adapter; but finally my Vizio E601i-A3 works as it should have out of the box. Save yourself some time and buy a wireless adapter or a ROKU right frpm the start.  One other thing, I tried to post this review to the Vizio web site 3 weeks ago.

TV was warped about an inch or two but the picture and everything was awesome.  I am not a videophile but it took a while to get the settings where I like them.  Love photography (the a77 looks amazing on this set) so my preference is towards realism, not bright over saturated picture.  There are more than enough options for the average guy to get the picture just where they want it.  TV is in a bright room with a wall of windows 90 degrees, the glare resistance is nothing short of amazing.  One problem is color drop off at about 30 degrees.  If you have serious viewers at an angle, it may not be for you.  My wife and I sit nearly straight back in recliners at about 12 feet.Began reading about the tv on the AVS forum and found that my serial number had a problem with black screen of death.  Mine was fine but alas, the price dropped a hundred bucks.  So we called Walmart, talked to the manager and we could not get credited the money after three weeks so they suggested we bring it back and buy a new one.  This was very tempting but we looked on Amazon and it was 10 dollars cheaper plus of course free shipping and no sales tax.  With Walmart's 90 day return policy we could keep the Tv until we got Amazons.  So we did just that.  But we live in hillbilly land and the shipping company gave us the run around for three weeks and when we finally got in touch with them we found out it was serial number 47, same as we had and within the 38-48 under semi-recall.  So we call Amazon and complained and they treated us great.  Gave us a 50 buck credit and took it back.  Two weeks to get the credit so then we reordered, got the tv in two weeks, SN 50 and the tv is perfectly straight.My wife likes movies, I like news and sports.

Delivery went fine.Set worked fine until the morning of the Super Bowl when the screen went dead but for the backlight.  I called Vizio Customer Service and had a CSR live on the line from Utah within 3 minutes. He had me try some resets for 2 minutes (I'd actually done them on my own before the call).  He said he thought it was the T Com board and said they would ship the part to the service company the next morning and I should hear from them by Friday.  On Wednesday (2 days early) the service co. called to set up a home repair the next day.  I was busy, so we set it up for the following day.Two repair people came and swapped out all three circuit boards that comprise the set -- apparently Vizio ships all the boards at once.  Turns out the CSR was right - it was the T Com board. The entire service call took about an hour.The set has worked fine since then.SO while I'm not thrilled that the set died -- my 6 year old Sharp, Dell and Polaroid HDTVs never had a problem -- I was pleased that Vizio's service was as fast, efficient and polite as it was.

I don't usually write reviews, but thought those new to very big TVs might run into my situation (old engineer, techie kids older and gone, up to me for setup).  This is an excellent TV.  Truly great picture and all my wife and I will want.  Setup is very quick and easy.  Just turn it on, click as you go, and the TV does the rest.  Ran an HDMI cable from the HD cable box to the TV and all was ready in minutes, did the setup, and all was set.  HD channels are a dream.  Like you are literally in the room with the characters.  Haven't been this amazed since my parents first got a color TV back in the 60s.We ran into a couple of issues that were not due to the TV and wanted to provide others with what we did.  Some of the channels we like to watch on cable do not have an HD equivalent.  Accessing the non-HD led to issues with the TV.  It would \"stutter\" a bit, flicking back and forth from good picture, black screen, audio cutting out, etc.  This was the biggest impulse buy we'd ever made, so I began to slump into my easy chair as Susan gave me \"the look.\"Troubleshooting guide from web site indicated it was possibly trying to \"pull\" the picture up to 1080.  And the cable box was indicating non-HD at 480, way lower than 1080.  Comments on these reviews were excellent, and quickly found the S/N was not one with the bad chips, but caused me to remember to cut the info tag off the packaging that has p/n, s/n, etc.  Had forgotten to do that.Trying to isolate the issue (HDMI cable, cable box, TV), I got a filtered surge protector and better HDMI cable.  Still no joy on the issue.  Waited until all the appliances were off (frig, heater, etc) just to make sure no bad electrical signals.  Still no joy.Hooked up an old VCR/DVD unit to the \"R/L/V\" input on the TV, used the TV menu to change the input signal, played a DVD, and no issues at all.  So a big relief it wasn't a TV issue.Thinking (not so) fast, ran the R/L/V RCA cable from the TV to the cable box.  And, all of a sudden, non-HD channels are working with no issues.  Not as good as HD, but it's working.  And would support HD, but picture is much smaller (bought a 60\" to look at 42,\" I think not).  Using the TV menu to move input back to HDMI, changed the cable box to a HD channel - and the TV is back to fantastic viewing.Sending this just to try to help others who (like me) tend to just call the tech support numbers when the kids aren't at the house.  Probably not the most elegant, but big relief to see the fantasic TV does not have an issue.  And will get a blu-ray player this week.This is a truly fantastic TV.  Must admit did not purchase thru Amazon (impulse buy at big box store), but know many others who have purchased large items such as this thru Amazon and never had an issue.", "Date": "February 26, 2013"}, {"Title": "AMAZING!", "Author": "R.

Then it would work again.  But now, the picture was degraded to the point that it made it difficult to watch.  So I called Vizio earlier today and was informed that my TV happened to have a known defect.  I was given two options: keep it and extend the warranty for another year and they would try to resolve the problem through tech support.  Or they would send me a new TV at no cost.  They would come in and set up the new TV, collect the old one, and be on their way.  I chose the second option.  Plus, they indicated they would work with Square Trade warranty to let them know that the exchange wouldn't affect the 4 year extended warranty I purchased.  So, I'm very happy with the way Vizio handled this and will heartily recommend this TV and this company to friends and family.And not to put too fine a point on it, the only reason this doesn't get 5 stars is because of the non-backlit remote control.

That was around Dec. 17.  The vizio died on Feb.14 as I was watching.  The picture simply disappeared and gave way to a dark blue background.  However, the audio remained.  At first I thought it was the signal from the satellite, but when the tv would no longer respond to remote commands I knew there was a more serious problem.  I had experienced a problem with audio sync early on with only one channel, but that seemed to resolve itself.  Lately, the sound seemed to be fading as I had to keep turning it up to hear the dialog in shows.  After I lost the picture I went through a number of trouble shooting processes to no avail.  I lost the audio during one of the processes leaving me only with a blue screen and a tv that would only respond to on and off.  I proceeded to the online reviews and was shocked to discover that many experienced the same problems as me.  I had done all the research prior to ordering this product and had I accessed the reviews just one more time on Nov. 26, before pushing the order button, I would have found the first indications of what was to come.  I contacted the service department at vizio on the morning of the 15th and was pleasantly surprised with the reps responses.  He acknowledged the problems and assured me they would not occur with the replacement tv coming my way in the next 8 to 13 days.  On Feb. 28 the new tv arrived.  Two servicemen mounted it on the wall and took the old one.  I'm a little disappointed with Vizio because they will not begin the warranty on the new tv with the installation date.  The warranty remains one year from original date of purchase.  I remain a skeptic and will likely purchase a warranty extension.

The Internet apps work great - which was my main reason for wanting this set. I don't have cable other than a few local channels, so I usually just stream content from Netflix. With this TV I can also stream from Amazon Prime (which I love!), as well as other sources. The picture clarity is such that it almost appears 3D at times. I am using the wireless connection until I purchase a cable, and my only issue is that for some reason when the set is off it loses the connection. Each time I have to go to the menu and have it look for the connection. Once it finds it, it connects automatically, but I usually have to test the connection a couple of times before it 'takes.' The only other issue I have had is that a few times it has turned itself off. I still have to check and see if it has the function built in to turn itself off when no one is around. I sit very still with my laptop while watching - maybe I need to wave an arm from time to time. ;-) Oh, almost forgot the delivery service! AWESOME!!! One reason I was going to purchase a smaller TV is because I figured (being single) that I would have to carry it, and my back doesn't do well at more than about 40 pounds. Amazon provided free delivery, AND the guy unpacked the set, put it on my table, and we tested that it was working. I did the actual hookup of the cable, Internet, and Blu-ray player - which was not a problem, but it was so great having a delivery that wasn't simply dropped at the door!

Setup was easy although the built-in wi-fi has not connected to my network yet as it states the signal is low from the router (showing 1 bar vs my other devices showing full strength in same location).  Not a major concern since I will probably not use it often anyway.  However, the picture is great compared to the Sony Bravia it replaced.  The sound is not as strong though, but considering the size of the unit, I did not expect it.  The unit is really thin and complements the space around it.  I am still adjusting the settings to get the optimal picture quality and with looking through other reviews, I have a starting point to play with.  But all-in-all, good quality HD picture.Now, the \"Enhanced Delivery\" service...By ordering this TV through Amazon, the order qualified for the \"Enhanced Delivery\" service based on the detailed terms below:\"We offer FREE Enhanced Delivery through one of our specialty shippers when you purchase most HDTVs 48 inches or larger from Amazon.com. A representative of a common carrier will deliver your TV to any room suitable for testing, unpack it, ensure that it is working properly to guarantee no damage occurred during transportation, and dispose of all packaging material.\"Ok,Delivery..Yes, Free.Carrier..Yes, they did contact me (via Email with a contact number to call them to schedule a delivery date/timeframe)Carrier..Yes, they answered the call quickly and scheduled a time that fit my schedule.Carrier..Yes, delivered within timeframe and were friendly.Carrier..No, they did not unpackCarrier..No, they did not 'test' the unit (which i thought would be plugging in to see if it at least turns on) to ensure no damage occurred during transit (I did a visual inspection for any physical damage)Carrier..No, they did not dispose of packaging material (this may be a good thing, as I still have the box in case I need to return the unit)So, delivery was \"Standard\" considering other big box stores will \"deliver\" and ensure there is no severe outside physical damage to the packaging.Bottom line:  The TV is working and looks great-(I would recommend).

PURCHASE: Amazon was out of stock so I purchased it from Amazon merchant, TigerDirect which made it ineligible for the 2% rewards promo and Prime shipping :-(. Standard shipping cost me $49. And after some confusion AIT shipping actually delivered, albeit, a few hours after the scheduled delivery time. OLD TV: Was replacing a Vizio 37\" 720p LED. RAZOR TV: Beautiful slim design with a great picture. All I needed to do was change the default settings to the settings recommended by CNET. See the Kris review #thanksKris. My test movies were Avatar and Avengers from my PS3 slim. FULL HD 1080p, WOW! There may be better pictures out there, but not at this price, or at 60\", and NOT BY MUCH!!!  SOUND: The sound is adequate, but not home theater worthy. Small complaint as solutions to this issue exist. We have AMPs and speakers in the room, but I wanted to limit the # of components in the room and cables to the TV. We are going to mount this over the fireplace in the great room, making it even greater (sorry), but my wife's concern is the obvious. Cables everywhere!  So I also purchased the Vizio VHT215 Sound Bar. This solved 2 of my concerns. First, the sound bar, with wireless subwoofer, provides a full home theater experience so much so that while I was in the kitchen, which overlooks the GR, I had to turn around at one point because of the BOOM! And that was at a setting of 10. Second, the sound bar has 2 HDMI ports for components and 1 HDMI/ARC for the connection to the TV, which means the TV needs only 1 HDMI/ARC connection to the sound bar, instead of an HDMI cable for DTV receiver, game console, home theater, etc. etc. LESS CABLES. Maybe this is a topic for the sound bar review, but I'd thought I'd mention that this addition was a great solution to these 2 concerns. TV CAUTION: 1, HDMI interfaces are all on the left side (looking straight on) so keep that in mind for cable management. 2, WIFI is only N band without backward compatibility so it will not connect to my G router. No worries for the hardwired, but I'm not ready to purchase a N band because my last attempt caused problems with my many wireless \"Toys\", and wired is not an option in this location, says the wife. So, for now all my Amazon content streaming is via the PS3, which worked wonderfully. 3. ARC - Audio Return Channel - The TV HDMI port connecting to the VHT215 sound bar must support ARC. SUMMARY: You CAN NOT go wrong with this purchase if you like a BIG picture with FULL 1080p HD support at this price. The internet applications are nice to have, but not my main reason for this purchase so no need to upgrade to a N band wireless router just yet.", "Date": "December 7, 2012"}, {"Title": "Hope yours works", "Author": "James R Smith", "ReviewID": "R1T9JILIEDL2MH", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "\"Defective item.

Once it was placed on its stand and turned on, I was instantly blown away by the size of the screen and impressive picture. The setup was incredibly easy -- TV channels were added automatically. OTA channels were incredibly crisp and vivid. I've never seen that much detail before! Thanks to the keyboard on the remote, wifi setup and app setups were incredibly painless. I was quickly on my way to watching my Netflix/Amazon Instant Video. Streaming video worked flawlessly and given that it's a single unit, it's one less thing to dust. Since I am coming from PS3 as the primary media player, there are some things that I do miss. Firstly, I would like to turn off the screen without turning everything off and going back into the app and selecting my movie and finding my place. Secondly, this unit lacks a bluetooth remote control, which means I do need to pick up the remote and aim squarely at the TV. Overall, I am very pleased with my purchase and would recommend this TV to anyone!Update 12/31/2012:I really wanted to like this TV. The BIG clear picture wowed me and at that time, I was incredibly happy with my purchase. Then only 2 days new, I woke up to a brighter than usual TV screen. The backlight on the TV was on (with no picture) and I saw the indicator light saying the TV was on. I kept on pressing the on/off button and it didn't respond. After pressing the button 6 more times, the TV startled me by turning off with a loud \"crack\" sound coming from the speakers. I tried turning on the TV again and it also had a \"crack\" sound. The TV functioned normally for a while and over the month, it happened again 2 more times. Like I said, I really wanted to like this TV, but I am going to return this TV as having the backlight coming on randomly (and staying on until someone notices) is sure to decrease the lifespan of the TV.", "Date": "December 7, 2012"}, {"Title": "This thing is incredible!", "Author": "John M.

In reply to, and aside to, a lot of the black out issues, you should know that the reason Vizio ranks so well and have decent tv's is because the LCD, chips, motherboard etc are all made by S.Korean giant Samsung! In fact, these screens are Samsung's \"step-child,\" batches of screens. I have family members that work at Samsung. So the inside scoop is, well kind of obvious if you're familiar with the industry and production of screens, but kind of like processors, when they \"bake\" up the batches some come out great/perfect while some come out \"not so quite,\" so when they cut up the screens and test them, the ones that don't meet the original production criteria are then sold off to companies like Vizio (and many others like Sharp (Samsung owns a portion of Sharp) to use in their tv's/screens. This isn't necessarily a bad thing, but sometimes it can be a headache. I had a 50 inch Vizio bought from Costco croak on me just before Christmas. Opened her up and everything was, sure enough Samsung, except the piece that fried LOL, which was made in China haha. Go figure. This is the problem with the batches from LFTRNWAN3800001 to LFTRNWAN4805300 for Model E601i-A3 and LFTRNXAN4500001 - LFTRNXAN4702936 for Model E701i-A3. The demand was so high for Samsung that Vizio outsourced it to an \"el-cheapo\" of a company in china. It's not surprise. Wrong poker move on Vizio's part and now they and \"us\" the consumers have to deal with the bluff hand. - The only reason I buy Vizio is because at heart it is truly Samsung guts, which is pretty darn cool. Kudos to the Korean giant. I also own Samsung TV's which are flawless, but when I need one for giggles in the gaming room or whatever and to use as my screen for an extra monitor for stock quotes etc....Vizio will do all the while allowing me to save a few hundred. After all it is Samsung's step child parts clothed in a Vizio badge. Better than buying another less of a brand... Hope this helps. (btw, don't listen to Vizio customer care, they don't know crap and keep in mind they are only just people who answer phones with scripts. No knowledge at all. They don't know the inside scoop, only what they are told and to say. You're better off asking your pet.)", "Date": "January 17, 2014"}, {"Title": "Non-repairable TV's from Vizio", "Author": "mgoss", "ReviewID": "RGJ0XFJSCNB8S", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "Be sure to read this article before buying a Vizio TV.

Overall, it's quality is higher than the high end Phillips LCD TV I bought about six years ago. Even my wife loves having a 60 inch TV and she's not gadget person. So if you want to step up to a bigger TV but are nervous about the Vizio brand, don't be. Vizio is the Toyota of TV's - an upstart that makes high quality products at low prices. I'm sure that video-philes have a million reasons to buy something more expensive, but for the rest of us, this is great.I do have a few tips.1. If you have a room to dedicate to your TV, then simply move your couch as close to the TV as you can stand and save the money.2. If you have a basement, man-cave, or any other consistently dark room for your TV, then buy a plasma instead. They are slightly cheaper and have a better picture than LCD/LED TV's. (Burn-in on plasmas is no longer a problem). The downside is that you get more glare in a bright room.3. Turn off the Smooth Motion Effect (Menu -> Picture -> Advanced Picture Settings). Smooth Motion Effect makes the picture look creepy, at least for some people.4. Consider buying a sound bar to go with it. That's the cheapest way to get decent sound (and audible dialogue). You can save even more money by getting a sound bar without a subwoofer if you only care about hearing the dialogue and aren't as interested in explosions that rock the whole house.The biggest downside to this TV is that the Amazon Prime app is terrible. You can't login so you can't access your watchlist of Amazon shows. Instead you have to search.

I will try to update this review in about 6 months. As others have pointed out, the picture quality and thin design are very good. It may be a minor consideration to some but I really like the understated Vizio logo on the lower right corner. Previous models have had brightly lit Vizio logos that are distracting and annoying. The sound is average; because the speakers are rear-facing, if you mount the TV against the wall, that muffles the sound. The remote-with-keyboard is a good idea with some issues: You have to learn not to hit any of the keyboard buttons when you are holding the remote with keyboard facing down. When you are using the keyboard, the keys will not register unless the \"left\" of the keyboard is pointing at the TV. This TV has an excellent selection of connection ports including four HDMIs.  Here are some additional comments:1) Unboxing: I was annoyed that the box had no opening instructions. I'm sure most people ended up cutting the top and either flipping the box and spilling the TV out or struggling to lift the TV out. The safest way to unbox is to unclip the four plastic clips near the base of box and simply slide the box up and away from the base.2) When I first powered on and connected to the Internet, the TV automatically did a firmware update. I was surprised that it did not ask for my approval to do the update. However, everything appears to be working correctly.3) If you look at the marketing info, this smart TV is suppose to have Pandora. It does not have it preinstalled but you can install it from the online Store.4) The Netflix app has subtitle support! This is the first non-browser Netflix app that I have seen with subtitles. This is big plus for my family.5) I'm using this Vizio TV with a Logitech Harmony universal remote with no problems.In summary, it's not perfect but it is very good and IMO, the current best value for a 60-inch smart TV.", "Date": "November 27, 2012"}, {"Title": "great viewing tv, but not perfect- Eventually died", "Author": "JJ \"JJ\"", "ReviewID": "R28ACPMM226DNO", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "things i like about the tv:internet apps like netflix*GREAT PICTURE.

If you get right up on the set from the side in a well lit room the pic isn't the best (but who really watches TV like that?). Not to nit pick, the set is great from viewing at all angles when you are a few feet back, and has a very good picture. Thanks to the reviewers below that listed the custom settings because you definitely want to change it from the default soap opera mode it comes in. It is a very good budget big screen, period.****Update****Overall I am happy with this TV but when watching sporting events I notice the classic LCD blurring. Do any of you who own this set know how to tweak the settings to fix this outside of the Smooth Motion Effect setting?

Raigosa", "ReviewID": "R25EODRC5BL2QM", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I had my eye on a new LED set for the holidays. I read reviews and compared many models before deciding on this one. I owned a 42\" 720P Vizio very briefly, before an accident happened and cracked the screen. I remember being impressed by the display quality and purchasing it for a good price from a local retailer. Afterwards, I was forced to go back to 32\" LG TV for gaming and such. But as the years passed, I decided it was time to turn it up a notch.I'm a heavy gamer and I play split screen online with my friends a lot. Our household also has movie and sports night events throughout the week. Whether it is playoff time or the mid season finale of the Walking Dead; people tend to come over and congegrate. I decided a big screen was a necessity at this point. I knew the right time to purchase was around Black Friday, so I set aside some money for the annual sales season. Walmart and Amazon were competing for the best deals on big screens and both advertised this model for the sale price of $688.00 Of course Amazon listed this in their lighting deals section and advertised the heck out of it. I thought I could stay home and get a great deal without having to deal with the relentless crowds and strife. So at 5:25 PM PST, I logged onto Amazon with intent to buy this 60\" Vizio panel.On Thanksgiving day, I excused myself from dinner and logged on the Vizio E60 product page at 5:27 PM; clicked F5 and refreshed it until I saw the price change from the usual $999.00 to the sale price of $688.00 It changed a few seconds after 5:30 PM, but I was unable to add it to my cart at the sale price. I got a message saying all the lighting deals had been claimed. In less than 15 seconds, the big black Friday sale was over. At this point, I decided to purchase it anyway, thinking that perhaps Amazon would honor their sale price afterwards. No such luck. If I could do it over again, I'd have tried my luck with local a Walmart or another retailer instead. More than likely I would have gotten the cheaper price, even after paying CA sales tax.So a few days later, the 60\" Vizio was delivered to my house. Out of the box, the picture was good. The store display mode had a crappy soccer image that did not do the panel justice. After hooking up an HDMI connection to my X-box 360 and cable box; I played around with the picture settings. The CNET color settings that another reviewer posted were okay, I found it to be too dull and washed out, the backlight needs to increased much more.  The advanced picture settings were correct though. Smooth motion makes everything look a crappy daytime soap opera. Turn that option off immediately. Gaming on the new panel is a pleasure. Some arcade HD remakes such as Rez HD, look phenomenal. Newer titles like Forza Horizon, Batman Arkham City, and Dead or Alive 5 really make the screen pop vibrantly as well. Four player split screen gaming on Sonic Racing Transformed and Halo 4 is a great pleasure as well. No longer do my fiends and I have to huddle around a small LCD.My Timewarner cable box is another story. Of the available HD channels; only about a handful at anytime look decent. After adjusting my cable box HDMI output to 1080i from 720P ,broadcast video improved slightly. Non HD source material looks like crap. I've gone to downloading only Bluray rips or 1080P encoded mp4 video files. It really makes me want to drop my cable and find a better HD provider. The occasional NFL games in HD and Science Channel documentaries look pretty good though. I noticed people on the sidewalk pausing to watch events as they pass by. The picture is that sharp and detailed from 15 feet away, even through window blinds.Short story: Great television for the price, shady business practices by Amazon. I really wished Amazon would not lead customers on about sales that last only a few seconds. Find a local retailer and pick it up yourself, it will be cheaper and you will have instant gratification. What is even more infuriating is that the price on the product page was fluctuating during the big sales week. This only added to my frustration and buyer's remorse.  Quite a shame though, as I used to love Amazon Prime and everything about it. At least I can watch Dawson's creek in glorious lifesize HD and cry alongside James Van Der Beek.P.S.

A separate review mentioned board problems with serial numbers less than 46. I have my fingers crossed.Set is easy to set up. DLNA works pretty well. Wifi works well as do Netflix and Amazon Instant Video. If you use a receiver for audio, you will need an optical audio cable to send audio from TV to receiver for Netflix, Amazon, YouTube or DLNA streaming.Picture quality is good if you follow the CNET post regarding calibration.  If you don't do this the picture is somewhat artificial with a smooth pseudo 3D look. I didn't care for this look. Too artificial. Many Vizio sets do this.

I had expected an older, thick, stripped down TV. This was bought because the price was so great. I was surprised to find a modern design with a thin bezel and a thin back and a lot of internet connectivity. The remote lacks backlighting and isn't programmable but I love the keyboard on the back. A pleasant surprise compared to the TV it replaced was that all audio in is routed to the optical out. That includes analog audio from the component input. This greatly simplified the Sony soundbar hookup since one optical cable is able to handle everything.Once the TV was set up I began to see issues. The picture was dark and two dimensional. After a LOT of playing around the picture is acceptable if not great. I had to disable the auto dimming and crank up the backlight. Boot times for the TV are around 20 seconds. This is on the painfully slow side and required placing a delay into my Harmony remote. I have to lay the remote so it stays pointed at the TV for the 20 seconds to make sure the proper input gets selected when turning the system on. As the system boots it is obvious that backlight uniformity is mediocre but during day to day viewing it isn't noticeable.YouTube looks great and it is nice to have the apps on the TV. Using them is pretty straight forward. Unfortunately I can't use the TV's DLNA features to view files on my media server. I have ripped my collection of over 1,000 CD's and the TV chokes on the large directory. I can eventually (and I mean after tens of minutes) get my video files to show but the process is too painful to be useful. This is a big disappointment because it means using the PS3 for media files and accepting the many limitations that brings.I can easily live with all of the issues previously mentioned. The one that continues to annoy is lip sync. As time goes on it gets worse and worse. The result is that every now and then I turn the TV off and back on to reset the sync. It's never really correct. The slow boot time makes resetting even more painful.Am I glad I bought it? Yes. At the price I wish I would have gotten a second one but this is a value buy.

It has a good picture - certainly nothing wrong with it and at the time we bought it I thought it was one of the best pictures I had ever seen but it was showing its age and I wanted something new since we just bought new furniture and will be repainting and moving everything around anyway.I had decided I wanted something larger and the 60\" sounded like a good size - and in the store it really didn't look all that big - but in my room, it looks HUGE (in a very GOOD way).

She has never been \"wowed\" with any electronics I've purchased (she may like them, but never wowed by them).  This TV changed that.  Last night we watched several different things through cable, Netflix, Huluplus, games on the XBOX and a Blu Ray on the PS3.  We were even streaming from the iMac upstairs and the picture was phenomenal.  On every single occasion she kept saying \"I can't believe how good that picture is\".  When we were watching \"The Dark Knight Rises\" on BluRay she must have said it seven or eight times during the movie - and coming from my wife that's high praise indeed.We had been able to watch Netflix, Huluplus, etc. through the PS3 or XBOX previously but it makes it much simpler to be able to do it directly from the TV itself and cuts back on the amount of power used since the only device that will have to be on to use it is the TV rather than the TV plus the other device.In short, we are thrilled with the quality of the picture on this TV and would strongly recommend it to anyone.", "Date": "December 30, 2012"}, {"Title": "Upgraded from 50\" plasma insignia", "Author": "Marcus", "ReviewID": "R3AELQJSARZ1FP", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Upgraded and couldn't be happier.

McNeill", "ReviewID": "R173TPSP7FCYXO", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "So far I have been very impressed with this television, especially at the $688 price point from the Amazon Lightning deal.  While it clearly isn't a top end Samsung or Sharp, it is very close in build quality and its picture quality can only be beat by their top models.  The Vizio's bezel is very thin, at 60 inches it simply looks gorgeous.  Vizio made several moves on this television that I commend them for.  The Vizio logo does not light up, and is on the bottom right.  This makes makes the TV look very clean.  The only indication light is very small and on the bottom left corner.  It shines through a foggy plastic so it doesn't shine directly at anything or light up the room.Now on to the picture quality.  Well, its good.  For the size the quality of the picture really is fantastic, I am often unimpressed by skin tones on brighter films and TV shows.  The black levels are good, not great.  I noticed some uniformity issues in the lighting, but its more of a clouding not light leakage.  Its only noticeable on an all black screen and even then, its not that bad.  Overall its very good, watching high definition movies and sports is as close to a movie theater experience as I've ever had.  It also performs very well with ambient light, my living room has windows all across the opposite wall.  Despite having blinds, my previous projection LCD television really lost its picture during the day, this one still looks great.I haven't played around much with the Smart TV capabilities.  I connected to my router and tested Netflix really quick.  It was a pain free process and seemed to work well.  But I will admit, I have almost no interest in this feature but at the price point its a better value than TV's without it.The remote is nice, but I prefer the longer profile and the keyboard on the back provides me little use while not using the Smart capabilities.The speakers are pretty much crap, but if you expect quality sound out of a TV 2 inches thick your dreaming.At $999, I might consider looking at finding the 60\" Sharp on sale instead.  But you can't go wrong with this TV, the picture quality and build quality are inching closer and closer to 1st tier.

When it comes to a major purchase, it's not something that I can do \"at the drop of a hat\".Before I purchased this Vizio, I also researched Samsung, LG, and Sharp - all the same size (60)with the same \"smart\" features.Understanding that my previous TV was a Sony DLP - while it too was also HD - there is no match between the two sets - the picture quality on the Vizio is sharp, clear and stunningly crisp. I have the set mounted on my wall (used the PowerBridge TWFP-WW thINWALL Solution Cable Management Kit and Advanced Slim Tilting TV Wall Mount for 32 to 60 inch LED, Plasma, LCD, and Televisions).  I would reccomend running and connecting 4 HDMI cables  - even if you only use one currently, you may want to add later.UPDATE # 1 - well all was good until Sunday 12/30/12 - just in tme for bowl game week - the whole TV went Kuput!!!  It was fine one second and then the picture went away - then no sound - - attempted every recovery I could think of  - Contacted Vizio support - - long story short they are sending a new TV - had the choice of having a repair service come and fix this one or a new one being delivered. I choose to get a new one - but.......... it could take 2 weeks -  guess I'll be watching the games on a smaller TV (wife doesn't care but.......)The set was 45 days old - so the location I purchased from has a 30 return policy - then it's the manufactors responsibility - so Vizio it taking full responsibility.Here are my thoughts - the main board (mother board) has gone bad - no warning,  - reading the reviews from all over the internet - seems that Vizio got a batch of bad board adn they know it - but the sets are out among the general populationDuring the 45 days, the picture quality was excellent - internet apps were good - sound from the set itself is OK - but go ahead and buy a sound bar it's worth the $$.UPDATE # 2 - 1/16/13OK, so I finally got my replacement TV from VIZIO - it took exactly 12 days (including the new years day holiday).  The replacement came in a new box and seems brand new - divlivery agent (manna) unloaded it from the truck, and un packed the TV in my home.  Took the \"old\" TV and repacked it into the box.The new TV has worked better from the initial setup - internet connections were quicker - signal is stronger, or at least the connection seems to be faster without any new hardware on the wireless transmission end.  In the few days that I've had the TV back everything on the internet works better.  Therefore I'm guessing the old TV was a lemon.Previously mentioned - TV is wall mounted with all cables and wires behind wall - While the TV was down, I went ahead and ran two additional HDMI cables (total of 4) and one VGA cable.

Maybe it's just a lemon...(?)Pro: Easy setup, wide viewing angles, variety of customizable picture presets, 4 HDMI inputs, simple WiFi & working apps, interesting two-sided remote (instead of keyboard) that allows for texting-style inputCon: Quality concerns; although HD, picture appears \"filtered\" (not sharp); limited connections for other-than-HDMI componentsSettled on this unit based upon input from Consumer Reports and other user ratings, plus it was in stock at major reputable retailer.Initial connections were intuitive.  Wireless fired off right away and indicated better reception than Kindle Fire and the TV it replaced.  Variety of apps worked right away.  Electronic user manual complements printed version, which is more or less just a quick start manual.Despite several positive aspects and favorable reviews, can say that I'm not impressed.Issues:1) Red lead for component connection initially didn't work.  A bit of working with the wires seemed to fix it.2) \"Vivid\" setting made everyone look orange on the first day but could be edited.  It seemed to settle down a bit by day #2.3) Picture appears muted/grayed and a bit fuzzy.  Although it's a high resolution/HD unit, the lines aren't clear and sharp, as though viewed through a filter (hence the need to use modified \"vivid\" setting).  Sometimes the picture is great, other times not so much.4) Sound drops off randomly for 30-90 seconds - sometimes just a bit, other times altogether - then returns.  Doesn't seem to have anything to do with large changes in sound levels (as in a suspense/action movie).  Changing volume control doesn't help.  Suspect faulty sound amplifier (already).5) Although I suppose it's nice to have 4 HDMI connections, I'd trade one or two of them for the ability to connect more than one \"legacy\" component (i.e., another set of RCA jacks).Have owned this for a little over 48 hours; it's going back.I thought about giving this a 3-star review until the sound issue resurfaced.Read through the other 1 & 2 star reviews and consider the quality you need, balanced against the possibility of the pain you'll encounter when the unit gives out at the 7-day/60-day/just out of warranty period as detailed by other reviewers.If you DO choose to purchase this one, I'd pay the extra few dollars for the extended warranty.ORYou can put that and a few more dollars together to purchase a more reputable unit.", "Date": "January 2, 2013"}, {"Title": "Poor customer service", "Author": "Robert Andrews", "ReviewID": "R1PQ4IMS2OH5JC", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I bought a Vizio E601i-a3 from a box store ( 1.5 hours away )because our TV went out.

Bought it from Walmart Black Friday (They did a great job of lining people up and letting us know how many were available.) SO much lighter than my old 60\" plasma and the picture is creepy life-like. As my son said, \"every show looks like a soap-opera\"! We dialed down the colors to \"movie\" setting and it took some of that away, but I will admit it will take a while to get used to the amazing refresh rate. It has every sort of feature except...YOUTUBE! What IS the deal with YOUTUBE? First ROKU, now Vizio! YOUTUBE is clearly displayed on all advertisements, but when I pull up the channels it is no where to be seen! Minor but annoying as I subscribe to several YOUTUBE shows and thought I'd finally get to see them in on a glorious 60\" display. So far, not so much. I would definitely buy this TV as I love it and the remote. One other minor complaint, the wall-mount screws are crazy short and are useless with any of the heavier mounts. Frankly I'm not sure how they'd reach the threads even if the mount plate was paper-thin.Pros: Picture, remote, price as Walmart sale, weightCons: wall mount screws, lack of YOUTUBEDefinitely a \"Buy\"IMPORTANT NOTE FOR AMAZON BLACK FRIDAYTried to buy this on Amazon's Black Friday. I have a fast connection and was ready to go when it went on sale at 8:30 Thursday. I would LOVE to know how many TVs were allotted for the sale to \"match\" Walmart. One? Four? What a scam! When I clicked the box the instant it went on sale the screen said \"waitlist full\". But on the regular $999 screen they had plenty of the TVs for sale (just not at that amazing price of Walmart). I shop Amazon a ton for the convenience, but I do not like the way they run their holiday sales. They should SHOW how many of each thing they have for sale (like they normally do) - not the nonsensical \"percentage sold\". Brick and mortar stores used to pull the same scam. They'd let 100 people line up to buy 5 X-Boxes or whatever - knowing full well that the last 95 people had no chance. After a few minor riots from rightfully indignent customers they stopped that nonsense and let people know exactly how many sets are available so the consumer could gauge when to show up or if it was even worth their time. I love my new TV from Walmart - where they told us how many they had and sold them at the sale price until they were OUT of stock, but as far as I'm concerned Amazon was intentionally vague and misleading since they had plenty more in stock - but chose not to sell them at the advertised price. This is the first time I've noticed them doing this sort of thing. I hope it's not a trend.12/10/12After a firmware update it now has access you Youtube. Which is good.

I just thought the prices were too high last year and was hoping they would come down a bit.  That's when I noticed this TV for sale a few weeks ago and could not pass it up.  I upgraded from a high-end 40 inch Sony LCD TV but the screen just wasn't big enough.  So I purchased the TV and it was delivered for free with enhanced delivery.  The enhanced delivery meant that a guy showed up during an appointment window that I set up, unpacked the TV, and helped me put it on my tv stand to make sure it worked before he left.  He was very nice and professional.  I can tell you that I like almost everything about this tv, the \"smart\" feature makes it easy to watch Netflix, the picture is huge, and the picture is great, at least when you're watching HD channels.  I have 7 other led tvs in my house and none are this large; however, the other tvs seem to be much more clear and precise when watching regular cable channels.  The other TVs are not as large but the picture on this Vizio looks terrible in standard def.  The other issue is that the picture when watching standard def. is that the normal picture is about half the size of the screen and the picture quality gets even worse if you stretch, zoom, etc. I have HD channels with my cable subscriber so I just changed my DVR to record all of my programs on HD channels and its great.  If I had standard definition channels only, however, I would hate the picture quality of this tv.  Like I said, it may have a little to do with the size of the screen, but I think its partly the tv picture quality as well.", "Date": "November 10, 2012"}, {"Title": "Love the picture, hate the problems ***UPDATED***", "Author": "Kindle Customer \"Farshooter\"", "ReviewID": "R20SCR2OE6O0H0", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "It took a week to get the TV after I ordered it and when it arrived, I was surprised how thin it was and how awsome it looked once I got it on the wall. Not much bigger than the 47\" I am replacing...then the trouble started. As another reviewer mentioned, the TV started powering off randomly as well as other problems;PROs- Great Picture- All the apps I use on a regular basis on other devices in one place- Digital Audio is better than previous TV- Easy setupCons- Won't hold wireless settings- Both Netflix and Amazon cut out after about 10+ min of playing (could be my network, but I really don't think so)- Random deactivationsAmazon is sending me a free replacement, but it will be another week before it arrives. If that one does the same as this, it will get returned completely and I will have to either go back to my old 47\" Sharp or get something else. Needless to say, I am not real happy with Vizio right now.***UPDATE***Got the replacement a few weeks ago and it is much better than the first one. One new issue was lipsync. On some of the HD channels the lipsync would start out fine and then stray to multiple seconds off. The lipsync option in the menus only went to the + side, not the -, which is where I needed to go. When I had finally reached the point of returning it yet again, I did some research and found that the way I had my soundbar hooked up might have been the problem. I had my cable box going to HDMI 1 and Optical Out to my sound bar from the TV. What I read said to have the cable box go directly to the amplifier (soundbar) and have the hook up from the amp go to HDMI 1. I made the change HDMI to Soundbar, Soundbar HDMI to HDMI 1 on tv, no more sync problems!!!Pros- Same as above + no more light bleedCons- WiFi is still a little wonkyOther than the one con, it is a great TV for the price. If I could have afforded a Sony or another Sharp, I would have purchased one of those; but I am pretty happy with the Vizio now.

I'm only making this comment here due to various people making comments about the TV turning itself off.  Though it's very possible that is ALL because of your TV it's also possible that this could be in part your power outlet.  I have an outlet where I can plug various items into without any problem, but if I try to plug in my 47\" 1080p LCD, the TV won't even turn on.  I could imagine that if I tried a big LED there that it might come on because it would use less power than my 47\" LCD, but it could possibly turn off if anything happened to the input power, such as a fluctuation.So, for any big TV, I think I would first replace the power outlet if they are more than 15 years old and have had a lot of use, or at least check the wiring inside to make sure all wires are tight.  If you aren't an electrician or used to working with home electrics then have a person who knows how to do it check it.

We have always had Samsung, and have never been disappointed. When pricing the TVs, we wanted to get the most for out money, but still have a have a quality product with the best picture we could get. I am a firm believer that you get what you pay for, and have stayed away from lower end lines because of this. This was our first venture with Vizio, and will most likely be our last. I'm not sure if most of the reviews for this tv are from people that have never owned other brands or not, but I was much happier with the picture from my much older Samsung 52\" LCD. The picture was a lot clearer and cleaner.I have tried many of the different custom settings I have found online, and still have yet find one that really gives me a picture I am satisfied with....that \"WOW....it's like being there!\" feeling. The picture is always lacking, always has a grainy look to it, if that makes sense. Watching sports, with the Samsung, it really was like being there.....with the Vizio, I can't get that. Very disappointed. I mean, it's an ok picture....but to me, certainly not a high def picture.Now on to the apps...this is supposed to be a smart TV that can stream movies and TV Shows through wifi. Again, a let down. We bought this so my family could use Netflix and Hulu without needing one of the game consoles (which we have always used previously, with zero issues). I travel for a living, and carry the game console with me for entertainment, so this was supposed to allow my family to enjoy their shows when I am gone. The Vizio is the ONLY device we have in the house that doesn't get a good signal. Hulu and Netflix both lag, and Hulu stutters while trying to play. They are so bad, we can't watch anything on them....a waste of my hard earned money if you ask me. We don't have a huge house, and out router is not a cheap one. Our house is a small 3BR Ranch style home, the router is in our bedroom on one end of the house, the TV is on the other end of the house in the living room, in a direct line from the router. Still doesn't work. Our game console is directly under the TV, and has  no problems streaming anything we want to watch.Bottom line, I wish I would have paid a little more and got the 55\" Samsung I was looking at.

At first I was really excited about this TV.  You simply cannot beat the size and quality for the price.  Unfortunately, after setting this TV up yesterday and hanging it on my wall, I am taking it down and returning it today.  There was a perceptible delay between the signal sent to the TV and its picture/audio.I set up my TV downstream of my receiver and let the receiver do all of the switching amongst the various components (cable box, DVD, computer, Xbox, etc).  The primary reason is because the receiver also drivers the 5.1 speakers in my room.  Where my 5yr old plasma had no problem, this TV had a very slight but noticeable delay that put it out of sync with the audio on the receiver.  It probably was less than 1/10 sec but still very noticeable.  With the TV speakers turned up, the delay would cause an echo so bad that made it sound like a bad concert hall special effect.  Even with the TV speakers off, you could notice the delay on the video when people were speaking.I tried messing with various settings including turning features like \"Picture Smoothing\" off or increasing \"Lip sync\" settings but nothing would improve the delay.  I suspect that it is a side effect of the time the TV takes to process and analze the incoming signal.  When I called Vizio support their suggestion was to take all the components and HDMI them directly to the TV which would also disable my surround sound speakers.  Not a solution.I am sorry to say that this TV is not going to work if you plan to have it downstream of your receiver/amplifier.  If you are simply hooking it direct to your cable box and not planning to run it off your receiver then the delay is probably not an issue.", "Date": "November 12, 2012"}, {"Title": "Not consumer oriented.", "Author": "Dale A.

My first purcahse and then a replacement unit. Quick summary:Pros:- Beautiful Picture- Lots of Features for a Low Price- Smart Apps Built In (if you need them or don't have Roku or Xbox etc)Cons:_ Default settings create a Soap Opera effect that can be annoying- Video delay that leads to audio getting out of sync (like 3 second delays on my first one, about 1 second on the second on. These are from ALL sources, so it's a problem with the TV, not the source)- Takes about 18 seconds to \"boot up\" from power on- Some ghosting and jittery motion (this was not prevalent on my first set, but is really bad on my second. You can see motion artifacts and jitters with fast moving objects)11/15/2012TV has a great picture at a great price but there are terrible lip sync issues. The audio and the picture are constantly out of sync. It is frustrating and annoying to watch TV when the sound is out of sync. Multiple people who have watched TV at my house have commented about the problems. This is definitely a really annoying bug. Can't recommend this product until they fix these issues. I think I am going to return mine to Amazon.UPDATE: 11/20/2012I called Vizio support to see if they could help me get to the bottom of the issues and fix it. Did a complete factory reset on the TV. Reset everything and still seeing major problems. Problems from Cable Box to TV, XBox to TV and even delays just watching the smart apps on the TV (no input or hdmi at all). Vizio support didn't have a fix. After 35 minutes and all kinds of trial and error attempts, they gave up and said they will have to send a technician. I think I'd rather just send the TV back. :/ My only question is... did I get a lemon or is this TV just bad? I don't want to exchange if I'm still going to see these issues on a new TV of the same model.UPDATE: 12/27/2012Sent original set back and got a new unit. Really bad audio sync issues went away on new unit. There is now a slight delay for video to process, but there are some workarounds. Second unit has video problems though... jittery motion blurs and artifacts. This is a bug with the TV because it wasn't there on my first unit and is there on my second one.I am returning my second TV. I think this could be a good TV, but VIZIO has some serious quality control issues.

It came when it was schedule to be delivered, the packaging was in perfect condition and there is nothing wrong with its performance. I did adjust the color settings per another review for this product and it does enhance the picture. However, 15 days after I received this TV which I bought for $999.99 it was a lightning deal for $688.00. That is a $311.99 discount or roughly 30%. My brother-in-law bought this TV on the lightning deal. I later found out we had the same TV, but he bought his two weeks after mine and paid significantly less.I was hoping Amazon would be willing to work with me and give me some sort of price matching, I emailed customer service and they told me about their TV Price Matching Program. The link didn't work. I called customer service and they explained that lightning deals are not covered by their price matching program. I understand this issue, but I am just dumbfounded by the fact that they were not willing to make any sort of offer to take the sting out of this situation where I overpaid $300 on something I could have gotten for $700. That is just really poor customer service in my opinion. I asked if they could give me an Amazon credit for less than the full price match, or a coupon for a certain percentage off other purchases, or anything - and they were unwilling to provide any sort of compensation. Go buy this TV from Costco, its cheaper there anyway.I will not buy any big ticket items (over a few hundred dollars) on Amazon unless it is a Lightning Deal or Gold Box Deal of the Day. I advise the same for everyone who reads this review. I would rather buy an item like this at a brick and mortar store knowing full well the price I pay is the best they will or can provide for the near foreseeable future. Amazon claims to be the \"Earth's Most Customer-Centric Company\" yet they refused to provide any sort of assistance in this situation.
