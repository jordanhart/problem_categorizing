No dimming or darkening, even when right next to the unit.For a basic TV this gets the job done.", "Date": "March 19, 2014"}, {"Title": "Excellent TV", "Author": "Rico Suave \"carp\"", "ReviewID": "R1X1LEH3DCXB66", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "The Roku ready adapter (sold seperately) is extremely fast, no lagging on the apps. I have the TV on my patio connected wirelessly and since it is roku I can use the slingplayer app to watch my directv on it without having to have another receiver out there. With all the extras you get on this tv for under $300 why would you look at anything else in this size range.

I didn't really need either of those, but I thought the Smart TV ability might be something I want in the future.Anyway, I have no regrets choosing this one.  I'll use this primarily as a large monitor for my laptop.  I'm a photographer, so the quality and options in such a display are very important to me.  I was able to turn sharpening off, and there are saturation and tint options so I can get very close to correct colors.  I was very happy to see that, unlike almost all consumer displays, this TV did not have overly blue colors right out of the box.  The picture itself is nice and clear.  No dead pixels, completely uniform lighting and color.The remote is colorful and surprisingly light.  It has enough buttons/options to put almost everything you could want at your fingertips.Sound is lackluster, but I never planned on using the TV speakers.  I suggest you don't plan on that, either.  I have it hooked up to some powered speakers - not an A/V receiver.  If you plan to hook it up to an A/V receiver, use the L/R RCA Audio Out jacks.  Audio Out takes the control of the sound away from the TV/remote, because it assumes you'll control that through the receiver.  My powered speakers don't have their own remote, so instead I hooked them up via the headphones jack on the TV.  This way, I can control the audio levels with the remote and not have to get up and turn the knob on my speakers.All in all, highly recommended!  Haven't heard of oCOSMO and are anxious.  Please don't be.  This TV rocks.

Read here", "Author": "Will", "ReviewID": "R4LDBDDG0W72V", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I purchased this TV last month as a living room TV. I saw the great price and decent reviews online and decided to take a risk and purchase a TV that had mixed reviews... Boy do I regret it.It wasn't a few days before this TV had dead pixels forming before my eyes as I proceeded to tell myself it was a quality TV for the price. Next, the HDMI port proceeded to fail and cause the screen to be fuzzy, having to play around with the cord to get the picture back again. THIS TV IS LOW QUALITY. Sure, I expected sub-perfect quality, but I didn't expect a TV that is just absolutely un-watchable.Returning the TV was a nightmare and I don't wish it upon my worst enemy! I wish I would have just purchased a quality TV to begin with.After dealing with the return, I purchased a MUCH better TV for only $80 more. Trust me, $80 extra is worth the better quality TV and not having to deal with a bad quality TV and returning that bad TV.If you want a QUALITY 40 inch TV, check this one out -----> http://amzn.to/SCb3Qp it is here on Amazon. I currently own it now and have never been HAPPIER! It has a great quality picture and wasn't insanely expensive like some of the other TV's for sale here.

You can tell it's not made of high quality materials but the screen itself is what matters and with that, I'm very satisfied. It seems to produce vibrant and clear images with decent audio (though I'm adding a soundbar to it). One thing to note, as another reviewer recently mentioned - someone seems to be stealing the materials inside, including the remote, user manual, and base connector (which includes a mini screwdriver). I too opened the box to find all that stuff missing so I called oCosmo and to my delight they overnight shipped all that was missing. Kind of a hassle to have to do that but it might actually be an issue with Amazon's warehouse.
