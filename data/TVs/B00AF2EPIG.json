I bought it new on Black Friday in 2012 and it has held up since then. Obviously you can find better TVs with better quality control and 1080p, but this thing really isn't bad. This is a lesser brand TV compared to say Vizio or Samsung, etc, but it works just like a TV should work. I'm not ashamed of having this TV and I would probably buy it again if I could find it for 100 dollars and I was in desperate need of a TV.", "Date": "November 17, 2013"}, {"Title": "A beautiful HD picture for a good price", "Author": "captiii", "ReviewID": "R17XZWXLCAJWOF", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "When I bought this TV it was the least expensive 32\" that I could find.  I has happy with the purchase, the picture quality is excellent. I have had it for about 18 months  without any problems.  The one drawback is that the installed speakers are very poor quality.  I solved that problem by hooking it up to a Philips DC199B/37 iPod Docking Audio 2.1 30-Watt System.  This combination provides excellent audio to go with the already beautiful picture.The 3 HDMI inputs, and total of 6 HD inputs all work as expected.I recommend this TV and would purchase another APEX product in the future.", "Date": "November 7, 2013"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "Unavailable", "Features": "Video Resolution: HD - 720p.
