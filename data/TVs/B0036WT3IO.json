I was torn between C350, C530 and this. I ultimately went for this because it was the sweetspot for me between price/performance.Pros - The picture is excellent, my friends have Vizios from 2008 ranging between 26\" up to 46\" and in comparison, they look dim and unsaturated compared to this model from Samsung. 720p/1080i or downcoverted 1080p looks excellent, the picture quality at 1366x768 looks sharper, brighter and more colorful than other budget 32 inch 1080p models I seen. You can only notice stairstepping/pixels if you sit less than 2 feet away. Which with a TV this size would be way too close. I sit 6 feet away and edges are smooth (I have 20/20 vision.) OTA HD with bunny ears/loop antenna looks flawless. Upconverted 480p content looks great for it's format. The amount of options to play with are great. But, even so, this TV looked excellent on it's factory default settings. This TV also has multiple sound settings such as Movie and Clear voice modes. By the way, the speakers are hidden and loud, I have it set to 5-6 volume (out of 50) when using the PS3, 8-10 when watching TV, with very good sound quality for it's wattage.Cons- 8ms refresh rate, many might not notice but, going from a CRT (SD) to an LCD (HD), it was expected. In games it's not really noticeable but, news tickers and other scrolling text it's noticeable, but, this could be related to the TV being 60hz. Another thing is that it's not true 1080p. 1080p content looks excellent however, it's being displayed at 1366x768. This is a subjective thing, at 6 feet away, 1080p and 1080i/720p look the same on a 32\". But, if you want to future proof yourself, get the C530/C550. The stand is fine but, you may have to tighten the screws down until the they stop turning to make it stable. 480i non converted SD channels/inputs look so-so.Synopsis - Besides 480i (SD), excellent picture quality for it's class, even better than comparable 1080p sets from other brands. LCD refresh rate will take a few days to get used to if this is your first HDTV.With Prime, this came the next day for a few bucks more, thanks Amazon.", "Date": "May 11, 2010"}, {"Title": "Fantastic", "Author": "Art M. \"Art\"", "ReviewID": "R19KC3H2JG00VY", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "It was easy to set up and plays cable and DVD's beautifully.Relatively compact size.It has a very special feature for those that are hard of hearing: there is a sound setting called \"clear voice\".It appears to raise the treble information relative to midrange and bass, and also, makes the distinctions between sounds much sharper.  For those hard of hearing, who usually have good bass/midrange hearing but rolled off treble, this will be a revelation.  No more annoying your neighbors because you have to blast the TV in order to understand the voices.  Also the TV does seem to play closed captions about as well as it can.My aunt is using closed captions on cable TV and standard DVD playback and it works great.  We had trouble using CC on a new upscaling DVD player using HDMI but that turns out to be a problem with the HDMI specification; HDMI relies on the source to decode CC and put the words on the screen, whereas older cable formats and resolutions like composite carry the CC signal distinct from the picture to the TV for decoding.  This appears to be a major step back but it's not the fault of the TV.  If you Google \"cc dvd hdmi\" you will find a LOT of conversation on the net about this problem.

I originally bought the 27 inch Samsung 1080p at Costco, but found it a little small for the space.

The size is perfect, the picture is great (with an HDMI cable) and the sound is also much sharper on this TV than the one I returned to Costco.  I even linked my Roku to pandora and am playing it through this tv...sounds great!  My one and only complaint is that the remote control is unnecessarily large.

As good as the picture is what I was even more impressed with was the clarity of the audio. It really makes it enjoyable to watch a movie or show. Kudos to Samsung for including such good sound with their TV's. I had to return a Hitachi 47\" LCD because the sound was so weak and tinny. 25% Volume is quite sufficent with this model.

You are clearly talking about a different model.I don't know if it was the Thanksgiving sale, but for $350, I couldn't resist buying.  Before I stumbled upon the 450 model, I was pretty set on purchasing the 350 model which was around $330.  I'm so glad I found this for this price on Amazon.  It was priced around $500 everywhere else.  It seems there's a big difference in the sound quality between the 350 and 450.  I am no sound expert, but the 450 is more than enough sound for my tv/movie viewing needs.  Other than an additional HDMI port, the 450 allows you to play videos off of a usb thumb drive.  The 350 is only able to play music and photos.As for the picture, simply put, it's amazing.  You can also find configuration settings online to make the picture slightly better.  People mentioned that the color gets distorted at a 30+ degree angle, but if you need to regularly watch a 32'' tv at a 30 degree angle, either you need to move your furniture around or get a bigger tv.  I don't think 32'' tvs are meant for more than 4 people on a regular basis.  For the price, you cannot go wrong with this Samsung TV.  Quality is excellent and you get 1 year warranty (labor and parts).", "Date": "November 29, 2010"}, {"Title": "Perfect Break Even Point Between Size / Price", "Author": "Comcenter \"Erick\"", "ReviewID": "R1BJ9CFCH3LUE1", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I was looking for a good size, Samsung tv that would offer all the features of a flat screen tv, and not break my pocket. At the rate technology is evolving it won't be long before we all have to upgrade out televisions again, with larger screen sizes, improved performance and lower prices.LED televisions are still too expensive, hopefully they will come down somewhat in the near future. Plasma is known to be a sucker for electricity, so even with their lower price tag, they would end up breaking my pocket in the end. Thus I decided to go with LCD, decent power consumption and reasonable price.Then I was left with the screen size options. After looking at potential larger screens, I discovered that a 46 inch is almost twice the price, for 10 inches more! I decided to stick with this model, which comes in several screen resolutions. I think the 450 gives you a good value at 60,000 to 1 contrast ratio, compared to lower end 350 model at only 35,000 to 1 contrast ratio, and the price difference is insignificant.I've had this tv for about a week, it feels quite comfortable and easy to use. A few things I found missing where:- This unit does not have a lighted remote.- No SVGA input, which is my best shot at a better image from my cable box.On the Positive side:- It has 2 10w outputs for external speakers (2 x 10w = 20w)- One touch sleep mode.- Lots of features for adjusting image quality like the ones found in high-end tv's.As far as the 720p, you won't miss it. Considering DVD quality is 480p, and your cable or satellite feed is even lower, unless you plug in a Blu-Ray player and play a Blu-Ray disc you won't be missing out on anything. If you will only be using this tv for watching regular television programming, this tv is way more than enough.

While touching the power cable the TV cut on and off several times and I continued to hear electrical popping sounds. That night I left it unplugged as I did not want to start a possible FIRE.

Now I understand the complaints.  The second TV I purchased,  appears to have an identical stand as the first, but did not install so easily.  I struggled over an hour trying to attached the stand.  The screws provided just weren't long enough to fully tighten and secure the stand to the base of the TV.  Fortunately, I had some same diameter screws on hand which were slightly longer and enabled me to secure the base.
