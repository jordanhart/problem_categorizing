True colors, good viewing angle, and easy set up. I like the unified digital sound output, which feeds all audio inputs out. Allowed easy single digital audio coaxial cord connection to my Yamaha AV Receiver.Worst part of TV is explaining to your friends why you just bought a DLP TV. Constant frowns from those inquiring, yet everyone who has seen it is impressed. Terrific Blu Ray images; Avatar video is amazing! Direct TV HD images are very good. Video much better than my old Samsung HD 61\" DLP, replaced since it stopped working. Mitsubishi claims that all video images are up-converted to 1080P.  Small physical size of this 65\" Mitsubishi allowed me to fit it in a cabinet that previously was filled by the 61\" TV of similar physical size.  All LCD 65\" TV's were too large physically to fit in my space, and picture quality is definitely comparable.  Well worth having the larger screen size.

unbeatable.My kids played XBOX 360 on it this AM & are now \"zombie like\" in front of a movie.We don't even have this hooked up / calibrated all the way yet, but colors / sharpness are simply amazing!And the surround sound is actually REALLY good (I have Bose speakers I plan to hook up later...)Remote on this TV is definitely terrible (esp. at first) - although once you actually READ THE MANUAL & test out the buttons, there are definitely a bunch of useful features...USB input is VERY nice - have already hooked it up to my PC & also run a few slide shows of my digital pictures - AWESOME!Yes, there are issues with the lamp (which will eventually burn out) - but Mitsubishi made this a pretty simple cartridge to slip in & out.  So, either buy a spare bulb, or purchase an extended warranty (I got 4 yrs. for $99 which covers up to $1500).TV is inching ever closer to $1000 & I would look for free shipping...I dare you to find any other comparable technology, size for that price.And since ours will mostly be used by kids, why pay more?I mean, a new bulb is like getting a new TV for several more years.And once they actually get 3D going, there's a slot for converter box & glasses (these sets use DLP, which is what the theaters use, but current standard is checkerboard, so you'll need to spend approx. $300 more for 3D - again, check prices for integrated 3D & tell me you're willing to spend for THAT!)I'm also assuming my satellite provider, DirecTV, will eventually come out with a 3D offering & I've heard of no issues with current BluRay's.  Again, I'll wait, knowing I have a 3D ready TV.Only thing that's better is true LED - which, if this baby was part of my \"adults only\" home theater, bonus room, \"man cave\" - I might see.But, it's downstairs in the \"kid cave\"...where my kids are now...SMILING EAR-TO-EAR!!!", "Date": "July 3, 2010"}, {"Title": "very impressed", "Author": "freddy", "ReviewID": "R2J4S35CMVFAZ5", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "LATEST REVIEW AS OF JULY 2001, READ ON TO THE BOTTOM. I have been reading reviews on this tv for 6 months, deciding if this was the tv I wanted. A lot of the reviews were from people who have only had the set for a few days. Well, I was looking for reviews from people who have had the tv for much longer to see if they still liked it 6 months down the road. I didn't see too many of those. And, I am about to become one of those people. I have had it for almost 2 weeks. I am completely satisfied with picture. I was reading things about shadowing on fast moving scenes, or was worried about the picture pixelating. I have watched football, and action movies on the set and have not noticed any of the above. I have a 42\" plasma in the other room, the picture is nearly comparable to it. The colors are bright and sharp. I read about having it professionally set up, but found that I only made slight changes to the factory settings. And it being 65\", it is like sitting in a movie theater, the picture is huge. I can hardly watch the 42\" plasma any more, it seems so small, and I upgraded from a 50\" hitachi rear projection, and even that seem small. The only thing I have found is the menu is a bit hard to navigate through, the instruction bookelet is a bit vague on how to manuever through the settings, but you will figure it out, I did. Once you have the tv set up, they tell you to have all you other equiptment hooked up and turned on, and the set will recognize them, it did on some things. I found I had to re-connect a few things, while the tv was on, and it did find them. I had also read in some of the reviews about having to replace the tube, that is does not last long. This is not my main tv for veiwing, so I suspect it will last longer. But if that is the only  drawback, the tubes are only about $100 bucks, and you can replace it yourself. So my plan is to have and extra bulb on hand, in case it does go out, I won't be without a tv for any length of time. The shipping was quick, from One Call. It came in one week. For something that size, that is pretty impressive. I had hooked the set directly up to my surround sound, so it found that, and went right to my stereo, so I cannot comment on the speakers on the tv itself. But, so far I love the tv. I paid less for this 65\" than I did my 42 plasma. So you get a much bigger bang for your buck. So over all, at least for the first two weeks, I love my new tv, and would reccomend it to anyone. I had read some negative reviews, people have had problems with their sets. This reminds me of when I go on vacation, and read reviews about the places I want to travel to. Some people loved it others did not. This is not to say that there are legitimate problems, but some people do have a bad experience. But, mine was a good one. And I am very pleased.  The tv does take a minute  to  warm up, not instant on, but that is ok. I have a digital cable box, a dvd player and a vcr hooked up to it, and all is fine. So my reccomendation is to buy this set. But, I will leave an other review in 6 months to see if it holds up. My wife asked me why I would buy another rear projection tv. Because of the size of the screen for the price. I am not disappointed. Great television.HAVE HAD THE TV FOR ALMOST A YEAR NOW. I STILL LOVE IT. IT RIVALS THE PLASMA. I HAVE HAD NO PROBLEMS. I HAD IT ON STANDARD PICTURE FOR THE LONGEST TIME, SUPPOSED TO BE THE MOST ENERGY EFFICIENT. I THOUGHT I SHOULD HAVE A BETTER PICTURE, I WAS RIGHT. I SWITCHED TO BRIGHT FROM STANDARD.
