It's picture quality is amazing from cable to BluRay to DVD.  It has brought my old DD's to life with the motionflow 240hz technology.  If you know anything about this, it looks as if you are on the set when they are filming and gives a depth to each scene.  Just watched the Se7en on it (non-Blu-Ray) and caught things I missed on the set due to this TV's clarity and depth.  I thought it would only bring my Blu-Ray's to life, but even movies like The Natural plain DVD were killer and made Robert Redford seem timeless like it was recently shot even though the movie was shot nearly 30 years ago.I purchased this set from a local Fry's for 999.00 and based on thorough research and comparisons, it was a steal.  Even watching the high end Sony's etc, they were giving the same picture quality at almost twice the price.I can't speak for the lip sync issues, as I have it running to an old surround sound system and not showing any problems.Bottom line, LG is making a rival 240hz slick design flat panel that exceeds other high end brands at a fraction of the cost.", "Date": "November 21, 2009"}, {"Title": "Great TV but...", "Author": "rivered", "ReviewID": "R2YQF57NPIUXVN", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "The external appearance of the 47SL80 is simple yet very nice to look at, the base and swizel is very solid and heavy, not cheap and plastic like most tvs, and the picture is beautiful. I use an external sound system so I can't comment on the sound. I didn't like the Trumotion but from all the TVs I've seen with 120hz and 240hz, they all seem to make the picture look unnatural to me.  The big thing I disliked about this TV and the reason I'm returning it is the screen is too reflective, it's like a black mirror.  If the screen is black I can actually see my lazy self on the screen, something which is probably good for me because it might get me in the gym but something I definitely don't like to look at.  So my advice is if you're in shape and nice to look at get this TV otherwise look for a matte type screen.  And if you're use to reflective screens like the ones on the plasmas this probably isn't more reflective then those, just something I'm not use to and don't like.", "Date": "December 15, 2009"}, {"Title": "Best TV for the price", "Author": "seacap", "ReviewID": "R2BQUK2Y2LBE7P", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I have never written a review on Amazon before, but I do have to write a review on this TV as there is only one review giving it one star. I received this TV today and couldn't ask for better service from Amazon. They delivered it with the free shipping and the company even installed it for me! This TV has very beautiful lines and with its \"borderless\" frame design, I would have to agree with most it just makes it that much better. The intelligent sensor on this TV is a nice feature for people that like the TV to do all the adjusting automatically based on your lighting but I would have to say that using the vivid setting with the energy saving is the best setting. The trumotion 240 Hz is an excellent feature to have as it smoothes out jitter from previous 60 Hz models. Personally, I could not have picked a better TV for the price and I would have to say this is a steal and would recommend it to anyone!", "Date": "November 6, 2009"}, {"Title": "STAR STRUCK", "Author": "Jerry H. Bond", "ReviewID": "RQO7K89CT3XVE", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Purchasing the LG47SL80 was primarily based on in-store evaluations, Consumer Reports recommendations and reading every review I could find.  In over 30 years, I've never been disappointed using these guidelines.Viewing this TV is better than watching live action because real life doesn't always offer perfect lighting. The LG47SL80 does.  From a distance of 7 feet, my choice in a darkened room for a genuine movie experience, the pimples and imperfections on all those beautiful people, whom I thought were absolutely perfect, clearly show up through their makeup.  I have yet to decide if this is a pro or con.  It is AMAZING CLARITY.Choose a matt screen vs. glossy black wisely.  If you have complete control of the lighting in your TV room, the glossy black screen is phenomenal.In a large family room with lots of windows and several viewing angles, you might consider the matt screen.Regardless of the room lighting conditions, when the set is turned off, most rooms exude more pop and pizazz with the reflections and accents afforded by a huge glossy black screen than they do with a dull chunk of matt glass.The remote is responsive and easy to use.  It took about 15 minutes of playing around with the menu selections to gain a total understanding of the unit.The \"White-Glove\" delivery came through as promised.  Before placing my order, I had questions about the company making the delivery.  Were they bonded and insured?  They were.Amazon.Com gave me the names of 3 possible companies and explained that once my shipment arrived into my area, it would be assigned to one of these companies.  That company would in turn contact me to set up a delivery time.  In my case, the initial delivery was scheduled for December 28th.  It was delivered on the morning of December 24th and was set up in about 20 minutes.Merry Christmas.My signal comes from two roof-top antennas, as a result, the audio and video are in perfect sync and spectacular.Using the up/down channel selection switch takes 2 seconds for the channel to change and the picture to appear.  Pressing the numerical buttons to select a channel takes 5 seconds for the picture to appear.  This might be important to other impatient, channel-surfing males like myself.The set replaced a 250-pound Toshiba Cinema Series HD 36-inch tube TV, which heretofore, I thought was as good as it gets.  Was I ever wrong.  This monster sat in a cabinet that weighed as much as the TV and moving the ensemble out from the wall to make cable connections was not an option.  Making the connections would have challenged a circus contortionist. It was excruciating agony of gigantic proportions.  I can't wait for the 2nd such TV to die.The heavy and sturdy stand on the LG swivels about 30 degrees making connections in back a breeze.  For me, this was the best upgrade of all.Even without the benefit of the swivel stand, the viewing angle is outstanding and the best I've ever seen on any LCD TV.  The viewing angle on this set is advertised at 170 degrees.  I find that claim to be pretty accurate.My DVD movies are nearly as eye-popping as Blu-Ray.  In fact, it is hard to see a significant difference using a progressive up-converting OPPO player.I connected a sound system and found it to be a bit overwhelming.  Besides, it scared the beejeebers out of the cats. The TV sound suits me fine and offers several variations.  If a tree falls through the roof or the cats start remodeling the house I'd like to be able to hear it.After two weeks of daily use, I can't find anything to complain about with this TV.  I would make the same purchase again.  However, for a larger room, I would seriously consider the LG 55-inch screen with backlit LED.There is not much more clarity, if any, to be gained by waiting on new technology.  If 3D is all they have to offer, I'm not interested. 3D was a fad 40 years ago.  It has always been a fad and probably will be in the future.  Besides, those silly-looking, cardboard glasses were a pain.  When 3D TV hits the market, 3D glasses will have controls and cost up to a hundred dollars.  And everybody in the family will have to have their own pair in their favorite color.  Please spare me the agony.I am being bombarded with an offer of  a 3-year LG Premium Care Plan for $159.99. Most all consumer advocates warn against buying these.  I agree.  If a product turns out to be a lemon and fails to preform satisfactorily, then I spread the news as fast and furious as possible.  Ten of thousands of other consumers do likewise.  Therefore, it falls the lot of the manufacturer to produce the best product possible that will last or else they won't.On with the show.", "Date": "January 15, 2010"}, {"Title": "OUTSTANDING VALUE", "Author": "Nitpicker", "ReviewID": "R17G5CEQXFBUGF", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I own a 46\" Samsung previously rated #1 by a Consumer organization.  This 47\" LG is far superior on several levels.Pros:  Unbelievable picture quality, especially on movie channels.  Tweaker's delight.  Numerous user customizable settings for both picture and audio.  Television is thin and very sharp looking.  Cost is several hundred dollars lower than comparable heavily advertized models.  Remote is well laid out and easy to use.  240hz user-controllable scan rate on a TV at this price.  4 HDMI 1.3 inputs.Cons:  Stand must be installed by the user (I cut LG a little slack, it is only 8 screws and took 5 minutes).  User should tweak picture settings to get the best PQ.  Once adjusted, the picture quality is incredible.If picture quality is your primary concern, you will not be disappointed by the LG 47SL80.  Also, Amazon consistently had the best price for the TV.As a side note, Pilot air folks called and provided a local number to setup delivery.  Delivery was on-time and the delivery staff were very courteous.  For me this was a good experience overall.

The picture quality is great and after 2 weeks I don't see any dead pixels. Set-up was easy, but I suppose most of them are.  I spent a fair amount of time researching TVs and based on the good reviews I heard about buying on Amazon (i.e. return policy), the TV picture quality (based on visual comparison to other TVs I saw in the store) and the fact I had a limited space so the 47 inch (verus 46 inch) gave me a little more screen size, I decided to buy this TV.  I don't really know what else to say besides I'm happy with it.  One caution I would give is I suspect the glass screen cover would reflect a light pretty bad, so be sure that where you set it up you're not going to have a lamp or windows shining right into it.", "Date": "November 19, 2009"}, {"Title": "EXCELLENT TV !!!!", "Author": "Zoso", "ReviewID": "R1N1I9U9NXXD61", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "The 47SL80 has amazing picture quality and very attractive, refined high-end styling.

Rather than send it back, I was able to get a partial credit applied to my account.The quality and performance of this LG is truly amazing. I researched many brands and found this TV to be far superior in picture and sound.

Only problems I have encountered are that glare is an issue because of the glass front instead of the matte finish on most LCDs. Also, the TrueMotion 240Hz feature makes most shows look like soap operas. It looks great for sports and can be turned off easily for non-sports. I bought this TV to replace another LCD that had the screen broken my a mystery impact (nobody knows anything about it).

The only problem is the TV stand.  It is not assembled well and the TV is not completely stable on top of it.  This in turn causes the TV to sit leaning to the right side.  The original stand sent with the TV was lower on the right by 7/16 of an inch.  After spending 1-1/2 hour on he phone with customer service they sent a new one that was better but not by much.  The set now sits lower on the right by 1/8 of an inch and it still wobbles some. Customer service is in Mexico and is very slow on the phone plus the agent I spoke with did not know the product.  She kept asking for information that was not available on the TV.

THIS TV FLAT OUT ROCKS!!!  The picture quality on this thing is absolutely stunning.  The Blacks are deep, and the lines are crisp.  Right out of the box the preset picture settings are very good (I personally like the Vivid setting, the Xbox 360 and Gears of War look awesome).  Even when the power is off on this tv, there isnt a tv on the market that looks nicer.  This tv is only 1.8\" thick at its thickest point, and having the \"seamless\" front it looks sleek and beautiful.  I would highly reccommend this product to anyone.  Only negatives about it is the sound quality is so-so, but I did get the Harman/Kardon HKTS-18 speakers and the pioneer VSX-819-K receiver to solve this slight problem.  Overall I paid $1350 shipped for this tv, and could not be happier with this thing.  I doubt you could find an LCD TV with a better picture than this at this pricepoint.

If reliability and customer service are on your list of requirements for a television manufacturer, I suggest looking elsewhere.I have called LG four times now. Every time I would call, they would review case details. While reviewing the case with me, they would mention the model number of the previous generation (non slimline). I would correct them only to have them essentially call me a liar and state that the TV in question does not exist.Please research LG Lip Sync for more information.Other Thoughts: Stay away.
