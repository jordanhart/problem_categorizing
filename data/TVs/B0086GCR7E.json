The picture could not be viewed from any more than a slight angle. The worst feature was the sound. It was hard to hear and tinny. I was very unhappy with it so I returned it to Amazon for a refund. As always their return policy was great. I would not recommend this product.", "Date": "May 17, 2013"}, {"Title": "Different purpose use - security monitor", "Author": "Vance", "ReviewID": "R17YT1C7G98YSW", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "Ok,so I was installing a 4 channel wired surveillance system w/ dvr and needed a screen to view it with. I had no extra computer monitor but didn't want a hulking CRT either...hence the flat screen. I did not think even generic computer monotors cost double what I paid for this..even clearance staples monitors were 50 bucks more...fine if I planned to have other purposes or possibilities for it but since I mainly wanted something for pure security monitoring...cheaper route is fine. Enter the Proscan. Since my security DVR had both HDMI and monitor ports...I found this for 88 bucks! Why not? Hooked it up and it worked fine!Cons:- Speakers are not great but since I'm only listening to security audio...no dolby surround needed- Light as all hell..plasticy - I thought I got an empty box but it was in there- Remote is cheapy but it works and serves the purpose, I'll let you know if/when I drop it accidentally  HAHA- TV menus are basic enough - spartan if that- back connections, who the #$%! decided it was a good idea to recess the row of connection points?! If you have a stiff cable (like the HDMI or the typical boxy VGA) prepare for some wire acrobatics...otherwise, 45 or 90 connection is friendlier. I think this is the peeve that really confuses me design-wise...still scratching my head on this one!I put fair stars - to be completely objective, it serves MY purposes well. Would I buy this for a everyday entertainment piece? No....not that it doesn't function..but I would certainly chip in some extra bucks for a more user friendly, higher performance TV. Otherwise, it is cheaper than a monitor and much cheaper than \"security\" flatscreens which is essentially the same darn thing. For what it's worth....", "Date": "September 24, 2013"}, {"Title": "Very good", "Author": "allen ma", "ReviewID": "R3MH1JNWUBQN40", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "a very good product, with a cheap price. i Use it as a monitor, and it works wonderful, and the spund it not bad.", "Date": "November 15, 2013"}, {"Title": "You get what you pay for", "Author": "James N.

Remote didn't work from day #1, called company, they sent a new remote in 12 WEEKS ... It didn't fix the problem ... For example, when you press #8, it should jump to channel 8 ... Nope, never worked on ANY numbers, which was why I asked for new remote ... That said & completed, I now have lines going thru the picture ... After placing a different tv on that jack, to be certain it was  the PROSCAN and not my wall jack, I called customer service .... I was informed that \"I\" must pay to ship the TV back to them, and they decide if I get a repair or replacement ... Not fair, still under warranty! ... Rep said it was a problem the company is aware of on this model ... Well geez, then YOU should pay to fix it ... I paid the purchase price already!It will cost about $25 to ship base rate, plus will take 6-8 weeks to get back the repaired tv ... Is this fair? .... NO ... I later found out thru feedback on several other websites that sell PROSCAN, that their entire tv line is having issues with defective hardware, LED backlighting, and more .... and it's a branch off RCA (well RCA used to be good) .... Never buying another PROSCAN nor RCA.... Not the same good quality of years past ... I have a SAMSUNG 19 inch that's held up 4 years, I plan to get another of those and garbage this PROSCAN in the dumpster on trash day next week.", "Date": "September 19, 2013"}, {"Title": "Proscan -inch LED HDTV", "Author": "DANIEL R.
