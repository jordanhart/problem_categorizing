Thanks to the new 5% deposit mortgages in the uk I was able to buy one and replace my window, the thing is no one knows because The 4k resolution is so detailed that when coupled with the 3d images of open windows a cool breeze proceeds to enter the room.I do have to admit that the batteries wasn't the decider for me it was the fact that it came with a Manuel for this is a must for the proper orientation of the tv, I know this because I attempted to mount the tv without reading the Manuel first and I ended up mounting it backwards.WARNINGIf you have vertigo do not place the screen on the floor and put a picture of anything taken from more than 1893.67 mm off the ground as damages due to fainting is sadly not covered in the warranty.ALSO WARNINGthis tv does not do corners, when transporting you must use either the flu network or amazon prime air for 85inches is an oil tanker of a tv.FINAL WARNINGwhen tv programs warn you that some scenes may be upsetting an immediate action must be to turn off the tv for the detail this tv provides will add a whole new meaning to upsetting, if this isn't possible within 3.5 seconds then the remote can be thrown at the tv, this is a safer option because mainly it will save your life and partly because this action is covered in the warranty (please note prior to throwing of remote batteries must be inserted incorrectly otherwise the warranty is invalid)Thanks.", "Date": "December 3, 2013"}, {"Title": "FALSE ADVERTISING", "Author": "Nick Liguori", "ReviewID": "R34IGLG0PJDT81", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I purchased this TV about 3 years ago.The picture is beautiful. I have not had any problems.The only negative about the TV is thestand. It shows a stand in the picture but it does not come with the TV.The stand is additional and runs in the thousands. I think at the time depending on the type the stand or wall mount was between $2,000 to $3,500. I had a professional build a custom mount for mine. I would give the TV five stars except for the stand problem.
