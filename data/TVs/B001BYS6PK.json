{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Great TV at a great price!", "Author": "R. Toro", "ReviewID": "R1FSNEMMK7HXLW", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "After contemplating the decision to replace my 32\" HD Toshiba tube TV for over a year, this Sharp TV went on-sale for Black Friday and I couldn't pass up the bargain.I had and have done a TON of research on LCD TVs and I would always end up not buying one due to the prevalence of the \"next year's model will be even better\" mentality that the manufacturers continue to push.Well, I can tell you that while this TV may not be some top-of-the-line Sony or Pioneer, the picture is quite frankly fantastic.I truly believe that we have entered the realm that audio equipment exist in within the TV product space, there's plenty of ultra high-end audio gear out there that costs 10 times as much as the consumer stuff, but most people don't care to may such a premium for little additional value.So, my point is that while this TV doesn't have the fastest refresh time, best contrast ratio, or 120Hz technology that competing TVs have I have yet to be anything but impressed with the performance. I will also say that since the cable and satellite companies compress the heck out of their signals the TV will not be the deciding factor for quality of the picture most of the time.I did also purchase a Blu-ray player to use with the TV. As of this writing I have not played Blu-ray disc, but I have played many regular DVDs which are up-converted to 1080p with great results.What I like about this TV is that each input can be tuned independently for all picture settings(I used the THX tuner for my Blu-ray input), and there are a TON of settings. The dynamic backlighting works perfectly and when it adjusts it will show you the adjustment via a series of leaf icons; this tells you how bright the backlight is being set to.Also, being able to custom name all of the inputs as well as skip the ones that aren't connected is great.Audio-wise, the sound is fine. I use a 5.1 surround system for all DVD/Blu-ray movies and when we are watching a movie on cable, but for standard programming the sound is fine. It probably can use more bass, but where the heck are you going to fit a cone and magnet in this thing?Finally, the dimensions of the TV are listed somewhat incorrectly as the set is only maybe 6 inches deep, but the stand is 12 inches in depth. I was also surprised at how light the panel itself is - I've hung plasmas that were only 42\" and they weighed a ton... this set is very light from a weight perspective.Ultimately, I couldn't be happier with this TV and with the $500 or more dollars I saved compared to similar sets I was able to buy a great Blu-ray player and cables plus still have cash left over.", "Date": "December 14, 2008"}, {"Title": "Sharp LC52SB55U - Excellent Value!", "Author": "RamHawk", "ReviewID": "R1YWN7ASZOYDWB", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I purchased this TV from B&M; Best Buy for $1,199 + 4 yr Black Tie warranty ($99) + Free in-home calibration.  I price matched it against their own web site when it was $1,899 and their site had it for $1,299, then later I price matched it again when they added the free in-home calibration, price was reduced $1,000 and the warranty was $50 cheaper.  Yeah, I think it was a steal.  It was at the low end of my planned budget too so I couldn't have asked for a better deal.TV operation is great, excellent picture right out of the box with factory settings.  Lots of HDMI inputs, dolby digital optical audio output (passthrough) so all my devices are in high definition with digital audio.  Xbox 360 (HDMI), DVD player (HDMI), cable box (HDMI), etc..  The contrast ratio isn't that great but you can't hardly notice it... and for the price I didn't care.  I wanted a solid performer with a good picture.  That's what I got.  Discovery Channel, Xbox 360 games, and upconverting DVDs look great.  Sports and games play great and I don't see any pixilation or screen ripping.", "Date": "February 13, 2009"}, {"Title": "Awesome TV", "Author": "Scott T. Strachan \"scott\"", "ReviewID": "R32OI4JX4A50NO", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Awesome, 11/13/2009For the price and features of this set it is great. It is leaps and bounds beyond the \"old\" tube style tv it replaced. So many input ports, the picture is great, its sleek and huge. I was a bit disappointed that out of the box it didnt pick up any broadcast digital signals. After buying a digital antenna I only get 2 somewhat well. I'm debating getting the hd cable package because I find myself watching shows I hate on the CW just to watch them in hi def. I read complaints on the sound with this set that are a little weak in my opinion. This is because I dont really expect theater sound from a tv set and it seems like many of them were just set up issues. I didnt experience any of these sound problems. Its funny in the store sometimes they will discreetly have tv's and smaller stereos hooked up to a sub woofer which is a little misleading. I dont think this is the case at walmart but I have definitely noticed other places doing this.-Update: After disconnecting my cable box I realized all of the broadcast Hi-Def signals came in great. I guess my cable box was blocking their reception(HMMMMM).", "Date": "November 13, 2009"}, {"Title": "TV: Outstanding $/quality, Delivery: Terrible", "Author": "Martinez O.", "ReviewID": "R101CZ45F288CC", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "company provided a great product, delivery was terrible.  Delivery company contacted me and scheduled a morning drop off, waited all morning and afternoon, finally i called to find out if they were even coming and apparently the driver lied and said he spoke to me and rescheduled the delivery for late afternoon.  I never recieved a phone call or spoke to anyone.  Important part is that i finally recieved the TV, the bad is that i took off from work and spent all day waiting.", "Date": "January 2, 2010"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "Unavailable", "Features": "52\" HDTV LCD-TV with Full HD 1080p Resolution\n10,000:1 Dynamic Contrast Ratio\nBuilt-in ATSC / QAM / NTSC Tuners for DTV and analog TV viewing\n4 HDMI Inputs for convenient connection to digital devices\nPC Input conveniently turns your TV into a PC monitor", "Name": "Sharp LC52SB55U 52-Inch 1080p LCD HDTV", "ImgURL": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/318fcFkQjAL.jpg", "ProductID": "B001BYS6PK"}}
