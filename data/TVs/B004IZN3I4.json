{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Not bad, but there are a ton of better options", "Author": "V. Yalung", "ReviewID": "RC5JJVPZWSQZ4", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I bought this TV at Sears a few months ago for my bedroom, when they had it on sale for about 500 dollars. I thought at the time that 500 bucks (+tax) was a good deal on the relatively new LED technology, and the guy who worked there sold me on the fact that it takes about 1/4 the amount of electricity that my Vizio plasma uses. However, I later found that for a bit more, I can get quality name brands online, like the Panasonic that I recently bought and reviewed on Amazon.I saw this on gold box today, and I thought I would let people know what they are getting, so here it is- first, you are getting a bare bones TV that is okay to watch on. The picture is actually pretty nice, when compared to older LCDs, and almost comparable to my favorite screen, the plasma. The picture is not as rich as plasma, but definitely more natural looking than the older 60hz lcds.Anyway, here's the skinny:It has 3 HDMI inputs, which is nice, even for a living room set, and more than enough for use as a bedroom TV. There is also a PC connection so you can use it as a computer monitor, but I have yet to try that. It is VERY lightweight, compared to my 42 inch plasma, and most people will be able to mount it on their walls without the help of a second person. The picture, as I have said is very nice, when compared to other TV's in this price range, but it is a bit on the dim side. When setting the brightness higher, you will notice some \"flashlight effect,\" if you're really paying attention, but most people looking at a cheap TV probably won't even notice, or mind too much. There aren't all the cool \"new for 2011\" features that most TV's have these days, like internet and Netflix, but if you connect your XBox or PS3 to the set, or a internet capable Bluray, it won't really matter. I wouldn't really consider this a good buy, only because the name brand is generic and you never know what kind of service and reliability you'll get from a company that sells discount (read:cheap) electronics, and if you just spent a hundred dollars or so more, you can get something that may last you quite a while. But, if you don't have the bread to spend, you want to get a TV with great picture and don't mind not having all the bells and whistles, I'll guess you'll be okay with this one. Just don't forget to find a cheap warranty, maybe at Costco or something.*Update 12-16*I uploaded some pictures to demonstrate the flashlight effect that I mentioned in my review, and to give some alternate views of this set, because there aren't any other pics of this TV anywhere on the web. I don't understand why people think that what I've written is unhelpful, but I've tried to be thorough and objective in writing about a TV that I think is a good value, but could be improved. If you ask me a question, I'd be happy to help you make a decision.", "Date": "November 5, 2011"}, {"Title": "Great Value LED", "Author": "Anthony", "ReviewID": "R1DDHG2FSLMCWH", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I got this TV on sale via Amazon Lightning Deals. It is definitely worth a 400 price tag. The speakers can be loud, but obviously with this thin TV, don't expect any bass. The picture looks great on this LED, and I personally didn't notice any edge bleeding while watching X-men Origin in blu-ray. If you see this item go on sale, snatch it up! However, I'd have to say it's only mediocre at its normal price. Not bad, but for a few more $$$, you could get a name brand. All in all though, I'm happy with this TV.Unfortunately, this TV does not has any analog sound output. Only digital coax and TOSLINK. So if you want to hook up speakers without a receiver, you'll need a digital converter. However, if you have a receiver with coax/TOSLINK, the coax or TOSLINK output on the TV will work just fine. Not worth deducting a star on, since this seems to be the way all TV's are headed(digital). Just a heads up, as I was disappointed when I saw no headphone jack or RCA outputs.", "Date": "November 30, 2011"}, {"Title": "Lit up my room for dark scenes", "Author": "Jermaine Stewart \"stewy_gt\"", "ReviewID": "R1T4AIHREUBGQV", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "Pros:- Great picture quality once the TV warms up (takes about 15 seconds).- Speakers are perfectly usable as-is and loud enough.- Nice, slim design (thick bezel though).Cons:- Absolutely horrible flashlight effect.- Still see some amount of noise (not bad though) when watching HD content (watched RIO blu-ray with PS3).- USB connection is ONLY for servicing (manual states that it should not be used by end users).- Takes about 10 seconds between pressing the power button on the remote and seeing a picture.- All default color profiles were very off (not so bad as the settings can be changed to get acceptable colors).I must admit that I was skeptical about purchasing this TV due to reviews I read for other TVs for the company. However, I saw the TV on the Lightning deal and figured that the price was right. So I bought it as a gift for my girlfriend. After receiving the TV we set it up (just connect the base) that night and hooked up the PS3 with a blu-ray copy of RIO. While watching the movie, all I remembered hearing was \"No, this is not going to work.\" as my girlfriend watched with great disappointment. The flashlight effect was horrible. It looked as though there were four bright flashlights with the light coming from all four corners of the TV with the light almost extending all the way to the center to make an X. If that wasn't bad enough, there was some additional light coming from the top and bottom edge and a big horizontal blur of light that was half way between the center and the top of the TV. We could tolerate it for bright scenes even though the corner lights were clearly visible due to the black bars at the top and bottom of the picture (letter-boxing). However, darker scenes were just horrible. At one point the light from the top left corner was washing out the picture for such a colorful movie.As a gift that she wanted for a long time, this was not how I envisioned things turning out. I must admit that the picture quality (HD only, never checked SD) does look great, and the sound isn't an issue; plus the sound can easily be improved by connecting a good sound system. None of the default settings looked close to correct in color (I have other HDTVs, one of which was ISF calibrated). This would have been a good TV for the money (provided it lasts) if not for the poor lighting. I never expected it to be perfect, just acceptable. This one is going back.", "Date": "December 2, 2011"}, {"Title": "Great low budget LED TV (updated 7/24/2013)", "Author": "FireWynd \"FireWynd\"", "ReviewID": "R3FYNZMSLSJTXX", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Update July 24, 2013:1.5 years later and the TV is still solid. No problems. It see's ~2 hours of daily use on average. I re-read my original review and agree with everything I said when I posted the review. All the pros and cons are still applicable 2 years later. If it means much, it hasn't developed any new problems. Additionally none of the cons that I mentioned below have got worse. Very happy with the purchase.Original review from ~December 2011Picked up for $340 - an amazing price. The next closest (in price) 40\" LCD/LED TV we could find on Amazon was a LG w/ bad reviews for $500. We bought this as a hold me over TV for a the next few years. Figure with Apple TV coming out soon, that could revolutionize the TV industry. OLED and voice-enabled TVs, along with more internet integration are coming within the next few years. I couldn't justify buying a more expensive set that would become out-dated so quickly. So this TV fits the bill.Despite it's flaws, you get what you paid for. Seeing how this was almost 1/2 the price of any other 40\" TV on amazon, we knew what we were probably going to get as far as quality and was fine with that.PROS:-true 1080p-No dead pixels-Works-Nothing outstandingly bad-Amazing value (quality for price)-Lots of hookups (3x HDMI and it either had component or composite too). Also has an old VGA plugin (no DVI). This means if you don't have an AV Receiver, then you in good shape since you can probably hook all your devices to this. 3x HDMI gives you (for instance): 1x BD Player, 1x Xbox 360, 1x PS3. Anyhow this is more than enough for most households. Oh and it has an old school coax hookup for those of you with older cable boxes. Tested this and it works for us!Neutral:We have a nice Onkyo AV Receiver with a nice surround sound system. So we never even bothered trying out the sound on the TV.CONS:- Some flashlights in corners, the upper left and right being the worst. But it's not that bad. I've seen much worse and for a set at this price point - it's to be expected. You won't notice it at all in light scenes. In very dark scenes (like in Underworld), if you pay extremely close attention, you might notice it. Frankly, I don't notice it during movies. You can only really see it when you first turn on the TV and everything is black. Personally, this isn't a major issue. Worth mentioning for those of you who care.- Noise. The picture when you sit close looks has a lot of noise / static to it. This is not very noticeable on light scenes, but on dark scenes it can be very noticeable. The picture is still 1080p HD for sure, so it's not that. Just imagine taking a top end Samsung HDTV picture quality, and then add a bunch of noise to it. This is noise, _not_ pixelation (what happens in high compression JPEGs). If your thinking pixelation, then stop, because this is not that. The pixels are fine, it is true 1080p. There is a big difference between the two! If you ever played Mass Effect or Mass Effect 2 on PC/XBox 360/PS3, it is like the movie filter that you can turn on which adds a bunch of noise. It's pretty much exactly like that. It's not terrible. Again the picture is still 1080p HD w/ some added background noise. However this means you will _not_ get a clean, clear, crisp picture like on other more expensive sets. That said, you get what you paid for, and it isn't bad enough to ruin our movie watching experience. However we upgraded from a 36\" 480i CRT set. So compared to that, this thing is amazing. If you are coming from a high quality HDTV set to this, you would probably notice and it will probably really irritate you. For me, and for the price, I'm fine with it. If this is your first HDTV or your not a picture quality nazi, then this is a minor point.- Ghosting. On really fast scenes - you will see some ghosting. I was surprised to see ghosting since I thought I read that the response time was 5ms which is what you look for in computer monitors for gaming. But either that's a lie, or there's another problem. Anyhow watching Underworld (a very dark-scened vampire action movie with Kate Beckinsale) in the first 1/2 hour or so, it was only _really_ bad once. Still sucks though, and personally I find the ghosting much more distracting than the noise or flashlights. But considering the ghosting only lasted around 5-10 seconds out of 30 minutes, well I can get over that too for this price. But of the three problems, at least for me, this was by far the worst because it is very noticeable when it occurs. Oddly enough my wife didn't notice it, but it was very obvious to me.Bottom line:Has some flaws. But honestly, for $380 or ~1/2 price of competing HDTV sets - if you expected perfection, then your insane. You get what you pay for. If you want perfection, then I recommend you shell out the $800-900 for a 40\" LED Samsung set which is more than double what you would pay for this.I personally find the flash-lighting to be a non-issue. The noise I don't really find to be much of a problem either. The worst part of the set for me is the ghosting, because when ghosting happens - it's _very_ noticeable.Having said all that, I knew that for such a ridiculously low priced set, that the quality probably wasn't going to be amazing. I knew that going in and honestly, it pretty much meets expectations or possibly exceeds them. The extra hookups (not useful for us due to our AV receiver) was a big surprise for a low-priced set.Also LED and not LCD. This will up the resale value significantly. Our plan is to resell this on craigslist in a few years and shell out the $1000+ for a nice Samsung. Because this is LED and not LCD - the resale value of this set is significant. We expect to get most of our money back.I rate this highly for it's price point  / value - it delivers and honestly was even better than I was expecting. Had no problems hooking up to our AV receiver. Pass-through from our BD Player was just perfect. No major problems. I'm very happy with it.For those looking for perfection: Spend 2-3x more than this and buy a Samsung set. For those on a major budget, and therefore understand perfection isn't happening and are fine with that - this set is for you.", "Date": "December 17, 2011"}, {"Title": "Stay away", "Author": "Heat2012", "ReviewID": "R21Q8EUY2ZZZ0J", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I purchased this TV as a xmas gift for my girlfriend in a November lightning deal. What a mistake. The box this TV is shipped in was so weak, I noticed gashes on the sides with no foam support. I immediately opened the box to find that the screen had in fact been scratched. Amazon took care of it no problem and I was able to get another one before xmas.After my girlfriend finally sets up the TV in January, that is when I notice the other problems. I know for the $400 price I paid, I wasn't going to get the greatest quality TV, but I wasn't expecting this. Pretty much all the problems everyone else is talking about. No matter what you do to the settings, the picture never looks remotely right. The four lamps create excessive bleeding on the corners. The volume is limited, but it honestly did not bother me as much it seems to everyone else. I felt very guilty in having given this piece of crap as a gift. Even if my gf was more optimistic about it than me. I think she just liked the idea of owning a big LED TV. Until 5 months later.One night, the TV just crapped out on her. She was watching something and bam, audio but no video whatsoever. I came over to verify and there was nothing I could do. The TV would turn on, but the screen had burnt out. After 5 months of minimal use! We spend more time at my place watching TV on my 5 year old Sony, and this thing couldn't even make it to half a year.You think, okay, Coby should have some warranty to cover this. Don't bother. Their warranty only last 90 days. After that you have to pay almost $100 in shipping and labor fees. What a joke. I refused to pay an extra $100 that could have gone to a better TV.I went to my last resort, Amazon. Once again, Amazon's exceptional customer service really came through. Who else would let me return a TV purchased in November for almost a full refund? It is this kind of service that keeps me coming back.I know there are quite a few people defending this TV.

I own many different tv types from rear projection, crt, led, lcd, as well as plasmas. This Coby was going into my sons room, so it just needed to have an okay picture, not really expecting much. Well the picture was soo bad I had given up on it within 15 min.Pros:Price - CheapForm factor - Fairly thin but gets thicker in the center section still good thoughCons:Sound - Well it is bad but not really expecting much on an led tv, so you can ignore this con unless your used to other tv types. This didn't affect my rating.Picture - Flash lighting on all four corners! I had brightness turned all the way down and still it was unacceptable. Also this set has the worst clouding issue I have ever seen. When the picture goes even remotely dark, these bright patches of light bleed all over the screen. This alone is grounds for return. And if that isn't bad enough there is a major noise issue with any content. I had the same channel going to this tv and my Samsung lcd and it was like night and day. There were all sorts of artifacts and noise that weren't present in the Samsung. And there are not enough adjustments to make the picture even halfway decent. I didn't even have enough time with the set to check on ghosting but I'm sure that was there too. It didn't matter if it was standard or high definition, the picture was just bad.Summary: I understand this is not a high end tv but it isn't even worth it at the low price its at now. What good is a tv that's unwatchable? Coming from somebody who knows what a good tv picture should look like please stay away from this set.

Derrick \"TCDerrick\"", "ReviewID": "R2ETILGCE3A4NB", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I bought this TV (40\" 4026) with low expectations AFTER reading the reviews, but loved the $299 price point for a 3rd TV for the bedroom.  I own 2 Panasonic Viera Plasma's ('07 50\" and '11 60\"), so I know what an HDTV should look like. I even asked myself \"How bad could it really be?\". I now have my answer, bad.What I liked:Price ($299 when purchased, $465 at time of review, sooo...).  Picture is nice in bright scenes. Light, thin and easy to mount.  Plenty of connection options.Here are my 2 major issues that are grounds for returning:Flashlight Effect: If the ambient light is bright, it is hard to notice, but can still see light bleeding in from the four corners in dark scenes.  When the ambient room light is dark (how we mostly watch it), it becomes noticable in most scenes and truly obnoxious in dark scenes.  It's not just the four corners, but light blotches all over the outer portions of the top and bottom of the screen.  I tried ALL different settings, nothing worked.  Would have thought the product was simply defective had I not read other reviews.Screen Dimming:  Every time you turn off the TV, it resets itself to an \"Energy Saving\" mode. When you turn the TV back on, you have to cycle through the screen modes until you notice the brightness return, and then set the TV to which mode you want (cinema, vivid, custom etc.).  I use a universal remote, which compounds the annoyance factor.  I called Coby USA, and the rep said \"that's just how the TV works\"...really?Minor Issues:Nobody has pointed this out, and I didn't notice a problem with the refresh rate, but the title and product comparison chart says \"120Hz\", yet the product description and actual refresh rate is 60Hz.  False advertising?Sound is sub-par, but hooked it up to a sound bar.  Connections don't seem sturdy.

I bought it as my 2 year old LCD started getting a shadow & my father owns a LED which was very nice and 3d like- I don't know if I got a faulty one but on a darker screen it illuminates brighter light of white around the edges of the tv making it annoying to watch any \"dark\" movie (I don't know if this is broken or just the way it is) also the tv is not 3d like at all, it has a pretty good picture but really no better then my LCD has shown. I was expecting more and like I said may have a faulty one, I plan on calling the company about this light issue, but am angry I have to do that on a new purchase & get worried this may just be a crappy tv. Guess you get what you you pay for. And finding the warranty from Coby, yeah not as easy, I also purchased the square trade 3 year warranty so we will see if this works! Anticipating a lot of headaches!***********UPDATE VERY IMPORTANT TO PAST & FUTURE PURCHASE*********** 5/31/12ok so I returned my old tv as the colby company wanted to repair it and the squaretrade warranty wasnt in effect till a year (arg) I was angry to get a repair on a new tv told amazon & they were awesome & just sent me a new one- now here is the thing- the new tv they sent the so called same replacement they sent was different, this new tv on the back mounting area only had small screw holes for mounting when my original one had these screw plugs then you can put in the screws and the new tv screen was a bit more matte then the original screen- THE NEW ONE IS 110% BETTER in every way!! This new tv picture is so much more crisp and clear then the other one and so far does not have the annoying bright light bleeding around the edges. It does seem to take some time to \"warm up\" but I do not mind that at all, and I can't comment on the sound other people do because I do have a sound system, but I think I could tolerate the original sound even though it is not that great nor that bad.So my findings show that if you own the 46\"led that has the screw plug inserts instead of just a flat mount with screw holes is you got screwed too!!!! It must be an older model and I would return it, the difference is amazing and this is wrong for coby to do I don't get it but we got lucky on getting this other same different tv sent to us. If anything breaks I will update again. Good luck consumers.The fact is this TV is still not all that good- I would never ever buy it again and if I didnt spend so much time on the phone with coby, amazon & the warranty square trade and paid such a small amount for a 46\" I would have thrown the damn thing out the window & let my dogs pee on it. spend the extra 100 or so- I am sure it will be worth it in the end, plus I am sure I will be going through the same thing in a few months when something breaks on it.", "Date": "May 26, 2012"}, {"Title": "Not bad for a bedroom TV", "Author": "R T L", "ReviewID": "RIP0EJKUML9Y3", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "We went from a 32\" tube to this, so you can imagine how much better this unit is compared to the one I was using.

I regret it now. A television is supposed to last you and your family many years of good memories....therefore, skip this television. It turns on, PS3 to HDMI connects, and the TV works but the overall quality is just bad.The blacks on this television is horrible. During scenes where there is darkness and light, like a movie character or a videogame character is in a dungeon with no light, it's hard to see unless you shoot up the brightness, but once the scene reaches a place with light, it's too bright. So an easier way to think of it is: the black doesn't balance well with color. The black is just too black.Another issue is the lights on the corners of the screen. The lights are used to light up the screen, but on the corner's they are very bright and it dims as is it nears the center. The corner of the screen should not be brighter than the rest of the screen. It's annoying to look at.Another issue is the sound. It sounds like a baby lion trying to roar like his father. The TV has a weak sound and when volume is turned up, there's a muffled sound to it, like the volume is too powerful for the TV's built in stereo to handle. The TV can't handle it's own sound limit and I never turn it up past 55 percent of the way. Standard definition televisions have better sound.Blu Ray and DVDs don't seem much different on this TV. Once we switched to a Samsung, the difference between Blu Ray and DVDs was crazy!! It seemed like you were the cameraman watching the actors in front of you....Our standard definition TV has lasted us 15 years and it's still running great. This Coby LED TV lasted us 2 years before we gave it to a local thrift store. The quality is so bad that I don't feel like watching anything or playing videogames on it. Spend some more and get a better quality television. I was being cheap and thought all LED TV's would be good, but I was wrong.

I would not buy this TV as my main TV. I put it in a bedroom so it is much easier for me to deal with its quirks and imperfections as I am not watching this set the most in my home. It has a good picture (if left in energy saving mode) and poor sound quality. At least on my set, if you change the picture settings in any way off of Energy Saving mode the next time you turn it on the LEDs will not light up and the picture will be so dim you can hardly see it. The LEDs come back on if you change back to energy saving mode and will come on the next time you power on the set if you leave it in this mode. The sound is not good but did not expect much from the speakers on a TV this cheap. It is \"listenable\" at least where you can at least understand dialog, etc. Other issues are the pretty bad \"flashlight\" effect in all four corners from the LEDs but only looks really bad on a very dark or black screen. Standard def programming is close to unwatchable I have noticed on this TV and even HD programming has some \"ghosting\" in some faster motion scenes. Again, both of these issues are tolerable for the shorter periods of time I use this set.I orginally bought this TV as a Christmas gift for my girlfriend's parents as they do not have an HD TV yet. I wanted another for my bedroom anyway so thought I'd try this TV out for a bit first to see if it was good enough to use as a gift for them. I found that it is not good enough for them to use as a main TV and we will be purchasing a slightly more expensive, but better name and quality TV for them for Christmas and I am keeping this cheapo in my bedroom.Hope this was helpful.", "Date": "November 29, 2012"}, {"Title": "TV", "Author": "Lori D Morris", "ReviewID": "R1WY64QVUIWBNG", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Wonderful purchase will do business in the future.

Here's what I've noticed- The flash lighting others mentioned isn't bad, and had people here not mentioned it, I probably would not have known to look for it or noticed it.- If you expect to watch anything but the news, you will want to get a decent pair of speakers.  The built in speakers are at best equal to that of a clock radio, with the fidelity of a mobile phone playing music  The trouble is without an analog audio output your choices are limited to something that will accept an optical digital input - or using the controllable outputs of a cable, satellite or antenna box.- Via HDMI, I could not get the 1920x1080 resolution from my laptop to display properly without some scaling, stretching or overscan.- There is a curious amount of automatic contrast/noise-reduction processing going on that at times make flesh tones look very pasty and blurry.  On screen graphics, like those shown when watching a weather report appear very sharp, but as soon as a person appears their face and exposed fleshtones look very blurry and blocky.- The \"video noise reduction\" setting was always greyed out when using HDMI inputs- The TV does have settings for overscan, stretch/zoom adjustment, and dynamic contrast.- The TV does take 5-6 seconds to turn on.  The blue light blinks briefly and gets brighter when it is being switched on.  A message that says \"Powering off....\" or similar appears momentarily before the TV turns off.- The remote control is actually very nicely designed and does not look like a generic remote, but some of the commands are not debounced properly which makes accidental \"double-clicking\" very easy.- The LED backlight is, very bright, which makes this TV great for bright, sunny locations like a kitchen.If only COBY would address as many of the above issues as they can in a firmware upgrade (there is a USB service port on the side), this would probably merit the $400+ non-sale price.", "Date": "December 24, 2011"}, {"Title": "2nd Defective unit received - DO NOT PURCHASE", "Author": "FGC \"Frank\"", "ReviewID": "R38ONNJ6KB0QU7", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "UPDATE: This is unit #4.

I got it to use as a 40\" virtual pinball playfield for my pinball cabinet. I must say, it looks and plays spectacular. Over 100 full screen pinball tables in 1080P resolution.My only gripe about the set is that it does not power on automatically when the PC boots up. You have to use the remote control to power it on, which is a bit of a pain.Oh yea, the company that packed it up and shipped it did a horrible job. The stand, remote and wires were all loose in the box and banging around.

The first thing you need to know is that it's wobbly. The TV is connected to the stand at a single point by a single screw. I screwed it in quite snugly, but the TV still wobbles for a good 5 seconds if you adjust it at all. Considering that the stand is supposed to hold that thing up for multiple years, that is very worrying out of the box.The second thing you need to know is that the sound quality is *terrible.* We plugged in our 360 and at half volume the sounds the console made while we navigated through the menu were distorted and shrill. Turning it down fixed it, but the simple fact is that even when the bass setting was at max, there was literally no bass at all in the TV, making everything sound tinny and hollow. Worse yet, the only audio output it has is coaxial digital out.So because of the awful sound quality, we went out and purchased a $139 audio system to get a usable setup. During the process of moving it, we had to (VERY GENTLY) reposition the TV and unplug it. After we installed everything and plugged it back in, we started everything up... only to discover that the TV would no longer start up.
