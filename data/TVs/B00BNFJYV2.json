This Tv is a good appliance all around. Upon of initial use I was a bit disappointed with the picture but after playing several blurays and adjusting the settings, I must say this tv is worth its price and then some.  Had one concern after playing with it at first, the tv was showing the refresh rate as 60hz after pressing the info button on the remote. Called hitachi customer service and they inform me that 60hz is what cable/antenna renders. Did some digging and found out that it was true and that the tv with 120hz or above will create an effect to duplicate frames.Only had it for a week and happy with it so far. Hope the review helps, could hardly find a review on the tv online.", "Date": "October 7, 2013"}, {"Title": "Excellent Picture & Features..", "Author": "Thomas Vattamakal", "ReviewID": "R2PUTLQ0V9F2JM", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This may be too early to comment b'cus I just got it yesterday and installed today, but the picture quality is crystal sharp and nice user-friendly features too.  I have only connected a DVD player & Roku.  They work so beautiful.  Even the local channels I get by a rabbit-ear antenna (I don't have cable) are super sharp.  Very happy with the product.  I would recomment this to anyone.Tom V", "Date": "September 28, 2013"}, {"Title": "Very good buy!", "Author": "Gregory Arnold", "ReviewID": "R13TKC4DIZWKDV", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Great picture for the money. The only issue that I have is the volume. Even when turned up all the way it isn't very loud. So I bought a sound bar with the savings and I am very happy with it now. And the sound bar sounds better than normal TV speakers anyway!", "Date": "November 4, 2013"}, {"Title": "Outstanding picture", "Author": "Lcole48", "ReviewID": "R8QW0MT66SPEO", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I bought this to replace a 42\" Panasonic Plasma and was very used to the quality of a plasma set. This LED set has all the picture quality, shading, and detail and even more than my plasma. I've been very pleased with it. I found the default settings work fine. Cable TV is broadcast in 1080i at 60Hz and the picture is fine on this set. DVD display is 1080p or 24p and 120Hz and the performance is outstanding. My seating area is just large enough to accommodate the 55\".", "Date": "January 6, 2014"}, {"Title": "Im Happy", "Author": "Doreen Jeanneret", "ReviewID": "R2RKIRE1A7PRB1", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "The purchase was well within reason .
