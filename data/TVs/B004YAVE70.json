{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Picture is Great, Sound is just OK", "Author": "HR", "ReviewID": "R3TQXIZWAVBDHT", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I bought this TV and installed it on a kitchen wall about 15 feet away from my large Sony living room TV two weeks ago. The picture is great, but I would compare the sound to that of a radio, instead of a stereo. I have this TV running off of a splitter from my DVR that is connected to the Sony in the living room. When I have both of my TV's on at one time (which is a lot), I am mostly keeping the Vizio on mute. The sound of the two TV's on at one time seems distorted. The Sony sound is very rich, while the Vizio is not. I can understand why sound bars are a must with a lot of flat screens. This is a great auxilary TV for a bedroom, den, or kitchen. For less than $200, it's a good deal. When I am working in the kitchen and just have the Vizio sound on, it's acceptable, but still not the quality of my nine year old Sony.Programming tip: If you are going to connect it to a DVR, first disconnect the DVR and run your \"in\" cable directly to the TV (without the DVR in the loop). Go thru the initial channel programming and let it \"auto run\" to find the channels. When that is finished, then plug it into the DVR and it should be ready to go.", "Date": "June 15, 2011"}, {"Title": "5 star quality for the picture; 4 for the sound", "Author": "Reginald D.

This handles blacks & whites very well & overall picture is wonderful.I love the buttonless touch controls on the bezel & the many ports on the rear of the TV.My only dislike of this TV is the sound. I'm not an audiophile but if I had to toss a term, I'd say the sound was thin. The good news is, is you can toggle the settings just enough to get a good experience out of it, just not great.All in all, its a great HDTV, delivering a great 1080p experience, that is at a great price, without sucking up great power to do it.Buyer's remorse?

It's light wt, and has connectivity ports for about everything a person can imagine.  The sound suffers from the thin design but improves when sound can bounce off a wall or corner, etc.  If one turns off the SRS TruSound HD, the sound improves greatly.  I have it attached to a VideoSecu Articulating TV Wall Mount Bracket for VESA 100 LCD LED Flat Screen Monitor TV 1E9. The mount is super for a room like the kitchen where is gets use daily.  TV source is AT&T; U-verse.A great energy efficient HDTV system at a good price.

But after receiving this TV and setting it up no mater what I did I could not get a clear picture. The colors seemed to bleed it was either too red or too green. The sound was terrible, sort of wavering in and out. We have Verizon Fios so the poor picture quality was not due to a miss placed antenna. It was very blurry, I couldn't adjust the contrast or sharpness to clear it up. The 20 year old set that I was replacing had a better picture. So I gave up and sent it back to Amazon, kudos to Amazon for their 30 day return policy. I ordered the Panasonic Panasonic VIERA TC-L32C3 32-Inch 720p LCD HDTV and I am happy to say that it is great.", "Date": "September 16, 2011"}, {"Title": "Nice Picture, Tinny Sound", "Author": "Dan Zeitlin \"Radio Addict\"", "ReviewID": "R1EKT48A44J0RW", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "This model was on sale at a local store at a very good price, so my wife and I went there and spent about 30 minutes with the set.  It's physically very clean and attractive.  The picture was quite good and there was a large range of adjustment that should suit most people.However, we I found the sound exceptionally tinny.  The audio settings in the menu allow only for a selection from several fixed presets labed \"Jazz\", \"Classical\", \"Rock\", etc.  There is no direct bass-treble adjustment or equalizer.  We tried all the audio settings and none of them fixed the tinny sound.  I'm guessing the built-in speakers are just too small and/or cheap.  In any event, the sound was a deal breaker for us.  I have no intention of buying speakers in addition to the TV.  I'd advise staying away from this model unless you already have or intend to add external speakers.FWIW, the best sound we found in the 19\" and 22\" TV sets in the store was in the JVC models. They sounded good and had a versatile set of adjustments in the sound menu.", "Date": "August 21, 2011"}, {"Title": "Great potential, falls short", "Author": "Jason P", "ReviewID": "RGI8480PKP3R1", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I Purchased this set to do triple duty as a monitor, bedroom tv, and game console monitor.  On paper if fulfilled all requirements and had all necessary connectivity and then some.  Unpacking and assembly went smoothly and the design of the unit and base was great.  From this point forward the praise stops.  As stated in other reviews, the speakers had a tinny quality to them.  I can't expect much from a 22\" TV/Monitor but I was underwhelmed.  When hooked up via HDMI to my game console there was a strange quality to the picture - it looked noisy or had artifact present.  The worst part was the light bleed at the edges.  Any medium-dark scene or darker had a 1\" wide \"bar\" of light bleed.  It was there for games, television, dvd playback, or netflix.  For me that was the deal breaker and it went back.  I purchased a similarly sized Samsung edge lit set for $30 more and am much happier.", "Date": "January 10, 2012"}, {"Title": "Great TV for the price, but a design flaw or two.", "Author": "J. T. OBrien \"MidnightJT0_v2\"", "ReviewID": "RZHP6BCC58ABF", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I'm not going to give the long tech version of a review. Bought this to replace a computer screen and also connect DirecTv so it serves dual purpose in the family room. Video looks good for the size. Off-angle viewing isnt recommended unless the off angle is straight on high or low. If you're viewing from the side you'll be disappointed. Audio is good as well. Couple flaws would be that the TV doesn't always register a signal from the device if the TV is turned on after say the DirecTv box. Its annoying, but not a deal breaker. The on-screen / touch interface controls are a little awkward. Remote is the best way to control, but the last complaint I have is with the functionality of the remote. It's not an easy press, sometimes you have to consciously press hard in a certain area to get the key stroke in. Again, annoying but not a deal breaker. It serves the purpose at a great price. Definitely say I am considering a VIZIO for my next big screen purchase, but it's not automatic as Panasonic holds the crown in my house.", "Date": "November 8, 2011"}, {"Title": "Great TV", "Author": "Nathaniel Grier", "ReviewID": "RDJ8COOQS1WX3", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "My son bought this TV for his birthday and it's a great tv all around.

It blows away the two similar sized Samsung TV/monitors that I already had.  Really nice features like the touch bezel controls so you don't have a bunch of buttons on the front.  Detailed menu system is very easy to navigate.  Picture is Fantastic!  Sound is very good I don't know why others complained about it?  A couple of minor issues like the lag between TV channel changes is a bit longer than I would like, remote sensor is on the lower right corner and didn't think my remote worked until I pointed it at the lower right corner.  Very well designed TV and even the packaging was really well done.  I was pleasantly surprised with my first Vizio purchase and will consider them for future purchases.  Glad I saved money and bought this TV/monitor.  Very crisp images on OTA TV, PC, HDMI, and even composite input.  Nice to see this one has composite and component inputs for some of your older gear.  USB Slideshow works really well and my Photos look awesome on it.  Would have been nice if they would have built mp3 sound into slideshow but I guess I'm being greedy now on a budget line product.  Kudos to Vizio on a stellar product. Styling is very nice looking and looks better than photos on site.
