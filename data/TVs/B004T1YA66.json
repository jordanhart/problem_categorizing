Skorzak", "ReviewID": "RT264C9TF5M7Q", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I think it took me longer to unpack it and attach the stand than it did to hook it up and have it running. I connected it to my DirecTV HD box via HDMI and it delivers a clear, bright and brillint picture - note, the DirectTV has the Vizio codes needed to program their remote to this TV so you may use that for on, off, volume, channels. The viewing angles are very broad, I have it in the kitchen and as much as I move around I have not yet been in a position where the picture fades. The stand is not adjustable but sitting on top of the HD box the picure is not distorted or fading whether I am standing to prep and cook a meal or sitting down to eat.I have no problem with the sound, it is clear and full without using any external speakers, sound bar, etc. I have not had the fainest problem with the sound being tinny as you may expect or experience with this smaller class of TV's. Although I did not need or use them, there are several adjustments available via the on-screen menu display for different sound options including Tru-Sound, SRS Surround Sound or customizing to your own choosing.The only issue that one may have could be a lag in the TV turning on/off, there seems to be a slight few second delay. I really don't feel that to be an issue so much with this TV as it could be with the connections between the TV and the DirecTV functions. I had the same delay in on/off with the old Sylvania CRT TV this replaced, and still experience it with the Magnavox CRT TV I have in the bedroom connected to a DirecTV box as well as the 32\" Vizio HDTV I have in the Living Room with an HDMI connection to the DirecTV.Overall, I feel this is a great quality TV, and you simply can't find a better price than right here at Amazon.", "Date": "September 11, 2011"}, {"Title": "great tv", "Author": "Patrick A.

I use to depend on them for very competive pricing but during my Christmas shopping I found several glaring exceptions. This Vizio (EV-190VA is another example. Wal-Mart previously sold this TV for $178. Now is it $158! What is wrong with you Amazon? $244.99! That is more than free shipping can compensate for.

It is also small and light enough where I can keep this TV on my desk while using my computer or turn it if I want to lay in bed and watch a movie.  I can't vouch for how long it lasts, because I have only had it for a month or so, but I did buy it used and it is still working great.All in all, this is a great simple little TV.

Had to quickly buy an hdmi cable separately (app. $27).  Only needed a 3 ft. hdmi cable to connect from back of the cable box to the Vizio TV, reducing the \"cable jungle\" behind the TV, a plus.  Would have been nice if an hdmi cable (or two, of different lengths) came with the TV, at lesser extra cost to Vizio and to the TV's buyer.  Very pleased with this Vizio TV.

I have been searching for the ideal small screen TV, read many, many reviews and decided on this Vizio (E190VA). I purchased four (4), they support my security system and normal viewing at four different locations. They produce outstanding video and audio via my security cameras. Using the split screen x2 or x4 has very little negative effect on the images produced. I also use 2 of them for my photo editing projects. My wife enjoys watching our GreatGrandchildren playing in the backyard while viewing her cooking shows on TV in the kitchen. All four have the capability to switch back and forth between security monitoring and normal TV and/or videos. Three are mounted on the walls to keep from taking valuable table space.

I personnally recommend this HDTV to anyone that is interested in this size.Video from DVD, VCR, Digital Cameras, etc., is excellent.

Anyway, here's an indepth review.Picture clarity- 9.5/10Crisp, clear and customizable.I use this TV primarily for gaming so that I don't take up the 40\" and I have to say that the image clarity is really good. I played PS2, Wii, Xbox 360, Original Xbox, Dreamcast and PS3; and every console looks really nice on this screen. But there is a slight catch being that the viewing angle of this TV is a little strange. If you're viewing too low, the screen will appear dark with a shimmer, if you view too high, it looks very bright. So you have to view it at the right angle. Personally, this isn't really a problem considering the biggest problem would be viewing it from a laying position.Besides gaming, I also tested my Roku Player, regular TV and DVD. All to which I'll say still looks really good. My only problems with Roku was the fact that despite the TV's options to stretch or pan an image, some videos will come out cropped. This is probably because their native resolution was somewhere around 480i but the Roku only bumps up the quality while not messing with the resolution. Sadly, you'll have to deal with those videos if you watch them because you cannot stretch the image, so in essence, you lose about 4-6 inches of the screen.Features- 10/10Before I get into any of the main features of this TV, I want to speak on the TV's tuner. The TV works just as good as any tuner on a big TV and I got all my DTV channels. The only problem you'll run into with the tuner would be where the TV or HDTV antennae is positioned. Now, onto the features.I really liked the fact that this TV has so many connections. There's HDMI x2, component, AV, S-video, digital optical output, headphones jack, Aux, RF and USB. The usb connection will scan a usb device for photos so that you're able to see them using the TV's slideshow. This was kinda cool; but not really necessary. Unfortunately, the USB connection will only scan photos and I haven't gotten it to play music or videos.The Vizio Razor has a cool slim looking remote, but in addition to the remote design, it also has touch technology to access the menu. This means no more loud \"clicking sounds\" to adjust volume. I was particularly fond of this being that I'm a fan of tablets.The actual menu has a lot of options such as picture settings to adjust color, picture noise, color temperature or custom, there's audio settings featuring SRS trusound, truvolume or customizable sound with an equalizer. The equalizer was pretty decent. It lets you adjust the bass, treble and such, but I haven't used it much.There's also the autoprogramming which would be your tuner settings. There's a cool feature for the tuner being that it can tune in stereo, SAP or mono separately. Also, after scanning for channels, there's an option for scanning \"for new channels\" which means that whatever channel you previously had you'll keep but any new channels you find will be added. Most larger TV's or more expensive TV's don't have this feature. This TV features closed captioning, energy saving, language support and such. It just really features a lot of options.Design- 9/10I like the design. The TV is thin. It has a very slight bulkiness in the back where the connections are; but it's still very thin. It's also light.The one thing I didn't like about the TV would be it's AC adapter (which can be disconnected). The adapter just looks like a block with the \"Vizio\" logo.Sound- 9/10I've read some reviews on here that says the \"sound is bad\" and that couldn't be further away from the truth. The sound is customizable and if you leave it as default which would be \"flat\" then perhaps that's where the reviewers where coming from. However, being that this TV features SRS trusound and tru volume as well as an equalizer, I don't see any problems.One issue I found using this TV would be that at times if SRS trusound is turned on, the sound will echo and it is annoying. I thought it was my gaming consoles at first, but it happened with TV stations. I simply turned off the SRS trusound and problem solved.I wish it had a little more options to customize the sound, because my craptacular Dynex 19\" actually has a ton of sound options not found on this TV. Also, the sound is really loud. I found that turning the volume up to 4 or even 8 was sufficient. The volume goes up to 100. When using earphones, you have to tweak the sound because it can be really low requiring you to blast the volume. This doesn't happen when using headphones.Overall, this TV is a fantastic purchase. The picture clarity is great. The only downside would be the fact that the TV's 720p with 1080i max resolution. It's good for gaming. I play Battlefield, Call of Duty, Gears of War, God of war and such on it and it looks fine. PS2 games were a little questionable at times, but you have to play with the color. I bought mine for a little over 100 dollars and are happy with it.In comparison to Sony or Samsung, I'd say that the picture clarity is about on par but slightly less. Still, the images are crisp and clear with I believe 5ms response time. This TV's a must buy if you want quality at a price that's not going to break your pockets.Edit- Apparently this TV actually does 1080P.", "Date": "March 30, 2013"}, {"Title": "still good after a year", "Author": "james", "ReviewID": "R2QVFBAERKXKSC", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I bought this for my kids and it still works great (knock on wood) I only have Vizio tv's anyway, so I may be bias", "Date": "February 25, 2013"}, {"Title": "Love it!", "Author": "Barbara Greenhouse", "ReviewID": "R1Z924JOYP475U", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Great tv.

Like directly on the desk. I like my other one, it was propped up more so the picture was higher, my Blu-Ray player sits in front of this and sits right down in front of the tv's sensor.EDIT: I will also add now (because I already left feedback on them and new developments have happened), don't buy from Quick Ship Electronics. I purchased my tv from them (used), I'm fine with used and refurbished. What I was not thrilled with was having to return it for a new one because the coaxial input was broke. Then I got the new one.
