A couple of pros: This is the nicest looking flat screen TV I have seen. The picture and sound are both fantastic, and I haven't even gone HD on it yet. However, within 30 minutes of owning it, I noticed a few problems.1. That little box in the picture where you plug in all your cables? I didn't realize that thing is the size of a cable box or DVD player. This is obviously my fault for not realizing the perspective of it in the picture, but I'm sure others will make the same mistake. I thought I'd be able to tuck it away somewhere. No can do. I've actually decided to put the TV on top of it, cause it is actually as wide or wider than the stand, contrary to what the picture would have you believe.2. This TV doesn't have a game mode because it is wireless. The wireless transmission to the TV causes a slight delay in seeing what you just did on your video game. For example, I have a Wii. After I roll a bowling ball down the lane, it takes about one second for me to see and hear it on the TV. So I need to move my Wii to my old TV, which is disappointing. This brings me to problem 3.3. You can plug just about anything into the wireless box, including an external hard drive through which you can pull up MP3's and photos on the TV, which is awesome, but you can't plug anything into the actual TV except the power cable, so there's just no way to solve the gaming problem. I bought it without planning to hang it on the wall. Other than the fact that it comes with a stand, it is completely meant to be hung on a wall.4. You kind of have to mash the buttons on the remote for a while before it does what you wanted. You can't just tap a button and the channel changes. You have to really get after it. I get the feeling that it's having to communicate back and forth with the box to get things done. This will probably be solved when I get a comcast box, but I'll still experience a delay.Other than those issues, it rocks. But if you're a gamer, I'd get a non-wireless LCD.", "Date": "July 24, 2008"}, {"Title": "Great technology purchase with no regrets", "Author": "C. Wade Britt \"DealCrzy\"", "ReviewID": "R2X2QBNB5BXO8L", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "If you are looking for a beautiful picture and sound, flexibility in placement, and WOW factor don't look past the Samsung FPT5094W.Purchased this TV at the end of June after having little luck finding much on the web other than the 4 reviews here on Amazon.  After I placed my order I did find 5 reviews on Bestbuy for the 58\" version of this TV which caused me to experience buyer's remorse while waiting for my TV to arrive. I'm happy to report that within an hour of the TV arriving and being setup, all regrets were quickly replaced with joy.  The picture on the set is beautiful.  I own 3 Panasonic plasmas in the 37\" to 42\" range and the picture is easily equal to if not better.  HD programming pops on the Samsung and during a 4th of July party we recieved comments from at least 30 people about how beautiful the picture was.Now the best part.  The wireless capabilities are incredible and allowed us to hang the TV over our fireplace which is on the opposite wall from our outlets.  We have our DirecTV HD DVR, OTA HDTV antenna and PS3 connected to the wireless AV unit stored away in a wooden cabinet approximately 17 feet from the TV.  Everything works like a charm...even with the doors closed.  Being cable free except for the power cord provides the ultimate in flexibility and looks.  We have experienced no issues with picture or sound quality with the wireless capabilities.  I have played games like MotorStorm and Resistance Fall of Man on the PS3 with output set to 1080P and everything looked and sounded perfect.  Personally I think the reviews on BestBuy were written by installers who are scared that this technology will take a bite out of their profits.  If I could make one improvement, it would be to allow any input in the picture-in-picture.  Currently it is limited to OTA antenna.If you are looking for a beautiful picture and sound, flexibility in placement, and WOW factor don't look past the Samsung FPT5094W.", "Date": "July 17, 2008"}, {"Title": "The cutting edge", "Author": "Roger A. Breton", "ReviewID": "RQ1P3ST3BMP73", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I had a few reservations like others who have reviewed this product, but after having it in my home for a week, I am completely sold on this remarkable TV.  All inputs for this television are in the set top box that broadcasts the video signal, the only cord you need to attach to the television is the power cord.  The picture is stunning in HD and almost as great with digital and analog broadcasts.  There are enough user settings built-in to satisfy demanding videophiles and still easy enough to use for your average technophobe.  Works like a champ with all my other A/V equipment, too.  I can't see any degradation in the picture due to the wireless connection. In comparing televisions in retail outlets this Samsung had a better picture than almost any other set available right now.  My reservations about getting something so advanced have been completely laid to rest.  This is the way television was meant to be.  It cost a little more than what I planned to spend when I started looking, but it turns out it was worth the extra expense and more.  What else can I say, I love this television!", "Date": "June 17, 2008"}, {"Title": "Don't buy", "Author": "M. Hamilton", "ReviewID": "R2HBT06E1P5X9K", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I bought this tv 2 weeks ago and have had issues with it since. Though the picture quality was great and the tv was nice looking, I experienced the following problems:1.You cannot play video games on it, because of the extreme delay between what you see on the tv and the gaming console.  The repairman said that if my xbox had hdmi this would be better, but he also said that about componet (which I'd tried) before I showed him that component didn't solve it either.2. After watching anything for about 15 minutes, the tv screen freezes and then connects with the wireless station, which takes about a minute and usually happens once every few hours. I should note that I plug my tv into a power strip, which I turn off each night to save energy, so if you leave your tv plugged in this may not be as much of an issue.3. The delay between the audio and video when plugged into a home theater is huge.  The setting on my reciever can delay the audio up to 100ms and even that is not quite enough.For my use, the technology simply isn't there yet, and I returned it yesterday.  Amazon was very helpful and gracious about the return, however, and I would not hesitate to buy from them again.", "Date": "August 17, 2008"}, {"Title": "Works great, Expensive", "Author": "John H.

Green \"efxGuy\"", "ReviewID": "R2K1YWZ4ZCZRCJ", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "So I have had it for 7 months now. See my earlier review below. I had the problem of Image break up and then losing signal. One tech didn't know what to do. The next Techs almost fixed the problem by changing two capacitors that were underpowered so they over heated. They gave up. The next new of the problem and said the entire boards in both the TV and transmitter would have to be replaced. A month has passed. Guess what. Samsung dropped wireless TVs. They have given up and are willing to make a full replacement with a PN 50A 650. To the ones who have it. There is a problem. If you get break of image contact Samsung. Also. Since I am in California I have noticed it occurs when the house is warm, say close to 80 degrees. If the room Temp is more like 68 then it only slightly happens or it takes 1.5 hours instead of 10 minutes. Sorry guys this TV is a Bust and Samsung knows it....................I see some of you are having the issues I am having. Love the look and idea of this TV. The delay well you can't get around it. I was told. \"It is not a gaming TV.\" I was told it was just the burn in problem.  But I never new about the delay. I rigged up my home theater and there was a delay. Then I got the manual and yes you have to plug your HDMI cables in and the audio has to come from the transmitter box to your amp. Works fine then.Now the big problem is that the image breaks up and then goes off and the TV looks for the transmitter again. The AC effects it. The phone effects it. At least that is the problem right now. The LOCAL samsung engineers found that there are 2 capacitors under powered and heat up. These need to be replace from a 10 watt to a 24watt. Well I thought this did it. For about an hour. Same problems. Today it was the wireless phone. Closer I got it basically didn't work at all. So far it's a useless TV. We shall see what happens in the next week. But if someone next door turns on a phone and it can screw your TV up that's a piece of junk that should have never been released. So far the Samsung people say ya so what. We'll see what we can do if not that's the way it is. I'm going to start to talk with Best Buy to see if they will give me something else. Yet my whole room is set up for a wireless TV. As in I'd need a 40' HDMI cable or tear the whole room apart again and through money down the drain.

Let me just start by saying that the television is AWESOME for watching television and DVDS/BDs.  I have it going through my Sony receiver, which has 4 HDMI inputs, and the ability to add audio delay.  Sooooo... that being said, I don not have the problem with not being able to connect enough devices to the tv.  I bought it for that very reason...I don't want a bunch of wires/cables goiing to the tv as it hangs on the wall!  So I have 3 HDMI devices going to the Sony receiver, and 1 HDMI output from the Sony to the tv transmitter...I never have to change the tv input device... just the receiver input device.  Now, add this all to the Harmony One remote and it works perfectly! I also don't have the problem with gaming delays because I simply don't hook the games (PS3, WII, 360) to the system...I use my 72-inch Samsung TV (which cost less initially on Amazon, now goes for 3,999.00)for that!!!!", "Date": "November 12, 2008"}, {"Title": "Major Problems  It is now discontinued", "Author": "M.

The video is sent wirelessly from a base unit. You plug all the cables into this base unit.I regret buying it because:1. It takes about 10 seconds to connect to the base unit every time you turn it on.2. Every a couple of hours or so, or at random times, it loses the video connection to the base unit, and it takes about 10 seconds to reconnect. During this time, you are missing your program or movie or whatever. Very annoying.3. It makes a buzzing sound that is very loud in my quiet bedroom at night.Next time I am buying a wired TV and probably not a plasma if they all make this buzzing noise.", "Date": "September 5, 2009"}, {"Title": "Awesome tv", "Author": "Charley D.
