{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Picture is really nice......", "Author": "Pam \"karotladee\"", "ReviewID": "R344HHA9OEUI5O", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "AOC L22H998 22-Inch 1080p LCD HDTVI've had this set for a week & bought it to replace a 3 yr old Westinghouse 19\" LCD set that went up. I use it in the bedroom & have gotten used to the rectangular shape & the 5 second screensaver when the set is first turned on. There is a toggle switch on the back that can be switched off so you don't have to live w/the tiny, amber-colored connection glow. The picture is nice for a 1080 of this size-It has full, 4:3 & movie scale settings that you can set while you watch instead of moving thru a menu. You can also zoom in while watching wide-screen DVDs. Depending on the channel you're watching, the HD can distort on the movie scale setting. There is a Stereo setting for audio however it sounds a bit tinny & not full sound-even w/the surround sound setting turned off.The manual is printed in English, Spanish & French & The English is written well. It has excellent hook-up illustrations & full explanations of remote receiver functions.The remote is easy to use & has a Electronic Program Guide, list & favorite channel functions along with a sleep & closed caption function. Menu functions allow you to set picture/audio quality, time & channel locks. The remote is not infra-red so it is useless to me as I use a HDMI hook-up to the cable box. I can/t pair the tv to my cable remote to control the volume or turn the tv off/on w/o the tv remote. The manual does state that the EPG & list functions are only accessible thru the DTV setting which is disappointing as I cannot access the closed caption setting either.I've decided to return this set as I don't want to use 2 remotes & am researching other brands.", "Date": "April 11, 2010"}, {"Title": "Great little TV for home gym...", "Author": "Shane Curtis Beise", "ReviewID": "RBAT3J4B01I0H", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Bought this to wall mount  on the wall of my 15 x 12 home gym. Got this, the swivel wall mount, and the materials to build a wall-mounted shelf below it all for under 250.  Most of these smaller LCD TVs  are made by similar companies.  This one is actually made by either Samsung or LG.  It changes between models and build date.  Both quality manufacturers though. Otherwise, easy to use, light, very good picture quality, and all for a great price.  The only small downfall is the sound, but I wasn't expecting much.  Just buy a cheap computer speaker system to hook it up to through the headphone jack in back of the unit.  So far so good...", "Date": "August 15, 2010"}, {"Title": "Pretty cool, but...", "Author": "J. Soto", "ReviewID": "R10AF5Z4H2KU4Y", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Pros:I love how this TV has so many inputs! I have my Nintendo Entertainment System connected through the coax input (and my VCR over the NES coax input), my Super Nintendo through composite (RCA) input, my Nintendo 64 through S-Video input, and my Nintendo Wii through component input. I also have a GameCube but the Wii plays those games too and there's no more input available (lol). I also use this TV as my 2nd display for my computer. It looks great through VGA (sadly, no DVI input in this TV). By the way, all my game machines are, of course, 240i (I think that's the resolution on the NES) to 480i and 480p, and they still look great on this 1080p television.Cons:My unit came with one highly burnt pixel (very noticeable over dark images), along with about 3 other burnt pixels around it that are hardly noticeable. But I can live with that. The sound is not so bad -- considering that computer monitors have worst sound quality and are lower in volume.Other:DO NOT buy this TV if you're planning on hooking up your PC through HDMI. The quality is so awful. However, I noticed that it has to do with how computers handle digital connections to TVs, so it's not the TV to blame for the awful quality. If you have an XBox 360 or PS3, I'm sure the HDMI quality will look beautiful. I've read online that ATI graphics cards have a fix to properly display HDMI from computer to TV, but I can't guarantee that since I have an Nvidia card and I've tried so many ways to fix the problem but never could succeed.-Kunou", "Date": "January 9, 2011"}, {"Title": "Functional, but lacking", "Author": "techguy123 \"rrpspider\"", "ReviewID": "R3US47Z0ZAJNGU", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "I bought this item to use an a computer monitor, attracted by the idea that it could double as a TV my computer room.  It does work (I use the HDMI input for the video from the computer), but I have two issue with the product:1 - Even when my computer goes into power standby and stops sending a video signal, the television does not seem to have an option to similarly power down.  It simply displays a message that says no video signal is present.  This may be normal for televisions doubling as computer monitors (I haven't really checked to see), but I was disappointed that I have to remember to pick up the remote control and turn the television off when leaving the computer.2- A bigger is is a potential quality issue.  When I recieved this monitor out of the box it has a bright blue pixel stuck on in the middle of the field of view, which was very distracting.  I requested a replacement which Amazon graciously provided.  I didn't notice any trouble with the replacement at first, but two days later it has what looks like a purple pixel stuck on.  It's not as bright at the stuck pixel on the first unit, and it's further toward the edge, but this is seems like a definite quality concern.", "Date": "April 24, 2011"}, {"Title": "Good TV for the price", "Author": "Q \"creaq\"", "ReviewID": "R1GHR2BTJ65FE7", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "When the box arrived, it was so damaged that we wondered how the TV itself fared.  We were pleasantly surprised when it came out of the box in excellent condition.  Simple, snap together stand was very easy to put together.  There is also the option to wall mount the TV if you purchase a wall mount kit.  I connected a VCR (through the tuner) and a Blu Ray DVD player (through the HDMI) to the TV and they both worked great.  There are also RCA and analog monitor connections available.  Quite a bit for a budget TV.  The picture is certainly sharp and acceptable.  The only problem I had with this TV is a single dead pixel in the upper right corner.  This TV is mostly used for playing movies in widescreen so the pixel is not really a big deal as it falls inside the black bar on the top.", "Date": "March 18, 2011"}, {"Title": "A SICK 22\" HDTV and Great for MEDIA CENTER", "Author": "J.

I have had AOC/Envision monitors for 5+ years and never any problems at all.Very good contrast and sharpness of the picture.
