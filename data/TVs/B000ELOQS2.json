It would seem that this might be the right time to jump into the HDTV craze.  Let the research begin then.  I'll get to the details of the Samsung unit itself after a brief, er, long background intro.I tend to be the type of consumer that will read every unbiased CR style review, online article, visit every store within a 100-mile radius and test every model in existence--no matter what the purchase.  This is particularly helpful when purchasing a television, since you really don't know just how good a picture will be, no matter what the specs say, until you see it side-by-side with the competition.I've been holding out for the $2000 price-point for a large-screen Flat HDTV, and the time has now come when there are several options from which to chose.  CR reports, quite accurately I might add, that Costco has some of the best prices among retailers, but I will say, as a HUGE Costco fan, that the selection is a bit limited, as is the nature of their business.After looking at about 50 (literally) different Flat-TV's, and originally wanting to go with a Plasma, I narrowed the choice to a 37-inch LCD from Viewsonic, a 42-inch LCD from Philips, and two 40-inch Samsung LCD units.  Consideration was made for size, picture quality, design and style, features, overall research and brand reputation/reviews, value, bang-for-the-buck and more.  Say what you will about Plasma, and they are beautiful, I've seen too many red-glow, distorted and burned pictures, and the last straw was a brand new floor model that had already gone bad in 2-weeks at a local store.  LCD it is then--I purchased the Viewsonic at Costco, only to receive a unit with a defective tuner, back to the store for a full refund--no worries.  As I'm strolling through the aisles of another establishment, I come across a vision of beauty, she looks amazingly like Liberace's reincarnated baby-grand piano.  She is brilliant in her little black dress, even standing next to the costliest supermodels from Pioneer and Sony--in fact, she may be more beautiful.  The Samsung LNS4051D they tell me.  Samsung name, 2 HDMI inputs, 4000:1 contrast ratio, PIP, you know the rest...and stunning good looks to boot!  But the cost was too high.  A few clicks later, I find her on Amazon for my target price, including shipping...S-O-O-O-L-D, says I!!  Return policy is a bit harsh, but delivery was on-time, and price was unbeatable.  Well done Amazon.Panasonic may hold a slight edge in overall picture quality, but Samsung is the world's largest producer of LCD screens, and they can be quite proud of this unit.A few areas for improvement--not even the most beautiful of ladies is perfect--blacks still need work, which is what keeps it from being the best-of-the-best, the remote needs work (don't they all), and once hung on the wall, the connections are nearly impossible to access, due to the back, rather than side connecting style.Flat HDTV prices are slated to continue falling over the summer, and will then flatten out--if you are lucky, you might just be able to snag a date with one of these hot little numbers, before they're all spoken for.", "Date": "June 9, 2006"}, {"Title": "Definitely feel like I made the right choice in HDTVs", "Author": "Lori H", "ReviewID": "RIF0PG5FLPPU8", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Like others, I took a long time before making the decision to finally purchase a large screen flat panel television.  Finally, with prices coming down so much, I decided to purchase one.  I bought this tv directly from Amazon.  They had an extremely competitive price, no sales tax, and were offering free delivery.  As has already been noted, that equated to hundreds of dollars of savings compared to purchasing the same tv at the local large outlet stores.  Initially, I narrowed my buying choices down to a 42\" Panasonic plasma that had been highly rated, Sony Bravia LCD, or the Samsung that I ended up purchasing.  First I chose LCD over the plasma for several reasons:  1. plasma is newer technology than LCDs, so has less of a track record as far as known durability and working life; 2. LCDs for the comparable size weigh less and because of the technology they use and construction materials tend to be more durable; 3. LCDs use less energy and do not have the same potential noise issues (buzzing) that plasmas can have; 4. no burn in issues; 5. much less screen glare with an LCD because the display panel is not a shiny sheet of glass;  and 6. prices of LCDs have dropped to be comparable to plasmas.  Also, in terms of viewing angle, LCD technology has caught up enough that plasmas no longer have an edge in that one.  Finally with regard to contrast ratios, although most definitely plasmas generally have much higher contrast ratios, both static and dynamic, most manufacturers inflate their numbers, oversell the importance of these numbers and measure under the most extreme conditions that consumers don't watch their tvs under.  Whether you care about contrast ratio really depends on the ambient lighting situation, in very very bright light conditions (i.e. sun light) you may be able to tell the difference between two tvs where one has a higher contrast ratio.  But under normal indoor conditions, and especially in a dark room, and watching programming that is not in 100% black and white (I mean when do you watch something like that?) the need for the higher contrast ratio wont even come into play and the viewer in a darkened room watching normal programming will notice no difference between tvs that have different contrast ratios.  Then after deciding to get an LCD I ended up choosing the Samsung over the Sony.  After physically looking at both tvs in the stores multiple times I thought that Samsung had the better picture.  And money wise Samsung was a better bargain for the quality of tv you got.As far as getting the tv, the delivery was a little delayed, and I was not all that impressed or happy with Amazon's shipper Eagle delivery service.  But hey, it was free, and when they did deliver it, it came in perfect condition.  Setting up the tv was easy, the main thing is to have the best connector cables (HDMI & component) and optimize, to the extent you can, the signal source to make sure you're getting the best picture out of the tv.  I have Comcast digital with a DVR, made sure to use HDMI connections (on that I didn't buy Monster, but an HDMI to DVI cable that cost a fifth of the price and works great also ordered from Amazon); and component cable for the DVD player.  Also made sure the output settings on the cable box were 1080i for HD broadcasts and 480p for standard definition broadcasts, and the DVD player set at 480p for progressive scan.  Picture looks beautiful.  HD channels are amazing in their clarity.  Even the standard definition programs look good on this tv.  I initially thought the sound was so so, but then used better RCA cables and it improved a lot.  Though, I have everything hooked up to a 5.1 surround sound system so don't really use the actual tv speakers much.  Overall I am very pleased with this television.  The picture quality is one of the best I've seen for the money.  The functions on the tv are easy to learn, the remote also was easy to pick up and just start using.  Also, the tv comes with plenty of inputs.  Though, I would have preferred if they had two component inputs instead of just one.  Finally, the tv physically  looks great, piano black, clean lines, a nice addition to the living room.  I highly recommend this tv.", "Date": "August 30, 2006"}, {"Title": "The best choice for the money", "Author": "P. Luciani", "ReviewID": "R784Y9O1UYHRZ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I purchased this tv back in June it has the best picture quality that ive seen in this price range i saved about $700 over circuit city hey no tax and no shipping cost. Just a note to Michael Barry from NYC who didnt like this tv. You have to have an HD signal coming into this tv first of all. Second call your cable company they should give you a HD coverter box, and spend the money on the HDMI cables (pricy but worth it, i paid $120 ea. and i needed two), i also bought a Monster clean power box to filter the signal and stop any further types of interferance. Your picture will look blurry and not clear if you just screw the coaxil cable into the back of this tv and watch non HD channels, in my area for example all of the major networks brodcast in HD and they still brodcast in analog to, for example ABC in the regular signal is channel 7 and to watch ABC in HD it's channel 707, my HD channels are in the 700's. These tv's are not like the old tv's we are use to when we just screwed the cable in the back and that was it. The HD signal is the fuel that makes these tv's go.", "Date": "September 2, 2006"}, {"Title": "Don't Hesitate on this one if you are moving from non-HDTV", "Author": "nasagolfer \"Michael\"", "ReviewID": "R2HO5AGQ3PA7IZ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "You really have to do your homework when you are moving into HDTV for the first time.  There are basically three types of technology out there; DLP, LCD, and Plasma.  I was so tempted to go all the way to DLP but I decided on LCD because of all the great reviews that it gets and because of the great look LCD's have in the store.  I also had a friend that had already invested in LCD over a year ago and his investment still looked great when we last watched a football game together.  Plasma was just out of the question because of past burn in issues.  DLP is still improving and is about one step away from resolving the light bulb replacement issue altogether.  When they get a permanent LED white light bulb, DLP will become my new first choice.  So, I decided to go with a flat panel LCD HDTV.The next question was what resolution did I need.  This came down to the size TV and the size of the room where I was going to be watching it.  I only had 40 inches of horizontal width for a TV body to fit within and this TV allowed me to make maximum use of my limited space by locating the speakers to the bottom and in the back.  With this 40 inch TV, HD resolution of 1366 x 768 (720p) is basically indistinquishable to my eyes from 1080p TV's sitting on the showroom floor when I was standing over 6 feet away.  So, I saw no reason to buy something that I really didn't need.  Plus, I don't own an HD DVD or Blue Ray DVD yet so I was not going to be driving this thing with a 1080p signal anyway.  Additionally, the best that can ever be broadcast in HD is 1080i, thus another reason not to buy a full 1080p HDTV now.  So, for me, this 40 inch model really fit the bill.I didn't purchase from Amazon because at the time that I made my purchase this TV was only 50 bucks more at CC (tax included) than from Amazon shipped and I didn't want to wait two days for it to ship.  So, I bought it and brought it home.  I got it home and had it out of the box and running in probably less than 30 minutes and it was amazing.  The next day I went by Comcast and picked up a Digital Tuner box.  They were out of the DVR boxes which have the HDMI interface so I just took their standard box with the component (red,green,blue) cables and hooked them into this TV.  I have to say that \"stunning\" does not capture how great the picture on this TV looks just from component feed and all for only an additional 5 bucks a month on my standard cable bill with Comcast.Of course you might say that I didn't need to get a TV with a HDTV tuner if I'm using a digital tuner cable box and driving the TV with the component video source and for now you would be correct.  I certainly could do what I'm doing now with an \"HD Ready\" TV and that is something you may want to think about before you buy.  I do plan to get a stand alone HD antennae for the locally transmitted HD channels in the event that I want to see these in the highest resolution this TV offers.  The digital tuner cable box also supports a coax cable signal pass through feature as well which I currently have hooked up but have failed to get to work as of yet.  Also, depending on your cable service, you may or may not need a digital tuner box to see some of the HD channels available from your cable provider.  My friend receives all of the local free HD channels directly over his cable without the need for a digital tuner cable box.Anyway, the bottom line is, if you've been waiting to jump into HDTV and you are moving from old non-HDTV, this is a great model to go with.  I don't believe you will be disappointed.  The picture is nothing short of amazing.  I had no idea what I've been missing out on.  Watching some of the college basketball games was almost like looking through a glass pane at the live action on the basketball court.  You can see things happening almost like being there in person right from the comfort of your living room.The only negative that I can share with you is that I have noticed some rattling with the speakers especially when you have them turned up a bit and there are some low frequencies that are sustained long enough for the speakers to resonate a bit.  Of course, this won't even be a problem when you buy that next must have item, the surround sound system, and hook it up.  I don't notice this often.  Its very infrequent.  The built in simulated surround sound feature was okay but nothing I'm going to use in lieu of getting a true surround sound system down the road some time.Also, there is mention in the operator's manual for this TV about a possible concern over burn in when running the TV in 4:3 mode for extended periods of time.  In this mode the image only occupies the center of the screen leaving two vertical black lines on either side of the TV image.  I have run this TV in 4:3 very long and I have seen no such problem.  I believe this is an error in the manual that probably was an artifact of copying and pasting repeated portions of text from TV manuals supporting a variety of TV types including plasma where this is a known problem.Finally, find a good price on your cables and don't buy something that you don't need.  I bought a new component cable and when I picked up the digital tuner from Comcast the component video cable came with it.  So, I had a cable I didn't need.  And, I guess, HDMI cables don't come with new DVD players.  I haven't found one yet with them included.  In some cases the cable costs more than the player.  I'm waiting to buy a new DVD upconverter with a surround sound system.  So, I'll just wait on that purchase for now.", "Date": "January 9, 2007"}, {"Title": "A high quality LCD TV", "Author": "R.

Crystal clear image when viewed from a source with High Def.(HD) broadcast AND you have the necessary cables. [see below Cons: 1.)]2.) 4000:1 contrast ratio: this is basically a comparison between the whitest white and the blackest black that the TV can give. This ratio is outstanding and accounts for some of the units exceptional video performance.3.) Lots of inputs on the back; 2x HDMI inputs, 1x S-Video, components, PC connections; as well as output jacks for connections to home theatres.4.) Inputs on the side of the unit for external devices such as video games and camcorder; these include an A/V input and a S-Video input jack. There is also a Headphone jack for private listening.5.) The external cabinet is a high gloss metallic surface that just glistens; I don't think I ever seen a TV as eye appealing as this one.6.) Comes with a good swivel stand and fully functioning remote.The Cons:1.) The unit does not come with any connecting cables except for the power cord; so, if you want the best HD reception you need to get a triple video  (Y/pb/pr)  or a HDMI cable. Also, you may require S-Video or component cables if they are needed for other external input devices (VCR, DVD etc).2.) Some other reviewers have felt the audio/speakers were somewhat weak; I thought they were adequate. I purchased this unit for its video aspect; if  I want top end sound I can hook this TV up to my stereo system.All in all, in spite of the minor concerns mentioned above, this is an outstanding LCD TV; the picture is as good as I could ever wish for.

I had been agonizing for several weeks about upgrading my television viewing.  This was a major purchase for me and I spent hours on the web looking at reviews for LCD and Plasma televisions and suffered from major electronics confusion.  Plasma looked good, but I worried about the \"burn\" problem with plasma screens.  LCD didn't have these problems but offered \"trail problems\" with motion.  What size to get??  I had a 20 inch Toshiba bought 4 years ago.  I thought that the 32 inch size would be overkill for me, but after looking at the available plasma and LCD televisions at local retailers, I found that the 37 inch and 40 inch televisions were not only wider, but SIGNIFICANTLY larger in the vertical dimension of the larger sets.  This made the 32 inch sets not very attractive to me.Now the thing that finally sold me on Samsungs product was the DNIE technology which effictively solves the trail problem on LCD television sets, at least in my opinion.  I just don't think that you can go wrong with a set like this.  It has completely blown my mind in the last hour.  I have seen detail that never existed on any previous set that I have owned, or watched for that matter.

And also like many others, I decided against large box CRTs, plasma and DLP sets for well-known reasons (at least among people who have researched these competing technologies) and in favor of LCD technology. I then determined what features would be appropriate for my viewing habits (mostly movies), what price I was able to afford and finally, which brand and model to select.  While I checked out the usual suspects (Sony, Samsung, Toshiba, JVC, Sharp, Panasonic) and a few `orphan' brands (Westinghouse, Olevia, Vizio) I finally came down decisively on the Samsung.  There's a very good reason why they've come to dominate the market.I intended to order a particular Samsung model (the LNS 4041D) from Amazon, as they seemed to have the best price, and buyers' feedback on delivery was generally very positive (I had just ordered an Oppo DV-970HD upconverting DVD player from Amazon a week ago and was anxious to get the TV now).  Before ordering, however, I went to both of the big name stores (BB and CC).  BB had that set listed for $1,299, but it was not in stock.  I went to nearby CC, thinking they might have it and match the price.  They did not have it, but had the newer 4051D in stock for...$1,299 (with 2 HDMI connections, 4,000 to 1 contrast ratio and lots more).  I went to purchase it and found that there was a `promotional special' in effect by Samsung, which was an incredible deal.  I bought the LNS-4051D, 40\" LCD set, plus custom Firedog wall mounting installation (regular $299), plus high quality wall mounting brackets (regular $204), plus tax for a grand total of $1,156!  Sorry, Amazon.It took about an hour to move my other TV (a 32\" JVC, quite heavy), disconnect some components and connect the Oppo (which came with a gold-plated HDMI cord).  Out of the box and connected to standard definition satellite signals, the image wasn't impressive.  However, a few minutes of easy tweaking brought the image closer to that of the JVC.  The high resolution of the Samsung definitely brings out the limitations of standard broadcast signals, but it still looks as good as analog CRTs (especially when changing the picture size to 4:3 ratio).  After viewing regular SD programming for a while, I put into the Oppo the widescreen Steven Spielberg remake of `War of the Worlds', tweaked the settings a bit more and beheld.  Wow.  The upconversion brought the quality of this 480p disc to near HD quality.  The difference between the Samsung and the JVC CRT set was immediate and pronounced.  It was almost like watching the film for the first time.  I then put on `Roxy Music Live from the Apollo'.  With my Yamaha receiver set on DTS and the surround volume cranked up, it nearly blew me into next week.  I've watched that concert several times, but once it was displayed upconverted to the Samsung, it was like being there in person.  Simply stunning.While it remains to be seen what my reaction will be to real HD signals, I can safely assume that it will be even more jubilance (and when prices drop in half, a HD DVD player will be on the menu).  So far, I could not be more pleased with the purchase.  It is also worth noting that the gloss piano black finish makes this unit look like a veritable work of art.  Some have complained about it, probably due to it attracting dust.  This may be true, but included with the set are soft clothes designed for cleaning the bezel and back of the set.  Since my surround speaker system is NHT that are finished in gloss piano black, the whole setup looks fantastic.

C-NET and others advised the Sony over the Samsung. I have seen both in action at the homes of friends and my eye viewed the Samsung as every bit as good in picture quality if not better than the Sony. So the decision was made on the Samsung based on features and price, anywhere from $200 to $500 cheaper based on my research. The next decision was whether to risk making such a high dollar purchase online, Amazons price being $400 to $600 less than the brick and mortar stores. After reading many reviews here on Amazon, I decided to pull the trigger and order from Amazon. It was an EXCELLENT CHOICE. The set was ordered on a Friday morning, and arrived via EGL on Amazons super saver free freight rate on Tuesday. Three business days or five calendar days. The set beat my satellite installer so I wasn't expecting much from the picture as I pulled it out of the box. I set it up to make sure it was functioning, and as expected the standard def channels were fuzzy. For kicks I connected my cheap Radio Shack rabbit ears into the antenna connection, and went searching for over the air high definition. What I found was that all the networks carried digital channels as did the fringe channels. I am getting Fox, NBC,CBS, CW, and the MY CHANNEL stations in either 480p or 720p. I also get a PBS HD signal in 1080i. When the networks broadcast their hi-def signals they all come in in either 720p or 1080i. All this on a cheap ten dollar Radio Shack rabbit ears antenna. I have a friend who bought a DLP projection, something I was looking at, and he only receives a 480p signal. Samsung obviously got it right with their built in HD tuner.

Great picture, tons of features and price is right. This tv has it all. You can use HDMI (has 2, maybe one for a dvd player and PS3 and so on). I hooked up my HDMI capabale DVD player and the picture and sound are perfect (you need to change the sound setting within your DVD player to get the sound). I even hooked up my xBox 360 and was floored. Standard tv through satellite is not as bad as I thought. I see people having problems but I have a soulution if you do not want to spend \"more\" money on HD (I know, it is an HDTV afterall). Instead of using the coax, use S-Video and audi cables. My wife was opposed to the tv at first. We have been using a 32\" Sony tube tv that I bought when I re-enlisted in the Air Force back in '99. So this was an upgrade to a dying breed of tv and dying tv. So I hooked up the S-Video and she was happy with the quality. Also, if you have Direct TV and the picture looks squished in widescreen and you are coming from a tube tv, there is a setting with in the Direct Tv tuner to set it to widescreen. Most problems people have are usually 9 times out fo 10 either correctable or operator error. I ran into about 5 of them when I hooked this beast up and all were fixable due to my error. What is also great about this tv is you can contol an iPod through it (connector sold seperatly), hook up a computer, a camera/camcorder, has \"2\" HDMI hookups, a USB port, has Picture In Picture (although not as good as the Phillips TV0. Another good thing about LCD tvs compared to Plasma is this, \"GLARE\". Facing out TV is a Bay window. Even though we have blinds we would still get nasty reflections on our tv. Plasma was just as bad due to its glass screen. With the LCD, no glare whats so ever. SOLD. You can not beat this TV. You get more than what you pay for. Also, with the hidden speakers (sound great), it looks a bit less bulky than most. As with most tv's, it is customizable to fit your needs and likes. What more is there to want.

I considered the 32\" for a while and then got \"feature creep\". For only a few hundred extra bucks I got the 40\" and I'm glad I did. So I dove in and bought it from Amazon.PROSNice big picture! Super lightweight relative to Cathode Ray Tubes tvs.Superior picture quality with HD and with DVDs. Easy to configure.NO motion artifacts. Standard LCD horror stories do not apply on this model.The Eagle shipping was great. Mine shipped from harrisburg PA to the DC area, so it was FAST and without problem. They called me one day and we scheduled delivery on the next day between 2PM and 6PM. Shipper arrived promptly at 2 and carried the box into my home. Great service.CONSThe picture quality is absolutely top notch. As you will find, standard cable signal quality is NOT so good. In other words, your TV can display an astonishing picture quality that reveals the severe limitations of standard definition cable signals.HD on the other hand is AMAZING. You'll find that you prefer watching film of paint dry on Discovery HD to your favorite TV show on standard channels. My only advice is get used to it!True black tones are not true black on an LCD. They're real close, but not perfect. This is probably the single limitation of LCD displays. You can tell, but you probably won't care given how good everything looks. Or, if you can't deal with this, get yourself a plasma.The sound volume is not strong. Sound quality is fine but volume is weak. This thing has 5W or 10W sound - look at the specs. It's OK for just watching TV on most channels but you have to pump it to 50-70% on certain channels. If you are hard of hearing, have a big room, live in a noisy environment, or just like it loud, you will need reinforcement. And, clearly, for theater sound you will need reinforcement but that is true for any model of TV.Overall very happy with the product and with Amazon's role as my merchant.", "Date": "January 8, 2007"}, {"Title": "Hot, Sexy, and a Great Picture Too", "Author": "Jason Scott Stewart \"Jascoman\"", "ReviewID": "R2W2MMU75Z703W", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This is a fine looking tv.

At first, they did not understand why I couldn't undo the entire installation to salvage the cable. When I pointed out to them that people pay hundreds of dollars for an installation, they saw my point. They did not seem so hot on getting the word out or updating their manual, even though they admitted that it was wrong. So, if anyone else has similar problems, I hope you might find the trail I blazed useful. Samsung Executive Customer Relations' phone number is 800-522-7341. And for reference, my case number was 3000115125.UPDATE: I finally got up the strength to stay on hold with Samsung customer support.They admitted that the manual has incorrect information.  In other words, this TV cannot output 5.1 Channel surround sound.  Go figure.++++I am very happy with this television for most of the reasons described in the other comments.Here are some words about the audio. I ran an HDMI cable from my cable box to my TV and I ran a second HDMI cable from my DVD to my TV. Then, I connected an optical audio cable from my TV to my receiver. I found that in this set-up, the TV is not capable of bypassing the full audio signal. The result is that you cannot listen to surround sound in over two channels. This means, you cannot, for exmaple, listen to movies in 5.1 Dolby surround mode. The solution is to wire the cable box and the dvd player (and any other components you may wish) directly into the receiver. Of course, this means you have more buttons to push each time you want to watch something. And it also means that you need to have plenty of input jacks on your receiver for digital audio. And of course, you need to buy the extra cables.Incidentally, the TV manual does say that it can bypass 5.1 channel audio. I have a new samsung DVD player plugged into the TV, and the 5.1 channel audio bypass does not work.  So my conclusion is that contrary to what the manual says, the TV can only bypass 2 channel audio. I had a long discussion with tech support at Crutchfield (I bought my receiver from them). He agreed that the TV likely cannot do what the manual says it should do.I installed the TV and sound system myself. I mounted the TV on the wall and ran the cables through the wall.I have disconnected the audio cable and will leave it unused as a sacrifice to the home entertainment gods instead of trying to salvage it.

We have our TV hooked up to our new Dish Network high definition box and the picture in high def is incredible compared to a normal CRT TV. The picture is so crisp and clear that it is almost like you are there. Especially on the Discovery HD and National Geographic channels or any channel where the source was filmed in high def. Even the standard def picture is very,very good, better than expected. The TV's built in speaker sound seemed fine for us, as we have a small living room, but we use a Onkyo TX-SR604 receiver and Polk speakers almost all the time, so it doesn't really matter. The exterior of the TV is beautiful and much better than that lousy silver color that most manufacturers use. There could be a few more inputs on the back for flexibility, but the minimum of what you need is there. We have our Dish Network box sending component video and optical audio signal to our home theater receiver, and then video back to the TV and the audio out to our Polk speakers. I tried both component and HDMI cables and honestly, I did not see a difference. If you are reading these reviews trying to find the right TV just like I was two month's ago, look no further.

I had heard that EGL sometimes delivers without setting up a time, and I didn't want to miss the delivery.  The company representatives I encountered were quite professional and courteous.  The delivery team brought the TV in the house, took it out of the box and helped me test it before I signed for it.  This was important because Amazon will refer buyers to the manufacturer if something goes wrong after it is received.The TV looks as beautiful as I thought it would on my HD channels.  The TV is connected by Monster HDMI cable to a digital DVR/cable box.  The channels not offered in HD were a bit of a disappointment, as Samsung claims to be able to make any signal look good.

The picture would blur when following a football in the air, such as a punt or a thrown pass.  The blurring was also noticeable while watching baskeball and watching the score ticker on ESPN.

Forget about what they say about refresh rate.  6ms or 8ms, doesn't matter.  There is no standard for measuring this so the refresh rate will differ from manufacturer to manufacturer, in part because they are using different methods to measure the refresh rate.

However, some of the bad reviews prevented me from doing so. I've had problems with shipping companies before so I know I wouldn't want to deal with that crp.I did see that one of the companies offering this tv thru  an actual brick and mortar store which was near my house so I just hopped over there, paid the tax and brought this sucker home.Of course, I did the mandatory 3 month research online and trips to the big name electronic stores ... compared it to the LG, Polaroid, and Sony. Time after time I came back to this TV. The contrast ratio and the PIP were deal breakers for me. I didn't think the contrast ratio mattered until I saw an LG with the lower ratio and the blacks looked gray. The Sony's were ok picture-wise but Samsung really gives you more bang for your buck (feature-wise).I was hoping for a 37\" because I felt a 40\" was too big but they don't make 37\" LCD's anymore. I considered the DLP but they don't make them smaller than 42\" and I just don't have enough space for that big a tv. And plus, I don't want to change the bulb every three or so years. And the option to be able to hang this on a wall was worth the price over the DLP.The only downside I couldn't get over was the inputs on the tv. It only has 1 component input and 2 rca's. Almost all the other tv's had at least 2 component inputs. But then I figured it has 2 HDMI inputs so once I upgrade my DVD player, that shouldn't matter.The speakers are weak and the treble is just waay too high. I tried adjusting it but it's a no-go. I can't wait for my surround speakers. I do, however, love the fact that they're hidden so that's a plus.All in all, it was a worthwhile purcahse. I don't know how that other guy was picking up HD channels over-the-air with his regular rabbit ears but that didn't work for me. I live 10 miles away from nyc and a cheap hdtv antenna works fine.  I race back home every night to watch shows in HD. I suggest you make the jump, too, so you can see the difference.**EDITPS.

The picture on the DVD I popped in was so-so.  I started with an older less polished DVD to see what the picture would look like.  It was Goldeneye to be exact and the pixels were jagged and blurry.  Fortunately I found the issue was that my DVD player had been set up for interlaced viewing, so I changed it to the Progressive scan setting, and the picture was much better.  Very big difference from I to P...  (if you don't know the difference between 480i and 480p etc.  you should really look into the basics of HDTV before reading reviews on expensive TVs)For the price (I got it for $1650 but now it's around 1300), I was expecting more Component inputs on the TV since HDMI is still pretty new, but as it stands You'll be able to hookup your HDMI Xbox360 or PS3 no problem and the 720p looks SOO good I have to admit it's just as high def as 1080p and it's MUCH CHEAPER.  I was also surprised that the TV didn't have a coaxial output, so I had to get an Optical cable instead.  That being said, I can't really comment on the sound from the TV speakers because I use the optical output with my Sony DG800 7.1 receiver.  So I get digital surround sound from all my equipment (DVD player, Xbox 360, and Satellite HD box).  (honestly no TV cabinet should be used for sound, the audio in that little stand is pathetic compared to the big screen so match it with a big sound system.  cmon after shelling out this kind of money at least get a $300 home theater in a box)I made the leap into HD Satellite programming and I've been very pleased.  I use dishnetwork and they carry typical local channels in HD as well as your average cable channels like ESPN but they also carry the VOOM channels which are full High Definition you can tell they're crisper than even ESPN is!  I love how beautiful the picture is in High definition it's amazing and worth the upgrade if you like watching sports and movies.An interesting note for you readers, the gentleman who helped me out with the purchase was a specialist who has been selling TVs for about 4 years, and he never pushed me towards a TV I just did my research online and went into the store, and said, \"I want that one\"  and while he was ringing me up I simply asked him what kind of TV he had for himself, being a connoisseur and all and no joke he confessed he had the exact same Samsung just the 32\" little brother to the 40\".  So if it's good enough for him, it's good enough for me.The original settings are okay, but as with any TV it'd be best for you to tweak it like I did, to your personal preference.  Skintones looked slightly orange so I messed around and all is well.  It's nice it keeps different picture settings for each source (i.e.  your DVD pic won't change when you mess with your game settings)I'm pleased with the TV on it's wonderful stand.  I'd recommend it to anybody interested in replacing a TV whether it's a bedroom set, or the family room TV.

Otherwise, I'd have to take off from work to be home to sign for the delivery. Note that Eagle could not have called me to make delivery arrangements because Amazon did not provide my telephone number to them - if I didn't call Eagle, I don't know how they'd make arrangements to delivery the TV without further delay, so do acknowledge the caveat.When I spoke to the dispatcher in charge of local delivery, to make delivery arrangements, I also asked her about the responsibilities of the delivery men. She advised me that they will unbox the TV, place it on your furniture and take the box with them (if you wish). They will not mount the TV to the wall, and they will not wait for you to turn it on to check its operation.The delivery men were courteous and careful.They called me about half an hour in advance of the delivery, and had it in my house 45 minutes before the close of the \"delivery window\" (9AM-1 PM).I purchased the TV when Amazon had it listed for $1299.99, now it is more -lucky me.My Directv has not yet been upgraded to HD, yet I'm receiving gorgeous off-the-air transmissions using the Zenith Indoor HDTV Antenna(sold through Amazon, of course, and also received very quickly). The cable from this antenna is plugged into the Directv receiver \"air in\" antennareceptacle. The Zenith Antenna did NOT work when I attached its' cable directly to the \"air in\" antenna receptacle on the TV. Live and learn.I simply can't fathom how much more beautiful the images can be with HD - but I'll find out at the end of the month when Directv upgrades my system.I have no problems with the speakers rattling, as some few others claim.The TV is beautiful without even being turned on. It's a super-shiny black with \"good lines\" - a good companion to my Ford Ranger Edge, come to think of it (and my Black Labrador Retriever).Thanks to Amazon, Samsung and Eagle Airfreight !UPDATE: After awhile it dawned on me that the volume needed to be increased from the maximum offered.

Standard definition cable doesn't look that great, but thats what you should expect when you get a TV with higher resolutions. Opt for digital or HD cable. Regular DVDs still look good though, so don't worry about that.Playing the 360, the TV is flawless. I use the game mode while playing Oblivion, Gears of War, even Halo 2. The TV just does everything I expected it to do. I am eventually going to hook my gaming PC up to it through the VGA connector, but as of right now I am having trouble finding a long enough VGA cord for the right price.I gave the TV 4 stars instead of 5 because of the User interface and remote. The remote is slow to react to my button pushes, and the menu interface isn't the best either. A remote can be replaced (try the Harmonix remotes), but the menu system is stuck there. Some options are hidden away. The game mode option is under setup category instead of picture. The brightness option is hidden in power management instead of just being called brightness.At the end of the day though, when I got used to the menu navigation, I just love this TV. I think Samsung has a customer for life now whenever I upgrade TVs.I also want to point out that Amazon did a tremendous job with Eagle USA shipping (look it up as EGL shipping). They delivered the TV right to my house, brought it in and opened it up for me. They waited for me to turn it on and make sure it worked to my liking, and they even took the garbage from the packaging with them as they left. 5 Stars for the delivery (which was free also).", "Date": "April 15, 2007"}, {"Title": "Great TV for the Great Price!", "Author": "Bruised Leroy \"Electronic Luver\"", "ReviewID": "RPAWYN2P4Y14G", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Like most people here, I bought this TV because of the great reviews.

With the price it's at now I don't think you will be disappointed.  The only negative is fast scrolling letters across the screen ex. espn news flashs are a little blury. I think you will have a hard time buying a better TV.  Amazon also had great prices on Monster cables and surge protectors too.

Just try and stop a shipment from them once it's out the door. Several Email back and forth did not bring me any help. \"How\", I asked, did I get from the \"shopping Basket\" to the Checkout\"? Well, they said. \"we put you on the \"one click\" checkout as you are a regular customer. Ya right, I had bought a book a week earlier. The real kicker in the pants was when they used my CHECK CARD, which I used to buy the book, instead of my CREDIT CARD, which they have on file. This put me into an overdrsaft conditioned and trashed my savings account to cover it. No, they would not credit my CHECK CARD and put the charge on my CHARGE card.
