We were never able to find a remote code that works with tivo so we constantly have to have two remotes in hand.Edited to add: The audio is so annoying that we are returning the tv.

I wanted a name brand, and this was the best deal. Some sets this size and price don't have HDMI, or have only one input. The picture is fine I don't have a problem with the sound- it's what you expect from small speakers.I got this to replace a small CRT. There are 2 HDMI inputs, plus the 5 wire color-coded input from a cable box, which is what I'm using. Add to that analog PC input, S-video, RCA and audio input from a PC. If you want to use this as a computer monitor, be aware the screen does not tilt.This would be a good TV for a dorm room, which is where it may end up if my daughter gets her hands on it!Update: Just before the return period ended, the set stopped working. Great while it lasted!I was able to get something else a little bigger.", "Date": "September 14, 2008"}, {"Title": "Good television for the price", "Author": "TW990", "ReviewID": "R3QKJPPP6D76UI", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I bought this television recently at Sears on sale for 200 dollars. The picture quality is good (not great, but good) and sound quality is okay as well. I understand how some people might be frustrated with the picture and the sound, but a name brand 19 inch 720p HDTV with two HDMI inputs for 200? I was impressed. You shouldn't expect the quality of say a Samsung or Sony for this price, but realistically, like I've said this is an excellent buy for a small room.

We own a 13\" tv/ vcr that we had been usingand we figured that although the reviews for this tv warned us of  tinny audio issues it couldn't be worse than our 15 year old ,13\" tv. we were wrong. It's unbearable! Perhaps it has a lot to do with the size and shape of our room, In any event we now need to invest in 50$-100$ worth of surround sound. or send the tv back.  the picture could be ok, I dont know?

Meaning it has a energy saving  option which is cool.  As with other reviews I must agree that the volume control sucks.  Their times when the volume is at its max to hear the show your watching.

Images are sharp and the sound is good (despite some negative reviews) for a small TV.  Inputs: HDMI, component, composite and others give you connection options and a PC input allows you to use the TV as a computer monitor.It was almost impossible to determine from the manual and Sylvania's on-line resources what HD resolution [720p, etc...] the TV runs at.  For the record, the resolution is widescreen HD resolution of 1440x900 \"XVGA\" (one step down from 720p).  But if you are shopping for a 19-inch TV screen you probably shouldn't insist on numbers like 720p and 1080p--that becomes more important on larger screen sizes.My only complaint is the model is too new to accept codes from my satellite TV remote.  Using two remotes is a bit of a pain, but I'm hoping they come up with a new code to fix this issue.", "Date": "January 29, 2009"}, {"Title": "Audio Really Does suck", "Author": "Velvet23", "ReviewID": "R17CRZCKOQX0BR", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "The audio is pretty bad.
