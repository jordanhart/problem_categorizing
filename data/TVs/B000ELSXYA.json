OK, the analogue input may not be brilliant, but I don't think its worse that what I got on the older TVs we had.  And the picture with the DVD with digital input is fabulous.  Sound is fine also; the controls and the menus are intuitive and easy.As long as it holds up, I'm going to be very glad I got this one.Two small complaints:  the manual left out something about hooking up the dvd that I found on the samsung website - you may need to change the player's mode of output if you are starting with component cables.  AND it took me quite a while to find out how to use the codes for other devices.  OK, you input them, but how??  And what was said doesn't seem to work.  But given the quality of the set, I really don't count these as worth any minus points.If you get stuck at some point, try the samsung website.  Go to this model and look over at the right hand side of the screen and you'll see something like \"TV help\".

Amazon's free shipping offer and no sales tax resulted in 25% lower cost than any walk-in store.  Extended warranties are not recommended by Consumer Reports, etc, because these HDTVs have outstanding reliability, so that made me more comfortable with a no-warranty internet order.  Amazon stated 5-10 business days shipping, but after just 2 days, the UPS guys were at my doorstep handing me the box.  I attached the base and hooked up the set in about 30 minutes.  It worked perfectly on my 90-channel non-HD cable service.  A month later the cable company installed our HD box ($9/month rental) and the 20 HD channels are fantastic.  The superbowl game was incredibly sharp.  At first, channel switching was slightly slower than I'm used to, but with the HD box it is back to normal (fast).  I chose Samsung for its brilliant picture quality.  Once that was decided, my quandry was picture size.  I started at 20\", then 23\", then settled on 26\".  Although the viewing is ok for a small room, 32\" would have been even better, but it would have dwarfed our room.  If you are undecided, go larger.  The 16:9 HD format requires a much larger nominal size than the old 4:3 standard def.  I am very pleased with this purchase and highly recommend it.", "Date": "February 9, 2007"}, {"Title": "5 Stars for Samsung \"Surpassing The Rest\"", "Author": "Chris E", "ReviewID": "R2EJ317GFM5IVU", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "First up, this TV is gorgeous! The piano-black finish really enhances the picture and brings out the deep blacks in the high-contrast images.  The picture can't be beat (and I did a ton of comparison shopping -- in-store & online).  The TV is super-slim compared to the competitors - its awesome to look at even when it's \"off\".  Call me shallow, but I was concerned as to how the TV would look in my room & truth of the matter is that I couldn't be more pleased.  I feel like I bought a piece of art!Picture-detail and colors are amazing!  Vibrant, crystal-clear images -- high-tech/theater quality.  The menu is great too; its really user-friendly and allows a ton of options so that you can customize picture/sound settings to your meet your preferences.  It's simple to set-up, so no need to hire a pro.My only concern was the speakers; and I'm sad to say, they leave alot to be desired.  I had hoped the 2 \"hidden\" 5 watt speakers would be sufficient for my small room, but they proved to be inferior.  I hear a tinny quality and cannot discern any deapths between the tonal output.  I was so unhappy with the audio that I upgraded by purchasing samsung's mid-priced home theater-in-a-box (Q45).  After doing so, I have been very pleased & I'm really happy with that decision.  Also, make sure to realize that if the speakers were not internal and tucked into the bottom of the set, it would not look as sleek and stunning as it does.  The benefits of the 51D's sleek design outweighs all of these considerations!The \"glare\" factor you may have read about in other reviews, has NOT proved to be an issue for me.  Granted, the exterior looks 10x better with the lights turned \"off\", but even when they are on, I have not found this to be at all distracting (and I'm really picky about such details, before buying this set I was worried about the possibility of glare since I do alot of watching with my lights \"on\".  Just make sure you dust the set at least 1-2x/month -- not anything too drastic (make sure you buy the lcd cleaner at your local electronics store-- no windex, pledge, or water!)I can't imagine owning a different set.  I'm so happy with this purchase that I would recommend this set to everyone I know.  I don't think as many people would have as much as an issue with the speakers as I did.  My ears are super-sensitive and detect more than the average listener, so don't necessarily weigh my audio criteria against yours -- its a matter of priority (the rest of my family thinks they were great!)  My room is only 10' x 12' but if I had a larger room I would not hesitate to go with the 32\" model.", "Date": "February 5, 2007"}, {"Title": "Excellent LCD TV", "Author": "Andrew R. Walker", "ReviewID": "RFI3ZIOW8V5WY", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I just received this TV and absolutely love it!  The integrated tuner makes this an excellent buy and I get almost all of the available local channels in HD (in a not-so-great location >30 miles from all the transmitters) with an indoor antenna!

Samsung may cost more than comparably-sized panels, but the quality, fit, and finish more than make up for the added cost.", "Date": "September 26, 2006"}, {"Title": "It's always about the setup and the bottom line", "Author": "The Unluddited \"Tim\"", "ReviewID": "RFROEOVK2EEIZ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "An excellent set depending on how you set it up and use it.My criteria were:- 24-27\" Wide-screen 16X9 (for small sitting area off kitchen)- High Definition- Integrated HDTV tuner (ATSC)- LCD flat panel with minimum 1366X768 resolution- 8ms response time or better- High contrast to counteract a well-lit area- HDMI input(s)- An excellent picture both in-store and in online reviewsThe Samsung LNS2651D met them all. It's mated to an HDTV satellite receiver (with dish and rooftop HD antenna) and an HD upconverting DVD player. I'm currently receiving about 17 HD channels including the \"major networks\", HBO, Showtime, Discovery, TNT, and a couple of ESPNs. This is important because it covers a pretty high percentage of our TV time. If you're watching the CNN and the Weather Channel 90% of the time, this set's probably overkill...look for a 4:3 EDTV and save your money. On the other hand, if primetime major network is your thing, the ATSC tuner should give you a good supply of HD quality viewing without satellite so long as your antenna setup is up to the task.This Samsung really shines in high definition, where many movies and shows leap out at you with an almost 3D image. It's wonderful with widescreen DVD, especially the HD or HD upconverting players. Colors are true, vibrant, and well-defined. Ghosting hasn't been observed, even in fast action sports, with the low response time. Contrast, brightness, and other video adjustments may initially be necessary to get an optimal picture, this is especially true with standard definition sources. Blacks are generally well done, with the caveat that some detail within blacks can be lost, especially if the overall scene is dark. No edge problems are apparent; convergence settings look good out of the box. Its 170 degree viewing angle seems as advertised and the picture doesn't easily wash out, even with too much sunshine in the room.The LNS2651D is good-to-very good in standard definition with a 4:3 aspect ratio (no fan of stretching/cropping the picture, so it's black bars on the sides for me!), about what you'd expect from 480i channels on an LCD. The mandatory noise reduction/picture enhancement circuitry (DNIe) generally works well but the inability to disengage it (without some service menu trickery) is a bit of a disadvantage but even then, it only seems to be a slight problem with low definition material.Audio quality isn't bad for what it is, small built-in speakers on a thin TV. The sound isn't tinny or shrill, but its not exactly room filling either. You do get some traces of the \"SRS Tru-Surround\" audio effects with movies and other programs at times, but if you're looking for theater-like audio....you know the drill, that's a separate purchase.Fit and finish on the LNS2651D is remarkable with the glossy piano-black cabinet; an exquisite-looking television. Careful searches have revealed no dead or ailing pixels on this screen, which is always a relief. The set is also attached to an articulating arm (separate purchase) allowing it to be turned completely perpendicular to its wall position. Using an HDMI connection means only three wires (two HDMIs and power) run through the wall, the arm, and then to the panel instead of 4 to 6 or more wires with other configurations.The off-kitchen area went from a mammoth 19\" CRT with the rudimentary satellite receiver to a wall mounted articulating 26\" widescreen HD flat panel with an HD satellite receiver and an HD upconverting DVD player. This setup was completely wired and installed for a little under $1,200...not bad when the MSRP is $100 more than that on the LCD TV alone. Buying online really makes a difference. The Samsung LNS2651D is recommended for HD and DVD lovers without reservation.

I am 18, and this will end up going to college with me, so it is a perfect dorm size.  I am using it primarily for my Playstation 3, and with HDMI cables and 5.1 surround sound, let me tell you, I am in heaven.  Picture quality is amazing, not as good as some larger TV's but they have a size and resolution advantage (1080p versus 720p)  Going from SD to HD with my PS3 games is like night to day.  Also, I never knew DVD's could look so amazing.  I only have one Blu Ray disc, and as expected, great picture quality.  One small issue I noticed was that in certain situations there is a bit of a flicker, but I am sure this has nothing to do with the TV itself, but more LCD as a technology.  Also I noticed some strange effects on very dark scenes but this was fixed by lowering the backlight brightness.The fit and finish of this set is top notch.  It has a glossy black surface that catches the light and looks stunning.  (Especially since it matches the my PS3 =)  The plugs on the back of the TV are really stuck on there, no loose fittings here.  Unfortunately there is no DVI port, but a DVI>HDMI converter should cover you for your computer monitor needs.  The Menu is easy to navigate and helpful.  The remote is great, I love the way it fits in my hand, however it is a bit long, may need to shift your hand around to get some of the buttons, but unless you are very very lazy this should be a nonissue.Overall I am very satisfied, and feel that this TV was well worth my money.  It is a pleasure to look at and a pleasure to use.  The only gripes I have are that the power cord is a bit too short, and the case will show dust and smudges like nobody's business.", "Date": "February 15, 2007"}, {"Title": "Great Deal and amazing picture", "Author": "Joe", "ReviewID": "R1E44ABJBQ6S8P", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This TV sells for over $1100 in Circuit city and Best buy.

Lahue", "ReviewID": "RCVTHGKVQMNYI", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "TV is ok with an analog cable input.  I didn't expect brilliance with this TV for analog signals.  The biggest disappointment with this TV is how limited the PIP is.  If you are viewing an analog signal on the main display, then the PIP only works with an HDMI input source.  If using the AV1 or S-Video input on main display, PIP only works with digital TV or HDMI input.  If using digital TV on main display, PIP only works with AV1, S-Video or Component input.  PIP only has real choices if the main display is showing something from an HDMI input.  So if you are interested in this TV (and it is really good for digital input), then unless you have an HDMI input source, PIP is a useless feature.Also note that if you are using an analog input (such as cable), then channel changes are very slow.  Most TVs have an almost instantaneous channel change.  Here, it takes about 2 seconds to flip to the next channel.  If you are rapid channel flipper (like I am) than you have to learn to be patient with the TV.", "Date": "December 3, 2006"}, {"Title": "Expensive but a nice tv", "Author": "Joe B \"JBB\"", "ReviewID": "R22ULDEC3GERAJ", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "A pricey TV but a very nice pic and set up was easy.", "Date": "February 10, 2007"}, {"Title": "TV Review", "Author": "Henry R.

I was really nervous ordering something this big on amazon because you cant return this 'cuz amazon has only in home warranty repair on TV's. Even though amazon has this policy where the ordered TV should be unpack on delivery and you should inspect if there something broken, you can refuse to sign so there wouldnt be a burden on you because you cant return the TV... or something like that. Anyhow, when he were about to give me his portable thingy to sign, I ask him if he were instructed to unpack this, and he said he's only here for delivery, so I signed.  I inspected the box, it looks like its well taken care, I unpack and connected it thru my PC, I open up pixel detector buddy and carefully inspected dead pixels, there were NONE. I open up bunch of video files and this TV has gorgeous black, the colors are great. Exterior looks great, it has glossy piano black exterior. I was opting for 32 inch of the same model but amazon.com doesn't ship to Hawaii. This TV is just a bit bigger than my 2407FPW Dell monitor. The speaker a bit weak, but then again, for its size, this is just good only for small rooms and not on living room, yeah I use this on my room. My only consolation for TV is that I hope to get the Mustang wall mount for free via rebate. I would have bought 32\" model on reputable store on pricegrabber.  What I hate about this TV is the headphone jack, would been great if they put it on the side. PIP isnt a dual tuner PIP, you cant have 2 TV station on your TV at once. Its either a tuner and other TV inputs.

The BAD: We reset the sound coming directly from its speakers, but because of speaker location underneath/below the screen,it lacks sparkle, esp at low to med. volume. The UGLY:  Imagine sending your intelligent,pretty young daughter out on her first date, with shoveled-on make-up, and wearing a cheap black vinyl dress.  The \"Piano Black\" case on this tv is a nightmare!  It shows a rippled effect, which gets distracting and even more tacky when outside light shines (even lightly) on it.
