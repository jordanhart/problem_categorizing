{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Beautiful picture, great price.", "Author": "Farmboyz", "ReviewID": "R2EZ5N5TD1CMPG", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I was able to talk this tv down to $820 (Canadian).  For that money, you can't beat it.  Especially for an LED tv, and the size.  It's positively enormous in our average (14ish feet across) living room.THE PROS:- It produces bright, vivid, accurate colours- Deep blacks, with no hints of blue- Impressive bright whites, which don't bleed, at all. (Even at full contrast)- Muted tones are reproduced nicely- Lots of inputs! (Four HDMI, two component, VGA, etc)- Attractive design.  It has a shiny, black bezel with a clear edge.- Super thin profile.- 15-degree swivel stand gives good rear access- Price!- Pre-set viewing modes do a decent job (especially sports & movie)- Sharp details with next-to-no artifacts (once calibrated and silly features are turned off)- Led backlight is brilliant- Can plug a USB key in and listen to music or watch video- PC connectionTHE CONS:- Needs lots of calibrating (turn off all the crap!....no need for noise reduction & dynamic contrast)- Pre-set modes can't be modified- Contrast ratio is bit low, so the dynamic contrast can jump a lot (can be turned off in Personal Mode)- Picky eyes (like mine) will see a hint of red/yellow in the whites- Only one audio out, and it's digital coax- Speakers fire rearwards, so I find that too much \"stray\" sound is travelling around the house- file understanding (with USB key) is limited to mp3 & aviSome people will complain that it has no ethernet connection and can't stream things like Netflix.  I think this is moot.  Considering that you can do this from so many devices.  I don't care if I do that from by Blu-Ray player, tv, Wii, or whatever.Overall, this tv is a great buy.  I'm extremely happy with it.", "Date": "January 4, 2011"}, {"Title": "Bad colors", "Author": "zBriGuy", "ReviewID": "RKN0GXT32N1D1", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I was excited when I found this very affordable TV with all the bells and whistles I was looking for.  It really is a solid TV all around with almost everything you could ask for.  I was however very dissapointed with how the colors looked on screen.  The picture looks fine until you see any solid primary color (especially red).  The colors get oversaturated and scream out LOOK AT ME!!!  It is very distracting and I wound up returning this TV because of it.  This issue was reproduced using a variety of sources (cable, XBOX, DVD), source resolutions (480, 720i&p;, 1080i&p;), connection cables (including HDMI) and tweaking all the settings I could.  I could have just got a lemon, but I would recommend anyone considering this TV get a good look at one first andmake sure you are happy with the colors before you decide to get it.", "Date": "January 2, 2011"}, {"Title": "Can not be beat for the price.", "Author": "Scott D. Ellingson \"Poco242\"", "ReviewID": "RPHJ85Z7N7A8Z", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I bought this television at a \"Club\" store, not Amazon. I paid under $700 for it. I could not believe a 46\" 120hz LED TV for under $700. I got it home and within an hour the picture went black. I tapped on the TV and it came on again. I knew I had a bad TV then. I called Philips first thing Sat morning. I waited on hold less than 30 sec. I explained the issue and what I did to correct it. They said I could get it repaired or take it back to the store. I of course took it back to exchange it. Support was very friendly and helpful.On the second try I had better success. This one worked great. The picture is not perfect, but good. I did not expect a $1400 Samsung picture, but it has a pretty good picture. Good color, very crisp and clear, just a little lacking on the blacks. Overall I am happy. I gave it 5 stars because I believe I just got unlucky with the first one. It can happen with any brand.If you want a good TV for a low price, this is a good choice. I did pay $75 for an extra 3 years on the warranty. Even with that, the cost was well below the next cheapest 46\" TV. If it dies after that, I will get a new one. The way the price is comming down on these TV's they will probibly pay me to take the net one :)", "Date": "March 20, 2011"}, {"Title": "Good TV - Great Price", "Author": "Ryan1", "ReviewID": "R2BEVE2UQWBDMX", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I bought this tv for under $850 through Amazon as a Christmas gift for my parents.

It had all the features I wanted, so I thought I would take a chance on it. I did have to purchase a dongle for the Media Connect feature so that brought the price up to just over $800.Overall I am very happy with the TV. It was very easy to set up and tweak the settings to my taste. The picture is beautiful! On true HD channels it looks like you could step right into the scene. The image is almost 3D it looks that good. The sound is average, but I will be upgrading my sound system in the near future, so I am living with it for now.PROS:Great Picture.Lots of inputs.Menus and setup are very simple.Can add devices and customize them in the menu so they are selectable.Very stylish and unobtrusive design.Nice that you can connect to your PC and network for internet wirelessly.Netflix app works flawlessly (TV comes with three apps preinstalled: Netflix, Twitter, and a music app.)CONS:Have to buy dongle separately for wireless internet (It does have an ethernet connection but that means the ethernet cable connection has to be near tv.)Dongle setup instructions are very vague and Philips website isn't any help. In fact, the website is terrible.You have to be technically savvy to connect to your wireless network.Only one audio output (Digital Coaxial).Apps are limited (Don't know if you can upgrade.)Just a quick note on the Media Connect feature that connects the TV to you PC. Philips highlights this with a nice video on the web, but like all products you can be disappointed when it comes to actually using it. There is a huge lag between the computer and TV (about 3-5 seconds.) so if you try to use the TV as a monitor, say while sitting on your couch (I have a wireless mouse and keyboard for the PC.) it won't work. You move the mouse and by the time the cursor catches up on the TV you have overshot your target. It also means that you wouldn't be able to Skype using the TV because the video and audio lag would be very irritating to both parties. It does work great for showing videos or photos though or if you work from the PC monitor while your audience watches it on the TV.Overall I am very happy with my purchase and I am sure that in the future all TVs will gravitate towards all in one appliances and not just devices to watch broadcast tv (Just look at some of the products Sony is coming out with.).", "Date": "April 13, 2011"}, {"Title": "Stunning picture, no problems", "Author": "Marian R. Van Til", "ReviewID": "RPCMH9KB3EX1J", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "My husband and I have now had this HDTV since a bit before last Christmas (2010). We're very happy with it. The picture is stunning and all the features work as they should. I also like that it's on a swivel stand so it can be angled as one wishes (didn't want to hang it on the wall). The speakers/sound are/is about what one would expect from a TV. We bought a compatible Philips sound bar which has a separate sub-woofer and I'd very much recommend doing that if you don't already have a home theatre sound system. That addition improves the sound dramatically for TV shows, movies, listening to the music channels, etc., and provides good rich bass as well.The only issue with the sound bar -- and obviously that's not the product really being reviewed here -- is that often when you switch channels it gets slightly out of sync with the sound of the TV (you can turn off the TV sound if you want to, but you get better sound with both simultaneously). There's a \"sync\" button on the sound bar remote that is supposed to let you correct that, but it often doesn't. You then need to turn the sound bar power off and back on, and it does correct itself. (We also bought a compatible Philips Blu-Ray player which we also like.)", "Date": "July 16, 2011"}, {"Title": "NO, Please Don't Do It", "Author": "des88", "ReviewID": "R3I6FMIHR5EODP", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "Philips TVs last a year if you're lucky.
