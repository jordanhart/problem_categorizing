The move is to larger models (e.g, 32\"). So if you want the smaller 24\" size, you might want to shop around for price and buy now before these become as scarce as CRTs. This is a decent TV. Not a lot of settings but more than enough for most folks and the defaults will probably serve most folks well.The tiny loudspeakers sound like the tiny loudspeakers that are put in all these thin, low real estate TVs. This won't sound like your home theater system unless you plug the audio output form the TV into your receiver. Otherwise, it's going to sound like all the other TVs and laptops with tiny, tinny, loudspeaker.There is only one HDMI input so this might best be mated with a single BD/DVD/network-link player or game/movie-streaming device.The good news, it doesn't buzz incessantly like my Samsung znd hasn't committed electrical suicide like my LG.Btw, order your HDMI cable from amazon when you order the TV -- no point running over to, say, Best Buy, in the car at the last minute and paying $30, $40, $60 for an HDMI cable -- the Amazon cables that cost $1-$10 will work just fine.", "Date": "June 11, 2012"}, {"Title": "Read the reviews and specs before buying", "Author": "Garrett S.", "ReviewID": "R1Z5DJTTOKU7HE", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I purchased this TV during the black Friday lightning rounds. I was among the many that didn't realize the limitations of the TV before buying. Because Amazon has both the 24 and 32 inch models on the same page it is easy to misread what you are actually getting. Amazon should separate the reviews and customer pictures for each model so that people don't anticipate something that they aren't actually getting. I should have done more research and read the specs from Panasonic's website as well...That being said, it was a $159 set and I really like almost everything about it.Pro's24inch is 1080PGame mode makes picture much better (Picture is sharp and bright)Quite thinLow power consumptionCon'sOnly 1 HDMI input (thought that there were more because of the 32 in reviews)Picture quality and viewing angles could be slightly better (But then again, this is a sub $200 TV)NOT LED (Again the way that both the 32in (LED) and the 24in (LCD) are combined in the same page one would assume that both are LED, but unfortunately this is not the case.)So my advice to anyone considering this TV, buy it as long as you are OK with 1 HDMI and are looking for a 1080P panel.

I bought the 32\" model about 10 days ago, on sale at BestBuy.  In the store, this Panasonic's picture quality easily beat out every other 32\" LED TV on display, including the Samsung 4003 which was sitting right next to it and had a MUCH less good picture. It was also better than the Samsung UN32E5000. I've been just as pleased with the TV at home. The picture is clear, full, rich, but also nuanced--you see subtle shadings that the competition doesn't have.The sound isn't great, but it's good. (It's the 24\" model reviews that call the sound \"tinny\").  The max volume is a little less than I would have expected, but fine for my needs.The TV is ultra slim and well built--backed with a metal plate rather than the plastic you see on most of the competition.

As a name brand with HDMI, LED, and 1080p, I felt it was worth trying out.  My main concern was the confusion from reviewers which result from Panasonic's conflicting specifications (as a result of lumping the 24inch and 32inch models together even though they are significantly different.)1080p - Panasonic repeatedly identifies the 24inch version as 1080p across its website and packaging (box and manual) material, although slightly contradicts this on the website by giving the pixel matrix as 1,366 x 768 (this may be a typo, or intended for the 32 inch.) Anyway, the BIG CAVEAT on this is that the 1080p (if it exists) is not available for any PC hookups, even thru an HDMI connection.  (I proved this to myself by playing a 1080p blu-ray DVD thru my PC, and hitting the Pansonic remote Info button, which relayed I was looking at a resolution of 1366x768.)  Now the picture still looked fine enough, so if you are buying as a PC monitor and getting this TV at a price comparable to 720p competitors, then that's a reasonable way to consider this choice.  But as a monitor, it should not command a premium 1080p price.Now, supposedly based on the manual, if you connect a non-PC source (like a blu-ray player, or perhaps a video game) thru HDMI then you will realize 1080p resolution.  That's the part that seems logicaly quirky to me, since I personally would want a screen size larger than 24in if I was bothering to hook up those type of accessories.  While I'm sure some people like a 24inch bedroom or kitchen TV and want to hook up a Blu-ray player to it (although then you have to deal with the subpar speakers of the TV), I think panasonic's logic to restrict PC hookups from the 1080p means it really limits its audience potential.LED - Again, Panasonic makes this confusing.  On various websites including its own, Panasonic highlights the LED nature of the 24 inch (vs the IPS LED in the 32 inch.)  Yet nowhere on the box or in the manual does it claim to have LED performance.  So who knows on this one.  Again, the imagery generated from my PC looks fine on this \"monitor\", its just a question of what value is this machine worth when one is comparing it to other options which really are indisputably LED.So I'm debating whether to keep or return. (The HDMI is a reason to keep.)

Paasch", "ReviewID": "R3QOR3PSM7DTVS", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Quick note about the set up of our room where this TV is housed. We have this set mounted above our fireplace, which puts it at about 3.5 feet above the eye level of most viewers when seated comfortably, and 9 feet away from the most common viewing angles in the room. It's in a low light room that grabs some ambient outdoor light, but is mostly lit by lamps.Likes:Aside from cost, and brand reliability, off-viewing angles was our biggest consideration when researching TV's. The off-angle viewing angles on this set are phenomenal. Colors, blacks, and picture quality hold up remarkably well when viewing the picture from most any angle. In that respect it really rivals the CRT TV it replaced and puts our Sony BRAVIA KDL-46EX500 1080P 120Hz 46-Inch LCD HD TV to absolute shame.Good color representation. The reds are deep and accurate. Picture quality is crisp, but not overly glossy.3 HDMI and 1 PC portThere are no extra lights left on when the TV is turned off (think power button lights, etc...). I prefer it that way.Slight Disappointments:There are two areas on the right side of the screen that exhibit some light bleed through. It's not the worst I've seen, and it's only noticeable when those areas are pitch black (think letter box).The blacks are very good, but aren't perfect. Very good for an LED/LCD, especially at this price range, but I wish they still made plasma televisions at this screen size.The bezel is black and glossy and a little thicker than it might need to be. There is also a small steel colored strip that runs along the bottom of the bottom bezel. None of this is overly obtrusive, but could annoy some people from a purely aesthetic perspective.Other Stuff:The remote is long and slender. It has just the right number of buttons/functions without becoming overly complicated.There are a fair number of tweaking options for the picture, but other sets in this range offer more choices.Sound isn't great, but given that the speakers are downward facing, it isn't an issue for us in that the set is mounted high and sound is pushed down.Final Thoughts:Viewing angles, colors, black levels, number of inputs, and pricing all came together on this set. We looked at other sets, and while the Samsung 4000 series was very good, even it couldn't match the Panasonic's very generous viewing angles.I'd highly recommend anyone in the market for a 32 inch TV give this Panasonic a look. It isn't a set that is carried by a lot of stores, but was well worth finding one for comparisons sake.

I live in Manhattan, I rely on public transportation, and they told me a) the nearest service center was someplace in the back of beyond in Queens, and b), no, the warranty doesn't cover in-home service calls for 32\" sets because they are supposedly transportable. So my choices are either to schlep it out to Queens on the subway or pay the folks in Queens $90 to come look at a set that I have no guarantee will do its random turning-off thing while the ridiculously expensive service guy is actually in my house.

But this TV definitely does NOT do the job!  The picture is fine.  The audio is intolerable.  It sounds like people are talking out of a tinny cell phone speaker placed about a foot behind the TV.  None of the settings made the slightest difference in the sound.  I have a nice pair of Bose speakers that I used with my old TV, but when I tried to hook them up to this one, I discovered there was no 'analog audio out' port on this TV (the kind that headset jacks plug into).  I went back to searching Amazon and found an inexpensive adapter that would convert the digital signal to analog for my speakers.  (SANOXY Digital Optical Coax to Analog RCA Audio Converter Adapter).  The adapter works fine, BUT the TV volume control doesn't adjust the volume on the speakers and the mute button doesn't work.  In order to adjust the volume I have to get up and adjust the speakers at the TV.  If I want to mute, all I can do is turn the TV off (the speakers don't have an off button).  Also, there's no place to plug in a headset, if you don't want the sound to bother someone else.  Clearly not an acceptable situation.  It's going back and I'm getting a (larger, unfortunately) Sony Bravia that DOES have an analog audio port.  I think Panasonic really screwed up on this one.

I also wanted one which was reasonably attractive.Since Panasonic is well known for it's spectacular plasma HDTV's this was a pleasant, though not entirely unexpected surprise, since I had read Consumer Reports for advise on which brand of TV to buy and they had the highest marks they have ever given televisions ever for the Panasonic Viera line.  I was happy to find the price was so low too for this model.This set looks really good and can be connected to anything pretty much.  And the main thing I love about this is the colors.  I am very particular when it comes to accurate colors and this is fantastically true to life, all the more surprising for such a small set.I like the design of this set very much.  It is glossy black and very simple without any big ugly logo or any other features to take away from the basic, elegant style.  The side panel has the inputs out of sight.  Even the design of the remote is well thought out and ergonomic.  I found that the menu is intuitive also and easy to use.For such a small size, this set has a lot of features.  I have hooked this up to use as a monitor and while I hated to get rid of my excellent Hp monitor, this one shows no downgrade in picture quality, and I can switch over to tv on it whenver I want.  The resolution is perfect and the monitor function works as well as my dedicated monitor.There are several picture options, and the blacks are deep and non grainy.  I have the black level set to light, since I want to see some detail in the shadows and grey areas.  There are all the expected inputs for this and it functions almost as well as any big screen set as far as ways to connect.  I actually can't believe I got such a high quality little set for such a great price.Buying any TV these days can be a big decision but I have had several Panasonics now and have never had any problems with them over the years.  I really love this set and it's perfect for a small room.  Even though we have a lot of windows, I can't see much glare or reflecton either.

It must be the lower end components that are being used.  I have been with Panasonic since 2005 and am on my third.  My other two are arger plasmas.  I started with a $2500 42\" back in 2005 and moved up to the flagship 54\" Z1.  Boy, I wish they still made small plasmas, because I am so used to the wide viewing angle that they provide.  I have this mounted to a wall mount in my kids room.  The problem is that they are watching from a bunk bed at two heights, and the picture looks like hell if it is not in position.  Another oddity is that Panasonic is using down firing speakers in this unit.....probably to keep the bezel size to a minimum.  The sound is poor.  I found that if I cupped my hand under the speaker, it acted as a reflector, and the sound improved 100%.  I am planning on making two deflectors and maybe hot gluing them to the back.

So I really didn't have much choice, but I can't say I'm happy.Pros:- Decent picture, I don't really need 1080p in the bedroom, the 780p is good enough.- The viewing angle is good, although not as good as the old Sharp flat screen it was replacing (surprised me too).- Easy to assemble and set up, was up and running quickly.Cons:- The sound really is not all that good.  It is noticeable worse than the tiny Sharp TV it replaced. I'll repeat that.  It sounds worse than a small 10-year-old TV.- No RCA sound output- No headset output- Soundbars and speakers are all still analog, and won't accept the digital optical sound output, so unless you are using this with a home theater system or receiver (not likely in a bedroom), you are out of luck if you want better sound than the TV provides.Bottom line, good TV for the size if you're using with a sound receiver or if you don't care about sound that much.", "Date": "April 24, 2013"}, {"Title": "Perfect television for the bedroom.", "Author": "Barry K.

My computer is older so the resolution suffered because of a antiquated graphics card.  Screwing around trying to find some drivers for it helped.  I still should have been able to get 1280 x 1024 instead of the 1024 x 768 numbers it set it up as. I do get the 1280 x 1024 resolution after I installed a Windows generic Digital Flat Panel display driver. As a result, I have black bars on both sides of my screen.  So, it looks like the 4:3 aspect ratio of old monitor screens and not the 16 x 9 aspect ratio.  That is fine with me.  Including drivers would have helped, or at the very least on your website.  Before installing the Windows driver, had problems with sharpness of details.  I would say now, things look decent enough.  Make sure to use the auto adjust for sharpness.  This is located on page 2 under PC adjustments.TV is pretty good picture.  Sometimes I wonder if any company ever practices quality control as the time for the shows is always off and there is no way to adjust time through the menu.  Let's say you are watching Wheel of Fortune.  It comes on at 6:30 pm around here.  When you press the info button, or change the channel, it will say Wheel of Fortune 7:30-8:00 pm.  Any show is one hour ahead.  Even when daylight saving time began, the times must have increased one hour also.  Because of the time differential, I have seen it report the wrong show you are watching also.  Most of the time though it gets the show correct, just the time is wrong.  Wrote customer service about issue, it is like they care.  Sorry they say.  With the tv picture I get the full 16 x 9 aspect ratio, unless the show is being broadcast not being able to fill the whole screen. I pick up my shows over the air (broadcast).This is their actual response I got back from their customer service regarding this issue:  Thank you for your inquiry.

Yes, there's a color control, but moving it away from green immediately gives everything too much magenta. I believe I've found an acceptable middle ground or maybe I'm just getting used to it.

While it has good color for $200, the resolution is not as sharp as one would expect for 1080p and in fact this resolution is not available to a device connected through the HDMI. This is important for sports, gaming, or use as a PC monitor (you must sit within 30 inches with 20/20 vision to be able to tell). So, I returned mine (yea, free Amazon returns). Note this TV is no longer made so expect this price not to last.The top selling Samsung UN22D5003 22-Inch 1080p Clear Motion Rate 120 LED HDTV (Black) for $180 makes far more sense for the greater sharpness but I wasn't willing to go smaller (note that 22\" is only 1.5\" less than this 24\" because it's really a 23.5\" TV) and I had a small concern about the lack of any audio out port. Also noted the Clear Motion is not really a 120Hz scan rate.Another option is the less popular Toshiba 24L4200U 24-Inch 1080p 60Hz LED TV (Black) for $225. There are dual RCA sound outs (although I would also like a headphone jack). The Toshiba is also a half inch larger because it's a true 24 inches. I tried this set next (used, very good condition, for $176). Alas, it has the worst sound from the downward aspect of otherwise fine speakers, the power button is the hardest to find, and colors are very harsh (costing me $30 to return).Then, #1 in DVD-TVs is the Toshiba 24V4210U 24-Inch 1080p 60Hz LED DVD Combo (Black) for $260 which not only has a DVD player but by far the best speakers. Who cares if none of these TV supports movies on USB (which would be nice) when this puppy supports DVDs.I had previously purchased a Panasonic TC-L32U3 32-Inch for under $300. I love it but sadly it's no longer readily available (with units now going for $500!). But, there's also last year's VIZIO E3D320VX 32-Inch Class Theater 3D LCD HDTV with Internet Apps for $350 (also supports passive 3D and wifi) but a lot of users complain of reliability issues so I would only buy with the 3rd party $47 4-year extended maintenance. $400 is twice the cost of this TV but I still consider it a better buy. Then again, I think the market for small wireless HDTVs with Internet apps will likely be taken over by the new tablets such as the ASUS TF700T-B1-CG 10.1-Inch Tablet (Champagne), the Samsung Galaxy Tab 2 (10.1-Inch, Wi-Fi), and especially the Microsoft Surface.Finally, if you just want a good 720p TV for watching movies and consider my concerns about this TV as unfounded (say, because you just want to watch movies), you might alternately want to consider the highly rated by CNET TCL L32HDP60 32-Inch 720p LCD HDTV with 2 Year Limited Warranty (Black) for the similar price of $224 (almost $100 less than the 32\" version of this TV). It additionally supports more photo and sound formats.While this TV provides a great DVD movie picture (but with no anolog audio out) and Amazon has it for a good price, I ened up returning mine (as there are several that I consider 5-star alternatives - all provide JPG photos and MP3 sound from the USB). Sad, because I am a great fan of Panasonic reliability (I own three other TVs that are all Panasonic). In October 2011, Panasonic announced that it will further trim its money-losing TV business after already cutting 10% of its workforce. I ended up with the Samsung B350 Series T24B350ND 24-Inch Screen LED-Lit Monitor which goes for $215 at Amazon, $199 at Costco, and $190 at LuckyDogElectronics (where I got mine). It has the best picture for computer text, sports, or movies, better than average speakers, and even plays movies through the USB port (besides having a button and controls on the front of the set).

In fact, the HD quality appears clearer on my Insignia 32 inch TV that I purchased in 2008.  The positives are that colors appear pretty vivid on this Panasonic TV, and the channels load very quickly.Another negative is that the picture on this TV appears as though it bends or drags along the sides of the screen, which is most noticible when the camera shot is panning across a scene or landscape.  This isn't too big of a distraction, but it is sometimes noticible.Also, while the description on this site (as well as on Panasonic's website) says this TV is an LED, the box that it came in, as well as the instruction manual, says it's an LCD, so I'm confused about what type of TV I actually received.  I was aiming to buy an LED TV, so I'm disappointed to discover that it might not actually be one.Overall, I think this is a good TV for the price I paid on Amazon, which was over $100 under the retail price.

You couldn't even turn if OFF on one try...it would repower up when you hit the ON button...5-6 times before you could get the thing to turn off. Google Samsung LCD and \"powers off and on\" and you'll see thousands of complaints and a class-action suit...that only covers older, bigger sets.After no help from Samsung, and replacing all the resistors for $100 at a local shop (where they told me LCDs are coming back in like crazy), I went to this Panasonic LED-edge lit set. Our main set for 20 years has been a 32\" Panasonic and I've always had good luck with them. So after the Samsung fiasco (we bought it while the big old Panasonic was getting a minor repair), I went back to Panasonic with this set (the 20-year-old one is still kicking). Out of the box, it was easy to set up. The picture is fantastic, better than the LCD sets, IMHO, with strong blacks. ONLY flaw that keeps it from 5 stars...something others mention...the speakers are woefully inadequate. I plan to invest in externals as soon as I figure out how to add them. There's no earphones jack on this set, so you can't go that route. There is a \"digital audio output\" plug that takes a certain type of cable to connect to a stereo.

I previously purchased a Panasonic P42ST30 (Plasma) TV from Amazon, and the input lag is more than bearable on that set. I needed a smaller set for gaming in another room, and everyone I spoke to recommended that I stick with Panasonic if my primary concern was input lag. Even though this is an LED-LCD set, I read that the IPS displays have the least amount of lag when it comes to non-plasma TVs, and the size and price were right for me, so I ordered it. Within an hour of plugging it in, I was packing it back up to return it.First off, there is no \"Game Mode.\" The only game mode to speak of is an image adjustment preset (brightness, color balance, etc.) called GAME. This setting does not disable any image pre-processing, and only changes the look. The input latency was immediately noticeable. After looking through every menu on the TV and disabling every image enhancement that I was able to, the TV was still laggy (though not as much). The lack of an actual Game Mode was a huge disappointment. I would not have even considered this TV had I known that the advertised Game Mode did nothing at all to reduce input lag.As far as for non-gaming uses, I couldn't really say. As soon as I discovered how poor this TV is for gaming I decided to pack it up and return it right away.
