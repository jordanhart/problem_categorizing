Thanks to Samsung for offering a Great 720p panel that is sure to be the next big hit for them. Let everyone spend up for 1080, no visible difference to me. Love the swivel stand.

The price was the biggest factor coupled with some favorable reviews on CNET for other Samsung plasmas. I am no \"videophile\" so I can live with 720p resolution. Compared to my 10 year old, 27\" Toshiba it's like seeing a TV for the first time. I have Verizon FiOS digital cable, which has quite a few high definition channels, so I flipped over to their high-def demo channel and I watched programs for hours that \"BS\" (Before Samsung) would probably have bored me to tears. I have a 480p DVD player that I can now watch in 480p, instead of 480i. I dropped in the movie \"300\" and it looked just as good as it did on the IMAX screen (IMO). I bought a component video cable for my Wii (don't forget to change the video setting to 480p) and was simply amazed at the clarity. It's not the most expensive, and some \"experts\" will not consider it to be the best plasma out there but I'm giving myself a big pat on the back. The piano black finish is like icing on the cake.

Great picture, great delivery from Amazon.But then I began noticing 'burn-in' issues. The first I noticed was two vertical stripes, both about 5 inches in from the sides. Then I noticed that CNNHD was also burned in, even though I don't leave it on there for long periods of time. I also have the burn-in protection set, and I've run both the suggested fixes (all white and scrolling) with neither helping.Contacted Samsung and they agreed that it shouldn't be happening. Currently waiting for local repair shop set up by Samsung to attempt a fix.UPDATE... been waiting 3 weeks now... local repair shop says Samsung has backordered a circuit board needed to fix problem I'm having. I just contacted Amazon.com hoping they will just swap this for one that works. I kind of have my doubts on this since Samsung and their local rep have been so slow with any kind of repair.2nd UPDATE... Well, Amazon denied me any help due to the fact I went to the manufacturer instead of them within Amazon's 30 day limit.

The picture was sharpest of any, including many expensive 1080p sets.  As virtually nothing outside of blu-ray is 1080p and virtually all channels are 720p, there seemed no compelling reason to pay twice as much for 1080p.  And I'm very glad I didn't as this set looks great using Dish Network and broadcast HD using an antenna.Also, using a PS3 for blu-ray playback, the picture is tremendous (and the games look great in HD as well).  Upconverted DVDs through the PS3 are also very good looking.  No problems at all with the sound, sync or otherwise.

After calibrating it and getting all my systems hooked up to it, it is just beautiful and flawless.  It looks amazing too! I use it for my PS3 (Blu-ray too!), Xbox, Wii, N64, and Dreamcast.  It does an amazing job making everything look great.  I had two struggles getting this TV:1. Burn in fear - But after much research I have found there isnt much to be afraid of with this TV.  It comes with anti burn in technology and from everything I have read this is a non issue with the newer TV's and can be totally avoided with care (in other words just dont have 20 hour marathons of Metal Gear).2.  1080p vs. 720p - I really struggled with this debate.  I did a lot of reading, talking with friends, and checking with experts.  Long story short...it really doesnt make much of a difference.  It makes a tiny difference but that is only on a few medias and even once it is on all media's it really wont make that much of a difference.  It is only one aspect to look at.  Others include black levels, contrast, ect.  The PN50A450 handles all of these wonderfully.Bottomline...if you are having to watch your budget and you are sitting 7 - 12 feet away from your TV...then THIS is the TV to get.  Shipping on the product was great.  We received this from CEVA shipping and they were great.  They called ahead of time and were very prompt, courteous, and they even took the TV out and hooked it up for us.EDIT: One more thing to add...I have now had this TV for 2 months and still LOVE it.  I downloaded and burnt a break in DVD to minimize image retention.  It is important if you buy this TV to break it in before you allow static images for longer than a couple of hours on the screen.  After you break it in though you should be fine.  I plan on running the break in DVD for a total of 100 hours and will still do things in between running it.  You can get the break in files to burn your own DVD here: avsforums.comEdit #2: If you want another good forum to glean information off from go here: [...]The guys at that board (most of them) are pretty savvy.  Also I broke the TV in and I can see a DISTINCT decrease in image retention.

For concerts and movies this set is spectacular. With proper placement and a little bit of care, a plasma of this size cannot be beat for entertanment value and all the drawbacks of plasmas are taken care of, all that is left is the pluses. The colours, contrast, black levels and features are top notch. Of course, if you only have one set and you want to use it for gaming, sports programming, news, and other programming with lots of static, high contrast graphics, you need to be extra careful, as burn-in is still being reported. how I use it, I don't even see any image retention, even less than on my LCD, or CRT. I don't think pixel shifting is the solution, I don't even engage it most of the time.The set is solidly built, but the speakers are a bit of a let-down. Good enough at moderate level, but a home theatre seems almost a requirement to match this TV.For those in the know, 720p is just as good as 1080p. Cable TV, of course, will not carry 1080p for many years. Just consider that usually blu-ray content comes in 2.35:1 aspect ratio. It does NOT have 1080 lines of vertical resolution, more like 738, each of which this set can display in a zoomed-in, full screen picture (as you SHOULD view it with a plasma). If, on the other hand you want a 50 inch LCD, most experts don't consider them equal to the plasma in picture quality at this size. So there, the extra $500 or more you'd pay for a 1080p is simply for the bragging rights.", "Date": "July 13, 2008"}, {"Title": "Great Plasma TV!", "Author": "Debi K. \"Debi\"", "ReviewID": "R2BUUY6B1FQLDJ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I did a lot of research before buying this product, including reviews on CNET and pricing trends.  I also researched how much difference there would be between the 720p and the 1080p.  Since programs are not shown in 1080p and won't be for a couple of years, that was not an issue.  If you are not a blu-ray disc dvd owner, it also is not an issue.  For me, having this as my first upgrade to a regular TV, I was blown away.  The TV arrived in 4 days even though Amazon stated approx. 10 days.  The TV was packaged well.  As this 50\" was going in my bedroom that has an ajacent wall that is entirely window (approx 10 ft X 8 ft) I was greatly concerned about the glare since I have no curtains of any type.  Well the anti glare coating is perfect and I can watch TV any time of day with no problems.  The colors are great and there are a lot of adjustments that can be made.  Best Buy offers to go out and calibrate the TV for approx. $350. Save your money and do it yourself.  You can spend as much time needed to tweak it as you spend more time in deciding what looks best for your taste.  Definately need to have the cable box for Hi-Def or you are wasting your money on the TV.  The Hi-Def colors and clarity are incredible.  So I couldn't be any happier with my choice of TV and when I am ready for another 50\" for the living room, I will buy the same TV or the 1080p if the price comes down more at year end.

My reservation is that the black levels are poor and the vibrancy of the color suffers. Compared to the Panasonic 50\" 720p (PX80U also about $1000), the black levels aren't even close.The Panasonic however has a very soft picture (not near as sharp).

Like everyone else I had concerns and questions and couldn't imagine what do I actually need and if I can spot the difference between 720 and 1080.I had 2000$ to spend which is enough for decent 1080, but then I saw this plasma for little bit over 1100 $. They say - don't go with the plasma cause it doesn't last as long as lcd. WTF? 8 years they say, 8 years before it needs to be replaced. I'm sure that after 5 I will be shopping around for a 100 inch plasma since technology progress is so fast.Difference between 720 and 1080. If you have regular cable - don't even think about 1080. If you don't watch Blue Ray - forget about 1080. 720 is ENOUGH and more. Even if you plan to watch Blue Ray - you must be the MAN to spot the difference. I could only tell the difference when you put 720 and 1080 next to each other displaying the same image. Otherwise I can't point out anything.I'm using this tv for regular cable and my xbox360. I know - xbox could do 1080 but I had smaller 37 inch 1080 and after switching to 720 50 inch - I see small difference - I could say there is none.Instead of throwing 2200$ for 50 inch lcd I spent 1200 on this Samsung and started building the sound system with extra 800$ left. I got Pioneer receiver and 2xfloor standing speakers + huge subwoofer - everything from Polk Audio. Hey - it is a great way to start your adventure without spending 10.000 $ at once.Really people - read reviews. They help a lot - don't listen to sales people. I was shopping around Circuit City with BB in my hand reading reviews and prices of each model they had - and I finally picked this one.Great picture, sound is average, menu navigation is clear and simple, lots of inputs and outputs and BIG MINUS for delay between tv speakers and tv audio output. If you plug in this tv to the stereo system and leave the regular tv speakers on - you will hear echo. The sound is definitely  not synchronized.If you plan to plug it into your home theater system, then don't worry, but if you don't have one yet - the sound might be a small disappointment.

I was prepared to fork over close to two thousand dollars for a TV until I got the chance to view this set at a local store with a Blu-ray player hooked up. I was instantly sold and felt a bit stupid for having put so much effort into the higher end TVs. Sure they are 1080p with better processing and darker black levels, but was it worth the price difference? No way.  For the money saved over, say, a 650 series or 800u Panasonic, I am now able to afford some much-needed furniture and window curtains for my whole house.The accurate colors in this set really give you a great cinematic experience. The black levels could be better, but they're about the same as you'd see in the theater. With the correct settings, the shadow detail is great and far better than the LCDs I've seen, which seem to lack in this area. I also LOVE the natural sharp image from plasmas in general (720p OR 1080p). LCDs and DLPs always seem to have a smeared/unnatural kind of look to me and always seem to either be soft looking or over-sharpened no matter how much I play with the settings. The lack of motion blur really shows in gaming and movies alike. Again, a very theater-like experience. Plasma is THE way to go, and this TV is the best way to get into it without breaking the bank.I play Xbox360 with this and the picture is sweet. The racing games have a cool arcade-like feel with no motion blur! That alone makes it seem sharper.As far as burn-in goes, just keep the settings reasonable (see below) and you don't have to worry about burn-in. For good measure, I run the scrolling burn-in protection occasionally just to even things out. I went through the break-in with a break-in DVD I got from the AVS forums, do a search. Thus far, I have NO problems with any sort of burn in or even temporary image retention (IR) and I don't bother to stretch letterbox movies to take up the whole screen.For watching standard-def DVDs, I have a Phillips 5990 upconverting DVD player hooked up via $1.80 HDMI cable (all purchased on Amazon). This will squeeze out every last drop of quality from the DVDs. I was amazed at how good the DVDs look with this combination. Still nothing close Bluray, but you will appreciate your DVDs all over again.Then of course, HD content will blow your mind for the price.  For Bluray, I'm using a PC.  For TV, I'm pulling OTA HD digital channels from a super cheap RadioShack UHF antenna.  I find myself turning the TV on and watching the news or Nightrider just for TV eye candy.

But not at this size.If you want amazing HD that is so sharp it will make your eyes bleed...  this is your set !  :)If you want a TV that displays the free HD Cable channels your cable provider provides WITHOUT a cable box... this is the set.If you want a set not too big to still watch your SD DVD collection... this is the set.If you buy products based on proper spec for the format rather than EGO... this is your set.If you don't already own a surround system and want a reasonable cost system...  Buy at least a nice self powered computer speaker system though cause the speakers on this set stink.  I recommend the Logitech THX rated 5500 series DOLBY/DTS surround with optical input. In a small living room this will rock the couch at [...].Amazon's delivery was 2 days early...  called for an appointment...  showed up on time.UPDATE to my update (12/06/08):The lack of 5.1 pass-through from the TVs HDMI input to Optical Output is not a limitation of this TV.  It is a RESTRICTION of the HDMI standard.  One more time the INDUSTRY has limited our choices by selling consumers on NEW interfaces that LIMIT us.  They are trying to force me to BUY a full theater surround system with full function HDMI switcher by limiting the way these devices connect and function.  I guess it's OUR fault for running out and buying whatever crap they sell us.  Had we all NOT bought into HDMI we would still have full quality digital HD Video via DVI connectors with Full Quality Digital Sound via Optical cables without connectivity restrictions.UPDATE (10/31/2008):I almost want to remove a star.  I want to keep my system simple.  Have a PC Media Center and a DVD player connected via HDMI.  TV has an Optical Out so a single connection for my sound from TV to Surround system seems to be indicated for TV, DVD or PC watching.WRONG...  This TV will pass my Cable TV 5.1 digital sound to the Surround system.  But it limits DVD & PC to 2 channel stereo only. I am now forced to have independent sound connections to audio system.  Every time you change a source you need to do it twice.  This just should not be the case.  The HDMI should carry sound to the TV and TV should pass it through the optical interface that I paid for.WORK AROUNDS...  Buy a HDMI switcher that I should not need to buy.  Or buy a programmable remote and spend two days setting it up to run all my devices and teach it to change video source on TV and Audio source on Audio system simultaneously.BOTTOMLINE...  The TV should allow digital sound to pass through the HDMI to the Optical Output on the TV.  Why they thought passing through 5.1 for a cable TV channel matters more than passing through digital audio for our HD & DVD sources is beyond my understanding.

They carried the (heavy) TV where I wanted it in the house and asked me if I wanted it unpacked. I did so they carefully unpacked it, installed the base and carried away all the packing material. I don't know if this is standard or not. I was expecting them to drop it onto my porch after signing for it, to be honest.The instuctions were very easy to read but you really don't even need them. The TV on screen menu takes you through setup and in just a few minutes, I had an excellent picture just through \"over the air\" channels. After hooking up cable, I couldn't believe it. I was in TV heaven!I went with the 720P version of this HDTV after realizing that Blu-Ray and digital TV have a long way to go before the coolest technologies come out to market. Besides, Consumer Reports rated this model at the top of the 720P models available and it's a Samsung. I figured this would not be my last HDTV so I decided to save some money now. I wanted something that would provide me with an excellent picture up to 1080i while I waited for the HDTV market to mature.I cannot see what the draw is for re-purchasing all your old movies again in Blu-Ray format when most people wouldn't even notice the picture difference between 1080i and 1080P. Instead, I decided to up-convert my huge DVD collection (with my $36.00 up-converting DVD player) and wait for Blu-Rays to be available for a buck from Redbox. By that time, the cost of the players should be down to $50.00 or so.The picture quality is truly remarkable even at 720P. I have friends with 1080P HDTVs and I believe my picture is clearer and brighter than theirs and quite frankly, any TV I have seen. There is a glare issue. You'll want to install the TV with that in mind but I don't think the problem is any worse than it was with the old style CRT TVs. You just notice it a bit more because the screen is so much larger.I can't speak for reliability because I have only had it a couple of weeks but if it's anything like all my other Samsung LCD products, I'll be very happy. So far, all the research indicates they have worked out all the of the problems associated with the original plasma HDTVs.

Don't spend it all on the TV. Take into account a surround sound system, a good surge protector (many come with insurance on whatever is plugged into them) and HDMI cables. Also get a warranty, is it worth the extra money to protect your big investment.2. Get cheap HDMI cables. Digital cables transmit a 0 or a 1 opposed to analog which transmits much more complex signals. This means that the quality of the cord has absolutely no meaning since interference can not happen. So long as there is a connection the worst will work as well as the finest. Places like best buy will try to rip you with this be selling extremely expensive HDMI cables, buy them online in advance.3. TVs looks smaller in the store, look online for the best inches for your viewing distance.4.

Of course it stays on until go through the same process again but at least it is there. I am enjoying this tv very much, have no problems with burnin, and feel like I got a good deal. Delivery might have been a bit quicker as it sat in a warehouse in Indianapolis for a few days but when it did arrive the guy helped me put in down in my basement and waited until I opened the box to see that it was not damaged.

I never realized that these colors could be so vibrant, it certainly makes watching a program more enjoyable.We bought the floor model at BestBuy for about $800.  I was toying with the idea of getting the 1080, but opted for the 720p based on a review we read, and when we compared the 1080 to the 720, neither one of us could see a real difference, and didn't feel it was worth the extra $700 for something we couldn't see.We have full light in the afternoon, and put it to test to see if we could still see the picture.  It wasn't a problem at all.  We saw the picture clearly.  I like that we can zoom the screen so we don't have to see those black bars that most movies have, and the swivel base is awesome.The volume is great, I had it on level 6 and could here it pretty well, and it has a speech mode so you can emphasize voice over other sounds, for those who may have a hard time hearing when the background noises seem to blend with the voices.At first I thought it may be a little to big for the living room, and it did take me a bit of time to adjust my vision to it, but i've gotten used to it.

If you play games, you will get a little burn in that is cured by using the TV's scrolling burn in tool.  For the first couple of evenings you will want to leave the TV in burn in scrolling mode while you sleep.  This will \"break it in\".  From my experience, TV's become exponentially less susceptible to burn in with hours.  If you do get a little this will fix it.Don't think that burn in is specific to this TV, it occurs with all plasmas I have used.There will be a light on the front that is annoying at first, but can be managed with the settings menu.Of course if you are using 50\" plasmas you shouldn't expect the speakers to be any good (and they aren't).  I wish they didn't come with speakers because you should have surround anyway.The service that Amazon uses to ship is excellent.

The glare is a non-issue.  The anti-reflective coating is great.  Also, I come from a CRT, which had a glass screen, and the glare is better than on that tv (Sony WEGA).  The burn in will not be an issue if you run the scrolling feature for the first 200 hours (or just watch HDTV programming that does not have a static image).  There is also a free DVD download that you can download at avsforums.Not sure what else there is to say.  I've seen some of the best LCDs out there and they simply do not compare to this plasma.  Maybe in a few years, but not yet.

I don't have a surround sound system yet and when I first got it there were a few shows where the sound was a little buzzy.

I've upgraded from an HDTV ready Panasonic 32\" CRT TV which was great but this is more than a step up.  There's only one thing...The audio coming out of the rca stereo audio output is not in sync with the sound from the plasma's built in speakers.  I have a Sony DHC-ZX50MD mini hi-fi component sound system that I generally use as a sub woofer to supplement the sound out of tv's speakers especially when watching movies for that dramatic effect.  I've had this setup since 2000 or so and have had no problems with out of sync audio.  Now that I've got the Samsung PN50A450 in place, I have this out of sync audio issue.  I double checked the settings on both the Samsung plasma and on my Sony sound system but there is no adjustment options for audio time shifting.This audio delay is occurring on all inputs used on the plasma too.  I have digital over the air antenna on the TV input, a Nintendo Wii on the AV1 input (composite), a sony 5-disc progressive dvd player on the component 2 input, an AppleTV on the HDMI1 input, and a DLO home dock deluxe on the AV2 input (composite).  The delay is the same no matter what input is used.  The delay is like a chorusing audio effect.I contacted Samsung via phone (800-SAMSUNG) on Sat 5/10/08, explained the issue, and the representative said she hasn't heard of this issue before and that there wasn't any firmware available for the Samsung PN50A450.  She set me up for an authorized service center to come and check out the plasma display.  She also said that the servicemen would more than likely be able to fix this audio issue on the spot and probably not have to return the tv for repair or for exchange.I then registered my plasma on Samsung's website and saw that the plasma was manufactured on March 30, 2008.  I bought from PC Richard in New York on 5/5/08.  Got it setup on 5/8/08.  Called Samsung for repair on 5/10/08.  The Samsung authorized service center was supposed to call me today, Monday, 5/12/08 but instead I got a call from someone at Samsung this morning suggesting that I make the call to the service center, which I found odd.Hopefully they will call me to set up a time to check out the tv, and if not I'll call them at some point this week and let you all know how this tv and the Samsung's service people work out.I really hope this is a small, fixable issue and not a widespread issue in this model.", "Date": "May 12, 2008"}, {"Title": "Internal Speaker Problem", "Author": "W.

We had purchased a 3 year warranty for the TV (something I rarely do), but I'm glad I did.  The TV was purchased at Circuit City, and the warranty is through Assurant Solutions, who set up a warranty repair with their \"local\" service provider.  Assurant had set up a date for the repair, but the date came and went with no one showing up.  I called the local service provider who said they did not have the parts.  He said they would order the parts and call me for an appointment.  More than a week later I called them again and was told they had the parts and would be at my home the next day.  Again, they didn't show up.  When I called the service provider told me the service crew was working in the opposite direction from my home and could not make it.  They promised to come the next day.  The service manager came the next morning and told me that his crew said my job was \"too far away\", so he ended up coming.  The speakers he brought were both left hand speakers.  He had to modify one of them for the right side, but it still vibrated.  Now, I'm waiting for him to come back another day.", "Date": "September 23, 2010"}, {"Title": "Good picture for the money, but worrying about burn-in is a PITA", "Author": "E.

The instructions are unclear (probably because they are written by the Japanese). It took me ages just to figure out how to operate it. Finally, I figured out that the plug needed to be inserted into the electrical outlet. It didn't say that anywhere in the directions!When I turned it on, i discovered that it only gets one channel. Every time I plug it in, I simply get a loud \"FFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFF\" sound and a bunch of black and white stuff that moves quickly around the screen. My friend calls this phenomenon \"white noise\" however, I can see black in there too. It is my estimation that this is probably some show about a swarm of files.I also have reason to believe that this device emits harmful radiation. The label calls it a \"Plasma\" T.V. As everyone knows, Plasma is a state of matter in which gas becomes ionized. This is similar to the state that creates nuclear fusion within stars. Because of this plasma, this device most likely emits harmful gamma radiation! I looked closely at the T.V. and discovered that it says \"made in china\". This plasma added by the Chinese is likely a communist plot to render the people of the United States sterile.One plus is that it doesn't use the vacuum tubes that my old T.V. has. It's also much larger and thinner.In the end, I recommend this product to people that enjoy watching flies, and enjoy self sterilization.", "Date": "March 14, 2009"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "Unavailable", "Features": "720p HD Resolution\n1,000,000:1 Dynamic Contrast Ratio 30,000:1 Contrast Ratio\n3 HDMI Inputs\nFilter Bright Anti Reflective Technology\n3D Ready for 3D gaming", "Name": "Samsung PN50A450 50-Inch 720p Plasma HDTV", "ImgURL": "http://218.201.42.40:8080/ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51aS-Vv-AQL._SY300_.jpg", "ProductID": "B0015AV3XM"}}
