I use this TV for my bedroom and it is the perfect size for the space available.  The preconfigured settings are a bit out of whack, but after taking 5 minutes to adjust the color and brightness the picture quality came out as crisp and clear as the 40\" I use for my living room.  The DVD player was an added bonus considering that at the time of purchase the non-DVD model of this TV was more expensive ($286 v. $300).  Because of it's size this TV should not be used as a primary TV, but if you need something for a bedroom this TV is the way to go.", "Date": "June 21, 2011"}, {"Title": "Quite good for the money - one gripe I have...", "Author": "C.

My one gripe and it may seem trivial but I often have the set on mute while watching sports and this is the only TV I think I've ever had that leaves the mute notification, which is rather large and right in the bottom middle, on the screen indefinitely which often blocks the scores of the game I'm watching and is just plain annoying, that's all. Maybe I'm being picky but to me this is a design flaw.", "Date": "October 11, 2011"}, {"Title": "32\" lcd", "Author": "always remodeling \"john\"", "ReviewID": "R1RFDAV65UOINA", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "very good tv for the money, at under $300 you can not beat this set. nice picture, I am very pleased, also came in only 2 days from shipper.", "Date": "July 13, 2011"}, {"Title": "RCA TV combo", "Author": "chickengranny", "ReviewID": "R187PM79JFCN50", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Great product and great service!
