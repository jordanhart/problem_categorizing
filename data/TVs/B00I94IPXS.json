The factory settings on the TV are decent but you can make the picture look EXCELLENT if you tweak the settings to your liking. The picture is crisp and clear, making anything you watch way more enjoyable. The sound is also exceptional! It has the potential to be very loud if you put it on the \"Amplify\" setting which is located in your menu settings, and the speakers are in the back for those of you who are wondering.As for the reviews about the apps not working, I did not have this problem. It seems that a lot of those reviews occurred awhile ago so they might have fixed that problem they were having. I turned the TV on and there was an update & everything works perfectly fine!As for gaming, this TV is the best you can get at this price and anything below it. The input lag is 88ms but when you put it on PC mode it reduces the input lag to 44ms. If you don't know what input lag is, that is the half second delay when you're playing a first person shooter when you move your character. Input lag throws your game off and literally makes you worse than you really are ha-ha. For those wanting to know how to put it on PC mode, all you have to do is switch the input to the HDMI port you plugged your console in and when you select it you have to click tools on your remote. When you click tools on your remote, click edit name and then you should see where it says \"PC.\" Click on that and BOOM, no more input lag and your video games run flawlessly. You really only need to do this if you're playing first person shooters though because you can't tell the difference on any other game really unless you're a gamer who has never seen sunlight.I did a lot of research on this TV, so I tried including everything I was concerned about to assist others in making their purchase. To be honest, this is a great TV in my opinion. It is an affordable price, and the picture is beautiful!P.S.  For those of you who are looking to mount this TV as well, the VESA on the back is 200 x 200. It was very difficult for me to find that online so I hope I helped you out :)", "Date": "April 23, 2014"}, {"Title": "No Buyers Remorse!!!", "Author": "Jim Frye", "ReviewID": "R1PDTJDRZMUJNL", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I love it!  The delivery company delivered and set my 55H6350 this morning.  What an amazing picture.  I couldnt be more happy with the picture quality.  I have read reviews about people who diss this tv because of the Slow Apps or Poor Sounds.  In my experience so far, the apps and web browser ARE slow but I have this TV connected to an Asus Chromebox and use that for web browsing and all apps.  So the smart features wont be used by me.  The built-in speakers sound okay to me.  Nothing spectacular but nothing horrible, just average.  However, I am using the Optical Out from the TV to my A/V Receiver and all is well.I found the following calibration online and seem to really enhance the picture to provide true colors.Picture Mode  MovieBacklight  15  <---- increase if in a bright roomContrast  95Brightness  46Sharpness  14Color  50Tint  G50/R50Advance SettingsDynamic Contrast  OffBlack Tone  OffFlesh Tone  0RGB Only Mode  OffColor Space  Auto10pt White Balance  OnGamma  +1Expert Pattern  OffxvYCC  OffPicture OptionsColor Tone  Warm2Digital Noise Filter  OffMPEG Noise Filter  OffHDMI Black Level  Normal (Low if available)Film Mode  OffAuto Motion Plus  Off10pt White Balance  ONPicture Size  Screen FitSo after 4 hours, I would recommend this tv to Anyone.

Farr", "ReviewID": "R2BRM26ZZWSXT7", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I purchased this Samsung to replace a 5 year old Sony led tv that had developed screen problems. The difference between the picture quality of this Samsung and the Sony is shocking. The Samsung is sharper with far more color range and depth. Black levels are excellent and this from a tv that weighs far less than the Sony. You don't get an owners manual with this tv to describe all the functions and controls so you will need to set up internet access to use the e-manual or to download it to your computer. Connecting to your wi fi is easy but to be honest I cant seem to access any of the apps such as Netflix or Vudu and I don't have a wireless keyboard to evaluate surfing the web. The tuner in this tv is also receives roughly 20 more stations off the air than the Sony did. I cant say if the 5 year difference in the TV's is why it is so much better or if it is some Samsung \"magic\"...I can just tell you that you wont regret buying this tv!", "Date": "March 13, 2014"}, {"Title": "Best TV Ever!", "Author": "Gerald R.

For this price-range, I have no complaints and think 5 stars is very fair. That being said, there are some nit-picky flaws which I've made note of.Pros:- Smart features are great.- Has a beautiful picture.- 120 Hz is awesome!- 0.3\" bezel makes the TV itself looks great.- Blacks are, indeed, very black (sometimes it looks as if the whole TV shuts off when it goes to a black screen).- Plenty of inputs.- Easy to set up.- Network features are nice.- Great price.- Games, DVDs, and Blu-Rays all look fantastic.- Semi-matte screen is a nice touch (especially if you have a bright room with windows).Cons:- Viewing angle isn't a perfect 180 degrees. You'll notice some (MINOR) loss of quality if you are sitting to the left or the right of the TV. That being said, I watch it from the front and the right side and it's not enough of a big deal (or noticeable) to take away a star.- Note: Unless you plan on spending thousands on your TV, most LED TVs have this issue. There is a very, very slight \"blotchiness\" in the screen. I only notice it when the screen fades to completely white (otherwise you honestly can't tell) and really, it's hardly noticeable in the first place and again, not worth taking away a star.  The reason why this happens (or so I've read) is because the TV is so thin, the actual LEDs are pushing against the panel, causing the effect.Overall, I'm very happy with this TV and I highly recommend it. The problems I mentioned were so trivial that you might not even notice them, but I felt that they were worth mentioning, anyway.If you want to save some money and settle for a little less, this was my second choice of TV as it's similar in design and assortment of features, http://www.amazon.com/Sony-KDL48W600B-48-Inch-1080p-60Hz/dp/B00HPMCNXIOther than that, I don't really know if it's actually any good.If something comes up to change my mind about anything, I'll be editing this review.", "Date": "March 26, 2014"}, {"Title": "Samsung H6350 VS Vizio M-Series", "Author": "JB", "ReviewID": "RDRMUGOWNNPWX", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I left this in the question section and wanted to add it to both TV reviews for everyone to see.I just purchased the Vizio M401i and it was delivered 3 days ago, it's already going back in the box and being sent back. None of the VIA apps that stream from the net worked even when I am connected to my wireless network and using the test function for net getting 15MB down to the TV, but I know for a fact that it was able to connect to their server and download the firmware for the device. I called Vizio support on this and the technician was reading from a script and had no insight on actually how to fix the problem other than to do a full reset then refer it to the second level technicians. LOL everything with their support was a joke, I spent over an hour on the phone to no avail, and I'm very tech savvy so it was a complete waste of time. The Vizio also will not connect correctly to the ZYXEL NAS320 that I have on my network hosting media content with movies, pictures, and music. It will not recognize any content on the device even though it sees it on my network and does not support common file extensions like MKV, MWA, or AVI. I did extensive research only to realize that I would have to run all my content through a converter and make them MPEG4 before this would stream them across the network.I will admit the picture on this TV was good and I'm doing OTA tv and that was fine. The main reason I bought it was to get Amazon Prime content in the bedroom and to access my NAS for movies, neither of which the Vizio will do. I have a Samsung D8000 series in the living room so I have a good comparison source which will do everything I have mentioned above and more, only the 2011 models don't have the Amazon app. This one is going back and I will be purchasing this Samsung. The Vizio will save you a little money but for me $140 just isn't worth the extra aggravation that I've had to put up with. You get what you pay for and this is another example of that. As  soon as I get the refund for the Vizio I will be having this one sent to me.Update: Return complete on the Vizio and I have purchased the Samsung H6350 and had a couple days to work with it. It's like getting out of a Ford Fiesta and getting into a GT500 Mustang. (That's for all you guys out there ;-P) Picture is in my estimate is 20% better so even though the Vizio has a very good picture this one is better, very feature rich including Channel Guide that even works with OTA reception and Set Top Box controls plus full network support for connecting to my NAS and other DLNA compatible devices. Network is fast and reliable as well, streamed BluRay movie from both the NAS and Amazon Prime without any hiccups and flawless picture, sound is slightly lower but I don't really expect perfection from 2@10W speakers just turn it up 4 or 5 more and it's very adequate.Did have one issue that came up but it wasn't a major problem, network was found but wouldn't join I'm assuming because of the drivers of the wireless card. I run a WPA2 network with AES encryption and ended up putting the password 6 or 7 times trying to get it to join to no avail. I went to the router and turned on my guest network with no encryption, hopped on it and updated the firmware then no more problem got connected to the secured network first time. The onscreen keyboard is a qwerty keyboard and navigation is somewhat cumbersome but expected since the remote doesn't have a full keyboard like my F8000 Samsung does.In conclusion you get what you pay for, the Samsung was about $150 more than the Vizio but well worth the money in my opinion. I'm a techie and worked in the computer field for over 15 years so I am very particular about my electronics and computers. I was trying to save a few dollars by purchasing the Vizio and while it is fine for doing just the bare minimum for TV and has some Smart features there is no comparison to a quality Samsung product. I bought the M-Series because it was supposed to be the most feature rich between it and the E-Series only to be disappointed in overall performance and functionality. Samsung has more than met my expectations of a Smart TV and what it's capable of as far as the bells and whistles was a nice bonus.", "Date": "April 21, 2014"}, {"Title": "Great TV Great Picture Great Price", "Author": "F.C.N.Y.", "ReviewID": "R1US6ZRQLZMPGP", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "For a couple weeks I was trying to decide whether to buy this new model the UN48H6350 or the pricier one above it, the UN48H6400, I compared specs, there weren't many reviews for either TV, since both are new 2014 models, but since the UNH6350 line is supposed to be Samsungs \"budget\" line of smart TVs I compared and decided that it was not worth paying an extra $300 for the UNH6400,I didn't need 3D or a fancy remote or the \"Micro Dimming\" (software to improve black level) that the UNH6350 lacked.I decided on and purchased the UN48H6350, it was delivered fast, Amazon shipped it via UPS but I'm sure had the tv been the 50\" or above models they would have used their good big ticket item delivery services.I've had the TV a couple weeks now and couldn't be happier...the 48\" size is perfect, the screen and very thin bezel look classy, but most of all, the picture is absolutely fantastic with great black levels and soo sharp that regular HD looks almost like 3D but without needing glasses and the screens anti-reflection ability is great too. The Smart TV features and apps are very good, the integrated wifi is also very good.I noticed that the price had falled a week after I bought it, I submitted the price match request and Amazon came through and was great, refunded the difference withing 24-48hours.My suggestion, if you are also debating purchasing between the UNH6350 and UNH6400 and you don't need or want 3D or a voice activated remote (that the UNH6400 has) and want to save some money...This is the model to get...hands down...it has everything else, along with a good price.", "Date": "April 4, 2014"}, {"Title": "Great picture, Netflix & other apps don't work, stand is garish...", "Author": "Susie", "ReviewID": "RRBCHPGO1HAJL", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "We just received this TV on April 4th. My initial reaction was flimsy packaging, lightweight TV and all plastic (including the stand) construction. The chrome finish stand is horrible. It and the small chrome band running along the bottom of the TV is reflective and totally distracts your eye when viewing a program. This is especially true in the dark as it reflects the light from the screen.  Connections are simple enough and setup was straightforward. There is no paper manual and the e-manual on the screen is awkward because you can't simultaneously read it's instructions AND make the necessary adjustments in the on-screen menus. Also, the \"eco sensor\" keeps dimming the picture and then it will spontaneously snap back to bright again. This is very annoying but the feature can be turned off (if you can find the menu option to do so-it's in a drop down submenu offscreen).  However, my major disappointment was the smart hub. Not one single app worked! Every app was grayed out and when you tried to select one it simply responded by saying \"This function is not supported\". I can use the browser so I know that my internet connection is sound. It's definitely a firmware/software issue. After 5 hours of setting/resetting every possible variable the Samsung techs finally concluded that a service tech needs to come to my house and investigate the problem hands on. They then told me that I had only 1 month left on my warranty. When I told them that I just bought the TV today they insisted that I needed to send them a photo of my receipt to prove it before they would extend it until April 2015. This despite the fact that my serial number told them that it was just manufactured in March 2014!  I had sworn off ever purchasing a Samsung TV again after buying a Netflix ready set back in 2009 only to find that Samsung did not acquire the necessary licenses from Netflix and so that app never worked for the life of the TV (which subsequently died just out of warranty and would have cost more to repair than to buy a new one). Now I'm afraid that I am in a similar boat with this TV so I will more than likely be returning it for a full refund. If you are buying this TV for the Smart features (Netflix, Pandora, Hulu, etc.)I'd wait to see if they can get them to work properly and consistently. As for the stand I guess you could always sand it and paint it black but that seems to be a little extreme for a brand new TV.", "Date": "April 5, 2014"}, {"Title": "Froze during initial setup, turns off and on...", "Author": "Pak-Man", "ReviewID": "R30VBAW4IZAK0Y", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "This review is for the Samsung UN32H6350 32-inch 1080p 120Hz Smart LED TVAesthetically, this television is beautiful. The moment I turned it on, I was fascinated by the vivid colors. Too bad I couldn't get through the initial setup phase...During the initial setup of the TV, I was being guided through the steps. At step 7, the TV asks you for your zip code to identify local service providers. I tried to input the zip code, but the TV was not responding to the remote control. Moreover, I started noticing the TV was turning off and on by itself. I saw the TV was frozen at step 7, with a two arrow icon moving circularly. I tried turning off the TV, disconnecting the cable from the wall, then turning on again, but the TV image returned to step 7 with the loading icon still there, frozen.I called Samsung's customer service and a representative simply suggested that I return the product, or get it exchanged.

We called Samsung Customer Service and they sent us a new one for free.  So far, so good, but it would have been nicer to have a remote that didn't break in the first place.In Mar 2014 the TV developed an irregular power cycling problem, typically when we used online applications like Netflix, but also when watching cable.  It would cycle a few times a day and the go a week without failure, and then start power cycling again.  By April 2014, it became so severe that rendered the TV unwatchable.  That's where the real fun began.We called Samsung Customer Support.  They ran us through the rigmarole of trouble shooting: check the firmware version, check the power connection, watch the power indicator flash, etc.  Unable to recreate the problem in the span of a 5 min call, the representative declared the TV in fine working order and threw me off the line.  Naturally, the TV entered a power cycling frenzy immediately after the call.  I tried Samsung's online chat function.  We repeated the troubleshooting process.  This time the representative declared the TV defective and suggested a repair under warranty.  Wouldn't I please fill out the online service request referencing the trouble ticket number?  Certainly - but alas the website wouldn't record my data.  Tried again.  Still wouldn't record my data.  Called Samsung again, referenced my trouble ticket number.  The representative insisted on repeating the troubleshooting process for a third time.  I complied, but the TV interrupted troubleshooting by power cycling in the middle of it.  Would I please restart the process again? No, I would not.  Representative insisted we inanely repeat trouble shooting indefinitely.  I refused.  Representative put me on hold to 'talk to a manager', returned and insisted on continuing with the troubleshooting.  I refused and asked to speak to the 'manager' myself.  The 'manager' was not available to speak to me.  This exchange fecklessly repeated several times until some unkind criticism compelled the representative to agree to schedule a repair ten days in the future.

I've played some Xbox 360 games and also watched some HD movies on the 360's HD-DVD add-on and everything looks quite nice. I had feared that I wouldn't be satisfied with the black levels and for months I had considered purchasing the $1,800 Samsung 46F8000 because of that concern. That model has micro-dimming at the hardware level and according to CNET the blacks are exceptional for a LED HDTV because of it. Because $1,800 is a hefty price for a 46\" TV I waited months for a good sale on that model but it just never happened. In the end I decided that $1,800 was too much to pay and went with this one instead. No, the blacks on this model are not a perfect inky black but really no LCD/LED HDTV I've seen so far does black perfectly. But the blacks are pretty good for a $850 edge-lit TV (Edit: Turns out this set is back-lit. Amazon says it's edge-lit but CNET says it's back-lit.

I was surprised to see that even with my good eyes I was only able to make out very slight screen disuniformity in bright scenes. Every LCD has imperfect screen uniformity, but this one's a cut above. Color accuracy is nearly perfect and contrast is handled extremely well. The best way for a layman to measure contrast is to compare off pixels to the bezel when there's a dark scene on. Older flat panels using CCFL backlights could never produce \"true\" blacks as there was always a faint glow from off pixels. This is still true for LED backlit models like this, but to a much lesser extent. This set can produce pixels nearly as black as the bezel to where it can be difficult to tell where the screen ends and where the bezel begins. Not a perfect black like an OLED, but close. Well done Samsung.Some have complained about the sound being flat, which was confusing because last year's similar model was touted as having above average sound for an LCD even though both models have 10w speakers that are down firing. Judging by photos, the H63xx has an even larger speaker housing. Now that I've heard it, I can say the sound is a little flat depending on the source. Other times it sounds great. It turns out there is an equalizer with five(!) tuning meters, which I assume represent low bass to high treble. Seems the presets aren't properly calibrated, which isn't suprising. I would recommend you play around with the equalizer depending on the source. Should get it sounding great. Of course, if you're using external speakers, none of this will matter.The Smart features are suprisingly well implemented. Apps respond quick thanks to a quad-core processor, setup was easy enough, and the Smart Hub interface is easy to navigate. A far cry from Smart TV early days where slow and clunky was the norm. I'm trying to think of a complaint as I type, but I can't find one. TuneIn can sometimes be slow to load station lists. That's all I got.It has a very thin bezel, less than a half inch. As for the stand, it's design is subjective. I think it looks nice, but I know for some people the chrome finish might be distracting and the quad leg design might seem odd. It is a bit wider than the traditional sqaure stand, so you might need to make some room if you're not wall mounting.For gamers, enabling game mode will reduce input lag to a tiny 30 ms. Yet another great aspect in addition to 4 HDMI ports one of which is ARC capable and three USB ports (Do I really need three? lol) Overall, I'm very impressed with this set; the quality engineering really shows.", "Date": "April 6, 2014"}, {"Title": "UPDATED.

Hill", "ReviewID": "RXDCX10KBZE8M", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "I purchased this tv almost a month ago and have been evaluating it since it arrived.  I use an antenna and was very pleasantly surprised when I set up the 6350.  The tuner in this thing is fantastic.  We eliminated the cable about 7 months ago, put an antenna in the attic, (don't have to deal with weather conditions that way).  With our old tv, a 10 year old Panasonic, we had to use a set top box to convert the antenna signals for the tv.  It was a good setup, but nothing compared to what happened with this new Samsung.  The old tv would get about 62 over the air channels, the 6350 pulled in 85.  Not just more channels, but the quality was much, much better.  I think Samsung has done a fantastic job on this tuner.  After editing out channels, home shopping club, QVC, etc, we kept about 45 of the channels, and they are all perfectly reliable.  The next thing I tried was the browser.  It works, although somewhat slow, but it did everything I wanted it to do.  It's not a desktop or laptop, so don't expect a lot as far as speed goes.  We also hooked up a Logitech wireless keyboard and mouse through the usb.  That helped a lot, don't even think about trying to use the remote on the browser, it is extremely frustrating.  Hooking up to my network was somewhat of a chore.  Finally got that to work, so I can use the picture, music, and movie files on the network.  That works good, once you figure out how to configure the network devices.  That was the most frustrating thing with this whole setup.  It's not the tv, it was figuring out all the sharing settings and permissions on the computers I was trying to share.  Yikes, I threw my hands up many times trying to get that to work.  The only two things that I found to be problems that are related to Samsung are the speakers and customer service.  The speakers are really poor.  I finally purchased a Samsung soundbar, HW-FM45C with wireless woofer.  That matched up perfectly and really improved the sounds.  Hooking that up was somewhat of confusing, it should have been very simple, but for some reason I had problems getting the correct cabling in order to use the tv remote for all the controls.  Works now though, great.  Customer Service is the only thing that I couldn't work around.  If you have simple questions, their book gives simple answers, but throw in a couple technical terms and you loose them on the first try.  I called asking questions about the codecs that the tv will recognize and they couldn't get past what input I was using, hdmi or usb.  When I tried to explain to them that I was on Ethernet their answer was, \"That's not Possible\".  So after a couple frustrating hours I decided to find out for myself what I needed to know.  Only took about a half hour to do myself.  So, final summary, we really enjoy the tv, for now it's the best for the price.  You can spend a whole lot more money and maybe get more gadgets, or spend less and use the savings to purchase a dedicated computer to hook-up to the tv. The only other thing I noticed was the apps that are available.  Maybe I was doing something wrong, but I couldn't go to google play and get any apps that would work on this tv.  It is loaded with a lot of apps from Samsung, and they are all free.  Just that there are a couple apps that I would like to have that I couldn't get.  I'll keep looking into this and if I come to a good or bad conclusion, i'll update this review.  This is an update::  To me, the web browser is just about useless.  I think Samsung is trying to reinvent the term ssss llll oooo wwww.  It does work, but 15 minutes to load google play??  I finally quit before it finished.  A hdmi cord and a laptop might help.  Update again.  5/30/14.  The tv started turning off intermittently and then turn right back on, all by itself.  It goes completely powered off and then clicks right back on.  Has happened to me 4 times in the past two weeks.  I spent 2 1/2 hours on the phone with Samsung customer service, impossible to get thru to them the problem, their final solution, unplug the Ethernet cable and try it for a couple weeks.  This is a smart tv, unplugging the internet is like removing its brain.  Why in the world would you want to have a smart tv and then remove the smart functions?  As a result of this I have lowered my star rating, even though it is a decent tv, I can't justify anything higher than a two due to the support from Samsung.", "Date": "May 2, 2014"}, {"Title": "Buying through Amazon is the only way to go.", "Author": "J.

Will be interesting to see how it performs during the summer when my house temperature climbs into the mid-80's.I'm sure someone will experience a similar issue so I'll mention it;  I originally set the TV up to use with my newer MacBook Pro.

The picture is OK after properly setting up the unit (noise filters must be on to get any decent image).  By no means is it as good as our other plasmas but those are higher end TV's bought for a different purpose.  The viewing angle on this is really poor.  I could not recommend it for anything other than straight on viewing.  Connectivity is very good with several I/O options on the back.  Aesthetically a nice looking TV as well.  No, the speakers on the TV aren't the best but they are serviceable.  There is the ability to define a wall vs. stand mounted configuration for the audio and that does help.  You should really be driving a soundbar or other external audio setup anyway so it shouldn't be an issue but the TV speakers can be used for casual viewing.The real problem with this set is the smart TV feature.  It isn't just that the interface is clumsy and monotonous to navigate (which it is).  The kicker is the anemic content options and nearly useless web browsing feature.  Perhaps most frustrating.(and why we returned the TV), is Samsung's policy related to 3rd party apps.  One of the primary reasons we bought this TV was for it's Pandora compatibility. After 2 weeks of streaming Pandora through the app on the TV, it just disappeared.  Contacted Samsung only to be told that SAMSUNG HAS DISABLED THE FEATURE!!  At first the Pandora icon was removed entirely, now it's present but you cannot use it (error message displays).  The Samsung customer service rep said they were aware of the issue and that it impacts the following models: H5500, H6300, H6350, H6400, H7100 and H7150.  They were 'working' through it with Pandora and cited a \"content partner certification\" issue.  It was working fine, they turned it off for bureaucratic reasons and are in no rush to fix it.  There's no technical problem, just their \"policy\".Best advice I can give you is to not lay the cash out for a Samsung Smart TV.  Stick with your Chromecast/Roku/Wii/Apple TV or any other 3rd party interface.  If Samsung is going to pull this kind of stuff, there's just no reliability in uninterrupted service for the content you may want.  We ended up returning the TV and bought another Apple TV box for a new Panasonic.  As a consumer there isn't too much more you can do to voice your displeasure with a manufacturer.

Hoping for the best...The picture is nice on the TV though.To describe my issue: My TV wireless adapter isn't seeing any wireless networks at all. When you go to network setup and select wireless, it searches then eventually gives up without an error message. I question whether this may be a firmware problem and not hardware, because it did detect wireless networks on a couple of occasions on earlier revisions. However, it has consistently been unable to detect wireless networks since I updated to version 1110.I have noticed on a few occasions while in setup that the screen would go black and the TV wouldn't respond to the remote for a couple of minutes. Patience or power cycling would lead to resolution. I did mention it to Samsung in a couple of my calls, but didn't force the issue because it was inconsistent. I'll figure this one out later, or hopefully it'll get resolved in another firmware update.***Update***Repair replaced main board Friday. It had other issues as well that were intermittent like lost picture a couple of times, and being nonresponsive to remote for minutes at a time (light would blink quick when you attempt).

We were ready to upgrade to the 50-55\" range and started looking at different TVs. We compared the specs and learned a sufficient amount to not feel clueless.This TV, as opposed to the older 6300 from last year, has a quadcore processor. If you will be using the Smart functions or other options this is the reason for the price difference. We want this TV to last at least 5 years and so the extra power was worth the additional cost.The picture is crisp and the adjustments / presets are very functional. You should be mindful of lighting in your room as this TV is very reflective. It doesn't seem to have any glare reduction. Be aware that it might annoy you. Try to position the TV in the best location to avoid glare.Those are the simple positives. It's a competitive price. It has good upgrades and functionality. There is a remote included (at least mine had one) and there is also a small joystick on the lower right-hand corner. Click it in to access the menu without the remote. There is no voice (that I'm aware of), and it wasn't advertised to me as having voice. Purchased at Best Buy.My biggest complaint, and the reason for the lack of that fifth star is the sound.I have been trying to find a happy medium with the sound of the television with no avail. It seems echo prone and the sound is very flat. It has caused several ear aches thus far.This seems to be isolated to myself, and not the rest of the family so it is manageable. This may be caused by my tinnitus or other neurological problems. If you have some similar issue this might not be the television for you. It really affects my enjoyment of the television... which I am quite upset with. It really is a remarkably clear and refined picture compared to Vizio, LG and the like.

After putting the stand assembly(which swivels)  on the TV unit and plugging in, they start a step process to get everything running. And one of the things that came up early was getting the remote working to control my receiver from Direct TV. I wasted a lot of time because the instructions just keep telling you to give it another try in order to get a response from the receiver. So I exited from that and proceeded to get the TV online where it was a 'dumb' TV basically. Then I tried with the apps for Netflix, Amazon and Mgo, which are the places where I might rent movies. All did good after I went through the sign-in. I stopped for that day, and resumed early the next day. As I powered up the TV, I received a message from Samsung that an update had been sent, and also from my DirectTV provider. I also noticed my cable box wouldn't transmit a 1080p resolution because I was using the component jacks instead. So after re-connecting to HDMI1, my picture came in like never before! And then re-tried the remote control on my DirectTV receiver, and now it worked just fine! I should comment about the sound, because my old HDTV had the problem where when I played a HD dvd, the output volume was so low I had to buy an amplifier and speaker set for a boost on the sound level. Well, the quality of the sound from this unit is very good, but the same problem exists for a dvd playback. So, a sound bar is probably in my future. There was a couple other features mentioned on the Amazon site for this series model about voice commands and hand signal recognition. I didn't need them, but it is not on this model anyway.(need to go to 6400 series) Overall, I have to say the picture quality is terrific and , for now, makes me happy with my purchase.--Update 4/22/14-After a week or so, the only problem I encountered is the \"anynet+\" feature which is supposed to let me control any other Samsung device with one remote. I do have a Samsung BluRay player, and it did control it as claimed. But it also added some kind of quirk where it reports to the TV every 10 min or so, and in the process blacks out whatever you're watching until the select button restores it. Don't know the reason yet, but I turned off that feature and it has worked well without it.", "Date": "April 13, 2014"}, {"Title": "Worth it", "Author": "ghinds80", "ReviewID": "R1GVBV0DRF8OZY", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I got this LED TV for my new apartment so I can watch high quality program images.

When spending $1500 for a TV, it should have Blue Tooth capability. Without it maneuvering through the browser is very difficult as you cannot use a wireless keyboard. I worked around it by using a USB wired keyboard, but after spending that much money, it should not be necessary. I have the 6350 model and only models above 6400 have Blue Tooth. I can understand not having their smart remote included, but at least give us the opportunity to buy our own wireless keyboard.The picture on the Samsung UN60H6350 is excellent. In the end, that is why I purchased the TV. Audio is much as you would expect; with so little bezel there is little-to-no space for a decent speaker. Figure on using some kind of external audio. In my case, I used a Samsung HW-FM45C and it works very well with the TV. I can actually hear the Game of Thrones dialogue now.My satellite receiver was identified by the TV and I can now control almost all of the video, audio and STB functions from the Samsung remote. That said, I will never completely get rid of my four remotes (one for Apple TV, smart TV, sound bar and the STB). My situation was a bit different than most. I am using Shaw Direct, a Canadian satellite provider, in the US. When setting up the smart remote to ID the satellite receiver, it wants to know your zip code so it can bring up all of the cable/satellite providers in that area. Shaw Direct was not there, but, after some help from the remote assistance group, the receiver was identified and I am now able to use the smart remote for most of the Shaw Direct functions.If you get stuck on something, the remote assistance function is excellent. You get them on the phone, obtain a pin number from the TV and at that point a tech takes over control of the TV and can do any necessary trouble shooting. A really excellent time saver to have someone with extensive knowledge of the TV and system have direct access to the Samsung TV. I am very impressed with that service.All-in-all, despite the lack of Blue Tooth, I recommend this TV.", "Date": "June 7, 2014"}, {"Title": "A great tv for the price", "Author": "Josh", "ReviewID": "R3TTBDJ905587K", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This Smart TV is worth the investment.

No expedited shipping available, even if I was willing to pay for it.They could send out a service technician, but I would have to pay for that since it was considered installation.

The audio quality however is only so-so but I have a sound bar and sub woofer that compensate.  The only issue I have is that I have not yet been able to get the audio to play through the optical output on any of the Smart Apps.  This is really annoying because Netflix and Amazon Prime are both lower volume than normal TV and the internal speakers are OK but not great.  I have an older 46 inch Samsung from 2011 and it's the same way so I guess they still haven't fixed it.This TV is still a very good purchase at the price point considering I paid over a grand of my 2011 model when it first came out.  The quad core processor in this TV makes the response times on the apps and menus very fast.  The built-in wireless works and I was able to get connected to my wireless network during the initial set-up. The wireless doesn't pick up the SSID of my network from 2 rooms away so I had to move my wireless router.  I think this is an issue with the wireless card in the TV because I have a good signal on my laptop in the same room.I have DirecTV through HDMI 1 but I also did a channel scan with my OTA antenna which worked perfectly.  The system updated itself to the latest version of the Samsung operating system automatically and I have not had any of the reported problems with locking up or powering off.

Looks like a battery gauge, and thought it might be battery level for the remote. It's not. It's showing you how much power this set uses verses a conventional TV. It's not in the manual, and Samsung's website will tell you what it is after a deep search, and also that you can not disable it.- The other Eco features I like. The auto brightness adjustment seems to work well. You can tailor it to your preference.- Just like Samsung's phones, which I love, you can not delete unwanted bloat-ware apps.Navigating the internet is annoying.

Right-angle cables or adapters are a must if you want to mount the TV as flush with the wall as possible. In addition, the fourth HDMI jack, labeled PC/DVI, is the only one that enables the TV's lower-lag \"game mode.\" That completely baffles me, as every other TV I've seen that had a game mode, including other Samsung models, allowed it to be enabled on any HDMI port.2. The component/AV jacks are either/or: Initially, my plan was to attach a PS2, a Wii and a VCR to this TV, as the TV it replaced allowed such a configuration. Like most newer TVs, the composite and component connections are shared: the yellow composite video cable plugs into the TV's green component jack, rather than having its own dedicated jack. However, once the TV detected a blue and red component cable connected, it disabled the AV input completely, saying that option was no longer available. So much for the VCR.3. The screw holes for the TV mount are hard to fit: I'm not sure if this is more a fault of the TV or the mount I bought, but the two sets of screws included with the mount were either way too short or way too long. I ended up using a hack saw to trim the longer screws down to size.4. The TV is thick: I know this is Samsung's 'entry-level' smart TV and this is admittedly a pretty minor nitpick, but at almost 3 inches, this set seems to be a bit thick for an edge-lit LED LCD. The more expensive, but otherwise very similar H6400 is almost a half-inch skinnier than this set, which makes a noticeable difference if you're going for that flush, painting-on-a-wall look.", "Date": "April 23, 2014"}, {"Title": "Applications Require Firmware (not yet developed)", "Author": "Susannah Scherer", "ReviewID": "ROFWRRGKKJNVI", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "After doing some research I finally bought the Samsung Smart TV.

In the past, I've always gone to an electronics store and compared the picture quality of multiple TVs.  The process always left me hesitant and second-guessing.  I decided to take a leap of faith by ordering this TV online, 100% based on online reviews.  Samsung was highly recommended by almost every reputable internet publication I read, various forums, and user reviews.  Aside from the amazing picture quality, the speakers sound good overall.  I usually leave the volume between 15-25, but the TV can go as high as 100.  Sound comes out clear and crisp;  even at high levels.  In summary, if you are not a sound connoisseur, it will be better than adequate.  If you are one (like me), you probably already have a separate sound system with a sub-woofer that would wake your neighbor.Unfortunately, I don't use the \"Smart-TV\" features very often.  If you have a PS3/X-BOX, PC, tablet, smart phone, ect., within the same room, you'll find many of these features largely-well,  useless.  In retrospect, I would have ordered a television without these features and would have saved a reasonable amount of money,The universal remote got mixed reviews.  Within the first month, I found it to be particularly fickle.  Only through trial and error did I stumble upon the appropriate solution.  The instructions state that the IR-Extender should be placed within 4 inches from cable-box's infrared receptor.  I found this to be untrue. There was no physical indication on my cable-box as to where the receptor was located.  Based strictly on experience, it is usually located somewhere behind the plexiglass that displays the time and channel.  After locating the so-called, \"sweet-spot\", the remote works great.  Having to switch remotes to watch TV is in the past.  Bottom line- keep the IR-extender directly in front of your cable-box's receptor.  Don't let objects come between the remote and box, the closer to a 180 degree angle of openness between the remote and receiver., the better.In closing, I'm very happy with the video and audio qualities.  The rest of the features, are amusing for about 2 minutes 30 seconds.  This LED delivers where it matters most, everything else is added fluff.

I'm not sure who these people are, but attaching the stand/set-up were extremely easy and a handbook WAS included.  The on-screen set-up also was very easy.  As for the smart-tv icons, again I'm not sure what these reviewers were talking about.  Once you click on the icon (i.e. for Pandora) and enter your existing account information, the screen tells you to go to their website (address included) and enter a \"tv-specific\" code.  Once you do that, you are immediately linked and the operation on the set is easy.  Similar for Netflix.  Surfing the web is still something that smart-tv's have to do a better job with, so not a reason to buy this set (or any others that can surf the web).

Joyce", "ReviewID": "RRM3OEWUBK031", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "Sorry, folks! Wrong model - our TV is the UN40F6300 - not the UN40F6350. I'll try to move this review or delete it. VERY SORRY!!!We've had this TV for nearly a year, and have loved it. Great picture, intuitive navigation, and excellent \"smart\" features.However, we use an antenna to get TV and WiFi connected to our Verizon DSL. The DSL provides 1.86 Mbps downloads, not upgradable unless we want to replace copper with Verizon's FiOS fiber optic network (which I have in my work location and will not use at home because of Verizon's VERY nasty business practices and pricing over the long term). Using the DSL, we have had excellent access to the Internet for Netflix, HBO GO, Amazon Prime, TED, etc.This whole system has been working fine. Until now...This month's firmware update is nearly 700 MB. Still downloading the update (I think/hope) after 4+ hours. Contacted Samsung's \"Live Chat\" for help last night (somewhat useful), and they said not to interrupt the download or the install. So, left it running all night in the hope that it would finish downloading and install during the night. Instead, after about 3 hours of downloading, it apparently went to sleep for the night, like we did.So, if you have a slow Internet connection like we do, you will need to sit by the TV to hit volume on the remote to wake it up and keep the process running when the TV goes into sleep mode.Samsung provided NO warning that this was such a gigantic update - the biggest they have done since we bought the TV last summer. They should either warn people about the size of the update or break large updates into smaller chunks.If I had the chance to do this over, I would refuse the update - the TV was working just fine without it.Now, I'm keeping my fingers crossed that after the download is completed (IF that is really the problem right now), the install goes well and the TV is as usable as it was before.So, if you buy this TV, be very cautious about the updates! The TV has been unusable to us for nearly 6 hours so far...-------------UPDATE:The update did not complete over night, so I reconnected with \"Live Chat\" via the Samsung website, and the tech recommended that I unplug the TV for 30 seconds, plug it back in, and do the update via a USB thumb drive. That worked! But NOT like ANY of Samsung's online \"help\"  or instructions said it would. I downloaded the Zipped file using my PC (Mac not recommended by the Live Chat tech or the instructions), and unzipped it onto the thumb drive.[While the instructions are PC-centric, I don't think the TV really cares how you get the update file onto the thumb drive. So, I bet a Mac would work fine.]HOW TO UPDATE THIS TV USING A USB DRIVE:One set of instructions said to turn off the TV, and the other didn't specify. Once you have the update file on the thumb drive, this is how the update  worked:1. Turn off the TV.2. Plug the USB into 2nd port from the top in the back of the TV. There are 3 USB ports, each with a different name on it, and Samsung doesn't tell you which one to use. The top one didn't apparently work, but the 2nd USB port from the top DID work for this purpose.3. Turn on the TV.4. Wait 30+ seconds before clicking on the \"MENU\" button on the remote. Don't click sooner than 30 seconds after the TV is turned on, or you won't get the right menu options!5. Navigate to the \"Support\" option.6. Choose \"Software Update\" from the Support menu.7. Select \"Update now\" from the Software Update menu. While it LOOKED like that option meant it would go back to trying to download the update from the Internet (wasting time and not working), instead it accessed the USB drive and popped open a dialog box indicating that it would take a little less than an hour to do the update.8. In less than 1 hour, the update finished. The TV was not usable while it was doing the update, but the dialog box tells you what's going on and how much longer it will take to complete the update.9. When the update was completed, the TV turned itself off and then back on.10. We turned the TV back off, and removed the USB drive. Then, we turned it back on.BINGO! Update complete! And the TV is working fine, and the picture is even better than before (brighter and more clear).Samsung needs to provide better instructions online - clear, consistent, and up-to-date. The TV works fine, *when* you have useful instructions.", "Date": "May 7, 2014"}, {"Title": "Software clunky and buggy", "Author": "RichardNYC", "ReviewID": "R1AT926ENPZR93", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "Purchased this to replace an older \"dumb\" TV that had failed.  I already have a good AV setup with a multimedia Yamaha receiver, speakers, and a diversity of sources (e.g., AppleTV) so didn't need the \"smart\" features, which are just another player on the field in the scrum fighting to serve me up content.  But I figured I might as well get the 120 Hz so anted up to the higher price for this one.  Mistake.The smart features turn out to be a pain.  First thing that was a pain was the eco mode which dims the TV when the light is low.  This engages in our setup because the TV is in a cabinet and apparently there is some shadow in the cabinet that confuses the feature.  The manual goes to the trouble to tell me not to put a coffee mug in front of the TV because it confuses the ecodimming, but does not address the more plausible and common situation for people with cabinets.  While it ought to have been simple to navigate the menus to disable this for me it required a bunch of digging around through manuals and menus to finally figure out how to turn this off.  But then, that night, the TV did an auto-update of the software, which changed the setting back on, so the next day when my wife and kids were watching, they were squinting to see the picture since it was again auto-dimming, and they were clamoring about the broken new TV and how I had to fix it first thing.The user interface to the smart features is also junky.  Blank boxes appear on the home screen without their image for various app icons.  Using features requires signing up for more Internet media account (samsung.com, DivX, ...).  Other icons (e.g., Pandora) don't respond when clicked; not clear why, I didn't bother to investigate.  Moving on, within one minute of trying the web browser, the software in the TV had crashed, showing black yet backlit screen and not responding to remote.  It required physically unplugging to get it to reboot.Another odd thing about this TV is that the universal remote actually involves snaking some included long wire and IR transmitter from the TV to sit 4\" in front of the main AV source (e.g., the cable set top box) and shine at its IR remote input.  While Samsung apparently couldn't be bothered to invest in software development make their software solid, they have invested to engineer this Rube Goldberg system even to the point of having the TV use my entered Zip code, cable company, etc. determine the right protocol among the possible zillions for the TV to control the cable box.  This is too weird.  It kind of makes me think of a hand reaching out of the TV to change the channel on the set top box.  And I don't have 4\" of shelf in front of my cable.  And its incomplete.  What about controlling the other half dozen sources that I have from that remote.  Samsung might eliminate one remote for the set top box, but I still have 5 others.  Marginal value.  So I ignored it.Bottom line on \"smart\" - you probably don't want to use the smart features since they the are clunky (any cheap Blu Ray DVD will give you all the smart features you need for free, better implemented), don't work, crash the TV, and, you can't ignore them (e.g., auto-updates resetting configurations you set).All in this TV looks like it was going to be a \"pest\" reaching out and trying to be the controlling AV platform in the scrum among content platforms, and since it is the last step before my retina, I wasn't going to be able to turn it off and ignore it.I set up a return and I am purchasing a cheaper dumb TV.If you are thinking of getting Smart Features, I would recommend you get a dumb TV and invest the dollars you save in an AppleTV, Amazon FireTV, etc.", "Date": "April 6, 2014"}, {"Title": "BEWARE: HDCP not supported!!", "Author": "Valkyrie Rider \"Dave\"", "ReviewID": "RNVLLT3KG3GZK", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I have this TV and it worked fine for about 6 months, then I began to get the error message \"HDCP not supported\" and all we got was snow on the screen.

I called Samsung support and they told me it was the cable provider problem, so I called ATT U-verse and they told me it was the TV problem. I'm caught in the middle with no HDMI connectivity. I finally had to connect via component and that seems to solve the problem, however this is a new TV and should support HDMI (HDCP) protocol. HDCP is a protocol used to stop people from recording programs, but the only recording we do is with our DVR, so its a mute point. I understand that cable companies have to work with TV manufacturers to make them work together, but in this case they have not and we, the customer, pays the price of them not doing their job.

Guess I am not reasonable.Samsung does have a website for help called SPOT. Misnomer - should be called NOT. Not friendly, not helpful, and NOT a place you want to go after being on hold with the service desk on two occasions for an hour (after they accidentally cutoff the first one and did not call back).I also tried the online \"help\" and it informed me that a \"ticket\" had been formed. Site then loops and never says what happens next. Will they call? Does the Ticket fix the set? It is a Smart TV....is it smart enough to use a ticket and heal itself? Has to be smarter than the folks running service at Samsung...... because it at least has sound.I gave it a star.....sound works and since the initial service date they set is a month from now it is an expensive backup to our stereo ....which works because it was made by the other S company.", "Date": "April 15, 2014"}, {"Title": "No Netflix. **AVOID THIS PRODUCT IF YOU'RE LOOKING FOR A TRUE SMART TV**", "Author": "REDSAND", "ReviewID": "R35HZBQKDJP62A", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I bought this strictly for the ability to use Netflix.

He mentioned it would have cost $1000 for the repair (replacing 2 circuit boards) if I was paying for it. It took him <3 minutes to switch the boards. The TV worked again. Now 2 years later - same problem. I called Samsung. They very politely told me that I was screwed. They would not fix the TV, provide parts or even a provide discount on the repair or parts despite the fact that it was the same problem the TV experienced 2 years earlier.
