Audio is merely adequate even after adjusting the sound settings. The \"swivel\" base is a joke. The base is glass which is screwed from the underside of the base to a plastic stand and then onto the tv. The screws protrude just enough that it scratched the table top that I placed the tv on when I attempted to swivel the tv. I had to place a cloth under the base to prevent further damage and make it easier to move.", "Date": "October 14, 2012"}, {"Title": "Awesome picture quality", "Author": "Ben Eastman", "ReviewID": "R16PR6V9JZAAY1", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "The picture is crisp.

It was a bad idea soun quality is at max a 4 out of 10 with 1 being static and screams and 10 being anglic sounds. There is a lot of motion blur even after atempting to fix it. Picture quality is pretty good I say a 7 out of 10 but the color scale is messed up. There is no real black only a dark gray. To play games you will need to constantly change the color and brightness of the tv.There is also a bright spot in the center of the tv which annoyed me. The auto set up is pretty good kinda slow but still easy for set up..If you must buy this Tv buy a sound system with it or else it will sound like a tin can.For me this is not a good tv for watching Tv and it is worst for trying to game with it.

In other words, it's not a full LED television. I don't understand the difference completely, but I reviewed the ad again, and nowhere did I see the word LCD. However, I was initially pleased after first hooking up as the picture seemed pretty good. Understand though that I'm one of those that can't hardly tell the difference between blue ray and DVD, so take that with a grain of salt. Then, the next thing I noticed is that the volume changes at the speed of snail which was really quite annoying. But, thought I could live with that. Then after just a few days, a vertical blue line suddenly appeared on the screen, and never went away. So, I promptly decided to return the piece of junk, and bought the Toshiba 24L4200U. I feel sorry for those that find all this out after the 30 days. This is the second time now I've bought an RCA television product, and both times have ended in disappointment. So, I'm done with RCA.", "Date": "May 2, 2013"}, {"Title": "Did not last long", "Author": "Sonia Anca", "ReviewID": "R1RSSZ389784N5", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "Bought in December not working by April buy the warranty if you want this item.

Sadly like other companies that is no longer the case.I feel if your competing in the marketplace RCA should pioneer in quality and make a quality product and a sturdy stand.Picture quality is decent for this price range but I can no longer stand the flimsy screws or stands. They should preassemble and prebuild these sets and ship them out so the customer does not get frustrated and make it bigger and better but then I figured the price will go up and then I would of looked elsewhere.It is because of the brand I bought this set and I'm not disappointed with the size and range of options.
