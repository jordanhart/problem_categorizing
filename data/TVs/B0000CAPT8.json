{"Reviews": [{"Title": "A thing of beauty!", "Author": "PL \"PL\"", "ReviewID": "R2EAAB1KQ16CK0", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I bought this television because I am extremely limited on space in my bedroom.  I was hesitant at first due to the price, but no regrets.  Here's the lowdown:Pros:*Outstanding picture quality.*Several connectors for multiple in/output options.*Excellent design and solid construction.*Speakers provide clear sound - no distortion when turned up.*Wires/rear connections are well concealed.Cons:*Wall mount option requires a fairly expensive bracket.*Remote control is basic and funtional, but looks like a putty knife/spatula (not bad, but kinda weird looking).I love this television - definitely worth the $$$. I've got a Toshiba SD-4900 DVD player hooked up to it - excellent combo!", "Date": "November 15, 2003"}, {"Title": "Nice for the Price, But...", "Author": "Kate Perez", "ReviewID": "RO0SOCPI2X3DM", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "This TV has great sound and picture quality. I love how lightweight it is, and it's perfect for a tight space. The base allows you to adjust the vertical and horizontal angle, so you can angle the TV up & down depending on where you've got it in the room.  My biggest complaint is the noisy power supply unit.  It makes a consistent high-pitched ring tone when the TV is off.  Sharp says this is common with all electronics, but I've never heard it this loud on any of my other equipment. Because the TV is in the bedroom, the ringing keeps me up at night. We've even had it replaced with no improvement, so now I have to unplug the TV every night. If you have sensitive ears, this TV may not be good for your bedroom.  I've got a Sony 42\" flatscreen downstairs that doesn't make this annoying noise at all.", "Date": "February 5, 2004"}, {"Title": "Just bought one and am THRILLED!", "Author": "Barbara Madaras \"Barb in Albuquerque\"", "ReviewID": "R2YQVET4PICPY1", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I'm so thankful I didn't let the cryptic bad reviews of this product deter me from my instinct to purchase it.  The picture is fabulous - the colors are incredible, the picture crisp.  The sound is excellent.  Plus all the other features (weight, portability etc) mentioned in other reviews.  We have no problems with a noisy power box - and I was ready to hear something based on some previous comments.  So perhaps Sharp has fixed that issue!  We simply couldn't be more pleased - and the price can't be beat!", "Date": "September 12, 2004"}, {"Title": "Perfect for small area", "Author": "Justin", "ReviewID": "R3GX6AQ81YYM60", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I received my 20\" Aquos yesterday.  I was sceptical because I got such a great deal on it but was pleasantly surprised by the slim profile, modern look, and portability.  I originally planned to put the unit on a reticulating bracked but I love the stand so much that I put it on a glass shelf instead.  The picture is great but I would suggest using component video or s-video since the co-axial cable doesn't bring out the full potential of the LCD screen.  The sound is slightly tinny but that's to be expected from such a small output.  Overall, a great buy and I will definitely suggest this TV to anyone in the market for a smaller LCD display.", "Date": "October 7, 2004"}, {"Title": "Great for the bedroom", "Author": "Gadgester \"No Time, No Money\"", "ReviewID": "R14U3YNY4IYI80", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "If you are looking for something for the living room (i.e., as your main TV set), 20\" just won't cut it.  It's just too small for today's modern human eyes.  For a typical living room, the minimum TV should be a 37\" Panasonic plasma set.  42\" is another good choice, although for most people 50\" would be an overkill.This Sharp 20\" NTSC TV is perfect for the bedroom.  It takes up very little space on the nightstand, and it sports sharp and high-contrast image quality, making watching TV pleasant rather than eye-straining.  This model is not widescreen, but that's ok for me because at 20\", widescreen would have made images too small for me.  This model is also not HDTV, but rather EDTV (extended definition), which it means it fully supports progressive-scan DVD playback.  Hook this up to a progressive scan DVD player -- I have the super-compact CyberHome model I got at Radio Shack for $45 -- and you'll get some great-looking DVD movies in your bedroom.As a secondary TV for your bedroom or kitchen or study, this Sharp delivers great quality and great value.", "Date": "September 27, 2004"}, {"Title": "WOW!!!
