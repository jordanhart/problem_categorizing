{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Samsung LN-19A330", "Author": "T. Earle", "ReviewID": "R1M5EXIM7TUY3C", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "Pros: A fairly decent set.  Easy to set up and get going.  Very sensitive analog and digital tuners.  Good picture.Cons: Don't buy this set if you use an outdoor antenna with rotator.  The set does an \"autoscan\" to acquire and memorize all analog and digital channels with the antenna pointed in one direction.  If you rotate the antenna to another position, you can manually enter analog channels into memory from the remote's keypad, but NOT the digital channels.  In order to view the digital channels at the new antenna heading, you must perform the \"autoscan\" again... takes about 2 minutes... and the \"autoscan\" erases and replaces the channels memorized from the original antenna heading. Verified this performance issue with Samsung Tech support. Verified this flaw with sets in two dealer showrooms with Samsung HDTVs.  No solution available.  Sony and other sets worked fine for manual digital channel entry.  This is a serious drawback for an otherwise good set.", "Date": "May 17, 2008"}, {"Title": "Good little TV  update", "Author": "Leonard G.

Non HD are not very good.  Audio is OK.  Over all a good TV if you need one of this size.  I suspect they may be a little over priced.Update:  We have had this TV for almost 2 months and like it better all the time.  Picture quality actually is excellent on all over the air digital and HD,  We only use it with attic antenna or rabbit ears.  Audio is actually very good.  It is built sturdy and yet very easy to move around form kitchen to patio.  We could not be more satisfied with this little TV !", "Date": "June 19, 2008"}, {"Title": "Just a great little TV. . .", "Author": "G.

Even in full sunlight, the picture on this 19\" Samsung LCD is perfect.  We have an older model of the same TV in our guest bedroom, and the difference in the newer model is clearly visible -- brighter screen, more intense contrast, and the color is significantly more vivid.  It is the perfect TV for a small room.", "Date": "June 10, 2008"}, {"Title": "Pretty good TV, but it has viewing problems", "Author": "Dallas Deb \"Dallas Deb\"", "ReviewID": "RGG9BK84GC8RT", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "This is a pretty good TV.  It looks nice and has good features.  The sounds is great.  The delay time when changing channels is better than on my other flat-screen TV.  The picture quality is very good -- that is when you are right in front of the TV.  Once you go to the side or lower than the screen, the picture QUICKLY fades to black.  I got this TV for my bathroom & mounted it on the wall.  I frequently cannot see the picture -- fortunately since I am not really watching TV for any length of time in the bathroom, it is not a huge issue for me.  However, you want this for a bedroom, make sure you will be viewing from eye-level, directly to the front of the screen otherwise you may not be happy with this set.", "Date": "September 23, 2008"}, {"Title": "Pretty decent but a little expensive, remote not so great", "Author": "Mitch Haile", "ReviewID": "R3B841JHN030K4", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I am pretty happy with this TV; I've had it for about 2 months.  The TV takes up very little space and is lightweight--wall mounting is easy.  The built-in speakers are pretty awful though.  Sound quality is about the same as an iPhone's built-in speakers.Component video from a non-upconverting DVD player looks pretty good.  The TV has one HDMI input.Perhaps my biggest disappointment was the remote:  I had hoped the TV remote would be useful for controlling both the Samsung TV and a Samsung DVD player--but the remote doesn't have controls for anything other than the TV.  This means either accepting life with two remotes or buying a separate universal remote.Strolling through Best Buy lately, I've seen comparable TVs for significantly less money.  I'd recommend shopping around more than I did--I feel that I paid a little bit too much for what I got.", "Date": "August 30, 2008"}, {"Title": "Very good choice for small room", "Author": "1542", "ReviewID": "R2JEFWUPV0DL0J", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "This is a very good budget LCD TV for use in a kitchen, dorm room, small bedroom.  720p resolution is perfectly fine for a TV in this size (19\").  The colors and picture look great with a bit of calibration (I found the default settings to be a bit too bright).  There were enough A/V connections for me, although the audio from the built-in speakers is only adequate at best (but what else can one expect from a built-in audio system?).  There are other models, both from Samsung and others, with more bells and whistles, but if you're looking for a good basic small LCD TV, this one is definitely worth considering.", "Date": "July 6, 2008"}, {"Title": "A little more $, but worth it!", "Author": "managerjohn", "ReviewID": "R1M8SPUBE63LBM", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I recently got this little HDTV on sale at Target for about the same price as amazon is offering it right now. It is a little more expensive than some of the other brands in this size, but well worth it.It is solidly made and doesn't feel flimsy, like some of the cheaper 19\" TVs I looked at did. The display is bright and crisp and in side by side comparisons, blew the competition away. The shiny black finish is very attractive also.I primarily use this as a computer monitor and gaming TV. It makes my PS3 games look fantastic! Virtually no setup; plug and play. The display looks great right out of the box with minimal tinkering.Overall, I have been very pleased with this HDTV.", "Date": "August 25, 2008"}, {"Title": "Great value and very easy to use... for the most part.", "Author": "D. Barahona", "ReviewID": "R2SNYAMJIDBCNG", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "We have been using this TV in my daughter's room for over a year now without any problems at all.  We got my 3 year-old this TV because we didn't want the worry of her potentially pulling her former, heavy 19\" tube-television onto herself.  Aside from the fact that this TV is light weight and thus very portable (and non-life threatening :), it is very easy to use as she turns it on/off by herself.The only criticism is that there are no actual buttons, in the traditional sense, on the TV itself.  There are the symbols for Power, Volume, Ch., etc. and when you touch the symbols, they perform the function.  Easy enough to do but they should be back-lit.  Without the lights on, it's very hard to find any function except for the on/off button which is the first one from the bottom up.After months of my daughter mixing the remote with her toys, my wife and I have developed the motor skills to just \"know\" where to touch the TV now to perform whatever function we happen to need.  But it was a bit of a nuissance in the beginning.We currently have it connected to our Comcast cable box and a DVD player.  The cable is non-HD and connected via a coaxial cable and the image looks great, not grainy or pixelated.  The DVD player is non-high def. but connected with the 5 component cables as if it were high def. and the image quality is very sharp.I uploaded pictures of the buttons and screen images of cable and DVD.", "Date": "November 17, 2009"}, {"Title": "Excellent TV", "Author": "C. dupuis \"Cindy\"", "ReviewID": "R1A1KCECNUJGAL", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I think this TV was a great buy for my bedroom.  I do not see the halo that someone described.  I also can go into the menu and bring up the sleep timer using my remote and I don't find that difficult at all.  I was not aware about the base being able to mount to the wall and so that was a nice \"Freebee!\"  The base mounted very nicely to the enclosed brackets and so I have a TV that can be used in the bedroom and I can carry to another room if necessary very easily.As for the picture and sound.  Both are just fine and I had no problem navigating the settings putting the picture size, sound equilizer and quality to my preferences.  The TV auto programed very nicely and there were no channels that I needed to adjust.  I do have cable FYI.  I have two other LCD's also and I have no problems with this TV.

The Samsung got such good reviews, and there really isn't a lot to choose from in a 19\" LCD that was under 16\" tall (to fit under my kitchen cabinets), so I chose the Samsung.  I like everything about it pretty much except for the audio sound.  The speakers are coming from the back of the TV and it sounds very tinny and echo-y.  I'm so used to the phenomenal sound of the Sony Wega (which they do not make anymore) that I'm having a hard time getting used to the lower quality audio of the Samsung.  I didn't go with the Sony Bravia 19\" because of the little stand that is used to prop up the TV and the reviews were low because of that.  I'm seriously considering, though, rethinking the Sony Bravia.  It's far more expensive, another $80-$100, but I was well-compensated from the extended warranty that I purchased with the original Sony, that the price really isn't a factor.  The Sony Wega was a perfect specimen of what a small LCD TV should be...too bad Sony discontinued it.", "Date": "November 29, 2008"}, {"Title": "Excellent tv for a little space", "Author": "Read for Pleasure", "ReviewID": "R1U9O5Y9TLH98H", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I have to enter a caveat for my review upfront--we're a minimal technology family tv-wise--we just watch VHS and DVD.  We had to upgrade from a 13-inch picture-tube tv from the early 90s, though!!  This tv fit the bill.  We're really happy with the crisp picture, the sound, and the size of the screen vs. how much room it takes up--a lot of picture for a little footprint.

If you do a search on Samsung LCD TV's, you will see that others are having the exact same problem.  The problem is with the capacitors.  Samsung knows this is a problem and will charge you shipping plus a service fee of $50 and tell you that they will fix it for free and refund the $50 IF it is determined that the capacitors really are the problem.  The problem with that is that they can tell you pretty much anything they want once they receive your TV and you aren't there to verify or don't know enough about electronics.
