Ordered this TV from Amazon (had shipping issues but not amazon's fault so won't get into that)Upon opening the package it looks real slick.  It was a snap to get it installed into the base, placed into position and turned on.  One thing I noticed right away is that the remote control for this TV works for both my Samsung 52\" and the Viore (and the samsun control works for the Viore too)  After some googling it appears that Viore's are manufactured using a lot of Samsung parts.The internal speakers didn't seem very good but I will just be using headphones with this set (which sounds good).The 1080p looks awesome on 360 playing modern warfare 2.  Everything is crisp and sharp.Overall I am impressed with this TV.  It's easy to move around, cheap, and great quality!If you're looking for a cheap secondary TV for console gaming (360, etc)  look no further!", "Date": "December 14, 2009"}, {"Title": "Good Picture, Bad Sound, Decent Deal", "Author": "Adam Jensen", "ReviewID": "RVJNZ3ELN11Y", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I echo many of the other reviews I read before I decided to buy this TV.  For the price it has all the features you want and a pretty good picture.  The sound however is pretty bad.  I got it for my office and it should work fine in there, but I caution you if you plan to watch in a bigger room.  The speakers are actually on the back of the TV facing away from the picture.  It seems like a weird place to put speakers, and it results in the sound coming to you bouced off a back wall presuming its on a stand.  I have no idea how you could hear the TV if you wall mounted it or had it in an entertainment center nook or something.  If you don't care too much about sound then this is pretty good deal.

The reason the sound is poor is attributed to the fact that the TV is very thin and as a result you cannot insert speakers with better sound because they require more depth. For the same season the manufacturer could not fit inside the thin housing the power supply. As a solution the manufacturer provided an externalpower supply (separate \"box\" with cords)but as it turns out this is not bad - see PROS below.CONS: Vertical picture viewing angle is poor. If you are in bed and the TV is slightly above the straight horizontal line the picture becomes too dark.PROS: The power supply for this TV is external (110 VAC input, 12V DC output). The TV power supply rating (stamped on the TV) is 12V DC at 5A. This means that you can operate this TV in your car, RV, boat, etc. It can be an excellent emergency TV. For emergency TV you may want to consider the smaller (22-inch model, consumes a bit less power.)The remote control of this TV also operates my two big Samsung TVs and vice-versa. I would speculate that Viore is a low cost \"daughter\" company of Samsung.", "Date": "February 19, 2010"}, {"Title": "Great Picture - Great Value for a smaller room", "Author": "Tony", "ReviewID": "R35JUZSMS1YOOJ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I am an avid year home audio/theater enthusiast and own and have a lot of experience high end home theater gear.We have been looking for replacement TV for our bedroom for about 6 months - I have shopped all the stores and was not satisfied witht the poor picture quality of what they had to offer for smaller LCD TV's.  We really liked the larger LED TV's but they were too big for our bedroom - then we accidentally found this TV on Amazon and decided to take a chance and I am glad we did.Great picture - I have it hooked up to a rooftop antenna and the HDTV tuner works great - no issues.  Played a standard DVD and it looks good as wellSound is fine for a bedroom, just turn the surround option off and increase the bass level and souds fine, but I think if this TV was in a room larger than 12 X 15 you would need some other speakers.Should note if the TV is above eye level the angle of the TV screen is tilted upwards, which makes it difficult to see - but you can simply angle it down and problem solvedIn summary - I cannot find fault with this product, we are very satisfied and would highly recommend.", "Date": "January 8, 2010"}, {"Title": "Works as a monitor and a TV, but not great as either.", "Author": "Captain Practical", "ReviewID": "R2L17DZD715BV5", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I bought this for my mom who wanted to use the same display for her TV and computer monitor to save some desk space.  The price was great, and since it's LED backlit the size is perfect.  That's about all it has going for it, though.Construction:  Very light and slim, which is great.  The base is very flimsy, though.  I was afraid it would break every time I hooked up one of the connections.  Also, it's tilted back at about 10-15 degrees, and not adjustable.  This is a good angle for use as a monitor, but no good when using as a TV since the viewing angles are not very good on this display.Picture:  As a Monitor:  Picture on the VGA connection for the CPU is good, but for some reason it looks terrible when using HDMI from a video card with HDMI output (same result from the DVI port using a DVI-HDMI converter).  I know what I'm doing when it comes to setting the correct resolution and all that, but the output through HDMI is just bad compared to VGA, which is the opposite of how it should be.  It's much too bright, and none of the video presets are good for use as a monitor, had to use the user-defined settings, which aren't great.  Viewing angles are bad as mentioned before, but about what you would expect for the price.As a TV:  Hi-Def signals look good.  Standard-def TV looks pretty bad, and 4:3 ratio signals centered on a 24\" widescreen look smaller than I expected.  Again, the video presets are lousy, and I had to use the user-defined setting, meaning I have to adjust it every time I switch back and forth from VGA to TV input (something too complex for my mom to do).  The noise-reduction filter also only has 3 settings which range from too weak to too strong.  The warm and cool filters are both way too strong.Sound:  As has already been covered by other reviews, it's beyond bad.  It sounds like you're sitting next to someone at the library who has their headphones on full-blast.  Using external CPU speakers instead.Menu:  The menu is slow and unresponsive, too small for my mom to read, things are not where you would expect them to be.  The options you get are context-dependent, meaning the menu looks different for every type of signal, so you don't know what your options will be before you connect the signal.  It took me like half an hour to set the favorite-channel presets, only to learn that the interface for selecting the favorites is more cumbersome than just inputting the channel number.Remote:  Not good.  It has few buttons (which are small and hard to press), but for some reason the remote itself is bigger than any other remote I have.  The button labels are too small for my mom to read (ironically they put Braille next to the only 3 buttons that are already easy to find by feel).  It doesn't work unless pointed directly at the IR receiver, and since the TV is so sluggish, you constantly think you missed and end up hitting the button twice - very frustrating.Connections:  This is fine.  It has one of everything you need.  Could use one more HDMI.  I haven't tested any other HDMI devices besides the CPU, so I can't say if those would look as bad as the CPU did on HDMI.  Switching inputs is a pain because the menu is so slow, and instead of just switching to the next input with one button press like most displays, you have to select the input you want from a drop-down list.Overall:  It makes a decent 24\" monitor using the D-Sub connection, but you could get an equivalent monitor for much less money.  What you're paying for here is the TV-Tuner, and as a TV it's disappointing (if you plan on using the built-in speakers, don't even think about buying this for use as a TV).  It is very sleek, slim, and light, though, if that's important to you.  I would would spend some more dough on something better next time around.", "Date": "July 4, 2010"}, {"Title": "It is what it is- a Great Value!", "Author": "Chartography", "ReviewID": "R1I5U2PQTB3DW2", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "It is what it is.

After being relegated to the worst TV set in my household I decided to take advantage of the holiday sales to look for a new set. Black Friday's prices were nothing to right home about. I found an LED set at Best Buy that has 1080p and did some more research and found it just didn't have enough ports. I decided to wait and search for some new sets.Sure enough Amazon came through for me again with this model. If you're looking for a TV that does just about what you want it to do look no further. It has 2 HDMI ports, your usual component/ AV ports, and a VGA port with Audio in so you can use your TV as a monitor and speaker for your computer as well. You also have coaxial and RF which is good for set top boxes or old videogame consoles. It's missing S-video, and for some reason it has a 3.5mm headphone jack. The picture on this is great and since it uses LED lighting you have darker darks and lighter lights than conventional LCD's. The sound is pretty weak and using the surround option won't help. If it had better sound and an s-video port or two it would have gotten a five.

I use it to watch movies, satellite TV, and act as a large screen display for my laptop PC.  It does all these things quite nicely.  (Note: The VGA connector on the set is a 15 pin D female.

I like the presets quite well and have not been tempted yet to play with settings.  Lightweight and easy to install.

Internal speakers are not very good. I plugged my PC speakers into the headphone jack on unit and they do much better. The TV also lacks an S-video input.

It's understandable because the TV and its bezel are so thin, there is no way for the manufacturer to put big speakers on it. I hooked up a pair of Logitech speakers to the TV for good sound. This TV has 4 VESA 100x100 screw holes on the back with 4 screws included. Because the TV is thin, these screws should be used when we wall-mount or desk-mount the TV as longer screws might damage the internal parts of the TV. I first used one of the 2 TVs I bought as a PC monitor in my bedroom but the remote control of the Samsung T260HD in the same bedroom kept turning this TV ON/OFF and controlled it as well (The remote control of the Viore also controlled the Samsung shamelessly). It's pretty annoying so I had to move the Viore to another bedroom. Some websites said this Viore was built with Samsung OEM parts and I believe that :) . I believe we can use the Samsung codes to program this TV on the cable box or universal remote controls.

Personally I bought Logitech S220 2.1 Speaker System (Black) and use them for the tv and my computer.Now, I'm sure that what happened to me is a very isolated incident, but my tv did not come with the power cord. After waiting for an hour on the phone listening to nice elevator music and being reminded that I am currently the 2nd person in line for an operator, I was instructed to fax my proof of purchase and shipping address to them so they could send me a replacement (This was on Dec 23rd). In the mean time I was able to barrow a cable from a samsung tv. Well, this might of gotten a 3 star if I ever got that cable. I called them again (Jan 5th) only to wait two hours and be told that they got my fax but they didnt ship it because the address I wanted them to ship to wasnt clearly stated (I wrote \"ship to this address\"). Its Jan 8th and I'm headed back to college with no power cord and the replacement is no where to be seen.To sum it up, by all means get this tv if you want a cheap tv with a great picture quality, but invest into something for the sound, and pray to your deity that nothing goes wrong so you dont have to deal with these infuriating people/answering machines.

I used it for watching movies and as PC display in my bedroom. Besides the audio issue (which to me really is not a big issue as i hooked it up to a X-Mini II Capsule Speaker), I have a problem with PC-HDMI connectivity. I have an HTPC with a DVI-I, VGA, and HDMI ports (which meant I could use three monitors at one time). I hooked up the HTPC to HDTV using that HDMI port and the display quality is just terrible. The fonts and everything else are blurry and I ended up using either the DVI-I/VGA ports when I need to use it as computer display. So at this time, I just use the HDMI port for watching BLU-RAY movies.

I would probably buy it again at that price but would seriously consider a name brand for a bit more.The TV arrived quickly from Amazon with free shipping. It was perfectly sealed and I found no damages. There are ample connections and the only connection missing is S-video.I needed a TV light enough to move around from the garage to the backyard or wherever around the house I might feel like watching TV. It's thinner than an average LCD but not as thin as the more expensive name brand LED TV's. The build quality seems fine considering the TV is about half the price of a similar name brand model. The screen size is perfect for my portable needs--not too small and not too big.Up close (~2 feet), the picture quality is not that great. The picture using an ATSC antenna is pixelated but the colors are vivid. The farther away you get from the TV obviously the better the picture looks. Since you are likely going to watch the TV from 3+ feet away, the picture will look great and the colors stand out well with the LED back lighting. Definitely a more superb picture than a comparable plain LCD. The color is much better as well. I think that's what makes LED TV picture quality seem better--more vivid colors and not necessarily clarity. Plus, at a small screen size you can get up to 1080p whereas you might have to pay a premium to get 1080p on a regular LCD versus just 720p. I compared playing the \"9\" blu-ray on a PS3 on my 52\" Samsung LCD with this Viore. The picture on each was equally sharp and colors strong. I can't say for sure that the Viore had better color but when watching other programs that's what I consistently notice the most--the color pops on the Viore. The color doesn't catch me as much when watching my Samsung.As other reviewers noted, the remote is a piece of junk. It's not responsive and feels cheap. The sound is fine for my purposes (used during exercise, cooking, or falling asleep in front of) but if you're planning to play games or watch movies you'll definitely want a separate speaker setup.For the price, $250, is a great deal and I don't regret spending half the price of a name brand.", "Date": "May 3, 2010"}, {"Title": "Great picture.

It is very subtle and can only really be seen when that part of the screen is black (letterbox). I think this has something to do with the LED back-lighting.The connections on the back of the TV seem cheap. Not that they don't work but they feel cheap. My earphones went in too far which is usually an indication of a cheap product. And my HDMI cable almost didnt fit, barely enough room.Sound quality is awful. Like needles in your eardrums bad.

However when i received it, I found it was LED-backlit. Having said this, it's still a good TV and a good value for a 24 in. (actually about 23.6 in.) 1080p HDTV.Positives: lots of connections on the back - RF, 2 HDMIs, component, AV composite, and even a PC input, which means this can double as your PC monitor if you want to save some money, and you can also hook up secondary speakers from another source. The picture - 1080p output capability means excellent Blu-Ray viewing and excellent video game picture (which is the main reason I bought this, and it has been awesome so far in that regard), contrast ratio is staggeringly low, but if you're like me, it does not bother you much.Negatives: sound - this is probably the most glaring fault of this TV, if you want to get it \"loud\" you need to turn it up VERY high, but well before you get there the speakers will make that sickening reverberation letting you know if the volume stays that high the speakers will be damaged very quickly. So unless you have a home theater system or auxiliary speakers hooked up, say from your stereo system (which the connections on the back allow), you will be mostly disappointed with the speakers. In addition, one time the sound randomly stopped outputting; couldn't figure out why but it eventually came back on, it was worrying but nothing huge. The remote - for whatever reason the remote becomes unresponsive occassionly, not really a dealbreaker, but it does have a quick closed captioning toggle button, which is a plus considering the sound is not the best.I bought this TV for $300, it was a good price then and is still a decent price. It has some problems, the worst of which is sound, but that can be overcome by the appropriate cable and auxiliary speakers.

The Speakers don't make a peep when plugged into that jack.  I have a TV that I can't watch TV with, because it is apparently incompatible with my Dish TV receiver.  It refuses to see the Dish channel (you have to see the TV to a certain channel for it to see the receiver, and then the channel changes on the receiver itself to change what you see), so I can't watch TV on it.
