{"Reviews": [{"Title": "WOW - Get This Samsung LED", "Author": "A. Landry \"AL\"", "ReviewID": "RH11NDGCC1UHE", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Pros:Appearance:From the get go, I pulled thing out of the box, and I was impressed on the thiness. Next I put it on the bezel stand and put it in our armoire and was completely awed at the cleaness and style.Set Up:was a breeze, got on my WiFi right away, updated the firmware and away we went.Movies:I hooked up my media PC to it, with over 400 HD movies I have, I ran at least 10 movies on it. First I went simple, TRON with Auto Motion is crisp and clean and lifelike I do not know how you go back to regular viewing ever again. Next I tried 3D and threw in How to Train Your Dragon, and it was so clear and clean and had such good depth perception I was totally impressed.Color:I have a Plasma TV Panasonic 42\" and this Samsung LED kills it, it bar non has better color and clarity without a second thought.Sound:Very clean and very strong however it lacks bass to be expected with its thinness, but sounds great enough to fill a 15x15 room with sound.Cons:The stand:comes out to far, its a nick pick but I wish at least in the front of it it was short so it didn't come out so far past the screen.Auto Motion Stuttering:I love, but if you are streaming, it will stutter every 20 sec or so if you don have a clean connection. Which I didnt, so I went out and bought a Netgear Powerline 500av and it fixed that issueFound here on amazon( amazon.com/gp/product/B004DVEW8I ).For those of you who do not know what Powerline is, its a way to extend your Ethernet connection through your power lines to any room in your house, my tv is down stairs, even though the WiFi is built in to the TV it was not strong enough to get 1080p without hiccups even on my Wireless N Router, due to interference most likely. I love auto motion, its the reason why I bought this TV.Flashlights:the term used to describe the LED light leaks in the corner of the screen in really black scenes, its not bad but its there.Smart Hub\\All Share:has a long way to go, still to cluttered, most things cost money, and all share is a pain, your better off hooking a pc up and streaming from it, as all share does NOT play MKVs and has trouble with MP4s. It doesnt do a direct connect to it instead uses its folder structure and its a mess. Music and Pics all worked fine. All Share is not fluid and easy to set up as of yet.BottomLine:The TV software has some tweaks to really make it multimedia like most TVs are trying to pull off, and LED lighting issues are there but very small seems to be common however: this is a LED TV and it main purpose is for watching movies and video and I have a very nice plasma and I have seen the amazon show floor (called best buy) and looked at all kinds of LEDs and even Samsung very own 8000 series, and I still think this is the best of the line period, I am picking up a 55\" soon of the 6500 to go in my media room, get this LED you will absolutely love it.", "Date": "June 26, 2011"}, {"Title": "So far GREAT", "Author": "AnObservation", "ReviewID": "R3SJ1D5MXDUXI6", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I purchased this TV from Amazon a week ago and so far I am enjoying it very much. It is my 3rd LCD flat screen over almost as many years as they have been on the market. This is far better the one I purchased 2 years ago. The picture is outstanding, almost too good. Some people who watch it with me say it looks too real and not like a TV and shows detail you were not meant to see. I do not consider that a negative. The SMART TV variety of options including Samsung Apps are fairly good and extensive but sadly do not include Amazon which tempted me to knock the rating down to 4 stars. The set up and use of the apps and other features is not as intuitive as it could be and that probably does knock the rating down to 4 and half stars. Many of the Apps like with apple ipod you have to purchase, others claim to be free but after you connect you have to pay a fee.The caveat being I have yet to connect a 3-D source or buy the glasses. So I can not review that aspect of the TV. The picture in 2-D is very 3-D as you truly get the illusion of depth because of the picture quality and you do not have to mess with glasses. I will soon take the 3-D plunge and hopefully amend this review to include that aspect.But if you want a great picture in your bedroom, it is bright with tons of contrast and exceptionally sharp. It is quite glossy and those with light source issues may consider a less reflective TV to avoid reflected light on the screen.I purchased this just after it came out and the price dropped today. I have every confidence that Amazon who always has treated me better than any other retailer will live up to the price reduction guarantee. Again I will attempt to follow up with this review and let everyone know how that price guarantee worked for me.Additional information:  Amazon informed me they have refunded the difference in price I paid and the current lower price on Amazon. I am so happy with Amazon for going beyond what any other retailer does.", "Date": "May 11, 2011"}, {"Title": "Great TV at a great price", "Author": "Alex Ivanov", "ReviewID": "RAOLGIEW4KRZT", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Awesome TV! I was a little hesitant to buy it because of the lack of reviews, but really glad I did. This is Samsung's entry level 3D 2011 model, but the only thing indicating that is the price. I'm not sure if you can get a better deal on a 55\" 3D capable LED TV.PROS: Looks awesome, 0.5\" bezel makes it look great! WiFi is built-in, so no need to spend another $60 on an adapter.CONS: There really aren't any, besides being able to tweak a lot of picture settings which can be a burden for people with OCD :)", "Date": "June 1, 2011"}, {"Title": "\u00a1\u00a1Absolutely great!!", "Author": "Jack24", "ReviewID": "R31QMI151ZQ45B", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I bought this TV last august the 4th, so it's a really recent purchase. The reasons why I decided to buy it were its size, resolution, and obviously the 3D capability. I didn't think too much about it before, but let me warn you, this TV is FAR BEYOND that. This is an absolutely ultimate technology device, and this why I say it:1. The size of the screen is incredible when it comes the time to play games. I have a PlayStation 3 connected to the TV through an HDMI cable, and the colors, resolution, and overall performance of the TV are really out of this world. If you play games in an Full HD widescreen you can really see much more detail than in other TVs, no matter how big they are, which is great if you play Fifa or combat planes related games.2. To watch a movie, this is like having a real cinema in your own home. We have been watching some BD movies on the TV, and it delivers a detail I hadn't seen before, except in the theaters. The colors are crisp, vivid and real: The black is really black, not a dark gray like on other screens, so the contrast is really, really good.3. Fortunatelly for us, the TV came with its own 3D glasses set included (2 units), and let me tell you, the 3D experience of this TV is better than the one you can enjoy in your nearest theater, or at least the same, since you're closer to the source. I didn't have to buy a separate Blu-Ray Player since the PlayStation 3 has this feature included, and it also reproduces 3D content (if you didn't know this, now you do). We enjoyed to see \"MegaMind\" in 3D in our own home... and it was faaar better than watching it on a theater. I couldn't believe it. I tried this with a 3D powered game like Gran Turismo 5, and pfff... I don't really have words to describe it. It's almost like driving in a real race. Now, to the previous buyer who said that the TV in 2D is almost 3D: I seriously suggest you to buy the glasses and try with a 3D BD. The TV is great in 2D, but in 3D, the word would far beyond \"awesome\". When you try it in 3D, you'll notice there is a huge, huge diference.4. If you have a laptop, you'll find very interesting that you can connect it to the TV through any of their 4 HDMI ports, and get a great screen to do some work, watch some videos or photographs with your family and friends, or fool around the Internet.The cons:5. When it comes to the smart part, I think this part could have been a little bit better. I don't know how Samsung didn't think in a more intuitive keyboard or a different way to allow users to connect a physical keyboard to the TV (maybe there is a solution out there so I'll have to investigate further, but I think this part can be improved). Maybe this is the only con of the TV, but since its primary function is not this (you can have a computer for that), I will still give it five stars.I absolutely recommend this item if you're thinking to buy it.", "Date": "August 16, 2011"}, {"Title": "Nice television", "Author": "John R", "ReviewID": "R3SEBG868WXNMM", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I have been shopping televisions online for about a month, comparing specs, reading reviews, and looking at places like Consumer Reports and CNET for advice.  About all I learned is that it can be pretty confusing.  I decided that I wanted to be able to stream movies from sites like Netflix and (because of the location of my router)that I would need a wifi television.  I also learned that \"wifi ready\" does not really mean wifi ready, it just means that the tv is ready for you to spend another $80 or so on an adapter.  Therefore this cost had to be factored in.  I decided on LED over plasma because of the burn-in issues with plasma.I had narrowed my choice down to Sharp, Samsung, or Sony.  All of them seemed to have an excellent picture, weak sound, and some problems with light bleeding.  I was ready to buy a 46 inch Samsung D6000 for about $1000 when I found this D6500 with built in wifi (no adapter needed), 3D capability, 2 pairs of glasses, and a free blue ray player for less than $1200.  I decided this was about what the D6000 would cost after I bought the adapter and blu ray player.  And I would get 3D as a bonus.So far, the television has been great.  I went through all of the set-up stuff and had the thing connected, firm wear updated, and was watching a program in less than 30 minutes.  The picture seemed fine right out of the box so I didn't mess with it.  The sound is better that I expected.  It is loud enough and the quality is fine for regular programs, but I might add a soundbar later to enhance the movie experience.  I had expected to buy the soundbar right away because I have a 24,000 btu air conditioner roaring about 20 feet from the television and I was concerned that the \"micro speakers\" in any flat screen would not be sufficient, but I run the sound up to about 65 (on a scale of 100) and I have no problem hearing.  I do have a small amount of light bleeding at each corner.  The ONLY time this can be noticed is in a very dark room on a black screen that has a small lighted area.  (My music channels have an information box that floats around a black screen, and this is when I can see a slight bleeding in the corners)  I can't see it any other time and I don't consider it a problem.After Dish hooked me up to high-def, the closed caps would not come on.  Dish said it was a television problem and Samsung told me that closed caption would not work when an HDMI cable is used. So, as they say, when all else failed I read the instructions.  The book for the Dish receiver clearly told me how to turn the caps on, and they work great.I tried the 3D feature, using some of the sample clips that are include, and found it interesting, but not something I really want to watch.  My wife, on the other hand, loves it.  So, I guess I am glad we have it but glad we did not spend extra to get it.I would buy this television again.", "Date": "September 11, 2011"}, {"Title": "My Second UN46X6500", "Author": "eman", "ReviewID": "R3Q1OAQXBFH9F", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Last July I bought the UN46C6500 and recently published a short review on that model.Based on the UN46C6500 the new UN46D6500 is much improved.  A thinner bevel around the edges now makes the set 42\" wide vs 43\" last year the power sound & channel buttons are now on the rear of the set instead of along the bottom bevel. The set is 3D capable, there is built in WIFI  and it still gets an amazing picture.  Set up was a breeze with easy to follow menus. I wish the remote was friendlier(same complaint about the C6500).The only real issue was with the shipping and delivery of 2 of the four items sent in the order.  One pair of 3D glasses was sent in a box, the other in a padded envelope via UPS. Of course the one in the padded envelope was crushed when it arrived,(DUH). The HDMI cable I ordered had better packaging, double boxed!The TV was sent UPS ground, and as I expected, it was damaged(the back panel was dented in two places). Amazon should know better than using ground UPS for a shipment like this as UPS doesn't respect package labeling. I know that the dimensions barely allow the use of UPS to avoid oversize shipping rates but a $1250 panel presents a great risk.Amazon Customer Service quickly resolved my problems.  When I explained that the HDTV was a gift for the day after delivery, Amazon replaced the order with another sent via FedEx air overnight for a Saturday delivery at no extra charge.They also provided me additional incentive on the purchase for the problems.Great Customer Service Amazon.", "Date": "August 10, 2011"}, {"Title": "patchy display on gray", "Author": "N. Loftus", "ReviewID": "R2CG5QJC56MY35", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "this is the second Samsung Smart TV I have purchased in the space of 5 weeks from Amazon....After reading alot of reviews of  different TVs I decided Samsung seemed to be the 'it' TV of the moment from a quality perspective and I purchased the previous 40'' model UN40D6400 for $882 - (list price $1299) which I thought was a great 'open box' purchase from amazon Warehouse deals - and received in like new condition in original box and only missing one screw...unfortunately the 'side bleed' or 'flashlight'  was really noticeable on a black screen - and more so on the right side of the TV - and this bothered me because LED technology is supposed to have an even backlight as far as I had researched...also there was an intermittent appearance of the pop up menu  - which I read must be to do with electrical interference from another device or wire and it seemed I resolved this issue  - but the flashlight issue was too visible and so I decided to return the TV and start again...I then noticed that a newer Samsung model had since been released from Amazon within the 3 weeks I had taken receipt of the first 40'' TV- the 46'' UN46D6500 with built in Wifi - and I could'nt believe I could get it new in box for $1249 -(list price $1799!!)  including 2 pairs of 3d glasses - I did the math and basically the difference was an extra $300 to get the newer and larger model with glasses and built in WIFI - if I had kept the open box smaller version I would have had to purchase the glasses and separate wifi adapter at additional expense - so it seemed like a no brainer to arrive at spending a little more for alot more feature wise...I have had this 46'' TV for 2 weeks tomorrow - and I find I need to return it  AGAIN...it still has the same side 'light bleed' - although not as bad as the previous model - but I noticed in between changing channels the default gray screen has a really patchy display - with a visible darker 1 + 1/2 '' horizontal band about a 1/4 of the way down from the top of the screen - and another running along the bottom of the TV -  it wouldnt matter so much on the gray screen but it is also visible while watching streamed movies / DVD's depending on the background...So either I am really unlucky or Samsung are having some quality control issues...!?  Anyone else noticing the same as I have described?Apart from the banding issue - the picture is amazing...but now Amazon dont have any more of this model in stock to replace this faulty one for another 1- 2 months - so I am now really inconvenienced to have to return this model (at my expense for shipping) and face having no TV in the interim because Amazon have stated they will not replace it because this is my second return - which I need to resolve with Amazon - I still want this TV - just minus any quality issues!!", "Date": "July 22, 2011"}, {"Title": "Wow!", "Author": "Laura G. \"Laura\"", "ReviewID": "R3V2DS53TDAVVN", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This is really an amazing TV.  I'm not a big 3D person, but it's pretty incredible to watch 3D Blu-ray in your own home.  Very vivid colors, crystal clear picture, and I think the sound is great (compared to our old 44\" Magnavox LCD).  I can't believe how thin it is, too!  I bought at the right time.....the very next day the price increased by $600.  This TV also is one of the top rated on Consumer Reports.One note about the Skype: you have to buy a Samsung Skype camera, which is around $120-$170.  We were disappointed that this wasn't noted anywhere online, and it took a long and frustrating webchat with Samsung to figure out you can't just use any webcam.  Haven't been able to try the Skype feature (very excited to)....our camera should be here this week.Edited 1/20/12: We're also disappointed that there is no web browser.

I have a room that's 21' x 21', so I wanted a big screen, at least 60\".  When the D7000 and D8000 came out, I was immediately drawn to the design, especially the very thin bezel, and many pro reviewers (like CNET) comment on just how good they look. This D6500--and the similar D6400--also have a pretty thin bezel, so I decided the extra features of the D7000 and above really weren't worth the extra $200-400 for me.  My previous TV was a 42\" Westinghouse, one of the first mainstream 1080P sets available.  After my bad experience with that brand, I decided no more budget-brand TVs for me, I pretty much had my heart set on a Samsung after seeing them at friends' houses.This TV looks very good when set up, either on the included stand or hanging on a wall, even when turned off.  When you turn it on, there's a definite \"WOW!\"  The picture quality is very good, and there are multiple picture modes available (Standard, Dynamic, Natural, Movie).  I'll agree with the pros that for movies, the Movie setting looks best, but for most TV content, Standard looks better.  Colors looks accurate to me, and also noticeable are the crispness (clarity) of the image, the deep black levels, detail even in darker areas, and no motion blur at all.  I was concerned that the glossy coating would mean too many reflections as I do have a lot of windows in the room, but it's not really noticeable when the TV is on.  If you're a videophile, there are plenty of settings to tweak the picture to your heart's content, even some built-in test patterns to help you do it.One noticeable detractor for the picture quality: the edge-lighting, while it allows for an impressively thin cabinet, it does impact lighting uniformity.  The result is blooming/light leakage near the four corners, which is more noticeable in dark scenes or black outs.  Full-array LED backlighting doesn't have this problem, but there are few TVs that offer this feature (and are usually quite a bit more money).  It's too bad that a TV this expensive has this issue.By default, the motion enhancement feature is active for all picture modes, so things like movie have a creepy fluidity to them.  Some people like this, I don't; I prefer the cadence of 24 frames per second in movies.  Luckily you can turn off this motion enhancement feature, though the setting is buried deep in the menus.The Smart TV feature is pretty cool, though I probably don't use it as much as I could since I already have many features like this available through my Dish DVR, Sony Bluray Player, and Apple TV.  I *do* use the Netflix service however; it's not the best implementation, but it works, and provides good streaming quality.  Controls are laggy to respond, though.  There are many services available to use through the Smart TV portal, including ones that allow you to buy movie rentals, play games, FaceBook, etc.  There is sometimes a lag switching between applications and the home page.  It's a pretty useful feature, nonetheless, especially if you don't already have another device to do this.  Amazon On Demand is noticeably missing, and it's not especially well integrated; Apple TV has a better interface.The built-in audio is acceptable, but a screen this impressive deserves a surround sound system to match it (I have a 7.1 system with mostly in-wall speakers).I haven't tried the 3D feature yet, as Samsung does not include any 3D glasses, and they weren't running any promotions for free ones at the time I bought it.  3D wasn't a deciding factor for me, though; I just liked the design of this model over the less-expensive D6000 series.  You also get a higher screen \"clear motion rate\" of 480 compared to the D6000 and built-in wifi compared to the D6000 and D6400.The included remote is pretty nice, with back-lit keys and a good layout.  I use a Logitech Harmony though, since I have several other devices to control.I also seriously considered the Sharp Aquos Quattron Line (UN60LE830U / UN60LE832U), but when viewing those TVs side-by-side with this Samsung, I though the images were noticeably softer on the Sharp, particularly edges like a face against a contrasting background, and the picture didn't quite pop as much as it did on the Samsung.I got the TV through one of Amazon's sellers (Video & Audio Center), everything was pretty smooth with them, though their chosen freight carrier (Manna) was slow; 12 calendar days/ 8 business days to get from the warehouse on the west coast to my home in the northeast.Overall, 4.5 stars, I would dock it for half a star because of the blooming effect as well as the lack of any included 3D glasses.", "Date": "November 18, 2011"}, {"Title": "Great TV, some light bleeding on edges", "Author": "A.

After review of several models and comparisons to other brands (LG, Sony), I found that the Samsung UN55D6500 offered the best options at the right price.Out of the box, set up was a snap, and I hooked up my DirecTV via HDMI and noticed a very clear picture.  The TV has built-in Wifi, so I connected it to my home network in a snap and it automatically did a software update.  Overall, the setup took less than 10 min.As I watched the TV, I initially didn't change any of the picture settings from the factory defaults.  In a day or two, I noticed what others have called the \"Soap Opera Effect\", where the picture appears like the picture in Soap Opera shows.  After about a day of checking users groups and forums, I found that the most probable cause was the AutoMotion Plus and LED Motion settings (which are defaulted to be on).  As I learned more about the TV settings and played around, I was able to fine tune the picture to my liking.Overall, its a great TV for the price, but the calibration and tuning of the picture to my liking took some time and was not intuitive.  I'd would have liked to have had a calibration DVD to use for fine tuning to my particular preferences.

It came in a package with a Samsung 5500 blu-ray player and 3D glasses.  One thing to note - after set-up I noticed the picture appeared somewhat dim and washed out.  I assumed this was for the energy setting to be deemed 'efficient'.  I changed the picture mode from Standard to Dynamic and the picture brightened up quite a bit.  I guess it uses more power for this, but had to do it.I won't use the TV's Wi-Fi, but instead probably use the Blu-Ray player for wireless to my router and any streaming videos that I may do in the future.  I won't be using the sound functions on the TV either because I have an AV Receiver.  For those of you that pass everything through an AV Receiver and plan on using 3D, you should know your receiver needs to be a recent model to handle 3D!

The picture on this TV, however, seemed to have a mind of its own.  Intermittently, from every 5 minutes to every hour, the picture would break up entirely.  The screen would look like electronic interference or just pixels ... I don't know how else to describe it.  This would happen no matter what mode -- streaming, playing a DVD, straight TV, through the stereo or not.  We called Samsung Customer Support & the first call was great.  They were on it.  The rep. told us they would send a repairman & to expect a call within 2-3 days to schedule the appointment.  She even gave us  her name & said to call her if we had further problems.  Then we waited.  When no one contacted us, we called back & asked for the rep. we had worked with.  She looked through her records & said that \"the part has been ordered\" and we would be called once the part was in.  A part?  What part?  No one had looked at the TV.  This is a brand new TV ... it requires a part?  We asked how long this would take.  2-3 days.  It was becoming clear ... \"2-3 days\" was the standard reply.  We waited.  After another week & no word, we decided enough was enough.  So we went online with Amazon to return the defective TV & called Samsung to cancel the service call.  I then received a call from someone who said, \"I have the part for your TV & I'm coming tomorrow.\"  I told him it wasn't necessary as the TV was being returned.  So much for Samsung Customer Service.  Now I just have to get the TV back to Amazon.  Amazon stated that the TV would be picked up by UPS \"usually the following business day, but may take up to 2-3 business days.\"  I expected some sort of phone call or email to arrange pick up.  The company that had delivered the TV (not UPS) had called me the day before as well as the morning of delivery -- they were fantastic.  When I received no word from UPS, I contacted Amazon.com customer service to see about when & how this pick up would be scheduled.  I was given the same information, it may take up to 2-3 business days.  Thinking that UPS would call or email, I left the house, only to return and find an \"Attempted Pick Up\" notice from UPS stuck on my door.  The notice said they would again attempt pick up the next day.  There were several time slots on the notice, but none were marked.  I attempted to schedule a time period with UPS online ... that would cost an extra $12 for that service.  I called UPS to schedule a pick up time.  I told them I would have been home if they had contacted me.  They said it was Amazon's responsibility to notify me of delivery date & time, & they could not give me any idea of a time range.  What a ridiculous way to do business.  I am fortunate to be retired & have the ability to sit at home for 3 days, twiddling my thumbs & hoping UPS will show up.  I sincerely doubt I will buy another Samsung product, or any large object requiring UPS pick up services from Amazon.  Inept all around, I would call it.", "Date": "December 16, 2011"}, {"Title": "An amazing 3D TV!

According to one reviewer on the Samsung site, this would have been a perfect TV except for that missing item.  I agree.  4 1/2 stars.  P.S. With further research, it appears the Samsung web browser isn't so great.  I'll just keep plugging in the laptop or using another gadget if I need to see a full webpage.---------------------I LOVE the look of this TV sitting on my black granite topped credenza.  Picked them both out in the last few weeks, and damn, I did GOOD!  Lol.  I'm awestuck every time I turn the thing on.  It's tempting to run my relaxation DVD's all day just to enjoy the pictures.  The thin bezel and deep blacks make ALL the difference.  As long as this Samsung 46\" continues to work as advertised, I couldn't be happier!  I purchased a Panasonic DMP-BDT210 Blu-Ray (so easy to use) since Samsung doesn't work with Amazon streaming, and have been able to run assorted internet video with no problems at all.  (The speakers are more than adaquate for my needs, btw.)After reading many reviews, talking to other people about their Samsung and Panasonic TVs (all happy customers--I'm crossing my fingers I don't have that rare lemon in disguise), then seeing how much better this TV looked than others in stores, I knew this was the one I wanted.  I decided to save some money and order through Amazon.  My only regret is not waiting til the price dropped.  I got an Amazon price refund, but once again I was too impulsive and could've saved more if I hadn't been in a fizz.  (I knew TV sales would be more competitive approaching Superbowl Sunday and really go down with the introduction of the 2012's.  But, I wanted a TV others had tested out, and after nearly a month of remodeling the living room, I didn't want to go another week with just my small kitchen TV.)3D has been an added bonus I wasn't shopping for, and didn't expect to enjoy nearly so much.  My previous 3D experiences were at the movies ages ago.  Pretty cool, but not anything I wanted to spend more than a few dollars on.  New technology has changed my mind.  This week I've watched Under the Sea (IMAX - 2009) and Rio (2011).  Based on these two and various reviews, I agree the IMAX conversions are not the best 3D TV has to offer.  The IMAX movie did have truly realistic extreme 3D moments though.  The Potato Cod fish was even creepier as it seemed to swim right at my face!  But after watching Under the Sea, I wasn't sure if having things come at me, and sometimes having to choose between focus levels was something I wanted to experience on a regular basis.  Overall, Under the Sea was interesting, enjoyable, absolutely worth watching, makes me want to save the reefs and learn to scuba!  But Rio was pure delight the whole way through.  No fuzziness at any time, better audio in more ways than one, and an amusing \"love conquers all\" story that will make everybody smile.  Since I've went way over my budget this month, I'm going to have to wait a bit for \"How to Train Your Dragon\" and will do a happy dance ;-) when my \"free\" 3D Avatar movie finally arrives from Panasonic.  (SO glad I'm kept putting off seeing that movie! It's going to be awesome!)  Til then I'll keep patting myself on the back for my purchase of a Panasonic Blu-Ray and Samsung thin bezel 3D HDTV.

Oddly when watching the show Luther from the BBC from on demand in HD I see a fair amount of judder/blur.  Not so much that it's unbearable but it can be a bit annoying.  Watching The Lord of the Rings from on demand I didn't see it as much.I have seen minimal clouding, no where near the extent that some others have stated.  This is most noticeable in dark grey scenes.  Very dark black senes I have not really noticed it.  Same goes for flashlighting effect, have not seen that much of it and only in dark grey scenes not very black ones and not to the extent that others have stated.So why only 3 stars:  The built in wifi SUCKS!!!!!!.  I picked this over the d6400 simply for the built in wifi , but it's unusable.  I can connect to my home network fine enough but getting Netflix or the Samsung Apps center to run has been impossible.  It either hangs with a small dialog box on the screen that says \"Connecting\" , with no way to get out of it other than to reboot the tv, or it says \"Network interference. Try again later\".  Every other device I have has no problem only this one.  If you are going to put wifi in the TV it should work better than this.  The most frustrating thing is going to check the network status and seeing that it can connect and that it says the network is fine.  This happens if I have the router configured for 802.11n or b/g compatible.  Oh and trying to do a network firmware upgrade is ridiculous, says it's going to take 15 hours to complete and doesn't really bounce down from there.  I liked the idea of this having the wifi and a netflix app so I wouldn't need to get a roku or something else.Right now I'll keep it for another week or so to see if I can get things working, if not it's going back.", "Date": "February 26, 2012"}, {"Title": "the picture quality could be better", "Author": "dodi", "ReviewID": "R3QZZGP0PDQR60", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Love the design, however the picture quality is not perfect.

I was check the UN46C6500. Then the Amazon page told me that there's a new model, AND it is cheaper.Got it, then I realized that there's no Amazon video app. In fact, all Samsung 2011 TV model don't come with Amazon Video.  What's going on?  I want my Amazon Video. Both Amazon and Samsung need to do something!Wifi - forget it.  It works only if you open up your SSID..etc.  Going to get an Airport express to bridge the network.Apps - don't really care except Amazon, most of the apps are useless.
