{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Not bad for the price", "Author": "Patrick B. Harrald", "ReviewID": "R3LN61MFM2UR24", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I purchased this TV form Wal-Mart for $998 with a Blu-ray player included.This TV does everything okay, nothing really stands out as far as the picture or sound. Having said that, there are no problems with this TV either. It is attractive, slim, and lightweight and has a nice picture. The very best functional property is the Bravia Sync button which allows the Blu-ray player (and/or PS3) to work flawlessly with the TV (if it is a Sony, not sure about other brands). If you turn on your Blu-ray, the TV turns on and switches to the correct input. Turn off the TV and the Blu-ray shuts off. It is genius really. AND IT WORKS! As I said the picture is fine, although I have never really been able to \"tweak\" the colors to be exactly how I like them, once I begin viewing it looks good.The lighting system seems to work well (it adjusts to the amount of light in your room) I say seems to work b/c I never notice it. I guess that's a good thing though.Final opinion:If you are in the market for an LED LCD TV, this is a really nice choice for a good price. This is a nice TV and I think you'll agree for the money it delivers.(one side note: The sound volume isn't that pronounced, I find myself turning movies WAY up while Xbox360 games need to be turned WAY down. I don't know why this is but a Blu-ray is so quiet that I sometimes get annoyed...of course turning the TV up past 50% fixes that but there is something inside me that doesn't like to do that)", "Date": "February 11, 2011"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "$1,049.00", "Features": "46-inch Edge LED-backlit HDTV with Full HD 1080p resolution and slim design\nBRAVIA Engine 2 fully digital video processor; Ambient Sensor adjusts color based on room light\nUSB port for photos, music and video playback; operate and control other BRAVIA Sync compatible devices\nInputs: 4 HDMI, 2 component, 2 composite, 1 PC, 1 USB, 1 optical digital audio output\nIncludes removable stand; measures 42.75 x 27.1 x 10.25 inches with stand", "Name": "Sony Bravia KDL-46EX600 46\" HDTV LED- LCD TV True Cinema technology", "ImgURL": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41esIJXlr%2BL._SY300_.jpg", "ProductID": "B00391MRGW"}}
