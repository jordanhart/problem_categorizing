{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Looks as good as it performs", "Author": "David Bickford \"dbickpg\"", "ReviewID": "R3BLTJHKL9NE4S", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Bought this for my man garage, and I couldn't be more impressed.  Keep in mind these few things when buying this TV.  This is a TV that should be paired with a receiver.  There are only two HDMI inputs, so make sure your receiver can handle all the inputs you need.  If you are wall mounting, make sure the brackets that attach to the TV are no more than 2 inches wide...if they are, it will block the power cord input.  That being said, here are the pros. Wall mounting was like hanging a picture.  I was able to lift and position solo.  Without the stand, its only like 23lbs.  The picture is crisp, and the design is simple and classy.  The bezel is not very wide, so you are mostly looking at screen.  Everyone is impressed with how thin the TV is.  Great for what I needed.  I would not recommend this as your main TV, because it just isn't big enough...go for a 46\" or bigger!Update... I have had this TV for about a month now and no issues. To help you out in your decisions, I spend a lot of time researching specs and prices of many brands before making a purchase.  The main reason I spent time learning about this TV was the price.  There are not many comparable TV's at this price point, with the features I was looking for.  I have seen some good deals on panasonic TV's, but have had no experience with panasonic TV's before.  I think because this TV is not a smart TV, and does not have 3D, the price is a bit lower.  Consumers are so hyped up about those features, that TV's without them are falling in price.  I didn't want either of those features, but I did want what this TV has to offer.  Slim, light, reasonably priced, good contrast ratio, and simple design.  I would have preferred 240hz, but since this TV has the Samsung 240 motion feature, and because this is a backup TV, I accepted the 120hz.  Because of the 120hz and no smart options, I would expect this TV to be outdated within 2 years, but still useable for 4-6 years.", "Date": "November 25, 2012"}, {"Title": "So far, so good!", "Author": "supergirl \"supergirl\"", "ReviewID": "R31ZXSUN0DKHJS", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Love this TV so far.  Did a lot of comparison shopping and had certain criteria I really wanted but did not want to pay a crazy price for.I finally upgraded from an old tube tv and this was worth the wait.I wanted an LED TV, wanted it to be very slim, 1080p, at least 40\", from a name brand, with good picture quality and did not want to spend a lot of money, this perfectly fit the bill.Most LED tv's are thicker and the slim ones tend to be the premium tvs that are very expensive.I decided I'd rather get a high quality slim tv, than get a bigger thicker more clunky looking one that might have more features.The thousand plus premium tv's were out of my budget so I wanted to get the closest and most I could for the least amount.This TV isn't a \"Smart\" TV, but to be honest there are other ways to get the same features of a smart tv with a Roku or Apple TV, so I figured I could add those on later if I wanted to and TV technology and evolution moves pretty quickly so even if I could spend a lot right now I think I'd rather wait and see where they head and have prices come down a bit.  Who knows maybe Apple will release a full Apple TV one of these days...! One important thing to note is that when I first got this TV, I thought it looked really weird and bad and was disappointed and thought I made a mistake.  Things were blurry, not crisp and everything including movie and dramas looked like a cheap video reality tv, or a documentary.  I did some research on settings and had to change the incoming resolution on my cable box which was set at 480dpi to 1080. Then found out about the \"soap opera effect\" caused by the Auto Motion Plus setting. Once I found this setting under picture options and turned it off the weird effect went away and things looked normal.  I also adjusted some color and other settings and things improved drastically with these changes.  I believe this only applies to LED tvs starting and above 120Hz. Had I not figured out the Auto Motion plus sensor and found out about the Soap Opera effect I think I would be tempted to return the TV.", "Date": "January 11, 2013"}, {"Title": "Very good Set", "Author": "EMLG", "ReviewID": "RRYQVUZQDEO7F", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Have had my TV for a week now and I would have to say it's pretty good.  Nothing beats a Samsung, had a Sony 42in that I returned for this set and am not regretting it at all.  Bought this TV for my little man cave and mainly for video games.  The picture is really nice and the box actually says that it's 240hz.  Very crisp picture, and colors are nearly perfect.  The only flaw is when you watch a black screen you can see the light bleed in patches but honestly, it's not a big deal as you can't tell 98% of the time.  Awesome for video games and watching sports.  The TV is very slim and when mounted looks great.", "Date": "November 29, 2012"}, {"Title": "Just what I expected from this Samsung TV", "Author": "Jekahog \"JK\"", "ReviewID": "R2LPHYL2S1PPEL", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I spent hours looking for a TV that would fit my needs. After reading many reviews and specs, I finally decided on this Samsung UN40ES6003 LED HDTV.Basically what I had in mind was:-Price-Screen Size-Good Image Quality-Good sound-120hz refresh rate-Thin bezel-And slim bodyAlthough this is not a smart TV nor does it offer 3D capability (not that I care because I own a PS3 for apps and such) it is just enough for me to enjoy some good shows on hulu and anime as well. Maybe not everyone will agree but I find this tv to be just good enough for gaming and playing music.With a deal as good as this ($479 + free shipping) I could not ask for more. I have owned a samsung TV before and this time around it does not disappoint.I won't bother with the CONS, cause i won't be looking for that now. If there's anything I'll make sure to update.In a nut shell, I found a perfect companion!
