{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Excellent TV from Panasonic", "Author": "D. Meyer", "ReviewID": "R26170GQISQPLO", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I bought this plasma from a local electronics store [...]. This is the second flat screen I have purchased in as many days.I first bought a Samsung LN40C650 LCD but returned it the next day because of a few issues that I couldn't get past. It had very light vertical banding in some spots (It's possible that I just got a bad one on this count), the image washed out when viewing from anywhere other than straight on, and I didn't like the way the tv dealt with motion (whether the auto-motion was turned on or not). Also, the colors didn't seem very natural although it's possible that after adjustment this would have improved.So I decided to try the Panasonic TC-P42G25, a Plasma tv, which supposedly has none of these issues (but maybe its own inherent issue, read on). I brought it home, unboxed it, attached the stand and hooked everything up. I was able to accomplish this myself but I would recommend getting some help to do this step. The stand does swivel which is a nice feature to have. I turned it on and after a short setup wizard everything was ready to go. I live in Chicago and the tv had no problem finding all the digital channels from my indoor/outdoor antenna which you can see here - [...]At first this tv looks a bit dim, but this is because by default the tv is set to standard brightness mode which is the least vibrant of the settings. I flipped through some of the other picture modes and THX seems to be bright and accurate, though I decided to leave it in standard mode for the first few days during the plasma \"break in\" period.I popped the dvd Ashes of American Flags (concert film, rock band Wilco) into a bluray player that I borrowed from someone. This film has a lot dark areas in the concert scenes which allowed me to check out the black levels. The tv automatically recognized that I was playing something and switched the source to receive video from the bluray player.If I had to describe the picture quality on this tv in one word it would be \"amazing\". Screen uniformity is perfect, no light or dark places anywhere. Colors appear natural and realistic to me. The black levels are very deep on this tv when you dim the lights a bit or close the shades in the room. Motion appears fine to me (I found the motion looked better with the blur reduction in settings turned off).The default setting for this tv is to have C.A.T.S. turned on in the settings. This adjusts the brightness of the picture depending on how much ambient light is in the room. Some people may like this feature but I turned it off.The sound is good for normal tv viewing. It sounded better to me when I turned on bass boost in the sound settings; It is possible to adjust the treble and bass also.One issue that this tv has (as well as Plasma's in general from what I've read) that LCD's don't is that the black levels don't look their best in a brightly lit room. This is not a problem for me as I prefer watching in a dim, but not pitch black, environment. To my eyes the black levels look deeper than I've ever seen on an LCD.I have not tried the network feature on this tv yet. An earlier reviewer said some of the network features may not be available yet. It won't really matter to me if this is still the case. I just want a flatscreen that does what it is supposed to do, and does it very well; This plasma delivers that.This is a polished product from Panasonic.  Please Panasonic, don't ever stop making Plasma's!****Quick update****  4/26.  When I said that the TV automatically switched the source to receive video from the bluray player, It may have done this because the bluray player that I borrowed also happened to be a Panasonic product. As to whether or not it will automatically switch the source for another brand of bluray player, you'll have to find that out for yourself.****Second update****  6/20/10. Someone had their G25 professionally calibrated and posted the settings on avsforum. I used these settings (except for the service menu offsets which are not available in the normal picture menu and I would not recommend trying) as a good starting point for THX and Custom modes.

We also purchased a Panasonic Bluray player with the TV it works nicely with SD or Bluray playback - The TV's THX certified picture setting is very pleasing and color accurate for movies - I use the Custom setting for over the air and cable TV watching with a few minor adjustment tweaks I got excellent results. Both the TV and player have internet abilities - I have used utube so far works fine.  Also I was easily able to updated the firmware for both TV and player.  Bought a Mini DVI to HDMI adapter to use my 2 yr. old MacBook computer works fine @ 1920x1080p resolution streaming Hulu etc. There is an RGB port on the TV but only lower resolutions work - since RGB is limited anyway I would use the HDMI port if your computer is 1080p capable. The sound is a little on the tinny side for me but my wife doesn't seem to mind it personally I usually use the AV amplifier when watching TV or Movies.  The TV remote is easy to use and lights up.  The BR player remote is also easy use but does not light up not sure I get that -  it makes it very awkward to use in the dark.  So I just put everything on our Sony universal 2100 remote and the wife was happy controlling all sources with one touch screen remote that lights up.One last thing - I'm keeping an eye on the alleged \"rising black levels\" but I have not notice anything yet.  I'll repost if anything comes up.  However I do recommend this TV to all it's a good value, sharp accurate picture and a great product.UPDATE 11/17/10  I promised to give an update if I noticed any alleged \"rising black levels\" Well I must have a couple of thousand hours on the set now and have not been able to detect anything significant. The black levels now look the same as the day I purchased the TV. I ran a few simple tests the day I bought the set and just the other day (won't bore you with details) so far the black level tests when compared are the same. I do expect there will eventually be some minor rise in black levels but this is true of most plasma sets anyway because of phospher life and built in bios adjustments - yawn - yawn etc. etc. -- but were talking thousands of hours here and years of viewing time. Yet at the same time if there are any changes I expect them to be very minor not so noticeable by the naked eye when viewing TV or Movie content.", "Date": "April 29, 2010"}, {"Title": "G25 label  makes the difference", "Author": "Miha Ahronovitz \"myinnervoice\"", "ReviewID": "RMVFF2U11Z57U", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I already have a Panasonic 58\" since 2006, and it is in my opinion one of the best TVs on the market. I wanted to replace  -in the second smaller family area upstairs - a TV replacing our old 32\". I bought first a Samsung 46\" LCD (not LED) and the screen seemed too big for the area. Maybe this was a subjective impression, because the view from sides was full of spots tainting the picture. They disappeared only if one sits right in front of the TV. I returned the TV next day.I looked at all Panasonic plasma. The large electronics store and Costco sell cheaper 720p versions. Even the model S2, one step below G25, although it is a 1080p, it does not have the \"infinite  black\" feature. I located the Panasonic G25 42\" in another electronic store. The difference between S2 and G25 was day and night for me. The sound is more than good  for me. One feature G25 has and S2 doesn't is the swivel from the base. Little detail, but significant in smaller rooms.The price on Amazon was good. The reputation of Amazon is re-assuring even when buying a large item like a TV. However the G25 is sold by an Amazon  third party. In the remote possibility that I need to return the item, I know from experience, Amazon policy is to redirect the buyer to the seller, and only if the authorized seller does not solve the problem, the Amazon will return the money. The process works,  but it may take months.This is the reason I purchased the Panasonic G25 locally. I highly recommend to anyone considering a TV.Added June 18, 2010: Amazon offers this TV directly. This gives most buyers a reason to purchase from Amazon.", "Date": "May 29, 2010"}, {"Title": "Worthwhile Exchange", "Author": "D. LaChance", "ReviewID": "R126WTIDE4894M", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I purchased the Panasonic 42\" plasma (TC-P42S2) from a local chain retail outlet. It was their top-of-the-line 42\" plasma in my price range. I had no particular problem with the TV, but after weighing the reviews against the Panasonic TC-P42G25 (with THX) I felt I needed to make the switch before the return window closed. The popular retailer didn't carry the G25. In fact, I could only find it online.I now have the G25, and all I can say is that the exchange was certainly worthwhile. Actually, it was night-and-day! The THX setting produced a picture quality that you just can't get with the S2. And the network features are awesome.When I returned the S2 the associate asked me if there was a problem. I told him that I really wanted the THX feature. He said (with a smile) \"good luck finding that\". (Obviously, that was in reference to the fact that THX is only available on the G25, which they didn't carry).I would suggest that if you're thinking of buying the 42\" S2, think again. The G25 is definitely a cut way above! And it was roughly the same price as the S2.As a sidebar: I thought I would like a LED/LCD. The picture was so temptingly clear at the store. Actually, it was the first TV I bought before I returned it for the plasma. The problem is that it made everything look like it was filmed on video tape. The movies were drained of their silver screen magic. Films that were made for the big screen looked like soap operas. All I could say was \"Yuck!!\" (Some things are just not meant to be that clear). For those who would appreciate those kinds of subtleties, the plasma is much better!", "Date": "October 3, 2010"}, {"Title": "Plasma vs LCD", "Author": "Panguitch Joe \"Joe\"", "ReviewID": "R2HZGGWGAOWWPL", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I wanted TV that would fit in a small room. Anything over 42 would have been too big. I also wanted a TV with all the connections (USB, Flashcard, Computer, HDMI,etc). I wanted a high refresh rate. I wanted a TV that made my Blu-ray movies look amazing and my old VHS tapes tolerable (and I wanted standard broadcasts to look good). I wanted a TV with a good viewing angle. I wanted to be able to connect to the internet. This TV does all those things very well. I'm so glad I bought it. But I had my doubts. Frankly I was worried. I'd never bought a TV online. Another issue: I bought plasma. I've never owned plasma. I've never owned LCD, but whenever I went to Best Buy or other stores, the Samsung LCD LED seemed to have the best picture than anything else and the plasma's always looked worse the LCD's. But I did a little research and learned that companies push LCD in the stores because they make more money off the LCD's. I also learned that LCD's have a brighter picture which shows better in store lighting. I really liked the advantages that the plasma seemed to offer (the best refresh rate, true blacks, no picture loss from viewing the screen off center, accurate color reproduction, amazing picture at near half the price of comparable LCD's). I love this TV. I've had no problems. Delivery went smoothly. The picture quality is amazing. I have no regrets. Only one thing to be aware of--this TV needs a wireless USB adapter to connect to the internet. It costs an extra 85$.  Didn't know that until after I set it up and realized it wasn't really internet ready out of the box.  Luckily I bought the Panasonic Blu Ray player that includes the required USB wireless adapter. Also, sound is acceptable, but I've got this TV hooked up to a surround sound system, so I wasn't worried about sound quality all that much.", "Date": "June 24, 2010"}, {"Title": "I was lookin for a LED LCD and got this ?!!!", "Author": "C. Arnold \"Multimedia shtick\"", "ReviewID": "R20WE9MOX7OZG3", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Simply put don't hesitate and buy it, I can't see how this could disappoint anyone.I give all areas 5 stars because it beats all others in its size and most bigger than this one and is extremely well priced even at suggested retail. I have had this for about three weeks as of this writing.Picture - USE THE SETTINGS IN THE NUMBER ONE REVIEW!!!!! The factory settings do not do this set justice. I own a 52\" Samsung B750 (18 mo old), had compared that to the Samsung LED versions side by side at the time (they were slightly better in black levels and had been waiting to see the 9000 as it's predecessor 900 model still was the best I had ever seen. But this set really gives the 9000 a run for the money. I cannot say it is a better picture than the 9000. I saw both recently in the same store and compared pictures; the Samsung still wins but that may have been based on factory settings. BUT you can not get a 9000 in a 42 inch and the 46 inch 9000 is three times the price. The black levels are VERY comparable the samsung seemed to pop more in the store. The 600hz is great for sports and shows the difference between it and Samsungs 240hz models; at least to me (no one else sees the detail unless I point it out to them). THX certified and state of the art 3D capable with more preset picture settings than my Samsung and all of them are customizable. The biggest negative usually leveled at plasmas is glare issues. The matte screen does a great job of ending this issue in my opinion and with a little basic placemant planning I have no issues with a big picture window next to my set (TV at 45 degress to 10 degrees). Buy a swing arm mount if you must (I must for other than glare issues). I do not see this unit as having any more glare issues than my LED unit and far less than the laptop I am writing this on.Sound - 20 watt speakers very adequate and has easy settings to accommodate your tastes. It fills my living room and kitchen area (30' X 40') nicely. I have put off adding surround speakers to my media center computer for this station until later...Ease of use - Set up was very easy and had the basics down within the first day. It tuned and listed all the channels easily (comcast cable without a set top box) and I could easily remove the SD channels from the list where it saw duplicate HD channels. Allowing me to skip from channel to channel while man surfing more easily if using the built in TV tuner. Manual could be a little better written but whose couldn't. I adapted easily to the remote, the TV set up functions and integrated a computer. My home network saw the TV and added it instantly. The built in network features beat Samsung hands down. Customized the weather page easily and had my Netflix account tied in within moments of logging into Netflix on my computer. My computer automatically adapted to the Panasonic and media center works well. No out of sync sound/video issues. Still need to run a link from the TV to a surround sytem or off the computer to double check any other possible sync issues. Added an xBox with Kinect last week and use that as an expander from my main media center computer downstairs and can simultaneously play the same TV station in sync on both TV's and tune the HD set top box! Sweet!!! Oh yes it plays games very well though I am not a high tech gamer the Kinect system has me as giddy as when I got my Commodore 64 way back when.Bonuses - very low energy usage for any type of TV! You can add network security cameras to this thing!I can see where having only three HDMI inputs might be an issue to some but I am having a hard time figuring out why someone would need more. I use HDMI for my computer (built in 3D Blue ray player) and xBox. That sill leaves room for a dedicated HD set top box.So it isn't a trendy one inch thick and cannot be easily carried by one person. Maybe that will keep somebody from breaking in and stealing it...  cause if they knew what to steal this would be gone.(I am using a hard wired home network and would recommend this even if you need to use a Broadband over powerline adaptor over wireless networking if you cannot run wires.)", "Date": "November 15, 2010"}, {"Title": "Great TV - but Skype / Netflix / Twitter not available yet....", "Author": "Jyotika Lamba", "ReviewID": "R36MPPK9050JED", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "Got the TV yesterday. Bought this one from Vann's. They delivered the TV a day late.I went by the instructions provided and let the tv lay around to warm up to room temperature for about 4 hours.Started her up; connected it to the LAN cable first cos I was excited to watch Netflix and Skype on it. The main reason I bought this TV was because it was the next gen release of the famous G10 series TV's with THX. The TV started up and asked me \"A software update is available, proceed?\" I never had my TV ask me that before :o)15 minutes later.....Started the VieraCast feature (this is where all the widgets for Youtube, Netflix, Skype, Fox Sports, Pandora, Twitter reside...) and guess what ?Skype - Coming Soon....Twitter - Coming Soon....Fox Sports - Coming Soon...Netflix - Wait... where did it go?? Huh? Spoke the the Panasonic CSR and they told me Netflix will be available by late summer. So what does that make Netflix? Coming Soon.....1)Youtube Videos - Available and working. Saw a couple of videos too.2)Amazon Video on Demand - Working - starts buffering sometimes and not as smooth in delivery as Netflix. Quality is good though. If you register with Amazon before May 31st - u get a 5$ credit. So I signed up and watched a free movie - 2012 on HD.3)Weather Update - Nice, works.The TV is by far the best I've seen. No doubt about it. I've been patiently researching the Panasonic P42G10 for over 6 months before they launched this and I pounced right on the new release for the price. Absolutley no regrets on picture quality, looks and product capability.Im giving this 4 Stars cos Panasonic claimed they have features that work.... they dont. Well, not yet they dont. They are \"Coming Soon\".....So until the next round of software updates. I guess I'll just connect my laptop and watch netflix.Will update more soon.Finally, all the app widgets Panasonic claimed are now here!! Netflix was available for download as of last night (I got this info thanx to one of the buyers here)Ran Netflix; and all I can say is - wow! the quality of the videos are way better than that of a typical laptop or an iphone video.I did find issues with animations though... this could be a bandwidth issue though... your experience may vary.Skype is still on BETA mode... so expect a few updates there.One final comment that really disappoints me about my purchase - the price I Paid for this TV was about 1200$....and thats ok. What I find extremely unfair is that this TV is now being offered at a much cheaper price WITH the network camera for free. And I just bought this a couple of months ago.Sorry, but I have to bring my ratings down of Amazon for this.Ok, quick update - I have been receiving comments from some readers on how \"unfair\" it is to downgrade a rating. Let me make this as clear as I can - My review is based on my \"complete experience\" with my purchase. I agree that all electronics drop in value over a period of time, but good brands and products do hold their value over a period of time as well. I Wish I could give separate ratings for the purchase experience, product experience to make it clear. So here goes.Product - 5 Stars - HD Videos, Blu - Ray Movie Quality (Outstanding), Netflix HD streaming (Outstanding)Seller - 4 Stars - Package arrived a day late, carton had a few nicks and scratchesAmazon + Seller experience - 3 stars - I stand by my earlier statement - A buyer pays a price for a good brand/product because they believe its worth the investment. It just doesn't go down well when u see that its gone down by almost 500$ with freebies in just 4 months after purchase. Panasonic offers the camera free of cost TODAY cos the Skype app is available NOW. What about customers like us who bought this 4 months thinking it was available on VieraCast???? Neither Amazon nor Vann's made an effort to let us know. Its not a fair practice. That's all Im saying.The reviews I post are to help people.

The screen quality is great, but I was told in a small room 720p is fine and you don't need 1080p.  Salesman was right, so for the bigger room we went with the 1080.The hookup is easy to do if you are familiar with the different types of cords, svideo vs hdmi. I wasn't but I figured it out as the instructions were simple.  I HIGHLY advised an HDMI cable if you are going to stream movies like Netflix as you won't get as good quality without it.The instructions don't cover Viera hook up to wireless too well..in other words I kept doing it over and over, only to discover by internet search that my wireless modem was way out of date so the TV didn't recognize it. Hmmm...think they could have listed in the instructions which ones work with their system??Basically you need a wireless system that is an N system for streaming and I am by no means an internet or computer expert so I didn't know that. Most of the ones in the last few years are just that. So I had to buy a new Cisco wireless to get it to work. Now it works great, the TV/blueray combo reconized the wireless right away.I have seen comments that this system doesn't work unless the wireless is practically in the room..I think that is based on the age of the wireless system. With a new one (under $100), mine is at the end of the house, TV in the front and no problems.About the sound...occasionally I will hear a humming with the sound, but I have localized it to old movies so I think the original sound quality was not too good.

I will update my review once the new TV arrives. If the buzzing is gone, it should be a great one.I bought this TV based on an excellent personal review from a friend of mine and also the reviews here on Amazon. I read the negative reviews about the buzzing noise, but most said that it wasn't a problem once you had the volume up so I decided to order anyway.The picture is excellent. Games look incredible compared to LCD. Xbox 360 and Blu Ray are both far superior on this TV compared to the LG LED LCD that I purchased last week. It's so sad that I have to return the TV because of the horrible buzzing noise it produces. I can't for the life of me figure out how so many of you are able to ignore this problem. I mean, it's not just a noise, it's a high pitched squeal that rattles your brains. I've read that many people lose the ability to hear higher frequencies of sound with age and I can only imagine this is why some people can ignore this TV's flaw. It is a very high frequency pitch. Sitting 6 feet away, I can here it clearly. It only gets worse with Game or Vivid setting. I really wanted to try and get around this, because this TV is truly a beautiful picture, but after 3 days, it's too much for me to bear. I feel relieved every time I turn off the set. Perhaps Panasonic can market it as a way to get people to watch less TV.One other thing of note, I called Panasonic's support to ask for some help with the buzzing issue. They informed me at that time that the 42\" TV only qualifies for \"Walk in\" warranty, meaning that you have to physically bring the 50lb TV to a local repair center. This may be difficult if you're like me and don't own a car. Just a heads up.edit: I just found this youtube video that explains the buzzing problem. [...]. It's caused by a loose screw on the circuit board.

Evans \"CE\"", "ReviewID": "RXGFQN63C6OSQ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "We originally started shopping for Sharp LED TVs since those are the latest & greatest thing, and while there are some advantages, we were directed by a saleperson at HHGreg to the plasmas for truly \"black\" blacks and clarity of picture. Glare can be a problem with plasmas, and that was a concern, but this model has an anti-glare filter that does make a difference. We do get a little reflection from lamps but if you place them properly, you can easily work around it.We've been very happy with our choice. The picture is so clear, and so far there's been no problems with the TV. We got a PS3 with it for blue-ray and games, and it's been a great combo (you'll just want to get a separate remote if you do that, since using the PS3 controller isn't the best). Do note that you're supposed to keep the contrast low on the TV for the first 100 hours or so to avoid burnout, before you crank it up, when you're doing your initial adjustments. And you really can tweak/calibrate the TV to your preference. The only thing we might have done is get the 46\" but there wasn't one available at the time.The shipping service was wonderful. We were nervous about it for lots of reasons, but it was easy to schedule, I received an e-mail confirmation AND the shipper called to confirm, then a couple days later they even called back to say they were in the area and could deliver it early.

Robertson", "ReviewID": "R2N1RSEFNFHA4T", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This is first plasma tv after owning a rear projection tv for 9 years.  I like to do a lot of research before buying any electronic goods and it led me to choose plasma over lcd for a televison.One of the drawbacks you hear about plasma tv's are the energy consumption as well as burn in issues.  The panasonic tv is apparantly much lower in energy compared to older plasma's and are not far off lcd's for energy consumption.  Also, the image burn in, although can still be a problem when simple guidelines are not taken, is not really a factor anymore.I purchased the tv through amazon and it was delivered in the allcoated timeframe that I chose when I purchased the tv.  The gentleman unpacked the tv and installed the tv onto the supplied base stand which sat on top of my corner tv stand.  The tv is fairly heavy and is actually quite difficult to push over.  This was a concern of mine since we have a young daughter but the tv is far enough back that she cannot reach it.  There is also a hole in the panasonic base where you can drill a screw into your own stand and I plan to do this.The tv picked up our cable channels no problem and the remote and option guide by panasonic were easy to use.  The picture quality of the HD channels through my cable were excellent and considerably sharper and clearer than my old projection tv.  We mostly watch all of our cable tv on the available HD channels and we are very happy with the picture quality.  We don't have a blu ray player but hooked up my Ono up-conversion dvd player and when we watched Sherlock Holmes we were blown away.  I cannot imagine what blu ray must look like and we only had our old component cables hooked up (plan to get HDMI cables soon).  What was most different from my old tv were the dark scenes.  They were so much easier and clearer to see and I guess one of the advantages of plasma over lcd are the black levels.  It made the movie so much more of an enjoyable experience.  I do not have surround sound but the speakers are adequate and of good sound quality.  Like I said we have a young daughter so we cannot have the tv on too lound when she is asleep.One of the other reasons we bought this tv were the options it has such as netflix, youtube and skype.  Skype is not available until some time in the summer and I cannot wait to have videocalls with my family overseas.  It does require a LAN adaptor if your internet is not close by to hook up and it would have been nice if this was included in the price of the tv.  There is one available that comes with the panasonic blu ray player I plan on getting (DMP BD-85) which is wi-fi enabaled.  However, in the mean time I have netflix through my Wii and the picture quality was much better than I though it would be for streaming movies.  We have verizon fios so have a fairly fast wi-fi connection.Overall I am very happy with this tv and am looking forward to many years of tv and movie watching.", "Date": "May 24, 2010"}, {"Title": "Gorgeous Picture - Nice Additional Features Too", "Author": "J.

I then tried the Panasonic TC-P42S2 42-Inch 1080p Plasma HDTV. I hated just about everything about it - I liked the C2 much more than the S2. But I finally went with this P42G25 and I couldn't be happier.The picture is remarkable. The colors are beautifully rich and vivid, and the blacks are an incredibly deep black. There are five picture modes to choose from within the menu options; standard, vivid (for viewing in sunnier environments), game, THX and custom while each offers several options for some comprehensive fine tuning. The THX mode faithfully replicates the theater experience and makes Blu-ray movies astonishingly gorgeous!I like that the stand allows me to rotate the set 15\u00b0 in either direction. The anti-glare screen is much better than that found on the S2 series. The input connections suit more than all of my needs. Inputs, based on their customizable input labels, can conveniently be automatically selected when switching to the respective viewing mode. The Viera Image Viewer plays media from an SD card or USB device with a host of playback options.The built in speakers are good - sufficient enough to keep me from using my AV surround receiver until prime time programming begins. Audio options include bass, treble, balance and a handful of simple advanced audio options such as levelers, bass boost and pretend surround.These Panasonic plasmas do not offer detailed program information or listings. The info button will display the program title of what's currently playing along with a couple of attributes such as rating, and resolution. I like the sleep timer, which can be set to 15, 30, 60 or 90 minute intervals. There are also five programmable timers to turn the set on or off and which let you specify input, channel, day and times.I enjoy having the VieraCast features which currently offer customizable weather, Skype, Twitter, YouTube, Picasa web albums, Amazon video on demand, Netflix, Pandora internet radio, tagesschau, Bloomberg and Fox Sports. I can customize the layout, modify options and discover new portal content through the VieraCast settings portal; I just found they've added another German content portal, \"Bild.de.\" Hopefully, they will add a portal for the broadcast program listings which, unfortunately, their built-in menus lack.There are so many wonderful things about this TV and the rich colors and the way that the infinite dark black compliments them is what tops the list.  VieraCast adds tremendous convenience value (yet would benefit greatly from a program listing guide) to the G25 as well. I absolutely love everything this TV has to offer. I am completely satisfied with it and recommend it as a great value.", "Date": "January 24, 2011"}, {"Title": "I am so happy!!!!!!", "Author": "D. Jacobs \"D.

What made this TV stand out from the others I looked at was simply the quality of the picture, it just looked better(and cost less) than most of the other plasmas and LED-LCD sets in the stores.For those consumers who may still be worried about the burn-in problems that plagued plasma sets of old, this is no longer an issue with a set like this because it has a number of features built in that greatly minimize any chance of burn-in. I have played PS3(and other)games for hours on end and there is absolutely no indication of burn-in of any kind.The only negative comments I can make about this set(I am being very nitpicky here), is that the audio output of the tv speakers is average at best, but I assume most people will hook this up through their home theater system anyway.

I haven't seen the Samsung's in person, but in the store where I purchased this Panasonic, the LG's don't make significant buzzing sounds, whereas standing near the Panasonic plasmas feels like standing in a field listening to insect mating calls.

I called Panasonic and was advised that a 42 inch set has a carry in warranty and to take to a local warranty repair station.  They replaced the circuit board in about 10 days.  We got it back and it ran ok until March 24th, when the same problem occurred.  I took it back for another warranty repair and am still waiting for the new circuit board to arrive at the repair depot.I must also say that we have the exact same model in the 54 inch screen size and it has operated perfectly for the year we have had it.

I had received previous promises for when the needed parts would arrive, which, did not happen.  This was not due to faulty information from the repair station, rather due to changes from Panasonic.  My new ETA on the part is May 12.  This is not a good sign.  Either there is a large demand for this repair part or Panasonic is not carrying enough of them to service their repair stations.

I've always had good experiences with Panasonic TVs so wasn't too surprised to find that the type (plasma) and size (42\") that I was looking for was already top rated on the Panasonic P42G25.  While the shipping was not what Amazon stated, it took the delivery company an extra 10 days to deliver, it was well shipped & protected, and did arrive a few days before Christmas.  The setup was quite easy to follow and while I didn't have enough HDMI cables to connect all the components the menu was easy enough to get back into and change everything around from composite to HDMI once I got all the proper cables.  The picture quality is awesome especially to watch sports on an HD channel, it's just fantastic! I have viewed several of these models in stores but I think they \"tweak down\" the better quality TVs so their cheaper quality models that they make more mark-up on sell better, because the quality on this TV is much better in home than what I've viewed in stores.  The menu also makes it easy to switch between display modes from THX to vivid, etc. so you can adjust to meet the lighting conditions, we have a large east facing window and get a lot of light in the morning so use vivid to get a better picture so we can still get the warming benefit from the sun. Sound quality is good enough for everyday viewing but really should be hooked up to a home theater system to get the best experience which is what we have it hooked up to. Only minor drawback so far is the optional wireless attachment I got with it.  It's not part of the TV so I didn't ding the rating for it but it sometimes loses connectivity to the internet even though the wireless router is just situated on the floor just below the TV.

I happened to meet a Panasonic rep at a local electronics store. She spent a lot of time with me explaining the improvements to plasma over the past few years. After further research I decided on plasma vs LCD. All the info I have read online favors plasma in most applications. Motion blur was a concern for me as well and the fast refresh rate of plasma was one deciding factor. I finally decided on the Panasonic after reading a lot of online reviews and watching it at the eletronics store. I ordered the TV from Amazon at the beginning of December. Delivery was right on time. The packaging is scary when you first see it - Amazon puts the TV box inside of a much larger carboard shell which protects it from getting banged around in transit. The outer box was banged up pretty good, but once I removed it I saw that the protective shell did its job. I did set up the TV and place it on its stand on my own, but I would not recommend that. It is not heavy but it is so large that picking it up and setting it on the posts was a delicate operation and if I had it to do again I would have asked a neighbor for help. Once I set it up I ran the TV channel autoprogram, which took quite a while - like 15 or 20 minutes. I'm glad I did though because I do not have a cable box (yet) and the auto program detected far more HD programming than I thought was available. I do have a DSL connection with an ethernet cable, and the Vieracast set up was as simple as plugging in the cable and hitting the button on the remote. I quickly set up Netflix (one or 2 easy set up steps on your PC) and was watching Netflix right away. The first DVD I watched was \"The Pacific\" on Blue Ray Hi Def, and it is amazing! Awesome color and very good sound even without surround speakers. I've owned a lot of TVs and I think the complaints about this TV's sound quality are overblown - I find it to be just fine. The THX picture is definitely the best, altough I did discover after some tinkering that the TV was pre-set to \"warm\" color temp; I was even more pleased after changing that to normal and increasing brightness and color. I think this TV is fantastic overall - all the features I wanted, amazing picture, and tons of customization options.I have also watched \"Planet Earth\" and many other Blue Ray DVDs and the picture quality is just astounding. If I was going to change one thing, it would have been to buy the 50\" instead. My TV is about 10 feet from my couch and after having the TV for a while I think a larger one would be nicer. Only annoying thing to me is the remote is shaped weird on the bottom and is constantly falling off the armrest. Watching NFL playoffs right now and it is awesome in high def! As far as using the features, Vieracast is easy. Programming channels is kind of a pain and it took me a while to get it right. There is a nice feature to choose how you surf (HD only, etc.) but it took me forever to program. The remote does have a \"light up\" feature so you can illuminate the buttons while watching a movie in the dark. For every day viewing I set the picture as follows: custom mode, contrast 65, brightness 75, color 70, tint 0 and sharpness 85. This is after watching various movies and sports. Also, color temp set to normal.

Tried both and each worked the same w/ the same data rate. Also purchased the Skype camera to go with this TV so I could Skype my daughter in South Korea. Noticed that the video signal isn't very good, so the call video is a bit choppy. Not sure how to correct that issue.When I bought this, on Cyber Monday, the Panasonic Sound Bar & wireless subwoofer were added in for no extra cost, and it sounds great. A $240 accessory for free?

I happened to be able to test S2 and G25 at the exact same location in my house (another story), and to my untrained eyes there was no difference, though there's supposed to be some at least in catalog spec. But note that there's no PC input (VGA connector) on S2.Anyway, here're my impressions about G25.Viera Cast: 5 stars for Netflix, 2 for youtube.It's so convenient not to have to use another device just to watch Netflix on TV. I don't need multiple remotes for this any more.I still need my PC to manage my instant queue because the Netflix user interface on TV is not really made for the task in my opinion, but the same can be said for Wii Netflix that I used to use before this TV. I can live with that.Searching through youtube without normal keyboard is a pain. It would be awesome if I can connect a wireless keyboard to the USB port of the TV.I haven't tried other network things yet.Picture quality: 5 starsExcellent. Dark is dark.Sound: 3 stars (for built in speakers)It's not that bad, but not excellent either. Amazon package deal meant that I got Panasonic soudbar with subwoofar for free, though. With this deal it's 5 stars.Viera Link: 4 starsIntegration with Panasonic sound bar is perfect. Sound bar turns on/off with the TV, I don't need sound bar remote. If you want you can switch between the sound bar and the TV speaker using the TV remote.Integration with my Panasonic DVD/VHS recorder (yes VHS, I still have some tapes that I actually watch!) is not perfect, though.I can turn on the recorder, start/stop playing or recording, fast forward, pause, back, all by using TV remote. That seems to be about it.For anything else, e.g. switching the media source on the recorder (DVD/VHS/whatever) or programming (\"record CH15 from 11PM to midnight\"), I still need the recorder remote.", "Date": "January 6, 2011"}, {"Title": "So far so good.", "Author": "R.

The sound is decent but it could be better. For me I got a Panasonic sound-bar and sub-woofer free with mine, so I'm not worried about that. It's no where near anything bad enough to take anything away from this TV, it's just not computer gaming sound, but not many TV's are. It's plenty good enough for most people. I would not have gone out and bought the sound-bar & sub-woofer separately. That was just icing on the cake.  :)The BAD!:It's a good thing the packaging was good, because the delivery service (Pilot) was awful! I never received any delivery setup phone call. I had to call them when the TV was late. It still took 4 more days to get it even though the TV was less than 150 miles away. I could have drove there and back in under 4 hours. The 2 delivery guys were rude and in a rush. They didn't carry or even offer to help carry the TV to my porch let alone into the house. I had to do it myself!

The way they acted I pretty sure they weren't very delicate with my order or anyone else's in their van. Never again will I order anything from Amazon that requires a 3rd party freight shipper! Nothing against Amazon but Pilot will never see any more business from me if I can help it! I'm just over-joyed the TV was alright.My Verdict:This TV is awesome!

It looked gorgeous in HD, gaming, etc..While it is true that Standard Picture quality is pretty poor, the gorgeous colors and depth of black makes up for it when you are watching in HD, DVD, Blu-Ray, and Xbox/PS3 gaming.However, no picture can be good enough for me if it buzzes while you are listening to it.  I did a lot of research and it turns out that the buzzing issue is very prominent.It was annoying enough that I decided to do an exchange since it is \"defective.\"I got my new TV and it is just as bad if not worse in terms of audible Buzzing.

I have had this product for several months now and have had nothing but a positive experience and excellent performance from it.

This is the first plasma we have owned and are so amazed and happy with its performance and quality of picture that we will never purchase another type of display than plasma or without THX certification from this point forward!!! We enjoy horror and suspense movies and have finally figured out what was happening in all of those dark scenes (that we guessed about on our LCD TVs), because plasma can produce such deep blacks that you can actually see the smallest details in those dark scenes. We also enjoy good action flicks and never see a blur or any \"lag\". Burn in is not a problem anymore due to the picture in a constant circular motion of 4 pixels (and completely impossible to notice the movement). We found the settings where someone had their THX mode professionally calibrated and it makes the picture perfect. Our tv never leaves THX mode, and I personally think that all tv's should have it after seeing it (thank you George Lucas)!!! Finally, to end with putting your fears of plasma to rest, this television out-performs any television that I have seen and we have NOT experienced any of the negative things that some others claim (such as loss of depth of black, etc.) So, if you are considering going with plasma, just make sure it has THX certification and GO FOR IT!!!", "Date": "April 16, 2011"}, {"Title": "Just love my new Plasma", "Author": "Larry Fuerman \"LARRY\"", "ReviewID": "R2WBOTI121Q9GO", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "There is a very great contrast between the Black and White intensities of a plasma that I don't see anywhere else.

The base is heavy and sturdy and it rotates easily to access the connections in the back without making me nervous.TV/Network Setup: Very easy - although it did have some trouble communicating with my network (it's a complicated setup), Panasonic tech support was excellent and gave me a workaround.It often \"forgets\" the connection and I have to run the network test pretty frequently, but that's probably just me.TV/Movie Picture: Great!Video Game Picture: Great!

The HDMI connect is flawless, and it also has VGA.Sound: Good - I wish it had more audio-out options to connect to my sound system.  Check for compatibility.Internet Features:  Really good.

I almost bought a 42\" Panasonic Plasma 4 years ago costing 1/3 more even though Bing had issued me a 5% rebate towards my new purchase, but thank goodness I've waited -- and it is worth the wait! During the process of pre-purchasing this television, I have been reading up A LOT about the TC-P42G25 and comparing it to the likes of LG, Samsung, and others from Panasonic, but features from THIS particular model (1080p, VieraCast, Neo PDP Panel) had put my debates to rest for good. I live in a small apartment with about 20'x30' of living-room space, my setup consists of about 6 audio decks housed behind a glass-door entertainment cabinet with a hutch-over designed for a regular tube TV up to 32\" which was previously occupied by an 8 year-old Panasonic 27\" Pure-Flat Display and still worked well to this day. I had my cabinet modified and ready to fit the 42\" wide display. I ordered the plasma on Feb. 1st and the unit was delivered to me by CEVA arriving 3 days earlier than the scheduled delivery date (even better) and the box was in MINT condition. Two guys carried it up to me but I opted to handle everything by myself since I have a very complex setup. It worked out well and beyond my expectations. Also, thanks for the prompt and courteous service from CEVA. Now, let's get to the plasma....Setting up was easy; you slide the bracket in and secure 4 screws to the back of the TV, 3 more to the swiveling-pedestal and you're good to go. I lifted the set to my cabinet by myself, it wasn't as heavy and complicated as it seems but I do recommend a second set of hands just to play it safe. All the Input terminals are well laid out and clearly marked. There is however only ONE Digital Audio OUT via Toslink and unfortunately, 'Analog' audio out has since been omitted from the earlier G20 series. I also like the fact that they kept the functionality controls (Power, Volume and Channel buttons, etc.) on the left instead of to the right side of the panel like the newer 2011 'S' and 'ST' series. Some people think that the USB ports on the side of the panel is a negative, but to me it's a huge positive since I don't use a wifi dongle, but I use a USB Flash drive a lot to view photos. It is very convenient when all you have to do is stick it to the side instead of having to get to the back of the TV.Features and picture quality:I opted to route a 50' Ethernet Cat5 cable from my router to the plasma instead of using a wireless adapter due to its inconsistency and slower wireless performance; hit VieraCast on the lighted remote and I was streaming Netflix movies instantly!VieraCast apps are also well organized consisting of Weather, Skpe, Twitter, Youtube, Picasa Web Albums, Amazon Video and Netflix on the front page, plus a few others on subsequent pages. By the looks of it, it seems that Panasonic is reserving a few empty boxes for more additions in the future, but for now, it is a good dose. Watching movies in HD from Netflix streaming is crystal clear, even better than DVDs but the videos seemed `choppy' at times during fast-pace scenes and I believe the fault lies in Netflix due to its streaming nature, or possibly from my 8-year old big blue double-antenna Linksys running in `G'. It also interrupts in the middle of a movie for 'buffering', not a big deal and it doesn't happen all the time. I had all input and source settings in THX mode for viewing, for Netflix, I have it in Cinema mode.I immediately upgraded to HD cable a couple of days after I received the TV because like all HDTVs, broadcasts for SD contents are horrendous, to a point where it is almost impossible to watch, but HD pictures (1080i from cable) are crystal clear. You can also achieve this by using an 'amplified' antenna to broadcast regular channels if you don't want (or don't have) cable services but you'll be missing a lot of channels in the upper 100s-700s.Also, `image retention' can easily be wiped clean by watching something which covers the whole screen. However, since plasmas are phosphor-based, one should be cautious about leaving any bright-white static image or logo on the screen for a lengthy period of time to prevent permanent image retentions known as \"image burn-in\"; in my case, a minor branded logo seems to have taken the toll of the screen for a few days now and have yet to fade. Aside from that, I have not seen others since the phosphors aged a bit within its first 100-200 hours of regular viewings.Buzzing?Like most plasmas, you do hear a slight buzz during bright scenes, but only if the volume level is set to almost '0', now I'm not sure who watches TV like that. To be honest, I don't really hear it unless I lowered my volume and track it, but everything else seems to work normal so far. The manual even states that the slight buzz is normal, but who cares, I couldn't help but to brag more about the picture quality - which is the best experience for me so far coming from a television.Sound:I am surprised that the speakers from the panel actually performed better than I'd expected it. The voices are crystal clear and more than enough to deliver dialogues. They worked just as well as my older Panasonic with front-firing speakers. If you expect 'Bass', you're not going to get it with these types of TV, no matter what make/model, and if you're buying a TV like this without adding bigger speakers or upgrading to a Home Theater receiver than you might as well stick to the old adage of tube TV. I paired this with a Denon AVR-2310CI and a set of Polk Audio 5.1 surrounds, turned the lights off, cranked it up to a comfortable level and it left me speechless.Now, the ONLY thing left subscribing to is `popcorn'.Pros:Excellent Pictures, true deep blackInternet Streaming2 USB inputsSwivel Base PedestalLighted RemoteCons:Remote sensor located in the middle of bottom panel frame (easily blocked by Center Channel speaker, had to move it to the side)No Analog Audio OUT for older receivers (not a big deal if you're ready to spend the $$$ upgrading to a newer receiver)Aspect Ratio adjustments can be challenging especially for watching 4:3 SD contents.Despite mfg claims, Plasma panels are still prone to Image Burns if basic guidelines are not properly followed.Last but not least: Amazon has been great as always, they were able to match the price during their last promotion shortly after my unit was shipped, PLUS an additional promo honored. Everything worked out the way I planned, so overall it's been a very positive buying experience -- and again, it was worth the wait!", "Date": "February 22, 2011"}, {"Title": "As advertised and reviewed", "Author": "Christy Johnson", "ReviewID": "R1Y1P7XGUKZ0B7", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I purchased this tv for our bedroom after a great deal of research and review.  To sum up the reviews, what you see is what you get.  An amazing tv that has a few small issues that should not discourage anyone from purchasing.  THe picture is incredible (once you adjust from factory settings), the internet connection allowing for Netflix downloads is easy and a nice feature - the pandora internet radio was a nice plus as well. Sound is what you would expect, adequate, but not amazing.  The swivel feature of the stand is a very underated plus.The small negatives are as you have read.  The non-HD channels do show a small white line at the top of the screen and the buzzing sound does become slightly (I emphasize slightly) more noticeable.  The much discussed buzzing is what kept me from purchasing sooner - way too much made of this.  If you have the sound turned all the way down and it is on a commercial, you can hear a soft buzz similar to a refrigerator hum.  If you turn the sound up even a little, this is a NON ISSUE. I keep the volume low before bed and have zero issue with the buzz.IF that is your hang up, buy the TV, you will not be disappointed.

Went with the plasma since anti glare is good and wanted no pixelation in fast scenes. Very happy with the picture and settings.Internet.

It is hard to see which functions are set and when the satellite box was hooked up through the system the screen would turn pink sometimes.

We are looking forward to many years of top notch entertainment.The only concerns we have about this TV relate to the frustration of delivery and set-up.Related to delivery, the first attempt to deliver the TV was aborted because they did not have a phone number for me. To my knowledge no attempt was made to reach me by email, or using the phone number on the account which is set up under my wife's name. I also had cell phone notification via text message set up. I stayed home an entire day, anticipating this delivery.When the TV was finally delivered the men from Home Direct brought it in to the room where it was to be used and set the box on the floor, asking me to sign a statement that the box was not damaged. It was my understanding that the unit would be unpacked and inspected by the delivery people, in accordance with Amazon's written policy regarding \"Televisions 42\" or Larger.\" One reviewer on the Amazon site even said that they set it up for her. I asked the delivery folks about that and they said they would not take it out of the box.The TV is connected to a Panasonic Home Theater System, SC-HTB500, which in turn is connected to a Panasonic Blu-ray Disc Player DMP-BD45 using HDMI cables. Playback from the DMP-BD45 seems to work very well with excellant sound and picture. However, sound from the TV would not work with the HTB500. I contacted Panasonic customeer service and was told I needed a Digital Optical Audio cable as the TV is not ARC compatable. Yet the TV manual states that the TV supports \"HDMI Control 5\" functions (page 63) and that HDMI Control 5 includes Audio Return Channel (ARC). See page 36. There even is an ARC label on the back of the TV by the HDMI connections. At best this can be construed as missleading. Anyhow I purchased an Optical Audio cable and the system works fine.Other than the problem with the sound the TV was easy to set up. The connection with my enternal computer network set up automaticly.

I was not looking at plasma TVs at all until I received the Amazon sale notice for the Panasonic VIERA TC-P42G25 42-Inch 1080p plasma HDTV in my email. At $600, I figured that it was worth a look. I ended up submitting my purchase order a few hours later.Early plasmas ran hot, consumed a lot of power, and were prone to static image burn-in and image quality degradation over time. But the industry has had a decade to refine the design of plasma TVs, and it shows. LCD TVs have improved a great deal as well, particularly the ones that use LED backlighting, but the 600 Hz refresh combined with the direct illumination of the plasma design still provides the best picture available - very sharp with deep blacks and no motion blur. At around 3\" thick, it is quite a bit thicker than the latest generation of LED-LCD TVs. But it is still plenty thin enough to hang on a wall.On a side note, my HDTV research indicates that you should get a plasma TV if you want 3D. The reviews of 3D on the latest LED-LCD HDTVs are not favorable at all. Please note that this set (G-series) does not support 3-D, but the GT and VT series do.Summary - great picture, realistic color (I used a calibration set up that I found on the web for this TV), solid sound (compared to my previous set). I consider this set to be a terrific HDTV value, especially at the sale price. And the 50\" GT version is available for less than $1000, if you want to go bigger. The high end of the lineup are the V and VT series.I have only owned the set for about a month, so I cannot comment on the possible long term issues that some have reported with other plasmas, such as gradual loss of contrast (graying of blacks). But I can say that the buzzing that some people have reported is not an issue for me - just a very slight buzz if you put your ear near the back of the set.", "Date": "March 15, 2011"}, {"Title": "AWESOME TV!", "Author": "jaanku", "ReviewID": "R3RCOMX7NCO3I8", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "This tv was on sale on Amazon for a great price so I couldn't not buy it.

The picture quality is excellent, and would most likely improve once the TV is calibrated.  I only detect a slight amount of false contouring, which demonstrates how much video processors in digital TVs have come in recent years.  There are many picture controls including standard, advanced, and pro settings.  The remote is simple, typical Panny Viera style, only larger to accommodate the additional functions of this set.  It is back lit, but only when you press a \"light\" button.  It is also very easy to use.  I have not had any issues with the \"buzzing\" some have reported, in fact, I find it to be almost the same as the buzzing found on all plasmas and old CRTs.  The menus are very easy to navigate and pretty intuitive.The only issues I have with this TV are that it cannot properly handle 24p playback (it only does 48hz, which will give you judder), and the Viera Cast interface is clunky.  For instance, there is no screen saver feature when using Pandora Radio, so you will get image retention or burn in if used too long.  For Netflix, you only have a small selection of titles and cannot search for titles either.  Therefore, to have titles to watch in your instant queue, you need to log in to Netflix on your computer or game console to add titles, then go back to your TV to watch them.  I found the picture quality when using Netflix to be far less than when the PS3 is used on my older Panny 720p set.  Prior to using any of the Viera Cast features like Netflix, I have to reconnect the TV to my wireless network each day.  It seems that every time I power the TV on, it doesn't connect to my wireless network properly.  The USB connections should also be on the back to connect the wireless adapter, since the adapter will stick out the side of the TV when connected, which ruins the aesthetic value of the set.  I bought this TV for my bedroom, since I will not need anything large, or with 3D in that environment, and because it had the Viera Cast feature, which would enable me to keep the PS3 and other devices in the living room.  Unfortunately, I feel the Viera Cast features are not particularly useful on this device and now I will have to either connect my PC to this TV or purchase another PS3 if I want to watch movies in my bedroom.

Harris \"The Voice of Reason\"", "ReviewID": "R1W5HZOJOTWP6M", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I agonized for a long time over what plasma to buy and ultimately settled on this one.  It's been good so far but not perfect.On the second day of use it developed a problem with the picture.  Whenever I turn on the set after it being off for several hours, there is about a one minute grace period before a series of white flashes appear onscreen.  The white-out covers all or part of the screen and lasts for about 2 or 3 minutes, then ceases.  It has happened every time I turn on the TV except for the very first time.  I have not mishandled the set at all nor is there anything near the TV causing any electrical interference.I called Panasonic and they gave me the name of the Panasonic-certified repair shop in my hometown.  Because it is a 42\" TV I will have to cart it over to the shop myself.  Larger models merit an in-house service call.I'm hoping this is correctable glitch and not a problem with the model design.Additionally, I have a slight qualm with the aspect ratio choices.  For films with certain aspect ratios (specifically with the DVD of \"Capricorn One\") the only way to display it in the OAR is to watch it in \"windowbox\" screening format (a combination of pillarboxing and letterboxing, or having the black bars on all four sides of the image).  My regular CRT TV didn't require this playback mode.  I can play it in ZOOM mode and still get about 95 percent of the image, but there is some loss in image quality.Lesson I learned?  Enjoy certain content on my Panasonic plasma but keep my CRT set for viewing certain other content that the Panny can't seem to handle (or that I can't help it manage to handle).And I'll be darned if I can adjust the color/tint/brightness, etc, and find a true and life-like flesh tone.The sound system in the TV is okay but not great.  I mostly play sound through my home stereo anyway so that isn't as big a factor for me.Other features:NETFLIX -- Very happy with the ease and use of the Netflix feature  (though I had to purchase a router to accomplish its use).YOUTUBE -- while it is nice to have this feature, be aware that you cannot enlarge the viewing area of the YouTube content to fullscreen.  You must watch it on a mini-screen about a fourth of the area of the TV's screen.  And your ability to navigate through the video itself as it plays is very limited.  It also allows you to scroll through your Favorites on your online YouTube account, but not necessarly all of them.  There seems to be a ceiling limit on how many of your Favorites it will scroll through, something like 20 or 25.  If you have more than that many Favorites in your YouTube account, you will have to search for them from scratch.THE REMOTE -- I like the illumination feature, but it doesn't illuminate the bottom-most buttons (Play, FFW, REV, STOP, PAUSE) used for navigation.  And those buttons are so close to the bottom end of the remote it is awkward to both use them and hold the remote in the same hand.USB and SD card ports:  Wonderful to have them but the TV plays a very limited variety of video file types through these inputs.  If you have a digital video camcorder, you'll be fine.  If you have .avi or .mpg files you want to play through those inputs, you're out of luck.I waffled back and forth between buying this set and an LED LCD of similar size and price.  I can't help wondering if I would have been happier with the other purchase.  I found a Panasonic 37\" LED LCD that has an iPod dock and plays video from it.  The only way to play iPod video through the P42G25 is to buy a fairly expensive cable and play it through the component inputs.All in all, this TV does a heck of a lot and has great picture and features, though a few little things here and there prevent it from being a COMPLETE slam dunk.Still, I would recommend it in a heartbeat.", "Date": "January 20, 2011"}, {"Title": "When it breaks, don't expect help from Panasonic.", "Author": "Christine78620", "ReviewID": "RVWP24VWI2YHC", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "This Panasonic plasma TV had a beautiful picture, and I really loved the product, that is, until it broke. That's when you find out what kind of company Panasonic really is. The short answer: it's a crappy company that doesn't care about its customers and doesn't stand behind its products. Sure, Panasonic gives you a one-year warranty, but what good is a warranty if the company won't / can't actually fix your TV and you'll be without it indefinitely?My TCP42G25 (purchased from Amazon) broke after only a few months of light use.

When you call the customer service number for Panasonic plasma TVs, you wait interminably on hold. And it's even more disappointing when you speak to a real person because their CSRs are poorly trained and pretty much useless. About the only thing they know how to do is stall and evade. They basically put you back on hold some more, tell you something about their system being down or slow or whatever, and put you back on hold once more. If you manage to stick out this long delay (they're surprised to find you still holding, because most people must give up), they offer to call you back with the answer. Don't hold your breath -- they won't be calling you back.Panasonic says the needed part is back-ordered, and they have no estimate for when that part will be available again. (Think about that...how could such a large company have such a poor command of its parts supplies?! They have no idea when they part will arrive? There's not a single part available in the U.S.?

It is now at a service/repair shop waiting for a part that is on backorder because so many of these tvs have this same problem.Do not buy this or at least do your research before you buy this...you will see that there are two issues with this tv:  one is a 'seven blink' problem and the other is a 'ten blink' problem. I will never buy anything made by panasonic again....we have the seven blink problem and until it becomes a class action lawsuit panasonic will only pay to replace the part, so that means we are paying about $200 out of pocket for labor.  That, to me, shows that they are owning up to the fact that this issue is with their manufacturing and they should be paying for the labor too.Panasonic is paying for both parts and labor to repair of the ten blink problem on all tvs because it is in a class action lawsuit, but how long do you have to wait to get your tv fixed????

It looks good, was relatively easy to set up and does what it is designed to do with a minumum of fuss.I chose the 42\" Plasma set over an LCD, mainly due to the fact that with Plasma, it makes little difference where a viewer sits; they \"see\" everything on the screen as would a viewer directly in front of the screen; whereas, with an LCD set, any viewer off to the side, is cheated out of the same quality picture.Yes, it is a good TV; however.....If the designers went to the trouble they went to in order have this TV \"internet ready\", I would think they would have made it TRULY internet ready and not just possess the ability to be hooked up to the internet so you could access ONLY what they (Panasonic) wanted you to access and nothing else.I did subsequently sign up for Netflix....and it worked just fine.....but if I wanted to watch Hulu, (just for example), I couldn't.  That is, unless I had the internet signal first come through a computer and THEN to the TV.  Really now?.....just how much additional effort could it have been to have included that ability with the TV?Other than that, my only complaint (not directly related to the TV itself), is the simple fact that in spite of all the hype about HDTV, there are very few stations out there actually broadcasting in HDTV.And one more thing...I noticed that using an aspect ratio OTHER than 4:3 causes the (non HDTV) images to be quite distorted, I am left watching a picture in all reality, no better and no bigger than the 32\" tube set this one replaced.I still don't understand why those engineers couldn't have thought to have an aspect ratio that would be an exact multiple of the (old) 4:3....such as 16:12 instead of their brilliant idea of using 16:9, where it would be a more 'reasonable' fit to the TV screen....filling the screen from end to end and leaving only a small portion top and bottom.Yes, the \"zoom\" function does fill the entire screen, but in doing so, chops off a lot in the process.Bottom line is the TV does a good job when viewing an HDTV signal and when viewing a DVD......but other than that, I feel it was probably a waste of money in purchasing it at this time.  There is an awful lot of hype out there, which cannot really be fulfilled at this point in time.All in all, if I had it all to do over again, I would have purchased a NON-internet ready set.  What I SHOULD have done is simply kept the 32\" tube set and waited until the broadcasters caught up with the Television HDTV technology.", "Date": "February 28, 2011"}, {"Title": "Great TV, but Amazon shipping is HORRIBLE", "Author": "Pete", "ReviewID": "R24CQCYI7T31F3", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I ordered my TV on July 5th and after 2 weeks I called the shipper to find out when they would be delivering it.

I did not want to wait any longer so I had to go and pick it up (a 6 hour round trip).  Now, I do live in a semi-remote area but I have freight delivered to my business nearly everyday from nationwide freight companies but the carrier that Amazon used only delivers every other week.

Looks awesome and sounds better than I expected.What I didn't need however was to have to take a half day off of work.  At this point I would have saved money just buying it down the street.  Purchased the TV through Modia, amazon.  I called this morning to confirm the delivery window and was assured that everything was in order.  Took an extended lunch only to have the delivery driver call and tell me he wouldnt be there for another hour.  After that additional hour I recieved another call telling me he was still behind and would get there when he could but that it would be at least another hour.  If they would have let me know earlier I could've easily changed my day around.  But as they kept pushing it back I ended up having to call out for the rest of the day. I placed numerous calls to the shipper CEVA, but was just redirected and put on hold. The Seattle office was somewhat pleasant but noone in the philly office seemed to care at all.  Just left me waiting on the phone for a dispatcher who never answered. Ended up leaving a message for the Philly Manager who was out for the day.  (Maybe he was waiting for his TV also)My advice, get the TV, I think you'll love it. But spending the extra 50 to buy it locally might be a better choice for you.

As it relates to the delivery, Amazon was unable to find the TV after it shipped, and therefore ended up having to ship a new one.  Unfortunately, the \"pick you delivery date\" feature was no longer available, which was part of the reason I had ordered through Amazon in the first place.  That being said, the fact they had a new one shipped was a very nice gesture, and they even refunded me a small amount for the inconvenience.As to the TV, the plasma image is amazing - far exceeds other LED HDTV in my mind if you really care about color contrasts and depth.  But it seems Panasonic is falling behind on almost every other feature.  For example, TV speakers are just ok, so I would recommend using another sound output.  The fact that Wi-Fi is not built in it is a little annoying: the adaptor is small, but I wonder if it affects speed.  Maybe someone who tested both the Ethernet and Wi-Fi could comment.  It takes a few minutes for the TV to recognize the network when turned on (one gets a network failure message, so usually takes a couple tries).  The vieracast is still limited, although pandora, skype, netflix and you tube are all available now: but do not expect to have easy internet compatibility for a large spectrum of applications, unless you plug your computer directly in the TV.So overall, if TV quality matters most and you connect to the internet via another device, this is a good combo.  But still a bit disappointed by Panasonic, and they would need to catch up with the competition for me to buy this product again.OLD REVIEW:I cannot rate the product yet, as Amazon has failed to deliver the HDTV today.  We decided to go with the free scheduled delivery service provided by Amazon on HDTVs - we were scheduled to receive the TV today.  So we waited for four hours, which is the delivery window, for nothing.  We did not receive a phone call, an email or anything.  And when we tried calling Amazon, they said they did not know where the TV was and we would have to call back tomorrow.Four hours waisted, no TV.  No information.  Very disappointing on the part of Amazon - if we do not get prompt feedback tomorrow, I may have to return the TV all together (before even receiving it...)Do not go with this service - you will waste your time and not get your item.  Frankly, you may be better picking up the TV in a real store.  At least you will know where the TV is....Panasonic VIERA TC-P42G25 42-Inch 1080p Plasma HDTV", "Date": "September 20, 2010"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": null, "Features": null, "Name": null, "ImgURL": null, "ProductID": "B003924UBG"}}
