Does just what I wanted it to do, be a TV. It is neither smart or anything fancy.  Easy and quick set up. I got the color and sound how I like it very simply.  The picture is phenomenal for the price (I paid $699 on sale to Costco).I question if this is true 120Hz as extreme action and or up close event like burning fire, pixel blurring occurs. My 47\" Samsung exhibits none of this.Pluses - great picture with wide range. Sound is very good for a flat screen.  Great colors and contrast.Negatives - Stand does not swivel or turn.  No big deal as I am back mounting mine soon anyway. 2 HDMIs. Really? 3 would cost us so much more? Some blur. I can live with it as a better TV is near twice the money. No thanksOverall I am very satisfied and would buy one again!", "Date": "July 1, 2013"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "$899.99", "Features": "Enhanced picture quality\nPlug and play compatibility\nNumerous inputs and outputs\nUSB Connection For Photo Viewing\nTwo Year Limited Warranty", "Name": "TCL LE58FHDE3000X 58-Inch 1080p 120Hz LED HDTV (Black)", "ImgURL": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41a0E0orrfL._SX300_.jpg", "ProductID": "B00C2AQGPO"}}
