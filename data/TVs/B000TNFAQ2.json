We were upgrading our family room tv from a 35in 720p toshiba tv.  We were looking at the 52 inch mark, plasma vs lcd.  In a quick review make sure you consider what room you will be placing your new tv into.  You are about to spend big bucks make sure you are honest about where these tvs are going or you will be unhappy!First Plasma vs LCD (This comes from my reading again at higher end plasma vs lcd at the $3000-4000 range 52in-61in)PlasmaGood-Clearly plasma edges lcd in contrast.  If you are looking for the truest blacks plasma wins hands down-Long life 80000+ viewing hours-Some people complain of motion artifact in lcds.  The \"triple football\" effect.  Plasma does not seem to have this problem.-Clearly cheaper than lcd at the 46in+ mark, Significantly cheaper if looking at the 60+ inchBad-Heavy (don't think you are going to mount this baby on the wall yourself-Screen reflection (Must be in a room with low light to no light to really enjoy) Great for dedicated movie room ...family room with windows not so much.-Burn in for gamers---I think they are working on this but don't take a chanceLCDsGoodMaybe not the best for true black, but truly excellent.  You won't know unless you are a cnet reviewer.Light- you can move this with your significant otherNo chance of burn inNew 120hz refresh has made ghosting football effect no longer an issueNow have big computer screen if you want to hook up a pcNo reflection from screen.  Works well in rooms with lightBadIf you are looking at 60+inch tv's the price is crazy for lcd--- go get a plasma or direct viewNot the truest of blacks if you must have the truest of trueOk so that being said the sony xbr seemed like it fit the bill for me.  I needed ~52inch, has to go in family room, must work with xbox/playstation. I also watch lots of football so I had to take that into consideration.Armed with this I went out looking at tv's.  LCD overall fit what I was looking for and as I said unless you are making a dedicated movie room go with lcd.  As a note sony believes in lcd tech so much they stopped making plasma screens! Don't know if this is all that but sony usually knows their business.So going out looking at 52 inch lcds you will run into a few choices---Sony, Samsung, Toshiba, and Sharp.Quickly I will note that toshiba and sharp are on the lower end.  Less contrast, less hdmi inputs etc...however are usually less money! So be sure to look, but overall the samsung and sony tvs are far superior for a few hundred extra.  So if you are reading this you are clearly looking at the xbr sonys.  It really came down for me to Sony xbr4 vs the Samsung 71 series.  These are really close or even almost the same tvs.  The sony xbr4 has 3hdmi, 1:13000 contrast, and 120hz.  The samsung 71 also 3hdmi, 120hz, but 1-25000 contrast.  The contrast generally considered the amount of true black from the screen.  Overall I would say that gave the edge to the samsung and if you read reviews you will see people raving about the samsung vs the sony xbr.  However! and this is a big however! Samsung coats their lcd's with a coating that does have a moderate amount of reflection.  I have no idea why as this killed it for me.  And I am serious that you need to think about the lights in your room.  If you have any windows or lights if front of the tv that is what you will be seeing in a plasma or samsung.  It will drive you nuts! There is no NO reflection from the xbr4.  So ultimately I purchased the xbr4 from amazon. The picture is amazing from my hd tivo to bluray, hd dvd, and standard is well standard.  Although numbers say the samsung is better in the real world you will not notice the difference.  So I am happy to say this is a five star tv.Also of note:Sony offers the xbr5 version of this tv.  $400 for a piano gloss black rim.  Not worth it to me for plastic.Samsung also offers an 81 series, with 1:500000, and increased backlights.  They are about 1G more than the 71 series and xbrs and if you are looking at high end plasmas, I would take a look at these too. However, same reflective coat.Decide this isn't for you and want to go plasma... Well I looked at that too.  Stick to Panasonic and Pioneer and you can't go wrong.  Pioneer kuros hands down the best plasma to date!!!!Good luckPS-----I didn't have any problems with amazon white glove.  TV was purfect. I was called and two guys unpacked with no problem, even helped move the other tv.", "Date": "January 4, 2008"}, {"Title": "A Great Sony LCD-TV!", "Author": "Curtis Bard \"c.bard\"", "ReviewID": "R2VCOL6GASD2C", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I love Amazon for allowing these reviews, they could censor them to edit out info about other companies and competing sources, but they don't. These reviews have helped me immeasurably in choosing the right TV and other items, so I'm posting this so others can likewise be helped by my experience.We researched LCDs and Plasma TVs for one whole year, and we agree with most other reviewers who report that the new Samsung and Sony 46\" and 52\" LCD-TVs are the best. Up to this point Consumer Reports had placed the 50\" Panasonic at number 1, but that is last years models. I'm confident that when they rate all the new models this and other Sony and Samsungs will be at the top of the list.We visually compared all the latest models and every time we found the same thing: that the best HD picture was with the Sony (#1) and the Samsung (#2). The Sony had slightly better clarity and sharpness and color, and sound, and the Samsung had slightly brighter whites. We even created our own little weighted feature comparison chart, and when cost was considered, these two makes came out almost exactly the same.You can tell by the reviews that many more people purchase (the 46\" & 52\") Samsung instead of the Sony. That is because the Samsung costs so much less, and goes on sale at a higher discount. The Sony is the best of the two, but the Samsung is the best value because of the price. We even compared them with the 50\" Panasonic and the highly respected Kuro Pioneer 50\" sets, and the Sony and Samsung came out ahead.Conventional wisdom says that Plasma TVs have better market share, prices, blacks, contrast, and are generally speaking a little better than LCD TVs, but when comparing these two LCD brands (Samsung & Sony) with various Plasmas in regard to overall color, contrast, brightness, and clarity, our opinion is that the Plasmas have now met their match, and then some when all aspects of HD-TVs are considered.Some reviewers have said that the automatic volume control (IMHO, a much needed feature) does not work on the Samsungs or on the Sonys. I can't confirm that this is true in regard to the Sony, because we use the Sony with a surround sound (Onkyo) system which automatically disables the TV speakers and the Steady Sound feature which only works when the TV speakers are being used.last years TVs (even the Sonys) had relatively poor Standard Definition, but the newer 120 hz models with the faster refresh rate have excellent HD quality and VERY good SD quality. Some people like a glossy screen (like glossy photos) it seems to make the picture look deeper or better, but if you have a lot of light or windows in your TV room, then the Sony is for you. It has a coating that almost makes reflection a non-issue. And the Sony backlight automatically adjusts itself in bright / dark rooms.We bought Onkyo HT-SP908 7.1 Channel Home Theater System, speaker stands, a Playstation 3 to play Blu-ray HD DVDs, a couple of the recommended Monster 1000 HDMI cables, and a wall bracket to mount the TV on the wall later.So if you want the BEST PICTURE without regard to price- buy the SONY. If you want the BEST VALUE for your money - buy the SAMSUNG!", "Date": "January 4, 2008"}, {"Title": "Very, very good TV", "Author": "Demon3", "ReviewID": "R1E70CW0ZCVXII", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I previously owned a Samsung 46 inch LCD with 720p resolution and sold that to get something bigger and better. I mention that to set the context that I am used to HD TV and the picture quality.I was not expecting that the picture would be noticeably better than a TV from last year but I was wrong. Having looked at every 52 inch LCD and many 46 inch LCDs it was clear that this and the Samsung 120Hz TV are the best at the moment. I went for this Sony and I am thrilled at how great the picture is. On HD TV it is very satisfying. Running off an HD DVD player (yes 1080p), the picture is breathtaking. The Planet Earth HD DVDs are incredible (the BBC full version). If you are hesitating as I was then I can only say that if you take the plunge and buy this then there will be no regrets regarding picture quality. The Samsung is also superb. If you see no difference between the picture on this in the store and something cheaper then save your money.-update- after 3 months I am equally stunned by the picture, this is one of the best purchases I have ever made.

Henderson", "ReviewID": "R2GFCE40H2Z51", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "First off let me say that I have been researching HD TV's for the past 6 months. At first I was interested in DLP's because of the price. I soon realized that I wanted a TV that I could see at any angle. Ok so I started researching Plasmas!After deciding to purchase a Pioneer Elite Pro-FHD1 1080p 50\" Plasma I went to the store and compared it to a LCD. Not a LCD at all but THE LCD.... The Sony Bravia XBR KDL-52XBR4 52\" 1080p. They were side by side and although the Pioneer's picture was amazing, the Sony left me speechless. The picture was so vivid, bright and sharp. I didn't buy the TV that day but instead went to another store and compared the same TV to others. It was mounted on the wall along with 8 other Plasma's and LCD's (Samsung, Toshiba, and Pioneer). It was by far the best TV up there but was almost the most expensive. I gave it a lot of thought and decided this was the TV that I had to have. I bought it that day along with a Tilting wall mount and an Onyko 7.1 surround sound.When I got home, I took the TV out of the box and immediately plugged it up and was impressed. It was a few days before I had my Satellite installed. I currently have a DirecTV HD Receiver, PS3, Xbox 360 and an Onyko 7.1 Surround Sound all hooked up via HDMI. The picture is amazing in every aspect. I use the Sony Playstaion 3 for High Definition movies with Blu Ray which is great. You really can tell a difference! The movements are so fluid it almost looks fake if you aren't used to it. The games on the PS3 and Xbox 360 are great and of course with LCD there is no Image Retention (Burn In)!! So you can sit there for hours playing with no worries. The HD channels of course look great. The SD channels are above average. The key I've found to making the SD picture better is changing the video mode with your remote control from \"Full\" to \"Wide Full\" which basically cuts out the white boxes to the left and right of the SD picture and it fills up the entire screen. Regular DVD's also look very very good on this TV. Sometimes they look almost like they are Blu Ray in some scenes.The sound is extremely good as well. I use surround sound like I stated above but sometimes I listen to the speakers on the TV and they are great.Bottom Line: This TV is absolutely amazing and even better if it's mounted on the wall. I would highly recommend this TV if you have the money to spend on a quality product. You know you're getting a great TV when you buy Sony. My parents own a Sony TV that they bought over 10 years ago and it still works fine!

Johnson", "ReviewID": "R4U1W358YG9KO", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I decided on the 52\" XBR4 after comparing different sets including the Sony 52W3000, Samsung 5271 & 5281, Sharp 82 & 92 and Mitsubishi 244 'Diamond.' I finally pulled the trigger on the XBR4 based on a couple things: truest colors I could find, amazing picture quality, the least amount of artifacts or \"jutter\" I could find, cosmestics and the non-glare screen.The XBR4 has a 120Hz refresh rate, compared to most sets 60Hz refresh rate and not to be confused with Sharp's '120Hz frame rate conversion'which is not the same. A 120Hz refresh rate, basically, in a tiny, tiny nutshell is this-most sets refresh the image on the screen every 1/60 of a second. A set with 120Hz refresh rate obviously does that fast, twise as fast, interpolating a frame, along with the original one, in the time it takes a 60Hz set to display a single frame. Along with \"Motion Enhancer\" turned on, it creates a much smoother picture, depending on the signal-SD or HD. In my opinion, sometimes it's great, sometimes it's not so great. Either way it's a nice touch to have available.The XBR4 does a great job with SD, but a fantastic job with HD content. HD DVDs and Blu-Ray discs along with my XBOX 360 are jaw dropping. While I was in stores comparing I thought it was a close contest between the XBR4 and the Sammy 71 Series, but after I got it home, and compared it to my friends 71 Series, I feel confident that I got the best set on the market.All in all, if you are on the fence about this set, I'd say go for it, you won't be sorry. Most high-end sets are really close in comparison, the Sony XBR4/5s, Sammy 71/81s, Sharp 82/92s, etc. it all comes down to preference and opinion. Some people swear that the Samsungs look better, some thinks Sharps look better, Some Sonys. It's all preference and opinion. I was a little worried that maybe I had made the wrong decision when I first ordered it, but whe I got it, saw it in my home and compared it to other flat panels that friends have, I'm the leader of the pack among my friends and our LCD flat panels.", "Date": "December 8, 2007"}, {"Title": "Works great but do not forget to do the calibration", "Author": "Prabhakar Muthusamy \"Cool Guy\"", "ReviewID": "R1NPK5BWNO7A29", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "We have got this XBR 52 for super bowl at the nick of time.Though my team lost it,I am going to keep it anyway.We also spent lot of time figuring out which one to buy but finally my wife really liked this is TV for picture quality as well as the unique look with floating glass.I have ordered it thru Amazon and got it delivered  at third day to home.It does not hurt to live close by to Amazon warehouse.(25 miles from my place).The delivery was great and put the TV where I want them to put it.Also offered to take the package material out.After setting up the TV with our Time warner cable box, the Hi-Def channels worked great.Any channel that came in 1080i really worked like charm. But any other channel looked really horrible. In fact, my wife started asking me to return this TV as it was not all good.Based on my research on avsforum and hdguru reviews, I found that factory default settings sucks. The vivid setting really kills standard-def channels.There is a thread called 52XBR4 owners thread in avsforum which have calibration setting for my cable box with the tv.

We needed to replace our aging SONY 27\" tube that served us well for many years. After researching and trips to the \"Big Boxes\" we decided on the Sony KDL-32XBR1. My husband was able to remove the tambour doors on our living room entertainment center and it just barely fit. It arrived from Crutchfield with the \"white glove service\". We were amazed immediately at the picture quality and our friends described the picture as \"3D like\". That was the beginning.........That 32\" was primarily for me (I have my own DVR and tastes). My poor husband felt deprived having to watch programs on our old 36\" Sony tube located in our family room (we also have a DVR in this room). So, being an understanding wife, I agreed to let him order a Sony KDL-40XBR2 (this time from Amazon). Our friends also were impressed at the picture quality, however, thought it was not quite large enough for that room. I agreed and suggested to my husband that we put a corner direct vent fireplace in our bedroom and move the 40\" above it and get a 52\" for our family room. So, two weeks ago, we ordered, again from Amazon, and we are now enjoying our 3rd Sony LCD!We both agree that this KDL-52XBR4 is the best of all! The viewing area is much more applicable to the large 15' X 24' family room (for around $38,000 you can get a 70\" ha ha!). But this 52\" is great! This set also has \"motionflow\", a 120 HZ refresh rate that gets rid of the image \"smearing\" sometimes visible on fast action sports.We have never regretted spending the \"extra\" dollars on Sony. We are very, very pleased.NOTE: If you do order from Amazon, check back for price changes. Amazon will honor and refund the price difference for 30 days from date of purchase.", "Date": "November 21, 2007"}, {"Title": "Pixel problem", "Author": "Arun Gunda \"AKG\"", "ReviewID": "R1K0FBPXDR7AFB", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I got the 52XBR4 during thanksgiving last year.

Fortunately I got a replacementTV as it was within days of purchasing. Now within two months, my replacement TV has the same problem. Everyday the line grows by an inch or more and the vertical line covers 3/4th height of my screen. Now I am dealing with local Sony service center. The local center said several customers are facing the issue too on the same model and there is a backorder for the replacement LCD screens. I saw a similar problem posted by another customer on internet who bought it during Christmas last year.I do like the video quality and the reason I bought Sony is because my prior two TVs were Sony and never had a single issue in the last 10 years. The problems I am seeing seems to be systematic, but then there are several reviews here and none of them have seen pixel issues with their TV, that is why I wonder if it is only the Nov/Dec Sony shipments that have these problems.", "Date": "February 24, 2008"}, {"Title": "Look no further", "Author": "L. Thibodeau", "ReviewID": "R1FXFBZOSJ28AP", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Let me save you countless hours on the internet and hours at the stores looking at different sets.  I have been researching flat panel screens for over two years, perusing the internet sites such as CNET and several others to compare specs, user feedbacks, etc...  Went to specialty video/audio stores, big box stores (Best Buy and Circuit City) to compare the sets I was interested in.  After two years, it was between Sony XBR, Samsung F series LCD, Sharp Aquos LCD and for the plasmas, I looked at Panasonic 58\" 700U set (about $3.3k on sale) as well as Pioneer 5080HD (which is probably the best plasma out there and was selling for about $3.5k).  I settled on the LCD set so it came down to either the Panny or the Sony 52\" XBR4.  Decision was now based on technology - plasma vs LCD and LCD won out for the clarity of the picture and not having to worry about burn-in (even with the pixel shifts on the plasma, you still have burn-in to content with).  When you look at these two sets side by side, the clear choice is Sony for all the reason mentioned within these reviews.  Samsung was a close second but Sony just seemed a bit better.  Many manufacturers are focusing their R&D; dollars on LCD, bypassing plasma all together.  Sony is one of them and no longer sells plasma.  I bought the Sony 52\" XBR4 last week (Circuit City had a promo for $2,999 which is an incredible price for this top rated set), and got it delivered the day before the super bowl.Tip #1: don't be tempted to buy your LCD online saving yourself a couple hundred dollars. Buy it local so if something goes wrong, you won't have to jump through hoops to get it taken care of.Already had ordered the Sanus tilt mount (via Amazon.  Btw, buy it there and you'll save over $100).  Mounted the Sanus which is great and took me about 2 hrs - would have taken me 1 hr but my stud finder failed on me (saved over $400 from having the big box stores do it.  Trust me, you can do this mount yourself if you can find the studs.  Although it calls for installing it on two studs, I was able to expand the Sanus bracket to reach a 3rd stud).  Installing the brackets on the TV took 10 minutes, mounting it to the wall another 5 minutes.  You need two people to get this set out of the box and to lift it to your wall mount.  My wife was that second person and she's 5' 2\" and weighs 110lbs.  It was a struggle but we did it.Tip 2: make your cut-outs on the wall to run your cables before you mount the TV and also connect your HDMI or component video cables before you mount the TV to the wall.  Use a level to make sure the mount on the wall is set right.I'm running the top Monster HDMI 1000HD cable (again, only $89 on Amazon but $179 at the store) from the HDMI 1 input to the HD cable box (Time Warner).Tip 3: Time Warner does not support HDMI and tries to get you to use their component video cables.  Don't do this.  Stick with the HDMI 1000HD cable that supports 10.2 Gbps (ultra high speed) and supports 120 Hz.  What an incredible difference.  Circuit City actually demonstrates these two technologies (HDMI vs component video) so ck it out there.Tip 4: By all means, go with a reputable cable manufacture like Monster.  Pay the little extra to get the best technology out there. Don't settle for these \"other\" wannabes who sell an HDMI cable for $30.  You get what you pay for, plus Monster guarantees their technology for ever. Why would you hook up a inferior cable to a top notch TV.As for setting up the TV, all I did was set the input source to HDMI 1 and that's it.  Went to the Time Warner HD channels (say, Discovery or the History channel) and was blown away by the picture quality.  Even the standard channels were coming in at 720p.  I still have to play with the adjustments on the set to get the best out of this TV.  Here's where I need advice so if any of you gurus out there can direct me, please do so.  Watched the super bowl on the Fox HD channel (yes, go Giants) and was again very impressed with the quality and clarity of the picture.  Was actually receiving this channel at 720p, not 1080i.  Don't know if this is normal or which is best but do know the picture was incredible.Tip #5: when using the screen button on the remote, go with \"full\" as opposed to \"wide zoom\".  That way, you will still fill the screen without distorting the images.Will be buying a new receiver (perhaps a 7.1 set) and getting in-wall speakers (probably the JBL HTI 8, on sale for $149, regular price $599 at Amazon) and at some point, a blu-ray player (not sure on the brand yet, still researching) any recommendations on a receiver/speaker, blu-ray player, please post them so others can hear of your setup. Also bought the Monster HTS1600 power center (saved over $100 on Amazon).Tip#6: By all means, protect your investment.  Go with a power center as opposed to a simple surge protector.Overall, I am extremely satisfied with this purchase and thrilled by the quality of the product.Tip #7: As Nike would say, JUST DO IT, buy this Sony.  Sure, the price will still come down over the next year or so, but that's a year or so you won't experience HD.  You will not regret this purchase.  This TV is tops for all the reasons noted here and within all the other threads.One last tidbit.  Consumer Reports latest issue just rated this 52\" XBR4 #1.

The latest HDTV was the Samsung LNT5271F.  It had great picture quality, but it suddenly developed a small vertical line of dead pixels, then they grew into three vertical lines, then all three grew really long from top to bottom of the screen.  I was sad.  Luckily I purchased it from Amazon and they quickly arranged for pick up and a refund.  Anyways, I decided to spend a little more and get the Sony XBR4.  I can't believe Amazon was selling the 52XBR4 for the price I paid!  It arrived this morning (ahead of schedule!) and so far I'm loving it.  Hooked up my PS3 via HDMI and watched SD DVD.  SD looks pretty good with an upconverting DVD player.  I don't have HD cable because I mainly watch Blu-ray movies and play PS3 games.  SD TV is okay, but I think all HDTV produces the same SD quality.  Of course this is a HDTV and HD sources like the PS3 is impressive.  Colors are not over saturated and the 120ghz motion flow works great and looks more natural than the Samsung 71F.  At first I wasn't too sure about the look of the XBR4 (glass around bezel), but in person it looks pretty handsome.  The look of the XBR4 is not too flashy.  It's more simple and elegant with the floating glass.  The glowing 'Sony' logo is a nice touch, but glad there's an option to turn it off.  I expect this Sony tv to last for a long time, just like my old 32\" Sony Trinitron (which my parents still own) that was purchased back in 1991!  My in-laws have one of the early Sony Trinitrons (late 70's, early 80's I think) and works like a charm.  I'm confident with the quality of Sony televisions and look forward to many years of entertainment.  Don't get me wrong, the Samsung LNT5171F unit is a great tv, maybe I just got a lemon.

I won't dispute or repeat all the praises it has so earned.Compatibility problems.  This TV has a new version of HDCP on its digital (HDMI) inputs.  My cable box has a DVI output with an older version of HDCP.  The TV's manual says to connect DVI outputs using a DVI to HDMI adapter.  When I do that, I get a great picture for a minute or so, then a blank screen with a message from the TV: \"the connected device uses an incompatible version of HDCP. Use a component video connection instead.\"  Which is just plain crap.  Sony is major player in the cartel that is forcing HDMI and HDCP on us; they have a duty to make their new stuff backward compatible with prior versions of their mess. I had a similar problem with the output from one of my PCs.Service disaster.  After two months my TV started spraying groups of horizontal lines around the screen.  It gets worse over an hour or so, to the point where the entire screen is trashed.  The warranty provides for in-home service.  But Sony has this set up as a cutout operation - they just gave me the phone numbers of three independent repair shops and said to call them and make my own appointment.  They said that's all there were near me - three.  One was going out of town for two weeks.  The second would not do in-home repair, never mind the warranty - they send moving men types to fetch it back to their shop.  The third one took a week to come look at it.  Ten more days to get the board Sony told them would fix the problem and get it to my house and installed.  But this \"repair\" had no effect on the problem at all.  So they went back to the shop and have another talk with Sony.  Now another part is on order.  Today is June 3.  Estimated delivery of the repair part is July 31.Sony has this set up with a middleman to isolate themselves from pressure and accountability for performance of warranty repairs.  But it isn't going to work for them this time.  They'll be getting plenty of pressure.  Directly from me to their management.  And to my State Consumer Protection department.  And, since they are making new ones right now in Mexico with the parts that could be used to fix mine instead, I'll need to find one or more Federal agencies. If they are making new ones instead of fixing defective ones they already sold, well, they can just give me one those new ones.  Or they should be turned back at the border until Sony behaves in an honest manner.The part they need to replace now is the entire display panel.  And I've been told that they are in short supply because of a huge number of failures. So save yourself the hassle.

I see it mostly when booting up my Mac Mini which I use for a media server.Inputs:  This TV's remote requires several steps to change input source.By sorting through a complicated menu system, you can turn off sources you don't use, which speeds things up slightly, still I feel the remote deserves some dedicated buttons to allow you to change sources easily.All the many inputs means you can hook up anything to this TV.  3 HDMI's, more component and composite inputs, PC input.  All very nice to use and allows interesting combinations for various purposes.However you can't choose an HDMI input for the second for Picture in Picture input.  You cannot show two HDMI sources!  I was able to work around this using component inputs.  I don't use PIP much, but it would be nice if it worked better.  For example, say you want to edit some video on a Hard Disk Recorder.  It is nice to be able to see the input and the output to verify the recording/editing is progressing well.On the plus side the PIP can be resized to make two equal sized images or either can be scaled up as the other image sizes down.As computer screen it works great.  My Mac Mini with wireless keyboard and mouse, works great driving it.  The Mac allows me to resize text using keyboard shortcuts.  I read the news on this screen daily and changing the text size is critical to making this usable at different viewing distances.  It is easy to switch, with two clicks, between higher and lower screen resolutions.  A swivel chair in front of the TV makes this feel like a desktop computer when using the high resolution video format.  Lower resolutions work great from far across the room.This is my first time using a TV for a computer monitor and it works well.I didn't rate this TV with five stars because of the dark corners and the limitations with PIP.", "Date": "April 26, 2008"}, {"Title": "Awesome!", "Author": "Charles Dickens", "ReviewID": "R1BROTYVJVP59Y", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Five stars to Amazon, the delivery service and most importantly the TV.Amazon: cheapest price around AND if you buy from Amazon... for thirty days after your purchase, if you see they (Amazon, not other retailers) have lowered the price, you can request a refund of the difference.

I'm still figuring out how to use it, so this may be my fault not the TVs, but the first thing I did was to watch Transformers, and I noticed that during fast action scenes such as when the robots change into cars and vice versa it would all become a bit of a blur (no, I hadn't been drinking).

Now that we've had it for almost a month, I can say it has met or exceeded all of our expectations.Our Family room is 16' by 24' but the TV had to be set up on one of the long walls directly opposite a wall of windows. Because of the fireplace & the way the room is laid out, the furthest we sit away from the screen is about 14' and we were unsure whether to get the 46\" or the 52\".

However, it's perfect even when viewed from as close as 6-8' away & I'm really glad we went with the 52\".The unit itself is fantastic and with HD input, the picture is so clear it's like looking through a spotless window. Even watching non-HD DVD's is absolutely amazing because of the sharpness of the picture. The kid's games all function flawlessly and are likewise incredibly detailed. The non-glare screen is a big plus in our window filled family room. We replaced a 10 year old 37\" Sony Trinitron flatscreen that was very bothersome to watch during the day because of the reflections.I shopped price pretty hard to and yes, you can buy it cheaper from some camera store in NYC than Amazon BUT, be sure to read up on those unbelievably cheap online sites. They make up for the low price by 'selling' you parts (like the stand) that they swipe out of the box. Or you get a TV that was supposed to go overseas. Our Amazon experience was great. We had a delivery date a day after we ordered the TV and the freight company actually delivered several days earlier than promised.

Because of that, I was a little biased with regards to the Samsung.  I didn't get a chance to see the Sony LCD until a month later, and the picture quality was also just as incredible and breathtaking. It is unfortunate, but I did not get the chance to compare them side-by-side but I can tell you they are very, very close in terms of picture quality.In reviewing prices, the Sony XBR4 was always at least $400 more at any given time than the Samsung.  When deciding to spend a sizable amount of money on a TV, especially when the picture quality was so close, I felt that the extra cash was probably not worth it.  I began reading as many reviews as I could to help me in making my decision and found that the Samsung had a number of issues, some sporadic and some fairly common, ie: TBE (triple ball effect), dead pixels, ect. While the Samsung LN-T5271 has more reviews than Sony KDL-52XBR4, the Sony reviews have only 13% that are 4 stars or less. The Samsung has over 20% of the total reviews  coming in at 4 stars or less.  After reading about firmware updates, color calibration and possible fixes for the Samsung, I decided to go with the Sony.  I can tell you the peace of mind I have in knowing that I have a quality product rated at the top of the list regarding picture quality and consumer satisfaction is more than worth the few extra hundred dollars I paid.

This new 52\" XBR is SO much better...The advancements in technology are apparent.  You can watch this set from any comfortable angle.  Blacks are SO good!  This has been a sort of problem with earlier LCD televisions.  A non reflective screen as well and I think that all plasmas are highly reflective.  You see this LCD set and you definitely see the future of all flat-panels.  Colors are actually breathtaking.  You will certainly have your time of constantly saying \"This is just amazing.\"  I assure you that if you have High Def content fed into this set, you'll be absolutely amazed. Especially Blu Ray!!!Please remember the calibrations.  Setting them correctly makes a BIG difference.  Not that out of the box, it doesn't look fantastic, but with the fine tuning of the setting can make a big personal difference.  Check out the blogs on the internet to find out what others are doing with this television.It is truly a masterpiece.  It looks so good, even when it's off.This is the stuff of fantasy.  If you're reading this then you are wondering whether the upgrade to XBR is worth the extra money.  All I can tell you is that since I didn't also buy a 52\" standard version of this set, I have no idea of knowing whether it is or not.  Also, all I can say is that this television is truly amazing!  Hook up to a Blu Ray DVD player and I'm in video heaven.  The picture is LETTER perfect, even if you watch it from five inches away.  Why would you do this?  But the image is THAT good.  Photographic.  Astonishing!  Blu Ray is certainly the winning high def format (I have both) and the prices of Blu Ray players are now somewhat reasonable.  You can really do all of your shopping on Amazon.  Receivers.  Speakers too.Plenty of HDMI hookups and not that you need it, but setup is extremely easy.The best LCD flat-screen on the market?  Perhaps.  All I can say is that you definitely won't be disappointed.The delivery arrived way ahead of schedule and the white glove delivery not only took the set out of the box, but also moved it into position and checked it out, even checking for any missing pixels.

Amazon stands behind this television and since there is also no sales tax....I still love my original 46\" Bravia television, which is in a bedroom but the new 52\" is in the television room and it is really giant!  I'm looking forward to connecting it to a HDMI Sony receiver and setting up the 5.1 surround like I have already done in the bedroom.  But the sound from the television is pretty good and has fair bass, but you'll want this baby hooked up to the proper receiver.All in all, it's a masterpiece to just behold.

Now that HD is more readily broadcast and sold on disc, I took the plunge.  I can be a real tightwad, so I researched LCD, Plasma, DLP and LCOS for months before buying in.While I am convinced you can't beat the picture and brightness of an LCOS, I can't imagine spending two hundred dollars on lightbulbs every year.  I know because one of my friends does this with his LCOS.  I call it a defect but apparently, it is expected behavior for LCOS owners.  I am not an LCOS owner.I wrote off DLP for two primary reasons.  First, no one I know that owns one is terribly happy with it.  Second, the color wheel playing congnative dissonance with my visual cortex just seems wrong.  Some reports say this can actually result in a perceived picture problem.  On a lesser note, both DLP and LCOS suffer from the same footprint size problem as my gigantic 1990's Hitachi projection.Plasma versus LCD.  This is where my decision got difficult. After weeks of thinking I was going to buy a Plasma because of slightly bigger screen size, cheaper price, less artifacts and seemingly better contrast, I bought an LCD.  Well, not just any LCD.  I stood for hours in front of 30 different Plasma and LCD's and the XBR out shined them all.  Unlike other LCD's, the XBR was bright, didn't shimmer like other LCD's, had low glare, was crisp, had good dark blacks and met my minimum 52\" requirement.  Unlike plasmas, the XBR4 didn't have any screen door to look through.

Anyway, so I had a choice to make between XBR4 and KDL-52W3000.  I watch a lot of sports and a lot of movies but was having trouble pulling the trigger on the 120hz set(XBR4) because I didn't know if the extra $$$(around $800) would really be noticeable.

And cosmetically, this TV is very classy with the glass border giving it a really nice look.The SONY logo is illuminated and is appealing to see it light up when you turn on the TV.  However, I find it distracting when watching a Blu-Ray or HD-DVD.  You can easily turn this off (from within the general menu).No negatives.  If you're considering a 52\" LCD,this is the king of the crop of true 1080p sets.  They've been priced at around $2,999 during the last few weeks although a local upscale L.A. chain (Ken Crane's) from where I wanted to buy it, was selling the same set for a considerably higher price of $3,499.I then decided to do some price comparisons to see if I could get a better price.  I found it online at Amazon for $2,999 (though most retailers will not price match Internet e-tailers.) While I would save on the sales tax, I would be charged for shipping.  Buying it locally it would be just the reverse.  Other stores, like Best Buy were also higher in price, but coincidentally, while going through all the Sunday newspaper advertisements, I found the XBR-4 advertised by another chain (specializing more in appliances) in their Sunday L.A. Times ad.  This chain has no locations near me and I don't think I would have shopped there anyway.  But Ken Crane's does \"price match\" with local brick and mortar stores, so I got the TV for $500 less than they were selling them at.I shop a lot at Amazon for CD's, DVD's, books and also some small appliances and electronics and have never had any problems.  I'm just a little hesitant to buy such a large item online.  Out of the box, my Sony was perfect.  But if there were any minor flaws, I know the dealer would have taken it back immediately and replaced it the same day.  So for the extra peace of mind, I did not purchase this online.  But if this is not an issue with you, then get your TV from the fine folks at Amazon.", "Date": "March 9, 2008"}, {"Title": "its the best that there is!!!", "Author": "yeehawbob", "ReviewID": "R39DBUJU4784F2", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "After a long time waiting to jump on the bandwagon of big screen TV's and that too a True HD, flat panel, LCD TV I am very glad that I chose the SONY Bravia XBR4 52\".I went to 3-4 different stores to compare the picture and other qualities, and the only other TV that comes close to SONY XBR is Panasonic's top of the line Plasma TV.The picture quality, color depth and even the basic look of SONY XBR is far better than any other TV out there.", "Date": "March 1, 2008"}, {"Title": "Great TV and Price, Poor Delivery", "Author": "S.

It is in our family room.  I always fear burn-in, so I do minimal gaming on that TV.  Since it is an older plasma, it has far inferior black levels compared to my new purchase.  The new XBR4 LCD panel is located in our living room and replaces and old 27-inch Sony Trinitron TV.  I have been researching new HD models over the past year.  I would oscillate between Sony, Sharp and Samsung.  I read so many reviews and opinions it made my head spin.  I also made many trips to different stores to view these models.  Frankly, the Sony XBR4 had the fewest complaints from anyone and much praise.I do not regret this purchase.  This TV has black levels that I didn't think were possible for an LCD panel.  It also does an excellent job in scaling and smoothing standard definition digital channels on Comcast cable.  Analog channels don't fair quite so well, but they don't on any TV this size.Contrary to other people's opinions, I find Sony's cross bar media menu system to be very easy to use (then again I do have a PSP and PS3 too and am a gadget lover).  By the way, this menu system is a tweeker's dream.  I didn't even need to read the manual.I don't have the Sony PS3 system connected to this TV yet, but I do have my wife's Nintendo Wii system connected.  Even though the Wii is relatively low resolution, this TV makes the game graphics look spectacular.  My wife can't get over how large this TV is.I was initially worried about buying something this size over the Internet, but it arrived swiftly (less than 5 days) and was very easy to unpack and placed on our new black-lacquer 61-inch TV stand/cabinet.In short, if you want an unbelievable HD picture, really good SD picture handling (especially on digital channels), a great display for gaming and watching highdef movies (Blu Ray or HD) then you have to buy this TV.", "Date": "January 27, 2008"}, {"Title": "The best LCD out there right now.

Samsung is consistently cheaper and for some offer better value. But Sony's image/color processing seems superior even after my attempts to equalize the settings in the stores.Sony (+): Better dark details (Samsung's dark contrast is pretty bad despite maxing out brightness), no glare on screen surface = key for daytime sports, better/accurate color reproduction (natural and soothing to look at for hours, but capable of vivid colors/contrast with adjustment), much better speakers, better 120hz technology.Samsung (+): cheaper, swivel stand, the boasted high contrast ratio sounds good but black detail is lost and a shiney screen is needed. Samsung's color processing tends to exaggerate colors/contrast, which some might prefer.LCD vs plasma: I have to admit we didn't consider the Pioneer's due to $$$$. The other plasmas including the Panasonic actually looked worse and I could not perceive a noticeable black level surperiority. I guess despite plasmas having the best black level, it's still not truly black. Unless the sales people sabotaged all the plasma's settings to push LCD's, the newest top tier LCD's look better next to these plasmas. So, we went with the LCD because the Sony fared well in these areas of perceived LCD weaknesses:-Black level: Black level is pretty darn good even in a dark room, will not distract in dark scenes. The great contrast helps your eyes overcome that. For example, does the black text on white background that you read on a LCD monitor appear gray? No, because your eye/brain is most concerned with the contrast.-Motion blur: there is still some, but the 120Hz motionflow eliminates that and works pretty well for most sources. Set on HIGH some scenes does look somewhat artificial. The unexpected effect of 120Hz is that images look very \"life-like\" or \"3D\", I think because the images are refreshed at 120 instead of 60 (although some claim this panel is always 120Hz regardless of Motionflow setting).-Power/burn-in: Currently, LCD's still consume less power, not prone to burn-in's. New plasmas less prone but would you experiment?So, this is why we went with the Sony and so far no regrets despite the  the dent in the wallet.", "Date": "January 21, 2008"}, {"Title": "Great Performer - I LOVE this TV", "Author": "Michael Davis", "ReviewID": "R15TMJT58OCZOD", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I shopped around for over a year before I made my decision to buy the Sony. It was always more expensive than the other televisions in the 52 inch size range, but to my eye it always looked the best. I have had this set since March 2008, simply becuase I wanted to give ample time before leaving any sort of review.In short, this television is hands down the best I could have bought for the money spent. Since there are a myriad of options to tweak the picture, I found some extremely helpful calibration tips at [...] that make the blacks very deep, and the colors vibrant. I currently use this television with my PS3 connected via HDMI, my TWCable HD DVR STB connected via component and optical cable, and my XBOX 360 connected via component and optical cables. The SD programming from the cable box looks ok, but it really shines with the HD content, especially Discovery HD, which broadcasts exclusively in 1080p. Blu-Ray, of course, looks amazing, although I must say that I opt to leave the 120hz Motion Flow option off when watching movies as it detracts from the graininess that, IMHO, gives film its soul. On the other hand, it works wonders for nature programs (EHEM, Planet Earth). Given the amount of reviews already here, I'm not going to go into detail as to why I love this television so much and just say that I agree with all the kudos that this set has garnered from all the other owners.The only real issue I had with this set was with dead pixels early on. About five weeks after purchase (Fry's Electronics, in-store pick up), I noticed a little cluster of dead pixels in the lower left corner of the panel. This was nothing serious as it wasn't in the direct viewing area of the screen, but I was still perturbed simply because I spent so much on the set. After a call to Sony customer service they directed me to 3 different Sony certified repair shops, one of which I called and explained my situation. They sent a repair man out to look at it that week and he verified that it was a bad panel. He called Sony from my living room, verified the problem, and had a new panel ordered within ten minutes. Unfortunately the 52 inch panels were on back order (because apparently dead pixels are a common issue from the Sharp plant because of faulty adhesive between the panel cover and the liquid crystal)so it took almost a month for my panel to come in. Once it arrived the repair shop called and scheduled a day to come and replace my tv. The gentlemen were extremely professional and the work only took about 40 minutes. This was almost three weeks ago, and my television looks absolutely gorgeous. I admit that I was bugged with this whole situation, but given the way it was taken care of I can let it go.All in all, I know three other people who own this very same tv, and we are all in agreeance that it blows all other LCD televisions of this size out of the water. In fact, I loved this TV so much that I bought the KDL-32XBR6 for the bedroom. Great product from a company who knows quality. I am extremely happy with my purchase and would, even given the issue with pixels, recommend this set to anyone looking to upgrade from a CRT or simply go to a bigger LCD.Oh, and on a side note. This set looks much better when mounted on a wall. I kept mine on the included base for a few months, but then decided to hang it since a) my little 19 month old kept touching the panel, and b) it's a little wobbly when the securing strap (provided) isn't used. I found a great deal on a wall-mounting kit at monoprice dot com (where I also bought all my HDMI cables) and it works great. Just FYI.** UPDATE ** October 4, 2008 **Since writing this review, I have had no other issues with my television. My most recent upgrade was a new AV unit (Pioneer Elite VSX-92TXH) so that I could take full advantage of the HD soundtracks available on BD. I now have all my aforementioned components connected to my AVR via HDMI with a single HDMI cable running to my tv. Everything works flawlessly and looks better than I could have ever imagined.Another big change I've made is the 120hz motion flow. Originally, I didn't run this feature while watching television/live action movies because the faster refresh rate made the video look too much like it was shot with a home video camera. But after having this tv for a while and viewing more and more BD content (thank you netflix) I have grown quite accustomed to watching everything with the 120hz feature on and think it looks great. I still think this feature works best for nature shows and animated movies. For example, I just watched the BD version of Nightmare Before Christmas last night with some friends. Not only was the 7.1 Dolby True HD soundtrack (thank you Danny Elfman) superb, but the level of detail in the movie amazed everyone who was watching. Almost like watching it for the first time.I've also provided a couple pictures of my current set-up.** UPDATE ** April 8, 2009 ** I have now had this television over a year, and it is still the best TV I have ever owned. I have not had any problems with dead pixels, artifacts, ghosting, or bleeding blacks as some others said they have experienced. My television gets daily use, whether it's TV programming, movies, video games, or surfing the web, and it is going strong.

I was skeptical at first to really see a big difference for all the new technology advances on this TV like 120 Hz processing, 10 bit video, 24P true cinema, XBR pro chip with advanced architecture and all.My previous Sharp was good but not exceptional as I would have expected. But the moment we switched on this TV with my DirecTV HD receiver, the picture came alive and it was breath taking. We didn't realize the channel we were on before we unplugged the Sharp, it was food network and the show at that time was a chef cooking on a big lawn outdoor with some sports cars on the background standing side by side. Wow! the colors were superb and I can't believe I am seeing the total day and night differences between my new Sony and my previous Sharp. Even my non-techie wife completely agreed and for once praised me for spending the extra dough.The $1000 price difference is worth it. The picture was as smooth as it can get, with no visual blemishes or grains. For the first time I could see the real makeup on each person's face and can't believe even men put on this much make up. Like for example I could see Chris Berman on ESPN Sunday countdown had too much makeup that it looked unreal.The sweat on the NFL players were crystal clear and I have to say with advances of HD TV, the news cast people have to be extra careful with their makeup's now. Even a slightest spot on their face is clearly seen.I have set my Sony to output 720P all the time instead of showing the native resolutions from each channel. So if I am watching an SD channel, it up converts the signal to near 720P without too much distortion and I really like the picture compare to my other 27'' Tube TV. With HD channel, 1080i are down converted into 720 but with the progressive scan it looks much better.I didn't play with all the menu items and the default factory settings are more than adequate for normal viewing. I may play with some features with the help of Cnet website.Pros: Classy look,  beautiful black screen with floating glass, matte finish speakers, not too glossy like some Samsungs, Superb picture quality, adequate video/audio ports, PC connectionCons: Speakers are not loud enough (may be my living room is too big), expensive (but worth every penny)I bought this TV after nearly 8 months of research.

After having to move out of the house for a major renovation, we swore we would not move the old TV back in, which, with stand, weighed 200 lbs and took three guys to move it.  The new Sony arrived, and two guys moved it into place quickly and efficiently, and it powered up perfectly.  So simple, easy and effortless (for me!).Although it does come with a stand, we had our installer hang it on the wall, into which was placed a conduit for the TV's cords to connect to the receiver.  (Note: if you are doing home renovation, be sure to put a power outlet on the wall near where you're going to hang it, otherwise, you'll have a power cord dangling down.  Doh!)The TV has a nice set of speakers, and quite a few inputs (including 3 HDMI inputs, I think).  However, if you're setting it up in a home theater, all these inputs and speakers go to waste, as you'll only be using one HDMI input into which you'll plug the output of your receiver.  Essentially the TV turns into an LCD monitor.  But if you are intending to use it as a standalone TV, the speakers are excellent, as is the remote, and it has enough inputs to handle all your equipment.Setting up the TV is a breeze, with the onscreen setup and the remote.  As I said earlier, the remote control is really nicely laid out and easy to use.  But if you are setting up a home theater, you'll probably get a universal remote so it won't matter.The look of the TV was very important to me -- when it hangs on the wall, it becomes a piece of furniture.  The look is very clean and unobtrusive.  The outer bezel is clear and you can buy additional colored bezels if you want to jazz it up.  It fits very nicely in my minimalist modern home.The picture quality is superb.  I don't yet have any HD input sources to connect to it (but expect to soon), but my receiver is an upconverting receiver so it converts lower-resolution signals to higher resolution to give you a great quality picture.The only thing that I wished I really knew was how much of the TV's functionality would be taken over by the other piece of equipment.

The TV's only weakness, from my point of view, is that there aren't enough HDMI ports (2 on back, 1 on side) and there is no input for DVI, just RGB (which I'm told is analog). I highly recommend this TV. You'll wow people and have lots of hours of great entertainment too. Make sure you get a strong mount if you plan to hang this on your wall as it weighs nearly 100 lbs.

My family room is completely open on one end with windows from the kitchen letting natural daylight into the room. The Sony 52\" XBR4 is much better than any other TV for rooms with windows as it has a matte screen that does not create a lot of annoying reflections. This is a major consideration with a large screen TV. I found that Plasma TV's are particularly prone to this problem and perform better in a room without any windows.My other major consideration is how good the picture looks when viewing HDTV broadcasts. I do not watch many DVD's so that was a lower priority for me. The SONY XBR4 is fantastic when viewing HD programs. You need to spend plenty of time adjusting the picture under daytime conditions and night conditions to get the best performance. This set allows you to tweak the picture with more than a dozen adjustments and you can save your settings. I have separate settings for daytime, nighttime and sports.I am very happy with this unit and when I visit friends I always try and check out their big screen TV picture. To date I have not found another TV that can match the picture on the Sony KDL-52XBR4. This TV was a major investment and it is pricey ($3,000) but I am glad I waited.One final piece of advice: do not judge TV's by the way they look in a retail store or warehouse club. Retailers often use video processors and Blu-ray DVD's to showcase an incredible picture and you want to view the TV hooked directly to cable or satellite, to duplicate the same conditions in your home.", "Date": "March 30, 2008"}, {"Title": "XBR KDL-52XBR4 52\" LCD HDTV What a great televisioion-you won't be disappointed!", "Author": "IrishS01", "ReviewID": "R10QYC379B9IJ0", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Sony Bravia XBR KDL-52XBR4 52-Inch 1080p LCD HDTVThis tv is better than advertised!

Sony - guess who won?", "Author": "Sathia", "ReviewID": "R1LZK4TZ2RUOLE", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Arriving at the decision to buy the 52XBR4:===========================================I have a Olevia 37\" LCD (537H) which was moved from the bedroom into the family room after I sold off the 46\" Sony RPTV. I had been eyeing the latest 1080P, 120Hz TVs for a while now, and had narrowed down my choice to1. Toshiba2. Samsung3. SonyI went with Toshiba due to the value for the money (or so I thought) - they seemed to match the other sets feature by feature except were $500 or so less. I went ahead and bought the set (from local retailer - video only; sorry Amazon, not about to buy a fragile 52\" TV online! - which turned out to be a good decision, read on). I got the Toshiba XF550 which is their top-end 52\" model. Was happy with it until I realized my Oppo player via HDMI looked way too green especially in the shadow areas. After trying to \"fix\" it, I returned the set failing to do so (didnt try the service menu tricks, for fear of voiding warranty, return issues, etc.). The off-axis viewing was also not very good on this one. It was a real bummer because I really liked its thin bezel, and styling. Plus, i had to haul it back to the shop to exchange it...So I was back on the market... in the meanwhile, more research about Samsung showed 2 things - 1) TBE (Triple Ball Effect) in their 120Hz models; 2) 8bit vs. 10 bit confusion because Samsung doesnt provide specs for their panels *anywhere*. Also the model I looked at (A650) was not attractive (subjective) due to its reddish bezel, glare-ish screen (I have a large window facing the TV), etc.So I looked at Sony - it had been my 3rd choice mostly due to their price point for their higher end / 50+\" models. Finally decided XBR is what I want - here are the pluses:1. 120Hz (best implementation in the market)2. very good blacks (although I think not as good as Samsungs - the glare screen ones)3. excellent off-axis viewing (black level drop very slightly on extreme horiz-off-axis viewing)4. styling (it looks much bigger than the Toshiba; but I really like the glass surround, very elegant)5. 10bit panel6. High WAF (Wife Acceptance Factor)Review of the set itself===========================================I love the set so far. Mine was a March 2008 build. It looks unbelievable when matching up with my Oppo 981 DVD player upconverting to 1080P. I did have to tune it to get good blacks (e.g. Power Saving must be a High, and backlight at min/1). Video-only gave me a price lower than Amazon (sorry guys) and I also got the 2 yr warranty extension (total 3 years).High Def:---------Comcast HD channels look pretty good - the TV does show the artifacts that are present in the signal itself. Black levels are pretty good.The best HD source I got is via XBOX 360 (just trailers); now, they look good - I mean jaw-dropping good; I can only imagine how bluray movies will look. I am currently looking for a bluray player maybe later when prices drop and load times get better.Standard Def------------Standard def looks ok on this set; honestly between DVD, my xbox and Comcast's HD channels I barely watch any SD anymore.The \"wow\" factor is very high on this TV as well, if that matters to you - folks went gaga in my recent party drooling all over the set.", "Date": "May 1, 2008"}, {"Title": "Amazing product, service, delivery and price!!!", "Author": "Michael L.

Too bad, my Credit card had already been charged 3K.I find it astounding - and perhaps a little disturbing - that Amazon wouldnt display that their terms and conditions dont hold for resellers on the web page.Very disappointed. I spend a lot of money on Amazon and this is a first - on my biggest purchase.I am posting this here so future buyers can beware - they are not getting this in your house or setting it up- unless shipped directly from Amazon - and none of the top of the line SONY XBRs are.", "Date": "April 28, 2008"}, {"Title": "TOO  MUCH HOLD ON", "Author": "Elvis M.

I have always been on top of the high definition hysteria and for once there is finally a product that truely shows noticeable difference in picture quality.  To me samsung has been the absolute best a far as 1080p set with high color contrast. Now sony has made the absolute best 120 hertz 1080p set but it has a lot of blurr in the picture. I am using real hdmi 1.3 compliant cables, the sony str dg 2100 receiver and yet I cannot get a consistent good picture.  When movement of video becomes too fast it blurrs or looks as if image has a ghost.  Games are not good on here either.  Colors are either of dull (especially on game mode) or glitchy as if the tv is speeding up the image. Dont get me wrong it is an amazing picture when not blurring but from what I hear these problems are common for right now as it is somewhat a new technology.  Also the colors are not as vibrant as most 1080p set that now are 20000:1 color with 16 bit processors.  I wish I had holded on because I have as of april I have seen new sets from both sony and samsung that have dramatically corrected this problem.", "Date": "April 4, 2008"}, {"Title": "my 52xbr4 delivery", "Author": "R Duret", "ReviewID": "R2R2XQ3HFRV1XM", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I ordered this tv on the 13 of april,item in stock sold by amazon [allegedly],the tv left from cincinnati OH on the 16,took 1 day to get to colombus OH,according to the tracking,I'm supposed to get my tv on the 25,I live in wisconsin,about 350 miles from ohio,that's about 45 miles a day.so I do not know what is really going on,amazon doesn't even have that model in stock any more,I have been dealing w/amazon for about 7 years now without a glitch,I do not understand  nor got any clues on what's up.I just hope that is not going to be one of the nightmare delivery stories,also hope the tv will be up to par.I will post a review about the tv as soon as I get it installed & working.
