HDTV broadcasts and Blu-ray video are just amazing, not to mention the very excellent 3D seen from Direct TV broadcasts.  And by the way .. There are no grayish backgrounds where one would expect black.  On this TV, blacks are BLACK.  Also, on mine, there isn't any, \"buzz\" (someone here reported hearing a buzz) or any sound other than program content regardless of how close I get to the TV.  If there was, I would call Panasonic's repair service.One thing I learned early on is, don't mess with the color adjustments on this TV right off the bat; wait a few days for the TV to stabilize then adjust if you feel the need.  The color realism on this TV is extraordinary.  Being typically an early adapter, I've owned a few other plasma TVs.  My gripe with my earlier Panasonics is .. I could never get the reds quite right (leaned toward crimson), and there always seemed to be just the slightest greenish hew.  Yes .. I'm picky .. kind of a perfectionist I guess.The reason for my having owned several TVs over the recent past is because those before never seemed quite right.  This one though is a keeper.  If there's any gripe at all it's with watching non-HDTV broadcasts.  They look great, but I think they looked even better on the TV I replaced this one with.  But broadcasters are all switching over to HD so that little complaint will never cause me to continue in my early adapter ways.  This one, I'm sure, will stay in my house until one of us passes away (I'm a few years into retirement).And by the way, I will edit this review if any negatives become apparent on this TV over time.", "Date": "July 8, 2010"}, {"Title": "Stunning HDTV!", "Author": "Rijeka Solar", "ReviewID": "R3BVTETVEGEQX7", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Having previously owned a 4 year-old Panasonic Plasma that was only 720p, this TV is truly a treat - the black levels are outstanding, THX mode for color settings provides great out-of-the-box viewing experience.As to the buzzing that others have alluded to.  Plasma TVs buzz, more than LCDs, it is a known fact.  Panasonic refers to their \"10 foot rule\" meaning that you shouldn't be able to hear the buzzing at a distance of 10 feet.  Mine had a horrendous buzzing which varied in intensity based on the scene - Panasonic service had a repairman out to me in no time, and it turned out to be a bad ferrite core - something ironically meant to suppress buzzing.That issue having been promptly fixed, the picture quality is amazing, especially with a 1080p feed (pop in a BluRay DVD like Planet Earth or Life and just drool as you watch it on this TV).  I have to admit I haven't tried the 3D aspects yet apart from unpacking the glasses and trying them on.  They seem rather flimsy and oddly constructed (two weird interchangeable nose pieces, neither of which seem too comfortable).  However, I don't care if I never use them, but admittedly I bought the TV for its other features, such as size, resolution, black levels, picture quality, etc, and it doesn't disappoint!", "Date": "August 3, 2010"}, {"Title": "Great TV, 2D & 3D pictures both crisp with great color", "Author": "K. Salinger \"FNP, RN\"", "ReviewID": "RAMSA7J0O0ABL", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "We recently purchased the 58\" Panasonic 3D HDTV. We were planning on a different unit that was not 3D. However, when we were checking them out at the electronics store they had a special on this TV that included a free Panasonic 3D bluray player with extra 3D glasses and two movies as well. Upon review we discovered that this TV was the top pic for ZD Net's 2010 Plasma TV's for 2D and 3D both so we figured we couldn't go wrong with this unit.Our previous TV was a 50 inch LG Plasma that exploded and died one night, so when considering new TV's we revisted the whole LCD vs. Plasma debate before settling on a Plasma again. I highly recommend you go into a store with multiple TV's, as there is indeed a difference in the look of the images between the technologies in addition to some weird artifact on the screens with the LCD TV's (at least to our eyes). When we were just reading about the TV's we thought for sure we'd end up with an LCD. However, once we were looking at them side by side we had no question that plasma was the right look and \"feel\" for us. (We compared both old style LCD and the LED LCD styles with the Plasmas)I'm not an AV expert, so I can't talk all the technical details. However, I've discovered that I'm definitely someone who appreciates the feel of film that you get with plasma over the more slick, soap opera look of the LCD screens. However, if you like very bright pictures the LCD might be right for you.All in all, suffice it to say that we love our new Panasonic plasma TV. It far out performs our old LG plasma. When shopping for it, it also seemed to out perform the other plasmas and LCD's in the big box electronics store when we assessed them side by side. (which I strongly recommend you do).If you're excited about 3D, you may want to read my short review about the 3D glasses you need when watching 3D movies. Panasonic TY EW3D10U - 3D glasses - active shutter We were disappointed to find that the fit and comfort of the glasses are terrible for those who have a more petite, narrow bridge of the nose. (Many women and children) To the point that it definitely interferes with enjoyment of watching the 3D movies.Summary: Great TV, received top rating by ZD Net for both 2D and 3D, visually the picture looked the best when compared to other plasmas and LCD's in the big box electronic store. However the 3D glasses by Panasonic offer a terrible fit, so check them out when considering 3D.", "Date": "October 6, 2010"}, {"Title": "Superb Television", "Author": "J.

I have only had it about a week, so this is very early in the product's life, but images are superb.  Screen uniformity is the best of any flat panel I have owned.  Images, when view off angle, are as good as they are straight on - it's really amazing how far off center this image remains consistent.  Colors are realistic (and highly adjustable) and motions are very smooth, much better than a Samsung LED I bought.  Streaming works very well (I use my Xbox 360 to stream movies) and even SD signals look very good for a flat panel HD TV.It's hard too image anyone not being please with this product.

You will have to play around with the settings for a little while after buying it to find the desired viewing preferences but when you get it, it's great.

Panasonic unhelpful in repairing their defect.", "Author": "Amazin1999", "ReviewID": "RLRWA86MU2PNP", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "I was an early adopter of this Viera 58\" 3D television.  I bought the TV in 2010, and exactly two years later I called Panasonic about this annoying fluctuation of brightness and gamma in the darks of the TV.  Essentially, when a movie cuts from a dark or bright shot, the whole TV changes brightness and pulls you out of the experience.  It's really annoying.  Panasonic gave me the usual \"turn off C.A.T.S. and set contrast to blah blah blah\".  I did every thing they suggested.  None of it helped.  They then told me it's out of warranty so they can't do anything to fix the issue.Fair enough.  If something is out of warranty, then it's out of warranty.  The end, right?  Well, yes... but then I found out this is a manufacturing defect and a known issue.  Just google \"brightness fluctuation panasonic\" and you'll get loads of complaints from other customers.  Panasonic eventually fixed this problem in the newly manufactured TVs, and released a \"confidential\" technical bulletin (Service Reference SH-B34-11-03-REV) explaining the issue is known and of factory origin.  But us early adopters who supported Panasonic and their budding 3D battle with Samsung?  Well, we got left holding the bag, because they know this is a manufacturing defect, even released a tech bulletin acknowledging this, but they'd rather cower behind the factory warranty than show a modicum of appreciation for our support.They should be publicly shamed for not jumping to fix this issue which is clearly a manufacturing flaw.  And an annoying one at that.  Especially when the solution typically just involves a simple firmware or EEPROM upgrade from a memory stick.  So, you have to ask yourself, do you really want to purchase an expensive piece of electronics from a company that knowingly hides their defects and dodges support?  Not me.  Never again.Two stars because although Panasonic may be acting unethically, the TV is really great aside from that one apparent flaw.EDIT:  28 Sept 2012, it gets worse!  I had the main board on this swapped to a factory-sealed brand new board, which is supposed to have the latest and greatest firmware.  But guess what?  The fluctuating brightness issue still persists, so literally Panasonic has done NOTHING to remedy this issue.  It's just a faulty product.  And they know it.

I started with a very negative impression of Plasma TV's and have since moved to favoring them. I have had over two weeks to experience this TV and I have not been disappointed with it's performance. The 3D is amazing and the TV is fairly simple to set up. The picture is crisp and clear from almost any angle and thus far I have not experienced distortion.TV Negatives:I found that the frame around the TV is noticeably wider than one would expect which slightly reduces the televisions sleek appeal. Every guest I have had has commented on the frame.Remote Control:Fairly standard however, the user should not have to go to menu to switch between viewing modes, i.e.; Cable, Blu-Ray, etc. One click is the way to go.Other:You must purchase the Panasonic's `Panasonic DY-WL10 Wireless LAN Adapter' (extremely overpriced) and the `Panasonic TY-CC10W Skype-Enabled Camera' (extremely overpriced) to pick your WiFi and use of Skype on the TV. I find that Panasonic's propitiatory bend to force their customers into purchasing their products extremely annoying. This will be a major factor in my next purchase. It is this factor alone that I would advise anyone to think twice before purchasing.The number of applications that are available on the TV are noticeably fewer on this model, an oversight that I hope is remedied in future firmware updates.The Panasonic 3D glasses:They work however, an unfortunate design (sides are open) and are uncomfortable.", "Date": "February 14, 2011"}, {"Title": "I'm in Love", "Author": "Jamie Breslow", "ReviewID": "R290KC5PX882M9", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "My first ever review comes from my heart.

This is my second Panny HD, and the best picture I have ever seen on any screen I've owned. Currently I have 2 other great TV's- A Pioneer Elite 50\" plasma, which is a classic, and a Samsung 56\" LED LCDtv, which I love as well.

It was not difficult to set up out of the box and the picture in its default settings is just amazing. I recommend looking at the folks who have reviewed the smaller versions of this TV who have recommended tech specs on how to view various characteristics if you have a very particular taste in screen quality.-VieraCast: helpful but limited selection of items to access the internet and the dongle to get a wireless signal was a separate purchase (and therfore more $$). That said, once you have wireless access the Netflix image is much better than the one's I get from the Sony Blu-ray player and the Nintendo Wii. I think this is because there are fewer \"jumps\" from the modem to the TV when the signal goes directly to the TV. The drawback however is selection. The Netflix interface on the Panasonic only lets you see the first 25 suggested movies based on your previous interest. The blu-ray and wii allow you to search for that particular movie you were thinking of watching.-image: I can't say anything better technically compared to other reviewers but I remember being concerned when watching game shows for the first few times on this tv. There was some pixelation when the camera would swing across the stage. But after a couple of views my wife and I realized that this is connected to the spotlights on the stage. My hope is that the pixelation is a problem on all TVs.Also make sure that your image problems are not the result of the cable connection. Since we use satellite, we sometimes get choppy images etc. After comparing numerous shows and channels we're more confident that any low resolution is due to the cable/ satellite signal than the TV-interface with other devices: the interface is pretty straightforward and we have the TV hooked up to a Sony blu-ray, a Wii, and a Sony home theater sound bar w/ subwoofer. I was a little creeped out that within a day, the controllers for all Sony devices could operate the TV, and then the Panasonic remote was able to operate the home theater soon after. I like that I only need 1 remote for 2 devices but I have never had the remotes \"figure out on their own\" how to do this! The only drawback I have faced is the use of the blu-ray. Whenever we switch to the blu-ray, we have to reset the home theater first in order to restore sound and video to the TV from the cable. for some reason the blu-ray likes to be the dominant source for the home theater and the home theater controls the TV. But the picture quality compared to this minor hassle is totally worth it.oh and the Wii image - I recommend the advanced component cables (the 4 plug thing) for a better screen image as you play. seeing the Wii on such a big screen is a real treat. we use the Wii Fit plus and while it's not crazy on graphics, the feel of exercising with the bigger image is nice (especially the bike exercise).-the only thing we have not tried is interfacing the TV with wireless headphones. I may repost if there are issues there.-admittedly, after 3 months, I have still not tried the 3D functions (shock!)- the reviews all said that 2D on this TV is amazing, and since there is only 1 set of 3D glasses, and my budget is blown from the TV purchase I haven't had a chance to find a 3D movie to watch on the TV. Besides most of the 3D content I have seen isn't all that \"3D\" so my review is based on my everyday 2D viewing.great TV, no regrets!", "Date": "January 19, 2011"}, {"Title": "Amazing TV, VieraCast needs work though.", "Author": null, "ReviewID": "R3UGC9NCBER0UV", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I won't knock the stars on the account of Vieracast, but I will tell you this:  This is one heck of a TV.  I am using the full HDMI 1.4 feature set as well (ARC).  It supports a single HDMI cable to your receiver for audio, allowing all of your devices that connect to your TV to pump audio through the TV back to your receiver.  What a cable saver! (Make sure your receiver supports ARC - Audio Return Channel).  This does take up an HDMI slot, but you have a ton.The 3D has been flat out amazing, no cross talk issues.  I am not a fan of the heavy battery-equipped glasses and plan on purchasing the newer models at some point.  You should note that when viewing 3D the glasses result in a tint (like looking through sun glasses), so you have to up the brightness when watching.  I select one of the built-in choices: vibrant.  This raises the brightness of the image to the point that you are not aware of the sunglasses effect.Vieracast, and basically all of Panasonic's menu systems are a little on the confusing side.  I love the features the offer but their interface is a little slow and cumbersome.  Netflix (once you get out of vieracast into it) is great.VieraLink allows you to control natively any panasonic device connected over HDMI (as long as it also is a vieralink device).  For me this includes my receiver and bluray player, so I just use the single TV Remote.The Remote is quite nice and has a backlight.  The one ding on the remote is that the more frequent buttons I tend to use are very low, making it uncomfortable.

I got a great deal!  The manager did much more than match the Internet price.  The TV came as a package deal, with a 3D blu-ray player, 3 sets of 3D glasses and Avatar (the movie) in 3D.  On top of that, he lowered the price on the spot (we haggled a bit, but he came around).I had never considered plasma before, but after seeing them along side LCD and LED TVs in the showroom, and after reading printed reviews in Consumer Reports, I was sold.  The picture is crisp and bold.  No back-lighting issues.  Blacks are black.  Side viewing angles can't be beat.Once I got the TV home and in the house (it is a very big box), I was pleasantly surprised at how easy it was to set up.  It took me less than an hour to open the box, remove the packaging, attach the stand, hook it up, turn it on, set it up, configure the network, register my Pandora, Picasa, and Netflix accounts, and start watching TV.  I have a home theater system, a blu-ray player, and a TiVo DVR connected to it.

If you have a 3D receiver it is okay to buy the package but if not just buy the 800 series of Samsung. The BDT 100 DVD player has only one HDMI, 1 optical output, no coax(better than optical output)and no 7.1 output. It seems that HD Audio can only only be output through HDMI but not through digital output. Hence, if  the there are no two HDMI and you do not have a 3D receiver (or create a budget for yourself for 3D receiver) your only option is using the HDMI of the BDT 100 player going to your 3D TV and no more HDMI output for a \"handshake\" to your old receiver. Its heartache but its a reality. At this time is it Panasonic concern or the promoter(sales/marketing) concern? I do not know why they did not put in the package the BDT 300 for 3K TV? Probably it is a question of integrity as compare to only few hundred dollars. If you opt for the BDT 300 it seems the price have change from $299 to 349.

In this economy who will buy a 3K thousand TV? Suggestion they should put more option on the table like if you opt for the 3K VT 25 then you get also the high end player or the better player. It seems the promotion was rush? Will update this review about 58 inch VT25 of panasonic.

I have went through YouTube consumer reports and really have extensively compared apples to apples and I don't care what anyone and I repeat ANYONE says, in my opinion this 3D system is the absolute best in the industry no ifs, and, or buts. Panasonic does not skimp on quality. It is the absolute best. I am so sold on the Vierra 25 3D Panasonic Home entertainment system that I have decided to invest in the Panasonic 65\" 3D home Entertainment system and sell all of my karaoke equipment to purchase this system. It is that good. I don't gamble on less I know I am going to win the game and make no mistake, Panasonic is the leader in home entertainment systems. If you have any doubts in all honesty you are only hurting yourself. Life is too short not to have the absolute best in your life. Live, Laugh, and Love for we shall NEVER pass this way again. Make Panasonic a part of your life and you will capture a memory that you will cherish for ever guaranteed.", "Date": "November 20, 2010"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "$3,599.99", "Features": "Panasonic TC-P58VT25 58\" 3D 1080p VIERA Plasma HDTV", "Name": "Panasonic TC-P58VT25 58 3D 1080p VIERA Plasma HDTV", "ImgURL": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51%2BgAHW-qSL._SY300_.jpg", "ProductID": "B003N3BV5O"}}
