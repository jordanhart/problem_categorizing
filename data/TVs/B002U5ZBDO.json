{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Great TV  a decent price", "Author": "burke \"RTB\"", "ReviewID": "R1HE6U7KOOL7VU", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "The Sanyo DP26649 can be had at almost any Walmart for $296.  I'm actually on my second one. The first one developed a strange but not debilitating malfunction after just two months.  Sanyo warrants their TVs for one year parts and labor but in addition if one of them malfunctions within three months it can be exchanged for a brand new one at no charge from the retailer from where it was purchased.  I exchaned mine at my neighborhood Walmart with absolutely no hassle. I can do the same thing with this one if it goes out as Walmart's policy is to issue a refund for the defective TV and resell you another one as a totally new purchase.I couldn't be more pleased with this TV.  The picture is great and the set has many inputs and an audio output which I use to feed my stereo system. I use three of separate seclectable inputs for my VCR, CD player and Wii. In addition there are two other inputs for HDMI devices and a USB input for viewing photos from a flash drive.  The TV has adjustments for just about anything one can imagine but mine worked fine for me (after the simple channel setup) right out of the box.I would have awarded the TV five stars if it had not been for the problem with my first purchase.  I have two other non digital CRT Sanyo TVs that I use with converters.  I've had these TVs for several years and have had no problems with them.  Based on my experience and Sanyo's Warranty policy I would reccommend this TV to anyone.", "Date": "January 27, 2010"}, {"Title": "Good product...great vendor !", "Author": "M.

Set works great and the DVD is just great.  Sanyo is a good set, as I looked at Walmart, however, given current low, low prices, I would go for a Samsung , Sony or Toshiba as price permits.  The new LED is the way to go if you have any vision problem.", "Date": "March 14, 2013"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "Unavailable", "Features": "26\" Full HDTV LCD (720p) TV", "Name": "Sanyo Factory DP26649 26\" 720p LCD HD TV.", "ImgURL": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/317nYChV%2B0L.jpg", "ProductID": "B002U5ZBDO"}}
