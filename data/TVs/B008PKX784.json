{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Learned my lesson the first time.", "Author": "William Blakes", "ReviewID": "R1Q9IGHNPRPLFF", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I lost a 55 inch to crack caused by father daughter time three years ago. After that I cut television out for a while. Well recently i purchased another large screen tv and didn't want to make the same mistake. This screen protector seems to do the job. I do NOT want to put it through a torture test; however,it has survived a similar object that caused the demise of the first television. My biggest recommendation is to buy more Velcro. It only comes with four Velcro strips and I placed these on the four corners. The middle has a very slight budge.  This could cause the protector itself to crack the screen. That is why the extra Velcro is needed to ensure the protector is snug against all sides of the tv. There is absolutely NO glare with this screen. I would recommend this product", "Date": "June 9, 2013"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "$239.00", "Features": "Prevent damage, scratches, fingerprints. Heavy Duty.
