{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Good picture, terrible sound quality!", "Author": "Joel G. Hancock \"JGHancock\"", "ReviewID": "RL19L0APYHLVI", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "I ordered this for the kitchen so we could have something to watch while cooking and cleaning up. It was the least expensive one I could find for the size that was just right for a small space between two cabinets. It is light weight and has very good picture quality, but the sound quality makes it almost unusable. It sounded similar to a mobile phone or tablet that is connected to an un-powered little block or pair of speakers --- almost exactly like an old hand-held transistor radio.After just two days I moved it to a guest bedroom and attached some powered speakers I had used with a notebook computer. To my surprise the sound quality was very good so it must be the speakers themselves that are so flimsy that they cannot handle the sound coming from the internal amp.This is definitely a \"don't buy\" unless you use it somewhere to be seen and not heard (like a waiting area.)", "Date": "September 2, 2013"}, {"Title": "Not bad for the price", "Author": "Nupe51", "ReviewID": "R3QR6V7P6YY96T", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "So far, so good.  It has a great picture, once you set up the TV properly.  However, as stated before, the sound is horrible which is not a big problem since I have speakers that I can hook up to the TV.  Also, installing the HDMI cord can be a problem when trying to hook the cord to the bottom HDMI connection.  The problem is due to the way that the way all of the connections are off set and it is hard to a line the HDMI up with the plug.  Also, since I have DirecTV, I cannot synchronize the remote with the TV since it does not recognize the brand name.  Other than that, it appears to be a good TV for the prices and I am satisfied..", "Date": "September 9, 2013"}, {"Title": "Good enough", "Author": "Jade", "ReviewID": "R1HS0NQANJT3YE", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "You know, I often wonder about some persons and their reviews-I think some expectations are grossly unrealistic. For anyone on the market for a reasonably priced LED TV I have to say this is a great deal compared to similar items out there. Fine the sound isn't theatre bass quality but for everyday watching its fine- there are settings that you can choose and play around with to adjust to your liking. As one person noted, slap on some cheap external speakers for things like movie watching and you will be even happier. I've enjoyed playing around with all the other features too. So far I am very satisfied with what this TV has to offer.", "Date": "September 6, 2013"}, {"Title": "Great TV for the Price", "Author": "cliftonmthomas", "ReviewID": "R1YSN0KR2IGKCN", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "The TV came packaged as well as any other I've purchased, and thoughtfully included a Philips-head screw driver to attach the base. Following the included guide, setup was a breeze with my TV tuner. The unit uses Sony codes (which is indicated in the manual) if you need to program your universal remote to operate it. The screen has great brightness and good viewing angles as you'd expect from an LED-lit panel. The only disappointment is that the built in speakers are not very loud. I didn't expect them to be great however, considering the price. Overall I'm very satisfied with the purchase so far. I'm hopeful that its apparent quality is reflected in its longevity as well.", "Date": "August 8, 2013"}, {"Title": "Very good TV for unknown brand", "Author": "Harvey Fagler", "ReviewID": "R3US3AFHHJKT5A", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Great picture and was easy to set up.

I bought this as an upgrade to my previous 19 inch purchased from Walmart. The size is perfect for a bedroom.SOUND: I have no idea what the sound complaints were about. This TV is very loud. I'm not sure if they were using it outside or something. But mine sounds really good.I am very satisfied! Got this for a steal at $116. Bought this weekend and arrived today (Tuesday, with Prime ).I went to Best Buy and saw that they had a TV the same size for 129.99+tax. However it was only 720p HD and this one is 1080p HD.I also watched the price drop on this item, when I first saw it, it was around $150.Definitely recommend this product.", "Date": "December 10, 2013"}, {"Title": "Bad tvs", "Author": "Robert", "ReviewID": "RZXXNO299HVLC", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I had high hopes for this brand given the great prices being offered, but they suck.
