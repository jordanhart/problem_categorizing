With 120hz refresh rate, and 240hz scenes per second, this television offers depth perception found only in high end LED TVs.The picture quality and black levels are very nice. The smooth motion is very visible and beautiful. Although we had to return 2 televsions to Vizio because they came with Stuck Bright Pixels, we are still very pleased with the TV over all.I would not recommend buying a Vizio from Vizio directly. The swap out of the units we had with Stuck Pixels with Vizio was a long painful process, but that does not take away from the picture quality of this unit. I would suggest going the route of Amazon or Wally World when purchasing, no questions asked returns.I updated this review and have shortened it greatly to focus back on the quality and performance of this unit.Amazons customer service is great, but PILOT delivery is bogus, it is not white glove and they are liars.That being said, I would recommend the SV421XVT to anyone wanting a good quality LCD at a reasonable price.It does not come with the bluetooth remote, no apps, no wifi, no 3d, and it does not hold a mega contrast ratio in the millions, this is a late 2009 model LCD, but at the current Amazon asking price, it would be perfect for the standard families everyday use.Deep blacks, little to no judder, bright whites, and crisp accurate color. 4 stars.", "Date": "March 10, 2010"}, {"Title": "Can't beat it for the price.", "Author": "D.

That's six days, and it didn't move for one of them due to bad weather.  You'll see some complaints around about the shipping company for large items (CEVA) but I had no issues at all with them.  Delivery company called, I told them I was at work, but could be home at any time for them to deliver, they just brought it to my work instead (at my request).  This may not be an option for some, but it worked out great for me since I didn't have to take any time off from work to have it delivered.  However, this review is for the TV, not the delivery company.The set works great.  I upgraded from a 27\" CRT television to this 42\" LCD, and obviously, the difference is stunning.  We don't have HDTV yet, but even my standard definition Dish Network looks pretty good, as does my regular DVD player over S-Video.  Blu-Ray and games on my PS3 look simply amazing.  I find the sound quality to be very good without external speakers, but my living room is on the small side (the seating is about 8' from the TV)Probably the only complaint I could say about this TV yet is that the cable they provide to hook to the wall so it won't fall over (if you aren't wall mounting) is kind of unsightly.  However, most people probably won't use it, and this is a very minor detail.  I just used it because, for one, this is a big purchase for me and I don't want to take any chances, and we have two cats that like to climb on top of the TV where it's warm...I don't think they could even lay on top of this TV, but I'm sure they will try.I did months of research on HDTVs before settling on this model from Vizio.  Overall, I found that no matter which TV you look at, there are negative reviews.  Given that, no matter which TV I purchased, I would have gotten an extended warranty to cover it in case I got one of the bad ones.  With the Vizio, I was able to get a quality set with the extended warranty for less that I could have gotten a bigger name brand without the extended warranty.Of note to anyone that is looking at 240Hz, Vizio uses a different technology to achieve 240Hz than does Sony.  I'm not saying this makes it better or worse, because I haven't compared them, but take that into consideration.", "Date": "February 16, 2010"}, {"Title": "Football games won't be the same!", "Author": "John E.

So basically, LOTS of green! I've done a lot of troubleshooting, some at the instruction of Vizio technical support. The discoloration is present via the HDMI cable for my HD DVR cable box and via RCA cables for my DVD player and Wii...so therefore not a problem from the inputs--it's the Vizio. Since the tv is no longer under warranty, Vizio kindly recommended third party tv repair companies...sorry, but I do not intend to pay $350 (their quote) to fix a tv that was brand new and perfect less than two years ago.A pretty thorough Google search indicates that this is not an anomaly (try it: Google 'vizio green screen') and that lots of other people have had this problem with their Vizio tvs. Apparently there is a way for me to fix it which requires taking the tv apart and replacing a $20 cable (another reason I will not be paying anyone $350!), but I have yet to try it. We'll see how that goes!Bottom line, if you think such a big purchase should last longer than 2 years, keep looking for other brands.

I did a LOT of research before purchasing this TV, and kept coming back to Vizio.  My brother-in-law has an older Vizio plasma, and I was always impressed with it, so I initially looked at Vizio's anyway, but wanting to make sure I did my due-diligence, I studied just about everything I could.  Even ignoring the prices of different TVs, I kept coming back to the Vizio brand based on the quality reviews I heard/read, and the technical offerings for each of their products.  Once you add in the relatively low prices for Vizios compared to anything else on the market, it became a no-brainer.I was a bit skeptical about ordering an HDTV over the internet, but everything worked out perfectly.  The delivery guys even helped get it out of the box and up onto my TV stand.  It has worked perfectly so far since day one, and we use it quite heavily.  My wife had foot surgery the same week the TV was delivered, so she was off her feet, and spent a lot of time with the TV on the first few weeks, and yet we've had not one single problem yet.The only complaint I have with this unit has to do with Sound.  The built-in speakers themselves are just fine, and have good volume.  But I have a surround sound stereo system, and getting the two synched up was VERY difficult at first.  Ultimately, it came down to adjusting some settings in the stereo, and nothing was necessarily the TVs fault, so this is quite likely something that might be experienced with all HDTVs (never had this problem with my old SDTV).  At first, we were having a lot of lag issues with the stereo not matching up with the TV signal, or with Blu-rays/DVDs.  Now that we've got it sorted out, everything sounds great.  I do have to leave the TVs internal speakers turned off though, as they are still just slightly out-of-sync with the stereo system.  But the stereo pushes enough sound that it really makes no difference.Overall, I'm SO pleased with this purchase, and highly recommend this TV.", "Date": "January 6, 2010"}, {"Title": "Love the picture...but it was faulty!", "Author": "Ike", "ReviewID": "R151PGF8X4WQA", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "The picture is amazing.  It's better than I've seen in many store displays for ANY TV.  The motion is cool, but it does take some getting used to.  The colors and contrast looks great, and the speakers are pretty good as well.  I would have given this TV a 5 stars, but mine was faulty!  After only a few hours of watching, the screen went black.  Some are calling this the \"black screen of death.\"  The audio still comes through, but the lights to out.  You have to turn the TV off and back on to get the picture back.  Vizio tries to get you to do a reset, but that did nothing.  I also read to turn off the adaptive luma feature, but that did not help either.  So why would I give this TV 4 stars?  Yes, the picture was that good!  Amazon made my return easy, and a new one is on the way.  I'm going to give it another go.  Hopefully, my second set won't have this same issue.  If it does, I'll have to post an updated review.  The picture is worth the gamble on another one.  Roll the dice.", "Date": "February 25, 2011"}, {"Title": "GREAT!", "Author": "C.

I've got other Vizio smaller TV's in other rooms but they are not as high a quality as this 240 hz is, which certainly makes sense, since they are only 60 hz. My husband was bedbound in the same room as this TV for 3 months and we hardly ever cut it off even at night because he had a hard time sleeping so he would watch it most of the night and day, it would stay on constantly for weeks at a time which was quite a work-out for it.

I feared getting this model after searching the internet and stores for a like tv with a better price, but none were to be found; plus I read a lot of negative feedback people left online for this item.  But, I've had nothing but positive things to say about this product.  The unit has good sound and a good picture.  I also own a 55 inch Samsung LED 8000 unit, so I know what LED looks like and this Vizio LCD looks spectacular but costs a whole lot less.  I think the sound is quite good for tv speakers, in fact, I cannot imagine stock speakers being much better.  The picture is clear and crisp.  Now, I've only had the unit for 2 weeks, so if it changes I will revise this review.  The remote is okay and simple to use; since I have ATT U-verse I use that remote to operate the tv, not the tv remote.  The Vizio on/off light is helpful in knowing by sight if the unit is left on with no signal (light turns from white (on position) to orange (off position)).  This tv has great connection options which can go unnoticed to the unexperienced buyer.  The back has several HDMI and a component ports, which are easy to reach and use.  Plus there is one HDMI and one component port on the side of the unit.  There is no ethernet connection option, but if you purchase a blu-ray/dvd player with ethernet, then you won't miss it on the tv, because you can access the internet using the blu ray/dvd player.

We originally ordered an Element 60hz and it was horrible! So I took it back and ordered this one. The picture is crystal clear. However, we do have the HD dish programing and dvr receiver which helps, the dish before we switched it all over to HD gave a slightly distorted image but nothing bad enough to make me send it back like the other tv. The sound is also amazing! The first tv sounded like an 80's sound system from a middle school. This one sounds just like it should. No surround sound required if your fine with having the sound just right infront of you, which I am perfectly fine with because I have a baby and would never get to \"use\" a surround sound anyway. I will say that one thing that takes getting used to is the picture, because of the 240hz it is exactly like you are the one holding the camera following the people around. The best I can think of to compare it to would be like a soap opera or filmed stage play, or the deleted scenes from movies- before all the editing. So, I think that film makers are going to need to step up the graphics to stay ahead of these new tv hz. It will take a brand new movie and make it look like a buget film because of how vivid and real it looks, its like 3d without being 3d. You see everything the camera guy sees. It makes scary movies, ultra scary because the thing is running right at you behind the camera, it makes me wonder if a camera guy has ever punched someone because he got lost in the scene. Anyway, great buy! I'd do it again. If your livingroom can hold it, get a 60\".

I noticed a plastic smell when I first took the TV out of the box.  I don't think it was more strong than any other tv would be, and definitely not unbearable.  After it had been out of the box for a day I did not notice it anymore, not because I was used to the smell, but because it just wasn't there or wasn't strong enough.Anyway, I've bought many things from Amazon and have not been disappointed yet.

Traveis \"Prod Design Engineer\"", "ReviewID": "RGNMKO7LEXYGF", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I loved the VIZIO SV421XVT. The picture quality was great.  The sound, using the internal speakers was kind of hit-or-miss depending on how it interpreted the Surround encoding.  I ended up compensating by turning off the advanced Audio features.  I missed a feature that our older Panasonic LCD had - Closed Caption on Mute.  It's a great feature and it comes in handy when a program is on and a call comes in.Once again, I found the picture quality to be great!  But there was one aspect of this TV that forced me to return it - The TV emits a nasty hot plastic odor when running.  We gave it two whole weeks to \"air out\" but it never got any better.  The plastic stink was the first thing that I would smell when walking into the room.  I finally got sick of it and sent it back.After, I did a sniff check of other >40\" LCD TV's.  I found that all of the Vizio's had the plastic stink, as did Toshiba.  Sony, Sharp and Panasonic had no plastic smell at all.Samsung TV's had a mild plastic smell, but the Samsung LED LCD TVs had no plastic smell at all - maybe the ultra-thin chassis doesn't use the same kind of plastic.So, if you are thinking of getting a Vizio, find a new one on display and give the top venting a quick sniff.  Most people don't have problems with the smell, but if you do, you will want to avoid these TVs.UPDATE!

I unpacked it myself ...easy! Because I read the reviews I was forewarned to get  extra HDMI cables, which I did through Amazon as well (for a much cheaper price than Radio Shack or Best Buy). Order two ...the second will come in handy for something else I'm sure.  Since this was my first digital TV I realized I had a learning curve but calling my cable company made it less stressful. They first had me switch out their analogue DVR to a digital DVR(I said I had a learning curve).Unpacking and setting up was a breeze. The HDMI cable it came with made connecting easy and the Wizard walks you through set up. Although figuring out how to set up \"Input\" took me longer than it should have (more learning curve) but I was soon up and running. Another call to the cable company had them setting me for the digital channels and walked me through getting the control of the TV with the cable channel changer (the cable booklet was out dated for this TV but their TI's had one that worked).I guess I wanted to complicate my life because I also bought a Samsung Blu-ray player as well but hooking it up was also a breeze with the extra HDMI cable I bought (it didn't come with one). I haven't bought the wireless adapter for it so I haven't been able to do any streaming from it yet. I have a wireless set up for my laptop but so far I'm getting enough entertainment through cable channels and Netflix by mail (Bu-ray dvds) and I doubt the streaming is as good as getting the Blu-ray dvds so I'm in no rush.The picture is sharp and fantastic. Movies and my favorite shows are mesmerizing. My husband loves watching his favorite sports shows and the Kentucky Derby felt like we were there. The blacks are black and the color is wonderful, no need to adjust, though you can.The Speakers are great. The sound can be adjusted which I did and got a rich surround sound. They also have plenty of volume. I haven't pushed them too hard as I live in an apartment would hate to blast out my neighbors. I realize having external speakers would make it even better but the speakers sound better than I expected so I will hold out till my son comes to visit ...he is the expert on sound, and let him help me choose and do the wiring for that.I've had it for 4 months now and so far so good. No problems as of yet. I did a lot of research before settling on this one then I ran it by the office TI. He, too, thought it was a good deal for what it offers.

Of course the price was a definite factor in my purchasing this TV. You can't beat $550 for what this TV offers. From what I've read in other reviews, there seems to be a \"strange plastic smell\" that some Vizio TV's give off. Well, first thing I did when I took it out of it's box was take a whiff of the TV, both hoping not to smell anything and expecting some funky smell. Well, I didn't smell anything out of the ordinary. I had a slight \"new\" smell to it, but that was it. After two weeks of having it, I haven't noticed any smell whatsoever....and yes, I have performed the sniff test more than once to make sure I didn't get a funky smelling TV.There have been complaints about the Vizio logo just below the screen. It may vary from person to person....because it doesn't bother me at all. Even when I pay attention to it....I soon forget about it and watch the amazing picture. It does stay on and is an orangish color when the TV is off and turns white when you turn the TV on. I personally do not find it distracting at all. I have three other family members that I never told about that particular issue that people were having....and they have never even mentioned the light at the bottom. So that particular issue might vary from person to person.Now about the picture....WOW. I hooked up my HD cable box with an HDMI cable and tuned into an HD channel. Wow. The picture is amazing! So crisp and smooth. I know to say you can tell the difference between 120Hz and 240Hz would be a total fib...either way, the picture on this TV is amazing! Definitely better than 60Hz. Like a few others have said, you won't get true 1080p signals from many sources(besides a blu-ray player), my personal cable box gives off a 720p signal. The picture is still amazing. I've hooked up my Xbox 360 to this TV via HDMI cable..and again, wow. Game play is so smooth and crisp. Definite five star picture quality. I can't wait to get a Blu-ray player to really blow my mind!The sound: Through my research of TV's, I've found that LCD TV's are not known for superior sound quality. This particular TV has some good and bad reviews are far as the sound goes. I personally am ok with the sound. I still experience the issue of volume difference when going from program to commercial, though definitely not as bad as my older TV's. It's not surround sound quality, but it's very decent considering the horrible reviews I've read for some TV's.I think the only issue I've had that I would really complain about, is the delivery of the TV. Apparently the delivery company(which is some off brand delivery company) is supposed to call to set up a delivery time. I was counting on this since I knew that there would be a good chance I wouldn't be home around the time it would be ready to be delivered. Well, imagine my surprise when I got home to find my TV sitting in the living room(still in it's box). A family member just so happened to be home when the delivery company showed up un-announced. I was definitely lucky in that regard. So be sure to have someone home when it's supposed to be delivered(according to the tracking number given) because they WILL NOT call you to set up a delivery time.All in all, I am VERY happy with this TV. Great picture, good sound and very good price. I know that are some reviews that say Vizio is a horrible company and product. I suppose like anything it's relative. I haven't seen or heard of a company, product, service ect., that has a 100% approval rating.

It looked a bit weird somehow, and my wife and I both thought it looked better off. Maybe it would be better for sports, but for most video games and movies it looks overprocessed. It does take a bit of tweaking to find the calibration settings that make everything look good, but the mode button is easily assessable to Riggins through if the colors or brightness is not acceptable on a certain movie or game.The only thing I would change is to add the ability to delete extra inputs from the toggle menu.

I did a lot of research and basically settled on the fact that I would be buying a Vizio based on the 240 Hz, the pricing and the reviews.  I really wanted to get the sv422xvt because I liked the idea of the internet apps.  I waited for the pricing to come down on it and it never did, so I got the sv421xvt from Dell because I had a gift card.  As it turns out, someone gave me a Tivo which has the internet apps included with it.As far as the sv421 is concerned, the HD channels are incredible.  There was a little bit of distortion for some of the March Madness games we were watching.  We turned the smoothing on high and decreased the sharpness and that helped a little. Still, the image was extremely clear.  The sound is okay.  Nothing great.  I hooked it up to our stereo and it greatly improved the sound.  Unfortunately our cable provider still has a large number of analog channels.  Some of the channels actually look pretty close to HD, but there are several that look pretty grainy.  I think the grainy images are even more apparent because of the difference in the image quality of the HD channels.  For anyone that does not receive any HD or digital channels, these HD LCD's might not be the right TV for you.Delivery went very smoothly.  They did not set the TV up for me, just dropped it off.  Setting up the TV is fairly easy.  Most people should be able to handle it.  The biggest problem was moving out our old TV which weighed 150 lbs.  So far no plastic smell with the new TV.Overall I am very pleased with the purchase and would recommend it.  I am now trying to decide if I should purchase the extended warranty through Vizio.

The picture quality is great and the sound is, too. Watching HD TV is like almost being there. I would highly recommend this TV to anyone. I think that the 240hz. is the key to it's great picture.

Which is important for a tv, I'd say. ;)However, if you want to use this for gaming, you may want to look elsewhere. The input lag from the HDMI imputs is roughly 80ms. Might not sound like much, but when you're playing any type of game on your console, it is ALOT. The tv comes with a 'game' mode, but it doesn't seem to help any. I've tried all the various settings to improve the latency, but the only solution I've foud is to use the RGB input instead of HDMI. Which I would be fine with, but there is only 1 RGB input. Meaning that if you hook up your computer and xbox to the tv, you'll have to choose which one you want to have zero latency.For this reason, I'll likely be selling it and buying one with an actual game mode (or else 2 RGB inputs to bypass the image processing)TL;DR: If you plan on using this to watch tv or movies and nothing else, it's great! Great price for a great tv! If you want to use it for gaming, be warned that there is a substantial input lag.", "Date": "April 2, 2011"}, {"Title": "Overall a great tv.", "Author": "Mark Hill", "ReviewID": "R1ATJXI03OUT8Q", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "My only disappointment is that two weeks after I bought it from Amazon Sam's dropped the price on them $150.

We beat it to death because we are a gaming, surfing, netflixing family. The picture is stunning - there is NO blur with even the most elaborate graphics during fast game play.Very very happy. The aps are no big deal but nice to have = we can slideshow our pics off facebook nicely with no other connections (it's wireless).NO mechanical or performance issues whatsoever and it even sounds good. I gave it four stars because of course it would be better with a home theater system but the built in speakers hold their own.The price is GREAT. I saw it on sale on amazon last year for 759 and missed the sale and then refused to buy it for over 900. I waited and waited and finally went to costco and grabbed it for about 820 total (w/NYC sales tax)Since I picked it up I can't comment on delivery but I would not hesitate to buy this tv at this price!PS Keep in mind this is not a true 240hz.

AMAZON HAD THE BEST PRICE ($848) & I GOT FREE SHIPPING/HANDLING.  I DID NOT TAKE THE EXTENDED WARRANTY BECAUSE MOST OTHER REVIEWERS SAID IT WAS NOT NECESSARY (HOPE THEY WERE RIGHT) & THE COMPANY THAT AMAZON OFFERED TO GET ONE FROM DIDN'T GET GOOD REVIEWS, ITSELF.  MY HUSBAND & I ARE, SOMEWHAT, TECHNICALLY CHALLENGED BUT OUR DAUGHTER IS PRETTY GOOD WITH TECH.  IT ONLY TOOK HER A FEW MINUTES TO SET IT UP & HOOK IN THE CABLE/DVR BOX & OUR DVD/VCR COMBO.  OUR LIVING ROOM IS ABOUT 11 FEET WIDE & THE TV PICTURE IS CLEAR (BUT NOT STUNNING) IF YOU ARE ACROSS THE ROOM (EXCEPT FOR CARTOONS WHICH ARE CLEAR EVEN IF YOU ARE STANDING IN FRONT OF THE SCREEN).  WE DO NOT HAVE THE TV HOOKED UP TO ANY EXTERNAL AUDIO SYSTEM BUT THE QUALITY IS FINE FOR US.  THE ONLY ODD THING THAT HAPPENS IS --- SOMETIMES IF THE TV HAS ONLY BEEN OFF FOR A FEW HOURS, THERE IS A WEIRD BUZZING NOISE THAT HAPPENS AFTER THE TV \"RETRIVES THE DATA\" & THE PICTURE COMES ON.  THEN THERE IS NO SOUND & YOU HAVE TO CHANGE THE CHANNEL TO GET SOUND. IF THE TV HAS BEEN OFF OVERNIGHT, NO BUZZING BUT YOU STILL HAVE TO CHANGE THE CHANNEL TO GET SOUND. THIS MAY BE OUR CABLE COMPANY'S GLITCH.  WE DON'T KNOW YET. OTHER REVIEWERS HAVE MENTIONED SOUND ISSUES.

We love the TV. The picture is insanely beautiful. The sound is fine. Our biggest problem! After only two months all of the HDMI ports (used to watch HD satellite TV and our Blu-ray player) just stopped working! All we get is a blue screen. It is going to be at least another week before someone even comes out to try and fix it. We are all really disappointed that this has happened and that Vizio has no explanation as to why our two month old television would stop working. We are able to watch TV through the AV, but we didn't buy the tv for that. Now we are stuck paying for HD satellite service that we can't even view. i have searched online and apparently this is not something that is rare. We bought this TV because of the glowing reviews in Consumer Reports and on other websites.

After making every adjustment known to man, the picture still looked fuzzy and blurry no true image at all.While playing with the picture off and on for hours I started to smell a wierd and strong plastic odor coming from the tv, as stated in previous reviews.I gave it a chance to maybe subside but it didnot so,I decided to box it back up and ship it right back.It sat overnight before shipping it out and I still noticed the plastic smell coming out of the box.I had friends come over to inquire about this great tv and they even said they could smell the plastic stench. I know your not suppose to believe everything you read but, after all the great reviews and ignoring the bad I decided to give this tv a go and Boy was I wrong. For all the positive reviews, these people really need glasses bad and a new nose to boot.
