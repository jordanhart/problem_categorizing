I can't believe that the only other smart TV of the same size is over $100 more expensive.  I bought this TV to use in my garage.  I don't have cable or satellite connection there so I really wanted a smart TV so I could watch Netflix, Vudu, YouTube, and listen to music while I'm working.  The TV connected to my wireless router with no problem and the picture on Netflix and Vudu look excellent!  There are also radio apps like Pandora and a Philips radio app that let's you listed to stations from all around the world.  I connected an old non-amplified indoor antenna and was able to pick up many of the local broadcast digital channels.  I'm going to try a newer antenna and see what happens.  I wasn't expecting to get much over-the-air so I was surprised.", "Date": "July 23, 2012"}, {"Title": "The 22 model does NOT have MediaConnect", "Author": "SEG", "ReviewID": "R9KWI99XP80K", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "It's a fine TV.

I needed one much brighter, better viewing angle and at least decent sound. I only had a limited shelf space for it so 22\" was the absolute max. Wifi with a netflix/radio app would be great too. I vowed not to pay more than $200 for it.So this little Philips comes out in Spring, but I waited until a few reviews showed up and the price dropped to <$200. I finally got it in Aug from Walmart.com, delivered to the local store (so I could take it back easily).It's just right. Very bright and non-reflective (it needs to be because shop is well lit), good color and sound, viewing angle is good and the wifi apps work smooth. I tried the USB port for pics and video to make sure it worked, but I don't use that feature. There's a little lag on button presses on the remote, but it's a small thing to me. It's really only used a few hours on the weekends, and maybe an hour during the week, so if it has a reliability issue it might take awhile before I encounter it.I think this TV would do fine in a kitchen or a guest bedroom. When our old CRT TV finally goes in our exercise room, I'll probable get this 22\" Philips or it's bigger 26\" brother, to replace it.", "Date": "October 7, 2012"}, {"Title": "excellent nettv, 22\" DOES NOT have mediaconnect feature!", "Author": "WarrenH", "ReviewID": "R3H2L65XUTOTT2", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I ordered this as a replacement for a old 19 CRT which died and I also needed to use to view my computer's screen, however on receiving this item the mediaconnect feature was not available for this model to my disappointment.

Phillips poor customer Service", "Author": "Kanitra Brooks", "ReviewID": "R3FZFM0QD6PTQL", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "I was thrilled to received the unit. It worked well and helped  free up the family computer. Imagine my surprise when after only 3 months it stopped working. I didn't panic, I called Phillips the next day regarding warranty replacement options. They asked very few questions (apparently this happens all the time) and agreed to and a new unit out if I faxed in my receipt. I followed the agents instructions to the letter. When I did not hear from the company as promised I made a follow up call a few days later. They requested I send another variation of my amazon receipt .......then another, and another.

TV appeared to be OK until I connected it.  Horrible picture - horrible color - huge disappointment.  Description stated that it was \"internet compatible\" - talked to Philips tech and he said that ONLY 26\" and up were \"internet compatible\".  I suggested that they change their online description.AMAZON provided easy and comfortable RETURN for me and immediately credited my account.  I think that IF Amazon had packaged and shipped this TV, it would have been in good condition.  I would have still been disappointed that it was NOT \"internet compatible\" but I think the quality of the picture and color would be much better.BE CAREFUL about product description.
