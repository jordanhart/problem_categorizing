I bought it at my local VCS store. I was looking for a small replacement flat screen for my boat and really like the DVD combo aspect for $219.00. It fits perfectly on the bulkhead of my sailboat and the picture quality is true HD even though I'm using an antenna, and not cable. The one drawback is that the antenna/cable connection on the back sticks straight out and when it's mounted on a wall it forces the cable wire to be bent downward. I would have preferred the connection be on the bottom pointing down like my other one was. I would not suggest this as a primary TV (unless it for the kids or in a dorm room), but as a secondary TV this is an awesome deal that looks great and is priced perfectly.EDIT: I found a 90 degree connector on Amazon that solved my problem for $2.88!http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000VIQ6AO/ref=cm_cr_ryp_prd_img_sol_0", "Date": "September 18, 2013"}, {"Title": "Great Buy!", "Author": "Al", "ReviewID": "R1C3MCW09P9FDG", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Bought for guest bedroom.

The box and advertising said that this is a 1080p TV with connections for a PC so one would assume it can be used as a monitor.  Unfortunately with computers (and the PC input) this product only performs up to 1360x768 resolution which is worse the 720p and with any higher resolution the TV says \"Not Supported\".  After trying for hours to get this monitor to work the best it could do was 1080i (with the HDMI input) which is essentially 720p and even at that resolution, the edges of the picture were cut off.  The display quality looks like a cheap $90 monitor from the 80s. (And FYI the stand is not adjustable at all it's literally just a plastic post).  I thought that maybe there was some setting I was missing because I wasn't even getting close to 1080p resolution so I called Sansui customer support. When I asked the Sansui support representative about the problem she told me that it was my computer and not the monitor and when I asked for more details she hung up on me. I have a $1000+ PC with a high end graphics card and there's no reason why this monitor shouldn't display 1080p unless it can't actually display at that resolution. When I called back and spoke with Larry he said I just have to \"play around with it\" until I find something that works.  Aside from hanging up, that's some of the worst technical support I've heard.  Don't WASTE your money on this. I wish I hadn't thrown away the box.", "Date": "July 10, 2013"}, {"Title": "Great picture quality", "Author": "mom05", "ReviewID": "R3COC2ZEFCAQB", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I absolutely love this tv, it was a gift for my daughter.
