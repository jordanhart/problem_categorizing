For the money, you can get a larger sized samsung like a 32\", or for the same size TV you can save big bucks by going with a westinghouse or other bargain priced TV's sized at 26\" which is ideal for a bedroom.  After purchasing a 26\" westinghouse and not being extremely happy I bought a 32\" Vizio.  Still not satisfied, I left the bargain TV basement and took the plunge and bought this TV.  Wow, what a difference.  At $300-$400 dollars more than the westy, I'm not sure if it's that much better if tied to a budget, but if you've got it (cash), get it (sony). As far as specs go, read the description, but rest assured this TV is really nice.  Sound is better than expected for a 26\", menus are nice, picture is B.A.  On XBOX 360, the best and most graphically demanding game is by far Gears of War.  This TV makes it look incredible.  The darks are dark enough in the spooky parts unlike other TVs I've tried out which looked washed out and lame.  This set really makes the whole thing look alot better.  I have been switching between the 3 presets (vivid, cinema, standard) and haven't made any tweaks yet exept for turning on the dynamic lighting.  I'm sure you could make the picture even better with some adjustments but it's unnecessary.", "Date": "July 16, 2007"}, {"Title": "great LCD TV", "Author": "ALKJ", "ReviewID": "R1H6C69FRWTM0M", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I am very happy with the sony lcd tv.

Lerner", "ReviewID": "RTST54GIPKN19", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I got this LCD a week ago and LOVE IT. PC Richards lowered their price to $699. So I took their ad to a competitor retailer and they matched it. PCR is still selling it for that price.(Updated this part)It is in my bedroom and connected to basic cable, no box. My cable signal was too weak up there and I could not get the free HD channels. I did not want another cable box due to the expense. So, I bought a Motorla signal booster and connected it into the main splitter inside the house and it solved my problem. I am now getting 7 free HD stations in the bedroom and a much better picture in the rest of the house. I also replaced the coax cable from the wall with some RG6 cable that is better for HD.Dislikes:1. The remote is designed funny. The channel up/down buttons are on the bottom of the remote and are not easy to access for channel surfing. They should have put it in the middle of the remote, IMO.2. The analog picture is OK. A little grainy. Get a box if this is an issue for you. The signal booster helped enough to increase the picture quality to satisfy me.3. The small shiny green (power) light on the bottom center of the TV is slightly annoying. It should have been off to the side of the tv, IMO.Likes:1. HD reception is great. I'm getting 480i, 720p and 1080i from basic cable which the TV converts to 720p and the picture is incredible. I really like watching this TV, esp at night with no lights. WOW!2. I like the matte finish. I never liked that high glossy look due to the glare and dust that black gloss cabinetry brings.3. When hooked up to a Sony upconvert dvd player via HDMI, the picture was impressive.4. The tuner is very strong. It found 35 digital channels including some one HBO channel (which I subscribe to via cable box downstairs).5. The \"Wide Zoom\" option is good for the non-HD channels as it doesn't make the faces too wide. I have set it to auto so I don't have to change it every time I watch a non-HD channel.6. The sound is loud enough for me. No external speakers required. And the Sony S-Force \"simulated surround\" is awesome.7. Quick channel changes via the remote. Maybe 1-2 seconds. Unlike some other LCDs out there that take 3 seconds.8. The Xross Media Bar is the best menu system I have used on a TV.This model was made in 2006 and sold in 2007, so it should be on sale now until the Spring 08 models arrive. Buy it if its around $700-725. I am very glad I bought this TV. It is the best 26 inch LCD out there and I highly recommend it to anyone who is looking for this size TV.", "Date": "January 31, 2008"}, {"Title": "Great LCD", "Author": "Timothy Adams", "ReviewID": "R2RF9Y9DPZ6D79", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I replaced a Westinghouse LCD with this Sony.

It is not hooked up to high def...just regular cable. The tenant has the option of buying a high def box. What's excellent about the TV is its ease of navigation. It has a convenient toggle on the remote that switches between wide and standard screen viewing. I think the non def picture is as good as you can find on a new HDTV, but it is indeed a little \"blurry\" when viewed too close. A Samsung I bought at the same time for a different use (mostly high def) has a slightly worse high def picture than the Sony, although it too is a good TV.", "Date": "September 30, 2007"}, {"Title": "If only Sony was as good as Amazon, J&R; & UPS", "Author": "Barbara J. Wertz", "ReviewID": "RG756824HZ7VD", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "Before reviewing the product I do want to say that I couldn't have been more pleased with the speedy delivery from Amazon, J&R; Music and Computer World and UPS.  I input my order to Amazon at 11:37 PM on a Wednesday evening and the TV was on my doorstep at 1:30 PM on Friday afternoon, just under 38 hours.  J&R;'s warehouse is about 130 miles from my house so no grass was growing between the toes of Amazon, J&R; or UPS.Unfortunately the speedy service was to no avail since it will be about 2 weeks before I'll be able to enjoy my new TV.  It was defective out of the box.  Best guess is a faulty tuner.  It's now in the capable hands of a local Sony Factory Authorized repair shop.  I know this repair shop is capable because in the past they've repaired another Sony TV and 2 Sony tape decks which were also defective out of the box.Why can't Sony get over this tendency?  We're not talking about cheap junk here.  Sony makes good stuff, once it's been repaired.  I went over to Best Buy and checked out all of the major brands side-by-side.  In fact I went to three Best Buys and a Circuit City just in case some of them were better at tuning a TV than others.  Sony definitely had the best picture in this size TV.  Just be prepared to get in line at the repair shop behind other owners of brand new Sony equipment.", "Date": "September 21, 2007"}, {"Title": "Works well as a computer monitor!", "Author": "Marc Martin", "ReviewID": "RAFKG8AOFTNUK", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Am I the only one who thinks the pixel size on typical computer monitors is way too small?  Fortunately, one can buy HDTVs and essentially choose their pixel size, which is what I did with this 26\" Sony Bravia.  With my PC, I can run it at 1360 x 768 pixels, and the Bravia is smart enough not to scale it (\"1:1 pixel mapping\" is what it's called).  In fact, no matter what resolution I send to the Bravia via my computer (600x800, 768x1024), the Bravia shows it unscaled, and this results in a smaller, centered image with black borders.  This applies to both the VGA (PC) input  and also the HDMI (via a DVI adapter) input.Also note that I had previously tried using a 26\" LG HDTV, but the LG had fuzzy/blurry text on both the HDMI and VGA inputs.  Not so with the Sony -- text is razor sharp.  However, I do note that colored text (e.g., blue text on a white background) will sometimes have some artifacts around the edges -- this may be due to the S-PVA panel design... I don't know.  I can live with it, though, especially since there is no problem with black text on a white background.Comparing this to the other TVs in the stores, I noticed that the colors were \"truer\" on the Sony than other sets, presumably due to the wide color gamut backlight.  I did notice however that the Panasonic set had a more pleasing degradation for off-axis viewing -- with the Sony, just a slight change in left/right changed the amount of black detail.  The Panasonic image seemed more consistent with slight viewing angle changes (however, the Panasonic didn't appear to be designed for computer use at all).As for the TV's speakers, well, they seem a bit \"tinny\" -- I'll stick with my computer speakers.Also, one nice feature is that when using the VGA input, the Bravia will automatically go into standby mode if no signal is fed into it, and power back up when a signal is detected.  Unfortunately, this feature does not work when the computer is hooked up via the HDMI input, so one would have to manually turn the TV on or off if you use this input (although I can't really discern any difference in picture quality between the HDMI and VGA inputs, which is good, because with the LG HDTV I tried, the VGA quality was far worse than HDMI).", "Date": "July 25, 2007"}, {"Title": "Function vs. Features", "Author": "R. G. Taylor", "ReviewID": "R1WP79NVE0O9JE", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I originally purchased a 26\" Samsung LNT2653H.  I was very satisfied with the picture quality and abundant features that I would later discover are more plentiful than the Sony.  But the deal breaker was the absolutely inferior and inadequate audio production from the Samsung.  At relatively moderate volume levels the sound would frequently distort and cut out.  I also found the Samsung picture to break up on one of the major network's HD broadcasts.  I was compelled to return the Samsung and fortunately found the Sony at an equivalent price.  I received fast and free shipping from both Amazon and Abt for each set (Abt even shipped in a double box).  The return to Amazon was also hassle-free. Thanks Amazon.The Sony and Samsung have nearly identical input ports (Samsung has an additional RF input).  Samsung offers a programmable remote, more picture adjustments, an audio equalizer, and much better menu navigation.  Adding and deleting channels and setting up favorite channels was easily accomplished in one, on-screen channel list.  Favorite channels are stepped through using the remote button. Sony makes you select each individual channel, choose options, then add or delete it from the favorite channel list, and then repeat this sequence for each channel (ugh). Instead of stepping through the favorite channels, the remote button pops up another list that you need to scroll through and select from.  This is somewhat indicative of  many Sony features.The Sony has an equally satisfying HD picture and I found it to display SD sources with better quality than the Samsung.  It also detected many OTA digital channels that the Samsung did not.  Overall, I found Sony has a much stronger tuner combination than Samsung.  And the sound is equally satisfying.  In the 3rd Lord of the Rings feature, the shreek produced by the large flying creatures did not clip or distort, even at fairly high volumes (not even close on the Samsung).  Sony also handles various video formats through the PC port better.I'd love to be able to take the best of both sets and make one `super set' from them, but when it comes down to it, I have to choose the superior Sony function over superior Samsung features.", "Date": "April 2, 2008"}, {"Title": "sony flat screen tv", "Author": "colorado farmer \"colorado farmer\"", "ReviewID": "R3AMQ5TW2CB0KE", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I bought this, worrying that it would be so confusing to hook up, I would spend money hiring people to do it.It came with a large \"easy set-up\" sheet ( reminds me of what my Apple computers always come with).

I have an antena picking up network digital and HD over the air and the picture smooths out when I go from cable to antenae. The antena tuner is terrific. This set picks up channels that my other HD tvs do not. (Sony: One button switching between Cable source and Antena source would be great. That feature is on my XBR 960 and it would be nice on this set.)I hooked my PC to the monitor via 15 pin VGA and played Battlefield 2142. It looked spectacular and did a fine job.The picture is bright. The sound is pretty good but not great. It sounds fine for tv programing but doesn't have much for base if you want to listen to music.I would buy this set again in a heart beat. Sony did a good job and it looks fine with 720p.

I managed to find one for $650, delivered, online from Beach Camera in NJ and it arrived this Tuesday. I immediately ran to my local cable company office and traded in my old digital converter box for a Hi Def converter box.  I require a converter box because I subscribe to all of the Premium channels, so although I could probably pick up many Hi Def channels without it, I would loose the Premium channels.I did see the replacement model in a Circuit City and the picture was equally as gorgeous, but does not have Surround Sound, the speakers are half the wattage of this model and it lacks a number of other features.  Others have reviewed the new model on Amazon, so you can easily read the differences.It has a gazzilon options in terms of picture. I find new things every day. I have the cable box connected with an HDMI cable, which I had to buy, since my cable company only provides composite cables with the Hi Def box and HDMI is infinitely better, having now used both.I am absolutely thrilled with this set. I am a long time Sony fan anyway.If you are in the market for a 26\" Hi Def....and can still get your hands on this model...DO IT!  You will not be sorry.The sound is quite good.  The base is more stable than many of the others that I looked at. (I live in an earthquake prone area, so stability is an important issue for me.) The case is simple and attractive. It is not gaudy or shiney.  I did not want a high gloss finish anyway. It will not be the dust magnet that the high gloss ones are.I have it in my bedroom, which is a small room. When I want larger sound (like for the many Premium cable movies that I watch), I play the TV through my Bose Wave Radio, which has wonderful sound for a small room. However, just for listening to news or whatever, I use the set's speakers, which are much larger than the new model, and sound just fine in surround mode. I also like the fact that it has a stereo, mini plug, headphone jack, as I tend to be a late night person and don't want to disturb my neighbors.I had connected my standard DVD Player (but have since gotten a Sony Uploading DVD Player)and the picture looks wonderful. For my discs, I also play the sound through my Bose Wave, which has an additional Multimedia Pedestal, allowing me to connect the audio of 3 components, in my case TV, DVD and Laser Disc.  Given that I have a small bedroom with no real space for a stereo system with free standing speakers, the Bose Wave, which has a very small foot print, is an excellent compromise.I need to emphasize that this model is a far superior set to all the others that I looked at in 26\".My final words to you are: BUY IT!!!!!!!", "Date": "May 26, 2008"}, {"Title": "I LOVE my TV!!!!", "Author": "Mary M", "ReviewID": "R3RANKDN9QTWJ1", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I've been using my Sony Bravia for about two months and I LOVE it!

I was worried that the screen angle isn't adjustable, but it is great from any viewpoint.  I didn't hang it, so I can't say anything on that aspect.  I have a smaller size entertainment center and could only afford to get a new TV or a new stand (for an old TV that didn't work anymore...easy choice).  The 26\" seems small in the stores, but it really isn't that bad since the quality is so great.

HD channels look crisp. Auto-tune was easy. I didn't mess with the settings much. I sometimes flip the Light Sensor (I turn it on when using it as a monitor otherwise it is too bright). It has better resolution than the IBM X61 laptop I hook up to it. My Windows Vista desktop looks cool when it fills up the full 26-inch widescreen (I had to change one setting once to get the resolution set perfectly). Good sound as well - I rarely need to turn the volume above 33-35, and the max is 100.One of my buddies commented that he would be able to use this as a computer monitor from the couch, which is 8 or 9 feet away. Of course, that would strain the eyes after not too long, but the point is that a person with normal eyesight can read 12-point text on a 26-inch bravia screen from 9 feet away. That's pretty good, yes?The week after I got this in the mail (smooth and quick delivery; well-packed), I was at the MOMA (Museum of Modern Art) in New York. One of the floors had a section of video and computer graphic art. All the exhibits were using Sony Bravia TVs. I'm sure it was part of a sponsorship deal or something, but another way of looking at it is that a group of folks (i.e. professional video and graphic artists) that one can expect to be very concerned with picture quality selected this LCD TV.

I looked long and hard and did ALL my homework before purchasing.  I had learned that this is the \"upper\" level 26\" as opposed to the KDL26M3000 model.  M standing for \"mass market\"  (Wal*Mart, Sears et al.) which is the more commonly found model on the shelves.  All I can say is the picture is OUTSTANDING.  NO other make/model could compare.  My TV is connected to a Directv HD receiver via HDMI and the 720p/1080i picture is just pristine.  I find myself looking for HD programming when channel surfing because the HD picture is so good.  The sound is what you would expect from a small television, clear and adequate.  The cabinet is understated and does not have the \"glossy\" look frame that I find distracting on other sets.  The frame on this set does nothing but accent the picture on the widescreen without being flashy or reflecting any ambient lighting in the room.  Good call on Sony's part.As most other reviewers stated in previous reviews, this set costs a couple dollars more, but in the words of a famous somebody who's name presently escapes me...
