{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Great Value, Awesome Picture!", "Author": "K. Peterson", "ReviewID": "R3E13O68TD5AFC", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I bought the Samsung LN37A550 from Amazon in mid-May.  I comparison shopped for several months, and found that the Samsung is on equal footing as the Sony Bravia XBR-Series KDL-37XBR6 37-Inch 1080p LCD HDTV and Sharp Aquos LC37D64U 37-Inch 1080p LCD HDTV models in performance, but (at the time) was more affordable than either.  Here's an in-depth run-down of the top-of-the line models from each of those three brands using MY comparison criteria.  Hopefully it helps you.PriceThese are prices from Amazon.com (not their \"marketplace partners\" or whatever they're called).  I'd recommend purchasing from Amazon itself, as they offer the free \"white-glove\" delivery, which means that the delivery company will bring the TV into your house, unpack it, and haul away the packing materials.  My TV was delivered 3 days after I ordered it, and many others who reviewed on this site have had the same experience.Also, keep in mind Amazon's financing offers if you open an Amazon.com credit account - see below for more details.Samsung LN37A550: Retail is $1200.  I've watched Amazon's price fluctuate between $1040 and $1200.  Today the price is $1064, which is as good as I've seen.  In addition, Samsung TVs often have financing deals - mine was 1-year, no payments and no-interest financing, and I've also seen 18-month specials.Sharp LC37D64U: Retail is $1400, and the fact that it was selling for about $1350 a month ago strongly influenced my decision.  Today the price is $1016, which may have changed my purchase based solely on the size (Sharp is slightly narrower - see below - and the Samsung is a REALLY tight squeeze in my space).  I have not seen ANY financing deals on Sharp TVs through Amazon - pay it all up front.Sony KDL-37XBR6: Retail is $1500.  Today's price on Amazon is $1400 - a major consideration (about $350 price difference), but there's also a 36 (read it again, 36) month no interest offer on this TV right now.  Minimum monthly payments are required.Contrast Ratio, Response Time, and Frame Refresh RateKeep in mind that different manufacturers use different methods to measure these specifications, so they can not be simply compared using numbers.  All I can say is that I viewed them in a couple of different retail locations, and there is little difference in picture brightness / blurring between these models.  All are capable of 1080p picture.Samsung: 15,000:1 dynamic contrast ratio and 5 ms response time.  60 hZ refresh rate.Sharp: 10,000:1 dynamic contrast ratio and 6 ms response time. 60 hZ refresh rate.Sony: 25,000:1 dynamic contrast ratio and unpublished response time.  120 hZ refresh rate.  The refresh rate is where the Sony has an advantage over the others.  I'm not going to get into it here, but here's a great article from CircuitCity.com explaining refresh rate in clear, simple terms ([...]  All I'll say is that, in-store with a BluRay disc, the 120 hZ setting on a 46\" screen looked AWESOME.  Some have complained that it produces a \"soap-opera\" effect.  Not being a big fan of soap-operas, I have no idea what they are referring to.  Personally, I don't think it's enough of a reason to spend the extra $300+, because of screen size.  With a bigger 50\"+ screen, your eye will catch blurring across the screen, but on a screen of this size I have never noticed any blurring with my 60 hZ model.High-Def InputsThese all have the HD connections below, along with Digital Audio outputs, and other (S-video and composite video, and stereo audio) inputs.Samsung: 3 version 1.3 (latest) HDMI Inputs (2 in rear, 1 on side), 1 USB input (for viewing JPGs and listening to MP3s), 1 PC input, and 2 component video inputs.Sharp: 2 HDMI Inputs (Amazon and Sharp's website don't say they are version 1.3, which is supposedly faster and therefore better quality), 1 PC input, and 2 component video inputs.  Also has side inputs.Sony: 4 HDMI Inputs (3 in rear, 1 on side; again, Amazon and Sony don't say version 1.3, but I would think it's GOT to be..... don't know why they wouldn't publish this, though), 1 PC input, and 2 component video inputs.SoundMost reviews I have read complain about the Samsung's sound quality (most common in complaint is that the speakers sound \"tinny\").  I turned off the speakers before I ever hooked the TV up to an input (I've got a surround sound system), so I can't speak to this.  I bought the TV for the picture, not the sound, but if that's important to you, read other reviews.  I've read a couple of complaints about the Sharp model, but they didn't seem quite so angry as the complaints regarding Samsung, so I'm guessing it's acceptable sound.SizeSize can be a consideration for many in purchasing a TV of this size.  I was space constrained only in width.  If you've got space constraints and 37\" in width, you might also consider the Toshiba REGZA 40RF350U Super Narrow 40-Inch 1080p LCD HDTV Super Narrow Bezel, which measures just 36.77\" wide.  I have not seen it in action, so I can't speak to it's performance, but other Toshiba LCDs that I HAVE seen did not compare to these 3 TVs in picture quality.Samsung: 36.1 inches wide and 40 pounds with stand (32 pounds without)Sharp: 35 and 23/64\" wide (yes, some people really squeeze that tight) and 45 pounds with stand (39 without)Sony: 36.3 inches wide and 47 pounds with stand (40 without)WarrantyAll of these TVs have 1 year parts / 1 year labor manufacturer warranties.Additional features:Each brand offers their own graphics processing engine that claims to be the greatest thing ever, as well as other features.  One interesting feature which is really more of a marketing ploy is connecting other devices made by the same brand to this TV and just being able to use the TV's remote to control that device.  For example, buy a Sony TV and a Sony Blu-Ray player, and you can control the Blu-Ray player without reprogramming your remote.  Good if you don't want to buy a Universal Remote, but I see it more as a way to get you to buy more components from that brand.  Your choice!So there you have it.  I can say with a lot of certainty that you will be pleased with any of these three models, and it's more a matter of preference for a certain brand, pricing sensitivity, and the sound issue that you have to make up your mind.  As for me, I couldn't be happier with my Samsung purchase.", "Date": "June 5, 2008"}, {"Title": "My first HDTV experience....", "Author": "AntVector", "ReviewID": "R1M34WDA1P5MJN", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I've had this set for a little over a week, and I'm delighted with it so far.  This is the first HDTV I've owned, and in preparation for buying it I did a lot of research into the different technologies available.  My principle considerations were: A) A maximum size of 40\", as I only have a small viewing distance (and a wife who didn't want a 2-ton altar of gleaming black plastic in her living room) B) A set that was going to look great for movies and video games, and C) price - not more than $1,000.  The other major concern was having a fragile thing like this shipped, as I really didn't want to have to return it (at my cost) if there was a problem.  I'm happy to say my whole experience with this model has been excellent.In terms of the set design, it's pretty sleek and minimal.  It does have a glossy black bevel (I would have preferred matte) but overall it looks very nice and simple.  There is a side panel with the third of 3 HDMI connections, and the only composite jacks, all of which are hidden from the front.Currently I'm running Time Warner HD cable (720p-1080i) through component, and an Xbox 360, outputting at 1080p, also over component.  Both blew me away (this is my first HDTV after all), and I was especially taken with the 1080p signal from the 360 - rich blacks and vibrant colors, clear, lag-free images in fast games and really crisp details.  Compared to my previous TV, some games now have an almost overwhelming amount of detail!  Just for the record, I honestly can't speak to HDMI quality as I currently don't have the cables.  So far I've been very impressed with component connections.I calibrated the set using the THX optimizer that comes free with Finding Nemo DVD, and I'm happy with the results.  Even my wife, who claims to not usually notice the difference between TVs had the first reaction of \"Wow, that picture is amazing\", so you can't say fairer than that.There are plenty of different connections, including optical audio out, which is great.  I have to agree with other reviewers that the sound quality from the set itself is thin and tinny, but then again I listen to audio for movies etc. through my receiver.I honestly can't believe I'm getting these results for just over $1,000.  I did a fair amount of standing like a zombie in Best Buy, comparing sets, and other than the screen size a regular Joe like me has been hard pressed to spot much difference in $2,000+ TVs.A note on the shipping - I ordered through Amazon and received their White-Glove delivery, fulfilled by Ceva Logistics.  I ordered on a Friday evening - my TV arrived the following Tuesday - a week ahead of schedule.  The delivery person was 30 minutes EARLY, and patiently helped me test the set.  Your experience may vary, but I was thrilled.  A+ all round.", "Date": "May 12, 2008"}, {"Title": "Samsung LN37A550 lives up to expectations", "Author": "Marc O'Polo", "ReviewID": "R1FMFR2120PWMW", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I purchased the LN37A550 after reading a reviews for several LCD HDTVs and comparing them side-by-side, to the extent possible, in retail shops. I narrowed down my choices to Samsung and Sony; as far as I could tell from reviews and published specs, the sets were comparable. However, Sony was higher priced. I like the deep blacks and color saturation of the Samsung set. From the reviews, it appeared that 1080p doesn't offer any advantage over 720p in a 37\" set; nevertheless, I decided to buy the higher resolution set as a bit of insurance against future technology developments. (I purchased a 37\" set because of space limitations.) Installation was very easy; the on-screen plug-and-play process went seamlessly. The arrangement of the keys on the remote control differ from all the other remotes I own; nothing new here. The remote is not too intuitive, but it didn't take long to understand the various functions. The on-screen menu is easy to navigate. There are ample controls by which to vary picture and sound quality. I am disappointed with sound quality; to my ears it sounds somewhat tinny. The reviews said the Samsung sound was superior to competing sets. That may be true, but it's inferior compared to the set it replaces: a 27\" Toshiba CRT set. I suspect that smaller speakers are used in the Samsung set compared to the Toshiba set; bass seems to be particularly lacking despite my tweaking the equalizer settings. (I plan to buy external speakers.) Also, the Samsung website claims that the viewing angle is 178 degrees (89 degrees to one side or the other from the perpendicular to the screen). That's more or less true, but don't expect picture quality to be maintained. To my eyes, picture definition and color saturation deteriorate markedly when I move more than 45 degrees off the center line. A note about \"White Glove\" delivery service: It was flawless. Delivery was made two days ahead of the promised date; I was phoned ahead of time to arrange the approximate delivery time. In summary, this purchase has met my expectations.", "Date": "May 27, 2008"}, {"Title": "Very pleased so far", "Author": "Charlie", "ReviewID": "RWBRWVX5260L8", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I've had this TV for a couple weeks now, and it looks like Samsung really scores with this one. Great price and a stunning picture, with deep blacks, fast response and good off-angle viewing. And absolutely none of the backlight leakage or \"clouding\" problems that so many buyers report (correctly) with otherwise fine Sony models. The one complaint you're likely to see in reviews of this set is that the speakers sound thin, and that's a legitimate gripe.  My three-year-old Panasonic 32-inch sounds much better. So my rating is actually about 4.5, but the picture is so fine I'm willing to round up.  In my case, I plugged a set of Klipsch Groove powered speakers ($92 at Amazon) into the headphone jack, and problem solved. Many of you will have external sound systems anyway.  If you can afford the $500 difference, you might want to wait a few weeks till Panasonic's new high-end TC-37LZ800 comes out, but if you go with this Samsung I don't think it'll disappoint you.", "Date": "May 8, 2008"}, {"Title": "Samsung LN37A550", "Author": "Hal", "ReviewID": "R3DEJ23S8NWUD6", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Samsung LN37A550I have had the TV for approximately 1-month.  This TV was purchased with the intent of acquiring the \"best\" 37-inch LCD TV available with one exception.  I was not interested in 120 hertz refresh rate.  I am not interested in games or sports.  The TV is connected to a Direct TV high definition satellite receiver.  The picture looks great; however, when I looked at comparable models (e.g., Sharp and Toshiba) at a big box store, in a brand to brand comparison, I could not detect any significant difference in picture quality between the different brands in either high definition or standard definition program viewing.  Of course there was a tremendous difference when viewing high definition versus standard definition programs. (Unfortunately, I did not listen to sound which probably would have been impossible due to background noise but more on this later.)  I use the TV for satellite reception and DVD playback--no games.  The TV has a matte screen and absolutely no glare.  It is installed in a location where glare was a problem on a CRT screen.  In my assessment, the picture quality deserves a 5-star rating.All reviews indicate that the TV has \"plenty\" of inputs.  My advice is to determine the amount and type of inputs needed.  For instance, the TV has only one composite video input which is on the side panel.  I know, why would you need a composite video input on a HDTV?  In my case, some components, a couple of examples are my video camera and Pioneer receiver, require a composite input.  In most cases, the number of inputs is more than adequate but don't assume that there are plenty of inputs.Sound is a horrible disappointment.  Again, this was something that I didn't tryout before purchase because I thought anything would meet my sound requirements.  For movies, I use a surround sound system so the sound from the TV is irrelevant.  However, the TV is frequently used to receive weather and news information.  For this type of reception, I am not interested in \"quality\" sound but I do want to be able to hear and \"understand\" the audible portion of the broadcast without using a surround sound system.  With this set, this is almost impossible.  It has plenty of volume, no problem there, but the distortion, muting, echo, and tininess are unbelievable.  Yes, it has different sound settings and an equalizer, but the best that you can get is unacceptable by anyone's standards.  The sound from this set is far inferior to a single speaker 10-year old Philips CRT TV with a single BNC connector for sound and audio input.  I also had an occasion to be in a hospital after the set was delivered and the sound from the pendant for the hospital TV was far superior.  Let's put it this way, if I had paid $10.00 for a clock radio that sounded this bad I would return it.  Sound rating:  0-star.Overall, I am totally pleased with the picture quality, but if I had it to do over, I would purchase a different brand because of the absolutely horrible sound.I bought the TV via Amazon which was a pleasant buying experience.", "Date": "June 10, 2008"}, {"Title": "Failed in less than 3 weeks", "Author": "De Judge", "ReviewID": "R2PW1Z1C5GZ9DL", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "Quality control on the Samsung line is poorer than expected....My 37\" 1080p LCD functioned for a total of 2.5 weeks and then the screen went BLACK...A conversation with the hardly interested folks at Samsung Warranty Service -- really thrilled me when they said my TV was still in warranty --- OH JOY!They informed me that based on the flashing red power light - that the critical internal \"bulb\" had burned out and needed replacement....However -- they said that our \"local service\" facility would call me \"sometime\" after next Monday to schedule service....If this is the kind of quality or service you anticipate after purchasing a $1,000 TV --- be my guest...I've contacted Amazon to pursue the option of returning this LEMON for a full refund....I'll post again to pass on the status...-----------------------------------------------------------------Oct. 08, 2008Bingo!

You will have to make sure that you grasp the interconnectedness of the various modes and picture adjustments so as to get the very best out of whatever you are playing through it. Well transferred DVDs, with a good upscaling 1080p DVD player, will look stunning. Mediocre DVDs will look at least much better than you thought possible.Standard definition cable TV through the RF antenna input looks amazingly good, all things considered, if you take the time to tweak the display profiles to accommodate the very limited, narrow bandwidth palettes of those sources.That said, it's a real stunner with a good 1080p player. There is a noticeable quality difference between 1080i component video and 1080i or 1080p HDMI video. You should try and use the HDMI inputs whenever possible.Samsung claims that the set has an almost 180 degree viewing range. If by that they mean that you can stand at extreme angles and still see a useable picture, that is correct. But if you assume that means that it will be as good as a plasma, or old style CRT, which has almost no loss at all at the most extreme angles, you will be disappointed. Although LCD manufacturers have made great strides in extending the viewable angle for LCDs, they are LCDs, not plasmas or CRTs. This set still has a noticeable \"sweet spot\" were the picture looks the very best. Standing up, or moving off the to side produces a noticeable loss of contrast.The difference is slight, but noticeable. It's no where near as bad as earlier sets.But there is a sweet spot. Viewing in bright environments where the contrast and lamp level of the set have been cranked up to compete with the ambient brightness will probably mask this effect. Viewing in subdued to dim lighting environments, like you would want for watching films, with the set adjusted to output subtle tones and the very best movie quality image, tends to call attention to it. That said, the set has robust but very subtle color and excellent blacks and contrast range if properly adjusted.If anyone had suggested three years ago that you would be able to get this level of technology and sophistication at about one-thousand dollars, no one would have believed it possible.It is a great set.", "Date": "July 28, 2008"}, {"Title": "AWESOME TV!", "Author": "Kathie S.

But another three hours and it was there again. This occurred repeatedly. We called Samsung (easily reached and responsive.)They said the problem was not familiar to them, but they sent a tech (a week later after two slips in scheduling). The tech skillfully replaced the screen and the master control panel (he said they are new, not reconditioned), leaving us with a new TV except for the plastic case and the power supply. Actually, it may be newer now than it was when we got it, as the tech said many of the screws were stripped (we watched as he pulled them -- he did not strip them) and that it appeared to have been serviced previously. He questioned whether it might be a demo/floor model or a reconditioned instrument.We are pleased with the post-repair picture quality.

Between being picky and also not having a lot of cash flow(College student) I kept looking and looking.  Finally after narrowing down my size down to a 37, and my price around $1000, I found this gem.  The picture on this television is fantastic and for several functions.  I play my Xbox 360 on it, and the picture looks as sharp as ever and there is little to no blur, (Gears of War 2 is crystal clear. Some games arent rendered very high, but the picture still looks great).  I also watch DVDs on it a lot, and they look great too, unfortunately my DVD player is pretty basic and doesnt put out the best colors.  When I see content in true HD, this television shows just how well it can perform.  The blacks are very black and other other colors are bright and sharp.  The only down side to this television would be the slight motion blur, and I mean slight.

The visuals in full HD are stunning.

Not on Amazon.com or any other sites. I looked at it specs, it was all I needed and more. Samsung is one of the best LCD TV manufacturers these days and quality is out of the question.As soon as I got this TV up and runnin', man the difference between its picture and my 11-year-old LG Flatron TV was HUGE!! I was amazed how in the world I managed to play PS3 on a SD TV. Playing my games again on this great HDTV was like playing them for the 1st time in every sense of the word. The contrast is stunning, the blacks are deep and the color production is more than satisfying. Even in fast moving scenes, the 5 ms response time makes it really ghost free and lag free.As mentioned in other reviews, the sound is somehow on the weak side. The bass is not that powerfull (even with equalizer setting). The sound isn't that rich but it's not bad, it only could have been better. However, connecting a home theatre is the obvious way to go and that's my next plan (lol).The build quality is great, and it feels well built and sturdy. The remote takes a little while to get used but it's no big deal at all. The only takes I've got on this TV are one: the remote control reception is somehow weak a little and it should be facing the IR sensor on the TV (already mentioned by another review here) two: the remote buttons needs a little push to respond, you have to press a little hard for them to respond and finally: the rear connections plate feels a little loose somehow, when I connect an HDMI for example, part of the panel goes inside the set, just be careful not pushing too hard when plugging cables on the back panel.Overall, it's a great great HDTV set and surpassed my expectations and I'm very pleased with it.

There is no banding, blooming, distortion, or pixallated edges.  Samsung makes a high quality product that is frequently better than many of the higher priced products from their competitors.I've seen a few reviewers complaining about a few things, here is my input on their issues as someone who is not only an A/V enthusiast for over 20 years, but also an IT technician:Check for firmware updates, my S@NY BDP-350 Blu-Ray player (purchased in Dec) has had 3 Firmware updates for it so far.  One of them solved an HDMI issue.As with anything else in this world, it is possible to get a bad unit & this is true of ALL manufacturers (even S@NY).  Electronics today are all produced by the lowest bidder.  You can buy a TV today, and 3 months later I can buy the exact same model, and if we compare the internal parts, there will be differences... whatever chips were cheapest when they placed the parts order are what go into your set, and it is assembled in a factory by human beings being paid peanuts.Picture quality:  The source makes a huge difference.  I switched from Cablevision to FiOs & the difference in picture quality is stunning (on both the standard & HD channels).  I have not run satellite, so cannot comment on the quality of that source.Audio quality:  For the life of me, I can't determine why someone would be using the internal speakers on this TV.  Why you would have an almost 40\" TV and not run it through an audio system is beyond me...Picture blacking out:  This has A LOT to do with the HDMI outputs on the cheaply made set-top boxes that are used to receive Satellite/Cable/FiOs. They ALL have HDMI issues, and the issues will cause problems whether the box is turned on or off.  Complain to you service provider, not Samsung.  If you want to test this, unplug the HDMI running from your box to the TV & run component video at 720p instead (there will not be a discernable difference in picture quality on a TV of this size when running broadcast content).  Then power off both the box & TV, and UNPLUG THEM FROM THE WALL as well, as todays equipment will never truly 'power off' (or else your remote couldn't turn it on).  Wait 2-3 minutes, then plug the power back in.  If your issues go away, then you can be 100% sure it is the set-top box & not your TV causing your woes.AnyNet+ issues: These are software issues, and HDMI issues.  Most likely, the culprit is one of your other devices and not the TV.

Make no mistake: this is a great product.  But don't expect it to work like the sets on display in the Big Box stores.  The reason is that the stores often have their own company made videos on display.  They almost invariably emphasize jarring action shots, bright colors against white or blue backgrounds, and often have panoramic views of vast landscapes or colorful flowers.  As one of the Big Box clerks told me: you will get this same picture at home if you play a Blue Ray disc on a quality Blue Ray DVD with a jacked up 120MHz version of your TV set.  But, heh, most of us by a telly set to watch cable tv.As for Amazon's promise that they will set up your set and carry away the debris, that is legit.  Two men carefully unpacked the set and had it up and running in about seven minutes.  But language was a problem, since one person could speak no english and the other was only marignally better.  They also neglected to tell me that I had to use both remotes (one for the TV, the other for the cable box) to control the set, something that caused me great anxiety until I figured it out. Incidentally, it is possible to use only one remote, if you hook up the cable directly into the new TV, or if you turn in your Standard Definition cable box for a new HD cable box. And while they offered to carry away the rubbish, they told me I should keep the box and the packing materials in case I had to return the set.  Fair enough, this was a sensible suggestion.As for the set itself, it is great.  In almost every respect it performs as outlined in the reviews of this product. On HD channels, it offers wonderful color,sharp contrasts, and an almost three dimensional experience.  As for the sound, it is, as most reviewers have pointed out, god awful.  It sounds \"tinny\" and lacking substance, and almost certainly I will have to improve it by a sound bar or modestly priced home theatre sound system.  One of the great features is the remote, which is user friendly, and one of its best function is the picture-size button.  One of the flaws of most HDTVs is that when they show a Standard Definition program on cable, the people and items depicted appear \"squat,\" with people looking like fireplugs and Volkswagens looking like stretch limosines.  But you can immediately get rid of this phenomena by changing from the usual 16:9 ratio to either a Zoom 1 or 4:3 ratio.  (Sounds complicated, but is easy to learn and do in reality).So, in general, it is a pleasant and easy experience dealing with Amazon, which delivers on on its promises.  And the Samsung 37in 1080 HDTV is an excellent product, but just accept that you are unlikely to see the same quality of picture that are on the specially designed videos on display at the Big Box stores.

Right from first view my wife fell in love with the picture: to her it just seemed brighter and clearer than all the rest.  After much comparison to the competition I would have to say I agree with her.  The picture is very bright and clear.As far as 1080p vs. 720p some are of the opinion that you can't tell the difference with this screen size.  I personally COULD tell the difference: even if it is primarily at close range.  Well, every little bit helps so 1080p was the way to go for me, but is Samsung really any better than the rest?Perhaps not better than some, exactly, but it had the right combination of picture quality, features, and price that seemed to set it apart.  I initially bought a Sony (can I mention other brands?) M-series because I was able to get over $450 dollars off the store's regular price.  Not a bad deal by any stretch of the imagination, but when I got it home I hated it and had to return it.  Its SD performance was execrable, there was just no other word for it (all right, maybe \"wretched\" could be used as well):  Very noisy and highly posterized (a slight level of these attributes was even visible from some HD sources).  Of course, many reviews say that ALL HDTVs have poor SD quality, but the Samsung is actually very good in this respect.  And since my cable company's HD offerings are a bit light right now, this was important to me.  Of course, you can't squeeze blood from a turnip, and there is no mistaking SD for HD, but it is still eminently watchable on the Samsung.A couple of other pros that I appreciate on this unit are: loads of picture setting options (but to me the picture is great even right out of the box), a USB input for viewing pics from my digital camera and/or listening to mp3s (but why would you want to with that lousy sound? - more on this in a moment), and 3 (count-em) HDMI ports, one conveniently side-mounted for easy access, which in concert with the swivel base makes quick work of plugging in my HD camcorder.So have we stumbled upon HDTV Nirvana here?  Not exactly.  As many have pointed out, the sound quality is somewhat sub-par, and even serious tweaking of the equalizer settings can't improve it to any great degree when using the built-in speakers.  Not a deal-breaker for me, I could always listen through a stereo if I want to.  A nitpicky little annoyance is the glossy base, which attracts (and shows) dust like nobody's business: we'll live with it.  The important stuff is well-implemented as far as I am concerned.

I have had the TV for nine months and it has delighted me in every respect. I paced the aisles at stores comparing screens and concluded that the Samsung displays deserve their high recommendations. I still believe that.One of the features that seemed like a big plus before I made the purchase was the TV's User Guide. I downloaded it, studied it, and asked myself: \"Does this manual contain clear, well-written explanations of ALL of the TV's features and functions? Does it have enough diagrams and illustrations that I am unlikely to have to call customer service, or give up on finding an answer or fixing a problem?\" In some ways, the manual sold the TV. Not only did it tell me a great deal about the TV's features and operation, but it reassured me that I would be able to get the most out of it. I compared it with manuals for equivalent models from other manufacturers and, in my view, the Samsung manual was the best written and organized.Thanks to the manual, as soon as I got the TV, I had no trouble exploring the device and setting up everything to suit my tastes. The onscreen menus, while necessarily somewhat complex given the level of control Samsung gives the user, are set up well and it doesn't take long before the user can navigate them easily.But in the end, a TV is all about the picture. Every time I watch something, whether TV or DVD, it's great. For anyone using over-the-air signals, the TV gets the most out of the digital conversion. One of the remote's buttons makes it easy to toggle between picture formats/sizes, allowing the user to get the most out the screen area.I have no comments on the speakers' sound quality because I always listen with wireless headphones (a great way for an apartment dweller to get great sound quality and never, ever disturb a neighbor).", "Date": "September 13, 2009"}, {"Title": "Refurbished Samsung LN37A550 37-Inch 1080p LCD HDTV  Review", "Author": "A.

For this Samsung TV, the picture and clarity are impressive.  It was easy to hook up within minutes.  It is very light weight, which will make it easy to transfer from my bedroom to the patio for sporting events, etc.  Overall, I have been pleasantly surprised and pleased with the service and product quality of this TV sold by Amazon inc.", "Date": "April 2, 2009"}, {"Title": "great product, wonderful service", "Author": "S.

I was surprised at the small amount of packing material that surrounded the TV when I unpacked it.The TV arrived still set in the \"SHOP\" mode with all sections at their maximum settings.

Without it to get me in the \"ballpark\", It probably would have took an hour longer to get it right.  I am disappointed with the AUTOSOUND option which states it controls volume at a standard level.  This feature is useless when it comes to commericals that literally turn up the volume automatically.  The surround sound feature does work reasonably well.

I was a bit disappointed,  particularly when hooked up to the PC input with the out of box settings.  dull and somewhat muddle looking color.  However,  a quick adjustment to brightness contrast and color profiles quickly solved this.  HDMI by contrast was WAY to bright and sharp on factory settings when hooked up to the PC. (I have not tested this on any bluray players,  as I currently use it as a screen for my HTPC.)  I had to turn the sharpness down all the way,  it just does not work well with PC text and 3d gaming,  and brought out too much artifacts in Xvid and mpeg4 encoded media files.

It also supports the CEC protocol, which can simplify integration with other CEC-compatible products such as home theater systems and DVD players.

Davis \"famousdavis\"", "ReviewID": "R2KERG4AY2PGLG", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Background:Bought a new LCD TV to watch the Olympics in high-definition.  I thought I would buy locally, but I wound up using Amazon instead, mostly because the exact make/model wasn't easily found where I live.  I looked closely at all the affordable makes (eg, not Sony or Panasonic, but Toshiba, Samsung, Vizio, LG, Sharp, etc.).  I also looked at Consumer Reports to get reliability reports, and decided to not buy an extended warranty as a result (LCD TVs are very reliable).  My brother bought a Toshiba TV and really likes it.  I thought even the Vizio TVs looked good.I ultimately chose this particular Samsung model on the strength of my affection for their cell phones and for the very good reviews overall, particular for this particular TV.  I needed a TV that would fit my entertainment armoire, meaning either a 32\" or 37\" (I'm very glad I chose the 37\" now that I've got it).Positives:The picture really is outstanding, period.  By that I mean that, right out of the box, without doing anything except tuning to a digital TV channel, the resulting picture is gorgeous.  Flesh tones are natural.  Colors are vivid.  The whites are WHITE and the blacks are deep ebony.  And I didn't touch any of the oodles of control settings that are available (if you are a tinkerer, you'll leave all the settings you can tweak...I just wanted something that looked great without any fuss).  I like the side jacks to make hooking things up easy.  I only use a digital broadcast TV and DVDs -- no cable or satellite -- and both broadcast TV and the DVDs look great.The remote control is long and slender -- not particularly noteworthy except is can be illuminated if you want (not a big deal for me).  It's much more than what I'm used to.I haven't used the feature yet, but I like that it's got a USB port -- it'll make showing photos really easy in the future.  It also provides an easy way to update the TV's firmware in the future.Negatives:If you've read any reviews on this set at all, you'll read that the audio is unimpressive, even disappointing.  Mind you, the speakers aren't in front of the set -- I'm not sure where they are, actually -- and the sound that comes out is really inadequate to the picture.  Even using the equalizer function, the sound is not rich or inviting at all.  So, sound is the weak link for this TV.  However, I've hooked my TV up to my stereo, so for movie watching, I'm not using the TV speakers.  For watching TV news or a lot of other shows -- even the Olympics -- the TV sound is adequate, just not great.  But you already know that by now.One other thing I don't like is that, when hooked into my stereo, the Mute button on the remote doesn't mute the sound.  That wouldn't be a problem if my stereo had a remote with a mute button on it, but I've got an older Yamaha receiver without a remote.  So, it's a drawback for me, maybe not for you.Oh, and I was thrown for a loop by the product dimensions -- the published dimensions don't include the TV base!  I estimated a space for the TV that would be less than 24\", but with the stand, it's more than 24\"!  Beware!In sum, if they had added a nicer, beefer speaker system built-in, it'd be a 5-star product.  If you've got a home theater set-up, this is a 5-star TV, hands-down.  If you're going to use the built-in speakers, however, it's only a 4-star product.  Go to a local electronics dealer and be sure to test out the sound on the TV you want to buy.

I could not wait to gets my hands on this beauty as I read some great reviews on this unit. I have had a 40' Panasonic 40LC12 RPTV for over 3 years and I bought this unit as a replacement. However when the product arrived my first impression was, there is such a thing called 'too small'! This TV is a bedroom TV at best, not definitely a living room TV that you can enjoy watching football. Here are the pros and cons of this unit:Cons:* Anynet+ (which was an important factor for choosing this model) does not work very well. I have a HT-TZ515T home theater that is supposed to work great with this unit. To my disappointment, the anynet+ feature doesn't synchronize very well. When the TV is turned ON, the home theater would shut-down automatically. If you force the HT system ON, it disconnects the rear-wireless unit and you get a error message. Customer service told me that anynet+ is not a tested feature and is not guaranteed to work* 60Hz: This TV takes about 40 seconds for switching back and forth between a SD and a HD signal.* Incoherent SD-HD Transition: The LN37A550 gets stuck at either 480p or 1080i. So if you are watching a HD channel and you switch to a SD then you are stuck with 1080i resolution. You have to live with the 'bands' on the L & R of the screen. The manual says the bands can cause burn-in and is not covered under warranty. You have to turn the TV off and ON to restore full-screen 480p functionality. The simplest solution is to call your cable company to fix this problem. It is much easier to take care of this problem with the cable box* Remote: Basic functions such as input selection, screen display size (wide-screen, just-fit etc) are hidden within the menus. Non-tech savvy users will find it extremely hard to maneuver and change these supposedly simple tasks. For example, you need to push the remote 7 times to change the display setting. What was Samsung thinking?* SD Picture: The LN37A550 does a mediocre job in displaying SD signals on wide-screen. My Panasonic RPTV was fairly smooth compared to this TV.* No Memory Card Reader: Are you kidding me? For a TV priced at $1200, who forgot to put a memory card reader on?* Price: This TV is pretty pricey for the performance and specificationsPros:* Picture Quality: Bright,colorful, gorgeous display with HD content. My RPTV would not even come close to this beauty. This is the only reason why I would not return this unit.* Style* Frame comes pre-installed* Light weight* Low power consumptionSummary:If I have to do it all over again, I would get a Panasonic 42' 1080p plasma TV that you can find on sale for roughly $800. If you want this TV for your living room, it is a baaad idea. The screen size is way too small. It looks like a 32' TV. I regret not getting the 40' model (costs $300 more).

My one complaint is the \"tinny sound\", I adjusted the \"equalizer\" settings making the sound more acceptable.  We are delighted with picture quality, especially football games in hd.  The factory settings are OK but there is a review where a customer listed his settings that were very helpful.

The rep finally got out to fix the set and he had to order a whole new circuit board so that took another 2 weeks.The black colors on the picture are truly awful and blotchy. And forget the sound quality, terrible. There's not much to like about this TV and it's been a bad experience with Samsung.

Jones", "ReviewID": "R1U8VKZ3WEL956", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "So far, (2 days since the TV and Dish HD installation) the TV is amazing.  Lots to figure out.  Just wonder if we really have it working to its ultimate capacity??? (See below)  I rate the TV a 5-star, but the White Glove service gets a 0-star since we didn't get White Glove service.We are senior citizens, living in a rural area, approximately 100 miles from the nearest metropolitan city.  For this reason, and because of our lack of knowledge of this new age technology (I can do computers-not TVs), I ordered the Samsung LN37550 from Amazon.com as much for the White Glove delivery and installation service that I had been reading about in the other customer comments, as for the TV itself (size constraints drove our decision for the Samsumg).  However, we were sorely dissappointed in the definition of White Glove service in our area.A young man brought the TV into the house, took only the top off of the box, put the batteries in the remote, asked where the nearest wall socket was, pushed the TV in the box toward the socket, plugged it in, and with the TV still in the box, powered on the set.  Then he asked us to sign that the TV powered on and to accept delivery, and he prepared to leave, all happening very quickly.  When I told him we expected him to set the TV up, he made it clear that he was just the delivery guy, that he was not technical.  We called the only number we had (we got it off of our caller ID), which was the delivery service number, and were told essentially the same thing by the person there.Being between a rock and a hard place because the TV had already been charged to our credit card, and it was after 5:00pm, we opted to keep the set and try to call Amazon to get our White Glove service.  After all, the delivery receipt said 'White Glove!'  I spoke with the Amazon help desk the next morning, and was given a new telephone number, which was for CEVA, not the company that delivered the TV.  I called CEVA the second day after taking delivery of the set and asked when someone was coming to set up the TV.  It's 2 days later now, and I'm still waiting for someone from CEVA to call me back.Bottom-line:  Expectations were not met with regard to the White Glove service.  However, after much anxiety, some of it for naught, and much reading of the manual, we got the Samsung put in our console, all the plugs inserted in the back in the correct plugins (we think!), and the TV turned on in order to watch what we wanted, and be prepared for the Dish folks to do their bit to get our HD service connected.If I had it to do all over again, I would just go to a store front and pay a little extra to ensure that a technician comes out to install and explain things to us. As it is now, we've got everything but the DVD working, and I guess we'll have to prevail upon our son-in-law to help with that, and to explain to us what it is we don't know, and don't know to ask, about using all of this new technology.Oh, and based on the price I paid verses the price that the set is now, I paid about $45 more, and didn't get anywhere near the service from Amazon or it's contractors like other buyers; AND the set is advertized to have PIP, but our set DOES NOT, but who am I to call for remediation???  Forget it!!!  I've learned a valuable lesson.  I'll think twice before ordering this sort of product and service again from Amazon or any other online retailer.", "Date": "September 8, 2008"}, {"Title": "Great LCD TV", "Author": "Alex", "ReviewID": "R2YGRC64U2TX4V", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This is an excellent LCD TV.

We recently purchased the Samsung LN37A550 as well as the Samsung Blue Ray player. When watching movies the TV would loose video, only sound would remain. After checking the Samsung website we find there a major firmware update required before the player will even function properly.Samsung support, somewhere in the Philippines said they could only send us a disk and would take 7 days.We found and download the firmware patch from the website, installed it using a flash drive, to no avail.We took it back and traded it for the new Sony Blue Ray player. Still the same problem with the video. First time a movie will last 30 minutes then the screen goes black and you would have to turn the TV off and on then it would work another few minutes and same thing.Long story short, repair man finally came out and main circuit board on TV had to be replaced.Morale of the story is two Samsung products, both shipped prematurely with non functioning firmware and or bad components. Retailers are pushing this brand heavy so there must be relatively high profit margins for them as they push these substandard products out the door. Buyers beware.As good as some reviews are about the picture, etc. you are taking a big gamble with this brand and be prepared to trouble shoot and install regular fixes and patches on your own.I see the price of this TV has dropped over $200 in the last 30 days so they must be coming back to the retailers in droves.", "Date": "September 3, 2008"}, {"Title": "LOVE MY LCD", "Author": "ROBERT DEJOHN \"FLPOPPY\"", "ReviewID": "R1J6ZSAR8VOMOZ", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "THE QUALITY OF MY SAMSUNG 37\" LCD IS EXCELLENT.PICTURE IS AS GOOD AS HD WITHOUT THE CABLE UPGRADE.", "Date": "October 14, 2008"}, {"Title": "Great buy", "Author": "Stanley W.
