For images that are well-lit (sporting events, daytime scenes), the picture is very clear, and the setup was easy.  Noticeable improvement to the original digital TVs 5-6 years ago.Until we started watching a few movies with some nighttime scenes - could hardly see anything on the TV screen.  We adjusted the basic controls (brightness, contrast, backlighting, etc), but all that did was deeply distort the color of the images, and still left it extremely dark, almost too difficult to see what was happening.We plan to try other TVs and take this one back.  For the $$, not a bad bargain if primarily for video games or sports, but believe we can find better quality for similar price.", "Date": "October 20, 2012"}, {"Title": "Alright for its price", "Author": "Nick", "ReviewID": "R366U74W7T5SMH", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I bought this tv at best buy a few weeks ago and have had no serious issues with it.  It is not expensive so I did not have huge expectations from it, but I have had my computer hooked up to it and also my xbox hooked up to it and it has worked great.  I do not have HD tv where I have this tv setup so I am not sure how great the picture is there, but for movies and games this has been great.", "Date": "December 2, 2012"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "Unavailable", "Features": "flat screen", "Name": "InsigniaTM - 32\" Class / LCD / 720p / 60hz / Hdtv", "ImgURL": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41a%2B4VstO5L._SX300_.jpg", "ProductID": "B008GAQZ9Q"}}
