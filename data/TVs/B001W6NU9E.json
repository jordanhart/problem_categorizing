{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Makes me feel I made the right choice.", "Author": "S. Bae", "ReviewID": "R1ICJ79WP7MD60", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "If you're in the market for a HDTV then the Samsung PN50B650 is worth a second look.  Externally, the attractive Touch of Color design incorporated into the clear beveled edged glass exudes sophistication and class.  Internally, the Crystal Full HD Engine and Samsung's e-panel technology translates into a blur free clear vibrant picture perfect for sports and movies alike.Truthfully I started off in the HDTV market looking for a 52\" LCD panel with 1080p and 120hz specs.  After a month of searching I realized that a name brand set with the above specs was out of my budget.  I wasn't considering a plasma because I thought it was outdated technology, fear of image retention (IR), cost of operation, and plasma's heavier weight difference.  However, as I researched more into plasmas I learned that my fears were they themselves outdated.  Plasma was not outdated technology, many companies were still pouring money into plasma R&D.; IR for sure is still a concern but with some simple basic precautions and use of the built in pixel shifting option, IR has become a very minor concern.  This set is also Energy Star compliant using 40% less power than prior years plasmas (as per Samsung's website) and comparable to LCDs of similar size.  As for weight, I wasn't too concerned because my set wasn't going on a wall.  Regardless, the weight difference to a LCD is only about 15 lbs or so.  Also, this set comes with an attractive stand that allows the TV to rotate for optimal viewing.The cons I have so far are:  Even with the FilterBright technology incorporated into the screen, glare is still a factor.  I have my set in a room with no curtains but no direct sunlight and find myself changing the brightness control at times during daylight use.  While the Media 2.0 is a fantastic feature (and the reason why I highly recommend this set over the B550 for a few extra $) it can be slow at times.  Lastly, the speakers on this TV are marginal.  Not bad in loudness but definitely no mid range or bass as one would expect. You will eventually need something externally powered.I will not bore you with pros and cons of this set's internal specs, you can interpret them anyway you want but for a non HDTV expert that was merely trying to get the best value for the money, with great picture quality and technology (e.g. Cinema Smooth 24p frame rate), in an attractive looking TV, this Samsung was a clear choice for me.  Lastly, the other plasma I was considering was the Panasonic G10.  It has slightly better reviews but esthetically IMO the Samsung was a clear winner.  For the non HDTV expert like myself, the image quality differences were unnoticeable.  On a side note, as the post above had mentioned, standard def cable channels are pretty darn good on this set compared to my old 37\" LCD.*I do not have the buzz or the pinkish hues some others claim on their sets.Update:  After 7 months of use, my Samsung tv is is still going strong with no issues.  Picture quality is still bright and vivid.  I have either found the most balanced setting for day and night time use or my eyes have gotten used to this set because I longer find myself adjusting the picture settings.  Burn in is not an issue and its not even on my mind (although I do not play video games on it).  Its great having a tv with online capabilities.  While I don't personally find myself using the \"widgets\" very often, I do appreciate the no hassle automatic software updates to the tv.  The two widgets I do use on occasion are the Amazon Video on Demand and the Blockbuster Video on Demand.  Either of these two features allow one to watch HD or regular quality movies streamed from their respective providers at about $3-$5 a movie for a 24 hr rental period.  Not bad when I don't want to drive to the rental store.  Other noteable widgets available are Twitter, YouTube, Ebay and flickr. The tv's speakers are adequate for everyday use but for movies and sporting events an externally powered speakers are advised.  I use a Sony sound bar that looks and sounds great with this set.  My electric bill has increased about $10 per month.  The set is on for 10 plus hours a day.", "Date": "July 12, 2009"}, {"Title": "Highly recommended!", "Author": "Eternyl \"Drew\"", "ReviewID": "R36U5Z8CYK4ZDA", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Basically I've had this TV for about 3 weeks already, and wanted to share since when researching this new 2009 Samsung PN50B650 set, there were limited reviews.the specs and price on this had me at hello...3,000,000:1 Mega Contrast0.001ms pixel-response time.600HzCinema Smooth4 HDMI portsTuners: ATSC / NTSC / QAMENERGY STAR qualifiedAnynetDLNAFirst off I was always sketchy on Plasma...because of course burn in, and the whole LCD rage taking off.Basically it was a \"burn in\" vs \"dead pixel\" face off.But burn in is a non issue...sometimes the History channel will leave its logo for a few seconds, but it's not even noticeable unless you try to find it. I play PS3 games on it and it's perfect.The 4 HDMI ports are priceless....I thought it would be overkill...but add in a TivoHD, PS3, Receiver...and I'm down to 1 side HDMI input left...The 650 also has the extra internet USB adapter ($75) is very nice as well....connecting to Flickr, your network & Yahoo Weather is very nice.not built in but, so what.The TV speakers are basic and tolerable I guess, but if you are looking to get a 50\" plasma, I would hope you would have a home theater in a box at least.The TOC finish is very very nice, and the touch of color really makes this set stand out...I thought I'd hate it but once it's in the house...it is nice.I think the main reason to really look at this set is the \"Cinema Smooth\" feature which is present on this panel....and I think only until you get to the 850 model you won't see it available. This is very nice since it delivers in the native 24p content, same frame rate as movies are recorded.and I don't have any buzzing, which some people were reporting on the AVS Forum.Well compared to my Samsung 40 40A650 LCD 120hz, which I really liked...this Plasma is a big step up.In the store the bright lights and the demo modes make the LCD stand out...but in my home setting....holy bright...it was always in movie mode...so now the kids can play games on it in, the plasma is for the living room now.The blacks and whites are more lifelike on the Plasma...although the LCD has way whiter whites...it just make it look too digital.basically I have a much better viewing angle...pic looks perfect from all angles....and it looks more \"real life quality\"..if that makes sense.basically I still can't get used to the \"3D Soap Opera effect\" on the LCD, and the speed is still nowhere to the plasma especially in sports...even with the 120hz I could catch the blur in a football.Here's my deal sealer....standard def channels, are pretty good...I can watch them again. On the LCD...standard Def..I preferred to watch an old Toshiba 36\" CRT in the loft if I had to.granted it's not an 850 or 950....but the price difference is huge.at this cheap of a price, I'm thinking about getting a second...seriously it's a steal.", "Date": "June 24, 2009"}, {"Title": "very happy", "Author": "active user \"active user\"", "ReviewID": "R3D7CPEQVA4HQD", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This review is my personal opinion and is not sponsored by anyone.After a good amount of research I decided to get Samsung PN50B650.

I loved the swivel stand. however, i like my panasonic g10 plasma much better, and here's why:1) image retention, seriously, is almost a non issue. only very rarely do you see images retained on the screen, and if you do, if you watch a movie or use the IR scrolling bar, it disappears quickly.2) blacks are outstanding. i thought they were good on the samsung, but in all honesty, it doesnt compare.that being said, there are some issues with the panasonic, being:1) its a bit dark for my tastes, the samsung was brighter. this is really a non-issue if you are watching movies /  playing games in dark rooms.2) the stand does not swivel, though its easy to move the base3) there are no USB ports, so it limits the amount of content that can be streamed (only pictures and videos through the SD card)4) the infrared receiver (for remote control) is squarely in the middle of the TV. i place my front speaker there so it was a bit of an issue for me.5) there are very few picture controls - i cant turn the screen brighter even if i want to!6) only 3 hdmi... not an issue now i supposeits also worth mentioning that im no longer trying to stream content through the TV. i got a ps3 and got ps3media server. works like a charm; highly recommended.one other thing i'll say is that amazon's prices, delivery, and customer service is top notch. i recommend you keep an eye on prices for a few days to see if it goes up or down. there are also random coupons floating around if you do a google search or review the price discussions here at amazon. as of mod nov 09, a good price for the pnb650 would be around $1200 and the g10 around the same. I was able to score the g10 and a panasonic plasma for $1100 - you should hope for a similar deal to return!white glove delivery through ceva was top notch. customer service in returning the old TV was painless. amazon is the place to buy TVs, no matter which model you choose.hope this helps.navin", "Date": "November 18, 2009"}, {"Title": "Buzz central", "Author": "Clayton Chroust \"Electronics Junkie\"", "ReviewID": "R21SV4DM02XJ0R", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "For starters, The picture quality on this set is fantastic, and the sound is sufficient for casual normal use. Additionally, the features and menus are rich and online content although sluggish is pretty cool. I am being slightly generous giving this set 3 out of 5 starts, when it should be a 1 or a 2. However, as with all TVs a home theater system should be used to provide the theater like experience. My main problem with this set is the buzzing. I have owned 2 Panasonic Plasma TVs and neither of them buzzed as loud as this one does. The only buzzing that can be heard from those sets were during setting up various cables and actually being behind the set. But as it seems all or nearly all 2009 Samsung B series plasma TVs have this buzzing issue. Samsung tech showed up to tell it was normal and I showed him the other plasma TVs in the house and NO SUCH BUZZ came from those sets. Instead of going through the nightmare of Samsung's tech support (it has gone down hill since it out sourced its support a few years back), I have decided to return the set and will go for either a LCD or an LED alternative.For all you buyers contemplating this set as an option, if you can deal with the buzzing, which is clearly audible with the TVs volume 20 and below then by all means purchase this set. However, If Plasma is your craving I suggest you go with Panasonic for 2009, perhaps in 2010 (April/May when most of the new tech is unveiled) Samsung will have better quality control and fix the problems with their plasmas.Pros:PQ both HD and SDConnectivity and easy of use playing movies, music, etc...ControllerNeutral:Sound (no biggie anyone can buy a surround sound system if needed)Cons:BUZZING!!! It was not noticeable within the first hour or 2 of use but as the image gets brighter (movies, tv, Blu-Ray) the buzzing increases. Samsung tech from Pauls TV claimed nothing was wrong and this was normal. Just google Samsung B series buzzing and you will find out all that you need.My suggestion go with the B750 series, it is feature packed and comes in various sizes and from what I have seen as excellent picture quality. The Samsung LED tvs may also be a viable alternative.", "Date": "September 19, 2009"}, {"Title": "GREAT TV!!!!! - BEST TIME TO BUY - NO BUZZING - TWEEK SETTINGS", "Author": "Ann K.

I just missed out on the free Blu-Ray DVD player.BUZZING PROBLEM - I just received my TV a few days ago and there is absolutely no buzzing, which was my main concern about this purchase. I ordered the TV on 27 Sept 2009 and the firmware loaded on the the TV was dated July 2009 (version 1011). Amazon had just restocked this TV before I ordered it. I waited to order as the newer versions of this TV don't seem to suffer from the buzzing problem.WHITE GLOVE DELIVERY - If you buy this TV and it is fulfilled by Amazon you are entitled to white glove delivery which includes unpacking, assembling the TV, and connecting the TV to your main source to verify a working picture. The only time you wouldn't get this service is if another company fulfilled the order through Amazon. The company (CEVA, Boston MA) that delivered my TV did this without asking.NEW FIRMWARE - The first thing I did was to get the newest firmware update from the Samsung website which is dated 22 Sept 2009 (version 1012). You should do this before adjusting your TV settings as this will reset them. You don't have to have your TV connected to the Internet. You just need a cheap USB travel drive.TWEEK PICTURE SETTINGS - The factory set picture settings are OK but CNET's are much truer to life.

This is my first HDTV, but I did do a lot of research before buying this one. I chose this model over others (5 series & Panny Viera) because this is the only \"plasma\" TV I could find in the market that supports DLNA (ability to stream files directly off my PC) and also has support for USB hard drive hookup. I hooked up my 500 gig (FAT32 format only) HDD and voila, all the files I can play directly off the HDD. Supports all possible media formats out there !! Apart from this it has extremely good connectivity (4 HDMI slots) and numerous inputs to hook up your home theater. This TV is a treat for the eyes...go get this one and you won't be disappointed.Another feature I love is the presence of a ethernet port ... it allows you to connect your TV to the LAN and stream files off the network through DLNA, you don't need to spend additional $$ on the wireless stick.

Price \"Bob\"", "ReviewID": "R2Y413HKCNXLDW", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I don't think it is possible to get a better deal...at a little over $1,100 this set is simply an amazing buy. Coupled with the all-in-one Samsung surround (BD1250T) I almost feel as though I'm IN the movie rather than merely watching it from my couch.  My viewing distance is close to the THX recommended 5.6 feet (I'm actually at 6.5) and the picture is stunning when watching 1080p content (digital cable looks good as well but of course not as good as the 1080p content).  The BD1250T does an excellent job up-converting my older DVDs; they look spectacular.I've seen several reviews discussing the red tint reflected onto the screen as well as a buzzing noise; I've experienced neither.  I can see the red tint when the TV is off but I don't notice it when viewing.  The speakers which come with the set are adequate but I would definitely recommend a surround sound system when viewing HD content (you can get the BD1250T for under $500 - just be aware that this particular surround sound model only has one HDMI connection which limits your ability to connect other devices via HDMI such as an HD DVR or PS3); you can step up to the more expensive model if you require more HDMI connections).  Of course the TV has plenty of HDMI connections.The only problem I've noticed with this TV: when you engage Cinema Smooth you lose your deep black level - it turns noticeably brighter.  I personally don't see a huge difference between watching the content in Cinema Smooth vice regular mode so this is absolutely not an issue for me - and I'm a huge movie buff so I watch a ton of movies.I don't see how you could possibly go wrong with this set.  Checkout the CNET reviews for both this TV and the BD1250T and you will see that they rate extremely high.Good luck!UPDATE: 1-8-2014  After over four years, and much use and abuse, still going strong; couldn't ask for a better TV!", "Date": "November 5, 2009"}, {"Title": "Excellent choice", "Author": "James Moore", "ReviewID": "R3P3POAC09LFI2", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "After a great deal of research I bit the bullet and ordered this TV.  I'm very happy with it -- in fact, delighted -- so far.  I'll list each concern that I had along with how things turned out for me:- Buzzing.  My number one fear was the buzzing that people have noted as an issue.  There is absolutely none, even when I turn the volume down to extremely low levels, and I'm hypersensitive to this kind of thing.- Glare.  I was also a little worried about the glare factor that some reviewers have mentioned.  I haven't had any issues at all.  The TV is in a room with medium-sized windows facing northeast, so there isn't a problem with direct sunlight but it's still fairly bright during the day.  I haven't needed to adjust any picture settings to compensate and there hasn't been any annoying reflection.  And I should add that the picture is amazingly crisp and vivid.- Sound.  Some people have reported the sound as being less than stellar.  My previous main TV, a Sony Wega, has very rich sound so based on the reviews I expected to hear something pretty tinny with this model.  It actually turned out to be much better than I had anticipated.  I don't feel the need to use my external audio system except when watching a movie, and that's just to get the full surround-sound experience.- Touch of color.  The red is slightly more vivid than I expected, but not overly so. I tend to be a neutral color person when it comes to electronics, but the color on this is still subtle and not overdone.  And the overall styling of this model is gorgeous.  It's beautiful to look at and people drool when they come over to visit.- Connections.  I wasn't quite sure what exactly would be available despite looking at the photos and documentation online.  I didn't have HDMI on my old TV and I used S-video for a couple of things so I thought I might run out of open ports.  I bought some HDMI cables for the cable box and DVD player, and I had no problem also hooking up my DVD recorder and stereo using conventional component cables.  I did retire my old VCR but I could easily have kept it as there are several remaining open connections, even for composite cables.  And I can still add a Blu-Ray DVD player if I decide to get one.- Burn in.  I've experienced none.  I was kind of worried when I ran the auto-channel programming feature because it has a very static screen and took quite awhile to process.  It added every scrambled channel on the cable network and then spent a long time removing them.  Happily, there were no unwanted effects.- Network connectivity.  I got the wireless USB device and it works great.  I can access music and photos on my computer as well as use the Yahoo widgets that are programmed into the TV.  I don't use it a lot but it's a fun feature.I know it can be a little difficult deciding on a major purchase like this.  I can say that after several weeks there is nothing that has disappointed me with this model so far and I'd highly recommend the Samsung PN50B650 if you're looking for a new TV.", "Date": "November 23, 2009"}, {"Title": "Died after 4 days...UPDATE: New one works brilliantly", "Author": "Rabidmonkeys", "ReviewID": "R2HYJEE93F1AA", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Yep 4 days in... while watching the final Pirates of the Caribbean movie, one long horizontal strip of pixels flickered then went black.

Value - This amazing tv can be had for around 1100 yet compete with those costing 4,000.2. Media Center - This also supports external usb hard drives and just about every video and audio codec out there today. Regular Divx movies now look amazing and actually better than upscaled dvd did on my 5 year old Toshiba HDTV.3. Vivid picture when there is sunlight coming into the room. My old HDTV was very hard to see because of glare. I had to cover some of my upper windows just to see the picture during the day. Now with this screen there is no problems no matter what amount of light that there is.4. Screen burn protection - This tv includes a anti burn pixel shift that you do not notice even if you stare close up that prevents what some other plasmas as well as crt's can get.5. Connections - I can now hook up a dvd player,PS3,laptop,DirectvHD DVR,external antenna and still have plenty of video inputs to work with. HDMI 1.3 needed for 1080P content of course.6. OTA - I was actually able to get 35 channels (many in HD) with a simple fm antenna here in Orlando. The OTA tuner seems to be able to pull on weak signals very well and the picture quality is excellent.7. Software - The tv has built in cookbooks and other cool features if you choose to use it. Along with any number of widgets that make it seems more like a computer rather than just a tv. Ethernet connection used for widgets updates.Cons  I can really find any other than a small annoyance. The tv memory is only 189 megs. Each software that you install (such as cookbooks or art gallery) takes up between 20 and 30 megs leaving little space to work with. Although you can just plug in a flash drive in one of the two usb ports on the side and utilize the software from that. Or you could play a movie directly from the flash drive, or music, or photos. The options seem almost endless. I try to say cons and end up saying more good things about this tv.  If you have the cash then jump on this deal. I opted for the two year no interest/payment deal with amazon card to pay as we go. Funds a little low since we just bought a house but this deal was too good to pass up.

The folks who have complained about the loud buzzing, you need to return the unit for another.Now to another issue, Burn-in. The first thing you do with any plasma set is TURN DOWN THE CONTRAST. No matter what mode you select the contrast is in the 90s. I cut the contrast down to 45/55, brightness 55/65, color 45, and turn on Burn Protection. The other tweaks to your liking. After the burn-in period, knock yourself out!The Cinema Smooth 1080p/24, no glitches I have noticed. The Internet feature works great. You need the Samsung WIS-08BG2X Wireless Link stick, plug it in the USB port on the side, go to the Internet option, select wireless, type in the WEP ID off your modem and your are ready to surf. Hope this helps in your decision, take care.", "Date": "December 24, 2009"}, {"Title": "This could be a 5 STAR!!!", "Author": "neolohana", "ReviewID": "R3M6DZUXD3XSU4", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Bought this HDTV from Amazon two weeks ago.  The delivery service was excellent for my apartment on 2nd floor....the guys unpacked the unit and they were there until I basic tested it ok.  Had to go with Plasma technology vs. LCD/LED for the price and picture.  Compared several units on display and even with all the bright lights in the store, we thought plasma was better than LCD.  The 52\" LCD picture for pretty much like watching a cartoon and the colors were not believable.  We started to get a headache after 10-15 minutes of watching the LCD TV...even from a reasonable distance in the store.  In our opinion, the plasma had more true picture and colors.  The store also had one of the plasma TV connected to a blu-ray disc player and the picture was excellent - we were sold and had our decision made.  Now comes the question of brand - it was classic battle between Panny and Sammy.  I had my reservations for Samsung initially, knowing that Panasonic is the leader after Pioneer left the Plasma market.  We paid close attention comparing the picture for Panasonic vs. Samsung and felt that Samsung had even more life-like picture than Panasonic for 1080i cable television.  Did not get a chance to compare 1080p blu-ray discs or movies.  It finally came down to G15 vs. B650 - went with Samsung B650 for the great amazon interest-free financing.  Its been two weeks now and I must say I cannot complain.  It has very good set of connectivity ports and internet features such as youtube and yahoo widgets.  Overall very happy with the purchase so far...would give a 4 star rating for now but will review after a couple of months....if all looks great will change it to 5 star rating!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!", "Date": "December 25, 2009"}, {"Title": "Great TV at a great price", "Author": "G.

You can't beat the deal that Amazon is offering with the $150 off coupon code, but its still a great deal at $1299, which is what I payed for it.My TV is in a pretty bright room with a large window on the side, and I see very minimal glare during the day time, and no glare at all at night.

Came back out this week and installed it (another $265) but the line remained.  Service tech told me it might take a couple of days for the line to disappear (???) but if the new part didn't fix it then the plasma screen was defective and Samsung should replace it.  I've been around awhile, and I've never seen a piece of electronics \"heal\" itself days after a repair - it either works or it doesn't.  Since Samsung has refused to warranty this product, I don't know how I'm going to get another plasma screen out of them.  I'm calling the service center next week to see what can be done, but I'm not expecting anything.  I probably just threw good money out the door and I'm really unhappy with Samsung.

My husband was dead set against plasma at first due to the initial problems plasma TV's were known for- burn in, reflection, and energy consumption. Boy are we both glad he gave this TV a chance. The picture quality is absolutely amazing. To achieve maximum useage out of the 1080p, 600hz capability, definitely invest in a blu ray player and upgrade to hd TV with your cable or digital TV provider. Seriously, once you see an HD image on this baby, you'll never want to watch anything else. My husband plays video games and if you like to game, you have to go plasma. Now lets talk price. Our old LCD Samsung that we replaced with this TV cost us about $500 more and was 8 inches smaller. We bought it here, on amazon, on sale with no sales tax and free shipping with our amazon prime trial for a grand total of $1139. How bout them apples?! The blu ray images are so amazing it is almost like you could walk right into the picture. Some have almost a 3D quality. No jaggies, blurring, or any of the traditional LCD problems. This TV is energy star rated, we haven't seen any burn in. I'll be honest and say that I'm still getting used to seeing a bit of reflection after having an LCD for so long. We have it in a pretty bright room, so sometimes we need to shut the curtains so we're not distracted by the reflection. A small small price to pay for such an amazing picture and a great price. One last thing- we also looked at the 850 model of this TV. The ONLY difference between the two is the thickness of the unit, and the price. So, unless having a TV that is an inch and a half thick versus 2 and a half to 3 inches thick for about 500 bucks more is super important to you- stick with this one.", "Date": "January 9, 2010"}, {"Title": "Amazing Amazon -Amazing Samsung !!!", "Author": "kitkat \"kitkat\"", "ReviewID": "R38G73ZBTYT5C3", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "We bought this TV after 3 months of research and analytics. In the end in our analysis Plasma won over LCD and Samsung won over Panasonic.We were decided on the Panasonic G10 but made a switch at the last minute with this deal to save some extra $$. We may also have a Sammy bias as we have owned 3 Samsung TVs so far and are very happy with their performance and service.First on Amazing Amazon - This was our first big electronics deal on Amazon. No sales tax + free dly = no brainer ! Amazon gives you the best deal - period. We chose standard delivery and were lucky to get the TV delivered at home in 3 days !! Very professional and courteous folks from CEVA brought the big package one level up the stairs, unpacked and hooked it up for us. Very smooth! This beats site to store/pick up from any big box retailer.Now on the Amazing Samsung TV - amazing colors and contrast - our other TV is a Sammy LCD hdtv and we feel Plasma picture quality is way superior than LCD. LED LCDs are comparble/better but almost $1k more expensive at same size.Having watched CRT most of our growing years we are tolerant to a bit of glare and chose not to shell out extra money to avoid it completely. This TV reduces glare to a large extent but you still get some if light source is in direct reflection path.  a non issue for us. Also while we worry about the image retention /burn in issue we have not seen any so far even though we watch all the regular news channels and logo channels as before. Again possibly we are not looking for it so do not notice when it does happen for a while and then it gets corrected automatically in a few minutes. We mainly watch Cable TV and on weekends watch a few DVDs. The TV is in its 2nd week now and we are taking precautions like making the picture larger to fit screen or in wide mode. The in built pixel shift process for preventing image retention is also in the ON mode and working I guess. Will update after the break in period is over.We have no issue with the sound on this TV - we use direct sound from TV as well as have it wired to a 5.1 Sammy Home Theater system which we use only switch to for the movies or special progrmas.Size was another factor we had trouble deciding. From 46 to 55 inch we finally decided it had to be 50. 46 is aso a decent if you are upgrading from a 32 or 37 and 50/52 is as good as 55 if you want a bigger look. The difference is more noticable in showrooms with TVs side by side - otherwise even after months of looking at TVs we get fooled into thinking a lone 46 on the wall is a 52 or that a 50 is a 54- to us they all look equally big in isolation.Overall we are very happy with this purchase and recommend it strongly to anyone looking for a good TV with a great picture and at a great price.", "Date": "January 8, 2010"}, {"Title": "Awesome 5Samsung PN50B650 50-Inch 1080p Plasma HDTV with Internet", "Author": "Life-Long Entrepreneur \"Kenneth Ervin Young\"", "ReviewID": "R3G3JTRXAAG2RK", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This is my 2nd 50\" Plasma set, my first being bought a bit over 5 years ago - a 50\" 720p Vizio (Which lasted just about 4 years before three electronics boards died and Vizio would not sell them to either myself or a local repair shop (only would supply IF I had been under an extended warranty through them - I used to praise Vizio, but now will warn people away from them).I bought the Samsung PN50B650 50-Inch 1080p Plasma HDTV 50-Inch 1080p Plasma HDTV for 3 reasons:1) Plasma yields much better blacks and more realistic colors than the most expensive LCD/LED combo available,2) reported Samsung quality and customer service (parts availability,AND3)a great online price (<$1K delivered) from Amazon.This is the step-up set from the Samsung PN50B550 50-Inch 1080p Plasma HDTV and basically adds built-in internet capability. Due to a great \"hidden price\" at Amazon, I actually paid less for this step up set than the entry model from almost anywhere else on or off line that I looked.Delivery was good and on time (4 hour window, but I called and the scheduler narrowed it to within a 1 hour window). Two cleanly dressed delivery people brought my set and opened the box (per my request) so I could inspect for damage (none)The set does take two people to lift into place above a fireplace (but any set would). The set is placed above my fireplace in the family room which gets a lot of sun but we have no issue viewing. I have NOT touched the default settings, but plan to play around with them at some point to see if I can improve on an already superb picture.No bad pixels - normal in plasma but a rarity in LCD sets. Setup of internet connection with widgets was consumer simple (yes, I'm a high tech geek, but it really was 3rd grade simple). A guide walks you through the setup and it very 3rd grade level with visual and audible explanations.And yes, as some have reported, the internet widgets are a bit slow to load and to change, but hey, this IS A TV, not a desktop computer. If you want speed, set up a headless nettop to display on your TV.There is NO Buzz as is often common with some plasmas, which I credit Samsung with a great design team (plasmas SHOULD NOT buzz, that is a design defect). The sound through the speakers is surprisingly good, but if you want serious sound, hook up a serious sound system (I haven't yet).The remote, as all do , has too many buttons, but is well labeled easy to use.

He diagnosed the problem as a defective main board, with a cost of repair of $400, including $169 for the part. BTW, the same part is available for $90 on line (or even $55 used on EBay). So I ordered replaced the main board myself: the good news is that the TV turns on, but the bad news is that most of the functions (e.g., menu, enter) don't work at all. It seems that the problem goes beyond the main board.A comparable new set isn't much more than the $400 charge, and I bet there's even more to repair. The expenditure of time is also a pain in the rear. I'm throwing in the towel and buying a new set, and selling the Samsung for whatever salvage value I can get. I'm not a happy camper.

Sometimes the picture is so good I feel like I could reach out and touch the people on the screen.I've never been a big football fan, but I have to admit watching football over the air on this thing is an experience like no other.  The players' uniforms seem to leap off the screen!  For Blu Ray movies, the Cinema Smooth feature seems to work just fine for me, and boy do those movies look good. I did, however, notice a slight flicker in some of the darker scenes in \"I am Legend\" and the new \"Dawn of the Dead.\"  I'm not sure if that's the TV or what, but it's only a very minor and infrequent nuisance.  Overall, with this TV and the audio setup, I feel my home movie experience is much better than the theater, and with movie tickets being as expensive as they are these days it's worth it to just by the movie and watch it at home.PS3 gaming is out of this world.  I use the same picture settings for movies as I do for gaming, and the TV seems plenty fast enough to keep up with rapid gaming movements.  There is a slight drawback, however, with the plasma technology and gaming: burn-in.  Many games I play seem to have had good enough designers so that the stationary on-screen indicators are in color shades that don't lend themselves to burn-in, like light grays or greens, but I do notice an after-image.  It does fix itself in a few minutes of normal TV viewing or the built-in after-image remover, so I wouldn't worry about it.  To help guard against this, I did use screen break-in images on a USB stick to burn the screen in for about 150 hours before I really started using it.Overall great TV at a great price.", "Date": "January 21, 2010"}, {"Title": "Wonderful picture, problems with it however", "Author": "Jeff Bergstrom", "ReviewID": "RHMB1D1MH79I0", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "The picture of this tv is outstanding.

What a sweet deal [...]  from Amazon during Thanksgiving sales window. I researched HDTVs for 2 months before I made this purchase. I absolutely LOVE it! It is the visual centerpiece of my home theater system anchored by the Pioneer VSX-1019AH-K 7.1 Receiver, and mated with a Samsung BD P3600 Blu-Ray player, Polk Audio TSi 400 towers, Polk Audio CS10 Center Channel Speaker, Polk Audio TSi 100 shelf speakers for rear surround, and a Polk Audio PSW10 Subwoofer.I'm running DirectTV through the receiver and HD programming on the Samsung Plasma is beautiful, Blu-Ray HD is awesome - crisp, true colors, deep blacks, no motion issues, etc. Plasma beats LCD and LED displays hands down, and the new models are pretty energy efficient - should not really be a factor in making a decision now. One very important thing to note that I was not made aware of in any reviews or by the manufacturer is that Plasmas have a break in period. After being tipped off to this by a friend, I found plenty of very helpful information on how to do this on the Web. While PN50B650 and most other Plasmas have anti-image burn protection, it is still a good idea to follow basic break in procedures. These include running the screen at a lower contrast, lower cell light, setting the pixel shift feature to on, and avoiding still images or fixed tickers or logos to be displayed during break in. Most information I found on Plasma break in, suggests 200-250 hours. After that, the risk of image burn is greatly diminished. The following links were extremely helpful, you can download a break in DVD that can help speed up the process by running it when not watching movies and/or TV.

You don't get that cookie cutter effect that the top end LCDs often have. The Internet features are nice, if a bit sluggish. Might be more of a pain unless you are just really lazy and don't want to leave the couch.Great menus and loads of picture options. Connection to computer server for additional content worked well. Even played a burn of a Video_TS file from a DVD I own.OTA HDTV looks great. I could hardly see a difference between 1080p, 1080i broadcast and 720P, like I could with other TVs. Which means the TV is doing some excellent processing. I saw the same effect when playing a iPhone formatted movie. Somehow the TV managed to make it look great.The menus are well laid out and very attractive to look at.Cons: PiP doesn't work with OTA and Analog AV, I couldn't watch a SD DVD and OTA at the same time. Minor limitation. I suspect it is a hardware limitation.Remote is a bit slow to react, but NOT deal breaker slow. Server content manager is a bit unorganized, best to share a folder you organize yourself.There are menu items that are a bit too buried for my liking, such as the OTA signal strength indicator and a few others, but you can't have everything where you want unless Samsung created a custom menu option...HINT!The 24p film mode causes the black levels to lighten, this is a well known problem with this model. I haven't figured out any workarounds and it doesn't looks like this issue will ever be fixed.Screen burn is a minor issue. If you are playing anything with a static image, make sure to engage the game mode and keep pixel shift on. This makes it pretty much a non-issue.Pixel shift isn't available in Movie picture mode, so you will need to use the standard picture mode.Conclusion:For around $1000, you probably can't do any better on a 50\" TV, or even a 46\" for that matter.I picked out a LG 47LH90 LED LCD for my father-in-law for $1200, which was a steal.

The one limitation is in the PS3 itself. The PS3 will not turn off the unit when a disc is being played. Probably a good thing.I'm using a Pioneer 919ah-k in between the PS3 and the TV and it works well besides the above PS3 limitation.When you turn off the PS3, the TV will automatically go to another source (in my case the OTA antenna).1080p sources from the PS3 are stunning.

The colors are vivid and the blacks pure.  There is no distortion when viewing off-axis.  As an additional bonus, the stand allows the screen to rotate which I have utilized several times.  It's not a necessity, but an addition that, when used, is very convenient.Initially I wanted an LCD, however after a great deal of research, I settled on this plasma for several reasons:1) Consumer Reports gave it some of the highest marks for any flat-screen TV.  I trust their reviews and they have yet to steer me wrong with large purchases.  This TV was certainly in the category and I can see why it received such high marks.2) Price:  Last December, a similar-sized LCD cost a lot more than what I paid for this TV.  Granted, with the evolution of LED and 3D technology, generic LCDs costs have come down, but I still find that the majority of plasmas allow for more TV for the same price.3) Size:  Dove-tailing off the price issue, I was able to buy a 50-inch TV for the same price as 42 and 46 inch LCD competitors.  Since this product is located in the living room, a larger screen was nice.  A bedroom or a small office might be too little space depending on how close you like your screen.4) Quality of Picture: LCDs (not counted LED and 3D) have had some listed issues of view angles.  Depending on the product, this can be significant or non-existant.  The Samsung PN50650 doesn't suffer view angle issues and the colors and startlingly crisp.  HD and SD channels are clean and fluid.  Additionally, there is no \"blurring\" and no \"soap-opera-camera\" effect that some LCDs suffer with their motion compensation effects.  Again, technology improves at an exponential rate, but this time last year the majority of LCDs (120-240 hz) suffered from this effect.Two misconceptions that I quickly overcame with plasmas were weight and the \"burn in\" effect.  The PN50B650 was light enough that a friend and I were able to lift it onto the entertainment stand with minimal effort.  As for burn in, there are recommendations that the first 100-200 hours of viewing avoid long periods of paused screens (i.e. video games, music channels, etc), however I found this to be no issue at all.  I was cautious at first, but soon overcame this and have had zero problems with burn-in.As for some of the TV's extra features (i.e. widgets, LAN connection, etc), I have yet to use them and have not found a need for it at all.  There are HDMI ports which are excellent for gaming stations, Blu-Ray players, or HDTV boxes, as well as several component and USB ports.As a final note, the Amazon team did an amazing job with delivery.  The product shipped the day after I placed my order and the sub-contracted local delivery truck arrived several days before the expected delivery date.Overall this product has been impressive and I am very pleased with it.  It appears that the trend still holds that customers can purchase larger-screened plasmas for the same price as their smaller LCD competitors, so they are worth considering.", "Date": "January 2, 2011"}, {"Title": "An Unbeatable Value", "Author": "Michael J. Descy", "ReviewID": "R2BBNBTZF1YVFW", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "My wife and I bought this TV a year ago and haven't regretted it for a second.Video and ScreenThe picture looks fantastic. After fiddling with CNET's recommended adjustments, I ended up settling to the \"Standard\" factory-default. I thought that worked well in my living room, which has a medium amount of brightness. The screen does glare a bit-it's fundamentally a giant pane of glas, after all-but as long as the lamps we have directly in front of it (on each side of our loveseat) aren't on, it is not a problem at all. Even when those lamps are on, I don't notice the glare much at all unless I'm watching a very dark scene.AudioI've listened to cable TV, DVDs, and streaming Netflix and Pandora radio through the TV speakers. I think it sounds pretty good: at least as good as the old 32\" Toshiba CRT TV that it is replacing. For serious music and movie watching, I'll eventually get a receiver and a speaker package. The TV won't output anything other than stereo from HDMI, so I will need a separate connection to the receiver, instead of being able to route everything via HDMI through the TV. That is a little inconvenient, but no worse than I would expect.ConnectionsThere are 3 HDMI ports in the back and one on the side, as well as two USB ports on the side. All the older component and composite video inputs are there, too, except for S-Video and DVI. I'm only using the HDMI ports and the USB ports, and they are fine. For wired networking, there is an Ethernet jack on the back, too. The TV has a pretty graceful way of managing the source of the TV. You can name each source \"Cable,\" \"Blu-Ray,\"and so on. It automatically recognized my DLNA server on my home network, too.RemoteThe remote is good, and has some cool functions that integrate with other Samsung products via HDMI, so you can use it to control their Blu-Ray player, for instance. It is not a universal remote, which makes it useless if you have to have a cable box, like I do.USB Media SupportThe TV supports every video format (Divx, MPEG4, H.264), audio format (AAC, MP3), and container format (.avi, .mp4, .mkv) that I could come up with. You have full playback control (pause, fast-forward, and rewind), and the TV can resume viewing where you left off. The TV does not properly stretch out anamorphic videos, however, which is a definite minus. That is not a problem with any downloaded content (from torrents, let's say), but ripping your own DVDs with Handbrake requires a custom preset. I'm still trying to figure out good encoding settings. This feature is fantastic, except for the lack of proper anamorphic video support.DLNADLNA allows you to stream audio, video, and pictures across your home network from a server to this TV. It is an exciting but fundamentally broken technology. It's broken because format support is very poor, and playback requirements are ridiculously minimal. It is spotty not just on this TV, but all media players, apparently. I don't have a Windows PC available to run the included Media Connect DLNA server software, but I found that minidlna worked like a charm on my Ubuntu Linux server. (Don't even bother with MediaTomb, which is in the Ubuntu repositories. It doesn't stream videos to this TV correctly. ) I found that the TV supports minimal DLNA video playback. With the latest firmware, as of 10/17/09, the TV does not support scanning, pausing, or resuming playback. It also doesn't properly stretch anamorphic video, either. You can stream HD video in certain formats (MP4, DIVX) and it looks beautiful, but it's difficult to figure out just what formats are supported.NetworkingThe TV has an Internet jack in the back, and you can plug in a proprietary Samsung wifi-a/b/g/n adapter into one of the USB ports in the back. You have to order the adapter separately. I did, and it worked well. It understands the various flavors of wireless security, and hasn't given me any problems.Internet FunctionsI've tried to play with the Yahoo Widgets, but they load slowly and don't seem too useful. I wouldn't get too excited about the Internet features. It is nice, however, to do the firmware upgrade over the network. The TV will even notify you when new firmware is available. The main reason to use networking is DLNA, which is good but not great, as discussed above.Overall ImpressionsThis is a great TV. The picture looks fantastic. The build quality is great. It looks nice. The speakers are adequate for everyday viewing. I don't knock it for having inferior audio-out and run-of-the-mill DLNA support. The price is very good on this set, too; I picked it up for far less than a much smaller LCD TV.", "Date": "October 30, 2010"}, {"Title": "Unbelievable Picture!", "Author": "C.

The landscapes of British Columbia come through with great clarity, so much that my wife and I are thinking about going there for a vacation in the future!Also, I read reviews about the TV buzzing.  I will say that I can hear the buzzing when close up to the TV, or if the sound is muted, I can faintly hear it from my couch.  The speakers I have running the sound through completely drown it out though, and I have no issue there.  You are going to have a little buzzing with any plasma, just the way they operate.  I guess one would have to weigh how sensitive their ears are, and how much they can focus on one little thing.

To me it looks like what TV is supposed to, (more CRT like) instead of the somewhat \"fake\" appearance with LCDs.  When I was shopping locally I found retailers really like to push LCDs...probably b/c they cost more and they can get more on 1 truck b/c of the weight, but for people who take the time to investigate the differences, plasma is more often the winner.The main differences are well known and can be summed up fairly simply; cost(plasma wins), motion(plasma wins), weight(LCD wins), color(plasma wins), screen reflection(LCD wins)...energy consumption(LCD wins), but if you're really concerned about being Green you should be outside or doing some Green activity and not inside watching TV.  There is some noticable reflection during the daytime, but I have South facing windows hitting the TV and it's nothing that prevents me from watching television.

The one bad review item I can't confirm is the 1080/24 mode issue, but I've read this was already addressed in newer revisions.The settings menu is easy to navigate. This does not have a red accent to the bezel as some websites state. The screen does reflect light in my window filled room, but I imagine when I can finally turn up the brightness etc it will only be noticeable during dark pictures playback. This reflection was the only reason I was considering the LN750 models, but I read it is equally reflective (and more expensive). At night there obviously is no issue.There is one issue which bothers me as I compare it to my old Aquios. My old TV would save screen size by channel and this Samsung does not. For example I could set all HD channels to 'dot to dot' picture and non HD channels to 'side stretch'. For the Samsung it's all channels to one format, so I find myself switching the picture size depending on what I'm watching. Probably in the future I'll keep the Samsung to 16:9 format, but during the first 100 hrs I want to keep the picture full screen to prevent unneeded burn in issues (although so far even when I do have black bars from being a lazy potato they do not create any real issue).I've played a few XBOX 360 COD MW2 matches the first day and the picture is fantastic, no burn in noticed. But I also play hardcore, so the static stat bars are not as many...I'm a little disappointed the online availability is only allowed with Samsung's proprietary hardware. While I have not tried it yet I can imagine having the sole key to this puzzle will only end up as bad news. No competition means they can only go at their own pace for improvements, and I'm sure at an added cost. But speculation on my part...Overall, I'm loving this TV. I'm glad I let my buddy talk me into a plasma. I expect this thing to provide many years of quality entertainment. I should also mention my basis of comparison was a 32\" LCD (the Aquios I mentioned), so I might be a little star struck on how a picture this big can look so good. Also I know down the road I'll be convinced the 650 will be worth the extra $100-$200 over the 550 because of the extras, notably when I finally break down and get a PS3 or a stand alone Blu-ray for the 1080/24 option and the ability to access whatever online content becomes available.For the record, official model of the TV I got was PN50B650S1F. Not sure exactly what the S1F suffix means other than the revision I got, but it may affect my experience so far.PS: I forgot about the sound. Better than my Aquios, but at 50\" I expect most folks have a stereo or something hooked in. On it's own it does well for factory speakers. Louder for sure and I was surprised to find a built in EQ in the settings. While I've read the output will not do 5.1/6.1, I'm not concerned because I watch most TV w/o my outdated Pioneer receiver (I live in a shared wall house). I always fear my Bose shelf speakers will bring the police. Unlike the Aquios the louder I make the TV volume, it actually get louder.", "Date": "February 18, 2010"}, {"Title": "So far so good...", "Author": "J.

Martin", "ReviewID": "R1WKQH12J2BAQ0", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Omg not the buzz! Not the buzz! Ok people relax, there's no buzz. Seriously not at all. With so much ambient noise in the world, it's funny that we a select group of techies have homed their ears into the faint hum created by the back of a TV set. It does not buzz at all, you really can't hear it, my Ps3 makes more noise. If you are looking at buying this TV, throw the buzzing out of your considerations for this TV. It doesn't buzz. I will say that if you get a defective set, you might have all sorts of problems ranging from bad sounds to bad picture. This could happen with anything you buy from TVs to Toasters. What makes a great company is their ability to fix these inherent product problems. Samsung has been a leader in customer satisfaction for years. Just google them up now, they are always in the top three!Amazon is great they gave me 3 years no interest payments on this TV, it was delivered two weeks before it was supposed to be. I got a free blu-ray playerwith the TV( got it literally two days after I ordered),  which I sold. The shipping company Amazon uses kinda sucks, their tracking reports are always behind, they never know where your stuff is. You have to stay on top of them, but given that it's free and the TV weights about 100pnds shipped, I can't complain too too much. They aren't Fedex that's for sure, and if you don't call them every couple days to check on your package it might get shipped to the wrong place (happened to my brother).The TV is beautiful. The colors are much better than it's LCD counterpart. Don't be afraid of the plasma, it rocks! In the store you might not notice how nice it is because retailers jack the colors and brightness up on the all sets. Once I got my TV home I changed the settings to the ones I saw in the AVS forum and I pretty much always leave it in movie mode. I don't use the cini-view for the blu-rays, I know some people complained that it brightened the picture. I just never use it. It already looks so fantastic. One negative I will say which is inherent with all plasmas is that there is some image retention. It goes away but if you leave your TV on still images(etc.) and turn it off, the images will stay until you turn the TV on and get a picture moving on there. Also, if you have a solid white background and black texts come over it, the picture bands horizontally. It's annoying for sure but every technology has it's draw backs, I guess. Overall, though this is the best picture in the price range...you won't find a brighter Plasma with better blacks. Samsung has really covered all the bases here. Plasma might be a dying technology but everything will be outdated at some point. That's the nature of the beast. I mean they just invented SUPER-HD in Japan and 3Ds also on the horizon. So who cares? This TV beats LCD for picture quality and black levels. And for just a thinner screen LED is too expensive. The room I'm in isn't super bright but I couldn't ever see the brightness of this TV being an issue. The anti-glare coating rocks, btw. My LCD computer monitor gets more glare. Also it adds another tinge of Red to the TV.Btw, I never use any of the widgets on the TV or anything...I've heard they are slow but I can't speak to that.", "Date": "February 4, 2010"}, {"Title": "Great product", "Author": "AR", "ReviewID": "R2DK3NACU7A12I", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I got this TV for new year's.

As soon as i un-boxed it i connected the internet to use the auto update function and it said i had the new firmware.  I received the item 2 days in advance when it was being delivered on Jan 6th. I ordered mine Dec 28, shipped on the 29 , got in town on Jan 4th but choose Jan 5th delivery. The TV is spectacular, crystal clear picture.. i read a few places online that users posted there calibration settings but found it better playing with the functions myself. Its not difficult, just turn an HD show like the history channel in HD and set the picture to 16x9 and calibrate the colors from there. It has a description on what everything does and just calibrate using you own performance/eye.  I personally liked Dynamic mode and switched a few settings and i was ready to go. Every setting including custom mode stores your settings. You can also select Movie mode and alter movie mode to your liking. CS aka cinema smooth only operates on blue ray movies including xyzx color space. (for blue rays and PS3 games).Ive had no issues reported.I can honestly say i feel i made a good choice. Ive gone from a Sony 46inch XBR , Samsung DLP pedestal model (limited edition touch screen) to my new one PN50B650 plasma is the best purchase ive made.. Even my father whos not into technology commented on how real it looks. The blacks are dark and it mimics a CRT TV when watching stander programing not in HD. Now i know why everyone says the picture is incredible. The TOC isn't a big deal is barely noticeable and blends in with the black unless your up close. You really see the difference of a 3million to 1 contrast ratio...and for the warry, dont be afraid of a plasma TV.I do recommend setting the borders of the picture when viewing 4.3 programing to light and turn on pixel shift, but do not use screen fit because it disables pixel shift (helps reduce burn ins). They also have a built in white screen that washes out any after effects like logos or small images making it more resistance to burn ins. Im happy i shelled out the money!

The Hitachi was good and I thought you would never be able to tell the diffrence between 720p/1080i but it is very clear that the superior detail in this set stands apart from my previous one. Colors seem very accurate right out of the box, the flesh tones look good. Some people say that the picture emphasizes red but I do not see it. The sound processors are very good and create a nice 5.1 soundstage from broadcast programs using the TosLink connector to the sound processor. I do not yet have a Blue-Ray player to test out but my current STB unit, a Denon 2900, in 480p mode looks very nice, has a clean picutre and details the film grain from the shoot stock. I hope to purchase an OPPO BP-23SE sometime this year and see how Blue Ray translates on the 1080P set. High Def ATSC Sports broadcasts are magnificent, Sunday Night Football is like being on the sidelines, I am drooling in anticipation for February and the Winter Olympics. The remote is fairly well laid out and is backlit, on the downside there is no future program preview / info aspect under the info control, you cannot move forward in time to see what programs are going to be broadcast from the program listed immediately after the one you are currently watching. For you cable users this may not be a big deal but for ATSC viewers there is no way to use the OSP to see what's on later than the one immediately psat the show you are watching.I've briefly experimented with the media play aspects of the unit, I like the idea of using a pen drive to watch movies transferred from a hard drive to TV but the Nero MP4 format is not supported in DD AC3 configurations, only stereo. AVI conversions do not seem to hold the video format well and are of considerably less quality than the MP4 format and you can only FF at 2x rate from Media Play Mode. I will report more once I get familiarized with the set-up of the TV. For the money this TV cannot be beat, it's a plasma and a power hog but still has better blacks and viewing angles than cuttent LCD models.

I chose this plasma because I find the picture on the plasma is more natural looking than that of LCDs on some content, the better off-center viewing of the plasma, and the good motion response characteristics. Negatives are higher energy use than LCDs, greater heat output, image retention inconvenience, and no high altitude use, which is not an issue for me. I chose this plasma as the best bang for the buck. Most equivalent to the Panasonic V10, but hundreds of dollars cheaper. I like the looks of this set better as well. The picture on both is outstanding. The heat on the set is not as much as I had feared. The HD picture is great. SD not so much, though acceptable. My brothers Samsung LCD looks better on SD content to be honest. The anti-glare screen is better at reducing glare than I expected, based on reviews. It is quite good. The sound is also better than I expected IF you adust the equalizer and boost the bass and midrange. Picture control options are excellent. Blacks are excellent. No humming issues at all. Overall, very happy with the purchase. I did use the CNET settings as a starter, but ended up adjusting slightly as they produce an almost sepia tone on black and white content and grays. I actually purchased at Pacific Sales. Got a great buy and they delivered and set up the set for $1028 and that included CA tax and $25 mandatory CA disposal fee. I also purchased an LG BD370 from Amazon and am happy with that as well. Also got a Pioneer Elite thx receiver. Very happy with all three.

Luckily for me this all took place in the first year so it was all covered under Samsungs's excellent warranty. Basically I have a new TV since everything installed at the factory has been replaced except the frame. Been going good since about September of 2010 when it was repaired last.

Shortly after starting my research I realized I wanted a Plasma instead of an LCD because of the superior true-to-life colors and blacks, and the absence of the blur issue that LCD's can have.  So then it was between Panasonic and Samsung.  I struggled between these two brands quite a bit!  But here is why I chose a Samsung...1) I like the USB drive instead of the SD Card slot on the Panasonic.  It just seems to me that the USB will be much more useful.2) I like the option of the swivel base instead of the stationary base on the Panasonic.3) The Touch of Color is different from others...sets it apart a little and it really isn't all that noticeable anyway except when the sun is directly on it.  I don't notice it when the TV is on.4) The color on the Samsung was reviewed as being more accurate than the Panasonic, although the black levels on the Panasonic were reviewed as being slightly better.  I will never notice since I won't have a the two side by side ever!5) Just before I bought, reviews/concerns came out that the Panasonic's black levels actually get worse over time...this really pushed me towards the Samsung since the stunning black levels are what Plasma's are known for!6) The price was a little lower than the Panasonic, although not huge, but the combination of all the things I mentioned previously and the price with the 24 month-no interest made the deal for me.Overall this TV is fantastic, it's my first big screen and my first digital TV!  I have basic cable and I pick up extra channels (including HD) that I didn't before with my analog TV.  Non-HD channels look okay but not great which should be expected with a larger display size. But the HD channels are awesome, even though they don't come in true 1080p.  I don't have a BluRay player yet, but probably will in the future and look forward to watching in true HD.  The sound is okay, but not home theater quality-if you want that then get a home theater system.  I just have 12\" Cerwin Vega front speakers hooked up to my receiver for sports and movies and it sounds fine for me.  The remote is easy to use and looks nice with the glossy black finish (although it does lag a little in response time).  I haven't hooked it up to the internet yet, so that was not a huge selling point for me but a nice option if I want to in the future.If I have any other suggestion, it's to buy as big as you can afford.  I noticed a huge difference between my old 27\" CRT and this plasma TV when I first got it.  Now after having it for a few months, it doesn't seem as huge anymore!  Not to detract from the TV at all, but it's something to consider.Again, I am very happy with my purchase and look forward to many years of great TV viewing...I would recommend this TV to any of my friends.", "Date": "March 27, 2010"}, {"Title": "Overall still happy", "Author": "Steven Kozuch \"Nancy\"", "ReviewID": "RQ2NYXUY03B31", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "In order to properly rate an item it needs to be functioning for over 2 years etc.  I have read mixed reviews on this TV.

Occasionally, the glare will cause me to adjust the angle of the TV a few degrees left or right, which seems to handle the problem.Other reviews have complained about a \"buzzing\", but I had no evidence of that with my set.Other reviews have commented negatively on the speakers.  I can't say I've spent much time using the TV's internal speakers, since I run everything thru an Onkyo Home Theater.Some reviewers have spoken of Burn-in as a negative characteristic of Plasma.

You can see all of the features above, so I won't go into listing them. One thing I was pleasantly surprised about is how light the TV is. I was able to unpack and set up the TV by myself, lifting it onto the stand with almost no difficulty. It is much lighter than I expected. The only difficulty I had with setting it up was with the unwieldy size, not the weight.I can only think of two things a potential buyer should be aware of before buying, and I don't think either issue is important enough to reduce my 5-star rating.1. The screen is quite reflective. Even with the Ultra FilterBright feature, sunny windows and lamps reflect on the screen enough to be a distraction. However, the glare compared to my last plasma screen TV is very much reduced. So I just close the blinds and turn off any lamps behind me, and it's not an issue.2. The Internet widgets are very slow. The Youtube and Amazon widgets are really great, especially the Amazon Video on Demand widget, I use it several times a week. But it still takes a good 3-5 minutes from the time I hit the \"Internet\" button on the remote until I'm actually in the Amazon video screen picking what I want to watch. I also hope they continue to add to the Internet widget selection, as I've found most of them (Showtime, CBS, etc) to be basically glorified advertisements rather than viable sources of entertainment.

I read the Consumer Reports reviews and look at their ratings, then it's over to CNET for a sanity check and to see what their readers have said, then I check all of the online vendors to compare prices and narrow the field to one or two items at one or two vendors. Then I usually buy at Amazon because their prices are great and shipping is always spot-on! No, they didn't pay me to say that :-)The 50\" Samsung plasma wasn't even a thought in my head when I first started looking for a large-format 1080P HD, I was actually looking for another LCD. I've read all the reviews about plasma vs. LCD (see above) but this Samsung is just an amazingly good TV for relatively good value. I needed multiple HDMI inputs, wifi capability (w/optional adapter), an optical audio out, and the ability to display low-res local programing as well as higher resolutions. The Samsung hits the mark on all of these.A few reviewers have correctly knocked this Samsung for its less than amazing audio, fair enough. But these big sets are nearly always paired with a 5.1 or 7.1 surround system (mine is...) and this wasn't a big deal for me, that said I usually use the integral audio for most news programs anyway.

There is a slight buzz with this set, I have had one set replaced due to some damage during shipping and both made an identical noise.  The good news is that the sound diminishes over time, and is mostly present when the contrast is high.  For the first 200 hours you shouldn't be blasting the contrast anyway, so it's a good reminder.  The second drawback would be that this plasma is definitely very susceptible to image retention especially when gaming.  It does have a screen wipe feature that will get rid of residual images rather quickly, regardless, after a month of solid viewing the retention is just as significant a problem as it was when we first received the television.  As a gamer, this worries me a bit and I've been going a bit lite on my gaming sessions and will probably continue to do so for a few months.On to the positives, the picture quality is fantastic.  I've switched from an LCD and the difference is simply... wow.  Great black levels, colors pop, just beautiful.  DNLA is great as well as I run a server on my pc and am able to stream music and video right to my tv.  The whole menu is just a breeze, though I wish it were easier to switch from game mode to movie mode (there are shortcuts to switch from normal to movie mode, but game mode is in a sub-menu... a very minor issue).  I game on a PS3 and the games are simply beautiful... great response time, I had no idea how much input lag I was getting on my sony bravia until I made the switch.The set itself looks fantastic as well.  The touch of red suits it perfectly, the glass stand looks great too.  I have a somewhat well lit living room with a large window to the north and the television on the south wall... the anti-glare works great and reflection isn't a problem in my house.  If I really look I do see a reflection in bright light but I don't notice it at all.I don't use the yahoo widgets, I plan on trying the amazon video rental service it offers, but haven't gotten around to it yet.  Other then that we just have the weather widget but we see that every morning on our computer desktop so it's not really necessary.  I will say though that the auto update of the firmware makes updating everything a breeze.  The usb port is also handy, I downloaded some break in images once I noticed the image retention, put them on a usb stick and ran it continuously when I wasn't watching movies for a couple of days and it played them very easily (this did nothing to lessen the image retention by the way, so I would not waste the time again).Plenty of ports on the television, quick delivery from amazon... replacement was a breeze as well for the damaged unit, with very friendly amazon customer service.

The shipping process was pretty benign.  Pilot, the company that shipped it, was in constant contact with me from the get.  The only issue was that they didn't deliver on weekends, so I had to authorize my apt to have them drop off the TV when I wasn't home.  I was a tad apprehensive of this, as I live on the third floor without elevators.  Thank goodness it arrived in one piece and flawless.  I did a lot of research before buying this plasma.  In fact, I was set on a Samsung LED edge lit when I walked into Best Buy one day and I started looking around.  One TV in particular caught my eye and it was the 50 inch pn50b650.  It was more lifelike with truer colors and deeper blacks when compared to any edge lit LED.  At that time I was set to buy the TV, but felt I must do my due diligence and research further.  I read all the rave reviews, but I also read about the dreaded buzzing.  Now, I'm not gonna lie to you...there is some buzzing, but its inaudible at practically all listening volumes, and I sit about 12 feet away.  So if you are concerned about that, don't be.  Second is image retention.  If you don't break the TV in, I suspect you may have an issue with this.  I was watching a basketball game on the CNET rec settings and had some image retention, but it quickly disappeared after using the scrolling function.  So my advice on that is to just take it easy for a while on color and brightness.  As for glare, I have a very brightly lit room during the day and at times there can be some glare, but I can just close the blinds.  It's a small sacrifice.  Now for the good stuff.  The pic on this is amazing...even now as i'm breaking it in.  Everything is lifelike and so true, unlike the way some LEDs make pictures seem kind of surreal..  I absolutely love this TV.  I've mounted it, hooked up my mirage nanostat 5.1 and am in Heaven.  Watched dark knight and was amazed.  If you are having any misgivings about this TV, don't..It's an unbelievable TV, esp for the price (I got it for 1139, but now I see its up to 1439, prob because it's discontinued.)  You can pay more than twice this amount for edge-lit LEDs and the picture won't be as good.  If you are set on an LED, then make sure you get local dimming.  Hope this review is helpful.  Also, if you are deciding between 650 or 850, the only difference is the thickness of the TV.  Cnet even states that blacks are deeper on the 650.

The look of the ToC was pretty cool, and even my kids commented on it. The internet connection was nice, but I can't see myself using this feature as it is slow. I had it connected direct with ethernet to cable modem @5mg, and was still slow. If I want to see these things I will go to my computer with much faster results.  The audio potion was the problem for me, because of a synq issue with my home theater equipment. I had an older Panasonic plasma that no problem at all with the A/V receiver and TV speakers being in synq. The Samsung sound was delayed from the receiver causing a bad echo that required you to turn off the TV sound to make it acceptable.Sometimes when I watch HD TV  shows I want just a little better sound from my receiver along with my Tv speakers. Called Samsung several times and finally was told to download a firmware update that was to take care of this issue. It only seemed to make it worse. I tried every setting on my Harmon Kardon receiver along with my PN50B650 with no luck. So back to Amazon it goes.  I tried a new Panasonic 54S1 and the sound is perfect. Not sure if Samsung has some issues with there sound, but Panasonic seems to have done there homework. Reading forums on this issue it seems I am  not the only one with sound problems.

Samsung still does not have a widget for streaming Netflix movies directly to the TV, so you need to use another device like the Samsung Blu-ray player for that.

Settled on the Samsung PN50B650 to get the plasma black-blacks and great motion clarity, the 24 frame-per-second refresh option (for movies) and the price advantage over equivalent LCDs.  Watched for a good deal on Samsung and grabbed it, along with the matching Samsung Blu-Ray player.  Delivery was quick and right on-time.  I'm very pleased with the seamless interaction between the TV and the Blu-Ray and would recommend ordering them together.  The remotes are cross-functional and now there's no more wresting the remote from my wife. I've been talking-up this TV / Blu-Ray at work and at least one other person has bought the same combination.  He's very satisfied, too.Two minor problems, one about the product and the other about the sales/delivery.  First, the product:  I set the TV on the pedestal mount but found that the \"post\" on the bottom of the TV was mal-formed, with metal bent where it shouldn't be bent, covering two of the four mounting screws.  Doesn't affect function or stability but shouldn't be that way.  So, about the sales/delivery:  I called the Samsung service number on the cardboard box, thinking the manufacturer would like to know about the mounting problem in case there's a recurring situation on the assembly line (I work for a technology manufacturer, and *I* would want to know about that kind of problem) but the Customer Service rep said there are \"no reported problems\" and only opened a ticket at my insistence.  Then he said I would have to call Amazon to actually get it fixed.  Amazon is always great at handling problems, but what would they do in this case?  Nobody knows how to actually fix anything anymore.  All they could do would be to send out another unit and I'd have to take some more time off work to meet the truck. So I didn't call Amazon and I'll get out my pliers after the warranty ends.  This problem would *not* affect a wall mount.  Oh, and the delivery guy who was supposed to deliver, unpack, and set-it up...he had to borrow a screwdriver from me.  Absolutely no tools on the guy !Anyhow--**buy** this TV / Blu-Ray !

Based on that, the features on this TV, and the significantly lower price compared to others, particularly other LCDs, I made the purchase.Once I got it set-up, I was curious to compare the picture quality of this TV to my existing 46\" LCD TV- a Sony KDL-46XBR5 - which I purchased a year and a half ago.  This TV was also the highest rated by Consumer Reports in it's screen size among LCD TVs when it came out.  As a result, my intent was to compare the 'best of breed' to some degree between LCD TVs and plasma TVs.  My expectation was that the plasma picture quality would be as good or better than my LCD TV, based on my research, the Samsung CR rating, and the fact that it was a newer TV.In doing the comparison, I went straight for the highest quality source- blu-ray discs- and viewed the same blu-ray discs on the same blu-ray player OPPO BDP-83 Blu-ray Disc Player with SACD & DVD-Audio with the same HDMI cable, connecting directly to each TV to eliminate any external factors that could effect the comparison.  I compared both older movie blu-ray discs (An American in Paris & Dr. No) and newer blu-ray discs (Da Vinci Code & Planet Earth).  Both of the TVs were viewed in dark rooms at night where glare or external lighting factors had no impact on picture quality.In each of the blu-ray discs I viewed, I found the Sony KDL-46XBR5 LCD TV had better picture quality.  The key differential was the near 3D quality of the LCD picture which the plasma was unable to match.  You can literally imagine that the action is taking place in the next room with the LCD blu-ray 1080p picture quality.  The plasma, with the same 1080p blu-ray source, simply did not provide that level of picture quality.  Both have excellent colors, contrast and handle motion pretty well (neither are without some very minor distortion if you look closely) but I found that the clear winner was the LCD TV in terms of picture quality.  I say clear winner because the difference was indeed noticable, which going into the comparison I wasn't sure if there would be a noticable picture quality difference between the two TVs.In terms of technical specifications, it is difficult to compare the two technologies (LCD vs. plasma) and in some ways comparisons can be misleading.  For example, the Sony KDL-46XBR5 LCD TV has 120hz motionflow for less distortion in viewing motion, while the Samsung PN50B650 plasma TV has 600hz sub-field motion technology.  If you just look at the numbers, and don't factor in the different technologies, you would think the Samsung plasma would handle motion better.  That is not the case.  I found no noticable difference between the two TVs in this regard.  Also, on paper, the contrast ratio of the Samsung plasma is also appears vastly superior (2,000,000:1 vs. 18,000:1) to the Sony LCD- but only on paper, however.  I found only a slight edge in contrast in favor of the Samsung plasma while actually viewing the picture quality on each TV.  In terms of color, the Sony LCD TV has 10-bit color processing and a 10-bit panel in addition to the 'deep color'and 'x.v.Color' color provided by both TVs.  Both have a 'Live Color Creation' technology (Sony) or 'Wide Color Enhancer3' (Samsung) that seem to be proprietary names for the same WCG-CCFL color technology.  In any case, I didn't notice any color difference in comparing picture quality between the two TVs.  Each have their proprietary processing engines that perhaps make a difference in picture quality, but again it is far from certain which technical specification or set of specifications will result in overall better picture quality.  I would use technical specifications to compare one specific area only (i.e. motion, contrast, color, etc.) on LIKE technologies (comparing one LCD to another or one plasma to another).  In comparing a plasma to an LCD, the technical specifications don't have any predictive value, in my experience, in pre-determining which TV has better picture quality- although they can help narrow the field to some degree.In any case, I don't know which technical specification or set of specifications would indicate which TV has better picture quality.  I don't know what spec to point to that would indicate that the Sony had the near 3D quality that the Samsung did not have- perhaps the video processing engine- but that is unclear to me.  Perhaps it is simply the limitation of plasma relative to LCD.  It's hard to say.  I can only say that what I view to be one of the best (but no longer cutting-edge) LCD TVs has better picture quality than one of the best (and fairly cutting-edge) plasma TVs.Even viewing all the TVs at the Best Buy store doesn't give you a definitive comparison in picture quality.  The settings on each TV at an electronics store can be set any number of ways, and the source player can be different, etc.  So even that visual comparison is not definitive.  For all the above reasons, a direct comparison is hard to achieve unless you have two TVs in a controlled setting viewing the exact same source on the exact same player with the exact same connection/cable with similar TV settings (i.e. both set to x.v. color, same picture mode (standard, dynamic, movie), best available motion setting, etc.).  This is why I thought this review may be helpful to those searching for a TV with the best picture quality.  In terms of any brand-name bias, I think it is hard to find better TV brands than Sony and Samsung in terms of picture quality, features, longevity, etc.  I personally would have a hard time looking past these two brands in favor of a Toshiba or Sharp or Pioneer- in part because I view the other brands as a little less reliable as TV manufacturers, with a bit more spotty picture quality on their TV products.  Samsung has a broader product offering than Sony (Sony doesn't make plasmas anymore) and generally is a bit more price competitive than Sony.  Sony does compete very well with Samsung head to head in picture quality when comparing each of their best TV models, however.In terms of other features, the Samsung PN50B650 has better media/internet connectivity features that have recently come out and only the more recent Sony LCD TVs have.  It is also worth noting that the Sony KDL-46XBR5 was roughly twice as expensive as the Samsung PN50B650.  However, this review is just a comparison of picture quality between the 'best of breed' LCD and plasma TVs.  I would add in this regard that the latest LCD TVs now have 240hz motionflow technology, further reducing the 'blur-factor' when displaying motion.  The Sony KDL-46XBR5 I compared only has 120hz motionflow.As a result of my comparison, the new Samsung PN50B650 plasma will now be my secondary TV, rather than the primary TV is was intended to be.  I'm not going to return it- unless it breaks down- because it does have very good picture quality- but it simply isn't better than my older LCD.  In defense of the Samsung plasma PN50B650, however, I would add that I have not (as of yet) experienced either the 'burn-in' or the buzzing issues that many have complained about in plasma TVs.  I also have not experienced any glare issues with the screen, and doubt that will  be an issue with this TV even in brighter rooms.Bottom line, to answer the question, \"Which TV has the best overall picture quality- the best plasma TVs or the best LCD TVs?\"  To my eyes, the answer is clear: the best LCD TVs provide better picture quality than the best plasma TVs.", "Date": "October 5, 2009"}, {"Title": "DON'T  LOOSE YOUR MONEY BUY THIS TV IT IS THE BEST TV IN THE MARKET", "Author": "Javier Barriga \"JavierBL\"", "ReviewID": "R270Q1XJ3KTMRV", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I love this tv.

About 6 months later I bought a smaller 32 inch Sharp 1080p LCD tv for the bedroom ,which is where I play most of my videogames. While the picture on the 32 inch screen was okay, I could really see why a lot of people say to get the most of a 1080p display you should go 50 inches or more.  Maybe 46, it all depends on how much space you have. Fast forward 2 years later, I was able to afford another tv, so I went with this Samsung plasma.Most of us heard about the negetives of plasma, like burn-in, and short lifespans, but plasmas' have come along way. The lifespan of plasma are just as good, as LCDs now, you can got to websites like [...] to really get real skinny on plasmas vs LCDs. However,lets be honest. No one is going to run a tv for 24 hours a day for 7-10 years straight, so the life of hdtvisn't much of an issue. As far as burn-in, current plasma technology has made that less of problem as well. Only burn-ins I have come from gaming, where shadows of a menu window that linger around for a minute or two when playing Xbox 360. Suprisingly no such types of burn-ins at all with PS3.Speaking of which, watching a Blu Ray movie with this particular tv is a complete joy with the 24p Cinema Smooth. PS3 owners just make sure to switch off game mode before watching a blu ray movie, trust me you will be glad your did.  As other reviewers have say watching standard def programing on this set is great, best picture I have seen on any hdtv I own. One way to really get a good Idea of what this particular plasma can do is to eyeball it next to a LCD screen of compariable size at a big box store. The colors and black levels are way richer on this plasma. The best thing about it the black levels is you get the proper amount of darkness without losing the subtle details, textures and ambient lighting, another plus for gamers as well. Again the only draw back I can see is the sound. Which iI purchased a realtively cheap soundbar to use with this tv, and that is more than enough for me. Most people will probably purchase a tv like this as the main family tv, so odds are most will have some sort of home theater option in place anyway.As for affordablity, I am just amazed that I paid only 100 bucks more this set than I did for my 32 inch LCD two years ago. Sometimes I consider putting this tv in my living room instead because it so much more advanced than my 61 inch DLP. Also finding an LCD display that has 3,000,000:1 contrast or better in a compariable size, and you are definitely moving towards the 2K price for one.All in all great picture, great price, great features.
