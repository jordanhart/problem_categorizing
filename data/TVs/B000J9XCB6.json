{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Great Picture But needs some feature changes", "Author": "DLinzo", "ReviewID": "R22BUJUD7GW0AD", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I purchased the 37\" version of this set and I'm overall satisfied. I'm reviewing here because it appears that the online store where I purchased it will only post absolutely glowing reviews. I purchased based on the fact that 98 reviews were all positive (4&5star). Here is what I tried to post there:Like the previous hundred people, I was impressed with the HD picture quality for such a reasonable price, $700.  It \"sometimes\" isn't as good as my 23\" Toshiba LCD that gets the \"over the airwave\" HD picture through a DigitalStream HD3150plus tuner with a HDMI cable.  I believe this may be due to the size of the Hannspree screen, 37\".  If you use the zoom feature and set it to \u00bd size, it is comparable to the Toshiba.  Anyone who has expanded a video file on a computer screen knows that it degrades if you get it too big.  Some TV shows are actually broadcast in a much smaller screen size, which you can see by pressing the \"Wide\" button and going to \"no scale\". One thing I found annoying with the zoom feature, that in my opinion, makes it useless, is when the white box  with a smaller black box inside, pops into the middle of the screen with the size (2x, 4x, 1/32, 1/2 etc.) also in the middle, to the right of the box, that's showing you how much you have zoomed.  The box and writing can't be turned off, so you can't actually watch anything in anything but the standard mode.  I'm hoping that there is some kind of a software upgrade to fix this in the future or Hannspree changes this in the next production.The next thing I found disappointing is that the POP/PIP (picture-in-picture) can't capture a picture from both the \"Airwave\" and \"Cable\" at the same time, for this feature.  You have to draw the second picture from another source such as a VCR, DVD, PC, or something through one of the HDMI connections.Then regarding a second and third source, the AV and S-vid connection use the same \"audio in\" connection, so you can only use one or the other OR constantly be plugging and unplugging audio depending on the source.  If one of your sources also has component or HDMI connection (as mine did) you can buy a new set of cables to overcome this problem.The last thing, that I find just plain stupid, is that the \"audio out\" is not controlled by the volume or mute switch.  Even my 17 year old 32\" TV was designed with that much foresight.  So if you have it hooked to an amp and speakers for better sound quality, you have to walk across the room to turn it down on commercials (that as you know, usually jack the volume up). I'm not sure if the SPDIF Optical output is controlled by the volume switch or not.My conclusion is that it is a good TV, but with a little thought by the designer, it could have been a great TV with little or no additional cost.  Time to go back to the drawing board.P.S. A signal strength meter would be a very nice feature to have. If I hadn't had one on my DigitalStream tuner, I could have never done the much needed, critical fine tuning on my antenna (aiming and tilting)that allowed me to pick up 3 additional over the airwave channels.", "Date": "April 19, 2007"}, {"Title": "Mediocre picture quality, faulty power supply", "Author": "Hannspree owner", "ReviewID": "R11OY4L96QNIJN", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I have owned this TV for over 5 1/2 years.
