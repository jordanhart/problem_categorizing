This is my first experience with HDTV and to say the least I am stunned.Since I am not experienced in the technology, I can't make an honest comparison with other TV's, but from looking at them in stores I can say that I am thrilled with my purchase and the picture is better than I had hoped. I just had DirecTV HD installed and dumped my cable company. I was nervous about this change but so far this has been a great move.My wife is not a football fan but she has been captivated by the picture and made the comment that the color is just so startling.I have read comments that the sound is less than great but it seems very acceptable to me. I have turned it up fairly loud and did not notice any distortion.I made the decision to go with rear projection technology because I thought the picture was great and at least as good as LCD or Plasma. So far I have no reason to question that decision. Amazon offered a great deal on this TV and it was delivered a day earlier than the estimate. I am a very satisfied Samsung and Amazon customer today.Jim", "Date": "September 6, 2007"}, {"Title": "Rear Projection IS NOT DEAD!!!", "Author": "M.

Set up took less than 5 minutes and before I could finish a cup of coffee I was watching my new TV. I made the necessary adjustments on my DirecTV box but was disappointed at the lack of clarity due to the SD broadcast (HD box in the mail). I then went to work hooking up my Xbox360 using component cables. All I can say is WOW! Gears of War, my favorite FSP is looking amazing. The detail and light contrast have to be seen to be believed.Some people turn their nose up at DLP becasue is is not LCD or Plasma. They are missing out! First of all, this TV is only 13 inches wide so the only disadvantage it has is that it is not wall mountable. Secondly, it is much more durable that the other two. If there is torque on the set, there is no worry of photocells bursting or anything like that. And finally, the PRICE!! DLP is so much cheaper for a TV this size.With the surround sound hooked up, this great set makes my smallish living room look and sound like a movie theater.", "Date": "September 28, 2007"}, {"Title": "Great buy!", "Author": "Kelly L.

Since my television warranty was through Circuit City I had no choice but to call a television repair person out to look at it. As soon as he walked in the door he knew what the issue was. He told me that the part would cost almost as much as the television and that his recommendation was to throw away the television and purchase another one. After doing some research I discovered that there were quite a few Samsung televisions that were going out and that the parts were on backorder for about a month. Samsung was also not helpful. I trying to discuss this with SamsungTweets on Twitter, but he blocked me when I asked why nobody called me like he said they would. The only other answer I got from Samsung was that I needed to take it to a service center; this is after I told them that a television repair person had looked at it. From what I can tell from looking on television repair forums, Samsung televisions look to be pretty flakey.", "Date": "June 22, 2009"}, {"Title": "Great TV", "Author": "G.

Shortly after buying it, it developed horizontal dark lines about 4\" apart eminating from both sides of the screen.  There was also an effect called \"shimmering\" which basically looked like out of focus contour lines around bright sections of the images.  Fortunately, I purchased an extended warrantly plan. Circuit City staff was excellent. A technician came out, examined the set and determined it was the light engine.  He came back a week later with the part and that greatly improved the picture quality.  Shortly after that, it has developed dark shimmering. It's very noticable in low light images, such as when the scene takes place in a dark room or outdoors at night.  The dark shimmering makes viewing scenes almost unwatchable. I'll calling for another service appt now.  I've always had excellent luck with Samsung products but I'd buy another set if I had to do it over again and do more research of owner's reviews.

Elkins", "ReviewID": "R32YV5TNZNNI8E", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I bought the TV about 7 months ago as I was moving into a dorm for college and I needed a new TV. While it is way bigger than I need for a dorm room I figued why not spend the extra money for a bigger TV then spend 150-300 on a little 20inch when I'd be buying a larger TV later when I live in an apartment. At the time this was around $875 and was the best deal out there.I was wary at first as there are many complants with these kind of systems. However, I have never had a problem with unit. I think it has been more than I expected. While it is a 720 and not 1080 I don't think there is much difference. While I am in a dorm I don't have a normal array of HD channels, but I do get your basic CBS/NBC channels in HD and they look completely crystal clear. I can't make a noticable difference from the 720 to 1080. The only time you can really tell the difference is if your in a store and a 720 is next to a 1080. Since it is a rear projection it is lamp lit and other complained of the lamp light flowing out from the vents in the back. I don't really notice this, even in with all the lights off. If you have it directing against a wall then you can see it, but it's not enough to be bothersome and if you wish can be easily blocked. Only con is the warm up and warm down as it is a bulb light, but it only takes a few seconds. I wouldn't turn it off and on rapidly or leave it on constantly as the bulb will burn out faster.", "Date": "April 8, 2008"}, {"Title": "Best TV for the price", "Author": "ebad", "ReviewID": "R1RSIEV02WFHF7", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I bought mine for $899 during the pre-Christmas sales at Best Buy - can't beat that price. The TV takes a little longer to start up (15-20 sec) than I  would like, but once it's going, it has a beautiful picture. Have my Toshiba HD-DVD, HD cable, and my Xbox360 hooked up to it, and the picture quality is AMAZING. It's in a room with windows to the left of the TV, but the picture still looks vibrant and there is little to no reflection off the screen. You  would do well to buy a calibration DVD to work on the contrast, brightness, etc., but overall, it's a great piece of electronics for a great price.

I've never seen a 1080 model, so I can't compare the picture quality, but the 720 is fine by me.Are there any downsides to the TV?  I couldn't find any major problems.  When you turn the TV on, it takes about 30 seconds for the picture to fully light up.  The remote control also seems to respond a tad slow.  But these are minor issues.

My TV arrived well before the estimated delivery date given and WHAT A PICTURE!!  I went with the 720p for a couple of reasons.  1. Price - You simply cannot beat the quality this set delivers for the price point.  2. Everything is being broadcast at 720p or 1080i.  The only thing actually delivering a full 1080p is Blu-Ray and HD-DVD.  I haven't decided what type of player I'm getting until the format war is over.

H. \"Hatchman\"", "ReviewID": "R13GZHVNTGL3DM", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "After hearing about this great TV from a Co-worker, I had to get one myself.  The current price at $879 here at Amazon with free shipping makes this the best TV at the this price on the market.  Sure, it's only a 720p, but it looks great to me.  This is my first HDTV, and I am very satisified.  I had to swap out my cable box for an HD box at my local cable company, but the box swap didn't cost a thing, and I got every movie channel free for a day, so it was worth it.I tried the regular coaxial cable and the S video connection, but the picture still looked the same.  I found a set of component cables that came with my new cable box and BAM!, there was the awesome picture I was expecting.  I've got an HDMI cable on the way, so the picture might get even better.  Just don't pay the $80 and up the CC/BB wants for Monster cables, Amazon is selling an HDMI cable for $1.20 at this time.The only bad thing is, this awesome TV is better than my current Sony DVD player.  Compared to my new HDTV channels, watching a DVD now looks crappy, for lack of a better word.  So... I've ordered an Oppo upconverting DVD player, that upconverts to 1080i and 720p, from Amazon, so I'm looking forward to seeing my old DVD's in new life.The factory preset \"dynamic\" and \"store\" video settings are pretty bad.  Make sure you change the operation mode from \"Store\" to \"Home\", otherwise every time you turn the TV on and off, you'll have to reset all of your video settings, since they will not be saved.  Once you go to home, all the setting will be save for each source.  After a few hours of tweaking, I finally got the picture looking awesome!  I've heard this set takes some tweaking, and they were right.  But once you know what needs adjusting, it's a piece of cake.So GOODS:Great value, best TV at this price on the marketGreat pictureSharp looking, I love the slim frame and black piano look, very clean.Very slim for a projection TV, and pretty light too!  Weighs about half as much as my old Sony 32\" tubeOthers:A little bit of white light can be seen shining out from behind on the left side (looking at the set).  Can really only be seen if the room is completely dark and could be concealed with a little ingenuity.Sound is not all the great, but I already have a Harmon Kardon/Infinity subs, etc, so I have never used any of my TV's speakers anyway.  You will want some kind of sound system to get the full effect.Only 720p, but too be honest, this thing looks great and such a huge jump in quality from my old \"tube\", I don't even care.  And I haven't hooked it up with an HDMI cable so the picture and sound quality may get even better.The last other, vertically the picture looks a little different.  This TV needs to be viewed straight on.  In other words, it looks just a little different if you're laying on the couch or sitting straight up, almost like there is a little line or shadowing.  If you put the TV at eye level, it looks great, but if you're laying on the floor (for some reason) or standing up, the top or bottom of the screen make a little darker.  This is very minor, and really only noticable when your standing up or sitting down.  Once I get settled if I'm laying on the couch, I don't notice it at all, so this is no big deal.  But if someone mounts this real high on a shelf so the screen is perfectly vertical, they will have some shadow banding problems.  Once again, put it at the eye level you plan on watching it at, and it's perfect.Hope this helps someone, someday.

It cost me $3,000 and was a good price at that time.  I bought an extended warrantee because I wanted to take no chances. I haven't needed the warrantee or any kind of service. It was a little challenging learning about the set's adjustments, but I expected, and got, the best picture I ever imagined! The only picture problems I have had were the fault of the cable company, e.g., low signal strength or poor connections within the cable box, and not the T.V.  I would get another one of these in a second, but I would put it through it's paces immediately, and if it weren't perfect, I would return it! And it's lightweight... I got a stand for it at Walmart for $69 that works fine.  I'd say buy one, but make sure your particular set is working right and make sure you can return it if it isn't!", "Date": "July 25, 2007"}, {"Title": "Great TV", "Author": "J.

The picture is \"grainy\" (for lack of a better term, it's actually grainy/sparkly/generally terrible looking) on all sources.  Oh well, although it can't be returned I can use Samsung's warranty and have the problem fixed, I'm not concerned at this point.  Samsung set up an appointment with a local TV repair place and they came out and looked at the set.  The tech didn't know what the problem was and decided that the screen needed to be replaced (he insisted it was on backward and that was what was causing the poor picture).  Weeks later the tech returned with a new screen but scratched the new one while trying to install.  ALthough I would need a new screen (he also scratched the original trying to put it back in the set) we noticed that the problem was still present with the new screen in place and the tech decided it was a problem with the light engine.  Again I wait for weeks while a new screen is ordered and finally he returns with the screen - but no new light engine.  The screen is replaced, nothing is better and the tech leaves.  Throughout the entire process I had been contacting Samsung and telling them I didn't think that the service person knew how to fix the problem and this was just more proof.  I called Samsung yet again, they called the service center (who said that it was fixed, even though it definitely was not and the light engine was never mentioned again), and customer support (supposedly executive customer support) said they would have to find a new service center.  Again I wait weeks for a call back, finally I have to call Samsung to find out the status.  I was asked to send in digital pictures of the problem so I did, but with the caveat that the resolution of my camera can probably not pick up the problem that I am seeing.Anyway, last week I was called by Samsung and they have finally decided that my set is \"in spec\".  They made this decision based on a few lower quality digital pictures and refuse to service my set for this problem.  I am stuck at this point with a TV that does not have a sharp picture and there is nothing I can do about it other than spend more money on a new set.Before you buy any Samsung product I would suggest thinking long and hard.  They do make some quality products but if you have a problem with it I would not expect their warranty service to help you in any way whatsoever.", "Date": "May 31, 2007"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "Unavailable", "Features": "50\" Slim DLP HDTV\n1280 x 720-pixel resolution; 2,500:1 Contrast ratio\nMeasures 45.2\"(W) x 31.8\"(H) x 13.4\"(D) 56.7 Lbs.\nConnections: 2 HDMI, 2 S-Video, 2 Composite, 2 Component Video Input, 2 Monitor and sound out, 1 PC (RBG) in, 1 PC audio input\nTwo stereo speakers, 10 watts apiece (20 watts total); SRS TruSurround XT virtual surround", "Name": "Samsung HLT5075S 50-Inch Slim 720p DLP HDTV", "ImgURL": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41ebEf%2BLq1L._SX300_.jpg", "ProductID": "B000N50R6O"}}
