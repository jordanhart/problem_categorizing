I finally got Dish Network HD installed and was looking forward to watching this tv in HD.I was very disappointed with how it handles the standard 16x9 aspect ratio.  In the 'normal' viewing mode, the screen displayed my HD image in 4x3.  Everyone looked skinny and tall.  I had to change the viewing mode to 'wide 1' to get the image to go all the way on the sides.  However, there were still black bars on the top and bottom.  I checked the Dish Network receiver and verified it was outputting a 720p signal at 16x9.  I even used the 'info' button on the Vizio remote to verify it was receiving a 720p signal.  It was, it just wasn't displaying it correctly.I contacted Vizio support and they spent quite a bit of time telling me the Dish receiver was setup wrong.  I have 2 of these receivers and 2 other HD tv's.  I tested the receiver on the other tv's and it displayed correctly, no black bars.  Vizio CSR sent me 'level 3' support.  They told me I had to pay to ship the tv to their repair facility.  They would not come out to my house because the tv was smaller than 32''.So they have a defective tv, in warranty, and they want me to pay to ship it to them and then wait for 3 weeks for them to look at it.  I will not buy another Vizio product.  If you're looking for a disposable tv that you're willing to discard when it has a problem, than maybe Vizio is for you.  Not me.", "Date": "August 7, 2009"}, {"Title": "Good LCD, but cable port breaks alot", "Author": "John Studt", "ReviewID": "R7AJ5G9L8P6AO", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "This is the second TV of this model/brand which I purchased from Walmart; I had to replace it because the cable TV hookup stopped receiving a signal, after about 60 days of use.
