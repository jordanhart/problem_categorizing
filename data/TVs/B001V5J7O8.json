It seems to be an excellent TV and I would have given it 5 stars except for one thing.  It has only one optical audio out and no RCA type audio outputs.  That means I cannot run the audio out to a simple old amp to power my external speakers.  I would need to buy a newer amp with optical audio inputs.  The optical gives 5.1 audio, but I don't have that sort of setup and do not have any 5.1 audio coming in anyway.  Other than that it is doing a fine job.  I have DVD, cable to the TV tuner, Tivo, PC-VGA and a cable set top box all coming in with inputs to spare.  I went through hours of comparisons and feature filtering and am happy with the result.", "Date": "April 23, 2009"}, {"Title": "Awesome", "Author": "MJ", "ReviewID": "R3T2RPK2DRD77F", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "So here's the deal, I compared the 2008 model of this LG with a comparable Sony and Samsung.

As of this writing (mid March 2009) the 2009 model will be out approximately next week.  The store I bought from gave me $100 discount if I bought and waited for the new model to arrive.

I had an expert set it up when I got Dish Network installed, so that it would work seamlessly with the receiver. (Which it did). The picture is clear, as clear as the 37\" Sony Bravia's picture is in another room, and the LG cost at least $300.00 less.

It is the simplest interface and remote I have ever seen associated with a television of this level of picture quality.  I've never had to look at a manual or figure out how to hook up various boxes to it; it's always just worked.

So far, I am thrilled.  The picture is fantastic - I feel like I can reach right in and touch the people on the HD channels.  I am not an ultra-techie, but it more than serves my purposes.  My husband took about 15 minutes to get it set up from opening the box (delivered very quickly, btw) until we were watching.  At first I thought the sound was a bit off, but after tinkering with the settings and getting to the simulated surround sound, I now think it's great.  I know some people say you should have higher than 60hz with a TV this size and maybe they're right, but after a weekend of watching regular programming and football I don't think I could be any happier with the picture.", "Date": "November 30, 2009"}, {"Title": "Great Value", "Author": "K.

Armstrong", "ReviewID": "R3F8THSS2H98UK", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "This is our main TV and it has worked flawlessly for about a month now.  The size was determined by the custom entertainment corner unit we had built a few years ago.  37\" was the largest that would fit.  It's good looking with nice fit and finish details.  The delivery service Amazon provided was very good.  They unpacked the unit and powered it up on the floor because I had not removed the very heavy big old tube TV.  They installed batteries in the remote and turned on the set to assure the screen and sound were functioning.  I connected it to my analog cable service (not HDTV) but was disappointed to see it had only one cable/antenna input.  I was planning to get free HDTV from my local stations off my antenna.  But that would have required me to install a separate switch to disconnect the cable and connect the antenna every time I wanted to get HDTV. I called my cable company to see if they would provide a DVR unit with HDMI output rather than the coax cable type.  They could but only if I agreed to pay 3-4 dollars per month more for digital cable service.  That was less than I expected so I setup an appointment to get it.  Mean time we watched the analogue cable service.  I was not impressed.  I think the picture was less clear than my old TV.  All thoughts of returning the unit disappeared as soon as the digital cable was connected.  Picture quality is now excellent!  I am very happy with the set over all.  Sound quality is also very good.  Controls are a little complicated but it is easy to learn the basics and it works well with the Cable's DVR and  remote.", "Date": "October 22, 2009"}, {"Title": "LG 37\" LCD HDTV", "Author": "Gary Telleck", "ReviewID": "R13YJP8UK3C5H8", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Perfect size and great quality for my master bedroom. easy to setup and the picture and sound quality is very good. 3rd LG purchased and will probably buy more without hesitation.", "Date": "January 7, 2013"}, {"Title": "I loved this TV", "Author": "W.

This is very important especially if youare watching sports.The \"pixels\" in a 60hz cannot keep up with fast actionthus causing a slight blur in the pic.Unfortunately the description of this TV did not even mentionthe HZ.Makes me wander why cause it seems the makers aredumping the lesser 60hz sets. Well, walla, answer:A newer & better 240hz is just on the horizon. 4 timesthe pixels & picture quality.Guess it`s like everything else.

Chu", "ReviewID": "R11V6PL2Y0KGOY", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I'm not a power user for HDTV's - I wanted a 37\" 1080P TV for my bedroom, and had amazon coupons to burn so I took the plunge on this one.  For the money there are a lot of better priced competitive options out there, especially in the 40-42\" range, but I specifically wanted 37\".  In addition, I wanted 1080P from the VGA port...this is NOT something most mfrs put in as standard because they assume you will run 1080P via HDMI.  Amazon delivered it quick and the picture is fine - I really have no way to compare other than it 'looks' good to me.  I will say though, if I had to do it again, 37\" 1080p for a bedroom is overkill.  I could have gotten away with 32\" 720p and it would have been good enough and saved myself some money.", "Date": "March 10, 2010"}, {"Title": "Picture is streached sideways", "Author": "H.
