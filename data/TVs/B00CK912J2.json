{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Exactly what I was looking for, great computer monitor and TV combo", "Author": "J Sizzle", "ReviewID": "R380QBQV4ZD5MC", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I have been very pleased with this purchase.  The image is great, and it displays text very well for use as a computer monitor for a Macbook Air (using a display port to HDMI connector to run it through the HDMI port on the monitor).  I've also verified that it does have a TV tuner build in and a port for the antenna coax style cable, and it works perfect for that.  The sound is also more than adequate for a screen of this size.  All in all, I couldn't be much happier.The only minor complaint is that it can be a bit wobbly if I nudge my table too harshly, but I didn't discount a star for this because my table is already a little unstable as it is, so it may not be the entire fault of the monitor.Update: I recently hooked my XBox 360 up to this via HDMI, and it also worked great for that use as well (playing games, watching Netflix, etc).  So, it seems to be an all-around winner!", "Date": "November 26, 2013"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "$402.53", "Features": null, "Name": "LG Electronics 23\" IPS - LED Digital TV Monitor 1080P", "ImgURL": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51hMann855L._SY300_.jpg", "ProductID": "B00CK912J2"}}
