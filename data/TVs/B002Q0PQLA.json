The set worked great for a year and then failed miserably.  SONY Support changed parts in the media center, set worked fine for a week then failed again.  It's been down for two months now because SONY support is wholly incompetent.  No relief in sight.Retiring the set and switching to Samsung.  Good-bye SONY.**************I've had the set for 30 days now.  I had some early concerns on the whole Edge-Lighting thing but they turned out to be frivolous.  The picture has been outstanding.  Played Dark Knight and Underworld, and the set handled the contrasts and deep blacks superbly.The thin design is a work of art.  My set sits on a console (not mounted) and sets the room off nicely; no visible wires and elegant design.The streaming functions are a nice feature; good integration with Amazon and Netflix.  However, I'm pouzzled as to why there doesn't appear to be a way to access free internet content via portals like Hulu, TV network sites and such, without a laptop.  (Or I haven't figured it out yet.)One mild annoyance that has more to do with Sony than the XBR10: No wireless internet dongle available from Sony.  The Samsung version only works with Samsung products. So if you don't have a Ethernet port nearby, you'll need a wireless bridge to use a wireless home network.", "Date": "December 21, 2009"}, {"Title": "Warning : Failed after 1 year, If you have to have a Sony XBR then buy Extended Warranty or BUY another brand", "Author": "T. Lam \"Gizmo2010\"", "ReviewID": "RYGLBC150UBP3", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "Here's my story, hope someone can learn from my tragic mistake. Furthermore, I just realized the LCD panel is actually made by Samsung NOT Sony. If you buy a Sony TV; why is the LCD Panel (the most important and expensive part of the TV) is made in Korea by Samsung.  The picture might be good but how long will it last.....for me it only lasted 1 year and 4 months.  Also If you do a simple search on Amazon you will find that Amazon does not sell Sony XBR LCD TV directly anymore since I guess they have so many complaints from their customers on the Sony LCD TV. Go ahead look and see you can find Amazon selling Sony XBR LCD TV directly...Amazon actually refer you to another brand like LG or other brands when you are looking any Sony XBR LCD TVs.....and my Full Story below:5/9/2010- I brought the Sony XBR series TV on Amazon about 1 year and 4 months ago and now the TV have failed. The picture quality was amazing until just yesterday the picture started to degrade and now it has green clouds and rainbows all over the pictures. I just call the Sony authorize tech service from they said it will cost me $75 for the in house service since it's out of warranty. They also said that if it's the LCD panels has failed then it would cost as much as the TV itself. This is my first LCD from Sony but I have 3 other Sony TVs- 1 30\" Sony CRT, 1 47\" XBR rear projection and 1 65\" XBR rear projection TV. All the previous Sony TVs had no problem at all and I am still using the 65\" rear projection TV. What happen to Sony's quality and reliability product? I guess it went to the same place as other first rated Japanese products like Toyota. They are just too busy on cutting cost and lower their reliabilities so they can rack in the billion dollars profit. So if you like the picture quality of Sony TVs; be advice to buy their extended warranty.  I wish I did because if the LCD panel failed then my LCD TV is just a big 52\" black picture frame hanging on the wall.  If you really, really have to get a Sony XBR LCD TV then I would recommend to get 5 years extended warranty plan for $299-it will save you a lot of frustration. And after 5 years, you will probably do a upgrade anyway.5/11/2010 update: Today the tech came and verified that the LCD panel has gone bad after 1 year and 4 months of service. In the tech's own words-the panel is a factory defect since it should not failed after just a little over a year of service and that I should call Sony and see they will reimburse the cost of the panel. I am so disappointed on the product since I did not just buy any Sony TV but the top of the line XBR series TV. I called Sony and told them the whole story but they just told me to fax all the documents -receipt and repair cost to Sony and they will evaluate it. I will wait and see what happen - but at this point I am really disappointed and frustrated with the whole thing! :-(Update: 5/13/2010-Just received a call from Sony \"Customer Relations\" today.  It's official-Sony don't stand behind their products.  They will not pay for the cost of their defective LCD panel since it's out of warranty (1 year) after 1 year and 4 month of service. They just lost a loyal customer. No more Sony products in my house.  Sony customer relations representative even has the nerve to offer me $900 reimbursement on a $$3517.75 repair cost. That's right-I will have to pay $2617.76 to fix my $2018.88 LCD TV.  So if you buy a Sony TV and you have a defective LCD panel after 1 year of use then you can just throw that TV in the trash because Sony will tell you go F yourself and trash the TV.  Good luck on buying a Sony LCD TV because you going to need it-and looks like from my research, I am not the only customer that have a defect LCD panel after 1 year.  In fact, the LCD panel is not even made by Sony but Samsung made in Korea.  Samsung LCD Panels have notoriously for premature failure of their LCD panels.  So no more Sony LCD for me or should I say Samsung LCD TV ....", "Date": "May 12, 2010"}, {"Title": "Best TV in the world", "Author": "Nico Katz", "ReviewID": "R23OMMA64AOK7S", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I've had my KDL52-XBR10 since mid-December.  WOW!  Beautiful design.  The picture quality is mind-blowing.  Watching the Winter Olympics in HD is amazing, you can see every hair in detail.  The colors are spectacular and the blacks are DEEP.  240 Hz Motion Flow makes everything smooth.  The picture is spectacular right out of the box, but you also have complete control over picture (and sound).  Settings, inputs, Internet, and other options are accessible via the well-thought out on-screen Xcross Media Bar.  To access the Internet or your home network directly from the XBR10, you'll either need a hard-wired Ethernet connection between the XBR10's media box and your router, or a wireless bridge (e.g. Linksys WET610N) connected to the media box to access your wireless router (e.g. Linksys WRT610N).  I chose the wireless option and it works flawlessly.", "Date": "February 24, 2010"}, {"Title": "XBR10 : Window on the world!", "Author": "Claude Lanouette \"Paperless Searcher\"", "ReviewID": "R2E9A5JPZOOCT", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Owning this set since December, and after viewing many series like the Tudor or Rome, plus many Criterion and BBC Opus Arte Blu-Rays, having also this set hooked to a PS3 to enjoy 1080p racing games like Gran Turismo, there is only one expression to summarize the viewing experience : a window on the world! The latest shock : Avatar!Previously ownner of a XBR 800 CRT 34 incher, jumping to 52 inches was an incredible experience. But please don't sit too far!
