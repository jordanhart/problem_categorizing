I wasn't expecting great things because of the relatively low price but the picture quality is amazing, better than the other 3 LCDs in our home.  The HD picture is so clear that it took getting use to because the images seemed so real.  It has an ambient light sensor which dims the screen light in dark and brightens it in daylight.  I found it gets too dark at night for my liking.  To disable the ambient sensor follow this sequence on the remote (Menu - Picture - More - Advanced Picture - Ambinet Light Sensor - off).

The picture is brilliant, vivid, sharp, and blacks are nice and dark. The smooth motion effect takes some getting used to because at times it may make a movie or show look like it's in fast forward when the camera is panning- I suggest keeping it on the \"Medium\" setting to counter this.

Baum", "ReviewID": "R2IBXMPKI97SJP", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Purchased the TV yesterday, so I have not yet experimented with all of the features, and can't speak to the quality or longevity of HDMI, etc. yet.I experienced the same issue as a prior reviewer with IR interference.  I use a Logitech Harmony remote to control the TV, Dish Network satellite receiver, and a Yamaha AV receiver.  Replacing the prior TV with the Vizio E470VL reduced the functionality of all of my other IR remotes significantly.  They all still worked, but you had to aim the remote directly at the device and be very deliberate in pressing the buttons.  With the TV turned off, or even covered with a blanket, the other IR remotes worked normally.In googling, I discovered this isn't an uncommon issue, and not an issue limited to this manufacturer or model.  Lots of televisions emit IR that can interfere with remote controls.  I also stumbled on a resolution.  Turning off the Ambient Light Sensor seems to all but eliminate the problem.  All my remotes work fine now!I hooked up a USB card reader to the USB port to view pictures on an SD card from a camera. It worked great, and the detail and clarity is amazing.  I also hooked up a laptop via the VGA port and got a beautiful 1920 x 1080 display.  Makes me want two of these for my desk, but I'd need a significantly larger desk..", "Date": "July 29, 2010"}, {"Title": "You really cannot beat the value-cost ratio with this TV", "Author": "Loren W \"Loren W\"", "ReviewID": "R3COZXSZEOE7M4", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I was really surprised to only see a few reviews for this television. I read the reviews for this TV on Amazon.com, [...], and a few others that I cannot recall names for at the moment. I am the type of consumer that enjoys doing the homework before going out to purchase a new electronic device. I want the best balance for quality and value.I purchased my E470VL from Costco (8/29/10) for $[...] ( -$[...] instant rebate), only $[...]! Including a box a frozen pizza's the total was under $750 with tax.Upon opening the box and assembling the stand, everything went together nicely. They put that nice clear protectors all of the TV to protect is from scratches. I just moved into a new place so I cannot testify to using the HDMI or VGA ports. I do however have digital cable with some HD channels and I have to say that the picture and sound from this TV are fantastic if you are not on a PRO A/V level. Any average TV/Gamer/Movie watcher would be really happy with this television.There are lots of features to tweak and adjust if needed, which is nice. The one thing I didn't like was the way certain channels came up on the screen some in normal, others in full screen, etc. I have a feeling this was the broadcasting and not the television though.I would give this TV a true 4.5/5 stars due to the quality/cost value that is achieved from this great unit.PROS:47\" is big.... for my tiny living room.120Hz.... not 240 but much cheapertrue 1080P =)plenty of ports/connections on the reargreat picture quality!lots of menu featuressound great for STOCK TVCONS:Actual TV buttons (input,power,volume,etc) on side of TV are kind of cheesy (look cheap)The USB does not play video =(No Internet Apps.... As of 8/10 they still cost a bit more than $700...I say go for it at this time, TV is still a great value for the cost.

Kelley", "ReviewID": "R2YZFUEONNOCXL", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This review is for the 32\" and the 47\" Vizio as I have recently bought one of each. As far as I can see the menus, remotes and operations of the two units is identical. The screen size is the only difference.The picture is bright and sharp on both units. The 47\" is hooked to 1080 HD (I use DishNetwork HD receiver) via HDMI cable and it is impressive - as you might expect for HD. The 32\" is hooked to the coaxial input distribution system I use at my home and it is also a top notch picture for a simple coaxial cable hookup. However, please note that there is NO S-Video input at all and the COMPOSITE input (single yellow RCA cable) simply plugs into one of the three RGB COMPONENT RCA inputs. That's maybe a bit confusing but not a deal breaker for me.The remote is full featured as it controls screen size, input selection, Closed Caption and the like with dedicated buttons. Very convenient. The remote also accesses an extensive menu system that allows detailed adjustments of audio and video. Also found in the menu is a JPG viewing feature that allows you to watch slide shows and sort photos by plugging in a common USB drive. I plug the SD card from my camera into a USB card reader adapter, plug it into the Vizio, and review my photos right out of the camera. The USB jack on the rear left is a little difficult, but not impossible, to get to if the TV is flush mounted on a wall.PROS - these are not top of the line TV's, but I am of the opinion that most TV's have a pretty good picture if set up correctly. I use an Avia DVD to calibrate and it really does make a difference. I never use factory or preset audio or video settings - I turn them all off. More on that later as it pertains to complaints about poor audio performance from some reviewers. Also, the manual is written well and is useful and concise. I address the audio issues below but can say that the small stereo speakers on this TV sound pretty good although a bit weak in the deep bass. (Please note that anyone running this TV via HDMI but not using a surround audio system is missing half the fun of HD TV - namely the great stereo or 5 channel audio now available on most HD channels).CONS - I have noticed that once or twice the TV has turned off when I hit the EXIT button on the remote. While clearly a harmless software glitch, it has happened so infrequently that I debated even mentioning it. However, some others may have had more serious trouble with that issue so in the interest of full disclosure I mention it here.There are also complaints from reviewers concerning audio being too loud, too soft, and the volume going up and down! Folks, please turn off all audio enhancements on your receiver/cable box and the TV. Useless stuff with silly names like \"Super Surround\", \"Big Bass Synthesizer\", \"Wide Sound Enhancer\" \"Video SuperSharp\" and other useless factory settings should be turned off and left off! Check you receiver, your Vizio menus, and anything else in the signal chain and turn all of that extra crap off. Think about it, if you have both the receiver and the TV doing strange things to the pure, clean digital audio/video feeds - there is no telling how all those settings may affect each other. Did I mention turning off all audio/video helpers, enhancements and conditioners? If you want big sound buy a 5.1 surround system. Even the cheap ones sound pretty good these days and watching HD TV without 5.1 surround is like eating Oreos without any milk. This also explains why some of us really don't care how the TV sounds as we never use our TV speakers/audio at all!COMPARISON - my cheap 47\" Vizio looks better than my neighbors very expensive 50\" Sony TV. We both have DishHD service, we both use an HDMI cable and are using 1080i resolution. Why does my cheap tv have a better picture? Simple - buy or borrow a calibration disk and take 30 minutes to set up your TV - then write down the settings for future use if needed. I use an Avia but there are others just as good. IMHO most people would be hard pressed to tell the difference between these TV's and the high priced units some people buy - particularly if the video is calibrated correctly. If browsing in a showroom, be careful to ignore picture brightness as a selling feature as every TV salesperson knows that uninformed buyers will go for the brighter picture every time.Lastly, please be kindly advised that any digital HDMI or Fiber Optic cable will provide pristine, perfect audio and video feeds. The nature of digital means that the cable either works or it doesn't! The cheap HDMI cables sold here at Amazon and elsewhere will provide exactly the same 1080iHD picture and 5.1 audio as the \"Super Monstrosity Mega\" cable for ten times more money. Sales people may tell you different, they may even believe their lies, but I have no reason to lie to you as I don't want to sell you anything. One caveat though - if you are running a long HDMI cable run (say 25 feet or longer), you could have trouble trying to use a super cheap HDMI cable.I really appreciate the thoughtful reviews of others as a valuable buying tool and I hope this review has helped you too.

Unfortunately, after a week, all the HDMI ports were dead!  So I returned it and got an identical model.  Worked fine for a while, but after about another week, HDMI port #2 died.  Called Vizio, they tried to trouble shoot it, but did not succeed.  They told me they were going to send me a replacement.  A couple days later, I get a call from Vizio.  They said they didn't have that TV in stock and didn't have anything comparable to swap it out for.  They told me they would issue a refund.  A freight company would come to my house, pack up the TV, and I'd get a refund within 3 weeks!  I said forget it.  Took it back to Wal-Mart, and got a Samsung 46\" which works like a dream.

As always, Amazon rendered a fantastic deal ($563) and with an outstanding merchant (PILTRADER). All the 5 star reviews are right on. Pay little attention to the negs; they either had one of those rare or ocassional defective products (stuff happens you know) or lacked comprehension of product/product info. I am usually a high-end and  'reputable name brand' purchaser. However, I was not willing or ready to purchase a name brand HDTV at those rediculously premium prices. So I opted to buy this model as a result of all the good reviews. I figured I'd learn the new HDTV technology on this model, while waiting for advances and low prices to take hold of the market. Boy!! Was was I surprised and greatly impressed by this unit. I have seen all of the top brands in showrooms...and this does not take a step backward in comparison of sound or picture quality. In fact, sound is much better than most, and picture quality is absolutely stunning. I must say that I was in awe of this Vizio HDTV for quite some time after recieving it.

I did get this at a big box store because they had some sales prices that even Amazon couldn't beat.  If you are not a TV guru needing to have the latest and greatest and want a big TV this is for you.  I upgraded from a 40 inch Sony Bravia from a big box store and it is night and day size and quality.I had always thought Vizio was some junk brand and you'd have to check your \"man card\" in for buying one.  But the 2010 line of Vizio LCD are really good.When you do get one of these, like the other reviewers mention TURN OFF the auto motion and other supposed settings that are to help picture quality.  These are on by default and I immediately though I made a mistake.  Watching a football game was like being in a cave and had that silent movie pciture effect going on.  Turn those settings off (which make it brighter and probably raise your electric bill) and it was really good.Note if you are going to buy one to ensure you are getting the E470VL (and not VA) as the VA might be cheaper but it is lesser quality IMO.  Also make sure you are getting the 2010 version of this.  You'll know because the 2009 version had this ugly very large clear section under the TV.  Because I liked this TV so much, I recently purchased an E550VL (the 55\" version of this guy) and the big box store I got it from tried pulling a fast one and brought the old one to the register.

After tweaking the settings (including turning off the ambient light sensor) I was able to get the picture looking pretty good.

It was very prominent when it was on an input that was not receiving a signal and got a little quieter when a signal was coming in.  The buzzing was not loud, but definitely noticeable and something I knew would consistently bug me.

Back at the store, I could not pass up the less than $700 deal on the Vizio E470VL 47\" LCD.

I got it around the superbowl season & totally watched the game on it & lemme tell you, I've never seen the game look that good in my life except in real life of course.

I returned it for a full refund to Target and bought a Samsung 46\" and have been very happy with it.  That is the new L6 version (630 model, and it cost $200 more but it was well worth it.

The TV is good, picture is good, but a two year old TV should not have component failure like this.The IR sensor on the TV went out.

The part is inexpensive <$10.00, but they will ship a main board also just in case, so $251 with labor to install, and if the main board is ok (which they say is typically the case), the total will be $152.00.Without this issue, this TV would be a 4 star (4.5 if there was a choice).Perhaps they fixed this in the newer models, I would hope so. So if you are OK with some inconvenience, and additional costs, it is a good TV, but I expected no issues so soon, so two stars from me.

And what I found is that even though Vizio is a relative new comer to the marketplace (when compared to the likes of Sony and Panasonic even Toshiba), these young Upstarts look as if they mean business and plan on being in the game for a while... which means a lot.Ok so let's get to it shall we?I wish this model had a swivel base!  Don't sweat this, just get yourself a good Wall-mount that has tilt and can swivel.I wish this model had a S-Video input! Guess this means that I will just have to use one of the S-Video inputs on my Receiver if I ever need a S-Video input. (Who uses S-Video anymore anyway)I wish this model had more than just one set of Component Inputs! Again I guess I'll just have to use one set of the Passive Component inputs on my receiver if I need more than one (The Best video source BAR NONE).Ok so those are the main hang-ups I have with this TV.  Everything else, Hardware and Connections wise is a wash, right? I mean you get a USB port, PC-RGB input, more than enough HDMI crappy ports, composite input, Optical output blah blah blah blah......I love that any picture adjustments that I may make for one source is only for that one source. This means that if I adjust the picture for the Computer video input, it will not change picture settings for my Satellite or my BR-player or my Roku.One of the best features or capabilities of this TV lies in its ability to help me to decide between using a HDMI input or using Component input.  With this TV's POP feature, I can simultaneously display HDMI DirectTV as well as Component DirectTv , side by side full screen. (DirectTv receiver has both HDMI and Component Outputs). The proof is in the pudding (as it were), no contest, Component blows the doors off HDMI (compare the text). You can tweak the picture settings all you want!This TV can display a great picture from plenty of enough different sources.Speakers on this TV could be better!  But if you want real SRS5.1 SRS6.1 or SRS7.1 or better, then get a SRS system.The Remote Control is simple and responsive, but could not learn my BRD, Stereo receiver nor Satellite receiver.I think it's the best  47\" 1080 capable TV for under $500 you will find.

After much reading on several websites the enthusiasm for the Vizio brand sold me and I ordered this TV and the 42 inch as well.  I have had them a month now and found the set-up to be easy and I like the picture quality.  BUT my enthusiasm is now dampened after having to contact Vizio customer service.  The digital TV program information that is supposed to appear when the Guide button is pressed does not work on this TV (but works perfectly on the 42 inch) and Vizio customer service tried to tell me that I had a newer model that didn't include this.  Huh???  How come it is referenced on page 21 in my user's guide?  Even my old analog sets display program information.  The fast-talking, mostly unintelligible service rep acted like this was a perfectly plausible explanation even though I purchased both TVs at the same time.  His attitude was \"just deal with it.\"Fortunately, Amazon has come to the rescue and is doing what Vizio should have done --replacing the TV with another one.  I was able to speak to an Amazon service rep immediately who has already shipped out the replacement TV today.I can only hope I don't have any more trouble with these sets because I now know that Vizio will be of little help.  No service after the sale with Vizio.Follow-up to review:  The replacement TV also does not display program info.  So...if you like knowing the plot of what you are watching or want to know what shows are coming up next- choose another model.  Vizio should let buyers know that the 47 inch does not have this feature and remove it from the owner's manual.  So I guess I will deal with it but I would not have purchased this model if I had known.
