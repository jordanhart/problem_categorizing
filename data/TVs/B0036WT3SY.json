{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Amazing dark room LCD.", "Author": "Tyler Farnsworth", "ReviewID": "R1RIY1UDAVHYYV", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I spent hours researching and looking at TVs in the store before buying this 55\" monster. I actually returned a plasma I had purchased in order to get this TV and I am very glad I did. This TV will require some playing around in the menu settings and the settings of your input source (HD TV cable box and PS3 for me). Once dialed in though, it shines. The previous reviewers are telling the truth about the glossy screen, it will rainbow on you with heavy light coming in from windows or anything else that's bright and pointed at the TV, however if you plan on putting it in a dark room like I did, its extremely nice. I could have gotten the smaller 46\" version with the matte screen to eliminate this rainbow glare but this glossy screen gives deeper blacks if used in the right conditions and that is exactly what I wanted. The only down side to this TV besides the reflective screen is the input lag. It's not as great as some other LCD's out there but to be honest I'd rather have this slighter higher input lag while gaming than give up all the other qualities this TV brings to the table. You are going to be hard pressed to find an LCD out right now that does everything as well as this TV, but with better lag. So as long as you're ok with ~50-80 ms input lag in game mode, a screen that is really meant for a darker room, and can take the time to dial in all the settings, this TV is will make you one happy camper.", "Date": "April 21, 2010"}, {"Title": "Beautiful", "Author": "Capo \"TechGuy\"", "ReviewID": "R1XNX8WGXAUK2I", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Wow, this TV is beautiful.  The color, contrast, and brightness is amazing.Pros:* Color saturation is just right.* Darks are very dark for non-full-frame LED* Price - Amazing for a 55\"* Feature set is awesome considering the price* Fully transparent glass makes the picture look that much more amazing, especially in the dark.Cons:* Fully transparent glass is glossy and can produce lots of glare if you have windows in a bad location.  The screen has an ambient light sensor so I just turned up the brightness and at night during movies it automatically dims for the dark conditions* The viewing angle is perfect for +/- 15 degrees... outside of that, the darks grey out... it's really not that big a deal though* It's not free?Notes:* You MUST tweak the settings on this TV such as the auto-dimming feature.  By default, it is set to a backlight level of 0 (zero)!!!  I turned it up to 8 and it is super bright while the darks are very dark.* If you're like me, then you hate the 120/240 hertz smooth motion that is built into TVs, including this one.  The first thing I did was turn it OFF.  It looks unnatural IMO.Overall, this is an amazing TV well worth the money.  I would suggest it to anyone as long as they realize that the screen is glossy because that could be the biggest issue with the TV.  I also got the warranty because my last Samsung died after a year and a half (the warranties are only 1 year).", "Date": "June 16, 2010"}, {"Title": "Glossy and reflections", "Author": "D. Derenzo", "ReviewID": "R3CZJB7EBOLW1Q", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I've had the TV for a little over a month. The screen is extremely glossy, reflective and has rainbows. (See pics). Black levels are decent, but a little muddy when in a darkened room. I've messed around with most of the settings and just can't get the blacks to show good detail. There is a very tiny flashlight effect in the two lower corners, but barely noticeable. Colors are good, but inconsistent when watching cable so it's probably not the TV's fault. I see occasional lip sync issues, but again I've only seen this watching cable and it's not all the time, so I don't think it's the TV. Off angle picture definitely degrades.During the day, or with any lights on, the TV is barely watchable due to reflections. I get rainbows if a light is on and faces the TV. The only time I get good viewing is at night with almost all the lights off. If you have any lights on they have to be very low and not face the TV.  It's not just the screen that's glossy, its also the frame. It seems like Samsung designs TVs that look better when they are turned off than when viewing. Samsung used to claim on its website for 2010 models that the TV had a special coating that \"virtually eliminates glare and reflections\". This is a total lie and false advertising. I wonder if they were afraid of getting sued because it seems they have removed it.I turned the Auto motion plus off because some shows would \"jerk\" like it was skipping frames. This feature is also false advertising. I haven't seen any advantage to having this turned on and I have viewed sports, movies, concerts, blu-rays, etc.  There is no headphone jack at all. If you want to use headphones there is a 3.5mm line out, but you will not be able to adjust the volume. I had to hook up a stereo receiver to the TV just to be able to use headphones. The one area this TV excels in my opinion in that there is almost zero motion blur which I am sensitive to.I compared all the 55 inch models over the past 3 years (expect Vizio TruLED. Couldn't find one anywhere) and was never happy with any of them. Plasmas are too hot, burn in, etc. LED inconsistent backlight, expensive. Strange bezels (TOC red?). The picture on this TV is 99% as good as the Samsung LEDs. Who cares about thinness? I don't look at it from the side.So why didn't I return it? I just can't find anything I like. All Samsung 55 inchers are glossy now. I looked at non glossy Sony and LG. I don't like the Sony bezel and I see more grain/motion blur on Sony's than Samsung. LGs look nice, but the picture doesn't seem to pop, black levels look worse and I see a little more motion blur than Samsungs. The LG 8500 model has the glossy screen as does the new high end Sonys. Maybe LG 55LD650, 55LE5400/5500 would have been a better way to go but the prices fluctuate and I didn't feel like going through the hassle of returning, getting a new TV and risking not being happy with that one and starting all over again. I am just tired of looking. My solution is to get a 40 or 46 inch version of this TV for my bedroom to watch during the day, because those models are non glossy and watch the big one only at night. If anyone knows of any type of large black screen I can place behind my couch to block reflections it would be greatly appreciated.Here are my current settings.

At first there was a lack of HD content. Now that's fixed, except cable TV still hasn't gotten their act together. You'll be watching a show in HD, then the commercials in SD. Sometimes they just stretch SD and distort the picture. Sometimes the HD channels have terrible HD quality.It drives me nuts that movies are in all different aspect ratios that create bars on the top, bottom and sides that transform your TV into a much smaller set. You will have bars on the top and bottom with 1:85, 2:20, 2:35 and 2:40. You will have bars on the side watching remastered classics like Gone with the Wind in 1:33. Also bars on the sides with IMAX content.  Can you tell I hate widescreen? Panavision is a gimmick that movie theaters came up with when people started getting TVs in their homes to attract them to the movies again. Does not translate well in the home. Especially 2:40. James Cameron is the only director that will admit this and is why he insisted that Avatar blu-rays be in 16:9 to fit the whole screen. A much more satisfying and immersive viewing experience than watching an \"anamorphic\" 2:40 widescreen \"sliver\".  I wish they would include two versions on the disk. Original widescreen format and 16x9 full screen version.Also, blu-rays having 4 and 5 disks just to watch one movie, like Blade Runner? Director cut, extended cut, etc. Just drives the price of the DVD up.", "Date": "June 27, 2010"}, {"Title": "Customer Service for the Birds", "Author": "Gizmodoc \"Gizmodoc\"", "ReviewID": "R34UGEYN9E4MCV", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "Bought this TV in June.  Got it fine but of all of things not to be right - the actual stand.  There are two different types and they have the wrong one in the box.  Hard to believe but without the right stand, cannot stand it up to watch.  Called customer service and told them the issue.  They said no problem and they needed the TV info (serial #, etc.)and they would send the \"other\" type.  Sent them the info waited the 2 weeks they said it would take.  Called them back and asked where it was.  They said they did not get a serial number (of course I gave them that the first time).  I ask then why someone did not notify me that they needed it.  No answer.  Gave them the serial number again and they said the 2 week clock starts again.  Two weeks later, called back and asked where the part was (of course we could not use the TV in the mean time without the right stand (different hole configuration).  They said that they did not have the serial number in the transaction number they set up.  Gave them the serial number the third time and asked again why someone did not call to inform me of the holdup.  No answer.  Two weeks later, I called again and again was told that the request was sent to the wrong department and it should have gone to the No Charge department and again they did not have the serial number on my transaction.  I again gave them the serial number and warned them that it would not be a pleasant call if I had to call again.  It is now the end of August and guess what I called again and surprise same song, fifth verse (it must be a script they read).  The part cannot be more than 5 or ten bucks and it is apparent that they do not want to send the part and rather p***ed off the customer.  I am out $1500 and need to mount the darn thing to watch it.  Another $150.  I would not assume the quality of the product because I have not been able to use it but the CS is for the birds.  If negative scores are available, I would give it.  If you got the right stand, you're one of the lucky ones.  I've had better luck with Sony - overpriced but looks to be worth it.  Never thought the non-electronic part would be the one that I would have to complain about.  Samsung's long list of complaints on CS is all over the web.  I should have trusted my brethren.

I look at Consumer Reports, read as many reviews as possible, and ask around. While doing that, I found this television here.I initially came across this TV because my husband and I wanted a big screen, and this one was on sale at Best Buy at the time. It came highly recommended by the gentleman at the store, and by most reviews I found online agreed. In the store, there seemed to be some skipping in the picture - parts where the movie or show seemed to speed up for a second and then slow to regular speed - that made me nervous. I was so annoyed by it in the store, that I almost went with a smaller TV by Samsung until I learned that the \"skipping\" can sometimes be caused by your connection speed. I was HUGELY relieved to get our TV, hook it up, and find that everything was fine, no skipping at all.The picture quality is extremely good. Even compared with an LED LCD (the latest HD craze), there wasn't that much of a difference, at least not enough to pay the hundreds more for an LED LCD. Compared with others, I liked Samsung the best, and if you're going to go for a bigger TV, I think the 55\" is perfect. I would have been happy with the 46\", but my husband wanted bigger, and we compromised on this one. In the end, it turned out to be just right. Had we gone bigger, say to a 57\" or 60\", that would have been too big, but I think a little bit smaller would have been fine, if needed.The only problem we have had is when my husband plays video games that are really dark. HD's in general have a harder time rendering black colors, but we found an easy fix is to adjust the brightness in the game, and then the picture is perfect again.Overall, you can't beat the price on Amazon. Even with this exact same TV being on sale at Best Buy, it was still at least $400 cheaper on Amazon. Adding sales tax, delivery charges and all that, it was almost $650 cheaper than Best Buy.If you are looking for a really good, somewhat larger, high-quality HD at an extremely good price, I would definitely recommend that you buy this one.", "Date": "July 12, 2010"}, {"Title": "Beautiful picture after adjustment. Not for heavy lit rooms.", "Author": "John Seidner \"John\"", "ReviewID": "R2FNUUEBBA1172", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Initially I found this TV while shopping around at Wal-Mart.  The Samsung model was setup next to comparable Sony and LG TV's of the same size.  In my opinion the picture on the Samsung was noticeably better than either of the competitors. I noticed the richer colors and better contrast, so I was sold on the Samsung model. Rather than buying from Wal-Mart I went online to find the best price, and pulled the trigger.Design 9/10The TV has a simple but very nice looking design. I like the fact that the chassis surrounding the TV's picture is smaller than most. The stand was pretty easy to put together and the clear part of the stand looks very nice, plus it swivels.The touch sensitive buttons for power, source, channel, and volume at the bottom right are nice but it's easy to press them when cleaning the TV (not a big deal though).Picture 8/10This TV has a beautiful picture, but I personally recommend some small adjustments.This is a personal preference, but I found skin tones to be a bit too red. A quick adjustment to tint and some of the other advanced color settings and I was happy.The Auto Motion Plus 120Hz feature will need adjustment. Out of the box it's just set too high and results in jerky, unnatural looking motions.  You can turn it off completely to resolve the issue. However I recommend setting it to Custom, and then adjusting it to your liking. Problem solved.The real problem with this TV is the highly reflective screen which is not for everyone. Fortunately, my living room does not have a lot of windows or natural light so this is not a problem for me. I would not recommend this TV for people with heavily lit rooms or a lot of windows. The reflections will just be too distracting.  This TV is better suited for a theater room type setting.Like the previous reviewer mentioned, rainbow effects are present, but I have not found them to be noticeable much at all. I only see them when the TV is off, or if the screen is completely black. Again, I think this just depends on how much light you've got in your room.The viewing angle is not great, I would call it average. Colors do wash out when watching at an angle, several feet from the front center of the TV.Once more, I don't think this TV is for everyone because of the reflective screen. After some quick picture setting adjustments this TV has an absolutely amazing picture. The black levels, contrast, and amount of detail is amazing when watching HD movies and TV shows.  Sometimes when I am watching a blu-ray movie I feel like I am there!Sound  NA/10I can't comment much on the sound of the TV. I had it hooked up to surround sound within 5 minutes of getting it out of the box.  If you are going to get a TV this big, go get a surround sound system!!!Overall 8/10I would give this TV a 9/10 if it weren't for the reflective screen. It's a simple but great looking TV. The picture is amazing if you take the time to adjust it to your liking.  I don't think the rainbow effects or reflections should scare you away unless you've got a lot of natural and artificial light.", "Date": "April 17, 2010"}, {"Title": "vs sony kdl-ex500", "Author": "Wayne", "ReviewID": "RO52XRIW9MZ6R", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Review for the Samsung LN55C630.  I was one of those folks that qualified for the Sony upgrade replacement of the old sony rear projection tvs under class action litigation.  I had upgraded to the Sony kdl-ex500 and used the tv for 6 months before I had a little accident requiring me to purchase another tv.  I thought things were pretty good since I moved up to the 55 Sony at little cost.  However, when it came down to replace the cracked tv I started out re-evaluating all the options since I was going to pay out of pocket instead of just repurchasing the same sony 55ex500.Choices ran the gamut of 3d, non-3d, sony, samsung, sharp leds and lcd tvs.  After giving 3d another look over it was quickly removed as an option.  I don't feel the technology is ready for prime time with all the cross talk, ghosting effects and the cumbersome glasses.  Evaluating led full array, led backlit, and lcd ccfl I really felt that all have their strengths and weaknesses.  My choices quickly narrowed down to samsung 6300 in the 55 inch and the ln55c630, finally going with the ln55c630.3 weeks and going and I am extremely pleased with the samsung.  I'm realizing how much I was missing out in the ex500.  The Sony 55ex710 was a consideration but these matte sony tvs are really dull and uninspiring.  The samsung in comparison has much better visual effect.  The quality of the tv over the sony is like night and day.  Where the Sony has a cheap plastic feel and lighter.  The Samsung is encased with aluminum backing and a thick screen layer.  The stand is much much better as well.  There is definitely a pop effect when viewing content and although the gloss screen is something I usually prefer against Samsung has done a great job in utilizing it towards a better viewing experience.  As an aside, I have nothing but matte screen displays for work (dual monitor HP zr24w), dual monitor HP zr24w at home, matte screen thinkpad X201T, and a few others.  So, I have an appreciation for matte screens for professional work.  On the otherhand, I know a few folks that prefer the same for their television sets (myself included up to this point).  And I believe an adjustment is necessary to not hold onto conventional wisdom when evaluating these tvs.  There is definite some mirroring but the sony had blooming and reflection of the interior lights although it was a matte screen.The picture is fantastic especially at this price range.  If you're not in the market for 3d tv I would say this tv is your best bet.  It's just a whole another level of viewing experience if you're coming from some of the comparable sony ccfl lcds.  I experience virtually no audio lag through my denon 3310ci.  The lag on the sony was horrible.  Off viewing angle could was better on the Sony but not a big compromise considering how beautiful the picture looks up front.  I suspect the lcd layering and coating emphasize on projecting the light on the surface normals resulting in greater image quality so the viewing angle attenuation of the light is not a defect but an integral design decision.FYI, I have one of the AA02 panels.  There's some discussion on the forums about the various panel substitutions that are used.  As long as you're not getting one of the CN panels I would say it's a fair deal.  In comparison, other industries have been substituting parts and components out in the middle of the equipment model life for years.  The computer server market is a prime example (Dell is notorious for this).", "Date": "February 17, 2011"}, {"Title": "if only i could marry this thing!!", "Author": "D.

The LN55C630 is the closest I've come to that experience.I was looking to upgrade my 2008 model Samsung LN46A550 with a new set with a larger screen size and a higher contrast ratio. Having had a good experience with the A550, I was inclined towards getting another Samsung but also considered Sony's Bravia TVs. After much research and in-store comparisons I narrowed it down to the LED-backlit UNC6300 series and the standard CCFL-backlit LNC630 line. Considering the premium price of LED TVs and the small difference in picture quality compared to a CCFL TV, I settled on the 55-inch version of the C630 as it has the Ultra Clear Panel I prefer.SCREENGlossy and matte screens are a matter of personal preference with each type having its own advantages and disadvantages. The Ultra Clear Panel produces the best blacks I've seen on a CCFL-backlit LCD TV while every matte screen I've seen only dulls the black levels down. Since I can control the lighting in my viewing room to a good degree, reflections, glare and rainbow effects aren't a problem at all. The clear panel also enhances clarity and color compared to my matte-screened A550.PICTURE QUALITYWhen calibrated properly the picture quality on this TV is close to perfect. The image is lifelike with depth and dimension. Standard 1080i HD programming looks great and high-quality 1080p HD looks even better. Blu-ray discs often produce that looking-through-a-window experience. The extensive picture controls allow you to customize the picture to your liking. I used CNET's dark room picture settings for this model as a starting point and, for comparison, used Digital Video Essential's calibration disc which called for slightly different settings. Either calibration method produces good results but I prefer the calibration disc's contrast/brightness/color settings which seems to be more dialed in to my particular set. Digital Video Essentials: HD Basics [Blu-ray]AUTO MOTION PLUS 120 Hz PROCESSINGThe de-judder effect is also a personal preference. The experts at CNET are split on anti-judder with one against it and two in favor calling the effect more \"true-to-life\". I agree with the latter. The Auto Motion Plus settings include 3 presets and a fourth custom preset which allows the user to adjust the level of blur and judder. The effect can also be turned off completely.ECO SENSORThe Eco Sensor is a nice feature as it allows the picture to adapt to different light levels. This is the first TV I've seen which has implemented this feature successfully. Older TVs with light sensors made the screen look too dark. What's nice about Samsung's version is that the minimum/maximum backlight level can be set so that the screen never looks too dark or bright. While some users may not like this feature it does work well and produces a brightness level appropriate to a room's particular lighting conditions.I calibrated the \"Standard\" preset for daytime/afternoon use. Setting the backlight maximum at 10 is a good starting point for daytime viewing and can be adjusted up or down according to actual lighting conditions. Using a minimum backlight setting of 4, the light sensor adapts very well to room lighting from day to night. For nighttime use I again followed CNET's calibration settings as a starting point to adjust the \"Movie\" preset for dark room viewing, but used a backlight setting of 4 instead of the 5 they recommended. I found that 4 is more than bright enough for a dark room with 5 being a little too bright. CNET's calibration was done on the 46-inch model. At 55 inches, this is a big TV which puts out a lot of light.SCREEN UNIFORMITYSo, while this TV's picture quality is outstanding it isn't quite perfect. Viewed straight on the picture's great. Move several feet off-center and the colors and black levels deteriorate noticeably. The off-axis viewing on my two year-old A550 was quite good and I expected the same from the C630. Unfortunately, this wasn't the case with the C630 which has a narrower viewing angle. As this is a bedroom set this isn't much of a problem as the viewing position is fixed for the most part. Both my A550 and C630 has the AA02 panel so panel type isn't the issue. I looked at other current Samsung TVs with both glossy panels and matte panels which had better viewing angles so clear or matte coatings doesn't seem to be the determining factor. Consumer Reports reviewed several Samsung models with some receiving a good rating for off-axis viewing while others did not. There doesn't seem to be any rhyme or reason why screen uniformity varies from one TV to another.A very minor issue is the left and right edges of the screen are just slightly darker than the rest of the picture. This is subtle and doesn't present much of a problem.AUDIOThe sound from the A550's built-in speakers is really bad with not much dynamic range. Adding external speakers were necessary to get decent sound. While the sound from the C630 is by no means great, it's definitely an improvement as the sound is fuller and not quite as tinny. Adequate for watching the news but not much else. Again, adding a good speaker system is necessary for most other programming. One last nit is the exclusion of the headphone jack found on previous Samsung models. In its place is an audio out jack which doesn't allow use of the TV's volume controls when the \"external speaker\" setting is selected. The volume level for the high-quality 2.1 system I've been using can no longer be adjusted with the TV or remote control. Too bad. This is not an improvement in my case.While this TV has its drawbacks, the pluses outweigh the minuses. I would have given it a 5-star rating except for the issues noted above. Considering price, performance and design, this TV is a great value. A high-quality, 55-inch HDTV at around $1200 is tough to beat.

I ultimately chose size over picture quality and let me tell you- I have ZERO regrets!While researching this item I came across many complaints about the glossy screen and the glare associated with said glossy screen.  I currently have 3 lamps within 10 feet of this TV as well as 6' wide sliding glass doors and I have absolutely no issues with glare.  The picture is so vibrant and I find light to be no more off-putting on this TV than it is on my 37\" LG (which has a matte screen).Another complaint I'd like to debunk is the purportedly \"horrible\" audio.  Keep in mind that this unit is only a few inches deep, so there is only so much real estate to work with regarding speakers.  That said, I think the sound is about on par with any other TV out there.  Granted, this would not be sufficient for an audiophile.  Nonetheless, the audio is fine for the other 95% of people out there.I just can't get over how beautiful this picture is!  I was worried about losing some HD quality on a TV this size, but to my amazement I feel as though the quality is WAY better!  My only complaint (if you can even call it that) is getting used to the 120Hz refresh rate.  My previous TV was 60Hz and is much more natural for the human eye to process.  120Hz gives everything that \"soap opera\" effect that I'm sure many of you have either experienced or read about.  I got used to this after only a few days of use.  I find that it makes for much crisper viewing of sporting events, which is what I mostly watch anyway.I highly recommend that anyone who is in the market for a 55\" LCD strongly considers this black beauty.

All were slightly higher in price, but none really got better reviews than this TV.The first TV arrived and after I plugged it in, the first impression was AWESOME.  Huge improvement over my older JVC micodisplay.  Color was vibrant.  Then came the sinking feeling.  While running several Blu-ray test discs, I started to notice a very prominent lighting issue within the screen.  The bottom left corner and the entire right side (about the right 20% of the screen)were considerably brighter than the rest of the screen.  The bottom corner was the worst.  Imagine if you shined a flashlight on that corner... that's what it looked like.  During light or bright scenes, it was completely unnoticeable.  Dark or night scenes it was obnoxiously apparent.  Concerned it was the source material, I tested the screen by turning it to a source that wasn't hooked up, which left an all black screen briefly... you could clearly see the screen uniformity issues.  My wife and daughter who usually have little in the way of opinions about my toys were all over this issue as well, which meant it wasn't just my hypersensitive buyer expectations at work.  I tried to call Samsung and their response to my call was \"you could take it back\"... like it was a pair of jeans or something.  My frustration level went from 0 - insane in about 8 seconds.  When I contacted Amazon, they were very accommodating.  They shipped a new TV the same day the issued the RMA.TV number 2 came in about a week.  Obviously nervous about whether I had a bad TV or if this model was a bad model, I turned it on with some trepidation.  To my relief the black screen with no source was completely black.  Two or three test discs revealed a clear, clean and uniform screen.  Very pleased.I have now had the tv for about two months.  Very happy so far.Pros -Price vs Performance.  Performs very well, but the price is likely tough, if not impossible to beat at this size.Blacks are strongColors are very vibrantVery bright tvViewing angle seems good for LCDGame modemotion smoothingTV itself is attractive.ConsVery reflective - you should not even attempt to use this in a well light room.  Looks like a black mirror.  When dark, it looks fantastic.Possible quality control issues, but willing to bet I had a mishandled or bad TV on the first pass.Motion smoothing - this is something that can be overdone.

Recently, the TV's screen has become flickering.  I have had a few rounds of communications with Samsung customer service.  I pointed out that the problem was apparently a manufacturing defect and the TV should be recalled.  In the end, I got Samsung's response of \"the issue is considered not a manufacturing defect. With the warranty being expired, no other accommodations can be offered\".  Apparently, Samsung's customer service is playing a hard ball.  I firmly believe that the flickering screen is a manufacturing defect because (1) a lot of consumers reported the same flickering screen problem as mine on online forums and (2) Samsung has been aware of the issue (cut a jumper on the power supply board that was missed at the factory) and has issued a bulletin on how to fix the problem.  However, the sad part is that, as an individual consumer, I am not able to have Samsung acknowledge its TV to be a defective product.  I know there was a Class Action Settlement on a defective capacitor in some 2008 Samsung TV models or older.  Does anybody know if there is a class action against Samsung 55\" TV's for 2010 models or newer?  Or does anybody know if there is any law firm which would like to represent the consumers to file a class action law suit against Samsung for the defective TV's?I also own other 4 non-Samsung flat panel TV's which are all older than 3 years and are working perfectly.

So i use the TV audio when watching TV and switch to my home theater system when watching movies and playing games. The side viewing angle is not bad.

The picture just seemed more crisp and the colors more vibrant and accurate...then I looked at the info tag...it was the LN55C630.  At that moment I knew that this was the TV for me.I began scouring the Internet for the best deal.  The price of this TV seemed to fluctuate by the day, up or down $100-$150, so I waited.

I couldn't pass that up, and I have not looked back since.  I didn't need the player, I have a PS3... but now I have a Blu-ray player in the bedroom, so...BONUS!Before this TV, I had a 50\" 720P Samsung DLP TV, which I was pretty happy with and THOUGHT that the picture on it was pretty good.  When I got the LN55C630 hooked up and popped in a Blu-ray: WOW!  Now, I had seen Blu-rays before; on my 720P DLP, with my PS3 playing the disc, but NEVER like this.

I have sat and watched it without my surround sound on and it didn't bother me at all.The ONLY thing that I could say about this TV that is negative, is the reflective-ness of the screen.  Now, I knew about it before I bought it, so I was not surprised.  But just be forewarned: on bright days I have to close my blinds because the glare from the sun on the screen makes it almost unwatchable.

I am very surprised they did not vastly improve the viewing angle as it was hurrendous (2 feet off center and nearly half of the tv during dark scenes looked washed out) on the b650 I am starting to wonder if this is a problem on all Samsung LCD TV 55 inches and up. Anyhow the other problem I am having is not so much the glare which I was already expecting with such a shinny screen but this rainbow/halo effect I am getting if I get any sunshine in the room from any angle (not like a dlp rainbow) It is very noticeable on dark sceenes and of course if the TV is off (which I dont care about but it is very noticeable then). I am going to try to take a pic to see if it shows up but it is very annoying that now not only do I have to deal with glare but on top of that now rainbow effects. For all it's faults this did not happen on the b650. That aside the only other thing was as mentioned in other TV's with the 120hz feature is that it seems to create a bit of a motion studder and also seem to exagerate every subtle movements of a manually operated camera which gets irritating to watch after awhile. Anyhow now to the good. The picture is very good sometimes a bit on the dark side but the blacks are pretty rich. The sound is very adequate if you do not own a surround system. And my favorite feature of all is the media on demand which features the newest Divx software which now plays .264 mkv and some vob. files files direct from an external HD (Awesome) also plays music and show pics.
