White", "ReviewID": "R1E31AMTJ3U6P7", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "The most important fact you need to know about this TV is that it is a matte screen. None of the manufacturers seem to publish this important detail for some reason. You have to see for yourself or read reviews to figure it out. If you have any windows in the room with your TV, this will likely be the most important feature of your TV. Unfortunately, Sharp is one of the only manufacturers still using matte screens on their large tvs. I believe that is because there is a slight penalty to pay with contrast, but if you have windows around, the glare wouldn't allow you to see any contrast difference between matte and glossy screen. I will admit Samsung glossy screens now have a very good filter on most of their models that would rate a distant second to this sharp for reducing glare. I hope manufacturers will go back to matte as most TVs will be placed in a room with light, not a black theatre room.I gave four stars because I had the exact same impression as another reviewer regarding artifacts. The \"soap opera effect\" is terrible, especially if you use the ?480 hz refresh. If you bump it down to the lowest refresh, the effect is minimized. I was also aghast at how terrible a golf ball looks flying across the screen. This too was diminished after adjusting refresh but there are still artifacts.Setting up color, contrast,etc...I've had some problems here. I used the Disney WOW blu-ray to adjust these settings. Worked like a champ on my old LG (I would have purchased another one, but they are glossy now). However, when I set up this set and go back to HD TV (uverse) everything is way too yellow. I'm not sure if it's a problem with my setup or the television. Maybe we can see good settings published from the other reviewer or cnet soon. For now I'm using the \"auto\" function and it seems to work reasonably well without too much backlight and other typical off the shelf settings problems designed to wow in a showroom.Screen uniformityThis sharp outperforms my old LG (47lw5600) in this department. I don't see bright or dim areas across the screen like the LG. Seems to be a higher quality panel. I also had lots of bleed from light and dark areas on the LG which are minimal on the Sharp. That sort of effect used to drive me crazy watching certain movies like star trek or harry potter franchise on the LG.Oh, there is no Amazon loaded onto the apps for this TV. I have to use my panasonic bluray player to access amazon prime on demand movies. Might be a deal breaker for some. Hopefully, they will add that service in the future.", "Date": "July 5, 2013"}, {"Title": "Aquos Advantage and Sharp Customer Support is Sadly Lacking", "Author": "M.

About two weeks ago a column of dead pixels appeared on the right side of the screen.  I was concerned, but knew it was under warranty and recalled signing up for Aquos Advantage which is supposedly their premier customer support service for high end electronics.  What a joke.  I spent 45 minutes on hold trying to get an adviser.  They instructed me to take a series of photos of the problem send them in and wait.  10 days later, I'm still waiting.  I spend another frustrating hour on the phone this morning.  First they couldn't find the photos,even though they sent me an email confirmation.  Then the supervisor told me that they are on a hard drive that is down.  When I offered to resend them, they said they couldn't handle them from me directly.When I continued to press, the support tech told me 'the drive will be down for the next 88 hours'.  What??? A huge technology company like this and they supposedly can't get a hard drive working for 88 hours? What crap.  I don't like being lied to by customer service people like this.This is some of the worst customer service I've ever experienced.  Aquos Advantage is a joke.

Foresman", "ReviewID": "R11YBXQMT7NIM4", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "February 2014 update: Everything I wrote about this TV remains true. I would absolutely purchase it again. In a heart beat. But I want to note how important it is to customize your settings from the supplied settings. We recently had a software update to the TV which must have reset to the manufacturer defaults - possibly for a big box store environment, and the TV was almost unwatchable by comparison to the custom settings - colors were way over saturated, contrast was too high and motion artifacts were noticeable in some programming. Use the custom settings at the bottom of this review and then tweak as you see fit, and you should be very happy with this TV.----------------------------------------------------------------------------------TV has a bright, crisp picture with great contrast and color reproduction. I watch a lot of sports and it keeps up with fast action perfectly just set at 120Hz Low... doesn't need the additional interpolation used at the higher settings. I have noticed one program from a smaller local station whose sports replays always have motion artifacts and I have not been able to figure any way to remove them, but that is the one exception. All other live and recorded action from all major networks looks great. TV, movies and nature programs all look great too.Other reviewers have mentioned this fact, but this TV has a matte finish screen which reduces reflections very significantly and helps make the TV viewable in rooms with high levels of ambient light. Mine is in a living room with large windows exposed to sunlight all day long. With my prior set, I had to completely close all shades and turn the room into a \"cave\" in order to watch TV when the sun was up... even on a cloudy day.With this set, I'll generally draw the shades on the windows getting direct sunlight right behind the set, or directed right at the set, but leave shades up on the remaining windows so we can enjoy the outdoors. The picture is razor sharp and bright in those conditions, with no issues from reflections. The set is quite viewable for most programming even with shades up on all windows on a bright day, but will be difficult to discern very dark scenes in movies/programs that have them.The sound is very good for an HD set. Home theater buffs who want to shake the room and get the full surround sound effects will need appropriate sound system to accomplish that, but for most folks, the supplied speakers will do the trick just fine.The set does a nice job with input management providing plenty of inputs and allowing you to name them, and skip unused sources so even guests not familiar with your setup can quickly and easily switch between sources.This set has internet \"Smart\" connectivity which I verified works with my home Wifi, but we just don't use much. Same for the 3D TV... not something we use yet so not anything to say about that.But I do thoroughly recommend this set as a great 2D HD TV, and a very good value as of September 2013 when we purchased.You'll want to tweak the set from the supplied settings. I picked up the following recommendations from a google search and they work great for me:User Menu Settings* Picture Modeso Picture Mode : Movieo Color Temperature : Lowo Aspect Ratio : Stretch* Picture Settingo Backlight : +10o Contrast : 30o Brightness : 0o Color : 0o Tint : 0o Sharpness : 0* Advanced Settingso CMS Hue : Factoryo CMS Sat : Factoryo CMS Value : Factoryo Color Temp : Lowo Motion Enhancement : 120 Hz lowo Quad Pixel Plus : Ono Active Contrast : Offo Gamma Adjust : 0o Film Mode : Standardo Digital Noise Reduction : Offo Mono Chrome : Off", "Date": "October 18, 2013"}, {"Title": "Great picture... as long as you get the settings right", "Author": "P. Derrow", "ReviewID": "R1A1LJ8Z545TBG", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "When I first turned on this set I thought the picture quality and color saturation were simply stunning...but.  While watching our first well-produced drama program and then a golf broadcast, problems soon became apparent.  Even though I'm reasonably well versed in TV set-up, were it not for our professional installer, I'm fairly sure I would have put this 140 lb set back in the box and shipped it back.The problems were all the result of original factory settings that enabled virtually all of the image \"enhancement\" processing.  On drama programming, it gave the image a fake appearance that I initially thought was the result of a guest director using different camera and production methods.  When the same problem appeared on all similar types of programming, and particularly noticeable with HD content, It was clear the problem was with the TV.The problem with the golf broadcast was the presence of motion artifacts, particularly noticeable when the ball was moving rapidly across the screen.  Motion artifacts are still more noticeable with LED technology compared to plasma, but a set like this one with its higher (240Hz) processing rate should be very close to plasma.  With the factory settings, the motion artifact of the moving golf ball displayed as a trail nearly 4\" long ending with a second ball image!.After disabling virtually all of the enhancements, adjusting the brightness, contrast, color saturation and various other elements, the picture is as awesome as I expected in a set like this, hence the 4 star rating since a TV is really all about the picture..  If I could I'd give it a 5 stars after set-up and 1 for the hassle of doing so.  The matte glass of an LED set is still far superior in high ambient light applications compared with plasma sets and I also like the thin black bezel of this Sharp TV better than the silver or chrome bezel of most other sets.", "Date": "May 8, 2013"}, {"Title": "Picture distortion", "Author": "Mahidoodi \"Mahidoodi\"", "ReviewID": "RQD8M3UUP9P4O", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I purchased this 4 months ago.  First of all the picture quality is not as one would expect once you hear the word 'Quattron\", meaning 4 engines, meaning fast refresh rate, meaning sharper image.  All of a sudden there was bar (black or fuzzy) about 6 inches wide appeared on the right side of the TV, 12 inches from the edge.  After calling amazon at first , I was told to call SHARP because the TV is still under warranty and amazon can not do anything about it outside of 30 days.  I called SHARP and after talking to at least 3 reps and trying to reset and hard reset and all other tricks, they asked me to take pictures of the screen and send them to SHARP.  At this point I can not get an answer from SHARP as to what the problem is, I can't get any help from amazon, I have a TV that is not working right and I am out almost 4k for a TV that could possibly be a refurbished one.  This is not the first big screen TV in my house, as I have a Phillips 63, Vizio 55, and Panasonic 65.  But this is the first LCD TV as the others were all Plasma.  I will update this review if and when I get any resolution to this problem.  Beware, you are not buying a sharp picture tv, you are buying a SHARP.  and apparently the customer support is not very sharp either.Part 2After taking 13 pictures, as instructed by SHARP, and trying to send it to the Email address I was given I got 3 warnings in 3 days from Gmail saying that the recipient's server does not accept the email with attachment, I tried Zipping the files or sending it JPG, or even unsecured to no avail.  So SHARP wants you to send them pictures but they don't want to receive them.  I contacted Amazon again and much to my surprise they offered a refund or replacement.  I didn't want a refund but I also didn't want another SHARP.  I ended up ordering the M series of VIZIO.  The 240 HTZ has much sharper image than SHARP, but more about that review under VIZIO.  Amazon customer service is number one and there is a reason for this company being so successful.  It has to do with their customer service.  While the same could not be said about SHARP.  Just to give you an example, at one point, in order to rest the TV I had to hold 2 buttons , channel up and power, at the same time while plugging the TV.  This obviously can not be done with one person, so I wonder what would someone who had nobody else in the house do?  Every rep who answered the phone asked me to unplug and plug the TV , as if that would do a miracle.  As of this writing, almost 2 weeks after , I still have not heard back from SHARP.My rating of SHARP stays the same and too bad I can not rate Amazon's first class service in this review.", "Date": "December 23, 2013"}, {"Title": "Worth Every One The Five Stars!", "Author": "Ed", "ReviewID": "R3142N98S12JB0", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "A few things first.  This set weighs around 100 lbs., white glove delivery consists of unpacking the set to the point where they can plug it in and make sure it is operating properly.  You will have to attach the base to the unit, requires only a Phillips screw driver.  I strongly suggest two people for the job, we propped the lower edge up with some of the material that the set was packaged with so we could connect the base to the back of the set.  It took two of us to get the set on the stand, it is huge, need one person at each end.  It comes with two sets of glasses.  I thought I was being smart and ordered itreck BDAMS20U because they are around $20 and are described as active 3D glasses for Sharp Aquos models. That is true, except for the new models like this one,they Blue-Tooth technology---big improvement!  So do yourself a favor and order the same ones  that came with the set---they work!  So I screwed up.I do not have cable or satellite, get all my channels off-air with an antenna and I stream Netflix and Amazon, plenty of choices for us as there are around sixty channels available here in the Phoenix area (agreed, many you probably would never watch) but, there are still great choices available including all of the networks.  None of those signals are compressed like some providers do so they can squeeze in more channels, the result is a slightly better picture.So now we have the TV set up, plugged in, antenna hooked up and ready to go.  The first screens are basic set up info, like your time zone, language etc....then, of course, scan for the available digital channels.  The picture quality out of the box was excellent, and I will tell you now if you want to tweek, the possibilities seem endless.  I did crank up the base and treble a tad, no big deal.  The sound compared to our last set, a 60\" Samsung, is way, way better!  You can see by the specs that it has a sub-woofer and plenty of power.  The color, brightness, intensity, hue, etc., like I said, were terrific just the way it came.  It does take a bit of time to become familiar with the controls, the remote etc..as it was quite different from our old set---and I am somewhere behind on the learning curve.Last night, for the first time we used 3D,  we fired off IMAX Under The Sea 3D blue-ray,We had sharks swimming around the Barrier Reef and into our front room....Absolutely fabulous.  I have seen 3D at neighbors and at several stores but none, to me, had this depth and clarity.  My wife and I were really oohing and awing during the entire picture.I know there are several reviews with gobs of setting changes, but It appears to me that the picture will never be better than that  which is being broadcast and we all have different tastes.  I did want to make the point that out of the box you will be impressed....you certainly may want to make a few adjustments but, I really think, for me it's not too necessary.  The \"AV Mode\" button on the remote will give you presets for movies, classic movies, sports etc. just as you can choose sound for like concert hall, echo, etc...all of which is probably more fun than anything...but it is there!Well, we have only had this set now for about a week and are still impressed every time we turn it on.  Picture is brilliant, colors perfect and the sound excellent.  I can't say enough about this set----it definitely deserves five stars in my book.", "Date": "July 14, 2013"}, {"Title": "Completely died; can't be repaired. 2.5 months of runaround from Sharp; no replacement TV.", "Author": "Joseph D.

The repairman who looked at it said that this was not an unusual case; he has seen many of these sets die completely.But the breakdown was only the beginning of a long tragedy. The horrible part was the months of runaround from Sharp. We were promised a replacement TV, a refurbished unit. Only they didn't have one in stock. After several weeks of waiting finally a message on the answering machine; they have our TV. But when we return the call \"oh, sorry\" we took too long to call back (1 day) so they gave our set to someone else. Back to the end of the line.Another month later Sharp calls to say they have a set for us, so we provide our credit card information, address, and preferred delivery time. A few days later woo hoo our set has left the warehouse. But several days later we still haven't received the shipping information we were promised; we need to wait a few days. Then it seems the TV hasn't left the warehouse yet after all. A few days later it is learned that the TV never existed. We are back to zero. But \"inventory is arriving every day!\"Weeks later another set arrives and it is ready to ship. We will be contacted in two days. But four days later we call and learn that now we need to provide proof of purchase of the original set before they can ship. We immediately send it by email and they acknowledge receipt. A couple of days later we follow up and we are informed that the set will ship soon, but \"the manager needs to review our case\". Then we are contacted and told that they have changed their minds and are instead offering us a different model, only that model is not currently in stock.It is now clear to us that we will never get any TV from Sharp. We are Charlie Brown and Sharp is Lucie and they want us to keep trying to kick to football so they can say that they are assisting us. We have wasted 2 1/2 months and hundreds of dollars of cable bills because of this charade.We will now buy a new TV from anyone but Sharp.UPDATE:The TV repairman pronounced our Sharp TV set dead on November 6. Yesterday, on March 15, more than four months later, we received our replacement set, a refurbished but newer model. We had already bought a new TV from Amazon, a Samsung, and we were able to return it, but with a net loss of several hundred dollars (on top of the months of cable bills already wasted). Also when I unplugged all the wires before returning the Samsung I missed the tiny wireless USB receiver for the wireless keyboard, so that is gone and we have to replace it.So thanks Sharp for the replacement TV ... I guess.", "Date": "January 16, 2014"}, {"Title": "Wow!", "Author": "PhillyMusicLover", "ReviewID": "R3BA66NJP54FMG", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "It's been a week since my TV was delivered, it was a long wait and I had high expectations. Well I can say that the wait was worth it. I just want to say I'm not a tv/audio snob. If it looks good and sounds good, I don't really get lost in the specs (contrast ratio, gamma, etc...)PICTURE: Let's start with the picture, I had previous Sharp sets and I thought they were leaders in LCD manufacturing. The picture is amazing (color, dark levels, everything really), I ordered the 60\", it was the largest that would fit into the spot I needed and it was big. Go as big as you can afford, it's amazing the difference between a 50 inch sets and this 60. The box it comes in is very large, setting this thing up is a 2 person job. Make sure you have large amount of room lay it flat (on couch cushions) to put the provided stand on. I have a PS3 to play video games and Blu rays and the picture is just stunning. I would like to add that people were complaining about viewing angle (this could still be an issue), I can't comment on that since my TV is in a longer than wider room, so direct on viewing is typical. Another plus is the Matte screen, I hate glossy screens, and because I have a window directly behind the TV it helps tremendously. I would still recommend some thick curtains/blinds when in watching mode. Playing video games on this set is incredible, it also has a QuadPixel 2 feature that smooths out jaggies (anti-aliasing) on games, I was surprised but it made a difference on GTA V (a piece of video game art).Wallpaper mode was a selling point for us on this tv... it's a large screen and having it turned off is kind of an eye sore (lot of black). The wallpaper feature is pretty amazing, for 38W (about $1/mo) your tv never turns off (dims the picture to look like canvas). Also, it supposedly doesn't use the LED back light so it doesn't reduce the lifespan of your set.  When you hit the power button, it pulls pictures from the USB drive (not included) and rotates them ever 2 minutes or so. When people walk in they're like what is that? As far as I am aware of, no other brand offers this feature, I love coming downstairs in the morning seeing a beautiful scene on the TV. This feature along adds a lot of value to me. Great conversation starter while the tv is off.SOUND: Since we have an older home with old furniture my wife didn't want it to look like a A/V setup in/on/around our TV stand. I've read that a lot of TVs have terrible sound. There are plenty of times when my wife asks me to turn it down on this set... I love that fact that I don't need to buy a separate sound bar. The speakers are hidden well in the cabinet (fire downward under the bezel, sub in the back), keeps the thin aluminum bezel with diamond cut edges (kind of like the iPhone5/s) looking clean. Once this thing is setup, you can run the whole entertainment experience from one remote. The design and construction is of high quality, does not feel/look cheap.SMART TV: setting up the internet connection (wireless) on this was a bit annoying. The first day I tried I got fed up and even considered using the PS3 as my media box. The next day I managed to get the wifi working, glad I did because I love the smart tv. I don't have any experience with any smart tvs so I didn't know if it was good or not, but I love it. The netflix button on the remote is awesome (no cable at home), great being able to control everything under one remote. The same for the YouTube app, i'm a you tube junkie and I have playlists and channels and this tv is great for that, another great thing is that you can pair your ipad/tablet/phone with youtube and beam to the tv (like chromecast) . It sucks that you can't add/upgrade the apps (looking for spotify). I'm sure there are better SmartTVs out there, but for me it has the two biggest ones I use. Don't over look what the Smart TV part of this set offers, you'll be surprised.I couldn't get the AQUOUS remote app (iOS) to get connected, I guess I'll try again some other time. Not that big of a deal to me, but it's a general theme with this set. Be ready for some initial setup pains with wireless connectivity (this does not include HDMI/USB) those worked flawlessly. Once you have the wireless setup it works great.3D: I didn't buy this TV because of the 3D, it was actually cheaper with it, than without it... Tried the 3d feature (where it takes a 2d scene and makes it into 3d) on toy story 3 blu-ray. It was ok to say the least... waiting for Avatar blu-ray 3d (PS3 for my 3d player) to show up, if that looks just OK, i will give up on using 3D on this. So far, I preferred watching this set in 2D.If you're not sure, just go to a store to check it out... but for me, I am very pleased with this TV from the design to the functionality overall a great product. Great value to say the least, you get a high-end set for a budget price.Why I went with this model:- sharp LCD/size- built in sound (subwoofer)- cabinet design/matte screen- smart tv (wifi)- wallpaper modeThings to look out for:- viewing angle (check it out in a local store)- connecting to internet, not the easiest- 3D is kind of gimmicky", "Date": "October 7, 2013"}, {"Title": "Good tv", "Author": "John P.

Amazon sells the wireless desktop 5000 for about $50 at the time of this writing (I purchased the retail /consumer packaging edition fwiw).  IN fact, I am typing this edit from the Sharp Aquos LC60LE757's on board browser via the aforementioned keyboard and mouse.  The scroll wheel does not scroll but I suspect that is the browser and a compatibility issue.  Also disappointing is that the is seemingly no mouse usage available for the Youtube, Netflix, or Hulu apps built into the TV.  Despite that it is great to be able to use an inexpensive keyboard mouse combo for text entry for your search queries.  A must buy accessory in my opinion. Microsoft Wireless Comfort Desktop 5000I am not going to rehash what others specifically, Barry J White(matte screen), Ed (worth everyone of the the 5 stars), and P. Darrow (Great picture... as long as you get the settings right) have said.  I just want to throw on my unique likes and nits.  I erroneously entered this for the 70\", I have the 60\" modelFirst off, they are not kidding when they tell you to turn off virtually all of the special processing effects that come on by default.  Kill the anti-aliasing, dynamic contrast, and motion processing and you have one helluva set.  Each one of these effects detracts negatively from the consistency and overall quality of the image displayed.  I personally also found no reason for the digital noise suppression feature to be left on and suggest you turn that off, too. This screen is very watchable in a bright room with direct sunlight coming in.My only real nit is that the onboard Netflix streaming app has a serious problem with loosing audio/video sync.  The bluray player and the PC I have connected to the TV do not loose sync, ever, on the same programs the TV app drops the ball with.  The TV's streaming system will loose it pretty quickly whether on surround sound or stereo output of the audio stream.  Hulu seems to fair somewhat better in this regard, however the menu navigation is terrible and neurotic to boot so I suggest not relying on this smart tv's on board streaming capabilities unless you absolutely must.  I had hope that maybe it was just wonky wifi service to the set so I even took half a day to properly hardwire this TV to my router with no remedy.  Fwiw it seems just fine with Youtube.The money spent on this set for just the screen makes this TV an excellent deal.  In about two weeks of hitting the ground and looking at TV's this one's display output was an absolute gem in screen quality compared to anything else within +/-750.  Nothing came close to its combination of flawless motion and shockingly superior color gamut range (the samsungs, despite the marketing did quite a bad job with mid to dark wood grain color and definition reproduction).

If you have a Windows 7 or Windows 8 PC then this tip might help. In our review below we call out the rudimentary nature of the on-board music player with this TV. It is about as basic and fickle as they come. However, we discovered that with our Windows 7 and Windows 8 PCs and laptops we can turn on the \"Media Streaming\" feature in Windows Media Player. This allows you to create a playlist on your PC then right-click and select the \"Play To\" option. If you play the playlist to your Aquos TV you will get a treat. Your Sharp TV will suddenly start playing movies or music from your PC! The Sharp even shows the Album art, track #, title of the song and Album name. You can control the music directly from your PC avoiding having to use the on-board Sharp software or connecting a PC directly to the TV. Any PC on your home network can do it. Very cool feature that works beautifully. *** Upgrade to 5 stars now. :-)Our family is filled with a bunch of tech geeks. We love gadgets and have invested quite a bit in high-end A/V. Here's my take:1. If you are looking for a TV that delivers brilliant image quality then this TV is definitely one to consider. The picture is simply outstanding. The images are vivid with deep/rich colors and very smooth motion even with high-speed action in your videos. This is the TV's great strength.2. If you have a simple setup (use a set top box for your content and plan to use the internal TV speakers for sound) then this TV should be a delight for you. Just plug in the set top box via HDMI and get ready for a great experience.3. If you are shopping for a TV that has great built-in apps for things like Netflix, Hulu or watching content on your home network (DLNA) then this TV may disappoint you, ESPECIALLY if you are using wireless and DLNA. Being a techie family, we actually rely on features like DLNA quite a bit to enjoy video and music content. The DLNA and Netflix software did not work for the first week. Then the TV received a software update that seemed to resolve the DLNA and NetFlix issues. The DLNA music app is simply horrid. No way to search, does not play WMA files and is fickle. No Amazon Instant Video app. Just Netflix, Hulu, YouTube and a couple other video-on-demand apps. Honestly, the apps are rudimentary. We have a Windows Media Center PC hooked up to the TV to provide a richer experience.So, I had to stop short of 5 stars for the TV. For people looking for a simple \"I just want to connect my set top box and enjoy\" experience then I would highly recommend this TV. For folks who want to use the on-board software of the TV to enjoy content I would say the experience will be fair for Netflix, acceptable for Pandora, acceptable for DLNA video and unacceptable for DLNA Music or DLNA Photo. (I repeat ... this TV does NOT have an Amazon Instant Video app. Sigh.)Net: Awesome picture. Lackluster software, though the Netflix and Pandora apps are acceptable.", "Date": "October 6, 2013"}, {"Title": "Absolutely an Awesome Viewing Experience!", "Author": "Brian Leuthold", "ReviewID": "R2KWST3JXJTMY0", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "colors and clarity are exceptional.  My family cannot believe the picture.  They tell me it is like having the people in the room with them.  I agree, the picture is beautiful.  And watching a movie is as good or better than the movie theater.  I also pick up a 5.1 surround to go with the tv that makes the experience even better.  I am not a techy so I cannot speak about all the wonderful gadgets and gizmos that the set comes with, other than it all does what it claims and does it well.  I watched the Australian Open with this TV and it was like being there.  That small, very fast moving ball was even easy to see.  It did not leave a trail like I have seen with other TV's.  I even have the refresh rate turned down and there are no \"artifacts\" (I believe they are called).  I have watched this tv for quite a while in the stores and compared to others and I feel the color reproduction is far superior to the competition.  One person made note of the matte finish of the screen itself, something I had  not noticed and something other TV's don't do.  It cuts down on glare.  Very nice feature.  And the metal frame that surrounds the tv is like a piece of jewelry.  I have thought that the sound from other slim TV's was lacking which is why I also ordered a surround system.  But let me tell you that the sound from this set is good, not movie theatre good, but better than others on the market.  So any kind of after market front speaker or surround is really not necessary.  Cable in my area leaves something to be desired, so the picture quality is lacking from time to time, but put in a dvd and be prepared for a visual experience.  I am convinced that there is nothing better for the money on the market.  And as a bonus, this model came with 2 pair of 3D glasses as this set is 3D capable.  Nice touch Sharp.  I had a question early on in the set up of my set and called sharp.

Porter \"\"Utter Contempt\"\"", "ReviewID": "R3FVY1NXLG5C3J", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I debated for months about upgrading to one of the really BIG sets. I have owned a 32\", 40\", 52\"(glossy screen), 60\"(Matte screen with no 3D), 60\" (Matte screen with 3D, 8series that was replaced with a new set due to pixel issues). The new 60\" that was replaced by Amazon & Sharp is the LC-60LE847U. We don't use 3D too much but the extra technology that goes into these sets has convinced me to always buy the sets with the higher resolution and technical add-ons such as Quad Pixel Plus. Quattron is the way to go, along with the new dual-core processing, 240Hz refresh is adequate and you get the 480Hz refresh with the new 80LE757U. The 960Hz refresh and 12 million dynamic contrast over the 10 million in the 80LE757U, and a super Bright, are the only additions in the top of the line 80LE857U. The brightness in my 80LE757U, along with a multitude of optional settings, more than make up for a couple higher numbers with little difference for the viewer. I was more concerned about the fancier base the 80LE857U has, but the 757U has a strong and sharp looking black instead of the chrome. I wish Sharp had supplied the same base to the two top of the line TV's, but the difference in quality of the two sets is not enough to spend an extra 1-2K.Full array vs. Edge lit is debatable and in spite of a few comments about dark or light spots in the corners or edges, I have either not seen any or they were not that obvious. Sharp has so many great settings in every category, along with preset modes that usually eliminate the problem. If a preset doesn't do it, you can choose the user option and plug in some or all of the options. Usually, contrast and brightness, do the job. This set has some new presets such as \"vintage,\" \"standard (energy star)\" and numerous optional settings that can increase or decrease any seeming problem. Remember, you can also just tweek all or some of the preset settings to get the effect you want. Just switching to the \"movie\" setting and forgetting to change back to standard or user, can cause a faded screen or what seems too dark.  Spending time with the options is well worth the time spent. Once you fall in love with what this TV can do, you will why I sound this excited.The 80\" set in the 7series can only be challenged by a 90\" set once they release the 90\" with the extra goodies I have listed. The 80\" truly changes your viewing capability that even the 70\" could not have done.  The 60\" sets I still own are fantastic and are only beaten out by the sheer size of the 80\". The 80\", complete with all the latest Smart extras, 3D technology, high contrast and super motion add-ons, offers me the same beautiful clarity and sharp lines unlike any set over 32' that we have seen in over 10 years in the LED/LCD flat screens. I know what a quality TV is all about. I know this from my sheer number of sets owned (many now belong to my kids, which they love when I get a new set). When High Def and digital finally won out I had no idea they could bring photography and videos to such a high level. You are able to do far more than watch TV. You can now EXPERIENCE what you watch, whether in 3D or simply the High Resolution we now have.I couldn't lift anything larger than this sleak 80\" model so I have a projector on a 10' screen that delivers 1080P to watch movie-like action. Especially great for animated movies my grandkids love, or fast action movies like Star Trek.  Still, the 80\" Sharp Quattron set has edged out most of the larger TV needs and the sharp contrast, color, and unbelievable crisp clarity draws you into the movie. Turn out the lights and let the Sharp LC-80LE757U take you to new heights in TV technology at a price that you can get into.  I have several other sets that are beautiful TV's (smaller) and they provide beautiful pictures, but not GREAT pictures. My SHARP TV's are the sole occupants of my living room, AKA Sports Bar, and they are my babies. The added warranties take away the risk. Both Sharp and Amazon have come through and dealt with the few problems I have had. Deliveries by Amazon, along with warranty services, make them hard to beat.If you're ready for a really BIG, BOLD, and BEAUTIFUL TV, the Sharp LC-80LE757U can deliver you to the stars. If I have any issues as I move on I will make an amendment to this review. (I've had the set almost 6 weeks with lots of time to tinker with the settings and compare with my other two 60\" sets.)

I don't have a very bright room but the dimness of my old plasma always disappointing me, so I decided to give this a go. I viewed this at BB and was quite impressed so I went ahead and ordered it from Amazon.The first one I got had bad clouding issues around the edges so I sent it back. The second one, however, is just astounding! I will say that when I first got it, I always felt like it could be better and I kept fiddling with all the settings. I tried all the settings people posted online to no avail, I just never felt like I was getting everything that this TV had to offer. I would be satisfied one day and feel like the settings were slightly off the next. My suspicion is that all of these are just so very different that no one set of settings will satisfy all (like you seem to find with plasmas).That's when I ordered Disney's WOW on blu-ray. After just 30 minutes I was gobsmacked. No more fiddling with the settings every day, although I might run the setup again under the more advanced WOW tutorial to get just that little bit more. At first I was a bit confused as one of the settings I had to turn down to -30 (I think it was magenta) which I'm sure won't be the same for most, if not all of everyone else. That's why I won't post my settings, I think these are all unique and need to be calibrated individually. Do yourself a favor and buy the WOW disk, it will save you a lot of frustration.There is still a tiny bit of clouding when I turn off the inputs late at night and the TV is still on but I never notice it while watching anything and I'm a fan of Sci-Fi which tends to have lots of dark space scenes.Setup with my other home theater equipment was easy and the CEC HDMI works pretty well.I don't use 3D very often but I was blown away at how good it was on this set. It blows my older Samsung away, although that may have a lot to do with size and field of vision with the 70 incher.I can't really find a downside to this TV over my plasma to be honest and you can dial the brightness all the way up to 11 :)", "Date": "September 18, 2013"}, {"Title": "PC USERS BEWARE", "Author": "Luke Fair", "ReviewID": "R381E997GTYF1I", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "A little background: I haven't paid for cable for years. I watch everything online to save thousands of dollars a year. I achieve this by use of high end graphics intense gaming rigs (Gtx 770's SLI) and HDMI to a big screen. My biggest problem has always been that I have these awesome computers, and yet my TV's will only run at 60 HZ, causing screen tearing and blur. After many hours of research I came to the conclusion that I could achieve the 120 HZ big screen dream, IF, the tv was 240 HZ AND 3D. So with my hopes high I pulled the trigger and ordered this...boy did those hopes come crashing down with a swiftness. First things first..PICTURE: Forget the picture presets, they are utter garbage. While we're at it forget the Quattron, it's a total gimmick and offers no picture quality benefits. And since were on a roll, forget about 2D-3D conversion, It looks worse than Danny Devito pushed through a woodchipper. Not only that but after I updated the firmware the TV decided it would like to randomly convert to 3D for no particular reason (Still havent managed to fix this).The only way you can achieve perfection (I should say sharps version of perfection) IS TO MANUALLY ADJUST SETTINGS. Here is my issue with not just sharp tv's, but any tv over 60 inches...if you scroll down the item page to the spec layout comparing the 60, 70, and 80 inch versions of the Sharp 757 line you want to pay attention to one key factor that I never thought of before getting a massive tv like this...pixel count. Every size in this series has the same pixel count...which is just fine because 4k TV's are outrageous prices but herein lies the issue: A big screen is great and all BUT the larger the Tv the more the pixels are stretched out, creating unclear, jagged, text and picture. Id put money on the 60 inch version of this looking a hundred times better. Anyways, This went right in between my 4 year old 52 inch Sony Bravia and my 2 year old 55 inch Samsung...and to see those old, outdated lcd's outperform a tv that literally cost 2 times as much as each, was heartbreaking to say the least. After 2 and a half hours of calibrating and fiddling with settings I finally achieved as close to perfect color as this screen could manage and that being said it did look MUCH better than when I first fired it up, yet I was still left soul crushed when I looked over to either of my outdated screens that STILL outperformed my Sharp. My suggestion is to buy the 60 Inch OR the Vizio 70 inch ( It has all the same features but its cheaper and has local dimming), the bigger you go, the worse it looks.Sound: Mediocre, surround settings cause a weird echo that is maddening. Other tv's cost half as much and sound betterPC USERS: Now this is what really drove me nuts...unless you plan on overclocking your refresh rate (fairly simple), you will never achieve 120 FPS on this screen. Which is funny because sharp advertises 240 hz AND AquoMotion 480 (If you think that's frames per second you're only kidding yourself, wont even register as 120 HZ when activated) So if you dream of gaming at 120 frames on this then kiss those dreams goodbye.All in all i will never buy a Sharp again, I've learned my lesson and Im going to stick to Sony and Samsung.UPDATE: Screen now has black dots forming in the corners, sending it back to AmazonUPDATE #2 (Owned this for about a month): Decided to give it a little more time before i returned it...Light has begun bleeding out from the sides....", "Date": "February 28, 2014"}, {"Title": "Followed the reviews here", "Author": "Chickensoup", "ReviewID": "R3VGKUC15MK62K", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "After years of looking and comparing the tv was finally chosen.

I really wanted to like the TV.It's light, looks great on the stand, and has a lot of features for the size/price.  The remote controlled my AVR sound via HDMI link (with ARC, which is awesome) as well as the blu ray player (connected through the AVR).The DLNA browser is pretty bare-bones but functional.  Playing media from a USB port is pretty much the same.  The TV has a cool wallpaper mode where you can put images in a folder in a usb drive, and when you turn the TV off, it will play images as a slide show.Wireless Internet works, but the performance was much better (faster and more reliable) when I connected it physically to a router running in wireless ethernet bridge (client mode). Youtube works fine although I dislike the new interface (not the TV's fault).  My wife liked the Pandora.  We didn't try any other apps.  It's missing Amazon Instant Video, although I blame Amazon for that as it has not been as aggressive in pushing its service as the other services have.So what's not to like?1. The first one we got developed a dead pixel some time in the first two weeks.  Using the Disney Wow Pixel Flipper overnight for two nights did not fix the problem.2. The first unit had pretty noticeable (but not terrible) flash-lighting.  The second unit had flash-lighting so badly that you could see it in the lower left corner during the day even on light color scenes.3. Something is seriously wonky in the picture controls.  As someone else here said, using a calibration disc with a blue filter will make the color unwatchable.  You have to settle for eyeballing it.  A professional calibrator who has a blog mentioned something about this a couple years ago, so apparently it's not a new problem. The TV actually looked best in Game mode.  Activating any of the processing (Aquos 480) resulted in really bizarre visual artifacts.4. The overall picture quality just didn't pop.

Avatar was almost as good as the Theater.  Rio was better in 2D.6. Despite having a matte finish, the glare was terrible; well not so much glare as outright reflection (especially from off angles).

There is not quick set up brochure.The TV set up on the screen is ok but could be organized easier like Samsung.The remote controll is made cheap and in the dark you can't find the right button. Again Samsung is the leader there.Overall this TV is a good choice and a very good price/ value decision. When you set up the picture you can lower thesaturation of the color so you get close to the famous Samsung picture. The look of the product is good and the frame looks well done and not cheap.", "Date": "September 10, 2013"}, {"Title": "Decent TV if you are looking for good quality images", "Author": "Joe W.", "ReviewID": "R19JXJ0ROD4BQ3", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "It took me close to 3 weeks trying to figure out the best optimal display settings but after reading other peoples comments and suggestions, I was able to figure it out and I'm impressed with the picture quality.

While this beauty is only 2 inches thin, the foot of the stand is a ridiculous 17 1/2 inches deep.  Almost all the media centers are 15\"-16\" deep meaning the foot on the base will stick over the edges by an inch or 2.  We've spent 2 days scouring the Internet to find a stand and it is really challenging.One hint - skip searching for \"80 inch tv stand\" as it won't get you very far.  You actually need to search on the length of the stand.  This TV is actually exactly 6 feet wide (72 inches).  You can find strong stands that are narrower or wider so plan on an overhang off the sides on many of them.One other piece of advice on a stand.  We are still looking for something that holds the depth of the foot AND has room for a larger center speaker.  If you don't have a large center speaker (over 24\" wide) then you can find a stand. Over 24\" wide and it gets rough.  Measure everything before you start looking.  May the Force be with you.", "Date": "February 22, 2014"}, {"Title": "Great TV", "Author": "Amazon Customer", "ReviewID": "RPTIF1FP2XM2Q", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This is my first humungous television purchase. I upgraded from a 46\" Sony to this TV when I moved to a new house with a larger living room.Video:Out of the box this TV was pretty good in terms of the picture. We have a large vaulted ceiling living room with lots of windows so theres a lot of ambient light. Even in these conditions the picture was really bright and crisp. I like that you can switch between the various modes on the fly ( Standard, EnergyStar, Gaming , Cinema , Vintage , and User ) , this is useful because you see the effect on the picture right away. This is also true for all the settings for the picture even in advanced mode. I didnt like everything out of the box , there was still some what people call \"Soap Opera\" effect . I downloaded the AVSHD calibration DVD and once I got through the calibration steps the picture quality is really amazing. I did not want to pay someone to calibrate the DVD so this was the free option . The Gaming mode works really great for my XBOX , I dont really have to change anything and there are no artifacts or effects . The same can be said for actual 1080i programming , the Standard mode works pretty well without any correction for actual 1080i programming , its only a problem if you lower resolution original programming from my experience.Audio.The audio for this TV is essentially what you would expect its not enough for this large of a TV. I have paired it with http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00C27S3WG , the sony system. The sound is really great and I love watching movies and games on this TV. I unveiled the TV to my friends for SuperBowl and everyone loved it . I use the connections recommended by another reviewer.DirecTV -> SonyXBox -> SonySony -> Sharp ( via the ARC HDMI connection with is HDMI 1 with the Audio Return Channel )The reviewer also mentioned a TV out to Sony via Optic Fiber but I am certain this doesnt do anything because of the ARC HDMI. If I unplug this connection I still get audio via Sony Surround System.One small thing that I noticed is that in my setup the TV speakers themselves get disabled sometimes , I see a message that the AQUOS speakers are disabled . I am not really sure why this is and it hasnt made a difference for me so much so I havent spend a whole lot more like to look into it.Smart TV :The internet connection setup is a breeze , I used WEP and it connects just fine . The streaming is great with our fiber internet connection and Wireless N router. The buffering seems to be better than my older BluRay player with builtin wifi. The Sharp Beam application works pretty well with my Android phone , but sometimes its slow but I cannot attribute this to the TV , it could also be the app.3D:Havnet used yet so no review on this partRecapPROS:Great TV for the price , similar TVs in other brands can cost significantly higher.  Good out of the box picture quality and out of the box presets for the average user who does not want to spend a ton of time calibrating or paying for it . Smart apps are great and theres a lot of options to watch internet content.CONS:Needs a surround sound system for the sound that  you need with this size TV. Needs some tinkering to get the best out of it.", "Date": "February 11, 2014"}, {"Title": "Beautiful Picture!", "Author": "Stefanie L.

It creates a lifelike picture that seems like you are sitting next to the director while they are shooting the show. You have to see it to understand. The 3D picture quality is superb and well worth the expense.  This model has all of the features I use except Amazon Prime Instant Videos. It seems that should be added soon, since this TV updates its programming through the wireless network. It works well with the Smartphone App once you learn how to enable that mode (Initial Setup->Internet Setup->AQUOS Remote Control -  set to Enable). This feature makes your smartphone a universal remote.  The TV looks and works great with the SHARP HT-SB60. These two communicate so that when you switch the TV off and on, it turns off and on.

The picture is so vibrant and clear, with some high quality content I swear it almost looks like a 4k TV. I will say that it does take some fine tuning with the picture settings to get it perfect. The factory settings gave it that weird soap opera affect where it is all washed out and dim, like a Tim Burton film. The auto motion plus also makes any camera transition really harsh and obvious. I just googled the \"optimum settings\" for this tv and followed the instructions exactly and viola. Super deep blacks and super vibrant Colors. My favorite thing to watch on it is the time lapse scene at the beginning of all the house of cards episodes. It just looks amazing.

Some scenes are good, some are wretched, again depending on the station's and Direct TV's video technical staff.The controls are intuitive and easy to use.I am using a Microsoft K800 wireless keyboard and mouse and it works reasonably well. The set's browser is no better than fair - definitely not a PC or tablet replacement.My largest disappointment thus far is lack of key APS such as MLB and Amazon video. I plan to try MLB via my DVD player, instead.As a DVD watcher, I would definitely rate this set as a solid 5 stars. But, since the Smart part has been oversold due to lack of key APS, I took off 1 star overall.", "Date": "August 7, 2013"}, {"Title": "Good TV for the price, but has problems with color.", "Author": "Alexander C. De Torre", "ReviewID": "R39UZHE1D3KVH1", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "60inch version review:If you've never owned a 3D HD TV before and aren't too picky about the colors being absolutely perfect, then this is a great bargain TV for its class. Just know that you'll definitely need to buy the Disney WOW DVD to calibrate the picture to good enough quality because the defaults are horrendous. Be ready to spend a few hours playing with all the settings until you can get it just right.Unfortunately, if you're like me and obsess about having everything calibrated perfectly, then this TV is an absolute nightmare. I held off on putting up a review because I wanted to see if I'd eventually get the colors to be calibrated correctly, but after much research and attempts I've reached the conclusion that it's impossible.The problem lies with the secondary color Cyan. For some reason, no matter what you try on the settings, it can never be set correctly to how it should actually appear and as such your TV's colors will never be right. I have the picture duplicated on my PC monitor as well as using my smart phone for comparison and it drives me insane that the reds/blues are never exactly right. What ends up happening is some colors appear dead/do not appear at all while others appear just fine. For real simple examples: the deep red that you see when Netflix loads isn't right, the blue in the Facebook bar isn't right, skin color seems to lack some pigment, etc etc etc. It's just never right.Also, I find the Quattron extra yellow pixel technology to make the TV worse instead of better. It also contributes to the colors being wrong or making some colors dead which is why I always try to turn it off when possible.Finally, I've seen people posting their configurations for the settings and they are always wrong as well.You can read the CNET review here with a link to the correct configuration to bring it to standards, and you'll see it's still not great like that either.[...]Here is the actual settings incase the link doesn't work:\"Calibration notes: Having had poor results from using the Quattron's extra colors in the past I disabled them for this review. This lead to some challenges particularly after completing the calibration. While the calibrated chart looks dead-on the results were less than optimal. We calibrate our TVs to 70IRE as this is out standard and most behave very well as a result. The LE757 behaved unusually in regards to Cyan after calibration, and while you can choose not to use our calibration it's likely that you might find issues with color response elsewhere in the default Movie mode.-Picture settingsAV Mode: MovieOPC: OffBacklight: +16Contrast: +30Brightness: -1Color 0:Tint 0Sharpness 0--Advanced MenuCMS -HueR: 0, Y: -1, G: 0, C: +5, B: -5, M: +6CMS -Saturation R 0 Y -5 G -2 C 0 B -23 M -4C.M.S. -Value R +4 Y 0 G 0 C 0 B +4 M 0Color Gamut Range: StandardColor Temp: Low (set first then turn 10-pt on)Gain (LO) R +3 G 0 B +3(HI) R +5 G 0 B -910 point setting: On+1: 0, 0, 0+2: 0, 0, 0+3: +16, +2, 0+4: +13, +5, 0+5: +7, 0, 0+6: +1, 0, -7+7: +2, -1, -7+8: +3, 0, -7+9: +4, -2, -7+10: 0, -2, -5Motion Enhancement OffGame Type [greyed out]Shutter Effect [greyed out]Lamp Swing Effect [greyed out]Quad Pixel PLus 2Active Contrast OffGamma Adjustment -2Film Mode StdDigital Noise Reduction OffMonochrome OffRange of OPC Max +16Min -10\"", "Date": "October 7, 2013"}, {"Title": "I bumped my start rating up. Not bad but better available for the price", "Author": "Chad D. Hummel", "ReviewID": "R206NFRKDD0MLW", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "The best review in my opinion is a comparison to other products. Those are most helpful to me.  I'll compare the Vizio 65\"E  the Sharp Aquos 60\" 755/757 and the Samsung UN65EH6000.  I had narrowed it down to these 3 tv's based on price (all $1300 at time of purchase) and excellent reviews.  Comparisons will be made against each other and to my 2007 Samsung LCD 52\" which is as close to perfect as I can imagine.Remote:  The Samsung and Sharp remote are quite nice. The sharp for some reason has their sensor dead center on the TV to where I would have to hold the remote way up high so the center speaker didnt interfere/block the the signal. Solution would have been to raise the tv up with a piece of wood or something or reposition the center speaker out of center. Wall mounting isnt an option since in my home there is no option except for in front of a window.  The Samsung remote is great,the tv's IR sensor is on the side like most tv's Its almost the same remote as the 2007 tv.  Both remotes are very good. Vizio on the other hand provided about the cheapest remote I could imagine. It has to be pointed in the exact right spot to work. Even with brand new batteries. I've seen many reviews stating the same thing. They have to know with a bigger tv, maybe individuals arent sitting as close to the tv set so a stronger IR signal is needed.  I don't recall ever having an issue like this with something brand new.  It just felt cheap and like it could easily break.Base/Stand:  All 3 are about the same. The Sharp maybe a little better probably because it was supporting a 60\" instead of a 65\". The Sharp did seem to have a little bit of a lean to it, like it wasnt balanced. Like one side of the tv was heavier than the other. But nothing major. There were complaints on reviews for both the Samsung and Vizio base. Both have a little wobble to them, both would need quite a jar to knock them over.Picture Quality: Obviously each have their own opinion but  I'd rank Samsung #1 Sharp a close #2 and Vizio a distant 3rd.  Cnet reviews do not match my personal experience. I tried many posted user settings and my own calibrations using the Disney WOW disk and trial and error.  The vizio at times would look ok but always seemed like all scenes took place in a light fog in the middle of the screen. Some setting changes helped but never completely went away.  Its a thicker tv so I assumed its backlit and not edge lit like the Sharp.  Still scenes looked wonderful but motion did not. There was a lot of graininess in the background most of the time.  We returned this tv to amazon for those reason  along with the awful remote, some glare issues on the screen, and some glare issues of the bezel.  The bezel is  a shiny black plastic that reflects light like you wouldnt believe, its also wavy like its  warped so the light reflections off this bezel are extremely annoying. I'll be honest I'm surprised to see no mention of this on the Amazon reviews. That being said, If this was my first flat screen tv I wouldn't  realize the PQ is slightly sub par.  The Sharp was very nice. Excellent looking quality on everything about it including PQ. It was a little too sharp looking sometimes , even with sharpness turned down. It created artifacts in the image. Really not bad though better than the opposite affect . Color was best out of the 3. The smart part of this TV was so far ahead of the Vizio in layout and speed. This tv also has 3D  which I wasnt interested in nor the smartTV. I have my own devices that do what the SmartTv does. Roku and a bluray player perform those functions faster and better.  I seen an HD roku at walmart for $28 far cheaper than increased price to incorporate it in a tv. First 3d experience with the Sharp. Was surprised at its quality compared to movie theater 3-D. Still not that interesting to me and I dont like wearing glasses to watch TV. The piece between your eyes is annoying everything is a tad darker and lacks focus. I didnt buy it for the 3-d.  There was more of a glare issue with this tv and we also felt cheated in that we had to downgrade in size. The 70\" was out of price range. After  watching a 65\" for a week a 60\" seemed so small and that we werent getting our moneys worth. If the Vizio would have worked out we wouldnt even have tried this TV.  So we bit the bullet and got the Samsung which I should have done in the first place. It was more only because we bought it at best buy and had shipping and state tax. It doesn't have the smarttv feature or 3-d . It only had the best picture quality. For us it came down to that.  The out of box settings werent as good as on the Sharp.  There were many setting posted for this tv in reviews I tried them all but all resulted  in a worse picture for me. Even the WOW disk resulted in a worse picture. It took tweaking with my own eyes to get the picture to  look amazing. . I actually wish there was less picture settings, no reason for that much changing.  The Samsung by far has the least glare problem. Watching a football game now looks like  your watching it through a glass window. Like my old Samsung. The Sharp looked like you were watching a cartoon or video game of a football game, thats exaggerated to make the point. I won't post my setting unless asked because as I said it appears that each set requires different setting or its user opinion.Side notes:  Amazon was great on the return of the Vizio. Full refund although the tv is still sitting in my living room, its been over a month. The shipping companies are busy during the holiday season. No fault of Amazon.Also I feel I have to mention this. I am disappointed with Vizio support. A phone call and an email got me about 10 emails replys from them. Each stating they can't help me. It would be best over the phone. One stating they could not provide any assistance with the remote since its made by a 3rd party. What??That being said I did not get a reply from Sharp support, even though I was told I would within 4 days.  I have never had to call Samsung support as Ive never had an issue.Out of the box the Samsung needed the backlight and brightness turned down that was 99% of it right there.  Some motion scenes did look odd. I tweaked the blur (5) and judder (10) settings and its much improved.

When I'm able to get it looking decent for movies, it looks awful for gaming and vice versa.  It either looks too saturated or too bland when switching between media.  Also, sometimes I notice a serious loss of detail in dark scenes.  I almost returned it because of this, but it wasn't worth the hassle.  That said, my wife and parents think it looks great.  The average person will think the picture quality looks pretty good.Gaming:You can NOT game on this TV in anything other than gaming mode.  I've never seen so much lag on a TV.  I did not notice any lag in gaming mode, so it's not really an issue.  It's just a pain to have to switch the AV mode all of the time.  I can't even tell the difference when gaming mode is on / off on my old sony lcos.  You could always leave it in gaming mode - some do that and you'll find setting in the AVS forums, but movies never look quite right to me when I do that.3D:The 3d is decent.  I haven't seen 3d on many TVs so I don't have much to compare it to.  3D is easy to use.  The glasses are light and comfortable.  It's active 3d so you can't use the cheapo movie theater glasses.  I saw the glasses online for around $45 dollars.  Gravity in 3D looked pretty awesome.  There is definitely some ghosting on all of the 3d media that I have watched.  Ghosting is when you see the same object multiple times - sort of like shadows or halos appearing around them.  My wife won't watch anything in 3d because of it.  I've never watched something in 3D w/o the ghosting effect so I'm not sure if there are any tvs out there w/o it.Smart features:Pandora and Netflix are pretty much the only apps I've used.  The remote has a dedicated Netflix button which is nice.  I didn't have a problem running either on this TV wired or wireless.  Setting it up on my network was easy.

You have to be careful in comparing this TV to others. Do not compare it to the 4K's and the other expensive TV's. The reason I'm saying this is the only drawback of this TV (that I've found so far) is ghosting. I've seen 4k's and $5000+ model TV's and they don't have the ghosting as bad as this model. But, I wasn't interested in spending that much money. That's why I chose the Sharp.The ghosting problem occurs in close-ups or large fast moving objects. You will notice a thin repetitive ghost line behind the object or actor. Again this only happens when they have actors in a close up or a large object (like a jet) is moving taking up a large part of the screen. The only fix I've been able to find is moving the viewing location away from the TV. The closer you are to the TV the worse the ghosting. Your eyes pick up the ghosting easier.With that being the only complaint on this TV , it's well worth the price. A few of the Apps aren't worth using but Netflix works great. The Wifi setup is easy and the streaming movies have yet to pause or freeze.Point made : If you are looking for a 70 inch TV and don't want to jump over the $2500 range , this TV is your purchase.

The 3D is spectacular and the colors are clean and crisp.I have this hooked to an A/V receiver via the ARC connection and the receiver and TV talk nicely and I've ended up with a robust 9.2 surround setup where I wasn't expecting to use the TV speakers at all.  They end up filling the sound nicely for the slight gap in the front wall-o-sound.  This TV also fully supports the \"Lip Sync\" ability of some receivers to ensure that the audio coming from the TV and the audio coming from the receiver are in sync without needing additional effort.It's worth pointing out, this TV also natively supports the MKV format for video playback off of USB devices.  Take that information into account if it applies to you.The only problem I have with the TV is that my first one got a horizontal line of bad pixels after about 5 hours of usage.  The seller immediately got me a new one shipped and the new one has worked flawlessly for the past several days.  I'm exceedingly happy with both the TV and the Seller.", "Date": "February 27, 2014"}, {"Title": "Very happy with purchase", "Author": "Doug", "ReviewID": "R2BYUVVVZCR2YA", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Delivery was painless.

One must hit ENTER to play, or pause, and EXIT to stop playback, just like a 1980's VCR.

I spent about 2 days configuring the TV ( I work in TV Production and calibrate broadcast monitors in 10 minutes)  I found out the hard way that you can have great refresh rates for video games, and great cinema experiences but you have to toggle between settings to get the optimal experience.  Another inconvenience is that the TV doesn't retain your settings, when you turn it on or off, or switch between inputs, say your roku and PS3/4 you will have to rifle through the picture profiles and reselect the pictures settings.  If you are NOT a fan of 60FPS or \"Soap Opera Effect\" frame rates, this TV defaults to it and it will drive you insane.  When you get a 240HZ TV, you're paying for super fluid refresh rates, again, great for gaming, horrible for watching Movies.The 3D performs extremely well, but you will have to replace the batteries frequently.  And don't think you'll be able to buy just any active 3D glasses, even if Sharp is listed on the compatibility.  The glasses that come with the TV are the ONLY, I repeat ONLY model of glasses that work with this TV, so instead of $10 - $20, you're looking at spending $40-$50 per extra pair.This last point may be an anomaly, but annoying none-the-less. I owned the TV for two weeks and a bright red vertical line appeared on the right side of the screen, this is not a pixel problem, it is a board problem inside the TV, so Sharp now has to replace the TV, or send a repair person.

I AM SO GLAD I DID NOT LISTEN AND TOOK THE CHANCE. I NEVER OWNED A SHARP BEFORE, THIS IS MY FIRST.  THIS TV IS SO MUCH BETTER LOOKING THEN ALL THE OTHERS I LOOKED AT. IT SITS LOW TO THE STAND AND TABLETOP, HIDING ALL THE CABLES BEHIND IT. AND HAS THE ULTRA THIN BEZIL WHICH DOES NOT DETRACT FROM THE PICTURE. I FOUND IT EASY TO SET UP WIRELESSLY AND AS FAR AS THE SETTINGS GO, THE PICTURE WAS GR8 RIGHT OUT OF THE BOX. I SAW NO NEED FOR ALL THOSE SETTINGS POSTED BY ANOTHER REVIEWER WHICH I WROTE DOWN FOR NOTHING. I JUST SET A FEW THINGS LIKE THE OPC, WHO WANTS TO SEE THAT ON THE SCREEN, THE ON/OFF INDICATER LIGHT. NICE TO KNOW IF THE SET TURNED ON OR NOT RIGHT AWAY. BUT EVERYTHING ELSE IS SET TO AUTO WHICH FOR ME WORKS JUST FINE. EVEN MY FRIENDS WHO ADVISED AGAINST SHARP WERE SUPRISED WHEN THEY SAW THE PICTURE. THE SOUND IS GOOD ENOUGH FOR ME, IF YOU WANT BETTER THEN I SUGGEST ADDING  A SURROUND SYSTEM. AND AS FAR AS UPDATING GOES, THE TV IS SET TO AUTO UPDATE, AND IT DID JUST THAT WITHIN A FEW DAYS. I DON'T KNOW WHAT IT UPDATED, BUT IT DID. IT DOES HAVE AN ONSCREEN KEYBOARD AND MOUSE YOU CAN USE WHEN ON THE INTERNET, AND YOU CAN SWITCH FROM MOUSE TO A HIGHLIGHTER. I FIND THE HIGHLIGHTER EASIER FOR THE MOUSE IS VERY SLOWTO MOVR AROUND WITH. IT COMES WITH ALOT OF APPS, FB,YOUTUBE,SKYPE,WEATHER,PANDORA,NETFLIX,VUDU,GAMES,ETC ETC ETC. MOST OF WHICH I DON'T USE, BUT THE FEW I DO USE ARE OK AT BEST. I MUST SAY THE NETFLIX BUTTON ON THE REMOTE IS A PAIN. IT'S SO BIG, AND RIGHT NEXT TO THE DIRECTIONAL BUTTONS, THAT SOMETIMES YOU HIT IT BY MISTAKE AND YOUR OFF TO NETFLIX!! REALLY ANNOYING WHEN YOUR IN THE MIDDLE OF TYPING SOMETHING. WISH THERE WAS A WAY TO TURN IT OFF. YOU CAN UNSUBSCRIBE FROM IT, BUT THE BUTTON IS STILL ACTIVE. OH WELL.  IT'S NICE TO BE ABLE TO CHECK MY EMAIL WHILE SITTING ON THE COUCH, OR CHECK IN ON FACEBOOK, OR CHECK THE WEATHER EVEN. ONLY COMPLAINT IS THAT THE ACCUWEATHER APP DOES NOT SAVE YOUR SETTINGS. SO YOU MUST RE-ENTER YOUR ZIP EACH TIME, KINDA STUPID, BUT OTHERWISE IT'S VERY GOOD, OFFERING MAPS AND FORECASTS UP TO TWO WEEKS AHEAD.THE TV ALSO HAS A WALLPAPER SETTING, WHICH YOU CAN TURN ON/OFF. SO INSTEAD OF LOOKING AT A BIG BLACK SCREEN WHEN IT'S OFF, YOU CAN SET IT TO ONE OF THE PREINSTALLED PHOTOS OF YOUR CHOICE WHICH CAN BE ONE OR HAVE IT CHANGE EVERY SO MANY MINUTES. THERE AN APP LIKE THAT TOO IN THE APP CENTER WITH MORE PHOTOS. A FIREPLACE OR FISHTANKS, LANDSCAPES,YOU GET THE PICTURE. LOL . THERE ARE LOTS OF SETTINGS AND APPS TO PLAY WITH THAT WILL KEEP YOU BUSY FOR A WHILE. I ALSO WENT AHEAD AND PURCHASED THE SHARP WEBCAM FOR THE SKYPE APP. LIKE ANOTHER REVIEWER SAID, THERE IS NO ON/OFF BUTTON FOR THE CAMERA ITSELF. EVEN IF YOU TURN IT ON OR OFF WHILE IN THE SKYPE APP. THE CAMERA HAS A LITTLE BLUE INDICATER LIGHT WHICH IS ALWAYS ON. IT GOES ON WITH THE TV AND OFF WHEN THE TV IS SHUT OFF.  I TRIED IT, CALLED A FRIEND IN FRANCE OF ALL PLACES, AND IT WORKED JUST FINE, THAT ALONE MADE IT WORTH THE PRICE OF THE CAMERA, WHICH WAS NOT CHEAP.  ANOTHER REVIEWER SAID SPOMETHING ABOUT NOT BEING ABLE TO PROGRAM THE REMOTE WITH DISH NETWORK. WELL I HAVE DISH, AND PROGRAMED IT TO WORK WITH THE TV, AND YES, YOU MUST STILL USE YOUR DISH REMOTE TO CHANGE CHANNELS, AND TURN THE TV ON/OFF, OR ADJUST THE VOLUME. THE SHARP REMOTE ONLY DOES VOLUME. BUT YOU NEED IT FOR MENU SETTINGS, LIKE SWITCHING TO PLAY GAMES OR USE YOUR OTHER HOOKED UP THINGS LIKE A DVD PLAYER ETC. AND TO USE THE INTERNET OR THE APPS. SO YES YOUR STUCK WITH TWO REMOTES.  IT ALSO COMES WITH 2 PAIR OF 3D GLASSES, WHICH  I HAVE NOT TRIED  YET, AND YES, YOU CAN SHUT OFF IT NOTIFYING YOU THAT IT FOUND A 3D MOVIE, SO PUT ON YOUR GLASSES! SO ANNOYING. BUT THATS ANOTHER REVIEW. DELIVERY WAS FAST, AND THE GUYS WERE VERY NICE. CARRIED THE THING INSIDE AND OPENED IT UP AND WAITED WHILE I CHECKED TO MAKE SURE EVERYTHING WAS OK. THANK GOD IT WAS, BECAUSE THE PACKAGING WAS HORRIBLE. I CANNOT BELEIVE HOW THEY COULD PACKAGE SOMETHING SO FRAGILE WITHOUT ANY PROTECTION. I MEAN NONE.
