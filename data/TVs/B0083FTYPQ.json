It is light years ahead of a Competitor's \"similar\" offering that I returned because it was absolutely inferior in virtually every respect -- especially when compared to this Phillips Product.  I am glad I made the switch, and that I bought it from Amazon.The LED Picture is outstanding, and continues to get even better after 3 weeks of operation.  I was restricted to the 40\" Screen size by the dimensions of my Home Entertainment Center, or I would have gone bigger.  The TV and Stand are solid, heavy weight construction, and they look very good.Setup was a cinch, and took less than 10 minutes including setups for the Viewing choices, \"Smart Network\" functions (that also included Netflix and VuDu), plus connecting a DVD Player.  It could not have been easier and I still have one free HDMI connection.The sound is not bad, but it could stand some improvement.  So, to keep my first class notion going I purchased a Vizio SB4020M-AO Sound Bar, and now the sound is crisp, clear and very pleasing.  There is even a Sub-Woofer connection on the Visio if I want to add that.  Combined with the Phillips built-in Speakers it's just right, and is completely adjustable if I want something different.The Documentation (Manuals) are excellent.  There is a regular (b&w;) 16 Page Manual, plus a 10 Page Quick Start Guide in the Box, both of which are 5-1/2 x 8\" size (Quick Start is in color).  I also downloaded the Manuals from Phillips Site, and both of those versions are viewable and printable in Color if you choose to print them.  The on-line Manual is 67 Pages, and the Quick Start is 10 pages.I do have one gripe about the Quick Start Guide.  The information on obtaining \"Media Connect\" is not correct.  I contacted Phillips on line to get the correct info, and this should not happen.  The TV is not Smart without this Software.  But that's the only \"glitch\" to date, and I am one happy Camper.  I obtained Media Connect from  [...]  .  Check before you use this.I strongly recommend this Smart TV, and also \"popped\" for a Phillips Universal Remote that just arrived.  It's Smart too, & supposed to handle the functions of 6 different Remotes. We shall see. This is not my first Phillips product and I doubt it will be the last.  I like the Phillips Brand for good reasons: in my experiences, they do what you expect them to do; do it well & at a fair price.", "Date": "December 23, 2012"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "Unavailable", "Features": "iPTV\nWi-Fi\nNet Apps\nMedia Connect\nDLNA", "Name": "Philips 40PFL4907 40-Inch 60Hz LED-Lit TV (Black) (2012 Model)", "ImgURL": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51-vWz2gp5L._SX300_.jpg", "ProductID": "B0083FTYPQ"}}
