Can Phillips and Amazon get together to allow accessing Amazon on this great TV?As for the TV, it has great picture clarity, great sound, and a great remote control.  I'm so glad to have purchased this TV--my first new set in 24 years.

The user interface when navigating through NetTV options or Netfilx movies or HuluPlus, is very slow. The interface does not respond the way it should2. The remote control wheel key is very hard to use & needs multiple presses.If you do not mind pressing the remote button multiple times to get the TV to respond, you will enjoy this TV since it does have some cool features.Anyone experiencing the same issue or it is just that I got a bad remote?", "Date": "December 17, 2012"}, {"Title": "Terrible TV, Terrible Support", "Author": "sassypants", "ReviewID": "R1QNG6L4XZIM8F", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "After setting up the TV and updating the software, I immediately tried to access Netflix. After 2 hours of waiting for it to load, I contacted customer support. The support tech I was talking to offered several generic and unhelpful tips, one of which was that I put my TV within 20 feet of the wireless router (which is both ridiculous and impossible in my situation), before hanging up on me. When I called back, I was told that all available techs were busy and was put on hold for over half an hour before the phone line went dead.I will absolutely not be buying any more Philips products if this is how they treat their customers.", "Date": "December 13, 2012"}, {"Title": "Great TV", "Author": "ked1987", "ReviewID": "R1TFHEJ74CFK2X", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Bought this TV at Walmart and definitely wasn't disappointed.Pros:- Very thin- Images are crisp- Wifi straight out the box- Price isn't too bad at all for the features- MediaConnect eliminates the need for cordsCons:- Remote needs a keyboard (like the Vizio tvs)- App library is small- Apps move too slowly- MediaConnect has a slight delay but nothing to cry aboutOverall, it's a pretty great tv but the software prevents it from getting 5 stars.", "Date": "December 31, 2012"}, {"Title": "its a very good tv", "Author": "yolvandy vargas", "ReviewID": "R2FE0PN5H4JSNK", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "this is a very good tv for the price and has wi-fi and many things, is ultra slim and i like, is led tv. is all good", "Date": "April 17, 2013"}, {"Title": "The best in its category", "Author": "Habilny", "ReviewID": "R2BJN7W7JPD67W", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "this TV is one of the best TVs in its category compared to its price.

LORD", "ReviewID": "R3VOFKLK6BJIRA", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I bought this set mainly for the unique feature of wireless connectivity between laptop and TV (no more HDMI cord!) The box and the instructions both said their MediaConnect software works with Mac (OS 10.5 or higher). Mine's 10.6, and it most assuredly does not work. I spent three hours on the phone with a very nice tech support person who finally told me that there must be something wrong with my Powerbook. Of course there isn't. I just love \"support\" like that! The software says it's finished downloading, but does not open. I wish I could sue Philips in small claims court to get compensated for the wasted time and aggravation. Punitive damages for false advertising would be nice, too! Judging from the other comments, I'm not the only person who believed the lie on the box that their MediaConnect is Mac compatible. Wasting thousands of hours of customers' time through false claims on packaging really should carry some monetary penalty.", "Date": "December 23, 2012"}, {"Title": "Bought it a month ago", "Author": "Ad", "ReviewID": "R1AK8Z1AK93PNO", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "every thing was as posted on the ads.The only problem i had was the remote control.
