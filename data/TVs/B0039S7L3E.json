So far I'm very pleased with my selection. It came down to the Samsung 26\" C450 and this one. For the money and options the LG was a better pick for sure. I must say the sound is by far best on this TV than any other LCD I looked at. The TV turns on quickly (2-3sec) some delay much longer. The blacks are black and the colors look great, even on standard def channels. Some LCDs look horrible on SD channels but not this one. Very pleased with the menu setup and the remote control. The only thing I'll say I don't care for is the picture wizard setup. It's almost easier to just use the standard pre set picture settings and make only minor adjustments to fit your room. The stand swivels smoothly which the Sony and Samsung don't. I also like that it's not a glossy screen with lots of reflections. I see very little blur when viewing fast moving options. You see it, but not like some other 60Hz TVs. So if you are looking for a great LCD for under $380.00. I highly recommend this model. Oh, and don't let anyone tell you any different. If you are looking at 32\" and below. 720p is just as good as any 1080p model in this size range.only way this TV could be anymore perfect is for it to have a built in Blue-ray or DVD player.", "Date": "April 18, 2010"}, {"Title": "Great addition to our home", "Author": "Vagabond", "ReviewID": "R37BM6UC5QXLJX", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "We delayed upgrading to HD to let the dust settle a little, and we didn't want to give up our current entertainment center, so finding something under 27\" was imperative. This fit the bill for size and price. We have no previous experience with HD and had to upgrade to HD on DISH Network, too. Now that everything is operating, we are very pleased with this TV. We might want to fine tune color a bit after we're more familiar with the TV, but it is meeting our expectations and hopes and we've high-fived several times today. I ordered this on 5/21 and received it from Amazon on 5/25. Typical great service from Amazon. We had our stereo hooked up to the old TV because the sound wasn't great, but the speakers on the LG are clear and we'll probably not hook up the stereo to this one. We're still learning, but happy.Update: the matte finish of the screen is wonderful. I have reflections on the frame from my window blinds that cannot be seen on the picture.

I bought LG 26LD350 online at amazon in May 2010. It had excellent picture quality, good sound and amazing price. I bought it mainly for PS3 games. That was before.Lately, I have been experiencing problem with the LG 26LD350. In the past few days, after watching TV programs for about one hour or so, it shuts off by itself and would NOT turn back on. A red light keep flashing at lower right-hand corner. Then about 30min later, it turns back on by itself. I knew I should have bought Japanese brand when it comes to electronics, ie. Sony.I will be contacting LG customer service to get the TV fixed. Hopefully, it won't be much of a hassle. For sure I will update my comment later.Update 12/28/10:LG customer service told me to do something called \"hard reset\"; unplug the power cord, press and hold the power button for about 1 min, then turn TV back on. Well, so far so good. It has been a few days and it does not shut off on its own. I am not sure if this problem is fixed for good; fortunately the TV still under warranty.If any other people have experienced problem with LG TV, please share comments.", "Date": "December 23, 2010"}, {"Title": "Clear voice setting wonderful for those hard of hearing", "Author": "Marina Moonlight", "ReviewID": "R3PUMD6V7NN77U", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "So many helpful and comprehensive reviews have already been given for this wonderful TV, so I will keep my comments to those things which aren't often stressed.For me, the Clear Voice audio option has made it so that I can actually hear voices clearly, and not have to use closed captioning and subtitles. At first, I didn't realize that there are actually different levels that you can set the Clear Voice to. When I set it to the highest level, it was a revelation. You can also keep the Clear Voice on, and at the same time have it set to Music, Cinema, etc. And the power for the speakers is 14 watts, which is higher than most TV's of this size, making the audio quality even more impressive. It also has a feature which limits the sound of commercials relatively equal to that of the programming, another terrific feature.The four holes for attaching the stand to the TV are deeply recessed, so when setting up the TV, have a screwdriver with at least a 4\" handle ready, preferably with a magnetized tip. Do not screw the screws in too tightly. The heads of the screws are soft, and strip easily if you need to unscrew them.The one serious drawback to this TV is that it is an energy hog if you leave it on standby after you have shut it off. The bright red light that remains on must use at least 20 watts. The solution is to put the TV on a power strip, and turn off the strip after you've turned the TV off. You will not lose your settings. The reason the TV did not receive an Energy Star rating is because of the high \"vampire load\" it carries when it's turned off. If you use a power strip to turn it completely off, it's actually more efficient than most TV's because you can use energy savings settings, including a no picture option when you are just listening to music. Please be kind to our planet (and your wallet) and use a power strip.26\" is a completely adequate size for a bedroom (mine is 12' x 14') and makes it easier to set up and haul around, a good choice if you're not very strong. As has already been stated, at this size 1080 pixels will not really improve the quality of the picture, and may actually cause increased trailing.The only other comments have been already stated by others- picture and sound blows away the competition, at an excellent price (a steal at $300 through Amazon.)", "Date": "December 12, 2010"}, {"Title": "Solid price for a great buy.", "Author": "Lordzz", "ReviewID": "R12XW4HH9V9JW6", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Understand that I'm the kind of person to be very particular about the brands of electronics I buy.

I already had an LG BluRay player and wanted to purchase an LG TV for the convenience of being able to use one remote for both devices. The TV was very easy to set up and the remote is comfortable to hold and simple to operate.  The colors on the TV are extremely sharp. Sound quality is exceptional and I rarely go above 10 or 12 for movies. I didn't care for the feature that is supposed to keep speaking voices at a level louder than the background noise. I would rather listen to the movie as the director intended, so I only use the TV's default sound settings. I also like the swivel base on the TV.  I have hooked my TV directly to the cable line and the regular cable comes in perfectly. I already had a cable box/DVR in the living room with a bigger TV and didn't see the need to rent another box. However, I have been really impressed with the quality of the images from regular cable.  It is also a snap to hook up to a laptop computer to watch movies streaming from Hulu, Netflix, Amazon, iTunes, or any other site. Other than wishing the TV was priced in the $250 range, I have absolutely no complaints. I did think the price was high compared to Visio and Sanyo, but I have been so satisfied with the quality, that I believe the extra money was worth it.", "Date": "September 22, 2010"}, {"Title": "great bedroom TV", "Author": "Shari Irving", "ReviewID": "R3JSC220C91KWK", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I got this TV for my bedroom and really like it.

Great picture, easy to operate controls, terrific sound (it's better with the HDMI cable, still OK with analog audio connections). Also, it looks good, with a relatively small bezel -- some TVs have too much surrounding the screen.Both HD and SD content looks great using HDMI or component connections. I thought the image was a little soft when using the composite video input, and I couldn't get the colors adjusted the way I prefer. I didn't try using the coax input, because the FIOS DVR doesn't have that option. But there are enough adjustments for my needs using HDMI or component video (I'm using component to connect to the DVR -- it connects faster than HDMI, because there is a short communication lag -- didn't bother me, but annoyed my better half).Really, the only flaw so far has been the set-up instructions. Instead of a colorful, one page \"Start Here\" poster or flyer, as I've seen with Vizio and Panasonic TVs, the LG comes with more complicated instructions. Not a huge deal, but considering this is a top tier product, I expected a friendlier package. But if that's the only negative, I'm happy.

Did not have much space, as this tv was going in a corner attached to the wall with a cheetah bracket.  Doors on both sides of the tv I had to be careful in choosing size. This is for use while on the treadmill approx 6-7 feet from  the tv in the sun room.  The picture is most excellent and the first channel I tuned on had snowboarding.  So there was action and my LG tv picture was awesome for as I watching the snowboarders, my heart was in my throat...So in my opinion, it is quite fine to watch that kind of action.  The weight is easy to handle when holding in place while attaching the wall bracket and yes best to have help when putting on wall.  I just wish I could crank up the volume to over ride the treadmill, but then I guess that is really not the problem of the tv.  This is my second LG the other being for the bedroom and is a 32 inch.

If you place this 26 inch tv on a dresser in my opinion it will be very steady on its stand (which is supplied) as long as you do not have it in the reach of little ones.  My bedroom LG sits just fine on the dresser, although for both size tvs you do have the option of attaching it with screws (supplied) through the dresser top for extra support...but that i found very unnecessary.The Cheetah mount for the 26inch tv was very easy to install and this is the one I choose Cheetah Mounts 23\"-37\" LCD TV Wall Mount Bracket with Full Motion Swing Out Tilt & Swivel Articulating Arm for VESA 200 100 Flat Screen Flat Panel LED Plasma TV and Monitor Displays.

While I would not pay the suggested price, the Amazon price makes this a terrific buy. You get one of the best pictures from any maker. You get a built in easy to use adjustment system that approaches what an expert calibrator can do. You also get a solid stand, (if you're not wall mounting) unlike the junk that I have seen and read about for some cheap models. The sound is way above average for a TV of this size, no problem with volume, you won't come anywhere near turning it all the way up, again unlike what I am reading in other TV's reviews. The \"Clear Voice\" feature really works, it makes the dialog really stand out if you have some problem hearing. While turning up the base only adds a little, the sound is not tinny, certainly not like many small TVs. It has several aspect choices, and several inputs. (TV ant, two HDMI, one Component, one Composite, one Computer) I have had a 46\" LG of a very similar model for about a year and half and it has performed perfectly. They both have a contrast setting that when combined with other settings correctly makes the picture stand out like almost no other TV, yet look realistic. It has some type of a matt finish on the screen as does my bigger model, that really does a good job of diminishing reflections and supposedly adding depth to the picture.I can not think of a downside for this TV.

Harris", "ReviewID": "R1OPGL5XUY8WQS", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This is an updated review. I decided instead of updates to do the whole thing over again. This is an excellent T.V. I love it. I will describe in detail what I love about this tv.The SoundThe sound is very good for a flatscreen T.V. It has a nice solid sound, not tinny at all. There is plenty of volume, especially once you use the Clear Voice feature. It makes every sound louder, not just the voices. Once I turned it on, I had to turn it down, way down. I bought this T.V. is particular because of the fact that it had thick speakers. In the early mornings and later in the night, I keep the sound low. In the middle of the day when there is more action, I have to turn it up more, but not past 15. For some shows that I really get into, I turn it up to 20 (out of 100) So there is no problem with that. Obviously you will not get Bose quality sound, but it's not at a Bose quality price. The sound is just as good as older T.Vs. I had a Vizio that I sold back, and that had great sound, but this is just as good. This has better volume control, no uneven changes of volume when going from 1 number to the next.The PictureI have fallen in love with the picture, it being the 5th day of ownership. With my former T.V., the Vizio, the picture was why sent it back. Sorry to say this, but it sucked! The tv had to warm up for 5 minutes, not in this day and age will I allow that. For the first 5 minutes, there were waves coming from the center of the screen that were too obvious to overlook. I would be embarrased to have a guest over and them see this. But, this LG tv doesn't do that. It is ready to go from the start. There are plenty of picture settings, so that you can fine tune it to your taste. With the Vizio, there was always a reddish hue in the screen. I could never get the settings the way I wanted them. With this, only simple adjusting was needed. The blacks are black, the reds are red, the blues are blue, etc. Everything looks really good. I have no HD device, so I can't say how that is, but standard def is amazing. I have never seen such a great picture with my other TV, or the two before that one. They had lines in the picture, with this one you can hardly see them even up close. The viewing angle is great, which is exactly what I wanted. I have yet to try a DVD, but my playsation is great and I'm sure the DVD will be breathtaking. Don't be discouraged by this being a 720p, it is just as good a 1080, and I would never complain about it.OtherThe apperance of this television is great. I love the fact that it has a swivel stand, that is a nice feature. The cleaning cloth it comes with is great, it works exclellently. All TVS should come with one. I'm glad this did, because the Vizio I sent away also had one. So I have made no compromises with this one. The full manual is not printed, it is on a CD, which is fine. The T.V. is easy to figure out anyway. The remote is nice, I love the Q. Menu, which give you quick access to sleep timer, aspect ratio, picture mode, etc. The remote is sturdy and is much easier to put batteries in than the Vizio. I'm not knocking Vizio, just the TV they idiotically produced. Also, the remote sensor on this TV is better than the Vizio. The Vizio had a delay and you had to point the remote directly at the sensor. With this, I could point it in the opposite direction and it still works.So, I would recommend this to anyone who wants a quality TV, for a great price, especially at Walmart where I got mine. This is best suited for bedrooms, but surely can be used for some living rooms, kitchens and such. This was my first LG product ever, and will not be my last.UPDATEAbout a month after it came. I love this TV so much. Everything about it is so great. I have watched many TV shows. I love the cleaning cloth, it's so effective.

I was going to go with a slightly cheaper brand/model, but found that some of those had terrible viewing angles, which is a huge factor for a bedroom TV that will most likely be up higher or off center.  That is not the case with this TV.  It remains crystal clear from whatever angle you throw at it!PROS:  Clean look and simplistic design.  Wide viewing angles.  Sound quality.  Remote.CONS:  For it's use as a bedroom TV...noneI've had the TV for a year now, and no complaints.  It exceeded expectations as a bedroom TV.  For general channel flipping and the occasional DVD/Blu-Ray, it's perfect!LG makes a fine product that I have recommended to many and will continue to recommend.  I've lead friends and family to the purchase of a 42\" and two 55\" LG TV's since buying this one.  I highly recommend the LG 26LD350!8/15/12 UPDATE:We've had this TV since December 2010 and it's still perfect for our needs.  It's excellent for channel surfing or the occasional movie.

Now both remote sensors have gone out again and even with an extended warranty purchased through LG, they will not cover any more repairs because the cost of repairing exceeds the TV value, but they won't replace the TV either.
