Before I purchased the unit, I read numerous reviews about others hearing a \"Buzzing\" noise. In life, I work as a Detective/Investigator, so, I dove in deep on what to buy. I shopped everywhere from Sears Electronics, Best Buy, Local Television Electronics shops. I finally purchased the  unit about 3 weeks later from ABC Warehouse (They gave the best price). Plus, I personally didn't want to shell out 1800 bucks for my TV and have to risk damage during delivery. Pay for a unit you have to wait for and then risk it arriving broken?! Not for me. :)  Every place I shopped, I could hear \"NO BUZZING\". I inquired about the buzz with the folks at Samsung as well as a local Repair shop. I was told it's due to outside interference. The unit comes with 3 cylinder type filters that need to be PROPERLY placed around both ends of the POWER CORD. There is an instruction leaflet in the paperwork. However, it's in 'Metric' so I gave it the 'ol college try and had no problem with placement. I purchased a Dual Arm Articulating Wall Mount from Ebay for 80 bucks with free shipping, (Awesome Mount!), I Called over a friend to help me lift the screen into place and WOW!!! So much better than my LG - 55\" LCD TV - 1080p. The Samsung has \"Beautiful RGB Colors, Rich Black/Dark colors, with No haze in the picture\". I have a ceiling fan with light that you can barely see in the reflection from the screen. Their anti-glare is great! And the plus, I HEAR NO BUZZING!!!! Now, I don't know if this plays a factor, but I do have the system running through a HTIB (Home Theater in a Box) LG Blu-Ray system. But the fact is, I hear no buzzing or any other annoying sound. It has an Awesome Picture and is very user friendly. I did notice that on the \"Dynamic\" setting, \"Reds\" where slightly higher than I would prefer. Problem solved by going into the Picture Menu. Easy Peasy! My set up is as follows, Samsung PN58C590 58-Inch 1080p Plasma, Dish Network HDTV, LG Home Theater Blu-Ray Disk system, and an Xbox 360. All connected and running flawlessly.", "Date": "April 7, 2010"}, {"Title": "Great TV.", "Author": "Rmmoll", "ReviewID": "R357HD9KF4C784", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Its big and vivid.

That said, this Samsung Plasma is highly recommended. I replaced a rear-pro DLP, and this Samsung betters it in every way. The blacks are inky, sometimes fading into the piano black frame, the colors are saturated, and very accurate, with much detail. Others have commented about buzz, but none heard on my unit. Also, others have observed a pinkish cast, which I did, as well, but Samsung has given us a lot of picture adjustments, and white level balance is also a user menu adjustment, not in the service menu. I was able to get pure whites here, and the images are now correct.The 24p playback does not elimate judder, but switching it off in the BD player solves this with no degradation observed in the image, but it now is smooth. I'd give this display an \"11\" if the 24p worked, but it is still 5 stars worthy. Highly recommended!", "Date": "July 2, 2010"}, {"Title": "Great Picture", "Author": "Brian Lindsey \"Brian\"", "ReviewID": "R2PLN4G90PQY2D", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Purchased this TV a week ago.

I cannot find this unit locally so I decided to order it online (first time I have every ordered a TV online).  Product shows up, box looks good and on initial inspection the TV looks just as good.  Well, thats about as far as it got.  TV has sound but the screen doesn't work.  Called the shipper, they are sending a repair person out to look at it.  Kind of sucks and after a closer inspection of the unit we found some dents on the metal back cover (looked like it had been dropped) and the screen has a small smudge or scratch on it.  I knew that it was a refurbished TV and was willing to accept some factory flaws but was not expecting the TV to not be in working condition.  I am still waiting for the repair people to call me back so it can get resolved.Everything was great up until we plugged the unit it.  The buying experience was 4 stars, the product delivery was 4 stars, the product itself... one star.", "Date": "December 28, 2011"}, {"Title": "Great Picture, but still buzzes...", "Author": "Jeffrey T.
