I'm glad I waited, as this TV is clearer and more vivid than those of some older models or rival brands. Picture quality is clear with no fog or motion blur. PS3 games and Netflix look absolutely amazing. The only thing this TV needs now is a sound system to broaden the audio experience. If you're having sound issues, try messing around with the 'steady sound' and 'clear voice' options to even things out and make them less muddy.In stores you may see this TV's picture slightly less bright than others, but that is because of the built in light sensor that's located on the front of the frame. The picture automatically adjusts to best fit it's surroundings, and that's what's truly great. No fussing with brightness settings all the time.Overall, worth every penny. Stick with Sony and you won't be disappointed.", "Date": "May 15, 2011"}, {"Title": "Sony - Simply The Best", "Author": "Robert N Victa \"Bob\"", "ReviewID": "R39MB1UZZ9L2BP", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "The SONY KBL32BX450 with high definition 1080p is an entry level model with outstanding picture quality. This is a highly recommended HDTV for you.I had researched purchasing HDTV for the bedroom and the SONY is better than the rest (LG, SAMSUNG, PANASONIC and budget models). You pay more for the SONY but you getting a SONY. It is worth the difference. Do not compromise.This is a new 2011 model with basic features. There is no Wifi, this is 60Hz and is not an LED TV (however picture quality compares to LED sets). There are only two HDMI ports that may not be enough for some people. The only \"complaint\" is the sound quality. You will need to adjust the bass/treble and use the equalizer in Custom Mode. It is the same issue that flat screen sets just don't have great speakers. Regardless, this is an excellent television.There are enough settings with options to calibrate and customize the picture to your liking. It is best to disable the ambient light sensor that restricts the brightness and vivid contrast of the picture. Once calibrated, the picture is awesome. The fleshtones are realistic. There is abundant contrast with the blacks are coal black and whites are bright white. The colors are vivid and vibrant. The set will require picture adjustment and calibration out of the box. Motion blur is almost non-existant for a 60Hz set.The features and specs of this set are well documented. You have a USB port to view pictures and videos.If you are very budget conscience then consider the SONY 720p model KDL32BX320. This is also a great set but you don't pay for the Full HD. If you won't do gaming or watch BluRay then this may be for you. If you are looking to install in your living room then look for a SONY with a larger screen.I purchased this from a store with special grand opening sale but wanted to post review for Amazon folks. I would typically buy from Amazon.", "Date": "June 17, 2011"}, {"Title": "Perhaps the best value for the money out there.", "Author": "Deacon Frost", "ReviewID": "R2E2YUM8M1BWID", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "For those seeing the 1 or 2 star reviews, do yourself a favor and ignore them as they address aspects of the TV that are common knowledge to anyone who has done their research and are flaws present when shopping for ANY TV of this type.This is doubly true for the speakers - if you're expecting a massive wall of sound from any TV's internal speakers then it's a wonder you were intelligent enough to type a review on Amazon.Now, on the the important stuff.From a presentation standpoint, the TV is understated and classy. The glossy black bezel is attractive in it's simplicity, with the only deviation of color being a thin strip (about 1cm) of dark gray at the bottom of the TV. The gray strip house the sensor bar and small power leds.This is a 'budget' TV, and with that classification aside, the image quality on this TV is amazing. After some careful calibration, the picture shows deep, dark blacks, vivid color, sharply honed detail, and extremely smooth motion.Despite having a lower refresh rate than higher-end sets, this TV gives fluid, artifact free motion - even in action scenes with lots of quick camera cuts.The image quality is on-par with much more expensive sets, and given the actual price of this set, the image quality alone makes this TV worth a buy.However, there are caveats and they present themselves most notably in the inputs - or should I say, the lack thereof.It's with the inputs where you realize where Sony skimped in order to deliver a set of this size at this price.You get 2 HDMI, 1 Component, 1 Composite, 1 Coaxial, Analog and Digital Audio inputs, a VGA, and a USB input.This input scenario posed problems for me, as I have far more devices than this TV can accommodate on it's own.I have 3 HDMI devices), 1 Component device, 2 Composite devices, and 2 coaxial devices. In order to hook everything up to this TV I had to purchase an HDMI switch, along with a composite splitter and a coaxial hub.Needless to say not everyone will have a plethora of video game consoles hooked up to their TV, but I do, and the lack of inputs made for one heck of wire mess behind my TV.However, my last TV had 3 HDMIs, 3 Components, 3 Composites, 2 S-Video, 2 Coaxial, Digital and Analog audio, and a DVI. So I could just be experiencing 'Input Shock' after having so many options.As an aside, the VGA input works well, and integrating the computer with this TV is quick and painless. The resolution is fine so long as you have a video card capable of supporting such a large picture, but that isn't really an issue unless you're using this TV to play PC games.In conclusion the 46bx420 is an excellent TV on it's own, and it's even better when you consider the image quality you're getting for the price. The lack of inputs is disappointing if unsurprising, but for the average user the available inputs will likely be more than enough. Again, the sound from the internal speakers is lacking but as I said, that's a no-brainer - you really should have a proper surround sound system hooked up to this TV if you're watching movies or HD media on it anyway.This TV is a great buy, and easily outperforms the competing models in it's class, and it does it for less to boot. Pick it up if you're in the market for a TV in this size - you won't be disappointed.", "Date": "September 7, 2011"}, {"Title": "I finally own a SONY HD LCD!", "Author": "Buddy2Mello", "ReviewID": "R3CMSDCO50LXYL", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This Sony LCD is one of the best deals anyone is going to get.  Like the other guy mentioned, I purchased mine directly from WalMart for $588!  The image quality is outstanding.  I have made a few tweaks like lowering the brightness, to help achieve deeper blacks.  I will use a image calibrator later.  The screen does have a slight glow at the top corners, but that is only visible during extremely rare black-out scenes.  I noticed it while loading Blu-Rays, but once the movie starts the screen is very vibrant!  The sound quality is not all that refined.  I don't have money for an Audio system or receiver so I will just have to fiddle with the settings like bass and treble till I find the optimum tune.  There are plenty of A/V connections, a plethora of options in the menue to fool around with, and a great remote.  I have a PlayStation 3 hooked up by HDMI cable.

This tv just came out in february and is a no bells and whistles Sony Bravia. No led backlighting, no swivel stand, no internet apps etc. just a solid lcd tv with a great picture. I like it just as much as my two panasonic plasmas except for the viewing angles. They are not bad, just not as good as the plasma's. The picture is great right out of the box. Nice and natural.  Believe it or not I couldn't really improve the picture no matter how much I played with it. In the end, I just lowered the color saturation a few notches and changed the tone to warm 1 and that was it. I noticed no motion Blur even though it is only 60hz. This is such a solid set that in this case I feel the old adage, less is more, really applies.

We noted that when a bright light was shining on the screen, one could see a faint picture, so we concluded that the backlight was not functioning. We called Sony Support (after hours) and got a response and the technical person on the line did a troubleshoot with us. Sony support concluded that a board needed replacing and that they would arrange to have a service person come out to make the repair. They said that someone from the local service representative would call us to make an appointment in 5 days. They never called for 8 days and I had to call them repeatedly to check up on when we would get the call. Suffice to say, even after that, we did not ever get a call. I raised the game asking to speak to higher management at customer support, and I was told that the local service rep \"did not have a person to send\" and that they would be calling us, I asked when the call would be received and the response was essentially, \" could be in a couple days or up to 3 weeks.\" Three weeks would put us beyond the point where we could return the Bravia to Amazon. We opted to return the TV immediately for a refund and to purchase another similar TV - only not a Sony product.

Mehta \"km\"", "ReviewID": "RWFRS6U5621Q0", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I was using 10 year old TV tube, so for me this is the first big LCD TV ever, thus comparison is not going to be fair!I wanted something with good image quality, reliable and within budget for apartment. Looking at various TVs, I knew that I wanted Sony for image quality and potentially can go for Samsung. My primary viewing is cable, DVDs etc. no sports, thus no need for 120 or 240 Hz and did not wanted to pay for it. So based on my criteria this was the best option - based on brand, image quality, price point, size etc.On receiving, it took 10 mins to set it up and get running. Few tunings got what I wanted. But biggest problem has been sound quality. It has 4 options - Mono, Custom, Adaptive etc.. each sounds different as expected but none seemed satisfactory. Some were too high etc. I am sure it can be reduced by changing few parameters but I am not sure it will give clear sound as I expected. I plan to put speaker system, so hopefully it will become non-issue. So if you plan to use TV directly then go and check in some store personally for sounds quality.I did check few places online and ordered from Amazon, but when I visited my local Walmart they are carrying it for ~580, so with tax it would cost the same. Some how, their online store shows same cost as Amazon. I am not sure what was going on but do check local store before ordering.Enjoy!", "Date": "April 21, 2011"}, {"Title": "A great first LCD TV", "Author": "Diane Hartsfield", "ReviewID": "R1D68XDMTKPKO", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This is our first LCD tv and we are blown away with how great this tv is!

Don't let the bad reviews dissuade you.", "Author": "Joseph Izzo", "ReviewID": "R12EB3CRLRCGZ3", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I actually own the 40 inch version of this TV and it's exactly the same only 6 inches smaller so I think that qualifies me to offset some of the silly 1 star reviews here.Here is my review for the Sony KDL-40BX42.I just replaced a 32 inch Toshiba with this 40 inch Sony KDLBX420 and I am on cloud nine. After a little calibration (the factory settings on TV's are always lousy) it looks amazing. I have it hooked up to my PS3 via HDMI and it's like I'm in a movie theater when watching Blu-Rays. I have my Xbox 360 hooked up to the other HDMI and it is just as awesome. Sound from the speakers is just okay, but lets face it, you want a proper sound system. But this one is average for built in speakers on an LCD. I do not get hung up on the 60hz thing. I have played many hours worth of games and watched many hours worth of movies and have not had an issue with motion blur. Films are shot in such a way that there is some normal blur during panning shots anyway. To me, 120hz makes things look too video like instead of film. During really dark scenes you'll notice a tiny backlight bleed in the four corners if you are in a dark room. This is not a malfunction but an inherent flaw in LCD technology and pretty much all brands suffer from it to some degree, from Panasonic, to Samsung. to Toshiba, to LG. Just do a search online for the \"flashlight effect\" You'll see it's an issue on many TV's and many brands. And again, it is only really a slight problem during really dark scenes and on an all black screen. One thing you can do to alleviate this is to turn down the backlight. especially in a dark room. Before I got this Sony I bought the Samsung LND550 and was not happy with the picture. It was slightly on the fuzzy side and color accuracy left something to be desired. Not so with the Sony KDLbx420. The picture is incredible. The other day I watched \"The Aviator\" on blu-ray and there is a scene where there are many colored balloons and party streamers etc. I was simply blown away by the colors. Just eye poppingly good.

Bimson", "ReviewID": "R6UL00O29JFXY", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I have a number of Sony products, including an XBR 52\" HD in my family room. I have a covered deck that is open on two contiguous sides and wanted to add a big screen out there. This TV is the lowest priced Sony on the market right now in the 46\" range. I was concerned that it wouldn't be bright enough for an \"outdoor\" set. It's plenty bright. In fact, I have toned down the brightness for aesthetic reasons and am very happy with the result. I can float in my pool(30 feet away)and watch the San Francisco Giants play baseball. My barbecue is about 25 feet away and I can stand there and watch TV with no problems. The TV is mounted on a Sanus VMSA Silver Flat-panel Wall Mount w/Tilt/Swivel/Arm on an exterior wall under the eaves, so I can swivel or tilt it to gain maximum relief from reflections, depending on the time of day.The picture is typically Sony--excellent--the features all work very well, and I have it ported to my deck stereo system for the sound which is outstanding. This TV replaced a 24\" CRT Sony that has been on that wall for 6 years. I like my XBR best, but this 46\" is everything I wanted it to be. Outstanding value.Amazon's price and 30-day return policy was critical to my purchase, just in case the TV would not have been bright enough outdoors.

Once calibrated and ambient light sensor turned off, the display is bright, accurately saturated, and shadow detail is well above average.  Of the three TVs I have analyzed, with having pros and cons, this KDL-40BX420 does THE best in displaying colors and shadow detail.I found that turning off the ambient light sensor so I can have full control over backlight settings is necessary.  In dark or moderately-lit rooms, the sensor still keeps backlighting low and rendering the display too dark while forcing me to increase the backlight setting.  So, with that disabled, using backlight set to 7, contrast to 97, brightness to 52 (50-52), color temperature set to 'neutral' (or maybe 'warm 1'), gamma +2, cine 'OFF', and all black enhancement set to 'off' provide the best results.  There are other features that will ramp up color and saturation, but quickly end up looking distorted.  YMMV, and Best Buy's calibration procedure will do a much better job to bring out every delicious drop of detail, but out-of-box image quality is remarkably good.  And I don't often get to say that.  But it IS worth considering, as it is time-consuming to do and their process is thorough.  No, I don't own stock in Best Buy. I just call things as I see them, from experience, repute, or inference based on both.)Matte - unlike a previous set I looked at, this Sony has a matte panel.  Glossy is okay, especially if you like looking at your own reflection.  But I'd rather look at what's coming out of the TV.  Not what's being reflected by it.Viewing angle - as with the 32S3000, Sony is using a higher grade, probably a PVA panel.  The previous sets I've looked at use MVA panels - which not only crush shadow detail too much for my liking when looking head-on, they have poor viewing angles where color washes out badly and brightness and contrast gets skewed.  The Sony does a far better job from what I've seen.  Color wash does exist, but it's nowhere near as prominent.  As with the other sets, no major (if any) hue shift was noticed, so it's nice companies are avoiding the use of \"TN\" panels.Weight - this thing weighs only slightly more than LED-backlit sets.  That's amazing.  I was hesitant to buy a CCFL-backlit set due to weight, but for this set it's a non-issue.Sound - I use an external system, so the inclusion of a fiber optic pass-through is great.  Sounds from the set are somewhat flat and nothing to write home about.Connectors - the usual complement exists (2xHDMI, 1xComponent, 1xComposite, 1xVGA, 1xS-Video, 1xBunny-ears-Antennae, etc) but I was hoping for 3 or more HDMI connectors.Power usage:  Of the two previous sets I'd tested, one had cost $12/yr.  The other $15/yr.  This Sony is rated at $22/yr.  That's still pretty darn good, as TVs in this class can suck up $45/yr.More modern sets use LED backlighting (Edge-lit).  The backlighting shaves off energy costs, which is a good thing.  This Sony uses a CCFL tube.  So it uses more energy.This Sony is 60Hz only.  120Hz makes the screen look more fluid and reduce or eliminate ghosting from fast-moving objects.  In some cases, it can turn film and make it look like a \"soap opera\".  In worst case scenarios it won't process the image correctly, creating judder problems that render the feature disabled (and thus not worth the extra money).  But the other reason is to reduce or elimination motion ghosting effects.  Part of me likes it, but part of me loathes it.  YMMV.  But all the 120Hz sets I've looked at have poorer image quality.  The Sony's output is fantastic, but at 60Hz ghosting can sometimes be seen.  For me, I want the shadow detail and good viewing angles.  Even if it means a slower screen.  The ghosting is there, it's on par with my 32S3000, and isn't annoying.  Especially having played the field.Here's the kicker:  Many modern HDTV sets put most processing emphasis on Blu-ray and HD media, while ignoring SD material (DVDs, streaming SD media, some broadcast).  As a result, interlacing artifacts are often seen and stand out badly, and there is horrible judder during camera pans.  Judder that is not corrected by 120Hz mode.  This is due to the TV set's processor not handling the 480i signal adequately.  One set I otherwise adored had MASSIVE judder and interlacing problems when playing SD material, forcing me to configure the player at 480i - and even then that TV still had problems, prompting a return.  :  I say all of this because most of us have plenty of DVDs in our libraries.  Display quality, across all mediums, is important, and Sony - as usual - delivers.  And, of any theater component, the least variable is going to be the TV set - therefore it should have the best quality processing circuitry.  DVD players break far more often, and low-end ones definitely don't have processors to make the signal look good.  It should be and is up to the TV to do everything right.  This Sony does.And just to make sure, upscaling 480i WILL mean a blurrier or jaggy display - regardless of brand.  480i has far less resolution/detail than 1080P.  But  judder (fluid motion during pans) and other issues are NOT concerns with upscaling.  For any resolution. The TV should be able to play back ANY format fluidly, without judder.  If my 4 year-old Sony could play 480i material without juddering during camera pans, no TV today should be having that problem.  Especially if it costs $1000.  The 32S3000 had cost $1000 and still is a rock-solid performer.  It's nice to see the 40BX420 being in a similar league, yet costing 50% less.Lastly, if you're concerned about longevity, even if it's a high-rated brand, individual units can wear out sooner rather than later (A 10 year \"Average\" means some sets will last 20 years, and for other sets they'll last merely 2.  Always get the extended warranty.

That tv lasted 8years with fairly heavy use. We decided to downgrade to a 40\" range model and I throroughly researched brands on consumer reports.com. I opted initially for the 40\" Samsung LED/1080p/120HZ. Upon setup noted that the picture was sticking (macro blocking) when watching HD quality signal with UVERSE. Other than this issue I found the picture to be crisp and the color very good. Decided to take it back and wound up getting the 42\" LG 1080p/120HZ. After turning this TV on, the picture just doesn't compare with Sony or Samsung - skin tones were terrible and the brightness and contrast levels just couldn't get dialed in for my taste; SD video was also grainy. Too many misses for me with LG, so I am taking back. Decided to try this Sony model. I was against it because for the same price you can get 120HZ from other brands (noted above) which is supposed to ensure smoother picture when watching sports or movies with a lot of action scenes. Out of the box I'd say this TV was as good or better than the Samsung LED. I will say that I can see just a slight and occasional delay in the picture when watching a game but otherwise it's a really great picture. Moral of the story - Sony makes great electronics products that are high quality and last long enough to provide good value. I wouldn't waste my time with another brand of tv. You won't be disappointed with this tv.

It has that output but it's fixed and the volume cannot be controlled by the remote control. I actually have to get up and walk across the room to change the volume on my external sound system.

In my humble opinion, a television needs to do one thing well by default:Display an accurate-looking picture with tangible levels of shadow detail.For ALL formats the set is claimed to support (HD, SD, etc).Anything else is secondary, and I'll get to that in a moment.This Sony is pretty much on par with the previous Sony I am replacing (KDL-32S3000). Once calibrated and ambient light sensor turned off, the display is bright, accurately saturated, and shadow detail is well above average. Of the three TVs I have analyzed, with having pros and cons, this KDL-40BX420 does THE best in displaying colors and shadow detail.I found that turning off the ambient light sensor so I can have full control over backlight settings is necessary. In dark or moderately-lit rooms, the sensor still keeps backlighting low and rendering the display too dark while forcing me to increase the backlight setting. So, with that disabled, using backlight set to 7, contrast to 97, brightness to 52 (50-52), color temperature set to 'neutral' (or maybe 'warm 1'), gamma +2, cine 'OFF', and all black enhancement set to 'off' provide the best results. There are other features that will ramp up color and saturation, but quickly end up looking distorted. YMMV, and Best Buy's calibration procedure will do a much better job to bring out every delicious drop of detail, but out-of-box image quality is remarkably good. And I don't often get to say that. But it IS worth considering, as it is time-consuming to do and their process is thorough. No, I don't own stock in Best Buy. I just call things as I see them, from experience, repute, or inference based on both.)Matte - unlike a previous set I looked at, this Sony has a matte panel. Glossy is okay, especially if you like looking at your own reflection. But I'd rather look at what's coming out of the TV. Not what's being reflected by it.Viewing angle - as with the 32S3000, Sony is using a higher grade, probably a PVA panel. The previous sets I've looked at use MVA panels - which not only crush shadow detail too much for my liking when looking head-on, they have poor viewing angles where color washes out badly and brightness and contrast gets skewed. The Sony does a far better job from what I've seen. Color wash does exist, but it's nowhere near as prominent. As with the other sets, no major (if any) hue shift was noticed, so it's nice companies are avoiding the use of \"TN\" panels.Weight - this thing weighs only slightly more than LED-backlit sets. That's amazing. I was hesitant to buy a CCFL-backlit set due to weight, but for this set it's a non-issue.Sound - I use an external system, so the inclusion of a fiber optic pass-through is great. Sounds from the set are somewhat flat and nothing to write home about.Connectors - the usual complement exists (2xHDMI, 1xComponent, 1xComposite, 1xVGA, 1xS-Video, 1xBunny-ears-Antennae, etc) but I was hoping for 3 or more HDMI connectors.Power usage: Of the two previous sets I'd tested, one had cost $12/yr. The other $15/yr. This Sony is rated at $22/yr. That's still pretty darn good, as TVs in this class can suck up $45/yr.More modern sets use LED backlighting (Edge-lit). The backlighting shaves off energy costs, which is a good thing. This Sony uses a CCFL tube. So it uses more energy.This Sony is 60Hz only. 120Hz makes the screen look more fluid and reduce or eliminate ghosting from fast-moving objects. In some cases, it can turn film and make it look like a \"soap opera\". In worst case scenarios it won't process the image correctly, creating judder problems that render the feature disabled (and thus not worth the extra money). But the other reason is to reduce or elimination motion ghosting effects. Part of me likes it, but part of me loathes it. YMMV. But all the 120Hz sets I've looked at have poorer image quality. The Sony's output is fantastic, but at 60Hz ghosting can sometimes be seen. For me, I want the shadow detail and good viewing angles. Even if it means a slower screen. The ghosting is there, it's on par with my 32S3000, and isn't annoying. Especially having played the field.Here's the kicker: Many modern HDTV sets put most processing emphasis on Blu-ray and HD media, while ignoring SD material (DVDs, streaming SD media, some broadcast). As a result, interlacing artifacts are often seen and stand out badly, and there is horrible judder during camera pans. Judder that is not corrected by 120Hz mode. This is due to the TV set's processor not handling the 480i signal adequately. One set I otherwise adored had MASSIVE judder and interlacing problems when playing SD material, forcing me to configure the player at 480i - and even then that TV still had problems, prompting a return. : And just to make sure, upscaling 480i WILL mean a blurrier or jaggy display - regardless of brand. 480i has far less resolution/detail than 1080P. But judder (fluid motion during pans) and other issues are NOT concerns with upscaling. For any resolution. The TV should be able to play back ANY format fluidly, without judder. If my 4 year-old Sony could play 480i material without juddering during camera pans, no TV today should be having that problem. Especially if it costs $1000. The 32S3000 had cost $1000 and still is a rock-solid performer. It's nice to see the 40BX420 being in a similar league, yet costing 50% less. Lastly, if you're concerned about longevity, even if it's a high-rated brand, individual units can wear out sooner rather than later (A 10 year \"Average\" means some sets will last 20 years, and for other sets they'll last merely 2. Always get the extended warranty.

Nicholus \"spotfish2\"", "ReviewID": "R1DZVKXTBYGNSA", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "As other reviewers have accurately written, this TV is EXCELLENT as an external PC monitor.  The SONY manual and SONY support are a little unclear on how to use the Picture-in-Picture capabilities.  I spent the better part of a weekend figuring this out.  First, the manual is CORRECT, but unclear.With the PC (using a VGA cable) in the main window, you can press the \"Options\" button on the remote and select \"PIP\" to see the Coax input, or the composite input (Video 1/2) or an HDMI video input (if that HDMI is video).  If this is your use, you don't need me.  When connected through a VGA cable everything seems to clearly work as it is supposed to.With the PC (Using an HDMI cable) in the main window, you can press the \"Options\" button on the remote and select \"PIP\" and see everything above, but instead of the other HDMI input, you can see the component input.  This was what I wanted, but was frustrated at not seeing the \"PIP\" option.  The reason is the fine text in the manual that says that the HDMI PC input needs to be interpreted as a PC by the TV.If the TV thinks your HDMI PC is a video source, PIP won't work.  So, how do you confirm that it's seeing it as a PC?  Name the input PC?  Nope.  \"Scene select\" as \"Graphics?\"  Nope (but you should do this).  You need to set the PC to send the signal using \"PC timing\" instead of \"Video timing.\"  I'm reasonably technical, but hadn't heard of that.  On the video card on my laptop (Intel Graphics 3000) I was unable to see ANYTHING on video timing in the Windows resolution config screens.Here's how I did it.  While my PC was connected to the SONY TV, from the Windows resolution screen, I selected \"Advanced Settings\"Then, I went to the hardward specific control panel (this was a tab in Advanced settings).  For me, this was labeled \"Intel Graphics and Media Conrtrol Panel\"From there, I selected \"Advanced application mode\" which gave me all sorts of settings.The important one is \"Custom Resolutions\" (which is a bit scary, as you get a Warning about causing instability, additional heat and other damage, etc)  Yikes!After overcoming my fears, I created a new custom resoution (which was the SAME as the auto-detected resolution) of 1920X1080, 32 bit, 60P HZ, but the DIFFERENCE was in the dropdown field which read \"timing standard.\"***IMPORTANT***  This is the thing that you need to change.  On page 44 of the manual it says that the needed standard to show a PC in HDMI mode is \"CEA-861\" and this was the last item in my dropdown list.  (not the default selection which was \"GTF\")Once I saved this custom resolution with the timing of \"CEA-861\", everything LOOKED the same, but NOW the TV saw the HDMI PC input as a PC and when I pressed the \"Options\" button on the remote, the PIP option appeared!Obviously, this is a video card thing, and not a TV problem, but the \"PC timing\" thing is so obscure to most people that hopefully, this helps someone.", "Date": "May 29, 2012"}, {"Title": "Completely Statisfied", "Author": "Sridhar Dawady", "ReviewID": "R31OQX82XJRG3X", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Sony BRAVIA KDL46BX420 46-Inch 1080p LCD HDTV is a great TV.

Turning it off, and tweaking things a little for 10 minutes or so made a big improvement.I'm not using the built-in speakers; they're passable, like most flat panels.The screen is a little darker along the right and left sides of the screen, compared to the center, as though the backlight fades towards the sides. Only noticeable on a white background, and not an issue for me at the price I paid.Love this TV, and highly recommend it.On a side note, got it through the Amazon Marketplace at Circuit City, and the delivery service had no orders to unbox/set-up/test the unit, which was a surprise.

(Most HDTVs don't have this connection.  This is why I bought this Sony.)  This is useful when a television broadcast involves music.* As with all LCD HDTVs:o It is much thinner than a traditional CRT TV, which enables it to fit in some spaces that a traditional TV wouldn't fit.o It is much lighter than a traditional CRT TV, making it easy to move from room to room.  (I normally don't have a TV in my living room, but I can easily set this TV on a table for special occasions when I want to watch a movie in the living room.  In contrast, a traditional CRT TV wouldn't fit, and would be too heavy to carry back and forth.)Significant feature deficits of the Sony Bravia BX42:* Very inconvenient access to favorite channels.  (In contrast, on the remote control for my digital converter box that I use with my traditional (non-HD) TV, there are buttons that allowing scanning favorite channels - which is much more convenient.)  Accessing favorite channels on the Sony Bravia BX42 is very cumbersome - it takes clicking on several different buttons to access a sub-menu.  If you push the wrong button - you have to start over.  Channel surfing via the remote is very slow.  You have to scan through all channels (not just favorites), which is slow on digital TV, and landing on the intended channel is imprecise.  This is inexcusable.* No antenna signal strength meter.* No clock.Picture quality of the Sony Bravia BX42:* Compared with a non-HD traditional TV, the picture is better on some HD broadcasts, such as HD sports events.* On some HD broadcasts, my opinion is that my traditional (non-HD) TV delivers a more pleasant picture.  For example, a close-up of someone's face does not look better in HDTV.  And apparently the TV's digital processor can't resolve small details when there is motion.  (The TV displays small \"blocks\" of the image until the motion stops.)* For non-HD sources (e.g., non-HD broadcast, DVDs), my opinion is that my traditional (non-HD) TV usually delivers a more pleasant picture.  When playing DVDs, the colors are often richer on a tradition TV vs. this Sony HDTV.  (I'm using an Oppo DVD player that supposedly offers excellent up-scaling, and yes, I've adjusted every available picture setting on the Sony Bravia BX42.  I'm not using a BluRay player because none of the videos that I watch (opera) are available on BluRay.)The sound quality of my traditional (non-HD) TV is better than the Sony Bravia BX42.My advice is that if you have a high quality traditional TV and you're happy with the quality of the picture and sound, don't automatically buy into the HDTV hype.  If you need a thin and/or light TV, or watch sports that are available as an HD broadcast, then an HDTV offers advantages.  My opinion is that many people are blindly buying into the marketing puffery associated with HDTV, just as many people bought into the hype when transistor based hi-fi equipment was introduced.  Today many people, including me, prefer the sound of tube based hi-fi, and I think that eventually some people will realize that they prefer the picture quality of a CRT based TV.On-line shopping at Amazon is very convenient.", "Date": "December 18, 2011"}, {"Title": "Good picture but poor tuner", "Author": "Gary", "ReviewID": "R3NPVJC2B7OMZN", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I bought this TV for a primary TV in my camper.The setup was easy and the TV worked very well except for one thing.

In viewing a number of TV's side by side, in my eyes the Sony was the most realistic without being overly bright. The flat black frame is nice also, as I find glossy clear ones too reflective and distractive. My mine gripe is this TV is small enough to be used in the bedroom or small rooms where there may not be room for a full audio system; yet there aren't audio options that would be helpful in a small room. I have some great Bose PC speakers and some Self Powered Studio monitors that I'd love to hook up for sound; the problem is there is NO headphone jack on this TV. Also, the RCA outs are fixed, so you can't control the volume with the Sony remote. Some Sony's have the option to go to the settings and change the RCA to Fixed or Variable, but not this one. Audio is a huge part of the entertainment system, and a TV this size should have options for the bedroom audio like Headphones and/or variable RCA outs. Boooooo on Sony for not having these features.

I didn't want anything too fancy since the TV would be in a bedroom and mostly used for gaming. I own many Sony products and have never been disappointed. I think this TV is perfect for a bedroom. The picture is great, for me it was easy to adjust the settings, and setting it up with my Playstation 3 was super easy. I feel like I got much more than what I was expecting.My only complain has nothing to do with the TV itself. When I received it there was a GIANT hole in the box. The UPS delivery guy told me that the hole was on the opposite of the screen so it shouldn't be affected. He was right but whatever made the hole also made deep scratches in the back of the TV.

I like to use the GUI and it won't output to the TV, since I don't have a video out to the TV. So, to bypass the fact that the HDMI port on the TV does not have ARC, even with an ARC capable cable plugged in, you have to use the Toslink fiber optic cable from the TV to the receiver then plug the BD directly into your TV HDMI port.

I had a SONY Bravia in the past and it lasted for years, one of those big 2 person to carry type tube TV's whihc was till working great when I got rid of it.After my husbnad died I had no one ot help me move it and decided to go to  a flat screen.A year ago December I purchased a SAMSUNG 40\" at Sears.  It was sort a gift to myself as my husband had died a few months earlier and the evenings can be long and lonely.THe SAMSUNG had problems from the start but I thought it was due to the cable service ( or lack there of ). I would be watching and all of a sudden the picture would go away and  window would pop up saying weak or no signal, or there would be no audio, or there would be numerous stops and starts whcih as I said I attributed to the cable company. In January ( a month after the warranty ran out) I was watching when the audio went out, so I checked the back of the TV ( SAMSUNG) and the antenna port was loose which interferred with the cable staying in the port, I wiggled it a little and the audio would came back but unless you held a certain way the audio would not stay. After looking things over and trying a couple of things I found that the cable would not go all the way into the port which is why the TV never worked as it should have . I contacted SAMSUNG and of course they would do  nothing since it was out of warranty by a month.The SONY arrived quickly , I was very concerned because the packaging was badly damaged, I immediately contacted AMAZON and they said to go ahead and open it and  make sure everything works, which I did and it has been fine. I got it all installed and turned it on and VIOLA! I had no idea how much I had been missing!  I was getting more channels than with the SAMSUNG ! The only difference between the two was the size ( 40\" verses a 46\") . The picture is awesome and it is very easy to manuver around the various options . Watching movies is wonderful! For the price I think it was a good value. I don't  watch lots of TV  but when I do want to enjoy it. I found no distortion when changing the width of the picture which I did have on the SAMSUNGI have an Amazon store card and they offered me no interest for 24 months with no interest, which I can handle easily on my widows benefits . I also lucked out , my son gave me an Amazon Kindle Fire for my birthday and withit came a months free of PRIME so I received it in just a couple of days.I moved the SAMSUNG to the guest room , it works with limited ability to receive channels but it is still good for watching movies so will be okay for when my Grandson visits and wants to watch a movie!I highly recommend This SONY television", "Date": "March 31, 2012"}, {"Title": "Sony Bravia 40 inch HD TV", "Author": "Bex", "ReviewID": "R1KGRICHL9GU0S", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Sony Bravia 40 inch hd tv.

I have been researching for quite a while to replace my old 27\" Toshiba. It was 15 years old and I had already repaired it once myself when the verticle deflection went out, I didn't want to wait till it went out again (and be beyond my ability to repair) and have to buy an HDTV at the going market rate. When this SONY went on pre-super bowl sale for $518 (and I had a credit card promotion in conjunction with Amazon to get an additional 5% cash back) I jumped on this as an excellent value. I ordered from Amazon on Sunday night January 22 and received it Wednesday afternoon January 25 on free super saver shipping! Fortunately I did not pay for fast delivery, it just shipped that fast. I had read several previous reviews where that was the case and would advise anyone buying an HDTV from Amazon to NOT pay for extra delivery since it already comes that way by default. I was very happy with the speed of delivery and the value.Now, about the TV itself. The packing was excellent, it would take quite some effort to damage it in it's box. It was easy to unpack; as soon as I opened the top there was a one sheet pictograph set of instructions on how to properly unpack. Attaching the base was easy and quick. Other than connecting the cables, that was the only assembly required. This is a basic entry level HDTV, it does not have internet, 3-D, or a multitude of HDMI connections. It has two (2) true HDMI, a component (which can carry HDMI excluding 1080p cinema), a PC VGA (which they count as HDMI) and they advertise this set as having 4 HDMI inputs in some of the web sites. It has PiP (Picture in Picture), BUT, and an important BUT, it appears it's only for the PC input to allow one to watch a program and see their computer on the same screen. I haven't fully explored that option yet, when I do, I'll come back and add/edit my review. If you're a gamer or have a number of HDMI devices you may need either an HDMI switch or get another TV with more \"true\" HDMI inputs. I personally don't like to combine too many functions in one piece of equipment, for instance I've never bought a combo TV/VCR/DVD since if one of the add on's die you'll have to buy a seperate item later. I purchased, through my company's employee rewards program so no cash cost to me, a SONY Blu Ray player with internet capabilities, (but that's another review). It provides me with internet and I'm one of the 20% or so where 3-D causes eye/head ache issues. Bottom line, entry level has all I want/need but I want to detail this enough so that if you're looking for more, then you'll know to look for something else.The image is vibrant and highly defined with High Def signals and still excellent with Standard Def signals. In my online research, as well as personal experience in different motels, not all HDTV's have good displays of standard definition signals. That was one of my minimum requirements since I have a number of DVD's (not Blu Ray) and some VCR tapes with shows recorded on them. I get both High and Standard Def signals over cable, I haven't connected an antenna for Over The Air (OTA) signals yet, but I hope to do so shortly, just as a back up when the cable drops, and cable always drops some time during the year. There are an abundance of options to tune the picture quality. I realize it does not have some of the discrete controls for the videophile, but for the vast majority of users, there is far more than enough for a great picture for any program, whether sports, Blu Ray movies or regular TV shows. The consumer magazine that rates products like these does subtract points for a narrower viewing angle than some other recommended LCD TV's. Technically, I have to agree, but in my home environment (living room recessed within entertainment style wall unit), I don't and won't be able to view in those wider angles, so that's not a problem for me.The sound is fine, unless you want a \"theatre\" experience, and it has a digital optical output connection to connect to your home theatre system if that's what you want. The built in speakers are downward facing, but still come in clearly. Usually on the scale of 1 to 100 I put it between 35 to 50 depending on the particular show. I will only crank it up higher than that if i'm watching from the kitchen or dining area. There are some problems with the sound, but I believe it is more as a result of the modulation schemes for full broadcast HD (8 sidebands) versus the cable clear QAM (4 sidebands) and how the cable company encodes the 8 to 4 down-conversion. Since I have not connected the antenna for OTA full HD broadcast signals, I haven't had a chance to test that theory. Later when I do, I hope to return and add those comments. The sound is fine on most normal TV shows, sports and news shows. I have an older/pre-HDMI SONY AV receiver amp to which I've connected the TV's RCA analog outputs. That adds and extra depth and clarity even though I only have a basic two speaker system.In summary: purchasing from Amazon is 5 stars, video is 5 stars, sound 4 stars. Only time will tell on durabiity/reliability, but the consumer magazine/web site ranks SONY high on that and my other SONY products bear that out.", "Date": "February 17, 2012"}, {"Title": "Was great when it worked.", "Author": "B.

The EX500 quit displaying half the screen, my new BX420 had vertical blue lines that appeared. Sony tech determined that the lines are because of a faulty panel (same as was said with the EX500).Not sure why, but I seem to have bad luck with sony televisions.Pros: deep inky black when calibrate, nice sound through surround sound system, 1080p works well with bluray.cons: SD image was a bit blurrier than on other LCDs I've seen, sound through tv speakers is a bit muffled, TV panel had issues after only a day.", "Date": "February 16, 2012"}, {"Title": "Sony Bravia 32\"", "Author": "O.

It would be nice to have a third available in the event I wanted to connect a third appliance via HDMI, but again, for us, it is no big deal.We are loyal to Sony because of having had one of their televisions fail. Even though it was out of warranty by a few months, Sony picked up 100% of the cost for repair and parts. They even paid for in-home service.That was years ago and every Sony we have had since has worked perfectly.

So, I just bought this TV today @ Best Buy.  My 16 yr old 27\", JVC-CRT went out last week; it had a good run.  I've been researching the EX500 series as well as other models/brands.  Many buyers and Video Tech reviews mentioned the better pic offered by most Sony models over other brands.  I can appreciate a better price when ordering from Amazon.com or other online offers.  But being my first flat panel TV I wanted to be sure I could take it 4 miles down the road to return it should I find any issues once I got it home.  So I paid about $12 more than I would've from buying online; I can live with that.This model IIRC, has only 2 HDMI; EX500 had 3 but I saved abit less than $100 with this model. And I think the EX500 was 120hz, I'm gona see if I can live with 60Hz of this model for the bucks I saved over the EX500.  I'm not a gamer, play our Wii once in a great while.  Mostly view local cable TV, HBO (rent On Demand movies) and just watch all my Comcast cable channels offered. This set looks huge after watching my wifes' 19\" CRT set the last few days.This being my first flat panel, HDTV, I did not want many of the newer features so I stayed with a plainer version over smart or internet, etc capable one.  I went in to buy a 32\"-37\" size TV but for the price and better looking pictures I went with this 40\" instead. So far it looks pretty nice in my small-ish livingroom.Today, I got it home, hooked up the coax cable, hit a few buttons on the Sony remote and it did the rest in a few mins.  I've only tweaked some pic/color/sound settings abit so far.  And I only have my Comcast SD, coax-cable box to hook it up to, still looks pretty nice to me.  Gonna pickup a HD cable box tomorrow to see how much difference it makes.Watching it right now, hope no issues like others have had arrise. Right now, BstBuy has return policy til Jan 25th for now, so I have a bit of a window to try it out.

Weird, I know, but 1 from Walmart for 607 (filthy sales tax) and 2 from Amazon. Why 2 from Amazon? Because my first one had a dead stuck pixel. STUCK, not dead, but I didn't wanna play around with that crap, so i RMA'd for refund and bought a 3rd. Out of 3 TV's, only 1 had stuck pixels.2. This HDTV is 40 inches. That means I had to move myself 2-3 feet EXTRA away from my Monitor more than my 27 inch. I am currently at 3 and a half to 4 feet. Perfect distance.3. This game plays computer games flawlessly.

I play a TON of different games, I'll even prattle on about which ones. Starcraft 2, Bad Company 2, Skyrim, Bulletstorm, Portal (1 and 2), mass effect 1 and 2, and soon 3. Rift, Wow, SWTOR, TF2, Tropico 3, left for dead 1 and 2, half life, fear, Dragon age origins. THEY ALL LOOK PERFECT.5. Custom picture putzing is MANDATORY. First thing i did was check my video settings on my TV. I changed to custom, and set everything till it was perfect for me, you should do the same should you choose to use this for a monitor.6 Don't get me wrong, I also have a blu ray player attached to my PC. As far as i can tell, It all looks fantastic. I have tried several different blu ray movies, all look great.7. If you find, this TV is not to your liking for movies or sports or others are better, I don't care a ton, everything ive checked over tells me this TV is fantastic for 500ish dollars. therefore, i give it a 5 out of 5.Long story short, in conclusion, if you want a HDTV to double up as a PC MONITOR, this is the baby to go with, if you have the 500 bucks to fork out. If not, then try the OTHER BX420 Model that is only 32 inches, You should NOT need to keep the tv more than 2 feet away, and i'm pretty sure because it's the same model number just different size, it should do the same job. But this baby, is just for me!UPDATE:7-27-12 - Still working great and I love almost everything about it, however there is something I did not mention. This would be the fact that every time i turn on the tv it takes about freaking 15 seconds to turn on.

I am supposed to call, set up an appointment and, if I'm lucky, just take a single day off work waiting and praying for him to show up.This is the third Sony in my house (the other two work great, thanks) but the first two were made years ago when Sony cared about quality and still topped the charts in Consumer Reports. No more.I had done a lot of research and knew the BX-line was the bottom of the line for Sony, but I didn't want 3D or \"motion flow\" or internet connectivity. I just wanted a good, solid TV.Forget it. This TV screams \"cheap.\" It is made entirely of shiny, black plastic that reflects every light in the room. And, oh yeah, it doesn't work.I will revisit this review if/when the set gets fixed, but as for now I would avoid the BX-line.Or, better yet, avoid Sony and try a Samsung. I sure will next time.UPDATE TO REVIEW, June 9, 2011:Well, the repairman just left and after he fiddled with the controls a little - - admitting that he wasn't sure what each one did - - he said the best he could do was get me a \"decent\" picture and poor sound. He also said that it was clear the Sony technician didn't know what he was doing and that it was best to always call Sony during regular business hours in order to get a technician in this hemisphere.\"If I were you, I would get an LG next time,\" he said. \"They are really good.\"Good to know for \"next time.\" No more Sonys for me.", "Date": "June 6, 2011"}, {"Title": "GREAT....", "Author": "M.

But my opinion has changed drastically in the last few years due to a series of failures of their TV's, and now it will be a long time before I ever buy anything from Sony again. It appears that they had chosen to lower their engineering/manufacturing standards and were trying to make a killing using the momentum from their old reputation. I guess it's caught up with them since their electronics group posted a $1.1 Billion loss in the 4th quarter of 2011. It appears that the only thing keeping them alive is their (American) entertainment group (music, movies, etc.).My troubles with them started back in 2006 when I purchased their 60\" SXRD TV. It produced a beautiful picture until the \"light engine\" in it began to fail and had to be replaced. When we moved, I sold that TV and bought a 55\" SXRD that was a better fit for our new home. Again, beautiful picture, but the light engine in this one failed too! I had it replaced and when the replacement failed, I did my due diligence and found there was a class action suit against Sony for these TV's. Based on this suit, Sony replaced it with a 55\" LED/LCD model (KDL-55EX710) but had to pay $250 for the \"upgrade\" (and pay $75.00 to have the old one hauled off). This was in July of 2011, and 2 weeks ago (early March 2012) the upgrade failed. I have been without a TV since and have been told that my warranty does not cover replacement, only repair. The problem is, they have no parts to fix it. Now, maybe the parts problem is a result of the tsunami, which I can understand and I have great empathy for the folks in Japan. But, dammit!, this TV should have lasted more than 8 months! Frustration is setting in, hence my comments.

First of all, you will need cables to make it work, and NONE are included, not even the most basic ones. So, there is no chance you will be able to set it up out of the box.  A trip to Radio Shack is inevitable, and probably several trips before you find the right combination of cables.  Second, the instructions clearly do not conform to the actual arrangement on the back of the set. So, you will have to guess where cables should be connected. How is it possible that engineers can design such a high tech device and not be able to draw a correct diagram of the back panel?  Who knows, but it makes me wonder what else they got wrong. Third, you will need a special kind of screw driver to assemble the mount on which to place the TV on your table.  Even after you find the right screw driver, you will be unable to insert all of the screws because some of the holes are not drilled to line up straight.  Fortunately, the mount seems to hold together without all the screws.  It seems poetically appropriate that this TV will permanently be missing some of its screws.
