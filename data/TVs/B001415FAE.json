{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Very Good Picture Quality, Inferior Tuner Sensitivity", "Author": "Jerry Lundegarde \"Car Salesman\"", "ReviewID": "RYNLNY9I7R8FZ", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I live in a \"fringe\" area for OTA reception in a densely wooded neighborhood 30 miles from the cities and have a rooftop antenna with a pre-amplifier system.  I currently own Hitachi, Sony and Olevia TVs with built in ATSC tuners and find the Toshiba 19AV500U has the most trouble maintaining good reception from several of the HD channels.  I've tried hooking it up to the other antenna leads in the house and results were the same so I've concluded the tuner sensitivity is not as good as my other TVs.  However, when locked-in to an HD channel the picture quality is excellent.  The Toshiba is very attractive with the piano black bezel and adjustable stand.  The interface is simple and intuitive, setup was a breeze.  I found the \"DynaLight\" feature annoying as it seems to randomly change the overall brightness ever so slightly too often.  At first I thought there was something wrong with the backlight because of this \"flickering\" effect.  I discovered that DynaLight is enabled by default.  When I turned it off in the Advanced Video menu the problem was resolved.  Overall this is a very good budget priced LCD HDTV from one of the best names in the business.  This is a darned tootin' fine TV.", "Date": "May 26, 2008"}, {"Title": "Works on my cable without a box!", "Author": "W. Bilofsky", "ReviewID": "R13GOVV329B6IX", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I ordered this TV to take advantage of the HDTV channels available over Comcast Cable in the San Francisco Bay area, without having to rent Comcast's pricey cable box.  It fills the bill perfectly.Using the default settings, the picture is sharp and contrasty.  There's plenty of sound volume.  The screen hardly reflects light at all, which is nice since we have a lot of windows.  The Natural picture size setting chooses the proper picture width all the time.  (I've never figured out why some people view everything in full width, even if it adds 50 pounds to all the people on the screen.)I got a scare when first hooking it up.  I ordered it only after a Comcast agent verified that with the built-in QAM tuner it would receive HDTV just by plugging the cable signal into the antenna/cable coax jack.  But when first turned on, it only received analog signals.  Calling Comcast back, I was told that I would need a $7/month cable box.  Fortunately this turned out to be baloney.  While my wife was channel-flipping, she started getting HDTV stations too, and now it shows every analog and digital channel, even on my non-digital cable service plan.  My wife claims full credit for \"fixing\" it.  I suspect it took a while to lock into some aspect of the cable service.  Who knows.So here's two recommendations:  Double check everything Comcast tells you.  And buy this TV.(Oh - and also see the reviews for the 19AV500U - it's the identical model in black.)", "Date": "June 11, 2008"}, {"Title": "Answer to 16:10 Aspect Ratio Controversy", "Author": "T.

Unless you would pay $1000 for a 19 inch set, I doubt any company will ever custom order a 16:9 panel for television manufacture.A lot of these TV's can be set to 16:9.  There will be a small black bar on the right and left edges since the panel is wider.

However, our experience has been great. This TV worked right from the plug-in. Once the set-up enabled me to select cable vs antenna, the Toshiba scanned and logged all of the channels. Tagging each channel with it's designation (ABC, NBC, HBO, etc) and as a Favorite is tedious, but works. The sound quality and volume are great. Picture quality in low and bright light is also great. It would be very helpful if my cable provider, Bright House, offered a programming guide without a set top box, but that has nothing to do with the TV. Be careful of the instructions for setting up the TV, out of the box. Getting the stand into the standing position seems tricky. You have to strongly push the stand (almost force it) into the upright position and set the LOCK switch. The instructions should say that, but they don't.

We bought it to install in our bathroom.This is a good looking TV, very sleek and smooth. The remote is also very nice. So physically this TV has great qualities.As for its performance, the biggest thing to keep in mind is that it's not actually 16:9. It's something closer to 16:10. So, the image is vertically stretched a bit. I researched this and apparently almost all 19\" HDTVs are like this. I read that It has something to do with the companies also making computer monitors of this same size and not wanting to redo everything.The speaker quality was important to me because I am not hooking it up to a receiver. I'm happy to report that the speakers sound pretty good. They're not tinny, which is the biggest problem with most HDTV speakers. Also, there are bass/treble settings in the menu, which help tremendously.The picture quality is strong on both HD channels and non-HD channels. The blacks and the contrast aren't great, but that is to be expected with a low-priced HDTV.For the price I paid, I'm very satisfied.

However, some of the comments by other customers gave me pause, due to the sound quality as they had reported it. Especially, since I was not positive if they really meant sound quality or volume or both. I have a pet peave with  a television whose sound comes out of the side/back of the set instead of the front (note: this tv has front speakers). Since you are usually sitting in front of the TV. With those sets other sets side/back speakers you have to blast the volume to hear it, but then it is blaring into other rooms etc. I can tell you this TV has excellent volume control and the sound at first seemed a little different from my old tv but nothing unexpected (at first it was like hearing a strangers voice that quickly became a friends familiar voice). So if the sound volume or quality is something you might have concerns about in the purchasing of this TV, let me put your mind at ease (unless you are a sound guru dealing with bass, tremble and all of that) you will not regret purchasing this TV. I feel that this was one of the best purchases I have made for the money in a very long time.

Station reception is very good and we were able to get the cable HD channels (that the Cable company didn't scramble) with the QAM feature.  You must first use the auto channel scan for the TV to know what channels are available.  Otherwise you might think the TV cannot receive many  channels.  You also have to install the base, but the instructions are straightforward and it takes only about 5-7 minutes once you get started.The speakers were irritating to me and sounded almost like turning a speaker face down on the table.  Even thought I know that opening the back of the TV violates the warranty, I did so anyway just to see what was causing the problem.  It appears that the two stereo speakers are partially blocked thus causing the muffled irritating sound.  Since the speaker connections were kind of in the open, I disconnected them and ran the connections to a couple of RCA jacks that I installed on the back cover.  I then plugged in some good 4\" speakers to the jacks and put them behind the TV.  The end results was great sound and great picture.  If the TV had come with the speakers, I would have rated the TV as 4.5 stars (taking into consideration the low price).The mute feature of the TV remote control is great.  The first time you press the mute button, it steps the volume down about 50% which comes in handy for commercials and if a telephone call comes in.  The next time the mute button is pressed, it goes completely mute.

After about a month or two of operation, the other morning it would not \"boot up\" and had a medium bright, blank screen, After several tries, it finally worked again and has since then. I have serious concerns about these TV Monitors for \"MULTI USE\", which are computer chip controlled..!!! Every time the screen flickers, I worry it might \"die\" again...

The lcd screen produced a nice image and nice black levels. Tested it with my cable service including my hd channels. The sound was good too considering its size. Unfortunately, the screen had 2 stuck pixels and 1 dead pixel. I have already sent it back for a replacement so hopefully the new one will be better but since this occurred I decided to read some reviews on other sites and found out that for some reason Toshiba's manufacturing policy with pixels is to o.k. a screen that has 3 or fewer  pixel problems. I hope this is not true. I guess I will find out when my new tv comes in.Update: 1/9/09My replacement tv came in and it works great. I don't understand the complaints about the sound being tiny. For a tv this size it produces really nice sound. I did have trouble receiving any over-the-air channels with the built in tuner but once I hooked up an old hdtv tuner that I bought a few years ago I was surprised to pick up about 10 digital channels and 5 to 6 analog channels. The digital channels were so clear I thought I was watching my normal cable tv.

My friend has a small bedroom and is in LA county CA, so she is pretty close for reception.  I chose the 19\" Toshiba after I saw one at a Sears and determined that the picture was as good as my Regza.I canceled DirectTV when my old box gave out, and decided to see how digital tv was over an antenna.I bought the little white Radio Shack HDTV antenna that is about the size of a DVD case.  It is a powered antenna.  When I hooked it up to MY 37\" in the OC, I got amazing reception.  I decided that I would use that with the 19\" Toshiba 720p LCD HDTV.With my friend's 19\" Toshiba TV, I didn't even have to put the antenna outside, just set it in the window sill.When I hit the auto search for channels, the little Toshiba found 59!  Outstanding picture quality.  As good as the Regza.  The only thing that is a little lacking, is that since it is not a Regza, the tuner takes a \"little\" longer to tune in to the new station when you are channel surfing.  My friend doesn't think that is a problem, however, she is amazed at the breath taking picture.  Also, it does have one HDMI port, the channel menu is less elaborate, but, hey, it's only a little tv.  Her sister even said, \"It is the bomb.\"For the price, can NOT beat it.  How long it lasts, remains to be seen.A big point of this review is that I have only used these Toshiba TV's with \"OVER THE AIR, ANTENNA RECEPTION\" and they are outstanding.

The price was by far the best for a named brand TV of this size.The first TV we received had a dead pixel in the upper left quarter. I returned it to Amazon (effortlessly, I would add, as UPS came and collected it from my doorstep so 5 stars to Amazon for their service!).The replacement TV arrived and that had 2 dead pixels. Amazon refused to replace it like for like the second time because there was obviously a problem with this model. They were going to speak to the manufacturer about it. It was therefore again returned to Amazon who processed my refund remarkably quickly.Whilst we had the TV, my husband did hook it up to a normal Philips DVD player. The sound seemed to be a little out of sync but that was think it was the cables that came with the DVD player as it improved when we swapped the cables. The picture was okay but we didn't see the capabilities this TV had with it being 720p.We hooked up our Sony Blu-ray player and the image was crystal clear. The sound isn't very loud on this TV but it would be more than enough for a bedroom.If you are thinking of buying this TV, or any LCD TV for that matter, I would definitely buy from Amazon.com. They obviously will accept returns with 1 dead pixel whereas many companies won't. We bought a Samsung LN52A650 from Sears and had to buy the extended warrenty as they will only exchange TV's if the dead pixels are the size of a quarter! Always ask about the dead pixel policy if you chose to buy elsewhere or have them plug the TV in and check it before you leave the store. Bestbuy recently did this for us with the replacement TV we ended up buying for our daughter.If you buy this TV I would definitely consider, at the very least, an upconverting DVD player to get the most out of the 720p.

What a disappointment! I had to go into my pile of old computer parts and find a cream colored power cord to use instead of the black cord. I sent the company (Toshiba) a couple of emails trying to get them to send me a \"white\" power cord but they insisted they didn't have white power cords. A week or so later my wife saw a 19\" white Toshiba portable TV at SamsClub and it had a white power cord with it. That TV had a built-in DVD player. I was very disappointed about the cord color. Also, the TV's sound is \"tinny\" and seems to have no bass at all. I don't know if we'll ever get used to the sound. I've actually considered buying a couple of small (white) speakers to use with it. The picture is fine but it takes a couple of seconds to come on and to change channels. Plus the channel number that appears on the screen is much too small to read. Finally, the remote is huge and black! We used to have a 13\" white \"kitchen\" TV and it came with a small white remote. So, Toshiba, I hope you're reading this. You need to go back to the drawing board and get it right. I'm not sure if I'd buy this TV again for these reasons. At the time I bought it, I could find no other \"white\" TV. I bought it for that reason alone...and the size of course.", "Date": "January 6, 2009"}, {"Title": "Toshiba Flat Screen LCD TV", "Author": "Robert Bruce Ferguson", "ReviewID": "R1NCZSDSRDP42P", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Arrived on time, intact and working well.Replaced an old 19\" CRT clunker on which the remote was no longer functioning.", "Date": "July 3, 2008"}, {"Title": "TOSHIBA: Grench that stole Xmas for my daughter", "Author": "L.

Should you have any concerns about what may happen when or if you tv breaks, this is the chaos and frustration you will find in dealing with them.  Please go with a different brand...We bought a TV/DVD combo from Toshiba as a gift from Santa last year for my 8-year old so that she could watch her Full House and Lizzie McGuire movies on it in her bedroom. Unfortunately, after 4 months, the tv's picture stopped working. She told me to send it back to Santa, so off it went to our local authorized Toshiba repairman, as you cannot return these items to Amazon after a certain period of time. We were told by Toshiba that the tv was under full warranty for parts and service. The repairman said no. We would have to pay at least $80 in service repairs. Well, it's been six months and we have yet to see our tv. The part that was supposedly broken was out of stock. Toshiba has sent out part after part after part...spending more in shipping and parts I'm sure than we actually paid for the tv. Now they are shipping out their 4th part...and we still have no tv and it's November. NOTE: the Toshiba representatives were rude and their supervisor (Dave Thomson) was scripted and condescending.  TOSHIBA DOES NOT STAND BY THEIR PRODUCT AND DOES NOT HELP ITS CUSTOMERS.My daughter got so upset that Santa didn't return her tv that we had to buy her another tv a few months ago. Then, she overheard one of the numerous heated discussions between my husband and Toshiba. Every time my husband called, we were told the issue would be \"escalated\". The representatives are scripted and said whatever they could to passify us.  In the end, we were told by Toshiba's supervisor (Dave Thomson) that this was their final decision...to just continue to keep trying to fix an inferior product with no hope that it may get fixed.  By the time we get the tv back, if we get it back, it will no longer be under warranty.In the end, with no return of her original tv and the numerous phone calls to/from Toshiba, my daughter finally got the clue and realized Santa doesn't exist. Thanks Toshiba. MAY NO PARENT EVER RELY ON YOUR PRODUCT AGAIN! THE TECHNOLOGY IS LOUSY AND YOUR CUSTOMER SERVICE IS AN EMBARRASSMENT! GIVEN HOW TIGHT CONSUMERS' WALLETS ARE THIS SEASON, I HOPE PEOPLE LOOK PASSED YOUR BRAND AND SELECT A BETTER CHOICE.FYI...When we purchased the tv, it was not made clear to us that it would be outdated within 14 months with the switch to digital.Happy Holidays from a very dissatisfied customer.", "Date": "November 17, 2008"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "Unavailable", "Features": "19-inch 720p HD LCD TV\nHigh Gloss Black Finish\nDynaLight Dynamic Backlight Control\nPC Input; 1 HDMI", "Name": "Toshiba 19AV500U 19-Inch 720p LCD HDTV (Black)", "ImgURL": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/31uiyh0SsxL._SX300_.jpg", "ProductID": "B001415FAE"}}
