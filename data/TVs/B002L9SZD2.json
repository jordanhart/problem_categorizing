I have been doing research for month on what all the specs mean and what I need in a TV.  If you are new to HDTV I would recommend visiting CNET's site it has a lot of information that is very useful about TVs. Now on to this particular TV, I have tried to be honest.  The SV370XVT picture is better than I had expected for the price.  I was ready to spend a lot more to get a good picture but this TV exceeded all of my expectations for picture quality.  I use my laptop right now to up convert normal DVDs, and all that I can say is that the people look real!  I have an over the air antenna and some channel look as good as the DVDs.  The TV itself has a very nice design, it has a glossy black finish with a thin frame around the screen, and the depth is really nice if you are going to mount it to a wall!  The speakers put out good sound, my parents have a surround sound system and TV doesn't sound that good but it is good.  The remote is very slim and easy enough to use after you get used to it, it has capability to be a universal remote but I cannot get that to work.  The volume and channel buttons light up when you push them (which is nice), but I would like it if all of the buttons did.  The TV offers many different aspect or zoom features which I love.  The media port on the side is very easy to use and I have had no problem viewing video or picture and listening to music.  The 120Hz seems to make the motion very smooth, I have only noticed blur on channel that are not HD.  I haven't played with the picture settings yet but CNET offers a good guide on how to do it.  The picture in picture feature is nice only if you don't want to use it to see what is on another channel (the only reason I really would), it only allows you to see picture from a different input than the one that you are currently playing. I have had no problems with this TV yet (if I do you'll hear from me) and have been extremely pleased with it.  I was extremely skeptical of VIZIO but they have really proved themselves. PROS: Great Picture quality, ease of setup, 120Hz, design, media port, 3 HDMI inputs. CONS: PIP doesn't allow for channel surfing, remote doesn't light all the way up.All in all this is AN EXCELLENT TV!!", "Date": "September 23, 2009"}, {"Title": "Great at first...then...", "Author": "Jennifer \"The Bawdy Book Blog\"", "ReviewID": "RZDJIL4H5RSEW", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "UPDATE 3/9/2012: 2 years & 2 months after purchasing this TV (just after Costco warranty expiration), it has begun to make a rather loud humming noise.  It is so loud, I can hear it over the shows and movies I watch and is distracting.  Sounds like it's dying.  I won't be purchasing from this manufacturer again.Original Review:The review before mine says it all.  This TV is high quality at a great price.  I purchased mine from Costco for 699.99 with a 2 year warranty.  The picture quality is superb; I was watching a movie via Netflix streaming through my Xbox last night and the 120Hz made such a difference over 1080p 60Hz sets I've had in the past.  The panning of the film was so smooth, it was disorienting at first because I wasn't used to it! :)  The TV is lightweight, and it only took me 5 minutes to set everything up, including connecting my Xbox to it via HDMI.  I can't wait to see how it works with my Macbook Pro - I've got a Mini Display port to HDMI connector....Hulu, here I come!Pros: Great picture quality, can be used as a computer monitor, 3 HDMI inputs, good sound, remote is sleek looking, volume and channel buttons light up, set up was easy, thin design.Cons: Sometimes the remote randomly stops working; the trick to this is to take out the batteries for a couple of hours to let it \"reset\" itself.  I don't know why that works, but it does.UPDATE 3/9/2012: 2 years & 2 months after purchasing this TV (just after Costco warranty expiration), it has begun to make a rather loud humming noise.

My first instinct was to go with a big name set, ie (Panasonic, Sony, Samsung, etc) but after much reading decided to give the Vizio a look.  I was targeting the 32\" 60hz model, but after seeing this 37\" 120Hz model and the fact that BJ's reduced their price to $629, the decision was academic.  The picture looks every bit as good as the more expensive models from the afore mentioned companies.  The audio is more than acceptable for regular TV viewing and when I watch DVD's, I use my home theatre system.  There are plenty of menu functions to customize the way you like to watch TV and there are 3 HDMI inputs which are enough for me. I've had the set now for about 1 week as of this writing and have kept it on contantly because if something happens to the TV it's usually witihin the first hours of usage.The TV also looks good when viewing at an angle with no loss of picture quality.  Unfortunately, now I have to spend more money and buy a Blu-Ray player and Blu-Ray discs. I'm afraid this is just the beginning! So, if you're in the market, you owe it to yourself to give the Vizio a look before you buy.  So far I'm very happy and I highly recommend it.Addendum:  I bought a Blu-Ray player and got two blu-ray discs, the new Star Trek movie and UP.  Both look great on this TV at 1080P. The colors, detail, and shading are incredible. Still very happy with this purchase.", "Date": "November 29, 2009"}, {"Title": "A great value but not perfect", "Author": "Michael R. Smith \"Odin\"", "ReviewID": "R2P2SSCRCIHR0S", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "When I purchased the Vizio XVT series tv I was skeptical of a $629.00 price tag and so many features.  Could it really be as good as advertised?  For the most part the answer is yes but there are a few negatives.  My rating of 4 stars heavily takes price into account.  Here is my review:DESIGN:  Personally I think the xvt series Vizio televisions are as nice as anything else on the market.  It features a nice thin glossy black bezel with a fairly simple accent along the bottom that works nicely.  The VIZIO logo on the bottom stays lit which really doesn't bother me.  The tv is very thin which is nice but it feels somewhat flimsy on the stand which does not rotate.  It has enough connections for the average user which are all logically laid out on the rear.BLACKS/WHITES:  The weakest aspect of this tv is that the black level is very poor.  It is better with dynamic contrast turned on but then you have to deal with sudden noticeable shifts in brightness.  If this is the most important thing to you then this tv will not satisfy.  Otherwise, the whites, overall contrast and shadow detail are all excellent.COLOR:  This tv has some of the most realistic colors of any lcd that I have seen out of the box with no calibration necessary.  The colors are not only accurate but they really pop and come alive.MOTION:  The 120 hz feature is very effective on this tv.  CNET wasn't impressed by Vizio's implementation but I have seen virtually no artifacts from it.  If you leave it set to precision and set the motion smoothing to low it does a great job.VIEWING EFFECTS:  The matte screen is very good at resisting reflections and brightness in the room.  The viewing angle is good as long as you are looking at the screen directly centered vertically.  If you look down or up at it things go horribly wrong and the picture washes out.SOUND:  The sets speakers put out great sound.  If you are looking for virtual surround, look elsewhere, even with the feature turned on there is no 3d effect.  Sound is clear and powerful though.REMOTE:  The remote is comfortable but flimsy.  It would not accept programming for most of my devices but I only use it to access the menus anyway.CONCLUSION:  For the money this tv packs in the features and does it well.  There are some negatives... black level, the fact that settings cannot be adjusted for inputs independently etc.  On the positive side there are more preset video modes than almost any other tv that I have seen and without any calibration a satisfactory picture can be achieved.  Standard definition also looks as good on this tv as any lcd that I have seen.  DVD's have an almost bluray effect if well mastered.  Another plus is an attractive and simple menu system.  For all but the most finicky of viewers this is a great set at this price.", "Date": "February 5, 2010"}, {"Title": "Looking for a quality inexpensive HD for your 360 or PS3?", "Author": "D. Denny \"Happy Owner\"", "ReviewID": "R3G0QLK6XT8WYR", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Well if you are looking for a LCD HD T.V. to play games and Blu-rays then, I suggest you check this one out.  I agree with the other reviews about the remote control (not very well liked), but the set itself is unbelievable.  I, like many other reviewers spend a considerable amount of time looking at the stores models as well as hours and hours on-line reading reviews and matching stats.  A few key points:  it is American company (bonus), it is 120hz (one of the cheapes of the kind), it can keep up with Call of Duty Modern Warfare 2 without blur or pixelation. I would say for the Xbox 360 you probably won't find a better choice in this class and size.  I also have a PS3, but only play a few games mostly just watching blurays (which are great). For what its worth, the price point naturally is going to make you skeptical, but don't let your worries of other products following the \"get what you pay for\" model. This is one you may regret passing by.  Oh yes one other thing, keep in mind that the remote is the only way to adjust the settings, so the ones on display at the stores may be decievingly poor video, because they are probably not displaying the proper settings or HD input.  Best of luck in your decision making!", "Date": "March 21, 2010"}, {"Title": "Great TV For This First-Time HDTV Owner", "Author": "T-Lo", "ReviewID": "R219XBY6T35YEX", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Plain and simple: This is a nice TV for the price.I did plenty of research before buying this and after considering the size, price, brand, features and online reviews, this was my choice.  I've had this TV for 4-months now and I have to say that I'm VERY happy with my purchase.I will admit that I was an HDTV noob before buying this Vizio as I never owned one before.  So even though I give this TV a ringing endorsement, I can't honestly tell you if it compares favorably or not to any others.All I know is that it looks great to me and my Xbox 360, Wii and DVDs all look spectacular on it.  I also stream Netflix movies on my laptop and watch them on the Vizio via an HDMI cable and it looks quite good as well.Before buying this TV, my main concern was how standard definition TV would look on it as I do not have HD cable yet.  For those of you who plan on using this with SDTV, I have to say that it looks darn good.  Admittedly, SDTV doesn't look as good as the 4x3 TV that I replaced, but that's understandable since that's the case when viewing SDTV on any HDTV.  After seeing how some other HDTVs handled SDTV, I was pleasantly surprised.In my opinion, the Panoramic screen mode which fills the entire 16x9 area is the best setting to use when watching SDTV.  Things on the screen appear quite proportional and really don't look as stretched as some other HDTVs I've seen.  I have a friend who just bought a 46\" LG HDTV and the screen options for full 16x9 SDTV viewing look drastically more stretched than this Vizio model.  My friend felt things looked so stetched or strange on his TV no matter which viewing option he tried, he now just watches in 4x3 mode with the black bars on the sides.  I must admit that I was laughing on inside because of how much better my Vizio looked in 16x9 mode than his HDTV that cost twice as much.Anyhow, after reading all the helpful reviews on Amazon which helped my make my purchasing decision, I felt obligated to write my own review in an effort to try and help others with their TV buying decision.  I really like this TV and I hope that you'll be as happy with it as I am.", "Date": "April 22, 2010"}, {"Title": "Fantastic!", "Author": "Ryan C. Anderson \"tzn\"", "ReviewID": "R1FQEEWRRYM8HW", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Bought this tv because it fit the room. I think that the Samsung 6,7, and 8 series tvs are superior, but not for the price. The room I am using has quite a bit of light coming in, and the matte finish on this screen is perfect. The Samsung LN40A650 had too much reflection from the light during daytime viewing. I also looked at the LN40A630 because of the matte screen, but it still had a good bit of reflection compared to this Vizio. I think that the screen contributes to the only lacking aspect of this tv. That is the black levels. The blacks are good enough for me, but I know that it might be a deal breaker for some. A notorious problem with Vizio (outside of the LED models). Connectivity is what you would expect of any HDTV that is out. Adjustment of picture settings is very good. There are several modes that can be used for presets, and they can all be customized.If you are putting it in a room without any outside speaker system, it really does well for a flat panel tv. The sound from the tv speakers is better than most other flat panels that I or friends have owned. It is also light and the styling is simple enough that I think it will stand up well for a long time to come.I know that most people say \"good tv for the money\" when it comes to vizio.

The only complaint I have about Vizio is they set the connections up on the back so the point straight back (Into the wall) which can create some clearance problems when wall mounting the TV. The power plug provided is L-Shaped so it is not a problem, but one may need to consider purchasing L-Shaped HDMI and Antenna connections or any of the other provided AV connections.Picture quality is great, lots of tweaks are possible, sound is adequate for a bedroom.

The smooth motion settings are amazing, though film purists will probably hate it. At its highest settings, makes a film look more like video. Not to worry, you can turn the effect completely off if you wish. I suggest you pop in your favorite blu-ray or dvd disk and experiment with these settings. I leave mine set to high/precision and film mode auto, I like the effect. Only con so far is the remote. It stopped working on the 2nd day! Luckily, I have a Harmony remote that I was able to quickly program for the Vizio TV while I wait for Vizio to ship me a replacement. TV is working fine with the Harmony remote. Took about 10 minutes to get through to a Vizio tech who walked me through some testing/reset steps on their remote...still no-go, so they are shipping replacement. Noticed that there is one other review elsewhere with the same issue, so wondering if Vizio has a quality problem with this remote? Tech said they are not aware of such an issue. Still, the remote while having a nice look to it appears to be quite delicate in design. If you are in the habit of leaving it on a sofa or a bed, it might not survive the first time someone sits or lays on it. Not a show stopper, but good idea to have a dependable universal remote on hand.", "Date": "January 10, 2010"}, {"Title": "Very Nice TV", "Author": "Mom", "ReviewID": "R2X9Z0UE88JM05", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "This is our first HDTV of consequence.  (We also have a 32\" Vizio used for the kids.)  I spent a lot of time researching HDTVs to learn about the technologies to know what is hype and what is significant.  I spent time comparing sets in stores to get an idea of the differences, though often they didn't display the same content or were too far apart to compare easily.  Doing so proved to me that the 120Hz Smooth Motion technology made for a nicer picture regardless of the input if for no other reason than it required better LCDs in the panel.I read any review I could find.  I couldn't find any thorough professional reviews, but I found many like this one.  The gist of my research suggested that the SV370XVT was likely to serve our purposes well, but I really can't offer an experienced opinion on how it compares to other, similar sets.  When it was on sale at Target for the Super Bowl, I bought it.  It is now mounted on the wall in the master bedroom replacing a CRT TV that quit.I am generally pleased with this set.  The viewing angle is wide, so it works well throughout the bedroom (mounted with a Sanus MF110-B1 Articulating Wall Mount for 26\" to 42\" Displays (Black)).  I have to set the backlight to about 25 for nighttime viewing because it otherwise floods the room with light.  I cannot speak to the picture quality of 1080p HD content as we have no Blu-Ray player, but it does very nicely with DVDs making them the sharpest I've ever seen.  OTA HD programming looks very nice, but as that is 1080i at best (or is it all 720p?), it's hardly a great test case for the TV, so I simply can't judge the HD performance of this set definitively.Playing full screen (4:3) DVDs can require using the composite or component video inputs, depending upon the DVD player.  For example, using a Sony DVP-NS700H/B 1080p Upscaling DVD Player, Black, the picture is correct using the HDMI connection, but using a Toshiba DKR40 DVD Recorder with 1080p Upconversion and Bonus HDMI Cable requires using the composite or component input for 4:3 DVDs, and the HDMI input for widescreen DVDs.The remote is a bit odd.  It is comfortable to hold and provides convenient access to a great many useful features, but there is one feature that can only be accessed via more than seven (!) clicks, a feature we use every night: the sleep function.  There is no sleep button on the remote.  You have to press Menu, Down, Down, OK, Down, Down, Down, then press Left or Right to rotate among the time options, then press Menu twice.  You can omit the last two button presses if you want the menu to time out (after a minute).  That's ridiculous.  Considering the number of feature buttons on the remote already (21), and the space available between the Media and Mute buttons, Vizio could easily have included a button with direct access to the sleep settings.We don't use the speakers as we have connected the stereo audio output to a normal stereo (no surround sound).  There is a setup option to make the output variable, so the remote volume control affects the signal level on the outputs.  That means we can use the TV remote rather than the stereo remote to control the volume.Another less desirable part of this TV is the illuminated logo just below the screen.  When the TV is \"off\" the logo is orange.  That means it is an orange night light.  When the TV is on, the logo is white.  That means when the screen goes dark because of a fade to black or a dark scene, the white logo is distractingly bright.I can also see some white light on the wall behind the TV.  I don't know if that's from the backlight or the logo, but it can be a bit annoying.  Do other TVs have the same problem?  I have no idea.We are pleased with this TV.  It is much nicer (and larger) than our old set.  The 4:3 display (via the component input) is a bit larger than a standard 32\" TV, so the 16:9 display (via HDMI) is quite a bit larger.  If it weren't for the missing sleep button on the remote, and the ridiculous sequence needed to get to the sleep function without one, the illuminated logo, plus the lack of experience with true HD pictures, I'd give this TV five stars.(Mr. Mom)", "Date": "March 12, 2010"}, {"Title": "worked great, still going", "Author": "Scott", "ReviewID": "RJ6C9H5U1TVXB", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "no complaints.

It costs a little more because of the 120hz and audio features but its definitely worth the premium price. I was looking for a TV that would double as a monitor for my computer so I required picture in picture so I could watch TV and be on the computer simultaneously and came across this set.  The set has good picture quality on SD content and excellent quality with HD content.  The 120hz effect is very noticeable when its on and while it takes some getting used to, as soon as you turn it off an realize just how much it helps get rid of blur, you will end up leaving it on (I have mine set to low and smooth).  The sound effect that keeps the dynamic range of tv shows and ads within a range actually works very well.  With my Sony Bravia I had before, the disparity between tv shows and ads was very wide and annoying, the ads would come BLARING in and I turn the set down, the tv show comes back on and i have to turn te set back up, with this Vizio I down have to be adjusting the volume like that.  The audio on the set is also VERY good, speech is crisp and clear and there is even enough bass on the set itself for general tv watching.I rate this TV highly as you can tell, my only problem is that the remote doesn't fully support my motorola cable box, and its not a learning remote so I cant program in the \"A,B,C\" buttons that I would need.  I dont mind the menu system of the tv either.  And on a final note, the time when changing channels is very short as well as the time to change between inputs.  Overall, I still give this tv 5/5 regardless of the remote and the slight crushing of dark details.", "Date": "March 7, 2010"}, {"Title": "A definite buy", "Author": "Bradley", "ReviewID": "R1F9F2SVICHGI4", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "We first purchased a 40\" Sony for our spare room and the picture quality was okay and the sound for that particular model not so great.  Since we had the 32\" Vizio SV320XVT in another room we decided to buy the 37\" version of this model.  It looks great on the wall and is very easy to program.  There are many options to adjust and the picture looks great.  It looked pretty good out of the box but with some adjustments it brought it all together.  The sound quality is decent with several adjustments that can be made.  We have no complaints and would not hesitate to buy this model again.", "Date": "January 22, 2010"}, {"Title": "Buyer Beware!", "Author": "B.

Randle", "ReviewID": "R2JBEGRCAAJJRQ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Vizio has turned out a fantastic television here with the SV370XVT. It has very customizable picture settings, good number of inputs and outputs and as usual adequate speakers.  The picture is great, nice black levels, great contrast and skin tones.  I highly recommend tuning the picture manually as with all new TV's, the manufacturers have preset them with all their latest and greatest picture enhancers. Some of these work great and do what they intend to do, however I do not like the smooth motion technologies that are installed to smooth out the fast moving scenes.  In my opinion it makes the movements look robotic and fake.The HD quality is on par with the other big name brands, and all blu-ray and HD broadcasts look and sound great.  I would recommend this TV to anyone as a great small apartment or medium sized living room.  It is a bit small for a large living rooms or family rooms.  It is wall mountable and has a glossy casing and stand.  This of course will require frequent dusting, but it does come with a true micro-fiber cleaning cloth for the screen (thanks Vizio).  I play many games on this and they translate perfectly with picture quality and screen refresh rates.As I stated earlier, the speakers do their job, but they sound quality is always better with a surround sound set up.  The speakers are plenty loud, but I do have to agree a bit on the flat side.I would buy this TV again, and the quality and build are great, my only dislike is the remote.  Now its not to say it doesn't have the right amount of usability or functionality.  What I don't like is that it has to be \"reset\".  This means that 3 times (in a year and a half) I have to reprogram the remote to the TV.  Its not a hard process, but it is frustrating that I even have to do it.  Again, fantastic TV, great picture, great features and for the price, a bargain in comparison to the other big brand TV makers.", "Date": "November 1, 2010"}, {"Title": "Lots of Options", "Author": "Bargain Ron \"Ronster\"", "ReviewID": "R2NL4LK3FJDFYG", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I was restricted to an LCD that was narrower than 38 inches.  I wanted to cut the top of the armoire off and put in a 55\",  wife wouldnt allow it.  This fit the armoire.  After setting up several LCD's in late 09 and early 10, I bought this at costco in February.  I picked up a surround sound with speakers at walmart for around 150 and an upconverting DVD player for 40.  I built a Win 7 pro x64 pc with an HDMI output and containing a dtv tuner and wireless N card.  Used an NZXT case with remote for pc.  Used the optical SPDIF output from the TV (1 cable for 5.1 surround) into the Amplifier.  The DVD, Cable box, and PC have their own HDMI inputs.  With all the devices, I use a universal remote and rarely use the one provided.  I also have the TV connected to an HD antenna so that when I do loose cable or if I want to watch a better 1080p/5.1 I use the externat TV input. Setting up in this manner eliminates all the cons listed in the other recommendations.  The image quality has remained perfect and has not deteriated a bit since I bought it.  Just recently bought a racing simulator for the PC and the picture and sound is pretty amazing coming from the Vizio. Only 1 suggestion-plug all your units into a battery backup.  Any TV or amp plugged into a backup has never needed any type of repair (since 95).  1 of the 32\"(97) or 36\"(99) CRTs, each weighing over 120lbs, given away has already blown since it was not plugged into a backup.", "Date": "October 27, 2010"}, {"Title": "Simply Fantastic", "Author": "J.F. \"Jock\"  Gearhart", "ReviewID": "RNUBAB21VTFXC", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Over the last 40 years, whenever I needed a TV, after doing great research at the time, I have always bought the best TV available (usually Sony XBR's, or Sharp Acquos when they were the best.)

We needed a new TV for the master bedroom.  Got a 32\" Sony Bravia ex500 at Best Buy, $628 - it is the first Sony TV I have not been happy with, the picture was not as good as it should have been. I took it back, and then got lucky. For the same price, $628 at BJ's, I got the Vizio sv370 xvt.Wow, A Fantastic TV!! The best picture of any TV we have had, even far better than my old Sony KD XBR 960 Trinitron Wega Cathode Ray Tube (it had the best picture available at the time I bought it.)  The Vizio's sound is excellent, I do not use a sound system.  Also, I like the remote, it is easy to use, and not cheaply made as some have said. The manual is also excellent, very explanitory for hookup and features, maybe written by someone whose first language is English, so it is very understandable.  After 4 days of use, I very highly recommend this TV.
