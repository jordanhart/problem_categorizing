We purposely bought this tv over the Vizio and the Sharp brand 40 inch tv's that were cheaper (in store) and got home, realized the picture looked a little slow... BECAUSE ITS NOT TRULY A 120HZ TV. Advertises and says 120hz on the box and on the tv, but when you look into specs, its actually a 110V 60hz input. Stupid advertising techniques. Hopefully someone has the effort and knowledge to get these guys for false advertising or something to stop these games.", "Date": "November 29, 2013"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "$473.44", "Features": "120 Hz PMR for the ultimate in motion sharpness\nFull HD LCD display, with a 1920x1080p resolution\n3 HDMI inputs with Easylink for HD connection\nBrilliant LED images with low power consumption\nEnjoy rich sound and clear dialog with DTS TruSurround", "Name": "Philips 40PFL5708/F7 40-Inch 1080p 60Hz LED TV (Black)", "ImgURL": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51P1pRifjeL._SX300_.jpg", "ProductID": "B00FA0Y5CE"}}
