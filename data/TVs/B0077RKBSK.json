The greatest cons for this product is no optical or phone jack (in case you need to connect it to external speakers) fortunately there is RCA audio and video out2) Has only 2 HDMI (both works perfectly and is sufficient for my use as of today but in future may not be the case...)Overall a great price for a great product", "Date": "August 21, 2012"}, {"Title": "Nice for GAMING!", "Author": "j.b.", "ReviewID": "R1HUBA2RU150MA", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I bought this TV with gaming in mind.  You see, I got the LG 3D 47LW6500 from Amazon in Nov 2011.  Don't get me wrong, it's a great TV for watching TV and movies (3D Blu Ray!), but it suffers from horrendous input lag. Note that response time is not the same as input lag.  Response time refers to the amount of time it takes for a pixel (usually LCD) to change colors (usually from black to white). Input lag is the amount of time from when an input command (pressing a button on your controller) is entered to when it actually takes place or is displayed on the screen, and is a result of a collection of different factors in regards to the image being processed for \"clarity\". You can still have high response time while suffering from input lag. Sure the pixel can change colors quickly, but what's actually taking place on screen is delayed in time. Much like how live TV is on a delay to give time to edit out bad words in case someone curses.  While gaming, this is a huge deal.  Especially when playing a First Person Shooter, such as Call Of Duty.  Imagine your movements or gunshots being delayed.  Even if it's a small delay, it can make the game very unplayable.  I anticipate buying a WiiU when it comes out, so I decided I would buy a TV that would be good for gaming, and not suffer from input lag.  Almost all of these LCD/LED TVs will \"process\" the image to enhance it and make it look more clear and crisp.  When watching TV, this is desired, and is no problem if what you see is delayed just a slight bit, because you're not interacting with the content, like you are in a video game.  Another example of this, if you have a computer that can output to a TV (via HDMI) you can see if there is a delay from you moving the mouse, to when that movement of the pointer takes place on screen.  Most of these TVs have a \"Game Mode\" that is supposed to turn off all of this post image processing.  Sure the image quality and sharpness may suffer a little, but the image being displayed is instantaneous from the moment you press that button on your Xbox controller.  Unfortunately, even WITH its game mode on, my LG 3D TV still suffers from input lag.  I took a chance on this TV, the UN39EH5003, because I am familiar with Samsung's game mode being pretty instantaneous.  And what do you know?  I got it home, hooked up my Xbox, and was able to play a game of COD with all of my movements/shots taking place instantaneously!  I must also note that, though I am pretty sure this TV is only 60hz, the motion while watching cable TV is so smooth.  A good test of this, is a scrolling marquee text that you would see at, for example, the bottom of Fox News channel's feed.  Not at all jagged, and looks fluid.  I was pleasantly surprised to discover this.  Getting the flesh tone of people on screen to look right does require a tad bit of adjustment.  But this TV, for such a low price, is a home run.  39\" Is more than enough in my bedroom.  And I have ample room to play WiiU, once it comes out.If you're looking for a TV with gaming in mind, make sure you read up on input lag.  If you have a LED/LCD TV currently, or know someone who does, try and duplicate input lag with a game console, by turning up features like \"motion flow\", or \"LED Dimming\" etc.  And turn OFF \"Gaming Mode\".  Experience it for yourself and prepare to be frustrated.  This TV, when set to \"Gaming Mode\", does NOT suffer from this problem, and makes a solid rig in which to game on!Also, I hooked up my Samsung Series 7 Gaming Laptop NP700G7C to this TV, and set it to \"PC\" mode.  With the 17\" monitor setting side by side next to this TV, there was absolutely no lag from the movement of my mouse pointer on screen.  This is what I was looking for.", "Date": "September 18, 2012"}, {"Title": "Great deal, awesome picture!", "Author": "Gilda \"gilgomez\"", "ReviewID": "R1OP4NFKKOHD3K", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Got this beauty at my local Costco this week and it was a breeze to set up.

Accepted that the price/feature trade off included that it had just 2 hdmi inputs.  The statements on the box are part of the deception: the box is very clever in what it DOESN'T say. The online spec sheet (at samsung.com) fails to provide actual specs on viewing angle, backlighting or speed.The box says its an led tv.  It doesn't say it is led backlit, and it doesn't say that its led edgelit.  Maybe the box is referring to an led power-on light.  The available claims for this product intentionally lead the consumer to make assumptions, and you can or will be wrong when you do so.Samsung never tells you that it operates at 60Mhz, which several reviewers have noted. Rather, Samsung has invented its own, undefined, way of expressing speed, \"Clear view,\" and calls this the UN39HEH5003 tv \"Clear view 120.\"  This results in a consumer assumption that it runs at 120 Mhz.The box for this TV does not provide a picture of the backpanel, so I didn't find out it doesn't have a CAT5 internet cable input until I had it at home.Samsung witholds any specs on viewing angles.Consumers should be provided accurate specifications in order that they can make a fair comparison in a free marketplace.The online spec sheet (at samsung.com) also fails to provide actual specs.", "Date": "September 29, 2012"}, {"Title": "It is really lite", "Author": "M.

Peterson", "ReviewID": "R2OJLCOEBN1W2N", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "No digital audio output is a glaring limitation for me. I almost foolishly assumed it would have one, as most do given there is no other way to extract high-quality sound from OTA HDTV signals. That's a deal-breaker for me, given my audiophile tendencies, so I decided to pay the extra $30/50/100 for one of Samsung's superior 40-inch 5000/5300(Smart)/6030(3D) models --I went with the latter, in part for its superior 5M:1 contrast ratio. Speaking of which, the fact that Samsung fails to state the contrast ratio for this 38.6-inch HDTV (presumably <=3.5M:1, given only \"120 Clear Motion Rating\" at 60Hz), whereas they do for others (3.5M:1 for 5000/5300, 5M:1 for 6030, 7M:1 for 6500/6580), is also a red flag on the video side, not to mention the fact that they fail to report viewing angles for most if not all of their TV's (presumably in part so they can randomly substitute inferior LCD panels made by other manufacturers, while the reported specs hold for all such panels, as I've read elsewhere). I see at least one reviewer claims this TV does have RCA analog audio output, something Samsung fails to list in their \"detailed\" specs, but he hasn't yet responded to others asking where exactly it is.  If there were one, or even a headphone jack, at least that would allow users to hook up some decent speakers if they cared to...  If you want an inexpensive 38-40\" HDTV, there are even cheaper options than this 38.6\" one from other manufacturers (no one yet makes 39.0\", btw, and I believe only 2 companies manufacture the 38.6\" panel used here and by others including Coby, Element, Emerson, Haier, RCA, Sceptre, Sharp, TCL, and Vizio); but if you want a higher-quality Samsung you need only fork over the extra $30+ for a 40-inch 5000 model or better, with more connections and features, larger screen, better contrast ratio (and, I believe, viewing angle), etc.  On Thanksgiving, I decided to go with the 6030 model with 3D for just under 500 bucks, but the even cheaper 5300 model Smart TV also looked very tempting and well worth the $50 premium over this \"39-inch class\" (38.6\") Samsung.

Carroll", "ReviewID": "R3HC0EHKXB2F8Y", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "After spending countless hours of research on televisions, I really liked the Samsung 32 inch LED TV.  However, once the price on the 39 inch fell below $400, I decided to take a chance on the 39 inch as it was only $150 more than the 32 inch for an upgrade in size and resolution.  Overall, I am very impressed with Samsung televisions.  They make a great TV and you can spend around $200 for a knock-off television of the same size that will end up breaking down in less than 3 years or you can invest in a Samsung and have your television for 10 years without any problems.The features on the television are incredibly user friendly and set-up was a breeze.The Samsung advertises a 120 clear motion rate, but in reality, it is 60Mhz.  I have found that this speed has not affected the picture in the least bit.I do not have cable and the automatic tuner picked up all the surrounding stations with a cheap antenna.  I live about 10 miles from downtown in a mid-sized city.  I have also hooked up my computer to the TV via an HDMI cable and could not be happier with the picture and resolution.

Consumer Report rated the Samsung 32 inch line of TVs very well (UN32 EH4000 and UN32EH5000) so I took a shot with this 39 inch model.  For a 39 inch TV, it had the thinnest bezel which allowed this TV to fit where some 37 inch models would not.TV was unpacked and operational in less than 30 mins.  With built in tuner, was able to pick up HD channels right off the cable box (coax) and picture was incredible.  Saw some reviews where people complained about the sound but with a few adjustments off the menu option, I found the sound to be more than adequate.  Could not go above about 25 before it became too loud and was only half-way - so plenty of headroom on the sound level left.Since I only have TV hooked up via coax, I can't speak for the HDMI connections but having 3 other flat screens (2 plasma and one LCD) that all run off HDMI, I would expect the picture to be even better if it was connected via HDMI.For $400, you cannot beat this TV if you are looking for something for a bedroom or would probably make a great monitor.

My mother has more than enough power to hear the thing in the next room or a couple over.  A+ purchase.", "Date": "February 2, 2013"}, {"Title": "Samsung 39\" LED", "Author": "Steven J.

This TV is installed in the master bedroom.  Also attached a ROKU box to the HDMI multi input switch.  DirecTV box & ROKU box work fine with the HDMI multi input switch.
