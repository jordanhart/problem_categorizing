Reid \"KGR\"", "ReviewID": "R3PF6CVV9SFNYQ", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I just received this unit and bought it based on my satisfaction with the Toshiba 37\" Regza I bought a year ago. It replaces an old 13\" in my bedroom so a 22\" seems hugh.  The various menues are the same as the Regza so it was very easy to figure out based on my previous experience.  Contrary to the Amazon description, it has two HDMI inputs, not one. While the picture is really great in my view, I was very disappointed in the sound.  Mamimum volume is just barely acceptable (I am a little hard of hearing) for listening and it sounds hollow and tinny.  I got around this by hooking up a cheap book shelf stereo to my cable box to augment the sound and putting the speakers on both sides of the TV.  There are no analog audio outputs on the TV so you need cable for this solution to work.  Obviously, this solution would not be acceptable to everyone.", "Date": "December 4, 2008"}, {"Title": "I got what I expected, and I like it.", "Author": "T. S.

We decided to go with the Toshiba because of the better price and the smaller overall profile.  The salesman at the store told us the biggest criticism with the TV was the sound, and he was right, it's not very good.  I also thought the remote control was a little \"busy\" and the on-screen menu is not as intuitive as it could be.However, the picture is excellent.  I watched TV from about 10' away and the picture was beautiful.  I also like that it has such a small profile, it almost looks like a piece of art sitting on a table.  Setup was very easy, I had it out of the box and working inside of two minutes.If your looking for a small, secondary TV for your bedroom or home office, this TV would work.  If you're building a home entertainment center, this is not the TV for you.", "Date": "January 26, 2009"}, {"Title": "don't fear the sound", "Author": "Pamela Herkes", "ReviewID": "R3H14K2Y1LJR6R", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I was a bit apprehensive on what the sound quality would be like on this TV having read all the reviews.  I can tell you that I have this in an 11 X 14 room with cathedral ceilings and I have absolutely NO issues with the sound quality!  The picture quality is fabulous and the set up was so simple.  I like this so much that I'm thinking of upgrading my living room TV to a larger version of this.  Don't let the reviews on the sound quality hold you back from purchasing.

Good picture quality. I haven't had the problems with sound that others have mentioned--some channels need higher volume than others, but that seems to originate from the provider end.The one problem I have had is that the closed captioning does not come through for one (local digital) channel via my Dish DVR. Have not been able to figure out why. All other channels come through just fine, and this channel did not have any problems with my old, nondigital TV. For some reason the Toshiba is not picking up that line of code.Otherwise I'm pretty satisfied. Would buy a larger model if buying again--22 inches is great for a bedroom or kitchen TV but too small for the living room.", "Date": "April 7, 2009"}, {"Title": "Great deal for your money", "Author": "C.

After researching TVs ad nauseum I decided to stay with the Toshiba brand. Here's the deal, this is no Regaza and you know all those other reviews you're reading about the sound on this TV? They're pretty accurate. The sound on this set is not great at all. However, I still recommend it as long as you don't plan to host movie night using it, you should be fine. It's a great TV for a small room and the picture is fantastic! The options on the TV are great and I would buy it again and recommend it to my friends.The review should actually be 3 1/2 stars.", "Date": "March 30, 2009"}, {"Title": "A great HDTV for your kitchen!", "Author": "Matt07924", "ReviewID": "RWMSOMJZFAEHV", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I wanted a HDTV that had a good viewing range (from angles) as well as one that is reliable, etc.  This unit meets all my goals and the price was not too bad either.

It replaces a 2000 Daewoo that served me well for 9 years.  I was forced to upgrade my television because my cable provider started pulling good channels off of regular cable and putting them on digital.  I tried to install the new cable box to the Daewoo but that tv had no inputs other than the cable input (I was already using an RF converter box and thus was approaching cable overload).  So I reluctantly ended up buying the Toshiba 22AV500U here.  After all of the work and money, I must say that I am pleased with the results.  Digital cable is fun and has a lot of features and all of my shows have never looked clearer or sharper.  I am also enjoying watching my dvds on the Toshiba tv.  You have not seen Polar Express until you've seen it in high definition!The Toshiba is high quality.  I have no dead pixels and no backlight bleed.  I did have an issue with the stand not moving when I first pulled it out of the box but that was because I wasn't pulling hard enough (you never know how delicate these modern electronics are).  I also ended up calling Toshiba customer support a few times.  Each time I talked to someone knowledgeable and helpful.As for the size, I have found 22 inches to be more than adequate.  I have a smallish entertainment center and didn't want to upgrade that too.  The tv is in a rather large living room and there isn't a bad seat in the room.I also should mention that at work my Dell lcd monitor made me so sick that I had to go back to the old crt monitor.  The issue I think is that lcds are lit by a florescent bulb.  Because florescent bulbs flash like a strobe light they can sometimes make you feel ill when you stare into them.  I have had no issues with that with my Toshiba.I also highly recommend that you use an hdmi cable between your dvd player and the Toshiba (and everywhere else you can too).  I bought mine here on Amazon for a few dollars (the 6 ft 1080p cable by DVI Gear).  It is an excellent cable.  What the local stores charge for the same thing is quite scandalous.July 2011 Update: Last week we upgraded to a 40 inch Sony Bravia. The little Toshiba ended up being too small for parties and movie nights with friends and family. We will most likely use the Toshiba as a computer monitor. Nonetheless, the Toshiba was a great tv and served us as best as it could for almost 2 years. My only complaint is the input switching is very frustrating. It doesn't always work the first time, so you have to cycle through all of the options a second time. The Sony switches perfectly. The Sony is wall-mounted with an Ikea mount (which works flawlessly by the way) and we have a much bigger entertainment center, which also is from Ikea.", "Date": "May 6, 2009"}, {"Title": "Excellent for a small room", "Author": "veruca salt", "ReviewID": "RXK9UDXAQ3EOZ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This television has a gorgeous picture. I've read complaints about the sound but attached to my Comcast HD DVR the sound is just fine. I didn't try to listen to it with just an antenna. I like that it has two HDMI ports. Many televisions in this price range have only one. They come in handy when you want to set up a blu ray disc player or a gaming console. One tip from my set up experience: If you use a HDMI cable from television to cable box, make sure you go into the imput settings on the television's remote and make sure you select HDMI output so that you get the full benefit of the connection.If one doesn't work you're plugged into the second.

Basic Setup instructions were simple: attach the antenna and scan for channels.  The set receives all major channels in my area using the indoor amplified antenna from the older tv set.  There are no dead pixels in the display, and the picture looks good even when viewed quite a distance to the side of the screen (Some LCD pictures degrade when viewed from the side.).  This is a 22-inch set, and fits nicely into my older entertainment center.  I have viewed both widescreen and conventional movies on the set and I am satisfied, with a viewing distance of about 8 feet. Light or dark conditions in the room are not a major factor.  I especially bought the set because it has two HDMI interfaces, in addition to the interfaces.

If you are a collector of classic, black and white movies, and if you have some copies in your collection that are sort-of or very poor in quality, they will absolutely improve when shown on this HDTV.  I'm referring to the Toshiba 22AV500U, 22 inch, 720p LCD HDTV.  I just received this HDTV, plugged it in, and got out three of my poorest copies of classic, black and white movies.  The first one was very poor quality, but one of my favorites.  It improved 100%!! I swear I'm not exaggerating!!  The next two improved 75-100% also!  It's because of Toshiba's Dynamic Backlight Control For Increased Detail and Depth.  It smoothes out too-dark and overly-light film copies.  Classic movie lovers, mark my words.  As we move into HDTV technology, this HDTV will absolutely improve your movies.  How do they do this?  I don't care, actually.  I'm just thrilled, totally thrilled.

The weakest aspect of this TV is the audio. I read the other reviews and that seemed to be the common theme. They were right. So, in the end, this TV became my computer monitor.
