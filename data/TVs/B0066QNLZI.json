Picture is awesome. I purchased it for my bedroom. It basically has none of the extra bells and whistles, just 2 HDMI plugs on the back. The sound is also very basic (it sounds kind of like the sound coming out of a good clock radio) but if you want to upgrade the sound, that's what all of the jacks in the back are for.  Like I said, it is just for my bedroom and for that, the sound is fine. If you are just looking for a basic tv for your bedroom with an excellent vibrant picture at a very good price, this is the one for you.

The display control board failed after two weeks. It is well known to customer support agents and 3rd party repair that these Toshiba HDTVs have a defective display board with an extremely high failure rate. Customer support is in the Philipines and transfers case to third party repair and will not help in any other way. Repair can't be made without part whose arrival moves out 2-4 weeks with every call.

It has been over 2 weeks since I contacted Toshiba and the part is still on back order with no eta of when it will be available.  What's more, Toshiba's customer service is horrible - they told me that they won't even address \"other options\" until the part has been backordered for 20 BUSINESS days (meaning closer to a month).  When I asked to be escalated, the support rep named Chris told me that he \"had addressed\" my question and hung up on me.I know this is a lower end TV, but I'm just starting out and this was a big purchase for me.  I can assure you I'll steer clear of all Toshiba products going forward.", "Date": "April 17, 2012"}, {"Title": "THIS PRODUCT JUNK AND THE WORST CUSTOMER SERVICE EXPERIENCE EVER!", "Author": "Sckrippie3", "ReviewID": "RNH196M41OQTR", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "JUNK, JUNK, JUNK!

Toshiba is a respected brand name and I've owned various Toshiba products in the past. They were on sale at the time and my Best buy store was sold out. Mine was fresh from the box and put out on the display floor the same day I bought it.I have had no problems with it although I did purchase the extended warranty just in case.

It worked fine - nothing exceptional, not a great picture, not great sound.  Then, suddenly, about one month ago, it wouldn't turn on!  After reading all sorts of forums and trying a variety of things, it still wouldn't turn on.  One day, after not even trying to turn it on for a week, I decided to hold down the \"on\" button for an extended time and it worked!  Magic!  Two weeks later - it won't turn on and this time it doesn't matter what we do.  I have found a number of forums in which people who purchased this same model at the exact same time we did are having the exact same problem - with no support from Toshiba.We will definitely NEVER buy a Toshiba television again, and will think (at least) twice about purchasing any other products made by Toshiba.", "Date": "April 14, 2013"}, {"Title": "LEMON", "Author": "Julie A.

There are known issues with the electronics of it and Toshiba tech support is a voice mail maze designed to make the customer give up rather than to help fix the problem.

The power board failed after two months. It is well known to customer support agents but they dont tell you that on the phone.  They give you a ref# and tell you it will be about a week.  After a week I called to follow up on part and they referred me to the 3rd party repair company nexcor whom advised me that these Toshiba HDTVs have a defective power board with an extremely high failure rate.  They said that after getting many power boards in they realized that this is not the problem because the power boards are not working and that its actually the main board.  Which now due to the long back order for this Toshiba HDTV component speaks for itself--high demand or they don't know to make a good one.  They give you another reference number and tell you that this is all they can do for you.  THEY DO NOT CARE!  Please do not buy anything from Toshiba,  I promise you they have the worst customer service I have ever experienced. I spoke to Julie in customer relations, she will not transfer you to a manager, she will not give you an employee id or last name or any other way to file a complaints.....
