Long", "ReviewID": "R1RBZTOV693NK0", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "We compared this TV to various 720p and 1080p rear projections by Samsung and Sony.  The image quailty was by far better than the other 720p TVs that we saw and the features made it hard to justify the additional expense of the 1080p.  Besides, the speakers do not stick out from the sides, offering a clean profile with excellent sound quality.The addition of a second HDMI port sealed the deal since I had only seen that feature on the 1080p models.  I was able to connect the Cable box and upconvert DVD player (Toshiba) to the HDMI ports and direct the audio via the optical audio out to my stereo surround system.", "Date": "May 2, 2006"}, {"Title": "Nice tv, BAD service/warranty", "Author": "Frustated", "ReviewID": "R1E50VEN76U83F", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I purchased this Toshiba DLP television recently. Before 1 1/2 months old, it just stopped working. Called Toshiba, and they directed me to 3 service centers. First one never answered the phone. Second one said they would call back within an hour... I called back a couple hours later and they said they were swamped and would call me back. Never heard from them again. Third one said Toshiba did not authorize them for home service. So now I'm stuck with a $1500 paperweight, until they will authorize the retailer I bought it from to service it.So after talking with the tech at the retailer, he was sure it was the lamp. It took me 2 hours to get toshiba to send me a lamp replacement(they kept on flat out refusing until they called the tech themselves), which ended up not even fixing it.Now, it could be weeks before I get a working television(guaranteed another week at the very earliest), it's already been a week. I am just in shock that I spend that kind of money on something, it breaks this soon, and they could care less if or how long I am without a television. They will not budge on trying to compromise to make me even somewhat satisfied. It's just 'sorry, company policy' over and over and over.I have always owned toshiba tv's, but never had a problem with one. Their level of customer service just plain stinks. I truely can't believe it, I've dealt with microsoft for xbox 360 problems, and I thought that was bad. I've dealt with Nintendo, there's a company that knows customer service. This is just plain frustration and nothing else. With a tv that new, they should be letting me take it back to the retailer for a new set. If it wasn't for a 30% restocking fee the tv would be returned now.Bottom line, if you have any problems with a toshiba product be prepared to be without it for a long time and get no satisfaction at all. And now I will worry that my tv is a 'lemon' and even after I get through this mess it will just happen again in a couple months to go through again??", "Date": "January 9, 2007"}, {"Title": "Great Picture...for 2 months :(", "Author": "M. Simons", "ReviewID": "R2UKX9GVANVJUS", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I bought one of these exactly 2 months ago and it got a splendid picture and functioned perfectly...till about an hour ago. I was watching it and heard a loud pop and that was it. I looked in the trouble shooting section of my manual and confirmed the lamp was indeed burned out.So I went online so see about getting a bulb from one of the 2 sites listed in the manual only to find the first site had been sold to a domain selling site, and the second site had no bulbs whatsoever. After searching the web I found out these lamps sell for $600, if you can accually find one. Sorry, but I'm not foolish enough to pay $600 every 2 months (Or less than 2 months according the the other review) to keep it running. Nor do I want to hear the \"Sorry, but I can't help you because of company policy\" line or wait weeks for the service department to do thier job.I am returning it tomorrow. Lucky for me I was doing a rent-to-own contract on this new TV so I only lost my first payment. So I would recommend people not buy this type of TV. Since all DLP TVs work with these lamps, I would think of them as a brilliant $600 light bulb that only lasts about as long as your average light bulb with a $1500 recepticle that will sit dark in the corner waiting for you to feed it another lamp.", "Date": "January 31, 2007"}, {"Title": "Worst Purchase Ever", "Author": "KCZOMBIE", "ReviewID": "R25ZFAM12DEYDZ", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I bought this TV in the Sping of 2006 and luckily bought a 5 year extended warranty.  Immediately, I got the black bar across the top of the screen and they replaced the light engine.  It is on the 4th bulb, as of yesterday.  Each bulb lasts about 2,000 hours and not the 8,000 hours that is promised.  My repairman said to be cautious of using generic $100 bulbs from Ebay, because they will ruin the ballast and cause a more expensive repair.  The next replacement will be out of my pocket, so I will probably shell out close to $200 for an authentic Toshiba bulb and replace myself (very easy to do).  Hopefully, I've sold this POS before then.  I'm thinking about putting a money jar by the TV asking guests for bulb contributions.

I bought this TV at Nebraska Furniture Mart thinking I was getting a really good deal about 18 months ago. The TV sits in our rec room that hardly ever gets used unless someone is on the treadmill. I figure 5 hours a week is generous. So after 18 months of use, the bulb blows. This TV should have lasted 15 years according to their figures.

The TV retails for around $1200 nearly every where you look, but we were able to find it for less than $930.

I called Toshiba and they are processing the replacement bulb to be sent to me now (under warranty).  Someone complained that bulbs cost $600... that's nonsense - before Toshiba came through I priced them as low as $229.00  No, I don't want to pay that every nine months; I think I could find the bulb for less down the road and I did save substantially in the initial purchase.", "Date": "December 28, 2007"}, {"Title": "5 years and no problems", "Author": "Joseph Brown", "ReviewID": "RN48UUQ3COND1", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I bought my tv back in 2008 and I was curious to see how much longer it should last.

Picture quality is good, as is sound.  Like other owners, we've replaced the bulb but will probably not do so again given the age of the TV, price of replacement bulbs, and the steadily decreasing price of new, better televisions.  When the current bulb goes, the set is going to the dump.We've had several issues with black areas appearing on the screen.  It turns out that there is tape in several locations inside the set that comes loose and droops, creating a shadow between the bulb and the mirror or viewing screen.  Fortunately, it's easy enough to remove several screws around the rear edge of the screen, pop the screen off, cut or remove the offending tape inside the set, and then put things back together.  Just be sure if you do this that you disconnect the power before taking things apart, and then don't touch or smudge the mirror or in the inside of the screen.  It's not a difficult fix.", "Date": "August 26, 2011"}, {"Title": "This is the worst TV ever.", "Author": "macyscoobie", "ReviewID": "R1DLZE8X7DFB9F", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I don't know what's worse, the Toshiba TV or fridge we bought from Best Buy. Neither one worked well from the beginning. The bulb blew in the TV after a month and the fridge could never keep up with ice. After 4 years the fridge quit all together and the bulb just blew again. When we had the repairman out he said we would be throwing good money away repairing these items. I will never as long as I live buy another Toshiba product again nor will I shop at Best Buy.

They say the lamp should last about 7k hours.  Since I didn't run my TV 13 hours per day, I think this is wrong.  It looks like this is a very typical issue with Toshiba DLP TV's.  I have even read that there are class action law suits regarding Toshiba and there DLP lamps.  Its a good TV at a good price until you figure in the price of a new Lamp ($200) every year and a half.

She's retired so it's running about 6 hours a day. Still using the original bulb. HD programing and BR discs look great. SD programing is ok. While researching this television, I read about users having problems with frequent bulb replacement. These bulbs are a \"metal halide\" type, which is why they cost $175 to replace. After reading some electronic forums about these bulbs, I found that one reason for the early bulb failure MAY be powering the tv on and off multiple times a day. For this reason I told my mother once she turned her tv on, not to turn it off until she went to bed.
