Sony still makes a 34 inch CRT HDTV in the XBR line.  The TVs are heavy.  The picture is amazing.  The gold standard for HDTV.

Just as good as anything i've seen coming from the latest and greatest.  The one good thing about this new crop of televisions is that at least the prices are coming down.  Summer of 2003 my 30\" XBR was retailing for a knee buckling $2000!  Anyway, I slightly wish that I had bought the 34\" but I am still exceedingly happy with the visuals that I get and the TV is just the right size so that it doesn't become the focal point of the room.  Very happy with this purchase.", "Date": "November 27, 2006"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "Unavailable", "Features": "Hi-Scan 1080i Display\nSuper Fine Pitch CRT supplies accurate moving and still image detail\nAmazing picture resolution with Digital Reality Creation(TM) circuitry\nClearEdge VM (Wideband Velocity Modulation(TM) Scanning)\nAdjust size and placement of side-by-side P&P; with MID(TM) X circuitry", "Name": "SONY KV-30XBR910 30-Inch XBR(R) FD Trinitron(R) WEGA Television (Old Version)", "ImgURL": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51E5069YTQL._SX300_.jpg", "ProductID": "B0000CETCW"}}
