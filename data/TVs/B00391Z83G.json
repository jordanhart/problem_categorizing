Drake", "ReviewID": "RMZF13C5T4885", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "After trying two other flat screen TVs and studying different models in showrooms and on the the web, my wife and I gave this model a try. My wife can be very sensitive to the intensity of an LCD TV picture and one thing she likes about this TV is that is has great adjustments for contrast, brightness, etc. In particular, the \"Cinema\" setting tones the brightness down and gives good picture clarity. She can also select a picture size or formatting that makes videos, widescreen or full screen DVDs, etc., all look good. Furthermore, there is no noticeable blurring. Overall the quality of the picture is superb, and it was worth paying a little more for the 1080p. Even TV programs not broadcast in high-def look great. In addition, unlike other TVs, the speakers provide sound of sufficient volume and excellent quality. I also like that it has plenty of inputs (including 3 HDMI, 1 component, and 2 composite inputs). Its ability to interface with SD cards and computers is also neat. And, in my limited experience, Panasonic has excellent customer service, with personnel who, in general, are more knowledgeable than most I have talked with at Samsung in regards to that company's products. My only complaint is that the only audio output on this TV is digital/optical (for new \"home entertainment\" systems), which, apparently, is the direction newer LCD TVs this size and up are going. Sometimes I need to use headphones when I am playing something to which my wife does not want to listen. In order to do this I connect my Blu-Ray/VHS/or satellite box output to the input of a little 2 watt amplifier I have and run the headphones off of that, using the amplifier's volume control, with the TV volume on \"mute\". I would like for this TV to have a 1/8\" audio output. In spite of that, in my opinion it is worth 5 stars.", "Date": "July 18, 2010"}, {"Title": "Nice TV", "Author": "M. J.

In the latest version of Catalyst Control Center (CCC) navigate to Desktops and Displays > My Digital Flat-Panels > Scaling Options.  Set Overscan to 0% and click [Apply.]  There may be a similar procedure for nVidia and Intel chipsets.Only tested on ATI, probably the same for everyone:-On your TV/remote, [MENU] > Picture > Aspect Adjustments.  Select Screen Format: FULL & HD Size: Size 2. You should now have edge-to-edge 1:1 output.Everyone:-Set Sharpness slider to 0.-Disable A.I. Picture and C.A.T.S.-I know this is counter-intuitive, but you want to ENABLE \"Video NR\" (noise reduction.) This will remove edge distortion and dramatically improve the readability of text.-Adjust ClearType. Press [Windows key] to open the start menu and begin typing \"cleartype\" > Adjust ClearType Text.--For those of you hooking this up using an analog connection, first of all, completely disregard my setup tips above -- most of them won't apply to you.  If you hook your TV up through your video card's VGA output, a menu option will be accessible called \"PC Adjustments.\"  I'm not sure if this is anything more than image alignment. I haven't explored this menu, because I'm only interested in digital output.--This is the first time I've used a dedicated HDTV as my PC display.  I was strongly considering returning it until I figured out the Video NR setting made text more readable.  Now, I have to say, I'm enjoying it pretty much, and it's a serious upgrade from my old Hanns-G 27.5\" TN panel monitor.  Still, it doesn't seem like all of the image enhancement features of the TV can be disabled, making pixel-perfect output on this display impossible.  For people like graphic artists, this might be a deal-breaker.  I'm basing my four-star rating on this lack of unadulterated output. TV, video, and gaming are all fantastic of course.Other minor gripes-Like most TVs but unlike most computer monitors, there is no tilt adjustment.  The viewing angles on this TV are very good, but unless you're at least five feet away from the screen, you're going to want to adjust the tilt.  You can prop it up on something or consider your mounting options.-The buttons on the remote could be a little more rubbery (hey, I told you these were minor gripes!)-The response time is not as fast as the lower-quality TN panels generally used in computer monitors. It's still extremely good, and only noticeable in the kinds of extreme color transitions generally used as reference tests.  On a positive note, I have not noticed any input lag.**Please comment on this review if you have any additional tips or questions on using this HDTV as a computer display.  If you want to post your backlight/contrast/brightness/color/tint/color temp/black level settings, make a note of who's video card drivers you are using.  Last time I checked, nVidia's drivers, by default, used \"digital vibrance control,\" which would undoubtedly throw off anyone trying to replicate your settings.", "Date": "January 29, 2011"}, {"Title": "Excellent Bedroom Sized TV", "Author": "brudemi", "ReviewID": "RIE7RJF0SZEY2", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "We love the Panasonic brand for TVs.  This TV has great picture and is the perfect size for our bedroom. The picture is very clear.  The one thing I woudl like better about the TV is the sound.  We have not set up a sound system in our bedroom and the sound from the TV is not great... its good.. just nothing to rave about.  I have a panasonic 42\" plasma TV from a few years ago, and I felt that the sound coming from that TV was better.For the cost of the TV, which for us was about $378, I think this was an amazing value.  At the time of purchase Amazon had a price match and I found on another website for less and Amazon was very quickly able to refund the difference.  We received the TV amazingly fast - literally I order on a Tuesday morning at 8am and receievd by 4pm on Thursday - and this was with the free shipping.Obviously there are better TVs out there - either from Panasonic or other manufacturers, but they also generally cost more money. Also, the prices of TVs change so rapidly it is difficult to rely on my review.  I purchased my TV in mid Nov. 2010, and it has worked great since then (about a month).  When you consider the cost, this TV is very very good and I would recommend. Also, not only did we receive the item quickly but as you can tell from the review, the item was received fully intact and operational.  Until a few years ago, I always worried about buying muti-hundred dolar electronic equipment over the internet becuase I was always concerned it woudl be received broken and then I woudl have to pay to ship some large item back.

Good TV for the price.", "Author": "C. Gilbert", "ReviewID": "RW6PSOHD7SRCI", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "This is a good TV for the price but it has two shortcomings: the viewing angle is wide but not tall, and it only has digital audio output.First, the positive qualities:  Good price, good picture quality, 1080p, many inputs, good backlight distribution, clean design, straightforward configuration menus.  As a bonus, its right side has all the essential buttons you need - power, input, volume, channel, etc.  That's one less remote you need.The viewing angle is the TV's weakness.  Panasonic claims 178 degrees horizontal viewing angle, but they don't tell you that the vertical viewing angle is far less.  The TV must be at eye level or it will appear washed out.  As you move further left or right from center, the viewing angle gets shorter!  Standing dead center, the vertical viewing angle is probably 90 degrees.  But, standing ~60 degrees off center, the vertical viewing angle is shorter than the screen.  This means that even at eye level, the top and bottom of the screen appear washed out while the center has the right contrast.Another problem with the TV, though minor, is that the only audio output is digital.  This makes it more difficult to use a few-year-old amplifier for the audio.  You can't run a single analog RCA cable from the TV to the amp, letting the TV input selection decide which video source's audio is played.  Instead, you must connect the audio from each video source to the amp and manually switch the amp between sources.Overall, it's a good TV for the price.  The rest of my household doesn't care about the above two issues, but you should know they are drawbacks of buying a lower priced TV.", "Date": "January 3, 2011"}, {"Title": "Thrilling thity-two", "Author": "Louis N.

I have not used the speakers since I use my home audio system for the sound. But the picture is very crisp, the colors are good, and it is a dramatic improvement over my previous Sony tube TV. I, just by coincidence, also have a panasonic blue ray player and they work in conjunction with each other so that if I turn the player on the tv turns on as well, and the same remote works on both, so that is kind of a nice bonus. The only complaint I might have about it is that the image does pale some when viewed from above the straight on viewing angle, far more than if viewed from the side or from the bottom. So that is something to keep in mind with regards to placement. I have mine set so the top of it is about 4 ft off the floor. So when sitting on the couch, to the side, or the chair, in the front, or on the floor, the color is nicely saturated. But if you are walking through the room, you get the paling effect. It is not a big deal for me, since I don't watch it standing up, but I did find it interesting that the loss of quality is much more significant given the angle, from that perspective, than from the others.

I have been thrilled with the great picture especially when watching DVDs. When the TV in our bedroom died, I once again went to the library to do my homework. I specifically wanted an LCD as I couldn't get a plasma smaller than 42\" and wanted something in the 32\" range for the location I had in mind. I also wanted a 1080p set with the thought that as time goes on, more and more programming will take advantage of the higher resolution.I went with Panasonic again because of brand reputation and value.This TV lacks the \"THX\" setting of the plasma that I own; a setting that renders colors perfectly, but I managed to customize the settings to reproduce it as close as I could. Also, I had gotten so used to being able to view the plasma from any angle in the room that it was strange at first to not have that advantage (though I went into this realizing that this is one of the drawbacks of LCD). Since this TV will mostly be viewed while in bed, this was not a too  much of a problem.When looked on directly, the picture is wonderful and I sound is great!

I learned a lot about this TV by reading other reviews on Amazon, which is one of the reasons I like Amazon so much (that and the great prices).My brief comments:*  TV arrived on time (2 business days after ordering with Prime);*  The used condition was actually better than described on Amazon's website.  Although the website said it had minor cosmetic damage on a few parts, it must be extremely minor since I couldn't find anything significant;*  The item arrived in its original box, which had been opened (as expected) and showed wear-and-tear.  The original packing materials were inside, but the items were loose.  It's probably lucky that nothing was damaged;*  This is the third HDTV I've purchased from Amazon, and so far I'm batting 3 for 3.  I was initially reluctant to buy a TV and have it shipped (after hearing some horror stories about cases of shipping damage), but it's worked out very well for me;*  The TV works well and looks great, consistent with many of the reviews.  So far, I find it fairly comparable to my 47\" LED TV (minus some of the bells and whistles), but since it cost me about 1/3 the price, it's a deal;*  I have also purchased a used blu ray 5.1 home theatre system from Amazon Warehouse to go with this TV, but it hasn't arrived yet.  However, after playing with the sound settings, I'm impressed with the sound through the TV's speakers, particularly the surround sound function which sounds good and is surprisingly three-dimensional;*  Many reviewers have mentioned that the TV doesn't have a headphone jack, and only has an optical audio out.  This is a limitation if you want to use headphones or a simple speaker system, but won't be for my home theatre system (an optical cable is also coming from Amazon);*  The SD card reader is a bonus and works fairly well.  The images look good, but it does take a while to scroll through images taken with my 12 megapixel camera.Overall, I'm very pleased with the performance of the TV, the price and the better-than-expected used condition.

But the LG was far pricier than this TV, and I trust the Panasonic name/experience.  Since this TV only has an optical, digital output for sound, I simply ordered a Toslink digital, optical cable from Amazon for a couple bucks and hooked into my Sony home theatre, which has a headphone jack.  The sound is adequate with the tv's speakers, not great.  (The Sony surround system is turned on and off automatically with the tv when \"home theatre\" is chosen for speaker output in the Viera menu, no additional \"programing\" required).  The picture quality is the same as plasma.  With this tv's IPS system you can look at the screen from any angle and see clearly.  It is hanging on the wall tilted 10 degrees and the picture is simply stunning.The menus are simple to use.  The colors are vibrant, fantastic preset picture selections for gaming, cinema watching like Netflix (using PS3/Wii), or using custom settings for night time viewing.  It is energy star compliant too.  Plenty of inputs 3 HDMI's, computer, SD card, etc.  It was hung using a VideoSec tilting 32\" to 60\" wall mount (they have a 23\" to 37\" that might work as well for a little cheaper) - got through Amazon.

Most of the features are easy to access, some are far from intuitive, but with some acclaimation its not bad.Sound quality using the built in speakers is only passable. If you turn up the volume enough to hear subtle diologue, the action sequences are much to loud. Connecting it to a home theater system will make it wonderfull, but its an additional cost. I discount the need for a \"bracket\" as an equal cost, because any TV requires a stand or some sort of furniture, but sound wasn't something I imagined paying extra for. It worked out though.All in all it seems a good product, I somehow imagined the 1080 would be superior to my old TV, it really isnt, its an even trade.

The built-in speakers are good but not great. A couple of minor annoyances--there is a bit of a delay when you turn the unit on, and also when changing channels--but I believe this is fairly typical among similar LCD TVs. You may wish to play around with the picture settings--the default was very dim for me.

I was a bit worried because I've heard LED has a better picture quality. Well that may or may not be true, in my own opinion, compared side by side at Cosco, I like this LCD 1080 better. I hope this unit lasts a while. I wont want to have to come back a few months from now with an updated review saying how horrible this TV is.  :)Sounds quality wise, this is just fine for the bedroom. It's even good for a descent size living room. If you do put it in your living room I (along with everybody else) would recommend getting surround sound speakers.Overall a great TV and the best you can get (not including 3D of course)  Oh and the VIERA picture viewer thing is awsome! YOu can view your jpeg photos with crystal clear clarity.In closing, BUY THIS!!
