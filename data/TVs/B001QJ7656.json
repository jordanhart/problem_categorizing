The picture is great from all angles.  The volume is just fine - dishwasher running and everything.  The screen is plenty big, too, and we have a pretty big kitchen.  Now we can eat breakfast, do make-up, and pack our lunch while we watch a little news in the morning.  I'm very happy with this product!", "Date": "July 20, 2009"}, {"Title": "Certainly not the best TV, but still a good value", "Author": "Eric S. Olstad", "ReviewID": "R3LAM32MG53OY3", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I wouldn't rave about this TV at all.  There's nothing spectacular about it in any way.  It's completely average, but that's what I bought it for.  We picked up this TV to use with our treadmill so we were really just looking for something with a decent price.  This one was the lowest price and met the specifications we wanted.Having said that, I am completely satisfied.  It has a digital tuner so it picked up all the \"over-the-air\" channels just fine.  However, the process was ridiculously long.  It took probably around an hour to auto-program the TV channels.  I didn't clock it.  I just walked away and then the TV popped on so much later that I had completely forgot it was working.The picture is fine.  It's not the best, but it's good enough.  The sound is a bit lacking though.  At its loudest, you can't even hear it over the treadmill so we have to hook up headphones to it, which is fine.  Sound quality is average.Other than that, this TV DOES have an HDMI output.  I know one reviewer was complaining that it didn't, but maybe he got an older model.  The one I got definitely has an HDMI port though I believe the model number might be HDLCD1912a.  I suppose they don't make the plain 1912 anymore, I don't know.  For this TV, though, with it's average quality, an HDMI cable is really just a convenience of having one cable and not something you need to get maximum sound and video quality.So, if you're looking for something simple to throw in your kitchen or in your workout room or something like that, then this is the way to go.  But if you're looking for something for your Xbox or Playstation or as your main TV, then I would suggest spending a little bit more money and getting a better device.  This one is sure NOT to wow anyone, but it will get the job done.", "Date": "November 17, 2009"}, {"Title": "Decent TV but no HDMI!!", "Author": "FirePower \"FirePower\"", "ReviewID": "R25NPNKQQ9Y4T", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I am satisfied with this tv but I was very disappointed when I found out that I'd been duped. No HDMI inputs on this tv, anywhere! Not even a DVI input. Someone else suggested that I probably got an earlier model of this tv and that could be true. Anyway, here goes any hope I had of upcoverting my SD DVDs on my DVD player. Anyway, over the air HD stations come in crystal clear and so do my HD cable channels. All in all, a decent tv for such a low price.", "Date": "September 13, 2009"}, {"Title": "Great little LCD TV over all, but something not so great.....", "Author": "Natja K.", "ReviewID": "R1LKT20U2YR4QT", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "FIRST THE POSITIVES:I got this little TV at walmart for $98 last night, black friday. Now honestly for $98 bucks it really is a steal. It works flawlessly. The default color is nearly perfect without any user calibration. Perhaps a bit too saturated but that is easily udjusted. There are plenty of settings on this tv for picture and sound. There are numerous picture modes as well as several color temperature adjustments. Of course there are the usual contrast, tint, sharpness, brightness etc., But I was also suprised to find a level for the backlight, which can be helpful in improving black levels.As with all LCD flat panel tv's, it is a flawed technology. This due to the viewing axis issues that exist when the TV is watched from the far left, far right, and too high above or below, there is a limited playing field to see the best possible image. And it's about what you'd expect for low priced LCD TV's. Not bad but I have seen better. The backlight control when turned down can help eliminate some of that dull gray washout the you see in the darkest content, but it doesn't get rid of it all. Instead of total black you get a glowing gray when things get rather dark in source material. But this is a common problem with flat panel LCD. Again, it's not all that bad, and the sharpness and image quality is really excellent. So much so that even though it's 720p native dvd's look excellent but blu-rays look every bit as good on this TV as our much more expensive 47' LCD tv.A nice addition is that there is an adjustable 8 band graphic EQ, or you can choose from 7 presets, or just go with flat and then increase the available bass and treble levels.NOW THE NOT SO GOOD NEWS:There is an issue I can't ignore. For one thing the only inputs are RCA video, RCA L/R sound, and HDMI. However there is a digital coaxial output for 5.1 surround into a reciever. The bad news is that this output can only be used with what ever TV channel your running into the TV. It can't send this multi-channel audio coming in from HDMI from what ever source you send into the TV, such as a blu-ray player. This I found rather lame to be honest. Now my blu-ay player does not have any coaxial or optical output, and my reciever has no HDMI input, only optical and coaxial. So unless you have a reciever with HDMI then your going to have to live with L/R stereo into your receiver or just use the TV speakers.For such a small TV the sound is better than I would have expected. It sounds pretty good, and there is a simulated surround effect you can activate to spacialize the sound, but it is a far cry from what a good reciever can do. So this is the reason for the 3 star rating.None the less for $98 why complain? Other than that the TV has simply gorgeous image, and the fact that even though it is native 720p, because the pixels are so tiny, with Blu-ray and HD signals it looks every bit as good as 1080p. I have experienced no issues at all with operation. The TV works great... so far.", "Date": "November 26, 2011"}, {"Title": "What A Deal!", "Author": "Bruce L", "ReviewID": "R3Q2A3XRNB5RAI", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This was to replace an old CRT in the bedroom. Perfect dimensions for the space I had to work with. Good port availability (OK, would have appreciated two HDMI ports, but hey...) and ease of setup for a fantastic picture. More surprising was the robust sound produced by the forward-facing, stereo speakers. I have had the displeasure of hearing some other units tinny and downright pathetic sound quality (out of some pretty big name brands). I had already planned on having to hook up some external solution, but after hearing it, ended up not running anything extra. Really pleased to date with operation, not one problem to report.

Fleury", "ReviewID": "R1CZ1D6HNTA8FY", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I ordered the set based upon two five star reviews, and they were spot on.  I don't have it connected for HDTV in the kitchen, but the analog picture is very clear and sharp.  There is an interesting optional picture mode which spreads the standard 4:3 TV image across the 16:9 ratio screen so that the center of the image looks pretty normal and the edges are stretched more.  This works well for individuals, who are usually center of screen, but not for team sports, where the guys on the edges look even fatter.  All in all, a great TV for the money.", "Date": "September 26, 2009"}, {"Title": "You Get What You Pay For", "Author": "Greg Smith \"Tuscano\"", "ReviewID": "R2M9KQ8BKI444A", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "This television is OK, but for the price I guess I should not have expected better.
