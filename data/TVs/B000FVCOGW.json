{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Great TV for the price", "Author": "J. Fackrell", "ReviewID": "R3MAH2375D9IV0", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "First of all, you won't find a much better TV for the price that has the features this TV has.  Out of the box it looked great.  I had previously owned a 62\" Toshiba DLP and a 60\" Sony LCD TV, both of which I returned because I was not satisfied.  Despite what others may say, this TV does better than the two TV's I just listed in relation to how regular TV looks.  At 65\" it does a great job of taking standard television and making it look good.  The Toshiba did an okay job, which I attribute to the DLP chip and the Sony LCD was just plain horrible.  Compared to the other two, this TV also is superior when it comes to the PIP and video functions.  The Sony didn't even come with PIP and the Toshiba would frame the pictures with black bars which made the pictures smaller.  This TV uses all of the available space for both pictures and you have options to reformat each picture so that one is larger than the other.  Switching between pictures is a breeze.Now to the reason I only gave it four stars...  Out of the box the fan seemed to buzz a little more than the other two TV's I owned.  I wouldn't say it's loud, but the buzz can certainly be heard when the volume is low.  I looked all over the internet to see if anyone else had experienced the same problem, but coulnd't find any reviews that mention this.  It may just be an issue with this particular TV.  But then again, I am a picky person and find flaws in many things that some would think are acceptable.Another problem is also not significant, but it is worth mentioning.  I found that if you mute the TV, then turn it off while muted and turn it back on later, the TV will still be muted even though the volume level may be turned up.  The first time this happened, I thought it was strange that it stayed muted when I turned it back on.  I then tried to turn the volume up and no sound came out.  The volume level would increase but you couldn't hear anything.  I tried changing the channel, changing the input, checked the cables, and even turned it off and back on but still no sound.  I then hit the mute button and finally the sound came back on.  This is definately a glitch that some may never notice, but I hope it saves some the frustration I experienced.  It does not do the same thing if you hit mute, then try to turn the volume up.  It only happens if you mute, turn your TV off and back on, then try to turn the volume up.  You must press mute to get the volume back.Aside from the two pretty insignificant issues, it's a great TV.  My brother also just bought the 62\" Samsung DLP, which is a great TV as well.  After owning and viewing these other brands, I definately think Mitsubishi and Samsung are the best by far.  Stay away from Sony and Toshiba.  The only reason I took the Mitsubishi over the Samsung was because it was 3\" in larger.12/13/06:I have had this TV now for about 6 months and thought I would provide an update...  The \"glitches\" I mentioned above are really not glitches after all.  Regarding the mute issue, that is actually listed as a function in the owners manual.  I haven't had any trouble with it since.  As for the fan, yes it seems a little loud when you first get it, but surprisingly it gets quieter the more you use it.  There must be a burn in period with the fan.  Overall, I have had no problems.  I have looked at other brands to see if I should have bought something else, but nothing seems to compare.  If you use PIP a lot like I do, this has the best format compared to other TV's.  This will also outperform any LCD project TV when it comes to standard definition TV due to the DLP and 6 segment color wheel (most other brands only have a 5 segment color wheel).  You can't go wrong with this TV!!!", "Date": "September 3, 2006"}, {"Title": "beautiful HDTV", "Author": "Jeffrey Austin", "ReviewID": "R1N6UEPN4CL9DS", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "paid 3k and feel its worth the price.  have only had for 2 weeks, but the 720p and 1080i signal I receive at times via outdoor antenna looks absolutely awesome.  no flaws to mention.  it has a built in formating function that allows you to fit the picture you receive to the screen size.  very adjustable with the settings(kelvin, 6 colors, etc...)also has numerous connections making install a snap(weighs 100lbs)very happy with this set for hdtvcouple downsides with analog signal...since it is a big screen size, analog signals can look very fuzzy close up(less than 10 feet)when viewing.

I called Amazon and was told to contact Misubishi since it was under manufacturer warranty. I did.

I was contacted in less than an hour and made an appointment for them to come the next day.  They were here at 8:45 AM the next day and took the TV in. They said if they had the part in stock I would get the TV back within 7 days and if not it could take 10 to 14 days.  They delivered the TV back to me one week to the day.  They replaced the light engine showing the cost to be $911 but I paid nothing.  I could not be more pleased with the service or the TV set.

The \"p\" stands for progressive scan, i.e., every line of each TV image is drawn instead of every other line as in old TV, resulting in clearer pictures (although I find it very difficult to tell the difference between 1080i and 1080p even on a huge set like this).

Although it's size was somewhat imposing at first, I now can't imagine having a smaller screen in our media room. It pays to go as big as your room can accomodate. Trust me.HD viewing is great...this is where this TV really shines. Regular channels (even the digital ones) are disappointing, ranging from slightly blurry to very blurry. Fortunately, my cable system has a fairly broad range of HD viewing, from which I rarely stray.I invested a little over $100 in a Sony up-converting DVD player which makes use of the 2nd HDMI connector on the TV. A great investment, providing \"near\" HD quality and full screen picture on most DVD's. This would be my recommended solution to DVD's until the HD and Blu-Ray formats come down significantly in price from where they're at today.My current problem/concern has been an intermittant issue with the TV shutting itself down after flashing a message about the \"room being too warm\". It's now happened 5 or 6 times. I'm suspecting that it's a problem within the TV, since it happens shortly after turning the system on, the room was probably at 70F, and the TV sits entirely exposed (i.e., no enclosed cabinet) on top of a media cabinet.

One needs a pick-up truck to move 65\" TV.  I had envisioned free shipping from Amazon solves problem of having to transport TV.  Everything looked perfect even after unboxing; nevertheless, there was an imperceptible screen depression that became annoying while I watched football games.  Normally straight field lines are distorted around this warped screen region.  Mitsubishi suggested couple local TV repair shops.  TV repair shops either will not do house call or work on TV sold by Amazon.  After repeated calls and emails, one local TV repair shop arranged by Mitsubishi schedule me in about 3 weeks.  The repair only took 5 minutes as the front screens needed to be reseated into their grooves; possibly shifted out of the groove during shipping?  Pain in the neck if one ever needs to repair big screen TVs.Next, hard to find spot with cable inlet to locate this large screen and then to arrange seating further than 9 feet away from screen for comfortable viewing.  Then, watching 4:3 picture images adjusted to fit 16:9 screen size is either seeing blacked out zones or altering 4:3 images.  Various choices to view images but nothing look exactly right.There is sometimes an annoying self shut-down within 30 seconds right after turn-on.  TV senses temperature imbalance and shuts-down.

The rest of it is abolutely 0 stars.First off the set broke in early February. It started shutting itself down due to a false lamp temperature problem immediately after booting up. Ok that happens, things break. This is where the nightmare begins.2 weeks after I report it to Mitsubishi to get it serviced, an authorized agent shows up without any tools or parts, not a good sign. Then I am told by said service tech. that I needed a new light engine and lamp and that I would have to fax them a copy of my proof of purchase so they could order the parts. About a week later after not hearing anything I called the servicer who told me the parts should have been in. I called Mits. to find out what the deal was and was told the parts were backordered. I waited 5 days to see when the parts would be in and was told they did not get a part number from the servicer. I asked if they had no part number how could they tell me they were backordered.Good ?. So a month and a half of hassle later, the service center comes out again...and hour and a half late mind you, again no tools, no parts and looks at the TV again and tells me it needs a light engine and a lamp..no kidding. That was Friday the 6th of April, 2 months after it broke. So I called Mits today , Monday the 9th of April and have spoken to 3 more unknowledgable customer-non-service reps from Bangledesh or wherever, and was told I needed to fax a copy of my proof of purchase just before she rattled off where I bought it(Electronics Expo) when I bought it and the model number. I told them I already did all this a month and a half ago, you know what I need, please get my warrantied TV fixed, its been 2 months. I have now sat on hold as I type for over an hour.

Just a note that I upgraded to 3 stars because as I said now that it works again, it is an amazing picture. I did take me 2 months to get it fixed, alot of frustration  and ribbing from the boys at work, but we made it through. If it breaks stay on them, I think it was a common failure in the light engine, hopefully Mits. worked it out.

Johnston \"Jaded User\"", "ReviewID": "R2MAYC865Z3XRB", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I own a WD-52628 model.  The 52 inch sister to this very model.  It actually uses a similar lamp to the 65 inch model.  This review applies to ALL MITSUBISHI REAR PROJECTION HD TVs.After 3 years of ownership, the tv has had numerous problems.  Each time the tv is \"out\" for repairs, it has been in a repair shop for at least 3 months.  Maintenance has only taken it out of action for 2-3 weeks waiting for the lamps.  I view maintenance and repair as two seperate items.The first problem that occurred was the blinking red light and no picture.  This was due to a burned out light engine, per the repair store.  If the warranty had not covered it in the first 180 days, it would have been an $1800 dollar repair, plus labor.The second issue is with the replacement and dispossal of the $230 lamps that contain mercury.  You can't just toss these things into the trash.  In the 3 years of ownership, I've gone through four lamps, each costing at least $230, at a cost of roughly a thousand dollars. In 3 situations I had to go through the internet to purchase new lamps.  Shipping at first from Mitsubishi took 3 weeks.This last problem that I am in the middle of now is the dreaded blinking green light on the front.  Per several investigative websites(Consumer Affairs, etc.), blinking green light is caused by two different types of situations.  The first situation is that one of the two cpu's on the device is not in synchronization with the other cpu.  Ergo no fix, just replace the item.  The other situation is with the 4 capacitors on the mainboard, either the 4 caps will need to be replaced by new capacitors, and/or the mainboard will need to be replaced.Minimum cost of repair for the last problem has been estimated at least at $1000 plus labor.  The problem is that any solution starts with recognizing a design flaw during manufacturing.  The tv sets were assembled with inadequate parts, per some investigatory websites.  The parts themselves do not function adequately in the environment created by the rest of the parts inside the tv.  The capacitors alone were not meant to handle the electrical load of the mainboard.There is one positive, the glare is not as much of a problem with this model.", "Date": "March 15, 2009"}, {"Title": "Good at first...", "Author": "Summer", "ReviewID": "R1OF1QDA9N8IW", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "I have has this TV for approximately 5 years.

Finally a picture that looks good but I only watch that one channel once a week. All of the other channels still look horrible. We call the store where we bought it. Now it seems we need monster cables. We purchase those for over $200 dollars. Picture still no good. We call the cable company again they come back out change the cables in the house. Still not a good picture. We call the store, they say it's our reception we should get satellite. We call cable company they come back out, change the box outside the house. Still a bad picture. We cancel the cable. We call satelite. They come out hook up our dish. Once again HD channels are great but don't watch but one, once a week. We call the store, they come out. NOW.... it's the satellite getting a bad reception, not the TV. Even though we are getting a signal of 97%. We call the satelite company they come back out adjust the satelite. I hold them hostage for some answers!!! By now it's been almost 3 months dealing with the same problem \" a bad picture\"!! They tell me I would need the satelite to recieve the HD channels, a pair of rabbit ears to recieve my local channels and an outside antenna to recieve other analog channels \"that I do watch\" to get a good decent picture.
