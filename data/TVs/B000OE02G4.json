Beautiful picture, no CLOUDING & great SOUND!", "Author": "Randy F", "ReviewID": "R339C9XCGVBVAE", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I had recently purchased the Samsung LN-S4095D 40\" 1080p LCD HDTVfrom Amazon, but it had a good amount of back light issues exactly like the Sony XBR's. I have read that it sometimes goes away by itself after a few weeks of use. But after 3 weeks it was still cloudy. I shipped it back and received a full refund. I'd heard that the LNT-series of Samsung's were coming out in March and that the problem had been resolved. After many in store demo's at BB and CC by asking the sales associates to hook up a blu-ray 1080p DVD (luckily they all had \"Happy Feet\" so they were exactly the same movie compared) I product tested the Samsung LNT4061F 40\" 1080p LCD HDTV, the LNT4065F, and LNT4066. Along with two Sony's that caught my eye Sony KDL-40XBR2 40\" Bravia XBR 1080p LCD HDTV,Sony KDL-40V2500 40\" Bravia V-Series 1080p LCD HDTV. All were within my price range. But the Sony V2500 wasn't even close to standing with the Samsung LNT's. The XBR2 is great, but watch out for clouding which Sony will NOT admit is a problem, I recommend googling the XBR clouding problem before buying from SONY. If you're looking for the best all around TV (price, sound, picture quality, no CLOUDING, hook-up versatility(3x HDMI)) then the LNT4065 is the perfect TV for you. It has hidden side speakers that sound very rich and full. If you already have a sound system and prefer a matte finish to your TV get the LNT4061. The LNT4061 has poor sound from its hidden bottom speaker, but the matte screen is excellent to prevent glare. The LNT4065 has a semi-gloss screen, which makes the 15K:1 contrast ratio look amazing! I haven't had any glare problems at all. The only difference between the LNT4065 and LNT4066 is that the 66 has a different chasis. The internals are all the same. I've confirmed this through extensive research. The 65 has buttons on the top of it, while the 66 has pressure sensitive buttons on the bottom left corner. Not worth the extra money to me. PS2 and Gamecube games look fantastic on it. I don't have a Wii or PS3 to try on it yet, but I'll submit another review when I do. This TV is so versatile. So many features for sound, gaming, and picture quality. You can adjust everything you want. LCD is the only way to go, with this TV you get the CR of plasma without the ghosting! This is the TV to buy!Big plus to Amazon. I bought the TV for $2199 and saw that a week later it was 1905 and they refunded the difference.JUNE 5, 2007 UPDATE: I purchased a PS3 and a Wii and both look fantastic! The 1080p HDMI 1.3 look crystal clear, I've played Fear(720p), and Ninja Gaiden (1080p). The 1080p upconverting that the PS3 does with the recent firmware upgrade makes all of my regular DVD's look great, and my PS2 games look just as good. The Wii only uses RCA but it looks great with 480i. Zelda and the Wii Sports look fantastic. Having three HDMI ports really comes in handy with a PS3 and DirecTV (HDMI 1080i).", "Date": "May 3, 2007"}, {"Title": "Excellent TV!", "Author": "Jason Freeland", "ReviewID": "R37I83M5CMB7KT", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "After reviewing the traffic at avsforums on this TV and its competitors, I decided to go with the LNT4065. There were several comments about HDMI issues and still some clouding issues were reported with this model, but I took the plunge anyway. I am very glad I did - the TV is incredible. It is a pleasure to watch and brings life to all the material I have viewed on it.Some basics about my configuration - I have three sources that I view on this TV - a PC, an XBox connected via Monster component cables, and digital cable from comcast.Cable:The SD material is surprisingly watchable, and HD content looks fantastic of course. For the first time in recorded history, my wife actually chose to sit on the couch and watch a baseball game for an hour because it was such a spectacular visual experience.PC:Best computer monitor experience I have ever had bar none. Black levels not quite as good as the 19\" trinitrons I recently donated to goodwill. But in every other way, unbelievable. Digital photographs are miraculous.Xbox:This was the real surprise. Games suck - not the tvs fault, its the lack of HD game content for the first gen xbox. But I primarily use the xbox as an A/V device with Xbox Media Center and when paired with this TV the experience is incredible. I purchased an Oppo 981 along with the TV and in side-by-side comparisons with the same SD-DVDs XBMC schooled the Oppo in upsampling quality. I was actually very surprised that the Oppo so clearly came in second place to XBMC - so much that I spent about a week scouring the internet for setting recommendations on the Oppo to make sure I wasn't missing something. All I can say is that it will be a LONG time before I go out and upgrade all my DVD stuff to HD.*Update: Well not that long it turns out. Planet Earth knocked me over in 1080p and single-handedly made the case for an HD player. So after wrestling with the format war for a couple weeks I went ahead and bought a Blu-Ray drive from amazon, and found an open box HD-DVD drive at circuit city for $90.00. Been really enjoying having both formats. Been spending a lot of time watching very nice looking movies.Some technical thoughts on the TV:- My TV displays some extremely minor clouding - we're talking nit-pick bigtime here (thanks for the OCD avsforums...hehe). I only notice it when these three stars align: 1) the room is completely dark, 2)the TV is displaying the completely black desktop of the PC display, 3) the backlight is set above 6 of 10. I find the whites disturbingly bright above this backlight level though. I am currently enjoying the picture quality and the backlight is set to 3 on all inputs (typically watch in a shadowed to dark room).- The glossy screen may be distracting to some, but I find it very enjoyable. Even when you are watching the TV and are not consciously seeing any \"reflections\" I think the gloss causes the eye to perceive the TV as a glass plane instead of the typical screen door film texture of LCD - which strengthens this TVs visual likeness to CRT displays. The same thing helps plasmas I think. Also, apparently this glossy coating has a component that also helps the contrast ratio or black levels or something - remember reading that somewhere.- Black levels are outstanding but shadow detail is still lost a bit. I am going to be honest - its very minimal but that is the only thing that remains a negative factor to the viewing experience. On DVD content the image transitions from the darks to black a bit too abruptly - instead of a smooth transition through the dark-color gradients. Put another way - imagine 10 is white and 0 is black with shades of gray in between. It appears as though the TV displays everything .5 and less as black. Maybe .25... not a distraction, but a very slight detraction - maybe results in my happiness being 4.85 stars out of 5. I will say that of all the LCD tvs I have viewed this TV handles blacks & shadows the best. It is definitely worth living with this minor flaw of LCD technology to get the perfection this TV exhibits in every other way.- This unit is the closest thing to Plasma as I believe you can get in an LCD tv at this time - without the unacceptable baggage that comes with plasma. I owned a 42\" plasma that I returned because I wasn't interested in spending 3k on a TV and then having to live with the following crap: can't lay the tv flat (ie lay the box on its side so it fits in back of your SUV); TV weighs 90 pounds even though its a \"flat panel\"; static images that are displayed on the screen for a couple hours become \"ghosted\" faintly in the plasma's picture for the next couple days until the display phosphors loose the memory effect. Sure, the \"burn-in\" issue is fixed, but the ghosting thing is still real annoying. Whatever.To summarize: I couldn't be happier with this tv and feel it was well worth the purchase price. Amazon was a pleasure to buy from, and Eagle got the tv to me without any issues.

It looks like a plasma... By far, this TV blows all the other LCD TVs that I've seen. How many TVs can boast a 15000:1 contrast ratio.The colors on this TV are stunning. The \"dynamic\" setting is almost too bright at night. The blacks and whites show up very nicely.I am also surprised at how decent the quality is for upscaled DVDs (HDMI 1080i) and Tivo content.When in 1080p mode, the quality is almost too good. While watching \"King Kong\" on HD-DVD, the detail was so amazing that the people looked blue-screened against the digital backgrounds. XBox 360 looks absolutely amazing in 1080p mode.Although I use a surround sound system for my audio, my Tivo content runs the audio through the TV. The audio quality is very good for an internal system.Extremely minor complaint: The TV's internal sound system only does 2 channel audio. However, there is a digital optical out for connecting to a surround sound system. I have not yet found a way to pass 5.1 channel sound through the unit's optical out. So when I play DVDs, I mute the TV's internal sound. For the price, quality and features, this is a very minor inconvenience that's perfectly tolerable.The only complaints I had heard about older Samsung HDTVs were about the glowing blue Samsung LED on the front of the unit that could not be turned off. This unit fixes that with a menu option to keep off the external light.

Tons of inputs. 3 HMDI v1.3, 2 component, 2 composite, 1 VGA, 1 S-video, OTA and coax hookups. The HDMI, VGA, and component are compatible at 1080p with the tv. The picture itself is amazing. With all the tvs I physically looked at, this one just looked the best to me. Blacks look black, not grey. Aesthically it looks amazing too. Black finish along the tv, with the speakers hidden. I thought the sound quality, given where the speakers are located and the size of them, was exceptional (for factory tv speakers). No handshake or banding issues. No dead pixles. There are lots of options with size. I love how the tv auto syncs with other samsung equipment, allowing the use of just the tv control for everything. Have it connected to a 1080P samsung upconverter which works well.Cons:When using HDMI/DVI cable from my PC to the tv about once every 2 hours i will get a very quick pink or green flash. For some reason it is only from the PC, never from any other source, and does not happen when PC runs thru the VGA. I was disappointed with the PIP function. You can only watch TV (or any source run thru the coax) with PIP. IE, if your playing a PC game, u can watch TV. But you cant play a game and watch your DVD player thru PIP (dont know if this is consistent with other tvs thou, but I wish this one did). No ghosting with this tv, but on fast moving close ups you can see some pixilation. IE while watching a bball game, player makes a shot, camera zooms on his face as he runs down the court. Only time ever noticed this.note: Eagle GL shipped my package. Package looked like it was handled properly, and they called me on time to deliver the package. However, i elected to pick it up Friday instead of having them deliver it Monday (they dont do weekends, dont ask me why). I was not very impressed with them when picking up the package. The lady at the desk did not even know how to let me sign for it! But package was unharmed, free dilvery by amazon.Other notes:4065 has a glass finish on it, which makes colors more vibrant and more realistic. However, for some people it may cause glare. I have had no glares problems when using proper lighting. One note with pixilation, happens on all LCDs. I have only noticed it a few times, on closeups on fast moving objects. One reason why I chose this tv, over the 4665 or any larger LCD, is the pixilation and ghosting become more apparent on larger screens with the same refresh rate. But like I said, practically none on this one and its smaller size of 40\".Conclusion:Overall, a TV needs to have great Picture Quality, and this one has the best I have seen with tvs 40\" and up.", "Date": "June 11, 2007"}, {"Title": "Best 40\" LCD Period", "Author": "L.

The black levels on it are comparable to a plasma, but without the worries of burn-in, I use it as a PC monitor with Vista Ultimate and it looks gorgeous @ 1920x1080. I also have an SA 8300HD DVR and I'm amazed how natural the flesh tones are, especially The Sopranos and Entourage. Letterman & Leno look crisp! Next investment is a 1080p HD/Bluray player. But for the time being I have an upconverting Sony DVD changer that looks great. With 3 HDMI inputs I've cut the cable clutter down by half! The built in media center \"Wiselink\" (USB Thumbdrive) is kinda lame, I wish it could play videos like Dvix, H.264 or WMV, but only reads mp3's and jpg's, maybe Samsung will add new features with the built-in firmware update feature.

The picture quality is excellent, the sound \"stages\" are terrific and the menu is easy to navigate and play around with. To respond to a few of the issues previous reviewers have raised:a. Glare off the screen: I've got windows (with wood shutters) facing the screen and do notice the reflection during daylight hours. Although I primarily watch TV at night, when I do want to watch during the day, I just close the shutters, and all is great; the picture is superb despite the ambient daylight.b. Firmware/software versions: The set from Amazon, delivered in mid-July, had the up-to-date versions (1024/1008).c. Shipping Carrier: No problems whatsoever. Carrier called a day in advance ( 2 days earlier than estimated )and set up a delivery window, and delivered as scheduled.I was going to purchase a larger screen, since a 52 inch would just fit into the primary viewing space I had available. However, since the price from Amazon was so attractive ($1670 at the time) for this 1080 HDTV, and because I had a secondary viewing room I'd eventually want an HDTV in, I decided to get this smaller screen size and then wait a year before getting a larger screen - with presumably even newer technology built in. When I do that, this 40 incher will go into the other \"secondary\" location. Anyhow, sitting eight feet away from this 40-inch screen actually works out extremely well. Those of you who may not have the bigger bucks to spend on a larger screen will not have to worry if your viewing spot is around eight feet from the screen. It really works well.Lastly, the price and the post-price guarantee from Amazon is purty darn good. This set has fluctuated in price since my purchase. It went down around $35, and I quickly called Amazon, and they credited me for that difference. Then it went up higher than my original purchase price, and I just smiled. Then the price went down to $1575 within the \"30-day from shipping date\" period, so I called Amazon again, and again they credited my account. What great service!I have patronized Amazon for years, but had never purchased a \"big ticket\" item before.

I read a lot of reviews, the vast majority were very positive.  I also viewed a LNT4665F at a local retailer.  The picture was far superior to the others in the store.  The Amazon price included shipping and was about $500 less than that at the retailer after taking sales tax into account.Some of the reviewers had problems with shipping, but my experience was fantastic.  They were actually a week ahead of the initial estimated delivery date.  It was delivered in 7 days from the date I ordered it.  The shipper called 2 days before delivery to schedule the date and time.  They were right on time. They also unpacked the unit and set it where I requested.  They would also have disposed of the packing materials if I wanted them to, but I kept these materials in case there's a problem.After two weeks, we have had no issues.  The picture is great, particulary HD material.  Over the AIR regular analog broadcasts are not as good, but acceptable. The good news is all of our local stations offer HD, which is far better.  The tuner is very good.  The HD stations are perfect and the analog broadcasts are better than our old set. We also have a DVD player that up-converts to 1080p and provides an excellent picture.The unit has ample connections and the HDMI connections provide the true HD material along with 5.1 audio (also available thru the optical audio connection).The speakers in the TV are surprisingly good for their size and power, although for DVD's we generally run the sound thruogh the HT speaker system.The remote and TV set-up was fairly easy if you read the manual.Overall, we are very pleased with our purchase, the product itself, the price through Amazon and the delivery.

First of all, I bought this from Amazon and I have no complaints...would do it again in a heart beat (Order, price, delivery, etc were great)! The 4065 LCD does have a great picture, however, the HDMI has been an issue for me. I have a Sanyo Xacti HD2 camcorder and wanted to show my video via the HDMI output to my new Samsung 4065. Well, the video looked great, but no sound! I thought this must be a Sanyo issue so I sent the camera to the shop and they found no issues (in fact, they hooked it up to 3 different LCDs via HDMI and it worked perfectly, sound and all). This is where my Samsung customer service saga begins...from the first of August 2007 until now (mid-October), I've had 2 service calls with four different repairs and still the Xacti HD2 does not work with the TV (latest controller board and firmware, etc). I went to Fry's just to check out the camera myself on 4 different LCDs and it worked great on two (a Samsung DLP and Phillips LCD 1080P), but when I tried the Samsung 4065 and 4071, still no sound. Needless to say I'm very disappointed. Perhaps I'm too hard on Samsung and it's simply incompatible, but that's why I called Samsung in July to make sure there were no issues and their tier 2 tech person said it should be fine. My advice...if you have a critical component you want to use with your Samsung, check the compatibility PRIOR to purchase if possible OR save all packing materials and make sure everything works FIRST. After my conversation with Tier 2 tech I assumed the TV was fine and tossed all my boxes...don't make that same mistake.

I have probably owned the latest and greatest from them for the past 15 years or so. I was in the market for a new 40 inch (wanted bigger, but space in the bedroom did not allow). I really wanted to stay with the Sony. Two things turned me off about their current top line offerings. First, the 2500 was ugly, I mean the thing looks like a first generation HD LCD. The XBR's where way to pricy, and I did not like the Silver. Then, I saw this TV in the store and I was blown away. The reviews on this site and others like AVS Forums could not be any more true. Aesthetically, this TV is gorgeous. I loved the gloss black border witht eh hidden speakers. Very sleek and minimal. There really isnt too much to add to the other reviews, but I did want to comment on one thing.Some have mentioned a concern with the glossy screen and glare in brighter rooms. I myself am very picky, and my TV is in a room that gets a lot of sunlight. Although the sunlight is never direct, I have never had a problem with glare. I actually prefer the gloss screen. It makes that picture really pop. I have heard reports of Samsung CS not being the greatest, but then again, this has a 1 year warranty for parts and labor, which is the standard in the industry.

I'm even less qualified to speak of audio, but I was relieved to find that the built-in speakers are perfectly satisfactory stand-ins until I can muster the funds for a proper audio set up.  I can't think of any complaints.  Looks good on or off, inputs to spare, great value.  If you're shopping for a mid-sized 1080p set, you should definitely buy one, but there's no need to stop at that rather lonely number.Also, I read several bad reviews of Eagle Global Shipping before buying the TV from Amazon.  I was a bit worried, but decided to go ahead and buy from Amazon knowing that Eagle would ship it since Amazon had it for so much cheaper (though they rather rudely raised the price by 50 bucks the day I intended to buy it).  I'm happy to report that I didn't have any trouble with Eagle, save for their rather lax reporting on shipment progress.  But it got here on time and unmolested, which is the more important part to get right if you have to choose one.", "Date": "September 14, 2007"}, {"Title": "Best quality picture and features for the price", "Author": "Paul Tinsley \"Tinz\"", "ReviewID": "R2U3AD5CY4XBYB", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "The picture quality is stunning. 1080p looks pin sharp and even SD DVDs look just a whisker away from HD quality, if you have a decent DVD Upscaler like the Oppo 981-HD. The tuner is better than my Comcast Motorola DVR!! I directly connected the cable into the TV and the picture quality is amazing compared to the DVR supplied by Comcast. I have also played PC games, notably Battlefield 2142 and Oblivion. Both look great, even if you stretch the output to a 16:9 aspect. Oblivion can be set to run at 1080 if you have the right graphics card features on your PC. I sometimes use the TV to Skype my Mom back in Britain. It's cool speaking to her through the TV screen ;-)There are plenty of settings and connections for other equipment, such as consoles. I plan to get the new PS3 soon which has a 1080p resolution. It's going to be awesome on this Samsung. The only microscopic niggles that I have is I wish they would supply a few screen shrinking modes, as some cable channels, correctly rendered in their 4:3 ratio to fill the screen, would look better if they could be shrunk to hide the cable compression artefacts. This isn't the TV's fault. If the cable transmission is good, the picture quality will blow you away. I also had a few fuzzy blotches on the screen that have been gradually fading. I have read that others have had this and the blotches almost disappear after a month or two of use. You can't see them unless the transmission includes a dark background, then you might just spot a slight hazy spot.

I somewhat limited my search to Sony and Samsung due primarily to my bias towards those brands after years of using their TVs.My wife and I both agreed early on we were drawn to the pictures of the Samsung over the Sony LCDs.  Based on that and the fact that the Samsungs are priced a little lower we focused our attention on the 61/65/69/71 models.  I'm an accountant by trade so I tend to like the details, but I'm not going to regurgitate a lot of the facts and specs about this LCD that covered in other posts.  Let me hit on just a few key points regarding my decision and what I've confirmed since setting up this LCD:1) 120hz vs 60hz:  The 69/71 models have the 120hz \"Auto Motion Plus\" feature.  The only time I could see a noticeable difference was when the sales guy at a store played a DVD with very slow panning scene on both a 65 and 71 at the same time.  The picture on the 65 appeared slightly \"jerky\" compared to the 71.  At all other times during normal movie scenes I could not distinguish any difference with picture quality related to motion.  Therefore the 120Hz was not a \"must have\" requirement for me.  Since setting up the 65, I've watched college basketball, news, talk shows, etc and have not noticed motion issues, similar to what was demonstrated for me at Tweeter.2) Matte vs Glossy Screen:  I spent a lot time going back and forth on this, because my room does get a lot direct sunlight from bay windows on the right side from where the LCD is located.  There are also wall sconces behind me that I knew could be reflected in a glossy screen.  Based on that I was planning to purchase the 61 with the matte screen, but I wanted to take one more look at it compared to the 65.  While at BB looking at these models side by side the colors simply appeared richer and more brilliant on the 65's glossy screen.  So I decided to go with the 65 and deal with any \"glare\" issues that might occur at times.  I have watched this LCD with a lot of light coming into the room and have not experience any glare problems.  I do see reflections on the LCD when it is off, but I've found that the brightness of the picture really masks any light reflecting on the screen.3) Buying Online:  Let me start by saying that this is the first time I've purchased a somewhat expensive electronics product online.  Amazon's pricing was better than the major retail chains, plus the savings on sales tax convinced me to purchase through Amazon.  What I found somewhat surprising was how much the pricing fluctuates on an almost daily basis (kind of like gas!) for the LCDs I was interested in.  So I recommend that while you're doing your research start monitoring the pricing of the models you're interested in each day.  I was seeing $200 to $400 swings in pricing going up and then down again.  Also, just as the pricing changes, so does the actual seller.  Amazon was the listed seller for my LCD one day, and then the next day it was Electronics Expo when I made my purchase.  Make sure you research the third party partners and their return policies as compared to Amazon.  My LCD showed up damaged.  The styrofoam corners were all broken-up and the corner of the LCD was cracked.  It was not packaged well and I think UPS can be rough on those boxes.  There are some very negative third party reviews out there and it seems that Amazon has no role in handling a customer dispute with their retail partner.  Fortunately, in my case, Electronics Expo sent out a new LCD right away and had UPS pick up the damaged one.  No problems.4) Picture Settings:  There is a popular posting \"1499\" on the AVSforum which provides \"optimal\" picture settings for the Samsungs.  I loaded those settings for the \"movie\" and \"standard\" picture modes.  To be honest though I really like the out-of-box \"Enhanced\" picture mode, so I just leave it in that mode.  It provides a bright and brilliant picture that you can't help but stare at regardless of what show is on.5) Additional Products Purchased:  I bought the Cables To Go Velocity HDMI Cable (5 meters)and the Sanus VMPL50B Universal Flat Panel TV Wall Mount Bracket, Black.  They work great with this LCD and I recommend both.Bottom line: Fantastic LCD and a great value!", "Date": "March 12, 2008"}, {"Title": "Great TV but LCD still isn't perfected", "Author": "Johny Royal \"CPT\"", "ReviewID": "R416CMH7OF16I", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I did alot of research before buying this TV and really I am quite happy with it. The picture is amazingly clear and bright for HD sources. Viewing this TV next to other LCD's at Best Buy really made up my mind on which was the best. However, even in 1080i HD, scenes that have subtle shading of darker colors (mostly scenes of the sky at night-such as in the animated movie \"Cars\") show up with rough pixelated edges on the boundries where the colors would blend together seemlessly on my 22\" CRT HD display. I've read that this may be compression artifacs due to getting the HD signal from Comcast and that Bluray and HDDVD look seemles but I haven't got to test that out. Besides I'll watch alot more HD over cable than I will Bluray--even when I finally get one. Maybe the 4075/4085 models with 14 bit processing will do a better job with subtle gradations of shading when they come out soon (funny how Samsung keeps their upcoming release quite so people don't wait a month to get the newer models), but then again they'll cost twice as much. All in all though I'm pretty happy with the purchase and can live with the drawbacks common to all of these early generation LCDs.

Fortunately, by comparing to the LG, I knew which channels were missing.  By repeatedly scan on those selected channels, I was finally able to catch them all.(2)  Digital close captioning need improvement.  In some shows on ABC, some close captioning will not be erased, ending up the screen is covered by close captionnig.  LG does not have that problem on the same shows.  Also, when there is no digital CC on digital channel, you have to manually switch to analog CC from the menu.  LG does this automatically.(3)  The USB only handles FAT16 and FAT32 formats.  Other TV such as LG can handle NTFS format also.  This may be a problem if one formats their external hard disk in NTFS format.(4)  If you want to deviate from the factory video settings, you have to change the preset three settings.  However, you then lose the factory settings unless you trigger the reset.  Other TV, while keeping a few preset factory settings, let you change the video settings under user settings.  Then, you can easily switch to factory settings quickly without losing your own user settings.(5)  Wish it allows you to zoom in 720p or 1080i modes.

Alvarez", "ReviewID": "R1ISNIAKICD8V7", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "It's been now three weeks since I started using this Samsung TV, and am thoroughly pleased with it. I had recently purchased a PS3 to dub as a hi-def gaming and blu-ray player, and watching anything from that system on my two-year old 22\" CRT would not do it justice. After about a week of research, a couple of visits to BestBuy for live demonstrations and questions, I decided to get more bang for the buck by chosing Samsung LCD over Sony.After learning a bit about HDTVs from the wonderful resources at CNet, I decided on my requirements for this purchase: 1080p native resolution (everything else is upscaled by either the TV or the source), a decent contrast ratio (10,000:1 or more; this TV is 15,000:1), and a good response time for the display. At this point in time, end of 2007, it seems that in the LCD TV market there is really two options only: Sony or Samsung. Balance seeking reps at BB said that you may pay more for Sony and get less features, but you have more experience and technology. With Samsung, you get more bang for the buck, all more affordable and with intermediate experience in the market. Although I consider myself a video-and-audiophile, I was still on a budget and did not want to overspend it.After I received the TV, through a relatively small shipping company with great service, it was quick to set-up. I hooked up the systems on to its multiple inputs (great feature!), and everything was up and running in minutes. I played one of the epic fights in Troy (Blu-Ray) and was simply blown away by the clarity, detail, and vividness. I was sold. This is something considerable to me, because I cannot stand artifacts in video or distortion in audio. And now not only do movies look awesome, but also video games on the PS3, and even the Wii.In the end, this is a great TV for a great price; it's tax free and shipping is included.

So for me to even write this review is to say that I must have been considerably impressed or disgusted with my product.  I this case, however, I'm glad to say that I'm very impressed with the product itself and the service I received from Amazon and the Eagle Logistics delivery.Amazon has the best price, hands down.  I got this TV for $1360 from Amazon (originally $1460 but they lowered the price and I called and had $100 dollars refunded with no hassle).  All retail stores were selling this TV for $1700 - $1900 dollars (tv is definitely worth that much).  The Eagle delivery service was lightning fast.  Amazon estimated arrival like 2-3 weeks after my order.  I received the TV in 3 days!!!  I was pumped that I would be able to watch the Patriots vs Colts game in HD in my own living room. Eagle brought the TV into my living room (they called the night before to confirm a delivery time window) and unpacked the tv.  The delivery guy let me set it up and turn it on to make sure it was in good condition and working before he left.On to the tv itself....Setting it up was no problem at all, all the menus and things are very easy to got through.  The picture quality is amazing!!  I didn't even have to change any of the color settings.  I haven't really gotten the chance to mess around with it too much.  The HD picture is stunning.  I watched football all day this sunday and there was no distortion with the fast action on the screen.  I was concerned that regular TV would look like junk on the TV because that is what I had see from every HD TV that I looked at in the store (maybe its because they had their image stretched to the full width of the screen).  To set everyones mind at ease, the normal broastcast looked excellent as well.  DVDs looked good...I don't have an HD DVD player, but I plan on getting one now to get the best picture I can (I like to watch a lot of movies). The sound from the TV's hidden speakers was very good, but I wasn't concerned with this since I internally muted them and hooked up my receiver using the optical audio cable.As for the asthetics of the TV.  The tv has a very nice glossy finish throughout.  It looks very modern/upscale. When turned on there is no glare unless you have a lot of light coming through windows facing the TV (this can be fixed with some curtains or darker shades...not really a concern though).In conclusion I'd like to say to Amazon...keep up the good customer service, i will be back to purchase more items.  I'd also like touch on one question many might have...the difference between the LNT4065F, 4066F, 4061F.  The 4065 and 4066 are the same TV except for the shape pretty much.  The 4066 is a best buy exclusive TV and you will probably not find it anywhere else (this allows them to have whatever price they want so as not to have any competition, best buy in my opinion is no longer the best buy at all, they have terrible prices now, I do not intend to shop there any longer).  The difference between the 4065/66 and the 4061 is the 15000:1 vs 10000:1 contrast ratio.

First of all, why LCD TV? DLP Tvs have a very less viewing angle (around 140 to 150 degrees) and the contrast is also not high. Also even the screen is flat they have an extended backside and takes a lot of space. But LCD Tv's generally have more viewing angle and even though the screen size is bit smaller than DLP tvs the clarity is better. (Some people might not agree with me on this - it is my personal opinion.)Now in LCD tvs, I went to the local sears, best buy and circuit city stores to look for the affordable but best one and I decided to go for 40\"  models..I checked different models of LCD HD TVs from different companies. The top choices were - Sony, Samsung and Toshiba. Now Sony is no doubt the best(but I didn't like because of the low contrast). Toshiba is also good but they are costly and also don't have good contrast ratio.In Samsung, there were various range of contrast ratio and viewing angles, but LNT-4065F had the best configuration within my price range(1.6K to 1.8K). It has 178 degrees viewing angle and 15K:1 contrast ratio which makes it different from others.So I came home and started searching for the model in different sites.One fine day I saw the price at amazon lowered to 1520 and that very evening I booked. I got the TV in 5 days and the eagle service was good.The unpacked the TV and tested it in front of me.So far it is running very smoothly and I have connected a dvd player, antenna and my laptop to it.Overall it is an excellent purchase.As sugar on top of cake I got a $31 return from amazon because of the price drop to $1489(for 2 days only) and just after that it got up to 1625 and now the price is 1589.", "Date": "September 3, 2007"}, {"Title": "Clear picture, easy to set up", "Author": "E.

I went to the box stores to see the LNT4065 in person because I was worried about the glare issues that some reviewers have written about.  I also wasn't sure if I should buy the 40 inch or 46 inch model and I wanted to see if I was satisfied with the size of the TV from our normal viewing distance, which is 10-12 feet.I didn't feel like the picture quality of the Samsung blew the other HDTV models out of the water when viewing them side by side at the box store, most of the TV sets looked equally great, however I did like the look and feel of the Samsung sets overall more than the other TVs.  The glare issue also was not an issue for me in the box store setting.After looking at a 40 inch and 46 inch set from 10-12 feet I was leaning towards the 46 inch model, but my wife didn't want the TV to be too large and I didn't want to spend the extra money.  I ended up buying the 40 inch model.I was tempted to buy from the box stores, even though they were several hundred more dollars, but I ended up buying from Amazon, the savings was too great not to.  Some of the reviews of the Eagle deliver service that I read were not very comforting and this is a fairly substantial purchase--this was the reason why I was considering buying from the box store.My delivery estimate was to for delivery on a Wednesday.  However, Eagle called to schedule delivery on the previous Friday, 3 days earlier than the estimate.  Eagle has online tracking so I had a good idea that the delivery would be earlier than the initial estimate.When the delivery team arrived they were nice and efficient.  They unpacked the TV, turned it on and did some simple tests.  I signed off that the power worked, the sound worked, etc.  And they were off.My experience with Amazon and Eagle (Seattle area) was great.  I was thoroughly impressed and it exceeded my expectations.As for the TV, I feel that I got what I paid for.  I have no complaints and am satisfied with my purchase.  As for the 40 inch vs 46 inch debate, I don't have any regrets that I didn't get the 46 inch TV.  The 40 inch is just fine.Once in our house, I can see why some people give negative reviews about the glare.  We have two large windows behind where we sit to watch the TV and on bright days it is noticable, but not horrible.  I'm pretty picky and it wouldn't prevent me from purchasing this series of Samsung TV again.

I did not experience the same probelms with Ealge as others noted.  They delivered my set as promissed, on time.  They also took all the shipping materials with them so I was not left with the huge box.The set worked perfectly the first day.  The second day, the set started having dead pixels all over the screen and then it would not even turn on.  I tried everything to reset the tv, but I ended up having to call Samsung.  One week later a local service company onbealf of Samsung came out.  They replaced two of the three main components of the TV under the waranty.  They said the two parts were likely defective and not damaged during shipping.Since then (a few weeks), the set has worked perfectly.  I still have not found my favorite picture settings (brightness, etc.) so this has become a bit of a tiresome comparison (which settings make the picture better).  I do like the fact that each input can have different settings..  CNET.com reviewed the 46\" model of the same series [...] and gave it a good review.  They also suggested a picture setting for a dark room [...].Currently I am only using a 1080i cable box and a 480p DVD player.  I have been very happy with the quality of the picture from both sources.  However, I would like to see Samsung provide some suggestions for the picture settings.One important note: The LN-T4065F has a relative shiny screen and can produce a glare in a bright room.

No money out of my pocket. Can't fault Samsung for trying to make it right. +1 star.Update - 11/11/2010 - Submitted a repair ticket last night and got a call around 9:30 this morning - I'm impressed with the promptness. The rep delivered bad but not surprising news -- apparently my TV was not eligible for free repair, though the words chosen implied the existence of a batch that might be eligible -- and the quote was $140 for labor, $20 for parts -- capacitors, actually, which confirms the evidence discovered last night.It could not have come at a worse time. Wanted to spend xmas money on others. So the new plan is to browbeat the repair people into a lower price, pay it, and start saving money to buy a new TV in July. Which assumes the Samsung won't fail again before then. The rating has now fallen to one star. Can you hear that noise? It's Samsung's reputation doing a death-rattle in my mind...Update - 11/10/2010 - Unit began failing about a week ago. Exhibits on/off clicking and multicolored vertical lines. Would sometimes work after several power cycles. At first assumed it was a thermal stress problem or maybe it was caused by being left on with no signal. Searches conducted on Amazon and elsewhere turned up an interesting problem with the power supply.Granted large-scale LCD is a pretty new technology, but only three years of use qualifies the set as a lemon. I de-rated it to two stars -- fewer if I decide just to junk it instead of fixing it. Either way, it's not staying in my living room past Christmas.--- old info ---First, a disclaimer - I am not an expert on TV. The largest TV I had in my house before the Samsung's arrival was a circa 1990 JVC 35\" CRT, which had a sweet picture, but required at least three people to move it. It eventually died, leaving a gaping white void in my living room until last Thursday, when the Samsung arrived.Watching standard cable on the Samsung is so-so, especially up close (< 4'), but once my Xbox360 was connected, the power of the set's capabilities was easily apparent. So it passed the first test.The important test - using it as a PC monitor on `roids - came a couple of days ago. It runs fine at 1920x1080 for Word, Outlook, etc., but I'll have to increase the default font size to make it readable at \"sofa distance\". My favorite shooter - Battlefield2 - doesn't having a setting at full rez, but at 1280x1024X75 it's just magnificent. Now I have other problems, such as having to switch to wireless keyboard and mouse (I bought a Logitech LX710 yesterday), so it's bye-bye to my MX518 and n52 (reviewed by me on Amazon) - I'll miss you old buddies. Maybe Belkin will make a wireless n52? Going back to a WASD keyboard has been a pain, and I don't want to use a USB extension cord if I can help it.It's only weakness lies in its' limited (but workable) number of PC video modes. And it does have a slight (but not crippling game-wise) ghosting.All said, if you have the itch for a flat-panel TV with plenty of A/V inputs, including  VGA, and under $2K to spend, the Samsung is hard to beat. My only regret is not buying the 46\" model.Update - 7/24/2007 - A small triumph, a minor setback, and a major obstacle.The triumph - I purchased a universal component cable for my Xbox360 (it only came with the composite), and discovered my 360's video settings were only 480p. Switched it to 1080p and in the words of the greatest actor of our generation...WHOOOOA!The setback - wireless PC keyboard and mouse works OK for spreadsheets and other mundane tasks, but not for gaming. Re-instated my MX518 and n52 as primary controls for BF2, so now at least I'm moving when someone makes that lucky shot.The obstacle - tried to hook up a stereo amp and speakers to the Samsung's Audio Out ports but got nothing. The Sound menu won't let me change the source from \"Main\" - the selection is greyed out. Not sure why. Best guess is that Audio Out won't activate unless it detects a certain level of impedance. Will keep you posted.Update - 7/25/2007 - Audio Out OK - used a real amp instead of a digital surround amp to test.", "Date": "July 17, 2007"}, {"Title": "LN40A530 doesnt last more than 1 year", "Author": "Chad G.

So if you are in the market for this set or any other HDTV, make sure you have all the right add-ons from the very start. It's worth it - trust me.Edit: Mid-December 2009 the TV started to take longer and longer to turn on. It turns out that the capacitors on the power supply are cheap and  they needed to be replaced. According to different forums, this seems to be the issue after a couple years for this model and a couple others. Sad, my 1 year extended warranty ran out December 1st. I found a local repair guy that knew exactly what was going on and replaced five \"caps\" for $125.00 (pick-up/parts/labor) so I was fortunate. I had another quote that was $250.00 - so it pays to call around. I've read other post where do-it-yourself people did it for under $20.00. So if you see a 4065/66/61F on Craig's List or in an ad, ask questions because a lot of people are posting this same issue. I know that there are no perfect TVs out there (other than the Kuro), but I'm really upset with Samsung regarding this known issue. On a side note...my next HD purchase, I'll get the 4 year ext. warranty.Update 7-17-12: Because of a class action lawsuit, I received compensation for my repair.

Let me summarize my set-up: I receive analogue (not digital) cable signals, HD over the air, have an up-converting dvd player as well as an analogue DVD recorder and a VHS recorder, also analogue. I've used the set connections for HDMI, S- Video, Component and cable(RF).  There are also DVI and digital audio connections which I haven't used.HD picture at 1080p, 1080i, and 720p is great, as it should be. Purchased movies( I tested Star Wars) look outstanding via the up-converting DVD player and HDMI. Analogue is less great, of course, but I was pleasantly surprised that non-digital cable was quite clear and not as grainy or \"artifacty\" as I feared it would be.This set would be more than adequate for anyone transitioning from an analogue set-up to a pure digital one--as we all must, apparently.  It works great with analogue signals and, with 3 HDMI outputs, should be useful well into the digital future mandated by our overlords. . .For comparison, the picture seems as good as a similar sized plasma set, and, in my opinion, is superior to rear projection DLP's that I have seen.  On this set blacks are rendered dark black which I understand was a difficult feat for earlier LCD screens.Cons, such as they are: The connections are all on the left side of the set.  If your input devices are on the right end of your media center, as are mine, buy longer cables because 6' ones will probably be too short. HDMI cables seem particularly prone to easing themselves loose, so you will want some slack in the connections. Amazon sells longer versions of all the types.The only other negative I  can see is that this model has a reflective (shiny) screen.  If you have a bright light source in front of the screen, such as a lamp or a window behind the viewers, I can see that reflections could be a problem.  I have lamps well off to the sides of my set, and one positioned behind where the viewers are.  That lamp does reflect somewhat and I tend to turn it off when watching movies when the other room lighting is lowered.Sound:  Built-in speakers are OK for 90% of TV watching. I have an antiquated amplifier/receiver that I use to drive a small center speaker and four bookshelf speakers for movies.  The set has a digital output and one set of RCA sound outputs.  If you already have  or wanted a proper surround sound set-up, the LNT4065 should be up to the task given the right amplifier/speaker combination.As far as buying a TV over the web, believe me, I had my doubts.  I have to say my experience was quite good.  The set was delivered by Eagle Delivery and that was painless.  They set up a delivery timeframe, the driver called and gave me 30 minutes notice before he showed up, and he unpacked and did the initial checks to see that the set was working. I would definitely buy another big-ticket item this way.

The Samsung 4065 always seemed to have the best picture.  Amazon had the best price anywhere plus free shipping.  The set was delivered by CEVA (formerly American Eagle) on 2/1, within the delivery window they gave.  The delivery man had the set out of the box, placed on my stand and working in about five minutes.  (Only one delivery person was necessary to move the new TV, while I needed two men and a boy to move the old 32\" Sony out of the way).  The Samsung picture was awesome right from the start.  The connections for a DVD player, VCR and powered speaker system were easily accomplished.  I am completely satisfied with the 4065.  The HD channels (from Comcast cable) are stunning and the standard definition channels, viewed in 16:9 format look better than they did on the standard def. TV with digital cable.  I have experienced no glare problems, even with the sun shining on the screen.  The glossy black finish looks great; certainly no distraction.  My only hesitation with the 4065 was whether I should go for the 4071 model with the 120 Hz refresh rate.  I had read the reviews about improvement of fast action scenes with the 120 Hz model.  If there is some problem with the 60 Hz 4065 model, I can't see it.  I put on the NHL game that aired before the Superbowl on 2/3.  I can't imagine any faster action than that and I did not see any problem.Needless to say, seeing the Superbowl in HD made the Giants victory even sweeter.

I bought it at 1400 and with amazons post price guarantee ended up paying 1269. Eagle shipping was fine, it arrived 5 days early, the guy came on time and unpacked it for me. I personally have HD cable hooked up through component (it actually looks better with component, go figure), and an XBOX 360 and PS3 hooked up through HDMI. I thought that the out of the box settings Movie, Standard, and Dynamic were okay, buy Im not content with just okay. After about a week of tweaking with the picture, I can say that I have gotten the best picture possible out of my 3 sources, in my humble opinion. Out of the box you dont get a very deep black level, so my main goal was to find a median between black level and vivid colors. On HD cable at 1080i the HD channels are good (blu-ray has spoiled me), with some HD channels having a better picture than others, especially HD theatre and TNT HD. Standard def is tolerable, it is blurry, buy there is no annoying noise like Ive seen on other tvs. 1080p gaming on this tv with XBOX 360 and PS3 (Skate, Ridge Racer 7) is amazing, especially Skate on XBOX 360 which has the best graphics I have ever seen on a video game. Now for blu-ray, for which I must say that fantastic is an understatement. When I first popped in Spiderman 3 in 1080p I was totally in awe. It was just like looking through a window, vivid colors, amazing detail, you can hold your head 3 inches from the screen and It is still better than watching a regular DVD from 10 feet away. So far the blu-ray I have watched with the most amazing PQ is Eragon, which was just sharper and more realistic (besides the dragon) than any other movie I have seen.  As far as the tv's sound goes, It has been okay the few times I have listened, but what do you expect from built in speakers? I use a surround sound system and I recommend that anyone buy a tv like this shell out the extra few hundred to get one too.  For those of you who are debating between this and the 71F, I must tell you that after seeing it in BB and CC, that on it's main selling point, 120Hz, for regualar TV shows, there is not much of a difference from other regular tvs. However when turned on on a blu-ray or any other 24Hz signal, I makes a huge difference that anyone would be able to notice. The only way I can really describe it is to say that it turns films into a soap opera, but just about the most intensely smooth video tape soap opera imaginable. I personally think that it looks really, really weird, and I dont like the effect, thus my purchase of this tv. Before you purchase, you should go into the store and see for yourself how it looks. I dont like it mainly because I am used to 24, 30, and 60Hz, and I think also that part of the experience that makes a film a film instead of video tape is the lag between some frames, and when you take that away, it just doesn't look like a film anymore. I havent been able to compare the 71F and 65F side by side in a dark room, so I can't say if the 25K vs. 15K contrast makes a huge difference or what, so you just have to guess when buying or find someone who has compared like CNet or something.

This Samsung blows away everything we have in stock, from 61\" plasmas to 17\" LCD monitors. The 1080p technology is definitely the way to go, and look at the contrast ratio-that should tell you the story. When we play HD and Blue Ray movies on this thing you have to see it to believe it.  My son's PS3 plays Blue Ray games without any ghosting or hesitations-just like a computer monitor. The speakers are actually good quality, but for some reason Samsung has them pointing down and back, not forward (???). Don't know why. No matter, I am setting up a cheap amp with separate side speakers anyway. There are complete controls for the screen on the remote unit. The TV looks beautiful and graces any room; the soft, blue glow light when on is a nice touch. We watch this in our family room even during the day and do not have to shut the blinds on our windows. For performance, aesthetics and sound you won't do better than this. And I have seen thousands of them through the years.By the way, just as a side thought; I suggest ordering extra cables through Amazon at the same time. I only paid a couple of bucks each for them.  Also - there is a lot of confusion out there about antennas. If you have a roof antenna already mounted, try that before purchasing another. I am currently using an indoor antenna and the picture is perfect. Do not be deceived by marketing hype, such as \"Hi-Definition, High Performance antenna\" etc. at inflated prices. It's just hype. There is no such thing as a \"Hi-Definition\" antenna, all are based on the same technical principles. Yes, there are some antennas that are superior in quality to others because of the way they are engineered, but that has nothing to do with the type of signal they will pull in.  Try what you have now before purchasing a new one, most likely you will be pleasantly surprised and save yourself some money.The delivery service was outstanding.

Thousands of these sets have failed around the world, it's bad capacitors. Sammy did the typical Korean manufacturer procedure and bought the lowest-priced capacitors with no concern for quality and now they are failing in a large number of their TVs. I fixed this myself but it involves dismantling the set and replacing four (4) capacitors on the power supply circuit board. $4 of parts and 1.5 hours of labor time and the set is back up and running, at least until the next problem arises (rolls eyes).

Plus the extensive reviews here versus C-Net, Best Buy and Circuit City gave me a lot more G2 for the choice.  Also, I wanted the lower height and wider speaker placement for my entertainment center (allowing more shelf space above) and sound quality versus the 4066 offered from Best Buy (same electronics, just different chassis and placement of speakers) AND of course $400 cheaper.The tracking info via Amazon just comes from Eagle and they don't offer much.  They scheduled delivery 8-10 days after the order.  In tracking each day, I noticed it moved from \"somewhere\" to Reno after only 2 days.  Great, it's moving.  Then it shows it moving from Reno to LA after 5 days.  Then the arrival date to LA was 6 days, then 7 days.  What's is going on, here?!  Finally, on the 8th day (in the delivery window, now), I called them and scheduled delivery on the final day.  1-5PM was the target as I would be out on a biz trip and back that afternoon.  The night before they called my wife and asked for a pull-up to 11AM-1PM (when does this ever happen), she says OK and I told her not to worry because of the \"White Glove\" treatment.  Well they show up at 10AM, she gets home at 10:30AM and they're waiting.  Understand that White Glove treatment means they take it out of the box.  They didn't power it up, attach cables or move any other components around.  In fact, they were out in less than 10 minutes.  It was OK by me since I prefer to do the setup myself but surprising given the praise for the White Glove treatment in previous reviews.The TV itself was EASY to setup.  The default channels are fine and did not require any tweaking although you do have to adjust the picture size depending on the DVDs used (4:3 or widescreen format).  TV automatically senses the input from the Cable Box.  I got a new one from Time-Warner Cable and it's horrible - the Scientific Atlanta 8300HD.  I called TWC and they acknowledge that the channel changing station to station is SLOW - the screen blanks out and sometimes does not acquire at all.  I know it's the box because I directly connected the Cable for initial tune and the tuner in the set is quick.  One quick call to TWC confirmed this.  Customer service rep acknowledged that the box is slow and blamed the FCC for this - saying that TWC had to \"rush\" a new box to market to allow Cable Card upgrade path (whatever this means).  Anyways, TWC tech will visit next week and she credited me with 1 week of cable service.The price protection is REAL.  I ordered it at $1624 and 5 days later it dropped to $1520.  I used the customer contact link (try the instant call feature - you punch in a number on line and your phone will ring in less than 5 seconds - I kid you not).  I explained and they agreed to credit me $104.  3 days later it dropped to $1489, so I did it again and got a credit for $31.  I will do this up until 30-days from purchase date.In summary, the TV is excellent.  I was originally thinking Sony as I have a 2001 27\" CRT and a 2005 34\" HDTV (this must way 250lbs) and was going to go again, but seeing and reviewing Samsung convinced me that Sony has taken a step back and Samsung a step up in TVs.  The price from Amazon cannot be beaten by Sears, CC, BB but understand you might wait 8-10 days for delivery.  Eagle delivery gets you the TV, unpacks it and that's it.  The main limitation on the TV would be on the source for video, whether it's your DVD (I have standard, not Blu-Ray or HD-DVD - yet), VCR or Cable provider (Direct TV in my future?).Thanks, Amazon.", "Date": "September 2, 2007"}, {"Title": "Excellent HD/TV", "Author": "Joan Ripple", "ReviewID": "RBKBV4E75ZP9R", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "There is not one negative thing to say about this outstanding hi def/high pixel TV....color is outstanding....it is everything we hoped it would be.", "Date": "August 29, 2007"}, {"Title": "GREAT TV", "Author": "Marty G.

These settings have a great view on the TV. Try and see if it makes an improvement on your set as well. BTW: I love this TV. Has a great picture and is a pleasant viewing experience. You can't go wrong with this TV, especially if you buy it on AMAZON. Best price anywhere.Please try these settings at Backlight from 0-10 and Contrast from 85-100 and let me know what you think. I used Backlight 10 and Contrast 100 for awhile in a lighted room. Recently I've had Backlight at 9 and Contrast at 88 - easier on the eyes, darker blacks, and highlights are less intense/washed out. Norse and others use Backlight 4 and Contrast 85 for a more subdued, movie-like setting that's good in darker rooms.Notes: This calibration produces excellent black detail without sacrificing dark blacks. I like a little pop so I have set \"Dynamic Contrast\" to \"Low\" after calibration.Firmware Versions: The green gain changed in firmware 1032 and above, see \"G-Gain\" in the \"White Balance\" settings below for details.Movie Mode vs Standard Mode: Sept 15th - I've added a calibration for Standard Mode (HDMI only; firmware 1032 and above) after the Movie Mode settings below. You can set up your TV to be properly calibrated in both modes but with slightly different settings (eg Dynamic Contrast \"Off\", a lower Backlight/Contrast, or different gamma) in one of them and then easily switch back and forth between them depending on the content.Oct 16th - I now prefer the Standard Mode settings - they seem very slightly less green on skin tones than the Movie Mode settings. I've also upped my Backlight from 8 to 10.Nov 10th - I upped the Pink control to 21 on Movie mode settings and that seems to have fixed the skin tones. Also, as noted above, recently I've put the Backlight down to 9 and Contrast at 88.Calibration stats: I used HCFR with a DTP-94 colorimeter to do the calibration.For Backlight 8 and Contrast 100 over HDMI, average Gamma is 2.21; color temperature is 6500 +214 / -143 except at IRE 10 where it climbs to 7288; Delta E is mostly under 3; minimum black is 0.29 and maximum white is 375.84; contrast ratio (with Dynamic Contrast Off) is 1296:1. Look at the first attached JPG to see graphs of the calibration from HCFR at Backlight 8 and Contrast 100.For Backlight 4 and Contrast 85 over HDMI, average Gamma is 2.16; color temperature is 6500 +318 / -189 except at IRE 10 where it climbs to 8005; Delta E is under 3 at 30 IRE and above; minimum black is 0.20 and maximum white is 176.69; contrast ratio (with Dynamic Contrast Off) is 883:1. Look at the second attached JPG to see graphs of the calibration from HCFR at Backlight 4 and Contrast 85.Component vs HDMI inputs: The Movie Mode settings below were developed for HDMI inputs but work well also for Component inputs; I have noted any changes for Component in the settings below. If you are using a Component input, you can skip the sections below on how to set up your Cable box / DVD, PS3, XBox, etc.I have not done Component settings for Standard Mode.Cable box / DVD setting: Set your cable box or DVD player to put out RGB over HDMI if possible. If the box is not putting out RGB, you will know because the TV setting for HDMI Black Level will be grayed out. The settings should still work ok but use RGB if possible, it seems to work better with the Dynamic Contrast \"Low\" setting. Do not set your cable box or DVD player to put out a \"Full\" or \"Enhanced\" RGB range (as this will lead to blacks being too dark, or \"crushed\"), unless you also set the TV's HDMI Black Level to \"Normal\" instead of \"Low\". Play around with it. If your settings look \"crushed\", set HDMI Black Level to \"Normal\". Another alternative which works very well is to use the Component outputs of your device and apply the modifications to the settings listed below for Component.PS3 Setting: When using a PS3, set the PS3 as follows (per this advice from WilliamG):Output - Y Pb/Cb Pr/CrRGB Full Range - LimitedY Pb/Cb Pr/Cr Super-White - OnFor games, set HDMI Black Level - LowXBox 360 Setting: When using a 360 with these settings, either 1) set the 360 to \"Standard\" and set the TV's HDMI Black Level to \"Low\" as specified below; or 2) set the XBox to \"Expanded\" and set the TV's HDMI Black Level to \"Normal\". If you don't use one of these two settings the shadows will be screwed up.nwhiteside suggested to me that for XBox over VGA, its best to set the XBox to \"Expanded\".VGA Setting: When using VGA, be sure to go into the Setup menu and set Home Theater PC to \"On\" - this will allow you to get into the \"Detailed Settings\" menu.Movie Mode settings for HDMI and Component:PictureMode MovieContrast 85-100 (85 if you have a dark room and/or like subdued settings, 100 if you like a lot of \"pop\" or the room is well-lit)Brightness 44 (46 for Component)Sharpness 20 (0 for Component)Color 50Tint 50Backlight 0-10 (4 if you have a dark room and/or like subdued settings, 8-10 if you like a lot of \"pop\" or the room is well-lit)Color Tone Warm1Digital NR AutoDetailed SettingsBlack Adjust OffDynamic Contrast LowGamma -1Color Space AutoEdge Enhancement OnxvYCC OffWhite BalanceR-Offset 21G-Offset 20B-Offset 21R-Gain 0G-Gain 19 (21 for firmware versions below 1032)B-Gain 26My Color ControlPink 21 (17 for Component)Green 15Blue 15White 15SetupEnergy Saving OffHDMI Black Level Low (will be grayed out if the input is Component or if your HDMI video source is putting out a YCbCr signal instead of RGB - this is OK but RGB may be better as noted above)Standard Mode settings for HDMI (firmware 1032 and above):PictureMode StandardContrast 85-100 (85 if you have a dark room and/or like subdued settings, 100 if you like a lot of \"pop\" or the room is well-lit)Brightness 44Sharpness 20Color 50Tint 50Backlight 0-10 (4 if you have a dark room and/or like subdued settings, 8-10 if you like a lot of \"pop\" or the room is well-lit)Color Tone NormalDigital NR AutoDNIe On (important - otherwise Detailed Settings will be grayed out)Detailed SettingsBlack Adjust OffDynamic Contrast LowGamma -1Color Space AutoEdge Enhancement OnxvYCC OffWhite BalanceR-Offset 21G-Offset 22B-Offset 24R-Gain 17G-Gain 18B-Gain 5My Color ControlPink 15Green 15Blue 15White 15SetupEnergy Saving OffHDMI Black Level Low (will be grayed out if your HDMI video source is putting out a YCbCr signal instead of RGB - this is OK but RGB may be better as noted above)", "Date": "December 17, 2007"}, {"Title": "Best LCD TV until now!!", "Author": "Dong Su Kwak \"nicky95\"", "ReviewID": "R2YT2PI9KUKZI5", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "To buy LCD TV, I reserached many and read reviews.

Over the last weeks it developed a serious problem and won't turnon after a couple of minutes. At least two restarts are necessary, and eventually the TV is up and running normally. Furthermore, dead pixels are all over the screen at the first start, then completely disappear after a restart. At least one restart is necessary (power off and on) to get rid of the bad pixels.It is becoming more serious each day with more and more delays to power on the TV while multiple clicks are hearable (from the relay) when the TV fails to turn. I searched the internet and found many complaints about this technical issue effecting many Samsung TVs not only this specfic one. This is obviously a general problem, and the reason is reported to be some defective power supply module capacitors dying only after a couple of months in use. The Samsung customer service seems to have no interest solving the issues, and I heard about a lawsuit out there against Samsung. So be alert, if you consider to buy an expensive Samsung TV as it might only work for a couple of months and it may take weeks for the customer service to come and fix the TV as reported elsewhere. If you are proficient in electronics you might buy the right capacitor(s) and may be able to fix the power module by yourself. But who likes to do this or is comfortable enough to solder parts in and out from a circuit board especially when the warranty is still in place.It is very disappointing that a modern TV dies or needs a hardware fix after only 1-3 years usage.Try to buy a different make, but avoid Samsung.Anyway, I can only warn every potential Samsung TV customer to be aware of this problem.UPDATE: I have to update my comment about the Samsung customer service. I called it on a Sunday and was surprised to get through a real representative immediately. The service was very good since two days later I had a technician coming into my house and fixing the capacitors (4) within an hour. I had to pay no service charges even with the warranty expired. The TV works now normally, no issues with powering up. Samsung is very well aware of the capacitor problems, so they fix the TVs without charges on a case-to-case basis.At least I consider this as a good service. Maybe newer Samsung TVs will not have the problem with capacitors made from a different vendor (?). The technician said that the replacement capacitors have a lifetime of several years.Now that the TV is running normally, the quality of the picture is excellent as usual which would deserve 5 stars on its own, if there would no be the problem with the short lifetime, which is serios enough for a high-prized TV.", "Date": "November 7, 2010"}, {"Title": "Great TV and outstanding response when repair was necessary", "Author": "D.

I bought this TV May12, 2007 and the extended warranty thru Amazon.  The TV is now beginning to fail (Feb 2009).  When I turn it on, it tries to turn on, then turns off, then turns on, etc. and when a picture finally appears, I can see whatever program is on but there are also little pink dots all over the screen.  If I turn the TV off, and turn it back on, it comes on without recycling on and off like it does initially, and the little pink dots are gone.  Today the pink dots were replaced by a solid screen of colored lines.  Turned the TV off and on again and got a good picture.  When I bought the TV from Amazon, I also bought the extended 4yr warranty.  I called N.e.w. today and a service rep is coming next week.  I paid a lot of money for this TV in 2007.  The new model of Samsung that is comparable to this TV is now only $900 give or take.  I paid $1800.  So hopefully, this will turn out well and the extended service contract will prove to be worthwhile.  I plan on re-reviewing along my journey.Followup: The technician just left. It was the power board that was failing progressively. I had the extended warranty with NEW and the first company they set me up with never showed. I called and asked for a different repair company that was closer geographically to my home. They then set me up with Falcones Electronics in Media Pa. They diagnosed the problem over the phone based on my description of what was happening, ordered the power board, and then just came this morning and installed it. My LCD is better than new now. The power board failure got worse over time until it got to the point that the TV would just not turn on. So if you see it getting worse (starts out as pink dots, then stripes, then won't turn on), it's the power board. They told me that without the warranty, it would have run me about $350 to fix. So I'm pleased that the warranty turned out to be a good investment and I'm once again very pleased with this TV.  The technician told me that the failure rate on new electronics is about 3% so it's rare.  Nonetheless, mine failed but was easily fixed.  I paid $1800 for this TV just shy of 2 yrs ago and around $300 for the extended warranty with NEW through Amazon.  Despite the initial glitch with NEW and the first company not showing up, not only do I have my TV back and working, I've also now discovered a great little electronics shop for anything else I might need done.

My eyes could not tell the difference except on a 52'' Samsung 120 ghz model.  Spider Man on the 52'' looks artificial.  Personally, I prefer the regular 60ghz HDTV.I am really impressed with the resolution and how easy the TV is to set up. The manual is clear, and the different settings of the TV is easy to adjust. Upgrade to the latest firmware was hassle free.  I simply used my USB flash drive and followed the simple steps on Samsung's website.I really like the swivel stand. I could make adjustment to the viewing angle just by gently pushing the either sides of the TV.  The blue light below the Samsung logo has the option to be turned off. The overall feel of the TV is excellent with the blue light on.To test the slide show feature, I upload some files into my flash USB stick. I plug the memory stick in, and the slide show option is up. Samsung does not automatically adjust the pictures to fit the screen. I wish the TV could provide the options that are found in Windows Display on my computer.  My idea is to use the TV as a giant photo display.  It still can be done, but I just need to use my laptop and a photo viewing program. FastStone Viewer is free to download from [...].I use a regular VGA cord to connect my laptop to the TV. The resolution is 1920x1080, and the display is beautiful. Movies look excellent on my new Samsung.  As a computer monitor, I love the rich and detailed feedbacks of the TV.  I highly recommend this TV to anyone.Edit: 40'' is an overkill for PC monitor use. My neck gets tired from tilting slightly upward and it's just WAY too big to use it up close for too long. I've read reviews about 30'' high resolution Dell monitors.  30'' or 32'' are enough to fill the peripheral vision and anything over would require head movement. I'm going to get either a Sony or LG led 32'' as my next PC monitor. Another bonus about 32'' or anything under 40'' is portability.

One primary objective for me was to use the TV as an HTPC (Home Theatre PC) monitor, but also having enough backend hookups for the eventual HD-DVD players and next-gen game consoles.  Excellent price drop, too - Thanks Amazon!I was not disappointed with the PC hookup.  Even with just a VGA cable, once I set my PC to 1080p resolution, the images were flawless.  The display was crystal clear, and the color was impeccable.  The only slight complaint I have is the brightness of the HTPC Mode in the settings, which -- don't get me wrong -- makes the image look AWESOME, but the brightness of the TV in general starts to strain my eyes after a while.  I find even the \"energy saver mode\" works well enough to leave it on.By the way, the 15000:1 Contrast is a marketing gimmick, and I think the buyer of large expensive TVs need to go out and do some market research to actually SEE the TV up close.  I personally LOVE the glossy screen over the 4061 Matte version, and yes, the polarized screen really does make a difference in creating better contracts -- assuming you minimize the light directing shining on the TV to reduce the glare.  I barely notice any glares anyways.A great bonus is the ability to switch from different modes and still retraining the settings (see AVS Forum's infamous \"thread 1500\" on color adjustments).  I can adjust the PC mode in one setting, but switch to normal \"Dynamic\" mode for watching movies.  The menu control can be a bit cumbersome at times to page through lots of options, but once everything is set there should be little need to touch the menus.All in all, the quality of the TV is expected.  No dead pixels out of the box, and the casing construction is beautifully done.  I can't wait to put this on the wall!One more thing, as some people have complained about the shipping services...Eagle is Amazon's preferred carrier on large electronics, and all shipping services hiccup once in a while.  I monitor the shipment info from Amazon's website, and actually called Eagle 3 days before to double check the address and set a delivery window.  All standard fare, and my TV got here a day before it was promised.  The delivery personnel were very careful.

Like so many others, I researched and researched until I finally made my mind up to get this one.  Many of the consumer reviews helped me to make up my mind, so thanks to you all - especially those who were very specific.I was looking for a 40 - 42\" LCD or plasma.  I had narrowed it down to Sony, Sharp and Samsung based on reviews, specs, price and what I saw with my own eyes in the stores.  I was trying to wait for the prices to drop below $1000 but I couldn't wait anymore, after I got my Wii for Christmas, I HAD to have an HDTV.  Getting this set for $1300 and free shipping vs. $1900 +tax(6%) +delivery(~$75+) at Circuit City seemed like a great deal to me!  I had no problems whatsoever from order to delivery.  EGL called to deliver the TV and set it up for me when they came.  I was initially concerned that the TV looked more glossy than it had in the picture because my room is pretty bright but once the TV was turned on, there was hardly any glare at all.  I have 3 windows ranging from 5-8ft diagonally from the TV and a good amount of sun comes in early in the day.  I can leave the closest 2 windows open with no glare but I do have to close the third, farthest blind.  The pic is beautiful and bright, even with regular cable input.Two things I've found peculiar ...1. I got an HD/DVR box from Comcast and the pic on the SDTV cable channels seemed to degrade from before.  This may be due to Comcast's box, not the TV.  I set the screen seletion to \"Just Scan\" to automatically adjust as I change channels from SD to HD (at least I think that is what it is for) and I keep seeing this line at the top of the screen.  It goes away if I change the setting.2. This one I can't figure out ... I had to turn the sound up above 50 just to get a decent sound from the set when I was still using my SDTV (RCA cables) cable hook up.  Once I upgraded to HD/DVR (w/HDMI cable), the sound was fine around 25-30.  How can the input have an impact on the sound from my set??  When I watch DVDs, I channel it through my Onkyo receiver and don't use the TV sound at all.Anyway, I think I made a great choice and I am VERY pleased overall.", "Date": "January 29, 2008"}, {"Title": "Eagle Delivery (and the TV) Rock", "Author": "Miguel Colon \"Michael in Benicia\"", "ReviewID": "RK7RT8UPWNSDX", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I'll offer a review on the TV later, but wanted to address Eagle Delivery's service, as a number of reviewers expressed dissatisfaction.I placed the order on Sunday January 20th, and the TV was delivered on Friday January 25th.

At first, I thought I had to live with poor reception from the standard broadcast signals but once I found out that there is free digital signals that I can receive, the picture quality is great especially with 1080i signal resolution.Sports games are great in the Dynamic setting. This setting brightens up the picture and the colors are more vivid. News broadcasts from the station are very clear. I could see the pores and details on the anchor's faces. I was considering the LNT4061 and was staring at both at an electronics store. I couldn't tell the difference until after a few minutes of staring that I noticed the whites are whiter on the 4065 because of the higher contrast ratio. Never thought I would see any difference but finally did see it.The sound is not bad for a two speaker system. It does try and simulate the surround sounds. The TV accomodates a larger color space that I believe is capable from HDMI v1.3 specifications. This setting works in the Movie mode.One drawback so far is I could not use the remote for a Toshiba DVD player I got. I tried programming the remote but the DVD player won't turn on.

Even though other vendors were having sales, amazon's price (with shipping included) beat all others.I had done a lot of cnet research on TV's, and I decided that this would be the one for me.  I am completely happy.Look to other reviews for techie stuff.  In this review I'll just break down my main non-techie impressions.1) Allegedly glossy screen.  This was my only reservation initially.  Many reviewers found the gloss to be a distraction because it picked up a lot of glare.  I have not had any glare problems.  My TV is in a room with a huge window on the side and track lighting above.  When the TV is off, the gloss is like a mirror.  When the TV is on, however, the screen is bright enough that I don't see any glare.  The TV is much better for glare than my previous non flat panel TV.  I think that the convex glass from my old TV tended to pick up light from all over, whereas the flat panel does not.2) Picture.  The TV looks phenomenal with Comcast HD sports, movies, everything.  SD programming looks good too.  Most channels don't have pixellation problems in SD.  I don't have an HD disc player or game system, so I cannot comment on that front.  The preset picture settings all seemed a bit bright to me, but otherwise very accurate right out of the box.  I was prepared to buy a DVD kit to tune my TV picture, but I don't think that I need to at this point.3)  Sound.  The sound is great.  I don't futz with the presets (Movie, Standard, Speech, Music, etc.) and they seem to be OK.  Movie mode is a bit too bass heavy for speech, but great for action movies where words don't so much matter.  The TV has a feature to play mp3 files etc. from a USB drive.  The software sucks and doesn't read half of my mp3's.  I can't knock the TV for this problem, however, because I don't really care if my TV can play mp3 files.4) Connectivity.  I don't have many components yet, so the number of connections is more than adequate.  The 3 HDMI connections seem to be sufficient for my fantasy set up with a next gen game system, next gen media disk player, and my cable box.  Right now my super old DVD player doesn't properly display through the component video connections.  Everything is red.  I am certain that this is a problem with the DVD player and not the TV.5) Delivery via Eagle USA (or whoever recently acquired Eagle USA).  These guys did a great job.  Their tracking sucks through Amazon, but if you go to their website, the tracking is fine.  You need to read the fine print in the Amazon confirmation email to see that you should call Eagle USA after a couple of days to arrange a delivery time.  The delivery guy took everything out of the box and had me turn everything on to make sure it worked.

HD content looks awesome, and SD looks good enough to not bother me.  I have some griping and nitpicking to do, though.- Switching inputs is slow.

The HD experience is breathtaking.  It also does a decent job on SD signals as well.  Even the audio quality is very good considering the speaker size. As far as viewing angle, the 178 degree angle listed in the specs is a bit overstated.  You can still watch it at that position, but the picture tends to \"wash out\" if you go to far from center.  Of course, that's the case with almost any LCD these days.  The on screen menu is very useful and the degree to which you can \"tweek\" various adjustments to your liking is amazing.  The 15000:1 contrast ratio is right up there with the plasmas without all the extra heat and added weight!  The USB port is great for firmware updates as well as reading JPG or MP3 files on a flash drive.  The 1080p provides for optimum use as a monitor for your computer as well.  The 3 HDMI inputs are handy for any extra \"gizmos\" you want to hook up, although the latest version of the firmware may need to be loaded if a certain device isn't recognized for some reason.  I've had absolutely no problem with \"clouds\" showing up when the screen is black, but that may not absolutely be the case with every set out there.  The Samsungs tend not to suffer from this as much as some other brands.  Amazon's price and service were excellent as usual.  All in all, the LN-T4065 is highly recommended!

Tietz", "ReviewID": "R1M340RXZ9RWE2", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "The only really annoying thing about this TV is that, between the time I ordered it and the time it arrived, Samsung introduced a newer model, but that's the nature of high technology, right? The picture looks great, and I get both the \"standard\" and high-definition versions (where they exist) of all the local (Denver, CO) channels and some not-so-local ones with a modest-size (Radio Shack $60) outdoor antenna and Channel Master rotor.A few things are minor irritations.First, there seems to be no way to add a channel to its channel list manually: it does a scan, and what it sees during the scan is all you get. In our area, different channels require pointing the antenna in different directions, so there is no single pointing that receives them all well. That means that, unless you wait for just the right viewing conditions, some channels will be left off the list. (You can always tell it go go to a particular channel if you want, but the \"up\" and \"down\" buttons on the control will not find it.) Of course, if you have cable or satellite TV, this will not be an issue, but I'm too cheap for that.Second, rendering of \"5.1\" sound on the built-in stereo speakers is not as convincing as the brochure implies. If you're into theater-quality sound, you'll want to add a home-theater sound system. So far my tin ears have not motivated me to spend the money.Those into games and fast-action movies and sports (like tennis rather than football) might want to consider the newly introduced 120-Hz refresh version instead. For what I watch, the slower 60-Hz refresh has not been an issue at all.But the bottom line is that I'm quite satisfied with both the product and Amazon's handling of the order. One nice thing about Samsung is that their Web site lets you download the entire instruction booklet (as a PDF document) for this TV or others they make so that you can review the controls, options, connections to other equipment, etc., before you decide.", "Date": "October 14, 2007"}, {"Title": "It's all good..", "Author": "Kevin", "ReviewID": "RSSTV7AUTDJQK", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Okay, I've had this tv for over a month now and i must say that I love it, I've had no problems at all.

I'm happy to report that for me, my HDMI issues are now gone after several weeks of use with zero flashes/drops etc.HOWEVER, it is still VERY possible to have a 1005 board with HDMI issues. The current official fix from Samsung is a 1008 board, with 1024-or-higher firmware. There ARE several people who claim to have issues with 1008/1024 combinations, but I firmly believe another replacement is therefore needed. I also firmly believe there are 1008/1024 problematic boards out there, and 1008/1024 working boards. So hang in there folks!(The bottom of this post explains the above numbers for the new people around these parts!)Update: June 23, 2007As fellow board member Sam Relishe has noticed, after a mainboard swap some of the settings might be wrong. I own an LN-T4661, and my replaced mainboard was set up for a LN-T4665. This meant the color palette was completely wrong (everything was red and orange and green), and I had a menu option to turn the blue light on and off (only the LN-T4x65 series has the blue light). The way to fix this is as follows:(Make sure to make a note of your picture calibration settings, as mine were reset after going into the service menu)With your TV off, press MUTE, 1, 8, 2, and then POWERThen, choose the OPTION BYTE.IMPORTANT: DO NOT MESS WITH ANY OTHER SETTINGS THAN THE ONES LISTED:Make sure the SCREEN SIZE is correct: Panel Option = 46AMW for LN-T4665 displays, and 46AM for LN-T4661 displays.Make sure that if you own an LN-T4x65 that your Lvds Tx Bit = 10bit.Make sure if you own an LN-T4x61 that your Lvds Tx Bit = 8bit.If you own an LN-T4x65, your should change your model so it says \"Tulip Side.\"If you own an LN-T4x61, you should change the model so it says \"Tulip.\"After changing these options, turn your TV off, and then on.Update: June 22, 2007One of our fellow AVS members, axmode, came across a way to check what firmware version you'll get, before you open the box! This might be a smart way to check before you buy the TV.To check what firmware version you haveThe 8th character in your S/N (pertinent to all 2007 LN-Txx6x models) is a letter P which stands for 2007. The 9th character which follows that letter P will be a number which denotes the months of assembly. For those of you who want to ensure having a 1024/1008 at the very least, that number should be a 6 at the very least (to be sure).Axmode verified this with his own S/Ns and the 4665 which went back was a P4 (1016/1004). The current 4061 is a P5 (1024/1008). This info may help those of you who are considering a purchase through a big box store, prior to opening up the sets.Thanks axmode!Update: June 21, 2007As of June Wednesday, June 20th, Tier 2 representatives at Samsung tech support have stated that the fix for ALL HDMI issues is a board replacement for those that do NOT have 1008 main boards with 1024 firmware. See the bottom of this post for instructions on how to check your version. Until we have confirmation from more people that this is the fix, this remains only SPECULATION on the part of the skeptical consumer. However, this is official and has been confirmed as the \"fix\" by several Tier 2 specialists.Update: June 18, 2007. Fellow forum member dkwong has compiled a spreadsheet so we can keep track of who has what TV, and what firmware information and issues they are having. Thanks dkwong!PLEASE send him any information you can so he can update his spreadsheet. You can view it here:Samsung SpreadsheetUpdate: June 15, 2007. 1028 is the latest firmware, with no confirmation of the HDMI issue being fixed.Update: June 1, 2007. How to use an XBOX 360 with the VGA cable, to resolve the \"Mode Not Supported\" message:1. Reset the resolution of the console to 640x480. To do this, start the console, hold both triggers, and then press and hold the Y button as the console starts.2. If this resolves the issue and you receive a picture on the display, you can continue to use the 640x480 resolution. Or you can try to use a higher resolution setting. If this does not resolve the issue, continue to the next step.3. Disconnect the VGA HD cable from the display, and then remove the console power cord from the power outlet.4. Wait five seconds.5. Reconnect the console power cord to the power outlet, and then turn on the console.6. Reconnect the VGA HD cable to the display. If this resolves the issue and you receive a picture on the display, you can continue to use the 640x480 resolution. Or you can try to use a higher resolution setting.1.) The entire 2007 Samsung 1080p LCD lineup is suffering from HDMI handshake issues. This is the LN-Txxxx line. This is not just video-game related, but reported units giving trouble include the Playstation 3, XBOX 360 Elite, HTPCs, and various STBs. Also reports from people with drops/flashes:\"Mac Mini (Intel); PowerMac G4 DP (with a Radeon 9xxx(?) video card); Denon 2910 - upscaling (1080i) DVD Playler (this a pure HDMI connection)\" - (courtesy of Ted Todorov)1.b.) These issues manifest themselves as dropouts (picture loss), momentary green or pink flashes etc. These may not happen for hours and hours, and then suddenly you can get hit with two or three flashes/dropouts in a short time. There appears to be no rhyme or reason to the issue.2.) Several tech people from Tier 1 and Tier 2 support said that Samsung ARE aware of the issue and are working to fix it. There is currently NO fix available.3.) Design issues:There are numerous reports of what is known as \"clouding\" or \"mura.\" Nobody knows exactly what causes this, but it manifests itself as blotches of lighter areas on the screen or in the corners (corners are also known as \"flashlights\").There are several reports of people wiping the area with a cloth from the cloud to the edge of the screen to remove the issue, but I can't verify this. To do this, grab a dry cloth and wipe the cloud fairly gently. If it moves, keep moving it!Please refrain from asking questions about clouds, as this post should cover it. I personally understand the frustration of having had really bad clouds, but it bogs down the thread to discuss it ad nauseam. If you can't clear the clouds, and they actually bother you, exchange your set at your vendor. It is possible to get a completely cloud-free set, but don't drive yourself crazy. If you can't notice them during \"normal\" viewing, you've nothing to worry about!3.b.) Another issue affecting these sets is something known as \"pillaring.\" I personally haven't seen pillaring but it is visible as bands of light on the left and right of the screen. Apparently this can be fixed by properly calibrating your set: i.e. turning down brightness/contrast/backlight to NORMAL levels. If you have this problem, adjust your settings. If this doesn't fix it, return the set to your vendor. At this point, I believe it's simply calibration issues.4.) Some forum members are recommending HDMI port savers to take the strain off their TV's HDMI ports from the heavy cable connecting to your devices. Some have even said it fixed the handshaking issues they've been having but this is NOT proven as of yet (I can say they didn't help for me at all). You plug the port saver into your TV, and then your actual HDMI cable into it. I can speak only for myself when I say that port savers did NOT fix the handshaking issue.To check your firmware version, here are the instructions:1. Turn on your TV.2. Press the MENU button on your remote.3. Select SETUP, and then press ENTER.4. Select Function Help, and then press ENTER.5. Use the Up or Down arrow button on your remote to move down to Function Help to ON, and then press the ENTER button.6. With Function Help ON highlighted (don't actually push ENTER on it), press the INFO button on the remote. Your firmware revision will be listed as two lines of information. The TOP line is your software firmware. The BOTTOM line is the hardware revision number.So, I have 1024 firmware (software), and 1004 hardware (mainboard).If I haven't had any problems should I bother trying to get samsung to upgrade my board/firmware from 1008/1028 to 1009/1029?The only reason to change would be if the 1009/1029s had somehting the 08s were lacking. Ie when CNET tested the 61/65 both failed 2 of their 1080i tests and introduced anomalies with certain scenes of movies. Samsung contacted them after and said they had fixed this in a new firmware, they didnt specify which one but if that fix is in the 09/29 and not the 8/28 then thats a reason to switch.\"It also behaves exactly the same as the 65F in our resolution tests--failing to resolve every detail of a 1080i test pattern, for example, and failing both of the Geek Box 1080i deinterlacing tests (although it passed the video test when in \"16:9\" as opposed to \"Just Scan\" mode) from the HQV HD DVD and Blu-ray discs. We didn't see any evidence of those failures in Apes, but we did find a scene in Ghost Rider, where the grille of the RV at the end of Chapter 6 evinced some diagonal moir\u00e9 along its horizontal grille. We don't consider failure at deinterlacing a deal-breaker for HDTV picture quality, although if you have access to 1080p content, we recommend choosing it to avoid the chance of seeing these sorts of artifacts.For what it's worth, Samsung sent us a firmware update that worked with both sets to fix the deinterlacing of video-based, but not film-based, 1080i content and to show every line of a 1080-resolution test pattern. \"Samsung LN-T4665FThe good:  Flat-panel LCD HDTV produces deep blacks with excellent shadow detail; accurate color after adjustment; clean image; solid off-angle viewing for an LCD; numerous picture controls; beautiful styling.The bad: Shiny screen collects excessive ambient light; edges slightly brighter than the middle in dark areas.The bottom line: Despite a shiny, reflective screen, the picture quality of the Samsung LN-T4665F exceeds that of any LCD we've tested so far.Editors' rating: 8.3 ExcellentThe image quality of the best flat-panel LCD HDTVs has improved with every generation, and Samsung's 2007 step-up model, the LN-T4665F, is irrefutable proof. To cut to the chase: in many ways it delivers the best picture we've seen yet from any LCD, and it compared well against the best plasmas on the market. Of course there's always some impurity in the ointment, and in this case it's the Samsung's shiny screen, which is the main reason why we didn't give the LN-T4665F our Editors' Choice award (update 06-19-07: We've also published a review of the LN-T4661F, which is very similar to this TV except that its screen is matte). But in the end we, too, liked shiny things, because the Samsung LN-T4665F outperformed other LCDs we've tested--including the latest models from Sony and Sharp--in a demanding, darkened home theater environment.DesignThe Samsung LN-T4665F is quite simply the shiniest TV we ever reviewed. The company's stylists went for pure, glossy black again this year, and for the first time the reflective gloss extends to the screen itself. The glossy frame is very attractive in its own right--we especially liked the rounded corners, smoothed-out planes, the subtly curved bottom edge, and the sleek, transparent speaker-sound deflectors that extend a quarter of an inch beyond the fuselage to either side. We also appreciated the trim swivel base, which allows the panel to be rotated about 20 degrees to either side.We don't appreciate the glossy screen, however. We assume the company chose a reflective screen coating, as opposed to the matte screens found on most LCDs, to attract attention in the store when the LN-T4665F is lined up next to the millions of other flat-panel sets. Unfortunately, the screen also attracts reflections from bright objects and lights in the room, which can detract from the picture.Including the stand, the LN-T4665F measures 43.6x12.8x30.2 inches. Without it, the panel measures 43.6x4.1x23.8 inches.Samsung's remote is almost the same as last year, and we generally found the slender wand easy to operate. Only the keys for volume, channel, and device control (the universal clicker can command four other pieces of gear) are illuminated, but that's better than most TV remotes, which skip backlighting altogether. All of the buttons are nicely separated and differentiated, with the exception of secondary controls clustered at the clicker's base, which kind of blend together. We'd like to see dedicated buttons for each input, but since the set automatically senses and skips inactive inputs, cycling between sources is less arduous than usual.FeaturesWith a native resolution of 1920x1080 pixels--popularly known as \"1080p\"--the Samsung LN-T4665F has enough pixels to resolve every detail of 1080i and 1080p HDTV sources, although it falls a bit short in real life (see Performance for more). All other sources, including 720p HDTV, DVD, computer and standard-def, are scaled to fit the pixels.The LN-T4665F is one of the first TVs with HDMI 1.3-compatible inputs, which have higher bandwidth than the older versions. In itself, that fact doesn't mean much, but the addition does enable the LN-T4665F to offer a menu selection labeled \"xvYCC,\" which refers to a wider color space that supposedly comes closer to human vision's capabilities than the current HDTV color space. Of course you'll need an HDMI 1.3-compatible source (the player and disc, for example), and as far as we know there isn't any xvYCC content available. In other words, we classify xvYCC and HDMI 1.3 inputs--at least as implemented on the LN-T4665F--as \"no big deal.\" The set's spec sheet also mentions 10-bit processing, but when we asked Samsung about it, they said that the panel itself doesn't deliver 10-bit color--just that the processing is capable of it. Extra bit depth can result in less false contouring, among other benefits, but like xvYCC color it requires a 10-bit source and display.As far as features that actually matter today, the LN-T4665F has an excellent selection of picture controls. It offers three picture modes that are each independent for each input, allowing you to customize each source with three different groups of picture settings. Only Movie mode allows full adjustment, however, so we recommend using it for the most demanding viewing conditions. In addition to the standard brightness and contrast sliders, there's a full-fledged backlight control, which is also independent per input.In addition to the five presets for color temperature, there's a full set of detailed color temperature controls. Labeled \"White Balance,\" they offer both gain and offset adjustments for red, green, and blue, allowing slightly more-advanced users to really zero in on the set's grayscale. The \"My Color\" control, on the other hand, doesn't seem to do much of anything, so we left it in the default positions. The selection of secondary picture controls includes items labeled Black Level, which affects shadow detail; Dynamic Contrast, which adjusts black level on the fly; Gamma, which affects the rate of progression from dark to light; and a selection for Color Gamut, which controls the range of colors the display can reproduce. See Performance for more details.We appreciated the solid range of aspect ratio controls, which include four choices for HD sources. Just Scan is the mode best suited for 1080i and 1080p sources, because it introduces no overscan and displays the image with no scaling. Standard-def sources allow four choices as well, including two zoom modes you can adjust vertically, to see subtitles or obscure tickers, for example. The set also includes a picture-in-picture feature to display two channels or sources at once.Like more and more 2007 HDTVs, the Samsung LN-T4665F offers three HDMI inputs as opposed to just two. Two are located on the back, while a third can be found in a recessed bay along the panel's left side. The Samsung's commendable connectivity continues with a pair of component-video inputs, an AV input with S-video, two RF inputs for cable and antenna, and a VGA-style RGB input for computers (maximum resolution 1920x1080). That recessed bay on the side offers an additional AV input with S-video, as well as a USB port that can interface with thumbdrives to display photos (JPEG only) and play music (MP3 only).PerformanceSimply put, in a darkened room the Samsung LN-T4665F is the best-performing LCD-based HDTV we've tested yet. We specify \"darkened\" because of its screen's reflective coating, which according to our nonscientific observation reflects even more light than that of a glass plasma screen. It's basically a dark mirror. If you're setting this TV up in a room where you can't totally control the light that hits the screen, we recommend looking for an LCD with a standard matte screen, or a plasma with proven glare-reducing properties, like Panasonic's TH-PX77U series. If ambient light isn't a concern, then the Samsung LN-T4665F offers picture quality that compares favorably with the best plasmas. Consequently, it's the first LCD TV we've reviewed to earn a performance score of \"8.\"We began our evaluation, as usual, by adjusting the Samsung's picture controls for optimum performance in our completely dark home theater. We really appreciated the set's excellent array of adjustments, including the fine-tuning for color temperature. We were able to improve the default Warm2 color temperature preset significantly (see the Geek Box below), although the final grayscale wasn't quite as accurate as we'd like to see. It varied a bit too widely in darker areas, although it was still much closer to the 6599K ideal than most LCDs we've tested. For our complete picture settings, which result in peak light output of about 40 footlamberts, check out our Tips & Tricks section.To get an idea of the Samsung's real-world performance, we watched Hulk on HD DVD played from the Toshiba HD-XA2 at 1080i resolution. By way of comparison, we lined the LN-T4665F up next to a trio of like-size flat-panels: the HP LC4776N 1080p LCD, the aforementioned Panasonic TH-50PX77U plasma, and our oft-cited reference display, the Pioneer PRO-FHD1 plasma.Let's get one thing out of the way now. The only flat-panel LCD sets we've seen that produce a deeper shade of black than the Samsung LN-T4665F are the Sharp LC-52D92U and LC-46D62U, which have other problems of their own. Hulk is a pretty dark film, especially in the beginning, and it served to illustrate the Samsung's black-level performance very well. During the scene when the green monster trashes the office, for example, the darkest shadows, the night sky above the building, and the black paint of the police car were all a bit darker than the other displays. Update 05-22-2007: We originally wrote that the Panasonic beat the Samsung by a hair in terms of procing the deepest black level, but actually the reverse is true. After rea-adjusting the two slightly, the Samsung produced a slightly deeper black level than the Panaosnic, although again the difference would be difficult to discern outside of a side-by-side comparison.Shadow detail is an area where LCD almost always takes a back seat to plasma, but the LN-T4665F held its own. We set the adjustable gamma control to -3, which preserved all of the detail in shadows and yet provided the shallowest, most realistic rise out of black, meaning that near-black details weren't overly bright. We saw evidence of this when looking closely at the shadowed shape of Hulk as he stands behind the tree outside Jennifer Connelly's cabin; we could barely make out the definition of his muscles in the light, whereas the HP didn't show the same detail and the Panasonic was a bit too bright, with a somewhat unrealistic rise out of black.Color accuracy on the Samsung was also commendable overall. When Connelly visits Nick Nolte in his shack, for example, the extreme close-ups of her face were rendered quite realistically, and we could see variations in skin coloration from her forehead down to her cheeks and chin. Looking at the Pioneer, our reference for color, revealed slightly less-saturated colors than on the Samsung, but the difference wasn't drastic. Primary colors and color decoding were also quite accurate on the LN-T4665F, and combined with the set's mostly solid grayscale performance they led to the best color we've seen on any flat-panel LCD.The Samsung also delivered an exceedingly clean image. The twilight sky above Nolte's shack provided a good example -- we saw far more moving motes of noise in those areas than we did on the Panasonic, for example, although the Pioneer was about equal. We complained of false contouring on some Samsung LCDs last year but the LN-T4665F was as good as any other display we've tested in producing smooth gradations between shadows and light.Screen uniformity was somewhat below that of the best LCDs we've tested, however. The most noticeable issue was the excessive brightness of the left and right sides of the screen compared to the middle, which was most visible in flat fields (45 IRE or lower) especially in the darkest fields. In program material--for example, the shots of Nolte in his shadowy shack--we noticed the edges of the display were a tiny bit brighter than the middle. There were other, irregular and much more subtle brightness variations in dimmer fields, but they weren't as noticeable, even in bright fields like the desert under the speeding helicopters. When seen from off-angle, the Samsung's screen maintained a relatively solid picture, not becoming discolored, and washing out significantly less than other LCDs we've tested. Of course, the darker parts of the Samsung's picture did wash out quite a bit more than those of the plasmas.Like any 1080p HDTV should, the Samsung handled 1080p sources, both at the standard 60 and the less-common 24 frames per second -- although like most sets it can't change its scan rate, so the benefits of using 1080p/24, if any, will be lost. We also checked the LN-T4665F's ability to resolve a 1080i test pattern from our Sencore VP403, and surprisingly it fell just short (most 1080p LCDs we've seen pass this test with aplomb), although it did resolve every line of the Sencore's 1080p pattern via HDMI. According to HQV on HD DVD and Blu-ray, the Samsung also failed to properly de-interlace 1080i content for display on its 1080p screen. (Update 06-04-2007: For those who want to assure proper de-interlacing of video-based, 1080i/30 material, we found that setting the aspect ratio to \"16:9\" as opposed to \"Just Scan\" will cause the Samsung to pass that test). How much do these failings with 1080i matter? Judging from the incredibly sharp image of Hulk, which appeared every bit as detailed as on the Pioneer (which passes all of these tests), not much. Of course, sticklers with access to 1080p content will want to use it with the LN-T4665F.(Update 6-20-07) Samsung has sent us a firmware update that worked with this set and the LN-T4661F to fix the deinterlacing of video-based, but not film-based, 1080i content and to show every line of a 1080-resolution test pattern. (This update is not reflected in our Geek Box results.) We originally reported here that the firmware update would be available as a download from Samsung's web site. Now we hear from the company that the update may instead only be available to owners who call the Service Center and ask to have it sent. We'll update this section again when we're told more. New TVs equipped with the updated firmware will arrive on store shelves, according to Samsung, by mid- to late July 2007.We also checked out the Samsung's ability to handle standard-def sources, and the results were mostly mediocre. The set was able to resolve every detail of the DVD format according to the color bars pattern from the HQV disc, but it had trouble smoothing out the jagged edges of rotating diagonal lines, and along the stripes of a waving American flag. The four noise reduction settings did a progressively better job of removing random motes of snowy noise from the disc's low-quality sunsets and shots of skies, but as usual there was a trade-off and details were softened somewhat as we increased NR. The Auto setting didn't really work well to automatically adjust the NR, especially in the \"motion-adaptive\" scenes with the roller-coaster, so we recommend choosing one of the manual modes when you'd like to fight the noise. The LN-T4665F did engage 2:3 pull-down quickly and accurately.We also checked out the Samsung's performance as a computer monitor, and like most 1080p flat-panel LCDs, it was very good. Using DisplayMate software via the VGA input--we didn't test compatibility with DVI/HDMI PC sources --the set resolved every line of vertical resolution and nearly every line of horizontal resolution with our video card set to 1920x1080 output. As a result, we detected a slight bit of softness in PC text at font sizes smaller than 10-point, but it certainly wasn't overt. The desktop filled the screen perfectly and overall we think most viewers will be happy with its capabilities as a big computer display.(Update 5-15-07): Reports about the LN-T4665F's issues with some HDMI devices, namely the Sony PlayStation 3, have surfaced recently, but we experienced no problems with our review sample. We connected a variety of devices to the set via HDMI, including the PS3 (we tried both Blu-ray movies and games), high-def disc players, a DirecTV HR20, a Gefen HDMI distribution amplifier and a Radiient HDMI switch, and didn't experience any issues. We also routed the PS3 and other sources through the amplifier and switcher, and connected those devices to all three of the LN-T4665F's HDMI ports, and in all cases our sample performed as expected.Geek boxTEST  RESULT  SCOREBefore color temp (20/80)  8401/7365  PoorAfter color temp  6379/6565  GoodBefore grayscale variation  +/- 1186K  PoorAfter grayscale variation  +/- 134  AverageColor of red (x/y)  0.636/0.328  GoodColor of green  0.281/0.608  GoodColor of blue  0.148/0.061  GoodOverscan  0 %  GoodBlack-level retention  All patterns stable  GoodDefeatable edge enhancement  Y  Good480i 2:3 pull-down, 24 fps  Pass  Good1080i video resolution  Fail  Poor1080i film resolution  Fail  PoorSamsung LCDs promise six-figure contrastIn addition to the Samsung LCDs detailed here, the company is introducing two more expensive series of LCDs in August 2007. The new sets incorporate step-up features designed to improve picture quality: 120Hz refresh rates and, in the most expensive series, LED backlights said to boost contrast ratios beyond anything seen before. We haven't reviewed any of the new models yet, but we can give you information on how their specs stack up. When we do get one of these televisions in for review, we'll update this information.Samsung LN-T71F seriesThe big step-up feature for this series is a 120Hz refresh rate, which is said to cut down on the motion blur sometimes seen by sharp-eyed viewers in fast-moving scenes. Again, we haven't tested this feature yet, and it's not exclusive to Samsung (Sony and Toshiba, among others, have 120Hz LCDs out this year), but it might be worth the extra cash over the step-down 65F and 61F series to some discerning viewers. Compared to the 65F series, the 71F series also boasts a higher contrast ratio, which might mean better black-level performance, but we doubt if the improvement is all that noticeable despite the very high 25,000:1 spec. Styling is also a bit different, too, incorporating chrome plating to accent the standard glossy black. Of course, these models include the same shiny screen we complained about in the LN-T4665F review, which Samsung calls \"Super clear panel.\"Models (estimated selling prices)  * Samsung LN-T4071F (2 699)  * Samsung LN-T4671F (3 399)  * Samsung LN-T5271F (4 399)Step-up features (over the LN-T65F series)  * 120Hz refresh rate  * 25,000:1 contrast ratio  * chrome platingSamsung LN-T81F seriesSamsung LN-T81F seriesSamsung LN-T81F series(Credit: Samsung)Samsung's highest-end LCD-based HDTVs for 2007, the LN-T81F series, includes the first widely distributed flat-panel LCDs that replace the traditional fluorescent backlight (the TV's light source) with LED technology. The benefits, according to Samsung, include more-accurate color and better black-level performance, to the extent that the company is claiming a 100,000:1 contrast ratio, the highest yet for a shipping flat-panel set. The TVs are said to achieve these deep black levels because the dark areas of the display can be turned off completely--traditional LCD backlights are always on, which causes \"black\" areas of the picture to brighten a bit as the light leaks through--with so-called local dimming technology. All this pretty-sounding technology costs a pretty penny compared to the 71F series (from $300 to $600 extra depending on screen size), but it has the potential to really improve picture quality. Needless to say, we're excited to review one of the 81F series and check out the claims for ourselves. Aside from the LED backlight, the LN-T81F series is pretty much identical to the 71F series in terms of specs and includes the same shiny screen.Models (estimated selling prices)  * Samsung LN-T4081F (2 999)  * Samsung LN-T4681F (3 999)  * Samsung LN-T5281F (4 999)  * Samsung LN-T5781F (6 999)Step-up features  * LED backlight  * local dimming  * 100,000:1 contrast ratio", "Date": "July 13, 2007"}, {"Title": "Great set", "Author": "Jeffrey C.

The tech. thought it was the t-conn board and replaced it. This ruined the picture, I had him put the original one back in and decided to just live with the buzzing. After about 2 years the TV started taking a long time to turn on. When it finally did turn on it would have thin multi-colored vertical stripes on the screen. I had a tech. from a different repair center come out because the last tech was obviously incompetent. The new tech. said Samsung LCD's all have bad capacitors in them. They can't handle the power load and will eventually fail. He said they cost mere penny's but Samsung is to \"cheap\" to put good quality capacitors in there TV's. My TV had 3 bad caps. but he replaced all five saying the other ones would eventually go bad. Its kind of suspicious that these caps. last just long enough for the warranty to expire. I've heard there's a class action lawsuit in the works against Samsung because of this problem. This new tech also discovered that the buzzing sound was being caused by a loose back light. He replaced the LCD panel to fix the problem. The new panel was bad and ruined the picture quality of the TV. To make a long story short - he ended up putting no less than 4 different panels in my TV and still the picture isn't as good as when it was new. I've called Samsung numerous times and have to say dealing with the absolutely incompetent people they have answering there phones has easily been one of the most frustrating experiences of my entire life.

As it turns out, I called exactly 1 day late!I was lucky enough to have some spare capacitors that fit the bill, and it was a straightforward repair, thanks to the videos posted on YouTube. After replacing 4 capacitors (solder gun) the TV is back to working perfectly. Fingers crossed.The image clarity is outstanding. I installed a roof antenna and pick up many stations in HD, as opposed to the analog signal from Comcast (basic basic service). The TV is slow to turn on and change stations, but that's typical of digital TVs. I don't mind the remote, although the flimsy battery holder tab did break off.It has many functions, allowing PC hookup, HDMI, and you can insert a USB stick in the side to view images. Handy.I let Samsung know about the issue, and if it happens to you, but sure to at least report it. It's a good company. Everyone makes mistakes and I'm sure they will learn from this one.ADDENDUM (July 2012): Samsung restored my faith in them as a reputable company, agreeing to compensate owners of TVs with defective capacitors, although it did take a class-action lawsuit.I was contacted by Samsung U.S. and they agreed to pay me for the cost of a new power supply board ($76). The TV has worked perfectly since I installed the new board (easy to do). My replacement of the capacitors (as I mentioned) lasted for a year before the TV started acting up again, so a new board is probably the best solution.ADDENDUM (December 2013). My repair failed after a year. I bought a new power board for $75 and installed it. Simple repair. Still working great.

This TV was for my living room as a kind of second TV, so I opted for the 40 inch. This TV is pretty much what the reviews and Samsung say it is, so I'll skip all the \"awesome-ness\" comments. TV sound is OK, but I run everything through a Bose speaker system. Of note, the USB input is quite user friendly...commands are similar to \"slide show\" in the commonly used digital pic software. You must use the Samsung remote (Wiselink command) and follow on-screen commands to do a slideshow. I ran a male/female USB cable from the back of the set to the front underneath for convenience when using a flash USB device. The pictures from my D80 Nikon display with razor sharpness not seen on my computer, truly attention-getting. DVD's, with background music, made from digital pics and slides with Roxio software are WAY better than anything I have ever seen them on before and, of course, much larger. TV hookup is simple and the ways to suit the picture to your liking are adequate. I could not get the Samsung remote programmed to work all system components (including my brand of cable box; also it lacks receiver/amplifier control capability), but then none of the other remotes make everything work either, so plan on using multiple remotes.

The new screens that Samsung is using in their LCD HDTVs is a great improvement (it has a slightly glossier look to it than conventional LCD's, giving it a cleaner and brighter look, without being too shiny like some Plasmas can be).  The only negative I can think of for this TV is that it took a while to get the settings just right to get the best image.  But once you do it really is the best image you can get for the price.

Walter", "ReviewID": "R17GI1FSXCQGRM", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I bought the LNT4065F from Amazon in October 2006. So far, the set has been absolutely flawless. The delivery folks  did a nice job, contacted me ahead of time to arrange a date and time, and insisted on inspecting the display before leaving (it was delivered to my work address, so we couldn't set it up immediately). One average size adult can pick this set up and move it around. I think a 40\" or 42\" set is about the biggest that's manageable by one person.The default picture settings are insane: max brightness, max contrast, max color. With a little bit of experimentation and fine tuning you can achieve a picture that is remarkably accurate. As others have said, watching sports in HD is very close to actually being there. The glossy frame is a bit distracting but doesn't interfere with the picture. However, the highly reflective screen itself can be annoying when there are lights on in the room or a bright window nearby. I accept this drawback because I enjoy the deep blacks and high contrast ratio, and I'm willing to adjust the display on the swivel base, turn off distracting lights, etc. If you want low maintenance, or you're viewing mostly in a very bright room, I would recommend checking out the LNT4061, which has the matte display surface that reduces reflections.The audio is adequate. I don't generally crank it up, and those who do will probably invest in a home theater system anyway. The remote control offers good functionality, but it's long and slender, so you constantly have to shift it up and down in your hand to get to the right button. Not a big deal since I do most of my button pushing with the cable remote.The capability to display a slide show from pictures on a USB thumb drive is a nice feature. I'm not sure if many other manufacturers offer this yet. The only downside is the long time to render each photo, about a second for each one, during which time you're looking at a blank screen.The most important feature is picture quality, and this TV really delivers.

My main comment and suggestion would be that the TV reception is only as good as its content source. Regular cable from Comcast was grainy and looked awful when stretched to the 16:9 ratio on the screen. I ended up leaving it at 4:3. Now, with HDTV, 16:9 is like I am at the movie theater!One thing I will need to do further is adjust the brightness down a little, as the LCD screen can be a bit strong on the eyes from approximately 8 feet away, which is how we have the TV set up now. My friend has a plasma and that seems to be a little less intense, though I think my picture overall puts his to shame.I did not notice a significant lag in the remote time, and have not considered the glare to be a problem, as others have posted on this forum. I think it's pretty cool that I can use my jump drive or external USB drive to play music and put my picture slideshow on the screen, although I can't imagine using that too much.If you decide to buy the TV, have no fears over going through Amazon. I had it delivered in just over a week and got the Super Saving Shipping. (The DVD player came in 3 days). Also, within the 30 days, the price went down by $50, so I contacted Amazon and within 2 days had a $50 credit applied to my account!! (Within 35 days, the price went down another $20..booooo!!) :)All in all, a great purchase. I wouldn't hesitate to recommend the TV or buying it through Amazon.", "Date": "December 16, 2007"}, {"Title": "Did my research and I LOVE this TV", "Author": "L. south", "ReviewID": "R13P5DFTNM2X3", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Great price at $1329 with super fast shipping.

Hitomi", "ReviewID": "R10GSRBEXCM6NE", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Like a lot of the reviewers here, I have coveted an HDTV for quite some time just watching prices and reading every review (CNET in particular) trying to decide.After looking at Sony, Samsung, and Sharp at the local BB and CC more times than my wife cares to remember, and being overwhelmed by the choices and varying technologies, we zeroed in on a Samsung LCD primarily based on the reviews from CNET.Primary concerns going in:1.  Reflective screen that everyone was commenting on2.  Online purchase of a big ticket item; primarily from two perspectives:  a.  Delivery experience - will it be good?  Will it arrive promtly?  Will it be broken?  b.  If defective, what will the return policy/experience be like?After consulting the wife (and buying on my own) I decided on the Samsung 4065, and held by breath.  Would I be pleased or incur the wrath of \"I told you so!\"Actual Experience1. Ordered online Nov 6; delivered 4 days later.  After reading some poor reviews of Eagle; to be honest, I was nervous.  In reality it was all misplaced and I was very pleased with the delivery experience.  They called ahead and asked when would be a good time to call and gave a 4 hr window (between 11-2).  They arrived at noon and efficiently setup the TV exactly where I wanted it.  Could not be more pleased with that portion of the transaction.2.  Screen Glare - Many of the reviews, including CNET, talked about an annoying screen glare and to avoid placing in a room with lots of direct light.  In the room where this TV is located it is in direct light; in fact it is right next to the window!  It is a north facing exposure and in the daytime I was not able to discern any major problems with viewing.  I even turned on lamps in the room to try to get an articial source; nada.  Now at night time, that is a different story.  In a normally lit room AND a TV source that is NOT HD and NOT full screen you can pick up the mirror effect.  When viewing HD (e.g. local Channel 5 in the SF region) it was not a problem.  Dimming the lights to so there is only filtered light from another room takes much of it away for us.  Again, even when viewed (and I was looking for it) it did not bother us at all; including my wife who is usually quick to point things out visually if they are distracting her.Other Experiences1.  Remote is pretty easy to use2.  Like a typical user, did not bother to read the manual, but getting started is fairly easy.  It should be intuitive to begin with!!3.  Auto programming (we have Comcast) included a lot of blank channels (not scrambled) and using the channel list function to delete them is tedious4.  DVD's look great even without a HD or Blu RaySo after only having it for a few days, i cann honestly say that I am pleased.  Watching NFL Sunday in HD is amazing..Wish List:Now that I have seen the promised land of HDTV, I need a new source since the Comcast HD lineup is anemic.Any suggestions / recommendation between Dish vs Direct.  All comments welcomeAdded InfoI forgot to include another major buying factor - the dreaded extended warranty.  After getting (politely) bombarded whenever I go into CC or BB about how great the warranty is for such \"an important\" buying decision.  I decided to do a little investigative work1.  Called the Manufacturer - In my case, I called Samsung and they indicated that if you register online they will extend the original factory warranty by an extra 90 days so you get a total of 15 months; not exactly what I was wanting to hear; but better than a sharp stick in the eye2.  You can purchase an extended warranty from samsung at a cost - only two plans 1yr and a 3 yr.  1 yr costs $180; 3 yr cost $510(approximately $170/yr); cost is now not floating my boat.  Is there a better option?3.  Called credit card issuers - if you are a Visa Signature card holder, and use the card, you can register at the Visa site and purchase an extended warranty; 5 year for about $140BTW:  Ask WHEN the extended warranty starts.  Most consumers think AFTER the manufacturer (original) expires; aha; think again.  The catch is that they all START when you first purchase so your 3 years warranty runs CONCURRENT to the factory so that 3 year coverage is acutally only 2 years once the original 12 mo manufacturer warranty expires!!  Recalculate the anual cost to find true cost!Bottom Line:  Check you credit card; if it has a Visa Signature status; use that for the purchase and go to Visa to get the extended warranty.  A much better deal11/26 Update - After only 2 1/2 weeks of usage, here are some thoughts -1.  Remote - Unlike many of the universal remotes that you can pick up fairly cheaply and can run to to the frid while bouncing off a wall during commercial break, the remote has a weird need to be aimed directly at the TV; it cannot be slightly offset (bounced off a wall) or it will not pick up the remote signal.  This is a not such a big deal, but just a minor nit (annoyance)2.  Volume Smoothing - The manual describes it as adjusting for differences in broadcast transmissions so VOL 12 doesn't sound like VOL 40 when switching channels.  We'll...I cannot say that it really works.  I was expecting a volume of 14 to stay consistent, but it does not.  I'll call Samsung and get the skinny on what it's really doing vs. what the manual indicated it should be doing that led to my unmet expectation.", "Date": "November 12, 2007"}, {"Title": "Greate TV.

They've done it in a quick and professional manner. Great job!The TV itself is fabulous. Incredible picture, easy to operate.

The TV was delivered safe & sound with free shipping from Amazon!  The TV was very easy to set-up and I have it hooked up to my Samsung HT-TX75 DVD Home Theater System that I also bought in June.  I wanted to use all HDMI connections but my Verizon FIOS Motorola cable box is not HDMI compliant with the Samsung HD TV & Samsung Home Theater System. I had the cable box plugged into my Home Theater System and then I had HDMI out from my Home Theater System plugged into my TV.  I get a green screen when I try to run HD channels saying HD content has been compromised. I called Samsung and they said that my cable box was not HDMI compliant. They said the only way around this is to get an updated box from FIOS which is not available yet or run your cable HDMI output into the TV instead of the Home Theater System and then use the Optical audio out of the TV and plug that into the Home Theater System. I tried this and the system works great! Fortunately, the TV has 3 HDMI inputs as I use all three:  1 from the cable box, 1 from the Home Theater System (for DVD playback), & 1 from my XBOX 360 Elite system.The HD content from FIOS on the TV looks Amazing. Even standard channels from the Verizon FIOS look really crisp on this TV. I also have a home media center pc and I have it networked to my TV via an XBOX 360.  I use the 360 as a media center extender and can stream music, video,online content like Youtube & pictures to my TV.  I can't tell you how awesome it is!  My wife loves to listen to music on the TV via my media center extender and look at pictures from our pc. We actually look at pictures now. It is so much better to see pictures on a 40\" TV vs. a small computer screen.The TV's sound system is decent but a TV of this quality deserves a good surround sound system. I would highly recommend the Samsung HT-TX75 DVD Home Theater System as it is sub $400 and it sounds great. You cannot beat this system for the price. The Samsung Home Theater system also upscales DVD's to 1080i and it looks great. I have not tried Blu-Ray or HD DVD's on this TV yet but the XBOX 360 Elite looks great in 1080p mode.

The picture quality wasn't as good as my Sharp Aquos LCxxD92u, but the specs will tell you this.  Selecting inputs was tedious compared to the Sharp.  Then I encountered an intolerable problem.  I couldn't program my Directv/Tivo remote to properly control the volume.  I went through all the suggested codes and then did the \"code search\" procedure.  I did this with two different remotes.  The power and mute buttons worked but the volume would only go up or down in one-unit increments each time the button was pressed.  In other words, I had to repeatedly press the volume button to achieve the desired volume.  For continuous volume change I had to use the Samsung remote, a pain in the ***.  I called Samsung tech support and was told to contact Directv about the problem.  Knowing that would be a waste of time since both remotes were programmable to function with other TV's, I decided to return the Samsung.  There are three possibilities here.  (1) I am an idiot and didn't program the Tivo remote correctly.  (2) The particular Samsung I had had a defect of some sort with respect to volume control by a Directv/Tivo remote.  (3) Samsung engineers screwed up and didn't make the unit adaptable for using a Directv/Tivo remote.  Since Samsung offered no solution to my problem other than contacting Directv I think it likely No. 3 is the case.  If so, that would be a huge blunder since there are probably millions of these \"peanut\" shaped remotes out there that Directv customers expect to use with their new LCD.  If you are one of these I suggest you contact Samsung before buying this model (or other models???) and get their guarantee your remote can be programmed to control their TV.", "Date": "September 13, 2007"}, {"Title": "Stillllllll waiting at a 2 week mark!", "Author": "Lisa Bertrand \"lrbertrand\"", "ReviewID": "R3LY6X7QD316Y3", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I am sure this TV is going to be fabulous once we GET IT!

However, with in a few days there was some \"flickering\" or \"snow\" going on at the top and bottom of the screen. Fortunately it didnt happen on every channel, so I could still watch TV while I waited for the problem to be fixed.I called Samsung and they instructed me to switch HDMI ports. Their explanation was that perhaps one of the HDMI ports was not functioning properly but since I switched ports and the TV was now working fine, that the problem was fixed. Well I responded that why should I have a TV with a damaged HDMI port. What if I wanted to add a DVD player, PS3, etc. in the future. So we scheduled a service call and a Samsung repair came on a week later. (2 weeks - defective TV)The repair man stated that the TV was not properly programmed when it left the factory and so he reprogrammed the TV by accessing a menu that I had no idea how to get to. So no need to open up the TV and replace the HDMI port...or so we thought. Within 24 hours the problem was back.So now I contacted Amazon via telephone regarding a replacement TV. I was instructed by an \"outsourced\" representative that they would send a message to the appropriate department within Amazon and that someone would contact me via email with 24 hours. Well guess what...no one contacted me for almost 2 whole business days. So I called back again and asked for a replacement and was again told that i would be contacted via email.I also requested compensation for the fact that i paid/tipped the Eagle delivery $10, the Samsung repair guy $5, and now I'd probably pay the next Eagle delivery guy $5-10 to remove the old TV and set up the new one.Amazon finally responded after almost 4 days that they \"don't require\" any payments to delivery or repair people nor will they expedite the order (Eagle). So I'm left waiting approximately 10-15 days from the time I called for the replacement until the time I'll hopefully receive the new TV...not to mention that its July 4th holiday weekend, I wont be around to receive the delivery.Its not like I ordered a book here. You would think they would treat their customers a little better, especially a customer who ordered a high ticket item like this. If i didnt have a substantial gift certificate, which I used on this order, I would have returned the TV altogether and purchased it from a store near me. Not to mention the fact that it takes 5 days to receive a TV from Harrisburg, PA to New York City...I won't even touch on that issue. So thanks Amazon for ruining my 30th birthday and treating me like dirt.
