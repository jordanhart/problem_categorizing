It's probably the best LCD tv I came across with eye-opening contrast. The picture is exceptionally clear, even for the SD programs. Obviously, I can't test 1080p, but its a probably a good thing to have for 'future-proofing'. ( I did see a Samsung demo of 1080p on this model...its quite impressive).The native resolution of 1920x1080 also works great for connecting to PC. Movie Picture mode produces great black levels comparable to Plasmas.Advantages -1. Great looking - elegant.2. 1080p with 1980x1080 native resolution.3. Great dynamic contrast ratio - 6000:14. Separate Game mode.5. Great even for SD.6. 8 ms response time7. less expensive than XBR.Disadvantages -1. The only difference I could think of between Bravia XBR and this one is 2 HDMI inputs instead of 3 for BRAVIA. Not a big deal for me.Overall - I love it.", "Date": "September 8, 2006"}, {"Title": "Awesome!", "Author": "KRL", "ReviewID": "R2NWLMJ3WG1KTH", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Did tons of research and Samsung seemed the way to go. Even though all my purchases thru Amazon were great, I was a bit leary of buying this TV online due to the return policy. I decided to go for it since I would save close to 1000.00 which included free shipping and no tax. Amazon came thru again, and everything was perfect. The TV is very slick in design and the picture is beautiful.Do not expect to see a picture like you do in the stores. Unless you have High Def channels available, your picture will not be as clear. It looks great from 10 feet away, but as you get closer the resolution is not as good. High Def channels make a HUGE difference.", "Date": "November 1, 2006"}, {"Title": "Great Set", "Author": "C. Longo", "ReviewID": "R3GBQ0C568XZBW", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I have been dragging my heels entering the HDTV era for years now.  I sat by while my early adopter friends bought their first HD sets, waiting for HD to reach \"prime time\" status.  Finally, the combination of 1) 1080p 2) HDMI 3) lower prices across the board are what ultimately drove towards me to getting my first HD set.I researched models for months before buying.  I first looked at the Sharp Aquos line which seemed great until I started reading of \"banding\" issues (a manufacturing flaw) which plagued nearly all Aquos models 40-inches and over.  Being the obsessive type, I could not justify spending that much money on a set with problems out of the box.  Next I looked at the Sony XBR2 and XBR3 series, which also seemed great.  In the end, two things turned me off 1) The price was $500 - $1000 more than comparable Samsung or Sharp models and 2) Reports of \"clouding\" issues, where black screens have noticeable white blotches, another manufacturing flaw.I spent hours upon hours reading threads at the excellent AVS Forums about the Samsung models and was surprised to see nary a complaint uttered.  For those who don't know, AVS is a haven for hardcore home theater enthusiasts.  These guys mull over every single pixel of a display.  If there is something wrong with the set -- they will let you know.  Post after post were overwhelming positive about the Samsung sets, both the LN-S and LN-T lines, even in threads about Sharp and Sony sets :)  Comfortable I was not about to drop over two large on a lemon, I pulled the trigger.I've had the set for three weeks now and I have zero regrets.  The thing I worried the most about before receiving the set was the black levels.  Apparently, LCD displays cannot render truly deep blacks that Plasma displays can.  I worried for nothing.  The blacks seem plenty black to me, even with all the lights off.  There's also an \"Energy Saver\" mode available directly from the remote which toggles the backlight between four levels, so you can adjust the black levels even further.The colors on this set just \"pop\" -- it's amazing.  I've started watching \"Sunrise Earth\" on Discovery HD every morning while getting ready for work because it just looks so good.  This is going to sound like total BS, but the first day I played Sunrise Earth on the new set there were ducks on onscreen and my dog ran across the room, sat down in front of the set, and started barking :)The set has a DNIe mode which automatically tweaks the onscreen colors and sharpens the picture.  This mode can provide some amazing images for most content, but I found it cause artifacts in DVDs and sports.  I suggest anyone who dislikes what DNIe does to DVD content turn it off and get a Lucas Films DVD and use the included THX Optimizer to tweak the set yourself.  The truth is that 90% of the people who buy this set won't care about such subtleties and don't have to touch a setting to get a great picture.Overall five stars.  Great picture, great price.  Two HDMI ports and 1080p make it future proof.  The Samsung LN-S and LN-T lines are, at the moment, the best bang for the buck in the LCD market.", "Date": "April 23, 2007"}, {"Title": "Very Satisfied - Excellent Quality Set", "Author": "Thomas Merck \"Reader995\"", "ReviewID": "RQQRFD10CSSU", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Compared this to the Sony Bravia XBR2 and Sharp LC46D62U.  The Sony was expensive and I heard about some clouding issues, with Sharp it was banding.  Overall the Samsung appeared to have more consistently good ratings so I ordered the set.  I also wanted the PC input and the Sony and Sharp did not feature this.When it arrived I had it out of the box within minutes and ready to view.  The menu system is very intuitive as were the cable hookups. I declined the expensive Monster cables and used less costly HMDI cables from Radio Shack. Comments:High Definition:  Everything I had expected, fantastic.DVD via HMDI: Even better than I could imagine, with this quality who needs BLU-RAY or HD-DVD?Standard Definition: About as good as you can expect with this resolution quality.Sound: Fills a room with real presence, crystal clear, amazing that this comes from two speakers.Dead Pixels: NoneImage Problems: None that I could see, no clouding, banding, nothing.One aspect of large sets that I dislike is the elephant in a ballroom appearance.  The Samsung is elegantly designed and has none of that overwhelming aspect.Very happy with this purchase and if Samsung keeps the commitment to quality I will buy from them again and again.", "Date": "March 7, 2007"}, {"Title": "Excellent bang for the buck", "Author": "Axol", "ReviewID": "RSF5XFGY6TN56", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I've had this TV for about 4 months now and I love it.  Like most people I was trying to decide between the Sony XBR, Sharp Aquos, and this Samsung.  I went with the Samsung because while the Sony picture was slightly better when compared side by side at the store it was not $1,000 better.  Also I really like the piano black case and stand. It's very elegant and sleek.  I'm not a gamer so I have no experience with that.I have HD through Comcast and honestly compared to my friend's Sony XBR that's running HD DirecTV, mine is noticably better.  I assume it's the signal not the TV.One really great feature that I like is that you can switch the input source by just pressing one button.  This allows me to use my Cable Box remote to switch the inputs on this set.  Consequently it's one less remote I need to have out.Sound quality is decent, not amazing but when I watch movies I use my receiver anyways.  I can notice some \"clouds\" on a dark screeen but it's no where near as bad as my friend's XBR.  Also during fast moving action scenes I can see some pixelation.  Kind of annoying but it's rare and appears to be inherrent with the current LCD technology.  If I had to do it again, I would buy this TV again except perhaps a larger size.", "Date": "June 6, 2007"}, {"Title": "Really good looking TV", "Author": "VideoMan", "ReviewID": "R2GNK50890ELSM", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I purchased this TV as many did after comparing to the Sony XBR2. Thought it looked a little better than the older XBR model in side by side comparison, but not quite as good as the XBR2 series. There are several factors including price, looks and features that led me to purchase this TV over the Sony. Read on.After comparing sisde by side the Sony XBR, Sony XBR2 and this Samsung set, I was a little concerened about the blacks being crushed while watching this TV in the store, turned out the store setting was goofy. I found you have many adjustments for picture settings you can save and modify to your satisfaction. Also the local SD picture was terrible in the store. I knew that this would comprise at least 80% of what I would watch until DirecTV comes out with their promised 100 channels of HD programming later this year. The set was hooked up to a DirecTV receiver in the store but of course was wired with about 500ft of cable and splitters and signal boosters to get the signal to the TVs on display. After having it delivered and installed with 12ft HDMI cable to the wall mounted set and a DirectV HR20-700 HD DVR hooked up, the local SD channels looked much better than in the store. It really gets down to what receiver you use, the settings that are set, what quality of signal the cable/satillite provider sends you and what the local channel signal sends as well as how each and every picture you see is recorded. With all the formats out there in recording technology, most of what is being bradcast is at least acceptable. Some though look terrible and will give you a headache if you watch say a poor 480i image scaled up to 1020i. You just have to know when to hit that channel button. Nothing will make a bad picture look better, especially blowing it up over twice the size. Eventually all video will be gathered in high quality HD. Hopefully within the next 5 years cable and satillite companies will actually bradcast in 1020P or higher, but don't hold your breath. This factor is the most misunderstood thing that the average person is confused about when watching an HD TV, thinking that everything that shows up on that screen should look pristine, bit the fact is garbage in, blah, blah!Back to the TV review. The sound on my set is very good. I've heard about some with rattles or thin sounding sets but don't have that problem. I set a custom setting with the equalizer and saved a slight bass expanded setting for general viewing when I don't want to pop on the surround sound amps. Sounds good to me with the SRS turned on for most viewing. My room is fairly small 13x20 so people with larger rooms and need to crank it up more may not agree.It took a couple of phone calls to DiecTV to get the DTV receiver to hold the 1020i resolution setting, but once that was done everything comes up great with a TV setting of 1020i with vertical side bars for 4x3 and full screen with 16x9 programming. Full screen 1080i (modified) DirecTV broadcast looks great.Over all this is a really good TV and should last a long time with the LCD technology over plasma and DLP TVs. The remote design and not quite so snappy function was the only really I didn't give this TV 5 stars. I'm trying a Harmony 880 for the wife with this setup and once I get my older Home Theater Master MX850 remote programmed I think I will have a great setup that should work as expected with really fantastic picture.Bottom line is if you got an extra $1000 right now to spend on the Sony XBR2 set, it does a little better job with lower quality bradcast signals and makes them look pretty good, but for my money the Samsung LN-S4695D is the only other TV to compete with it right now and on a good HD signal or upconverted DVD player looks fantastic!!!PS: If you're at one of the big box stores, ask to see the \"FUTURE\" and watch the Sony full 1080p hard drive demo program. They had it hooked to the Sony XBR2 at the store. W O W ! !

After many trips to the \"big box\" stores, I was firmly convinced that the Samsung LN-4695D was the best looking (picture).  The high end Sony Bravia was equally good looking, but it lacks many of the features (PIP) that the Samsung's possess and the SONY is $1000 more.  Also, the LCD panels for both televisions are from the same manufacturer.I was always a little put off by the contrast ratio 6000:1 on the Samsung. It was a lot less than the comparable models from Sharp and Mitsubishi.  After seeing all three side by side, there was no comparison.  The Samsung's blacks were blacker, the colors were brighter and more detailed.It wasn't until i got it home that I was truly amazed at the performance of this TV. It looks great, especially when watching sports in HD.  Like most LCD TV's, the performance falls off a little on standard TV and DVD, but with the Samsung, it wasn't bad.

I also compared and debated with the sony bravia 46\" XBR2...well XBR3 actually due to its black trim, but the extra $200 really put it out of reach compared with the Samsung!  Same conclusion as others here; for the jump in price to sony, the picture just isn't that much better.  At times the Samsung looks better due to those wonderfully \"inky\" blacks and rich color, but other times the sony pic looks a tad better...but not $700-$1000 better.  And no PIP?  Well there you go!  One thing I noticed about most reviews here, nobody mentions the stand they mated with the tv, either mounted and accompanying stand or the stand it sits on.  Well, if you want the sweetest stand to mate this beauty...Z-Line Phantom50  (avail at Circuit City...bought mine from Oxnard store...Manager Melida, the best there is!!!)  Let me elaborate...  As I was walking towards the register somewhat reluctant and hesitant to fork over the over 3 grand for TV, tabletop stand and hi-def sat receiver, I noticed sony 40\" bravia with blue ray display on an endcap with quite a nice stand the set was mounted to.  Salesman informed me stand would support up to 50\" lcd/plasma and that it was exact width of Samsung 4695 (+/- 1/2\").  Once decision was made to go with this stand, my reluctance and hesitation quickly turned to cheese-eating grins of impatience and excitement. Aesthetically, this stand is the perfect compliment to a beautiful tv...it mounts on a long metal frame that stands mounted behind the 3 high gloss black shelves that match the piano black finish of the tv.  The 3 shelves provide plenty of space for your components and center channel speaker.  Also, as narrow as the tv's 44\", very space saving.

We have a VERY bright room where this tv is, so we had to get LCD.  Ive had this tv for about 10 days now.  The 1st 6 days were without a HD receiver, and I have to say I was disappointed in the picture.  There is significant clouding in standard definition blacks, especially at night (lack of mcuh light in the viewing room).

If you do get HD progrmaming, I love this set!!  Luckily my sattellite gets about 30 HD channels, including all locals, which is what we watch most anyways, so it has been great for us.Some extra points...1)If you have a very bright room that gets lots of sun, this is the HD TV for you.2) The sound is great!

I was about to buy the newest 40\" 720p Samsung for $1899... then I stumbled upon this one at Circuit City for $1999 and bought it on the spot... paid about $50 for delivery and had it in my living room about three hours later. I've had it a week now, and I love it.  Standard-definition picture quality is just okay, but are any of us buying these TVs to watch SDTV? I get about 15 HD channels through my cable company (UPDATE: Now about 40), including all four major networks plus ESPN, ESPN2 and a couple music and movie channels. Therefore, a majority of everything I watch is available in HD anyway. SDTV content still looks decent from the typical viewing distance of 10-12 feet. HD content looks awesome (including black levels), and my cable provider broadcasts in only 720p. I can only imagine how good 1080p content is going to look once it becomes available.  I'm going to wait another year or two for the High-Definition DVD format war to play out before I buy a Blu-Ray or HD-DVD player. But I've watched standard-definition DVD on my Xbox with this TV, and the picture is beautiful. I'm sure High-Definition DVD would look a little better in a side-by-side comparison, but you will not have any complaints watching standard-definition DVD on this TV.  In short, this is an excellent TV, especially compared to other 1080p  models in its size range. If you're looking for something in the range of $2000-$2200, this is the one you want. Enjoy.UPDATE - 9/13/08 - I recently purchased a PS3, primarily for use as a Blu-ray player (not much of a gamer). So far I have watched \"Cloverfield\", \"Batman Begins\" and \"John Mayer: Where the Light Is\" on Blu-Ray, and all I can say is \"Whoa\". It truly looks, to my eye, every bit as good as TVs that are currently being sold for two or three times as much. Some of these TVs may be slightly better if compared side-by-side, but not so much better as to justify paying two or three times as much. My personal opinion is that if you're paying more than $1800-$2000 for a TV in this size range, you're getting ripped off.", "Date": "April 21, 2007"}, {"Title": "Awesome!

I had it out of the box and playing xbox 360 in full 1080p in no time. I love the rotating stand it works great in my place. I wanted to leave a review because these reviews helped me so much. I went to best buy and looked at the new model from samsung next to the 40\" version of this model. The newer one had a slightly better picture, but for me it was not worth an extra 800-1000 dollars. The reason why is because when I got this baby home and fired it up I wanted for nothing. I set the picture settings to my likings, which was easy to do, and I was off to the races. The only thing I would say that could have been better, and I don't even know if this is really an issue with the TV, but when I hooked up older gaming systems like nintendo and nintendo 64 the brightness had to be adjusted to see some games. This is probably more because those consoles weren't made for such tv's, but they still worked fine once I made the adjustments. I read all the complaints on the sound and I completely disagree. I love the sound. As a matter of fact I have to turn down often. By the way, for you gamers, I did some research and found out that xbox 360 does in fact play games in full 1080p with the component or vga cables hooked up. Microsoft released an update last november that added 1080p output, (go ahead just google it or go to microsoft website and look at the resolution or cables section) and after you hook the tv up to the console the display settings have the 1080p option. Therefore this tv is great for either ps3 or xbox 360, and games sure do look gorgeous on it. One other thing that could've been better about the tv is the remote. It is very comfortable in the hand, but it's reception is pretty weak. I will probably get an all in one remote someday. DVD's look great on it. Sound output to my reciever is great.

I needed to get rid of my tube HDTV due to space constraints, and I needed a panel to mount above the fire place.I spent a very large amount of time doing homework on the specifications, and narrowed my search based on price and my requirements (1080p, LCD, etc), and arrived at either the Sony XBR or the Samsung LNS4695d.  After hitting the pavement, and seeting the set in the proper viewing places (avoide Best Buy and other big box stores, as they split the signal too many times, and have varying signals between different sets depending on where they sit on the daisy chain) and decided the Samsung offered virtually the same picture quality and specifications as the Sony, and for less money.The set treated me great for 3 years, with only one exception.  During very fast motion, such as a football game (American) where the ball was thrown past the crowd, or a car race, I would experience macro-blocking, and the set's 60hz simply could not keep up with very fast moving HD broadcasts (via cable).  There were other issues related to this, but suffice it to say, the TV processed too slow to keep up, and artifacts and other symptoms showed that.  I also had minor ghosting in some circumstances, but I find that is visible to the experienced eye even on the Sony sets and other CFL backlit models.After 3.5 years, just out of warranty, the set recently started showing horizontal white and colored lines.  flashing and intermittant at first, over 8 weeks, they slowly became more static, and eventually made the TV unwatchable.  The condition appeared across all sources, and after much troubleshooting and time on the phone with Samsung, the TV was determined by them as \"at the end of its useful life.\"  For the price I paid, I found this conclusion utterly unaccetpable.  After further research, I've determined the board that processes the horizontal information had failed.  The part is $500 from Samsung and a handful of other providors, which equates to what I could purchase the same television for now on ebay.  There are essentially zero Samsung service centers, and no in-home service options.  I would have been forced to ship the television out of state for analysis and service, with no guarantee it could be repaird.  I decided not to bother attempting to repair it, as purchasing another working set would have been the same or cheaper than other options.I've since upgraded to another brand, with more current features, and have been very pleased.While the failed hardware isn't a widespread issue (though it does exist if you look closely online), i simply couldn't reccomend this product to anyone any longer, primarily because of Samsung's determination that a $x,xxx television set should only last 3 years.  The other issues were annoying, but I was able to live with them, however the set I use now is flawless, and cheaper, and more advanced.

No NTSC tuner built in and CableCARD capabilities.2) Very WEAK remote. It looks cool but has a weak signal. You have to poin at the TV's on/off button to get it to work.

Many people buy electronics based on the feature list. However many of the competing sets also have competing functions. I purchased this set just to be sure of being inside the techno envelope for the time. My old set was working perfectly well; however, it was time to change due to the mandatory digital and soon to be only format of high definition. The original foray into the electronics seller displayed a lower definition set. If they did not have this animal near buy, I would not have known the difference. Next to this Samsung 46\", 1080p was several other brands. I have to admit that I bought not because of resolution but because this has a swivel and the set is not in the middle of the room. The bezel is black. Other brands wanted several hundred dollars to hide the silver bezel behind an add-on black bezel.It was not until I got the set home that I realized what a great shopper I am. The only negative that I encountered was having to lift an 85 lb set up from the ground to the four-foot pedestal I built. Once in place the swivel paid for its self. A few days later, the standard cable box was replaced with the high def / digital/two channel/ recording top box. Now the set came to life.There are local stations and national stations that are already on high-definition. The set senses this and goes into the high definition mode. Yet for many programs, the picture is still square. Do I care \"no\" because now even the old VCR and standard DVD's are like going to the movies. I cannot tell if it is just the size of the display or the fact that you can see grain in wood and blemishes on the actors faces. Wait there is more. At first, I was disappointed to find that letterbox was not necessarily HD; the picture was an elongated view still stuck in the square part of the set. Therefore, even though the picture was larger it still did not fit the entire screen. Wait what is this that they forgot to advertise? You can stretch any picture size and shape to fit the screen. On top of that, you can fine-tune the sound to keep out the squeaky or pounding sounds; you can do that so easy that you can adjust of any program in seconds.

I really liked the SONY 46\" LCD HDTV with the glass bezel but it was way overpriced and according to some reviews, the price in picture quality could hardly be discernable to a person.  I looked at the SHARP AQUOS 1080p LCD HDTV but too many banding issues and I didn't want to take a risk. I also was worried of buying such a big ticket item off the internet but figured even if I bought from a big box electronics store, I would have the same trouble getting the TV back if I needed to return it, so why not? And the savings, if all went well, would be around $800!! SO I took the plunge!After I ordered I went through the usual routine of thinking I made a mistake and even browsed around some more, eventually looking at the 52\" Samsung 1080p LCD HDTV, but it was approx. $1,500 more...for only an additional 6 inches!! So I didn't make any sudden moves, like refuse the delivery of this TV in order to return it and get another one.I couldn't have been more happier when the delivery guy from EGL (Eagle Global Logistics I think) came.  I had called earlier to get a more specific delivery window and was told he would be here by 2pm.  By 2pm they still hand't arrived so I wired up all my components so it would be ready to plug in the TV. They still had until 6pm which was the time they originally gave me.  At 4pm EGL arrived and he was the nicest delivery guy ever! I was sort of expecting some guys to come, nonchalant about their job, dumping the TV in the middle of my living room and I was already picturing myself having to remind them I had White GLove Delivery Service, but I was so wrong! I think his name was Ashok.  He brought the TV up one flight of stairs by himself and without a dolly! Then he hesitated at the door and asked if I had anything to lay on the carpet because the bottom of the box was dirty and he didn't want to dirty up my carpet! Luckily I had some boxes from another amazon order (I'm addicted to amazon) broke down and ready to take outside to the recycle bin.  I laid those down and he put the TV box on top.  He then unpacked the TV and told me a story of how another guy he delivered to called his company and said he scratched his TV stand while placing the TV on it. I assured him my new TV stand wouldn't scratch and he carefully placed the TV on the stand. WOW it looked huge in my condo living room, why in the world was I thinking I needed a 52\"? He even noticed some small styrofoam packaging material particles stuck to the Samsung TV stand and picked it off for me. THANKS AMAZON, EGL DELIVERY AND ASHOK for making it such a great experience!! oh and I didn't get the additional warranty so I hope nothing goes wrong. I never buy that stuff, I tend to think it's a gimmick. Example 1: I had a SONY 27\" Flat Screen Tube TV purchased in 2001 without one of those warranties--absolutely no problems.

I have to say I like the picture quality on cable channels, but what drove me crazy was the insensitive remote control. I can barely command the TV to do a simple volume up/down or Channel up/down. The remote must be aimed straight at the TV in response to the remote signal. I can not imagine myself using this TV for years down the road. It's extremely annoying when you expct to mute the TV instantly when the phone rings and had to press the remote 3-4 times before the TV will pick up the signal. (Interestly enough, older Samsung TV remote was extremely sensitive and can even operate the TV at opposite direction.)While watching a DVD last night, I discovered a disappointing characteric on Samsung's HDMI digital processing. The TV would leaves a ghost image of the previous frame. It's so obvious that I can clearly read the words from the previous screen. I tried the same HDMI hook up on the Sony 40\" LCD and Sony doesn't show a sign of ghost image.

Since it is still under warrenty, I called the customer service to try to get it repaired. I cannot believe what I heard? They said this is physical damage and it is not covered by the warrenty. I don't know how they can have such an unreasonable rule. Is it that Samsung did not make a good stand, so they purposely exclude such problems. My recommendation is, be aware of the warrety trick and the potential of weak construct (or just bad luck). All in all, the worst customer service I ever had.", "Date": "September 13, 2007"}, {"Title": "Awesome TV !!!", "Author": "George Spantidakis \"George\"", "ReviewID": "RWAVC9XJ3CNI8", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Amazon was the only online merchant that had the same delivery policy as the retail stores (Best Buy & Circuit City).

I went into the store and got a full credit. Unfortunately I had only found that 1080p displays have INCREASED in price and not decreased! That's a first!The Sharp Aquos easily looked the worst out of the three I checked out. At the time the Sony 46\" Bravia was four hundred dollars more than the Samsung, so I said forget it! People say you pay more just for the \"Sony\" logo on the TV. I don't agree. I do think you get more than the competition.I went with this display and hooked it up. I put in a movie and was shocked to see what I found. Certain scenes would go black and some pixelated \"shadow\" or images would still be on the screen. Kind of like \"leftovers\" of the previous image. It looked so horrible. I just couldn't believe how bad it was. It's hard to describe this really.The only way to fix this problem was by using \"Game Mode\" to speed up the display. Nice! Not quite, because this setting does NOT allow you to use the preset settings for the TV (such as Normal, Movie)! It ONLY allows you to use \"Custom\" settings.I configured this TV to my liking and used Digital Video Essentials for calibration. I have experience with calibrating my TVs just perfectly. I've found that the DNIe setting on this TV just makes everything look worse! It's almost as if it just cranks up the sharpness setting to max.I connected up my Oppo Digital Upscaling DVD player and played dozens of movies with this DVD player and a Toshiba HD-DVD player. Certain parts of movies have extremely annoying greenish speckles or tint. This is mostly displayed in very dark scenes. It's so easy to spot this and there is absolutely no setting to fix this. Perhaps a special service menu can fix this. I shouldn't have to do that!I also tried several new cables and various DVD players. I also tested a DVD player through the Component Inputs and was shocked at how terrible the picture was. It was as if input was bad or something. Sure, 1080p can make lower quality video look bad, but not THAT bad. This was unacceptable picture quality for such a high priced TV!I was also watching \"ICE AGE\". On the white ice you can see very faint lines in the image. This occurs in very bright scenes throughtout movies. It's almost not noticable in dark scenes though or from more than 5 feet away. This alone though is so bad that it's enough to make me want to return it.Again, i've wasted hours upon hours to try to see what caused the greenish tint. Even standard television stations sometimes have this. It mostly appears in shadows and especially on the left hand side of the screen.Now today while watching \"The Green Mile\" I saw ghosting! Yes, even with \"Game Mode\" on! I couldn't believe it!The TV is well designed and nice to look at. Other than the green tint to  parts of the movie and the white lines, HD-DVD picture quality is incredible! I was really impressed with the picture quality. Sames goes for very well made standard DVDs such as \"The Green Mile\".I think the remote is good. It's well laid out and i've had no problems with it. The menu system is a bit slow though.I had high expectations for this. I did hours and hours of research and could find no bad things about this display at all! Perhaps I just got a bad one, who knows. I went back to the store and we are doing an exchange for the Sony 46\" Bravia 1080p display. Hopefully I will have better luck with that!It hurts to give this nice thing a 2/5 score. It honestly would be unfair to give it a higher score for such great HD-DVD picture quality with all of it's problems. There's just so many of them. For the price you pay for this television it needs to be perfect! Some could say no TV is perfect, but that's not true!Now I think I know why the Sony Bravia is a few hundred dollars more! I should have trusted my gut when in the store instead of saving a little money.12-14-2006 UPDATE:I'm still using this TV. I went to do an exchange 14 days after purchasing this. It was that bad. I have to wait until the 21st for my new Television. It's nice that people love this TV and you got a good one. I wish I did. I don't know if mine is just defective or what.I now have absolutely TERRIBLE ghosting. It's so bad it makes my head hurt. There is no way this could have a 8ms refresh rate! I watch maybe a dozen movies a week and it's just so bad. At some points It was making me so mad that I just wanted to turn off the movie! I do have \"Game Mode\" on and have tried every setting. I've experienced this with The Green Mile, Mad Max: Beyong Thunderdome, Art School Confidential and half a dozen other movies. I've tried several DVD players as well. Strangely this doesn't occur quite as much with Blu-Ray and HD-DVD movies. The faint white lines are also annoying as well. You can see them from a mile away.12-21-2006 UPDATE:I finally had them come pick up my TV and replace it with a Sony. The Sony KDL-46XB2 has been out of stock at my local store for over a month, but I finally received it. I love the Sony and it's great so far. Nearly everything is good in my book, but i've only used it for a day. I'm going to evaluate it for 2 weeks or more and then post a review of it. The only problem is that some units have a \"cloud\" defect, so it might be a risk. Luckily mine is ok. I could have \"gotten by\" with Samsung, but it had way too many issues. The Sony was only two hundred more and was well worth it.  The \"guts\" are not the same.
