Very impressed with Samsung so far.", "Author": "matteo", "ReviewID": "RI8TPG7QVO3ZW", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I went into my local Circuit City recently intending to look at the Sharp Aquos LC-32D40U. I had heard so much abou the Aquos TVs and how good they were. Since it was on sale I came close to buying it. But the Samsung LNS3241D was sitting right next to the Sharp on the rack and I immediately noticed that the Samsung's picture just looked a whole lot better. Compared to the Samsung, I couldn't believe how washed out the blacks were on the Sharp. I even played with the controls on the Sharp to make sure it's settings weren't messed up. It became very clear that the Samsung has a way better contrast ratio...in fact it pretty much looked the best out of all the other 32\" TVs on display except for maybe the Sony XBR which is twice the price. So I picked up the Samsung and have loved it ever since. Mine didn't have a single burnt pixel out of the box. The built in speakers are pretty respectable. When having friends over to watch movies...they have asked if all that sound was coming from the TV's speakers. The picture quality is great with Comcast HD and with DVDs. It's awesome to have an LCD with such deep, rich blacks, but my only complaint is that sometimes the darks are a bit too dark. It may just be a setting issue. I haven't tried seriously to fix it because it doesn't bother me that much. I was also blown away by the quality I was able to get hooking up my laptop computer to the TV. since the PC connector is just VGA and not DVI, I thought \"this is going to look like crap\" but it looks great...extreamly crisp and clear. The TV. could very well be used as a computer monitor too. All in all, I'm a very happy camper...except for the fact that Amazon's price is now cheaper than Circuit City's sale price! aarrgh. Oh well. It's a great TV.", "Date": "April 30, 2006"}, {"Title": "Good Things Come to Those Who Wait", "Author": "Beres", "ReviewID": "R1LJVGI4T9QHM3", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This is my first HDTV. I've been waiting a several years for prices to go down and my preferences were Sony, Sharp, or Samsung. Sonys are still too expensive. The Sharp Aquos' picture was poor in comparison to either the Sony or Samsung. I was surprised since Sharps have good buzz. I originally wanted last year's model--329D, but oddly that model was more expensive. Initial consumer reviews were good about the 324 and the price was right. There were cheaper prices on the Internet but the store names were not familar to me and I didn't want to lose my money. As I was checking out, a popup offered a free trial to Amazon Prime. I got it shipped overnight for $3--sweet. Arrived in perfect condition, beaucoup connection ports, great picture, and I don't even have HDTV yet. The pic tends to be dark but that can be changed in the settings. As someone mentioned, it's so minor it's not worth bothering with unless you're a perfectionist. Would definitely recommend to anyone.", "Date": "May 7, 2006"}, {"Title": "A lightweight LCD with a powerful picture", "Author": "Tyson CN Becker", "ReviewID": "RSTY6VHOZ33NE", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Recieved this Samsung LCD two days ago and I have to say for the price, this TV is hard to beat.  I knew I was buying a 32 inch LCD for about 2 months and researched the Sharp Aquos model, the Sony XBR, and this one.  After much research and comparing of pictures I felt the Samsung was the best combination of price and picture.  The Sony XBR will give you a better picture, no doubt, but it is not such a jump that is justifies spending the $900 more to buy it.  I also thought the Sharp Aquos's picture looked a little washed out compared to this Samsung.I've been told that seeing TV's on display at Best Buy and Circuit City is a bad way to go about this because store managers tend to turn up the contrast or brightness on the TV's.  I never have understood this theory, I mean maybe they are trying to get rid of some inventory or something of that nature but has anyone tried playing with their brightness and/or contrast balance on thier TV's?  It helps but it doesn't make a crappy picture brilliant or vice versa.  Therefore when I went to Best Buy and saw the picture on the Samsung compared to the Sharp it was a no brainer for me which TV had the better picture.Anyways back to the actual TV.  I have Brighthouse Cable TV and run an HDMI cord from my Scientific Atlanta HD DVR to the TV and the picture is brilliant.  The HD picture is amazing, the first thing I turned to was HBO HD and Spiderman 2 was playing.  I watched the last half of it in amazment because the picture was that good.  My father in law and my father both have the 32 inch Sony XBR and although I did not have them side to side I felt the Samsung's HD picture was just as colorful and vibrant as the Sony XBR.The biggest differance I noticed between the XBR and this Samsung was how they handled SD TV.  The Sony is in my opinion is significantly better at handling SD TV than this Samsung (although the Samsung is also good).  Not only can it decode it better, it also has a screen streach called Wide Zoom (i think that's the name) that can actually put SD TV at 16:9 ratio and make it look very good.  The Samsung cannot do that and either can my cable box.  I can fill the screen but it becomes stretched beyond the border and look odd.  So I just watch SD in regular 4:3, which looks good, and let the HD shine when I turn it to my HD channels.I also ran my iBook G4 through the TV via the 15 pin VGA connector.  Looks amazing.  I've tried to run my iBook through other LCD before and it has never looked nearly as good as it does on this TV.  A great bonus because it wasn't really a factor in my buying decision.Last but not least I have my audio running from my cable box to my reciever so I have not really tested the speakers on this TV.  Sorry!Anyways in conclusion.  Great HD picture.  Two HDMI hookups which will give you a little bit of futureproof (Sony XBR only has 1)!  Very lightweight (I was very, very surprised at how light the actually TV is, you could carry it with one hand!) Easy to put the stand on and very easy to get working.  A great TV that is impossible to beat at the price Amazon is offering it for.  Go for it!PS  I would give this TV 4.5 stars if possible for the simple fact that the Sony XBR plays SD better.  However like I said earlier in my review it's not worth an extra $900.", "Date": "May 26, 2006"}, {"Title": "Fantastic LCD TV from Samsung", "Author": "Voltron00x \"Elias\"", "ReviewID": "R1GAZ5AIFZK2UV", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I was able to score a great deal on this TV - online, for $800 on Thanksgiving.  It took me four weeks to actually have it show up at my house (note that this wasn't ordered from Amazon.com), but its been worth the wait.  Out of the box, the TV is very sleek and attractive.  I have it hooked up to my DVR Cable Box via HDMI, which looks fantastic.  The HD channels are absolutely amazing to watch - I've watched NFL games, NBA, Dexter on Showtime, etc and they all look great.  Non-HD channels vary in quality - some are pretty ugly.  It helps to actually turn down the brightness / sharpness when watching regular TV.  Unless you're very close to the TV, thoguh, its not like its unwatchable.I also have a Sony Up-converting DVD Player hooked up through the second HDMI.  So far, I've used this to watch Pirates of the Caribbean 2, and Cars.  I watch Pirates first - the menu screen was awfully ugly, as was the movie itself.  For a few minutes, I was getting terribly disappointed - but its all a matter of playing around with settings.  Once I had the TV and DVD player set up correctly (which took about 10 minutes of trial and error) I found the right settings, and WOW.  Pirates looked absolutely INCREDIBLE.  You'd never know it was a regular DVD and not HD programing.  Ditto for Cars - so just a heads up, you DEFINITELY need to play with the settings on both the TV and whatever is outputting to the screen to make sure you have the right display settings.  I hooked the DVD player to my Sony surround system using a Digital Optical cable - the sound is great.Attached to the surround system are a PS2 and Nintendo Gamecube.  The surround system is hooked up to the regular A/V on the TV.  Playing videogames on this TV, even \"last gen\" games, is not a problem at all.  The graphics still look great - really it depends on the game's resolution more than anything.  A second digital optical cord runs from the TV to the Surround system, so any sound coming from the TV is muted and sent to the surround.  This is great, as it means everything I have hooked up will always play out of my surround speakers (cable TV, videogames, DVDs, etc).Finally, I have an Xbox 360 hooked up via the Component cables.  One of the reasons I wanted this TV is that Gamestop uses Samsung LCD monitors in their stores, and the 360s running there looked fantastic.  This TV has a \"Game Mode\" - and its awesome.  I was already playing Gears of War every day - now I can hardly put it down.  To say the graphics are incredible is an understatement.  To anyone who felt the 360 wasn't really \"next-gen\" enough, you need to play the games on an HD screen to really appreciate it.  The 360 also has a $199.99 HD-DVD add-on, which I couldn't pass up once I got the tv.  It comes with King Kong, which I thought was so-so as a film.  The HD-DVD itself is a great player, but I wasn't as \"Wowed\" by the video quality as I expected.  I need to try it again with a movie I like more, I suppose - V for Vendetta, Batman Begins, Superman Returns, and Serenity are all available for HD-DVD and I expect they'll look awesome.  I have to say though, if you pick up this TV, definitely pick up an up-converting HD-DVD player - I strongly recommend a Sony with HDMI capability, because it looks incredible and only set me back $100.I couldn't be happier with this TV.  In a few years, once 1080p TVs are cheaper, I'll upgrade and mount this one on a wall - this TV is very light by the way.  As its LCD, its relatively hassle-free - no worrying about burn-out or break-in periods.However, I have two small disappointments with this TV, both of which I expected due to the LCD format.  The viewing angles on this TV, compared to my old 32\" Flatscreen TV by Toshiba, are definitely not as good.  Don't get me wrong - they're not bad by any stretch of the imagination, but just not as good as my old \"regular\" TV was.  In addition, this TV definitely won't display dark, \"rich\" Black like a Plasma TV can.  When watching a Widescreen DVD, the \"black\" bars aren't quite as Black as I'm used to.  Its an issue with the LCD format, unfortunately - that's the price you pay for being able to leave your TV paused all day without concern.All told, I'm VERY happy with this purchase.  When doing my initial set-up, I had some issues getting the TV to detect my cable - just a heads-up, this TV can be a little cranky at times when it comes to detecting inputs if its already turned on.  Just turn it off and turn it on again if you've plugged or unplugged anything, and it'll catch them.  I called Samsung and didn't have to wait at all for customer service - they were great.If you're looking to pick up a mid-size, quality LCD HD TV, I can't recommend this thing enough.  Just be prepared to spend a little extra dough on HDMI cables and an up-converting DVD player.", "Date": "December 19, 2006"}, {"Title": "Appealing picture quality, watching HD programming is niiice", "Author": "W. Lynn", "ReviewID": "RH0L47UZI02MN", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "This is the first TV I've bought in a long long time, and I really wanted something that was fairly close to the cutting edge of technology.We (my wife and I) choose this model from a retailer storefront after deciding on LCD over plasma (don't need anything too big as we're in a 1 bedroom apartment) and over rear projection TVs (too fuzzy) and finding this price point acceptable. After this decision, we filtered out models to Sharp, Sony and Samsung based on looking at the pictures in-store. We looked not only at this model but at other size LCD TVs of the various brands and found as a general trend that we preferred the picture quality of these brands. I also liked the feature list although it's not quite as nice as it seems...Anyway, the best things about this are-The PICTURE! It does look great to my eyes and although of course this is subjective, I've really enjoyed watching HD programming and DVDs on this unit. I've never watched so much TV before.-The black finish, so pictures appear clearer and with better contrast (I don't see why TVs are made with silver frames, who cares if the TV looks good if it distracts from the brightness of the picture).-The built-in stereo speakers are decent.-Finally, I haven't noted any broken pixels (my pet gripe).The only problem of note we've had: With certain operations from our cable box there is a slight delay can confuse the TV and you pretty much have to do nothing for a couple secs before the TV stabilises. You get a large grey square on the screen during this time. I think its due to switching between channels/sources that are HD/SD (it think it autodetects the signal and adjusts the picture accordingly, and when you change too quickly the TV can't keep up).Other gripes (all fairly minor):Some features are not as full-featured as you might imagine, but you can't really tell without reading the manual. For example:1. Picture-in-Picture only works with different sources. You can't watch two channels from the same source using PiP. This makes the PiP feature close to useless for general TV viewing. (Fortunately, your cable box may have this feature anyway - mine does.)2. The computer input is limited to a standard VGA connector, not DVI. (There are HDMI inputs, yes, but these are different sources and the manual specifically states that these HDMI inputs can't be used for computers.)3. There is only one component video input. This is a bit limiting because all of your a/v devices (e.g. DVD player) might not have HDMI connections yet. If you want this level of video quality from say, both your DVD player and cable box you'd have to get yourself a component video switch (or unplug/re-plug 3 cables each time). When I first checked the specs on this model I didn't expect to be limited with connections.Overall, a very worthwhile purchase. I hope the lamp life is good so I can keep this TV for many years to come.", "Date": "June 13, 2006"}, {"Title": "Superb performance, incredible value for price!", "Author": "M. Sullivan", "ReviewID": "R3F3O3I49L8DZD", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "After much research into HD displays in our price range, I happily decided on the Samsung 32\" 41 series for our first foray into high definition viewing. Amazon of course was much less expensive than any local electronics or reputable online retailer by far. It arrived last week and we're thrilled with it. Our living room isn't huge, so it's the perfect size. It's just big enough for a great home theater experience, but not too big that it dominates the room. If you're looking for a TV that fits that criteria, 32\" is definitely the way to go.Just to reiterate what others have said, the TV is a bit dark out of the box, but a quick adjustment of the brightness setting alleviates that. Once you have all the settings to your liking, the picture is fantastic - very bright and sharp, with extremely vibrant colors. There is noticable trailing on the DTV stations occasionally, but that's to be expected with an LCD display. We've watched four DVDs already, and I've played several Xbox 360 games, and I haven't noticed any display quirks on either (I didn't even use the \"Game Mode\" and experienced no lag on my games). I'm using a component connection for the 360, because it doesn't have HDMI output, and games and movies in progressive scan look amazing. They say HDMI is the best, but I don't know how it could get any better. It would have been nice to have more than one component input, so I don't have to use the 360 for movies, but oh well.We pick up all the local stations in HD with a set of bunny ears, and they look great (besides the above mentioned trailing). Plus, there are a few stations we didn't even realize were broadcast, including 24-hour weather and music video stations. Bonus!The SRS TruSurround XT seems to be all hype--the sound is average at best. I definitely recommend hooking up the TV or your DVD player to a seperate speaker system as I did. It's also a bit disappointing that the Picture-In-Picture only works with two different input sources, so you can't watch two different TV stations at the same time. The remote is very easy to use and set up--it works seamlessly with my Samsung audio receiver, so I only need to use the one remote.Overall, my wife and I are completely satisfied with our purchase. The small negative points I've brought out in this review should be expected, and are moot against the overall performance of this display.

They tend to have the lowest end units on one end of the row and the best ones down at the other end. At the high end were Sony and Samsung units. Both were beautiful. As I already have a Samsung 21\" 213T SyncMaster PC monitor, I knew I would like Samsung. Honestly, the Sony had a more appealing bezel with it's high tech silver appearance. But what do you watch when you watch TV? I look at the screen. And Samsung was a little better.This LNS3241D unit is great. I have not owned any LCD TVs before this one, but I am very particular with anything that shows a picture. You won't be disappointed if you get this television. I live in a metro area and run it off of rabbit ears! No cable required to get instant HDTV. (A better antenna will only improve your experience, however).I also got the Mustang wall mount at the same time. Not required, but it is a substantial piece of equipment that will securely support your expensive TV.Best of all, and why I got it here, was that Amazon couldn't be beaten for best overall combined price/shipping/tax.

Simply put, I was waiting for: a) a more digestable price point for an HD set, and b) better functionality than earlier HD models. The Samsung LSN3241D certainly delivers on both accounts.Picture-wise, the LNS3241D is a stunner. Comparing nearly 10 similar units at a local Best Buy left the LNS3241D as the clear (pun intended) winner in this area. The 3000:1 contrast ratio goes a long way over competitors in the 700:1 and 800:1 range. Brightness and color spectrum contrasts are clear, in-program text a pleasure on the eyes (a must for sports programming). Related and for what its worth, I did not, however, perceive any immediate difference between Samsung's 3000:1 and 4000:1 contrast ratio sets (despite significant price point disparities.Warning: to truly maximize this unit, be prepared to spend hundreds dollars more on a TDMI cable. This expense + a wall mounting bracket (another $60-100 tab), however, proved well worth the money for HD programming (via Time Warner Cable with an TDMI output on their box). Only a few weeks in I admittedly and already feel deprived on standard programming channels, although 1080i mode gives these channels a nice boost.Audio in HD programming -- thanks to the TDMI cable -- is likewise crisp and rich. Worth noting, however, is that at 1/3rd volume levels some popping occurs through the TV's speakers. The much lauded Samsung sound system is solid but no Sony WEGA technology in this area (arguably the WEGA line's greatest asset).Second, the LNS3241D -- via a Time Warner, Scientific Atlanta HD DVR cable box -- has one critical flaw worth noting: it is incapable of intelligently resizing standard programming into widescreen. Be prepared to watch these channels in standard squares (vs. widescreen) with black bars sorrounding the frame. Zooming into widescreen mode (to overcome this flaw) distorts the picture, not recommended for detail-phobics [such as myself].Putting these flaws into perspective, however, the LNS3241D is a steal from a price versus feature perspective. Sharp (beautiful  picture) and Magnavox (nice all-around set) units can be had at comparitive price points, but both lack the functionality, technological compatibility, and quality control Samsung offers. This is not to say I wouldn't have loved a Sony WEGA; simply not worth -- in my opinion -- the 20-30% higher base price for this line.The subject header says it all for me. At this price and for my needs -- a mid-range, robust HD set -- the LNS3241D is a winner.", "Date": "July 27, 2006"}, {"Title": "Great TV, great bargain, but maybe not the best for picky gamers", "Author": "B. Lama", "ReviewID": "R26N87NZQD3UT0", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "Okay first let me say that most everything the other reviewers have said about this TV is true. I too saw this TV on display at Circuit City side by side with other LCD flat panels from Sony, Sharp and others, and looking at them all running the same video the Samsung picture quality was as good as or better than any of them, to my eyes. The only other TV's that were even close were the Sony (didn't look as good as the Samsung, but cost several hundred more), and a higher end Samsung of the same size (a couple hundred more for increased contrast ratio from 3000:1 to 4000:1, I can't say I saw a difference).The price was fantastic for this type of TV with the features it has. Circuit City just happened to have one available as an \"Open Box Deal\", a customer return or something to that effect. The TV was still in brand spanking new condition, still had the remote, manual, and everything, just no box, and I got it for $200 off their list price, so I payed about $1200. I expected to be paying more like $1500-1800 for a 32\" LCD HDTV to get a nice picture, so I went home that day very pleased with my purchase.Well... the TV is great and will probably satisfy 95% of people out there who want to upgrade to HDTV and/or flat panel. I, unfortunately, am one of the other 5%.The problem for me is that I primarily bought the TV to play video games on. And I am very picky about the picture when I'm playing games. Little things that might not bother most people can be a real annoyance to me.Issue #1 - Though much improved over what I was used to seeing with older LCD monitors, and even with Samsung boasting a lightning-fast repsonse time of 8ms (one of the fastest I've seen advertised, only the Aquos is advertised faster that I know of at 6ms), there was still VERY noticeable blurring of finer details when things were moving. I hooked up an Xbox 360 and ran a first person game (Elder Scrolls: Oblivion for you gamers), which is a gorgeous and VERY finely detailed game. In an outdoor scene, I immediately noticed that when I would move, all the fine details like all of the individual leaves on trees or blades of grass would go out of focus very noticeably. And then when I would stop moving it would take a split second for everything to get back in focus. Even my wife, who is about 10,000x less picky about things like that and often doesn't notice things I complain about on TV pictures, asked why it was doing that before I even pointed it out to her! A sign to me that it is actually something the average person will notice easily.Issue #2 - While this TV does offer a very high contrast ratio (3000:1 claimed) that does look very good in scenes where you have a very bright colorful scene or a mixed light and dark colored scene, I found that it does NOT look good on primarily dark scenes. If the scene is mostly dark with just a small portion of light/colorful/white elements, the lighter elements will appear cloudy or greyish. Perfect example, I popped in Gran Turismo 4 on the PS2, and the first screen is all black with one line of large white text in the center, and the white text should be a bright bright white, instead it was a dingy light grey. Another example from the same game, when you are viewing the car buying screen where the background is mostly black and dark grey, a bright colored car like a yellow or red will appear washed out or greyish instead of vibrant.Which seems to be an effect of Issue #3... What it appears to me is that the backlight of the LCD trys to adapt by adjusting brighter for mostly bright scenes and dimming for mostly darker scenes. It is very noticeable when the scene shifts rapidly from dark to light, you will see the scene shift, and then a split second later you will see the whole screen brightness level very suddenly change.This 'blinking' along with the fact that a mostly dark screen with colorful elements will show the colors to be washed out and very low contrast looking means that, although you are USUALLY getting a great, high contrast and very vibrant picture, in the end it is a very unconsistently great picture. Add to that the blurring effect and I am very unsatisified with this TV as far as playing games on it. And I have spent HOURS adjusting every possible setting for the picture with no luck of alleviating these issues.I am left to wonder if maybe this TV isn't maybe defective in some way, hence why it was an \"Open Box Deal\" to begin with. BUT, I have done a lot of reading online since buying this TV and found that at least the issue of the blurring seems to be a well known and commonly accepted issue with LCD's. As I said, I just be one of the extreme minority of picky consumers. As far as the blinking issue, the way it happens it seems to be a purposeful design, not some type of defect.Lastly, I should mention that I am also a fan of older video games (think Nintendo, Super Nintendo and Sega Genesis), and when I hooked a couple of these older systems up to this TV the picture just looked horrible, but I think this is just an effect of running a very low resolution image on such a high resolution TV, which is something you hear people complain about when viewing regular, non digital TV signals on HDTV's as well, so is not really a fault of this particular TV.Now, with all that having been mentioned, I will say that when I popped in a couple DVD movies, the TV performed beautifully, very nice, sharp, colorful picture. Were I only a movie buff who wanted a nice 'home theater' experience but didn't have space or money for one of the truly large HDTV's, this TV would work perfectly. So for anyone who is just looking for exactly that, watching and movies and regular TV, I would rate the TV a 5 for having a wonderful picture, great features, tons of inputs, and being an excellent value.But for playing video games, I can only rate the TV a 2. And since I rarely ever even watch TV, and I use my TV probably 80% for video gaming, I am unhappy and will be returning this TV today and getting a large screen Sony Wega CRT TV. The Wega line, by the way, still has what I consider to be the BEST picture available for any type of gaming.

M. Hernandez", "ReviewID": "R1V3WGBAT2UUGS", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I just purchased this TV from a local Circuit City on sale for $999 ($100 more than Amazon's current price). I did a lot of research and this TV or other Samsung's in the same line have the best picture quality on the market *for any price*. Even the Sony LCDs that went for almost double this price actually have Samsung screens in them, so go figure. The images are crystal clear on 1080i and the black levels and color reproduction are spot on. You literally cannot go wrong with this TV.  I primarily play video games on this TV, I got it just for my Xbox360. The games look amazing on this TV. The graphics look better than I have ever seen them before. Text in games like Dead Rising is totally sharp and readable. Some games, like PGR, almost look real. Gears of War looks simply unbelievable. Samsung included a 'game mode' on the TV with help from Microsoft engineers which optimizes the picture for Xbox360 HD. It really gives the image a vibrant more arcade look to it.  Don't cheap out and get one of those off-brand HDTVs, its worth the investment. I have seen LCD HDTVs my friends got from random off-brands and there is a noticable difference. Something about the picture on this TV just makes it \"pop\" more. Some games almost look like 3d. Watching HD discovery channel makes you feel like you are looking out a window on a plane, its that real. Also, the Samsungs handle SD content very well compared to any other LCD HD on the market. I watched some standard DVDs and they almost looked like HD-DVD on this screen. On cheaper sets the SD picture looks very blurry and grainy with compression artifacts. Not here. Everything I plugged in (via component cables) looked great. Even the Nintendo Wii connected through composite still looked decent. Standard SD broadcast programming looked pretty good as well, not much different than watching on a high-end SDTV.If you are looking for an LCD HDTV for under $1000, then this is definately the TV you want to get. Like I said, I have been to multiple stores and looked at just about every HDTV line on the market and this one is the best overall. The picture quality out-of-box is great and after tweaking a few settings it looked amazing. There are a few small annoyances, like it having only one component input, but otherwise its a great TV. The picture is great, the sound is decent, it has a nice remote, the case is very nice looking. I literally couldnt be happier with this TV.

We did purchase a Samsung HD DVD850 upconverting dvd player and the 2 of them together are unbelievable.  High Graphic widescreen at its finest and the digital WOW SRS audio is very good through the TV speakers.  The TV and DVD remotes are even interchangable!  Couldn't be easier.  I sure hope the HD digital cable comes soon!I am so pleased with the Samsung LNS3241D! It took all of 2 minutes to take this set out of its box, plug it in, and begin to enjoy it. We currently receive SDTV via digital cable (HDTV coming soon I hope!) and the picture is actually quite good.  Some channels are better than others for some reason?  My son's xbox 360 looks almost 3D and crystal clear - brilliant colors and crisp graphics.  Watched a dvd on the xbox and was very impressed with the clarity.  Have ordered a Samsung up-converting dvd player and assume these two componants will get along splendidly.The TV remote is straightforward and the set-up menus are easily navigated.Pricing through one of Amazon's sellers was over $500.00 less than BestBuy and no sales tax! Shipping was $39.00 and took only 2 days in transit! Also no high pressure extended service contract.  I figure we saved nearly $800.00 total!Sound quality is actually very good - not theatre-like by any means - but most realistic people wouldn't expect two little speakers to rattle windows or flutter pants legs.This TV is perfect for a family room or recreation room.

While it is hard to trust these retailers with proper calibration of the picture, the Samsung LNS3241D 32\" LCD blew away the Sony and the Sharp AQUOS 32\" LCD (my second choice).  The 3000:1 contrast ratio is one of the highest available.  The picture is extremely bright...colors are brilliant, great whites, pretty good blacks.  SD picture is ok...much better than my previous Samsung 50\" rear projection hdtv but not the best.  HD picture is awesome-amazing detail and clarity.  I am hooked up via component cables and can't wait for my HDMI cable/Monster Power Center to arrive.  My only gripe with the picture (and it is a minor one) is that the image is so clear you can see a bit of a blur in fast-moving objects-apparently this is common with the LCD technology.  Sound is so-so but if you're spending this much on a TV then buy some speakers for God's sake.  If you want to pay $1500 more for a Sony XBR, go ahead, but for the money this TV is pretty sweet.

The resolution is great. It is using 1080i (Does not support 1080p which is the \"progressive\" version).Dvd is connected with a component (RGB) cable. The picture was a little on the darker side which caused problems spotting details in dark (i.e. night) scenes. By increasing the brightness this was resolved. It has several display 'modes' that you can select as presets. This makes switching between brightness modes easy. I also connected a computer to the vga connector (hoping to switch it out to a dvi to hdmi cable soon). The panel supports the computer in 1360x768 widescreen.It also has digital audio (optical) out which I use for all digital 5.1 audio signals (it is easier than connecting seperate cables).Overall I am very pleased with this LCD TV.

I was at first disappointed, but the more I watch this, the more pleased I am with the purchase.  Plasma is obviously high end, but I've heard wicked rumors about how fragile they are.  LCD is very nice and very light and manageable.  The misc. projection televisions afford the larger images at much cheaper prices, but sacrifice weight - what I learned in a nutshell.It has a hook-up for just about anything and everything you can imagine.  Red/Green/Blue things for the high-end video hook-up (I suggest a top-of-the-line DVD player and/or receiver to utilize this), an S-video connection (next best video), two or three standard video hookups (the red/white/yellow, which is the oldest technology), an HDTV hookup (still waiting for the HD cable service) and a PC monitor hookup if you're crazy enough to use this as a monitor.  The energy saving quick-button is nice for quickly adjusting the brightness - I've found that daytime watching vs. nighttime/all lights out movie watching requires it.  The sleep functions toggles in 30min intervals up to 180 minutes for those epic movies.  The biggest gripe I have as someone else did is about the speakers - not the greatest in the world.  They sound ok but if you're expecting any kind of base, get a sound system.  They are adequate for casual watching so you don't have to keep turning on the amp to get solid sound unless you've got 2.3 kids and 1.5 pets.  It will stretch any fullscreen picture to fit the widescreen and keep the settings per input (DVD widescreen vs. TV fullscreen doesn't require a toggle each time you change).Overall, a very user-friendly piece of equipment.

I did a lot of research, and have been told these screens have relatively few defects. The one I received was perfect.

I have a pair of $100 Klipsch Pro media speakers that put the sound on this tv to shame. The bass from the tv is non existant to horrible. I'm not talking about blasting rap.

Three big problems....The biggest problem, a problem that exists with this and other Samsung LCDs, is how poor the image quality is when watching any programming with lots of blacks.  You can not differentiate between any of the shades. Everything comes out to be one amorphous black blob.  If for example, you have an image of a person wearing a gray suit and walking in the night, you just see their bright face float in sea of black.  At first I thought this was a problem with my over-the-air HD signal, and not the TV itself, but when I watched DVDs with an upconvert DVD player, I noticed the exact same problem.  I adjusted the image settings until my face turned blue, called Samsung twice, zero success.  This was very, very annoying, not to mention surprising since the contrast ratio is 3000:1, far better than any other TV in the same price range.  I bet other TVs (Toshiba, Phillips, Sharp) have better contrast even though their contrast ratios are less.  Oh... Forgot to mention, I can differentiate between blacks far better on my 15 year old 20'' Mitsubishi CRT.Also, on a completely black screen (i.e. programming with a shot of the night sky, or no programming and having the TV on an input with no signal) you see white splotches on all four corners of the screen.  This other annoying feature became apparent after the first week of watching, and was not present in the first few days.  It's almost as if the TV \"warmed up\" to have this defect.  I suspect this is a variation of the clouding issue (\"mura\" defect, search for it on google, see for yourself on the AVS forums) that is seen most evidently with Sony XBRs AND Samsungs.  Keep in mind that Samsung and Sony LCDs are made on the same assembly line.When watching fast moving images, the \"ghosting\" effect is definitely seen.  This is a problem with many LCDs, so it's not just this TV.I bought this TV on bestbuy.com on Thanksgiving Day for $800.  I however have no regrets about returning it, even though I got it for an unbeatable deal.  Some people reading this may think that I am being too picky, considering how much I paid.  Let me assure you that I am NOT.  I am a medical resident, work ridiculous hours, and make about 40K a year for working 100+ hours a week.  My money is HARD earned.

I brought it from Bestbuy during thanksgivings sale(799$+taxes) at a very good price. I am very happy with it performance so far. Here are few things that would help you decided about wheather this TV is for you or not.Pros.1. Good colors & contrast i think only TV having better colors is Sony Bravia.2. Very slim and good looking.3. Have 2 HDMI inputs so will be easy to use with any relatively new DVD player or home theater.4. Provide RBG input for pluging in the computer directly. This is one feature I use a lot and I love it.Cons.1. Only provides you 720p resolution.2. Only have 1 component input which can a limitation sometimes.3. Speaker are decent but will strongly recommend to use home theater to enjoy the HD program or movies.4. Feel little (just a little) small now and thought would have been better to buy a 40'' one as now I have a bigger living home.5.

They were very helpful and friendly.When I first got the TV I thought something might've been wrong with it since my picture was worse than my previous TV using the same DirecTV box.  As much as I adjusted it the picture was blurry, moving objects left trails and the picture seemed to scroll.

I knew that my budget had to be under $1,000 and I wanted the largest tv for my money.  Therefore I knew LCD was the way to go and was pleasantly surprised to see a variety of quality televisions at up to 32\" for under a grand.  I narrowed down the huge list to this, a Panasonic, and the Samsung that is one step up from this one.  I originally purchased the Panasonic when its price went down but it got damaged in transit and it got sent back.  This one popped up for $820 with free shipping and I knew the getting was good so I got it.  The three tv's I was gunning for are all great televisions and I knew I would be happy no matter what I got.  In a nutshell, I am 100% satisfied with this television. I will list the pros and cons of this tv:PROS:-Built in tuner gets over the air HD picture that looks fantastic-Menus are great and easy to navigate, the remote is well made and designed-Settings are easy to change and picture settings are saved for each input-2 HDMI ports are a plus though I am not using both yet-Built-in speakers are actually very nice.  I thought about hooking up my external computer speakers but I decided it is unnecessary.-Matte black finish does not distract (the higher priced model has shiny finish that might get distracting)-Picture looks fantastic: sharp with good natural color and reasonably good contrast-Wide viewing angle-NO dead pixels!  I was very worried about this and was pleasantly surprised to find none-dvds look fantastic with a progressive scan or upconverting dvd player-Standard definition programs look fineCONS: disclaimer: many of these cons are standard for LCD tvs and do not reflect poorly on this tv specifically.-No true blacks (though I find with energy saving mode on low the blacks are pretty good)-Pixelization or ghosting during rapid movement: This is a standard problem with LCD tvs.  It is most noticable when fire or water is on the screen.  I don't watch much sports so it does not bug me.  But there is an interesting note that I have not seen on other reviews: the pixelization and ghosting only occur while watching television programs.  Pop in a dvd and it does not happen.  I don't know why but I am much happier for it.-LCDs will never look as good as CRT tv's, and the only way to compensate is with HD picture.  LCD tv's really need HD picture to look good, so you will have to add an extra $200 to your purchase with cables and high def players and so on.-I only have one or two specific criticisms of this television.  The most frustrating is the picture size option.  On the menu, you are given the option of 4:3, 16:9, zoom1 or zoom 2.  but for virtually all programming and dvds, the zoom options are disabled and I can't figure out how to get them to work.  This becomes aggravating when I stumble upon non-anamorphic dvds and tv programs broadcast in 4:3 but with a widescreen picture.  This gives the effect of a box within a box that is not very fun to watch.  I don't mind sacrificing picture quality if I don't have to feel like I have tunnel vision.-There are some light leaks in the screen.  There is a large one on the upper left and tiny ones on each of the corners.  It is completely unnoticable except for watching dark scenes of movies when I have the lights off, but it is a problem nontheless.  Other reviewers of this model notice a similar problem-This is a small thing, but I wish I could control how much the tv overscans and how the picture is centered on the screen.  I've seen the option on other widescreen tvs and it is a great tool for finicky programs.Overall, this television is a great buy and I highly recommend it.  Compared to other tv's in its price range, like the Sharp Aquos and the Phillips, this tv has superior picture and sound.  It has better menus than the Panasonic and a better overall design than the more expensive Samsung.  The problems this tv has are mostly the problems that all LCD tv's have and they are relatively minor.  I know this is can be an anxiety-inducing process, but you can rest assured that you will be happy if you buy this television.", "Date": "May 8, 2007"}, {"Title": "So far so good", "Author": "Richard S.

I am going to stores, looking online, and trying to find the best price.  As I was looking at this tv, I also considered the 51D model, but it was too glossy and shiny for me, and I didn't think I would be using enough high-end equipment to showcase 4000:1 ratio instead of the 3000:1 ratio.So, out of the box, I was blown away.  I had high expectations, but I plugged in my old rabbit ear antenna, and had some of the most amazing over the air broadcasts in HD.  I could not believe it.  It looked better then my parents TV that was running HD over satellite, but I think their tv quality was not as good.  So, if you are in an area that receives strong signals, and you don't want to pay for Satellite or cable, you will not be disappointed.  Plus, there are a ton of Digital broadcast stations out there that you never knew existed.  My favorite is The Tube (old school music videos), great to have on in the background at a party.  The first game I watched on the OTA broadcast was the BCS championship, and I was floored the entire game.  I think my wife got tired of hearing me say, \"this looks absolutely amazing.\"I bought an unpconverting DVD player, connected via HDMI, and it looks great, but I don't really know if it was worth it.  I am not sure if upconverting really changes anything that drastically, so oh well.  I have my old Xbox connected via component cables, and it changed the way my games look.  It is wonderful, even though Xbox games will be slowly phased out.  We just got Satellite service with over 35 HD channels, and it is awesome.  I am completely satisfied with the purchase.  I made some adjustments to the picture settings after I looked up some specs online.  Basically I typed in \"picture setting LNS3241d\" in google and found someone's post on the topic.Shipping- I was crossing my fingers on this, but it worked out perfectly.  Actually, they had been trying to call us for a few days to set up a delivery time, but our phone was going dead.  I found this out on a Sunday night, called their 800 number, told them the problem, found out they were 20 miles away and open 24 hours, so I told them I would be there in 30 minutes.  Picked it up in person and was happy with the experience.A final note:  I went back and forth on the extended warranty.  I ended up buying it completely with my American Express card because it automatically adds another year to the warranty.  So, for nothing extra I get a two year warranty.

The picture is crisp and breathtaking with HDTV.  The HD movie channels are amazing.

This set top box, for optimal HD output, must be set to 1080i mode. If you set it to 480i or a similarly lower configuration, your HD picture will have black bars at the top and bottom. Setting the set top box to 1080i will give you full screen, awesome quality HD picture.However, in the 1080i mode, the regular programs (standard definition) such as Seinfeld, etc. will appear with black bars at the sides, and there is no way to have the picture fill the entire screen. Note: it is possible to do this if the set top box is configured to 480i, or if the cable is connected directly to the TV. But for HD, you'll want to have it set through the set top box with 1080i, and will have to live with black bars while watching standard programming.Second disappointment. Applies to people who connect to use a Sony Vaio laptop to this TV.The Sony Vaio laptops and this TV currently do not interoperate. I've tried all possible things to get it to work and have been through support calls with both Samsung and Sony, but I cannot get the PC output on the LCD. Apparently, Samsung is not able to render the Sony Vaio output. This was a pretty big disappointment for me, because I planned to watch DVDs by playing them on the laptop and connecting it to the TV. If you plan to connect a Vaio to your LCD TV, I don't recommend you buy this one.To summarize - Great HD picture, nice physical appearance, cannot display standard def. pictures in full screen in 1080i mode, does not work with Sony Vaio laptops.", "Date": "December 30, 2006"}, {"Title": "Buyer Beware", "Author": "John P.

That's not enducing confidence in this TV for me.My 24inch Dell TV is great at the factory defaults -- with a screen perfectly bright set at the halfway point of brightness.The picture zoom feature is pretty dreadful.  Most LCD TV's have an option to zoom a 4:3 picture but retain the original aspect ratio (makes the 4:3 picture bigger but with only a little stretching of the source image).  With this TV, the zoom options cut off large portions of the edges of the video.  I dont know any other TV manufacturer that makes zoom work like that.

I mean, my 15 year-old RCA can still put out a decent picture, so why should I change? Also, the HD offerings of Time Warner are sparse unless you want to shell out some bucks.

Nguyen", "ReviewID": "R4OMEVRZOWXKI", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I was looking for a TV for the bedroom that was similar to my Philips 42in LCD ($[...] at Costco) that has a built in ATSC tuner, which is supposedly the same as a HDTV tuner. (In addition to my regular cable channels, I get over 300 digital channels including radio stations with my 42in Philips...which is great because I love the KQED Life channel.) This Samsung model seemed to have what I was looking for. Good price, good quality, and most important an ATSC tuner. What actually made me choose the Samsung over the Philips 32PF7421D or the LG 32LC2D was that it had a PIP feature and I was able to find a price match on Amazon and got it for ~$[...] with tax. (It's on sale now for $1100)So, first, the Tuner doesn't work without an antenna. I suppose I can get an over-the-air antenna but the channels are limited in this area and KQED Life isn't one of the channels I'd be able to get [...] OR pay Comcast $[...]/month for the HD service and receiver, but that means having additional hardware to enjoy this TV. Which means, I could have been better off saving more money by getting an LCD monitor instead of an LCD TV because I can't even use the HDTV Tuner with my current configuration. (Now I'm comparing the Samsung to my 17\" wide screen Sharp LCD TV Monitor I use as my computer monitor. It's just the same. It has a PIP feature, component slots and composite slots.) And unlike the Philips, which integrates the digital channels with the analog channels for continuous surfing, you'd have to switch between surfing the analog channels then to the antenna channels with an additional button.Second, the PIP. It doesn't work with analog signals (unless the PIP is the PC or a HDMI signal.) So, that means you can't watch two different shows at the same time. Even if you had a digital signal, you wouldn't be able to watch two different digital channels either. There goes enjoying more than one sports game on HD during the sports seasons! What a disappointment. It's mainly for HDMI signals with a digital channel or for the use of the PC connection and the TV.So, either the 42\" Philips has a hidden antenna inside that's picking up all those extra channels or this Samsung is lacking. I'm returning this tomorrow and heading to Costco. Might just downgrade even further to a 32\" Sceptre, but at least I'll save $[...] and will have my HD and digital channels without any additional hardware. And if I'm disappointed with that, at least I didn't spend $[...].Would I recommend this? No. BUT, if you don't mind a PIP feature that's not completely PIP or getting an antenna to receive limited over-the-air channels, or getting the HD service with an additional box to add to your collection of DVD player, VCR, XBox, DVR, and Receiver, go for it.", "Date": "March 4, 2007"}, {"Title": "order HDTV via Amazons'", "Author": "Bay T.
