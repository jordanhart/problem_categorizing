I didn't want to get an HDTV because I didn't think I would like the new shape. However, once my husband set up the monitor and tweaked it the way he wanted it to look, he showed it to me. The picture was so clear and the colors are so vivid that I didn't even notice the new aspect ratio. He picked a winner. My husband heard that Pioneer has sold their technology rights Panasonic for their V10 series Plasma TVs because they are not going to make TVs any more. We will be buying that Plasma TV when we go to get our next one. :~)", "Date": "January 31, 2010"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "Unavailable", "Features": "Resolution: 1920 x 1080 - Aspect Ratio: 16:9", "Name": "Pioneer Elite Signature Series PRO-101FD 50\" Plasma T", "ImgURL": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/31nLLqMyd-L.jpg", "ProductID": "B001HDWYX0"}}
