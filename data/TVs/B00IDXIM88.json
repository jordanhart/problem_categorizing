It looks like Samsung threw us a curveball this year.  the 8000 series features the curved screen.  Its great but, we found ourselves wishing it was a flat screen.  Its quite possibly because we haven't had a curved screen, since we ditched the tube tv's more than 12 years ago, when upgrading to big screen projections.That's right, I said projection.  Thank heavens we don't have those giant machines sitting in our homes anymore.  Then again, if yours still works, keep on using it.  However, for $500 more, you can upgrade to a 4k ultra tv by samsung below:http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00ID2HI8O/ref=as_li_qf_sp_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&camp;=1789&creative;=9325&creativeASIN;=B00ID2HI8O&linkCode;=as2&tag;=willbeusingad-20This tv is great but, the future is 4k and don't have any regrets when purchasing your next tv.  Think back when you purchased your last ultimate dvd player, around the time when blu-ray came out and then had your regrets, don't do it here.", "Date": "April 13, 2014"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": null, "Features": null, "Name": null, "ImgURL": null, "ProductID": "B00IDXIM88"}}
