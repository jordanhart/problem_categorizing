Before Black Friday there weren't any reviews for this particular model television. I figured if I didn't like it I would simply return it. I am so, so, glad I purchased it! I also purchased one for my mother. Initially, I was extremely skeptical about the purchase. My assumptions were something will be inferior to the point of disappointment. The  Element truly rocks!  The picture is super bright and crisp. There are plenty of inputs available and the sound quality is astonishing. No wonder, its JBL. It is very hard to get this much television without it being a refurbished unit or open-box. 50 inches is a decent size viewing area for most people. Probably the best thing about the television is the small bezel size and light weight. You will not be disappointed in this unit. Even for $500 it is very competitive. For what its worth, I can remember when Vizio were on the \"value-friendly \" side. Now they dominate. Happy viewing.", "Date": "December 28, 2013"}, {"Title": "Mediocre tv", "Author": "Sara Maire", "ReviewID": "R1183CHAHS2RX0", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I bought this TV as a Black Friday deal at a retail store for around $250. The picture is a little dull even off the \"electricity saving\" option. We also had batter quality on our HD channels on the old tv that wasn't hd. It's not a bad tv but it isn't great and it sure isn't worth over what we paid for it.", "Date": "December 4, 2013"}, {"Title": "scalpers", "Author": "mikequillm", "ReviewID": "RLAPF9E5RQKC2", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I too stood in line for this tv at target. And just like the guy selling this one I only paid $230.00 for it. These slime bags are called scalpers. They buy up everything they can at low prices and then jack up the price to sell to you. Sad really. Means two or three people in line who would have enjoyed that tv at home have to pay more. I'm really enjoying mine and no problems so far. Wait for superbowl sunday. Most people don't know this but you can get great tv deals on that day too. This is a good tv. Set up for all kinds of inputs. Good color and picture. And the sound truly surprised me", "Date": "December 3, 2013"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "$699.99", "Features": "Video Resolution: HD - 1080p\nMaximum Resolution: 1920 x 1080\nScreen Refresh Rate: 60 Hz\nBrightness(cd/m2): 350\nTelevision Features: Sleep Timer, JPEG Viewer Program, Wide Viewing Angles, Built-in JBL Soundbar and Subwoofer, Picture Freeze, V-Chip (Parental Controls), Favorite Channels", "Name": "Element 50\" Full HD 1080P LCD HDTV", "ImgURL": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51C4Sz0JYcL._SX300_.jpg", "ProductID": "B009D18GOY"}}
