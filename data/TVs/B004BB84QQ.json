I read all the reviews on just about every website. I think most are negative.I got the tv 2 hours ago and i wall mounted it in my 3 year old's room.I just love it. For $298 .00 i can stream netflix wirelessly, I can also access my Nas that has all of our ripped movies to mpeg-2 format and wirelessly stream it all.I can also watch my amazon prime free tv shows. Bottom line for the price i am getting more that i should have.it is not slow like i read in most review. As soon as i turned it on and setup the wifi it updated its firmware/software on its own. 20 mins later we were watching netflix and now my son is watching a movie that is stored in my media nas.

Yes mine did an update also, but the whole process took maybe 10-15 minutes. Wasnt that bad of a wait...The picture is very sharp. Lots of connections. No, I did not buy mine from amazon. I paid a little more than amazon price, but since then amazon's price has gone up to nears what I paid.I noticed these 24\" Sony Google tv's seem to get low ratings, however only 8 left on amazon as I type, so someone besides me likes this tv.The tv is not a thin tv. Its very heavy and has a deep cabinet. Built solid. I use it as a desktop tv next to my pc.The one thing that irks me is this tv does not have VUDU. Wish it did. I have a lot of vudu movies on my vudu account. Hope they add vudu. Somewhere I read that was the plan. So far no other word on this.I was worried the tv 24\" would be too big for a desktop. It is just right. The metal stand takes up very little room opposed to other smaller tv's with the typical round base stand. Comes with a wall mount, that I didnot use. I like the google remote. Full featured. Small but well designed button wise. A lot to learn. A lot of features. Comes with only an included brief mini manual. Full detailed user manual only available online thru the tv. First I thought they forgot to include the manual in the box. Then I discovered the detailed complete manual is online. There is a link for quick access to the full detailed manual in the tv menu. 4 stars only because of no VuDu service. Black trim front around screen, back of the set housing is all white, along with the silver metal wire stand. In all a sharp looking tv physically.Once we only had WebTv as the only option for intergraded tv-internet. Now Sony and google match up for real internet tv.

I've played with AppleTV and tried various setups hooking up PC or Mac to a TV screen. At $300, Google TV built into a 24inch screen is a great deal. I think Google TV is my favorite setup for situations where I have cable, especially the basic digital cable box I have, because it adds a guide. The basic digital cable box from Frontier doesn't have any kind of channel guide, but with Google TV, I have it! Plus, I get my Netflix and can browse the internet. Tons of streaming content is made easily available. The remote is ok but I downloaded a free app for my iPhone which is convenient because I always have my phone handy anyway, so 1 less object to fall between the cushions.A 24\" 1080p TV for $300 is pretty good deal, but I don't need to add on another $80 for Roku box and more cables, this would be a good, cost effective setup for rooms that don't have cable/antenna, too.I was able to get the cable box set up pretty easily, and Google TV figured out the IR codes to blast at the cable box very easily, so I can tuck the cable box behind the TV where I can't see it. One thing that wasn't obvious is that the Component inputs double as composite inputs. I just put my Yellow composite cable into the Green component input and it auto-detected. Trying to use the Coax connection from my cable box didn't work too well because Google TV assumes a coax is some sort of antenna and does a channel scan without the ability to set up that input as a cable box controlled by IR blast.Here are the things I'd like to see:- Built-in DVR. I know it would be another $100 in price for the hardware, but would be killer feature.- Let me access media on my local network. Who uses USB for their media? It should be able to access movies and music from my MacPro (which I can from Roku, with some hacking. Apple TV does this inherently and XBox has similar features.) I may be able to do this through the browser but the browser isn't great (see next item)- Needs an Amazon video app. I can get Amazon instant videos through the browser, but using the browser to find movies is challenging because must use the \"mouse\" feature. An app like on Roku would be fantastic.- Should be able to control cable boxes hooked up via the coax.- I'm not sure this would be great for hooking up video game boxes. I think newer XBoxes have HDMI support, which is what you need to hook up and control multiple devices. Another component input would be good.", "Date": "August 12, 2011"}, {"Title": "Disappointing, at best...", "Author": "William Schaefer \"Billytech\"", "ReviewID": "R1XN9ZAGBCU445", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "Where to begin ... I purchased this TV because I like to watch TV in the kitchen.I could eliminate my laptop and use Facebook and Netflix without any other boxes to connect. It's wireless 802.11 so I won't even have to run a network line to it. Awesome. So I thought. The TV arrived, and I placed it on the wall in place of the Viewsonic I was replacing. It works fine, I was upgrading. So I thought. After the updates were done uploading, which took hours... (I'll get back to that) I connected my sattelite dish and it came on. The picture was clear, but didn't compare to the Viewsonic. I figured out how to get to the picture settings  menu,(Hold down Fn button then press \"1/settings\" button at the same time) and turned off the eco mode, maxxed the backlight and Contrast, and got a slightly brighter picture that was still dark. Hmmm... , Then I checked the online connection to find it had \"one bar\" of signal, even though the router is three feet away, and my Laptop signal, sitting beside the TV was at full signal. Hmmm...(Explaining the SLOOOOW update)I could not even get Netflix to work because it paused to buffer every ten seconds. I ran a network line. Netflix now worked fine. I turned up the volume. New disappointment/problem. The speakers are small, and face down. I have to turn the volume half way up to hear the TV if I'm more than two feet away from it, But it gets muffled, and the plastic cabinet vibrates like heck. I solved this with a pair of USB powered laptop speakers that now sit on either side of the TV.In summary, I didn't know you could even buy a TV with a picture this dim. The sound is absolutely lousy. The WiFi is useless, a wired connection is NECESSARY to use Netflix or web surfing. The picture quality is mediocre at best, and it has a \"Glossy second screen\" covering the LCD that does not help matters. Google TV is this set best feature, but unless you're completely comfortable with complicated menus when you want to adjust ANY feature of this TV, it's simply not for you.I kept this TV because I got it so cheap, and had an Amazon gift certificate, but suffer buyers remorse daily.

It's up to owner to navigate without much information which makes for a frustrated customer. A customer fan-fold instruction sheet comes with the Google-TV but is VERY limited, if useful at all. The SETUP is extremely brief and needs documentation to at least dial in sound/picture quality.  The TV is not buyer-savvy ready. The picture is so-so as long as you're standing directly front of the screen. The remote control is sensitive and works well, but there is no immediate return channel button. The \"go-back\" button will cycle through everything you have done within the last 10 attempts. Audio is limited to 5 to 8 feet in front, after which your need to pump it up HARD! This is not good for others in surrounding rooms. Biggest complaint is Wi-Fi receiver is deaf! The Wi-Fi doesn't work unless you're within VERY close proximity and often times the Wi-Fi will \"disconnect\" and throw the receiver off-line, as well as just making it difficult to check your email. The overall complaint is...Wi-Fi is extremely limited to only direct line-of-sight RF reception. For the price, it ought to work a lot better and I find this TV receiver is worth $199 and not much more. SONY has to work out the kinks in the Wi-Fi, the audio and picture luminescence.

The good news is that they both have lots of features. The bad news is.....that they both have lots of features. Operating the TV and the remote requires a bit of brain retooling that isn't as wife-friendly as I would have liked.Google TV and the blackberry-like remote are great for web activity and complex operations, but not so great for changing channels in a dark room. Or for making simple video adjustments (several menu levels are required). I suppose Sony's intent is for the user to use the thumb \"mouse\" and onscreen menus, but that's not always convenient (especially when the video goes away during the adjustment). A backlit remote would be very useful for dim situations. Even better would be a second \"simple\" remote with large buttons dedicated to volume and channel adjustments.The display viewing angle is not as good as my other LCD sets, perhaps because of the edge LED lighting that (I think) is used in this 24\" model. We have the set on top of a bedroom dresser, about 5 feet off the floor, and the screen was almost invisible when viewed from the adjacent bed. So I had to prop the rear portion of the stand to tilt the screen down quite a bit. And the display always seemed a bit dim even when I thought I set it to maximum brightness. Fortunately, I found some tips on the net aimed at optimizing the screen on this particular Sony model. They made a huge improvement, most likely due to disabling the auto light sensor that I didn't know was there. It's adjustment is on a menu for power features (\"eco\"), not for picture adjustment. The optimized settings I found are duplicated here:Picture Mode =  CinemaBacklight =  10Picture =  77Brightness =  53Color =  50Color Temp = Warm 2Sharpness = 0Noise Reduction =  OffMPEG Noise Reduction =  OffCineMotion = AutoBlack Corrector = OffAdv.Contrast Enhancer = LowGamma = 0Live Color = OffLight Sensor = OffSo I can recommend this Sony if you want an advanced Google TV with lots of features and a so-so display.

It has it's drawbacks, I will address those first.The TV has some SERIOUS input lag. Meaning that any hardcore gamers should avoid this TV. Moving the joystick on an Xbox controller results in a delay, then movement on the screen. To the average gamer such as myself, this isn't a big deal, but any hardcore COD or Halo player will hate it. That being said, I play Portal, GTA, Gears of War, and Half-Life on this TV and don't even notice.The second thing to be aware of is the complexity of the Google TV software. To someone who isn't comfortable navigating complex software, menus, and options, this TV will be overwhelming. There are 8 freaking ways to do anything on the TV, making things quick at times but confusing more often. I have spent lots of time tinkering with the Android OS, so figuring out this TV wasn't hard for me, my roommates on the other hand had about a week before they were comfortable even using it. If you are a tech proficient person, you should be fine. I wouldn't recommend this to your grandma though. Google is due for an update of this software soon (overdue, actually), so I imagine the complexity should be toned down a bit when this happens.Those two issues aside, the TV is amazing. I primarily use it for Netflix, Hulu (on the Xbox), games, and occasional web content. Flash content in the browser SCREAMS with speed and being able to view any video on the web in your living room is super nice. The full 1080p is colorful and crisp, a very nice picture.

However, in reality when the TV arrived the picture quality is mediocre at best and in my situation I had this TV sitting on top of a bookshelf approx. 6.5 feet off the floor, when sitting in my office desk chair, the TV was all but impossible to see - everything was reduced to black blobs. When standing and facing the TV straight on from the same height, the pictures is decent, but doesn't match the quality of my Samsung TV in the living room or my Samsung computer monitors.The GoogleTV update which the setup menu indicated would take 10-15 minutes took 12 hours to reach the halfway point! And that over a 8 mbps cable internet connection. I tried both the Ethernet port and the wireless setup thinking at first that perhaps one of the connections was bad, but both seemed equaly slow. I can only assume the update is slowing coming from Google's servers or the TV is incredibly slow at processing it, as 12 hours would've allowed for many gigabytes worth of data - heck the whole GoogleTV OS could've been downloaded in less time! The update speed in itself wouldn't have bothered me as much as it should be a one time update, but combined with the image quality issues, is unacceptable and I will be returning the unit for refund.UPDATE 9/9/11 - To clarify, my main complaint with the TV was the vertical viewing angle. In order to see the picture clearly you must be nearly looking straight at the TV, not above, not below and not much to the sides either.Also, regarding the GoogleTV update, I discovered a few days ago that my home network router was on the frtiz and I have since had to replace it. I'm fairly sure that it was probably more the routers fault than the TV that the update took so incredibly long to finish.With that said I've raised my rating to 3 stars, although I still sent it back as the placement in my office requires a wider viewing angle than this TV offers.

Complete clips.Anime Channel - Has complete seasons of some of their popular shows.Netflix - Needs to explanation.HBO Go - Used my parents log in to connect as they don't own a computer and never would use it.Youtube - Have some of my favorite clips playing and streaming on the side.Sleep Mode - I like to leave the TV on as I go to bed.The remote is super easy to use it's a full keyboard.  Way better than any phone I've ever had with a full keyboard.  I've had 2 black berrys' with them.The TV takes about 45 - 50 seconds to turn on.  And each time it turns on I have a crash report.  Choosing the wait option gets past it.  Not sure what it is but the 45 - 50 second warm up time is included in this crash.  I've never had it crash while running an app.The good viewing angle is pretty much a cone in front of the TV.  The brightness is what you would want from a TV.  Super bright screws up your eyes.  The glass is reflective so lights and sun glare do reflect off.I keep the sound at 28 which is perfect for my bedroom 14 x 12 square feet.  With a ceiling fan continually on.I use just the wifi and all the apps take about 30 - 50 seconds to connect to their sites.  There is no loading screen and sometimes the black makes me think something went wrong.  Moving the mouse to get the courser to show up is how I can tell it's still loading.", "Date": "September 30, 2011"}, {"Title": "Great Value for the price", "Author": "Naga Yathindra", "ReviewID": "R40S3QQAW19BL", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "After seeing all these bad reviews, I was really scared of buying Sony Google TV, but its definitely a good product. Though there are some bugs and limited help, but once you start using it you feel its simple.The best part is it has all the features of a normal TV which itself costs in between $200 to $250. On top of it it has Wifi, USB, Google Chrome, You Tube, Netflix, Yupp TV etc and many more. We can even connect mouse and keyboard if we don't like the remote given by Sony.Thanks to Amazon and WeSaveyour$ for this wonderful product.", "Date": "September 13, 2011"}, {"Title": "DON'T GIVE IN TO THE NASTY REVIEWS!", "Author": "J.

Personally, I LOVE this television. I think if you use a color calibration DVD or even Google the settings for it (which I did) it puts off an amazing picture. I can't comment on the gaming lag as my PS3 is set up in the living room and this is in the bedroom, but to be able to wake up and check my email, Facebook, news sites, etc all while watching the Today Show PIP before ever getting out of bed is terrific. Good only got better when the Honeycomb update was released as you can now download apps from the Android Market. If you can afford it, upgrade and go with the 32\" as it has a better picture and MUCH better speakers... I can pump Pandora while in the shower and it is loud and clear. The 24\" is a great television for a kitchen or kid's room, but if you are buying it for a master bedroom pay the difference and go with the 32\".

It's slow to load things, stops constantly to reload videos and I have the fastest internet access provided by AT&T.; In addition half the TV shows I watch over the internet can't be loaded because of some mismatch in the programming. That was bad enough but then the tv said it had an update to instal and like an idiot I let it. The update changed the entire format of the TV wipping out all the saved websites and programs and even forcing me to have to reautheticate every password protected site I entered. It screwed up netflix so now I can only see one movie in my queue at a time and it takes even longer now to load videos from YouTube. Really kind of ticked about that and myself for buying this piece of crap.", "Date": "November 4, 2011"}, {"Title": "Google TV is probably not what you want", "Author": "Kate Yoak", "ReviewID": "R32FCFLX31M00G", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "We were very excited about getting a google TV.  Unfortunately, it became apparent on the first day that the product is a flop.  Google simply did not execute well. Eventually we returned it.  (Thanks Amazon for making it so easy!)Here is what was ultimately wrong:* The interface is not intuitive and buggy. Kind of clunky, really.* There are very few features that justify the price.  You can use Netflix.  Hulu is not supported.  It is not a DVR. Yes, you can do facebook and utube, but we expected more for the price.* The remote is cool-looking, a whole keyboard.  However, there are no light-up features, so you need a flash light to operate in a darkened room.* This particular model also disappointed. The display was so dark, it was hard to see who was who.Ultimately, for the same price, you can get an Internet TV that is much larger and even with 3D.

Right out of the box, the updates took 30 minutes to download and install.  Then, I had to reboot the thing.  It took another 30 minutes for it to scan all the TV channels.  When it finally finished, the picture was terrible.  I thought perhaps the settings were off.  I spent another hour, changing every setting I could find.  The picture got better but was still terrible.  I bought this thing to be my bedroom TV so I could watch my BBC favorites, like Dr. Who and Keeping Up Appearances, on Amazon Prime, before I fall asleep.  And, after a VERY laggy wait for a 30 minute video to load, I FINALLY got the timer to work (good luck finding anything in that maze of menus!!), I watched my movie, and fell asleep.  The TV did turn itself off as it should but, I had nightmares about going blind all night.
