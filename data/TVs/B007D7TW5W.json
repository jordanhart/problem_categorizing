I bought a 22inch Toshiba with a built in DVD player for my kids room and I have to say the picture on the Element is better then the Toshiba. The HDTV tuner works and picks up channels better too. I would have given 5 stars if it wasn't for the sound. Seems as the speakers in the Element TV are as a mid to highs in sound quality. Grant, the Element TV is small so I guess the room for a better speaker is limited, but the 22 inch Toshiba has better sound, just not the vol.", "Date": "April 21, 2012"}, {"Title": "Great value tv for kids bedrooms!", "Author": "Not Impressed, Washington", "ReviewID": "R1MKOWNN8ZHP6L", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "Bought two of these TV's for our kids bedrooms.  Have been excellent in picture and sound.  Only problem of late is that they have produced a high pitch noise/hum that not everyone can hear, but for me who can hear, it is very annoying indeed and I am only in the room for a limited amount of time and do not have to sleep in there with it like my daughter! I have unplugged and replugged in and the noise starts up again.  It would seem that both tv's have this noise, but one is significantly higher and more irritating than the other tv.  Not sure if this is to do with the age of the TV (two months off a year)which is not very old or whether it is a known problem.  I have just contacted manufacturer and we will see what they will do (if anything!).Manufacturer said that they would replace TV (very kind), however I have to ship back to them at MY COST ($20 when I only paid $99 New!) and they will send me a replacement (not so good).  When I told them I did not want to have to pay to ship back, seems that this is my only option as anything under 48\" they will not let you take to an authorized repair center so they've got you!", "Date": "November 3, 2012"}, {"Title": "I am purchasing another element tv", "Author": "Pat Davis", "ReviewID": "R1M3BFXE3NS1Q9", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I do not have great hearing and element tv's are much easier to hear for me (less base, more treble)  Lots of special extras like a display of the tv schedule (from the remote)  Element is my personal favorite of tv brands and I disagree with the comments about sound.", "Date": "January 18, 2014"}, {"Title": "Worst pushase I have ever made", "Author": "RJACKSON", "ReviewID": "R1TVUWKV2SKTFJ", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "Replacing another 19 inch that my wife  knocked over in my office.

Be careful.Crouching down and writing this review through the haze of this thing.I needed another monitor but wall mart was out, so I got this TV instead. First you have to screw in the base, which is not that easy or convenient. It doesn't seem threaded, so the screws are tight and difficult to screw in, and don't seat well. When you're done with that, the base is square and flat and you can not swivel or tilt the viewing angle. This is a problem because you have to be dead center in front of the TV, otherwise the picture quality is extremely hazy. It's still hazy dead center in front of it too, but not as bad.They did not have a display model, except a larger 32 or 40 inch, and that looked ok, so I made the mistake of thinking this would be acceptable. It's garbage.Also, TVs don't come with VGA computer cables, for anyone who's thinking of getting a TV as a monitor. I luckily found an extra one at home. There's not much clearance for any bulky VGA cables on this, so I had to swap with another monitor cable.I will test this as a TV and update my review if it's any better at that, but probably not. Either way, I'm returning it.", "Date": "October 24, 2013"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "Unavailable", "Features": null, "Name": "Element 19\" Class 720p 60hz LCD HDTV - Black (ELCFT194)", "ImgURL": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/21vGvbIbnfL.jpg", "ProductID": "B007D7TW5W"}}
