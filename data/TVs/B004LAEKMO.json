{"Reviews": [{"Title": "why we bought this TV & first impressions", "Author": "D. Lees", "ReviewID": "R1EPRZOEPRO6A3", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "we've had this TV for 4 days now, and we couldn't be happier!  i've been writing a running commentary of our initial impressions which i'll now consolidate to make for easier reading.  we really benefited from all the reviews and advice that other people took the time to write, so we wanted to \"pay it forward\"first, some background:CONTEXT & SKILL-SET:  we're a 1 TV household, averaging around 20 hours a week.  we use the set for TV and DVD's only; no gaming.  we were replacing a wonderfully dependable but huge, 10 year-old samsung tube toad.  we did a lot of research before buying the lg 50PZ950, but we're not particularly knowledgeable about A/V stuff in general.  why tell you all this?  because it's important to know any reviewer's knowledge base (low-middling in our case) and context (moving from a CRT to a flatscreen).  our perspective may not be relevant to all readers.WHY PLASMA:  lack of motion blur for sports makes my husband happy, and the rich, immersive movie experience at night makes me happy.  our only experience with LCD is our imac, and while watching movies on the mac is great (vivid and sharp) it doesn't provide the rich, deep, \"pull you in\" sense that plasma does.  IMO, anyway.WHY 3D:  frankly, we didn't really care about 3D, but thought it might be fun once in a while, so why not?WHY THE INFINIA:  like a lot of people in our price range (~$1,600) we started out choosing between the panasonic & the samsung.  based on consumerreports.org reviews for last year's models, we included the lg infinia as well.  all three were highly rated; all within 1 point of each other.  plus the advance word from the 2011 CES was very encouraging.  we were pretty confident we wouldn't be making a mistake with any one of the 3 brands.  in the end, it came down to 2 factors:  looks & the user interface.  the infinia looks beautiful: on or off.  and the user interface is simple and straightforward.WHY WE BOUGHT FROM AMAZON:  we've always been very impressed with amazon, especially their customer service.  and never more so than in this case.  the first PZ950 we received was broken.  fortunately, amazon uses special delivery service: they unpacked the TV for us so we were able to plug it in.  the spiderweb break wasn't apparent until the set was on.  they immediately took the set back and amazon arranged to get another one here pronto, in time for my husband's b'day.  thank you amazon!  and thank you home direct.ok, now our impressions based on 4 days of loving this tv...PICTURE:  the picture quality is wonderful.  even better than i'd hoped.  deep blacks and lush, rich true-to-life colors.  lots of depth.  sometimes almost looks 3D when not in 3D.  fabulous detail on HD... and obviously less so on SD (standard definition.)DAYTIME VIEWING:  we have the set in a very bright room (lots of south-facing windows).  daytime glare was our initial worry, before buying the set.  turns out, no problem.  yes, the screen is reflective when off, but the reflections drop out when on.  NOTE ADDED 3.17:  viewed tv today for first time at max sunlight (noon-ish):  saw reflections of myself and everything else in the room.  not so bad that i couldn't comfortably watch the set, but wanted to let you know in case that's a deal-breaker for you.  fyi, we have a large bank of 6' unshaded south-facing windows in this room which flood the entire room with direct sunlight mid-day.  still adore this tv, and the reflections are not a problem for us, but wanted to let you know.NIGHTTIME VIEWING:  heavenly!  totally immersive experience when watching movies at night.AUDIO:  the sound quality is excellent, and the clear voice II feature is particularly useful for those of us a little longer in the tooth thus harder of hearing.  and the auto volume setting keeps commercials from jolting you out of your chair.3D:  well, i bought the wrong glasses so we haven't seen 3D yet.  but based on consumerreport.org's ratings of last year's version (the 50PX950) and other reviews on this year's models, i know it's going to be great.  fyi, you need the lg AGS250's -- not the AGS110's.REMOTES:  it comes with 2 remotes:  one traditional (back-lit) and one magic wand thingee.  i didn't think we'd use the wand, but we do; it's great.  in addition to being an on-screen pointer, it's also distilled down to just the essential buttons:  on/off, home, volume rocker, channel rocker, and select.  easy, intuitive, and fun.MEDIALINK:  this is great!  let's you wirelessly access all the photos on your computer, all the music & more on itunes.  pictures look great -- better than when you view them on the picassa app.  plus there's smart share (which we haven't used yet) which lets you import via USB thumb drive.NOTE FOR MAC USERS:  the TV comes with nero mediahome 4 esentials, but that only works with a PC.  go to the plex website, click on the special lg section, download the mac software, et voila:  medialink works perfectly.APPS:  we haven't used a lot of the 3rd party apps, except for google maps (which is terrific on the big screen) and picassa (which is fun for looking at pix from friends).  the TV also comes with netflix, cinema now, vudu, napster, viewster, amazon, NBA, MLB, youtube, facebook, twitter, AP, V tuner, Iplay, fun spot, and accu weather.  plus there's some lg apps which are a little dorky (no offense, lg); selection will doubtless improve over time.CALIBRATION:  we have not calibrated the TV.  partly because we don't know how, but mainly because we've been so happy with it just the way it is.  the blacks are deep, and the colors are lush but not loud.  there's a nice feature which lets you create & save your own preferred mix of settings.BREAK-IN PERIOD:  we're being really careful for the first hundred hours.  some debate on whether it's necessary, but why chance it?  besides, it's no hardship to limit fixed image viewing or to take it easy on brightness and contrast to start.  probably even better to run a break-in disk.  fyi, easy to keep track of how many total hours you've viewed to date by going to:  set up, support, product info... gives you a running total of hours on.WEB BROWSER:  a little pokey, but surprisingly useful every now and again.LG SERVICE:  we ran into a problem early on using the (included) dongle for wireless.  put a call into lg (1-800-243-0000)  turns out the problem was me:  i didn't give the TV time to update the firmware.  when the set says \"don't turn me off\", don't... or the update won't finish.  when the update finishes, the TV turns itself off and then back on.  thank you, leyza, at lg, for walking me through it.WHAT ELSE... suggest you download the manual from the lg website before the TV arrives so you'll know how to handle (lift, carry, etc.), where to place, etc.that's about it.  if you buy this TV, i hope you love it as much as we do!", "Date": "April 7, 2011"}, {"Title": "Great TV when it works...Love Amazon...Hate the Shipper they used", "Author": "Big John \"Big John\"", "ReviewID": "R2VFV159W167WU", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "First I would like to warn everyone on a delivery scam that Pilot trucking is pulling on Amazon and its cutomers.My TV was shipped to their Atlanta hub and arrived on April 4th...delivery estimate April 8th.I called Pilot on the 8th about 4pm to see whats up.They said they did not have the TV anymore it was picked up by another company J.P.Hall for final delivery.OK called Hall about the TV....a little snicker and a no way today,was told they would have a truck in my area next tuesday the 12th and next thursday the 14th..of course I picked Tuesday.On monday I received a call from Hall saying a truck was in Athens Ga with my TV but the helper was sick and if I could help get it off they would deliver it that day.I had to tell them because of my bad health there was no way I could do this.They said they would bring it tommorow.Ok Tuesday comes around no TV.I call Hall they say the Driver is waiting to pick up someone to help him.The Driver calls me about 5pm and tells me the guy didnt show up and asked again if I could help him.I said no again and He promised me first off tommorow Wed.OK wed. gets here no TV about 4pm I call Hall nope no help today no delivery...Thursday....I told them I have been forced to be home for 4 days now and need it by noon thursday because I had plans that afternoon.They said they would make it Happen..Thursday 10am the truck shows up....No helper just a driver.They put it off on Him because he was a large strong guy..but a 160lb TV one man?To get the TV I helped Him get it off and unpacked and set up...Thru the grace of God after riding around in 3 differnt Hall trucks for over a week it was still intact...I felt sorry for the driver being put in this situation.After talking to the Driver found out They dont have two people on any truck to do white glove delivery that Amazon promises.they try to hook up with another driver to get this done.Thats why they kept asking for my help.Shame on Pilot for letting this happen.6 months earlier they delivered a 2 lb fishing rod in a big truck with 2 guys.lol The delivery bill I signed was a Pilot bill of shipping so Amazon would think they deliverd it  I called Amazon about it and they were shocked and concerned their customers were getting this kind of service.they apologized and gave me a nice amount of cash for my inconvenance.and they were glad I called them and would resolve the problem.I love Amazon service.

I saw a lot of good things about the VT30 from Panasonic but it seemed like the new LGs had a lot of the same features and some extras.  The price was right and it was available while the panasonics still had a ways to go before launch  so I took the plunge and ordered the LG.  Sooooo glad I did.  This TV is awesome. Set up was a breeze.  The set looks beautiful.  Sleek and seamless.  The picture is as good or better than anything I've ever seen.  Both 2D and 3D look amazing and i didnt get dizzy at all watching 3D like i do in the theaters or on other TVs I've seen at the big box stores.The apps and media share are great features.  The UI in the home screen is very easy to navigate.  Setting up wireless connection was also very easy.  Everything just kind of worked right out of the box.  Integrated Netflix and YouTube is a nice touch, not to mention all the other apps for your social networking.  I don't know how much I'll use that stuff since it's way easier just to check those things on a computer really quick, but the option of being able to do it on your TV is nice.  The web browser is ok, definitely not going replace your laptop or PC but good enough if you don't want to get up and go to your other tech to look something up or post an update.I am very pleased with this purchase.  I may just be in the honeymoon phase but it is definitely a lot more than I expected.  Cheers to LG for a great TV at a very reasonable price.", "Date": "April 16, 2011"}, {"Title": "TV Looks Nice, Picture Quality is Substandard", "Author": "Danny Kim \"Connoisseur\"", "ReviewID": "R1WH842WXV8Q4D", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I'm a professional in the film industry who has been shooting and editing HD video for many years.  I did a lot of research before jumping into the 3D tv market.  I've owned HDTV's since they first came out commercially right around 2000.  The last tv I had was a Vizio plasma, so I thought I was upgrading when I bought the LG 50PZ950 a couple months ago.  I bought 4 active shutter glasses, a Panasonic BDT-DMP310 3D Bluray player, and own these 3D Blurays - Avatar, Coraline, Thor, and Tron: Legacy with the Toy Story Trilogy and Captain America coming soon.First of all, the bevel-less tv is beautiful, but not particularly practical to pick up and move.  I could forsee more than a few people have catastrophic accidents trying to lift, then subsequently dropping the tv, cracking the glass edges.  So take extreme caution when moving it.  I wrapped mine in a blanket when I set it face down to install the wall mount.So let's get to the all-important image quality.  After calibrating the image controls, using Expert settings and the THX presets, I ended up preferring the neutral-white custom setting with contrast at 100, brightness at 50, with almost everything else centered or turned off, blacks as low as possible.  Ah yes, the blacks.  I am not someone who exaggerates often, so don't take this lightly when I say that the LG 50PZ950 puts out the worst blacks I have ever seen on a plasma tv.  As a result, the image quality of this tv takes a big hit.  Yes, it has nice contrast on non-3D films, but it still suffers from blacks that look more like gray.  To put it frankly, my cheaper Vizio plasma had better image quality.The 3D performance invariably suffers from the low light output and light blacks.  I don't believe that the tv has enough custom controls for 3D.  And the tv retains images for longer than I am accustomed.  It is highly susceptible to burn-in, though not permanent.  It is still annoying when it leaves traces after you leave a Bluray menu on for more than 3 minutes.  My other plasma never had this level of image retention.So after all this, I am seriously considering selling my 50PZ950 and buying a similarly-priced Panasonic, which I hear has much better image quality/blacks and 3D performance.  If only this tv were slightly brighter with much better blacks, you might not even see as much image retention.  Most of the time it looks like gray lines on black.The software is chock full of features but the menu is pretty clunky.  The Wii-like remote does help to navigate the menu easier, but it seems the response time once you click a button is lengthy.  You can stream Netflix, access Facebook and install apps.  One of the silliest and inexplicable engineering decisions is to put all the HDMI ports on the screen left side instead of the back.  There is a silly amount of component and composite connections cluttering the black where the HDMI ports could have gone.Based on its image quality, I can't recommend this tv.  If you're looking to stay in the plasma realm, research Panasonic, Pioneer and even Vizio over this model.", "Date": "October 17, 2011"}, {"Title": "Amazing TV", "Author": "Markus", "ReviewID": "RDA7BPML79LNZ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This is a great TV, at a great price. I love the picture quality in 2D and 3D (with the optional AG-S250 glasses), it performs extremely well with my Xbox 360 and PS3 and I'm happy I invested the extra money over the PZ550 and PZ750 - the Magic Remote, THX certification and TruBlack Filter were definitely worth it for my purposes.Netflix is a nice feature and I hope they will keep updating this software, as it could have more picture/zoom settings - it doesn't really matter if you have other streaming devices, but it's still a point that could be improved.I know this is not very much information, I've only had the TV for a week now, but I'd definitely recommend it to other customers and might update this review over time.", "Date": "April 15, 2011"}, {"Title": "Upscale Looks On or Off and Content Rich Features.", "Author": "Danny Wilson \"termitescout\"", "ReviewID": "R21FVYBA5SA0BT", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "There aren't a lot of reviews on the 2011 top 3 Panasonic, Samsung, and LG offerings yet. What I have found tell me the Samsung isn't much better if at all over last years models while being hundreds of dollars more and the Panasonic is claimed to be superior in it's blacks, but I still don't like the look of the dingy whites it creates, to me this is a totally unacceptable trade-off, it too is hundreds of dollars more than last years. Both the Samsung and Panasonic are several hundred dollars more than the comparable LG model PZ950. If anyone is interested look up \"2011 CES reviews\" on the products you might be interested in and judge for yourself, these too aren't totally comprehensive reviews because these were pre-release sets they were looking at setup by the manufacturer. Do yourself a favor and search as many reviews as you can on the TV you're interested in, then go look at it yourself.The LG has a beautiful frame and base with nearly invisible touch sensitive control buttons on the front, not on the bottom of the frame. When you turn it on a small cluster of blue LED lights flicker on and off almost like twinkling stars at the bottom inside the glass edge. The setup is very straight-forward and easy especially with the \"Magic Motion Remote\". I use this remote more than the other, it's like a laser pointer with volume and channel control. You can do everything just by pointing and clicking instead of using the up/down/left/right/enter buttons. Despite what the user that rated it 1 star said, \"the LG does come with VuDu, not HuLu\". Look at Amazons description on the LG Smart TV features @ (http://www.amazon.com/gp/feature.html?ie=UTF8&docId;=1000667211). Maybe she should have paid closer attention to the add and  updated her software which is easy to do whether you're hooked up to a wired or wireless network. I bought mine with a package that included 2 pair of 3-D glasses and a WiFi ready 3-D BluRay player at a substantial savings. There's nothing to want for in this TV, the fact that it's hundreds less than the competitors is just icing on the cake and makes you wonder why anyone would spend the extra money for the other sets. Go look at them yourself, play with the settings, and decide for yourself. Don't judge this set unless you adjust the picture settings, and they are widely adjustable. The 3-D viewing is very cool. I watched \"Resident Evil, Afterlife\" in 3-D and I had a grin on my face watching the bullets whiz back and forth and the exploding concrete and glass. I also appreciate the sound leveler function which keeps commercials from blasting me out of my seat.This is a great set and I'm anxious to see reviews from the big reviewers because I really think this TV is going to be a BIG BANG FOR THE BUCK winner this year equaling or beating competitors for hundreds less.", "Date": "April 20, 2011"}, {"Title": "The Calibration Settings you need to make this set FLAWLESS", "Author": "David D. Middleton Jr. \"ddeemidd\"", "ReviewID": "RQMAVWLWN1JWM", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I've had this TV for over a month now and it is finally broken in.  Ran it through color-cycling (highly recommended) to reduce the brightness of white phosphors and reduce image retention and prevent burn-in.I can truly say this is one of the best TVs I have ever seen.  I have owned a plethora of televisions, a Sony plasma, Samsung LCD, LG LED, Mitsubishi DLP, and finally this LG plasma.  I can hands-down say this set beats the rest, combined.Design:The bevel-less front panel is both intriguing when the set is on or off.  The frame is extremely thin (~2\" at its deepest) and the base is large as the TV is heavy.  There are 4 HDMI inputs, mounted on the side of TV and none on the back (only downfall).  This means you cannot hide wires very easily, but it will reduce cable tension if you decide to wall mount it.  Additionally, there is one AV input and 2 component inputs on the back.Picture Quality (and black level tweak):The picture is immensely vivid.  I see individual colors on this TV that I failed to notice on all of my other sets.  Contrast is sharp, with high contours and accurate detailing and imaging.  The ONLY complaint about the picture with this TV are the black levels.  I will attest to the fact that they are black to the average viewer, but not ink black that you expect to find in high-end plasma sets.  HOWEVER, do NOT be deterred.  There are a set of knobs that you can tweak if you remove the rear panel of the TV and access the internal components.  The walk-through link is through AVS Forum and a quick search for \"LG plasma panel tweaks for better blacks\" on GOOGLE  (very first hit) will reveal the guide that includes step-wise instructions and pictures.  *sorry, cannot post urls on amazon*The reason behind these black levels is for the manufacturer to maintain a consistent product that will work every time out of the box.  During this tweaking process you will see pixel misfires and artifacts since you will be optimizing the set to its utmost potential (no harm in doing so).  With another person, it will not take more than an hour to remove the rear panel, optimize the black levels, and replace the panel.  Just play a blu-ray disc (preferably one WITH letterbox) as you will be trying to get the letterbox as black as possible.  Scenes that are supposed to be black are quite black before this tweak, but afterwards, you will notice a HUGE difference and if you plan to invest in this set, this is a must-do.  Do not try and change black levels through settings as it will skew the vivid colors.3D:This is truly better than the theaters.  You see depth in every part of a scene and not only when things fly out at you.  It is sort of like peering into an abyss that takes you along on a journey.  You feel as if you are being sucked into the scene with its depth, rather than being pushed back in your seat like the theaters.  I highly recommend Tron 3D as a first time purchase (after watching IMAX: Deep Sea and the Universe, Despicable Me, How to Train Your Dragon, and Alice in Wonderland).  And for all those old reviews about the glasses that turn off every 10 minutes, I'm delighted to say that the problem was fixed with firmware and no longer exists when you update the TV.Sound:I cannot speak too much about the sound quality as I have it hooked up to a receiver and home theater system.  However, I did run the TV speakers in parallel to my front stage stereo speakers and there are some neat features available.  One, there is AV Sync so the sound is synced between the receiver and the TV and there is no reverb between the two.  Playing the speakers alongside a stereo configuration allows for interesting options.  If you do not have a center channel, the TV can essentially serve as the center if you turn on \"Clear Voice,\" and boost the treble and lower the bass minutely.  This way, your floor speakers can play the beefier sound to produce a full stage while your TV will play clearer dialogue.  Also, if your receiver supports ARC, so does this TV.  ARC is the ability to use a single HDMI cord between the two that allows the TV to send audio back to the receiver for it to play (like in Medialink *discussed later).  This eliminates the need to run a digital (optical) cable between the two.Calibration:If you do not have the money or if you move annually, I would recommend the following settings to calibrate this set:For a brighter picture-Picture preset: Expert1Contrast 85Brightness 49H Sharpness: 50V Sharpness: 50Color: 50Tint 0Dynamic Contrast OffNoise Reduction OffSuper resolution OffGamma LowBlack level LowFilm mode OffColor gamut StandardEdge enhancer OffxvYCC AutoColor filter OffColor temperature WarmRGB Method 2 pointsR contrast 0G contrast -3B contrast 2R brightness 4G brightness -14B brightness 11Eco mode OffTo emphasize blacks- Use the THX Cinema preset and press \"8741\" to unlock the settings. Set contrast to 68-69, brightness to 51, color 45-46, film mode always \"ON\" when possible.Medialink:This is my FAVORITE feature of the television.  You can download movies and torrents online or digital copies of blu-rays and DVDs and place them into folders that you may upload onto the PLEX Media Server (available online via the instructions on the LG Medialink). This \"Cloud Server\" allows for playback of your movie library. The same goes for music and pictures.  Then, the LG 60PZ950 will find your computer's Plex server on the network and you can proceed to stream all of the above to the TV, wirelessly.  If your connection is up to it, you will not see any downscaling and can watch full 1080p blu-rays from your server.", "Date": "April 4, 2012"}, {"Title": "Great TV", "Author": "Jason", "ReviewID": "RMTP76PIKMZPO", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Pro:Picture quality is fantastic.Very thin.

After researching 3D and the suggested need for a high refresh rate, I narrowed my research to plasma.  After that I looked at my old standby Samsung (own a plasma, and a LCD version) and was not impressed with the features or price.  I stumbled across this bad boy one day during lunch at work.  After doing my research I was sold.  I opted for the Amazon order because it is cheaper, and you get 24 months same as cash financing.  Between LG's offer of a free Blu-Ray player and two pair of glasses I only had to buy two more pair and am set to watch movies.It arrived ahead of schedule and was delivered by Pilot.  My wife said they were very nice and hauled it downstairs to our entertainment room, un-boxed it and allowed her to plug it in, and they even installed the batteries in the remote so she could try that out as well.  They removed all packing material, and when I got home all I had to do was install the base stand and hook it up to U-Verse.We're in love with it...

It is absolutely perfect for us.  Thin, cool (very little heat generated), low energy consumption and an absolute terrific picture (and sound) out of the box.  I had to seriously adjust both the picture quality and sound for both of our Samsungs, and this baby is perfect.  The THX mode in both picture and sound is terrific for movies.Now for 3D - holy cow am I impressed.  We watch \"Cloudy with a chance of Meatballs\" last night as our first family movie and as a skeptic wasn't expecting much.  I believe it is better than the movie theater because of the better depth-of-field present throughout the entire movie.  It makes the picture much richer and more enjoyable.  You feel like you're looking at the image as real as if it's really in the room.  The LG glasses are light, seem durable and the battery life was just fine.  I wear progressive lense eyeglasses and was worried that they would not fit over them and they did just fine.  One of my kids reports they could lie down on the couch and still see 3D just fine (I didn't try so I cannot completely confirm that, but this child is 13 and is not prone to exagerate).  I tried watching 3D offset from the center of the screen and still saw 3D but it was a little more deminished the further I moved left or right, but still there (I attribute Plasma's wider viewing angle as assisting in that).  Four to six people setting on a couch could easily enjoy full 3D with no problem.  I was able to recline and still saw 3D as well.  There was no ghosting, or ill effects during the entire movie while using 3D.So... I have no complaints, and wish you absolute enjoyment when you decide to buy the same TV.", "Date": "June 21, 2011"}, {"Title": "High-end Plasma TV w/o paying too much", "Author": "vagven", "ReviewID": "R2A2T4LVW8FNM1", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I had been researching to upgrade our TV to a 1080P HD for a long time.

I have to commend Amazon and Onecall for a very quick transaction.  Well done.  The standard delivery got to me within 4 days of me placing the order.  My TV was delivered curbside however I offered the driver $20 to help me get it into my condo.  No problem whatsoever.Now I've only had this for a night but once I set it up, I can tell you that I'm blown away by the picture quality.  This is my first plasma and 1080P and so maybe I'm overly excited but I had a Hitachi 1080i/720P Ultravision ( CRT ) and that was still a great picture for 11 years old.  This picture quality is better than I have ever seen and that is from a lot of visual research over the past couple of years with various models.  LG did a fantastic job on this PZ950 flagship model.  I'm anxious to see what CNET says about it once they review it and compare it to the Panasonic and Samsung equivalents.  The price for the LG is much better than both of those and I'd been hearing good things.  Even last year their PX950 model got great reviews.I use hi-speed hdmi cables and run them through my A/V receiver that can also support 3D.  I haven't had a chance to test the 3D yet as my glasses were shipped separately and arrive tomorrow.  I'm sure it will be very good and will report back once I give it a run.  I did try Vudu ( which I already have an account for ).  Vudu still gave me a credit for a free rental in 1080P and it was AWESOME!  Also tried Netflix, MLB TV ( also a member for ).  I had these apps through my PS3 already but it's nice to have them on the LG directly.  Everything ran like butter.  Set up was a breeze and the wireless dongle they provide was simple as well.  I even updated my software in about 5 minutes.  I have a really hi-speed wireless network so I can't tell you if others will experience the same fortune in updating software quickly.  I got a ton of apps after the update.  So many that I won't have time to use them all.  YouTube was cool.Currently, I'm just using the THX mode to break in the plasma on movie channels for the next 100 hours or so.  However, I did watch the HEAT/MAV game last night in sports mode.  The settings so far are right on and I don't know how much I will have to tinker with them later. The colors look fantastic.Anybody and everybody that wants a great price and possibly the #1 plasma for 2011 owes it to themselves to check out this TV.Again, excellent job LG.  Thanks to OneCall for providing a great price and fast shipment through Amazon.

The TV looks great.  The black is a little less than I anticipated and the picture wizard takes some tweaking.  All and all picture is nice.The problem with the TV is when watching a 3D picture.  First it says put on your glasses - which is fine but the box never seems to go away unless you press the remote ok button.  A minor gripe but it was annoying.  The second problem is the glasses that come with the TV - they shut off every 10 mins.  Yes it's a documented feature.  I called LG and the support rep told me they were clearly defective.  After I pointed out the documentation he talked to the tech department who confirmed they did shut off.  They told me I would have to return the glasses for a new pair that is software level .64 (the current ones are .63).  When I asked if Amazon would know to give me the right level they said doubtful as the glasses are not available and no retailer has them.  When I asked for an eta I was told that there wasn't one.I really like the picture and the TV is a good size but I can't have a 3D TV that forces you to turn on the glasses every 10 mins.  It really interrupts the viewing experience to go from a suspenseful event to a fuzzy picture.  I've contact LG support numerous times.  Their support is spotty at best.  They say call back tomorrow, we will get back to you, and sometimes they just don't answer.With LG now moving to passive 3d I suspect fixing the existing glasses is not high on their priority list.

Cherubino", "ReviewID": "R740O2VJTO6GB", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I originally bought last year's LG flagship model, the 60PX950. It was a great tv at a great price, but there were several problems with it, including bad screen uniformity and poor 3D performance. I was able to replace the set with the PZ950, and I'm happy that I did.The screen has perfect uniformity.  It doesn't have any clouding or a \"dirty screen effect\" like my older panel did. It outputs color that looks very natural, and everything looks crystal clear.  Surprisingly, non HD material looks quite good with it as well. It makes internet video look much better when displayed over my old Samsung LCD. There is also much less \"line bleeding\" compared to last year.The TruBlack filter does a decent job, but it will not eliminate reflections completely. I have two large windows behind my seating area, and I can still watch tv in the daytime with no issues with the shades open.3D is excellent on this tv, much better than it was on the PX950. The Bluetooth receiver and glasses used this year make a big difference compared to last years infrared glasses, as there are much less flickering and brightness issues.  Under the Sea looks absolutely stunning, and 3D gaming is fun every so often. I recommend active 3D like this set uses over passive 3D, as the image in active glasses is much more detailed. I believe it compares well to Samsung's and Panasonic's 3D, with Panasonic being a bit better, but at a higher price.The PZ950 also has excellent response time, and minimal input lag. You can play Call of Duty or any other game which requires fast movement with no issues.  This is also improved over last year.The SmartTV internet features also seem like they could be useful (Netflix, weather), but I find it useless to me, as there are few apps outside of Netflix and Youtube worth using, and navigating the menu seems slow and cumbersome. The magic wand Wii-like remote makes things a little easier, but I still find most of this feature useless to me.  I could not play my MKV files wirelessly, but it can play divx just fine. What I did not like is that you cannot adjust your picture settings while in SmartTV, and the TV defaults to its \"Vivid\" profile, which looks awful. I have my PC connected to the tv so I just avoid SmartTV completely.The only thing that I don't like about this tv is the black levels. They were supposed to be improved over last year, but they look exactly the same, which is poorer than what Samsung's and Panasonic's offerings can do. If this tv had comparable black levels to Samsung and Panasonic, it would be the best tv on the market.If the Samsung 59PND7000 and 8000 models did not have the peeling screen problems that a majority of their sets are having, I would have went with one of those instead, as the price of the D7000 is very similar. A peeling screen is a deal breaker though.With the Free Blu-ray player and 2 Free glasses deal, this tv is an excellent value with great bang for the buck for the price.  The VT30 Panasonic is far too expensive, and the Samsung tvs are far too risky right now, making the LG one of the best choices in its price range for the time being.", "Date": "July 1, 2011"}, {"Title": "Couldn't wait!!", "Author": "Jason G.

If any issues develop I will update this review.Delivery and Unpacking: This part of the review is not pertaining to my rating of this product but I thought it would be worth mentioning.  The retailer (Adorama Camera) told me to NOT ALLOW the delivery driver to leave without verifying that the television worked and had my satisfaction.  It's been about 10 to 20 degrees out for the last several days.  When the delivery driver showed up (Manna Distribution) I asked him if the television had been stored and transported in a climate controlled environment, he said no and that it was in a non-heated warehouse for the last few days over the weekend.  When we took the tv inside the house and unboxed it it immediately got condensation all over it (and inside it as well most likely) from going from a cold to warm environment.  It's the same thing as a persons glasses fogging up when they walk inside a warm house after being out in the cold.  It was below freezing outside so I didn't want to turn it on outside either as the minimum operating temp from the manufacturer is 0 degrees C (32F). So I was in a catch 22, I could not turn it on outside cause it was too cold and I couldn't turn it on inside cause it was covered with condensation.  The delivery driver stated it was my problem and I was not allowed to refuse the product as he'd already brought it in the house.  He was wrong but I didn't bother arguing at that time as he'd at least waited patiently on me while I was taking the box apart.  I begrudgingly signed off on it as delivered in good condition after I found no physical defects.  I let the television sit in the house for 5 hours before powering it up.  Fortunately it worked fine but I'm glad I waited to power it up.Now on the actual Television review!This thing is beautiful.  It's beautiful even when turned off.  The glass on the screen is very shiny/glossy but it really doesn't show too many reflections while you're watching the TV.  We had one light that was brazenly mis-placed and it was reflecting pretty bad off the screen but after we moved it we saw no other reflections worth mentioning.Right out of the gate this tv was ready to watch, it was a snap to get it going.  The 3D is very good.  I would say that the newest transformers movie on this TV has a better 3D effect than when I saw it on the big screen.  You can control the amount of 3d depth effect you want to see if too much 3d bothers you.  I'm able to stand it turned all the way up but my wife likes it better turned down a little bit, so it's nice that you have that option.The picture is flat out amazing.  I'm not sure what some of the CNET reviews are talking about saying that the black levels are not black enough vs other top of the line plasmas.  The black level on this TV is just fine, the blacks are very black and the whites really pop.  I'm not saying those professional reviews are wrong but what I am saying is that if you're an average person who just enjoys watching a nice TV you're not going to notice any issues at all with black levels.  I looked at this TV, the top of the line Panasonic (VT30) and the top of the line Samsung plasmas before I bought this one.  I had them almost side by side at the store playing blu rays.  I asked several of the sales reps and even just other customers passing by what they thought about the picture quality of all three of these TVs.  They almost all said they saw no distinguishable difference and that they all looked great.  Also, if you think you can rate picture quality of any of these top of the line TVs based on the content they are showing in the store, you need to think again.  Usually they have the brightness and contrast turned up way too much.  You can get a STUNNING picture out of this LG.  All you need to do is work with the picture setting adjustments to get it dialed in.  In my opinion the \"THX Cinema\" mode is too bright.  The only way to get the best possible picture is to calibrate it.  I'm still working on my calibration settings but just playing with it for 30 minutes last night I got a very nice picture dialed in already.This tv has a lot of features.  I streamed netflix for about an hour straight with no problems.  Youtube worked great as well.  I got it connected to my wireless and it took about 10 mins to download the newest software version.  By the way, if you've got mac address filtering enabled on your router the MAC address for the Wifi is on the bottom of the Wifi dongle.  Use a magnifying glass because it's in tiny print.  At first I mistook an \"E\" for an \"8\" and thought the TV had a broken Wifi link but I got it corrected and it connected immediately.  It has two remotes.  One is a traditional style with buttons, the other is the \"magic motion\" remote.  Think of it as a Wii Remote, it's actually pretty cool.  You just point to whatever you want to do on the screen and push the button, it's simple and so far we've not even used the regular remote aside from just testing it.  So far I have no complaints at all with this TV.  If you're like me and you've been agonizing forever over which top of the line plasma to buy I don't think you need to look any further.  Really when it comes down to it you're not going to go wrong with any of these TVs (top of the line LG,Samsung or Panasonic), they all look great, they all have tons of features and all have really high reviews.  When it came down to it for me, it was price point that motivated me to buy.  This LG gave me the most bang for my buck so I bought it.

I finally settled on this plasma, and I'm glad I did.  All the lcd's in the stores compared with the plasmas, seemed brighter and more vivid.  The fact is, that isn't really how the picture is supposed to look.  It was hard to get over that fact when making the decision that the seemingly less bright and less vivid tv is the better one, but that's the facts.  A little side note that really put it in perspective for me...I was recently at a concert outside that started at dusk and there were lcd displays on both sides of the screen.  Even at dusk, everything on the screens was a lot brighter and over saturated with color compared to what I saw when just looking at the stage.  All the colors and the brightness was way over emphasized.  The screens themselves didn't look bad, matter of fact they looked pretty good, but it was nowhere near what the real thing looked like.  Enough on that.  The TV is loaded with features and apps like Facebook, Youtube, Netflix, etc and comes with a USB wireless ethernet adapter.  The picture quality is fantastic and there are different display modes for different types of content, such as sports, drama, action, etc.  I'm sure that's probably standard on all the TV's today.  The 2d-3d converter is pretty cool, as it allows you to view anything in 3d.  It's not as good as things that were meant to be in 3d, but it's still pretty cool to check out.

These are charged via a USB cable that can plug into the tv.  I've watched a couple of the 3D channels on DirectTv and the 3D effects are pretty good.  The internet (wireless) was pretty easy to access and the apps work great.  The one thing that could be improved is to include a mini qwerty keybord on the remote.  Typing in text to search YouTube and the bowser is a little cumbersome.  Can't realy comment on the sound since I have a Yahama receiver as my sound system.So far. this tv is the bomb!

The delivery went smoothly with no problems.I was initially disappointed with the picture quality with the default settings but after some fiddling with the adjustments, it is now producing a great picture.  I have had another HD flat panel plasma for serveral years and I am very particular with what I expect from an HD TV picture.  I have only viewed AVATAR in 3D so far, but it was as good or better than in the theater.  I found the LG shutter glasses to have a small lens area that didn't fit over most glasses but were functional, trouble free and worked well resting in front of my glasses. The additional LG Magic Motion remote is a novel accessory that is simple and fun to use.I do not currently subscribe to an on-line movie service and cannot comment on the SMART TV functions.The only real complaint I have with this TV is the limited choice of picture aspect ratios that I currently enjoy with my 7 year old NEC TV.

This TV is replacing a 2 year old Mitsubishi DLP and a 1 month old Sharp LED.I was looking at many LED's and Plamsa's for a bright room where they TV is exact opposite a set of large windows(facing North).  My worry with an led was motion artifacts and a brutally bright white level(gives me headaches) and a plasma not being able to overcome the light from the windows.  After much searching I was interested in a Panasonic VT plasma or a Samsung LED(among many other early searches).  I was not thrilled with the gray scale of the Panasonic and the picture always had an orange tint.  The Samsung has such a drastic contrast that all detail was lost in a darker scene.  After a bit of time I thought the lg did a great job overall and was worth a shot.Out of the box I have not seen a TV look this good since the final Pioneer elite.  I have heard some complaints about black levels and motion issues.  At best those complaints are nit-picking. The black levels are definitely not as \"black\", but the gray scale makes movies like Pandorum much easier to watch.  Out of the box the TV has very accurate color detail and a phenomenal gray scale.  I can watch the darkest of shows even during the day and everything still looks great.  It does reflect a bit of light but using a tilt bracket made the glare effect from my windows near none existent.  The light sensing feature works quite well, although the APS can cause a bit of flicker in some images.  I have not tried much tweaking since I am quite thrilled by the standard image(at some point I will adjust because of the APS flicker).  The TV is also loaded with a nice apps menu but I have not tried much of that yet although it seems quite nice.  It comes with a \"wii like\" remote that works surprisingly well but is more of a gimmick to me.  After working in the AV industry on many far more expensive televisions I can easily say this is by far a great all around TV.  It may not be perfect but it does everything so well any complaints aren't worth going into detail.Also I dont know if it has good sound, at 2\" thick I expect it to be terrible and it integrates easily into my sound system", "Date": "February 28, 2012"}, {"Title": "wow", "Author": "joe davis", "ReviewID": "R371CSZLCHLYL6", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "we ordered the pz950 from adorama it arrived on time. but the delivery people showed up in a pick up truck with the tv laying in the back. iwas very concerned i was told you should never lay these tv's down they brought into the house and i unpacked it and pluged it in to be shure all was well lucky it was the set is great no buzzing. the picture is outstanding only wish it would have came with a pair of glasses the magic remote is a little odd to get set up right this tv is a monster and is a stunning thing to behold we upgraded from a mitsubisi projection tv that was awfull i would reccomend this set to anyonejust watch the delivery guys update well we have owned our lg for a little over a month now i still have nothing bad to say lg customer service is excellent they sent us 2 pairs of the 3d glasses wow the 3d is great and thx settings real amazing", "Date": "February 22, 2012"}, {"Title": "Nice TV!! but not for playing games", "Author": "xJosex", "ReviewID": "R7AH8LIVWPOB0", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I've had this tv for a while now.

Excellent picture and very easy to set up. The only negative thing I can say has nothing to do with the LG product. I neglected to add the two pair of 3D glasses which were advertised on Amazon as being free with the purchase. Beware, Amazon customer service will not co-operate in any way once you have selected purchase. Their only suggestion was for me to refuse the TV upon delivery and in the mean time order another TV with the 3D glasses special. I told them I was replacing a TV which no longer worked and I didn't want to start the order process and wait all over again especially just prior to Christmas. I don't believe it would be fair to Amazon's third party (the company who actually supplied the TV) to absorb the shipping charges which brings up another point. I thought I was purchasing from Amazon however; they apparently deal with a third party (vendor) and that's how they slid out of compromising with me and giving the free glasses to me. I had to order and pay for the two pairs of glasses. Make sure you have ordered correctly and have not missed anything since Amazon will not bend in the least. I still don't quite understand, Amazon billed my credit card however, when the 3D glasses issue came up, they said they wouldn't honor the special because I was the third parties customer.

I waited nearly 2 months to receive this item due to the fact that the item was on backorder when I ordered in June, but it was well worth the wait. The TV was very easy to setup. Mounting the TV to the base was a breeze. Only a few screws to secure it and they even have a small cover for the base mount aperture in case you want to wall mount. The picture quality is terrific. From what I've read, they say Panasonic's GT and VT series have better black levels than this unit, but I really cannot tell the difference. I've gone to Best Buy to compare the Panasonic GT and this LG. Granted, Best Buy probably didn't calibrate their TVs before demo'ing them, but I'm very pleased with the black levels of this LG TV. The speakers for the TV, as many have said before me, is not the greatest. With a TV this size though, I would imagine that they could invest a little more on a home theater in a box set for a few hundred dollars at the very least. If you don't own one, you're going to want one to compensate for the lackluster sound quality. 3D movies were fluid and pleasing to look at. I've watched Avatar and Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs in 3D and they both looked pretty good. Only downside is that the AG250 glasses do desync if your head stays motionless for too long. I'm not saying you should sway your head side to side as you watch, but bear in mind that you'll have to press the power button on the glasses to resync it if it does desync.The TV came with two remote controls. One wand that resembles the Wiimote and a more conventional remote. The wand is pretty intuitive and there's no calibrations required. If the cursor feels a little off, you can just move the cursor to the side and adjust till it feels right for you. I don't think I'll be using the wand, however, since it lacks the 3D button. In order to enable 3D using the wand, you have to click on the Home button, which is the menu, and select a couple options before you can enable 3D mode. With the regular remote you just press \"3D\" and select the type of 3D you want, and that's it. I would've liked the remote click wheel to be a little more pronounced (stick out more) on the regular remote, as often times I do misclick the middle \"Enter\" button since it's flush with the surrounding directional wheel. The regular remote is fairly adequate, but it's no universal remote. It does do some backlighting that you can trigger on and off, which is nice.The premium apps that you can install, such as Netflix and Hulu+, are very well done. The menu for Netflix looks a little grainier than the PS3 app, but it functions just as well and the movie quality is on par with the PS3 version.Connectivity to my home network was a breeze as well. I just plugged in the wireless dongle that came with the TV and after some easy instructions, I was hooked up to the world wide web.The appearance of the TV looks really nice.

The only technical limitation I've found so far is that it 'supports' Plex media center software if you have a media PC, *but* it doesn't support playing VOB files (ie DVDs transferred to hard drive for convenience) - which the Plex PC server does support.  Also it sees the episode titles on my DirecTV HDVR but isn't able to play them through media link.  Not a deal killer but a mild annoyance as it requires source switching and two remotes.With the 2012 model due out soon, watch for further price drops.Above limitations aside, 5 stars on picture quality/price.

I just know as a viewer, this TV has a wonderful picture. I did hook this up to my wireless even though I already had internet content available through my Sony DVD player. I like the features and functions of this LG TV better than the Sony, so we use this now to watch Netflix, Vudu, Amazon Prime etc. Sports are especially great when compared to my 4 year old Samsung LCD. So far no stuttering, blurring, ghost images or anything else of that nature. As far as 3D though, I am just not impressed overall with it - although I didn't like the 3D on the Samsung or Panasonic on display in my local Best Buy either. It's cool for about 10 - 15 minutes after that the thrill is gone.If you are a 3D fan, you'll probably be satisfied with the 3D on this TV as it seems to be as good of quality as those in Best Buy.I've only had the TV for a few weeks but so far it's been great!", "Date": "January 25, 2012"}, {"Title": "Quality TV", "Author": "bill", "ReviewID": "R3BH5RRNNAGLCU", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Pleased with shipping and delivery company.Owned TV in excess of 30 Days and had time to play around wit setup opions and personal calibrations of which there are many. I think calibrating the picture is a subjective experience as I tried some suggested calibration on line and was not pleased with the results. I think it takes time to try different ones to get to where you like it. I have no problems with black levels on this TV. Coming from a previous Panasonic plasma, the picture is just as good.Glasses for this 3D are confortable enought but cut out like other reviewers have mentioned. This is aggravating but they work good when on. The biggest problem I have with 3D is not the television but the content available for movies, programs, etc. The remade movies into 3D are generally bad. Glad to see some of the new movies coming out in 2012 are in 3D. I realize it will take time. I wanted ESPN 3D but my cable provider doesn't carry at present (Cox). If they don't get soon I will probably switch to satellite. Direct carries ESPN 3D.No problem with setting up internet features but I prefer using my desktop for internet as I haven't so far been interested in streaming movies and I prefer going to Blockbuster store for my bluray and dvd movies. Although they don't carry 3D movies at present this too will probably change. Cox cable does have a few 3D movies on demand.As time goes by 3D TV's will improve with new technology coming. I bought this TV to futureproof at least for a little while. It was a good choice and perhaps in a couple or three years purchase a new TV that has the new improvements.The biggest con for this TV are the glasses cutting out after 10 to 15 minutes.Pros- Good picture. 60\" screen.

Much better than our old 32\" LCD tv.  Hooked our HD cable into the box and was watching blu-ray in about a minute.  The online apps seemed a little slow (that was probably because our wifi was being used up at the time), but for instance when watching an Amazon HD show, once I got into the show there were hardly any buffering issues even though our bandwidth was still being used heavily.  Didn't get a chance to try out the 3D capabilities yet.Then, the bad.  From least to most annoying.  We couldn't get the 'magic motion' remote to register, so it wouldn't work, even though we don't have any wireless routers in the immediate vicinity.  There's only 2 USB ports, so 1 for the wifi dongle leaving only 1 for charging the 3D glasses -- not cool.  Internet apps seemed really slow, but again, that was probably because our bandwidth was being hogged elsewhere.  The most annoying?  The TV simply STOPPED WORKING after less than 24 hours.  Still powered on, but no picture and no sound.  Now, I'm not one to give a bad review with a lemon.  Which I'm hoping this is.  Will change the review if necessary.Customer service was actually a pleasure to deal with though.  LG had me on hold for less than a minute before I was talking to an American (i.e., easy-for-my-slow-brain-to-understand) service rep, who ran me through some troubleshooting then hooked me up with a local service company to get it fixed.  Easy-peasy.  They can't come till Monday (today is Thursday) and won't service the TV while it is wall-mounted, but I can live with those.So.

Davis", "ReviewID": "R1QTRQ8MU8C2SL", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This is a purchase I have been planning for a couple of years. I wanted an upgrade for my 10 year old Toshiba 57 inch rear projection set for some time now.  I decided that for this size of display a Plasma offered the best compromise between price and performance.  I had my eye on the comparable Samsung models like the D7000 & D8000, but the price on the LG 60PZ950 in combination with a bundled free Blu-ray 3D player and 2 sets of glasses made me jump.I had to wait a couple months because the TV was back-ordered, but when the set shipped I had NO issues with Pilot Freight service used by Amazon. They had an efficient way to assign a delivery window. Showed up on time and even carried the heavy TV into the basement for me. The set was in perfect condition ... NO damage of any kind.My old rear projection set was capable of displaying HD content, but it was getting tired and certainly never looked as beautiful as this Plasma display does. Of course the upgrade to HDMI cables and the ability to up-convert all source inputs were a big part of the deal. I also upgraded to a Sony STRDH820 AV Receiver and hooked to my old 6.1 speakers. This has been a nice upgrade as well! I now have a huge cardboard box full of component video and digital audio cables I no longer need ... Sweet!The LG 60PZ950 display is crisp with deep blacks and eye popping color and contrast. There are several video settings including THX that work well and help adjust to room lighting or content. You can also create your own custom display set-ups. I can't comment on the audio features of this Plasma, since as already mentioned, I pass everything thru an AV receiver.  I was able to easily connect the TV to my wireless network using the included adapter, but I haven't played with it much yet.  I did do a little web browsing and it works. But without a keyboard it is slow going using only the remote. The ability to access content like Netflix and MLB .TV might be cool, but I wasn't going to give them my credit card number for their so called \"Free Trails\". I already have all the content I need from my cable provider, so I will leave these features for others to review.HD channels off my cable looks terrific live or from the DVR on this TV. My old DVD's, now up-converted look Sooooo much better! I can't wait to start adding more Blu-rays to my collection now that I have a set capable of displaying them. We have watched a couple of 3D Blu-ray movies and this technology really works, although the glasses tend to make everything much darker, so some tweaking of the display was required. Turning the lights off also helped. The 3D effects tend to be more into the background then object flying out of the screen, but screen menus appear to float in mid-air in front of the TV, so maybe we just need to do some adjusting.The only negative is that the screen does tend to pick up some glare from lamps and light coming thru windows, but I'm not sure that can be avoided? Also this baby is heavy .... At around 100 pounds it was all my wife could do to help me hoist it onto a stand. If you are wall mounting make sure to invite over a couple strong friends.

Profitt", "ReviewID": "R1JGFMRRQ1LEKI", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "First the good. For the most part, this tv has a nice picture with almost uniform blacks (my lower left is always bright). The DNLA server is nice if you have a home NAS or other media server. However, almost every other aspect of the smart TV features are not useful. The software is slow, the browser does not support modern flash or quicktime (Yes, sites that work on my iPad don't even work on this tv). The youtube software can not let you log in, so you have to do manual searches for everything, and it automatically plays sometimes inappropriate videos as soon as the software loads. IT IS NOT KID FRIENDLY!Now the foolish: One of my 4 VESA bolt sockets was mis-threaded, and no M8 or other bolt would fit in the hole. Clearly, cheap foreign parts with poor spec control. The speakers vibrate - a lot - even at low volumes. This is very annoying, forcing you to use a separate sound system to watch any television show (unless you like constant vibration from your speakers).I would not recommend this tv to others - especially if you want to hang it on a wall or use the built in speakers.EDIT: After a couple of months, it has stopped working with my Yamaha receiver. If I turn on the receiver, the signal drops to zero. I can watch this happen on the signal checking page. Also, if I plug my computer (and I would assume any device) into an HDMI in, the signal drops to zero (if the computer is on - if I turn off the receiver or computer, the signal comes back immediately). If you plan to use this tv to control your receiver or use a receiver to broadcast the sound, it will not work with television signals (works fine with DNLA).

With some research I have come to learn that this is much less of a problem then it once was.  Day one, delivery was pretty smooth, and only an hour into the 3 hour window.  \"White glove\" was nonexistant.  I had one guy that brought out the TV, and I did not get to see what he did on the back of the truck, or how he got the unit off the truck, but he got it to the door and I helped him get it in the house. This was not a one man job. I was pretty surprised at how heavy this television was. I replaced a 65 in Mitsubishi DLP that was a great television, but it was getting very spoty as it continued to lose pixils, it was also less then half the weight.  I originally replaced that TV with a 73 \" Mits. but sent it back because it had a limited amount of connections available, thought it did have a great picture.  DLP is a great format for big screens, and inexpensive to buy, but once they start to go bad, it is an expensive fix that is better invested in a new TV. Got the unit out hooked it up to the cable, and was blown away by the picture.  I am very impressed, and after exhustive research feel that I have made a great decision. This is as good a picture as I got from the Vizio that I was interested in buying, but gave up.  The color needs your own tweeks, and the brightness needs to be adjusted, there is also a little splochy look sometimes in the faces, but otherwise there is little I had a problem with.  The one MAJOR fault with this TV is that it is in zoom1, which cuts off the outer edges of the picture.  I did a side by side with my Mits. 65, and there was a pretty good portion of the outside of the picture that could not be seen.  Not enough to make a significant difference, but it's something to get use to.  It comes with two remotes, the main remote is fairly easy to use, but the navigation buttons, are hard to use (up and down), because they are too close to other fumcton buttons. The shake remote that is a little bit of a bonus works great, but doesn't always point as it is suppose to.  I have a PS 3 and a Wii connected to this television, and I am truely pleased with the results. The 3D effects are really not that deep, but I am happy with it.  Found out the hard way that the 250's are the only glasses that worked with this TV.  My wife and I watched the 3D channels available from DirecTV, and was impressed, but only to a point.  Movies (2D), have been amazing, and the sports action, has been like none I've watch previously.  Kudos to DirecTV for the cooperation that was extended to me, when I discovered that my receiver would not carry the signal.  They replace my DVR in 4 days, and charged me nothing.  The fact that the PS 3 can carry a 3D signal also saved me a good chunk of change.  After a couple of days I did learn to use the other function of the smart apps, and hooked up to NetFlicks, and I am very pleased with the experience.  I am returning this item, though, but only to exchange it.  Upon further inspection of the shipping materiel, and the box that this television came in, it appears that there is a possibility that this item could have been dropped.  Though this item does work now, I do not feel comfortable that there may be a ticking bomb sitting in front of me.  I would highly recommend this television, however, to anyone who's looking for a great TV at a reasonable price.

After spending hours on the internet and at Best Buy I went for a 60\" Samsung 550. I got it home and after messing with for a few hours with the same substandard picture I took it back.If I am to put out over a grand for a TV, I want a damn good picture! The salesman at the Best Buy could not understand the problem and hooked up the Samsung. He thought the picture was great. I thought it sucked.

I had to make an appointment so I left the TV at the store with the understanding I would return the next day.The next day I decided that Best Buy had nothing that would satisfy me. Plus I felt the salesmen did not really know what they were talking about or had low standards for what they liked. I went to a few other stores and happened upon a store that had the LG 60pz950. The salesmen were like gaga over it and I was not sure about it because of the name brand. I had heard that the top of the line plasma TVs were the Samsung and Panasonic. The salesman was very knowledgeable about the TVs the store sold - and he had high standards.I sat down and watched the LG. There was a top of the line Panasonic plasma just below it next to it as were some Samsungs. The salesman showed me how to set preset settings on it and I was blown away by the quality of the picture - especially the THX settings. At home I just set it up and the quality is just amazing! I have not had to tweak this or that - things I have no idea what they do. Plug it in, choose a setting (sports, games, movies, etc), and just enjoy.My boys play PS3 a lot and the gaming picture was stunning. The detail is phenomenal. I was impressed and the boys love it.

For starters, even thought it comes with a web browser it's pretty much worthless since they have flash player 8.0 hard coded and it cannot be upgraded so don't plan on watching any videos using the web browser.  Only an idiot would have designed it this way. I looked for workarounds and even contacted LG's support to see if anything could be done.  The answer was \"No\" and that there was no way the flash player could be upgraded.  This really sucks, but what makes it suck even worse is that when I complained about how stupid the situation was I was told by the tech \"We never said that it would work\".  IMHO that's like buying a new car and finding out that the brakes don't work and being told by the manufacturer that \"we never said the brakes would work\".  In addition to the unresolvable flash problem, one of the LG apps on the TV, MediaLink which is the interface to play movies and music from the PlexMedia Server stopped working, displaying an error message that it can not find the media server.  This error displays after it has found the media server (it displays the name), it just can't connect.  The issue is with the MediaLink app itself which is owned and maintained by, you guessed it LG.  There is a forum for this issue with what appears to be hundreds of users reporting the same issue but it was reported over a year ago and there has been no progress whatsoever.  Bottom line...I get the impression that LG doesn't give a damn about their customers.

So I was sold to plasmas again and plus I've already owned a plasma and was very satisfied with it. My old plasma was not HD ready, so the new one of course must be HD ready and support 1080p of resolution and at least 50 inches on size.  Wow the prices gone so low for plain plasmas, you could get some good ones under $1000. Other features that they are not important, but also will be nice to have are the 3D and Internet capability.  I came across this LG Infinia 50PZ950, brand new model for 2011 and for the features and price it seemed a good deal. Plus the no interest for 24 months, 30 days returns policy, and free shipping.  I've gave it a try.  Came in 1 week and the delivery was great, the delivery person helped me to open the box and test the TV. It is a nice looking TV and the HD channels look great.  It was very easy to setup. What we were disappointed was the magic remote. For quick operations it is actually good, but for a bit more complex things it gets very difficult; you are pointing all over and it gets very frustrating to get to the right spot. The other thing that we were disappointed was the SD channels or Standard Digital channels didn't look good at all. My old Samsung in this regards looked better, probably because it was a 42 inch vs. a 50 inch.  So I tried a lot of different things to check if it was not a reception issue.  We used the LG TV for 2 weeks and really not totally happy with the overall. I wanted to test the 3D, but we must purchase the 3D glasses and probably also a blue-ray with 3D capabilities.  The glasses for this LG are expensive, at least $100 each.  Since we were not pleased with the SD channels quality from the cable box, we decided to get another plasma TV and compare side by side with this TV.  I really wanted to get this other TV from Amazon, but I was almost up to my credit limit on my Amazon credit card.  So went to BestBuy, by the way going to my BestBuy store was not a really good experience; it seems that they don't want to help you or sell you anything or really don't care.  So we purchased the Samsung PN51D7000 at Bestbuy.com, the delivery took a week also and the guys bringing the TV didn't help in testing if the TV actually works, so delivery for Amazon was better in this regards. The nice thing about this Samsung is that it had a promotion that included 2 3D glasses and 3 3D Movies + 2 to redeem on the mail, but this TV price was couple of hundred more that the LG.  This Samsung is 1 inch bigger (51 inch vs. LG 50), but actually the LG on my eyes seems to be bigger (probably because of the bigger border). We liked more the appearance of this Samsung compare with the LG and also the picture and contrast and some other features, like PIP and smart hub.  We were able to try the 3D on this Samsung and it was amazing. The Samsung remote control is kind of cheap for this model, not really a big deal for us.  By the way the applications or games from LG are lame and again very difficult even to play with the magic remote.  The games from Samsung also lame, I won't be playing games anyway with the plasma. We still have with the Samsung bad SD channels, but somehow not as bad as the LG. So we upgraded our cable package to HD.  We have this basic Comcast service that it is included with our home association.  So to upgrade we needed to rent the HD box for $8.39/month and also $3.99/month to get more HD channels. Very, very worth it also we have 2 3D stations and some free on demand 3D movies.Well, so we decided to keep the Samsung.  For me it was a difficult decision, the LG had one or 2 things that were better, like in my opinion the picture detail it was better with the LG.  For example when looking at people's faces, you could actually see more detail than compare with the Samsung.  But the blacks and contrast on the Samsung are better than the LG.", "Date": "June 2, 2011"}, {"Title": "Extremely Dissatisfied", "Author": "Stephanie", "ReviewID": "R1J5PZFGH7GBH6", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "well the TV picture is awesome but if you want to stream video from netflix apparently there is no way to get the widescreen movies to view full screen therefore you have black bars on top and bottom.

If you have a surround sound receiver that doesn't have the digital simplink you arre out a few bucks there as well because you have to find an RCA to digital converter to get it to work.I spent a fortune on the TV and bought the special glasses(3) and an LG 3D DVD player to go with it and feel totally taken and wish I would have done more research.....I actually did read everything I found on this TV prior to buying it and never saw any of these problems posted.

I can't believe Amazon doesn't automatically offer 10-20% off the next TV purchase when something like this happens. For a company that prides itself on customer service, their policy is mediocre.Both the tv's I got had the same exact issues.- Cracks across the screen- Loud buzzing noise once the TV was turned on- You can hear the static but no picture whatsoever (I tried playing around with the remote, changing the channel, menu etc but you couldn't see a single thing).I don't know if this is an LG problem or somehow I ended up with two tv's in a row that were damaged during shipping. But either way you couldn't pay me enough to try one of these again. I had to call customer service several times within the 2 week span to schedule delivery, try and get them to deliver it earlier seeing that I ordered the tv specifically in time for the beginning of football season, and finally for a refund.After talking to a rep I finally got him to give me 10% off the next order and free 2-day shipping on the next tv purchase.
