{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Fantastic, Thin Flat Panel", "Author": "J. Wutt", "ReviewID": "R1YGXH0MHG63WP", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I have had this TV for 4 days so far, and I can't say enough positive about things about it.  The set up was easy, and the amount of control you have for the picture settings is very in depth.  The extra warranty of the 860 (18 months instead of 12 months for the 850) is a nice perk. The blue TOC (Touch of Color) is barely noticeable, it really looks black/graphite grey unless you look very closely.  The good news is that the 'halo effect' that some owners of the 750 have complained about is non-existent on the 860.  I also love the swivel stand because I did not wall mount this TV even though it is exceptionally thin.Plugged in my HD cable box and new Blu-ray player via HDMI and everything has worked perfectly so far.  The picture is stunning, and there are so many functions and features that I just haven't gone through all of them yet.On the flip side, there is a lag if you are using the little circle dial on the remote.  Better off just clicking up, down, left, or right instead of spinning the dial around and waiting for the TV to react.I don't have surround sound yet, but the TV speakers aren't too bad.  Hard to rave about fake surround sound from tiny TV speakers, but that's expected.Overall, I would recommend this TV without hesitation this to anyone looking for a new 1080p LCD TV.", "Date": "September 20, 2008"}, {"Title": "AWESOME TV!!!", "Author": "J.

Fantastic picture! 18 month warranty & was given an additional 3 months warranty for registering it online with SAMSUNG. Super thin and light weight.

Ramirez \"IsRa\"", "ReviewID": "R2VZGUZOGLPT5G", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I purchased this product through Amazon from Electronics Expo. I received the TV on time, spent 5 hours setting it up with my home theater and making sure everything was perfect. The picture quality is absolutely amazing. 4 Days later while watching the basketball game, the TV made a loud popping noise and turned off. I was unable to get a picture after that. I contacted Electronics Expo thinking they would just send me a new one since the one I bought was defective. Boy, was I wrong. The person I spoke to went on for several minutes about their policy and made me feel like it was my fault the TV died. He said there was nothing they could do and asked me to call Samsung. I then contacted Samsung and was told they would need to send a service tech out to look at the TV but it would be about a week before he could come out. I had no choice so I waited, took the day off from work when he was scheduled and then he didn't even come out. He called me the day of and asked what the problem was and I told him. He said there was no need for him to come since he knew what was wrong with the TV. He said he would have to replace the panel but did not have any available and would have to order one. He said they would call me to re-schedule the service. It has now been 3 weeks and I am still without a TV. I have contacted Samsung and they tell me to call the local service center but when I do I get an answering machine. I tried contacting Electronics Expo to see if they could call Samsung on my behalf. I was made to feel like a nuisance but afetr talking to a supervisor she took my information and said she would call Samsung on my behalf and would call me back to let me know what they said. I never heard back from her. Needless to say, this purchase has been a nightmare. I had to send in my credit card payment for the purchase price of the TV already. It doesn't feel good paying over 2 grand for a product that doesn't work. I am not giving this TV a bad rating, it is a wonderful TV, but I feel its necessary to warn other people before they purchase through Electronics Expo.", "Date": "April 1, 2009"}, {"Title": "Buy it!  WOW HD movies!", "Author": "AJ", "ReviewID": "R7TJLQT1WZPME", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Crisp, crystal clear HD picture is my first thoughts of the 860.  The first movie I watched on my LN52A860 was The Dark Knight on blue ray.  The first scene of the movie appeared like a realistic 3D picture, so clear it was scary!  I felt like I was right there in the movie.  I've noticed that other reviews at different sites state problems with IR interference (infer red) from the back light with different remotes.  Does not effect Directv receiver or my Onkyo 706 or blue ray BDP-S550.  The TV does have slight clouding on the corners (seems like all will have slight clouding due to the slim design and the back light).  This can only be seen on black scenes. Nothing really noticeable to shake a stick at as far as clouding. Again it can only be seen on a black screen and does not effect any picture quality.  The interface is easy to use.  The auto motion Plus is really neat.  Be sure to see it in demo mode were it shows half the screen with the motion plus vs non motion plus. Warrantee:  18 months plus the 3 months added on when registered with Samsung for a total of 21 months is just awesome.  One can not really see the touch of blue color unless there is light behind it or in a really bright room.  Not too many LCD's have this clear of a picture IMO.  If you can't see an 860 on the show room check out an 850 as they are very similar as far as picture quality.  The TV can pull movies and pictures off your network if you have them on your computer to share.  Really neat to show a slide show on a 52\".  No regrets here..

Breathtaking clarity!  Easy to set up.  Samsung has a problem with these TV's (older models as well as this newer model) in that there appears to be an incompatability problem with Comcast HD-HDMI cable boxes.  The problem is that when the TV is connected to the HD-HDMI cable box with HDMI cables, there are chronic audio drops (i.e. audio cuts out repeatedly on most channels). (No problem with Blue Ray DVD player performance) I solved the problem by searching complaint blogs and following a suggestion to use component video cables instead of HDMI cables. This works with no affect on HD performance.  But it's a shame that the product does not work \"right out of the box\" as any customer should expect.An additional problem I have is that the backlight does not turn on when the TV is cold (i.e. first start up in the morning or later in the day after the TV has been off for a few hours.This results in no picture, although sound is fine.  Backlight does turn on after turning off the TV and then turning it on again.  Very annoying.

I have had my TV for about 2 months now, and I could not be happier. I spent about 5 weeks searching for a new TV late last year. I looked at a variety of manufacturers, including, Sony, Pioneer, Panasonic, LG, Toshiba and some others, and it seemed that i could not find a better picture(in my eyes) than the Samsung 860. The price range is a little cheaper than Sony, for the size of a TV that you are looking for, whether it be 46\", 52\" or larger. The 1080p resolution, the 120Hz motion speed option, the 50,000:1 dynamic contrast,(for some reason, the Sony Bravia TV's do not list the contrast ratio on their models?) and the 4MS response time are all the latest technical features that give you the best possible picture availiable now. The older Samsung models such as the 750, 650 and 550 series are not nearly as clear as the 860 series, and from what i have read, have had technical issues in the past. This TV has so many picture options and adjustments(some adjustments are not really noticeable) that it takes a couple days to go through the manual, this allows you to customize your picture to however you like it! The TV is only 1.5 inch thick or about 60LBS heavy which makes any kind of wall mounting much easier then the older and much heavier models. The picture is so life like it's like looking out a window, however there is one minor problem, there is a little glare of the screen that makes daytime viewing a little more difficult. The older models such as the 650 and 550 series, are alot worse and have more glare than the 860, so you have to think, a little, about putting your TV against a wall where the sun does not shine directly onto the screen. It's not like the TV is un-watchable during the day, its just that you may have to move a little closer to the TV, to not see as much glare, during daytime viewing. You also have to consider getting a surround sound system(if you don't already have one) as with the TV only being 1.5\" thick, the speakers can only be so big, to be ablt to fit in the frame, but the sound is ok from the TV if you have to use it, considering how small the speakers have to be.All in all, I am VERY happy with this TV, all my friends and family that I have shown this TV to, are as amazed at the picture quality as i am, this Samsung 860 will change the way you enjoy watching anything from sports, movies or regular network channels, ENJOY!!!", "Date": "March 18, 2009"}, {"Title": "Phenomenal transaction with Electronics Expo, TV is awesome", "Author": "Witold Jachimczyk \"Witek Jachimczyk\"", "ReviewID": "R102YENRHK2BDQ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I am truly satisfied with this purchase.

Upon closer look (about 5 inches from the screen), I saw a very-very dim image of pictures, menus, etc.I called Samsung customer service and they have schedule the in-home service appointment within a week.  I had to take the TV off the wall per instructions of the tech support.  Upon inspection, the repairman has ordered new parts, inverter and the entire panel, as he wasn't 100% sure what has failed.In a few weeks, he came back with a new inverter, installed it and voila, the picture is back.  Not for long though... Three days later, the TV would not even turn on!  After another week of waiting, another technician came over with new parts, tried the new main board and the TV is back online.  Not for long though...After the back panel was placed back, the TV would not turn on, so the tech had to take off the back panel again.  He checked the connections and found one wire \"semi\"-loose.  After connecting it back, the TV worked fine and upon further checking, the new main board was not required - the problem was the loose wire from the first tech.The second issue was circumstantial; however, my previous Sony rear projection HDTV did not have issues for over 4 years, that is why I am concerned about the quality of my Samsung TV.Though my experience with this TV was not very smooth, I have to admit that it has exceptional picture quality (it was even better before the new inverter though).Pros:Picture QualityAppearance (1.9\" depth)DLNA (I was able to play most of my movies over 1Gbs network)Infolink (though I don't use it too much)USB ports (Pics, movies, etc)21-month in-home warrantyCons:Questionable built qualitySomewhat convoluted menusNo picture aspect button!!!!!!!!Some back inputs might become inaccessible with some wall mounts (I lost 2 component inputs with my mount)Samsung's PC streaming server is extremely outdated and not very user friendly", "Date": "June 22, 2009"}, {"Title": "Fantastic first HDTV Big Screen", "Author": "Storyteller \"Storyteller\"", "ReviewID": "R3B95MNB947HOZ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Apologies for the short review as my time is limited right now ... but ... this Samsung is bottom line awesome.
