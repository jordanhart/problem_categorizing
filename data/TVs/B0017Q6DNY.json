{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Buyer Beware", "Author": "reallyme07", "ReviewID": "R1AOIEQR7991CD", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "This television was purchased in February 09 and worked like a charm until mid September 09. The television would turn off sporadically by itself at first, but would turn back on. Not even a day later, the screen would go dark, but the power light would remain lit as if it were on. It was a toss up on whether the screen would come back lit or if the unit shut itself down. RCA Technical Support people are really slow and pretty much useless. And the warranty is only \"parts only\" after 90 days up until a year. Upon research of the problem, a electronics experts told me that this is a VERY common problem among this brand of television. RCA licenses their name to a company called TTE Electronics whom is the manufacturer. He also told me that the television would be officially dead when the power light stay emits and the speaker makes a soft \"popping\" noise. As of press time, the television has done exactly that, and RCA still has not done anything to resolve the issue, but they seem to already know who I am when I call (shows how much I've called). But the television was a great buy....until it stopped working. From now on, I'll stick to actual RCA manufactured products like their stellar audio products.", "Date": "October 25, 2009"}, {"Title": "L32HD31 Review", "Author": "S. Pruitt", "ReviewID": "RJ3N257Z1XV3X", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Great product.  I've owned this set for about a month and haven't had any problems.  Picture comes in crystal clear.  DVD playback with HDMI connection is stellar.  XBox 360 looks wonderful on this TV.  Also a great price for this product.  I'd shop around in your local stores before purchasing it online.  You can probably find it for less money than what this site is selling it for.  But great product overall.", "Date": "September 1, 2008"}, {"Title": "Better than expected...", "Author": "Kraig", "ReviewID": "R2GKNU26J1O4P8", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Setup was easy and once the TV scanned for channels I was watching within minutes. I had to adjust the color balance a bit as it tended to be a bit heavy on yellow. I also noticed the greenish glow around hair and skin tones but I quickly realized this was only on analog channels. Once I switch to an HD channel it cleared up. The TV is much happier when in HD. Non HD channels look fine but the TV really shows off when displaying pure digital HD. Sound is adequate but not great. Overall, for the price this TV is perfect as a second in a bedroom or office. I rarely give 5 stars to anything. The sound and lack of a swivel base keep this TV to a solid 4 stars. Still very good.", "Date": "February 28, 2009"}, {"Title": "Don't lose/break your RCA remote!!!!", "Author": "Becky", "ReviewID": "RUYJQTF71H83B", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "You CANNOT program a Directtv or universal remote to RCA HDTV's, not even the RCA universal remotes.  So if you lose the original remote it comes with (or your new puppy chews it to pieces) you have to order an original replacement.  Each RCA rep you talk to will give you a different excuse as to why they will not program, obviously they have no idea why.", "Date": "February 8, 2013"}, {"Title": "Fanastic", "Author": "Zerocco", "ReviewID": "RKL6HC9YXP6XR", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I had originally purchased this television in 2009 for around $309.

Schroeder", "ReviewID": "R3Q9S42R8N5TVF", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I bought this tv in November and loved it, until February when it started turning itself off.  By the end of March, it wouldn't turn on at all.  RCA's tech support was not at all helpful -- apparently this problem is not in their script.  Customer service is a misnomer -- they were rude and unhelpful.  I took it to an \"authorized dealer\" who I am going to have to pay labor because the warranty is only 90 days.  Even he got the runaround and couldn't get the part -- backordered for 12 months!  After 4 WEEKS at the repair shop and their daily calls, RCA \"authorized\" a replacement tv and here I am almost 6 WEEKS after bringing it in with no tv.  Also, RCA's website lists as problems the tv stand for this model. How bad did it have to be for them to actually acknowledge it? This tv is not worth it at any price.  Notice all the good reviews are within weeks of purchasing the tv.  I would have said that too, in January.  Now, I will never buy RCA again and I suggest that you don't either.", "Date": "May 22, 2009"}, {"Title": "Recommend Refurb. tv", "Author": "Matt", "ReviewID": "R3CTU43YOK0D6K", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Brand new this tv has problems or so ive read, but i got this at big lots for a little over 300 remanufactured in 08 or 09 & have used it since everyday without issue, the only problem i have now is the screen is not as bright as it used to be other than that it works 100% has a built in hdtv tuner for antennas & also has hdmi for 720p hd videoes & games they look great, also has s-video/composite & even component inputs... standard def. looks bad but thats normal on an hdtv flatscreen remote still works too, but i was never able to find codes for my directv controller so i had to use 2 remotes kindof a bummer, but i made do, i up graded to a 40inch led & the only real difference i notice is its brighter and bigger still would make a good bedroom tv. Very happy rca is still making quality products at least the refurb. ones, thats all i exclusivly buy these days as they go back & fix the problems & replace the troubled parts & makes them last much longer than the brand new ones. Sure they may have some scuffs and scratch or two but 9 times out of 10 they last longer than the new ones.", "Date": "December 25, 2013"}, {"Title": "great tv", "Author": "D.
