The factory default settingsare very good with no obvious deficiencies.If your concerned about this set being only 60Hz, don't.I have watched basketball and football on this setand have not experienced any lagging, blurring, etc.Yes it only has 3 HDMI inputs, but for me it's plenty enough.I use 1 for my HD box connection and another for my PS3.I'm currently shopping for a new surround sound systemwhich will use my 3rd and final input.Speaking of sound, granted it's not the best coming out ofthe set, but its not as bad as some may make it out to be.All in all, I have to rank this as the best deal on the marketfor a 52\" LCD set. I spent 3 months researching and comparingprices before I decided on this one.", "Date": "November 27, 2009"}, {"Title": "Nice TV", "Author": "PKMAN", "ReviewID": "R3CZUXGCQOPJXZ", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Bought it at the local BB a few months ago. Could've gotten more features from other brands at about the same price; or same features and size for less money but wife wanted a Sony, so for our budget we had to settle for this entry model.  The set up was very easy and overall very user-friendly.Had the same dimming problem many had. Tried to download the fix via Sony's website but the TV woudln't recognize any of my USB drive, so we called Sony to send a drive to us and problem mostly fixed.  On some of the dark scenes it seems like the TV still want to dimm out but is fighting itself.The stand feels kind of flimsy but is holding up so far.  The internal speakers are surprisingly good.  Not surround or anything but they are loud and relatively clean.  The TV quality is good so for fast-action sport games.Overall, it's a very nice unit.", "Date": "September 22, 2009"}, {"Title": "Brillant High-Def TV...

Match this with a surround sound system and you'll feel like it's a movie theater in your home. I use this TV also for gaming and I've used it a LOT and haven't had any problems. It's energy saving modes are nice too and uses the same amount of electricity as a smaller 32\" CRT TV.Update as of May 2010: So after owning this TV for less than a year I am already having problems with the backlights, several of them blew out, so half the screen looks dim, and apparently there is no simple way to repair this, it could cost a fortune for repairs. So I am left with watching a half lit TV for a few more years just to get my money's worth out of it then I will be looking for a less complex TV that won't be prone to problems...

We didn't think it would be the \"main\" tv as we have another larger one in our living room, but boy were we wrong!  My husband and I are always using this tv..we have to get the kids off of it all the time.  Not because the Wii is on it, (they have a PS3 on the larger one) but they like the picture better!  We did notice while watching a movie that the quality of picture kept getting dark, so I came here on Amazon to read reviews hoping to fix the problem.  Well, Amazon reviewers came thru again...we downloaded very easily from the Sony website the \"auto dimming patch\", followed instructions on how to upload it onto the tv and within 3 minutes the picture was perfect!

I had read that LCD's no longer had viewing angle problems, but this one does.  It looks good from directly in front of it, but from the sides it looses contrast badly.  I wasn't impressed with the black levels either.I ended up getting a plasma and am much happier.

At first I was intimidated by its size and surprised at how small the manuel is for it. Although I was able to set it up physically, electrically and internally quite easily, I still found it somewhat confusing at times in reference to the internal adjustments (the ones needed for my individual needs and preferences). These adjustments were not always clear nor even defined as to what would happen if I did this or that. But in the long run all came out in the end without to much difficulty. Also, one must be careful when setting it up to keep the screen away from anything that can cause glare or be ready to put curtains up [as I ended up doing :-)].The picture quality of this TV is absolutly stunning. There are  multiple choices of screen size and resolution inputs. Colors are sharp, well defined, clear.I was totally shocked by the quality of sound from this set. I have a Sony Home Theatre System to go with this TV [I like the Bravia Link feature}, but I naturally tried just the TV speakers. There is a simulated surround sound option that is resonably affective. Although it doesn't have the completeness of a home theatre system, but it still has an impressive enough effect on ones audio senses so that one may consider forgoing the entire home theatre system.The remote control was initually intimitating, too, with its miriad of buttons. But with a little practice I found navigation rather straight forward.I did a lot of research, over a year, before deciding on this set. I was still leary when I purchased it. But after these few weeks of ownership I feel I made a great purchase. I don't think one can go wrong with this set. It is hard to beat especially for the price.

Reynolds", "ReviewID": "R3OKDO1PPO3PBG", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Ok, I'll make this short and sweet. At least I'll try to.Here: find the positive reviews, and listen to them. Ignore the negative reviews.Still want to hear more? Fine. I warned you.I worked for Sony for a few years, and if it wasn't for their inflated pricing, everything in my house would have a Sony logo on it. Then this TV came along.Here's a not-so-secret suggestion: Purchase a Sony TV around Super Bowl time- you'll combine retailer's Super Bowl sales with the timing of old models clearing out. Seriously, you want to pay $300-600 more to have a 2010 vs a 2009 TV? I want your paycheck.I worried a bit about it only being 60 Hz for as large as it is, thinking the size would magnify any ghosting or lag. Negative- maybe if I was watching a SD signal over rabbit ears. Hooked this beauty up to an HD satellite signal, and have been watching the NBA All-Star stuff, and fast-paced Olympic events with ZERO lag or ghosting. Sweet.A couple people commented on viewing angle? Puhleeze. It's awesome.Ok, news flash: the sound isn't stellar...but it's not really better or worse than other LCD TVs I've owned. And who cares? I have everything hooked up to my receiver. I'm not about to own a 52\" TV and not take advantage of the home theater experience.I didn't think I'd like 2 of the HDMI connections on the side, but I'll admit it's a heck of a lot easier connecting everything when it's mounted on the wall. (Hint: use a Cheetah Mounts APTMM2B Tilt Wall Mount for 32\"-55\" Plasma and LCD TVs and Displays, it was a great deal).All in all, I was pleasantly surprised to see the Sony among the least expensive in that size range. Ok, so I got a killer deal, but still! With as nice as this LCD is, it's hard to imagine it being the 'bottom' range of their lineup. It's a Sony TV.

The price has dropped so much (was $1800 in June) it's a steal. No problems with viewing angles, and we had a packed rooms for superbowl.

Recently the picture developed horrible lines so you couldnt see a thing. Sony Customer service was horrible. It was on a warranty but the tech arrived after the promised time frame, took pictures of the problem and I heard nothing from Sony. After a week I called them and they said they would replace the unit with a new one. Two days later the tech calls and says he has a part to install to fix it. The tech again did not arrive during the promised time. Both times I had to take time off work and the guy did not arrive until after 5pm!Sony no longer sells extended warranties for their products effective July 2012. I thought all these companies made money on these warranties. I guess if your products are shoddy and you have to repair or replace a bunch of them it doesnt pay so you just get out of the warranty business.I own 2 Sony Bravia Tv's, 2 Sony Vaio computers and 2 Sony cameras, a Sony DVD player and a Sony entertainment center.

I remember the first symptom was a green vertical line that appeared towards the right side of the screen, but it would go away after the TV was on for some time - and this first symptom appeared in January 2010. Later on the symptoms became progressively worse such as dimming on the right side and maybe 2 or 3 lines that appeared vertically. But all of these symptoms would go away after the TV was on for some time. The dimming got progressively worse again and turned into flickering on the right side sometime in 2011, but the problems would still go away after the TV was on for 30 min to an hour. The final symptom was that I would get no picture at all and I would have to keep the TV on, turn it off and back on again and the picture would come back.
