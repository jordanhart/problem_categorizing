{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Superb TV...Have Edge Lit LED's reached their Golden Age?", "Author": "John", "ReviewID": "RD24KKPWQOOP", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "To provide a little background, I had originally ordered the Samsung UN60F7500 and after receiving two TV's with physically noticeable manufacturing defects (both manufactured the same day in the same plant, go figure!), I opted to receive a refund and try an entirely new brand. I was glad this happened because I hadn't realized what I was missing until I received the Sony KDL-55W900A. Now before I begin, keep in mind that the Samsung F7500 is essentially a semi-step down from the F8000, which would be the W900A's direct competitor. So, take any comparisons I make with a grain of salt as I am only able to provide my own personal experiences with the products I've had the pleasure of owning. The difference between the Samsung F7500 and F8000 is 1) a slightly higher artificial motion rate (most videophiles turn off motion processing anyways) and 2) 2x the scanning of number of zones in an image for micro dimming purposes, so essentially dimming at more local of a level than the F7500, as well as precision black dimming capabilities (in other words, deeper, richer, more accurate blacks than the F7500).-----PICTURE QUALITY TRUMPS SIZE-----At first, I was afraid that going from a 60\" to a 55\" would be a huge letdown; after all, you lose ~20% screen area when downgrading. However, the noticeable improvements in quality control and picture quality from my 60\" TV more than make up for the smaller screen. Simply put, my W900A has perfect screen uniformity. Zero clouding, zero DSE, zero banding, and little to absolute zero flashlighting (depending on what your backlight and brightness are set at). The picture quality is extremely impressive: rich colors, impressive blacks, and great motion handling, which I will touch on in the Pros section further down. (Note: towards the bottom of my review is an Update dated 3/21/14 in which I introduce another 2013 Sony TV set option for those that refuse to \"downgrade\" to a 55\" TV).-----QUALITY CONTROL-----I had come from a 2009 Samsung LCD as well as briefly owning a 2013 Samsung F7500, and I can attest that both TV's had their own quality control issues. In the case of the more recent F7500, the flashlighting was extremely noticeable regardless of my backlight/brightness level (claimed to have been non-existent at mid-backlight settings by most owners I had spoken with on the web) and a large blob of light was always noticeable on the right side of my screen during dark scenes (although I must admit that they had fixed the majority of clouding and banding issues that plagued the 2012 Samsung ES models). However, I couldn't help but feel that Samsung was still about playing a panel lottery until you get the right one. Unfortunately, their quality control on TVs has a long ways to go before I consider another high-end Samsung TV.As soon as I turned on the W900A and turned off the Eco Sensor to get it nice and bright, I calibrated using Disney's WOW calibration disc (my suggested calibration settings are towards the end of the review) and went through a few movie scenes in search for screen issues. I made sure to pop in \"300\" on Blu Ray to look for any vertical banding that was especially noticeable in \"300\" on one of my prior sets. No banding issues. I placed in a few other movies to look for severe flashlighting while having the backlight at 100%. It was there, but barely even there, especially when compared to the F7500. I also looked for uniformity issues, clouding, etc. Although I had grown used to a panel lottery with prior sets, I finally found a TV that I only had to order ONCE and had zero issues out of the box. I watched \"Star Trek\" and Harry Potter's final movie all the way through and must say that the blacks are \"out of this world\" good. Very rich--almost (but not quite) plasma quality. Of course, you have to tweak with the settings to get the blacks looking nice and black (I had LED Dynamic Control on Standard, which really helped create those rich blacks).-----PROS-----1. RICH, DEEP colors. Sony's Triluminos technology widens the color gamut available for viewing. Although I have read that the source you are viewing must support the wider color gamut, I still feel that it must be doing its job regardless because in my opinion, the TV produces a rich field of colors on the screen that you'll salivate over. Especially when watching animated films. I do not believe this technology can be turned off (I haven't found a setting specifically related to Triluminos), but there is an option for Live Color that has 4 different settings (including OFF) to make colors pop out even more. I found that every setting but LOW was over saturating the colors a bit, which should give you some perspective on how colorful this TV is without using any color enhancements.2. VERY impressive black levels. Not plasma blacks, but for an LED set, I have never seen blacks this deep. The LED Dynamic control is excellent. I found that I did not need to use the Black Corrector setting as even on LOW, the blacks were being crushed. However, with LED Dynamic Control on Standard and Gamma at -1/-2, the blacks are insanely nice to view.3. High native refresh rate and realistic-looking motion processing. 240Hz is always a plus and Sony's Motionflow works very well. Unlike my Samsung TV's where I've seen noticeable juddering/stuttering images no matter the preset setting I used, Sony's does a great job of not making video look artificial. Of course, you can manually adjust your Samsung TV's motion processing to decrease judder and stutter, but I really like the fact that Sony's works right out of the box as the average consumer does not have the patience or know-how to adjust these settings.4. Input lag is one of the best on the market for 2013 LED's. In fact, only two other TV's beat the W900A in the 2013 lineup and they are also Sony TV's. This was another HUGE plus coming from a Samsung. Sony's W900A has a consistent 17-19ms response time in graphics and game mode whereas my Samsung TVs both struggled to make it into the 40's (mostly averaged 50-52ms in game mode for both sets). Sony timed this TV set perfectly with the PS4 release!5. Impressive viewing angle. I'll start with my background: all of my prior TV's (both LCD and LED lit) had noticeably poor viewing angles. You could notice a substantial difference in picture quality just from moving from the center to the edge of the couch (which is only moving about 3 feet to the left/right on my couch and at roughly a 25 degree angle from the center of the TV). I hadn't had a comparison, so I thought this was relatively normal in LCD/LED TV sets. However, the W900A's viewing angle is so wide that I can sit at the edge of the couch or even in a sitting chair to the left of my couch and still not sacrifice picture quality. By the time I sit in the chair to the left of my couch, I've moved ~6 feet from the center of the TV at around a 50 degree angle, but the screen fade is barely noticeable (yes, it's noticeable, but only if you're really trying to focus on it).-----CONS-----1. If you're into Smart TV functions and apps, look elsewhere. If you use a 3rd party streaming device like a PS3/PS4, Roku, or Apple TV, then this shouldn't matter anyways. Sony has the typical apps like Netflix, Amazon, and Hulu Plus, but they are far behind Samsung in this field. The user interface is clunky compared to Samsung's and the appstore is...well...there isn't one. There are preloaded apps on the TV that you will be unable to delete and that's about that. Although, I can say I am glad Sony no longer relies on the XMB interface as that was even harder to navigate.2. The TV only comes in 55\" in the US. I believe they have 42\" and 46\" variants overseas, but here we have one option: 55\". This is especially disheartening for those TV enthusiasts such as myself who are converting over from 60\" and 65\" sets. In order to get a 60\" Sony, you have to stoop down 3 pricing tiers to the R550A, which means a lot of the video processing that you get with the W900A will be non-existent and the panel, among other parts, may not be as high of quality. Since writing this review, Sony introduced the W850A, which is a 65\" TV that I talk about in my Update dated 3/21/14 below.-----SUMMARY-----If you are on the edge about this edge-lit LED TV, I would recommend you get it and try it out for yourself. If the small size is bothering you, take comfort in knowing that I adjusted to it relatively quickly when realizing how superior the PQ is to other sets I've watched. If you are a gamer, this TV is a MUST. The input lag is great and games look amazingly rich in color and contrast with Sony's Triluminos and X Reality Pro technologies. Even avid movie watchers will have a difficult time not admiring this TV. A+ in my book.-----UPDATE (08/20/13)-----The TV is still impressing me every time I turn it on. I recently hooked up my computer to the TV and the picture looks great. I've hooked up my PC to TV's in the past and have been immediately disappointed with PQ (usually blurry or grainy on a TV). This TV acts as if it were a normal PC monitor, except 55\" in size! Once in Graphics mode, the input lag is not even noticeable to the average gamer. The only thing I must say I was disappointed with was to find that the TV only supports 60Hz refresh rate when you are using a PC. My actual PC monitor supports 120Hz and the difference between the two is noticeable enough to me since I've been using 120Hz for the past 2 years (to the average person plugging up your PC, you won't notice a difference). However, the PQ and low input lag are so impressive to me in Graphics mode that I cannot help but give PC gaming on the TV 5 stars as well. You simply cannot find another high-end LED TV on the market that is as PC friendly as this one.-----UPDATE (10/03/13)-----I've put hundreds of hours into this TV now and can safely say I have ZERO buyer's remorse/regret. The deep black levels, rich color, and minimal input lag have me thinking I must have the best LED TV out in the market right now. I have been playing Grand Theft Auto V on this TV for the past couple of weeks and the experience has been so much more real with the W900A compared to prior TV sets. In Graphics mode, my response time bottoms out at 17ms, which truly makes you feel as if you ARE the character--not just controlling the character. I've had quite a few family members and friends view the TV as well and receive all sorts of compliments. Even though the TV is 5\" smaller than I had hoped, the superior quality is an exceptional trade off that I am more than willing to make.-----UPDATE (11/19/13)-----I have recently purchased the PS4 and spent the weekend testing it out on this TV. As I expected prior to purchasing, the TV and PS4 seem to go hand-in-hand with one another. On top of the excellent input lag in Graphics mode, the TV recognizes the PS4 (labels the input \"Playstation 4\" automatically) and Bravia Sync Control for HDMI allows me to use my TV remote to power on/off the PS4 as well as navigate the PS4's menu. Of course, all of these features were available with the Playstation 3 as well, but it is at least comforting to know the features carry over to the next generation.-----UPDATE (03/21/14)-----I know I'm slightly late to the party with this update, but thought I would at least point out that Sony released the W850A in September 2013, which is a 65 inch TV that has an extremely similar panel to the W900A. So...for those that think 55 inches may be too small for their living room setup, please check out this alternative. It has also received great reviews and feedback from consumers and critics, similar to the W900A. There are three main differences between the two TV's:(1) The W850A has a 120Hz refresh rate and artificial Motionflow of 480 vs. the W900A's 240Hz refresh rate and Motionflow of 960. Since I do not own the W850A, I cannot run input lag tests on it, but have researched its input lag as consistently scoring 18ms, which ranks it the 2nd best 2013 LED TV for input lag behind the Sony W802A (which has the lowest input lag of any TV set in 2013 at a whopping average of 17ms). The W900A (where I am averaging around 18ms) ranks 3rd in input lag on most websites. As for the artificial Motionflow, most videophiles tend to keep theirs off anyways, so it may be of little importance.(2) The panel. The W900A touts a \"Deep Black Panel\" whereas the W850A does not have this feature. The \"Deep Black Panel\" does not directly affect picture quality, but rather *indirectly*. It is how the TV handles ambient lighting within a living room. Simply put, the W900A will perform better in a bright room with a lot of light because it won't be as reflective as the W850A will be. This will make the W900A appear to have higher contrast and deeper colors in a bright room, but if you were to compare the W900A and the W850A side-by-side in pitch black, the picture quality will be almost impossible to differentiate.(3) The W850A has a Bass Reflex Speaker Cabinet vs. the W900A's Long Duct Speaker Cabinet. Look, folks...the X850A (one of Sony's 4K TV's from 2013's lineup) has a Bass Reflex Speaker Cabinet as well, so it's hard to say which one is better. I haven't listened to the W900A and the W850A side-by-side, but let's be honest...mostly everyone owns at least a 2.1 channel system by now that has crisp highs and thumping bass from a subwoofer, so I do not see this as a pro or a con either way. However, if a TV's speaker sound is important to you, it may be worth listening to both in a Magnolia Room at Best Buy.So...with all of this being said, I would seriously consider the W850A if you are interested in a larger screen size. It still has excellent picture quality and--I'd be willing to bet--very low input lag.-----CURRENT SETTINGS (UPDATED 04/18/14)-----My calibrations are always different from mainstream \"professional\" calibrations because I do not like extremely warm color temps and usually stay away from \"Cinema\" modes. Overall, I found that the default factory settings are well calibrated with where I wanted my picture to be, but have made a few tweaks here and there over my first few hundred hours of viewing that you will notice below.Scene Select: GeneralBacklight: 5Picture: 100Brightness: 52Color: 52Hue: 0Color Temp: NeutralSharpness: 65Noise Reduction: OffDot Noise Reduction: OffReality Creation: OffVideo Area Detection: OffSmooth Gradation: OffMotionflow: Off OR \"True Cinema\" for less motion blur w/out sacrificing PQCineMotion: AutoBlack Corrector: OffAdv.

Just buy this TV!!", "Author": "Steven D.", "ReviewID": "R2WERBGA7E6ESH", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This TV is absolutely amazing! I did literally months of research to find the best deal I could, and this is it. This TV is the best LED TV you can buy, hands down. It even beats out the overpriced Samsung models that try to compare in quality. The quantum dot display technology does really make the difference. If you want to see the magic for yourself, just go to a bestbuy with a magnolia center and you can see this TV next to all the other higher end televisions. The colors on this TV are way deeper than anything else in the room. I get compliments on my tv all the time because of how great the color is and how deep and inky the blacks are. It really does measure up to the best plasma tv's when it comes to the black levels. The local dimming feature of this TV really helps out with the blacks as well. The 240 refresh rate is also very very nice. I have not had to adjust this at all out of the box. It just works, like it should.For the gamers out there who are looking for the best tv for their games, this is it, and if you are any sort of a actual dedicated gamer you would know that a big concern for you is the input lag. Typical monitors run anywhere between 3/ms and 20/ms lag depending on what kind you have. TV's are way worse averaging between 30/ms-60/ms lag making playing games on them frustrating at best. I don't believe that gaming should be a chore, so one thing I researched was input lag. This TV has an input lag of 17/ms!! I could tell right away the big difference the lack of input lag has. The only way to find less input lag is to either buy the Sony 802A which has about 16m/s lag, or go buy an actual computer monitor. There is no other TV out there with less input lag. Since this model is far superior in every other way to the 802A, I decided to give up that 1m/s difference. I think the TRILUMINOS display will be the best way to get the most out of your brand new Playstation 4 and it's awesome graphics! You are going to need a serious TV to handle the next-gen consoles.The picture quality is crisp and clean, EVEN when you attach a computer. As with most other televisions, as soon as you hook up a computer to display on your tv, the resolution gets shotty at best and you are left with a crummy picture, especially when trying to read text. The Sony 900A looks amazing. I am actually writing this review with the 900A as my monitor, sitting 8 ft. away, and I can read this just fine with zero zoom applied.Speakers are okay. If you are going to use this TV right, then you already know that an separate surround sound set up is your best bet. I actually use the built in speakers myself, but I can see the potential with a separate system.The design of the TV is spectacular as well. There is a very thin edge and a nice aqua blue bezel accent on the very edge that is subtle and gives the tv a bit of a luxurious feel. Who else can say their TV is blue, and looks good at the same time...only if they have a Sony. Sony offers a few other models with this same feature as well. The stand is shiny chrome which I find very nice and not distracting at all. The stand also allows for left and right swivel.There are 4 HDMI and 3 USB hookups on the back in various spots. It comes with 2 remotes, both of which can do the same things, but the smaller remote is great because it has only the most important buttons. Makes for a slick design that is easy to use. The functions of the full remote can be found after a few clicks on the smaller remote. The tv hooked up very easy to my internet too.This tv comes with 4 Active 3D glasses. Let me stress this...ACTIVE 3D!! I have done research into the passive and active 3D realm for a while now and I just can't understand why anyone would buy a TV with passive 3D technology. This Sony 900A has active 3D, Thank you Sony for doing this right. Active 3D allows for full 1080p resolution during 3D viewing. Passive uses half of that because it needs to split the picture to create the 3D effect. Actually it uses all 1080p but you get half the resolution in each eye. Why buy a kick ass TV for half the quality of resolution. Then, some people go on to say that the active 3D glasses are heavy and they hurt to wear, boo hoo...and some even say they are loud and they can hear the shutter noise during quite parts of the movie... BULL$#!%...Technology has figured out how to make the active 3d glasses weigh practically the same as the passive glasses, and I muted my TV to see if I could hear the shutter noise. There was none. These glasses are comfortable and silent. The only way to do 3D right is by going active instead of passive. Don't let the TV salesman at the store, or the company advertisements tell you otherwise.As a side note, the 3D on this tv is great! You can even adjust how dramatic it is and the tv can even turn non 3d content into 3d content automatically. This is a very cool feature if you are into the whole 3D thing. Also, This TV lets you play Full Screen 2 player using the 3D Active technology. Just put on the glasses and adjust the setting appropriately and this tv will allow both players to look at the same full screen, but only see their own display. Quite the feat and It looks good too. My brother and I were shocked when we were playing against each other.The 900A comes with a wide variety of apps, with the most popular included, Neflix, Hulu, Prime, Ect...For those that are glued to their phones all day, you will be pleased to hear that it is very easy to connect your smartphone to the 900A. For example, you can load up a video on youtube, and play it on your tv from your phone. You can view your pictures that you have saved on your phone as well. They get displayed in all their glory on 55 inches of real estate. Sony also has a remote control app that you can download on to your phone and it will hook up your smartphone to control your TV with all the functions of the regular Sony remotes. It's pretty sweet actually and the app itself is smooth and looks great.There is still more to say about the 900A, but the bulk of the important stuff is above. I really did do a lot of work comparing TV's and I am so glad I went with this one. This TV just works, like it should as advertised, it is truly amazing in every aspect. It is the Rolls Royce of LED Televisions and I know there is not a better one out there, I checked.", "Date": "November 10, 2013"}, {"Title": "TRILUMINOS display really does make a difference.", "Author": "P. Olshevskiy \"Xen Erva Novus\"", "ReviewID": "R1T695ISWXZKVU", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Wow, is a reaction I got once I calibrated this TV, the colors even if viewed from a standard color gamut pop very nicely. If you really want to see how vibrant the colors are just try watching fireworks in full HD and I guarantee your jaw will drop to the floor.I used to own XBR HX950 that was somewhat defective so I had to return it and instead of getting a replacement I got this TV and between XBR HX950 and W90 the difference in how vibrant the colors are is massive. Besides the colors this TV produces, it has the same deep blacks if not close as HX950 which is quite surprising to see sense HX950s main focus was to have really deep blacks more of so in really high contrast ratio scenes. Another thing I noticed is that while HX950 has glare problems because of it's backlight technology this TV doesn't but rather it has flashlighting sense it's edge lit which isn't as big of a problem as glare is, at least to me it isn't. Other than that the Sony's TVs are known for their X Really PRO software engine which makes twicking this TV to your desires a snap. I'd say this TV is the best 1080p TV I have seen to date compared to any brand.Update 07/27/13:I noticed a lot of people have problems with calibrating this TV to get optimum color. The thing with color is that it's mostly determined by the source. A lot of edited film is made saturated on purposes to compensate for not that great saturated TVs. The best way to adjust this TVs color is not the color setting in the picture setup but the live color in advance settings, though to get the most accurate color you'd have to have your source to support Deep color/x.v. Color and sYCC, for now there are not a lot of devices that support Deep Color but I reckon in the future it'll become more prominent. PS3 and I am sure PS4 support Deep Color.", "Date": "June 9, 2013"}, {"Title": "Remarkable TV", "Author": "Henry S. Bailey", "ReviewID": "R1R2SU7D9YZQUY", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I purchased this set as an upgrade for the KDL-52W4100.  I was completely pleased with the 55W4100 but wanted to make a move for a smart set with the 240Hz, 3D, and internet features, primarily the applications that come with a smart set and the built in Wi-Fi.At the current price point, I would be looking at the KDL-55W900A, the Panasonic VT60 series and the Samsung F8000 series.  While I think that the original pricing of $3,299.00 for the KDL-55W900A should have provided a screen size of 60 to 65 inches for the price, once it was lowered to the 2K range, I could live with the 55 inch screen size.  The picture accuracy was more important to me than the extra inches of screen size.I loved the Panasonic Plasma's contrast, color, and the organic feel to the picture, but the plasma set was just not bright enough for me.  The Samsung F8000 sets looked very good in the brick and mortar stores, but seemed to have more applications, whistles and bells than I would need.  The quality of my prior Sony set kept bringing me back to Sony.  The KDL-55W900A was rated in the top of sets by Sound and Vision magazine and by Home Theater magazine.  CNET has a review saying it was the finest LCD/LED set available and Consumer Reports rated it very highly, dinging it only for the original price of $3,299.00.I'm not going to compare Plasmas to LCD sets or get into technical arguments.  Videophiles can be very vocal when it comes to specs.  So, I am just going to review my experience with the KDL-55W900A.The set comes with two remotes, one small remote with basic functions and the main remote that is backlight.  It also comes with four pairs of glasses for use with the 3D as well as the batteries.  The glasses are fairly light for active 3D glasses and the battery life is satisfactory.  They are not rechargeable.  The nose rest on each set of glasses is removable for those who wear prescription lenses.  I wear glasses and did not have any trouble wearing them over my lenses.The out of the box settings for this set are quite good.  The Cinema setting works fine for Blu-Ray discs and movies broadcast in HD.  The sports and game settings also work quite well.  For each of the Scene settings Sony has also a specific sound setting.  For the most part, I think they work very well together.  But, everyone is going to have differences with picture preferences and sound preferences.  In particular room lighting is going to play a big role.  When I first turned the set on I saw more reflectivity than I would have liked to have seen.  Then again, the room the set is in is right next to a sliding glass patio door.  This makes for some of the harshest viewing conditions for today's HD TV sets.  I found that turning off the ECO Sensor dramatically improved any reflectivity issues the took place during the day.  At night with the shades closed and controlled lighting the set can become quite bright.  I do wish that Sony had placed an ECO Sensor button on the remote to allow use of this function rather than having to go into the menu to use it.  At night I might have a use for the ECO Sensor, but with the settings I currently am using I find that the picture maintains it's degree of brightness throughout a viewing day.Some notes on the set:Reflectivity:  The set does have a glossy screen but seems to have no reflectivity issues, other than my unfortunate glass patio door, than any other set would have and I believe the reflectivity issues are better than those found on Plasma sets.Appearance:  The set has a small footprint.  The bezel is not obtrusive and just barely there so you are getting most of the 54.6 inches of viewing area unimpeded.  Actually, the set is a beautiful design.  The majority of complaints I have heard involve the plastic chrome stand.  I have had no problems with seeing reflections from the set in the stand and really do not notice it at all, but a matte black might have been a better color choice.  The stand is plastic and light but sturdy.Menu System:  The user start up guide comes with the set as a paper copy, but the remote has a button for the manual that is displayed on the TV.  There is no more digging through drawers to find the user menu.  The complete manual is on the TV set.  The menu for all the functions is neatly laid out.  I think anyone spending time with it will find using it an easy experience and intuitive.  You can easily change the settings and reset them to the factory settings at anytime.Sound:  No, this is not going to be high fidelity, but it is an improvement over earlier sets.  The sound settings seem well thought out and work for me.  There is plenty of sound to enjoy normal programming, sports, games, and movies.  Of course, to get a large dynamic sound field you will have to buy a soundbar or connect the set to a home theater system.  For the size of my room I find the sound more than acceptable.Applications:  The set comes stocked with plenty of applications.  I have not compared the Sony with other sets, but Amazon Prime, Netflix, and most any other application is there that I could want or would use.Wi-Fi:  The Wi-Fi setup, wireless for me, was about as easy as you can get.  I do not have to use my Blu-Ray player or Sony PS3 for those anymore.  Probably a mute point as I connected a ROKU 3 player to the set, which is 1080 friendly.3D:  If you are used to seeing 3D in theaters wearing passive glasses, this set will knock you out.  Granted there is minimal 3D viewing material out there and wearing glasses for a prolonged period gets old but the 3D on this set is absolutely outstanding.  The set will also simulate 3D from 2D programming and has a number of adjustments for 3D if this is a priority for you.Games:  The lag time on this set has been measured as the lowest available.  This is the Gamer's perfect TV set.HD/Blu-Ray:  Blu-Ray discs come alive on this set.  I am currently using a Sony BDP-S5100 3D/Blu Ray player and it uses the Sony Triluminos scheme when it is available on the disc.  Broadcast HD is spectacular, particularly on the newer films.  The Blacks are ink black, the detail exceptional, colors are vibrant.My Settings:  While some will use the factory settings, others will tinker with there own preferences and lighting conditions.  Here are some settings to get you started.  I used the same format that was used in John's review from 8/13/2013.  You can alter the setting for any of the Scene Selects, but I decided to alter and use Scene Select General and left the others alone.  I found that for me, at least, my settings give me the best of general broadcast TV whether HD or SD, Sports, and most movies.  I use these settings for most TV, with an occasional exception for using Cinema for Blu-Ray.  My settings were based on John's settings from his 8/13/2013 review and from watching a wide variety of programming, sports, movies, broadcast TV, HD channels, nature programs, and general viewing.Scene Select: GeneralPicture Mode: StandardBacklight: 5Picture: 100Brightness: 50Color: 53Hue: 0Color Temp: Warm 1Sharpness: 65Note:  Many prefer to leave all the noise reduction off.

I was not able to find anything that was a problem with it.  It arrived with no dead pixels or flashlighting.  The display is uniform throughout.  Off Axis viewing is good but pretty much in the same league as other sets and better than many.  Blacks are inky black, not plasma quality, but you would really have to be looking for that and it would only occur with certain material.  Colors are superb.  I found the detail to be excellent.  There is no banding.  I simply cannot fault the TV on anything it is advertised to be.  My only con is that I would have easily paid the original price for a 60 or 65 inch set and I am sorry they do not produce those.  Other than that, I believe the only sets that could possibly be better than this set are the 4K sets, yet to be proven or the OLED sets, which cost far too much at this point.

I did so much research on TVs before I purchased this one. The picture quality is amazing and nothing beats it but 4k TVs. I went to BestBuy and they had this side by side with the Samsung F8000 60\" and F7100 (also 60\"). Both TVs looked great, but the colors on the Sony W900 are SO much better and WAY sharper. The F8000 and F7000 models were so bright that the colors looked faded and washed out. You could even notice the pixels on the F7100. I had two other people with me and both said the Sony had a picture that was far superior. The F8000 was listed at $2400 and the the Sony W900a was $1700 (huge price drop since last March when it was $3300). It was a no brainer which one to choose.I watched the BluRay of the Watchmen when I got it. The first fight seen looked awesome! Even better than I remember from the movie theater! The blacks are dark, the colors are vibrant, the picture is crisp, and the motion is so clear. No color saturation issues whatsoever (unlike Samsung). My wife especially likes watching the Walking Dead on this TV; she says it looks like Daryl is right in the room with her.If you're into gaming, especially FPSs, you cant beat the lag input. It's the 2nd lowest lag input TV on the market- only beaten by another Sony model. Playing Titanfall on my Xbox One is freaking awesome. You can see every bullet and you never wonder how you died.

Should I or shouldn't I? That was my absolute position a couple of weeks ago.--Well, I thought of Sony and the reviews people took time to provide here and that nothing in this cosmos is foolproof/permanent/faultless and you have to take some risk somewhere else if not this anyways; decided to put some trust in all of that and clicked 'Place Order'. It seems it was definitely worth it now.Shipping & Packaging & Delivery:----------------------------------Shipping was on time (\"to the day\" in my case since there was snow).--I have to mention and thank the guys delivering this (2 people from a company called Ceva) who made a lot of effort on a snowy day to bring the TV to me. My delivery window was for 4 hours (10am to 2pm) so they called at about 1pm and informed that they were running late due to traffic conditions and small delays adding up from their earlier deliveries; they made it at about 4pm but am very glad they showed some professionalism and that they cared enough to let me know. They carried it to my living room and opened it, screwed on the stand and also switched the TV on to ensure things were looking ok; even offered to throw away the packaging but I kept it anyways.--Packaging was perfect but the actual box by Sony that the TV comes in is a little weird I must say; it opens from the bottom and does not have flaps. Will be slightly inconvenient to pack while moving I guess.--Pretty big and will need two (normal-sized) people to handle it.Picture & Color:---------------------The quality of the picture is brilliant and the colors are very rich. I am not an expert on video but I am definitely not color blind and can say that any color looks like it should and black looks black.--I have not tested blu-ray on this yet but HD videos run beautifully so am sure it will be a treat.--Once or twice, I have seen that it takes about 3-5 seconds to turn on completely; not sure if this needs that warm-up but it does come up after that. Not a major issue to me personally.3D:---------------------The 3D...oh the 3D! It definitely feels like things are popping out and you don't really have to try for that. I can already see my money going away on 3D movies. One thing though, if the glasses are not engaged in watching 3D content for 15 mins or so(i guess), they seem to go into sort of a standby (probable battery saving mode) and if you then turn on a video, you see the blurry 3D video. Because of this, I initially thought that the 3D on this TV sucked and then realized that I was spending too much time in browsing through videos and the glasses were not active by the time I actually started one; have to press that small button in the middle on the nose ridge to re-register the glasses with the TV( happens very quickly in 2-3 secs) and we are back to the amazing world.--The glasses have not turned off during a video (max 5-10 min long ones that I have seen till now) and I feel that if you are watching a full-length 3D movie, the glasses are constantly in use and will/should not turn off unless we pause or stop for a while.--There are a decent number of short 3D clips offered by Sony by default, which you can enjoy at the beginning to check out the 3D; not necessary to be ready with a 3D player and a 3D movie for the experience.--Two remotes, 4 pairs of active 3D glasses which work beautifully.Content:---------------------There is a plethora of apps for videos on the TV - Hulu, Netflix and a ton of others but there is a separate section for them and don't get in your way if you don't need them.Exterior:---------------------It has an elegant design with that blue thin strip on the bezel giving that extra little touch.--The Sony logo on the TV positioned above the stand has a smooth fading LED effect which is nice and never have I felt any interference in view due to that.--The TV looks classy.WiFi:---------------------I have used Amazon Prime Video (a built-in app) extensively on the TV and it works great and fast for HD videos with its inbuilt WiFi; never felt any lag/loading delays whatsoever.Issues, if any yet:---------------------None! This is my 2nd week with the TV so time will tell how it fares along the way but I am enjoying it so far and hence, deservedly 5 stars :).========================================================================================Hope this helps in giving a little nudge to someone who is stuck on the Dilemma Phase :P========================================================================================", "Date": "December 16, 2013"}, {"Title": "KLD-55W900A - The best LED TV available", "Author": "Reinhard Metz", "ReviewID": "R34DV4P5UE2HDJ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This is almost certainly the best LED tv out there. My purpose in writing this is to pass along my ideas about how to get the best performance out of the set, because, despite it's ultimate capabilities, it's a bit difficult to tune up, and it is not perfect out of the box. The main reason is that Sony, under pressure for green ratings, configures the picture to optimize power usage, not picture quality. In the end, though, an optimized picture does not really consume any significantly greater amount of power. To qualify my input here, let me declare that I could care less about 3D and don't use it, I don't game on the set, and I am primarily an absolute picture quality perfectionists.1) Picture/color tuning: there are several suggested tunings to be found in various reviews, and there is the widely publicized CNET tuning, which purportedly uses standards and tests that should provide the ultimate in performance. I found none of these acceptable. Especially, the CNET settings, supposedly derived to deliver measured and calibrated superior performance, in actual picture use, were quite disappointing. There are two key insights necessary to do the job right.First, there are two places you must go to set the picture up - first is in the home/preferences/scene select menu: what you pick here will constrain what you can then pick in the more detailed picture/color adjustment menus. Now, what is important here is that what you might think most desirable from the name, mainly \"custom\", or possibly \"standard\",will lock you out of the necessary possibilities for an optimal picture. Both constrain the amount of brightness available for the best picture, because brightness consumes more power. Both the custom and standard scene select modes are constrained to meet EnergyStar requirements, resulting in weaker and bland pictures.  What you need to pick is \"Cinema\" to enable the range in other adjustments that you need for best performance. One interesting thing you can do is go to a chain store that has a KDL55W900A on display that is being maintained by SONY and check its settings \u2013 you will likely find they have set it to Cinema scene select!Second, go to the detailed settings under home/picture and display/picture adjustments/picture menu, and set the more detailed choices.Here are the color picture settings that I found produced the best picture:Scene Select (in home/preferences menu): Cinema (in separate menu)Other settings, in home/picture and display/picture adjustments/picture menu:Picture mode: Cinema 1Backlight: 9Picture: 94Brightness: 50Color: 59Hue: G1 (this may vary by set and program source \u2013 choose for bets skin tone)Color Temp: NeutralSharpness: 74Noise Reduction: OffDot Noise Reduction: OffReality Creation: OffVideo Area Detection: OffSmooth Gradation: OffMotionflow: OffCineMotion: AutoIn home/picture and display/picture adjustments/picture menu/advanced settings:Black Corrector: OffAdv.

For my wife and I, it was a real issue. Here is the solution I have found to be astonishingly successful: buy a sheet of anti-glare film made specifically to fix this. I bought mine from [...]. An absolutely superb product, but not cheap - about $80 for this TV. The material needs to be applied with care to keep out dust and bubbles. Two suggestions: put it on the set vertically to minimize dust appearing from gravity during the application process, and also, don't fret small non-dirt bubbles as they will leak out through the plastic over a day or so.

Specs always look different than real life and that\u2019s very true when comparing todays newer TV\u2019s.Vizeo at the low end but price point driven finally drew my look-see.  Mainly because when I read the reviews they sound so glowing and the specs are hard to beat as well.  However, seeing them in comparison both in-store on their store display modes or tuned by me while in the store, the picture for even their best units leave a lot to be desired in terms of accuracy and detail.Samsung was another line I looked at.  Overall, very punchy and over-processed.  They catch your eye and area a well-known brand, but again, side by side, one will notice they are not remotely as accurate as this Sony.So what do I like about it?Did I say accuracy?  WOW!  Watching this TV is like looking out a very clean window on a bright day.  Outside the new 4K screens on display with their demo modes running, there wasn\u2019t a TV in Best Buy or other retailers that looked anywhere near as good as this Sony.  Triluminous display isn\u2019t just a marketing term.  That technology really does show in this TV.  Being spoiled with Plasma, I had a concern with motion issues but trusted that 240Hz would be good.  It\u2019s more than good actually; Sony nailed it with the capabilities of this TV.  From Sports to gaming, the response time and display are flawless.  All LED\u2019s have some type of \u201cmotion control\u201d to enhance smooth flowing images as does this one.  However I turn Motion Control OFF.  Even on the lowest setting, Cinema Mode, it does cause a very slight shudder to be visible on 1080i cable shows where movement is sudden/quick.  It\u2019s just plain not needed IMO.  There are zero issues with sharpness or clarity with it off.  Crank it all the way up and you\u2019ll quickly see what \u201csoap opera effect\u201d is.  I\u2019ll leave it at that.Viewing angle and brightness are not an issue with this TV.  Ours is positioned in a corner and viewed from a slight angle in most all cases.  However, even at about 30-40* or more as I sit off to the side, it\u2019s very clear, sharp and no real change is visible.  I do unlike many, run it in auto brightness mode.  If you don\u2019t and you\u2019re watching TV at night with lights dimmed, it will be way to bright.  Brightness isn\u2019t something you need to be concerned with here.  Our great room is a wall of windows but even the sun coming in doesn\u2019t wash out this beast.  I have noticed zero issues with lighting or hot spots.  The panel is perfect in every way from evenness of lighting to no screen light bleed whatsoever.  Well done Sony.Appearance wise, the unit is beautifully crafted.  I love the beveled edge around the very thin bezel/screen.  Caught in the right lighting it has a beautiful blue-green shimmer that adds a tasteful appearance to an otherwise typical family room appliance.  The only change I have made to the unit is the best/stand.  I can appreciate the Chrome look, but find it a bit distracting.  I simply scuffed it up and applied a stain finish charcoal gray lacquer to it to help it blend in with the glass top on my stand and help it match the rest of the accessories around it.In conclusion, be ready to become addicted to watching just about anything.  For me, high def late night TV like the new Tonight Show comes alive as does the nightly news.  I say that because I\u2019m a fan of dark blues and reds of which this TV kills the competition at displaying and which tend to dominate such shows.  Test it out with Dark movies like 300 or any of the Hobbit Movies and you\u2019ll gain a whole new and never expected way of an LED handling such dimly lit scenes.

After a while I realized something epic:  the over-brightness of the Samsung made things look LESS realistic especially for indoor footage (consisting, in my estimation, about 85% of all video footage. Objects(on the screen)begin to lose solidity when they gain too much brightness. The images on the Sony were often stunning (on Dish content)but it really depended on the quality of the signal. Unfortunately the broadcast quality of some channels is still not up to standard. Objects on the Sony were far more realistic, let alone  the impact of Sony's superiority of black levels.

Whitestone Jr.", "ReviewID": "R2X9RGY9MKZVQW", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "To put my review in context, I use the TV for viewing over the air (OTA) broadcast, DVDs, and streaming Netflix.  This is my first LCD TV.I am very impressed with this TV.  There are many good things about it, it fills my heart with joy, and I don't regret buying it.  Compared to my last 32 inch CRT TV, the W900A is better.  However, this review dwells more on the flaws I encountered with the W900A.  The negatives are easier to note and might give a prospective buyer better 'make or break' information.Netflix streaming: It's almost unbelievable how much better the Netflix streaming is when going through the W900A than going through my Sony Blu-ray player.  However, a few times I noticed lag between the video and audio when using the Netflix app on the W900A.  The lag was not evident when watching the same source through my Blu-ray Netflix app.  Also, I haven't noticed any lag using the Amazon steaming app on the W900A.  I emailed Sony about this, but never got a response.  I would think they would care about it considering there is a dedicated Netflix button on the TV remote.Calibration: I spent some time with the Spears&Munsil; calibration DVD.  [There does not seem to be much one can do beyond the basic brightness, sharpness, tint, and hue adjustments.]  Comparing the results of my basic calibration to the 'Standard' mode factory settings, I would have to say I like the 'Standard' mode better.  It's a little over saturated and over sharpened, but my custom calibration (using Spears&Munsil;) seems too washed out.  Overall on this TV, the greens are excellent, the reds are a bit over saturated and the Spears&Munsil; calibration DVD showed that the W900A is seriously clipping blues.  And there seems to be no adjustment for that.  To my eye, the blues seem generally OK.  I've gone through a lot of trial and error with the settings to get the reds correct, and it's still not perfect.  There are 3 picture modes; all of the cal settings are independent for each picture mode except RGB gain and bias, for which there is only one setting across all three picture modes.  Finally, I could find no way to set calibration for the streaming input.TV remote: Perhaps the biggest drawback of this TV is the lack of a 'Favorites' button on the remote for scanning through OTA channels.  Yes, they have a 'Fast Zapping' feature, which is slick looking, but it still requires 3 button pushes to get to the next favorite channel.  I just wanna plop down, zone out, and scroll through my favorites with one button push.  Instead, to get from one favorite channel to the next, I've got at least three button pushes, and since it's not all the same button I have to be distracted to look at the remote to make sure I am pushing the right button (or eventually hit the wrong button).To go directly to a specific station, one needs to enter the entire 'xx.x' format channel number.  With my last OTA tuner (which I got free with a subsidy coupon), a number press would bring it to the nearest channel starting with that number that has a signal.  To go to, say, 22.1, I would just press '2' or '22' and a moment later the tuner would go to 22.1.  With the W900A, when I press 22, it goes to 22, which of course is just loud obnoxious static.And this brings me to the design of the remote.  In the middle there are two concentric 'rings' of buttons, which are necessary to use quite often.  I am forever hitting a button in the wrong ring and screwing up what I want to do.  Maybe that's just me, though.Tuner quality is excellent.  However, there is no way to display the channel schedule.  My old freebie tuner could tell me what was coming next on the channel - very useful if I turn on the TV 5 minutes before the hour and don't want to wait to see what is coming on.  The W900A does not have this feature.  Boo.Screen quality: There are 5 small grey smudges (about the size of a drop of water) that appear on bright images.  Four smudges are in the upper left, one larger smudge is on the right-middle side.  I thought there must be some dead sub-pixels, but closer examination with a loupe showed no sub-pixel problems.  Oddly, looking close with the loupe shows nothing that I can discern that would cause the smudges.  Perhaps some of the blue sub-pixels are a bit darker in the smudge areas.  The smudges are visible at distances from about 1 foot to 8 feet from the TV.  At my normal viewing distance the smudges are not visible, and they don't show in darker scenes anyway.I did write to Sony, asking what the dead pixel policy is for the W900A, but got no response.There is vignetting on the left and right sides, mostly noticeable during bright scenes.The W900A is excellent with regard to limiting reflections.  But, the reflections that do exist are surrounded by rainbows.Apps: The web browser is worthless.  Trying to use the remote to navigate a web page is an exercise in frustration.  And nearly every page I visited crashed the browser with an 'out of memory' error.  I'm not sure I got anything other than the Google home page to properly load.Picasa and Pandora work well.  Games are frustrating to play with the TV remote.  I'm not sure how it works, but it seems that some apps are on the TV and some are loaded dynamically.  One evening only a few app showed up and I got a message saying the \"Server is down\".Various: If the TV is unplugged, it loses the time.  DVDs are generally excellent.

The panel is perfect. I do not turn off all of the settings like most owners do. It did take 3+ weeks to tune the picture, I do not calibrate. Trial and error works for me. I use Scene select general, picture setting standard and color temp neutral, then fooled around with the other pic adjustments used white balance to fine tune color and it`s just stunning. I would not wait long if your are deciding on this set seems to be harder to find. Delivery was great but the Amazon purchase was not up to past standards. Never had a purchase this difficult. Most long time Amazon customers may be noticing some policy changes as well. Paying with two forms of payment at Amazon should never be a problem, period. After several calls and 3 hrs I had my Sony. Beware of some vendors on Amazon that do not accept returns on large screens and is stated in their return policies. Always read the fine print and ask questions. To be safe buy sold and shipped by Amazon it may be a few dollars more but I feel it is worth it. If you need a warranty and are a Costco member $99 5 years Square Trade and does not matter where you bought your set...", "Date": "March 25, 2014"}, {"Title": "Outstanding picture quality, best 1080p TV money can buy", "Author": "J. Kitchen \"BigJerm\"", "ReviewID": "R3PDDWDOIQC6KR", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I took a long time reviewing lots of TVs and reading reviews before I bought this TV. I know I wanted an LED and I narrowed it down to this Sony and the 8000 series Samsung. The decision to go with the Sony really boiled down to picture quality and I don\u2019t think it can get better in a 1080p than this Sony. I don't recall seeing another TV in the last couple years that had so many positive/5 star reviews, except may the latest Panasonic plasma. I bought this TV to be my primary, family room TV for 5+ years. I considered going with a 4K unit, but lack of content and my slow internet access made that decision for me. I also thought that if 4K TVs come down in price in 2 or 3 years I can move this TV into my bedroom or office (this is the only way my wife is OK-ing a $2000 TV in my office).Pros:Outstanding picture quality right out of the box. I tried some of the adjustments people listed online including John, the top reviewer on this thread. I like the stock settings better. I adjusted the brightness and backlight a little to my taste, and that\u2019s it. I tend to like a vivid picture over the cinema \u201csoft\u201d look. I would like to reduce the soap opera effect by about 20%, but other than that I think it\u2019s perfect.Smart functions are great for me. I don\u2019t consider myself a power user of this by any means. I have read that the Samsung\u2019s smart features are better, but access to a few online services is all I really care about. You get smart features with every device now; a Blu-ray player, Apple TV and Roku boxes only costing $100, if something better comes along I\u2019ll just add it. There are so many options out there, I don\u2019t feel like I\u2019m stuck with the smart features of the TV, I can change those easily and on the cheap, I can\u2019t change the picture quality. I use Netflix, YouTube and Amazon TV, they all work great and are quick to access. I have the TV hard wired and the connection seems very fast and reliable. I have a tablet and a smart phone so I will probably not use the TV for internet surfing much. I do use my phone (HTC One) in conjunction with YouTube on the TV. I can search using the keyboard on my phone, then watch the videos on the TV by clicking a button, cool feature.3D. If I could have gotten a TV with better picture quality without 3D I would have bought it. But they all come with it now. I think my kids will use this feature a lot more than me. We have only watched Gravity in 3D Blu-Ray so far and I have to say it was impressive. I would say the 3D was not quite as \u201cpop out of the screen\u201d as you get in a theater, but the picture quality in 3D was much better than anything I\u2019ve seen in a theater. The set came with 4 pair of active 3D glasses.The TV is very nice looking. I like the brushed metal bezel that is not too thin. The blue/cut glass looking edge is a nice touch. The only thing I would change would be the silver Sony badge on the bottom. It can catch some glare from lights in the background and shine a little.  I had an older 46 inch Samsung before this TV. It had big wide bezels on it and it was a thicker TV. This new TV is very \u201ccool looking\u201d above my fireplace.Cons:The screen is very shiny and reflective. The TV is in my family off the kitchen and dining room. The lights in the kitchen above the bar are always on. At certain angles you can see the lights like a black mirror. At other angles you can see a prism or rainbow effect from the lights. This is usually only an issue when the screen is black or a very dark scene. When we watch a movie at night, we turn those lights off and the screen is just perfect.I can\u2019t comment on the built in sound of this TV and I\u2019m surprised it would be an issue to anyone. If you have a TV of this caliber and you don\u2019t have better than stock sound to match, you\u2019re missing half of the experience.I highly recommend this TV to anyone in the market for a new one. In my opinion, this is the pinnacle of 1080p TVs, I don\u2019t think a clearer image in 1080p is possible. Sony has always had the best picture quality of any TV brand, back in the tube days and now in flat panels. If you have not bought a new TV in a while, you will be blown away by this one.", "Date": "March 17, 2014"}, {"Title": "Beautiful", "Author": "Travis", "ReviewID": "RART441FZE0DM", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This tv has an amazing picture with amazing colors.

I wanted to wait to review it until the \"excitement\" of a new purchase wore off and also to make sure there were no \"bugs\" that I didn't notice right away.This TV is amazing. The color is fantastic. Triluminous works on any signal - there is no special content needed - it works on TV, Blu Ray, everything. I don't personally do any gaming so I can't speak to that but professional reviewers say it's excellent for gaming. For regular TV it's very impressive - especially on certain channels that your cable / FIOS provider doesn't compress. Sometimes it really looks like you are on the set - it's incredible. For Blu Ray it's equally impressive - I've watched all kinds of content on my Oppo and it looks so good.I am not detracting from the review for this but there is one thing I wish Sony had done differently - and that is to make the Eco setting accessible with just two clicks - I like to turn Eco off during the day and then turn it on at night when it's dark in the house. When Eco is off it blasts your eyeballs - which is fine in a bright house. My old Sony had a similar feature that was very easy to get to. It's tolerable but not as easy as it should be.The price is a little high but I have no regrets.

I actually bought a Sony LCD TV shortly after they came out and was very disappointed in the quality of the picture only to replace it with a Samsung shortly thereafter. Well that was then and this is now. Sony has done it again with their Triluminos technology and the picture quality is near equal to the best plasma display you can buy. The blacks are beautiful and the colors pop out at you. I had intended to buy a plasma for my next display until Panasonic announced their decision to stop making them. After all, Panasonic is the best plasma you can buy (or was). This TV is nearly equal in quality without the heat that plasmas generate and not near as heavy.

I would say that the TV is strictly designed for its picture quality, so if you are looking for a TV with smart features, you might want to stay away from this.

Voice recognition, gestures and all the things as well that I'll probably end up NEVER using.) In my case, I did not need any smart features anyway since my PS4 helps. (plus, PS4 recognizes the TV.)

The deeper colors are the first thing you notice.  It's more than just increasing color saturation in the data.* 240Hz refresh panel, Motionflow 960 and the advanced processor eliminates just about all artifacts and produces a very sharp picture.  I thought the 240Hz refresh would be important for 3D operation.* Very convincing 3D (active) and the watch battery-powered active shutter glasses are fairly light.* Much improved menu display vs. the old X-bar layout.* Fast enough electronics to be responsive to my home network.* Good selection of internet applications.* Plays most video formats* Wireless host allows it to work with Netflix and YouTube apps through Chromecast even without the Chromecast device installed.  (The TV also has native Netflix and YouTube through its own menu.)* Price was reduced.* There are other useful features such a Wi-Di and screen mirroring, but I haven't tried them.* I've owned many Sony TVs and they never seem to die.Minuses:* Has problems displaying some jpeg files.  This is an issue for me since I use this display to view my collection of 30k jpeg images.  This is a known issue, ascribed to a specific choice of chroma subsampling.  I have my doubts about this explanation as I cannot get the files to play when I resave them with other choices of chroma subsampling.  I seem to have most trouble with 8bit b-w jpegs and all of my jpegs were created with no chroma subsampling.  Some play and some don't.  It's a mystery.  In any case, my Sony TVs are the only electronics I have ever owned that do not display these files.* Sometimes finicky accessing network resources, such as NAS and slower than expected accessing Windows Media Player on my PC (a fairly fast Windows 7 PC).Summary:  Buy this TV for the beautiful display.  The W900A seems to be the culmination of Sony's HD TV (1080p) development due to the combination of 240Hz refresh and triluminos color.  To my knowledge, Sony does not now sell a larger 240Hz panel.  Consider the Samsung models If your primary interest is network friendliness and internet apps.  Get the best of both worlds by combining the Sony W900A with the ~$70 Western Digital WD TV Live Media Player Wi-fi 1080p for a great picture and excellent network and internet access.  The WD player solves the jpeg problem, plays a wide range of formats and helps organize your media.  It also works well with our Windows 7 PCs and my Western Digital My Book\u00ae Live(tm) Duo NAS.

For a 1080P picture, you cannot find a better picture. There is no bleeding in the corner of the screens like the Samsung high end TVs. Picture is in incredible. Sound quality is exceptional (this has always been Samsung's weakest point).Unknown Features:Screen mirroring -- I have a Samsung galaxy S4 smartphone and I am able to send the entire video and audio feed from my phone to the tv seamlessly. Reasons to do it: the picture looks amazing on a 55\" screen and you can watch Netflix, surf the internet from your phone, read email, share pictures and videos, etc on your TV. If you are an audiophile, you can wireless send your tunes (mp3s, Pandora, audio-books, etc) to your TV. My TV is setup to a home theater system and I am not able to listen to Pandora, etc in perfect surround sound (I was going to buy a new $1000 receiver so I could replace my old onkyo to have this ability).USB connectivity - I can play absolutely everything  (video, audio, pictures). Mp4, mkvs, you name it and sony plays it without a problem. Flawless instant playback (no buffering) and I never receiver an error. Samsung  has some trouble on their smart tvs playing all the formats and so does roku.Network connection - the sony connects to the internet to plays apps, etc (everyone knows this). What I found was interesting is that I can connect to the network and play files that you saved on your computer or are on your server. If you have a lot of movies, videos, etc (such as family videos saved to your hard drive), you can easily play them through your sony tv.3D Picture for a 2D television feed. - Granted, I did not expect much out of this feature as I do not have anything in 3D and I do not really enjoy watching full length movies in 3D and wearing 3D glasses. With that said, I was very impressed on how it converts 2D live television feeds into a 3D picture. It added depth to popular shows such as big bang theory and I was thoroughly impressed how nice the picture looked for a 2d feed. While I'll stick to 2D (its better for your eyes) I watched a few hours of 3D television simply out of curiosity and was thoroughly impressed with this television.Connections - USB/HDMI connections are exceptional. Unfortunately, you only have one component and one AV input. Unfortunately, I have to chose between what I connect now into the AV input section or I have to feed the video feed through a receiver, etc. If you have a VCR, old game consoles (original xbox 360 is component only, wii, etc) you will run into trouble. With that said, it has better connections than any other high end tv. Just be prepared to buy an adapter or use a pass through receiver as a work around.I only had this TV for a month and I have not been able to fully utilize more than 1/10th of its features.

Several days later, but still well within the price match window of 14 days, one of the qualifying merchants had the TV at an even lower price.  That is when I had a surprise. I called and asked for a price match with the new information. The request was denied.  The reason given was that Amazon will only honor one price match per item.

If you asked me a few years ago I would say Samsung. Now I encourage anyone that plays games and has wanted to do so on a big screen tv without feeling like your seconds behind other players to do some independent research. See if you don't end up back to this model. We all did I am sure. Tried to find a reason why we shouldn't spend this much on a tv or if cost wasn't an issue trying to simply find a better one. You will end up back on this tv model because there really isn't a comparable tv on the market. A few years ago I converted to playing my FPS and other fast paced games on a computer monitor because the input lag on the majority of HGTVs are terrible. I remembered playing games sitting comfortably on a couch back when playing a multiplayer game was with people in the same room. This tv has brought that feeling back when I could prop up my feet and play anything to a competitive level. The visuals are stunning. I expected Game Mode take away from that. Not the case. I played 360 on it before I got my Xbox One (Yes I own an Xbox and a Sony tv, I hold no biases). Even that blown up on a 55\" screen it didn't look gritty or more pixelated than my 24\" monitor. It looked in fact better. Next gen is amazing on it. Also note for anyone that isn't familiar this tv supports Sonys version of Dual Play. In 3d mode you can play split screen as if it was full screen. I know the basics are basically combining the images. The 3d glasses allow only one set of data to be seen per player. Essentially the left lens data for one player and the right lens data for the other. Im sure I butchered the technology behind it. Regardless its awesome and another reason to buy this tv as if you needed one. I have yet to test this but I will and I will follow up with my experience.Now gaming isn't the only reason for this tv obviously. Well calibrated cinema preset made the highest end theaters I have been in fail in comparison. Deep dark blacks, amazing color reproduction, bright whites with no yellow or blue tones. Now if you like your screen to pop watching live tv I found going to the sports preset and making a few selections to suit your liking will give the best result. Animation preset is great as it if you have kids or just like to watch animated shows or movies. Only way think I can compare it to is looking at a AMOLED or retina display. Expanding that to 55\" with no visible distortion or loss of clarity. This tv is worth easily 3x what you can get it for.

Screen is amazing - picture quality, color saturation, it is all wonderful and bright2. Plenty of HDMI connections - before we had to use a HDMI splitter box, now it all goes through the tv directly, making it easier to control and providing the best picture/sound3.

Yes, it's pricey compared to the competition, but it's worth every penny in my honest opinion.Pros:1) Easy setup - plug it in and it seeks the WiFi signal; a couple of clicks, enter WEP and you're connected.2) Remote - took a little while to figure things out, but once you do, it is extremely functional, very well thought out by SONY. The \"return\" button is exactly where you want it and it will back you up from one page/screen to the previous one perfectly.3) Streaming - streams movies from Amazon and Netflix without any buffering (pauses) at all, but obviously you must have a strong signal, if you don't, you can't blame the TV.4) Picture - this is the most amazing picture I've ever seen, I'm sure only a 4K could be better. To save time in the beginning I searched for settings that other people used, a few of them worked but most of them didn't. My picture settings are down-right PERFECT, maybe I'll post them for you to try at a later date.5) Speakers - they are probably the best you can get in a TV like this, but I'm using a Denon amplifier and Klipsch speakers (highly recommended for a theatre experience)6) 3D - the 3D rendering is astounding, but watching it has always been a chore for me. The glasses are comfortable and work well but sitting through a 2-hour movie is very hard on ones eyes. I believe this is why 3D never took off like the industry hoped it would. Some 3D movies are simply too intense to look at for a couple of hours and leave me with a splitting headache.7) 2D - this is why you will not miss the 3D, when you get a great movie or TV station, it looks like 3D without the eye-strain. 2D to 3D is an unnecessary feature IMHO because of the quality of the 2D picture.8) SmartTV - the SONY SEN smart hub displays all of the apps and scrolling through them is a breeze. \"Home\" page gives you the current input options as well as \"History\" of recent apps for quick selection and a \"Settings\" menu. There is also a built-in user manual which is ideal if you get stuck with anything. Also, the TV knows when I'm watching TV or streaming anything and will change the \"scene\" setting automatically. The TV remembers all of your picture settings so you don't have to change them when going from the internet to a Blu-Ray player, X-Box, or Cable-TV.9) Web-browser - compared to the competition I think it is excellent with the ability to have bookmarks right at your disposal10) Gaming - I do not play games but if the 3D is any indication, it must be awesome on this TV11) NetFlix/Hulu promotion - finally got it going, one year FREE for each, close to a $200 valueCons (all minor):1) does not work with generic mice and keyboards, so you must use the remote to type2) a little pricey, but I did not like some reviews of the Samsungs where the panel just died after a year or two. SONY's should last a lifetime.3) the NetFlix/Hulu promotion app did not work, but SONY tech-support came through with an activation code after 3 or 4 days4) as someone else pointed out, you cannot delete some of the apps on the SEN screenNo doubt about the 5-Stars, purchase this TV and you won't regret it for a minute.Thanks for your time.", "Date": "January 5, 2014"}, {"Title": "The Must Have TV for Next GEN Gamers", "Author": "deadric", "ReviewID": "R8EC4SJHI1S3H", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I did a TON of research when buying this TV and I must say it is absolutely AMAZING!

The Sony KDL-55W900A 55-Inch 240Hz 1080p 3D Internet LED HDTV is simply the best 55\" Class TV on the market. But the important issue at hand is that if you want this TV (it is spectacular as noted) you have a very limited time to find a unit. It has been discontinued by Sony (as all brands do with TVs even their best rated ones) and only a few vendors still have them in inventory. Amazon is out so and their current supplier Modia appears to only have 5 units remaining. Best Buy, RC Willey's and etc have listed the item as out of stock and discontinued. I went to my trusted supplier B&H; and luckily for me they still had some still in inventory. So I'd assume you may have a month at most to find this model. The ratings for this TV are off the chart everywhere. My purchase came down to either this unit or Sony's XBR-55X900A 55-Inch 4K Ultra HD Motionflow XR 960 3D Internet LED UHDTV. Clearly the 4K has a better picture, but all the reports denoted unless you have the cash to burn, they recommend waiting 18 months for the units to work out kinks and equipment them with more internet, wifi and other goodies.

Vu \"tech geek\"", "ReviewID": "R2JZEB0C51HUDL", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Like a couple other reviewers have stated, the first TV I received had a wonky stand.  When the TV was attached to it, it was not level.  The left side dropped .5cm compared to the right side when it was on a perfectly level surface.  I also had significant light bleed all along the bottom edge of the picture.  This was most noticeable when the picture was darkish (think grays or dark blues) along the bottom edge with a brighter image in the center.  Basically, there would be a section of the darkish area that was significantly brighter along the bottom edge.  It was noticeable enough to be a distraction even if I was staring at the center of the TV.  I wasn't sure if this was to be expected, because I knew that edge-lit LED TVs do not have perfectly uniform lighting, but this did seem excessive.I first attempted to contact Sony about the light bleed problem.  The great thing about Sony support is that it is open 24x7 - pretty impressive.  They asked me to take pictures of the issue, so I did.  After they reviewed the images, they told me that this was within acceptable limits.Being the optimist that I am, I decided that I would just exchange the TV and see if the first example I got was just bad.  To my relief, the second one is just about as perfect as I could ask for.  It is perfectly level on the stand, and the bottom edge light bleed is only noticeable if I really try to look for it.  Big kudos to Amazon for incredible customer support.  Oh, but on that note, when the replacement was delivered, it was delivered by a single person, so I had to help take the old one out and bring the new one in.  I totally didn't mind, but it's not how Amazon advertises their TV delivery (the first one was delivered and setup by 2 people).  To be honest, I liked putting it together and being part of the delivery and install because I am a little OCD, plus it helps to know how to put the stand together.  Furthermore, the one delivery person from CEVA was incredibly professional - very patient, helpful, and careful about not scratching my walls when we were bringing the TVs up and down the stairs.As far as the TV goes, for me, it's all about picture quality (I don't care too much for \"smart\" features).  When I was in the Sony store, I honestly was not too impressed by the W802 or the W900.  I thought they just looked average.  What I didn't realize was that this was unfair because I was comparing these TVs to the other TVs in the Sony store.  At Sears, there was an  W802 side by side with a Samsung F7100, and the W802 was significantly sharper while colors and blacks seemed about the same.  I watched The Dark Knight Rises last night on Blu-ray and it was like I was in the theaters (used the Cinema scene select).I've never had a plasma, so I can't comment on how it compares to a plasma, but for me, the black levels and contrast are just fine.  Colors and sharpness are great.  Compared to my previous TV (which was a 5 year old Philips LCD), there is just a surprising lack of noise in the image, which is awesome.  As other people have stated, off angle viewing leaves much to be desired, but I expected this, so it was not a surprise.  However, sitting on the left, right, or center of my sofa, I cannot notice any difference in image quality.So why this over a plasma?  For me, it was a couple reasons.  1) My house gets really warm during the summer, and I didn't want my TV to generate a lot of heat.  2) My built-in entertainment unit is 50in wide, which allowed me to fit most 55in edge-lit LEDs, but could not fit a 55in plasma; I would have needed to drop down to a 50in plasma as a 60in would not fit. But if you don't have such limitations, based on my research, you should go for a plasma as the picture quality should be better.Conclusion?  If you can get this TV when it's on sale (and it has been on sale), it's a great deal, and one of the best 1080p edge lit LED TVs out there. While I had a little trouble with it, it was worth it.  I am completely happy with my purchase.The question that remains is if the TV will last as long as my Philips did.

It has an extremely small bezel with a smooth matte finish, which looks extremely classy and minimizes the amount of space it takes up. There is a small silver box underneath the TV which displays the Sony logo and a soft light that glows and pulses as you move through the settings.The picture is awesome. I'm pretty picky with this stuff (my other TV is a Panny plasma from last year) and I can see no flaws in the image. Blacks are deep, colors pop, and I see no banding, clouding, or uniformity issues. Everything I've seen looks great, but sports are a special standout. The menu settings are clear and easy to navigate so calibration is a breeze. Setting up the internet was also no problem at all.The TV ships with a number of apps, and I've only tried out Netflix and Youtube. It works fine, though - very fast and smooth. I'm not sure what CPU they are using in there, but it seems like a capable one. The Netflix streaming also works well, resolving to high definition faster than what I have seen on the PlayStation 3 app.I do have one nitpick - I couldn't get ARC to work. ARC is a feature of the new HDMI standard that allows the TV to pass audio back to the receiver through the HDMI Out - this simplifies connections, especially for modern \"smart TVs\" like the one in question. I could not get audio to work no matter what I did. I am not sure if it is because of the TV or the receiver, which is a few years old and on the lower end (Onkyo SR508). Instead, I was able to get sound through Netflix and Youtube instead by hooking up an optical cable to the receiver. I think we are getting 5.1 through that, so it is okay in the end, but ARC would have been a nice, convenient feature.This set is a huge hit in this house. This is well worth looking into if you want a higher-end TV and are willing to spend the premium.

I am not a videophile, which means by the end of the day I probably won't know the difference. However, if I am spending $1500 to $2000 for a nice HDTV, I want the best within my budget. I started out with the newest Vizio lines (m501d) with decent picture quality, but I soon realized they skimped out on the hardware, which is why it is so cheap, that as soon as I lifted the TV to mount on the wall, it easily caused dead pixels on the screen.  I can definitely say that the look and feel of this Sony model is secure, durable, and feels like a solid sheet of glass. I compared the 8000 series Samsung to this Sony model side by side and agree with majority of the public that this wins in overall picture quality.

The color on this TV was amazing. Even the less expensive Sony KDL-70R550A was on par with the plasma's. I'm sure if you really diagnose the black levels etc the plasma's might be better, but for your average consumer they will barely be able to tell the difference. I think this new gen of LED TV's is closing the gap with plasma's and you don't need to worry about the dimness issue of plasma TV's. I really hope Sony puts out a larger size version of this TV. Until then I may go with the amazing KDL-70R550A which in my opinion is the best 70\" mid level LED TV compared to  Sharp or Vizio.

I believe it's the best LED you can buy right now.Prior to purchasing the W900, I had decided to go with the Panasonic 60\" VT60 (which, at the time of purchase, was the same price as the 55\" W900). The plasma has a better picture. Hands down. That's why I'm docking one star off my review. However, I received three defective VT60s in a row and decided to go with this TV out of frustration with Panasonic.This TV looks great out of the box. I recommend turning frame interpolation off (because it's stupid) and another feature where the TV attempts to guess what type of signal it's receiving and adjusts the picture settings. My TV would randomly switch pictures modes when this setting was on and it was rather annoying. This TV is edge-lit, and can get noticeable blooming if local dimming is enabled. Aesthetically, the TV looks great; it's quite thin with a very small bezel.It's a great LED TV, but it's still an LED TV.

Reviews are right re colors, I basically bought it for its good reviews. Couple things. I noticed a non uniform LED lighting on the bottom edge in two spots. This is significantly obvious in bright white and light colors scenes overall. It appears as blotches with gray (dark) hue. Of course you'll never discover it in any other dark color screens except again the white or bright colors ones. This seems a problem with the W series now since I bought the W802 and returned it for this reason and few others. But honesly, it is worse in this one than the W802. I'm disappointed because a TV with this price should not have such problem especially with its dynamic edge LED and local dimming. I'm an engineer so I'm sensitive to these quality control issues. Another issue is the poor design of the base not aesthetic wise, since it is beautiful, but strength wise. The TV is heavy and once you install it on the base and tighten the 4 screws, it leans forward a bit from the top due to its weight i.e it is not completely straight vertically. This means that the steel bracket that the 4 screws go in has a faulty design. I guess it runs horizontally straight in the back instead of like a T shape to keep the upper TV from leaning forward. I might have a faulty set though. I placed a replacement order today and I'll update my stars review if the new TV is OK.UPDATE 1/27/2014:Second TV came today. It had few dents on the back near the upper bezel. I just documented it with CEVA and was hoping to get good consistent LED especially from the bottom edge since I don't really see the dent. Same problem, TV had non consistent lighting from the bottom like the 1st one. 3 spots now (at the bottom edge) instead of two in the first one. In addition, 2 others spots appeared on the top left. All appear as light grayish area of about 1\"x1\", some of this area is penetrated by thin bright ray in the middle of it breaking its grayish hue. You CANNOT SEE THESE unless you have a bright white, or off-white scenes. I'm very disappointed because I'm a Sony guy and still loyal till this moment. I fixed (a bit) the stand problem with my engineering background. Now it is not leaning forward that much like the first one but still not completely vertical on my water leveler. I got a price break because of the dent but to me, I'd rather pay full price with a perfect unit than accept a break and get a high blood pressure because I know there is something wrong with it everytime a bright scene comes. Not sure if I'll go for a third. I'll keep you posted.UPDATE 2/17/2014Third TV came today. It's the worst among all 3 TVs I got. Now these led edge blotches are everywhere, on bottom edge, top edge, and now some sides. I wished I had kept the first one since it had the least non-uniform edge lighting among the 3. I'm wondering how all these people, who rated this TV high, did not notice this mess with the edge lighting in bright scenes. This is garbage considering this a high tier TV.

PURCHASED A W900A ON MARCH 3RD AND GOT IT ON TIME, TOOK IT OUT OF THE BOX AND SET UP THE TV. UPON SETTING IT UP I NOTICED WITHIN A FEW HOURS THAT THERE WAS SOME SORT OF BLOTCHY' NESS AROUND THE SCREEN. KINDA LOOKED LIKE CLOUDS ON REALLY DARK SCENES. I CALLED UP SONY EXPLAINED MY PROBLEM AND THEY TOLD ME THAT WAS NORMAL. NOTHING ABOUT THIS SHOULD BE CONSIDERED NORMAL ESPECIALLY IF WE ARE TALKING ABOUT A $2000.00 TV. SO A FEW PHONE CALLS LATER I GOT THEM TO SEND ME A NEW TV.2. RECEIVED THE NEW TV BEGINNING OF APRIL SAME TV W900A. AND AGAIN I HAD THE SAME PROBLEMS, NOT AS MUCH AS THE FIRST ONE BUT ENOUGH TO SEE IT AND NOT LIKE IT. CALLED BACK SONY WITHIN HOURS BECAUSE NOW I KNOW WHAT I'AM LOOKING FOR. ON THE PHONE FOR 1HR THEY TOLD ME THEY WOULD SEND OUT A TECH TO SEE MY TV BECAUSE I WAS PAST MY 30 DAY MANUFACTURE WARRANTY. I SAID HOW IS THIS EVEN POSSIBLE I GOT A BRAND NEW TV WHICH CARRIES A NEW 30 DAY WARRANTY FOR REASONS LIKE THIS. THEY TOLD ME THEY PLACED THE TV ON THE OLD TV'S WARRANTY AND ORDER NUMBER. LOL. I HUNG UP WITH THEM AFTER FIGHTING AND ARGUING AND GETTING NOWHERE.3. FEW DAYS LATER I SEE THE XBR55850A 4K TV FOR $2299.99 ONLINE I CALL THEM UP AND TELL THEM I WOULD LIKE TO RETURN THE W900A AND UPGRADE TO A NEW TV AND PAY FOR IT, I WASN'T LOOKING FOR ANY DISCOUNT OR ANYTHING. I JUST WANTED TO GET A NICE TV AND HAVE NO PROBLEMS. THE REP TOLD ME I CANT RETURN MY TV EVEN THOUGH I WAS SPENDING MORE MONEY. IT WAS PAST THE 30 DAY WARRANTY. I FOUGHT AGAIN AND GOT A SUPERVISOR TO HEAR ME OUT. 2 HOURS LATER HE AGREES TO RETURN MY TV AND PLACE THE ORDER FOR ME. HE THEN TELLS ME THAT I HAVE TO RETURN MY W900A WAIT 5-7 DAYS FOR THE ORDER TO PROCESS THEN WAIT 2 DAYS FOR A NEW ORDER TO BE CREATED THEN 5-7 DAYS FOR SHIPMENT AND IT TO GET TO MY HOUSE. I LAUGHED OUT LOUD AND ASKED IF THEY COULD PROCESS A RETURN OVER THE PHONE AND SEND ME THE NEW TV WHEN THEY PICK UP THE OLD TV. HE SAID NO WITHOUT HESITATION. HE THEN PUT ME ON HOLD AND WITHIN 10 SECONDS THE PHONE GOT DISCONNECTED (HUNG UP ON)4. CALLED BACK THE NEXT DAY APRIL 15TH AND FINALLY GOT SOMEONE TO HELP ME. WELL SO I THOUGHT. WE AGREED ON EVERYTHING FROM THE RETURN TO THE SHIPPING TO THE PRICE. I GOT A REFERENCE NUMBER AND WAS FINALLY HAPPY. THE NEXT MORNING I GOT AN EMAIL SAYING THAT THERE WAS A PICK UP SCHEDULED FOR A RETURN BUT THAT'S IT NOTHING WAS WRITTEN DOWN AS A NEW TV COMING. I WAS PIST5. CALLED BACK TODAY APRIL 17TH SPOKE TO A SALES REP THAT TOLD ME THAT NOTHING WAS PLACED FOR A NEW TV ONLY A RETURN PICK UP. THEN HE TOLD ME THAT THEY COULD NOT HONOR THE PRICE OF $2299.99 BECAUSE THE INTERNET PRICE IS FOR $2499.99 AND THAT I WOULD HAVE TO PAY MORE MONEY. I TOLD HIM TO LOOK AT THE NOTES AND SEE WHAT WAS DISCUSSED YESTERDAY AND JUST WRITE ME UP FOR THE NEW TV. HE AGAIN TOLD ME NO. I JUST WANTED TO GET OFF THE PHONE WITH HIM I AGREED TO PAY MORE, I HAD TO PAY $300.00 OUT OF POCKET BECAUSE I HAD A CERTAIN AMOUNT ON MY GE FINANCE CARD. AGAIN HE TELLS ME NO, THEY CANT DO THAT. I CANT USE 2 CREDIT CARDS. I WOULD HAVE TO BUY A GIFT CARD THE AMOUNT OWED AND USE THAT. AND IF THERE IS A PROBLEM AND I NEED TO RETURN THE TV I WOULD GET MY CREDIT BACK ON A GIFT CARD FOR SONY ONLY. MAKES NO SENSE SO I DIDN'T END UP BUYING ANYTHING. AND HE ALSO TOLD ME THAT THAT TV WAS NEVER ON SALE FOR $2299.99 SO NOW THEY ARE CALLING ME A LIAR. SO FED UP WITH THIS EXPERIENCE I TOLD THEM TO PICK UP THE TV AND CREDIT ME BACK. HE TOLD ME THAT THEY WOULD NOT DO THAT, THEY WILL PICK UP THE TV AND SEND ME OUT A REPLACEMENT TV BECAUSE MY 30 DAYS WAS UP BECAUSE THEY CONTINUE TO PUT THE NEW TV UNDER THE OLD TV WARRANTY. SO EVERYTHING WAS FOR NOTHING AND THEY DON'T WANT TO HELP ME OUT.

Living in the lightening capital of the world I have always used the monster home theater surge protectors not only for plugs in but cable.  Monitors have come a long way but they are not TVs -- Yes the Sony pretty sharp but lacks depth of a true TV -- A good TV enlarged should actually give you a way better viewing than the theatre and with my plasmas it is still true.  Oddly enough, I go quality first and then size so I was surprised to go against the crowd about this issue:  this 55 inch (it is bigger) actually appears smaller than the plasma.  I was concerned about other plasmas due to software issues - unfortunately it is hard to buy a high quality dumb TV and separate the components (sound, internet, etc) so with much debate I talked myself into this.  I this is as good a monitor as others have stated then I dread to see what the avg. tv monitor quality is like.

And yes I tried all the settings and my brother who worked for fender and is a musician helped me no luck !!! Also the sound bar they were trying to give a discount on with this tv. .. Don't know if it's the same promotion but I read in various magazines and researched spun bars and that don't sound bar is horrible be careful!! And I waited months  to give this review and tried everything with the tv !!! Before this because I used to love sony !! So that is why people are asking to turn the 3 D off because the pixelation is soooo bad with HDX HD AND SD !!!! Sorry this was a short novel !!! I don't like Samsung and I would go to them first if I had a chance !!! Again or LG and get an ACTIVE 3D tv google the difference you will be surprised and I told amazon the back of the tv said LCD by the model number not LED like it states !!! They did not change the description !!!! Let sony take the fall !!! I want a do over I want to return this and get a better tv but it's to late and I missed my chance !!!", "Date": "December 1, 2013"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "Unavailable", "Features": "Pro-grade detail for discerning eyes: X-Reality PRO\nTRILUMINOS display with more brilliant colors than ever\nDynamic Edge LED backlight for amazing contrast\nExperience precise motion clarity w/ Motionflow XR 960\nTV without stand (Width x Height x Depth): 48.9 X 28.5 X 2.5 Inches, TV with stand (Width x Height x Depth): 48.9 X 29.9 X 11.8 Inches", "Name": "Sony KDL-55W900A 55-Inch 240Hz 1080p 3D Internet LED HDTV (Black) (2013 Model)", "ImgURL": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51332JDSoQL._SX300_.jpg", "ProductID": "B00AWKBZ0M"}}
