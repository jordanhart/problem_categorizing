This was important as I wanted to put the set inside my entertainment cabinet.* Great tuner: My old analog TV could only pick up 2 channels via the antenna. (I mostly watch DVDs.) The Samsung picked up over 20 digital channels flawlessly, just using a $20 RadioShack inside antenna!  I don't need cable!* The picture is simply stunning when you are viewing a hi-definition broadcast (1080i).

This is exactly the same sort of sound distortion described in another review.Samsung is still currently researching this issue and does not have a fix for it yet.  The temporary fix is to do a factory reset by holding down the exit button for greater than 10 seconds.  Every time the TV loses power (unplugged or brown out) you will have to do a factory reset of the TV to correct the sound distortion problem.I WOULD HIGHLY SUGGEST people check out this issue on the CNET forums [...] and type in \"LN32A330 sound distortion\" before purchasing the television.This is not an isolated problem and apparently many many Samsung LCD televisions are having this issue.I just wanted to add this review so that you can educate yourself on a possible problem when you decide which TV you are going to purchase.", "Date": "February 7, 2009"}, {"Title": "nice performing and relatively inexpensive enty level HDTV", "Author": "D. Kelly", "ReviewID": "R3BRIM30CNXVKK", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Just bought this set a couple of days ago. I have had my eye on the new models that run at 120hz but just couldn't justify paying over $1600 on th 46 inch set I wanted. I bought this set as a test to see if the reviews on Samsung sets are accurate.Set up is a snap with this set. I only had to consult the manual to figure out how to turn off the welcoming chimes. Everything else is easily found on the on screen menue.DTV stations on my over the air antenna look great. Weak analog stations need some picture manipulation to make them visible but the tuner over all performs well. HDTV content over the satellite is excellent. I was suprised at how well the set performs on fast motion action. It's rated a 6ms which is just 2ms more than the much pricier 120hz models. Granted you don't get as high of a contrast ration, but for the price I can't complain the black level is good. Blue ray disks and playstation 3 games look amazing.I run the sound through my Denon home theater and it performs well. The set speakers do an adequate job although sound separation is limited even with the SRS sound engaged so I just use my Linaeum center channel.I plan on using this set as a pc monitor as well, I just haven't hooked it up yet.I still plan on buying the LNA630 wich is full 1080p and runs at 120hz, but until the price drops this set will suffice.Bottom line this is a good set for the price and it is small enough that you don't need to run 1080p. The refresh rate is only 60hz but motion blur is minimal. The only down side is the remote is not back lit and seems a little cheap. I will review this set again in six months to keep you posted on how it is holding up. If it continues to perform well I should be buying another larger set at that time.", "Date": "October 10, 2008"}, {"Title": "Best for the Price", "Author": "R.

It says in the ad that it is white glove and they unpackage it etc, but they just dropped it at the door and left.The picture and sound is very good - just as good as my 42\" Hitachi which I paid over $2000 for 3 years ago. The only negative is that it makes a loud beeping noise when you turn on and off. I am not sure if you can change that somewhere. But my TV is in the bedroom. If I am watching something late and turn it off, the noise wakes my wife up. Also I dont like the remote control. It looks cheap.

The Samsung HDTV we purchased is a 32\" inch, and though that sounds small, it's not. it has excellent visibility from all around the room. The only negative remark I can & will make is the sound, as it has excellent stero sound on the television speakers, they just don't carry the lows and deep richness you need for realistic movie or MUSIC quality. I am running my system through a Pioneer 60 watt system with two bottom cabinets and two mid cabinets, and I let the TV carry the highs and the Pioneer system handle all the lows and richness.

I call Samsung, they have me unplug it from the surge protector and plug it into the wall - nothing.  They ask me if it's connected to a computer - I tell them no.  They take all of my info and the serial number and politely tell me that I will be responsible for paying for the repairs on the TV as one of the internal components has failed.  I tell them that I do not think that is fair considering I spent around $800 at the time to purchase this TV and now I have to pay to fix it after only 2 years.  They say there's nothing they can do and set up a service ticket for me, and then I can decide whether or not I will pay to repair the TV once the repair service calls me to tell me how much it will cost to fix it.  I can tell you one decision I've already made, and that's to NEVER BUY ANOTHER SAMSUNG PRODUCT AGAIN.  Before my TV I had a Samsung DVD player that also died after 2 years.  So it looks like the average life expectancy on a Samsung product is 2 years.  For the money, I'd say that's ridiculous.  So there you go Samsung, you've lost both a customer and a promoter.

I had to call the next day to schedule an appointment for them to come to my place to repair it, and now I'm going to have to use a vacation day waiting from them to come out, because they don't do repairs evenings or weekends. So far, a pretty miserable experience.UPDATE: Samsung repair came to the house, but they didn't bring the right part. Apparently, this TV's innards are plastic, not metal like the last model, and the official Samsung repair people didn't even have this plastic part yet.

BTW, the reviewer who said you can't use a VCR with this set because \"it doesn't have the outdated composite video input that VCRs require\" is incorrect.

Watching DVD via HDMI connection I have had a couple of movies that I gave up on trying to watch because I couldn't understand or hear the dialog. The movies didn't have closed captioning and it didn't matter how high the volume was turned up. The volume wasn't the issue. I did use the LN32A300 audio adjustments and they helped a very small amount.I suppose that I will have to by a small 2.1 speaker system and run the audio signal out of the DVD player.

A TV this expensive should last longer than 15 months.  It is infuriating that Samsung refuses to stand behind it's product quality.

The sound will get robotic and distorted on HD channels if you do not have a cable box/DVR hooked up to a defective unit. Every few minutes the sound will get really distorted when HD programming is on, last from anywhere from a few seconds to several minutes, then disappear and get really distorted again every 3-5 minutes or less. The problem may not occur right away, as it did in our case; it took a few weeks for it to occur. This happens not only on this model of Samsung LCD TVs, but on numerous others. Some units have the problem, while others do not, so getting the problem is quite random depending on what TV you get. Mostly this is a problem with Comcast, but I have heard it also happens with other cable companies without a box. Search the Internet for Samsung \"distorted sound\" and \"robotic audio\" for more information on the problem. Samsung is completely unresponsive about this problem and there are many angry owners. It's an extremely annoying problem that currently has no permanent fix. We've had the circuit board replaced once, but the sound problem came back within a matter of days. We tried to get the circuit board replaced again, but the circuit board they gave us was defective. What great products Samsung makes, huh? Then they tried to replace our TV with an older, less expensive model. Their customer service is also the worst we have ever experienced; they just don't care about their customers. We do not plan to buy any more Samsung products in the future because of our experience. We really are very disappointed.My best advice is to avoid this TV (or any Samsung LCD TV, for that matter) if you don't have a cable box. If you do have a cable box/DVR, there is no problem at all with sound and you can ignore my review. However, not everyone wants or needs a cable box (we just have basic cable and do not need the extra expense each month or the extra channels, which would cost $40 more a month at least for us), so having a faulty tuner is a big problem. There is no excuse for shoddy products. The TV should work fine in any environment, not just in homes with cable boxes, and that is the main issue here. I have no clue how this got through inspection. This has just been our experience with this TV and it has not been a good one.Update: There is a temporary fix for this problem which involves doing a factory reset by holding down the Exit button for 10 seconds and reprogramming all of the channels. This seems to fix the problem temporarily until the TV stops receiving power (either by power outage, power fluctuations, or by unplugging the TV). It's not permanent, but it's something until a permanent fix is found, if one is ever found.", "Date": "November 28, 2008"}, {"Title": "As others have said, it's got bad capacitors.

Samsung used underpowered capacitors and they blow after 1 to 1 and a half years of use.  Samsung has admitted to the problem though, and will make a one time repair free of charge (except for finding a box to send it in) even if the TV is out of warranty.  Customer Service was quick and friendly over the phone.  You've got to send it to a repair center and they pay for the shipping (when you send it in, send the MONITOR ONLY, it seems people have had troubles getting parts back if they send in the base and it's screws).  I just hope they put in better capacitors and not just replace the old ones with the same kind of insufficient capacitor (I haven't gotten the tv back yet so I can't say for sure).  Though it looks like it took a bit of convincing (from what I've read on forums), I find it admirable that Samsung is making an effort to fix their mistake.So with that major hiccup aside, this is a good tv.

My parents had a Samsung and I've always thought the picture quality was the best on the block.  I based my purchase solely on what I saw in the store and the specs - I did not do any research to find out if there were any systemic problems.  Well, turns out, there are a lot of problems with this and other Samsung models.  18 months after purchase I turned the TV on and the screen went black, but the sound continued to play.  So I turned it off, waited, then back on. The TV displayed an image for a fleeting second, then went black with the sound continuing to play... again. I repeated this multiple times with the same result.  I then tried switching outlets, moving it to a different room, different inputs, etc... I tried everything.  Nothing works.So, I jumped on-line last night and this problem is so popular that if you Google the model number you'll see all the different \"predictive searches\" that people have done, many regarding this or similar problems.  When I looked into it further, this problem is widespread, but you apparently have to fight with Samsung's customer service reps just to get them to acknowledge it's a problem.  That said, they still won't offer you anything for your problems once the TV is out of warranty. From what I've read, it costs between $200-300 to fix, plus shipping.  Considering the $550 purchase price, that's simply not feasible... and not worth it.I understand that a warranty is what it is, but if your television sets have what is clearly a systemic problem, a recall or a discounted repair is in order.

I heard & read of LCD T.V's having a shadow or \"lag\", or problems with depth & black backrounds not being crisp with fast paced games....well after 2 weeks and countless games...this t.v. ROCKS!!!!!! No perceptible problems.....crisp, clear, fast. I compared this set in the store against Sony, Vizio, Sharp, Toshiba, and saw a great review where Samsung took first in LCD t.v.'s from 19\" to 42\" for their price range.

Of course I had to call numerous times and escalate with Samsung before they finally admitted to the issue and they sent me a prepaid label to send it in to their outsourced NJ service center.  3 weeks and several calls later my TV has finally arrived fixed sans my hardware to connect the base to the TV.

Initially I wanted a TV/DVD combo but then I thought that I can always connect my computer to the TV and watch movies if I want to and besides there aren't many LCD TV/DVD combos in 32 inches available in the market and the ones available are either too expensive or have not scored that many points. So that was the back ground of it.The TV....oh man...what a TV. Really love it. It is 720p and I do not have HD programming so this TV is perfect for SD streaming. The picture is so crisp and clear. The sound which was my main criteria of selection since it was for the bedroom, is very clear, does not echo or distort.There is a sweet sound that I love when the TV is turned on and off. It is light weight.Ironically, even though the TV is so good I had to hang it --- on the wall, yes I wall mounted it with the help of my friend.I am guessing this TV is getting replaced by newer TVs, so u wud expect its price to go down but this TV is so good I doubt they will further reduce its price.

I bought this tv a few days ago and couldn't believe how terrible the picture was. Could I have been having a bad dream in which I couldn't awake? The picture had terrible blacks if you can call them blacks. They looked more like dirty dishwater. The picture was a washed out gray. Colors seemed to all run together. They seemed so undefined to my eyes. Colors reminded me of wet watercolors all running together. I tried every adjustment I could think of to get the picture to look better but no success. The only things I liked about the entire tv was the sound and the looks of the tv. The black shiny set had a real sexy sleek look to it. I liked the frequency sliders to tune the sound to my preference. When comparing the picture of the Samsung to my two Philips lcds,there was not contest. The Philips picture was so much better than this set.I wasn't able to look at the picture using a dvd player because the HDMI and component imputs would not work. I kept getting an onscreen message telling me that there was no signal detected. Anyway, I figured maybe I just got a defective unit. I took the tv back and decided to try again. I exchanged it for the exact same model. When I got the second Samsung all hooked up, the picture was just as terrible. Could I have gotten two models in a row that were defective? I don't think so. This time the HDMI, Component, and composite inputs worked. I couldn't get a descent picture even with my blu-ray player connected to the HDMI input. What a let down I felt with this piece of junk. Another annoying thing about this model was the remote. You can't just push station numbers on the remote to switch from watching dvds to watching tv. You have to push the source button first. I've never had this type of setup on any of my lcd tvs. I've always been able to go directly to a tv station from any input by pushing a station number. I would advise any potential buyers of this set to refrain. I don't think you'll be happy with it unless you are comming directly from the crt tvs and don't know how good a lcd set can look.
