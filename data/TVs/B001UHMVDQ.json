While watching credits at the end of a movie, you can see light and dark patches when the background is supposed to be solid black.

We looked at a lot of LCD and Plasmas but saw none that gave us the sense of depth this one does. It is like 3D. Moreover, our family room is also a sun room during the day but the picture is just as strong in the day time as it is when the room is dark. The viewing angle is comparatively wide. We see no appreciable drop off when it is viewed at an angle. It is large enough that my wife can view it from the adjacent kitchen with ease.Learning how to use its features and to set it up is another matter and that is the one gripe I have with the TV. Samsung only provides a four page manual which tells the owner nothing. Instead it includes a flash drive which contains a manual for its use but it took me over three weeks to realize what the flash drive was for. The manual does not show the available ports or how things are to be connected to the TV. I finally figured it out by trial and error and got the flash drive connected. Finding out how to use it however, was again a lot of trial and error. Once I was able to read the pages, it was hard to read, mostly grey on black (I hate black-you can't see where anything is on black). Figuring how to page the manual on the TV isn't easy. Samsung provides numerous steps to take but the user has to leave the Manual screen to go through the steps and unless the user writes out all the steps, it is a tiresome process to follow the steps.So I tried using the flash drive on my computer. Well the manual is in a strange format so it will not open normally. Windows searched for a driver that would allow viewing the manual and found one which I downloaded and installed The one I found that worked was from IrFanView but one must also download all the plugins before it will work. However, when I opened the Manual, it was unprintable except with a screen capture utility.That was more trouble than it was worth and it then dawned on me to go to the Samsung Support Center and see if there was a Manual that could be downloaded. Voila, the Manual was available in both PDF and Word formats but because the Manual is in three languages, it is 273 pages long. Just print the first 75 pages.What I found is that with no difficulty I could run picture shows directly from either my camera or from a card reader. They come out beautifully. If I tried to print pictures that big, they would be grainy as all get out. But the pictures show in full size on the big screen in  terrific detail and color and they have depth.But I wish the USB ports were either on the side or the front where they are easily accessible. I intend to wall mount the screen but if I do I won't be able to get to the connections which are on the back. And even then it is difficult to insert USB cords because the recess is so narrow.We love this TV however, because of the lack of a printed manual and the location of the USB ports, I can only give it 4 stars.", "Date": "April 25, 2009"}, {"Title": "AMAZING.... sometimes.

Set-up was great. Features-a-plenty! Picture quality... AMAZING!!!.... sometimes. I played 'UP' on blu-ray. It blew my mind! Full screen, and bright colors; you will not find a tv with a better image. There is a definate sweet spot for viewing. Which leads me to my first complaint.-Viewing angle: When your in the sweet spot. It looks great! When your one couch cushion over, you start to loose it. Contrast is lost, and dark images turn into a washed out blueish color. I was used to the viewing angle on my Samsung plasma, and deeply missed it after setting up the LED.- Low Light: This is a Great TV for daytime viewing. Colors stand out. At night, in a dark room? Not so much. You start to notice that the blacks are not as black as they were during the day. Also, you will notice the corners of the screen starting to light up with a bluish tinge. Extremely distracting especially when watching a movie or show with a 1.85 or 2.4 aspect ratio.-Backlight uniformity: What uniformity? In a very dark scene, you will really start to notice hot spots and cold spots when it comes to backlight. On an all black screen, it looks like black and blue camo. I even noticed Hot Spots during the olypics in very white areas. Again, distracting. This is most likely due to the side lighting as opposed to the full array lighting.OVERVIEW! When you find that sweet spot, and play somthing full screen or with a native 16X9 resolution, the picture will blow your mind. But when you stand up, walk around, watch in a dark room, or watch movies that are matted on top and bottom? You will really start to notice a dissapointing amount of distracting problems.I wish I didn't have to return it, but unfortunately I am going back to plasma.\"", "Date": "February 26, 2010"}, {"Title": "Enjoying the Samsung UN55B6000 HDTV", "Author": "inter.active", "ReviewID": "RKEQDB4YA7W4Q", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Image Quality and Connectivity:This Samsung UN55B6000 is excellent technology and priced to move. We've got it hooked up to a cable box (MOT DCT 6200) via the 1 component connection and the image is sharp and crispy and the colors are vivid and bright.We have an older PC connected via the VGA connection and the 3.5mm mini audio connection. Internet browser windows come up real sharp in 1920x1280i resolution. Sidebar: I'm also using wi fi and wireless mouse and keyboard.Hi-res images look fantastic. This TV was assembled with web-browsing and computing in mind (Net widget, USB, JPEG and mp3 friendly) and Samsung has nailed it.Online Support and Configuring the Cable Box:Initially, the cable box was sending 720x480i to the TV. Fortunately I was able to find forums online with posts from a Samsung HD Tech and a cable co. employee that outlined the solution -- turn off the cable box, hit the menu button (cable remote) and here you can select the higher (or different) resolution.Additionally, the cable box required two power cycles for this (resolution) change to take effect but when it did I was viewing cable tv in 1920x1080i.Using Samsung's  P.Size (Picture) Button:When watching cable programming broadcast in HD, the 16:9 (aspect ratio) mode looks the best to me. For standard definition programming the Wide-Fit mode stretches the image a bit to fill the screen.I've noticed some adjusting is required when flipping between channels, for example, sometimes CNN ticker text is below the screen and other times the Fox Sports Net FSN graphic is a bit above the screen. Perhaps this issue is addressed in the screen-fit mode, I'm not sure yet, I'll have to mash a few more buttons.

Samsung's LCDs are class-leading, but you have to shop wisely ;)  We were impressed with the LED-backlit lineup (6,7,8) - Touch of Color, incredibly thin cases, great features, and exceptional picture quality.  These are not the LCDs of days past; pixelation has all but disappeared, and black levels are impressive.  You will find critical reviews online, and they are valuable for comparison purposes, but you really need to see these sets in person to appreciate recent advancements in image technology.Per reviews and in person, the flagship 8500 provides an unmatched viewing experience, but it has a price tag to match.  However, we were impressed at the picture quality offered by this \"entry-level\" Series 6 LED-backlit television for at least $1,500 less.  The specs (4ms response time; 3,000,000:1 contrast ratio, 120Hz processing) may not be on par with the 8500, but you need to see these TVs in person before spending the extra money.  Keep in mind that any of these TVs will look amazing in the home.Through Amazon, we beat our local stores' prices by at least $500 (and received free shipping).  Delivery was easy, as these TVs are extremely light for their size.  And despite the 1.2\" thick case, the TV's frame feels solid.  That said, if you have kids or pets, you may want to either wall-mount this set or use the included anchor to prevent any possibility of tipping the set off of its base.I think the only negative so far is the lack of analog inputs, but we knew of this before purchase.  We have an old DVD player connected via the component inputs, and everything else is connected via HDMI.  A friend brought over a PS2 for a party last night, but we couldn't connect it, as it had only analog outputs (unlike the PS3).  So be sure to assess your system for connectivity before purchasing.All in all, a great TV!  It wasn't cheap by any means, but it offers great features and is a less-expensive alternative to the top-of-the-line sets.", "Date": "December 14, 2009"}, {"Title": "Seeing red...and blue vertical pinstripes!", "Author": "JC", "ReviewID": "R32E9O58UUJAIT", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "When I first received this unit I was stunned by how thin it was.  As always, Amazon did an excellent job of getting it to my door.  I went with free shipping and when CEVA called me and gave me a 4 hour window, I asked if they could call me 30 minutes in advance.  They obliged.  They unpacked it and set it on my stand, after removing my (3 great years and then 3 lights of death victim) 61\" Samsung DLP paperweight.  I plugged in my existing HDMI cable and fired it up.  The bright HD channel feed looked excellent in the daylight.  I gave the delivery guys a much appreciated Hamilton for some after work brews (hopefully boosting my karma and luck with this new tech).I continued to scrutinize this set under various conditions.  Obviously, because of my low rating, this unit very quickly experienced a catastrophic failure, so I will start with:The Bad:* High glare screen--I have a window directly behind my couch, so I had to purchase blackout shades.  I realize that a high gloss screen is necessary to achieve the incredible punch and pop of this display.* Noticeably poor off angle viewing--This was not a huge issue to me, but even standing up just outside of my dining room (30 degrees off axis), colors and blacks were noticeably washed out.  I did not even notice this with my DLP, which is known for this issue.* Motion blur--I realize that this is inherent with LCD tech.  I personally wouldn't use the 120hz functionality except for when watching sports and from what I could see, it made little difference, even when using custom with anti blur high and dejudder low.The Unacceptable:* Terrible screen uniformity/cloudiness--I started noticing this immediately during low light/dark sequences and also when switching my receiver input to another source without the feed engaged.  It looked like dark and light grey camo.  I watched \"The Thing\" on bluray and played \"GOWIII\" on my PS3 and what made my skin crawl was not the content, it was noticing this glaring issue during dark sequences.* Autodimming function (backlight fluctuation)--This is the most inane thing I've ever experienced with a TV.  Why would anyone be happy with the screen fluctuating when scenes go from light to dark?  Maybe the contrast and black levels benefit, but at sacrificing PQ?  Trust me, I fiddled with the dynamic contrast and other various settings to no avail...no, I am not willing to watch all sources in game mode (apparently this disables autodimming).  Another way to enable autodimming is to go into the service menu, which at the discretion of Samsung, may void the warranty.  Why not add this into the regular menu?  Because edgelit LED LCD TV's have no other way of improving contrast.  That would be like admitting a poor design.* Red and blue vertical pinstripes--Whaaaa???  Yeah, that's what I said (well, perhaps more like, *you have to be freaking kidding me!*).  With about 5 days left of being able to return/exchange this set through Amazon, it developed this anomaly across the entire screen--not visible in pure white or black colors.  I checked the unit with all input sources, including over air HD and also plugged it straight into the wall outlet.  I will post pictures if anyone is curious/mortified.The Good:* Cross section--This is one of the thinnest TV's I've seen, and this is just the tip of the iceberg I'm sure.  The new 2010 9000 series looks even more mindblowing.  If Samsung can manage to produce a unit with excellent PQ and durability at this price point, everyone wins...even Samsung (loyalty is a good thing, right?)  Unfortunately, if your best viewing angle is from the side, nobody wins...unless you are a minimalist.* Picture--The color and brilliance of this display is spectacular.  If you plan on watching only sitcoms, sports and bright scenes, then it's all puppy dogs and ice cream (my apologies for the blatant sarcasm--if Samsung would fix the \"unacceptable\" during the quality control process, my cynicism would float away like little white puffy clouds in a bright blue sky ; ).  I'm picturing some suit drinking coffee, shrugging his shoulders, saying (in Korean) \"Meh, good enough for the rich, stupid consumers...they'll buy anything shiny.\"The Really Bad:* I purchased this unit, even after reading bad reviews!Needless to say, I called up Amazon and they will be picking up the unit and refunding my $$ at no additional cost.  I am actually glad the pinstripe issue occurred, as it has made my decision to jump the Samsung battleship an easy one.  Also, I don't know if Amazon would have taken it back just based on screen uniformity and backlight fluctuation, as these seem to be design flaws and not signs of a defective unit.  Sure, perhaps replacing this unit like for like would give me a screen with better uniformity, but why would I (or should I have to) take that gamble?  It is also possible that this unit experienced delayed damage due to shipping.  These TV's are required to be shipped in the upright position...you just never know.I have been in HDTV purgatory ever since my DLP bit the dust 3 months ago.  I really loved that display and have been in mourning (along with my friends) ever since.  Regardless of the relative massiveness of it and the fact it needed a breathing buffer behind it, the PQ was excellent.  Playing games split screen on the 61\" screen was fantastic.  At first I spent many hours researching and reading how to fix it.  When I realized that I could easily spend a thousand plus fixing it, I spent many hours researching, reading and trying to decide between CCFL backlit LCD, edgelit LED LCD, LED backlit LCD and plasma.Bottom line:* I believe this may be all Samsung cares about.  From my experience and reading forum posts, they must be satisfied taking an inordinate amount of both informed and uninformed consumer casualties...as there's a sucker born every minute.  Dazzle them with the package and promise of an awesome display, while secretly twisting the knife with planned obsolescence manufacturing and ultimately sub par PQ.  I've worked as a validation engineer for over 8 years, so I know poor QA and accountability when I see it.  Granted, I have not dealt with Samsung directly, but I have heard their customer service is a crap shoot.  Perhaps if I get the competition to sponsor \"Samsung DLP Destruction Fest 2010\", I can get them to own up to shoddy manufacturing...I have some really great ideas for this event!I apologize if I've offended any loyal Samsung customers who are happy with their purchases.  I wish you many years of continued enjoyment.  If I've offended any Samsung employees...good!  Perhaps you will be motivated to do something about it.  I'm just not willing to take another chance and purchase a Samsung that craps out just after the mfg warranty or extended 2 to 4 year warranty expires.What happened to the days of being positive that a TV investment would last 10 to 20 years?

First, it's very disappointing to learn that most, if not all, flat screens seem to be disposable in less than two years.  The price tag on these sets is just too expensive for the life expectancy, this includes my last TV and the new Samsung.  I'm not expecting it to last beyond the period mentioned, as I have already read a number of bad reviews on it.  However, as flat screen TVs go and for the money, this one seems to look the best in the store. Everywhere I have looked, no other TV on the display wall compares to the clarity.Unfortunately, I just hung mine last night and have already noted the problem many others are talking about with the backlight bleeding through the corners of the screen.  What this looks like is 4 spotlights shining from the corners toward the middle with a luminous range of about 8 to 10 inches.  This problem is more noticeable with darker images or when the top and bottom black bars are present.  Regardless of lighting though, the problem is always present.  The odd thing is the problem did't seem to manifest until about 8 hours of viewing time.Another noticeable quirk is the illumination changes that occur when the picture changes.  Often times it's very noticeable that the slightest change in the picture will cause the set to gradually make adjustments to the luminosity of the entire image.  I'm not sure how to explain this better except to say that when something small in the picture should be brighter, the entire picture becomes brighter for a moment and then adjusts down accordingly.  The process of brightening or dimming adjustments is a bit too slow or gradual.Aside from size issues, I would much prefer to go back to the CRT televisions until all the little flaws and quirks related to flat screen technology is perfected.  But, as flat screens go, this set does provide the best picture I have seen yet.I, for one, found the menu system to be easy enough to navigate and the settings reasonably easy to understand and adjust.  What I don't like is that it takes up a bit too much real estate on the screen.As for the audio, I'm using a home theater system, so I haven't taken the opportunity to notice this feature for comments.  I will say this, I find it a little annoying that when the TV is switched on or off, it presents an intro and outro theme tune similar to MS Windows.  To me it's a little tacky, but a small quirk I can live with.Another thing worth noting, if you are using a standard coaxial cable, be prepared for a fight to get that sucker attached to the TV.  Because of the slim design, all the component connections are almost directly against the surface of the back side of the set.  Furthermore, the connections available are very limited.All in all, this set is reasonable for a flat screen TV with the best picture in it's class.  The only thing that is most likely better is the Samsung 8000 series. But note that it too has it's flaws which I have gained information on in researching these TVs.On the down side, I don't think that it's price tag is all that reasonable, nor do I think that the higher-end 8000 series at a whopping $4000+ is either.  Simply, the cost of home entertainment has become just a bit too expensive for the level of quality and life expectancy, or lack thereof.", "Date": "December 5, 2009"}, {"Title": "Great picture, audio issues...", "Author": "G.

A lot of folks will mention that the internal speakers are really crippled by the fact that the TV is so flat (the main speakers fire down and back from the left and right sides of the bottom of the TV).  Most peoples' first reaction is to grab an inexpensive add-on surround speaker system like the Yamaha NS-SP1800BL and plug it into the audio output from the TV.  The problem is that Samsung has designed their TV's to not allow the user to control the audio output volume from the remote.  You can set the TV to disable the internal speakers, but the volume control does nothing.  It's called a Fixed Output audio output.  This may sound nit-picky, but not being able to use a good, simple fix for the poor internal speakers means that you start having to buy much more expensive solutions. On top of it all, the work around to this issue means you get to add another remote or more complex universal remote programming.It turns out that people have been complaining about this to Samsung for a year or more (search for \"Audio Outs are fixed\" on CNET's Samsung blog).

I am absolutely thrilled with it. After doing extensive research and learning that the Plasma market share has dropped to an all time low, that Vizio and Pioneer completely abandoned Plasma, and having an image burn into my Panasonic Plasma (this is Plasma's dirty little secret, if you don't believe me, google it!) screen two days after I bought it, trying a Sharp LED which was a piece of junk to be completely honest, and 2 different Samsung LCD's, I went for this. Yes, it was expensive, but definitely worth it! For starters, the blacks are so much better than a standard LCD and rival Plasmas, which was the only thing Plasma used to have bragging rights on (along with better viewing angles which Plasma still has a slight edge. Plasmas supposed bragging rights about 600 hz processing are mute - when you are up to 240hz motion blur is long gone by then) Secondly, the brightness is amazing, and the crispness is unsurpassed by Standard LCD or Plasma. I saw Transformers II on Blu Ray being demonstrated on this tv at HHGregg and all I can say is I was blown away. I saw it side by side next to a Samsung standard LCD and the difference was significant. If you are a videophile, this tv is a must. I do not have an unlimited budget, so I went with this model. The higher models had 240 hz processing, which according to research I've read, is not noticeable unless you get into gaming and I am not a gamer. If you want the latest and greatest, you will not be disappointed with this set. The CHASSIS ROCKS! So thin and sleak and the touch of color is very pleasing to the eye. I guess I can't say enough good things. Samsung has proven again why they have 52% of the market share.

Also sitting position makes a big difference in backlight, if you're sitting directly in front you see a lot less backlight. During daytime you can't see the backlight so its no big deal. Picutre is awsome, very good colors and clarity is amazing, im rewatching all my movies now just to see what i've been missing, 120hz makes a huge difference, makes movies look so real they almost look \"fake\", wife doesn't like the 120hz effect but i do. I'm running video via denon 2310ci upgrading the signal to HD so i dont have any problems with SD tv which looks good to (depending on channel) and i have a PC connected to it and media center looks amazing on this tv, but i couldn't get highest resolution (1920) to fit correctly on the screen so i had to step it down once.

I took the Samsung cause the picture looked sharper at the store and while still smarting from a Sony reliability issue.Once set up at home, I started to reconsider my choice. While the dark levels are definitly darker, the glossy screen is a nuissance during low lit scenes.The bezel design is such that the speakers have nowhere to go but behind the TV which relies purely on the condition and distance of the wall behind it. Compared to the Sony, the sound coming out of this TV sucked.Samsung defaults their screen with 95% contrast level. So there's not much room for increased contrasts if you ever need to. I believe this is how Samsung obtains their contrast advantage, raise it to max then cover it with a glossy screen.The slim design also limits source input options. It comes with 4 HDMIs and only either a component or composite source. With the Sony I can connect all my sources redundantly so no need to boot up the power hungry receiver 100% of the time.So if you hook up all your components into the TV via HDMI, the sound going into your A/V receiver depends on how well the TV can pass it through.Another thing I've noticed, viewing angle is somewhat narrow before the picture quality start to fade. Definitely narrower than the Sony.

We've owned several LCDs and plasmas, and this is an outstanding product.In my house, we don't particulary care for the Auto Motion while watching TV shows. For games and sports, it's great, but it seems almost unnatural while watching some shows. We bought this model because we knew that we weren't going to use the 240 Hz Auto Motion anyway.I have a few things to point out about this TV though.First, the power cord is incredibly short (At least the one we received from Amazon Warehouse Deals, it was.). This is a very important thing to know if you are mounting on the wall or above a fireplace that doesn't have a highly mounted power outlet.Second, there is only one speaker, and it is in the back of the TV. This isn't particularly a problem for us because we use an A/V receiver, but don't expect the TV's audio to sound good on its own. Another thing concerning audio, is that it does not have Audio Out so that you can plug your components (DirectTV, XBOX, Blue Ray, Computer...) into the TV and have the audio be sent out to a stereo.BE PREPARED TO BUY AN A/V RECEIVER.", "Date": "March 9, 2010"}, {"Title": "Great TV, greate purchasing experience!", "Author": "hilmaster", "ReviewID": "R3RUQ5TR0PSNFA", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This is an awesome TV despite some of the negative comments you may read.

Their service is excellent, super fast shipping and no surprises as far as the product condition and/or description, you can rest assure that you get right original product every time.Back to the TV, looks beautiful On or Off. The contrast ratio is AMAZING, super blacks and pure whites, the quality of the image is superb! Just make sure you have HD content available to really appreciate the picture quality. No problems so far with corner light issues, you will have to be extremely picky and force yourself to find this type of issue. Samsung has the best design in the market, so thin, lightweight and energy efficient, it produces NO heat whatsoever.Perhaps the only negative is the speaker sound, it's not great but good enough for regular TV programming. However, this is not a problem to me, I have always used a home theatre system for music concerts or movies with all the TV's I have owned.The 120Hz motion effect is very cool; it may not work with all types of programming but for nature or sport events is pretty neat!

I've only had a chance to watch HD TV (no blur ray or games yet), but I must say that I am amazed with the picture quality.  I'll keep this review short and only mention what I believe are the shortcomings of the TV.1 - Corner lights  - yes this a side-effect of this type of television, but I found it really annoying.  You don't notice it at all if you are watching a full screen picture, but for movies in letterbox it is extremely noticeable.  When I first started watching the TV I had it set to the \"Natural\" setting, which made the corner lights very apparent.  I have since changed the setting to \"Standard\" and the color temperature to \"cool.\"  In my opinion this minimizes the effect.  The lights are still there, but much less of a nuisance.  However changing the settings to \"Standard\" does wash out some colors (such as BRIGHT whites and yellows), however I find this to be an acceptable trade-off.1 - Auto Dimming - Apparently the TV will automatically change the gamma settings when the TV switches to a really dark picture.  This causes the TV to go too dark for a second, then brighten back up.  I have only seen this once or twice and it hasn't bothered me too bad.  Apparently there is a fix for this (WHICH I HAVE NOT TRIED AND CAN NOT ENDORSE). ***With the TV off, push Mute, 1, 8, 2, Power. Scroll to \"Advanced\", press 0000 - don't hit enter. Scroll (down arrow) to CE Dimming and hit Enter. Select Movie or Standard, and hit the left or right arrow to switch it off. Done, hit power. Turn on the TV like you normally would and Auto-dimming is now off***If it weren't for the uneven lighting this would be a perfect TV.

I selected this to replace my perfectly functional three year old Samsung 50\" DLP.  I am disappointed at how much of the low light scenes are missing (just black areas on the screen) and I am also disappointed in how frequently there are blurred images during high speed and high contrast scenes.  Bright vivid scenery is without question far more brilliant on this TV than my DLP but for this price I expected less noticeable shortcomings in comparison to the  DLP technology which has lost its market share.", "Date": "May 10, 2010"}, {"Title": "Very Good", "Author": "buyer80 \"stl\"", "ReviewID": "R19DF0QRY5JK22", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I am extremely happy with the Samsung 6000.  Very cool look on the wall and wonderful picture.  It was easy to hang as well, I made my own suspension system with parts from the local big box home store.  I run the audio through a receiver, so I cant comment on the \"problem\" with the poor sound of the Samsung.  There are couple \"points of interest\" that I have with this set:#1.  At times, the picture is a bit too clear.  The motion flow can create a picture that is almost too good at times.  This, however, is not a problem, just an observation.#2.  You can see some bright spots in the periphery of the screen when its completely black.  It looks as if a few of the LED lights are too bright.  Once again, not really a problem, unless you watch a completely black screen all the time.#3.  This set does not auto format the picture to the input of the picture size.  This is only a problem if you switch between HD feed and analog feed.  I do this frequently, so it is a bit of an issue, having to adjust the picture size constantly.#4.  On certain channels, you will get flickering white bars at the top of the picture.  I have not isolated when this happens, however it is associated with #3,,,,,not having the correct size ratio based on the picture feed.Overall, great bang for buck.  Very happy.", "Date": "November 28, 2009"}, {"Title": "Fantastic LED 55-inch HDTV", "Author": "Opa", "ReviewID": "R13PWD6EWJKX1G", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "A great television at a great Amazon price!This television is the ultimate for picture quality and performance.We have a LCD Samsung 52inch but this unit cannot compete with the LED version.One will never regret to purchase the LED Samsung 55inch unit!!!", "Date": "November 24, 2009"}, {"Title": "Don't buy!", "Author": "H.

I don't know if it will go away tomorrow. Very annoying! I searched online about \"samsung tv the volume goes automatically to zero\" and found a lot of people had the same issue.
