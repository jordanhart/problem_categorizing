I especially liked how I could play movies from my own hard drive through one of the USB ports.  This is a BIG BALD-FACED LIE!!!  Here is the description of the TV from the manufacturer's site, Majestic-global.us:The USB input provides two functions, one as a Multi Media input so you can simply plug in your portable hard drive with all your photos and music then TV will access all your files and playback whatever you choose (it will not playback movies).Here is the description from Amazon:The USB input provides two functions one as a Multi Media input so you can simply plug in your portable hard drive with all your movies and music and the TV will access all your files and playback whatever you choose.Note the discrepancy between the two descriptions in regard to playing your own movies.  I made the seller aware of the error and they offered to refund my $$. However, please note they are still advertising it incorrectly.Other than this, I am glad I sprung for this TV. I don't worry about draining my RV battery and for a non-HD TV it suits my needs.", "Date": "January 29, 2013"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "$499.00", "Features": "Voltage - Input Range (Volts) 12V\nResolution (VxH) 1366 x 768\nWaterproof Rating NONE\nHD Ready NONE\nBrightness (Nits) NONE", "Name": "Majestic Global Usa Majestic 18.5\" Led Tv 12v W/dvd Player - Atsc Version F/usa", "ImgURL": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/31p8LO--WOL._SY300_.jpg", "ProductID": "B005G20RGE"}}
