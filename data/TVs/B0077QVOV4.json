Gesture control and Voice Control takes some time to get used to...it's not as sensitive as the Wii or like-devices. Other than the bells and whistles that you're basically paying for, there is one major drawback that I'm having a heck of a time fixing/figuring out (because Samsung customer support is convinced it's user-error; which it could very well be...but as a warning to others please read on): major networking issues.I have it hooked up to my home network and all seems great in terms of playing vides/music/pictures via router, however, the TV's firmware wants to constantly update and stay connected, thus it automatically shuts off randomly and turns back on; no matter what input you have the TV on. A major annoyance. I unhooked it from my home network and all is fine now, just sucks that I can't enjoy one of the major reasons why I bought the TV. So be warned if you're buying this TV for not just the great picture but for the versatility of using it as an extension to your home network.", "Date": "April 30, 2012"}, {"Title": "This TV has it all and looks stunning", "Author": "J.

I think the picture quality is stellar, I don't see any of the bleeding/cloudyness etc that I hear people complain about.  I did need to tweak the judder and blur reduction settings so movies didn't lose their depth of field, but overall this TV is amazing... I would highly recommend this to anyone!  When I was at the store I looked at the ES8000 also, but honestly I couldn't see a difference in PQ... I guess the 8000 has micro uber dimming or something, but to me the 7500 has it all anyways, so I'm stoked....Voice control is awesome, touch remote takes some getting used to, but is very cool, and the TV is sooo sexy...  I'll try to take a picture or two and upload them for others to see...Only bad note, the gesture control doesn't really work (but I didn't care about that feature)....oh that the whole thing with Amazon VOD still stinks, but hey I think this is the best TV you can buy for under $3000....3/23 Update.... I've added a photo for you to see... Its not the best, but I can you that unless you have the brightness blown out on the screen, there is no bleeding from the corners, which is the complaint I read about all the time.... maybe other folks like it brighter than me, but whatever, its an awesome screen!3/25 Update.... Watched Tron 3d (or part of it).... WOW!!! The 3D on the Tv is as good or better than cinema 3d....  I only watched 20 minutes or so, but I did not feel eye strain setting in... in fact over time it felt like I was just watching my tv normally, like the 3d was supposed to be there all the time.  On a sad note, I had to turn off the voice control, because the tv was taking commands from its own programming... :)  it almost turned itself off while I was watching Amazing Race for some reason.... got all the way to the final \"OK\" before I scrambled for the remote and canceled.... maybe that needs some work still...but the picture quality is shockingly good.", "Date": "March 21, 2012"}, {"Title": "TRULY AWSOME TV!!", "Author": "S. Teal \"tech addict\"", "ReviewID": "R172YJWMVTVU17", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "i have owned this tv for 1 and 1/2 weeks now and i have to say i love it. the picture quality is unbelievable. i replaced a toshiba 52 inch 4 thousand dollar tv, which 4 years ago when bought was top of the line. i thought i was watching a great picture,which i was, but this tv puts it to shame. i agree with some of the reviews i have seen that say, the picture is so sharp that it almost looks like it was shot on video instead of film. looks awsome. i have had no problem with light bleeding in from the edges or any other picture problems at all. i have watched the tv in a totally dark room with a very dark image on the screen to test for light bleeding and none seen at all. the 3d looks amazing on movies and my ps3 video games,even the 2d to 3d conversion looks pretty good. blu-ray movies look unbelievable. even older tv shows shot in th 4:3 aspect ratio look very good on hi def channel and non hi-def channels. the tv seems to process these programs very well. the gesture control does need improvement. my room is fairly well lit and during set up it says it still does not have enough light, yet when i use the skype app, the camera looks very good and bright in the same lighting, so they need to work on this. the voice control works well with the smart remote but just to talk to tv without the remote it seems to struggle to hear me. not a big problem because i use the remote any way. to me it is just a feature to show off tech to your friends any way. also if you have your tv on and they say something on tv that sounds like a command it brings up the voice control menu. it has happened 4 times to me, so at this time i just have the voice control off. i was also surprised that the sound from the tv speakers sound as good as they do, being that the tv is so slim. but they actually sound very good. so based on picture quality and the 3d quality and tv styling (it looks so cool and slim) and the ability to upgrade with the evolution kit(in the future) i have to give 5 stars. hopefully in future updates they will be able to improve the voice and gesture controls. and if not, its still a great tv that i would highly recommend.", "Date": "April 7, 2012"}, {"Title": "Awesome TV", "Author": "Aaron", "ReviewID": "R111P5GE5MSJQY", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I Love this TV, Great picture quality and when paired with a 3D Blue ray player the results are nothing short of amazing. better than at a movie theater. However, the interactive functions aren't that great. voice recognition works randomly and the motion interactive function only activates at random as well. the facial recognition works instantly and is a nice touch to by pass a bunch of log in stuff. Picture quality has vivid and brilliant colors and the screen has deep blacks too thanks to the film on the screen. the smart functionsapps are useful and I use the netflicks app with a cable modem to stream movies effortlessly via WIFI. The sound seems really diminished when you are watching movies from netflicks so I got an optical audio cable and hooked the TV up to the surround sound which solved the problem. The Netflicks picture quality is superb probably because I spent some good money to buy the top of the line Netgear WIFI Router that delivers a ton of Bandwidth. If you are planning on using the TV'S WIFI internet access I highly recommend getting a good router if you plan on streaming movies. The shipping service that Amazon uses Home Direct is great. they were courteous and the TV arrived undamaged and exactly the way you would want it.

Somehow, I stumbled upon this beauty. I didn't need a new TV. My 3 year old 46-inch Samsung LCD was still producing wonderful images. BUT...THIS...was just so pretty AND came with a free 32-inch. So, I decided at that point that my mother could use a new TV as well. I gifted her my old unit, hooked my sister up with the smaller box, and set this bad boy up in my bedroom.PROs:Simply put, it is amazing. Everything that can be said about this set has absolutely been said, but I'll add a tad more: the range at which you can customize the image detail is exhausting -- in a good way. Each source has its own image settings, which is great for me because the settings for my satellite programs greatly differ from my blu-ray and video game settings.Before I saw with my own eyes, I wasn't completely convinced that at-home 3D would be immersing at all. Boy was I wrong. This display does 3D very well and I have stocked up heavily on 3D blu-rays as a result. The Smart TV Center is also a pretty cool feature, allowing you to access Hulu, Amazon, YouTube and Netflix, among a host of other applications. The set also features Voice Navigation, which I absolutely love using while I amble about the room doing crap.CONs:The worst thing about this set is the Gesture Control. It works, but it feels like a job, so I never use it. Kinect it is not. Also, the sound could use a little boost, but mostly it is fine.This TV is almost perfect. Without the gimmicky Gesture Controls, it would be perfect, but turn them off and BOOM: 5 Stars.", "Date": "December 27, 2012"}, {"Title": "Not Bad, but has noticable backlight bleedthrough when viewing dark scenes.", "Author": "James", "ReviewID": "RFOXTK8A25NOR", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "Well, I really wanted to love this TV.  It looks great in normal daylight viewing conditions, the colors are very bright and vibrant and the picture is crisp and clear.  If I only wanted to use this TV for daylight viewing, I would give it 5 stars.  But, like other edge-lit TVs (or so I have read), this TV has noticeable back-light bleed through when viewing a dark scene in a darkened viewing environment.  It looks like light grey clouds in certain parts of the screen, and can be seen whenever the scene is very dark (ie night scenes in movies etc).  Adjusting the backlight makes the problem slightly less noticeable, but does not fix it completely.  It is more noticeable with some movies than others.  For example, if you are watching Finding Nemo, the colors are so bright that you probably won't notice the bleed through a single time in the entire movie.  But, if you are watching V for Vendetta, it will be noticeable in many of the dark scenes, every 2 or three minutes you will notice the gray splotches.  I really like the TV, but I have to return it because if I spend over $2k on a TV it needs to be PERFECT, and sadly this back light issue is just something I don't want to have to deal with when watching dark movies.  On a side note, the 3D on this TV is INCREDIBLE - the best 3D I have ever seen EVER (WAY better than the movie theatre).  There is almost no 'ghosting' like you see in a movie theatre, it's really impressive.  Note that in order to get the real 3D experience, you will need to watch a 3D blu-ray.  Samsung has some example 3d videos in the smart hub that will stream over your network, but they truly look like crap compared to a 3D blu-ray (I suggest watching Tron 3D - absolutely stunning).  Plus when you are watching a 3D movie the glasses act like sunglasses and dim the picture slightly which resolves the backlight uniformity issue to some extent.Pros:Fantastic picture when viewed in a bright roomShockingly good 3D (when viewing 3D blu-rays)Sleek, sexy design (very thin bezel, beautiful TV overall)Voice controls work decently wellCons:Terrible backlight bleedthrough when viewing dark content in a dark room. (a dealbreaker for me - the other cons are just slight inconveniences)Motion control is activated sometimes by accident - usually once per movie which can be annoying, but you can turn motion control off if you want to fix this.I have noticed an occasional jutter in the picture when motion-smoothing is turned on.  They are pretty infrequent (once every 20 minutes?), and only occur for a fraction of a second, but they are noticeable if you are paying attention.Edit: posted pictures that show backlight bleedthrough", "Date": "November 19, 2012"}, {"Title": "Great TV!!", "Author": "Alex", "ReviewID": "R3A1KOR0H4Y5DR", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I bought this TV after reading reviews - happy I did!

Here are my issues with it:1. Smart Remote - the touch pad on this thing was very fickle.  Half the time it wouldn't respond properly to my touch and I soon gave up using it, returning to use the regular remote.2. Regular Remote - sometimes the TV stopped responding to the remote control, even volume up/down, and I had to turn the TV off and back on again to get it to work.  (I did check that it was not a battery issue).3. Gesture control - what a gimmick!  You have to wave your hand in the air for about a minute before you can get the TV to see it, and then it keeps losing track of it.  Sure, controlling Angry Birds with hand gestures is fun, until the novelty wears off or your hand gets tired (which happens very quickly when you are holding your arm in the air), but as a way of operating the TV it's useless.4. Voice control - again, another useless gimmick, because most of the time it didn't work.5. Media streaming from my PC - the TV would lose connection with my Windows 7 PC after a few minutes of watching a video and the only way to get it working again was to turn the TV off and on, then repeatedly hit 'refresh' in the source list until it saw the PC again.  And then, it stopped working again a few minutes later.  It happened both wired and wireless.  I then tried sharing via Samsung's Allshare app for the PC.  This would, like clockwork, disconnect after 15 minutes - I timed it and it happened 4 times in a row.  I contacted Samsung support and - after the usual nonsense of resetting the TV settings and uninstalling and reinstalling Allshare on my PC (like that would help!) - I was told that the software was \"not compatible\" with 64 bit Windows and the solution was to use a PC with 32 bit Windows.  Note there is NO mention on the Samsung allshare download page about this incompatibility - it lists \"Windows 7\" with no mention of 32 or 64 bit.  (For the record, I have no other issues with streaming to other devices in my home network).6. The user interface in general is poorly designed, both on the remote control itself and in the SMART TV screen.  It's difficult to put this into words, it just feels clunky and poorly laid out.  The internet browser is just awful and unusable.  I didn't like the way that once you are in an app you can't have a PIP of what you were watching before - you only get the PIP on the main SMART TV menu page.7. Using any app which required typing was such a drag that I could not be bothered to use it, and I wasn't prepared to pay another $100 for a keyboard.8. Skype - admittedly, this was quite cool, talking to a life-sized version of someone (but rather pixelated) as though they were sitting on the couch opposite you.  However, the people on the other end kept reporting that my camera was zooming in and out by itself.  It seems like it was attempting to do some sort of face tracking, but badly.9. [This was the final straw] The sound from the speakers caused the plastic panel on the back of the TV to reverberate extremely noisily making the sound seem distorted - you could put your hand on it and feel the vibrations.  I was watching the movie Crash, and virtually the whole way through, the background music was causing it to happen.  Sure, I could get a sound bar, but I'm not spending another $100-300 on top of this.Bottom line is, I spent a lot of money on this TV thinking it would cover all my needs perfectly.  It certainly looks nice, but I decided to return it and get the VIZIO E601-A3 60-inch instead (which for 5\" more is half the price) and so far I'm not regretting it.  The fancy features of this Samsung just weren't worth the extra $1000 or so.Kudos to Amazon though for the return service and very quick refund.", "Date": "November 2, 2012"}, {"Title": "Best Led out there, Buy this tv for picture quality not the apps", "Author": "Jkem", "ReviewID": "R38ZJAL9CVF2MY", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I bought this tv for its incredible picture quality , apps dont really matter to me. im coming from a LG 120hz and i must say the picture is by far better than that and or any other led i have seen, 3d is awesome , 2d to 3d isnt as deep as i thought it would be but i was execpting alot , the motion control is awful, the voice commands work alot better than i thought, almost perfect, and GREAT APPS, I bought this tv because i wanted a led tv with the best picture quality and i feel i made the right decison , this is as close as you can get to a plasma, with out having to worry about burn outs and such, this is a great tv and i would recommend it to any oneBUY THIS TV BECAUSE YOU WANT AMAZING PICTURE QUALITY , NOT BECAUSE YOU LIKE THE APPS OR MOTION CONTROL.", "Date": "August 17, 2012"}, {"Title": "4.5 out of 5", "Author": "mnav8tr", "ReviewID": "RA7N1637FEXTQ", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "No manual or CD included in the box to guide setup and operation, which made the setup frustrating and time consuming.

The WiFi and wireless keyboard works well, but the keyboard is a little too small in size for my liking, but it is weighted well and imparts a solid feel. Haven't had time to play with the 3D yet, so can't comment on the 3D operation or quality.

We've been very satisfied with this set and it has worked flawlessly. The picture is so good, that it is very easy to distinguish the broadcast quality between 1080i and 720i, as well as 1080i to 1080i channel variances and the various quality of satellite channels. The wireless Internet works great, and we have not encountered any buffering issues. After accessing the Internet, we downloaded the product manual, so this is no longer an issue.We finally bought a couple of 3D movies and are very happy with the 3D viewing.

Fortunately, the answer to that question was yes and before my wife could object, I had a new Samsung. I couldn't be happier and she, to my surprise, has latched onto the feature I thought would be least appealing-3D.First things first.Why Samsung? Consumers Reports highly recommends that any major widescreen television be actually manufactured by the company whose brand is on the set. Lots of cheaper sets are made by assemblers-marketers who create a brand and then order product (assembled or otherwise) from obscure factories in China or India. They look great at first blush, but they are able to sell them cheaply because they are made on the cheap.The two best manufacturers who sell under their own names are LG and Samsung. Not far behind are Toshiba, Panasonic and Sony. But let's face it, when was the last time you got really enthusiastic about any television from Sony? 1985? The quality and image has slipped. Samsung by contrast is spiraling upward like a Hail Mary pass from RGIII to the end zone. Even my beloved Apple has upped its own game to compete with the Korean juggernaut. Had Apple come out with its much anticipated Apple TV, I would be reviewing it, damn the cost.But Apple didn't make the big announcement and so for my money, this Samsung smart tv.So for features-Display is terrific. The active 3D display is even more terrific, a quality that has forced the acquisition of a whole lot of Blu-Ray 3D titles. four pair of active 3D glasses are included and I recently ordered at very prices a whole bunch of Maxell Lithium 3V Batteries Size CR2025 (Pack of 5). I am not planning on late night trips to CVS, but they do sell them there.Sound output has been an issue, but not for lack of component quality. The 55 inch screen just barely squeezes into our cabinet. the speakers are mounted on the back for aesthetic reasons. This means it is projected to the back of the cabinet and is muffled by the shear dimensions of unit within the cabinet. We solved this by acquiring a Yamaha YAS-101BL Front Surround System, Piano Black and connecting it by two BlueRigger Digital Optical Audio Toslink Cable(10 feet) to the optical audio outputs on the Directv box and our new LG BP325W WiFi 3D Ready Blu-ray Player. No amp is necessary and the sound quality suddenly became amazing.This is a smart tv which means it is basically an integrated computer rather than just a dumb monitor. Samsung has lots of apps as well as a web browser. We just use Netflix and Amazon Prime Instant video. Facebook at 55 inches seems a bit much. Hulu is also an option.Now if only the Superbowl was in 3D it would be as amazing as this smart tv.", "Date": "January 28, 2013"}, {"Title": "Good TV, BUT", "Author": "Robert Batey", "ReviewID": "R1NRZLEYO457WE", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "The TV performs well and picture quality is great.

I turned these off mainly because I use this TV as my computer monitor. The TV itself is hands down the best looking I've ever seen - this of course without the TV itself being turned on. It's really strikingly beautiful and you can't appreciate the thinness of this TV until you see it up close. The almost lack of a screen bezel makes the screen appear even bigger.I didn't see any back-light bleed through and was a little concerned after reading one review here. The screen itself looks like glass - unlike traditional screens that I'm accustomed to. Again no bleed-through whatsoever even in a dark room.I popped in Tangled 3D and I'll just say W O W. You'll never watch TV the same again. Honestly I can't describe how utterly amazing coming from a 42\" to this monster. I liken it to having a Lamborghini sitting in your room.The menus/remote are easy enough to fumble your way through and setting up to my computer through HDMI 1 was a breeze.The stand was also very simple with 8 screws. The only issue seemed to be wondering which way the base sits when attaching the part that connects to the set itself. But that was figured out quickly.For $ 2,000,00 with 24 month no interest through the Amazon store card it's a deal I just couldn't say no to and I certainly aren't concerned with buyer's remorse with this purchase!UPDATE: 12/31/12  I'm still in love. Had a little issue with getting 3D on after connecting to my video card. I have a GTX 670 Nvidia with DVI out. I had to go into Nvidia's control panel in windows to setup stereoscopic 3D before being able to play 3D on this TV. I wasn't seeing anything so run this Nvida setup and make sure your glasses are connected to your TV (Push the little button on top until you see a flash of green). I was then also able to set resolution of the TV to '1080p 3D' in windows.It's also important to set black levels through the menu (HDMI blackness level)For some reason anything other that set to 'movie' makes my computer desktop look bad.This also goes for playing World of Warcraft.The 3D on this TV is really something to behold. I'm not getting 'use to' it in the sense of it getting old. I can't watch TV any other way without feeling underwhelmed.Also make sure to rename HDMI1 to PC or PC DVI in tools.I wish there was some manual for 3D+Glasses setup because you have to figure it all out on your own. For the glasses you simply push the little button on the top and they should flash green. If you're already in the movie you should see a popup. But either way you'll KNOW when it's 3D. Depending on your Blu-ray software (mine's power DVD 10) you'll also need to enable 3D through that.UPDATE#2: Purchased Samsung's 7.1 surround sound home theater. So easy to setup.

Overall if you are looking for a smart t.v. who's picture quality will continue to blow you away use after use than this is the t.v. for you. Buy it you wont regret it.As for compatability issues. I bought this along with the samsung hw450 soundbar and samsung 3d blueray player thinking they would all sync up seemlessly. The blueray player has no issues and can be cotrolled easily from one one remote. As for the soundbar; there are a couple of ways to get it work with the t.v. Many users have a hard time getting it to turn on/off and control volume from the t.v. remote. The easiest way to do this is as follows.1) Connect soundbar to t.v. via hdmi from (hdmi out) on soundbar to (hdmi 2) on t.v. ( also known as A.R.C. (audio return channel)2) turn Anynet+ (On) on soundbar using provided remote3) in t.v. settings turn anynet+ (On)  Receiver (On)  Auto off= (No)If you are connecting the two devices using an HDMI cord than this is the only setup that I have found that works. You can also use an optical cable along with your HDMI cord or alone as your sole connection between the two devices. I have opted to use both just for sake of not pulling the optical cord back out of the wall. I recently purchased a Logitech 650 wireless remote to simplify all devices even more.  This thing is almost as cool as the t.v. Itself. It is around $60 and well worth the money. It is very easy to set up and even easier to use.

Please research before you buy and watch out!!!!UPDATE:Samsung technician came and fixed the TV. When the TV was opened by technician it was found that the Wifi module was tampered with and bound together by tape. Technician is of the opinion that this *NEW* TV was tampered with before sale. Now this really blows me away as I bought this item as NEW but the part installed in the tv has been tampered with. How can it be NEW if it has already been tampered with???Contacted Amazon to get this TV replaced and they are not agreeing to replace this free of charge as it is out of the 90 days window. How can that apply to this case? Its not my fault that Amazon gave me a TV that was used/tampered with, when I ordered a NEW TV. This is ridiculous!!!!!!!

The picture quality is great when watching HD content. The image almost looks real, sorta like computer graphics. Hard to explain unless you physically see it. The motion feature I really dont use, however it requires your room to be well lit to see gestures and I dont intend to watch a movie with bright lights in the room. The gestures did not work with a medium lit room. The motion/speech remote that comes with this seems buggy and clumsy.

My house is all CAT 6, Router is Giga LAN, and all my movies sit on a NAS with Giga LAN as well. Plex on the TV took forever to get movie posters. Not all my movies had posters. Then there was no Metadata Scrapping. So no movie info would show when you highlight the movie. Streaming was horrible with 1080/3D content. 720p was fine. So I went back to the set top box for DLNA content. I built an XBMC HTPC on an Intel NUC. Other than that, it has a great image. Also, Samsung has introduced what they call Evolution Kits.

Often, I will let a few negative reviews sway my decision over a majority of positive reviews. Although each individuals experience may differ. With that stated, I decided to pull the trigger on this samsung un55es7500.  Shipping was quick - but that is expected as I'm a prime member. The TV is light, with respect to weight and it is very thin. It didn't take long at all to set up and the process was very user friendly. The only problems I had during initial set up was with the voice control test and the universal remote set up (more on these later). Installing the stand on this unit was \"idiot proof\" and could be done without reading the instructions but following the illustrations.  I had the TV up and running in about 30-35 minutes including set up but that included the seemingly impossible to complete voice control test. I purchased this tv for my wife so I had her do the voice test; however, neither of us could complete the test as the TV was unable to register either of our voices. As such, we skipped that part to return to it later. Well, as it turns out, we didn't need to complete that part because the TV responds to both of our voices. It is so cool to say to your tv; \"hi tv, power on - and the antithesis, \"goodbye tv, power off\", and have the unit power on and off respectively. The gesture control camera worked fine for my wife as well. I haven't tried it myself though.  I also like the smart remote and its \"universal\" functionality. It was a little tricky to set up after pairing with the TV, but once I set it up, the true awesomeness of this TV and smart remote were on full display. It does take some time to get use to though, but I suspect that one could reach 80% acclimation with this remote in a day or so. The GUI that appears on the screen when using this remote is crazy (slang for good).  The picture quality is very good on this set, but that's to be expected. I have a sony bravia with xreality feature that may be slightly better or slightly inferior depending on the observer. There is one thing I don't like about the TV and that is, on the right side of the tv screen there appears to be a four circular spots that form a square on that can be seen in a high light setting such as when the sun is shinning on it however, reducing the sunlight removes this issue.  If you're considering this tv you should go for it. I gave it five stars for the pros and removed a star for the cons which are as followed:Pros: good picture quality (haven't watched 3d as of this review)  Built in wireless which connected with ease to my network without wires or an adapter.  Smart functions which are awesome and the GUI is phenomenal. the wall paper is even changeable and may even be customizable .  The smart remote and its universal capabilities are neat also.  There are a few other pros to this TV but I won't list them all.Cons:The rainbow spots that appear in direct sunlight  The voice control test  and another con that I didn't mention above, amazon offered a $200 gift card with the purchase of this tv; however, it made getting the gift card very difficult. In fact, I lost out on the gift card because I didn't know that I was supposed to add the gift card to the card then put in a promo code. I saw the promo code for the gift card and I used it at check out at which time my cart reflected a $200 discount. However as it were, the discount didn't apply. I called amazon about this and a representative told me \"my hands are tied, we don't/can't applied discounts retroactively.\" Had the discount not been reflected in my cart, I wouldn't have purchased the TV until I was certain as to how to acquire the $200 gift card.", "Date": "December 10, 2012"}, {"Title": "So far so good w/ the second unit.", "Author": "A.

After the one year warranty period SAMSUNG Television screens tend to show burn-in and ghosting with horizontal lines, along with very heavy distortion of picture on right side of screen.  This problem is systemic in all their LCD's and LED's.  Consumer's have complained all over the internet.  There are even numerous Youtube postings with the exact same problems as in my DEFECTIVE SAMSUNG model, as well as the same DEFECT in other models.  This defect occurs upon start-up, and lasts for the first 15 minutes of trying to view a program. Then the picture gets progressively worse over time and continuously declines.I tried SAMSUNG's Executive Customer Relations Dept. and was told:  \"We will do nothing but refer you to a local Authorized Repair Shop.\"  They were downright blunt and rude to boot!  I feel robbed of $2,900.00The repair will consist of a diagnosis visit, and then another visit to install a replacement \"Panel\" that costs $1,300.00 for the part plus $279.00 to install, plus taxes......all told, another $1,719.16....basically, buy another TV.SAMSUNG customer service also told me that their Televisions depreciate at 20% per year, and they do not repair any of their products after 4 years!  Their own repair people told me to just buy a new set!!!If I save one family the heartache of losing they're hard-earned money, I'll be happy!SAMSUNG CONS:No Customer SupportSystemic Panel DefectGhosting of imagesBurn-in on screenDistorted pictureVery expensive to repair", "Date": "November 29, 2013"}, {"Title": "exelente", "Author": "gabriel", "ReviewID": "R298M8I44ZE71S", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I love my led is the best and even more since I arrived on time and in perfect condition is excellent, my parents also loved this samsung led and are waiting for a good deal in the same company to buy it from the 7500 or 8000 ledare the best and likewise the seller", "Date": "April 21, 2013"}, {"Title": "OK, But", "Author": "DBrown", "ReviewID": "RKKGDOXCXVAGO", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "The TV arrived and was unpacked by the shipper.

Samsung will ship me the missing bracket at no cost to me.  Problem is, I wont receive it for at least a week.  I contacted Amazon again to get a replacement and was told that they would ship me a replacement, but I wouldn't get it for at least a week.
