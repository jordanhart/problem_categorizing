{"Reviews": [{"Title": "My first HDTV, no regrets", "Author": "JC \"jeffhcb\"", "ReviewID": "RBOAWADAJDYFA", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "After 4+ months, TV still rocks.  Though I'm somewhat hampered by Time Warner HD, with an abysmal selection of channels, I'm still very happy with my purchase.  The only thing I've had any second thoughts about is whether I should have sprung for the Elite, at about a grand more.  Pioneer kind of screws the consumer this year with the base line Kuro (6020 and 5020) as they remove all of the second level of picture adjustments).  But still the TVs performance is terrific.  I have, however, had the gray scale professionally calibrated.  It cost me a few hundred bucks and you need to make sure the person who is doing it has the appropriate software and has done a few of these before.  And while the results are subtle, I can notice them.  There is an improvement. Can only be done in movie mode, but improves the gray-scale and colors to some extent too.  It just creates a more natural tone to the picture and removes a bit of the \"haze\" or \"reddish/yellow tint\" as I like to call it.  Well worth it if u can find a good technician**************************************************************************I have been researching HDTVs for what seems like forever, until this month when I finally pulled the trigger.  You cannot go wrong with this TV.  This is my first HDTV, but I consider myself fairly tech savvy and somewhat of an audiophile.  That said I don't have any history with HDTVs so can't compare this TV with anything I've owned in the past, but rather friends' TVs or in store comparisons.The negatives on this TV are as some may have already discovered; an inability to more finely calibrate this TV yourself, unlike the 5080 of last year or the Elites.  That was kind of a downer given how much you pay for it.  On the flip side, if you have it calibrated, I believe the professional can adjust these settings.  Not 100% sure yet, but I may give that a shot at some point.  Why would you want to adjust these settings at all from the way they come out of the box?  Well, according to a few reviews, as well as the CNET review, Reds and Greens are not 100% accurate.  This may be difficult to determine through the naked eye of most viewers.  But I can say that Reds appear a little heavy to me.  Greens look fairly accurate to me, but again according to CNET they were off a bit too.  We are not talking about anything that is a deal breaker here by any stretch.  Ask someone with an untrained eye and they'd probably wonder what the heck you're talking about.  Anyway these are about the only negatives about this TV that I can find, if you consider them \"negatives.\"  Assuming you have it calibrated, then there are NO negatives to this TV.Positives are many.  Outstanding picture quality, and probably the best SD picture you can find or have ever found from an HDTV.  Far better than what I've seen on any LCD thats for sure.  DVDs scaled to fit this picture look almost HD.  HDTV content is outstanding.  You cannot find better black levels.  The Panasonics have really improved their sets, but still the Pioneers are better, you can see the difference even if it is subtle.Another thing to note, when I first got this TV, for the first week or so, I was worried that the picture was just a little dark.  Plasma is definitely darker than LCD, and I thought hey, you can't have the best blacks and brightness all in one TV right?  True, sort of.  What you need to do after a break-in period (I have no idea whether break-in is even necesary on plasmas anymore, but some do) is set the TV to Movie Mode, then calibrate from there.  Movie mode produces a brighter picture.  I think most people are so accustomed to a super-bright set (read: LCDs) that produce very inaccurate pictures and tones that Movie mode might look dull to them at first.  Your eyes will adjust, trust me.  And you will slowly realize that once calibrated, the Pioneer produces a picture that is about as close to a movie theater screen as you can get.Once in movie mode, use the following settings:Contrast: 38Brightness: -1Color: -5Tint: 0Sharpness: -15Pure CinemaFilm Mode: AdvanceText Optimization: OffPower Save Mode: OffOrbiter: Mode 1 (All screen size modes except Dot-by-Dot)Mode 2 (Dot-by-Dot screen size mode ONLY)Feel free to tweak from there as you feel necessary.  But that is the so-called reference setting; I assume what a technician would set to produce the most accurate picture.Once you're set in this, again, give it some time for your eyes to adjust to it, and you will see a truly outstanding real to life image.  Film content is about as close to a move screen as you will get in my opinion.Other cool features are 1)An optical output for audio 2.)Home networking feature to display Videos and Pictures from your PC right on your plasma.  This works very well and is pretty intuitive. 3.) Great sound right out of the factory speaker.  4.)A very nice stand that is already attached.I was recently in a Best Buy and looked at the new Panasonics, which are very good, side by side with the Pioneers.  But I still think the Pioneer produces a better picture overall.  I haven't seen a calibrated Panny, so not a perfectly fair assessment.Hope this helps, good luck!", "Date": "July 26, 2008"}, {"Title": "Pioneer 5020 is the best!!!", "Author": "M. Kang \"El Tiger\"", "ReviewID": "R19GI0MJTWUDDD", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Just got my 5020 last week and this is the best TV that I have seen. I did a lot of research at high end stores and the side by side comparisons with the older 5010 model vs. any other tv (lcd or plasma) wasn't even close.  I was looking at the newest Samsung plasmas and LCD's (Toc) but the black levels on the Pioneer really made a big difference. I even asked my 10 year old son to pick the tv with the best picture and he chose the Pioneer. I really wanted to buy the Samsung LCD (Toc) but couldn't get myself to do it knowing the Pioneer's picture was better. I think I would have regretted it later.The 5020 is thinner than the 5010 and has the newest HDMI 1.3a inputs. I hooked this TV to a brand new Onkyo 606 which is HDMI 1.3a compliant, Time Warner DVR, and a PS3. All I needed was 3 HDMI cables for the entire system.This TV has the best black levels i have seen which makes the colors really pop and gives more depth to the picture. The TV makes the high def content more 3 dimensional. At this price, you can't go wrong with this plasma. In addition, this will be the last year that Pioneer makes their own screens.", "Date": "July 2, 2008"}, {"Title": "Great choice for videophiles that aren't video-nuts!", "Author": "RonH", "ReviewID": "RVIIGNIWN6CBJ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I looked for around 6 months for a new HDTV to replace a Sony XBR1 40\" I've had for several years.  After spending way to much time reading CNETs reviews, I settled upon this TV.The performance is excellent.  It certainly has better image quality than my Sony LCD, both when watching movies (due to the excellent contrast), and when watching fast moving basketball, in which my sony LCD would occasionally have motion artifacts.  I think much of the LCD motion artifact thing has gone away with high end LCDs these days.If you are a video nut that wants to change every aspect of the settings, you need to get the elite model, which is basically the same TV, but with all the settings opened up.  You only get basic settings with this model.  However, it has a mode that I personally like called \"Optimum\", where the TVs sensors detect what type of picture is being displayed along with the ambient room conditions and adjust accordingly.  So far I've left it on that and it has been great.  I have also played with \"Movie\" mode, in which you get about 50% of the controls on the picture that a typical high end TV might have.Aesthetically, this TV looks perfect.  The plain back bezel that is very small for this size of TV is exactly what I was looking for.  Some of the Sony's for the past 4 years and most of the LGs and Samsungs have  just got too much going on.  I want a perfect picture and a minimal \"TV\".  In addition, this TV is very thin for a 50\" plasma, it is only 3.7\" thick.  My 40\" LCD was 5.5\" and the new sony XBR8 LED backlit LCD is almost 6\" I believe.In a store I compared this TV to the Samsung A950 series (LED backlit LCD) and the Sony XBR6, both 46\" models.  The Pioneer was cheaper and just looked better hands down.  I went back on 3 occasions to confirm this was the case.Some people will discuss buzzing with this particular unit.  From what I have found out, all plasmas buzz.  On this unit, if you put your head behind the tv, you can hear some electronic buzz.  If you put your head in front of the TV, you can not hear anything, even with the TV muted.  If you move your head about 5' back from the TV and have the TV muted, a slight buzzing becomes audible.  If you turn on any volume whatsoever, you can not detect the buzzing.  Actually, the fans and hard disk in my DirecTV HR21 DVR are louder than the buzzing!I have been using power save mode 2 (the highest power save mode), which makes it meet the energy star requirements of the future, and it has plenty of brightness!  We'll see how this holds up as we move through the break in period.The big question many of you are probably asking is should I order from amazon and save almost $1000 over best buy or other big box store?  My first HDTV I purchased from a locally owned specialty retailer.  It gave me the confidence I needed since I knew little about HDTVs at that time.  They offered a 15 day no questions asked return policy.  For this Pioneer purchase, I went with amazon.com and saved $1000.  Shipping was free.  Amazon will contract this to CEVA, who will contract the delivery to your home by another local delivery agent.  My TV arrived within 3 business days.  It went from Ohio to Chicago in the first day I ordered it, and then was in Milwaukee to be delivered the next day and an appointment was set up.  However, when the delivery guys showed up, I asked them to remove it from the packaging so I could plug it in and make sure it worked before I accepted delivery.  The bezel was cracked and the screen damaged before we even got it out of the box.  So I easily refused shipment and the delivery guys took it back.  I contacted amazon and once you get beyond the india help desk and to a real agent who specializes in electronics returns I was all set.  A new unit was sent 3 days later (with a total of about 1 week delay) for no charge.  I think in the future I would order online from amazon.com again for the cost savings they provide.  Although it was a hassle to be at home twice to have the TV delivered twice it was worth the savings for me.  I believe you can also return  to amazon within 30 days as well if you change your mind, but shipping cost is yours to pay.", "Date": "November 1, 2008"}, {"Title": "You can't go wrong with a Pioneer 5020", "Author": "Mostafa Alattar", "ReviewID": "R1UHXJAJB9KZIC", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I could not be more satisfied with this television. Last year I bought a 42\" Vizio LCD for gaming because it was the only 42\" I could find under $1000. However, after upgrading my home theater audio with a new receiver/speakers and buying a PS3 to watch Blu-ray movies, I really discovered what a sour piece of hardware my screen was. When you've spent the cash for a new player and bought a bunch of your favorite movies in Blu-ray format, the last thing you want to see is unnatural looking skin tones, lack of detail in dark and bright scenes, and awful video processing and motion blur!I got fed up and decided to do my homework this time and prepare to spend what it takes to get a true quality display. I read several critical reviews and message boards which directed my attention to the Kuro line of Pioneer plasmas. I finally got a chance to see one at a local A/V store and absolutely fell in love. They had SportsCenter on in HD, doing an interview with Coach K from Duke, and the black backdrop was so dark and the colors so perfect that it looked like he was sitting across the room talking to us. A friend was with me and his reaction was \"Super Bowl at your place!\"No one can deny the black levels and contrast on this TV, and that's what makes watching it so great. If it's completely dark in the room, you can still tell that it's on, but when you've got a widescreen movie on and there are black bars on the top and bottom of the screen, you can barely make out where the screen stops and the bezel begins. Colors benefit from the depth and it creates a 3D image, and you don't miss anything because everything is so clear. This screen makes me want to watch all my Blu-rays over again because you really haven't watched high definition until you've watched it on a Pioneer.For anyone who is feeling gun-shy, just pull the trigger and don't look back. You will surely be satisfied!!", "Date": "July 12, 2008"}, {"Title": "Incredible!", "Author": "F. V.

My source is Dish HD via HDMI, and PS3.  I bought it without even seeing one in person, and I was not disappointed.  I haven't tweaked it one bit, just went through the different picture modes.  I started with the Herbie Hancock special I had from DISH - black grand piano and white sheet music - the details in the black were as good as I've seen ever, (over 30 years as TV producer/director).  The whites got a bit blown out in Dynamic Mode, but switching to Game mode looked incredible. I can't wait to fiddle with it tomorrow. Other impressions:  * No burn in that I can see - freezing on menu for a couple of minutes - nothing...  * Very minimal screen reflections  * With room light on - it truly is black when there is no picture on.  * In a blacked-out room you can see that it's on, (but I haven't tweaked it yet)  * I sat 4 feet away from BlueRay Ratatouille and thought about rearranging the furniture permanently - it's that nice.

My son, who is an audiophile, had been pushing me to take the plunge for some time. I visited him during the Christmas holidays and thoroughly enjoyed watching his 5020. I wrapped up my research including educating myself about plasma versus LCD and visiting showrooms to view the set. I became convinced that Pioneer's 5020 was the right one for me. I made one last visit to the showroom before making the purchase. After installation, I'm excited that I made the right decision.As I view and enjoy this outstanding video technology, I couldn't help but recall another personal experience. It was in 1947 on a visit to NYC that I had the opportunity visit the RCA Building and to see an early demonstration of TELEVISION. What excitement for this 17 yr. old. At 87+ yrs. old, the 5020 generates similar excitement. I'm looking forward to a few more years of viewing pleasure.", "Date": "January 15, 2009"}, {"Title": "Believe The Kuro Hype!

I ordered the TV on a Monday evening and I had the TV in my house on the Thursday of the same week. It was less than 72 hours from clicking the mouse to clicking the remote on the TV, which I find amazing. The TV was delivered by Eagle/CEVA and the delivery guys were very helpful in getting the TV into my 2nd floor bedroom.I chose the 5020 Kuro after an exhaustive search of what TV would be the best for my room. I read many websites and AV forums and found the only thing people could agree on is that the Pioneer Kuro's have the best black levels out there period. Sure the Kuro is a little more expensive than sets from Panasonic or Samsung but over the life span of the TV the difference in price is minimal. So I say go with the best and don't look back.", "Date": "July 24, 2008"}, {"Title": "Pioneer....The Undisputed King of Plasma HDTV!!!", "Author": "thetoyaddict \"thetoyaddict\"", "ReviewID": "R2ECOMZJV9W0QV", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Here is the truth, the whole truth and nothing but the truth.....according to my observations and general tests. I ordered this Pioneer plasma tv from Amazon on July 16th and promplty received it via CEVA trucking on July 18th. As soon as the delivery guys opened up the packaging and, to my immediate delight, I noticed that this plasma set comes with the stand pre-installed.  At this time, I do not have any intentions of putting this plasma set on the wall; for those of you who want to install it on the wall please keep this in mind as you will now have to take the plasma stand off - screws and all. The manual states that all PDP-5020 sets have the stand pre-installed.*This plasma set is replacing a Samsung 56 inch DLP**Let the fun times begin: After turning on this set, it was apparent that this Pioneer PDP-5020 is the real deal. The black level is so deep and dark that I was left speechless for quite a few minutes. I tuned in to Cinemax HD and watched The Heartbreak Kid for 10 minutes.....WOW,WOW,WOW! The colors (popped) and the deep contrast made for a spectacular viewing of this movie. Ben Stiller's black shirt was really pitch black and the views of the ocean looked so realistic I was beside myself. I switched between other HD satellite stations and was very pleased with the results.Next, I hooked up the PDP-5020 to my trusty Panasonic blu-ray BDMP-30 to check out some of my blu-ray movies. Since I was so impressed with the Satellite HD broadcasts, you can now imagine my excitement as I turned my attention to Blu-ray. I wanted to test out a few of the worst looking blu-rays I had: Tomb Raider (read the Amazon reviews), Stargate (the dark scenes), Black Hawk Down ( alot of film grain ), and Big Fish ( alot of film grain).Believe it or not, the Tomb Raider Blu ray looked fantastic on this plasma. There was hardly any film grain visible on this plasma set at all, as I only sit 8 feet away. I could not believe how good it looked - a solid 8 out of 10 for the blu-ray. The dark scenes in the movie Stargate were also excellent and it was easy to make out small details that were not present before (on my 56 DLP) - again hardly any film grain. My final tests were done on the Black Hawk Down BD, Big Fish BD and the dark, night scene on Rambo BD (2008).....Would you believe me if I told you that all 3 discs looked fantastic? Black Hawk and Big Fish showed no signs of film grain and the night scene in Rambo was so visible I could not believe my eyes. This is a true testament of how great Pioneer plasma screens are. I now have a hard time believing any negative blu ray reviews from the pros since most of them are not using Pioneer plasmas for their reviews.Xbox 360 and PS3 games all looked great on this screen. The deep colors and the deep black really make the games a pleasure to look at.In case you are wondering, I didn't do any type of calibration to this set. I truly believe that no adjustments need to be made to it. It looks that great out of the box. Again, the deep black contrast is the major selling point. The color of grass looks the way it does in your back yard, not the fluorescent green you see on other plasma tv's.Should you buy a Pioneer plasma set? Absolutely!!!  I can guarantee that you will be 100% satisfied with its performance and aesthetic appearance.Don't be fooled by all the other competitor's displays at the brick and mortar stores.....this plasma set is well worth every penny you spend on it. You will thank me for it!**UPDATE 7/23/08**  I contacted Pioneer Electronics today to ask about a future calibration and was informed that these non-Elite models are already calibrated by Pioneer techs prior to shipment from their facilities. So, there is no need to spend an additional $300+ on calibration services.", "Date": "July 22, 2008"}, {"Title": "my third KURO is terrific - they're all terrific !!", "Author": "Anthony L. Mueller", "ReviewID": "R1RE8TX6VUCAT0", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "background - My first HDTV in 2006: 40\" Sony Bravia LCD (good with faults), my parents bought a Panasonic plasma 3 months later (I knew THEN that plasma was MUCH better PQ) ... my second HDTV purchase was the NEWEST Pioneer, KURO 4280 (a finer, more satisfying PQ than the Panasonic) in the summer of 2007.  January 2008 I sold the Sony LCD and replaced that with a KURO 5080, a  larger version of my fabulous 42\".My Kuro 4280 became my parents second plasma in FEB '08 ... I purchased the ninth generation Pioneer plasma Kuro 5020 from InvisionDisplays for $1950 (same seller of my 5080, same price) DELIVERED and guaranteed satisfaction delivery prefect.  I also bought the 3 yr extended IN HOME warranty from CPS for the cost of $125.  4 yrs of warranty total.The 8G Kuro's were fabulous, amazing color, black levels, picture resolution for HD content is incredible.  MOST new buyers of HDTV are awestruck with their new purchase, the Pioneer plasma's take it to the next level.  The newest 5020 has slightly improved black level, thinner, EnergyStar rated, and a sleeker remote (good & bad).  A few manufacturer's come close with certain models, but the KURO is still king of PQ.  ALL of the AV press have made this claim the past 2-3 yrs.  If you're able to view one of these with the proper HD or BluRay set up - you'll understand what the hype is all about.  Of course the 5020 is 1080 compared to the older 5080 with 768 - this is a factor when you're within 5 feet of the display MAINLY, the finer details are revealed.  NONE of my Kuro's have ever buzzed, malfunctioned in any way or failed to display fabulous HD content, standard def on the DirecTV satellite looks very good too, but I rarely watch anything in SD any longer.  Some HD channels look superior to others, but that's a whole diff. issue (satellite provider upconvert signals, BIT rates, etc).The only negative I have for the new 5020 is that the user pic settings are not as expansive as the 8G Kuro's were (color TEMP can not be set by itself, these are set within the various AV selections for picture settings).The following settings I favor within the MOVIE mode:contrast:  38brightness: -1color: -4 (I prefer realistic color as opposed to over intense color)tint: R1sharpness:  -15film mode: Advancetext Optimization: Offorbiter: 2power save: offThe above are the extent of the pic settings on the 5020.  The greyscale can be PRO calibrated to perfection (I've read).  The serious videophiles go to this extreme for perfection.  Pioneer is one of few manufacturers that have displays that can be pro calibrated a near perfect greyscale - the Pio Elites can be calibrated to perfection.Plasmas do \"settle\" during the first few hundred hours. Right out of the box, the phosphors are at their very brightest and within a few hundred hours a bit of that initial brightness wears off and from then on, the image will be very stable.  I keep the contrast on low settings the first two weeks and leave the panel  ON viewing a true HD source  like HDNet all the time while I'm at home, this helps to help break in/settle the display (allowing all the pixels to \"fire\" or to break in).  Its not a big issue, but true, plasma's will look better after the first 100 hours or so.  Mine has hit THAT stage after six weeks (not much actual TV time here lately) and the 5020 is dazzling to view with the above settings.  This break in period is not required as a special \"chore\" for any plasma owner.  During the first few hundred hours, you may notice some image retention. This is very common with brand new plasmas. Image retention is when you switch to a different image (it's easiest to spot on an all black screen or an all white screen), but you still see a bit of an after image (a \"ghost\" image, if you will) from what ever you were just watching prior.  THINK of when you gaze at a light fixture/bulb for a few seconds, then look away.  The image of that light appears to retain in your view.  Image retention is rarely if ever permanent for any length of time.  Relax.Yes there is a master power switch on the bottom right (rear) when you initially set up this display (Pio even has an insert within the remotes plastic bag alerting this).  I've never used the speaker of this display, my home theater handles the audio chore.  It is a shame (?) that so many HDTV buyers were mis informed, under educated or mislead into buying LCD as the preferred HD display.  Plasma IS the best for motion resolution, view angles, black levels, color intensity and processing.  I could post link after link of professional reviews and articles to back up my claims (but Amazon won't allow links).  Pioneer has been rank #1 for years with their plasma's.Yes I am a plasma convert (and a Kuro owner three times now).  The shinny piano black bezel may be reflective in certain situations, but it is not an issue here.  I only needed to clean my Kuro display's once every few months of any finger prints.  USE a 100% cotton soft cloth or towel , slightly damp on edge of the cloth then buff clear.  NEVER use a paper towel or cleaner, swirl marks or smears MAY appear.  The plasma screen tends to produce heat moreso than a LCD display, that's the phosphor technology of a plasma display, your electric bill will not  increase from plasma viewing.  None of my Kuro's have ever buzzed or malfunctioned in any way.  I am not a gamer, I am a satellite HD subscriber.Owning a Kuro is not about the \"status\" of having the most awarded HDTV - THE state-of-the-art for video display, but it never hurts either.  Yes, proud Kuro owners tend to sound like a \"cult\" - I apologize sarcastically.The picture quality is #1.  YES Pioneer will be leaving the display biz by 2010.  Developing the KURO tech wasn't cheap. Pioneer was the plasma innovator for the past 10 years, The Pioneer engineers saw the SED prototype, and knew they had to compete- that lead to project KURO a few years ago. It became an instant success on the technology side, the press and buyers loved the displays, a new standard without peer. But the pricey KURO never captured enough of the publics dollar. The recession, mounting losses at Pioneer and the decision of Panasonic to delay their new plasma facility for months (they were to manufacture ONLY the 10g KURO glass) was the final straw. No 10g KURO with their latest tech (FUGA ?) for 2009 meant zero revenue coming in. Which is sad. Not least of which, the loss of the best looking flat panel ever made, but also such a sign of the times. Pioneer's exit from the market makes sense, from a business standpoint. As great as the Kuro was, Pioneer only held 4.9% (?) marketshare of the plasma market, according to a published industry survey. There's no way, considering the cost of producing plasma, that Pioneer could have continued producing plasmas with this small a share of the market. Panasonic has 49.9% marketshare (according to the same survey), and five factories in Japan totally dedicated to nothing but producing plasma. Plasma is not going away, with Pioneer's exit. Pioneer leaving is an indication that the market is correcting itself, as would be expected.For $2000 I can't find a finer 50\" HDTV, it may be awhile before another company sets a new standard.  YES I desired the KRP monitor two months after buying the 5020, the 500M arrived on May 4.  The review of that display was posted Aug 1.  I now rate the 5020 model a 4.2 stars.

I thought my Qualia 005 was amazing, but this Pioneer is something else. I also compared the Pioneer against the latest Panasonic offerings, but there is just no competition. Worth every extra penny if you are a videophile - especially if you like watching movies in a pitch dark environment. You have to strain your eyes to see the black bars on the top and bottom of the screen - something that has always, always bugged my eyes all these years.

My experience goes beyond just the tv.  My first tv arrived and when the delivery guys did the set up and turned on the power there was no picture.  I simply refused the delivery, contacted Amazon, and a week later got a new tv delivered that works great.  There was no questions, no extra charges, just great service.As for the tv its self, it is the best I've ever seen.  The blacks are as dark as you can imagine.  When a movie fades to black in between scenes and you normally can still see the black bars on the top of the bottom, it doesn't happen with this tv.  Everything goes completely black and you don't see a difference.  In fact in dark scenes the black melds so well with the black bars you can't tell where the movie part begins and ends.  As for the rest of the picture quality it is just as outstanding.  I tried out a Harry Potter movie on blu ray and it was incredible.  I could see stuff that I hadn't even noticed in the details at the movie theater.  The ease of setting up this tv was incredible.  It essentially worked from the moment I hooked up and looked great.

Can a TV really be THAT remarkable?  Absolutely.  The Pioneer Kuro 5020 has far exceeded my very high expectations.[...]I'm definitely not a videophile so this review is coming from someone who doesn't know much about the technical aspects of LCD or plasmas (although I've learned a lot by reading threads in the Plasma Display forum at[...].  Other than running the break-in images recommended by the pros at [...], I have done very little to tweak the picture settings.  I'm blown away by how vivid the colours are right out of the box.  And the speaker bar that runs the length of the bottom of the TV provides better than expected sound (I don't have the surround sound hooked up yet).WARNING: The instruction manual recommends that you lay the TV down flat when you go to attach the speaker bar.  DO NOT LAY THE TV DOWN!  I've read of people doing this and ending up with a cracked screen.  The TV comes with the stand already attached and putting the speaker bar on was relatively easy.  Even if you're going to mount it on the wall it might be best to attach the speaker first and then remove the stand from the TV.If you have cable or a satellite dish subscribing to a package that includes HD channels is a must.  The SD channels are better than expected but the HD channels are amazing.  I love sports although to this point I've only been able to watch basketball in HD.  I'm looking forward to the start of the baseball season.  For sports, plasma is the way to go since you don't have to worry about any blurring or lag-time in the picture when watching the action.I've been surprised at how clear the picture is when sitting up close to this TV.  I can be just a few feet away and when watching an HD channel, the picture is still crisp and not at all grainy like I would expect.Unfortunately we don't have a DVD player hooked up to the Kuro yet so I can't comment on watching DVD's yet.  We're looking to get a blu-ray player and I haven't had time to hook up our old DVD player.  From other reviews I've read regarding watching blu-rays or even upconverted DVDs on this TV, though, it's supposed to be incredible.  Can't wait.Amazon's \"Free Enhanced Delivery\" lived up to expectations.  They actually showed up 5 hours early (delivery window was supposed to be 4-8 p.m. - they called my wife at 11:15 a.m. to say they were in the neighborhood) and I had to rush home from work.  By the time I got home they had already removed the TV from the box and put it on our new TV stand.  They would have taken the box if we'd wanted them to and they would have turned on the TV as well to make sure it worked but I declined.  The temperatures had been in the 30's and I decided it would be best to wait until the set had gotten to room temperature before we fired it up.If you like to play around a lot with the picture settings you would be better served getting the Elite PRO111 FD but also be prepared to pay several hundred dollars more.  I think this 5020 is the best HDTV value out there right now.  No, it's not the cheapest but it's become much more affordable in the past few months and for under $2,000 there is no other TV that compares.I was dead set on getting the Panasonic TH-50PZ800U because of the [...] reviews and the fact it was so much cheaper.  I went to Best Buy a few times to check out the Panasonic and despite the nice picture, my eyes were always drawn to the 5020 that hung next to it.  At the time I couldn't justify paying extra for the 5020 (no matter how hard I tried!) but now that the prices are almost identical, it was a no-brainer.I've never been happier with any purchase I've made.  This is the TV you want.  Get it before it's too late.UPDATE:  I meant to add that if you get this TV and it fails to power up after you plug it in and hit the \"On\" button on the remote, DON'T PANIC!.  There is an additional power button you have to press located in the lower left-hand corner on the back of the TV.

The delivery firm was helpful and careful, and did everything I'd hope for in terms of getting the thing out of the box and mounting it on the stand.Two small disappointments, neither a big deal:1. The remote is pretty lame. The one with this TV is altogether fully-featured but otherwise dull and unimaginative. No attention to ergonomics or usability whatsoever. I know, I know, just like most remotes... but I'm a TiVo user so have high standards. They could have done much better, but I guess it wasn't their focus.2. No way to disable inputs. This TV has a huge number of inputs (which is great) but there's no way to tell it \"hey, there's nothing on inputs 1,2, and 6\".

The picture quality has not diminished as far as we can tell. Recently ran an HDTV/Blu-ray setup disc (HD Essentials) and no adjustments were required when we checked each test graph and grid. We connect our Blu-ray player on HDMI of course and now our new SiliconDust HD Homerun TV Tuner on HDMI via our home theater PC. It all works great after using that HD test disc to set up the picture coming from the computer. Compared to other TVs I've looked at recently, this Pioneer KURO is still the champ!We wanted to replace our 40-inch Sony KV-40XBR700 picture tube HDTV. Unlike most LCD televisions, the Sony picture tube set has very natural color, a very wide viewing angle, and very good built-in speakers. Unfortunately, the old Sony weighs 304 lbs. (yes, really!) and it sticks out a long way into the room. So, where could we get a replacement that would retain the best features of the Sony? Accurate color? Wide viewing angle? Very good built-in speakers?The answer was the Pioneer KURO PDP-5020FD 50-inch plasma. We've had it a little over 3 months and, in a word, it's OUTSTANDING. The Sony picture tube TV was very good but this Pioneer plasma is simply terrific in every way.On the MOVIE setting, we played the THX setup thing on our Pirates of the Caribbean DVD (not BLU-RAY). Guess what? No adjustments were needed. We did this in a darkened room with just a small lamp on in the corner of the room.We have large windows in the room so daytime viewing requires a higher contrast setting. Mostly we use Optimum setting with the room light sensor enabled, or just set it on Standard without the room light sensor. Looks great either way. Don't let anyone tell you that a plasma isn't bright enough.Watched a golf tournament on the Sports setting. Wow - that was a dazzling experience! Can hardly  wait for football season to start...[...]HDTV reception is from Comcast cable. We record almost everything on the Comcast DVR (made by Motorola) so we can skip through the commercials. HD programs look very good indeed, and even standard-definition programs come across smooth and clear (with the rare exception of washed-out or jagged 30 year-old reruns!). Movies broadcast in HD are a real treat, too.You won't find more natural-looking color than the Pioneer anywhere, and you can sit way off to the side and still see a crisp clear picture. This is way better than LCD sets.Oh, I almost forgot. There is no motion blur whatsoever on this TV! Plasma TVs simply don't have that problem. So, fast moving sports action is limited only by the quality of the broadcast, not by the TV. (Some channels deliver blocky, pixelated effects on close-up fast action, possibly because of excessive compression. Have seen the effect on all types of TVs.)We bought our Pioneer on a 2-day or 3-day sale at [...] That's the nearest thing to a \"steal\" that you could possibly hope for on a top quality model such as this!Regarding hookup, the delivery guys were just two guys in a hurry to finish all their deliveries. They wanted to leave the unopened carton on our porch and drive away. We insisted they unbox the set and place it on our stand in the living room and wait while we turned it on to make sure it worked before they left.For this review to be balanced we should say something negative about the TV. OK, here it is: Plasma TVs radiate a fair amount of heat from the screen. Right now we're having a local heat wave with temperatures exceeding 100 degrees each day.

Hogan", "ReviewID": "R1X7EHHD4DVUYE", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "If you're like me, you've been vacillating back and forth over what flat screen TV to buy for months. You've read every consumer website and TV/AV/blog trying to make an informed decision. You may have worn out your car tires and patience by visiting all the electronic stores and dept. store tv aisles while trying to artfully dodge those commission-hungry sales drones. Were you able to make an informed, intelligent decision while looking at side-by-side demo's of poorly set-up flatscreens with less-than-stellar demo video feeds all while trying to tune out the salesperson's inane technobabble?Let me make it easy for you: If you want the best picture quality available, than your list begins and ends with a Pioneer PDP! Period.Samsung and Panasonic make very nice plasma's. Their top-rated models are superior to anything else on the market, save one Manufacturer's sets (guess who's? LOL!). Just so you don't think I'm biased, I personally own a new TH-42PX80 Panasonic that does Master BR duty just fine, but it's no Pioneer. In the very recent past, there was a considerable price difference between the Panasonic and the Pioneer, which swayed many budget-conscious buyers away from the Pioneer. Now that the price on the 50\" PDP-5020 has nose-dived to within $100-$200 of the highly-rated Panasonic TH-50PZ800, it's a no-brainer. The Pio is clearly superior. Don't believe me? You DID do your research (as above), right?Worried about the 2/12/09 corporate press release announcement that Pioneer's getting out of the PDP business? Pioneer is NOT going under, it's just re-aligning itself with the harsh realities of the depressed global economy. Your warrantee will be honored and US Consumer Law ensures parts will be available for sometime to come. On top of that, Pioneer's (along with Pansonic) have the top consumer reliabilty rating (see Consumer Reports Mag for more info).Now...if you need a bigger set, the waters become muddied. Right now, the pricing on 60\" Pioneer PDP's (PDP-6020 and Elite PRO-151) have not YET dropped like the 50\" models. While I'd still recommend the 60\" Pio over the 58\" Panny, the Panny is available for a $1k or more off of the Pio price. That makes the Pioneer hardly a bargain, but you do get what you pay for. You could wait it out and hope the prices will drop. It all depends on supply and demand.Still with me? OK, stop reading this drivel and click on the \"add to cart\" button, LOL! Seriously, Amazon's customer service, along with the \"enhanced\" (formerly \"white glove\") delivery via CEVA is excellent. I just got my Pio  this past weekend from them (as well as my Panny just a month ago) and I can't say enough about them.What are you waiting for? Get yours while they're still available! At this price level, supplies won't last long....and when they're gone, they're gone!P.S., Add the Pioneer BDP-51FD BonusView Blu-ray Player for a reference-level video system at bargain pricing. I liked 'em so much, I bought two: one for the Kuro, one for the Panny.Enjoy!UPDATE (2/20/09): There's a fly in the ointment...I found two stuck pixels (one red, one green) right in the middle of the display....unit was delivered last Sat (2/14), i.e., it is less than one week old. Amazon has already arranged for a replacement. I reserve comment until the set is properly replaced. I love the tv, but I don't love this problem! I hope this is an isolated incident.UPDATE (2/26/09): The new TV is here...so far, so good. No obvious problems YET....dead pixels, buzzing, etc., are a non-issue. Time will tell if this stays status quo.Another word about the \"enhanced\" shipping: Apparently, Amazon uses at least two shippers for flat screens on the East Coast, Pilot and CEVA. The last two PDP deliveries were from CEVA, this time it was Pilot. Pilot simply was substandard to CEVA, in my case. While losing the \"White Glove Delivery\" moniker was wise of Amazon (we're not talking about Sotheby's here, LOL!), don't expect rocket scientists to deliver your expensive purchase. Personally, given the choice, I'd chose CEVA as the lesser of evils to deliver my next large (expensive) purchase over Pilot hands-down.UPDATE (5/19/09): No problem so far. The PQ seems to get better with age, and I used a break-in disc for nearly 200hrs first. Still mulling over whether to get a Pro calibration done on it. Those in the know say it's a worthwhile (albeit, subtle) inprovement. The thing is already so sweet and I'm using D-Nice's recommended setings (see avsforum.com) on Cinema mode, so I may just save the $300-$400 calibrator's fee and spend it on Blu-ray discs instead, LOL!.", "Date": "February 17, 2009"}, {"Title": "The best TV ever made", "Author": "Digital Puer \"digital_puer\"", "ReviewID": "R3M2RUZRXQZHX", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I've had this TV since January 2009, and the picture clarity continues to amaze me.

I realize anyone who is reading these reviews already are fully aware of the KURO reputation. It truly does not disappoint!! I have been keeping my eye on this one for a while now. The price was the major drawback to not having purchased this set in the past. At least for me, spending over $4K on a Plasma was a little out of my price range. It has now dropped in price over 50% as a result of Pioneer getting out of the Plasma business, which is quite sad by the way. This tough economy has hit them hard as well. Well the price finally hit my trigger point and I ordered this online from BB. The picture this Plasma produces is really breathtaking. Pioneer's level of black detail is truly unmatched by any other MFG. The deep black level allows the TV to reach astounding shadow details. I have noticed things on this TV that I have never noticed before, the little details. After all, it's the little things in life that seem to matter the most. The color accuracy is right on the mark. This combined with the deepest black's, outstanding shadow detail, give THE best picture IMHO I have ever, ever seen. This set produces that POP I was looking for from HD sources. SD is adequate, but HD is where it is at. The KURO will spoil you, so be aware, be fully aware. The KURO is meant for HD and has blown me away. I have DirecTV as one source of HD and the other is BD. I have the Samsung BD-P2550. 1080P BD movies are simply a sight to behold on the KURO. As I mentioned before, this KURO will spoil you. I do not want to leave my house it is THAT good. Combined with a good 5.1 system, I am in total KURO HD heaven. This TV comes with a separate speaker bar that you attach to the bottom of the set. There are times where I do not want to listen through my receiver and utilize the onboard sound system. The sound it produces is very, very good.  I was quite surprised at the quality of the included sound bar.  It gave surprisingly solid bass at higher listening levels.  The KURO is feature packed and has many adjustments you can make. Enough for the average person.  Many people have decided to calibrate this TV and I may do that in the future. I have it set to OPTIMUM and right now I am so pleased with the results. I really can't imagine a better picture. Do yourself a favor, if you are on the fence at the moment about purchasing this KURO, go out and get it today. They will only be around for a short time since the MFG has ceased. I am not regretting my decision at all and am really glad I made the purchase.

I'm sure you know the details by now, incredible black levels that provide a popping image with unrivaled clarity.  I won't repeat all of that but just know that if you can find this TV I would recommend you get it.The menus could not be easier to use and the so called 'buzz' that people hear is very minor an is a property of plasmas.  If you don't go looking for it, you will never hear it!  Movie mode is your best bet for the most natural picture and I find game mode to be a close 2nd, if you desire a slightly cooler picture.  Out of the box, movie mode is around 6200k which is too warm (yellowish) for most people.  Game is around (7500k) which is a little too cool, but some like that and it may be the setting for your.  Otherwise, after performing the proper break-in and once you get to about 300+ total hours on the set I would recommend getting ControlCAL and modifying the RGB highs/lows to bring the movie grayscale up to 6500k.  Once this is done, use movie mode for everything with Pure Cinema standard or off for the most natural picture.  Use game mode with Pure Cinema set to advance for anything you want 'whiter.'  This works because PC:Advance does not hold the adjusted grayscale.  Better yet, if you can afford it, get a calibration from an ISF calibrator to bring out the potential this set has to offer.Blu-rays are great, HD cable is great (for the few shows that provide a good PQ), SD is decent but honestly, why get a Kuro if you're going to watch SD?  Gaming is perfect on the 5020, my experience being with the PS3.  Also, if you don't have a home theater system the sound from the Kuro is the highest quality audio you can get from a flat screen.  As with most plasmas, you can sit almost 90 deg to the screen and still make out the image.  Try that with an LCD, the viewing area is great making this a must if you have furniture to the sides.  The anti-glare coating is also extremely effective.  The only downside, extremely minor at that, is that switching between photos and videos with the Home Media Gallery can be kind of slow.  Not a big deal but just a bit of an annoyance if you were to frequently use that feature.  If you're like me, you don't even use it though and use the PS3 instead. :)I could write a book on every detail of this set but just know it is a great one.  I am yet to find anything to dissapoint me.  The PQ is only surpassed by that of the Kuro Elite, but not by much.  Feel free to ask me any question about this great TV.A side note on the shipping.  It left Amazon on a Thursday and was scheduled to arrive the next Thursday.  On Monday I got a call saying it would be delivered on Tuesday, 2 days early.  It was shipped via Pilot, which went flawless, to a local delivery company that arrived right on time.  The white glove delivery really is a great deal as most online retailers will charge $250+ for that.

Wow, what a savings of space! In a small house there is a huge difference between an \"old style\" television and a newer, thin appliance. And oh what a difference high definition makes! It is like moving from an old VGA monitor to a modern computer display.All of the wow about Pioneer's ability to show black is simply true, and that is perhaps the primary reason for buying this television. In the store, when looking at twenty or more LCD and plasma models on a wall, this one clearly stood head and shoulders above the rest. I had an experience similar to many other reviewers: my unsuspecting wife walked up to me in the store and before she could speak I asked her to quickly look at all the units on the wall (which displayed the same image, of course) and she immediately picked the Pioneer. Since we both wanted the best image we could get for under three grand it wasn't hard to convince her that this was the model for us.My only complaint, and it is minor, is that I will need to buy a wireless LAN adapter and probably velcro it to the back of the television and run a power cord to the floor in order to use the file sharing capability provided.

The colors are incredibly vivid and the contrast and blacks are second to none.  I have had a few friends that have purchased higher-end LCD sets ($3500+) recently and even a 120 hertz LED LCD, and none of these televisions produce a picture as realistically life-like as the Kuro.  Infact, there isn't an LCD display (other than Sony's 11 inch Organic LED $2,400) that even comes close to comparing to plasma technology, especially in this television's case.  The Kuro produces an amazing image; free of the motion artifacts that plague all LCDs, even the 120 hertz LED LCDs, although to a lesser extent.  Even if you purchase a LED LCD you will probably occasionally notice strange bright lining effects that these televisions create due to the fact that there is not an LED for every pixel.  Not to mention the contrast and blacks still look better on the Kuro.  Virutally every major television critic considers Pioneer's Kuros and Elites to be the \"best of the best\" picture wise and once you see the quality of the image that this television produces, especially in a darker room, you will understand why the professionals feel this way.  Due to the superb contrast and black levels, this television can come closer to producing a more life-like 3-D effect than any other television I've seen.  A lot of people are concerned about burn-in with plasmas but there really isn't much of chance of that happening with any of the newer plasmas.  I play video games on it all the time and there are plenty of static images that remain on the screen for long periods of time and I have yet to see any trace of burn-in.  I believe this is the case with all newer plasma televisions.  The technology, in terms of the quality of the image that it can produce, is year ahead of the LCD competition.

The colors are more vibrant than other Tv's ( maybe that is what they call inaccurate natural color) but it makes the viewing more dramatic and sharp, specially nature films.Next I saw  all the Harry potters on blue ray , in the movie mode  it is very much like being in the theater (I have seen HP in theater several times , the dark scenes are very beautiful on 5020 ) . If you need more of a back lit effect , the dymanic mode is better .The next time I went out to an electronic shop and saw all the LCD's , the high end ones , I could not find anything that came close to the 5020 even though they were all playing blu-ray  .I do not have cable , but the digital channels on TV look quite good . I had earlier seen  the new  panny hooked on to HD cable at best buy and I did not like the picture at all , maybe they had too many Tv's connected to that cable .  I did not not think it sensible to buy  something I was not very satisfied with ,cable problems or not .Somewhere else ,there was  a 5010 with I am legend playing , the picture seemed way ahead of other Tv's , true, Will Smith looked ruddier but he looked better and sharper and miraculously  softer  than with  the natural colors on other TV's. Other Tv's seemed either washed out ,  the LCD's were overly bright with an unnatural picture quality.  Overall I am quite hooked on the the Tv now , that and the Red box .

I now know that I couldn't have made a better decision.  These TVs are the best in the world, and I believe this to be the second best television in existence, second only to the Elite PRO-111FD.  This lacks some color adjustment features compared to the elite, but like most men I am slightly color deficient, meaning I can't tell the ultra-fine differences between reds and greens.  It certainly wasn't worth another $2,550 at the time to get some features I (and most people who aren't professional calibrators) wouldn't honestly miss or notice a difference in.  I can, however, tell the difference between this TV and all others.  I continue to walk through stores as I run errands and the like and see many, many TVs, some of which I had been considering before the KURO.  They all pale in comparison.  The picture of the KURO is amazing, with rich and vibrant colors, the depth is very three-dimensional, the blacks are deliciously inky, and the reproduction of film-based sources is completely accurate with its 24 frame mode.  Games have been a joy with superb black levels and accurate frame rates.  Calibration specs are available from CNET and I found them very nice.  Colors are extremely accurately reproduced and very natural.  Digital sources such as Cars and Wall-E were phenomenal, with not one single pixel out of place throughout.  The level of immersion you achieve from the 50 inches of 1080p is unmatched.  Never had an issue with burn-in or any of the things people worry about when considering a plasma.  And our first electric bill arrived the other day and it hasn't been an exponential increase as some would also worry.  It is energy star rated and our bill didn't increase at all; it was actually less this month than it normally is.  As of now, we are enjoying blu-rays through our PS3 which has been a treat.  I suppose I should talk about delivery, which was astoundingly quick and easy.  With shipping and tax free, we saved hundreds of dollars.  Amazon's delivery service arrived at my house on the day and time that I specified, unloaded it, brought it upstairs, unpacked the whole thing, assembled the speaker bar and made sure everything was working, packed up all of the trash, and left me sit there staring at my new TV for which it felt like I had been waiting an eternity (when it actually showed up an entire week before the expected arrival).  We were watching the office in HD that very evening.  The QAM card setup was a breeze and we pick up about 70 free digital channels.  You just can't get a better TV except for the Elite, and if you can make your budget work for it, then go for it.  You will never regret getting this KURO television.

The picture is superior, even off the over-the-air antenna signal I use. The tuner is OK, as it doesn't pull a signal any stronger than my previous $45 DTV converter. Pioneer deleted the cable card slot which also removed the over-the-air TV Guide feature that was in last year's 5010 model. Access to setup features takes way too many presses of buttons. Particularly, getting to the signal strength takes about 8 presses, and you have to do it for each channel separately. I've had the TV turn itself off twice while I was pressing the channel-up button. Pioneer has issued a firmware update I'm going to try, but the writeup on it doesn't include this problem. Also, it's very slow to change channels, a several second delay. And entering 4 digits and pressing \"Enter\" is excessive (28.1 Enter). They should have several \"Favorite\" channel buttons on the remote control; another feature they removed from last year's model 5010, annoyingly. Amazon's price was excellent, possibly since this model will be discontinued in April, '09 and Pioneer will go out of the Plasma business at least for a year, maybe forever.

The Panasonic receives the upcoverting signal, as does a borrowed Samsung. But for some reason, the Pioneer is a bust in this one key feature.

Satton", "ReviewID": "R3D3TFVAVAM8L0", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Honestly?  I've been researching Plasma's and LCD's for about a solid year now.  1: LCD's are about 5 years behind Plasma TV's so if your local salesman tries telling you otherwise just compare pictures.  The fact you notice Plasma's are VISIBLY deeper in color and crisper should give you a real good clue.  Where as Plasma TV's are about a year from reaching true black levels, LCD's are easily 3 to 5 years away still.  So I've fully decided on a Plasma.  Not to mention overall, prices are now much more competitive with Plasma's.Secondly, In comparing Plasma TV's two brands consistently rate among the top 2.  The Pioneer Kuro and the Panasonic Viera.  The lates Kuro Elite 50 inch (Soon to put out a 46 and 42 inch model which is more preferrable to me.) is rated as having almost near black level. The JUST receently released Panny alledgedly is even SLIGHTLY better by all color testing measures.  I think it was released like last week and isn't even on the U.S Market yet.  So anyway, I read this as I was about to buy the Panny 46 inch 800u NOT 80u.  The Panny 800u is extremely highly rated and at a much more reasonable price than the entirely over priced Pioneer which caters to the upper income bracket. Silly if you ask me.  Same technowledgy just high priced by  a mile.  So that narrowed my search to a Panny.3: So I'm about to buy it when I read a just released report on next years models.  It appears to be rumored both Panny and Pioneer intend to or have reached ACTUAL TRUE black levels.  So that stopped me in my tracks.  Why pay over 2 grand when next years Models will be far superior.  The argument is they will always be better but from my research, with Digital the new standard in Feb and many needing new TV's, there will be an even bigger push to get out the most improved model possible next year to attract the new consumer.  (Which is sorta bogus cause all you need is a cable box and wallah digital) but many will be completely duped into thinking they need a new TV.  So with that new push for the latest tech, recent rumors and money conerns, I personally recommend waiting a year.BUT, if you buy a TV? I myself recommend the 46 to 50 inch Panny Viera 800u.  It's been consistently rated higher than the newer 850u and visually, I myself see no real difference to the Pioneer which is at least 1200 more.", "Date": "September 19, 2008"}, {"Title": "buy another television", "Author": "DW", "ReviewID": "R1ADEQEZVFNNOA", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "Stay away from this tv.  It's a waste of money.  I am not a so called videofile unlike these other nerds who write these long evaluations using jargon that make us layman feel idiotic.  I do know a little about tvs after doing research on what to look for like ressolution and frequency. If you look at reviews from other tvs, they all get the same good evaluations from amazon. Even the LG looked good.  I made the mistake of buying this television due to pioneer's reputation.  When it was set up, and by the way, amazon's white glove service is awesome, I was concerned about the picture quality but had to wait till the HD was set up several weeks later.  I have durect tv by the way and it was installed by a professional so claiming a connection error will not fly.  The picture was still not at the same level as the sony XBR6 or panasonic viera or the samsung plasma BN50B550.  It was very graney and motion artifact was very obvious.  I called pioneer for help and they told me of a service provider who only works Mon-Fri 9-5.  Well like all of you, I work during the week and cannot be home.  Remember that there are only 2 makers of televisions and all the others only market their product.  Sony makes there own televisions and all the parts.  Because they have dedicated themselves to only LCD and dropped their plasma line, their tvs are far superior.  They just came out with the XBR8 so if you have the cash, go for it.  Samsung just came out with a 240hz LCD.  I went to best buy to compare each model.  At the store, the pioneer had a good picture but once again, comparing to other televisions, not even close. Go see it for yourself.  There is a reason why consumer reports do not review this television because the only tvs that are graded are ones given to consumer reports from the companies.  Pioneer refuses to have their televisions graded.  I wonder why a company that claims they have the highest quality tvs on the market would not want an objective comparison. I gave this television 2 stars because of amazons service and the fact they are an authorized pioneer provider.  Be careful of other online companies that are not recommended by pioneer or warranty is voided.  I ask you to see for yourself at best buy or any televion retailed and compare the tvs.  You will see the difference and I guarantee you will not want to fork out the money for a pioneer.

The first two, 5010fd's buzzed so loud I could hear it from the other room! I then decided to go with the newer 5020fd and when my tv arrived from amazon, it wouldn't even turn on! When I got my replacement set it had dead pixels right out of the box, but I wanted to at least keep it until another replacement came. When my third 5020fd came it wouldn't even turn on either so I decided  I would still keep the set with a few dead pixels until I got a proper replacement. So they put that tv back on my stand, plugged it in and it wouldn't turn on now! The power outlets were working, so that's a pretty big quality control issue Pioneer has. I really wanted this tv because of all the great things I've heard, but now I'm in disbelief. We only took the tv off the stand, then put it back on and it wouldn't turn on anymore! Now if I could get a replacement that was perfect out of the box I would say no, because if I ever move the tv I would run the risk of being stuck with a $4000 piece of junk.
