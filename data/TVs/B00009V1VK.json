{"Reviews": [{"Title": "An excellent LCD TV for anywhere with limited space.", "Author": "Roger J. Buffington", "ReviewID": "R2S5JGDCB9O16G", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This is a great little TV that seems to do everything well.  The picture is pretty darned good as LCDs go--it is very brilliant and crisp, although in common with all LCD screens that I've seen it sometimes is less-than-perfect for dark scenes.  The built-in speakers are mostly OK, although you in my opinion the set benefits significantly if you use bigger outboard speakers.This is a great choice for limited space applications.  I installed mine in my boat, and I love it!  The kids love it!  We use ours mainly to watch DVDs, and it is great for this.  Panasonic quality is a joy to behold, and this TV hits the mark.
