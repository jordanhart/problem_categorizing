I bought the Sony Blu-ray BDP-S300 a few months ago and loved the great sound and picture but I did not have full HD. So after much research I settled on the KDS-55A3000 to replace my older Sony 53\". My first Blu-ray disk I tried with the KDS-55A3000 was Casino Royale. I sat at the edge of my seat through the whole thing. The level of color clarity and contrast is stunning. The action was very smooth and no detectable jitter of the frame was seen. The off air tuner found all my digital channels in the area.The screen geometry is consistent and the blacks are a true black. One thing I noticed after setting up the tv is that there is a fan in the back \" It was so quiet, I did not hear it but saw the light from the projector and noticed the fan\" so ventilation is going to be important. If you have a bright room, this could also be an issue. The picture does fade a bit in a brightly lit room.  The software is well thought out and has more features that you will ever need. Great set-buy it!", "Date": "August 24, 2007"}, {"Title": "Simply Amazing.

The color on the set is AMAZING, with the native 1080p/24 and 120HZ motion, it is like you're shooting the movie yourself.There are a total of 6 1080P inputs, including Component and PC-IN, which is rare for a TV of this price.All in all, this is the first TV that I have legitimately no complaints with.  I've only had the TV for about 1.5 days, but usually by then in TV's I've had prior, I'd already found something I didn't like about it, that I would simply put up with.  This is the first TV that I can't find anything that I don't like about it.Time will be the true test, but so far this is definitely a winner and I can't imagine finding anything with a better picture in this price range.Enjoy!", "Date": "August 12, 2007"}, {"Title": "Three Dimensional Image", "Author": "Kurt D.

Cherry", "ReviewID": "R1EB8LN7A83I15", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I did the research, bounced back and forth between LCD and Projection, DLP and SXRD, 46 inch and larger sets. My family really wanted the bigger set but I knew the cost of large LCDs were out of my price range. Once I agreed to look at 50-55 inch sets I knew I was going rear projection. I narrowed the list to Sony and Samsung. I really wanted the Samsung DLP because it sounded cool (millions of mirrors...), all the NFL hype, and I've had a couple of rebate problems with Sony products (and I usually do hold that against companies). I also liked the black glossy case of the Samsung TVs. But it ultimately came down to picture quality. What is the since of having something big if it doesn't deliver the best picture? I got the KDS 55A3000 without having seen it in person. Multiple website reviews were very complementary, and I have to say this is a GREAT TV. Shipping was a little crazy as it shipped from a location 20 minutes from my house, yet it took six days to get it (but it was delivered one day before the 'expected' delivery date). Didn't get any help with the setup from the delivery guys and I think in my case that was a good thing. Set up my NON-HD DVD Player and Receiver and watched \"HEAT\". Movie looked great. Don't worry about fan noise or color wheel distortion on this TV.", "Date": "December 12, 2007"}, {"Title": "WOW!

I almost bought a Bravia LCD, but this tv cost half as much and on HD content, it's hard to tell them apart.  The delivery was with Eagle, not one problem, they carried it in and waited untill I hooked it up and turned it on.

View it in action at your high-end Audio Video Store, as they will have a local cable or satellite provider, not the canned stuff shown on all HD televisions in the big-box stores. Then you will see what you get at home.Forget about what Amazon says about  \"Amazon's White Glove Delivery Service.  We believe that your purchase deserves a special degree of handling and delivery. To achieve the highest customer satisfaction, we provide a white glove delivery service that is designed to ensure that your purchase arrives damage free and in a timely manner.\"\"At your home delivery experts will place the carton in a room of your choice on the ground floor, unpack the product, and remove all packing materials from the residence. If you find signs of damage to your product, simply refuse delivery, and you will receive a refund.\"No so. The TV is well-packed by Sony, but my beef is with the Eagle delivery service. They were an hour past the four-hour window, first brought the wrong item, a sofa, from the truck on their too-small dolly.  Then took the sofa back to their truck for the TV.  When they got it down the driveway, instead of using the two handles SONY provided on the carton to carry it, they removed the TV outside, and may have incorrectly carried (which I found by reading the manual) the TV into the house.  But only after I told them of the Amazon instruction.  The delivery man showed me a *different* delivery ticket which did not say \"2Man Inside Unpack Detrash.\" But this is on the one I signed after the delivery.  I gave them a gratuity for moving our old TV to another location.  Wished now that I had asked Eagle if I could have picked up the TV in my truck.In summary, have a responsible person at home to make sure Eagle takes the SONY box inside by the handles, then removes the TV and places it on your stand, and follows the Sony instructions: \"Place one hand in the hole on the lower portion of the rear cabinet while grasping the top with the other hand.  Do not hold the by the pedestal or the front panel of the TV. Doing so may cause thes parts to break off.\"Enjoy your Sony Bravia SXRD", "Date": "December 11, 2007"}, {"Title": "Just great", "Author": "vadim4o", "ReviewID": "R1SWHTEJHSMEHN", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "If you want big screen HDTV, why to pay twice as much for \"cool\" Plasma or LCD (unless you absolutely *need* to mount it on the wall)?Delivered by Eagle, no complains.", "Date": "January 14, 2008"}, {"Title": "This replaced my other Sony", "Author": "L.

Purchased in early January, I've only had it for about a month now, but have been nothing but pleased thus far. Picture clarity is fantastic, as is the color, and it's loaded with enough options to make any viewer happy. It's been said by some that the menu system is complicated, but any who have even the most basic understanding of modern-day tech navigation will have no problem at all. Plenty of inputs to accommodate most components.I only have three complaints, and all of them are VERY minor. The first is that the TV lacks a USB input, so connecting a camera or memory stick for slideshow viewing is not possible. In its place is a PC input though, so one could easily play the show on a computer, or even burn a DVD of the photos to play in a DVD player.The other two gripes are even more minor... the \"mute\" message stays on the screen at all times (when muted), which annoys me only b/c when watching a DVD I use only the 5.1 speakers, and it would be nice to just press mute rather than have to scroll the volume down every time. The other gripe is that the \"TV\" input cannot be removed from the input selection list, unlike all of the other inputs. I don't use the coax input at all since I have an HD cable box via HDMI, so I would like to get it off the top of the list. As I said, these are about as minor as one can get.Just as a warning to any that aren't super informed about HDTV tech, this is a rear-projection system. That means four big things:1) It will take a healthy 30 seconds to put a picture on the screen once turned on, and even then it will be dark for another 30-45 secs until the lamp warms up.2) Since it does run off a lamp, which is estimated to last about 8,000 viewing hours, it will eventually need to be replaced, which will cost about $150-200 but can be easily done by the owner.3) The TV is approx. 16\" in depth, which means it CANNOT be wall-mounted, and needs to have a substantial base to sit on.4) Since it is a projection system, viewing angles become very important. Viewers looking at the TV from extreme left or right angles will see a darkened, faded picture. An even more important consideration is vertical viewing angle. Unlike LCD or Plasma, this cannot be viewed from much below or above the set, lest you get the faded picture. Estimate the height your eyes are at when you watch TV, then plan your TV stand purchase accordingly to get the center of the screen as close to that height as possible.Those points listed above are not complaints, as I was fully aware of those factors prior to purchase. I have listed them here to help describe the product in full.All in all, a great machine that we've been very happy with. And really, a well-performing, 55\" 1080p screen for this price is a bargain that's hard to beat.", "Date": "February 5, 2008"}, {"Title": "SONY KDS-A-55-3000 SXRD /I CAN SEE CLEARLY NOW", "Author": "Dwight Delarge", "ReviewID": "RXF8C3VP1B3HV", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "THE SONY KDS55-3000 HAVE MET AND EXCEEDED THE REAR PROJECTION HDTV EXPECTATIONS.

This TV has a better picture and sells for around $1,750 (Feb 2008).  If you must go Plasma, stick with Panasonic or Pioneer.  If you must go LCD, stick with Sony, Sharp or Samsung.  Still, you will be spending $2,500 to $3,500 going the LCD/Plasma route.  Save the money and spend it on your cable/satellite bills, a surround-sound system, Blue Ray DVD player, kids college fund, or a few nights out on the town with that \"special woman\" in your life.Make sure to read the manual as it covers the many different functionalities of this outstanding TV.
