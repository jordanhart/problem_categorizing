We had a cheaper LCD tv (Emerson) in our room, but it broke after 1 year and can not be repaired!  So we have been searching for a few days and it was a toss between Samsung and Sony.  We went with Samsung because the picture looked better.  I am very pleased that we did.  I love all the features and the picture quality.  HD is awsome.  Glad I spent the extra money for a \"name brand\" model.", "Date": "June 14, 2008"}, {"Title": "Exceeded expectations", "Author": "K. E. Kelly", "ReviewID": "R37ONKLYS5D5VS", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "My new monitor arrived today, with \"white glove service.\" I was looking for something to replace my 13\" TV and 19\" monitor (also Samsung; I am a Samsung fan), and this fills the bill perfectly. I am just moderately adept at figuring out how to hook up electronic equipment, but the manual included is very clear and descriptive in explaining what goes where. I had no problem with the video aspect of hooking up the TV to my Mac. I do need to get a longer audio cord, so at this point I can't comment on the computer audio setup. The TV picture and sound are great, even without an HD tuner (I have a broadband basic satellite connection on this second TV), and I had no problem with making adjustments to the picture for viewing in the monitor mode. Shipping was free (Amazon Prime member), and I saved about $40 by ordering through Amazon rather than making the trip to the local Wal-Mart. The delivery service was excellent. Setup was truly \"Plug and Play,\" and, boy, is that refreshing! Very easy to set up and very easy to make adjustments to the picture. For someone who wants a TV/monitor combination for an office or small space, this is perfect.", "Date": "July 11, 2008"}, {"Title": "Great T.V., great picture, no problems", "Author": "Surge", "ReviewID": "R3VT34O17GV94S", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I needed a new T.V. for my apartment this upcoming school year and after doing a lot of looking this one seems to be the best T.V. for the price you can get it for. I couldn't find one single negative review on it on multiple websites. The T.V. has great picture quality and looks great when I play on my Xbox 360. HD channels also look crisp and clear if u have them. Has plenty of inputs so you can hook up plenty of stuff up to it. Since its a Samsung you know you will be getting a quality product which is going to last you.It was easy to set up and its basically plug and watch. The T.V. will do all the work for you, just turn it on and have it auto configure itself and your good to go. Only 2 minor nuisances is that the auto configuration can take awhile but of course its a one time thing so its not like it will matter after the first time. The other is that it takes a long time for it to turn on after pressing the power button. Mine takes approximately 9 seconds for it to turn on after pressing power. When it comes to flaws on a T.v. I would have something as little as that rather than anything else. If you're on the fence about this T.V. I highly recommend to just go for it, you wont regret it.", "Date": "August 8, 2008"}, {"Title": "Samsung always delivers.", "Author": "mike", "ReviewID": "R2CEEQ1VMVEU4A", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I bought my first Samsung tube 720p HDTV back in 2005 for $650 brand new.  It was a 27\" piece of gold and I couldn't believe how sweet the 360 looked on it.  Fast forward 3 years later to flat panel LCD TVs and I'll tell ya...Samsung has not lost their talent when it comes to making HDTVs.  I have my Wii and 360 hooked up to it and the 360 looks amazing.  The glossy black finish is so nice.  The tv really sticks out.  The only thing I don't like about the TV is that it only has 3 preset color modes and I know on other models there is a game preset mode that is pretty sweet.  I can fine tune the colors myself though, if I need to.  Other than that I have no complaints about this fine product.Oh, I didn't mention how good the Wii looks because...well, it's a Wii and only plays at 480p max.  Metroid Prime 3 looks no more than decent on 480p.  But connect a PS3 or Xbox 360 to the HDMI port(s) and you'll be in heaven.I definitely recommend this TV to any gamer who is on a budget.  I was looking at the 32 inch of this model but I was like $80 short and didn't feel like driving 45 minutes back to my house to get more money, lol.  This TV is WELL worth it.  5 stars for Samsung.", "Date": "June 5, 2008"}, {"Title": "Great TV overall", "Author": "AL", "ReviewID": "RV2TM4OKDKEUM", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "This is my first HDTV and I couldn't be happier with the picture, it truely is amazing. The reason I give it 4* is because the sound is terrible, you really do NEED to buy external speakers. It sounds like a radio, which is a huge turn off if you doing something like playing Guitar Hero or watching mtv, things of that nature. I disregarded the other reviewers saying the sound is bad, it really is noticable. Just a little thing on my wish list, I wish it had S-Video, Headphone plug ins, and PIP but the 2 HDMI inputs make up for it. I just listed all the cons about the TV which may make you think that it's a bad set, but it really has great picture quality. Xbox 360 games look great with the HDMI input, and HD programs, like football, look so much better than with a regular TV. Regualr cable channels do look like crap, as they do with most/all HDTV's. Just be weary that if you buy this set you will most likely also need to buy speakers and digital cable. I'd recommend this to anyone.", "Date": "September 20, 2008"}, {"Title": "Big Fan of Samsung TV's", "Author": "T.

I went from a semi-antique to this and what a difference! I don't have it hooked up to an HD feed (Dish wants an arm and a leg for that) but it's enough better that I don't feel I need it.

Absolutely no complaints in that Department. Very bright vibrant Colors. The Xbox 360 never looked better.Although in the speaker department. They tend to distort easily. I enjoy playing Guitar Hero. But with these Speakers its kind of hard to do. I suggest getting another source of Sound when it comes to this TV. Unless of course your strictly going to watch Programs and Shows you should be fine. It will do the Job, but barely.Picture ***** Best I've seen for this SizeLooks  ****  Nice but not great enough to really grab your EyeSound  **  Terrible for Music ok for ProgramingQuality ****  Solid feel to it but Stand could be a little sturdier", "Date": "July 27, 2008"}, {"Title": "Misleading images - Bezel is thicker than it is in images.", "Author": "Jake2000", "ReviewID": "R1ZHFFI5Z6B0GU", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "All of the advertising images of this TV are misleading.

That TV was only a few years old, too, which doesn't say too much for Sony products. This TV, however, is so beautiful; it is FAR superior to the old tube TV I had. There is just no comparison. The colors are vibrant and the contrast is amazing, especially in HD. It is my first HD TV and I can definitely see why people love these TVs so much.The sound is just okay. I do not have the sound distortion problem resulting from using the QAM tuner and not a cable box with Comcast with this TV. Hopefully, I will never get this problem since it is a major issue with the 32\" Samsung TV we bought shortly after this one. You can see what I mean by reading my review on the LN32A330 model. Apparently, most of Samsung's tuners are defective in these TVs and do not work well with cable signals (mainly Comcast) unless there is a cable box. This results in distorted or \"robotic\" sound on HD channels at regular intervals.I highly recommend this TV ONLY if you use a cable box. I personally wouldn't take a chance with it if you have Comcast or any other cable without a cable box. My 26\" doesn't have the sound problem, but it could only be a matter of time before it pops up, which I have heard does happen.", "Date": "November 28, 2008"}, {"Title": "Samsung LN26A330 26-Inch 720p LCD HDTV", "Author": "Jim K.", "ReviewID": "R3ARJHYIKXOHBN", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "This TV was easy to set up.

I cannot say enough good things about the Samsung line of televisions.  At the same time I purchased this one, I also purchased a 40 inch.This television (the 26 inch) has a high quality picture vs. our 26 inch Sony.  This television \"hands down\" outdoes my Sony in sound, picture quality and adjustment features. In fact, if you stand to the side of our Sony, the picture becomes very blurry--not so with the Samsung.The menu is very user friendly and I really like the fact that you can set the volume to adjust with channel changes.  Our cable system is such that some stations are much louder than others.  With a quick adjustment on the Samsung, that no longer is a problem.Amazon's shipping is so fast and free shipping is sure a plus.  We actually paid less for this television than we did for our Sony and this is a better television.I would absolutely recommend this television to any looking for a high quality flat screen.
