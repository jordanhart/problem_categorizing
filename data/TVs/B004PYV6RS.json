I actually compare all the models - using manuals - and believe me I found 0 differences. I think Panasonic just re-manufactured the same thing but with different name. Unbelievable, how people fall for that.The quality of the picture is awesome, size perfect for my rented apartment and it is easy to move!Thanks", "Date": "May 31, 2012"}, {"Title": "I Am Extremely Happy With This TV", "Author": "Jim Fenn", "ReviewID": "R3H13VXNBAZE7", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I was a little doubtful about LCD but the picture is great.  Clear and sharp.  Sound is good, I use other speakers for that.  Easy to use, the remote is user friendly.

I was burned on another brand that only lasted until a day after warrentee then it failed and was beyond repair.I found the panasonic LCD tv and ordered it.  It arrived fast and was packed well and when I turned it on, it was great.  I really like the remote control that comes with it because the button layout is simple and makes sense.  The colors are good, blues are blue, reds are red, yellows are yellow.  Even the sound is decent on such a small set.  I often don't even turn the surround sound on because it doesn't really need it..  The set is light so If you needed to move it, it is not the problem one of those tube type TVs are and it uses much less power to operate.  I am happy with this purchase and I would recommend it to a friend.  140412", "Date": "April 14, 2014"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": null, "Features": null, "Name": null, "ImgURL": null, "ProductID": "B004PYV6RS"}}
