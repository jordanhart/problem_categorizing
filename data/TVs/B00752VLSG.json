{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Best tv you can buy right now", "Author": "Anthony Campo", "ReviewID": "R1I1Q86RKQHPEB", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "In my opinion, this tv is the best to be had at this time. To provide some background for that opinion, I have tried the following sets while I still had my Kuro 5020: The VT30, D7000 and the 80\" Sharp 632U LED. The Sharp was something I had to try based on some reviews but it really was quite disappointing and never even made it onto the wall. For further information regarding my opinion of the Sharp, please read the comments section where I have answered a question regarding my expereince with this set. The VT30 was quite good but had color issues, uniformity issues and large bezel syndrome. The D7000 was far better than I had expected after reading the nasty comments about it. But none of these sets allowed me to feel good about sending my 9g Kuro packing.With much anticipation, I ordered the 65VT50 from Amazon. The entire process was painless and quick as per usual. Delivery was sooner than expected and professional. They did send only one driver, so be prepared for that. But we managed just fine. I quickly inspected the set and immediately mounted it and got things setup. Everything went smoothly.I did download and install an available update. The only new \"feature\" I noticed after the update was a fairly long duration banner at TV startup. This is defeatable within the settings, so fear not.**** A second update had been released and is mentioned at the end of this review.****** 09/28/2012 update #3 version 1.17 is out. This may effect a calibrationNow for my impression of this television.This VT50 is simply beautiful. The smaller bezel and overall aesthetics are quite excellent. Gone are the days of \"but LCD's are so much slimmer and/or less bulky\". This set looks great turned off. I am happy to pay a premium for the single sheet of glass design even if that was the only difference over the GT, but its not.Some complain about the silver trim, but you will be hard pressed to find an owner that does not like it. Personaly, I really like the look. I think the TV would look rather run of the mill and boring without it.The touchpad was easy to pair with the television. I do not imagine myself using the touch pad much, but it does work as advertised. If you use your television to browse at all, you may find the touchpad quite useful. I had no issues navigating with it at all.It is also worth mentioning that this set is also quite a bit lighter than the VT30.To my eye, the blacks are right there with the Kuro I just sold. A meter may say otherwise but it takes a trained eye to see the difference if not side by side. The blacks are inky and satisfying and do not leave me wanting in any way. My eyes are pretty damn good and all I can say is that I do not miss my Kuro one single bit. And the extra real estate is quite nice as well.Equally as impressive is the increased brightness of this panel. If you find that you are really drawn to the brightness of an LCD, but prefer the motion of a plasma, this set should fit your bill perfectly. I have two large windows in my living room and never feel like I need more out of my set in terms of brightness. The anti-glare works excellent as well.If I was forced to come up with a gripe, it would be the red LED that comes on when the set is on. This was poor planning on Panasonics part but I am not losing any sleep over it. A little well trimmed piece of electrical tape takes care of that if it really bothers you.Everything works as it should. HDMI control works perfectly on mine. I can hit the power button once on my Directv remote and everything turns on as it should (STB, TV, and AVR). ARC (Audio Return Channel) is also nice. This allows the audio from the TV to play through your home stereo while utilizing the same HDMI cable that feeds it content. To utilize this feature, you will need to plug your HDMI cable into HDMI #2 on the television. This is great for when you are watching Netflix or something emanating from the TV itself. All this functionality is assuming that you have an AVR that is up to date and HDMI 1.4a compliant as well as your HDMI cables. I use these cables Mediabridge Ultra Series - High Speed HDMI Cable with Ethernet - (6 Feet) - Category 2 Certified - Supports 3D & Audio Return Channel [Latest HDMI Version Available]. They have worked perfectly for me every single time and the price is nice. I still feel compelled to interupt when I see an employee at a Big Box store trying to convince an unknowing person to spend over $100 on a Monster cable.You will notice that the HDMI ports are extremely close to the edge of the set. If you have rigid cables, it can present a problem and possibly cause them to protrude past the edge. There are several fixes for this. The one I chose was to use two of these connectors Cable Matters Gold Plated HDMI Male to HDMI Female 270 Degree Adapter. Together they create a 180 degree bend to allow your cables to be neatly installed.Bluetooth is a great feature that this TV has. I can place my receiver in standby (bypass mode) and listen to TV at night with my wireless blutooth headset. I will take a quick moment to endorse this headset LG Tone - HBS-700 Wireless Bluetooth Stereo Headset - Retail Packaging - Black/Orange. They work flawlessly on everyting I throw at them from working out, talking on the phone while driving to listening to a TV show while eating a midnight snack. They are ultra comfortable and sound excellent. At any rate, I am unsure why this feature gets such little attention. But keep in mind that you do need to verify that your AVR will pass through sound via HDMI or there will be no sound at all when the AVR is off or in standby mode. This is assuming that you pass your content through a receiver. You can't fault the tv if no sound is getting to it.I have had many high end TVs over the years but this one takes the cake for me as an overall package. No offence to anyone intended, but you could not pay me to place an LED TV in my living room. Sure the Sharp Elite looks great head on, but try going off to an angle, and not even an extreme angle and watch the PQ fall off a cliff. Looking at a plasma from any angle is like looking through a window. Not to mention that motion is far more natural looking on plasma in general.As far as sound is concerned, I personally place very little time in this area. Many people may use the built in speakers for night viewing. I would say that these speakers are quite capable for that purpose. If you are looking for this TV to have a capable 24/7 sound system, then you will probably be let down with this and pretty much any other flat screen offering. If you are going to lay down the funds for this beauty, you should also be ready to invest in a descent sound system if you do not already have one.*** Amended 3D glasses info.Considering how passionate some folks seem to be about the exclusion of 3D glasses, I will only say this: This set does not come with 3D glasses. I am fine with that. You may not be.Now lets talk about breaking in your plasma and some of the myths that go along with that. Many people will religiously use what are called break-in slides for the first 100 hours that they own the television. There are good reasons for this and there are misguided reasons as well. These slides are full screen color slides that you would run at 100 contrast for 100 hours as a slide show. This allows the phosphors to age evenly in there more fragile and impressionable state that is the first 100-200 hours. Now it is just as reasonable to simply watch mixed content for the first 100 hours instead of using slides. You just want to be sure to avoid letter box material or leaving stations on with static logos for long periods of times. The only downside of using content instead of slides is if you plan on using offered calibrated settings from someone like D-Nice on AVS. He has been kind enough in the past to offer calibrated settings to folks in an attempt to help out the community. He will break-in a set with the slides and then calibrate it. He will then post these settings for others to get at least close to a calibrated look. The best way to mimic his results is to break-in your set with the slides as he did. He will also be the first to tell you that panels vary and you may or may not benefit from his offered settings. If you do not use the slides as he did, then you will have less of a chance of benefiting from his settings because the panel will have been aged on a far less consistent scale. At this point in time, D-Nice has not posted settings for this particualr set. So keep this in mind, as there are questions as to whether or not he will at all.Personally, I am not using slides anymore other than for use to inspect my panel for problems. Nobody wants to have a brand new set off limits for 4 days. I know I don't. This time round, I have not used slides and all is well in the world. If I want to get the set calibrated, I will.Running slides in the hopes of matching the exact characteristics of someone elses panel is a gamble that may or may not pay off, and how would you really know if you were getting the most out of these \"Free\" settings without meters and training to tell you?But, it is fair to say that you will have the least chance for any type of IR in the first 100+ hours by running the slides. There are no logos or bars or HUDs to worry about. I stress the point that they will not CAUSE IR but they will not help remove it. So it is a personal choice and there is most definately no reason not to run the slides other than it makes the set unavailable for 4 days.As a side note, these slides are excellent tools to inspect your new screen for issues such as dead or stuck pixels, micro cracks in the glass and hot spots or uniformity issues. The trick here is to use this tool when you get your set and then leave it alone. If you constantly use these slides to look for issues, you will eventually find one and it will drive you crazy. And in most cases it will end up being something that you will never see while viewing normal content.Slides can be downloaded by searching for \"Plasma Break-In DVD Images\" . Just select the \"Plasma Break-In DVD Images\" link. Once downloaded, unzip and place on thumb drive.So there you have it regarding break-in. Use slides or mixed content for the first 100 hours or so and relax.One more thing worth mentioning to those that are unaware. The picture on your set will continue to improve over the first 300+ hours. So please do not base your impression of the set on the picture that comes out of the box. Blacks settle in a touch lower and the picture quality in general will become a bit richer and vibrant.Another common misconception is that slides should be used to help remove IR or image retention. This is simply not the case.Here is an excerpt of something I wrote on AVS:You will never be told to use slides to remove IR. Breakin slides are for breaking in the panel, period. Think about it this way. If you look at your IR while running the slides, you will see that the IR is flashing exactly the same each time. You are simply baking the IR in as far as I am concerned. You are maintaining that exact image over and over again. Now start a pixel flipper or mixed content for that matter. In this case, every pixel involved within the area of the IR is being given it own unique workout independent from the surrounding pixels. This random aging of the pixels will allow the offending pixels involved within the area of IR to hopefully slowly blend in better with the surrounding pixels.Sure, there is an anti-retention tool that is built into the sets software, but do not let that fool you into a false sense of security. If you leave on a station with a static logo for two days straight, the tool will do no more than make the edges of the logo image blurry rather than defined.I should also mention that I have had no hint of IR on my set to date (besides on slides). This is after days of watching Discovery channel who is one of the worst offenders of the infamous logo. They should be sued with other channels that wreak havoc on plasmas with these logos. I almost have to think they have stock in LED technology! lolSettings: The following are the settings that I am currently using post Luminance patch. They are a combination of my own and others. I feel I have struck a very nice balance without having had an actual calibration performed. This is in no way intended or claimed to be professional calibrated settings. I would be happy if they work for you though. So it definitely does not hurt to give them a try. If you find colors to be off on your particular panel, simply disregard the Pro settings and only use the Basic settings.Picture Mode: CustomContrast: 82 \"Bright Room\" Setting 98Brightness: 52-54 \"Bright Room\" Setting 70Color: 50Tint: 0Sharpness: 14-24 *If you have an external VP you may want this at zeroColor Temp: Warm 2 (or Warm 1) * Warm 1 will not be as accurate, but you may prefer it anyway as it will spruce up the whites a touch.Cats: OffVideo NR: OffAspect adjustments submenuScreen format: FullHD size: Size 2 (Size 1 will perform a 95% overscan.

All plasmas buzz....period. It is an inherent aspect of the technology. A perfect way to  hear how this buzzing is effected by what is on the screen is by using the slides we talked about. Typically, the buzzing will be loudest on an all white or very bright screen. As you flip through the different colored slides, you will notice the buzzing changing in its intensity. Now some sets will obviously buzz more than others. You may have two identical sets that are side by side and one may be louder than the other. So if you have a set that you feel buzzes too much for you, an exchange may be in order. But be ready for no change, less noise and possibly more noise. But please do not base your impression while you are standing in a silent room with your head behind the TV. Listen to the TV sitting in your normal viewing location with volume at what you would consider \"normal\" or slightly below that. Then see if you can even hear it at all. Personally, I have to have my volume very low to hear it at all. Under my normal listening conditions, I NEVER hear my set buzz. There are many other factors involved that can contribute to the buzzing. Some of which include proximity of TV to the surrounding walls, room acoustics, sensitive hearing, furniture in the room, carpet, etc.....I hope this information helps you in your decision. I know the feeling of being overwhelmed when you are are trying to make an educated choice amid a sea of conflicting information.When all is said and done, I feel great about my purchase and highly recommend the television.TopperMcFlyUpdate 07/31/2012:Panasonic has released another update. This update resolves the issue with CMS color Luminance not functioning. ;-)Picture settings are reflected and noted above.Update 08/19/2012:In order to put minds at ease, I begrudgingly put the colored slides up after about 750 hours of use to see if I have any IR. I expected to at least see some minor IR but the fact is that I have ZERO IR! If you are worried about IR, stop. Follow my instructions and advice and it will be a non-issue.And btw, my picture quality has steadily improved over the entire 700+ hours it has been running. What a gem.", "Date": "May 30, 2012"}, {"Title": "Sets the new high bar for home television", "Author": "Brandon", "ReviewID": "R1AL8VR2KT5MCF", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Pilot freight services delivered my unit May 8th, 3-days sooner than advertised. While I was apprehensive about set-up, an HDMI (not included) and power cord were all that was needed to start watching programs through my receiver.  I'm a big guy, so hefting the TV onto its base wasn't such an ordeal, but I will note that most people will need help with this chore. I opted not to put it on the wall due to its weight and my living room's space restrictions (not to mention the extra price/non-availability of a wall bracket). The pedestal required a Philips screwdriver to construct and does not swivel in the slightest. Upgrading to 65-inches, I don't miss that feature.The viewing experience is as advertised. Out of the box, the VT50 is set very dark. Unless the unit will be placed in a home theater, you will need to use a custom or the \"THX Bright Room\" setting. At any setting, however, you will note the incredible degree to which blacks are displayed. I tested some modifications while watching a MLB game broadcast in HD. Its difficult to describe the \"new\" shades of black and grey that I could discern on this set, but I can say that I never saw them before. Every detail that I thought of or tried to see was simply: there. The one sheet of glass addition is gorgeous, though when the TV is on it kind of disappears. Simply put, I've never seen a better looking plasma display.VIERA functionality is running wirelessly and almost seamlessly through my Netgear N900. Every app I've tried (I'm not a subscriber to anything like Netflix, so I don't know how well pay apps function) loads quickly. The on board browser is ever so slightly slower than one on a dated laptop I've got, but every web-page loaded without issue. I found streaming videos from a networked PC not to work unless I ran them from a my X-box 360. I can only assume that this is a codec issue.The speakers are \"Meh\". At this level of monitor, you better already have standalone speakers running through an amp or your missing out. Form factor-wise, the included speakers and woofer melt into the VT50's body. Frankly, I wouldn't have known they were there had I not read the specs. Additionally, and this probably can be attributed to my Pioneer receiver or an HDMI bug, you cannot listen to the set's speakers and your externals at the same time.The touch-remote is a nice addition, but responsiveness and fine movement leave a little to be desired. It's not a laptop/ipad... er, pad. I've got an android smart phone that quickly synched with the VT50 and functions better during internet browsing. Media transfer from the TV to the phone was a button click away, however, going the other way around has escaped me for the moment. Attempts to \"flick\" a pic or .mov from my phone all end in a triangle inset with an \"!\" on the TV. There's probably a work around, but I'm a little disappointed it didn't work out of the box.On the disappointment front, I feel obligated to express mine at the lack of 3D glasses included at purchase. I knew that going in, but never the less, it still stings not to have the ability to test such a significant function of the VT50. At around $3,800 I think I've earned at least one pair. Additionally, don't let some idiot at your local big-box store attempt to sell you last years glasses (not that this happened to me, even though it did). The VT30 & VT50 are incompatible.Finally, I live in Colorado and my front door opens at 6,170 feet-ish. My previous plasma was built in 2003 and did not like this altitude. It ran hot and buzzed incessantly. 15-min of use and you can feel the heat escaping the top of the VT50's rear vents with a wave of your hand. It doesn't heat my living room after being on for an hour or buzz at all like my previous set, but I'll be sure to update this review if anything changes. Panasonic's own tech support sent me an email before I purchased it, ensuring me the all their plasmas were rated to 8,000ft, and a local specialist told me that I'd be safe up to 11,000ft.To be clear: I took a star off my review due to the lack of included glasses at this price. It's like buying a pick-up truck and being told that the lever/toggle switch for your included 4-wheel drive is an extra. Bad marketing Panasonic, bad.  Other than that, and the odd Android functionality, I cannot recommend this Plasma any more than if I were to post a picture of me hugging it. The P65VT50 is truly fantastic.  While I cannot speak for a comparison between this set an a comparable LED, I would figure the LED to be brighter. But if you do most of your TV watching at night, as I do, I'd stick with the Plasma.", "Date": "May 9, 2012"}, {"Title": "A triumph in design and image quality", "Author": "jordan", "ReviewID": "R18YEZWUKEF4ZT", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "My VT50 arrived a little over two weeks ago and I feel that I'm now familiar enough with it to write a review. This review is for the 55\" model.The VT50 replaced my 50\" G-Series Panasonic plasma from 2010.  While I liked it just fine, it was a tiny bit too small, had a bezel that got uglier over time, and suffered from floating blacks, which was very annoying since my primary use of the display is watching Blu-Ray content in the dark.  I had been anxiously awaiting the release of the VT50 - so much so, that I ordered one without seeing it first, reasoning to myself that if I didn't like it, then I wouldn't be satisfied with any TV this year.The VT50 arrived.  Once unpacked and set up, I marveled at the TV before I even turned it on.  Was this TV really made by Panasonic, the company known for being helplessly behind the competition is terms of industrial design?  The svelte single sheet of glass design is beautiful.  The VT50 takes the design introduced with last year's clunky VT30 and trims it down to perfection.  The bezel is much smaller than Samsung's E7/8000 and much more attractive in my opinion.  It features a nice silver trim around the edges and a classy stand with a silver/black gradient.  I can see how the silver edge might be a problem in a very bright room, but I really like it.But design is secondary, isn't it?  Picture quality is why anyone buys a flagship model and the VT50 more than delivers. Panasonic has made major improvements over 2011 models, with a new driving method, redesigned panel, and improved filter. Once initial set-up is done, the TV defaults to standard mode, which looks awful - dull and lifeless with egregious line bleed.  Thankfully there's an easy fix - this a THX certified display, and new for 2012 Panasonic includes two separate THX modes for 2D viewing - THX Cinema and THX Bright Room.  These modes look great out of the box.  THX Cinema is what I mainly watch with, although I sometimes use Bright Room mode, albeit with contrast scaled back to 80.  Compared to the THX mode on my last Panasonic, the mode here is much improved and lacks the greenish push that I noticed before.  I think rather than try to eyeball it, since I'm not a calibrator, I'm going to leave it in THX mode sans any adjustment and pay someone to calibrate it later this year.  Compressed satellite HD actually looks surprisingly great, image processing is top notch here and is good at masking artifacts from less-than-stellar feeds.  Definitely better than my old Panny.  The picture also has a characteristic that is hard to describe - perhaps \"smoother\" is the word I'm looking for here; it just looks incredibly natural and effortless in subtle color transitions and gradients.  I suppose that can be attributed to Panasonic's claim of improved shades of gradation.The real test, however, was when I turned off the lights and fired up the Blu-Ray player.  The home menu on my Sony Blu-Ray player is a light gray, which is great for testing panels for flaws in uniformity.  Knowing problems with banding, blobbing, and splotching Panasonic had with last year's model, I nervously inspected every part of the panel.  No anomalies to be found, whew.  I pressed play and ended up sampling a variety of content, and the VT muscled through all of it with incredible prowess.  The black level here is impressive - I've seen a VT30 in the dark and this rightfully trounces it. I've also seen an E8000 in the dark and it can't get quite as dark as the VT.  Letterbox bars blend into the bezel.  Thanks to the deep, dark blacks the VT50 is blessed with incredible contrast.  Images have an abundance of pop and lifelike depth, and recall the tangible realism produced by later-generation Pioneer plasma panels.  Motion is natural, cinematic, and artifact-free when the 4:4 pulldown 96Hz mode is engaged.  I do not notice any flicker either.  It should also be noted that I have watched enough on it to verify that the image is rock-solid - no floating blacks, fluctuating brightness, no distractions. Just a beautifully rendered, film-like image that pulls you in.3D performance: Using THX Cinema 3D mode, the 3D image looks great.  This is the first 3D TV I've owned but I've seen plenty of 3D on other flat panels and some projectors.  96Hz is unavailable here.  Great sense of depth  and minimal crosstalk, although I do notice some in higher contrast scenes.  This can be somewhat remedied by switching from 60 to 48Hz mode, but it introduces some annoying flicker.  I tested using Blu-Ray content like Ultimate Wave Tahiti 3D, Hugo, Tron:Legacy, Arabia 3D, and the Adventures of Tintin 3D.  2D>3D conversion is still unimpressive, even after making 3D adjustments, but I suppose it's not too bad considering the display is doing the conversion on the fly.  Not a big deal.  Please note that Panasonic does not include glasses in the box for North American sets this year.  Yeah, it's a bummer, but the good news is that this year Samsung's cheap SSG-4100 glasses are fully operational with the VT50.  I own a pair and a pair of the official Panasonic-made TY-ER3D4MU glasses, and performance is identical, although I find the Panasonic glasses have bigger lenses and are more comfortable.One thing I did not test much is the Viera Connect platform.  I poked around a bit, and it seems largely identical to the interface on my BDT310 Blu-Ray player but with the addition of the web browser.  Since the VT50 has a dual-core processor it is quite a bit snappier loading apps and navigating between them, however.  Panasonic includes a touchpad remote to make web browsing easier but I found it a bit awkward to use, and while the web browser is decent, I don't see myself ever using it.  I don't want to browse the web on my TV, but for those that do, it's not bad.So while I generally try to shy away from giving products five-star reviews, I have a hard time finding anything bad to say about the VT50.  The only thing I can really knock it for is the anti-glare filter - while it's incredibly effective, it does compromise the vertical viewing angle of the TV. I'm assuming it functions by absorbing ambient light from above and below the panel and rejecting it, resulting in a darkened image from above or below.  The horizontal viewing angle is not compromised, so I certainly don't think it's worth taking a point away, especially considering that neither I nor anybody I know watches TV sitting below the screen or standing above it.All told, the VT50 is, simply put, the best plasma Panasonic has ever made, and represents more than a minor improvement over the VT30. Panasonic has set the bar not only for themselves, but has left Samsung in the dust this year.  While Panasonic focused on drastically improving image quality this year, Samsung seems content with making minor improvements while adding a camera and frustratingly stupid gesture control to their plasmas.  Highly recommended!", "Date": "May 24, 2012"}, {"Title": "Excellent Plasma- Comcast almost made me return this", "Author": "Michael J. Christensen", "ReviewID": "R380ZV8HCZUMT3", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Prior to purchasing this set, I was fortunate enough to own the PZ700 50\" Panasonic Plasma from 2007, which Consumer Reports named the best flat panel TV they ever tested.  I loved this set, but after reading some overwhelmingly positive reviews and a sweet price point from Amazon, I decided to take the plunge.  Certainly not an easy decision, given my love for the PZ700.  After some early frustrations, I can say without question, the upgrade was a worthy one.So what has Panasonic done right with their flagship plasma series in the last five years?  Here's my take:First the obvious; the set is a lot lighter!  My old Panny was a monster clocking in at just under 100 lbs, but this one weighs about 66lbs with the stand.  The set has a very elegant look with a black border that is about an inch wide, and a silver bezel on the outside which is about a quarter of an inch.  On the back, the set sports inputs for 4 HDMI, 3 USB, 1 PC, and 1 component/analog input.  There's also inputs for cable coax, digital audio out, and ethernet.  Interesting how Panasonic has completely de-prioritized the component/analog settings.  My old set had 3, this has one.  Also, if you use a component cable, Panasonic has included an adapter which you plug all 5 cables into, with a tiny plug that goes to the TV.  Certainly a con to take note of if you have a lot of component/analog devices.Video is a nice step forward; additional detail in high def viewing is readily apparent; imperfections on people's faces can be seen with much greater clarity; blacks, while very good on the PZ700, are much inkier and darn near perfect now.  Colors are accurate and pop in a way my older, dimmer set could not. Let me mention my favorite enhancement; the set is MUCH better than my old one at shielding glare.  I have a tall lamp in the corner of my house that I refuse to move.  Problem is, it situates itself on the top right corner of the screen.  While I can still see it through the TV, the glare is reduced to such a level that I don't even notice it's there most of the time.3D viewing: a nice feature, but still pretty gimmicky (and costly).  Not a lot of adult content out there, as most 3D movies are kids movies.  I have viewed 3D versions of Avatar and Toy Story 3, and although the set does a commendable job, I do find 3D viewing to be a bit straining on the eyes.  Certainly not a fault of the set, as it produces a quality 3D image, but I don't believe 3D will truly take off until manufacturers find a way to ditch the glasses.  It also doesn't help that Panasonic does not include any glasses here, and they're $50 a pop.Audio: quite frankly, not as good as my previous set.  Some reviewers have complained about it sounding a bit tunnel-like, and while listening to some baseball broadcasts, I would agree; but overall, I think it sounds respectable.  It's a speaker/size trade-off; in order to keep a slim profile, Panasonic needed to install smaller speakers.  My old set had around 3 inches of black space on each side to accommodate the larger speakers- this one has just over an inch on each side.  I believe the tv speakers fill my room quite nicely, but I have a small place.  Those with larger living room environments will surely want to complement with some home theater.Ok, let me get my Comcast detesting rant out of the way.  Those who are blessed and do not use Comcast, feel free to skip this paragraph.  I hook up three devices to my set -a Comcast DVR, Panny Blu-Ray, and PS3, all via HDMI.  However, I would say about 80% of my viewing is for cable.  That said, I was having some serious buyer's remorse with this set, later determining it was of course, Comcast's fault.  When I first set this up, I was primarily watching cable.  And my early impressions were dwelling on an inconsistent image.  Still pictures with little movement looked amazing.  But a number of background images either looked blurry or pixelated, and motion fluidity was less than desirable.  An analogy would liken this to my brief stint in PC gaming; buying a computer with a great display and video card, but with no processing power to move the action along as it pushes the CPU.  Long story short, cable viewing was a big step down from my old set, which was previously connected via component.  But alas, I started to get wise, because when I watched blu-ray in 1080p, there was nary a picture problem to be found.  With the aid of some Google research, I came up with the following for Comcast users who connect via HDMI: power your DVR off, then press the menu button.  Go to \"HDMI/YPbPr Output\" and change to 720p.  That's it, problem solved on cable viewing!  No more pixelation or focus issues.  The downside, of course, is that you're no longer viewing the maximum resolution your new TV can accept.  But in my humble opinion, 720p looks nearly as good as 1080p, and certainly better when the Comcast crapbox is involved.Some more setup pointers.  When adjusting your picture settings, use Custom.  The presets like THX bright room can give you a decent start, but if you like to do some armchair calibrating, use Custom.  What I painfully discovered, is that even if you have the same settings on two different modes (i.e. THX Cinema and THX Bright Room), the picture will look drastically different!  If you want to experiment, adjust THX Cinema to have the same exact picture settings as THX Bright Room; you'll discover that THX Cinema will still have a much dimmer image.I don't mess with the additional picture settings too much, but I'd recommend changing these two:  change HD size to \"Size 2\" from Aspect Adjustments as this will display the entire image.  Also, I recommend going to Advanced Picture and adjusting the motion smoother down to \"weak.\"  Panny states that this setting reduces motion blur, but I was having some movement stuttering problems with this setting on medium.Finally, a word on Viera Connect.  This set has built-in wireless internet for viewing \"channels\" such as Amazon, Netflix, MLB TV, Skype, and Facebook.  I have checked out the first three mentioned and the performance is pretty good.  I like that Panasonic has updated this set with a respectable processor, as navigating around Netflix and Amazon VOD is much snappier than their dreadfully slow blu ray players.  A word for those with dual band routers.  My experience has been that this set will show BOTH bands when you do a scan for wireless network.  And my unprofessional diagnosis is that when your router decides to use the other band (as mine frequently does), the Panny will drop your current connection, and you will be forced to select the other band (and re-enter a password if your network is encrypted).  Once I connect and use a channel, streaming works very well, but if I exit Viera and try to come back in, I get a connection error message.  Feel free to contact Panny support on this one, but after harassing them, I've been told it's a known issue; the set needs to figure out that there's two bands, but one network, and accommodate them simultaneously; hopefully, this will be addressed in short order with a firmware update.Kudos to Panasonic for offering flagship quality performance at a competitive price point.  Sound and Viera Connect quibbles aside, the VT50 offers superior value.Edit: thanks to all for your Comcast suggestions. I understand many of you have a decent 1080p setup. I actually have a newer model DVR, model # RNG200N that Paul mentioned. I'd be interested to hear from other users with this box, and whether you have a video beef when 1080p resolution is used.

To replace it I ended up buying a Panasonic TC-P55VT50, which at the time was exactly double the price of the LG. I had never owned a plasma before and I wouldn't normally have considered one, but as I researched which TV to buy I consistently saw reviewers saying that this TV had the best picture quality of any TV on the market. And they were right.This TV produces the best-looking picture that I have ever seen on any TV anywhere, period. I am not talking about subtle differences that only a pro would notice--it is a completely different viewing experience. Despite all the research that I did, I did not really appreciate the difference until I had the TV in my living room. Basically, when you watch a movie on this TV, you are seeing it the way it was intended to look. The colours are vibrant without looking fake, the black looks black instead of dark grey, and there is no motion blur at all. In many ways it recreates the picture of a movie theatre. My Sony XBR4 that I used to think highly of now looks washed-out and dull to me. The Panasonic's 3D--the feature that I actually bought the TV for--is also amazing (I only rarely see crosstalk or flicker) and also the best on the market according to some experts, but its high quality is overshadowed by how impressive the overall picture quality is compared to competing TVs.Another reviewer mentioned that he disliked this TV because the whites weren't bright enough. It is true that the whites are not as bright as on an LCD, but I LIKE the way they look. In the real world, white objects do not have an otherworldly glow like the bright white of an LCD screen, so when you see those objects in a movie they shouldn't look like that either.Drawbacks? There is really only one major one, which is that this TV does not work very well as a computer monitor. The reason is that to prevent image retention (a.k.a. burn-in) it chops off 5% from the edges of the screen, which is where all of the important buttons and icons are on a computer desktop. You can disable this feature, but that makes the TV very susceptible to image retention, so it's not a good idea. So if you are planning to use your TV as a computer monitor then this TV is probably not a good choice for you.

I'm used to a really good picture and thats what I crave. If you've had an average TV for years and are replacing that, you're going to be impressed by just about any of the TV's I mention here and in fact probably going to be just has happy with models lower down the food chain. Lucky you. In some ways I wish my eyeball 'tastebuds' had never gotten used to the sweet nectar that is a really great TV. If you look at any TV and really like the picture, buy it, forget reviews and price. However, if like me, you are really fussy about picture quality, read on.So it was with a heavy heart and much scepticism of the current TV market that I found myself having to wade through online reviews, interviewing retail sales people and talking to tech savvy friends who had kept an eye on the market, that I finally narrowed it down to a few contenders. Of course I started where I had left off, with Sony (i bought Sony's first 1080p TV and it was a dream TV, had to sell it when I moved from the UK). I took a long hard look at the XBR series which they claimed was there \"best picture ever\". I hadn't seen my old Sony in a few months when I went into various stores with well setup examples to look at it, but it only took a couple of minutes of viewing for me to disagree with the Sony marketing team, it wasn't as smooth or 'creamy' as my old X series was, and it just didn't look as 'believable' and the fact that I could notice it just started bugging me. Moving on.Next up, I really liked the look of the Samsung e8000 (the 9000 was too big for me) its a pretty TV, but it took a whole 2 seconds of looking at the picture to figure out - no way. I really don't understand how anyone who has spent any time with decent quality TV's can look at that picture and not be quite frankly disturbed. It's just not even close, it's quite inferior to other TV's at the same price range. Lots of toys doesn't make a better picture and its the picture that matters most, right?Onto the Sharp. I'd always had a soft spot for the old Pioneer Kuro, and if you believe what you read the Kuro team was absorbed into Sharp and they benefited from the technology. Certainly the Kuro was the only other TV that I ever looked at beside my Sony and thought 'nice picture'. So surely the Sharp Elite would have it. It cost more than the XBR or Samsung, which while not always a guarantee of better quality is generally a good indicator. I was impressed, it looked good. But just good. Maybe I was expecting too much? I really was hoping to be just sucked into a picture and so blown away that I couldn't be torn from the TV, that I would just hand over the cheque book and have them fill it in while i continued to watch. I just wasn't seeing where the extra money had gone. But I didn't cry, no, I remained strong. It was good enough, I could always 'settle' if need be and I could learn to be happy. But I had one chance left..I'd kind of dismissed Plasma, I'd just assumed things had moved on technology wise and it'd all be LED, so I was intrigued by all the great reviews the Panasonic was getting, as it was actually cheaper than the TV's I had been looking at it, I kind of thought I was being silly, but what the heck, right? Can't do any harm to take a look.And to my surprise, what I saw was really good. I still wasn't 'blown away', but I kept looking, and looking, and checking. I was looking for the flaws, there must be something wrong with it, it's cheaper. And there must be something wrong with it being a plasma, it must have flashing, or burn in or some other defect. But after 10 minutes or so, I realised I was just happily watching the movie now and not really thinking about the picture any more - bingo! And so it was with my TV buying experience. I have come to realise that looking to be wowed by a TV now is just not realistic if you're used to good TV's. Technology continues to improve, but it's not like the HD TV's now are ten times better than the ones from a few years ago, it's just incremental.However, having lived with the Panasonic for a number of months now, I am really happy with it. Not only is it really 'easy' to watch, it's nice to use, the controls are simple but effective, the hulu and amazon apps give a great picture, the TV itself looks really great.The one down side I have found with ALL TV's now, is that because they are so thin, which I love, it does mean the built in sound is pretty sketchy. It's ok. But if you are any kind of AV purist you're not going to rely on TV speakers anyway, so i do think it's a bit of a moot point. I don't really count the TV's audio quality in my factoring, if anything not investing in the TV's audio is a good thing as I want the money in the picture.So I do think this TV is not only one of the very best pictures available today at any (realistic) price (I don't count the 'tens of thousands of dollars' TV's as I didn't even look at them, I'm not spending that much on a TV), it also represents by FAR the best 'bang for the buck'. I would have happily spent twice as much if a TV _really_ justified it, but I'm happy to say I don't think there is a need, Panasonic have really gotten it right with this panel, it's a TV you can really live with and enjoy.PS. Do what the others here suggest and buy a setup DVD and invest the time to fine tune it. BUT use the THX setting out of the box and watch it for at least a week first, THEN do the setup. It's pointless doing the setup when it's brand new. And yes, it's a Plasma so it DOES get 'burn in'. I use the intune app to listen to radio and it left a logo in the top of the screen after many many hours of use, only faint, but really annoying. But I used the built-in scrolling bar tool a few times and by the next day it was gone, back to fresh.PPS. I bought my TV from Pauls TV in California. Their salesmen are slimy and I wish I hadn't, once I had made a decision I just had to have it that day, and Pauls did get me that, but the delivery guys were not really into it and offered only minimal assistance, I really wanted proper setup. They talk about matching prices but they really didn't try with this TV, and then only added sales tax on right as they swiped my card, which meant a different price came up on the checkout till than we had discussed - which was just underhand to me. Amazon is a better deal and you pay the price it actually says at check-out. I have bought sooo much stuff from Amazon and they have always been amazing not only with delivery but if there are any issues.

Song", "ReviewID": "R23ZHA7636ZWCS", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "*** FYI, I have included a 1-year ownership update at the end of the review.Before I begin, it may be helpful if I quickly summarize what I believe to be true in comparing a plasma and LCD. This way, you have an idea of where I'm coming from. In short: plasma has more natural color reproduction, better black levels, no motion blur, greater viewing angle, and better light uniformity. LCD, on the other hand, uses less energy, produces less heat, does not suffer from burn-in/image retention (IR), much brighter picture, and sharper text. Some specific information that I knew about the VT50 before making my purchase: no bundled 3D glasses, expensive, no built-in camera, reflective screen.Here's why I went with the VT50:1) color reproduction, like other plasmas, is fantastic. Blacks are extremely dark, and I read many reviews mentioning the great black levels of the VT50.2) the front glass panel is beautiful. GT50 and ST50 do not look as clean.3) my room is not very bright, so I do not need a light torch of a display.4) support for 24fps -- I watch a lot of movies.5) the reviews have been very very good, and having owned a Panasonic projector in the past, I've had good experiences with Panasonic equipment.I purchased the TV from Amazon, so with included Enhanced Delivery, getting this up and running was a breeze. It's beautiful, and it delivers on its promise of displaying an excellent picture. I was a little worried about burn-in, but I have yet to see any kind of image retention. While I do watch channels with those stupid static logos and play games with static images, I take breaks and am conscious about leaving a static image up for more than 10-15 minutes. I'm quite happy with the set, but there is some room for improvement.Five things I would have liked:1) navigating the 'smart' feature is a little slow. This is a common complaint I have across the board (Samsung, LG, etc). I wish it were as responsive as, say, an iPad.2) it'd be nice to easily get to the Scrolling bar anti image retention feature (it's deeply buried in the menu system).3) yes, it's clear this set does not come with 3D glasses, but really? At this price-point, it should come with 3D glasses or at least vouchers for 3D glasses.4) would have been nice to have some kind of cable management built into the back of the set.5) no headphone jack (with DAC) on the set, only support for Bluetooth headset.With that said, so far so good! Even the sound is remarkably clear -- caveated with 'for built-in TV speakers'. Only time will tell if image retention is an issue or black levels rise over time. Both are supposedly fixed, but we'll see!Other helpful notes:- I noticed that my TV was leaning to the left when using the included stand, i.e. the left side of the panel was lower than the right side of the panel. It turns out this can be adjusted by loosening the four screws that hold the stand to the panel (the last four screws that are tightened in the instructions on page 9). I slightly loosened the screws, then moved the panel slightly until I measured each side to be even. Then tightened.- It may not be completely obvious that under the Menu -> Picture adjustments, there are more options after Sharpness. One option that I find annoying is C.A.T.S., which adjusts brightness and gradation based on ambient lighting.- The rear fan is inaudible from a foot away from the panel. I could only hear it if I put my head in the back of the panel. Also, I hear no humming coming from the TV, so if you experience this, you may have a defective unit or a ground loop.*** UPDATE (1 YEAR LATER)It's been one year since I received this TV, so I can give a little more detail on the ownership experience. I have never once experienced any buzzing with this TV. Permanent burn-in? No problems. HOWEVER, this set does retain images for days if you abuse it. I know this because I played a video game (Dishonored) that had static images on the screen. It certainly retained the image for several days. I ran several cycles of color cycling videos across 24 hours, and although it helped a lot, I could still barely make out some images. I thought I was doomed by my mistake, but luckily, over time, the image went away on its own.I also would like to say that the sound is not as \"remarkably clear\" as I once thought. It's certainly good enough for a small, quiet room, but it is lacking. I am continuously finding myself increasing the volume during certain parts of movies and TV shows. I am looking into adding a soundbar in the future, but something of interest if you're in my situation: audio out passed from an external HDMI source and back out via HDMI (ARC) is not passed through unaltered. It is mixed down to stereo. For example if you were considering using the VT50 as a HDMI switcher, had a PS3 connected to HDMI-1, and wanted to use HDMI-2 (ARC) to connect a soundbar, anything coming from the PS3, such as 5.1, would be converted to PCM 2.0 and sent to the soundbar. It would not be 5.1.

Simply put, it was flawless: the delivery occurred precisely at the time stated, the television was unpackaged (to confirm no cracks or other visible damage), turned on (to confirm that it worked and that all pixels were firing).  This is the second television in this price range that I have purchased from Amazon, and both experiences have been excellent.  I would not be surprised if every other TV I buy going forward will come from Amazon.With respect to the TV itself, the housing of the television is aesthetically pleasing.  In an ideal world, there would not have been the metal strip around the bezel, but I understand that Panasonic has to dress up their flagship model to differentiate it from the ST50 and the GT50.  They wanted to give the television a sense of occasion, and I get that.  At the end of the day, it is not very noticeable and is not really an issue.  The one-sheet-of-glass design looks great and really makes the television look impressive, even when it's not powered on.  The profile of the TV is also very thin and sleek.  All in all, it makes a fine aesthetic addition to any room.The real question, of course, is how is the picture?  The picture is beautiful.  My last television was a Pioneer Kuro 6020, and so my review of the VT50 is basically a comparison of the two sets.  I cannot A/B them side by side because the Kuro stayed with a house I just sold (the buyer smartly insisted on keeping the Kuro as part of his full-price offer on my house, so I couldn't say no), but, working off memory, I think the VT50 compares favorably to that most legendary of television sets.  Does it match the Kuro's picture?  Honestly, I don't think I can say it does.  There was just something very special about the Kuro's black levels, its detail, its ability to both present a natural picture that also had \"pop.\"  The VT50 comes very close to this, and I would say it's about 95% there.  The Panasonic's blacks are excellent, and the colors are vibrant and natural.  Echoing a previous review on this page, I agree that a bright room does present a glare challenge for this TV, and my room unfortunately places a wall of windows facing the TV.  I will keep the VT50, however, because I mainly watch TV at night and I just hate LED/LCD televisions (it's just a personal preference).  I think one can believe the hype that the VT50 provides the best overall picture of 2012.

This is a good TV, and I am mostly satisfied with it.  I initially purchased an edge-lit Samsung LED, which has a more \"pop\" vivid picture, but I don't feel the edge-lit technology is where it needs to be when you are watching dark movies (flashlighting on the sides of the screen, in many models it is very noticeable).  I ended up switching back to a plasma and am happy with this choice, it is a very rich, deep picture.  If you are in a super bright room, there can be a glare as this screen is super glossy.  We had to buy a new, more diffused lamp and that helped immensely.Here's the gripe, and you may call it a small one - the advertising.  There is a banner ad pop-up that appears when you turn the TV on and there is another ad when you go into the Viera Connect application (which is how you access internet, Netflix, etc).  The banner ad on start up can be turned off deep within the menu, thankfully.  However, the ad in the Connect menu can't be disabled or moved, it is always right there taking up one of your initial home boxes.Perhaps many people are ok with this, but I have to say it rankles when you spend thousands of dollars on a product and then have a section of your Connect home screen taken up by an ad.  I can understand advertising when you're paying nothing or next to nothing for something.  But this seems so shameless and irritating when considering the cost of this product.  I know this will annoy some more than others, but had I known about this in advance, I may well have purchased another TV.  I hate advertising and try to avoid as much as humanly possible (a foolish endeavor, I know).Also, good luck deciding you don't want to update the TV software at the particular moment it wants to.  It forces you to perform the update the second you connect to the internet.  It's pretty quick (maybe 10 minutes), but heaven forbid you don't want it to update.

I called my girlfriend into the room and said \"Hey honey, check out this picture.\" At the time, the TV was sitting on the floor while I was setting up my home theater. She knelt next to me and we ended up watching the ENTIRE MOVIE on our knees on the hardwood floor. It was hypnotizing.I just can't get over it. It's like looking at a moving high-resolution photograph. You have to see it to believe it. Or just all read the other rave reviews.I suggest going to the AVS VT50 Settings forum and trying out some of the settings listed there, or going to CNET or Home Theater Magazine and trying those settings. One of them should make your display look fantastic. Or get it professionally calibrated. For a TV of this stature, don't just use the out of the box settings. It would be a waste.My only gripe is I did notice some very very minor non-uniformity in the whites, and when playing Journey on PS3 I noticed some light blotchiness in solid color backgrounds, but the non-uniformity is pretty much inherent in the plasma technology, and the blotchiness was barely noticeable. This is me nitpicking the near-perfect picture.At first I wasn't a fan of the silver bevel but after a few days of having it around a) I barely notice it and b) it's actually quite nice. The plastic stand feels kinda cheap but whatever.Oh and if you notice the picture getting darker as you approach the TV and view the screen from above, that is a result of the filter on the screen that reduces ambient lighting glare. This is normal for this set. I didn't know that when I went to inspect the set at Best Buy, and the clerks there thought it was a shadow from the track lighting. My point is, don't talk to the dopes at Best Buy.You seriously won't find a better TV than this.

Friends bought a high end LCD TV and after watching my TV and then viewing theirs I am happy with my choice but then again so are they. The plasma seems much more film like to me and the colors much more accurate. The picture on the LCD is much brighter but nothing looks natural. That said this TV is amoung the best of Plasma TVs. While less bright than an LCD it is plenty bight even in a brightly lit room during daytime viewing. I was concerned a plasma might be too dim and have too much glare because my TV room has 5 windows some of which are directly opposite the TV. This plasma has minimum glare from the windows and even on a bright day the TV is bright enough to provide a stunning picture. I couldn't imagine a room more challenging than mine for a plasma TV but this plasma is up to the challenge. The TV is loaded with excellent features, all the big streaming services like netflix, youtube, vudu,  etc. however unlike Samsung no HBO Go which I would welcome. Hopefully in the future they upgrade the firmware to include HBO Go. I love the Audio Return Channel HDMI feature which allows the TV to reverse feed the audio from content originating on the TV back to the home theater receiver over the same HDMI cable which the receiver feeds the TV. Both remotes are excellent although I haven't used the touch pad much. I discovered I can use my smartphone as a remote which is very handy when viewing youtube.

The black levels are excellent (as with most plasmas), colors are bright and the picture is crisp.Out of the box Panasonic has some work to do on the initial picture settings as compared to other manufactures. This TV scared me at first, as the initial power on looked extremely dark and dull, not something you want to see right away when spending nearly 4k on a TV! With a little tweaking you can easily get the black level, contrast and color to an acceptable setting which will make the set look fantastic.  After setting the initial levels and using this TV for 100 hours you should get it professionally calibrated for your room. Yes it will cost you $200-$400 depending but when spending this kind of money on such a high performance HD TV you really need to just bite the bullet.Aesthetically the VT50 looks great! It's sleek and has a nice looking stand (doesn't swivel). All the HDMI ports and other ports are on the left side of the TV (if you're facing the front of the TV) and are really close to the edge of the set. Anyone wall mounting might have trouble hiding cables depending on the space behind the TV.This is the only negative you will get from me and ultimately it's the reason I am sending this TV back to Amazon: If you have a bright room or a room with a lot of natural sunlight you will get a glare on the screen and it may seem too dark. I live in a large townhome in an end unit and have 2 large windows and a large sliding glass door. During the day its really frustrating seeing the glare in the screen and feeling like the picture is too dark to watch. Compared to my Samsung LED which this replaced the glare is terrible. Furthermore watching at night I have a lamp on an end table and I can visibly see the reflection of the light from the lamp in the TV. It's for this reason and this reason alone I am not keeping this TV.  When I watch the VT50 at night I am truly blown away by the picture quality!The features on the set are the same as all smart TV's on the market right now, but it doesn't have a camera like the new Samsung's. All the apps are the same and you can download and install whatever you want....The 3D is the best I have seen in any at home TV yet. Far superior to the 3D Samsung has in their LED TV's though I suspect it's just the difference in technology from plasma to LCD.Some people asked about a buzzing sound and I have to be honest. When you step right up to the TV (within 2 ft) you can hear a very quiet buzz. As soon as you walk away you don't hear it at all. It has 2 rear facing fans and depending on your rooms acoustics and if its wall mounted you may hear them run slightly in a completely quiet room. That being said, if you purchased this set you better have surround sound anyway and you will NEVER hear it.The VT50 does get hot when you're watching it. If you stand next to it after some use you will notice the heat. This isn't really a problem unless you're in a small confined space (which you shouldn't be with a TV this large). All plasmas give off heat and take more power to run, it's just the nature of the technology.Lastly a lot of people have been raving about the \"THX Cinema\" and \"THX Dark Room\" video settings on this TV. I honestly feel as though both settings look washed out and lack color. The bright room setting is really bright and in my living room makes the picture look almost grey. I think Panasonic made the bright room setting for people with a lot of light but I can tell you first hand if you have a bright room you don't want this set.Many people may complain that this TV doesn't come with 3D glasses. I personally would rather pay less for a TV and decide if I want to purchase the glasses myself or just not use 3D at all. There really isn't a lot of 3D content and if you're buying 3D blu rays like its xmas you can afford he glasses. Also as a side not the 2012 Samsung 3D glasses do work with the VT50.Bottom line, if you have a lot of light you may want to consider some other options before pulling the trigger.(UPDATE 1: 5/29/12)After about 50-60 hours this thing is really starting to look better and better! I have until the 9th the decide if I am going to keep it but I can tell you that I'm blown away by the quality after letting it settle in a little longer! I will probably keep it. The glare is still a concern but every TV has its caveats, I would much rather have some glare then irregular blacks and hot sports from a edge lit LED.", "Date": "May 22, 2012"}, {"Title": "VT50 King of the Plasmas", "Author": "Cryptkeeper714", "ReviewID": "RRLL5LQ97II5O", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I bought this TV from Amazon about 3-4 weeks ago. I had been looking at getting a new TV since my 6yr old 42\" Philips Plasma wasn't cutting it for me anymore. I almost bought the VT30 but saw all the high praise and reviews from CES 2012, so I decided to wait. While I cannot review on the VT30 the VT50 is an absolutely amazing tv. Before I give my review I would like to mention that the shipping company Amazon used to ship the TV was excellent. They were very careful and took their time opening and showing me that the tv was in perfect condition.Pros:This tv has many pros that have already been discussed. The black levels are incredible. I have not calibrated the tv yet but just using the cinema THX mode, the black levels are very good. I know many people with the Pioneer Elite and Kuros and this TV stands up with them no problem. The color reproduction is clean and not overbearing in the THX mode. In gaming mode the colors are a little too bright. Watching golf in HD with gaming mode the grass looks almost neon. I have watched several video sources including BD, DVD, broadcast TV (SD and HD), Divx, and streaming, and the TV does a fantastic job of scaling. Comparing the Netflix on the TV vs my HTPC the TV streaming Netflix looked alot better than my HTPC. The Viera Connect apps are amusing but nothing I would use regularly. In Full mode I get perfect 1x1 pixel mapping with my HTPC (DVI to HDMI connection) which I never had before with my old Plasma. I must say it looks way better. I can't comment on 3D yet as I do not have glasses but other reviews show that the active shutter technology on this TV works fantastic.Cons:I will just list out some weaknesses as Cons seems to harsh for this TV.-I have my VT50 mounted on the wall and the wireless card seems to not great signal. I lose wireless connectivity sometimes and have to run the connection test to get it back. Once you are using Netflix or something it is stable-For how much this TV costs I would have expected to get atleast a pair of 3D glasses-As others have mentioned the speakers arent the greatest on the TV, but most people I would assume like myself would use a surround sound system of some sort-There is a decent amount of glare on the TV if you have a lot of light in the room. It's not overly distracting but just be aware if you have alot of light or windows in your room-The Viera App for Iphone and Android while it is a cool app, the reliability stinks. It rarely picks up my VT50, but when it does it is pretty cool to be able to sling pics and vids from my Android phone right to the TV.Although not a con it would have been great if they had a wireless adapter for the optical output on the TV. You can connect a Toslink optical cable to the TV out to an AV reciever or soundbar, but if you already had a mount on the wall and cables already ran into wallplates like I did it makes for more of a messy install to run that line.Tip: Just wanted to add this in there as a note. I am using the component input which is an adapter on the TV. The default for the tv sets that to VIDEO and not Component so when I was trying to watch cable it wasnt coming through. They tell you in the instructions how to change that setting in the menu, but for those who dont read the instructions, like myself, that is what you need to change to get Component input to work correctly.This TV has become a perfect edition in my living room and everyone who see's it thinks the picture is amazing.

I understanding styling should not play that much of a factor with the TV compared to performance but it does.  Anyways, I'll keep this short and sweet with a pros and cons list.ProsFantastic picture quality (at night)Very natural colors (this is something I'm sure certain people love but most people kept asking me why the colors seemed so dull)Cool feature that allows you to flick content from your phone to the TV  (more gimmicky but still neat)Deep blacks, some of the best I've ever seenConsScreen is too reflective (I had an idea this might be an issue but I heard the reflectivity had been improved for plasmas)TV is not that bright, even when used on THX bright room mode  (while the TV did get brighter the colors were a little washed out but still don't compare to an LED TV)Styling (while it is great for a plasma, it just can't beat the thin, picture-like frame of a Samsung)Gets really hotDesign of the AC power plug prevents it from being installed close to the wall so it sticks out a good inch+.Don't get me wrong, I understand my main problem is with how my living room is setup and how the TV looks/performs in it.

The TV was created for people who are Videophiles.If you just want to watch your reality TV, and a few other TV shows with an occasional movie here and there then go with LCD-LED TV's. Especially if you want to watch TV in a room with a lot of sunlight. LED and LCD TVs are bright and vivid.If you buy the VT50 because you heard people say its the best TV then you are buying this TV for the wrong reasons. Do your research before you buy this TV. CNET has reviewed it and so has Home Theater Magazine. Both CNET and Home Theater magazine will tell you this is the top Plasma TV on the market, BUT if you buy the VT50 then there are a few things you should know.1. The VT50 should be PROFESSIONALLY calibrated2. The VT50 should be used in a room with few windows with the shades drawn. (black out curtains over the windows are best)3. The VT50 is NOT a LCD-LED TV. It's a THX certified Plasma TV that has been compared to the Pioneer Kuro. (If you don't know what a Kuro is then the features in this TV will be lost on you)4. The built-in speakers are ok, but if you buy this TV you should pair it with a THX Certified A/V receiver (i.e. Pioneer Elite) and at least 5 speakers and a separate sub woofer.5. The VT50 has numerous features that can be turned on/off, adjusted, etc that most people will not understand or use6. The TV is not calibrated correctly out of the box (See 1.)My Assessment: (I'll keep it short)The VT50 is a VERY impressive TV. I purchased the TC-P65VT50 at the end of June 2012. I have not had the VT50 professionally calibrated yet, but I have made screen adjustments via the PRO menu. I used the setting listed at the end of Thomas Nortons review in Home Theater Mag([...]). The link to his setting is listed at the bottom of this review.The Blacks on this TV are extraordinary. The off axis viewing is very good, but most plasmas are. LCDs and LEDs still have a issue with off axis viewing. The Shadow detail is very impressive. I have watch a few movies on this TV via Netflix, VuDu and Blue-ray. I am always impressed with Blue-ray, but I was particularly impressed with streaming movies from Netflix and VUDU using Viera Connect built into the TV. The TV's dual core processor is impressive and I have a 18Mbps internet connection that helped with the streaming. I watch TRON via VUDU HDX. It was like watching TRON on Blue-ray disc.The active shutter 3D is very good on this TV as well. There is little to no ghosting or cross talk. I don't watch movies in 3D that often. It hurts my eyeballs. Panasonic does NOT give you any 3D glasses with the TV and they are pretty pricy. I bought two pair through Amazon (TY-ER3D4MU) and that was only because I had a 50 dollar gift card to help reduce the price a little. NOTE: You cannot use the 3D glasses from the 2011 model with the 2012. The 2012 is Bluetooth enabled and the 2011 is not.There are two remote controls for this TV. One is your basic controller that is gloss black (Gets oily from your skin). The other controller is a small Bluetooth fob looking remote with a touch pad and 3 or 4 buttons. Is suppose to be used to help get you through the Viera Connect menu and to help you surf the web. It works ok, but I never use it. I bought a Harmony 900 and use that remote for everything. The TV will also allow you to Skype. You can buy Panasonic's TV web cam (TY-CC20W) or buy Logitech TV web cam (960-000665). I have been told the Logitech is better and cheaper.My Setup:Panasonic TC-P65VT50Pioneer Elite VSX-52Polk Audio CS400i CenterPolk Audio RT800i Floor Standing L/R speakers (Bi-ampped)Polk Audio PSW650 Powered Dual 10\" Sub wooferBose 161 speakers for surround L/RSony PlayStation for Video Games and Blue-RayMicrosoft Xbox 360U-VerseAPC H15BLK 12-Outlet Power ConditionerPRO Menu setting for the VT50 go here ([...]).Update: 10-7-2012I have had this TV for little over 2 1/2 months now. The TV has had no issues. I have used the custom video settings that Thomas Norton from Home Theater Mag suggested. Those setting have not failed me and the picture looks excellent. There has been no burn-in that I can see with my naked eye. Hulu, Netflix, and Vudu work very well. Youtube has issues, but I don't make use of youtube on my TV so it does not matter to me. I have not used the 3D other than to show friends using a demo of Tron via Vudu. 3D still makes my eyes feel like they are being sucked out of my head.I am going to have a ISFcc calibrator come out to my house on Oct 12th to do a professional calibration on the TV. This is my first time getting a television professionally calibrated so I will report back the week after next on how it went.The only annoying thing is the reflection of my table lamps in the TV at night and the windows behind my couch during the day. It's a very minor annoyance. You will get reflection on any glass surface.I say this again: If you are going to buy this TV it will behoove you to buy a power conditioner with surge suppression. A better option would be a UPS designed for home theaters, but they can be a bit pricy. The power being fed into my house is definitely NOT constant. It jumps up and down.

The fans enginers are loud, they hum on most models. but it's not so loud that you would hear it while their is volume on your tv. but if there's a silent moment you will hear huma huma huma, barely.  still this does distract some evidently.  noone else is mentioning this but it is that way on every tv. so while watching a silent scene you'll hear that slight hmmn nmmma hmmma noise. panasonic said that they had to install these type of fans which are louder to due to the fact that the tv is so thin.  if you don't believe me turn off all volume on your speakers and sit in front you will hear something.  I don't care about wify and all that stuff but the picture is the best ever seen on a tv. And that's not just my opinion , the blacks are the best, the picture is the most natural , the tv is ultra slim and light too. The tv has many features on it and it does 24 frames per second so that your blu ray looks correct and less jerky. It has 2500  hz motion smoother that really works well on movies. that you are using on a blu ray at 24fps. if you use the motion smoother on cable or a dvd that isn't a blu ray it will cause jerky motion. So it is only for use on blu rays or live sport events in hd at most. even then a blu ray that isn't set for 24fps will then be overcorrected and jerky. You set the 24 frame per second on your blu ray player then set on advanced settings under picture 94 hz. there is another setting for when you use the tv as a computer screen. al input 1080p , if you are not using the tv as pc screen then do not set that to on. the ambient light control that responds to your room lighting will make the tv fainter if the overhead lights are on. I turned that off. the mosquito option is a good one for keeping off noise artifacts. It took me a day to figure out these aavanced controls. As the manual doesn't tell you about them. Take my word on it though , only set motion smoother when using blu rays set at the dvd player at 24fps. This tv is wirelsss and lan ready too. So you can connect to the net with it, but I wouldn't use this as my pc screen.  I would NOT do the 3-d feature though on any show that is NOT in 3-d. Use the 3-d for 3-d film and tv and don't bother with it otherwise. Few people do this but it's not what a 3-d tv was designed for really. (watching non 3-d in 3-d) this tv is expensive but for at least the next 8 years at least, it should be well worth using as your main tv,  even if they go to higher resolution their is no medium of anything at that resolution anyway!.  oled tv is here now but like led it is much brighter than plasma and the picture will never be as realistic as what you see on this one.  I don't plan to grab another tv for at least 8 years or more so I grabbed this fantastic set.  Will next years model be better than this years? sure. But there come a point where you have to settle on a great tv and just stay with it for many years. This is that tv. And frankly my 2009 vt-10  was that tv. I had no reason other than the lack of 3-d to go on to this model that's how good vt plasmas are. This is worth your money and with it's excellent picture and 3-d feature this IS good enough to be your main tv for many years to come. It has antiburnin features and improved gas elements too. This set leaps forward from the past plasmas in that regard. So this is another break in tech power to hold you over for many  years.

Amazon cheerfully credited my bank account with both credits. (I called Customer Service about the second reduction, and they displayed their typically courteous, helpful attitude. Personally, I have had had nothing but appreciation and respect for AMAZON'S business model, and efficiency. It is so great to do business with folks who really seem to care about the customer's satisfaction!)I will only echo the comments made by other buyers of this marvelous product. It is the best TV, so far, that I have ever seen or owned. This 55\" model replaces an RCA 34\" set that I had. So the dramatic increase in picture size is beautiful. But the image produced is so sharp and clear that I find myself absolutely taken aback by the beauty. There are so many choices to set this TV to your personal preferences. Out of the box, you should take the time to carefully evaluate all of the the picture setting options. For my (bright) room, I prefer the THX \"Bright Room\" preset. I notice most others like something other than the plain vanilla factory default.Ease of setting audio/video parameters is intuitive, and really quite easy. Maybe a bit of trial and error until you find the exact adjustments that you want. But, I'm pretty sure you WILL find what pleases you. The built-in DOLBY Surround Sound is good, not spectacular. However, in a smaller room this may be all you need to use. You can easily attach an external amp if you need one. The 3-D settings give several choices/modes of display. I bought PANASONIC's 3-D glasses (made specifically for the 2012 model year). The glasses provide a good image, using an active mode,  with adequate brightness. So far, I've just used the 2-D to 3-D conversion mode. I will buy some Blu-Ray 3-D discs soon. I'll wager that the resulting quality  of image will be above-average.The VT-50 has a fantastic look to it, and it MAKES the room that I have it in. I never thought that I'd really buy a plasma set until I saw this one. AMAZON'S price is the lowest I've found anywhere. The delivery being included is a major bonus. I also invested in CANOPY'S 5-Year extended warranty (at a reasonable price---check it out) for even more peace of mind. I honestly do not think that you could find a better TV, with a better picture on the market today. Take the time to do your research. Read the CNET review (and others). Download the OWNER'S MANUAL and HELP GUIDES from PANASONIC'S website before you buy. Not only is this product the new state-of-the-art in plasma TV entertainment, but it promises to be one of the best-engineered sets to ever come out of Japan, or anywhere else.

I thought the Pioneer 55\" VT25 was the best THX certified display. After two weeks of break in, the TC-P65VT50-2 is simply the best I've owned. Many Amazon reviewers seem to agree as do the pros. I'll address features less commented upon.THX certified TVs like the Panasonic GT and VT series are not widely available and seemingly not understood as reflected by the comments about brightness and popping oversaturated colors. The THX certification is intended to replicate the audio and video as intended by its studio for viewing in a movie theater setting. If you view TV in a brightly lit room, you are wasting your money. Pull the shades, move the room light behind the TV. Relax and experience the movie as intended. It is more romantic too! Oh yes, the THX suggested viewing distance for the 65\" screen is about 8 feet. That is full `immersion\"!Panasonic implemented a single connection for those of you who insist on sticking with old S-video or component cables. But why spend money on a TV that exceeds the capacity of your cables? Sort of like buying a THX TV for a room you want bright or viewing 3D \"Avatar\" on a cell phone.Panasonic is very responsive to my requests for more details. They do suggest a break in period of 100 hours \"to minimize the risk of image retention\". Briefly engage a 4:3 aspect and set side bars to \"MID\" or \"BRIGHT\" but return to the full aspect ratio. Ensure the viewing mode fills the screen by using the \"JUST\" or \"FULL\" mode. Change the default picture mode from \"STANDARD\" (that is awful) to \"CINEMA\", or \"THX CINEMA\". Avoid channels with a fixed logo or ticker bar of more than 15% of a viewing week. Not suggested but I did engage MEDIA TOOLS-PHOTO-SLIDESHOW and played a set of USB stored 1080p color images when not using the TV. (Search for `plasma break in images'.) After two weeks, the image is noticeably brighter and sharper. I have no missing `pixels', no buzz and minimal heat in Florida.I am amused that \"smart TV, Blu-ray and A/V receivers\" compete for the same connectivity for streaming content, cloud aps etc. I do not like the ads even when accessing channels. Nor do I appreciate demand for less as in a cell for movies, compressed video and audio and yes the demise of CD / DVD / Blu-ray physical media. Panasonic confirms that it has internal memory to buffer the incoming streamed movie. But adding a USB or SDHC memory chip will not add memory capability (as the Oppo BDP-103 does).OPPO BDP-103 Universal 3D Blu-ray Disc Player SACD & DVD-AudioIn 2009, the HDMI standard brought 3D, THX 3D, ARC and other refinements not yet supported by source material (4k, Ethernet).

To avoid the monstrously over hyped HDMI cable purchase, visit the Blue Jeans cable web site BJC Series-FE Bonded-Pair High-Speed HDMI Cable with Ethernet, 6 foot, Blackfor an almost 100% made in USA product line and detailed information.Panasonic asked that I call in rather than document by email what its implementation of Audio Return Channel is. If you receive an over-the-air digital signal, HDMI-2 is ARC HDMI in for your A/V receiver if supported by it. For the rest of us using DirecTV, DVD or Blu-ray or other set top boxes and a separate A/V receiver to drive separate speakers, you do not need ARC since connection to the A/V first, obviates sending the Panasonic's unprocessed digital back again by ARC.The VT series exclusively offers features I may never use. As with the VT25, the two THX settings are great as is. I am not a consummate settings tinkerer so the Pro settings thru ISFccc may wait a few years. The upgraded 96HZ or better playback of 24p filmed media is greyed out in THX mode. The single pane of glass is gorgeous, easily cleaned with only a dry cloth and a little reflective. The metal perimeter helps discern the black TV edge from a black image. Yep, its blacks are that good. The Viera Connect Touch Pad is useless. If that is your sole `want'; buy a Bluetooth keyboard instead.I am pleased that I have a choice of a few Bluetooth 3D glasses with new ones eminent. I expect to buy a HDMI cable so why not the choice of 3D glasses and Skype video conference too?I have three product suggestions for Panasonic exclusive of adding 4k and other new technology. You blew the elegant design with side connect of cables. Rotate the connections to face down so the cable does not protrude from the left side. The Blue Jeans HDMI A type 90 degree plug fixes this. The stand is the same size as for my former 32\" LCD that was immoveable. This 100 pound baby is fine left alone but fearfully weak feeling if touched. Dump the touch pad and add a real video up scaling chip. If a $40 Blu-ray can offer up scaling, can't you help us upscale 1080i cable / satellite / fiber set top box HD?

You should have no hesitation about purchasing this TV.  It is beautiful just sitting off in the room and is the standard by which all other plasmas should be compared to this year.  This review is mainly about the delivery service.The TV arrived on the day promised, but 5 hours ahead of the scheduled time.  Luckily I was home.  When the truck arrived, there was one very friendly delivery man who unfortunately did not have anyone to help him bring in the TV.  He said \"sorry, but times are tough you know\".  As I was feeling like being helpful, I assisted him in carrying the TV off of the truck and into the house.  We tested the TV upstairs and took it into the basement.  Since he was alone this wasn't going to be \"white glove\" delivery as promised on Amazon.com.  I had to ask him to help me install the stand and he obliged and didn't appear too put out by this.  Then after I washed by hands we moved the TV onto the stand.  The delivery man's hands were literally black with dirt and dust and he put a really nice sweaty palm print on the screen while helping me out.  Luckily I had some no lint, soft towels handy to clean this off.Amazon.com should not promise or imply \"white glove\" delivery if the companies they contract out to do their work for them do not provide this service reliably.  Others appear to have different experiences.  I think the delivery man was 5 hours early because he wanted to end his day early.  Of the 14 deliveries he had that day, there were only 3 more after mine and this was at 10 am.  My time was supposed to be between 3-6 pm.The price and discounts that amazon.com offers cannot be beat by many.

This is a good set that will probably meet the needs of most people.  However, based upon my experience with this set, there is a specific group of people that would probably be better off purchasing a different television.In order to fully appreciate where I am coming from with this review, I think it's important to understand what type of tv I had prior to purchasing the 65in VT50 from Amazon.  For the last 4 years I have been extremely pleased with a 46in Samsung LCD called the LN46A650A1FXZA. For those of you who are unfamiliar with this set, it is part of Samsung's Touch of Color series that they released a few years back. Believe it or not, this is the highest rated tv that I have ever seen on Amazon!  Just pop the model number in an Amazon search and you will see that it has a rating of 4.7 stars out of 974 reviews.  Very few tvs that I have seen have come close to a 4.7 rating, let alone have such a large number of reviewers.I mention all this because to this day my 46in LCD has served me extremely well. So much so, that every guest who visits my house, ALWAYS comments on its clearity and richness of color. In fact, I had not reason for purchasing a new tv other than the fact that I wanted a bigger screen with more bells and whistles.That being said, when contemplating my purchase I started looking into the latest Samsung models but was turned off by the numerous reports of screen uniformity issues. While the Samsung models were rated very poorly, the VT50 was given the highest of praise from just about every expert source out there (CNET, Avforums, etc).  Prior to purchasing the VT50, I went into my local Best Buy just to see it in person and could immediately tell that it was significantly darker and less rich in color than my LCD.  However, I dismissed these concerns thinking that it was just the store's settings and purchased the set from Amazon.Fast forward a week later and the VT50 was now sitting in my living-room with about 80 hours of usage on the various picture modes. It was at that point that I started tweaking with the settings to see what it could do.  I tried a variety of settings such as CNET's recommendations, THX Brightroom, and my own custom setup. Here are the pros that I found:1. It's a beautiful looking set, a complement to any room.2. The built in apps work flawlessly every time.3. 1080p content looked pretty good.4. The black level performance was pretty good but surprisingly it was just a slight improvement over my old LCD.5. The speakers were surprisingly good. Much better than I was expecting.Despite these positives, I just didn't find myself being impressed by the overall picture quality. Here are the cons that I found:1. Anything lower than 1080p or 1080i content looked awful. I noticed this because my favorite news station is filmed in 720p and the video quality looked awful compared to my LCD.2. The screen is extremely reflective and not suited to a room with any more than 3 standard windows.3. I had to pump the brightness to the max in order to overcome the light in my room during the day.  As a consequence, the colors were washed out.4. Even in a pitch black environment, anything less than 1080p content was not impressive.5. Increasing the sharpness setting seams to create a grainy image instead of actually improving the sharpness.  This is probably the main reason why most professional calibrators leave the sharpness setting at 0.It's important to note here that I was not the only one who noticed these problems.  In fact, my entire family and numerous guests all commented that they felt that the picture quality on my old LCD was better than the VT50. Imagine my horror when I realized that I had spent over $3000 on a product that was not as good as my old set!Rather than wasting over $3k for lower picture quality, I decided to do something extreme. I bought a 60in Samsung ES8000, hocked both TVs to an HDMI splitter, identical HDMI cables, and compared the two sets in my home environment. If you look at another Amazon review posted for the VT50 by the user \"Fly2high\".  You will see that I am not the only one who conducted this experiment.  Like \"Fly2high\", my results were exactly the same:1. The sharpness on the ES8000 blew the VT50 out of the water. It was a huge difference! I could actually count the pores in an actor's face, whereas the VT50 just created a soft image.2. The brightness of the whites were much richer on the ES8000. This is to be expected since it's an LED.3. The high brightness leads to better bright room performance.4. I found the off angle performance better on the ES8000.  Why you ask? Because the LED is bright enough to combat the light reflections that plagued the VT50 when viewed from the side.5. The ES8000 black levels were much better.  This one really surprised me seeing that the ES8000 is an LED.  However, this model is capable of getting so black that in pitch black scenes, you can't even tell if the tv is on!!!6. Lastly, the colors are richer on the ES8000.While it may sound like I am showing favoritism to the ES8000, I honestly really wanted to like the VT50.  The 65in screen and build quality just made it look really nice in my living room. All this being said, however, the most important thing to me is picture quality.  And in my opinion, the ES8000 is far superior. Therefore, I ended up paying the same amount for the Samsung that I paid for the VT50 while loosing 5in in screen size.  I wasn't happy about it, but I had to do it.So who exact is the VT50 suited for?  Here's my opinion:1. The majority of the content you watch must be 1080p or 1080i resolution.2. You must have no more than 3 standard windows in your room.3. Most importantly, you must like the soft images (i.e. not sharp) and muted colors of the video shown in movie theaters.If all of these factors sound like you, then this tv will be perfect for you. It perfectly mimics the movie theater experience.For everyone else who prefers the experience you get when watching a movie on a sharp and vibrant screen like on a large iMac, than you should look elsewhere.------------------------------------------ UPDATE: August 28, 2012 -----------------------------------------It has now been slightly over a month since I returned my 65 inch VT50 in exchange for a Samsung ES8000 LED and I have absolutely NO regrets. Here are the main reasons why:1.  I didn't mention this in my original review but the deciding factor on whether I replaced the VT50 was a specific experiment that I conducted.  Long story short, while watching a tv program with my family, I placed the VT50 at eye level on an entertainment stand and the ES8000 on the floor.  As before, both tvs were displaying the same content via an HDMI splitter.  From there I simply remained quite and watched to see which TV my family would spend more time watching. To my surprise, despite the fact that the ES8000 was at an uncomfortable level (i.e on the floor and hence below eye level) and 5 inches smaller than the VT50, each member of my family watched the ES8000 exclusively.  There wasn't even any going back and forth between displays.  They simply ignored the VT50.  When I brought this observation to their attention, they confessed that despite the larger VT50, the Samsung was just more pleasant to watch.Note that this experiment was done at night in a dark room.2. One of the most popular comments that I got on my review was the fact that the colors on the ES8000 are over saturated compared to the VT50.  After owning the VT50 for a couple of weeks, I can understand where others are coming from.  However, I would venture to say that the vast majority of people would prefer the slightly over saturated colors of the ES8000 over the VT50.  It's this slight over saturation that causes the colors to pop instead of appearing dull.  I will admit however, that this is really a matter of personal taste.  Fortunately, however, by just spending a few minutes tweaking the settings on the Samsung (CNETs settings recommended settings do a great job of this), it's possible to make the picture quality almost identical to the VT50.  Based on this fact, I liked the LED even more seeing that by adjusting the settings, I could get the best of both worlds.3. During the few weeks that I owned the VT50, I found myself having to lower all the window shades in my living room in order to watch the tv without any distracting glare.  So on a typical Saturday afternoon where it is nice and bright outside,  I had to have all my shades down in order to watch tv.  Doing so day after day just got a little bit depressing.  I didn't want to feel like I was living in a cave in order to comfortably watch TV.  Since making the switch to the Samsung, I can now comfortably watch tv with every window in the house wide open!!", "Date": "June 27, 2012"}, {"Title": "Has Burnt Image in a month after purchase, not covered under warranty - Do not buy", "Author": "Trooper \"churamani\"", "ReviewID": "R1HQTEVCRTOYJD", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I bought a 55\" Plasma TV (Viera VT50 series) in April 2013 from Panasonic directly and it already has a burnt image on the top left thru right side of the screen.

In my opinion, VT offers slightly better picture (blacks seem nicer), but this is really not very noticeable.

I looked at the Samsung 8000 series, the Elite which is just way to expensive for me and a few others, but I kept coming back to the VT50, the picture was just to good.  I purchased this tv as well as a Harmon Kardon sound system with high quality accessories from Paul's TVs.  I tried to get both Amazon and Best Buy to price match, but neither would price match the other places that I was looking at.  I am very satisfied with Paul's TV's service and the included white glove service, they even price matched after the purchase as prices went down.The TV arrived, and I unpacked it and set it up, which was easy.  The picture was great right out of the box, THX Cinema is the best preset in my opinion.  I was a little bit worried that this tv wouldn't be bright enough as my living room can get a bit of sunlight, but I found that the THX Bright Room was far to bright for me!  I was totally shocked and pleased by this.  I then set up the Custom picture using settings that I got from a couple of internet sites that reviewed the VT.

In short, I'd buy from Amazon next time...  read below...I finally completed my basement so to pat myself on the back I decided for 'big'. I wanted videophile quality so I decided on the TC-P65VT50 or Viera 65\" Plasma 'top of the line'.  I chose it because at Best Buys it was side by side with Sony Bravia XL, LG, Samsung and it appeared 'to me' to provide the nicest colors, brightness, and black screen.  I'm not an expert so excuse my 'everyday' terms.  One guy told me that Plasma's were heavy and very hot. (I totally agree now but i don't care. More later)So now I have to decide where to purchase this.  If you shop, you'll find it of course at Amazon and at many other discounters.  I selected Abe's of Maine.Why?Amazon:  2,999 to 3,199 (fluctuating weekly) free shippingAbe's:  2,675 free shippingAbe's listed a kit at 2910 which included:TVwall mounthdmi cablessurge protector2 year warrantyI figured that this was a good deal since with Amazon, I'd have to spend another 400 to 500 on warranty + cable + wall mount.So I ordered it from Abe's.On a Sunday, I receive a call from Abe's requesting confirmation on the following(why call me on Sunday?):1. warrantyWarranty was for in-store so I would have to ship it in.  the store is in NJ and I'm in MI.  BTW, there is no mention of the warranty limitations on the website, just check for yourself.  They sell me a 5 year mack warranty for 480.  This is after offering me 120/year and if I bought 5 years, they'd charge for 4 years. (Bait and Switch?)2. ShippingIt was explained to me that the standard free shipping was with a standard freight forwarder. they don't care about the box positioning, i.e., they put it on a truck and drive - once they drive to your house, they just drop it off at your door where you sign for it. If there is a problem it's basically your problem - Abe's will not honor anything the trucker did.  So, they offer me white glove service at $250.  Since I bought the 5 year warranty, they split the difference so I paid $125.  With this service they ship it on a pallet, on the side, they carry the unit down into your cave, unwrap it, plug it in, then you sign for it.  (comment: this was pretty good service.  This is a heavy unit, a big box. I don't think my wife and I could have handled this alone. Just not happy with non-disclosure of all 'Abe's will not cover damage' on the web page. Buyer beware.)3. Wall mountThe wall mount which is in the package deal is a 4\" or large gap wall mount. this means that there is a gap of 4\" between the wall and your unit.  Because I bought the 5 year warranty, they gave me a slim wall mount (2\") (which apparently costs more) in the place of the 4\" unit.(comment: it worked well but it is flimsy thin gauge sheet metal.  If I were to to this again, I'd recommend getting a unit that would extend out via a scissor unit.  The tilt feature is priceless so make sure that 'tilt' is a feature if you choose a wall mount. You can tilt out the ceiling light reflection. In case you ever need to sneak behind for anything, you can do it without lifting a heavy unit with two strong people. (again, buyer beware)4. HDMI cables.They threw in another 12' HDMI cable. (too long, but...)5. Surge protector.Part of the package. It is huge but very worthy.During the conversation, they asked me if I wanted a rack to hold my AV equipment for another 165, I declined.I then received a notice that everything was shipped including the AV rack.  I had to send a mean note demanding that they remove the rack and reduce payment by 165. (upsetting to have to correct these types of avoidable problems - not an easy buying experience for an experienced internet buyer.)This entire package ended up costing $3,500.If I had to do it over again, I'd select Amazon, pay a tad more but not get bugged on Sunday, and I know exactly what I'm getting without any human sales order entry errors, full disclosure on all products.  Plus I know that with Amazon, the guarantee is the BEST.OK, here is the product review which is short because I'm so happy.The picture is great!The screen which is glass does reflect light but curtains and lights-out should do the trick.  Make sure your wall mount can tilt because you can tilt the TV so that when you sit in your lounge chair, the ceiling lights (if you have them) don't blind you.  I am so happy to have a tilting wall mount.The TV is heavy so you will need 3 normal or 2 strong people to lift it onto the rack.My AVR unit is a Marantz 5007 (purchased via Amazon!) and I configured it for Audio Return so I can receive audio from the TV back thru HDMI cable.  This minimizes the need for additional cables.The Red power light bugs me so I'm covering it up with black electronic tape.  Reminds me of HAL-9000.Wireless: Don't connect to the ATT modem/wireless router, use a decent Netgear or equivalent wireless router.  I tried both and the performance is much better on a netgear.  I can access Hulu, Youtube, U-verse movies and enjoy 7.1 via the Audio Return.  It took a while to figure out but it works great.  Wireless is also nice for upgrades to the TV firmware.My Marantz can access internet as well but for internet radio only.  How lame I thought.Playstation is only used for Blu Ray and DVD player only.  I was using for internet access but due to heat, I'm minimizing it's use.This unit puts out alot of heat and together with a Marantz 5007 + Playstation 3 (my Blueray, DVD, CD player), it generates enough heat to heat up 2 rooms downs stairs and it's 10F outside.  Last night, I had to crack the window so stay comfortable.Besides the order mess, the setup mess, the box take-down, the clean-up, the visa bill, I'm a very happy camper.Feb 12, 2013:  This unit is the best thing ever.  I have spent night after night all alone with my new friend.  I intend to check into a mental institution soon but first I have to check which hospitals have the same setup as I do.  One day, they will find my body twitching in front of the TV.

I watch tv, but I don't own any fancy home entertainment center, I don't change my hdmi cored every time a better one comes out and I don't have an insanely expensive top of the line DVD player.  I am what I would define as a normal tv watcher that watches mostly sports and some blu-rays through my PS3.  I had an old tv which was a 1080i flat screen that I bought back in 2003.  It was fine and I probably could have went another year without an upgrade, but I thought that between the new video quality, smart tv features, and 3d that I could use an upgrade.  I am not a techy, I am not going to spend $500 for a professional calibration, and I am not going to be super picky about comparing 18 tv's and spending hours trying to find a single flaw.  With that said, here is my review of the tv:Out of the box I wasn't expecting miracles but I have to say that I was a little disapointed with the picture compared to my old tv.  However, I live in an apartment with a ton of sun light so I needed to adjust the settings.  The TXH bright room definately made a big difference, and I gave in, and went to CNET and spent the 30 minutes using their calibrations.  This made a big difference and increased the picture quality very noticeably.  So I was a little dissapointed with the pre-sets right out of the box, you will have to spend time adjusting them.The TV itself is very thin.  It looks almost as thin as the LED tv's I see in the store that I'm always amazed at.  It is very sleak and the bezel isn't to big.  As far as the stand goes, it really isn't bad at all.  Alot of people bad mouth it, but honestly it is just a stand and it will not ruin the look of your room.  It looks black if your 10 ft away, so no big deal.  The glass does have some reflections especially in a well lit room.  I think this is going to force me to put the TV on the wall to cut back on the glare.  Not a huge deal, I always wanted a tv on the wall, but after paying for the TV I would have liked to have put it on the wall at my leisure instead of having to pay almost immediately to cut back on the glare.Picture Quality:  Honestly I kept reading that you need to break in the TV's for 150 hours.  I don't know why, and I think that is rediculous, but I have noticed that the picture on the TV is getting much better the more I use it.  So you have to give it time.  After having the tv for two weeks I can honestly say that the picture on football and other live sports is pretty impressive.  Better than my old tv, but not so spectacular that your going to be blown away if you came from a high def tv already.  However, and this is a huge however, if you watch something that allows the tv to show off its black levels you will be blown away.  I was watching Harry Potter, and I don't even like harry potter, but it looked so amazing on the tv it was mesmerizing.  Another good example was when the camera's were doing a live panning over NYC during the Jets game the other night, the city looked incredible.  All in all I would say that the TV looks great, especially the black levels and blu-rays are mind blowing.3D- The 2d to 3d conversion isn't anything special, you probably wont' use it.  The glasses don't come with the tv, but I bought the TY model and they work fine.  I only have one 3d channel which is ESPN 3D and it is good.  Depends on the sport and I guess the camera they shoot it in.  HOnestly I don't think anyone will sit there and watch a whole game in 3D.  However, when you play an actual blu-ray 3D DVD it is very very very very good.  Just as good as the theatres. Honestly, you probably won't use the 3D much except for the 3d Blu Rays and I use my PS3, it is supposed to look even better with a full 3d blu ray player.  So if you have one of those, and the picture gets better, which I can't imagine, than you should be blown away.Smart Features- they are limited.  There is an app store but there really isn't much to download.  However, the apps that they have do work great.  Pandora, netflix, amazon, etc.  They all load up super fast and the video streams perfectly.  The wireless was easy to set up.  Only complaint is that when you turn the tv off it takes about 3 minutes from when you turn back on the tv till the internet is hooked up again.  Same as when your restarting a laptop, it takes time for the device to find the signal.All in all- The tv is great.  Really my only complaint is that I wish the picture didn't have to be calibrated at all.  Honestly I am still really impressed without messing around with the picture except for changing on the custom setting to the settings they had on CNET.  The 3d is movie theatre quality when playing a blu-ray, and if you watch something with allows the tv to show off the black levels, it is mind blowing.  Letting the tv break in actually makes a difference, the smart features are nice and work well, video streams without any lag, and the design is nice (not as nice as say the new LG LED, but it is very close).  I give the TV a 5 star rating, I'm very happy with it and I bet if you have the patients to really mess around with the settings and adjust it than you probably will have a much nicer picture than I currently do.", "Date": "August 27, 2012"}, {"Title": "A wonderful plasma for any event", "Author": "Mike E.", "ReviewID": "ROWL276QUEEGG", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I purchased this TV simply on reviews; as the local big box stores did not have it on display.

I was able to use ARC to my Denon AVR-3313CI Receiver. Originally I picked up a Cheetah Mounts 32\"-55\"  Wall Mount Bracket but after I got the TV I discovered this would not work; as the mount holes are 19\" apart. After then getting the Mount-It!

I have a much lower rating for the delivery service; more on that later.I currently own Sony (LCD), Samsung (LCD), and LG (Plasma) HDTVs. They are all nice, but this Panansonic is clearly the best of them. I was very close to buying a Samsung 63\" LCD, but went with this one at the last minute. Every other TV I've had to manually mess around with the picture to get it where I liked it. With this one, I went through the preset options and found the Cinema THX to be perfect. Just an overall really nice looking set, even when it's turned off. The 3D is very good (glasses not included), although I haven't owned a 3D set before, so don't really have anything to compare it to. This set really puts the \"theater\" in \"home theater.\" If you get one, you won't be disappointed.The one thing I do need to complain about was the \"white glove\" delivery. I had scheduled a delivery for 8-11am with Ceva. I took a half day off work to be home for the delivery, but 11:00am came and went, and nothing. I waited another 30 minutes and finally started making some calls. I found it somewhat humorous listening to their pre-recorded messages about how focused they are on customer service. Anyway, 15 minutes later, after being transferred around several times, I finally got to someone who could help me. They told me the set had just been taken off the truck! I expressed my disappointment in not even getting a phone call, and having blown my whole day now, and all the guy could say was \"sorry, I just got here.\" They did manage to arrange to still have it delivered that day, and it finally showed up around 6pm. The delivery guy was very good about unloading, unpacking, setting up, and testing the TV, so it ended on a high note. My recommendation for anyone having a set delivered is to contact them early on the day of delivery and make sure everything is on schedule, before losing a whole day like I did.

Here is a brain dump of my $.02:-If you are an Amazon Prime member the free \"white glove shipping\" is not stellar.  This experience will vary depending on your location and the vendor they choose, but my experience was NOT good.  Same issue as most - they said TV would be there between 9am-12pm and it didnt show up until 7pm the next day.  They didnt assemble tv or anything.-TV was well packaged in the box.-I was missing the touch pad remote that's supposed to come with the TV.  Had to wait a week and call them a bunch to receive a replacement.-The wireless and wired internet is very easy to setup and has worked well so far.-The setup of an over the air antenna was really simple, relatively fast and is of good quality.-The canned viewing settings the TV comes with are decent, but this is where I take the most issue with the TV.  If you've been researching this TV you hear everyone go on about how \"deep the blacks are\".  While this is true, the issue I have is that it makes things TOO dark/black- so much so that you are missing out on actual detail.  For example, if someone is wearing a black shirt or if half of their face is in a shadow you can't see *anything* but black.  To me this is not an accurate representation of the actual image and is why I knock off a single star for this review.  I have used all of the canned viewing settings and also applied the CNET recommended settings and they all suffer from this same issue.  If someone can point me to settings that remedy this issue I will gladly update this review.-The 3D feature works as well as it can, but it's still really gimmicky and I can't see me (or anyone) using it very often.  Even with Avatar 3D Blu-ray it's just not worth the headache.-TV doesn't come with 3d glasses, so I had to invest another $100 to get those.This is my first plasma TV - i have always had LCDs in the past.

When something looked different, I would verify by changing cables to ruleout the cables.  Since the shootout said the THX Cinema or THX Bright Room modes were near perfect, I chose those for comparison.  The Samsung was put into either Natural or Movie mode (mostly Movie mode with adjustments using the patterns built in)PanasonicPros:Super wide viewing angle.Nice colorgreat black levelsCons:did not have the depth in 3DWhites looked light grey.Not as bright as SamsungNot as sharpHad no built in test patternsglare was impossible to counterLack of brightness in the colorsIn watching the night scene of Avatar where the the jackals find Jake and she extinguishes the torch and the whole forest goes psychedelic in color, the colors were accurate but they did not pop off the set even in THX Bright Room mode like they did on the LCD.  They really popped on the LCD.The 3D looked good but I could not get the depth of the 3D to look as deep as I could on the Samsung.  I found the Panasonic needed to be turned up all the way just to come up short of the Samsung's 3D in its default settings.Plasma did do slightly better on the blacks but I could not see its results in Sanctum or Avatar in their dark scenes.  I could see it on the test patterns but nowhere else.  In watching Despicable Me, the ending scene where they are trying to reach farther over the cliff, the plasma looked grey whereas the LED looked whiter.  I saw the same thing occur on commercials where the background was white.  Plasmas do not get as white as LED LCDs.I am not sure if I had a bad set or what but when I compared the credits on a movie and then the FIOS guide, I noticed that the Samsung had sharper lettering.  Also, the credits did not scroll smoothly.  they were stuttering in motion.  I then noticed the difference in sharpness it also in movies as well.  It looked like there was a fuzzing of all edges on the plasma whereas the LED/LCD had scissor cut edges.  Playing with the sharpness could not rectify the issue.  In going back to BestBuy, I saw this on their display, the 65 in and 55 in and several other plasmas.  I am not sure but it was as if the adjacent phosphors were glowing slighly weakening the edge.  Only looking at them side by side was it noticeable.  Otherwise both had pleasing pictures independently.I have 4 large windows adjacent to the set.  When viewing from the side, the brightness of the set could not handle the light coming in.  It was more of a mirror than a TV.  If I sat directly in front, anything that light was on, say items on the coffee table, would be reflected back in the set.  I like the glass over the soft screen of the LCD but it just could not handle the natural light coming in.The Samsung has its own issues that I described there.I will say that I only saw these differences because I had both sets in my living room under my conditions of use.  Your results might vary.  Had I not had them both in my home, I would have been very satisfied with either set.Having to choose between a rarely seen flashlight effect and poor sharpness on all the time, I chose the flashlight effect.

Both are nice, I picked the Panasonic only because I have had better luck with their equipment, with the exception of a bulb eating Panasonic LIFI LCD TV I owned. The picture is great with real fine detail, better than expected.  I had to bump the picture brightness level up a bit from standard (as shipped) to cinema to make up for the ambient light level in the room.  3D is 3D ish.  I am not a fan.  I watched about twenty minutes of a Johnny Depp 3D \"Pirates\" movie before removing the glasses and switching to 2D. I don't like wearing my reading glasses either.  I am sure the kids and grandkids will love it when they're over.  The TV ships with no 3D glasses, strange.  The \"new for 2012\" 3D Panasonic glasses are on Amazon at a reasonable price in the largest of the two sizes available, medium.

I still have a Panasonic S-VHS recorder, camcorders, a WII game and I don't think I should need a combining amp for off air and cable TV connections. I have a Denon AV receiver that will convert any video signal to HDMI. Although it is a great sounding amp, video conversion is anything but seamless.  You lose scan and still picture functions, and there is a list of other video issues. I prefer not to use the receiver every time the TV is in use. The TV speakers work just fine for many things. Do I want to watch The Weather Channel with 5.1 channel surround sound? Hummm.  3D Blu-ray players mostly have one HDMI connection. Do I want here Bert & Ernie in full surround? A new Panasonic BDT500p Blu-ray player solved that problem with two HDMI output connections. HDMI is a \"must have\" for DTS-HD Master Audio, etc., between Blu-ray player and receiver. \" subtract one star, connectivity\"  That's my rant on that.Shipping: Pilot delivered this TV with one man. I helped carry the box up the stairs rather than watch it being dragged up. He did everything required, offered to remove the box, plugged it in to check power up. He was a little late, but called ahead to say he would be.CEVA delivered my last TV. They had two men, so the stairs were no problem. They did everything required.  They also attached the TV base and placed it on the stand.

With the P65VT50, I say there is no compromise.  My 10+ year old Loewe recently bit the dust and I read enough positive comments about this TV to feel it was worth the gamble instead of springing for a repair.  Boy am I happy.  I now have a TV that is several times larger than the Loewe but with picture quality that is just as excellent.An example: A man in a dark navy shirt stands in front of a black backdrop: You immediately notice that his shirt is navy and that the background is black.  I looked at the same scene in a room where I have an older Samsung plasma and watched it again: the navy shirt and black backdrop look exactly the same.3D works well.  I didn't appreciate having to drop another $140 for glasses (the set doesn't include any) but they do work extremely well.  I think the 3D experience is the same as what you see in an IMAX 3D theater.If you care about picture quality, my bet is you will love this TV.UPDATEI have noticed that the set has a fan that is sometimes audible.  Sitting 12 feet away, I can clearly hear the fan when my audio is turned down very low or when I pause playback or fast forward through commercials.  It is a mild high pitch sound, similar to what you might hear on a laptop computer.  It isn't enough to bother me, but I'm going to side with the other reviewers that say it is audible.UPDATE 2I purchased this under an Amazon promotion offering a $500 credit to your account within 7 days of the television shipping.

I went back and forth between LED/LCD and this plasma to replace my fine old rear projection 60\" Sony SXRD TV.  LED (Samsung ES8000 was at the top of my list) had a brighter picture but I couldn't live with color reproduction and the inconsistent screen quality.  Plasma is \"older\" technology and problem with image retention and higher power usage.Based on the overall reviews on amazon and on the web, plus the desire to avoid problems with large purchase, this Panasonic TC-P65VT50 won out.  I've only had this TV for a week but I'm pretty impressed with it.  You do have to adjust the picture to your taste but the blacks are deep and screen is very uniform and colors are just right on the money.  Color gradients are fairly smooth (LED TV are terrible at this).  The video processing is superb and it doesn't make everything appear soap opera-ish.  Pixel response is very fast.  Everything looks quite natural.As for power draw, my old projection ran at a fairly consistent 195 watts.  This Panasonic varies from 110-350 watts depending on how bright the image is (it makes my kill-o-watt meter as interesting to watch along with the TV).  The average would be about 230 watts.  Plasma works by adding light rather than subtracting light in the case of LCD.  That's why plasma have such deep blacks.Why the half star deduction?  The DLNA video streaming is a bit lumpy speed wise.  Subtle slow downs and speed ups is a bit perturbing.  The Sony PS3 handles the same video stream just fine.  The red power on LED in the front is a bit bright (I'll just cover that up some tape).  Moving your eyes off the screen quickly causes color separation like the DLP TV (relatively minor issue, don't do that).  Yes, the TV does emit a small buzz but only if it's a bright image and there's no sound at all.  Sound quality is a bit bigger than expected due to the \"mini subwoofer\" but I wish it was geared more towards the vocal range.  3D feature is good but not excellent due to some crosstalk.  All of these issues together didn't detract enough to warrant a 4 star rating from me.All in all, I'm quite happy with my purchase so far.  Only time will tell about longevity and image retention.

Aquos, Elite, Samsung.  They all look good, but the VT-50 resolves shadows better than any of them.

As far as the interface and remote controls, I'm sure there are other TVs that are slightly better and probably many that are not as good, but it would be hard for me to significantly fault this set.  I would guess if I were spending a lot of time surfing the internet features, the second remote with the touchpad would be useful, but for me it is just another remote to collect dust.Cons of this set... LCD/LEDs are brighter.  Glare can be a problem with any plasma, but frankly I think that is true of most large TV's so setup and space planning is important.  No 3D glasses are included so budget in another $65/pair.Bottom line is that I spent 6 months reading about and auditioning different TVs.  I would have been happy with last years VT-30 and couldn't have imagined that Panasonic was going to significantly improve upon it.  They did!  Who knows what the future improvements will be but as of today, I have never seen a TV that seriously rivals the VT-50's picture.  Anyone with the budget for a high end set should seriously consider this offering.

I did the e-schedueling via Amazon at check out so I had no contact with the delivery company (Pilot) until the actual delivery.  The Amazon price dropped by about 40 bucks the day after I ordered and Amazon price matched it with no issues.Delivery - I was scheduled for delivery on June 11th between 9am-12pm.  The delivery guy who was a sub contractor for Pilot showed up at 9am sharp, no call just showed up in my driveway.  I went outside to see if I could help.  The delivery guy was alone and did not have a lift gate, so I had to help him lift and remove the TV from his rented box truck, which I had no issues with, but If I were not an able body person this would have been an issue.  Much to my surprise the TV was stacked on its side standing up vertically in the truck, which I was not pleased with and had the delivery guy note on both copies of the delivery ship, the box has stacking instructions on every side and in large bold print, not sure why he did not follow the instructions.  Once inside he attempted to get me to sign and leave which I refused.  I told him that by Amazon policy I had to unbox and plug in the TV and inspect it for damage.  He was less then pleased with this but had no choice as I refused to sign slip.  No issues with the TV everything checked out, so I signed and he left.  I would give the delivery a 5 of 10.Setup - Could not be easier, 13 small screws to get the base and TV together and then lifted it onto the entrainment stand.  Plugged in the HDMI cable and powered her on then went through the Panasonic setup which is a few steps and takes about 5 mins which included WiFi setup.Picture - The default standard mode is way to dark and soft, I switched to THX Bright Room setting and have not changed it since.  I plan to have calibrated or use the Cnet calibrations settings in their review of this TV after about 150 hours.  The blacks are so very black and the colors are very accurate, currently watching the US Open and it looks amazing.Sound - Ok, but better then most TV's in this range.Apps - Nice features, love Pandora Radio and the MLB.TV app.Overall - A great plasma, and I was coming from a 7 year old Pioneer PDP-4340 plasma, which has been flawless for all 7 years.

I had tried the top of the line Sharp available at Costco and was shocked at how bad the picture was; they said maybe it was defective, but I didn't want to take a chance, and so decided to spend more and get the Panasonic plasma.Like many others, I first wanted to use Best Buy as my display showroom, which I felt bad about, as they are losing money from people not buying there, but just looking. I assumed that due to a fixed price policy and the cost of local taxes there was no way I would be buying it from them. On the other hand, after my experience with returning the Sharp to Costco, locally, without any cost, there certainly was a major advantage to buying locally.I mentioned to the salesman that Amazon was $80 cheaper, but also an additional $250 cheaper due to no taxes due, and shipping free. [Of course, I would have had to wait a week or so for Amazon to deliver, and was eager to get it sooner]. The salesman at Best Buy immediately said they would match the Amazon price, INCLUDING the cost of taxes, deducting it from the price, and could deliver it for free in 2 days. I could not turn down that offer. When I made a crack about there being other companies offering it online for even less (but likely not authorized dealers, or else not offering a 30 day free trial, with local return if necessary, as Best Buy offers), the supervisor even lowered it an additional $100, without any threats from me.It seems to me that it was a great deal for me. I am writing this because I never expected to buy it like this from Best Buy and to get it in 2 days, with a free 30 day return policy and wanted to share it with others. I love Amazon, but with an item this big, buying locally is a good idea. I am also sharing it this way because I have found great advice in these reviews; for example, one gave me great advice on how to extend the life of Brother toner cartridges when I looked at the Amazon website. I have no connection with Best Buy or its employees, and have traditionally bought all my electronics from Amazon, and have been very happy with their service and prices.", "Date": "August 29, 2012"}, {"Title": "Great TV...If it works", "Author": "Paolo", "ReviewID": "R21BSCIA23MIJJ", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Purchased this TV on 08/27/12 and received it shortly thereafter.  Love the TV and love the picture quality.  Yesterday, I went to turn it on and nothing happened.  I noticed that the light at the bottom of the TV was blinking, pausing for 5 seconds, and then blinking again continuously.  I read online that the TV might have gone into \"protection\" mode and some posts suggested that I unplug the TV for several hours.  I left the TV unplugged overnight.  This morning, when I plugged it back in, the blinking red light returned and no working TV.I called Panasonic support this morning; it's great that their Customer Support is open on a Sunday.  The customer support rep promptly scheduled a repair appointment for Friday.  She explained scheduling 5 days out would give the company that is going to do the repair work(a local repair company) time to order the appropriate parts.  She indicated that, most of the time, the TV is repaired on site without any follow up visits.The TV is great; I probably would have given this TV 5 stars had I not had this issue. The handling of my issue by customer service has been very good.  But because the TV has stopped working after 2 months of average use, I can't give this product anything other than 1 star.  I've had several TV's and never had an issue with any of them.  Also, although I understand the need to make the appointment a week out, that means I won't have a working TV until Friday at the earliest assuming the repair technician can actually fix it.  If the repair man fixes it on Friday, I'll probably update this review to 3 stars.Like I said above, I really like the TV and the features.  I'm not an expert on this stuff; I probably would have liked anything I purchased as I was coming from a 11 year old Sony Vega tube TV.  Some of my friends have more \"economical\" TV's and I can definitely see a difference.  Also, I never thought I would use the web apps on the TV, but I've started to, especially NetFlix.Update--11/07/2012So, the technician fixed the problem with my TV.  It turns out the board that controls all of the non-TV functionality like apps, wi-fi, etc. died.The repair technician spoke very highly of the TV and Panasonic TV's in general.  He indicated while other competitors may have some type of diagnostic tool for use by a customer when reporting an issue, none of them are as accurate as Panasonic's (a diagnostic light at the front of the TV).  He also indicated for those vendors that had diagnostic tools, many times the tools are fairly useless because the same model of a TV might have different internal components depending on when/where it was manufactured.  He specifically called out Samsung as having TV's with different types of boards in the same \"model\" TV.  You might ask, why does this matter?  Well, he indicated that 99% of the time, when he comes out to fix a Panasonic TV, he fixes it in the customer's home the first time.  He indicated that no other TV manufacturer is anywhere close to that success rate.  Because of the accurate diagnostic code, he can come onsite with the correct hardware the first time.  With other TV manufactures, he has to make a first visit just to figure out what's wrong and then come back again to actually fix it.  Also, he stated that the quality of other TV manufactures is not as high as Panasonic so many times the problems with the TV cannot be fixed onsite or cannot be fixed at all.So far the TV has been working fine.

We selected the item \"Sold by and shipped by Amazon.com\" (as required by the terms of the promotion), put it in our Amazon cart, and paid for it.

Even when the files are recognized, they do not play properly and the TV gives incorrect property information like length of video.  You can also forget fast-forwarding through parts of files, too, as it will just skip you to the end of the files.  Helpful!The TV's firmware does not work (or at least mine does not), but Panasonic is more interested in giving bogus excuses from support personnel who have absolutely no idea what they are talking about, than simply fixing the problem for me, which involves a simple repair or replacement of the plasma TV.  Instead, I have been back and forth with them for a month now and have not gotten any resolution!  The first time they didn't even follow up with me after \"elevating the problem to Tier 2 support\" and I had to call back a couple weeks later myself.  As you would expect after my first encounter, no response was given to me within 2 days (Panasonic's own time frame), so I had to call again only to be told that they didn't have all the information they needed.  They had my number, so why not just call and ask?!  Because they don't care about solving the problem!  I finally got a call back the third time, and low and behold they asked for the same information again.  I am then told they are not looking into solving the problem, but instead are trying to find where things went wrong that don't involve the TV but rather the files or the network THAT EVERY OTHER DEVICE WORKS JUST FINE WITH.  That's what Panasonic calls customer service.  No thanks.At this point, I don't even trust them to even reflash the firmware on my TV (which is what the repair would be).

I was guided by the reviews I found in both Consumer Reports and CNET to the Panasonic VIERA TC-P55VT50.  I have several Panasonic products (including a 42\" TV) and have been pleased with their performance as well.  This TV did not disappoint!  The picture is great and the 3D picture (using a 3D source) is quite good.  The 2D to 3D conversion is NOT the same as a true 3D source.Pros: great picture and extreme tweaking available.  Quite good 3D.  Good array of inputs (4 HDMI).Cons: it is rather expensive!  It was Consumer Reports highest rated TV but not a \"Best Buy\" due to its price.  If you do not care for the 3D display look at other less expensive TVs.  It requires fairly expensive glasses ($50 from Amazon, $70 from Panasonic) that are not included in the box and must be purchased separately.Additional note:  There were several vendors that offered this set for less money than Amazon.  I almost went to Abes of Maine for the lower price.  Another vendor in California advertised a lower price and free shipping but then tacked on another $230 to insure the shipment (I had to call to get the added price becuase it was not posted anywhere on their web site).  I read the fine print a little closer on Abes site and saw that if the TV was defective, I would be responsible for the return freight (if I could even return it) and the free shipping was to the curbside.  The driver would drop the set off in my driveway but I would have to carry it in.  The set weighs 94 pounds and is rather bulky.  With Amazon I had \"white glove\" delivery.  The set was delivered by two men who carried the TV into the house, set it up, made sure it worked and then removed the box.  That level of service was available from other vendors but expect to pay an additional $250 for it.  With that factored in and Amazon's customer friendly return policies, my choice for vendor became easy.

Is a Kuro or Sharp Elite better? Haven't seen either, but you can't get a Kuro and I personally don't feel like paying the same amount as a decent used car as I should a tv. For the majority of people out there, the VT50 is truly the best tv available. You get full viewing angles, pitch blacks and very little to no motion blur. I returned a 70\" Sharp for this one. The Sharp doesn't come close to this one, and really if just going for size, just pick up a projector. The 3D on this Panasonic (and my 55ST30) are excellent and worth the cost of glasses. I was worried about plasma buzzing, but unless you turn the tv to mute and stick your head behind the screen, you hear absolutely nothing. Even then, it is very hard to hear it. Also, if you like the LCDs soap opera effect, this is the only plasma that I know of that has that option (I love it, most leave it off).I did have a couple minor things that I would have liked with this tv, but nothing that would make me hesitate for purchase. First, the single sheet of glass is cool, but the edges are still too thick compared to some other tvs out there. for the price of this, the picture should be \"floating.\"  Also, I can still see some motion blur in very rare scenes. If a character is moving quickly in front of leafy trees or grass, you see a faint bit of blur. Nothing compared to a LCD, but don't let people tell you there is NO blur.Finally, shop around and refuse to pay full price.

Get it off of the vivid mode however as you can do better.This set can get image retention because of the super high contrast and brightness.  Rant coming... So be careful watching CNN, ESPN or stations that have a continuous banner on them.  You can get a burn in.  I did and used the \"sweep\" feature and it got rid of it after about an hour of use.  These stupid channels need to make their banners 50% opaque.  They need to know that there are lots of folks using plasmas and this is a problem for them.  So email them all and complain.  Tell them they owe you a new tv if they dont change this crap.  Maybe they will turn them down some.  (Rant over)There are lots of websites with guides to how to tweak your settings.  They are all a bit different.  My recommendation is that you should create a setting for tv and a separate one for movies that come from your blu ray or dvd player.  One size does not fit all in this case.  Even though there are standards for calibration, personal taste can still come in to play.  Some like inkier blacks.  Some want to see more detail in the blacks. Some like more vibrant color and amped up reds, others like color more neutral.Just know that you can get this set to look like how you want so you should not be worried.

The difference is astounding. I'm not used to the clarity, contrast, and sharpness of this TV, and at times it can cause some fatigue issues for my eyes. It's like going from regular definition CRT to HD-LCD was originally. That said, I've not calibrated it yet, mostly just using THX Cinema setting for now. Don't use the speakers, don't use the remote short of looking through settings....or really much else of the built-in features...just the panel...and it delivers some amazing visuals. Can't wiat to try it with blu-ray, but as a computer monitor it's sick...-------Update, only a few days later (2-6-2013, arrived Jan 30, for what it's worth)After playing Xbox on it for a few hours, I have some light image retention (fancy term for burn-in, but this is early on, so it should be temporary...) - I've since then learned that by default, for whatever reason, THX Cinema has the pixel orbiter disabled by default, without a way to turn it on - end result - roasted pixels. As I had heard that Plasma Display Panels (PDP) are prone to image retention, I've been watching for any signs of it. Now, 3ft away, and looking for it, I can see where some of the game graphics had burned in (thanks to the HUD functions within games these days!) - so, with that, the only utility that the TV Comes with scrolles black and white bars left to right, to attempt to 'burn off' the image retention. After this discovery, I looked again, and sure enough, Pixel Orbiter was still disabled. I went to another setting (Cinema) and started going through the settings to try and match it up to the THX Cinema settings, and turned Pixel Orbiter on there. As I was flipping back and forth, I noticed that now Pixel Orbiter is now not locked out, and I can turn it on. I don't know what I did, as I've even reset the TV to defaults to try and replicate...and it's still disabled. From my point of view, it's a bug in the firmware...So, now I've adjusted the settings again on another profile to try and 'torch' the display using the black and white bars. After a few run-throughs, it seems to slowly be getting better as the other pixels get aged more closely to the ones that are IR'd. Makes sense...if you have something that fades with heavy use on a curve, no matter how slight the differences are, if you set it to apply the same juice to all of them, eventually they'll get closer in aging....With that, I've purchased a few DVD's that might make this an easier process, since the black and white bars run 15m max at a time, so you have to hang out with your TV while it does it, then do it again if needed, or exit the menus to avoid the issue from re-occurring with the TV's menu. Those are Disney's WOW and PixelProtector. One should be more oriented towards calibration, while the other should be more apt to image-retention issues.Anyhow, this update is more for anyone looking to purchase a VT50, thinking the burn-in issues of the past are gone. They may yet be gone, in the sense that it's not as permanent as a limb being removed, but, it does have image retention issues, which, coming from LCD, can be surprising how quickly/easily it can happen, and how stubborn it can appear to be to remove. That said, I am also posting this to future owners, to make sure they find a way to turn Pixel Orbiting ON, when there is static content on the screen for any length of time. I noticed the first night when I turned off the TV, that I could make our what was on the TV as I turned it off...15 minutes later. Granted, I have extremely good near vision (but too blind to drive without correction!) - but my point is, out of the box, the phosphors are very touchy...but will calm.So, as a recap:1. This TV is freaking awesome out of the box.2. Make sure you check that \"Pixel Orbiter\" is turned on, so that it will help reduce Image Retention.3. If you have Image Retention, you can get rid of it, just it will take a while. This is the temporary version of burn-in, which is permanent, and does NOT go away...ever!Update 2-7-2013...Well, all that doesn't matter as it has smudges between the exterior glass and the interior panel. The smudges appear like someone bumped it with exposed skin and didn't clean it off before assembly. Panosonic wants to send a repair person, but Amazon is shipping me a replacement and will pick up this one, no charge. Let's see how it goes. Kudos Amazon...Update (since then) - replacement panel arrived, this one is perfect. First thing I did was make sure the pixel orbiter is on, and after hours and hours of playing shooter-games, there's no image retention that I can see.

I have it connected to a Denon AVR-1912, so I didn't need 4 HDMI inputs on the TV.  Using the ARC function for the on screen Panasonic's apps works great, no need for an extra optical cable plus my receiver automatically switches the audio.  The Viera Cast apps are also pretty speedy compared with the Panasonic Blu-ray (BDT-110), probably due to the dual core processor on-board the VT50.  The Viera Cast apps are a bit cheesy, but there are some free apps for the kids and I especially like Amazon Video which works great.  I also have tried using my Samsung 3D glasses (SSG-3050GB, SSG-4100GB) and found they work fine with this TV.  I did notice that when I used 48Hz setting for 3D, I got a lot of flicker, so I stick with the standard 60Hz for 3D and that seems to work a lot better.  There's probably a lot more features here than I will ever use, but the price was right for this model as the new 2013s are now coming out.  Aesthetically, it looks great.  With the single sheet of glass, you don't have the protruding bezel like many other TVs.

Since the wireless connection failed, I tried wired and connected the TV to my router using an ethernet cable. That failed too. After some research, I wire connected the TV to my cable box directly and that worked. Then, I removed the cable from the cable box and connected it back to my router and that worked too. This made me wonder if there was a problem with my router - D-Link D655. Online research did not turn up anything about VT50 and D-Link conflicts.I asked for help at Panasonic support site. The help I received was the cookbook response, which did not help at all. I then called Panasonic support and the technician had me reset the cable modem and the router and the TV. This is when I lost my phone connection with the technician. So, I called back and ended up talking to another technician who for 5 minutes insisted that I was not entering my password correctly. I then demanded to talk to a supervisor because I was not going anywhere with her.The 3rd technician sounded good and asked the right questions. She had me reset the TV using the power and in 5 seconds the TV started connecting wirelessly and I was in business. Extremely happy I thanked her and claimed she was one of the best support people I know.Later on I turned my TV off and when I turned it back on - no connection. It seemed that the TV did not save the settings. I repeated the steps that the last technician had me do but no luck.So, I called Panasonic again and repeated my story. The 4th technician said that she needs to escalate my case and I would get a call back in a day or two. That was 4 days ago and I have not heard from anyone.The TV is now connected to the Internet via wire. But, there is way too much wire on the floor and I want to go wireless. This is why I paid extra to have a WiFi TV. The TV is great but Panasonic support is pathetic. I am not sure if there is a problem with the TV or there is a problem with the connection.---------Updated 1/31/2013. The TV is still great. The support is not. The TV does not retain the wireless setting and each time I need to reset the power (press and hold the power button for 10 seconds).Panasonic support does not return call at all. Their support website replies are canned word-for-word. It is obvious they do not even read the message. 99% of the URL's in their email where you are supposed to click to get answer get 401 error.I will be exchanging this TV with another Panasonic for the 3rd time.

The green and/or red snow you see in dark areas when you get up close to the TV is normal.

When I let the TV do this upscaling, instead of my TiVo, the picture looks a bit like a cubist painting, with blotchy colors and lost detail, especially on faces. I'm glad my TiVo does a much better job, but was surprised a TV of this price and caliber was so bad with this.- When I had questions about my TV, after numerous calls to Panasonic support I was unable to speak with someone who had first-hand experience with and knowledge of the TC-P55VT50.- I've found image retention to happen pretty easily, but also that it disappears just as easily, just from watching non-static video.", "Date": "March 26, 2013"}, {"Title": "MVPlasma", "Author": "M.

I ordered the TV On a Saturday and it shipped on 11 June and arrived 14 Jun.  I received a phone call on 13 Jun about the timeframe for my delivery and they even called me before hand as a heads up they were in the area per my request.  One person showed up to deliver but needed no help getting it off the truck as he had a lift.  We brought in the house and he was very quick to explain we need to move to the kitchen before we set it down as it dirt on the bottom and wanted to avoid messing up my carpet.  He unpacked it and I helped bring it to the living room so he could check the screen for any damage.  Then he put the stand together and I just helped lift it on to the stand when ready.  Took a total of 15 minutes once in the house, he stayed while we turned on the TV to check for any internal screen damage, and he also ran through the initial set-up with me which took about 5 minutes.  I would say excellent shipping and service from CEVA.Price Match- A couple days after my TV was delivered the price went down $24 and Amazon refunded that difference.TV itself: This is my first Plasma as I had an LCD for the last 5 years.  Just out of the box it was as good as my LCD.  The design is very sleek and just looks great.  My only gripe is for a TV that is considered the Top Tier it does not have a swivel stand.  I turned it to THX cinema which for me so far has been good enough, but the TV can get MUCH brighter than that I am just doing an initial break in period before I tinker with it.  After about a week or so now of switching between this TV and the LCD in my room I can start to see the differences, how the colors are much more vibrant on this plasma, everything just looks so natural colorful.  The blacks on this TV are amazing very deep and rich, sports programs I have had no issue with and they have looked great (NBA finals, US Open).  I have watched a couple blu-rays and they have looked good as well and I have no even calibrated it to my preference yet.If you fancy yourself a TV expert that will want to calibrate, this TV has many many options to do so.  It also has about 12 presets to include (Home Theatre, Game, Blu-ray, and DVD etc) then you can also customize those settings and it saves those changes.  It does not have an actual GAME mode but you can tell the differences pretty clearly.  Under the Viera tools and E-help you will find much more information on each setting than the book just to point that out.  But this TV is definitely worth the price tag in my book.I have my TV in a living room with a couple windows and it has done really well as far as being affected by the light and reflections.  It really has not been much different than my LCD (both same size 55\").  Of course at night it is even better which is what I have read.  There are 4 HDMI connections, a connection attachment for 1 component as well and 3 USB ports.  Also has a digital out for your audio and one of the HDMI ports is HDMI-ARC) the sound is Ok for this TV with its built in speakers, but I have it connected to my surround sound so I usually keep the volume at about 10.3D-I have not tried since I do not have any glasses, but 3D is not really appealing to me.OVERALL: Every day that goes by I notice something better about this TV over my last, the picture just looks so good (Just calibrated it to CNET review settings and it looks amazing).  I read a ton of reviews before making my decisions and sealed the deal after seeing one in person at a BB.  If you want an Awesome TV with lots of control over the picture then I think this is a very Solid Choice.  Again this is my first plasma so it's hard for me to compare against competing plasma's but vs. my SAMSUNG LCD it's not even close at this point.  It's at a very good price right now for this VT version so should be an easy choice if you like having the best.", "Date": "June 15, 2012"}, {"Title": "Panasonic 55VT50 Plasma TV", "Author": "Dennis Picano", "ReviewID": "R1Q99IK1901EQQ", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "Had to have this TV replaced once and may need to have the replacement replaced.

But girlfriend wanted to try a Samsung es7500 55\" so we did and returned the ST. The Samsung was good but not 1,000 dollars better ,superior styling but color wasn't good & motion problems. Anyways I decided to buy back the ST , found it for 950 tax free at pauls TV . Sent my girlfriend to buy & make the order when the TV was delivered my girlfriend surprised me with a 55\" VT 50 whoa !!! So happens she got a deal 1499 tax free delivered .  I was struck by the beauty of set mounted on the wall way better looking than the ST. Now here comes the issue when I set it up the picture looked extremely dim , I know that dimness depends on the setting so I switched to thx mode still dim but better. I told my girlfriend that I remembered the st being a lot brighter , with at least more vivid color. I mean the richness of color and depth of picture is what sets it apart from the LEDs , but The Vt seemed to lack it. I tried the thx bright room , the picture was better but it didn't pop , or make you say wow. Pauls TV has a policy of 30 days return with a restocking fee or a ten day policy for exchange with no fee. As I didn't want to return this set since it had to be better than the st , it's the top of the line , I looked up a review site & used their calibration. The color was more vivid but it had a lot of gradulation & artifacts with dark scenes . Long story I exchanged it for the ST 50 50\" inch . And my feeling were correct , even in standard the st has a better picture than any of the setting on the VT 55\" . Now being a man of reason I can't figure this out. Maybe I got a bad set , or maybe it needed 2 be calibrated which I couldn't do since I had to break it in , but it's hard for me to believe that the st out of the box picture blows the VT out the water , can't be . I'm watching the matrix now , and it outs a smile on my face , I watched the same movie with the VT and I remember thinking man is this high def. so VT owners please comment and let me know what you guys think as I don't know what to think. The thought of me picturing this picture but better wrap around the VT styling is killing me.

Black was black and there were no LED LCD issues of flash lighting, clouding, and blooming. The VT30 presented motion stutter in 24 fps content (movies) like crazy, but the VT50 pleased me with a feature that almost eliminates this. Black was black.A few weeks later, I noticed a vertical faint band that was 2 finger width and about 2 finger from right side. It was very minor so I ignored it because everything else about the TV was great.About 3 months later of little use, the band got darker and became obvious in normal viewing. Also, it seems that the TV got really faint horizontal band across the whole screen from playing Skyirm where the compass is on the top center. Black scenes revealed that there were lighter \"blobs\" and white scenes had darker \"blobs.\" Black seemed to have become more like really dark purple with the brightness fairly low. I began to notice that the TV gets really hot and doubles as a heater (I actually bought and area fan!), and I started paying more attention to the buzzing.I called for service and the panel was replaced after 1 week in a shop of some third party contract company that services dishwashers too. When I got the TV back, I turned it on and was shocked... the band was still there and only faded!...BUT WORSE, I saw dirt and tiny scratches in between the glass and panel, which apparently happens after a poor install (imagine putting 2 pieces of glass with a 1/4 inch gap and not get any dirt in between). Furious, I called the tech immediately and he said he was shocked anything was wrong.Many calls back and forth (oh man the pain and hassle of all of this), I went up the totem pole and spoke with a Panasonic representative about the band-thing that survived a panel replacement (supposedly impossible). He admitted that it was a known issue \"that passed QA\" and exists on all panels manufactured - some are worse than others. He also explained that plasma degrades after use in localized areas. Bright/higher contrast content causes that portion of the panel to fade in brightness and contract in comparison to the reset of the panel. Dark colors get lighter and light colors get darker, which dulls the picture. This is supposed to take a long time and mitigated by watching a variety of content that avoids localized bright high contrast content. Normal movies are okay, but games and TV channels are not.He forced me to accept a TV buyback and claimed he wasn't going to authorize another replacement. Panasonic warranty policy seems to fix if at all possible by replacing parts, with the panel being the last resort and generally the solution (leads to  dirt behind screen). They will replace up to 1 time and if there is a new year's model out or parts are not available. After 1 replacement, they will force a buyback. Going past the panel replacement step to a new TV is really difficult because by then your TV should be already refurbished and your issue supposedly fixed.Side points:This TV has poor motion handling despite all of the marketing of plasma 600hz blah blah forcefield blah blah. You have to turn on a single setting to \"smooth\" to get tolerable motion, but this blurs image detail considerably. Fast camera panning in games reveals a weird rainbow yellow/green motion trail. I can describe the overall fast pace action game experience as \"visually dull.\" Features like 96hz induce annoying flicker and are not usable.If you aren't used to it, short-term image retention is a lot more annoying than you'd think. It is mostly masked in movies, but can still be seen when scene contrast changes fast. It can be a real pain certain content.Plasma flicker makes stuff look like light snow up close. Coupled with natural video recordings dither artifacts, this TV makes stuff look like a bad blizzard instead of a solid color. Goes well with the buzz I suppose.Be warned that image-burn is a known issue with Panasonic Plasma and don't anyone fool you it isn't problem anymore. Be careful or find out the hard way. It isn't covered under Panasonic warranty, but Best Buy's Black Tie warranty does, so I recommend that. Samsung plasma seems to be more stable and resistant to image burn/retention, but their black performance is worse.Buy your plasma before Panasonic gets in line with other companies and discontinues it.

They have it still. I was told today 2-3 weeks for a replacement unit IF they agreed to replace it. The service shop has done well at communication--Panasonic has no idea what is going on. Net-net, I would buy from another manufacturer if I could roll back time.The other learning was that the service center really let me know I should have bought it locally as they could have returned it by now. Amazon gives 7 days--that's it. It arrived with 3 days left on that window and you have to call the service company prior to return. The service company couldn't come for 4 days. Therefore, in my case a return to Amazon simply wasn't possible. As many local companies match pricing and Amazon charges for tax--I messed up ordering this online.___________________________________Loud buzz coming from the TV since I bought it. I called Panasonic for help on the issue. Their support consisted of a very bored sounding lady asking me to do the basic things like turn off the TV speakers and try another HDMI port for the connection to the TIVO. Buzz persisted. They opened a support case and told me a local service company would call me in 3-5 days.Local tech company scheduled an appointment and came out (5 hour window). The tech did mostly Samsung by his own admission and screwed around in the back of the tv for an hour or so tightening screws on the boards. He decided it was a fan emitting the noise and ordered a replacement.A week goes by...The tech comes and installs the fan. The noise is still present. He moves on to more screw tightening and replacing the original fan. No joy. I convinced him to take the TV with him to get it fixed at their shop.A week goes by...All fixed. He brings the tv back and takes off. I plug in the TIVO and turn the TV on. Loud buzzing is present. Sigh. I call for an appointment with the same tech.He shows and calls Panasonic tech support as he is out of screws to tighten I guess.Pass on this TV, realize I got a bad one but it's not a great sign when local support can't help. They recommended that I take it back to my retailer. When they heard it was Amazon they were sad for me as it's a special delivery item and not something easy to return at all.Note, I have the 55inch version of the same TV also ordered the same day, delivered on the same truck.

With that in mind, I decided to remain technology and brand loyal and replace my 42\" Panasonic Viera Plasma HDTV (purchased in 2006 and still kicking ass on a daily basis) with this Panasonic VT50 Series 65\" behemoth.  I was super excited about this purchase that was essentially a Christmas present when it was to be delivered on December 14th.Being as I live in the Mid-Atlantic, I needed to allow the HDTV to warm up for a few hours after delivery.  Upon waiting for about 4 hours, I turned the TV on, only to hear the unit attempt to power cycle and then sit with a black screen and blinking Power LED (7 blinks...).  After doing some quick research, I found that the blinking service code I was receiving was essentially indicative that my unit was \"Dead On Arrival\".I called Panasonic's \"Viera Concierge\" and really got no apology for the fact that my purchase of their most expensive Plasma HDTV was now a $4000.00 paperweight.  I was then told that the earliest possible service date was tomorrow, December 20th between 0900-1300.  While I was completely displeased at this point, I willingly accepted this and decided to wait patiently until the scheduled date.  I should have sensed that the first warning sign was that I was offered absolutely none of Panasonic promises in the literature with their >47\" units to have defective units under warranty serviced within 2 business days, and that they also offer free 'Loaner' HDTV's for their inconvenienced customers.  When I received a call from the service company today, I was told that I would not be receiving service on the 20th because Panasonic had failed to transmit any information regarding this service issue to their service repair contractor until the Tuesday the 18th (THREE BUSINESS DAYS since time of my service set up).  I was then told that they would have to order parts and it wouldn't be until later next week when the service would actually be available.I called Panasonic back to find out what the hell happened, and why they had failed to communicate properly to the service provider the information that I had told them last week so that this problem could be fixed, why I wasn't offered an apology and why Panasonic was doing absolutely NOTHING to rectify the situation with any type of gesture to better the customer satisfaction of a brand loyal but extremely disappointed customer.  I was essentially handed an elaborate \"smoke and mirrors\" or for lack of better language \"Complete and Utter BULLS**T\" apology from Panasonic and was told that since I was requesting that Panasonic send me a new replacement TV that I would have to contact Amazon to handle the replacement.I could not believe that this was the response of Panasonic.  They offered me absolutely nothing to help rectify this situation.  When I asked if they would be willing to send a gesture of goodwill to a Panasonic customer of VERY expensive technology HDTV's ONE complimentary pair of their Panasonic VIERA TY-ER3D4MU Active Shutter 3D Eyewear which retail for less than $60, the Customer Service Representative literally LAUGHED at my request and said that \"While Panasonic deeply apologizes for the inconvenience to you regarding your television, Panasonic will not be sending you a complimentary pair of 3D Glasses\". Unbelievable.  They'd risk losing a customer who just spend nearly $4000 on one of their products over a pair of $60 glasses.Panasonic's Customer Service doesn't even deserve the designation of being Customer Service. I'm not sure if I'm going to keep the replacement that Amazon is sending me, or if I'm going to switch brands and get a Sharp Elite Black 60\" Pro-60x5fd Flat Panel 3d LED Hdtv - Pro-60x5fd.  I'm sure that Sharp will very much appreciate my business and hard-earned money and potential newly discovered brand loyalty.In short, if you're hell bent on having some of the best technological specifications in your television, then purchase a Panasonic VT50 series.  If you're willing to risk receiving some of the absolute WORST customer service that you will ever receive, then purchase a Panasonic VT50 series.  If you want to support a company that holds their customer's experience and satisfaction at ZERO value, then purchase a Panasonic VT50 series.

I expected to have this television for at least another 5 years (like previous televisions).One day while watching the TV, it abruptly turned off and would not turn back on. A small red LED light at the bottom of the TV was the only thing that flickered (blinking 11 times). I unplugged it and plugged it in again.  It would turn back on for a few seconds, before shutting off again (the red light blinking, mockingly).I called Panasonic and was told to bring it to a local repair shop where it could be diagnosed and repaired.  I was also informed me that my warranty had expired (the TV is only warrantied for 1 year) and I would be responsible for the repair costs.The TV repair shop diagnosed the problem as a bad A-board and fans.  The estimated price to repair it - $540!  I was shocked.  I called Panasonic and they said there was a possibility they would cover some or all of the cost. So, I sent the repair estimate and proof of purchase and waited to see if they would stand behind their top-of-the-line products and cover the cost of repair.I was told that I would hear back within 72 hours. 3 days later I still had not received a response. No phone call, no email.  I called customer service to find out what had happened.  The customer service representatives were friendly enough and confirmed that they had received my claim information, but they didn't know why I had not been contacted. They told me they would send a message to those responsible for repair claims and I should hear back from someone in 24-72 hours. 3 days came and went without any communication from Panasonic. Again, I called customer service. Though they were again friendly, I was told (once again), that I would hear back from someone in 24 hours.  I, again, waited and, again, heard nothing.  This scenario repeated for another 2 weeks and 3 more phone calls.  Finally (thoroughly exasperated and out of patience), I insisted on speaking with someone higher up.  I expressed my incredible frustration. My TV had now been at the repair shop for a month with absolutely no response from Panasonic! I had done all the work, repeatedly calling, spending numerous hours with customer service, each time re-explaining the situation.  Panasonic had made no effort to contact me.  After explaining this to the Panasonic representative and some discussion, he said all they could offer me was a little over $100.  I was offended, considering I had made all the effort and the repair costs were over $500 (a quarter the cost of a new TV!).  I expressed my disappointment and dissatisfaction and after more tense conversation, he said the final amount they could offer was $216.  I was forced to accept this, as it was clear the disaffected, monotone Panasonic rep would not offer a dime more.  I was left to pay more than half the repair cost.I am sad to say that all my faith in Panasonic products has vanished. If they are unwilling to stand behind the quality of their top-of-the-line products (less than two years old), then I fear the quality of Panasonic is not what it once was.

The short version is that Viera telephone support couldn't diagnose the problem ( we spent a lot of time changing a lot of settings - made no difference ) and then had an authorized srevice person come out to look at the unit, since they had \"no idea\" what the problem was. The service person came out and basically said he'd never seen anything like it before. He ordered and installed a new \"A\" board ( that controls just about everything in the unit ) and.......same thing. So, I asked for a replacement unit, figuring maybe this was a fluke.

Bright scenes ( like basketball ) will get brighter and gradually decrease to the original level or just drop back down ( no, it's NOT the flash strobes - happens all the time ). So, the unit's going back to BB, who matched an internet price BTW, of $1818. Their store price was $2499. Great deal. And we'll probably get a Samsung or Sharp. Also, there's a law company, Abington Cole (abingtonlawdotcom), that's looking for people to join a possible class action suit against Panasonic. Guess I'll call them tomorrow. It's a great unit when it works and then there's the rest of the time. Caveat emptor.", "Date": "December 20, 2012"}, {"Title": "\"Enhanced Shipping\" has left a bad feeling about TV", "Author": "J.

However, Amazon's Enhanced Shipping is worse then Best Buy's or any of the local stores - who will actually deliver the product to the room you need the TV and help with putting it on the stand.  Pilot Freight was used by Amazon to deliver this product and Pilot uses subcontractors who will only drop off the TV on the main floor of the premesis.  The would not assist in getting it on the stand and did not plug the TV in to determine whether it works.  Pilot would not deliver the TV to the basement where I needed it and I had to contact Amazon who had to contact Pilot who, after 45 minutes got the guys to take the box/TV to the basement.  They left the TV on the floor, packed up the box and left.  I now have to find a way to set up the TV on the stand - if it breaks, then I'm returning the product.", "Date": "February 1, 2013"}, {"Title": "Thanks  Panasonic for helping me choose Samsung", "Author": "Jay", "ReviewID": "R3CBLX8ND2UA65", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "Nice little trick raising your price $300 dollars a week before the Super Bowl. Unfortunately for you I've been keeping an eye on your tv a and your nemesis Samsung which is a 60 inch plasma e7000 series rated very well or better depending on who's giving the rating. Well you can bet your bottom dollar Im buying a Samsung come January 31th.  3 reasons:  first, I get paid on that date, second, on the next day Arizona starts charging us taxes I stand to save roughly 9% in tax, and third, SAMSUNG IS $400 freaking dollars less than you and 5 inches bigger!

Piece of crap TV when its like a talking billboard on my bedroom wall!.... what's next, is it going to turn itself on and play ads when it knows im home.....  buy anything else and show them its NOT ok to start this.
