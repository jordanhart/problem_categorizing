I have done a lot of the research and visited the HDTV enthusiast forums and looked high and low for the right TV in my price range. The TV I was told to buy from several sources was the Panasonic ST50. That TV was discontinued to make way for it's replacement (2013) model the ST60, so I got it. I have been nothing but pleased with this TV and it's features.If you want a superior quality pictures with all the right blacks and vivid colors, look no further. If you just want a great TV for the money, look no further. How this TV gets this quality at this price range is a mystery to me. It is a plasma TV, and there are some advantages and dis-advantages to that. Mostly advantages, but not for everyone. Disadvantages that might disqualify this TV to someone could be the weight, since plasma TVs are a bit heavier... so if you plan on hanging this somewhere that the weight might be an issue, get an LCD. Also if you view TV in the daytime in a room with a ton of windows for some reason (your likely watching soaps), you might want an LCD that handles highly lit rooms a little better. It is also a bit more fragile than an LCD and the glass is more likely to break if something hits it (kids toy, wii remote etc), you can buy a screen protector to solve that issue, but you will spend an extra $140 or so.Anyhow, I have compared this TV to the ST50 and the quality of the image is the same. They use identical boards and screen tech. The only noticeable changes has been updates to the Smart TV interface and options and the slight difference in appearance (ST50 had transparent plastic rim along the frame of the TV, the ST60 has a small silver rim. The remote is also slightly different, the new one is not backlit and the 4-way controller around the \"ok\" button is now 5 buttons and not one connected pad. The ST60 comes with two pairs of 3D glasses, the ST50 came with none. The ST60 can also use the new Panasonic Pen (does not come with the pen) that can be used to draw on the screen to alter photos, draw pictures and play games (seems like a useless feature, I would not let my kids advance on my TV screen with a pen). In every other way the same TV.Note: You should break in new Plasma screen TVs by allowing them roughly 100 hours of viewing before you watch too much TV with sidebars, Netflix interface and games with static HUD elements. They can potentially cause burn in if left on screen too long. Modern Plasma has mostly eliminated these issues, but it is a good idea to break in the phosphorus at the same rate if for nothing else to give your TV the best chance at a long life of use. Some people run color slides like a photo slideshow to break in their new plasma TVs... while this is not really necessary, it is common practice and I did it myself. It is just a good way to control the break-in process and it makes you feel like videophile (even if pointless).There you have it, my bloated review of an awesome TV.If you read nothing else, read this. This TV is a great buy. Amazon is a great place to buy this TV, so if you can afford it, and don't need the bleeding edge $4k TV... get this one it's just as good.", "Date": "April 15, 2013"}, {"Title": "An Outstanding TV for the 99%", "Author": "T. Dowdell", "ReviewID": "R152B7L1SA1P7D", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I am definitely not a videophile but am a techie.  So when searching for a TV to replace our twenty year old Sony tube (which is still great) I was able to catch on pretty quickly to new features.  Our list was fairly simple: light TV viewing, medium movie viewing, light video game usage, light web and apps usage, $1500 or less and 50+ inches.As my daughter and I drove to Costco she poured over the March 2013 Consumer Reports and had concluded that we should get a Panasonic plasma.  I like Panasonic but has reservations about plasma based on vague anecdotes about short life spans and energy use.  We arrived at Costco and were lucky enough to quickly find their electronics guru.  I described our criteria and he firmly recommended the Panasonic ST and VT plasma's but said Costco did not carry them.We looked around Costco's impressive selection and asked for guidance.  Features aside, our eyes easily picked out the sharpest pictures and they were the Samsung Smart TVs in the $1550 - $2800 range (we didn't bother to look at the more expensive sets).  The $1550 Samsung did not have 3D, had a plain plastic bezel and was at the high end of our price range so we were at an impasse.  The friendly guru reminded us that in his estimation, the Panasonic ST50 (exactly the one Consumer Reports raved about) or the 2013 version, ST60, was his first choice by far in our price range.  We left empty-handed.That evening we researched the Panasonic and found that it really was in a class by itself for the price, underscored by CNET's 5-star rave review.  So we headed to a local video store the next night and checked out their selection and came to the same conclusion: Samsung Smart TVs and a couple others had outstanding pictures.  But the Panasonic Viera 55\" ST60, at nearly half the price, stood fearlessly among the best.  The decision was easy.  Not surprisingly, the store was fully stocked on Friday but by Monday night had only one left in the region so we had to drive further to selfishly snag it.We've barely scratched the surface but setup was easy and the remote is fine though not universal.  The picture is jaw-dropping and is plenty bright in our fairly sunny living room.  The user interface is impressive and easy to navigate (Netflix, YouTube, web, etc.).  On a humorous note, my daughter downloaded the Panasonic app for her iPhone and commandeered the TV, rendering my remote useless.  Then, with a flick of her fingers, swiped a picture from her iPhone onto the TV screen.  We will send in the rebate to order a touch pen that allows drawing on-screen and, apparently, is free.Worth noting: because the TV's processing power is so robust, it is prone to something called the \"Soap Opera Effect\" (Google it).  This is not unique to Panasonic.  The TV interpolates frames to make the picture as smooth as possible.  In most contexts this is probably desirable.  But watching a movie I immediately sensed something bothersome.  The movie lost a certain richness and didn't look like film, but more a nicely produced PBS British serial.  Fortunately, a quick Googling provided guidance: simply turn down / off motion smoothing.  In the ST60's case, it's a menu option called \"Motion Smooth.\"  Upon turning it off, we were instantly dropped into the front row of a grand cinema.[update May 25, 2013]So far, the TV has worked flawlessly.  We still have not used the 3D feature.  No trouble viewing, regardless of room's light conditions or viewing angle.  The user interface is good and responsive.The apps are very cool but there is one major shortcoming: typing.  Unlike a computer, tablet or smartphone, each app handles typing differently.  So YouTube, Pandora, Web Browser, et al, each have a unique approach (i.e. non-platform standard) to accepting user input.  I could be wrong about this, but even though the remote has letters printed on the main number keys, they do not seem to work from app to app.  Instead, I invariably use the 4-point directional keys to \"hunt and peck\" each letter.  I do not (yet) know if this is user-ignorance, a shortcoming of the Panasonic's or smart TVs in general.On the Big-Thing-Little-Thing scale this is little.  All said, I would buy the TV again in a heartbeat.", "Date": "April 17, 2013"}, {"Title": "55ST60 - Excellent PQ!  TV had to be returned but I don't think it is Panasonic's fault", "Author": "MustangMichael", "ReviewID": "R48QT4X3RSRA6", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Upon arrival, the shipper said he really expected the screen to be shattered as the bottom of the box was VERY beat up and the tape barely holding.  Also, the shipper said he was concerned about holes in the sides of the box maybe from a forklift pushing it around or something.After about 14 days, the TV developed an intermittent fault where the power LED would come on but the screen would not come on.  It does this about once every 30 or so power cycles.  Turn it back off for a few and it would then come back on normally.  So that is why I'm returning this TV.  I am not knocking my rating of this panel down because I think the fault is likely because of rough handling by the shipper and is NOT Panasonic's fault nor is it Amazon's fault.Cedric L at Amazon has been very kind so far in starting the return process.  Also, Cedric L at Amazon is the guy who got the shipment \"unstuck\" immediately when it was seemingly not moving from Denver.  More good about Amazon:  When this TV was first listed, I purchased at 1699.99.  A few days later, Amazon was super friendly about price matching to Sears first at 1499 and then again at 1350 when I saw the price dropped further going from Sears cart to checkout.Amazon:  Very friendly, super professional.  The best, IMHO.Regarding the TV:  I'm not a videophile, so here are my limited observations:  I was absolutely astounded at the picture quality.  I participate in the AVS Forum, so I found forum participant D-Nice's custom calibration for the ST60 and this took it to a whole 'nother level of awesome.  I was amazed this calibrator lists his setting free gratus for AVS Forum members.  The pro menus for custom calibration apparently allow good calibrators like D-Nice to really dial things in.  D-Nice says he will have custom 3D settings listed soon...The sound is not very good, but I didn't rate the TV down for this as I've read that most panel TV's have kinda' limited sound as the manufacturer expects everyone to use an outside stereo system and I personally believe that most people probably do.The AR (anti reflective) filter works well and I can watch daytime TV with fairly significant amounts of light coming through supposed black out curtains.  The curtains are pretty weak for allegedly being \"black out\".  It is also acceptable with room lighting on.  There is glare in these situations, however, I believe if they made the screen totally anti reflective like old matte finish monitor LCD screens, too much picture quality would be lost just to get rid of the last of the glare.  So my take on this AR coating is:  It is the right amount to attenuate glare somewhat without taking away from this set's awesome PQ.The black subfilter strikes me as very effective.  Knowledgeable persons in the AVS Forum have tested the black levels and they are pretty extremely good.  Maybe not the best out there, but probably the best in a fairly budget oriented Smart TV.One negative:  The ST60 apparently has more background processes running than earlier generations of similar models.  Since the processor isn't significantly faster than previous models, there is quite a bit of added input lag.  I saw photo proof of actual tests by AVS Forum members with the knowledge and equipment to test the panel compared to the ST50 (last year's model) etc.  Unfortunately for gamers, the ST60 is considerably slower than the previous model returning gaming input lag between 80 and 107ms.  I am an amateur gamer on a PS3 so while I probably noticed a little difference, I didn't find it to be a deal breaker.  However, competitive gamers in AVS are reporting that it is just too much lag.My recommendation:  If you are an amateur gamer like me and use the TV less than 10% of your TV time for games, I believe this really is an amazing BEST BUY and I highly recommend it.  If you are a competitive gamer or use the TV 50% or more of your TV time for gaming, it may not be the best panel for you.How to know?  If you aren't certain on the lag issue:  Some of the AVS members say that their local Best Buy let them bring their game console in and try it out.  As for me, I knew within 10 minutes I wanted to keep the set regardless or input lag measurements.  I would rather the input lag had not degraded a lot from last year's model, but the price/PQ (picture quality) is amazing.  I think if you try it out as just mentioned in a showroom, you will quickly know if it is ok for you or not.However, even if you go to a showroom to check for lag with your game console, I still strongly recommend making the final purchase with Amazon.  Amazon has been extremely good to me over the years and NEVER MORE SO than now when this somewhat expensive item developed an intermittent fault.A+ for Amazon.  Panny needs to do better with the lag issue or other makers may leave them behind.  However, I still rate this TV an excellent value FOR CERTAIN BUYERS as already outlined.  Price compared to picture quality is amazingly GREAT!  (IMHO)edit:  Panasonic customer support has told several AVS Forum members that Panasonic will not be issuing a software/firmware update aimed at improving lag time.  People were asking them if they could make a new firmware allowing more background processes to be turned off allowing the panel to have less input lag.  Just so you know:  The answer is NO.  Just sayin'.I will update this review one more time to discuss how the return and refund process went.  I'm pretty confident I'll be publishing yet more positive feedback for Amazon.  These guys really treat me like I'm a customer.  I feel like I matter to them.", "Date": "April 20, 2013"}, {"Title": "Great TV and Words to the Wise", "Author": "The Multimedia Kid", "ReviewID": "R3M9KF7HJIIY36", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Beginning with some words to the wise: 1) Be sure to get a warranty. 2) Check out any issues that occur on your own rather than depend upon someone in a state of panic who thinks the has thrown a bundle of money away on a faulty set. 3) On the other hand, be wary of the numerous people who because they buy a set they think they have to recommend it.Only about 15 months ago I bought a Sony BRAVIA KDL46HX820 46-Inch 1080p 3D LED HDTV with Built-In Wi-Fi, Black, and I found the picture to be better than I could have imagined. But then a little more than two months after the warranty expired, the set died. Turn the tv on and it would turn itself off, displaying for a second or two its beautiful picture, followed by the ready light ominously blinking four times in a row. Fortunately I had bought an extended warranty. Sony wouldn't repair the set, but I got the money provided by the warranty minus the cost for a technician to come and verify the four blinks; they signify an electronic part, such as capacitor no longer functions (you can google to find out what the number of blinks, 1 to 14, signify on a Sony Bravia).Looking into to other brands, I checked out the higher end Samsungs, only to discover that they too frequently have a comparable issue, arousing some consumer groups looking to sue. Then I read about the Panasonic plasmas being highly recommended,though they like the Sony's and Samsung's are expected to be replaced eventually by OLED's. (Some reviewers claim that it will be some time before OLED and 4K will have the high res media to show.) There are also occasional reports of image burn-ins, seemingly, usually, by people who use the set for games.And on this site I saw that at least one or two people mentioned that their Panasonics did not deliver Netflix well. After going through different break-in routines recommended on the AVSForum and CNET, see below, I, too, found that Netflix would sometimes have a very dark screen, which increasing screen brightness did not improve to the extent needed.I sure did not want to have to pick out another set, especially since I decided that apparently they all can have some issues. It then occurred to me that Amazon offered 30 days of free technical support to those who buy tv sets from Amazon directly, and so I had tech support phone me. A polite person named Scott E. phoned, quite patient and I imagine excellent with distraught consumers. (I can be distraught, so I appreciate someone who can be patient, listen quite carefully, and try not at all to interrupt--capabilities which I tend not to possess and am too old to acquire.) He listened to what I had to say and then recommended some changes to the setup of the Panasonic and scheduled another phone call in a few days to see if the changes made a difference. In the meanwhile he sent me an email with some other ideas that had occurred to him. As far as I can see he was spot on. And I had never found, either on the Panasonic site, or the AVSforum anything comparable to the remedy Scott proposed: if Netflix, Amazon, etc., anything being streamed isn't bright enough: a) Turn the Eco Navigation off (that is change the setting to Standard). The Eco arrangement is supposed to conserve power. b) Turn off the feature that adjusts screen lighting according to the lighting of the room (Menu > Picture > CATS, set to off). Of course, at some point I may have to increase broadband speed, since my household is using up more and more of it, which entails waiting to get the streamed broadcast cached.Various people recommend a 100 hour or longer breaking period of the set, so that the phosphers age and become less susceptible to so-called image retention and burn-in.[For a skeptical stance on the subject, see: [...]There's a group on the AVSForum loyally devoted to a D-Nice who posted some images that can be put into a slide show and run on the ST60 (Menu > Media > (select the SD card that you have saved the images to) and slide show, to be run over and over; or use a flash memory card that you have saved the images to). The sometimes ambiguous information about the slides can be found, along with a zip archive of the slides, at: [...]I ran the D-Nice slides for about 70 hours but wondered if the job might not be done better if more colors were involved and if there were more movement of images, so I switched over to a free video called the Plasma HDTV Burn-in Clip, available for download from youtube: [...] . Some comments now associated with the clip will tell you how to download it from youtube. Look for such help if you're not familiar with the subject (I used a special video capturing for the Mac, but I now see I could have grabbed the file more easily; you can also download an archive of the file, but it is in a less than common format and therefore somewhat problematic).After a hundred hours dedicated to break-in with the D-Nice slide shows and the Plasma HDTV Burn-in and more time just watching the usually programming via Netflix and tv station broadcasts, the picture seemed to me to be much better than when the set was fresh out of its box. A very good picture indeed, though perhaps lacking the sharpness/brightness that I saw on my now dead Sony Bravia Hx. (Some guests told me that they didn't like the picture of the Sony LED; there may be a matter of taste here to be sure. Both the plasma and the LED pictures are fine with me.)Currently I have no interest in watching or trying to watch 3D, which I assume does not yet represent a technology ready for tv. So I have nothing to say on the subject of 3D and the Panasonic, which I see several reviewers address.Some reviewers remark on the quality of the sound from the ST60. It's better than what I used to get from the Sony and quite good enough unless you really do want home theater quality. The ST60 makes it very easy to switch to a home theater setup, much easier than what the Sony allowed for. The Panasonic support site recommended what I thought to be an amateurish way to switch (better than what they say, if you wanted to, you could just click the mute button on the remote control, as long as you've got the sound going into your home theater amplifier), but a proper way, it seems to me, is with the remote go to: APP > Viera Link > Speaker Output > Home theaterAs to getting the best picture, there sure are lots of settings available, and it's a bit of a pain to configure them. On the AVSforum, apparently many of the subscribers are waiting for the famed D-Nice to publish his settings. Some people, I gather, after their set is broken in, pay for a calibration service, costing $100 or more reportedly. Others buy a DVD such as Disney WOW: World of Wonder [Blu-ray]. For now I am using what was recommended by CNET, with some modifications to compensate for the need to boost brightness for broadband reception of Netflix, Amazon, etc.: [...]Some of the reviewers here write harshly about the Amazon white glove, or special handling, service for sets bought directly from them. One fellow didn't like the service and gave a one star to the set itself. (Dante might have a special place in the Inferno for his sort.)Both the tv sets I bought from Amazon were delivered by the white glove service, and each time the delivery guys carefully brought the set up a flight of stairs to the room I specified, unpacked it, hooked it up and tested. (I gave the damn dead Sony to the last crew, suggesting that maybe they could find a used part to replace the broken one). The bottom line, I suspect is that the quality of the service can vary according to where you live and who Amazon is using. Raise hell with Amazon if the delivery guys don't do the job properly. The crew that delivered to me said they had 29 local deliveries to make that day; I don't know how much of it was for Amazon, but Amazon can represent a lot of business to such companies and if it rebukes the subcontractors, they likely will listen attentively.Final point, I think the Panasonic remote is excellent compared to the one Sony furnished and to the stand alone ones that I tried. It might be nice to have more documentation, explaining for instance, why there are colored buttons on it that don't do anything when you're at different screens. Thus far I've experimented a little with apps for the iPhone and iPad to use instead of the remote, and though they seem easily usable, I haven't yet become entirely used to them to date, the Panasonic remote doing a fine job.", "Date": "June 10, 2013"}, {"Title": "awesome picture...after break-in", "Author": "denny19", "ReviewID": "R2H6D8K7PAKFFP", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I have researched Panasonic TV's for over 5 months. Switching from GT50, to VT50, to eventually landing the ST60. I'm glad I did.If i were to rate this TV right out of the box, i would have given it 2 or 3 stars. I was a little dissapointed with the picture, but keep in mind, this is right out of the box. I watched it on standard, vivid, cinema and I really wasn't getting a good picture. So for the first 12 hours i watched HD programming (no static images, no black side bars). I then turned to D-Nice.For those of you who don't know who D-nice is, he is supposedly a professional calibrater who is nice enough to post break-in instructions and calibration settings for HD TV's. It just so happened he had one for the ST60. So if i figured at this point I have nothing to lose. He recommended using Break-in (panel prep) slides for 100 hours. He provides a download for the slides. So i saved the slides to my external hard drive and plugged them in my TV and ran them for 100 hours straight.I didnt know whether i could watch TV in between running the slides, or had to run the slides for 100 hours straight. I couldn't find a clear answer, so just to be safe I ran them for 100 hours straight with no interruption.Now there is a lot of debate of whether break-in slides are even necessary or not. I cant tell you they are or aren't but I used them and had good results. Some people say that you will be fine just watching HD. For me it makes sense to use them because I think it does break the phosphors in evenly. Thats just my opinion.So after the 100 hours I calibrated the TV using D-Nice's settings and WOW. What a difference! The picture is superb and I am very very happy with this TV. I have the 60 inch ST60 and the picture is awesome after I did the slides and calibration.I havent used 3D yet so I can not comment on that. The one default of this TV from what I here is the input lag, and this is significant if you are a gamer. I stopped playing video games after Super Nintendo so its a non-issue for me.Now since these things are mass produced, what might work for 1 person may not work for another, I am just sharing my experience and what I did about it.", "Date": "June 19, 2013"}, {"Title": "Great TV picture, Terrible Customer Service", "Author": "Ben", "ReviewID": "R1QR6KRVMKBKJ1", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "This was my second Panasonic Viera TC-P65Sst series TV.  The first is a 50\" and I love the TV, the picture quality is just amazing.  I have had no issues with that TV.That lead me to purchase this larger TC-P65ST60-65\" TV, I knew I already liked the picture quality and knew it was a great TV.  Unfortunately about 3 weeks after I plugged the TV in a line developed across the middle of the screen.  This horizontal line was there whenever the TV was on.  The TV obviously is still under warranty so we called Panasonic.  There response was it is your cable box.  After testing various cable boxes and other devices it was clear the problem was the TV and not the cable box.  Panasonic asked that we send a picture we did and asked that they send a technician out to fix our brand new TV or replace it.Unbeknownst to me when I purchased this TV Panasonic's idea of customer service is blame others (Cable companies) and offer no real remedy.  A week after the problem presented itself Panasonic still hadn't even acknowledged that the problem was something to do with the television.Luckily we purchased the TV through Amazon and the customer service folks at Amazon stepped up to the plate and went above and beyond what I believe a retailer should have to do.  They offered to exchange the TV and have shipped us a new TV.  I haven't had a chance to set that one up yet, but I hope it works well because I know how Panasonic will offer to help.  Panasonic still never accepted there was a problem.

Plasma produces a far better picture to my eyes than LCD and this TV delivers a magnificent picture.I used the settings provided by CNET and sat down to test it out watching the first scenes of Prometheus. The difference in definition was night and day with the Sharp. Details in the rocks, the sky, and the breaking clouds, was exceptionally clear.For my first full movie, I watched Phantasm 2 on Blu Ray. I was blown away by the picture quality. The colors are lush and the blacks are as deep as outer space. Deep blacks are where this tv excels. Shadows looked so deep... I enjoy my movies so this is really impressing me thus far.I tried to watch Creature from the Black Lagoon in 3-D, but my the television \"told me\" that I needed a 3-D blu ray player too, which I didn't know. I really wasn't looking for a 3-D TV to begin with really. I did try it by using an On Demand 3-D movie on surfing and it looked fine.Some reviewers complained about an input lag on video gaming, mostly people playing first person shooters like Call of Duty and such. I'm more of a fighting game/sports game player and I noticed no lag at all thus far playing my favorite games. In NHL 2013, my passes were as crisp as ever as well as my shot. In Injustice, I was able to pull off the same fighting combos I was before and noticed no lag at all. Is it possible the lag being mentioned is caused by a lousy internet connection or something? This was seriously something I was worried about but it seems to be a non-factor in my case.As far as delivery goes, well, the \"white glove\" treatment consisted of two guys who proceeded to speak their own language to each other while in my home for 10 minutes, so I could understand nothing they said at all. Only English I heard was, \"See? Tv work?\" and \"sign here.\" They weren't exactly \"spring fresh\" either, but I can understand a guy putting in a hard day's work. Still, I felt it was a bit rude to go on and on in another language, and it made me feel a little uncomfortable.Overall, I'm fairly impressed with how Amazon handled my particular situation and recommend Amazon Prime to those that do enough business to merit the cost. Lisa, Emily, Oscar and Ed in customer support could not have been more pleasant to deal with.As for the TV, I've only had it a few days and it blows the Sharp out of the water. My advice to Amazon customers considering a television purchase is to go with the best reviewed TV you can afford. When you think about it, a lot of time is spent watching our televisions, especially folks like me that enjoy video games, sports and movies. You might as well get something that provides the best picture you can. This Panasonic plasma delivers a great picture with inky, dark blacks, lush colors, and crystal clear definition on Hi-Def.Thus far, very impressive!As for this TV, well, it was a little more than I had originally budgeted, but so far it seems to be worth it.EDIT:If you are looking for a full internet browsing experience on this TV, you will be disappointed. The TV does not allow Flash for whatever reason. Pretty lame to say it is a \"smart\" TV if you can't even surf the web normally. If anyone knows of updates to fix this, please leave a note here. I bumped off a star for this, but it isn't a deal breaker for me. In hindsight, the Sharp TV offered a better web browser by far.

The digital on-screen graphics from baseball games (for example) take many, many hours to disappear. Even leaving the screen wipe on overnight doesn't completely remove them. And I spent enough time in the menu during the initial calibration that the VIERA logo from the menu has \"burned in\" so badly that it is still faintly visible a month later. I highly doubt that IR is this stubborn on the F8500, so that - along with brightness - is a reason to consider purchasing that model instead of a Panasonic.Line bleed hasn't shown any improvement yet.Color temperature had gotten quite a bit warmer since my first calibration (color temperature gradually shifts warmer on all plasmas as they age).Color is more accurate after the second calibration. Average color error with Color Checker patterns is 0.85 dE.I still love this TV, but the ABL and image retention are significant flaws.Original Review:------------------------------------Pros:+ Black level is excellent. My meter measures it at 0.003 fL, resulting in an on/off contrast ratio of ~13,500:1 and an ANSI contrast ratio of ~8,100:1.+ Overall post-calibration color accuracy is good.+ I haven't noticed any significant color gradation problems. Reviews indicate that this is still an issue on the 2013 Panasonic plasmas, but I really haven't found it to be a problem.Cons:- This is not a bright TV, even by plasma standards. At high or even moderate APL, the TV's luminance is severely limited. It's noticeably dimmer than my older, cheaper plasma, much dimmer than the Samsung F8500 plasma, and obviously much, *much* dimmer than LCDs. ABL is worse than I was hoping for. If you are highly bothered by ABL and/or will be using the TV in a bright room, then you should strongly consider buying an F8500 instead of a Panasonic model.- Line bleed has been noticeable during normal viewing on several occasions. I'm *hoping* this is something that may diminish as the panel ages.- Image retention has been a problem. Static images such as station logos or sports scores can cause persistent IR. Like line bleed, I'm *hoping* this may improve as the panel ages, but it likely won't.- Pixel noise/dithering is not bad enough to be highly distracting, but it is bad enough to be noticeable (from a relatively close viewing distance).- The bezel is reflective and tacky.- The pedestal doesn't swivel. Swivel stands seem to be going extinct as manufacturers dump money into features like comically useless touch pen compatibility and gaudy chrome trim.- Panasonic is the only company I know of that configures power lights to be on when the TV is on and off when the TV is off. Most manufacturers design the power LED to be on when the TV is off and off when the TV is on so the light isn't a distraction when using the TV.- Like all plasmas, the ST60 buzzes, but the buzzing is so minimal that I don't consider it to be a notable flaw. My other plasma buzzes louder than this.Other:* Color temperature shifts warmer with larger fields (higher APL) and cooler with smaller fields (lower APL). Issues like this are normal on plasmas, and it seems pretty minor on the ST60.* The picture settings on this TV are a step forward for Panasonic's mid-level plasmas, but they still lag behind what is found on some competing televisions and the pricier VT60. Because the ST60 has 10-point white balance instead of 20-point, I was unable to perfect the color temperature below 10 IRE (it is too red). And secondary colors, especially cyan, would benefit from a CMS.* I haven't used 3D, smart features or the internal speakers, and I haven't done any gaming on the TV. So I can't comment on any of that.* No problems with the delivery - a couple guys came over, assembled it, and it was all over with pretty quickly.Overall, this is an excellent TV. The negative points that I mentioned are mostly just minor gripes. The only thing that I consider to be a major flaw is the ST60's luminance limitations. ABL on the ST60 can be easily noticed with a lot of normal content. If you look at a VT60 next to an F8500 in a Magnolia room, you will see the difference - it is pretty striking. My meter measured peak brightness at ~52 fL, ANSI white at ~24.5 fL and full field white at ~13 fL. Those are worse brightness levels than my much cheaper 2010 720p Zenith plasma. Other than that, this TV is everything that I hoped for.I calibrated my 55\" ST60 with an X-Rite ColorMunki Display colorimeter, and if anyone is interested, these are the settings that resulted from the calibration [Updated 1/11/14]:Picture mode: CinemaContrast: 83Brightness: +2Color: 46Tint: 0Sharpness: 0Color temp.: Warm2Vivid color: OffC.A.T.S.: OffVideo NR: OffMPEG NR: OffMotion smoother: OffPro settingsPanel brightness: MidAGC: 0Black extension: 0Color gamut: NormalW/B detail adjustmentW/B High R: -4W/B High G: 0W/B High B: 2W/B Low R: 1W/B Low G: -1W/B Low B: -110 IRE: -24, 0, 2820 IRE: -8, 0, 1230 IRE: 0, 0, 440 IRE: 0, 0, -550 IRE: 0, 0, -560 IRE: 0, 0, -370 IRE: 0, 0, -180 IRE: 0, 0, 190 IRE: -2, 0, 1100 IRE: -2, 0, 8Color detail adjustmentRed hue: -8Red saturation: 32Red luminance: 3Green hue: 16Green saturation: 40Green luminance: 1Blue hue: -2Blue saturation: -10Blue luminance: -5Gamma detail adjustmentGamma: 2.610 IRE: -1920 IRE: -1030 IRE: -540 IRE: 050 IRE: 060 IRE: 070 IRE: 080 IRE: -190 IRE: -1100 IRE: -3", "Date": "October 5, 2013"}, {"Title": "Best Price performer right now", "Author": "Amazon Customer", "ReviewID": "R1U7MMT7S1QUF2", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "We are now on day three with this TV.It is a fantastic product, built in wifi, applications that actually work (amazon Prime Video is a great example).Like others, I want to break the screen in properly so I am using some patterns to age the screen.

People get sold on the fact that LED TVs are brighter but unless you're going to watch TV on a beach, the brightness of the ST60 is plenty.  The other perception about Plasmas is that they use a lot more electricity than LEDs but if you do the math it's only $15-$18 more per year and Plasmas are cheaper than comparable LEDs so at the end you're actually paying less.Why is the plasma picture and in particular the picture quality on the ST60 very good, for starters the black levels, the darker the black the more the other colors will pop and this TV set has some of the darkest blacks ever before the more expensive Panasonic VT60 and ZT60 were released.  The other reason the picture on this TV is better than any LED is uniformity, edge lid LEDs suffer of uneven picture, especially noticeable on bigger screens like 55\" and up.  You would have to buy a more expensive full-array LED backlighting with local dimming TV to get close to the picture of any plasma for that matter.I read a one star review on the ST60 because of lack of bluetooth (not sure if it is true or not) and poor 3D but call me old school but I still buy a TV for the picture quality, because that's what it's primarily going to get used for in my house for thousands of hours (this screen rated for 100,000 hours).  3D is still a little bit of a gimmick, the best TVs have 3D so not a big deal with me, I watched a few movies with my kids and they got tired of 3D already and prefer watching movies in 2D.This TV is best value on the planet!", "Date": "June 1, 2013"}, {"Title": "Best TV of all time! (Input Lag is discussed in this review)", "Author": "Gamble20", "ReviewID": "R3CDO2TTI4JGI6", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "By now you have probably read other reviews praising this TV and explaining all the basics. So I will only briefly cover them:- Best Picture Quality/Black Levels I have ever seen without spending $1800+, and even in that class it is often just as good!- For Plasma beginners, make sure to go to cnet and get good picture settings to start out (just google \"best st60 settings\") after you have got a solid 100 hours put in (or even if you don't, IMO, its best for beginners)- The 3D isn't the 'best', but it is very good and people who just want a cool 3D experience will be very happy. Also, it is very cool that you can up-convert any 2D signal to 3D (and I mean ANY signal, I even tried it on I Love Lucy... which was terrible but none the less an impressive attempt)- Daytime performance is fine, sometimes you overthink yourself when you read reviews that say \"LED performs best in daytime viewing\". That is undoubtedly true in the sense that LED produces a brighter picture generally speaking, and some Plasma's do indeed have some pretty low brightness causing high reflections. However, the ST60 class includes a special filter to reduce reflections and has very strong brightness for a Plasma. In other words, it shouldn't really bother you. Don't expect fantastic mind blowing performance, but you can feel secured that you will still love it. The absolutely jaw dropping evening performance alone is worth it.- Smart Features are plentiful and work well (I love how Panny includes a Netflix button). Nothing you can't already get out of your regular video game system/Apple TV or Roku, but still it is convenient sometimes to have this stuff built in.Now on to the non-basics that many people are wondering about....INPUT LAG: I play Call of Duty and many other FPS as well as some other games like The Last of Us, mostly as a gamer somewhere between casual and hardcore. I am not a diehard COD gamer or anything, but I do play it a few times a week if I have time. However, I purchased a PlayStation 4 soon after acquiring this TV so I can't speak to the performance of \"last gen\" game consoles. For PC and next-gen gamers, I can report positive results. On next-gen consoles it performs pretty well (with Game Mode ON!). I have put about 15 hours into Call of Duty since the end of November, and for the most part I do not notice it at all. Other times you get a MINOR sense that it is there, but I think I am just trying to find something to blame when I get killed (you know its never your fault when you die). For PC gamers, you are probably going to need some time to adjust to it. This is because most PC gamers are very picky (I mean that with no offense) and they are used to very low input lag. For some reason, the ST60 handles console games a lot better then from a PC in my experience. Overall, if you are a regular console gamer who plays mainstream shooters like Call of Duty and you want very badly to buy this TV but are frightened by the input lag stories... don't worry and just buy it. You will be very happy. Trust me on that one. For PC gamers, you will just have to make the hard choice. Get one of the best value TV's ever made and adjust to some minor lag, or take it down a notch to the still-fantastic but not as good S60 (which has half the input lag, much more on par with regular TVs for a great price).Finally, the price. Even at the current price (Amazon is showing $1199 for the 50\" presently), it is well worth it. I love this TV and it is one of the best electronics I have ever bought in my life. With that said, it is sort of a catch 22 when it comes to finding your best deal. On one hand, Panasonic is no longer manufacturing them or any Plasmas (very sad, as they were the best in the business) so most retailers are trying very hard to clear as much stock as possible and are cutting the margins very deeply. However on the other hand, much of the stock clearing has been ongoing since the summer and it is getting very hard to find these televisions, which actually drives demand and price back up to regular levels. In my case, I bought an S60 for $599 from Sears, and they did not have it in stock even though their website said they did when I purchased it. However, the manager was unbelievably awesome (and a bit of a moron) and price matched an ST60 for the same price! So, while you may want to be patient and wait for a great deal (I've seen 60\" for $997 at Fry's and Microcenter), you also run the risk of those deals never happening again with retailer inventories so incredibly low. If you can snag one for less than $1200, you did well and you will be satisfied for a very long time.Good luck! Overall I would grade this TV a 9.8 out of 10, because NO TV is perfect.

I was terrified of the dreaded \"burn in\".  I bought this TV for the bedroom and my wife has a habit of leaving the TV on through the night.  So you never know what might cause a \"burn in\".I've had this TV for just over a month now and have watched just about everything, sport, sports news, HDTV, SDTV, blueray, movies with letter boxing...everything with the exception of a PC and video games.  I have not noticed a hint of burn in!  I am now at the point where I don't even think about it.Picture quality:All of the other TV's I have owned have been mid range LCD or LED.  This TV blows them away in picture quality!  Blacks are actually black!  Now, if you are use to LED this set will initially appear somewhat dark overall, but I have learned that brightness does not make for a quality picture.  If you like bright, this TV can certainly do it, but you probably will find that you don't need to bump it up too much.  I have tried a few of the calibration settings people have posted online and am currently using the CNet calibration settings and they are pretty good. There are tons of pro level calibration settings on this TV.

I do use a sound bar for movies, but the TV sound would be perfectly acceptable if that was all I had.Other items:I wasn't too interested in the smart features of this TV, but Netflix, Vudu, and Amazon video all work fine over the built in WiFi. What I was more interested in was connecting it to my DLNA server and streaming content from my NAS.  While I have been able to connect to the NAS with DLNA, it doesn't always seem to find the server.  I am not sure if it's the TV or the server, but my LG blueray player has no problem finding the server so I assume it has someting to do with the TV but have not been able to figure it out.The power connection on the TV seems to be in an odd place. It made it very difficult (almost impossible) to get my wall mount bracket on.  Not sure why Panasonic would put the power connection directly below the wall mount screw points.The Remote is OK, nothing fancy. I wish it had a deducted sleep button though. To set up a sleep timer (30 minute increments) you have to go through the menu's. Eh3D is OK, I have only used it a couple times and it didn't impress or upset me.

My friend purchased the VT60 and when I saw that tv I was blown away!  I read some reviews about this one and with an impending bonus, I figured my friends suggestion was valid.  I scoured over every review I could find about this tv.  I watched youtube videos over and over.  I went to BestBuy after work and on the weekends to see it in person.  The first thing I'll say about that is don't judge the tv from a wall in BestBuy.  The tvs they have next to this one are over the top bright, which will make you think this is an inferior tv.  It is absolutely not.  It does appear dark in the showrooms, but that means the colors are pure.  That being said, here's what I liked about the tv.Pros:I'm going to try and keep the pros simple.  The picture is beautiful.  Rich colors, deep blacks, the best in this price range and even in more expensive price ranges.  It's not as bright as an LCD, but trust me brightness does not mean high quality.  The sound is acceptable, but I would recommend external speakers for eveyone. 2.1 or 5.1 is ideal.  3 hdmi outputs (1 hdmi arc, audio return channel, allows sound to be sent back through the hdmi cable), 1 optical port (for high quality sound), 1 usb port (excellent for flash drives, plays most movie computer formats, mkv mp4 etc.).  The tv is thin.  Bezel and stand are standard.  They don't detract or shine.  3d is great, but can be jittery in fast moving scenes (I recommend using the Motion smoother at the maximum setting).  It's a smart tv so it connects to the internet wirelessly or hard wired.  All standard apps.  Internet is crap like all other tvs.  Just use your computer.  The remote works, what else needs to be said about that.  The price is brilliant for the performance!  It comes with 2 pairs of 3d glasses.  I personally love 3d so this is a big plus.  The screen is not reflective so you won't be looking at yourself in the tv.  Lastly \"Motion Smoother\" in the picture settings.  Most people hate this as they say it creates a \"soap opera\" effect because it cuts out the blur from movement.  I love the way it looks.  This is a personal choice though.Cons:This thing is very heavy.  Do not try moving this by yourself.  It's very hard to move because of the awkward size and weight (it is a plasma).  Gets fairly warm, so it helps kill 2 birds in the winter months!  Every time you start the tv a panel pops up allowing you to view the regular screen or the settings/apps.  You have to hit enter on the remote to get this to go away.  This becomes a pain after a while, but it's a minor gripe and a lazy gripe.  I've read you can change it in the settings but I haven't.  People say there are ads, but they're very tiny and I don't notice them.  They're on the original menu screen when you turn on the tv.  When watching the regular screen (tv, dvd, bluray, whatever) you don't see these so called \"ads\" so don't fret about that.  3d doesn't handle the fast scenes very well.  It's not unwatchable, it's just you can't really focus on anything.  I believe they call this cross talk, so your left and right eye doesn't know what to focus on.  Very minor, use motion blur at its highest setting to help with this.  Also use the \"Cinema\" or \"Theater\" picture setting when watching 3d because it'll help offset the darkness of the 3d glasses.  Older video games not in 1080 hd will look awful.  Think about it this way, the tv is so good that it's going to show you the faults in inferior devices.  I have a wii and it looks terrible on this tv and that gets us into the last and only major gripe about this tv, input lag.  I'm hesitant to even mention this because I don't think you'd really notice it if someone didn't point it out to you.  Input lag is basically a delay in signal from a source to your tv processor.  So say you're watching a movie and your bluray or dvd player sends the picture and the sound signal to your tv, it takes your tv however much time to receive that signal from the player through the connector cords (i.e. hdmi cable) and a particular amount of time to process it though its processor.  I noticed it initially when watching Netflix.  The ST60 processor is not as powerful as the VT or ZT60 models so it takes a little longer to process all of the information.  I only noticed this on netflix when I was watching a movie that had a Dolby Digital or a DTS 5.1 surround sound signal.  The picture and the sound seemed to be out of snyc.  I had an HDMI cable running from my bluray (panasonic bdt330) to my tv and I had an optical cable running directly to my surround sound.  This was an extremely discernible difference.  I think this was also an issue with Netflix, but it brought to my attention the slight input lag of this tv.  The reason I think it was really Netflix is that the center speaker signal was coming out of my left speaker.  This happened for a week or 2 and of course it was right after I purchased the tv.  I was terrified thinking I bought an open boxed tv that I would have to return.  What a nightmare when you have an 80lb tv, you live by yourself, and don't own a car.  What a pain this was going to be to return.  I kept watching hoping it was a Netflix problem and it was.  But if I really pay attention to the persons lips and the sound coming out of my speakers there is the slightest delay.  Like I said this is only when I'm hyper aware of this and I'm starting to think this is merely a placebo effect.  I've also read about this with video games, specifically in the 1st person shooters.  I've never tried a 1st person shooter on this tv so I can't tell you if there is a major difference or not.Overall, if you're not rich and want a briliant tv, buy this one.  If you can afford a more expensive tv, consider the VT60.  Watch the opening sequence of Prometheus to see how beautiful this tv can be.  If you love video games, try to demo this tv first because input lag can be a killer.  In the end, you can't beat the quality and price of this tv.  So don't fuss around, this tv is worth investing in.", "Date": "September 19, 2013"}, {"Title": "Originally went with LED, but so glad I returned it for this plasma!", "Author": "Christopher J.

The LED TV looked nice and the picture was good, not great. When it came to dark images, it was simply awful -- and really only gave the best viewing when you sat directly in the center of the TV, so not ideal for a living room setting with sitting areas at an angle. I sent the LED TV back and decided on this Panasonic Plasma.I had never owned a plasma, and I admit that I probably was swayed from buying this one initially (despite critically acclaimed reviews) as I had always heard about the downsides of plasmas.

This TV delivered with amazing results. From the moment I set it up, I knew that I had made a great decision. I just wish I had gone with it initially so that I could have avoided the stress of my LED purchase. As for other features, I have not yet tried the 3D or many of the smart TV functions, as most of my time is spent watching movies and sports. I have played some Wii on it, and that has been fine. I have this TV in a living room that has one window on a side wall, and this has not caused any issue with brightness affecting the picture.So yes the plasma is a little heavier than and LED, and yes it does give off a little extra heat (which you will never notice unless you are watching TV inside a small closest where you are only a foot away from the screen). I was a little worried about burn in issues, but that has also proven to be non existent with these newer plasmas. I watch ESPN a lot which has the ticker at the bottom, yet have not had any issues. I do watch a variety of other programs as well, so I think as long as you watch a variety of channels and movies, you'll be fine.If you're on the fence, don't be afraid of going for the plasma.

Those of you who have been on the fence about this tv and have already done your research/homework should probably just move forward with your purchase as you will have some difficulty buying a new television this year at a better value.I purchased this television from Amazon after returning a similarly priced/sized Samsung television to a \"big-box\" store several weeks prior.  To be fair, the Samsung was an entirely different technology (edge-lit LED).  However, the Samsung had significant issues with uniformity of brightness and contrast that I found to be bothersome in everyday viewing.  This is less likely to be the case with plasma televisions as the result of the differences in technology.  At the time of my Panasonic purchase, a number of initial reviews were starting to become public on third party sites such as CNET.  In fact CNET gave this one of the best ratings ever given (it's first 5-star rating).  In addition a number of reviews by those who had purchased the tv were available on Amazon and AVS Forum.  Since that time, Home Theater magazine has rated this television a \"top pick.\"I would encourage those who wish to learn more about this tv to spend a bit of time reviewing these resources if they still have uncertainty regarding this television.  Due to the broad reviewer set and now ownership base of this set, you should have excellent resources to explore the pros/cons of this television in particular.  To be sure, this year's lineup of Panasonic televisions has been proven to be the best ever, especially across the high end, yet this is still the best value in a beautiful picture.Those who really wish to refine their picture once they purchase this tv are encouraged to enlist some of the setting recommendations on AVS Forum (I used the well described settings by user \"d-nice\") or CNET (David Katzmaier as reviewer).Pros:1) Outstanding contrast and black levels2) Uniform picture presentation and colors3) Liquid picture quality4) Great 2D performance5) No evidence of burn-in (a concern with older generation plasma televisions) in my use6) Good connectivity7) Outstanding off-axis viewing with minimal glare (we use this in a very bright room with multiple adjacent windows)8) Reasonable selection of integrated apps (Netflix, etc).Cons:1) This has not faired as well as other sets in 3D performance in most reviews2) Gaming has been described to be a bit of an issue with a concern for \"input lag\" by some reviewers3) Plasma televisions are generally heavier than their LED counterpartsComments:1) No \"buzzing sound\" which has been a concern with some prior plasmas2) This is sometimes a difficult television to purchase based on availability/popularity3) Amazon shipping was included for me as a \"Prime Member,\" but based on your location delivery may take some time to occur4) I've not used the optional \"pen\" or \"camera\" as we are primarily using this television for 2D viewing of High-Def content from various sourcesMy family does not use this at all for 3D viewing nor gaming, just for viewing of 2D high-def content.  For this purpose, this television has produced one of the most beautiful pictures I've ever seen.  It has been made much more enjoyable by the application of custom settings - which do take a bit of time to apply, but are worth the effort and are well described in the references above.In addition to our lack of need for lots of 3D viewing and/or fancy gaming feedback, I also wish to point out that a number of future technologies may eventually surpass the picture currently produced by the best plasmas (including this television).  These include a potential for OLED displays as well as the onset of 2K and 4K panels.  While these future implementations of viewing are exciting to consider, my goal in this purchase was to buy a reasonably-priced television for my family that would produce outstanding picture quality with today's typical inputs (1080i DirecTV, 1080p Blue-Ray, and streaming technologies such as Apple TV and Netflix).

The ST60 lives up to its reputation, delivering far superior picture quality of tvs double the price from Samsung, LG, Sony, and Vizio.  Plasma tvs no longer suffer from burn in issues, and have thin bezels and slender profiles just like LED tvs.  Basically, until OLED technology becomes less expensive, Panasonic's Viera televisions will be the best looking displays out there.As an addendum, I will say even 4k televisions will likely not perform as well as 1080p plasmas.  What differentiates plasma from LED is the grayscale and black levels.  In other words, the only way you can see all the pixels on your screen, is if your tv can output different gradations of light for each pixel.  LED technology relies on wide blocks of light across thousands of pixels, whereas plasma technology and illuminate and darken pixels individually.  This translates to color gamut and saturation as well.

Broke it in a little and plugged in D-Nices calibration settings. Picture got even better, if thats even possible. I went large this year because Panasonic has stated they are not developing more plasma technology, instead they are focusing on other technology (probably OLED). With that, and 4K taking years to develop, become affordable, and content available, I figured now is a great time to get a great TV.

I have not noticed any IR at all, and only has very slight (normal) buzzing on very white screens that you could only hear next to the TV with no sound at all.

Smart TV functions are largely a joke, who actually uses their TV for that stuff? But you can set it to default right to the actual TV when you turn it on, so thats not a problem at all.

The initial estimate was 2-3 months out but it turned out they ship what they can get their hands on & so I actually got the TV in 2-3 weeks after ordering.Unfortunately, the white glove service delivery is nothing more than bringing in the TV into your front door & unboxing it & plugging it in.  They DON'T bring the TV any further than just inside the front door - so beware.2) Looks - the ST60 vs. 2012's CNET value perfomance TV - ST50 has a silver bezel insert that surrounds the TV all the way around.  At first I was worry that would distract viewing but alas, it was not noticeable at all!  Otheriwse, the TV, while not bling bling like the newer Samsungs or LG, is tastefully classic in looks & very thin itself.3)  Picture - as every1 else knows, there is nothing like a plasma picture esp. when the settings are optimized.  I don't worry too much about blacks, since that is reference stuff on this Panny.  However, I am surprised that out of the box with just the \"Standard\" picture setting & taking the contrast back to the 70's, the non-black colors don't pop as much as I thought they would.  That's not a bad thing mind you, but it does remind users to do a proper calibration if possible to make the picture shine.4)  Settings - speaking of calibration, i think the best thing you can do is get a professional cailbration.  But if you are like me & funds aren't always available, the next best thing is to go into the custom mode, back off the main contrast & color settings, turn off all automatic aids like motion smoother etc. & change the gamma to around 2.2-2.4.  LEAVE EVERYTHING ELSE at FACTORY - detailed color & pro settings.  I find this is as close to perfect plug & play - No fuss no muss as you can get.  Panny has made a really good out of the box eye pleasing picture.5)  Performance - so far - so great.  Picture are near life like though it is still dependent on your material you play.  The colors burst when there is natural sunlight in the scene.  Cable TV material is limited by the graininess of 1080i or 720p at best.  The SMARTTV options are full of the usual AMAZON, YOUTUBE, NETFLIX etc. offerings which besides the free stuff, I don't use.  The included remote is a bit clunky to navigate around these apps - so be forewarned if you are wholly dedicated to SMARTTV apps.  The speaker performance is mediocre at best but if you are in a small environment are passable.  I hook my ST60 up to an amp.6)  Issues:  You will read on the net that there are image retention or worse, burn-in problems with this panel.  While I don't discount those rare instances are real, having owned a previous Samsung plasma, I've learned that the best thing to minimize the chances of BI/IR out of the box is to break the TV in for first 200 hours using DNICE's solid color slides.In the next 100 hours after that: minimize long viewing on fixed picture content - in other words it's okay to flip channels! Watch content with varying screen fills (sidebar, top/bottom bars, full screen, etc.) And cut back on your picture settings.  Again - that means keep contrast below 80 & Panel brightness = low.There are plenty of places you can get setting advice on the net & posters in the below link can point you in the right direction: [...]But from my experience, to minimize or even eliminate BI/IR - the first 300 hours are critical & following the golden rules is proper risk management: [...]OVERALL:  I would endorse this purchase 100%.  For the money, there is no better picture out there for this price range.  Yes, out of the box, there is some hand holding & you can't use the set freely without worry.  Having said that, the reward for all the hard work in prepping the ST60 is a picture second to none in a home cinema screen that will provide years to quality viewing & videophiles acknowledging you as having good taste & intelligence.Hope this helps.UPDATES:ISSUE_Sep13 - The Panny VieraCast Amazon Prime Instant Video is not working.

My old Pioneer plasma finally checked out after 9 years of service. To replace it I originally went with a E series Vizio LED because CNET gave it a pretty decent review. However the Vizio color always looked funny mostly too flat and off angle viewing was reallly blue after 8 years of Pioneer beauty the Vizio was just not good enough so it went back to Costco and I ordered the ST60 from Amazon.The TV arrived as advertised, 2 guys brought it in, took the top box off of it and made sure it turned on. More of a CYA for Pilot as they were not about to do anything else to help set it up. That is ok though, it is better to see it on and not cracked before they headed off.Getting right to what matters, I took the CNET color suggestions right from their web-site [...]  with the only change being that I turned the panel brightness to high. I think my old eyes believe that this is a better setting and that was it. Color looks incredible on all of the inputs and when I say incredible I mean during the day, at night, sunny room etc, also side angle viewing is great which is important in my room.

I'm  an average customer who can be a little anal about a TV's picture quality and really don't give a damn about it's sound quality (I think a tv in this category should be hooked up with a quality surround sound system anyway). I don't do gaming, so I can't discuss that with any authority , and this is my first 3D TV. This 55\" is also replacing a 2010 Samsung 50\" Plasma that has been moved to my bedroom, so you can see I've been a plasma user for a few years. I do have a small 32\" Visio LED which is not bad either, but as others have mentioned here and in other AV forums, LCD/LED cannot come close to Plasmas in pure picture quality.Before I go into the details of my review, let me first say that my 4 star rating is based on mainly picture quality and the \"smart\" features of this tv, which I only considered about 15% weight in my rating. The rating has nothing to do with the delivery, Amazon's customer service (which is 99% of the time great for me, more on that later), or some half a$$ gripe about silver bezel, don't connect to my stereo system automatically, it didn't make my coffee sweet enough, etc. You've seen those reviews. This review is for real world people who are serious about making a decision to buy this tv or another model and need an honest opinion from an average customer who was in a similar position a month ago.Picture QualityBy far this is the most outstanding feature of this set. Just on the PQ I would've given it 4.5 stars. In my opinion, it's the best picture I've ever seen on a tv set. I'm sure there's better out there, but I don't think there are many more and certainly none in this price range. Even my teenage daughters, who don't usually care about pq remarked how good the picture looks. One of them even noted that they're seeing acne pimples on stars under their makeup which they didn't know that actress had acne lol. But there's a caveat. This outstanding pq came after using CNET's and D-Nice calibration settings, and on blu-ray or digital sources like movies from a hard drive, flash discs, Netflix, etc. I'm not sure if it's my satellite provider but Dish network channels doesn't give you as good a picture as these other sources, only their On Demand stuff gives you a close enough quality. I'm sure the more technical person can explain it but for those of us that watch alot of cable, I found that the tv has shown up the flaws in the Satellite (and I presume cable as well) signal. In the other HD digital sources I found that the ST60 was a huge improvement over my Samsung but with satellite, because the Samsung softens the picture so much, it hides the flaws of that signal and Dish actually looks a little better on that older tv. I've had to play with the settings for some of the more guilty channels but CNN and most of the premium movie channels look great with the calibrated settings.For those who watch alot of SD (standard definition) channels, you don't want to do that on your typical HDTV and this one is even worse than I've ever seen. Personally I think it should be a crime to watch SD on hdtvs but I know sometimes we can't help it (yes Dish, I'm looking at you with all those ESPN & Disney SD channels). But, yes, SD is horrible on this tv but watchable in a crunch. Just prepare for HD bliss when you switch to a HD source as the difference is that significant. Almost the same effect as watching black & white then switching to color.Smart FeaturesThese features weren't that important in my buying decision but now that I'm using them I'm a little impressed. I've been a Roku, Google & Apple TV user for awhile now and actually have my Visio Google Tv box connected to the ST60 to compare with the TV's \"Smart\" features. For the viewer with little previous experience with these features, it may seem a little intimidating at first but they're well worth learning and will save you a couple hundred dollars in getting separate equipment, like I did before getting this tv, if you need these features. The most outstanding of these features are the Netflix, Amazon Video and other apps you can run with a wired or wireless internet connection to the tv. You can also stream videos, view pictures or play music with a SD media device or USB device like a thumb drive or portable HD connected directly to the back of the set. The built in media player also plays stuff from external media servers like from your computer or network attached servers (drives) wirelessly. So yes, the geeks out there have lots to play with on this set. I still use my Visio Google TV for Netflix and Amazon as the pq on that box is better from those 2 sources but that is not a knock on that feature on the Panasonic as the quality is not bad from the tv but the Visio is known to provide one of the best Netflix pq on the market.3DAs I stated from the start, this is my first 3D experience and for my money, it's okay. It can be a little dark and I find to get the best effect you really have to be watching in very dark conditions. The 2 pair of glasses that come with the set is actually quite comfortable for my big head but my daughter's head is much smaller and she agrees that they're comfortable. We watched a couple 3d stuff and most were okay but some scenes in Life of Pi made us go \"Wow, did you see that\". I wasn't big on 3D before but this tv has made me take another look, although I suspect, as other reviewers have said, it could be better.SummaryTo summarize, I was hoping to be blown away with the picture quality when I first got the set out of the box and I wasn't until I put some 100 hours on the set and put in the calibration settings. 150 hours in I can now see I'm getting really close to that WOW effect and I'm not sure if my eyes are playing tricks on me, but I swear the pq gets better the more hours we use it. I'm someone on a budget but with what I've experienced so far i may get the tv professionally calibrated as I feel this tv, well tweaked & calibrated, will give me that ultimate picture I've been searching for and, is one of those one in 10 years buy and is definitely a keeper. At $1349 this set is a steal and just read those professional reviews, they also agree that this set rivals other $2k & up sets, just in the display quality alone.Now, a little nugget for those who made it through this long a$$ review showing that you're like me and want as much info as possible before making a buying decision. Amazon was courteous enough to refund me hundreds, yes, hundreds of dollars to me because an advertised feature on the set is actually erroneously placed on their site. And this is the kicker, after asking them to remove it, up to the writing of this review, it's still there. It was a feature I was looking forward to use but it's only restricted to use for the glasses that comes with the tv. Some of you might work out what it is by now but Amazon in their true commitment to always pleasing the customer gave me a significant discount so I wouldn't have to ship back the set. That's why I'm a dedicated Amazon customer. In my many years of being a Prime customer they've always made me, my family and friends feel like valuable customers.Another little nugget, I think if you buy this tv up to mid July, Panasonic is giving you a free electronic pen you can use to write or annotate images directly on the tv screen. Yeah, it's kinda gimmicky but for someone who can find good use for such a feature, I think it's normally sold for $70 and it's free with this tv purchase for now. It's a Panasonic mail in offer, for those that are wondering how to get it.Hope this review will be of some use to someone but I thought this set deserve this kind of detail to help those of you who are still on the fence. But my opinion I don't think there's no better value, even if you don't get the discount I got. That was just a nice unexpected cherry on top of the deal.Update October 1, 2013This set still continues to amaze me. The picture quality has actually gotten better with more usage and some extra tweaks that this set allows you to do and have lots of settings you can use to adjust this tv. It does run a little hot at times and I've noticed a small uptick in my energy bill but that could be due to this extra plasma and the increased viewing hours because we're enjoying this set so much.

Research CNET and D-Nice calibration settings on the internet for an absolute beautiful picture setting. I use D-Nice's dim room settings and his calibration is outstanding for night viewing of any media(BLU RAY, DVD) or cable stations. Everyone has been complaining about poor 3D performance has either not received the recent firmware update from Panasonic or haven't adjusted 3d 60 MHz rate to 96 MHz which improves the 3d performance tremendously. I have noticed some glare issues in my living room but I have my TV on a articulating wall arm so I can pivot or tilt the screen to eliminate most of it. The sounds isn't as bad as I've been reading and actually this is the first tv I've owed with a dedicated subwoofer in the television itself. With few adjustments to the cinema surround sound on the TV I was overall pleased with its performance. I own a Harmon Kardan receiver with Martin Logan front Motion 10 speakers along with Polk center,Polk rear surrounds, and Polk 12 inch subwoofer so the tv speakers will not get much usage anyways. Also to all new plasma owners I would recommend running D-Nice's break in slides to age the phosphors evenly for at least 100 to 200 hours before getting a professional calibration done. High definition cable stations along with BLU Ray 1080p movies are the best pictures I've ever seen on a tv to date. I've read on many calibration reviews that this TV's grey scale and colors have been calibrated to .5% away from a perfect studio monitor, meaning the monitors that the directors and producers use to calibrate movies before they go into mass production. That is absolutely amazing for this tv at around $1,000.00 store price. For anyone stating that plasma television are a dying breed I beg to differ as only the newly released OLED television can compete with them for 4 times the price or more! Overall this television is the best purchase I have made in the electronics department in the 20 years i've been shopping for audio and video phile quality products and hopefully it lives a long long life in my living room...

Using Cnets picture settings I was shocked at how much better the picture was than on my old Samsung LED.  I also had low expectations for the 3d but I watched IMAX Under the Sea in 3d and it was better than expected.I went with CNETs recommendation to get this set despite some unsettling discussion of the higher than average input lag.  I needed to see for myself.  I wish I could say otherwise but the input lag is quite noticable.  I tried Super Mario U (with \"game mode\" on) and there was a noticable delay between the sound coming out of the Wii U game pad and the TV.  There was also a noticible delay playing other side scrolling games like Runner 2 and playing COD Blackops II online.This is a perfect TV for anyone looking for incredible picture at an amazing price and is not affected by input lag in gaming.  As for me I am going to exchange this TV for the TC-65PS64 which is a club model sold by Costco and Sam's Club.  It is basically the same as the S60 series but with an Anti-Reflective filter similar to the ST series.  The S60 series has tested the lowest for input lag out of all new 2013 Panasonic plasmas (followed by the ZT and VT series).For more information on input lag check out the recent CNET article:http://reviews.cnet.com/8301-33199_7-57587317-221/game-mode-on-cnet-tests-tvs-for-input-lag/Good luck!", "Date": "May 9, 2013"}, {"Title": "Great TV- still has IR issues so keep that in mind", "Author": "Amazon Customer", "ReviewID": "RY62ENWIYCRWS", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I set up this new TV 3 days ago and I am extremely pleased so far. I am coming from a Sony 60A3000 LCOS RPTV which had a great picture, nice black level and was extremely bright. With that in mind, I wasn't sure what to expect as this would be my first plasma.I keep this TV in a bright room of 12 windows with a large bay window right behind the couch. In the past I tended to avoid using the Sony during the day as it was extremely difficult to see. I am happy to say that this Panasonic does not restrict my daytime viewing in the same manner and I am able to watch it with no issue. The ST60 series has a louvered front panel which blocks overhead lighting and reduces glare. I see \"reflections\" but no longer see bright glare spots on the screen.Colorwise, this unit is great! Deep inky blacks and very respectable white level. Some may find this TV a bit darker than what they are used to if coming from an LCD. I would recommend playing with the settings and give yourself a day or two to adjust and see what you think then.As far as gaming goes, I have tried a PS3 and an HTPC with no input issues. I had read reports of delay with this set but I did not experience any noticable input lag. I have NOT enabled Game mode so I do still have that option should I run into any lag in the future.What a great TV!Edit: After 3 weeks and over 250 hours on the TV, I had to return it (and absolutely hated doing so!). The picture quality is superb, if a little dark on some content, but the image retention was something I could not live with.Reviewers will tell you that plasma IR is a thing of the past and not to worry about it but I found that to be completely false. You may get lucky and find that 1 set that shrugs IR off but I was not so fortunate. If you want to use the built-in smart features, a game console, or a HTPC..be prepared to deal with the IR or to run screen wipe or some other tool on a consistant basis to remove it.Final word: If movies are all you watch then I can't think of a better TV for the job.", "Date": "April 29, 2013"}, {"Title": "beautiful picture!", "Author": "C.

All three are excellent and I have no problem with any of them. I recently decided to move my beautiful 46\" Samsung TV from my family room into a bedroom and to replace it with a larger set. The most important attribute that I was seeking in the new set was the BEST POSSIBLE PICTURE! All other considerations were very secondary.After considerable research in person and on-line, I eventually concluded that I agreed with the ratings in the March, 2013 issue of Consumer Reports Magazine. This 55\" Panasonic TC-P55ST60 met my criterion for \"best possible picture\" and at $1,300 it was also selected as their BEST BUY.At the onset of my research I never seriously considered buying a TV with a Plasma display. (Ugh) I was under the impression that the current state-of-the-art was the local edge-dimming LED back-lighted LCD display. I eventually came to the realization that there were considerable technical drawbacks to that system as it is presently constituted.It is interesting that in reviewing 60\" and larger TVs, all 5 of the sets CU rated as having the best quality picture were Plasma sets and 9 of the 11 TVs that were awarded a check mark have Plasma displays. ....Food for thought!This Panasonic TC-P55ST60 exceeds my most optimistic expectations. The blacks are simply unbelievable!The on-screen audio-video set-up tutorial walked me through the step-by-step procedure and in 10 minutes I was being dazzled by the superb picture...and surprisingly good sound....I may not even bother buying a sound bar for it.There's nothing not to like about this set.

I was thinking that maybe it wasn't going to be quite as good as what I wanted, but was I ever wrong. A number of years ago I bought a Pioneer Kuro, which I still have, but I was surprised to discover that the black levels on this tv actually appear to be close to my Kuro, and under certain lighting conditions the blacks even appear darker.  I never would have believed it if I hadn't taken this home and seen it for myself. Not only that but this tv is a smart tv, and it has 3D, at a third of the of the price I paid for my Kuro many years ago.Earlier this year I tried a plasma Samsung 6500 model which was very good but the black levels weren't up to what I was hoping for. I also tried a number of LED/LCD tvs, including the Sony KDL R550A model which I really liked except for that fact that it had a very glossy screen, which meant that I had to turn the lights way down in a room in order to minimize the reflections, but in doing so it also became obvious that it didn't have great blacks in a dark room. However the Panasonic ST60 does have great black levels in a dim room and it also has a filter which minimizes bright objects reflecting back from the screen. In a dimly lit room I'm able to watch a movie like \"Cabin in the Woods\" without seeing my reflection in the dark shadows as opposed to what happens with the glossy LED TVs, or plasmas without anti-glare.Initially when I bought this TV I thought that the 3D was only so so, but after I tweaked a few things the 3D seems to be as natural as I have seen. The full HD (1080p) of the active 3D on the ST60 is amazingly clear compared to passive 3D(720p). Putting the Motion Smoother to \"low\" while in 3D also seemed to help with some choppiness I found with fast action scenes. One should also make sure their software is up to date on their TV as recent updates by Panasonic might help with any problems. To minimize ghosting one should also keep the refresh rate to 96Hz (as opposed to 100 or 120Hz). I still have noticed some rare instances of ghosting, but because it always appears in the same place of the film I'm assuming that it's the result of the way the 3D is encoded on the disc rather than having anything to do with the TV itself. Some lights, like fluorescent, should be turned off, since they tend to create a strobe effect when watching the 3D. The active 3D glasses do require batteries unless one buys some rechargeable glasses. All in all the 3D is very good. One can get a sense of how effective the 3D is by watching 3D movies like \"The Great Gatsby\",\"Dredd\", \"The Avengers\", or \"Prometheus\".The Panasonic VT60 has a slightly higher contrast ratio (6,000,000 to 1, compared to 5,500,000 to 1 for the ST60) though I have nothing to complain about with the ST60 black levels given their comparison to my 50\" Pioneer Kuro. I discovered that in a room that is lit from above (ie. standing or overhead lamp close to the TV) the ST60 actually outperforms my Pioneer with amazingly deep blacks because of its angled filters which cut out light from above. The VT60's black levels do appear slightly darker in brightly lit rooms than the ST60 because of its darker filter. This tv is also relatively light at only 56 lbs which is one reason I bought this tv over the VT60. The VT60, which only comes in 55\" or larger, starts at 85 lbs. This tv also has a multitude of settings from which to adjust if one wants to refine the image to their taste. This TV has Vivid, Home Theater, Movie, and Custom settings. The ST60 also has a light sensor and adjusted itself to the ambient light in the room. Since the ST60 is a plasma TV it also has excellent image uniformity and off angle viewing compared to LED/LCD TVs which lose colour and contrast the more off angle one views the screen. The ST60 also has a high refresh rate compared to a LED/LCD tv which minimizes blur when watching sports or fast action scenes. Panasonic announced on November 15th that 2013 is the last year that they are going to make plasma tvs so if someone wants an excellent tv this might be the time to buy one.For those new to plasma tvs it is useful to age the tv over its first 100-150 hours of viewing in order to minimize things like burn-in. It is therefore best to watch tv with a full screen image. If one is watching widescreen movies with bars on the top and bottom then one should use the zoom mode in order to fill the screen. Also avoid watching anything with fixed images on the screen for prolonged periods of time during this aging period, this includes using the menu screen for too long as these fixed menus will burn into the tv screen. Probably the best way to break this tv in is to just watch tv and use the initial settings in the beginning.As far as calibration is concerned I have found that the settings on CNET for the ST60 work very well, and I have used them on the Custom and the Cinema mode with slightly differing effect. For my personal preference I have adjusted the Brightness anywhere from between -3 to -9 depending on the movie, Colour to 41, Sharpness to 15, and under W/B detail adjustments I set the W/B high R to -4, and under Pro settings I've set Black Extension to -2.", "Date": "November 28, 2013"}, {"Title": "THE BEST 60 inch TV under 2200.", "Author": "Daemeon", "ReviewID": "R289RR8NQMSWHO", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "between between this model, an LG, a Vizip, and a Sony.

Netflix runs smooth, and netflix picture quality is fantastic. I am sure that netflix picture quality depends on your internet speed, so results vary i guess. CNET has a great article about how to properly calibrate this T.V, which can be found here: http://forums.cnet.com/7723-19410_102-590736/panasonic-tc-p55st60-picture-settings/I found some small annoyances at first, the Home screen that comes on every time you turn the T.V on was brutal, but I quickly found that you can turn it off by selecting \"full screen\" from the settings menu. The other minor gripe I have is that when you turn the T.V on, a red LED power light comes on, right on the front panel, which is a little distracting when you're watching T.V. Other than that, the T.V is great. I have read multiple articles about horrible input lag on this T.V, so If you game, that should give you cause for pause on this T.V.

So far, I LOVE my tv.  The picture is phenomenal; I already loved watching tv, but now that I've got this and my HD cable box, I could just stare at the tv screen all day.  And I read so many reviews about flat panels having terrible sound, but I think this has wonderful sound.  I don't have any audio equipment and usually have the volume at like 10 when watching cable.  If I watch a DVD, I have to turn it up to 25-30, but I think it sounds great, not tinny at all.I haven't bought my Blu-Ray yet, but I think DVDs look great on here.  I haven't tried the 3D yet, but I'm happy the tv came with 2 pairs of glasses.  Not really into all the apps - what's the point, you have to pay for most of them?  The only ones I've used so far are You Tube and Amazon Instant videos.  It is easy to navigate through all the menus on the settings and apps screens.The only thing I am a little concerned about are the component video connections.  As I said, I still only have a regular old DVD player right now and it is hooked up with component cables.  Last week, when I popped in a DVD, the picture was black and white.  I pulled the plugs out of the player and put back in, no change.  I pulled them out of the tv, put back in and the picture was fine.  Ever since then, whenever I watch a DVD, I have to pull the cables from the tv and plug back in to fix the picture.

So I went to BB and got the the very last 60\" ST60 on display.  I have enjoyed my Pioneer Kuro for 8 wonderful years and never had a single problem with it until last week.  It's hard to believe that a 2008 model is so much better than current options we have to choose from. Why is this?  IMHO, we have all asked for a great quality HDTV flat panel that is the least expensive, cheapest, bang for the buck and China, along with the big Manufacturers have exactly what the consumer wanted.... Except for the Great Quality HDTV!  Panasonic & Samsung have made some some damn nice Plasmas over the years,  but again, IMHO,  look at the absolutely stunning picture the PIONEER KURO & non KURO ELITE SETS put out.  Not to mention 2 tuners or tuner in tuner, and audio out connections for external speakers and a subwoofer!  Pioneer exited the market due to cost of manufacturing vs. what they had to sell a set for. I've seen a number of HDTV's from 2006-2009 that still have better picture quality than many current sets.  Manufacturers have stripped out all the quality options & features and provided us with sub $1000.00 sets all over the place, but most with Sub Standard picture quality.  I wonder how many of us would be willing to buy a 60\" Pioneer KURO ELITE - Brand New - Today - for say $3500 to $3900.00 if it had exactly what the previous Pioneers had in quality?  Yes they were expensive, but the quality was simply outstanding.  I had over 39,000 hours on my Pioneer before it had its first problem.  So I bought one of the last Panasonic ST-60's and it does have an excellent picture. And yes, no doubt OLED will be coming with its superior picture quality  and will be the standard in 5-8 years, but it too will be fairly expensive for quite awhile.  If you can find a Panasonic ST, VT, or ZT at Amazon or where ever, I would highly recommend you buy one.  I just wanted to post a philosophical review on the HDTV market as a whole. I'd be interested to hear the thoughts of others on this observation & review.  In the meantime,  I bid farewell to Panasonic and the Plasma market as they made many a nice HDTV.

That was all that was left, and it was the display model!  First off, these TVs never look good on the dealer wall under bright lights alongside all the LEDs.  There was a 65 inch Panasonic ZT in a dark demo room that gave a truer impression of what these TVs are capable of.  Also, I've  read many reviews here saying the Panasonic TVs are just dimmer, some claiming it's a major failing, but there is a basic setting that needs to changed out of the box.  'CATS' or 'contrast automatic tracking system' is on by default, and it tries to adjust the brightness to the ambient room light.  In practice, this means you will never get a bright picture in a dim or dark room.  Also, as the light in the room changes during the day, the brightness will fluctuate.  When I turned this off, there was an immediate and dramatic difference.  I think many who complain about the brightness of these sets probably have them in a dim room and have not turned this off.  That is the single setting that makes the biggest difference.  In my dim room, the TV is now plenty bright.  I've considered lowering the brightness!I found some calibration settings online, those of Cnet and D-nice.  Luckily, one has you customize using the CUSTOM profile, the other using the CINEMA profile, so I could try both.  I think I preferred Cnet's, but both are a big improvement over the standard defaults.  You will get a much better and more satisfying picture if you apply either of these settings.One minor thing was driving me crazy---the gray side  bars.  I have a lot of older movies, etc, in 4:3 mode.  I found out how to change these from gray to black, and I was much happier!  Since I have a demo model with many hours on it already, I don't think I need to worry about image retention or burn in.  Consumer Reports says that isn't really much of a problem any longer with these newer Panasonic plasma sets.I've tried the 3-d.  It works, is pretty good, but somehow seemed more fatiguing than in a big theater.  It also  just doesn't  have the same impact in the smaller medium.  Finally, the 3d picture is way dimmer through the glasses.  The active glasses are kind of a pain too.  Discovered if you turn the TV off before you turn off the glasses, you may have to remove the batter from the glasses to get them to power down--and that is a real pain!  Found details on this on the Internet, including a youtube video on battery removal.  However, I think the 3d is more of a gimmick than an essential feature.The set really shines with a good blu-ray disk.  It's pretty fabulous.  The blacks are incredible.  I was watching a blu-ray of Farscape and the hero's black leather outfit and the evil Scorpius's shiny black suit were amazing!  Broadcast TV, however, seems a little disappointing.  I do think the set takes some getting used to.  It's simply different from LED technology.  I think it is better in the end, but it takes some getting used to.  I only wish I could have got a 55-inch, but a 50-inch for $900 was almost half what a VT, ZT or Samsung plasma would have cost, and it is truly a premium picture.  I'm a little on the fence at this point between 4 and 5 stars, since I've only had the TV for a couple weeks.

I have a home NAS (Synology DS211j) which holds all my media (videos, music, photos) and didn't know what to expect in regards to playback ability from the ST60. I'm happy to report that it can handle a good variety of files and formats. The most demanding video files I have come from a Panasonic HDC-TM700 camcorder: 28mbps 1080p 60fps AVC/H.264 and 5.1 audio as m2ts files. These files playback flawlessly with no slowdown, much to my surprise. It may have something to do with them both being Panasonic products. From here, I expected MP4 files to easily play and they did. Most of my video files are MP4 but I also tried MKV which played fine. If the majority of your video is encoded with H.264 you should have no problems with playback. Panasonic put a nice audio feature during photo playback. You can choose between 5 preset tracks containing the expected wedding/tropical vacation theme music among others. I believe you can even use a custom song. Details like this make the experience that much better (wife loved it).Apps work great. If you have Amazon Prime the instant video app is free and works great. Netflix, Pandora and a few other popular ones are also available. The weather app comes in handy and I actually prefer it over going to the weather channel. Note that when downloading other apps, you're asked to make a Panasonic account which requires email address, password and a PIN. Entering this in on the remote is pain, be patient, only needed once.So far the ST60 has completely replaced my HTPC much to my surprise (and delight).

I had some concerns about making the plasma transition.  You read about break-in, being dim, running hot, burn-in, input lag, etc.  I am very particular about image quality, so that was the basis for my decision.  After one month here are my thoughts.  Previous TV was a pretty nice 47\" Sony mid-range, 3 yr. old, LCD.I first ran the TV on the D-Nice break-in slides and full screen watching for \u00b1 150 hours.  Now after watching two letterbox movies, I put the grey screen up and inspected very carefully... no residue of any kind.  So much for the burn-in unless you leave the same logo on for hours at a time.Picture adjustment...  After the 150 hours, I input the D-Nice (AVS-Forum) calibration.  Looks good, although now in B & W, darker greys looked a little green, which I tuned up in WB.  I run the colors more to the natural side so skin tones look pleasing.. low 40's to ~50.  depends on the source.  Blacks are fantastic after the rather dark blue/ greys of my Sony.  The blacks look light night!  Viewing condition are moderate lighting.. too dark in the room hurts my eyes.Input lag / motion blurr...  on HD TV and BluRay have not sen anything.  I do not game so can't comment!Heat... in 70\u00b0F room after several hours of the slides the screen averages about upper 80's to low 90's at a few points, measured with IR thermometer.  Warm but not hot!3D...  I use a different calibration... motion smoothing, higher contrast for more brightness, darker viewing conditions.  Just watched Great Gatsby this weekend.. fantastic.  No judder or vibration.. very sharp, good brightness, very realistic, like actually being there.  Much better than passive 3D at the theater for Gravity!Source selection...  I mostly like films, and the HD selection that I have here is quite varied.  Some looks good, other less so.  Live HD sports, like NFL looks great, very sharp very detailed.  New Sony 5100 Bluray player delivers very high quality image.  Up scaled DVDs look... OK.. but not that great.  Compression artifacts really stickout... so SD is not a viable option if you are particular!Smart features...  signs on my home network and performs fine.  As I live in Mexico, a lot of content like Hulu is blocked.  But I watch Netflix and picture quality is quite better than streaming through my PC.  Even though PC is connected via HDMI.Remote...  works OK, as expected, but using the cursor to type is really a pain.  Get a wireless / USB keyboard, I have an inexpensive Logitech, that I bough here at Amazon.  Works perfect, much easier for any input requiring text.  Also function keys work things like the AV volume, arrow keys are easy for menu use.  Is a big help and very low cost.  This is not a Panasonic knock, but as a computer these smart TVs are weak.  I am sure is only a matter of time until this area becomes more robust!

Amazon shipped the TV through CEVA. I searched for information about CEVA shipping TVs purchased through Amazon, and found almost all negative things said about CEVA. This made me really nervous, and prepared for a horrible experience.When I ordered the TV, I was able to set an appointment day and time on Amazon. Once the TV shipped, the tracking information stated that the shipping company had contacted me to set up delivery on December 4. But it was only December 1 or 2, so obviously the shipping company didn't contact me from the future. This is why I searched for information about CEVA in the first place.Anyway, my delivery day came. I had not been contacted by anyone from CEVA, so I was still prepared for some problem to come up. I was given (I actually selected) a 3 hour window for delivery when I made the purchase, from 11am to 2pm. When it was almost 2, I was thinking the TV would not come on time. Then a truck pulled up to my house at around 1:55pm. There were 2 delivery men.They asked me where I wanted the TV. They carried the TV upstairs to the bedroom. I turned the overhead fan on for them. They made sure that the area was prepared for the TV( cable box on and hdmi cable, etc ready to be plugged in).They quickly unpackaged the TV. While one guy set up the pedestal stand, the other took out the manuals and remote and 3D glasses. They secured the TV to the pedestal, and together lifted the TV onto my dresser(which is pretty tall). They hooked up the cables, and showed me that the TV was working. They recommended I keep the box for at least 30 days, which I planned to do anyway. I imagine they would have taken it with them had I wanted them to. One guy had me sign a delivery receipt, and check off that there was no damage on a checklist. I offered them something to drink, they thankfully declined, and they left. The entire delivery took about 15 minutes.It may be possible they could have stayed longer to do more, but I do not know what else they could have done.

We did not hook the TV up to our cable box or Blu-Ray player, as it was our intention to run break-in slides for the first 100 hours.  The Menu was very easy to follow and the initial set up was completed without complication.  We connected the TV to our wireless network and intended to connect to Netflix, just to see how it worked.  However, by the time we were connected, and had started to the Avengers (just to see how the picture looked), our kids had already invaded and there was no stopping the movie.  I have to say, the picture right out of the box was awesome.  We did experience the soap opera effect initially, which went away as soon as we turned off the motion smoothing option. This is our first ever HDTV.  We are coming from a nice 27\" Toshiba tube TV which we have had for 13 years.  Although we have seen these units in the store, we just couldn't believe how awesome the picture was.  After the movie was over, we started the break in slides, which will run for the next 100 hours.  After that, we plan on using D-Nice's calibration settings, and we anticipate a completely changed home theater experience.  My kids even told us that we wouldn't need to go to the theater anymore!!  (Yeah!! No more 8 dollar popcorn!!)Clearly we are not videophiles, and so you have to read our review on that basis.  All in all, we are completely satisfied so far.  Amazon was great.

However I can comment on the delivery and replacement process.  This set qualifies for free enhanced delivery which includes unpacking and setup.  The carrier (CEVA) brought the set inside and, upon unpacking, we discovered a badly shattered screen.  There was no damage to the carton whatsoever.  The carrier immediately processed paperwork indicating the damage and refused delivery.  The set was repackaged by the carrier and returned to the truck.  I was instructed to call Amazon customer service at the number provided and was quickly connected to a representative who immediately processed an order for a replacement set to be delivered the following week.  While disappointed, I am impressed with how courteous and quickly both the carrier and Amazon handled the damaged set.  Hopefully the second time will be a charm and I'll amend this review to reflect the performance of the replacement set.  In the meantime I hope this review will help quiet any concerns over how Amazon handles damaged goods.UPDATE:  A new set was delivered one week later and arrived in excellent condition.  Unpacking and setup went smoothly and the delivery guys from Pilot were very cooperative and helpful.  They even removed an existing 60 inch Sony projection TV and placed the new one in it's place.  Initial setup took me quite a while (Hint:  READ the instruction and setup manual first).  I just wanted to watch TV without all the \"smart\" stuff getting in the way.  Once I figured it out, things worked very well.  The picture was very \"ordinary\" right out of the box.  I'm used to HD with my old set so this was mildly surprising.  However, once I calibrated the picture (Thanks to Mechanical Man for your calibration data in this review section) the picture really came to life and is far superior to my old set.  I'll recalibrate later when the set has had a chance to age a little (it's less than 24 hours old at this writing).  The picture is stunning as reported in other reviews and I'm very pleased with the purchase.  I knew Panasonic was getting out of the plasma market but have been assured that support for this set will be around for years to come so I'm not concerned.An interesting side note on the 3D:  I get a brief message on the screen when a 3D broadcast signal is detected and am invited to switch to 3D (just a push of a button on the remote) but haven't used the 3D glasses yet so don't know how well 3D works.I have not let the TV connect to the internet yet but may do so later so, at this point, I can't comment on the \"smart\" features.So far, a great set at a good price.

Not a huge deal though.The bottom line is - if you care more about your picture quality and if you have a properly lit room you will surely enjoy this TV.

You can read all the other reviews to find out why. I had a Panasonic 50\" 720p plasma monitor (no built-in tv tuner) for the last 7 or so years and it's still going strong so I knew I probably wanted another Panasonic and another plasma for the deep blacks and fast refresh times.After a lot of researching online and trips to Best Buy to look at different sets I decided I wanted this tv (the 60\"). But because the estimated shipping time was 1-2 months I held off buying it.Now I must admit I didn't read ALL of the reviews/comments for this TV, but I saw a lot of comments on reviews asking how long it took to get their TVs -- but no one replying -- so I though I'd share my experience.- I ordered the set on July 21, 2013 when the shipping time went from 1-2 months down to 3-5 weeks. Amazon estimated it would be delivered between 8/15 and 8/30- 8/1 I received an email from Amazon saying that my order would ship sooner than expected (between 8/9 and 8/15) Sweet!- 8/8 Order status changed from \"Not yet shipped\" to \"Shipping Soon\"- 8/9 Status changes to \"Shipped.\" Estimated arrival 8/14 - 8/15- 8/10 Received email from a shipping carrier saying that the TV has arrived in Phoenix (100 miles from my town) and they will contact me soon to arrange delivery.- 8/13 Carrier calls and schedules delivery- 8/14 TV is delivered.So far it's great. I've only had it on for a few days. Some people complain about a buzzing sound. Mine has a buzzing sound but I can only hear it if the sound is off and my ear is right up next to the set on the right side. It doesn't bother me at all (my last plasma had two fans running all the time to keep the tv cool).I only play Madden on the Xbox, so I don't really notice any input lag that some people talk about. Honestly, I'll really only use this to watch a hour or two of tv and night and some football and Xbox on the weekends.If this set is anything like my last one, I'll have it for quite some time.Will keep you posted if anything weird starts happening.

The picture is superb, the blacks are inky and uniform, there's no lag or jutter on even the fastest-moving scenes, and it connects you to the internet. All in all, this set is as good as advertised.I did a lot of research before finally settling on this one. I was mostly concerned with the problem of screen glare and plasma sets, as I'd had a 40\" Philips plasma for about 6 years and it had a significant issue with glare. Our living room is fairly bright, with a small window high on one wall, and another wall made up mostly of glass door panels. Light from a row of kitchen windows adjacent to the living room also comes in unabated during the day, so it's a really bright room.But the Panny put all those fears to rest with its glare-reducing glass and brightness detection technology. Glare is not an issue, even when viewing during high sun. I would encourage anyone with the same doubts I had to put those aside if that's the deciding factor between this set or an LCD, as no LCD picture could ever match the deep blacks and exact tones of the ST60 series.The only reason I could see choosing an LCD over this plasma would be a setup where direct sunlight hit the screen head-on, and that's not a good situation no matter what TV you have.There are more expensive sets out there. Panny's VT series beat the ST's picture, but that extra quality will cost you at least another $1,000 or more. The Panny ZT is plasma heaven, but at double the ST's price. The Samsung F8500 is also a great set, but it's also an extra grand out of your wallet.For the combination of price and quality, there's nothing that can touch the ST60. I've had mine for about 3 months now, and I can say that it is easily the best money I've ever spent in the 30-odd years I've been buying consumer electronics (I actually got a massive discount because Best Buy screwed up my order, but that's a whole other story, and I'd still be completely satisfied had I paid full price!)If you're in the market for something beyond a budget-priced flat-screen but don't want to blow out your credit card, this is the set for you.", "Date": "August 3, 2013"}, {"Title": "Amazing picture!

This television is even better than anticipated. Though we just received the television a week ago, we could not be more pleased, thus far.I did a lot of research on LED and Plasma televisions, prior to our purchase of the ST60 TV. The reviews of this set seemed to outweigh all other considerations. It seemed like the way to go, but we hesistated a bit due to windows in our room. My only concern was we do have double windows on a side wall and a door with a window of our viewing room. After consulting with a few others, we decided to purchase in hopes that the windows would not be a big issue. It turns out that the light in our room does not cause the set to be any less appealing. FYI, we did have some light issues until we turned the CATS feature off, as the screen would darken too much. While we are not into all the extras this television offers (great for some, I know), we did want a set with a superior picture quality and it does not disappoint. This set is currently hooked up to a non HD cable box and the picture out of the box even looks good. We are waiting for the HD box to be delivered and can't wait to see the difference. I am not sure how it could be better.I own a 32\" Panasonic LED that was purchased for a bedroom in Dec.

The picture on this is very good with some issues but at this price it is still a steal and I think better than an LED. There are some mild reflections off the glass surface. They are not horrible as they are muted some but are visible.The 2 D to 3 D conversion is what I would call barely 3D but does have an adjustment feature available. True 3 D signals are decent 3D. Be sure you check that out at the store. I have had trouble finding 3 D on Direct TV as channel 103 has not had anything on this weekend and ESPN seems to not be 3 D all the time. The 3 D is also adjustable, is comfortable, but there is some motion artifact and of course the screen dims a bit. Even though there I have not found much on air 3D content ( I did watch ESPN for awhile) there is 2 D to 3 D conversion on  3 D TV's now so you can convert anything in 3 D if you want and I found that more appealing than I expected. I can see the benefit of 3D for movies and I think now rather than an extra feature it is actually better than that and is a feature I would like to use.  The 3 D glasses provided are light and comfortable but run off of watch batteries and were not rechargeable. I have recently seen the new Panasonic ZT series which is slightly more than twice the price but has visibly deeper richer color and no reflections. The superlatives given to the ST series in the ratings which are justified, pale in comparison to the stunning quality of the picture in the ZT series. Every now and then a company puts out a product that is engineered to be in a league of its own. The ZT series is one of these. I have had over the years some of these that stood the test of time of being unique like a Sherwood Dynaquad receiver, the Proscan original hi def tube TV's,  JVC VCR machines, Onkyo Surround sounds AV receivers etc. Since Panasonic is likely discontinuing plasmas soon I am likely going to upgrade to the best while it is still available. The only competition for this  ST series TV is other more expensive Panasonics and perhaps 4 K TV's at greater than 4 x the price. And those still wont have the range and depth of plasmas.

It may bother some of you if you do not have a sound system like me, so try turning the surround sound off if it does. I did that, and it does not bother me anymore.-The input lag could be an issue for some gamers, so in the Advanced Settings, turn Game Mode on and it will reduce the lag. There's still a bit of a lag, but I've gotten used to it after that change. I am not a hardcore gamer though, so you may way to consider another TV if a slight lag will really bother you. You can change the display settings per input source as well, so if you have multiple game consoles, you can turn Game Mode on or off for all of them.-3D was not something I really cared about and I had low expectations coming into this after reading user and expert reviews. I can say that I am not overly impressed with it but I can also say I am not disappointed by it. Do not expect an amazing 3D experience from this TV.

We bought the 55\" Viera from Amazon.Setting it up was simple...screw in the base and it's ready. We have ATT Unverse. Forget about connecting the coax cable from the Uverse box...use the $100 HDMI instead...it's night and day way better.Our house has no back windows or down lights, but some people with back windows might have a reflection problem. But this Viera has a lot less reflection glare than say a LG or Samsung which my friend has.Here's the best part. I bought a dozen 3D movies to see the 3D effect.  It's absolutely stunning with a Panasonic 3D DVD player.But wait...we found out the Viera has a built in 3D convertor. So while you're watching ANY show...football, movies or whatever, just click on the 3D button on the remote...put on your 3D glasses...and everything...I mean everything...is converted into 3D.  You can tweak up the 3D depth settings via the Menu, but we prefer the Mid setting. The 3D effect is awesome. And everything is razor sharp in focus and clear.Even without the 3D everything looks so spectacular...unbelievable details, true colors, even the sound is great.After seeing friends' LED TVs, and some costing as much as the Panasonic, there is no comparison. The Panasonic Viera is the clear winner.  Buy it, and your wife will love you....you might need another for your man cave.I have never seen such a brilliant TV as this Panasonic Plasma.

Just want to clear up on other people's complaints.", "Author": "Corey Allen", "ReviewID": "R229E9VHKH1QTB", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "First of all, I just want to say that I've had the 60\" ST60 for about a month and the picture quality is excellent. There are plenty of reviews raving about the TV's excellent quality so I will skip over that entirely. This is my first plasma and I was nervous at first due to many of the complaints from reading on several different forums of things such as image retention, dither, sound sync, etc. So i wanted to touch on those issues to give the next people round an idea.1. Image Retention: There are many complaints of people still experiencing image retention with this TV. The most i have seen is a brief IR of \"Recently Watched\" from watching Netflix but was gone within minutes if not seconds. Besides this I have seen nothing to suggest any serious Image Retention issues. I have been doing my best to age the screen evenly for the first several hundred hours and had no issues thus far. My suggestion, within these first couple hundred hours is to use the little Aspect Ratio button at the top right of the remote to get rid of any black bars on the top or bottom of the screen as well as to move any static images off the side of the screen. Also just avoid static images as much as possible for the first month or so. From my reading, I've heard many people leave there TV's running with slides for several hundred hours right off the bat while the screen plays specific slides. I can't imagine leaving the TV on that long for one time period is very good for the TV but to each his own.2. Sound Sync: Some complaints were made about the sound not being synced with the video. I currently use an optical cable running out of the TV to a surround sound system in which all of the audio runs through. When I first used the TV I noticed the audio sync was pretty off. After a couple system updates I believe the problem was fixed. Either way, it's not bad enough for me to notice anymore.3.  Dithering: Other complaints I've heard were about extreme dither. The fact is all plasma's dither but typically can't be seen from a distance. Standing within 3 feet of the TV you can see the little colored dots bouncing around, but from normal viewing distance its unnoticable.4. Buzzing Noise: I have not heard anything of a buzz while the TV is on or off. I live in the city in an apartment building, but its pretty quiet in my place and I can't hear anything coming from the TV.5. Sound quality: Can't say I've ever used the built in speakers, but official reviews have suggested sound quality is sub par. There is no option to turn these speakers off either, so get another sound system, hook it up, and turn the volume down all the way on the TV.6. Lines through screen/components failing: I've heard of some people's boards failing, or lines going across the screen. If you're that concerned about the TV failing and dont trust Panasonic customer service, get an extended warranty. I purchased one through best buy for an additional 5 years. Protect your investment.Hope this helped a little with those who were concerned about the complaints from others. Remember, there will always be manufacturer faults in one out a million products a factory makes. Best thing to do is buy from a well known source such as best buy, amazon, etc. with a good return policy.

I used D'Nice calibration settings, and wow picture is bright and amazing. Colors are great. It is as bright as any LCD. In my living room with controlled light it is too bright sometimes! Since I control the lighting I have no reflections from the TV. The TV works just as well during the day with the blinds open. Not sure if this makes a difference but my TV was manufactured October 2013 with the new FW already on it.I was worried about image retention with the life bars and various HUD in my games. So far no IR at all. I do put contrast down to 40 ( since the tv is new). I was also worried about the input lag. ( since fighters require fast reflexes, but not as fast as some FPS) I have not noticed much input lag if any. I had some friends over to play and they did not notice any input lag at all. My friend owns a Samsung LCD. The 3d is good. I enjoyed Imax Under The Sea 3d.( I still need to try a couple more movies.) Netflix works very well with WiFi, but better with Ethernet cables. Has ads which you can turn off. It does have a nice feature, that once you make a custom setting you can copy it to all inputs.

It's got some of the deepest blacks you'll find, accurate colors, and impressive video processing.  It has a good smart-tv package if you need itBut if you have any interest in playing video games on it, unless your tolerance for such things is extremely high, you'll be bothered by the well-documented input lag.I had first purchased the TC-P60S60 and was impressed with everything except the excessive plasma buzz (may have been a lemon but I didn't get a second to see) and the insanely reflective screen.  I then convinced myself that since I'm not a professional gamer and don't compete online in COD-type games, I probably wouldn't notice or at least be bothered by the input lag in the ST60 line.  I was wrong, it makes games unplayable if you're used to a tv with less lag (which is most tvs ever made).  It makes Leo Messi feel like he's running through sand in FIFA and makes me even worse of a FPS player than I already am.While I use my tv for watching sports and tv more than for gaming, I still do plenty of the latter and I wanted to be able to play PS4 on my new 60\" plasma but found I couldn't without depressing lag.  So I ended up returning this model for last year's ST50 and haven't looked back.  Ironically it's more expensive (due to dwindling supply I'm sure) even though they did make a number of minor improvements.

Delivery was scheduled three days out and they arrived within the three hour window provided.  They unboxed the TV, attached to base, and powered on so I could verify that it was not damaged.  I thought about doing the slides but read so many reasons not to.  All the manufacturers say it is not required at all.  I think most people are just confused and believe all the old stereotypes of plasmas.  Even the slides recommended by DNice are not to help with burn in and are not meant to \"break in\" your TV.  They are meant to standardize the TV before applying the provided settings.  The only way this would help you is if you know your eyes like his settings.  I think he is clear about this popular misconception, but most buyers still misinterpret.  Buy this TV if you can, you will not regret.  Turn it on, set it to CNETs or DNice's settings, forget about the slides, and enjoy.For anyone worrying about glare, this has slightly less glare than any of my previous LCD/LED TVs (three of them).

Granted my living room is naturally on the dim end of the spectrum, but i was concerned due to our 4 yr old 42\" LG LCD being a little dim as well. I think that TV is starting to crap out because even out of the box without touching the settings, the ST60 stomped this test. It matched the LG in brightness and trumped it after turning contrast to 65.I hook up my PS3 through my Harman Kardon AVR1700 receiver and I will admit, there was significant lag. Worry started to set in but after turning on Game Mode and setting a bit of delay (about 60ms or so) on my receiver, the audio/video synced up great. As far as game sensitivity, Grand Theft Auto 5 played exactly the same as on our old LCD. Shooting and driving were snappy, which to me translates any game will be fine.The reflective screen again was a concern but again, nothing worse than the matte screen on my old LCD. I actually even dig it because the glass is very attractive and to me the sharp reflection translates to premium glass.I have left the TV on for over 2 days straight, keeping it on a full screen movie channel when I'm not there, and minimizing static imagery when I do use it. There is no sign of retention after an hour of TBS (static logo to bottom right) and from what I have been reading, this is no longer a true issue with plasmas.ON TO THE FUN STUFF: an actual review...This TV is like crack for my eyes. First and foremost black levels are awesome and deep. At least from memory, it matched the depth of the VT I saw in Best Buy. The remarks are true about plasma producing a more mesmerizing and lifelike picture. Textures and details are reproduced accurately...fabric looks like fabric, concrete like concrete, and steel like steel. This TV delivers all that in spades.

Folks, the Panasonic Vierra TC-P50ST60 (50-Inch) has the sharpest, clearest, vividest, color-richest, and prettiest images that I have ever seen on any television at any price. I used to sell high end TV's for a major chain, yet not even the $10,000-plus models could rival the overall picture quality of this Vierra. I also like the 55-, 60-, and 65-inch versions, but they lose picture quality as the screen sizes increase. As a general principle, the smaller the screen, the sharper the picture. It seems a bit counterintuitive that the model with the best picture quality can be had for (by far) the lowest price. For a paltry $999, my life has forever been changed for the better. This luxurious yet strangely inexpensive product puts you into another universe. This Vierra series hypnotizes and mesmerizes you so profoundly that it tricks your subconscious into believing the unreal, both with its out-of-this-world image quality and its discreetly intrusive yet realistic sound. It has been said that a television's potential is only as good as its source material, but the Panasonic ST series seems to belie that theory. That is because even non-HD programming seems to take on a life of its own. My extensive experiences as a salesman suggest that Panasonic is one of the most, if not the most, reliable of all television brands. It also seems to have the highest level of customer satisfaction. Please note that to achieve the best visual effect, you will need to make significant adjustments to your Vierra's picture (I prefer the vivid mode with increases in contrast and brightness.) An added bonus is the free, one year, in-home warranty. Panasonic's telephone support takes at least 25 minutes to reach, but their website should be able to answer most of your questions.

I researched for months, online and in stores, before deciding on this one, mainly because CNet gave it the highest rating ever for a TV. And I can see why. It's absolutely awesome. It had great color right out of the box. At that time I didn't know about DNice, so used the CNet settings and it got even better. I have never seen such vivid color on a TV. I don't have the 100 hours in yet but I'm still watching stuff and using HD ambient animated screen savers from my cable company. Since the TV has a slot for an SD card I can just put one of those in also, using my own photos, I guess.The delivery from Amazon was very smooth, but they don't set the TV up for you, they bring it into the house, set it on the floor and test it for power and blue screen, will take the empty box away, so make sure you have someone to complete it for you if you are a weakling like me. They won't even put it on your stand. I had a nice neighbor do it for me.I did watch one 3D movie, Avitar ( actually my only 3D movie so far) and it was totally mind blowing. I fiddled around with the settings and must have done something right because the 3D was just like being in the movie theater. I don't know why people are finding such fault with it. When DNice gets his 3D settings up I'll use those. Calibration I don't understand at all. I have a 40in Sony LCD in my bedroom and I didn't have to do settings and calibrations on it so this is all new to me.I've played around with the apps but I really don't have much use for them. I have a Netflix  membership with a one day turn around and send them back the same day I receive them so I get 3 movies a week for $10 a month. There is no reason for me to pay $5.99 to watch a movie. I buy movies from Amazon and eBay also. Depending on the price of new ones I also buy used and have never got a bad one. I also have HBO. Starz and Encore are free with my cable and they have lots more other free TV movies, so I'm pretty much set. Actually overwhelmed.

I'm using, or should I say BLASTING, a Samsung HW F550 soundbar that comes with a wireless subwoofer and I'm getting great sound. The bass rattles my house. I like the uncluttered look.Now, there is one thing that sucks about this purchase and that is the 2 pairs of Panasonic 3D classes that come with it. They are made for someone with an extremely large head which I don't have. I have to use them over my glasses which is a real PITA. If you need more you can get them cheaper on Ebay. You can also use the Samsung active 3D glasses that are only about $20.

I was the one to set it up and I have aged the panel in the zoom mode. Right out of the box i set it to the home theater under picture settings and i was stunned on the picture quality.  Well tonight I went to their place and put in cnets picture settings and all i have to say is this tv picture is amazing. I have last years panasonic vt50 (last years top of the line tv) and their picture quality is right on par with mine at just about half the price. All I have to say is buy this tv. Cnet and home theater nailed their reviews right on the head calling it the best tv value. Just keep in mind if you go to a big box store and this is next to an led it will look dull and dim. Don't let this discourage you in any way at home this tv will shine. That same led will create major eyestrain in a home environment, you will have to play with settings. Any tv you will have to play with the setting to get the best picture quality. Also remember that most stores at minimum are about 50% brighter than a home environment if not more. At home this tv will be plenty bright.This tv by far has the best bang for the buck out there. From the reviews it seems close to the new vt and zt for half the price. On a side not i went to BB in a light controlled room and viewed the samsung f8500 and was blown away by its picture quality. I think it is as good as my vt50 if not better which is a big jump for samsung plasmas.The only led that can compare to the st60 is the top of the line sony or the sharp elite both being 2x to 3x the price. I have changed several friends to plasma buyers after they have watched a movie or directv with good content at my place. With new st60 it will be easier to convince people considering the price point.

But this new 65\" ST is mind blowing. The colors are very accurate, the contrast is so good and the black is really dark so good content has a lot of depth. Makes you more aware of the videography work and camera quality. Just set it up two days ago so will still need to play with settings and may use some of the online (professional) suggestions.  I tried the 2D to 3D converter and it seems rather gimmicky. Will try to get some 3d blurays from library. Should be nice.  Have fooled around with wi-fi features only a little and seems quite nice. Never had a Smart TV before so learning curve will take time.  I ordered this tv for less money than this site and shipping worked out fine.(sub 2k) Got it up on my wall in no time. Get the 65\" if you can afford it. After a day or two it doesn't appear too large. Actually, it's just right for our space. (It's a great room space).  I imagine the only better plasma than this is the VT and ZT models from Panasonic and I didn't want to spend that much. This tv is very thin for a plasma and the thin bezel looks good since you barely notice it. At 85 lbs it's lighter than my older 50\". (70% more screen real estate on 65\" than 50\").  Plasmas look much better than the majority of LCD/LED screens except the very expensive full array/local dimming models. Just as with most products, the majority of people do not do much intelligent research so will go to Target and get a Vizio or Samsung LED on sale and be very happy with it.

The black levels and color accuracy are as good as I've seen on a TV. I researched quite a few TVs before I decided on this one and ultimately decided on this model. The only dissapointing thing I've run across on it as of yet is the 3D performance. I've calibrated the TV so the picture looks fantastic in 3D, but there is a lot of cross talk. To make it even watchable you need to turn on the motion smoothing which can give it the soap opera effect, but it's a small trade off for a great picture. And really, the bulk of content your going to watch is in 2D and that's where this TV really shines.Overall this has been a great TV. The only complaint I have is small compared to how much I like this product. I got my calibration settings from CNET in their review.

Don't worry, It's not a manufacturer sponsored review being propagated around the web by robots or aliens.Review:I bought the 65\" version of set just in time for the NCAA tournament final four. It was barely in stock anywhere...I didn't quite realize how new the set was, I just knew that last years version was highly rated and I'm a plasma fan. This is my third Panasonic plasma and the previous two have been solid sets with no problems at all...so no hesitancy with plasma or Pana. I was replacing the 7 year old 58\" unit in my family room...an unnecessary upgrade according to my wife, and I'll admit feeling a little guilty about the indulgence until I plugged it in.Wow, immediately the difference in picture jumped out at me. Seriously, 15 seconds and I was hooked. Greater contrast and depth of field, much deeper blacks, great brightness, better fast motion handling. Just terrific.The default picture settings are pretty solid, but seem set for a dark room. My family room is quite bright so I used the custom picture mode and brought up the brightness and lowered the sharpening a bit and that was it. Good to go.Speaking of a bright room, the other improvement is that this screen is better at handling room glare than the old one. It certainly doesn't eliminate the plasma-glare problem, but It's notably better than before.The set comes with 2 sets of 3D glasses. Additional ones from Pana are almost $70. I bought 4 more compatible but slightly less ergonomic ones from Samsung (SSG-4100GB) for $18 each. All work very well. I really didn't (don't) expect to spend a lot of time with 3D content but of course had to try it out. I'm pretty impressed though. I still probably wont use this feature a ton and the 2D-3D conversion feature is hit or miss depending on the composition of any given scene being viewed.I'm not a huge fan either of all the smart TV functions the manufacturers are pushing out. I have good streaming and apps for other devices in my home theater setup... I didn't need more. I wish they would offer a version of the set that's Just a TV and save us all a few bucks.So in summary, tell your wife it's a real upgrade and worth every penny and then go buy it.", "Date": "May 4, 2013"}, {"Title": "Mixed Bag but salvageable.", "Author": "Lucky", "ReviewID": "R3G4BTJ0D5JBUL", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "We are troubled by the darkness of the picture.

Reflective screen.  This is my first flat screen tv with a smooth surface.  My previous tv was matte, so didn't have this problem of background lights and objects reflecting off the screen.  Supposedly this model has a filter that lessens the reflection, but it's still there and very noticeable when not in darkness.2.  Remote controls don't work!  All of my remotes now require several button pushes for everything.  Sometimes the signal goes through, sometimes not.  This, apparently, is a well known problem with plasma tv screens, since they throw off IR energy that interferes with IR remote controls.  Sadly, no reviews I read anywhere mentioned this, so now it seems I have to buy more hardware to fix this situation or get a non-plasma tv.  This is a fairly significant drawback, imo.Also, I just found out yesterday, the day I got the tv, that Panasonic is discontinuing their plasma tv lines.  No more.  Plasma seems to be on its way out completely, overtaken by LCD.UPDATE - 11/20/13Regarding the remote control issue: it seems the solution is..... masking tape!  masking tape over the remote sensor on my receiver and cable box.  It's ugly and not very elegant, but it's cheap and fixes the issue.UPDATE - 5/29/14High electricity consumption.  I've have had this tv for a little over half a year now, and have noticed a marked increase in my electric bill since then.  Maybe my rates went up?  I don't know.  I do know that my bill is now higher $20 PER MONTH.

The picture is almost unbelievable, but there it is in front of me.

It's possible that the colors are a little too vivid, but that I can't tell since I don't have the same vase in front of me for comparison.  Closeups of baseball players at times make me want to phone my dermatologist, the skin blemishes are so lifelike.  My last set, a 42 inch Panasonic plasma, but 9 years old and costing over $4000, paled (pun not intended) in comparison.But now the annoyances.  When I tried to hook up an antenna (in addition to my cable box--the cable goes out at times), the instructions were all wrong.  Phone calls to Panasonic got me nowhere, as did phone calls to Amazon.com.  Only a question on one of the internet forums got me the answer; and it came second hand from Costco.  And when I tried to download some Amazon.com movies, I got a message that the broadband was at fault.  Phone calls to my cable company got me nowhere.  Finally Amazon.com admitted it was at least partly its fault.  And just today it looks as though they have solved the problem.  At least I was able to download two films. Finally, I was getting lip sync at times.  (I was listening through a receiver and two speakers or headphones via the digital audio output and a FiiO D07 DAC.) Amazon.com did make one suggestion that may have solved the problem, connecting the RCA outputs of the cable box directly to the RCA inputs of my receiver.  That seems to have helped.

The smart TV features don't work for me. I have no interest in shopping, the web browser is difficult to use, and Youtube is an endless \"loading\" screen.

Size is perfect for the space I have.  Quality of the image is flawless!  I did the breakin procedure recommended on several websites like CNET and AVSFORUM, then tweaked the calibration settings to my liking.  Much thinner than my old plasma, although not as thin as some of the LCD's.  But picture much better to my liking than an LCD.  Anti glare coating on the panel is also better than my last one.  This TV is in a bright room with several large windows and I'm happy with picture, although I closed the blinds if it is light outside.  I know some of the LCD's have better overall light output.  But this TV is great for me.Amazon honored the price match for a competing website.  I found it on one of their competitors for $200 less the day after I bought it.  I submitted it through Amazon Price Match and got an email back a few hours later saying they were honoring the lower price.  When I checked on Amazon website later, the price on the website reflected the lower price.This was first time I've purchased something this large/fragile through Amazon.  Freight delivery service was good, although the notes we submitted when we scheduled the delivery never made it to the delivery crew, so it was delivered a day late, but not a major issue.

But the reviews/price kept leading me back to the Plasma Vieras.We caught this on the last days of a sale when the average going price was as low as $2100 - the sale price put it down to $1800+ tax.  Wow.  What a steal!  This set, though larger than our old plasma is both thinner and far lighter!  All the \"smart TV\" stuff like optional \"home screen\" is just silly and superfluous.  The speakers are passable for TV speakers, but really... who's seriously buying a 65\" TV and NOT routing their audio through a dedicated receiver/proper sound system?  The front screen is still pretty reflective... we've got a large window behind our couch so, unless it's casual \"background\" watching, we always want to close the curtains.  All that said...So picture quality... I think the biggest drawback of this TV is that when you see how amazing the HD Blu-ray stuff looks on it, it's hard to endure TV signals of lesser definition.  The picture this screen delivers is simply gorgeous.  Blu-ray content is utterly scrumptious eye candy.  The blacks are inky, dark voids of blackness, the colors are vibrant and the cinematic size of the screen is fantastic!  If you are considering the 60\" version?  Don't.  Just bite the bullet and go big with the 65\".  It may seem decadent at first, but you get used to it fast and suddenly that old 50\" looks like a postage stamp.  This 65\" television is the way your content was meant to be viewed.  Your movies have never looked better.  Your music videos have never looked better.  Your HD television (in our case, DirecTV) has never looked better.  Your sports have never looked better.  And while I'm not a fan of the \"motion smoothing\" for general content, it IS ideal for sports - otherwise I turn it off.The 3D was really an afterthought for me.  An article I read mentioned that, due to the demands of the technology, manufacturers often use higher quality parts in their 3D TVs that also serve to benefit the 2D viewing.  It turned out our Blu-ray player already was 3D compatible and we happened to have a version of Disney's TANGLED in 3D, so we cracked open the 3D glasses that came with the TV and WOW!  There's something about the novelty of 3D at home that is really appealing - maybe it's not having to shell out all the extra money on a more expensive ticket at the theater.  The 3D quality is fantastic, but what's even crazier than that is the button that upscales 2D signals to 3D.  That means ANY content going to the Panasonic TV can be upscaled to 3D.  While this converting-on-the-fly is a little wonky, it's still surprising how effective it can be.  That said, intended 3D content that is mastered for 3D is a real showstopper on this television.  My only gripe with the 3D is that it uses a technology that requires battery-powered glasses, whereas some sets use the same 3D technology used in movie theaters - a tech that does not require battery-powered glasses.  While 3D will be a small percentage of my home viewing, the experience is so fun and effective and that I now know I'll be watching far more 3D content on this TV than I ever would have expected.BONUS:  There's an App for this TV that allows you to simply \"flick\" content from your phone to the TV - primarily photos, but I'm under the impression that movie clips and sound files are supposed to work too.  It's as easy choosing the photo and then dragging it towards the TV on your phone.  No special settings need to be turned on, you don't have to be set to any particular input, you just flick and the TV stops what it's doing to then display your photos on the big screen.  Super simple and very neat.BOTTOM LINE:  The bang you get for your your visual buck with this TV cannot be overstated.  I am a VERY satisfied customer and HIGHLY recommend the Panasonic TC-P65ST60!ALSO: At the same time we purchased this TV we upgraded our receiver to the modern Harmon/Kardon AVR 1700 for about $250.  The idea was to finally get a receiver with HDMI inputs and to simply send one input cable to the TV.  The AVR 1700 has excellent sound for such a reasonable price.  The TV and receiver go well together and between the two, we have completely transformed our home theater.", "Date": "January 6, 2014"}, {"Title": "The best in Picture quality", "Author": "Michael Ortega", "ReviewID": "R12Z9OCHCX9LUD", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This TV is Amazing, even the people at CNET Highly recommended this TV for its picture quality.

Well the ST60 series addresses the glare with a coating and it works very well. I have some can lights in the ceiling behind me in the kitchen. every once in a while I will find myself noticing them but they are not much a of a distraction for long. In regards to the brightness, with the Vivid, Football, and Theatre preset picture settings, I found it very comparable in brightness to my LCD. I do think my LCD was a bit brighter but the smooth motion of action sequences make it a great upgrade. I no longer have to see choppy during disaster movies or pixels flickering as the football flies across the screen like I did with my LCD. The Smart TV portion is adequate and I bought a Logitech wireless keyboard for web surfing. The dual core processor switches quickly between things(also a vast improvement over my Vizio). The sound is average, I will probably get a sound bar for this at some point. The audio out only uses a spdif port so you'll have to get a converter if you have an older receiver.  I have played around with the 3D glasses and watched a bit. it does seem to work well even on non encoded cable channels. This was not main reason for getting this TV so I haven't done a bunch of critiquing of that feature.In regards to the shipping, since I live clear out in central Oregon it was delivered by a guy in a really nice mini van (lol and I'm not kidding). However I was impressed that one of Amazons requirement's is that the TV is powered up after a visual inspection of the box and unit to make sure it works. The delivery guy and I took it out, he held in in place while I attached the stand, hooked it up to my cable box and tested it out.  The main reason I purchased this unit was the reputation Panasonic has created with their plasma's in both performance and longevity. This Plasma TV is much brighter than many of the other brands out there. I saw a Samsung Plasma at Best Buy and nearly changed my mind because I couldn't believe that there would be that much of a performance difference.

This thing is incredible!  Deep blacks, no halos, smooth motion, more than enough brightness for me.  Contrast is at 79 and I have to turn in down at night because it hurts my eyes.  I ran the D-Nice Break in slides with some mixed content for about 100 hours and then tweaked it to his settings.  Everything looks incredible.  I watch Blu Ray, Streaming content from the apps, and from my DLNA server.  I love the Netflix and Hulu apps, they look and sound incredible.  I was able to send the TV audio out to my AVR so even supported NetFlix and Hulu content is broadcast at 5.1 audio.  The DLNA function works very well.  I have several TB's of HD content on a server and it plays it butter smooth, outputting the 5.1 sound and looking great.  It plays MKV files great, but strangely does not support AVI.I did run into a little image retention the other day, but was able to clear it up with the screen wipe for a few hours.  Even though the pandora app has a screen saver function, it defaults back to static screen for a minute at the beginning of each song.  This was enough to start burning in the Pandora logo in the upper left hand corner.  Also, the DLNA menu started to burn in as well.  It too has a screen saver function, but i was spending a lot of time in the menu tweeking things and should have been more careful.  Like I said, it all went away, but you should be aware of this issue.  It would seem all TV's have their trade offs these days; the LED's with the Flashlighting and washed out colors, and the now dying breed plasmas that are susceptible to IR/Burn in, but produce incredible picture and depth.Anyways, super happy with this purchase.

Plasma is having trouble competing against LCD and the Japanese are having trouble competing against the Koreans, both on account of cost. So this was the time for us to jump in; production is widing down now. We got thje Viera TC-P60ST60 model, the first 60 standing for the screen size, the second 60 for the current year's model (before the 60\" set was the TC-P60ST50). VT60 and ZT60 are higher and much higher-end. Some say the Viera TC-P60ZT60 (or TC-PxxZT60) is the best TV ever. So far. This one is extraordinary compared to our 5-year-old DLP rear projection set.Plasma's advantages over LCD include great viewing quality even when you're not dead-center and exceptional contrast ratio. That was quickly evident. The knock on plasma, that it's problematic in rooms with a lot of window light coming, that seems to be reduced. With the medium-density pleated shades pulled, which still let in a lot of light, the picture was okay to good. Panasonic's home screen / landing page is Panasonic- more than user-centric and the ads in the corner are annoying.We actually wanted to get the VT60 panel, the middle grade, but it's a quarter inch wider than the ST or ZT and we had a tight fit in our cabinet, so we had to choose between the ST and the ZT at about $1,000 more, and figured the $1,000 would buy a very nice kitchen TV that would bring the family more joy than a better-than-good ZT image in the living room.When Panasonic rides off into the Plasma Sunset, following Pioneer, you'll still have Samsung and LG building plasmas, and the hope that OLED will come down in price soon.

Before buying this Panasonic, I tried a Vizio 55\" LED but as seems to be common with LED/LCDs, it had big trouble playing 24fps movies, despite its alleged 120Hz and image smoothing controls. I sent the Vizio back, did some online research and decided another plasma was the way to go. I'm a movie freak. I want film to play smoothly. Everyone knows that plasma is on the way out, but for film it's still better than LED/LCDs.The one thing I did not want to have happen with this unit is screen burn-in. If you're not careful, it will happen. My old Samsung had burned-in rows of dark rectangles where closed captioning appeared (I have a hearing problem). So for the first critical 100 hours of operation with the Panasonic, I did not use captioning. And now, during the day or evening when not watching TV, I turn on the screen wipe to counteract burn-in.So far, so good.  :)", "Date": "December 22, 2013"}, {"Title": "5-Star TV", "Author": "Jeff Mellinger", "ReviewID": "R28HRN4HWS3EDE", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Excellent TV.

The white glove delivery was outstanding.  The crew was extremely careful bringing it in and setting up the TV.  They made sure it powered up ok before leaving after I was satisfied.In the short time I've had the TV, I've run it about 8 hours.  I've been careful to use break in slides and mix the full screen content up to reduce the chance of I/R, burn in etc.  I have made sure to lower the contrast in these first few hundred hours.  I consider this crucial in my research to really get the TV broken in properly.With the settings not at all tweaked and contrast at a pretty low level..I'm amazed so far at the picture.  It has met or exceeded my expectations.  Colors are very rich and warm.  Black levels are very ink and deep.  Coming from a 5 year old Samsung LCD, I'm just blown away by the black levels and overall picture quality.  I thought my LCD looked good, but this just shows how much the technology has advanced in the past few years and how much I had been missing by going the LCD route until now.The major concern I had going ahead with the purchase was the brightness level.  When my wife and I viewed the TV in best buy it looked very dim.  I study for awhile online and trusted everyone's reviews that you can NOT pick out a TV based on picture quality in the store.  I now fully agree with this.  The lighting in stores are not optimal and the TV's are not calibrated or set up to really showcase what they can do. My wife was extremely skeptical of getting a plasma due to how bad they looked in the showroom.  She is now very happy that I went ahead with this purchase despite her opinions.In my house, we have a decent amount of natural light coming in from the side during the day.  I have had NO issues so far with reflections.  It seems the AR filter works well ( sigh of relief).  Viewing angles are fantastic compared to my old LCD.  At night the picture has just been simply outstanding.  In day and night the brightness has not been an issue at all.  This TV is not dim by any means.  I had considered going the Samsung F8500 route for the added brightness and glad I didn't waste all the money for what is turning out to be a non issue.Only con I can say now is that the TV sound is a bit flat, but I have already hooked it up to my home theater setup so no issues there.  Sound shouldn't be a major concern anyhow with this tv.I'll update this in a month, but I'm extremely glad I bought this TV.  I couldn't have dreamed of getting a better deal.  Kudos and much thanks to Amazon for price matching this TV at such a great deal.  Their customer service/speed of delivery/ handling etc has far exceeded my expectations.Bottom line..this is the best TV of the year and the best picture/Bang for the buck out there.

I can't even express how awesome it is. The blacks are truly black which is huge if you're a movie buff, like myself. Watching Blu-ray movies is simply amazing. I've owned this TV a little over a month and I feel like each day it looks better. Sound is what you'd except from a flat screen. It's not horrible but to get the most out of the TV you'll definitely want external speakers.Delivery of the TV was great. The company showed up within the time window they gave me. They carried it inside, unboxed it, installed the stand, lifted it onto my TV stand, and plugged it in. I didn't realize delivery included all of that so it was pretty awesome.Now there is one issue I have with it, and it's one that's been talked about a lot; input lag. I knew this was a known issue before I bought it and I had hoped I wouldn't have noticed it, but I do. This is the only reason I rated it 4 stars instead of 5. If input lag was more in the normal range this TV would be a perfect 5 stars.Grab one of these while you can! Panasonic is done making plasmas by March 2014.Update 1/3/14 - I'm not going to change my rating but just wanted to give a heads up, I now have what I believe to be screen burn-in, not image retention. This is from watching no more than 30 minutes of my local news a day during the week(Mon-Fri)and only after a couple of weeks of that. I mix in a ton of other content, mostly Blu-ray movies at full screen. I've done nothing but baby this TV. I'm just a bit let down because I was under the impression you really had to abuse a plasma set to cause burn-in, which I haven't done. I am still hopeful it will go away, but I've put in about 200 viewing hours since it appeared, with all full screen non-logo content and it hasn't faded a bit.

I felt this package hit the spot.So far this TV has hit all the marks. I found the sound to be so so for shows, You almost have to have setups preset for certain shows.

This is due to each shows that have broad sound ranges and it can push forward or backward the actors talking when other sounds are going on, which then adjustments need made other wise your having to raise and lower volume alot during the show, this can be a simple fix though with proper sound fixing.

Thaler", "ReviewID": "R362Q5FC892ZPF", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Editing this review on 1/30/14 - 6 months plus after original review.  I know, there are now only a few left in stock around the country -  Am greatly pleased w. the picture.  We only make use of the Netflix feature on this \"smart\" TV.  Works perfectly.  The few other apps we tried are not easy to use.  In retrospect - the tacky bezel with the shiny, reflective silver border probably should have prompted me to return this.  I sure wouldn't want it in a room with \"upscale\" furniture.  It's like hanging a huge, ugly painting on the wall - that displays its ugliness just being there.  Again - TV picture itself is tops. However, even in a room with all the lights off, the super shiny ugly bezel will find some distracting light to shine back at you. ======I didn't buy this via Amazon because they said delivery would be in \"one or two months\".  BB  in the Bay Area was out of stock and couldn't provide shipment.  Same with Sears.  Found it at a local chain for same price as Amazon.  I think other sizes in this line (55\" and 65\") are more readily available.  Now for the review.  This replaced a 9 y.o. 50\" Panny plasma.  The screen worked fine til the end - something in the innards died.  Bought this because of reviews here, AVSforum, and Cnet.  This panel is about half the weight of the old one.  The old one had a dull black bezel.  This one has not only a shiny black one, surrounding that is a thin, ultra-bright reflective silver border.  They both pick up the slightest ambient light and reflect it back in your eyes.  In a dark room, the black doesn't \"shoot\" reflections into your eyes but the silver border around the black bezel will pick up even the slightest light.  We use this with a Comcast DVR and a Sony BD player.  Have only had this a week, so may add to this review.  Our old Panny was made before HDMI came out - so we had heavy, thick component cables to hook up everything.  This panel has 3 HDMI inputs (we use 2 of them.)  Being a \"smart\" TV, there is a huge learning curve before you will be able to take advantage of all it has to offer.  There are dozens (hundred+?) settings you can tweak to customize it to the way you want.  It would seem that silver bezels may now be the norm.  We did get a 50\" Panny plasma for our 2nd home about 4 years ago.  It is a dull silver - soat least doesn't reflect light.  Once you are used to a black (non visable) border around your picture, everything else seems tacky.  Would we have not bought this unit because of this \"feature\"?  I don't know.  Maybe there is nothing else out there.  There certainly isn't for the quality of the picture and the price.  We also have LCD panels in the bedrooms.  There is no comparison between LCD and plasma  If you want a quality picture for TV programs and movies, plasma is the only way to go.  LCD should only be considered if you play games.  That's the only area where you should probably not consider plasma both for \"speed\" and lack of burn in possibility with LCD.", "Date": "June 29, 2013"}, {"Title": "Gorgeous TV", "Author": "Robert D. \"Mitch\"", "ReviewID": "R3LW6RGHZBLENX", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Its awesome and its big which leads me to my only con: The enhanced delivery you get was fine until I was told they can't place the TV on a stand or table of any kind.

Games like COD are very bad on this type of TV because they present information to you that is always in the same place on the screen for every game.  In the case of Black Ops II, the 'score streak' icons are on the right side of the screen all the time.  Extensive playing will cause those images to burn into the screen.  If you play games that do not keep any stationary information always in the same spot, those are perfectly safe, but games like COD that have a heads up display, the score streak icons, remaining ammo, etc. that always sit in exactly the same spot, will burn your screen in.I only played using the TV for about a week, and then was watching something that switched to a white background commercial; I could see that my score streak icons were visible.  This was after perhaps only 15 hours of gaming; I suspect it would get much worse with longer use.  Fortunately the TV does have an internal menu with a screen wipe feature; it's a 15 minute cycle of bright white stripes that flash across the TV and after three cycles the icons were mostly gone but still a faint presence since I knew where to look.Other than that; love the TV.  I ended up buying an Epson projector that has very low input latency to game with; gives me the big screen I wanted and no screen to ruin.  If the projector isn't an option, I'd go with a cheapo off-brand TV for gaming since you'll probably ruin it.

My previous TV was Sony HD... the old 600 pound CRT kind.  This is the latest and while not the top of the line, it's exactly what I wanted.It only has 3 HDMI inputs, but with the TV itself connected to the internet (I use a wired connection), I still have a spare port.  The X-box is on port 1 and the Panasonic 1000 watt Blu-Ray/surround sound system is on port 2.  I need to say something about that speaker system as well.  Because it's a Panasonic, these two systems talk to each other via that HDMI cable.  The speaker/Blu-Ray remote can turn on the TV and control the volume of the TV as well as the speaker system.  It's a really nice feature.I do wish that the remotes were lit or something.  Until you really learn which buttons are which, it's easy to make mistakes in the dark.I use the DLNA feature to play music from my computer (in the office) in the game room.  My boy really appreciates this feature since he can have the music and I can have peace and quiet.I generally watch netflix or Amazon VoD directly from the TV itself (I have a roku, but don't need it anymore).  I also play a lot of Battlefield 3 on X-box live.  I have no problem with lag in the game.The most important feature in a TV is the picture.  The picture on this plasma TV is simply amazing.  There's a lot of settings you can fiddle with and I've tried some different things, but the cinema setting seems to work best for me.  My one complaint is that it seems like some of the settings are saved when the TV turns off.  Luckily it's not a big deal.The colors are crisp and very accurate.  The blacks are black, there's no digitizing of the blacks in deep shadow at all.  This is especially obvious on an LCD screen when playing a night mission.  There's no ghosting or other video artifacts that I have ever seen.  Action is smooth and there's none of that \"soap-opera effect\" that I've seen on LCD TVs (my mom has a Visio 45inch LCD).The TV is attractive even when it's off.  And it seems very tough.  I like to have killed the boy and his friends when I came in and found Nerf suction cup darts on my new TV, but they didn't leave a mark on the surface.In my house, the game room gets full sun in the morning and watching TV in the morning just isn't a good idea.  The colors are washed out and the surface seems very reflective of ambient light.  I really don't care since most of my TV watching is after the boy goes to bed.

Look, I know that's an exaggeration, but it is significantly better than last years well regarded model.  New menus etc are nice and whatnot, but who cares.  If you spend that much time using the apps on a tv, you have issues.  Netflix button on remote all you need.  Cuz you're trying to WATCH something and that's where this thing rules.  Rules harder than last years.  And for same/less money.So, you're looking for a TV...what to do?  Buy this one if it's in your budget.  Dead serious, that's your choice and no arguing.

It is replacing an LG60PC1D, which went bad two months ago.  I really enjoyed the LG, a 720p/1080i, and would not have replaced it had the screen not given out.  1080p is not necessary, even for large screen sizes.  I was told the screen burned up, probably due to the large amount of dust inside, something plasma owners need to be aware of.  At any rate, the only thing I can really appreciate with the Panasonic over the LG are the colors, which to me appear more vivid.  The sound is not quite as good, but with a lot of adjusting and a little getting used to, is OK.  I don\u2019t like listening to normal TV through the stereo.  When I watch movies or music with DirecTV, which I totally prefer over Dish/cable, I turn on the stereo.  I have an Integra receiver that switches my two tape decks, two VCR\u2019s, turntable, CD, four DVD players, and Roku, and does a great job of upscaling everything to 1080p, as well as produces great sound.  So, I only have two HDMI cables running to the TV, one from the Integra and one from the DirectTV DVR.  No need for more than two HDMI inputs, though this TV has three.  I also use a Harmony 900 RF backlit remote, which I also highly recommend, so I don\u2019t care that the Panasonic remote is only adequate.  What else is good about the Panasonic?  It weighs only 79lbs. as compared to 135lbs. for the LG.  The apps are nice and the Panasonic loads everything quickly from my CenturyLink DSL modem, which I also recommend.  I did have to enter my Wi-Fi modem password three times before it took, but once I got it going, the apps have been great and load pretty fast.  I watch a lot of sports, including hockey, and in one football game I noticed a motion artifact, but I\u2019m guessing it was not caused by the TV.  I see no problems with blurring or judder.  This is a good TV and as long as it holds up (knock on wood) I\u2019m extremely happy with it.  Superb picture with blu-ray movies and sports.  You\u2019ll love the color.  It is absolutely necessary to calibrate the picture.  If you can\u2019t do it yourself, just use Robert Wiley\u2019s custom settings, available on the internet.  Don\u2019t forget to \u201ccopy\u201d them to all inputs.  Turn off CATS, ads, video NR, and the motion smoother.  Go to full screen and forget the home screen.  My only changes from Wiley\u2019s settings were to bump up the color and brightness slightly.  Don\u2019t put windows and lights in a direct line with the TV, or you will see reflections.  I have lined curtains to keep the light out, but with the curtains open; there are no reflections since the window is on the side of the room.  I did have to move the stand alone light to the side of the room.  The Panasonic is totally bright enough, even with the curtains open and the sun shining.

This review is directed at consumers who might consider saving a few bucks purchasing a \u201clike new\u201d television from Amazon Warehouse Deals.On July 10th, I checked on the price of the 65 inch Panasonic ST60 as I had been doing a bit obsessively for the past few weeks.  To my surprise the TV had dropped in price to under $2000.  The TV, which had held stable around $2400, was suddenly in my price range and I decided to make the big purchase.  This is where I got greedy and made my mistake.  Instead of purchasing a brand new TV, I decided to take a chance on a \u201cLike New\u201d ST60 from Amazon Warehouse deals.

If something goes wrong with your order, as was the case with my Panasonic TV that was destroyed in transit, Amazon will only offer a refund and refuse to replace the item.  While under normal circumstances, this may not cause problems, if the price of the item goes up between your purchase and your report of the claim, Amazon will not honor the previous price and thus your refund will not be equivalent to a replacement item.When I first reported that this item was destroyed in transit, the amazon representatives that I spoke with on the phone were professional, conveyed empathy and did a great job of attempting to negotiate an agreeable settlement. Unfortunately, however, because the purchase was a Warehouse deal and because the price of a comparable TV jumped over $400 since my purchase, Amazon would not offer me a replacement TV.  Amazon did offer to refund my purchase and credit $200 towards a new TV, but due to the $400 increase in price, this was not an acceptable resolution.

This TV received raving reviews from CNET, but I can only conclude they never tried to use many of the apps.  While the picture, color gamut and blacks are great, everything else falls down after that.  And that is why I give it just two stars...because it doesn't deliver on advertised features and capabilities.  The non-Smart version of this TV (the -T60) would be a better buy, and here is why.  Panasonic appears to be clueless about rendering a Smart TV.  While Netflix and Youtube apps work well most of the time, other apps, like Ustream and GaiamTV don't work at all even with latest software update.  The internet browser app is a waste of time.  Web pages are not properly displayed and when they do display they have severely truncated content.  The browser frequently crashes and you will discover just how much Flash content there is out there because you won't be able to play any of it.  In fact, attempting to play it, will often cause the browser to crash.  Now the final straw.  The TV comes pre-loaded with the Skype app.  However, there is just one camera that will work with the TV and that is a Panasonic branded communication camera: TY-CC20W.  That camera is unavailable from retailers and Panasonic's National Parts Center.  A number of retailers have the device listed as discontinued.  Other TV Cams for Skype are not compatible.  The TV will ONLY work with the Panasonic camera, but you the camera is not available.  I have had multiple calls over the past three weeks with Panasonic to try to resolve these issues, to no avail.  Miserable customer support experience. I will be going back to Skype on the laptop, 'cause it won't work on this TV.

There's a pretty distracting chrome and black bezel that is hard to make out in the product pictures. Front-facing, mandatory red LED power indicator. 1/4\" strip of unused screen not covered by bezel (this is for anti burn-in pixel orbiting feature, according to comment below).Picture quality - in terms of clarity - was pretty good. Color was a nightmare to calibrate. Expect to shell out money for professional calibration. In my experience with the ST60, to get anywhere close to accurately reproducing color you'll need to be in a pitch black room. In our living room this TV was never bright enough even at night. We don't have that many windows in our living room but daytime sports watching was out of the question. Sure, you could get it bright and vivid, but as soon as night fell you'd have to redo it all.(If I was reading this review, at this point I would assume that this person is an idiot and doesn't know how to properly calibrate a TV.)I dunno if it's a plasma thing but it also had a crazy weird dithering effect even when all \"special effects\" were turned off. The constant battle with picture quality is why I returned this TV. Judging by the many glowing professional reviews, I may have had a defective one. Of course I have since learned that there are a lot of loyalists to the Panasonic brand and plasma tvs in general, so take every opinion on the internet with a grain of salt.Panasonic's take on Smart TV user interface, with the home screens and the pop-up advertising banners when you turn your TV on, is definitely... interesting. I have a Panasonic Blu-ray player so I was familiar with the company's approach which seems to boldly innovate on the menu design and fail on the apps you're using that menu to access.Contrary to other reviews, I didn't think the sound was that bad for a flat-panel TV.Whether or not the TV was fully functional, I'd highly recommend looking at other options.

I had  unfortunately had to give it away tho since when i moved it was too big to fit in my car.Ok now on to my review of this tv let just say im extremely dissapointed with this tv im coming from a 32 inch emerson lcd tv, the worsed tv i have ever owned.This tv is way too dark i try cranking up the brightness but it can't get bright enough for my taste  , The only time i Can use this tv is in the  night.The shows on 480 p where okay. blurry but okay i guess.Videogames looked pretty good,There was noticible imput lag  when i tryed playing cod, so if you're  into competitive online games this tv is not your friend.Ok now on to the biggest reason im MadNetflix  On my cmrt tv looked amazing and clear, when i hooked up my ps3 to this tv to get on netflix i was expecting the same picture quality from this tv or better. but netflix on this tv was straight up horrible it was so blurry i couldn't even see the guys face and it looked darker than usual, i was thinking maybe its on 480p but i pressed the info button and it said 1080p  i was shocked that  cable shows looked better than a 1080p hd content!!!To sum up my review this 50 inch panasonic tv from me  gets a 1 star, i feel lied to by cnet they  said this tv can get really bright, that it had amazing pic quality, But  they lied to me im starting to think that maybe they  payed for that 5 star review.So my final thoughts on this tv.Too dark.Really bad imput lag, even with game mode on the imput lag is horrible, my gaming monitor is  1 ~ms , while this tv is 100 ms!!!!! imagine playing a video game online like cod, i did and i went 1-20 seriously and im a beast at cod i normally go like 30-2 or with a few more deaths, but yeah if you play competitive games online you're gonna be always 10 steps behind your opponent .Netflix is horrible,unwatchable .Pic quality on this tv is  extremelyoverrated Yes it looked pretty good on sum video games but i couldn't really tell because the tv is too dark.Sound is really really Bad you will definatly need a sound bar if you get this tv.3D is really really bad unwatchable like netflix they shouldn't had included 3d on this tv yes is that bad, it could had even lowered the price of this tv.When i got this tv i was so excited i thought i was getting  a tv with amazing pic quality, according to cnet, but i would had never thought netflix would look unwatchable, im extremly dissapointed i thought i was gonna love this tv because of the good reviews but it was the oposite i wouldn't be surprised if panasonic  writes all this 5 star ratings on here with duplicate accounts.My final review 1 star most disappointed purchase i have ever made in my life.Edit. Samsung UNF8000  I just found the perfect tv , i read the review of this on plasma guide tv and  they said netflix on it looks amazing. also  its really bright unlike this panasonic tv st60, and has better pic quality.  the only problem that is way out of my price range 2000$ is the cheapest price on a 46 inch tv!!!! man i found the perfect tv but too expensive!!!!", "Date": "May 1, 2013"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "Unavailable", "Features": "Active 3D Full HD; Infinite Black Pro Panel;2500 Focused Field Drive\nVIERA Connect with Web Browser\nIncludes 2 Pairs of 3D Active Glasses\nDimensions (W x H x D) (w/o stand)  - 46.1\" x 27.5\" x 2.0\" (General depth: 1.7\")\nTV without stand (Width x Height x Depth): 46.1 X 27.5 X 1.93 Inches, TV with stand (Width x Height x Depth): 46.1 X 29.6 X 11.7 Inches", "Name": "Panasonic VIERA TC-P50ST60 50-Inch 1080p 600Hz 3D Smart Plasma HDTV (Discontinued by Manufacturer)", "ImgURL": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/31iCZ9611ML._SX300_.jpg", "ProductID": "B00AVRJK76"}}
