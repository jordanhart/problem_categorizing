Read the excellent wirecutter.com. Every single word written about tv's lately says plasmas have better picture quality, dollar for dollar. Every single review says at 42\" the 720 resolution is fine.So, ok, I decided I wanted a budget plasma, I don't need any 'smart' features, and don't think 3D is worth my time yet. The 2012 Samsung PN43E450 kept coming up as a good value. I also considered the Panasonic line, particularly the TC-P50U50. Also considered a low featured good value TV. Picture quality is my main concern. It is a TV after all.So I set about finding the Samsung in stock locally so I could check it out. Went to BestBuy, Walmart, Sears, and Target. Yeah, I know, I am crazy. And I am a person that loathes big box stores. Anyway, I finally found myself at a BestBuy that had the old Samsung, the Panasonic, AND this one. This one made me nervous because there are simply zero reviews out there for it. So doing a little snooping about and I think this is simply just the 2013 version of the PN43E450.So standing there in store with all these TV's blasting all around is a serious mind game. The plasmas look dull compared to the LED's, the 42\" looks small compared to the 50's, and the 720 looks pixelated compare to the 1080p's. Look the salesmen say as they put their faces a foot from the screen, you can see the pixels on the 720 vs 1080. Stand back and the LEDs are glowing like beacons in the dark. How is one supposed to choose the cheap ass plasma over the other more expensive choices?Finally, after agonizing over a stupid TV for way too long, my budget conscious brain won. Maybe the first time ever, but it did. I bought the cheap, dull, small one.Holy Sh--! This TV is amazing! Set it up in my living room and it feels absolutely gigantic, the picture is gorgeous, and it is plenty bright enough. Yes, I know, the other TVs are bigger, better, and with more features. I will eventually get used to the size and will probably want bigger, and dropping $1000-$2000 will get me a super duper TV (hear me Apple?) but the point is, that this is simply an excellent TV when judged on its own merits. 400 bucks and you have got a damn good TV.", "Date": "March 14, 2013"}, {"Title": "Fantastic TV (And not just \"for $400, but PERIOD)!", "Author": "W.

After doing a lot of research on LCDTVbuyingguide.com, plasmatvbuyingguide.com, cnet.com, and most importantly thewirecutter.com, I arrived at the PN43F4500.My needs are as follows: - MUST fit into existing armoire (41\" of width) - MUST look good in both a dimly lit room and with light, as we have a 2-year-old and do watch TV during the day/weekend - MUST work well (response time) with the XBox for video gamesThis set exceeds all of these needs and more. After a little calibrating, it looks fantastic and the response time is even better than my Samsung LCD was (kicked some serious @$$ in Halo last night.)My minor gripes: - Only 2 HDMI ports and both are located on side edge instead of the rear panel. - ONLY optical audio out, so I can't run it into our old AIWA stereo w/RCA like we were before (although a converter can be purchased for ~$16). - Panel is pretty reflective (versus a matte finish), so if you have windows behind your seating, this might be an issue.This new set is great, and I would recommend it to anyone (BTW, I snagged it for $378, by price-matching a few brick-and-mortar stores against one another, so keep an eye out for deals.)As I couldn't find calibration settings for this specific model, I used CNET's professional settings from the 2012 51\" model (PN51E450), and it looks great, so I'll pass those along now:--PICTURE MENUMode: MovieCell light: 14Contrast: 91Brightness: 46Sharpness: 0Color: 51Tint: G50/R50--SUBMENU: ADVANCED SETTINGSColor space: Native/Default settingGamma: +1Dynamic Contrast: OffBlack Tone: OffFlesh tone: 0Motion Lighting: Off--SUBMENU: WHITE BALANCER-Offset: 26G-Offset: 25B-Offset: 25R-Gain: 22G-Gain: 24B-Gain: 25--SUBMENU: PICTURE OPTIONSColor tone: Warm2Size: 16:9HDMI black level: NormalFilm mode: OffScreen Burn protection [default values]", "Date": "August 29, 2013"}, {"Title": "Bang for buck Budget TV", "Author": "hungryhippos", "ReviewID": "R25H44YQSBXT3L", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "The good:- For $400 the colors and black levels are fantastic- The physical controller and TV menu is easy to navigate, you get a good amount of options to calibrate the TV for sub $500. (People don't think about this but I think its important. Play with any of sharps TV's or some cheapo off brand in walmart/sears and you'll understand)- 720p good in a sense because most TV programming doesn't even broadcast 1080p, pretty much all xbox360 games are 720p, PS3 games on the otherhand are all over the board.- Sound quality is good for a built in TV, especially if you're just watching standard programming on TV where you want to hear voices and people talking clearly.The bad:- Glass panel = bad in day light/bright lights- The reds looks funny to me (Might be a matter of calibration or could just be a $400 dollar TV or my TV just hates me)- 720p means all your 1080p get compressed which means you get artifacting (but its not horrible on this TV, you really have to be paying attention to see it)- No Smart stuff/networking/twitbookspacepandoraflixinstantawesomeapp)- Being a plasma it has the potential to burn in- I gave this TV 4 stars because the blacks and gray levels could be better for a plasma.____________________Personal thoughts:This TV surprised me for $400 dollars, it really did. If you only want a sub $500 dollar TV this will blow away every LCD/LED in its price range, even twice its price but only if you're watching it in a relatively dark room. Being a inexpensive TV its not going to have fun things like smart apps, networking etc but I personally could care less because more often than not, you'll be picking up some sort of BluRay player that has it built in anyways or if you're really desparate, a computer can do the exact same job + some if you have the right connections. If you have extra cash to burn, you can really step up your viewing experience with at least a Panasonic S60 or if you want that 3D get a Panasonic ST60 which I think give the best value for your dollar depending if you want the 3D or no 3D. At the end of the day, this TV is very competitive in the sub $500 dollar market, I think its very much on par with Panasonic and LG's offerings. I think it edges out their offerings with color quality by a small margin. The black levels between these TV's are very similar to the naked eye.____________________Calibration:Not worth hiring a professional seeing as it would cost almost as much as the TV but has enough settings that its worth finding a buddy with one of them DIY calibration videos.I've been watching this in my living room (Heavily recommend picking up a dimmer switch for the room you have it in, watching movies in complete darkness hurts my eyes, I have mine at around 15-25%). I used Dark Knight, Transformers 2 and Finding Neemo via a PS3. I only eyeballed this but I've seen all those movies on calibrated ZT50's, the good ole Pioneer Kuro 111 as well as a variety of LCDs and LED backlit LCDs from samsung, sony, LG, sharp etc so I have a general idea as to how those movies should look.This calibration isn't perfect by any means, I think the blacks and gray levels are as good as they will be with this calibration but I still don't enjoy the colors inparticular the skin tones and reds. People look sunburnt or real pale. Play with the skin tone setting and let me know if you find something better but I opted for a bit more color(saturation) and less on the skin tone fader for now. I've found that bumping up the flesh tones makes people look too red and not natural. I have yet to play with the 10 point white balance but I think that is beyond my ability to judge with just an eye.You can turn off the filters and all that other crap in the Picture Options unless you're inputting some low quality comppressed signal in there like netflix or some other hardcore compressed signal but I much personally prefer it off or low. I don't think they all that much to the viewing experience but that is a matter of opinion.____________________BluRay via PS3 (at night) on Movie ModePicture: Movie, Cell: 14, Contrast: 88, Brightness:43, Sharpness: 10, Color: 57 G/R: 52/48Advanced SettingsDynamic Contrast: Off, Black Tone: Off, Flesh: 0, RGB: off, Color: Auto, Gamma: +0Picture OptionsColor Tone: Warm 2 everything else off____________________Netflix/Amazon Instant via PS3 (during the day) on StandardPicture: Standard, Cell: 18, Contrast: 96, Brightness 48, Sharpness: 10, Color: 68 G/R: 52/48Advanced SettingsDynamic Contrast: Off, Black Tone: Off, Flesh: 0, RGB: off, Color: Auto, Gamma: +1Picture OptionsColor Tone Warm 2, everything off or low (your choice)____________________Edit: I hated the skin tones and colors but after letting the TV break in, the colors look mostly good to my eyes.

Bornstein", "ReviewID": "R3RZWCI2KOVGDI", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Short Saga...I had purchased 47 inch LG LED and set it up in bedroom. Picture was nice but colors looked off and more importantly on cable TV (comcast HD) the motion blur was very noticeable (120Hz TV). I really need a nice picture (It is a TV of course!) so I tried to calibrate it with a blu ray disc I had for that purpose - still, the colors were nice but did not 'POP' and the motion blockiness/blur on fast action scenes annoyed me (although blu ray discs did look very nice) - I could not live with this especially paying almost $700 for this TV. I thought... I know LED is the newest thing but I have a 58 inch Samsung Plasma set in my Family Room and that set has the best damn picture I have ever seen and all my friends agree. So I did some more online research and read the reviews and took a chance on this Plasma set. Let me tell you - this picture is beautiful - vivid colors, NO motion blur and crystal clear. I actually had both sets side-by-side in my bedroom switching up cables and both my Wife and I saw there was no comparison - the Plasma picture was the 'clear' winner! The speaker sound is also very robust and full, no problems there. Also the price could not be beat - under $400! So I saved $300 bucks and got a great Hi-Def screen. Do not be swayed that it is only 720P, if you are more than 5 feet away you will not be able to see the pixels, trust me the picture is Awesome. You can also play content from USB input as well. I didn't care about internet access - my Apple TV box and blu ray player have it anyway. Only downside is only 2 HDMI inputs - oh well, small concession for great TV.

Hentze", "ReviewID": "R949E1IGJZSPH", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I bought the Samsung PN43F4500 43\" Plasma HDTV on an impulse to replace an old smaller LCD HDTV in my basement. I had seen the TV in my local \"brick and mortar\" store and was very impressed with the picture quality, especially for the price. When I got it home and set it up, I was equally impressed. The is a new 2013 model. The TV is as thin as an LCD, weighs about 35lbs, and is Energy Star Certified. Gone are the enormous power requirements, and thickness of the early Plasmas. Out of the box, the only assembly was attaching the stand with 8 screws. I attached my HDMI cable, answered a a quick initial setup question, and I up and running in under 10 minutes. The default picture settings definitely needed some calibration. Everything was \"warm\" and saturated. With a little tweaking, I got the picture looking great in a few minutes. I'm sure as time goes on, I may adjust it even more. Being an entry level Plasma HDTV, there aren't quite as many black level settings, etc. in the menu. But you can adjust it somewhat, along with the usual color tones, etc. As with almost all Plasmas, the black level and viewing angles are excellent. The sound quality from the built in speakers is nothing special, but acceptable. I checked the firmware version my TV came with, and it was version 10.03. On the Samsung website, there is a a newer version 10.10. I downloaded it to a USB drive and updated. It only took a minute or two. There is no changelog, so I have no idea what it fixes/changes. While on the site if you register the TV online, Samsung will extend your warranty 3 extra months.Now on to the Cons if you're planning on buying this TV. The Samsung PN43F4500 is as basic as you can get. There is no 3D, no \"Smart TV\", the resolution is 720p not 1080p,  and most importantly, you only get a couple of inputs. You have 2 HDMI, and 1 component input. That's it. If you're looking to hook up a bunch of video players and games etc., this probably isn't the HDTV for you. If you're just looking for a nice inexpensive HDTV for the basement or bedroom, then it's perfect.All in all, this was the perfect HDTV for my basement. It costs very little, and has a great picture.Pros:Very inexpensive.Latest Plasma technology.Very good picture quality.Excellent viewing angles.Thin and lightweight.Energy efficient.Cons:Very limited inputs.No extra features.Not full 1080p HD.Screen suffers from glare in very bright lighting.Not as bright as other technologies.Precautions must be taken to prevent \"burn-in\".Edit: One other note. I've seen recommendations that for the first 100-200 hours of use on a new Plasma HDTV, that you lower the contrast, and take extra precautions to prevent image retention and burn-in. It may or may not be necessary on today's newer Plasmas, but it does sound like a good idea, and can't hurt.Update: There's a new firmware that just came out (June 20th) that improves HDMI picture quality. I recommend applying the update. It did improve my PQ.", "Date": "May 17, 2013"}, {"Title": "Amazing what you can get for under 400.00 today", "Author": "Playdrv4me", "ReviewID": "RRX3DIJ29PPUS", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "It seems as though every single product category on the planet these days has to sacrifice itself to the lowest common denominator. I'm not that old yet and I still remember when the household \"TV buying day\" was a special event, and you were assured that if you wanted anything at least 32 inches in size, you were going to drop close to a 1000.00 or more for a quality set from one of the major name brands. Fast forward 15 or 20 years and now nothing it seems is immune from the economic race to the bottom, not even a \"big\" TV.I had initially purchased a Westinghouse DW46F1Y1 at Microcenter seeing that as an incredible deal at 349.00 for an LED backlit 46 inch LCD. However I wasn't terribly pleased with the overall quality of the TV, knowing that just a few bucks more would probably get me something from one of the big name brands. I haven't had a plasma in several years and decided it was time to go back. I zeroed in on both the LG and Samsung 50-ish inch \"4500\" series models (how confusing is it that BOTH companies 720P offerings for 2013 are \"4500\" series models, couldn't they have figured this out before-hand?) but felt 449.00 for the LG was only within a stone's throw of the 1080P offerings from both companies at the time this review was written. However, I just happened across an open box of this Samsung sitting off to the side in its box when visiting one of our local BBs. Now keep in mind I have NEVER advocated buying open box plasma televisions. It's just a BAD idea as 9 times out of 10 what you're going to get is a floor demo that has had thousands of hours of burn time or a customer return that has potentially had image retention that the store wouldn't have detected when they took it back.In this case, I figured it was cheap enough worth taking a chance on. The price on the box was 429 and knowing that the current sale price was 449 I asked to see if I could get a better price. We settled on another 10 percent off and the TV ended up being about 385.00. To my surprise, when I got the TV home and set it up it was absolutely brand new. Service menu reading indicated that the TV had literally ZERO hours of use, so this must have been a buyer's remorse return, like my Westinghouse for example.With that little bit of history on the why and the how of the purchase, I must say that the feature set and quality of this TV is absolutely unbelievable at this modest price-tag. There are DOZENS of picture quality settings just like the big brothers to adjust many facets of the image quality to your liking, whether you are a novice or experienced videophile. There is a clock with a timer, a quickly evaporating feature these days, and even PICTURE IN PICTURE of all things! As far as I know the PIP will only work with the TV's internal tuner as one of the sources, but it's still a feature you simply never see any more. Even the remote, which is often a complete afterthought on anything near this price, is a chunky, well made and backlit affair to aid in night time use for those who don't have universal remotes of some sort. And keep in mind, we're still talking about the STRIPPED DOWN 2013 model here, still replete with tons of unexpected features. Additionally, there is an orbiter to protect from image retention, and economy modes which reduce the panel luminance based on ambient light in the room. Typically, ambient light adjusted brightness is another feature found on higher cost sets and something Samsung simply doesn't need to include at this price-point.All in all, Samsung threw the kitchen sink at this TV features-wise to say nothing of the already very respectable Clear Image panel and picture quality for such a bargain bin television. I can not recommend this TV enough at under 400.00 if you can find one. At 450 or higher I would likely recommend stepping up to the 5300 model with 1080P resolution (bearing in mind that the \"street\" price for the 5300 is currently 549 at BB and possibly other retailers at the time this review was written). The BEST no-holds barred image quality \"budget\" plasma would be the Panasonic TC-P50S60 but it's still 700.00. I paid close to half for this TV and it does everything I need it to do. The only reason I didn't give the TV 5 stars is an annoying problem which is being seen on more and more TVs today, and that is the lack of analog audio outputs for those of us who use 2 channel stereo equipment, along with only 2 HDMI inputs of which even the lowly Westy had 3. There are ways around both of these problems, though at additional cost and cable clutter.", "Date": "July 6, 2013"}, {"Title": "Unlucky - now Lucky", "Author": "Benjamin Soley", "ReviewID": "R10SQSKIME0VB4", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Bought this a month and a week ago. honeymoon period was sexy and fun.Then Sunday night happened.

It was a tiny line, not that distracting. I knew this was something that I could live with until a replacement/technician solved this small problem.Thirty minutes later the line grew to a perfectly shaped white rectangle that occupied the bottom quarter of the screen.

I went around to Best Buy, WalMart, etc. to get a true feel for the displays of these tv's and honestly I was blown out of the water with how good the Plasma picture was compared to LCDs of the same size.

Harmon", "ReviewID": "R35B548VUXS3KX", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Let me start by saying this is one of the best deals going right now 379$ for the image quality of a plasma is a bargain. I mostly own LCD's and have found that this unit runs circles around my other 2 TV's in image quality and performance. This unit handles high speed motion with ease. You will find it hard to locate a better value anywhere. 720P is perfect for this size TV and most broadcast content is in this format anywhere. We are getting 105 channels OTA and the quality is absolutely breathtaking on the HD channels. The only downsides I have found are that in this price range your not going to get Smartmenus with Netflix, Hulu, and the available ports for hooking up equipment are lacking. Only a single Optical audio out is available for hooking up theater audio equipment. You have 2 HDMI's and a component A/V input. Also the sound is just average, I have found that putting it in virtual surround sound mode seems to provide adequate performance but for anyone that really wants to enjoy this for movies you will want to pair it with a good Surround Sound System. As far as image goes its outstanding although you will likely want to make adjustments to some of the default modes. Dynamic is bright but has overly staturated colors, also as the name imply's it dynamically adjusts and I like a consistant screen picture. Standard is too dark in the name of energy savings, the good news is you can quickly make adjustments to the \"standard\" and \"movie\" modes, advanced features are not available for \"dynamic\" mode as the are auto adjusted for you. If you set standard just a hair bellow the dynamic brightness and pixel settings, you can then go into advanced image settings and turn off some of the dynamic settings to have a more consistant picture. Keep in mind you might want to set standard mode up for day, and movie for night viewing if you use this technique. The picture will be consistently outstanding using this method. In \"Dynamic\" picture mode I noticed for TV AD's with solid white backdrops the screen scales back the brightness heavily to reduce power consumption. Were not talking a big difference in price per year though and consistency is my target for TV images, I usually turn off the power saving modes for this reason as it creates image quality issues in the name of just a tiny amount of savings. Again this screens contrast is phenomenal, watched some car racing and absolutely zero blur with the motion, its solid and should be an excellent choice for anyone who likes to watch movies in all their glory and see the intricate details of even dark scenes. I would love to have more audio and video connection options but at this price no complaints and one can always use the DVI to HDMI adapters to hook up a PC, in my case this would be used for connecting to a media center server. For now were going to just use this one for OTA and movie playback as its stunning to watch. An absolutely bargain TV for the performance, you will not be disappointed with the TV's capability to deliver beautiful crisp images for TV and movies. As with most sets audio is average but acceptable if you want to have a clutter free setup using just the native speakers and you do have options to tweak the mix if you prefer.", "Date": "July 1, 2013"}, {"Title": "This and a ROKU box are the best thing since sliced bread", "Author": "MikeG", "ReviewID": "R3AG53GP8PFMZM", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This is my first HDTV. I did have a 42\" rear projection back in the 1980's and never bothered with a new one after that broke, although I have kept an eye on the technology and reviews. I was predisposed to plasma from its history but the CNET reviews convinced me to give it a look in spite of the massive number of LED's flooding the market. When I walked into Walmart to look at the wall of flat screens I almost changed my mind because the few plasma sets stood out as being significantly darker than the LED's. But, after spending 15-20 minutes looking, I gradually took to the plasma pictures.I had wanted the 51\" version but the wife said no so I had to settle for this but it's really about the right size in our den. Since we watch TV from 10'+ you can't tell the difference between 720p and 1080p in any reasonable screen size.As to the quality of the display, which is the main point, it's great. I am using the settings someone recently posted here. I did increase the brightness a bit. I wouldn't recommend this for a very bright room but it certainly works well in our circumstances. Audio quality is very good and there is plenty of volume when you need it.The one drawback/positive of this model is no WiFi and it is not a Smart TV. The drawback is that you don't have any built in apps and can't stream your videos directly from your home server. OTOH you don't have the limitations of whatever apps the manufacturer built into the TV and the problems these can cause. I was put off by some of the complaints about problems with the built-in VIZIO apps. In exchange for no Smart TV, this model is extremely cheap for it's quality. With the money you save, you can get a ROKU 3 and have access to huge number of apps (channels) and an extremely responsive interface. Have been very impressed by the combination. I'm sitting here watching Bloomberg TV even though it's not part of my cable plan. Amazon Prime videos also work well.There are even some channels that allow you to stream video and music from your personal server. But being paranoid about security, I looked at alternatives. Security could be a problem on WiFi-equipped TV's also if you give them access to your server.  I also noticed that some of the home server media streaming channels for ROKU don't recognize all formats (.AVI for example). So I copied a sampling of videos onto a thumb drive and plugged it into the TV's USB port and the TV recognized and played them all regardless of format. Since my collection of videos is pretty static, I think I'll just put a spare hard drive into an enclosure that provides a USB port (Vantec makes some good ones), copy all the videos and music onto it, and leave it plugged into the USB port of the TV.Highly recommended.", "Date": "January 13, 2014"}, {"Title": "Now here comes the 51 incher", "Author": "JohnnyM", "ReviewID": "R2AKFURY6SOFBX", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I bought this 51 inch Samsung plasma tv 10 days ago and I have been extremely happy with it's picture quality and resolution.  There really is some mirroring if there is light in front of it...but, my room is quite dark as is, so not a biggie.  I purchased the 720p version of Samsung's plasma line up because of the low price and cable tv HD broadcasts in 720p.  I don't own any blu ray discs, although my son bought me a blu ray player a while ago...but, the cool thing about that player is it's Ethernet connection port and Netflix, Hulu, et al, thru the player.  In actuality, online streaming video is excellent on this big screen.  It has taken some time to get used to it's size, having had a 32 incher in this room, previously.  But after 10 days, it's size looks to be a benefit now. And, it is slim, slim, slim...making it very easy to move to and fro on my tv table to affect a better viewing via distance.There are a myriad of picture quality settings and I figured it out pretty quick, so no prob. there.  The absolute #1 attribute of this tv however, is it's color reproduction.  I still sit amazed by how true to life HD tv looks, especially when the quality of the HD cable tv feed is excellent.  I haven't seen a detriment to 720p viewing with this Samsung tv.So, for the really low, low price...this Samsung 51 inch plasma tv with a max resolution of 720p and fantastic color reproduction has proven to be a fantastic buy for me in large screen HD cable tv and online streaming viewing.", "Date": "June 27, 2013"}, {"Title": "Solves my first world problem for very little money", "Author": "Fermata \"D.S. al FINE\"", "ReviewID": "R2532LFWXXI5WC", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I had a 46-inch Mitsubishi from 2008 that was starting to act up and had developed 2 dead lines to one side and the power supply was starting to fail.  So I figured it was time to replace it.Last year I moved into a house with the ever popular gaping hole above the fireplace that is just shy of 41 inches.  Needless to say, the 46-inch didn't fit above the fireplace so I had it sitting on a stand in the corner of the leaving room which created a dead corner and funky sound stage for the speakers.So since I needed a new TV, I figured I would look for one that would fit in my \"hole\" without sacrificing too much screen space.  LEDs only came in 40\" by samsung and 42\" by LG and they cost twice the price.  I found this Plasma on sale for less about 350 bucks and after checking the reviews, decided to take a chance.I'm blown away at how beautiful the screen is -- the color and realism of the picture is soooo much better than my 1080p 120Hz LCD.  I was concerned that I would have to tinker a lot with the settings to make the colors look right.... however, right out of the box, they look pretty darn good out of the box.  I'm sure they could be tweaked and look even better but that isn't necessary if you want to get up and running quickly.  At both ends of my living room, I have lots of windows and I was concerned that it would not be bright enough during the day -- a oft-heard complaint associated with plasma but it is plenty bright enough during the day.  I will admit that the picture is truly beautiful at night -- however, my old TV also looked better t night and since I do most of my viewing in the evening, it isn't a problem.I have it hooked up to a Sony STR-DN1040 and so have the sound running through that (Blu-Ray and Cable box HDMI into the Receiver and HDMI out from the receiver to the TV and it works flawlessly.I don't miss the \"bells and whistles associated with Smart TV since my Blu-Ray player has all the necessary \"smart\" functionality that I need.

Anyway, the onboard sound on this set is plenty loud, and way more dynamic than I was expecting - and for dialog, it's a godsend.  You can tweak the onboard sound too, but for me, it's fine as-is.The included remote is pretty easy to use, and it has a backlight feature.

This T.V. met all of my expectations when it comes to picture and sound quality. The colors and blacks are much clearer than my LG LED-lit T.V. The viewing angles are much better and this T.V. is also thinner than a lot of LED-lit T.V's that I looked at. I think plasma's have come a long way: this one is really power efficient, doesn't put off a lot of heat.Of course at $400 this is a very basic, bottom of the line plasma with no extra \"smart\" features that I would never use. Don't let the 720p scare you way either. I watch DVD's mostly and from a 9 foot viewing distance I didn't notice any pixilation. The only time I do see pixilation is when I am streaming 420p from my computer, and any T.V. of this size will show pixilation with such low resolution coming into it.  I would highly recommend this T.V. to anyone who enjoys great picture quality and doesn't care about you T.V. being like a computer.As much as I liked the price and performance of this T.V. it went back to the store. I use this T.V. almost exclusively for viewing DVD's and most of them are wide screen (which means I have those black bars on my T.V. almost 100% of the time). I know that screen burn in is supposed to be a thing of the past as long as you don't watch wide screen all of the time, but I just don't want to take that chance. I don't feel like I should have to force myself to watch one of my full screen movies, just to keep the T.V. happy if that makes any sense.I really was hoping that a widescreen T.V. would show wide screen movies with minimized black bars. After researching the subject further I found that there are many types of wide screen movies, and most of the major block busters are put out in 2.35:1 aspect ratio rather than the 16:9 aspect ratio which is what widescreen T.V.'s are built for.I ended up replacing this T.V. with an Lg 42\" LN5300.  The T.V. is visibly smaller and less obtrusive looking than the 43\" plasma.  Although this is supposed to be a 1080p the picture quality is worse to the point that I just turned off a movie last night out of disgust, and sound quality is also very poor.

The TV is sharp (sharpness is adjustable), colors are accurate to my eyes, and I agree with another reviewer that the \"movie\" mode is the best overall picture with pleasing brightness, color, and sharpness. Dark scenes are sometimes nothing but a black screen with voices. It doesn't handle dark scenes well. (Neither did my Panasonic; I haven't seen a TV that does handle dark scenes well). I bought the 5 year warranty for $50, which is $10/year for home service if needed. So far (4 weeks) everything has worked perfectly. I hope I never have to use it, but it's there if I need it. I enjoy watching the 43 inch screen much more than I did the 26 inch screen. It reminds me of looking out the window to see something rather than viewing a framed picture of it.

The colors really pop. This is my first ever plasma TV and I love it. The ONLY negative so far is the reflective screen. My LG LED has a matte screen, this does not. Watching the early NFL game yesterday, you can see reflections and some washout on the plasma. Watching the late NFL game, it was no problem and colors were brilliant. I did a ton of research, and I agree with wirecutter.com, this is the best budget TV on the market. I went with the 43\" because 51\" was too big for the space. Also, the 720p isnt as much of factor in a 43\" compared to a 51\". My LG LED is a 1080 and from 8 feet away, the 720p on the Samsung plasma just flat out looks better. Sound is acceptable through the TV speakers, but I am running (via digital optical) through a AV receiver when I want higher quality sound.

Some of the material was specifically for HD testing, while other material included TV shows, movie clips, and live music concerts.The Samsung F4500 was far and away the better TV. It upscaled and downscaled flawlessly and gave me a fantastic picture regardless of the quality of the original source material. The Samsung was also able to play a variety of differently coded video and audio formats without a problem. I found the Media Player to be easy to access and intuitive to use.On the other side, the Panasonic X60 did a terrible job upscaling and downscaling various picture qualities and in more than one case, actually added artifacts to the video that were not present in the Samsung. The Panasonic was not able to properly play some of the source material and in a few cases would only play video while displaying a large grey box indicating that it could not read the audio that accompanied the video file. I found the Panasonic Media Player to be very user un-friendly and in more than one instance it skipped ahead to a completely different video instead of just fast forwarding .I went in expecting to see the pristine picture and action of Panasonic based on everything that I've read online about how great they are.

The bezel around the screen was so thin (3/8\"), It looked like there wasn't one at all sometimes -very sleek and modern. I sent it back after one day and bought this plasma. Why, you ask? Because I brought the PN43F4500 home from BB and compared them. On a brightness scale of one to ten, My living room is a 5 or 6, so I was concerned when I visited this TV at BB. It looked terrible next to all those flamingly bright LEDs. But my living room is not at the very brightly lit BB, so I gave it a try.

Bought it on sale for a low price, but returned it the next day.The other TV I have is an older cheap 720p Samsung LCD which in my opinion I found to be superior in just about every aspect and having none of the following problems. After doing some Googling I have confirmed that these are common problems of most plasma TVs, including Samsung. And to me every single one was almost a dealbreaker, but combined they just kill it.Cons:1. Grainy image. \"Crystal Clear Image\" as written on the box? NOT! Many shades of grays and colors are grainy, not solid. A normal plasma function called \"dithering\". Scenes with less gray and with bright vivid colors look good, but otherwise due to dithering many don't look so good. Less noticeable at farther distance obviously.2. Limited \"brightness power\". Some kind of technical power limitation. No, this is not the \"room light dimming\" feature. An average scene with a mix of light and dark, and as explained above, with non-dithered colors can make the TV picture look good for that scene, yes. But if you have a scene that's very bright or with a white background such as viewing an internet page with black text on white background, the whole TV instantly dims and therefore greatly reduces the brightness, contrast, and picture quality besides being very annoying constantly changing brightness switching to and from bright backgrounds.  And as you combine a dim screen with a grainy image, it just kills the picture quality.3. Crazy idea of combining a Non-standard HD resolution of 1024 x 768 combined with non-square pixels stretched to a widescreen TV means that at NATIVE RESOLUTION all input is NATIVELY stretched. Which means if you input 1024x768 from any normal device or computer, it's impossible to have the picture not stretched and be normal. It can only be corrected by the device or the TV \"re-scaling or \"re-stretching\" the image thereby killing picture picture clarity and quality. Less noticeable on average TV viewing, but crucial for computer use. So I have to pick either 1. permanently stretched, clear image or 2. square, but blurry image. So if you want a normal square picture from some devices and especially computers, this isn't the TV to do it. 1080 content has to be re-scaled obviously, but ok. But 720 content has to be also re-scaled AND stretched to be displayed on this so-called \"720p\" TV. There is no normal HD content this TV can display without reprocessing and stretching.4. 60hz screen flicker. I thought we got away from that crap now in the year 2014 that was an issue from the CRT monitor era. Not so with this TV! Very noticeable, eye-strain increasing, headache inducing screen flicker! Forget that, back to my nice old flicker-free Samsung LCD.5. Minor issue, but sometimes you get noticeable lines on the screen especially in computer use due to some way plasma tvs work.So I partly got this for gaming due to LCD ghosting but the picture turned out to be so bad that even without ghosting on this plasma I played worse than on my older LCD because I couldn't see as well! I think it was the \"dithering\" that reduced clarity the most. WOW what a relief it was to hook the LCD back up! No eye straining flicker, a clear, bright image that also happens to be square. Return it goes!I can't quite understand why it got so many good reviews. Do people just not notice this stuff? I guess for very casual below-average TV viewing it's less noticeable. But I immediately noticed all this.

It's been over two weeks without a word on an expected delivery date or even a shipping date. I tried calling Samsung several times, but they were not accepting calls due to their heavy holiday traffic. Finally, after waiting on hold for an hour this evening, I finally got through to a human. He was a nice guy but could offer NO help. It's no wonder that their website doesn't give updates, their people are unable to get updates either. The only thing their customer support rep could give was reassurance that it was indeed ordered. Other than that, no additional information. He did add that it probably won't be here in time for Christmas. Samsung, are you reading this? Shame on you!!!

Maybe $2,500.00 - $3,000.00 is not a lot of money for some folks to spend on a television, but it is to me.  This is money I'll never get back, nor derive true enjoyment, nor value from due to the DEFECTIVE SAMSUNG product that I purchased.  After the one year warranty period SAMSUNG Television screens tend to show burn-in and ghosting with horizontal lines, along with very heavy distortion of picture on right side of screen.  This problem is systemic in all their LCD's and LED's.  Consumer's have complained all over the internet.  There are even numerous Youtube postings with the exact same problems as in my DEFECTIVE SAMSUNG model, as well as the same DEFECT in many other DEFECTIVE SAMUNG models.  This defect occurs upon start-up, and lasts for the first 15 minutes of trying to view a program. Then the picture gets progressively worse over time and continuously declines.I tried SAMSUNG's Executive Customer Relations Dept. and was told:  \"We will do nothing but refer you to a local Authorized Repair Shop.\"  They were downright blunt and rude to boot!  I feel robbed of $2,900.00!Furthermore, I was informed that the repair will consist of a diagnosis visit, and then another visit to install a replacement \"Panel\" that costs $1,300.00 for the part plus $279.00 to install, plus taxes......all told, another $1,719.16....at which point the technician basically stated, \"just buy another TV.\"SAMSUNG customer service also told me that their Televisions depreciate at a rate of 20% per year, and that they do not repair any of their products after 4 years!  Their own repair people told me to just buy a new set!!!If I save one family the heartache of losing they're hard-earned money on SYSTEMICALLY DEFECTIVE SAMSUNG TELEVISIONS, and a company that offers zero customer service....I'll be happy!
