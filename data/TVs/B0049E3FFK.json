I've purchased Coby headphones one pair sounded great but didn't last long, but what can you expect for $2.00, from Amazon, but never any other Coby items. The 40 inch Coby has a beautiful clear picture. Although I play it through a dedicated sound system, the sound is good through the TV speakers. So far so good, I'll see how long it last. I bought the five year extended warranty just to be on the safe side. I hope and pray it last longer the LG a brand I will never buy again.", "Date": "January 26, 2011"}, {"Title": "TV had problem after 6 hrs of use (over 2 days) - also this is a 720p LCD TV, not 1080p", "Author": "phwang", "ReviewID": "R3FU25G44YBUT7", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "Bought this TV new from Fry's on 5/29/11.  Used it that night for a couple of hours.  Then watched TV again next day.  On the 3rd day, the remote nor the TV pwoer switch would not work... had to turn the surge protector off then on again, now remote was able to turn the tv on.  Watched TV and channel surfed for about 30 min, now gets to a channel with sound but no image (black screen).  Unable to turn off TV using remote nor TV button.  Had to turn off surge protector again and on - works now.  Emailed Coby tech support - awaiting response... will update my review afterwards, if I get a response.Update:This is the crappy response I got - tech support does not even understand that the unit is broken.-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------We're delighted to have you as a customer and want to ensure that you can begin using and enjoying your COBY product right away.

I bought a new video card for my PC with HDMI out intending to be able to use this 40\" 1080p screen.  After researching and tweaking settings, I re-read the specs on Amazon and found out that this is really a 720p LCD TV (capable of 1080i).  Note the inconsistency in the Amazon description of this item...Product Features and Technical DetailsProduct Features  * 40-Inch widescreen TFT LCD (1080p) is DTV-ready with dual ATSC/NTSC tunersTechnical Details  * Brand Name: Coby  * Model: TFTV4028  * Display Technology: LCD  * Display Size: 40 inches  * Image Aspect Ratio: 16:09  * Image Contrast Ratio: 1000:1  * Resolution: 720p  * Refresh Rate: 60Also, the user manual and the box totally misleads the buyers.  Page 22 of the manual, if falsely claims the TFT panel to have a Resolution of \"1920x1080\"... FALSE!!!So now I am downgrading this from a 2 star to a 1 star.Update 7/10/11:So I tried calling the 877# to ask why my TV is being reported as having a native resolution of 1366x768... well, it goes to a voicemail and the voicemail is full, so no one to answer the phone and no ability to leave a message (which would probably not be returned).See notes on what is 1366x768..[...]Hm... can't downgrade lower than a 1 star.  There should be a 0 star.", "Date": "May 31, 2011"}, {"Title": "Pleasant TV for the price", "Author": "maryc65 \"Mary C\"", "ReviewID": "R3MTU9QX7RB76", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I normally don't review items however since there are almost nil out there on this tv I wanted to voice my opinion. This tv rocks. I had been waiting to purchase a Vizio 42\" model and saw this Coby at Shopko. It was on sale for an incredible price of just $399.99. I watched it for a bit and was appreciative of the picture quality even tho it was only hooked to 720. I knew once it was at 1080 it would improve. They were out and I got the raincheck and waited a week to get it home. The sound at first was tinny but the surround was off and once I turned that on It was much better however needs improvement so the 4 star rating. I did purchase a Vizio sound bar but am electronically challenged on gettin it to work. I need the S/pif cable I guess. Going to get one this weekend. This tv has the same hookups as the Vizio and an excellent picture. I love it so far!

After 3 months using there was no picture. Called Amazon and I was given information to contact Coby warranty department. A Coby technical supervisor from their technical department instructed me to send the unit to them in Savannah, GA for repaired. Four weeks after spending $50 shipping fee on top of the $300 TV,  I have not heard a thing about the status of my TV. I contacted customers service and was told Coby no longer carries my TV model and they are waiting from the shop instruction either repairing my TV or sending me a new model and will let me know soon. I waited for 2 more weeks and no answers. I contacted customer service again and was given exactly the same answer \" they still wait to hear from the shop\" and they also told me the shop technical supervisor was no longer with the company. I asked them to help me since they are the company customer service department. It turned out they are only an answering service and nothing they can do. Their hands were tied. They gave me the corporate number to call. When you called the number the message came on asked you to leave a message. I called many times and could not talk to a live person. I then googled to find out who is the CEO of the company in order to write my complaint to. It is Mr. Young Dong Lee. I have written to Mr. Lee and asked him for his help. All I wanted is to get my TV fixed and get it back. It has been 2 weeks and I have not heard anything from anyone of this company. I plan to write to Amazon and ask them to look into this.  It seems like I am not the only one that has this kind of issue with this company. Horrible experience! lost $350 ...Please do not buy any products from this company. They do not stand behind their products!!!", "Date": "August 15, 2013"}, {"Title": "TV Coby", "Author": "eDUARDO p.", "ReviewID": "RRZPCV9UIQM2T", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Very nice television for the price.

Buckley", "ReviewID": "R2S9MMCKLZYOMI", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I picked up this TV at a local store for around $230. It was a hell of a deal, but it isn't the best TV on the market.The contrast balance is pretty wonky -- the blacks aren't very black, and everything is very dark. It takes some time to tweak the visual settings to acceptable levels. I've also found that component inputs often look better than HDMI, at least in the case of my XBOX. That's downright weird.There is no audio-out to speak of, so hooking up headphones or a stereo can be tricky -- though there is an optical audio port i've never used.It is not compatible with the WiiU gamepad's universal remote, which is more of Nintendo's fault than Coby, but is worth nothing.It will occasionally refuse to turn on, and will need to be unplugged from the wall and plugged back in to reset it. I've hooked it up to a remote controlled power strip to make this easy, but it's a significant annoyance.Still, for me it was worth the cheap price I paid.", "Date": "December 27, 2012"}, {"Title": "Problems since we got it.", "Author": "cjlorent", "ReviewID": "RFCSPHX08ITX2", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "This tv was bought for Christmas in 2010.

Gray", "ReviewID": "R2MVK47COR1GOQ", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I took a chance buying this TV but I found a great deal and got it for less than $100. I had read all the negative reviews here on Amazon but I thought it was worth the risk for that price. Overall, I'm glad I bought it. But if I hadn't gotten such an absurdly large discount, I would probably be pretty upset right now.Just like how other reviewers have described, my unit has the problem where it fails to turn on sometimes. It worked immediately when I first took it out of the box and continued to work just fine for as long as I left it plugged in. I attached the stand and left the unit in my living room until the next day, when I made some room to create a permanent home for it in my bedroom. When I plugged it in in my bedroom it failed to turn on. The blue standby light would come on, but the TV wouldn't actually power up. I had only used it for about an hour or two the previous day, so it's not as though the problem came about after excessive or improper usage. I tried different outlets and a replacement power cord but neither the button on the side of the unit nor the remote control would turn it on.After leaving the unit unplugged for about 45 minutes and then plugging it back in it worked fine. Since then I've experimented a bit and it seems that, once I get the unit to turn on once, it'll turn on and off just fine as long as I leave it plugged in. If I ever unplug it though, then I've got to leave it unplugged for some amount of time before it'll work again. In other words, I can't unplug it and then plug it back in immediately or else it might not work (it's not 100% predictable though). I've had it plugged in continuously for about a week now and I've turned it on and off over and over again without any trouble.I'm a complete caveman when it comes to AV technology, so I can't really say anything intelligent about the picture quality, but I did do a bit of a comparison, though not a very objective one. My father has got a 42-inch LG TV so I took this COBY TV and put it right next to the LG one. It's not a very fair comparison, but the picture on the LG TV is noticeably sharper even to me. I hooked up a Time Warner DVR to it and looked at some clips from various programs frame by frame on both the LG  and the COBY. The COBY is definitely a bit blurrier. The built-in speakers on the COBY don't sound quite as nice as the LG either, but I use external speakers so it's not really any trouble for me. Of course, I wouldn't expect this TV to be quite as nice as a TV almost twice the price. The difference isn't drastic, but it's certainly noticeable, even to non-tech-savvy people like me. The difference seemed much less noticeable when I watched scenes from the same blu-ray movie on the two TVs than when I compared the same TV shows from cable.The COBY TV is definitely 1080p. However, when I first hooked it up to my computer both Windows and NVIDIA Control Panel misidentified the top supported resolution, but I just clicked \"Custom Resolution\" in NVIDIA Control Panel and entered 1920x1080 and it works fine as a computer monitor. I'm sure you can do the same in Catalyst Control Center, or whatever the ATI graphics card utility program is called. It sure is much nicer to watch videos on the COBY TV than my old 17-inch monitor!", "Date": "February 12, 2013"}, {"Title": "Don't Waste your money", "Author": "Beth Seyfert", "ReviewID": "RQWR677GPXFUB", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "We gave this TV as a Christmas gift in 2010.
