At no point did I feel that I had to overtighten the screws in order to keep things from wobbling.  The one glitch is that (in English, French, and Spanish) the instructions for assembling the base have the labels for the front and the rear switched, so that the pedestal is alleged to be closer to the front of the base than the rear, contrary to what published photos of the assembled product indicate.  I don't know if this mislabeling is what has given people problems with the base, or if Samsung used to ship worse-fitting hardware than it does now.  In any case, I'm glad I didn't let the complaints about the base hold me back from purchasing this item.I've owned this set for less than 24 hours, but perhaps some initial impressions will be helpful to other shoppers:1)  I spent over half an hour wandering through an electronics megastore comparing pictures and I have to say that I couldn't detect any advantage of 1080p over 720p for sets of this size.  (I assume that a store this big was feeding in some 1080p content, but I could be wrong.)  At home, over-the-air 720p and 1080i content looks great on this set.2)  While the LED sets are sleeker than the LCD sets, I didn't think that the LED picture was any better.  Both I and one other customer in the store were vacillating between the Samsung UN32D4000N and this set, and we both ended up opting for this one.3)  Some review sites represent these LCD sets as having narrow viewing angles.  To my eyes, that was far from true, as almost every set in the store had a picture that was easily viewable from far to the side.4)  Buyers' guides imply that we all now need sets that are twice as big as the sets we were buying a few years ago.  In particular, a 32-inch set is all of a sudden considered far too small for a living room.  Well, I think this set looks good in my living room.  It's nice not to have my house look like my life revolves around television viewing.5)  If there's a way to have this set memorize channels from two different antenna positions, it wasn't obvious to me.  Fortunately, on my 3rd or 4th try I was able to orient my antenna so that the set located all my local channels on one scan.6)  At this set's current price, you run very little risk of buyers' remorse.", "Date": "May 19, 2011"}, {"Title": "Excellent picture quality, mediocre audio at best", "Author": "J.

My test image appears incredible.  The sound test plays some type of theme song music that I personally find annoying yet it also provides very clear, stereo sound and does so at the volume level your set is  set to at the time of the test.Unfortunately because the owners manual is so lacking it takes time to learn all the settings and adjust them appropriately.

The Samsung quality is all there and it feels considerably evolved from the previous generations I've owned. I'm using this as an office monitor and television - for both occasions, it's a terrific set. The colors are vivid, the sound is crisp, and I have yet to experience any issues with it. I'd also note that this television, while considered the entry level for 2011, is slightly thinner and substantially lighter than other 32\" models within the Samsung product lineup and other companies' models within the same price range. There ARE thinner and lighter 32\" TV's, but you'll spend an additional $150+ just for the size difference.

The Price of the new 2011 models are much better than last year models as well (~$100 cheaper).  The menus are very easy to use in making adjustments.  The remote is also very easy to use.  It has all the necessary Component and HDMI slots for setting up Directv/Cable box, Blu Ray players, and more.  It has it all!!The only aspect of this tv that is not perfect is the sound quality.  I have yet to see a LCD tv with good sound.  I have a 52\" LCD tv in the living room and it was awful.  I had to get a Bose system to finally get some good sound.  This 26\" tv is better than other tv's sound quality I have heard, but its still not perfect.  I use this for my bedroom, so the sound is perfectly sufficient for my needs.

Picture is great, but then most of the new sets look great as long as you're watching HD. For anyone who's still unaware, a standard resolution picture will actually look worse on your new HDTV than it did on you're old 4:3 tube set---just not enough signal information. I'm continually reading user reviews of flat panel TV's that knock the sound quality. Don't know what they're expectations are. I'm sure there are some tinny sounding sets out there, but I've had no problems with 3 name-brand TV's (LG, Sony, and this Samsung). And the sound on this model seems particularly good. Try out the different Sound Modes and make sure the SRS TruSound HD is turned ON, to get the stereo effect. There's even an equalizer. All the inputs you're likely to need. My one nitpicky criticism (which will not be a problem for most) is that the 2nd HDMI input is located on the side. I connected my DVD player there, and because of the height of an HDMI plug, the cable actually shows beyond the side of the bezel when viewing the set from the front (which is of course where you will be).

The sound leaves a lot to be desired.  I fiddled with it a lot and it sounds better, still a little hollow.  The music does not sound good.  I guess it does not bother me much, this is just a bedrooom tv.  The sound is better than my other 42 inch tv, I was mad at that.  At 42 inches, it better sound good, it costs much.  I guess I mistakenly thought that if the picture looked good, the sound would be good also.  Live and learn.  I gave it 4 stars just for the sound.

Purchased for my beach house living room, which is pretty small, so this tv is the perfect size!  Seems as though it would be far too big for a bedroom, but I'm old fashioned and enjoy TV's that don't take up an entire room.  I did initially have an issue with the wobbly stand (as others had said).  I couldn't get the screws to tighten enough and the tv was leaning forward and easily moved in directions it shouldn't have.  After unscrewing the screws and screwing them back in with incredible force, they tightened just fine and the tv no longer wobbles to such an extreme degree.  Right out of the box the picture and sound are perfect.  Set up is easy and hook ups to dvd players, etc are just as easy!  This is an amazing tv at this price--you won't be disappointed.UPDATE 12/2/2011:  I have had this tv for less than 6 months and already 3 black lines have appeared on the right side of the screen.  These are definitely new, as they weren't there right out of the box.  I have looked up whether or not I can return the item, as this negatively affects the picture of the tv or any movies or games your playing.  I will have to look into the warranty (if it comes with one) to see if this item can be returned or exchanged for one that is not defective.

I currently have two LG flat screens of different sizes that work well but the picture was not the sharpest. In the store the Samsung appeared to have a sharper picture and the price was very competitive. In assembling the base to the TV the screws were very difficult to tighten. It appeared that the opening for the screws at the base was to small and the plastic was very hard, this prevented the screws from attaching to the base easily. If the base will not fully tighten to the TV, it will lean forward. The picture was slightly better than the LG but not outstanding. When the TV is turned on, there is no indication on the border to denote that the power is being supplied. The LG has a red to blue light that changes the power status.
