It was the biggest and best brand-- especially for the price! The TV came by freight, which was a pain to coordinate and the frieght guy damaged the bottom of the TV in the process. The company was great though-- they gave me $150 credit on my credit card or the choice of sending the TV back. I didn't care about the damage-- it was in a lower corner and you couldn't even see it.
