We have a Panny 37\" circa 2005 and two new 2010 Sony 46\" Bravia w motion control. We picked up this set for a second home in Florida.Pros: Excellent picture at 480, 720, 1080 w Comcast. Lots of brightness in a sunny room. Although it has a gloss screen, reflections don't seem to be the problem I was expecting. Very thin profile. Simple menus and sets up easy. Three HDMI inputs are a plus. Swivel is nice. TV allows viewing from very steep side angles, best of all our sets. The blacks are VERY black, also the best of all our sets. The price is AMAZING at Costco! Audio is great for me at 10 feet and I have hearing issues.Cons: Haven't found any yet although I have not used it for on line games, a game box, bluray or SD card. My standard  DVD movie looked great.I am sitting here watching college football in HD. There are no compression problems. The ball spirals are perfect and the receiver routes in slow mo and full speed are clear wo rasterization problems. My 2005 Panny stinks at this so I do know what really bad technology and pictures are like.CATS is the auto brightness control that you can set in the picture menu. It works great if you adjust the brightness and color settings in a darker room first. Then during brighter daytime settings the picture will be great. The other way will leave you disappointed or frustrated but there is no need to turn CATS off.Another nice feature is the auto selection of the picture mode and screen fill. Works great for us. If there was a way to grade this a five star ++, we would. A great value buy!!", "Date": "November 20, 2010"}, {"Title": "Best Picture I Have Seen to Date", "Author": "Jay D. Anderson", "ReviewID": "RP9DGZUE849OS", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "The television is going anywhere from $1900 to $700 depending on where you shop. I bought it for my son for mostly movies, television (Football), and XBOX gaming (Madden Football).I saw it in the store (Costco-$699) along side all the other LCD screens and though the picture is glossy it stood out from the masses of LG, Samsung, Sony, etc.  I also couldn't see the pixels in the screen and there was far less distortion around things like printed characters in commercials (the diagonal line blurring/edge-effect I see on regular LCDs). First thing I noticed was that the blacks seemed truly black and so apparently much more dynamic range (range between darkest black to whitest whites).  The set is an LCD panel (liquid crystal display) like what everyone else is using but instead of having the usual back light (that provides light through the LCD to light it up) the set uses LEDs (light emitting diodes) and this technology is a real energy saver (74W compared to my other 42\" plasma at 250W) and this allows the panel to be just 1.5\" thick. There isn't one LED unit for each pixel as I had first thought... rather the set uses diffusing light guide panel between the LEDs and the front LCD panel. The specs say this set can achieve a contrast ratio of 2,000,000:1. This is truly amazing... I did a \"double take\" on that spec... never seen that before. Since most LCD screens use translucent panels to diffuse the light and this one has the diffusing panel on the back of the LCD the screen can be clear. I think that is best and as long as you don't have lighting in the room with reflections that can be seen by you in the television's screen you will see what I mean.  It means that in a night scene you will be able to see more detail as the blacks will be truer blacks (not grays which wash out the picture detail). The set also uses something called an \"Intelligent Scene Controller\" which is nothing more than an image processor (a CPU) that makes futher enhancements by manipulating the brightness of the blacklighting and image contrast depending on the nature of the scene being shown. I think the way this works is that when it is is low light scene (a night scene) the backlighting is automagically reduced and the contrast is increased for that short time frame. This would result in the set being able to show more shades of gray (gray being all graduations between pure black and pure white).Viewing Angle: This issue always bothers me... my brother's DLP television is the pits... got to look at the screen head on or you see vignetting (darkening) in corners, etc. The viewing angle on this set is fandamtastic!  I think due to the \"In Pane Switching\" (IPS) they are doing on the LCD which was design to improve viewing angle. Viewing angle is 178 degrees!  Another \"double take\".... theoritical perfection in my mind.  Remember 180 degrees is \"flat\"... like trying to read a sheet of paper from its edge! I don't think it is possible to get better than that! IPS changes the direction that the liquid crystal molecules move so that they move parallel with the path of light through the panel instead of against it. This reduces light scatter and allows better light transmittance (more light through the panel and so better contrast) and more accurate color. The technology was previously reserved for high end monitors for professional graphic artists (with deep pockets) and the like... now apparently economically feasible for the rest of us. Set has 3 HDMI inputs (better than component video) and you can hook anything up to it.Note on Refresh Rate: I got to admit I got fooled on this one... the set is advertised as having a 120Hz refresh rate. This is actually a specification \"trick\" to get you to buy this set thinking that you are getting 120 frames of video per second (FPS) instead of the usual 60 FPS (for smoother video... less judder for gaming or fast motion sports, etc). I may keep the set anyway... it is very nice and the price is right. My understanding is that Xbox and many gaming systems don't go anywhere near 60 FPS anyway (FPS and Hz are basically the same thing in this case). More like 20-30 FPS and some \"motion blurring\" in the software to give you the illusion that you are seeing much faster movements.  I lose on the sports stuff though... this is a 60 Hz set that is advertized as 120 Hz...If you are interested in knowing how this is... read carefully (and repeatedly if necessary):The system has an LCD screen with a response rate capable of handling 120Hz (120 FPS) as it is likely 8ms (or faster). This allows TV to hold the just shown video frame in a buffer and show it a second time--hence 120 FPS or 120Hz (same thing). There is an advanced setting to set the television to the faster frame rate. But are you seeing new frames?  Nope.  You are seeing copies of old ones.  You are, in fact, seeing the same frame twice and \"technically speaking\" you are seeing 120Hz (120 FPS). But this is a cheap markting gimmic to seduce those 'savvy consumers' (like I thought I was) bent on buying a true 120Hz television. However, a TRUE 120Hz set can take a 120Hz input signal (120 FPS input signal) and display all 120 different frames in 1 second. This set cannot do that.If you believe me... that is good.  If you are still a skeptic I will prove my point below -- Read on:To illustrate the concept... remember those little flip books you could page through fast and see something akin to a moving picture? Each page was differnt and had an incremental progression in movement but seen one behind the other and fast they appear to be a moving image (though generally fairly \"choppy animation)? That is taking advangage of \"persistance\" of image feature in the human visual system. Now imagine the pages of this little moving picture book had 60 pages and you showed them all in one second. The image is pretty smooth for most things except very fast moving things like maybe a \"Hockey Puck\" or a \"Football\" -- that is regular televison (at 60 FPS.)  It is actually quite an advancement over motion pictures that used to show 24 FPS!  Now say you have 120 pages (all differnt) of the same movement and showed them in the same second. If the frames were indeed all different they would show even smaller incremental changes between frames and so the motion in the movie will seem much smoother... and even smoother at 240 FPS... or 480... and so on... etc.  The human visual system sees \"retinal fusion\" at about 60 FPS (but differs between individuals)... probably 100 FPS (100 Hz is a good number to shoot for to cover everyone).In this TV the flip book of 60 pages (60 frames) now has a duplicate copy of each page put into it next to the origial pages now making it now 120 pages... but there are still only 60 unique frames... flip through this 120 page version or the 60 and you see the same juddery animation... no change.What does this mean to you? There are still benefits in having a 120Hz \"Interpolated\" or \"faked\" system such as this as the LCD portion of the screen is capable at 8ms it will be smoother by nature and inserted buffered pages can make the 24 FPS movies (in video format) play smoothly with no noticable \"flicker\" (as old movies often did).  It does mean that for sports or gaming you will still be seeing the same ol' 60 FPS (though each frame displayed twice).  So when the player throws a football fast or other fast movements you won't be seeing them in as many frame changes and so incremental changes between frames will be greater and the image motion will be NO SMOOTHER THAN BEFORE. Also, since the new 3D (using shutter glasses) require a minium of a TRUE 120Hz you won't be able to use this set for that either. 3D shutter technology darkens the L/R eye alternating at the same refresh rate as the display and so the left eye sees the \"left eye view\" and the right eye sees the \"right eye view\" as this also alternates at that refresh rate on the screen... so a TRUE 120Hz is the bottom limit because that allows 60FPS for each eye. True 120Hz sets are likely twice the bucks of this one.In fact, Panasonic sets that are true 120Hz (or better) are sold with the \"3D FULL HD\" logo and right now all of Panasonic's 3D compatible sets are Plasma sets... not LED-LCD or LCD.Anyway... a bit of a gimmic in my mind because it allows the maker to \"legally\" advertize a 120Hz system when you are really only getting the same 60 frames each second (although each frame shown twice). That may be legal but it is definitely unethical as the spirit and intent of the specification is that you can see 120 distinctly different frames per second. I think a number of manufacturers are doing this and hiding behind this obfuscation to sell sets that really are not 120Hz to unknowing consumers.  I hope I have helped to make you a \"knowing consumer.\"", "Date": "December 27, 2010"}, {"Title": "Blacks Are Not As Good As Plasma", "Author": "jaldeborgh \"jaldeborgh\"", "ReviewID": "R3LGHLJS1VY4P3", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "To begin with I am a Panasonic fan based on several good experiences.  I have both 50\" and 54\" plasma sets that are brilliant.  I also have several Panasonic Blu-ray players and all have been trouble free.  My daughter also has a 32\" LCD Panasonic (720P) with iPod connect which also works great.I bought this TV because I wanted to try an LED TV because they are very thin and are efficient.  I have the TV hung on the wall in our guest bedroom - it looks great.  The picture is OK but the blacks are not at good as our plasma sets which are truly inky black.  Otherwise the picture is great.  I am pleased with the sound given the thinness of the TV.  All of the other Panasonic goodness is there - the remote is robust and easy to use.  I am use to the Viera Link and other Panasonic features - although this is a very basic TV in terms of features - but that is all I wanted for this room.  I have not tried the iPod connection yet - it might be fun but won't get too much use at our house.  The TV is connected to an Apple TV and a Blu-ray player but not a cable box - so the only TV programming available is the unscrambled channels offered directly from the wall outlet.  The QAM tuner works well and the set-up was easy.Overall I am pleased - I would give it 5 stars if the blacks were better.  The TV meets all my expectations and the 'normal' Panasonic quality appears to be there as well.  I will keep buying Panasonic partly because they are good enough in every category - maybe not the best in every category but they are never below average.  Also, the quality is up to their usual high standards and the interface is fairly simple and consistent so my wife and daughters don't get confused when they are watching this set or the ones in the family room or master bedroom.  This last point is important as my wife struggles with anything electronic - simple and consistent are very helpful.", "Date": "February 1, 2011"}, {"Title": "Sad ending", "Author": "Rebecca", "ReviewID": "R1ZHR9OUZ9T88W", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "Started out as an impressive TV for the money, however, it has suffered a complete power failure 22 days after the warranty has expired.

On the day it was delivered I had it setup and it seemed to work fine. There is an Eco setting that turns the TV off after 3 hours of inactivity which worked fine. I fell asleep with the TV on and it was off when I awoke in the morning as expected. The next day I customized the picture setup (brightness, contrast, etc.). Now the TV screen goes blank after about 10 minutes. No sound, no video, nothing. I went through all of the setup options and everything seemed to be setup correctly. I have no idea what is wrong. I purchased this at Costco because of the excellent price they were selling it for but I hope I didn't get a bad model. On Monday I will call customer support and see if they can help. If not, I'll have to return it to Costco. I want so badly for this TV to work. I have been a Panasonic customer for many years. All of my TV's are Panasonic. I've even bought Panasonic TV's that were open box items. Never had a problem with any of them until now. I will update my rating if the technical support team can resolve the problem but until then I can only give it 2 stars.***UPDATE***I originally gave this TV 2 stars because of the above mentioned problem. It turns out that this was not a problem with the TV at all, it was a problem with the cable box. After troubleshooting from Costco technical support and Time Warner cable we discovered that the cable box that was being used is not compatible with either of my Panasonic TV's. I now want to give this TV 5 stars. It works like a charm. I intentionally bought this TV without internet access or 3D or all the other technology the newer TV's come with. Just one that is lightweight so I could mount it on the wall and watch network or cable stations and also watch DVDs when I want. It has a beautifully clear picture, the sound is great, and it has a nice design. It does everything I bought it for so far. And to top it all off it is energy efficient. It uses much less watts than my other Panasonic flat panel plasma TV. What's not to love?!  ;-)By the way, the cable box that is not compatible with either of my Panasonic TV's is the Samsung SMT-H3262. Right now I'm assuming it is not compatible, however, I could have gotten a defective box to begin with. In any event I am going to return it to the cable company and get a completely new  model box to solve this problem.", "Date": "January 1, 2011"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "Unavailable", "Features": null, "Name": "Panasonic TC-42LD24 42\" LED HDTV 1080p LCD 120Hz", "ImgURL": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41BR0nSfoML.jpg", "ProductID": "B003Y7W17G"}}
