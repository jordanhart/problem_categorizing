Seriously the blacks get as dark as the bezel in a darkened room. Great color accuracy. Handles motion like a champ even converting 2D to 3D. Menus are very responsive and even the widgets are snappy. Samsung Apps/Netflix works great too. I am really having fun with the 2D to 3D conversion watching sports and playing video games. I watched Avatar the other night, and even though it wasn't released on 3D Blu ray, the built in converter made it look great. I was nervous about Burn In/ Image Retention, but so far watching 2.39:1 movies hasn't caused any issues that don't take care of themselves switching video sources. I need to say that there is a buzz sound, but its pretty quiet. Can't hear it at all with any audible tv volume. My only major beef with this set is the Audio Return Channel and Optical Out only send 2 channel (stereo) audio unless its source is broadcast.  So, my PS3 and cable box will only play dolby directly through my receiver - which in my opinion makes ARC pointless. I hope they change that in an upcoming firmware patch. This TV replaced a UN55B8000 because I was unhappy with its blacks losing details,motion blur, flashlight effect, and sluggish menus and widgets. I experience none of these problems with this new set. I couldn't be happier.", "Date": "April 26, 2010"}, {"Title": "Worthwhile TV.", "Author": "Ishmon \"There is no way to peace. Peace is th...", "ReviewID": "R14Q7ZIANQAFWO", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I bought this exact model the PN50C8000. One might get the impression that it is silver. I'd call it a dark grey brushed metal look. Which is fine IMO.One thing that is not often publicized for some reason is the fact that plasma's are not even close to as bright as newer LCD models. This worried me a little.But when I got it; it took some tweaking but I was able to get exactly the color/brightness I wanted for normal viewing and 3d viewing. All 3d glasses are tinted so it's good to have a very bright setting for when you view 3d.Electronics review websites always talk about how plasmas can do extreme blacks. I set it to where the blacks are on the darkest setting.  Honestly I was surprised that the blacks are not all that dark (note this is my first plasma I'm not comparing it with other plasmas). The 8000 series LED LCD Samsungs seem about the same when it comes to blacks, of course I have not seen both inside my living room environment so I can't make a perfect comparison. I don't actually care; either tv would be dark enough for me. I just thought I'd point this fact out.The primary reason I bought a plasma over a 8000 series LCD has nothing to do with price or darkness levels, it was for superior 3d viewing. 1.) Less eye strain. I have read on more than one electronics site and electronics magazines that the 600hz viewing of plasmas (and the way the image is drawn on the screen) has been proven to provide less eye strain for 3d viewing. 2.) Viewing angle is always better for plasma over LCD. (This is important for 3d because loss of lighting and clarity is a big deal when you are already limited by the glasses.) 3.) Clearly there is a issue with mixing LCD tech with 3d since if you tilt your head the image splits apart. (This DOES NOT happen with the plasma) and 4. All the reviews I've read say plasma's have tested better for 3d viewing.My complaints are minimal but I think they justify giving 4 stars instead of 5. One is that the TV decides to turn off 3d mode on it's own if you for example exit a Playstation 3 game or change to another input. I understand their reason for doing this but I prefer to just have manual control of it on my own. Also I couldn't get the red and white audio out ports to work, even when I selected to switch to alternate sound output. I suspect it was just something I was doing wrong but it shouldn't be something that requires much effort. I gave up on that because I also had the choice of optical or using the headphones port for my audio so it wasn't a big deal. Another minor complaint I have is the stand is particularly heavy. Obviously it's good to have a sturdy stand but they could have made it strong and much lighter weight and I don't think it would have made for any greater risk of the TV tipping over or something..On a side note; when manufactures say that you should sit closer for optimal 3d viewing than normal viewing they mean it. I'm glad I didn't get any smaller than 50 inches.For optimal 3d immersion I found I like sitting just 5 feet from the screen. For normal viewing I sit at about 8-10 feet from the screen.", "Date": "July 9, 2010"}, {"Title": "Pleased after lots of research", "Author": "Erichb101", "ReviewID": "R1UNWD0DER0L5J", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I have been researching 3d plasmas for about 3 months.

Good black levels, decent ability to handle non HD sources, and very good color on 1080 sources. It was unfortunately stolen in a burglary 2 weeks ago so we found ourselves back on the market for a TV. We briefly looked at the LCD/LED sets essentially to confirm that motion is still an issue on many of them and that they still have that eye popping, yet somehow hyperreal image quality. We researched the Panasonic and the Samsung plasmas. Consumer Reports gives Samsung the edge (on the models they tested). Crutchfield stopped carrying Panasonic and raves about Samsung's quality improvements. CNET sees strengths and weaknesses in both, fretting about last years 2009 Panasonics' rapidly diminishing black levels and possible \"motion issues\" with the Samsungs.With all that in mind, we visited the local retailers to see the 2010 models from each. Both manufacturers top of the line plasma sets are now 3D models. Not a big selling point for us, but we do want the best 2D image quality possible. The Panasonic models are the TCP50VT25 and the TCP50VT20. We evaluated these with a Planet Earth Blu Ray as well as the feeds in the stores. In Samsung, it came down to the Samsung PN50C8000 and the similar PN50C7000. The 8000 offers a different black level adjustment and motion dejudder adjustments.We were impressed by the Panasonics. A definite improvement over our 2008 model. Better blacks and a very clean image.But we decided on the Samsung PN508000C. The Black levels on this set are stunning! The anti-reflective screen is far superior to the Panasonic. It makes the blacks so \"present\" that the 2D images create incredible depth in the image. On the Panasonic's glossier glass screen, it still feels like you are looking through a window. On the Samsung, the window vanishes and the image pulls you in. We had some reflection issues with our previous Panasonic when viewing during the day. None with the Samsung. Off angle viewing, even far closer and wider than anyone would ever choose to sit are amazing on this set. I was a little concerned about possible motion problems (although we saw none in store viewing). There have been NONE.We have Direct TV, a roof antenna for local HD channels and a Sony Blu Ray player. Since its been home, we have watched The Hurt Locker, Up in the Air and Mongol in Blu Ray. A standard def copy of Fantastic Mr. Fox upconverted by the Sony. We also watched an episode of HBO's the Pacific, US Open Series Tennis and several Baseball games all in HD. Finally we watched Direct TV's poor non HD feed of the national PBS station.This set combines the bright \"pop\" of an LED/LCD set with the inky blacks plasma's are rightly famous for. Motion in the sports programming have been silky smooth. Battle scenes in the Pacific and the Hurt Locker were very convincing. The gorgeous scenery of the Asian Steppes in Mongol had a presence and vividness that everyone watching commented on. The Fantastic Mr. Fox looked so good, that if you had told me it was a Blu Ray disc, I would not have questioned it. This set has a ton of picture adjustment options which have allowed me to tweak the settings to match the various sources we watch. Even the PBS feed of Charlie Rose, a notably dark and hard to make pleasing image has been an improvement.Some posts talk about a buzzing noise on the Samsungs. We have ours hooked into a Monster Cable line conditioner and have heard none.I really liked our previous Panasonic Plasma. This Samsung plasma is a far superior set in all areas. The image on it has that \"wow factor\" we all experienced when we first saw an HD set demonstrating in the store.

I switched from LED to Plasma due to many good reviews on the new generation of plasma and the lower price. The choice was down to Panasonic & Samsung and I selected Samsung for their super thin high-tech design look, although a bit worry on many reviews that say there was a buzzing sound. When my Samsung PN50C8000 arrived, I am so pleased with the quality and after several weeks of enjoyment, I can happily confirm there is absolutely no buzzing sound on mine. The speakers are fairly good but you will definitely want a home system for watching movies. My only regret is that I should have ordered the 58\" plasma since the quality is so impressive and the picture is amazingly clear with life-like smooth pictures, much better than the LCD & LED that makes the picture look sharp & clear but flat. It looks so much like the picture you would expect in a movie theater!!! Even a boring talk show is now enjoyable to watch, I can see all those wrinkles on the talk show hosts. I also save a lot of money and got the free blu-ray player with the 3D start up package. I can not praise myself enough for buying this TV and everyone who have seen it agreed. Don't waste your money on LCD & LED and invest into a new 3D home system & a wireless lan adapter to enjoy this TV to its max, you need to get the newer 1.4v hdmi cables in order to enjoy the 3D feature. My nest TV will definitely be a Samsung Plasma again.Oh, and yes the 600Hz is better for 3D. When this TV set is off, it looks very elegant in the living room. I added LED light at the back of the TV stand and it is absolutely beautiful to look at during movie time at night with all the other lights off.Update on January 2011: It has been over 6 months now since I purchased this TV and it is still perfect with no buzz!", "Date": "August 27, 2010"}, {"Title": "The best 2D viewing (in a 3D body) at this time", "Author": "B.

The actual set itself is thin, a really nice warm gray color, and has a super sharp looking metal base. Its picture is absolutely phenomenal. Everything I threw at it looked spectacular-games, movies, 3D, everything. It suffers from some slight IR of course, but nothing that was even remotely distressing, even after only breaking in for 90+ hours. All that said, it's on a truck on its way back to Amazon.Why? It BUZZES. This is not some normal electronic hum. This is a distressingly annoying, high-pitched directional sound that's almost like enhanced tinnitus. With my surround going full-bore, there's no issue. During daytime watching, it's VERY hard to pick up. But at night, when the little lady goes to bed and I have to quiet things down a bit, anytime there is even a momentary lull in conversation or the soundtrack isn't thumping and bumping around me, it's there. Once you've heard this noise, it cannot be UNheard. It reverberates in your skull. I tried and tried to accustom my ear to the sound and block it out, because EVERYTHING else about this set is excellent, but I couldn't in good conscience force myself to discount this serious a flaw on an item I had just spent this much money on.It's a shame, but I can't recommend this to anyone.

I have 4 other LCD TVs. The reasons why I wanted to try out this Plasma TV was because of the price, high refresh rate, and 3D quality. The Plasma has any LED/LCD TV beat in all these catagories. And this TV is awesome...but get ready for a distinct buzzing noise that cannot be fixed. Your only option is to just turn the volume UP.I had two different Samsung technicians come to my house and tell me the exact same thing  \"I'm sorry sir, but this is just what these plasma TVs do\". They would not replace anything! They sat back in my chair that's about 10 feet away from my TV, we put the volume level on my normal listening level, and they both agreed that they can hear the buzzing noise. The buzzing noise can be heard very distinctly when you sit directly in front of the TV and are looking directly at the TV. When you sit to the side, the noise gets a little quieter. So this is obviously extremely annoying. And now Amazon will only offer me 80% of the current value if I return it. So now I'm trying to figure out if it's worth returning this and losing money...and then buying a more expensive LED TV in order to get rid of this horrible buzzing noise. I read other people's reviews about this buzzing noise, but they make it sound like this noise was really low and hard to hear. Maybe mine is louder than everybody elses, but it's very frustrating because a brand new 2010 HDTV should not make a buzzing noise...especially the top of the line Samsung. And now I'm hearing that Plasmas won't be manufactured anymore (this is what the Samsung told me). I wish I would've known this before I bought a Plasma.

No buyer's remorse.", "Author": "Daniel Cohen", "ReviewID": "R248SXNYU4DYW6", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This is my very first Amazon review. I feel that strongly about this purchase that I wanted to share my experience.Some background. This is an upgrade from a Sony 34\" CRT HDTV. I had that set for 6 years and it had a terrific picture. I've always maintained that a good hi-def tube set still looks better than any current Flat-Panel display. I still feel that way, but it was time to upgrade to a bigger (50+), more modern set. My living room (NYC apartment) is 10 feet wide, so the viewing distance is about 9 to 9.5 feet (taking into account the couch and the fact that I'm not wall mounting the set).I had already excluded LCD due to price (at 50\" and above), screen refresh rate, viewing angle, and a more \"film-like\" quality that I believe plasmas tend to have. I was fixated on Panasonic, as they are known for their plasma sets with excellent black levels, and I have several friends and family members who own a Panasonic plasma. I've always been impressed by the picture quality and a minimal \"digital\" look to their images.My first purchase was a 58\" plasma, the Panasonic TC-P58S2, and I got a great deal on it (1099 + tax). After setting it up, the first problem I noticed (and the ultimate reason for returning it) was that at a viewing distance of 9 feet, it was too easy to see grain and picture noise in the display, particularly with HD cable signals. Blu-ray movies looked fantastic at any distance, but overall, I felt this set was too large. Amazon guidelines indicate that 9 feet is acceptable for a 58\" set, but I feel that if you are going to get a set this large at this distance, it really needs to be top of the line (and the TC-P58S2 is a highly rated set) or you are going to notice noise in the picture. From a distance of 12 feet or more, that noise blurs away perfectly (as it should) and you see a excellent picture.I returned the set and decided that if I was going to go smaller to 50\", I should get a set that is rated at the top of its class. I am happy to report that the PN50C8000 is simply the best television I've ever seen at this size. I really can't undersell the quality of the picture on this set. Everything I watch looks fantastic. HD Cable broadcasts look terrific with no discernible grain. Blu-Rays looks stunning. 3D Blu-Rays look as good as I've seen on any 3D digitally-projected theater screen. The best way I can describe the picture quality is that it's truly film-like in appearance. The colors look fantastic and properly calibrated right out of the box (mostly using \"Movie\" mode for all viewing). The level of detail I can see on blu-ray movies still stuns me; It's almost unreal how sharp it is. This is what buying a set of this calibur is all about.A quick note about the intangibles. The aesthetic of the set is far superior to any Panasonic. It's very thin (1.4\") and it looks beautiful. The bezel is classy, stylish, and properly subtle as to not draw your eye's attention while watching the screen. The swivel base is definitely appreciated as well. I haven't used any calibration tools yet, but I'm glad this set has a plethora of tweaking options. I've turned off ALL the image processing features, which from everything I've read online, make the picture worse. Make sure to turn off the \"dejudder\" option in particular. I'm amazed Samsung keeps this on as a default out of the box. The 3D upscaling isn't really worth using, but true 3D blu-rays are a joy to watch.I'm sure some of you are concerned about buzz. All plasmas buzz, but I'm happy to report that the amount of buzz on this set is no more than I've heard with any other, and it's virtually inaudible at 9 feet away with normal sound levels. I was definitely worried about a buzz issue, as it's the kind of thing that would bother me if I could hear it even a little bit. In this case, the buzz is low enough that I never even think about it.The other possible concern is image retention. There is some image retention you will see after leaving a paused image on the screen for more then 15 minutes, but it quickly goes away after a few minutes of watching a moving picture.I am thrilled with this purchase. It's a beautiful set in all ways with a truly stunning, film-quality, super crisp picture. I have not had a single moment of regret about buying this model.That's about it.

Dahi", "ReviewID": "R22336J7OU018Y", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I was in the market for an LED-LCD TV last month and instead ended up buying this TV after being amazed by its picture quality at a local store. Later on I also checked Amazon reviews and found out that this TV is one of the two top favorite choices among people looking for Plasma TVs. Most other reviews are very helpful already so I just briefly talk about what I was concerned about before buying and what I think now:I was extremely concerned about image burn-in before I bought the TV -- hence planning to buy an LED TV originally. I followed every step I found out there on the Internet to make sure the first few hundred hours would go smoothly until the TV phosphors \"settle\". Needless to say, I ended up pausing my DVR on a screen with the intention of resuming it shortly, and then I forgot to do so! I was very upset with myself to see that I caused the TV to retain the image when I finally resumed after 1 hour. However, even at that early stage, it only took about half an hour to an hour of watching TV to wipe the retained shadows. Now after watching TV for more than a month, even in the worst cases of image retention, the \"scroll\" screen provided with this TV will wipe everything in a matter of 10-15 minutes. \"Image burn-in\" nevertheless may still occur but since I'm careful not to watch the same channel with a banner on the bottom or dark sides every day for a week or so, I'm not worried about that anymore. I'm finally starting to enjoy my TV rather than constantly being scared of the flaws.Some other notable things: Apps are good but there are so many options nowadays for Netflix and YouTube (like XBOX 360 console or most BD players) that I rarely use the TV's apps. Any App that requires user input is a pain because of the phone-like on-screen keyboard (2= ABC, 3= DEF, ...). The ability to download and update the TV's firmware over the Internet is superb and played a major part in my decision to buy this TV. Sound is decent, but I ran everything through my AV Receiver anyhow. Yes there is a humming sound and yes the TV gets warm but these are not deal breakers for me at all. 3D is the best out there (not the technology but the 600Hz refresh rate, which makes it much smoother and more tolerable than 240Hz LED TVs) but I didn't buy this TV because of its 3D capabilities, rather for the picture quality.The only thing I'm not quite sure if I like with this TV is that all the TV series that I love now look like Soap Operas! The picture is so clear and sharp -- and it may have something to do with the refresh rate as well -- that my favorite drama series don't feel the same way they used to; actors seem to \"jump out of the screen\" into the living room. This is true even with all edge and sharpness enhancements off.Bottom line: After a month of using this TV, I would buy this TV again and I would definitely recommend it to my friends.June 2011 Update---------------I have had the pleasure of using this TV for 8 months now. I followed the settings mentioned in a link under the first comment to this review and the picture quality is better than ever. Image retention is not a problem at all: I watch hours of old SD sitcoms from Netflix online, pause for half and hour or so, and then just use the scrolling feature and after about 5 minutes the screen looks clean and without dark spots. I have also watched 3D on Panasonic P50VT25 which is a pretty decent 3D TV but personally I prefer the colors on my Samsung better especially after calibration.

I read reviews from CNET to Amazon and then went to a bunch of stores just staring at TVs (not recommended..).  I am a huge fan of Samsung audio and video, having owned a LCD TV for years as well as myriad Samsung computer monitors.The truth is that this TV is BEAUTIFUL.  The colors are rich and dark.  All white screens display a definite lack of brightness and luminosity, but that's a plasma thing.  I quickly got used to this and was quickly completely taken by the picture.  The features are great, audio was great, I even liked the remote.So, why the 2 stars? within a WEEK, I noticed a faint greyish rectangle at the top of the screen.  It was worse over light colors, and most noticeable in \"eco\" mode, which is where we want to run this TV.  We did all of the manual diagnostics and finally went to Samsung.For the record, their customer service was great.  We got a response quickly, even though it was a bit of a dead end initially.My husband finally found the problem - it was image burn in (after a WEEK). The news channel he watches runs a bar at the top of the screen with their logo.  He watches that channel all day, as he works at home.  We ran the TV on Eco, with pixel shifting on.  We tried the burn in protection, not watching the channel, but the burn in persisted (although it did start to improve).In the mean time, we noticed a terrible popping noise coming out of our speakers when we watched the TV.  The pop was bad enough that I was concerned it was going to blow out our Bose speakers, not to mention that it was outright irritating.  Turns out this is a common problem with this TV (manufacturing defect).We finally decided that we couldn't deal with all of the TV's issues.  Even if we got rid of the burn in (it does go away, i guess), it would mean that my husband couldn't watch his news channel.  It also would require a ton of maintenance to keep it from happening again (running the burn in cleaner all the time).  Not to mention that the popping was becomming insane.  We ended up bringing the TV back to the store where we got it.  For the record, we did replace it with the 8000series LED LCD.While I realize that Plasma has some drawbacks, I find it rediculous that we pay that much for a TV then have to change our TV viewing habits to prevent it from getting damage.

However, with this feature off we did note some judder/jerky effects in side to side panning scenes - common with most all TVs due to difficulty in converting 3:2 pulldown.We were extremely impressed by the solid up conversion and accurate rendition of standard definition programming. We tested the C8000 with several standard definition sources which all revealed excellent processing and a superb picture.Brightness, contrast, color rendition and processing all appear superior to the lower end Samsung plasma TV models.3D TV Viewing: The C8000 and accompanying 3D glasses did a good job of pulling me further into the on screen images. It makes you feel more involved. I thought the picture presentation from the C8000 in 3D was very vibrant and accurate. I did not note out of focus areas near the edges of the screen as I did with the Panasonic VT25. There was some flashing effects from the 3D shutter glasses in situations where lamp light or window light interfered with the glasses' receiver.FEATURES RATING 96/100Internet: Samsung has expanded the Internet lineup on the PN50C8000 to include Yahoo!, Netflix, Blockbuster, twitter, Facebook, USA Today, Pandora, Napster, You Tube, Google Maps, Daily Motion, and Samsung Apps which gives options on gaming and sports and other material. This is an impressive list of Internet options for the C8000 series, probably the most complete in the marketplace. Samsung is adding new options at a faster rate than many TV manufacturers.Design and Appearance: The Samsung PN50C8000 is a beautiful TV with less than a 2\" framing bezel and with many design elements including a clear neck on the chrome swiveling table top stand, a matte dark charcoal metallic finish on the bezel frame, sleek 1.4\" depth, and a dark black/purple screen. The heavy and attractive accompanying stand swivels to 20 degrees. Samsung calls the bezel a Touch of Color Titanium.Reviewer Robert Wiley said about this plasma, \"let me be clear that I would absolutely buy this TV even if I had no intention of watching any 3D content.\"See the full review, picture settings and test results at Plasma TV Buying Guide or the Panasonic vs Samsung 3DTV Shootout at 3D TV Buying Guide", "Date": "August 19, 2010"}, {"Title": "Best Plasma TV for 2010", "Author": "Robert M. Downey", "ReviewID": "R4W0QQB8AM5O7", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I did extensive research on 2010 Plasma TV models, and it basically came down to the Panasonic P50VT25 vs the Samsung PN50C8000.While the Panasonic has slightly better black levels (indeed, it has the best black levels of *any* TV except the Pioneer Elite Kuro series), that's essentially the only real advantage the Panasonic has.The Samsung has a better overall picture once the TV has been calibrated. (See calibration settings below.) While the Panasonic has an out-of-the-box better picture (thanks to its THX mode), 10 minutes of tuning erased that advantage. Indeed, side by side comparisons of the two TVs clearly show an over-saturation on the Panasonic that simply isn't there on the Samsung.Esthetically, the Samsung is sleek (very thin at < 2\"), modern, and sexy. It is far more attractive than the Panasonic, imo.I personally don't care a whole lot about \"apps\", internet connectivity, or 3D - but with the exception of the 3D aspects (which I would say are nearly identical on the two sets), the Samsung wins these categories hands down.It's not all roses for the Samsung, however. The interface for entering text is maddening, and the TV seems to have trouble saving my \"user\" settings - which makes the text entry all the more frustrating since the 10 minutes spent entering Facebook account information is often lost.In addition, there appears to be a rare but obvious \"halo\" effect in certain images. I most often notice it when a person is walking across a scene with a series of solid colors - like if a person walks from a dark wall across a bright window. Artifacts appear around the outline of the person's body. It's rare enough so that the TV still gets 5 stars, but it's something to be aware of.Unlike other people, I don't appear to have any buzzing sounds - even when the TV is muted. The TV does, however, get warm. This is my first plasma, so I don't know if it's warmer than others - but it's warm.If you're in the market for a plasma, this is the one to have. I got mine from Crutchfield for $1900 shipped, and that came with 2 pairs of 3d glasses, a 19\" TV, a blueray player, and some misc guides/labels.For detailed calibration settings, see:[...]", "Date": "November 1, 2010"}, {"Title": "Best 3D TV for the price and features", "Author": "BMW74", "ReviewID": "R1XOP6K7VDP588", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I have owned the Samsung PN50C8000 for about 4 months now (July 2010), and I absolutely love it!  This is by far the best TV that I have ever own.  As always, there are Pros and Cons, which I will try to detail as close as possible:*PROS*-Excellent picture quality:  The picture quality for this TV is simply awesome.  CNET.com rated this one of the best 3D TVs for 2010, just a tad behind the Panasonic 3D TV in picture quality, but after reading many reviews, the difference may be neglible.  I saw both TVs side by side and I could not tell much difference in picture quality.-Power-options for TV calibration:  The TV comes with multiple options for TV calibration, including 10-point calibration scale.-3D picture:  3D image is awesome!  You gotta see it to believe it.-Upconvert 2D -> 3D: This is one of this TVs differentiating factors from the Panasonic.  2D to 3D conversion works \"decently\" well.  However, there is a discernible difference between native 3D content, and upconverted content, mostly that long term view of upconverted content may give you nausea or headaches, whereas native 3D content does not.  Nevertheless, the upconversion is fairly good, and you can certainly get the \"depth\" perception from an upconverted signal.-Slim factor: This TV is THIN for a plasma, a big plus in my book.  It looks like an LCD, and there are some LCDs out there that are even thicker than this TV.-HDMI Audio Return: Only one cable required if you have a 3D compatible audio receiver.*CONS*-Heat: This TV can generate some heat.  CNET.com ranks power consumption as low, and you can certainly feel the heat.-May have a Buzzing sound: Some earlier units came with a very discernible and annoying buzzing sound.  I got it the first time, got an exchange, and the second unit was buzz free.-No 3D glasses: You have to buy your glasses.  If you are buying this TV for 3D, then it will increase the cost for your 3D setupCONCLUSIONIn conclusion, this TV makes an excellent 2D TV, and the fact that is 3D compatible is an added bonus.  Whether you are looking to step into 3D TV, or just get an excellent 2D TV, you cannot go wrong with this TV.

Playing ps3/360 on this TV is an unforgettable experience. The 3D on this set is amazing nothing short of perfection. Unless your getting a full array LED TV which will cost you around $3400 I recommend going with this TV for $1650 oh did i mention the free 3D Blu-ray player + 3D glasses. I realize some people might have gotten a bad set as the case with many electronic items out there but I have not experienced any buzzing issues. Amazon has a very flexible return/exchange policy. I would highly recommend not to alter the picture settings and run everything in standard mode/avoid black bars until you break in the first 100hrs. I hate watching standard def now however, whenever I do I usually zoom in to fill up the screen. After that its smooth sailing. The picture quality on this set is unmatched no wonder CNET has this set on their NO 2 top TVs of the year list.  I love the remote and the apps rock on this TV.

After the set arrived, all my apprehensions were resolved.  I could not ask for anything more in a picture and while I had read some reviews that said you do not get any realistic 3-D effects with any 3-D TV (i.e. objects do not come out of the screen at you)I want to tell you that objects do come out of the screen at you and make you want to grab them.  I will admit that it is not as good as a movie theater, but I am not complaining.  At this point there is not much in the way of programming for 3-D, but hopefully that will change this Fall. Direct TV has one channel that runs continuous 3-D programming, but it is not live.Also, if you do have Direct TV, make sure that you have one of their later DVR's as all of them do not support 3-D  I have two DVR's and only one of them supports 3-D.I have the battery operated 3-D glasses as they were part of the Samsung promotion as well as the Blue Ray player.  The battery is suppose to be good for 50 hours of use and turn off automatically when you are done viewing 3-D images.  There is a button on the glasses to turn them on and the TV will flash a reminder to turn them on for 3-D viewing.  There was no alignment as I had read in some reviews as I just turned them on. I did experience a little eye fatigue after about an hour of 3-D programming, but it was nothing major.  The 3-D glasses slip easily over regular eye glasses and for those of us who wear glasses, it is no problem at all.The components hooked up easily but make sure you have the latest HDMI cables as I had an older one and it did not support the 3-D images from the blue ray player.Like most flat screens, the sound is only passable and I added surround sound which is the only way to watch 3-D programming anyway, not to mention movies, etc.", "Date": "August 29, 2010"}, {"Title": "Best plasma pn50c8000", "Author": "Rackum", "ReviewID": "R2U8K8RSIZ8ZSN", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Just got my tv no buzz great picture awesome 3D effect best plasma for the money working the tv thru my iPhone 4 app that is a great feature at the app store for free...", "Date": "July 31, 2010"}, {"Title": "Dynamic Picture but Mechanical and Technical Flaws in Manufacuturing", "Author": "Jason Rebelo", "ReviewID": "R12D2XOHDYIXB4", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "Bought this TV end of October after researching and determining that this was the best quality picture for the price hands down, only below the high end panasonic plasma. I hooked up the TV and used it for a few weeks and was blown away with picture quality with some exceptions in fast movement in certain scenes when it appeared distorted not sure what proper settings were to fix this but it was hardly noticeable so I was OK with it. One day to my dismay I found a dead pixel right in the middle of the screen! Totally noticeable as it was right dead center. I called up Amazon right away and had a replacement sent in November. The new TV I received did not have any dead pixels, however what it did have was the dreaded loud buzzing noise from the left rear of the TV. Really annoying and it actually hurts piercing your ears. At this point I contacted Samsung for service as I thought I was over return policy. The service company was HORRIBLE. I made an appointment for presidents day. They called and canceled due to weather, mind you it was about an inch of snow that dint even accumulate. Rescheduled for Weds. Tech called and said he would be by between 330 and 530. I said OK, I will be out of work at 430 and someone will be home to let you in if I'm not there. He shows up at 230!!! So I was not there while he made his diagnosis. He stated that buzzing was normal. I explained to him its not normal because the first Samsung I had with the dead pixel was not loud at all!! He didn't do anything for me at all. Unacceptable service and to top it off all my cables where switched around he left my satellite receiver unplugged. If you service something shouldn't you make sure everything is working as it was or in same condition before you leave?????? Worst experience ever!!! Needless to say, I called Amazon and they are now taking the TV back for a full refund! Thanks AMAZON for picking up the slack for this poor display of Samsung Support for a failing product with lots of defects off the assembly line. So it seems your gamble on buying this tv to not have any issues. If you got one of the good ones with no defects consider yourself lucky. I tried with two of them and no luck.

Lu \"William\"", "ReviewID": "R3VSFTUC4NV2CO", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "The TV that I bought is PS50C7700 which is the European model for PN50C8000. I originally was looking into the LCD version of this which is the UE40C7700 or 9000s. However, after discussing it with a few TV salesmen and researching on a few TV review sites, I've decided to get he PN50C8000/PL50c7700. I recently moved to the Netherlands, but I had been eyeing the Samsung 3D TVs for a while back when I was still living in Southern California. I have to say I am very satisfy with the purchase.I have read a few reviewers that prefer Panasonic plasma VT25 over the Samsung LCD 8000 series based of the performance of the 3D movies. Plasma works better with the 3D technology than the LCDs... if you tilt your head wearing the 3D glasses using the LCD TVs, the picture will get dimmer. But it doesn't do that on plasma. Even thought most reviewers are slightly more favorable toward Panasonic, unanimously the reviewers commented that Samsung TVs are far more superior in design while the picture quality of Panasonic TV may be slightly more superior.So before you buy this TV, make sure you know what a plasma TV entails: break-in period (which is around 100-200 hours I think) where you need to keep the TV in half of the brightness to prevent burn in images and during this period it is very likely the screen will retain images when you watch a lot of static images. Nevertheless, the technology for plasma tvs these days should prevent your plasma tvs from getting any burn-in images. So, don't get the burn-in images and retention images confused. Retention images will go away. Burn in doesn't... and it shouldn't be any problem anymore with the plasma technology these days. On the plus side, this TV (and plasma tvs in general) produces far more superior life-like images and is a lot faster than LCDs.As far as the buzzing noise goes, it goes with almost any TV, the brighter the screen is the more likely you hear a buzzing noise. I generally watch my TV in a dim room or with very little light, so Samsung PN50C8000 is perfect for me. My TV doesn't make a noticeable buzz noise. My PS3 makes a louder noise than my TV.The 3D works amazing on this TV. It also has the capability to turn 2D movies and make it into 3D (although it isn't nearly as good as an actual 3D movie). When I bought this TV, there was a special deal. I ended up getting 3 free pairs of 3D glasses and 4 3D movies. How To Train Your Dragon looks awesome in 3D.The USB plugs work great. I've been using USB flash drives to watch tons of my downloaded movies and tv shows. It is also very easy to update the firmware on this TV because it's connected to the internet. You can do it wirelessly with an additional wireless USB plug, but I just hooked mine up with an ethernet cable.Occasionally I can see a bit of image retention on the screen, but it goes away. And it's getting less and less visible as I have this TV longer. I'm very happy with my purchase. It may be the best thing I bought myself in 2010. Blu-ray movies look fantastic on this screen. I highly recommend watching 'The Fall' blu-ray on this TV.PROS:chic designultra slim, so it looks great on the wall or on top of a tv standclear life-like imagesgreat 3D picture quality (better than the LCD counter part)the 3D glasses are much better than the ones from other brands like panasonic and sonyExcellent black-level performanceaccurate color overallproperly handles 1080p/24 sourcesexcellent bright-room image for a plasmanumerous picture controls and tweaksgreat streaming and widget content via well-integrated Apps platformway more affordable than other 3D TVsCons:break in periodimage retention (not a big issue for me)1080p/24 mode causes a bit loss in black level performancemay not be as vibrant as LED tvs", "Date": "January 24, 2011"}, {"Title": "Samsung \"Screwed Up\"", "Author": "Frustrated", "ReviewID": "RJMG5AZD2G749", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "This TV is beautiful.  I do not experience any buzzing, but the TV has its quirks.  To the fellow who could not get the \"red\" and \"white\" audio outputs to work, please get a pair of glasses as these are audio inputs--the audio outputs are via the stereo mini-plug.My biggest frustration was assembling the TV's stand.  It has to be positioned exactly flush to the TV or the TV will sag forward.  Five self-tapping screws and five 4x12 metric MACHINE SCREWS are required, the former to assemble the stand and the latter to fasten the stand to the TV.  Toshiba provided ten self-tapping screws!  Fortunately, when I attempted to attach the stand to the TV I did not attempt to force-torque the screws in when they got stuck.  I did have to go to a hardware store, however,to buy the correct screws.  I called Samsung about the problem and they claimed they had never heard of it (the instructions that come with the stand in the TV box didn't help and specified all the screws as the same).  I wonder how many TVs Samsung has had to either field service or replace when buyers attempt to fasten the stand to the TV with the provided self-tapping screws and break them off in the mounting holes or strip them!The power cord does detach--after a fashion--but it is a big pain as it is not a standard connector (I thought standard IEC connectors were required by law).I'm still adjusting and evaluation the set, but buyer beware, if you use the supplied stand, make sure you attach it to the TV with the right screws!

If you have not done it before, it would be impossible to do becuase there are roughly one hundred video settings. I did not want to pay a few hundred dollars for a pro to do it. Instead, I used one of the recommended settings given in an Amazon review and make some minor tweaking. The result: amazing picture.

When the TV arrived it was brought into the house (still boxed) by the Amazon delivery company.  After I opened and set it up I noticed that there was a thin black horizontal line all the way across the screen a couple inches from the top of the set (not the 16/9 line, but a defect line).  Since it was delivered Thanksgiving week I didn't feel like dealing with it so I called Amazon the day after Thanksgiving.  I expected a long wait followed by an unpleasant conversation that I figured would end with me telling them to come get the TV and I'd just return it with the free return shipping option.After I explained the line defect to the employee, and told her that it was this way from the moment I opened it, I just didn't feel like dealing with it until after Thanksgiving, she said, and here's where I expected the fight to start, \"You have two options: 1st I can send the delivery company to come pick it up and issue you a full refund or, 2nd, I can send the delivery company to come pick it up and replace it with another one at the same time.  Which would you prefer?\"  Amazon made the exchange easy and completely painless!  I asked for the exchange and the next Tuesday the swap took place - and remember my call was placed on Black Friday.  Thank you Amazon!The TV itself is great.  I haven't done any of the tweaking for optimum picture noted in prior reviews, but I love the picture quality.  The user interfaces (both the remote and the on-screen) are easy to understand and use.  One earlier reviewer noted that there were no controls on the TV itself so the remote always had to be used.  There are actually \"watermark\" type (i.e. very faintly outlined) controls on the lower right of the TV on the clear plastic edge that goes around the set.  While not really functional for routine use, it does make it easy to turn the set off after the kids leave it on and I don't feel like looking for the remote just to turn it off.Some other reviewers noted a buzzing/hum when the set was turned on.  I haven't experienced it.  Neither of the two sets I hooked up had it.  BUT, I took someone else's advise and bought a power \"cleaner\" to connect all my new equipment through.  While the reviews on the power cleaners range from \"power cleaners are absolutely essential\" to \"this is complete BS\" I figured that I needed a good surge protector anyway and for a couple of bucks more, I would give it a try.  Does it really work, I don't know.  Do I have the buzz/hum that several people complain about, nope.The sound on the set is standard TV set quality sound.  In other words it isn't anything like what it is run through an entertainment center.  But then again, it isn't run through an entertainment center.  My family watches all sorts of movies and TV shows with the TV's native sound system and no one has complained once.  It is perfectly fine.  I think some people expect a theater sound experience, that's not the case.  I bought this TV for the theater visual experience, which it delivers!Overall, the TV is amazing.

Even the bezel is gorgeous, it is so subtle that you don't notice the TV so much when it is off and the bezel disappears when it is on because it is matte.The \"widgets\" are a bit confusing, it would be much better if there weren't a differentiation between the Yahoo widgets and the other widgets.  I use a Roku, so the widgets aren't that important to me.This TV is prone to burn-in, more so than on the Panasonic G25 that I had first.  You really cannot leave a bright static image on the screen for more than 5 - 10 minutes without getting some degree of burn-in.  Mine occasionally gets the Netflix home interface burnt in or the pause bar from the Time Warner DVR.  To me the compromise is worth it, since the picture is so much better than LCDs.  I run the scrolling bars once a week or more and it takes care of the problem, but I don't watch news shows with tickers.And, have I mentioned that there is NO BUZZ?", "Date": "November 14, 2010"}, {"Title": "AWESOME TV!!!!!!!", "Author": "David A Brown", "ReviewID": "R331E5RII2W6ZX", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I've had this T.V. for about 3 weeks now and all I can say is AWESOME!!

Of course I was between LCD/LED Full Array and edge lit. I was waiting for the Sony 909 to come out until I made my decision. I looked at the Samsung's 8000/9000 etc. I wasn't big on 3D but if it had, so be it. No Doubt, the Samsung 9000 is an awesome set for 2D but 3D, no so much and for the price tag WOW. I also looked at Shard/Toshiba/LG all had good points but not the TOTAL PACKAGE. Then came along the Panasonic vt25 PLASMA. I have never been a real big plasma guy, but because of the reviews I decided to take a look at it. Great picture, No Doubt, but the design was such a disappointed. I am hanging this HDTV on my wall and the wife would not want this thick huge set hanging on the wall. So I was convince Samsung LED or Sony 909 when it cam out was the direction that I was going to go. Then I happened upon Samsung pnc 8000, Holy crap.....Awesome 2D....Awesome 3d and as thin as a LED/LCD and OMG CHEAP CHEAP CHEAP. I got it from Electronic Expo for 1700.00 with 3D starter kit. The reviews on this set are awesome...one negative thing that I read was about a Buzzing sound from the set. I hear absolutely no buzzing sound, it might be due to the plug change on the set. The plug is huge so caution when running it through walls. Watching Dave Matthew's/Tim Reynolds Bluray is unbelievable almost moving. 3D is just as good if not better then the Panasonic VT25.

I bought this TV 9 months ago and was super careful about pausing it, etc...It \"ghosted\" immediately. ALL the time. I mean ALL THE TIME! Not when I paused it... just when I was watching TV or a movie.OK, fine. It needed to \"break in.\" I ran the scrolling feature a LOT, I lowered the contrast, yadda yadda yadda.About 2 months ago, I noticed that there was ghosting of Pandora (which I listen to all the time as it came with the TV) boxes on the screen. And it wasn't going away. I ran the scrolling feature like mad. No dice. It's there permanently. I particularly notice it when the TV screen is playing a nighttime scene or when it's very bright. It takes up the entire screen and is very distracting. Also, 9 months later, it still ghosts various things.I can't even begin to tell you how bummed I am by this! I've never had it on one screen for more than 10 minutes because I was so paranoid about this very thing happening.The other thing that happened is the audio out where I plugged in my headphones is now broken, and apparently I have to get a guy out here to fix it. I don't even know how it broke! Both the issues are not covered under the warranty. I've been trying to figure out a workaround (digital optical audio out to a converter to my headphones... nope. Didn't work)So, I saved and saved for an \"awesome\" 50 inch TV... for this piece of crap.On the other hand, I never heard the buzzing people mentioned in the reviews. So there's that. I mostly use it as a very expensive audio system for Pandora now. I hate watching anything on it.UPDATE: After owning this TV for 1 year & 1 month, the screen went black for no apparent reason. I took it in to a repair shop and they said the whole panel needed to be replaced. That would cost only a little bit less than to re-buy new. It's going into the dumpster.I emailed Samsung and they said there's nothing they could/would do because the warranty expired ONE MONTH AGO! One of the most expensive mistakes I've ever made.I realized that I always felt stressed about using this TV. Every time I paused it, I would race around (to the bathroom, kitchen, whatever) to do whatever I had to do as fast as I could because I was so afraid of MORE burn-in. Right now, we're using our backup 32\" LCD TV, and \"poof!\" the stress is gone!

Lai \"Mandarin\"", "ReviewID": "R1J9DJ212H28RT", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Purchase date: Dec.31 2010. Full array of tweaks, apps, widgets, and features: If you are the type of person who like to \"play with numerous controls\" in order to customize your television experience the way that \"you want\", this TV will equal paradise to you!... Most users won't use all the features, but it's nice to have them. For example, who will really use 3 sets of \" on/off \" timers, on top of a sleep timer?... or have a message on your tv screen when you receive a text message on your cel phone? Plasma displays typically offer beyond any doubt the best, most pleasing and realistic picture, from all angles: this TV is no exception! The color accuracy, deep blacks, and image definition are so amazing on this Samsung TV that your favorite pet may want to jump into the tv! Movies on this set are just breathtaking!.I like its contemporary design, and the TV is a lot thinner than its direct competitor, Panasonic's flagship model. The PN50C8000 remote control is a continuation of the unit's design and is not your regular \"Fisher Price\" big rubber button remote; so I disagree with CNET's opinion by a mile. I also disagree with CNET's review and ranking when comparing Samsung's flagship model to the Panasonic's. The only advantage noted by CNET was the black level scientifically measured on the Panasonic VT25, which won the contest by a hair over Samsung. However, Panasonic's black level decreases over time according to... Panasonic. Furthermore, Panasonic's tasteless \"Ford Escort\" inspired design is at the antipodes of the contemporary lines of Samsung's flagship model. Panasonic's app interface looks like a game of Pong straight form the 1980's rather than the nice well organized app screen found on the Samsung, which by the way also offers the greatest number of apps of any tv. The PN50C8000 is not shy about its black... it offers about 5 different levels of black that you can set to your liking... (yes, it does extremely deep blacks) I also have to mention that my model was manufactured at the end of 2010, so it has a darker plasma screen than the same model on display at Best Buy. That is probably why Amazon adds \"(BLACK)\" at the end of the model's number. This tv also came with the latest software version, so I did not even need to update it! This is also probably why some previous bugs are no longer present...Plasma TV's consume slightly more energy than same size LED's. but on average, and with normal settings, we're talking about 75-100W more than LED's, so around 200W total, depending on settings and the image being displayed. However, that will certainly not intimidate anyone who wants to add a 800-1000W home theater sound system to complement his/her purchase, or use a 1100W microwave to make popcorn... Give me a break!As far as the buzzing goes, I only heard a low buzzing sound for a very short time. After turning the TV slightly on its stand, it then stopped and I never heard it again. There is however a note in the user manual that a buzz may be heard at over 6500ft of altitude (if you live at that elevation). In any case, one should definitely use a power surge with line conditioner to control possible interference, especially with any TV in this size and price range! Samsung also includes a \"ferrite\" that  one can attach / clip to the power cord to control/avoid interference. I did not personally experience any image retention so far, under normal, responsible but \"not over-paranoid\" viewing conditions. If you do watch CNN for hours however, I suspect that it would be wiser to purchase a LED TV's instead. Samsung warns users about static images being displayed for long periods on this type of screen (not covered by the warranty) causing what is called \"burned in\" images. But, guess what, there is also 2 separate functions on this TV in order to prevent this from happening; a swipe that can be run for a few minutes to \"erase\" image retention, and a pixel rotating function which is \"on\" by default.Hope this has been helpful. It's all a matter of common sense, and taste of course. The user manual is a free download from Samsung's website if one wants to go over all the specs before buying. At about $1600 on Amazon (MSRP: $2,299) including a blu-ray player, 3D movies, and 2 pairs of 3D glasses, it's a real deal!

I contacted Samsung customer services via live chat at their website.  They denied the dead pixels were a known problem although other purchasers stated they were aware of it.  Samsung said we would have to either schedule service and pay for it or live with it.  We decided to try to live with it but just a few days ago, we got another black line approximately an inch below the first one...another row of dead pixels. Once again, we tried live chat on the Samsung website but to no avail. They said it's out of warranty, we're sorry but you have to pay to get it fixed.  I have never owned a television before that had such a serious problem this soon. We told Samsung we would never purchase another Samsung product and we won't.  A few years ago, the Sony TV we owned immediately before the Samsung, had a problem with the screen that was widely known and acknowledged by the company.

Its got a beautiful display. I gave it only 4 stars because there are a few minor problems with samsung plasma televisions. The first would be the slight image retention that you get when you have a still image on the television for only a few minutes, which makes me scared that there will be burn in if anything was left longer. The second problem is that the television is a \"buzzer\", which samsung plasmas are known for. You can't really hear the buzzing when the sound is on though, so I don't mind as much, but its still a bit annoying that its there. The third problem is that the tv lacks a better menu, in my opinion it doesn't feel like there is very much customization that you can do.Overall however, the t.v. is still great and have a beautiful design. The 3D is okay, but its not a reason I bought the tv. Theres still a part of me that wishes I bought the 8000 series led tv, but I did save a lot of money going plasma, and it has better picture quality than the LED 8000 series.", "Date": "November 3, 2010"}, {"Title": "Great TV, horrible delivery.", "Author": "Broktune", "ReviewID": "R2FRJBEBDK2TYT", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Unbelievable TV.  Great picture, watching football and baseball games right now is great.  The colors jump right out at you.  Blu Ray movies look incredible.  The 3d is pretty neat, but it wasn't my main reason for purchasing the TV.  You may have to fiddle with the setting to your liking.  I thought the picture looked great right out of the box, I only cancelled the motion blur thing.  It created this funky (kinda cool) effect where it almost made the picture look somewhat 3d with odd panning and scaling.  I have a 360 and PS3.  I had to go back and play older games because the TV brings it all to life with incredible clarity and detail.As for the delivery.  HORRIBLE.  They scheduled the delivery between 9:00 a.m  to 2:00 p.m.  At 3:30 no one showed up and I called the courier.  They were like \"Oh, ummm, yeah, we were busy, uh, you should get your TV at about 5:00.\"  I said \"Hey, thanks for no heads up letting me know you were going to be this late.\"  Well, the driver showed up at 5:00.....by himself.  He said he couldn't get the tv into the house alone so I needed to help him bring it up the stairs.  I helped him carry it up the stairs, he unpacked it and started to set it up and didn't know how to put it together.  He spent the whole time cussing under his breath and telling me how tired he was.  I just plugged in the TV to make sure it worked and sent him along his way, being pretty upset.  I wouldn't have been so angry if I had bought a toaster or vacuum cleaner, but when you drop a couple of grand on a product and they treat you like garbage, that stinks.So all, in all, great TV, horrible delivery.

This is the most expensive item I've purchased on Amazon and I actually have something useful to say.The Good:Amazing picture quality.  Definitely one of the best if not the best TV's available today (10/10/10) in terms of picture quality.I didn't really purchase for 3D, but watching Monsters vs Aliens in 3D on this TV was really amazing.  I was blown away on how well the 3D worked.  The 3D effect was amazing, though not perfect.  Some artifacts were noticeable, but overall better than I expected.I really like the Apps, especially Vudu.  The full quality Vudu movies are really amazing.  It's also nice to have so many choices; netflix, Amazon, Blockbuster, Vudu, Hudu Plus.  Youtube works as well, but personally I have not been able to log into my Youtube account from the TV.  I always get an error back.I really think this is a fantastic TV, for an excellent price, with all the bells and whistles, very pretty design and pretty thin.I have not had the buzzing issue that I have read so much about, but I was a bit surprised how much heat radiates forward from the TV. It's very noticeable if you walk by it, though I don't really think this is a big deal.  Unless it's in a small room (which is unlikely since it's a large TV) I can't see it heating the room up.The Bad:My biggest complaint about this TV is it's susceptibility to burn in.  I read so much about how burn in is less of an issue with Plasmas these days.  Not so for this TV.  It is amazing how quickly images will temporarily burn and how long they will stay around for.  This is my biggest complaint.The Really Bad:I purchased this TV for my family room in a house I just purchased.  I was having the family room remodeled and did not yet have HD enabled on my cable when I got this TV.  I figured I'd watch standard def on it until the TV got hung, the surround speakers went up and the room was ready.  Big mistake.  After watching solely standard def TV in a square box in the middle of the screen for 9 weeks two vertical lines burned into the set from the outline of the standard def picture box.  (Standard def does not fill the wide screen).  I was more than shocked and upset.  Nowhere in the manual does it mention anything about burn in possibilities from watching standard def shows set to the proper size, which will not fill the screen.  How was I supposed to predict this would happen?  Well I had a brand new TV with a permanent burn in.  I figured I didn't do anything wrong.  I just watched SD TV.  I called Samsung for warranty service.  Their response is that I used the TV improperly by watching SD TV on a set designed for HD TV.  Say what????  I asked them to show me where it said I can't do this in the manual.  The person I talked with was sympathetic and also agreed with me, but he said this was Samsung's policy.  I asked to speak to a manager and was transferred to a snotty gentleman who repeated that watching SD on a TV designed for HD was misuse and not covered by warranty.  I mean come on really I misused the TV by not upgrading my cable quickly enough?  What a bunch of jerks.The Really Really Good - AMAZON ROCKS!I called Amazon knowing that the 30 day Amazon warranty had expired, but I was so upset I had to tell someone.  I explained what happened and the person from Amazon 100% agreed with me and could not believe that was Samsung's response.  They waived the 30 day return policy for me, delivered a new TV and picked up the old one within 4 days.  I am a complete and 100% loyal Amazon customer now.  What great service.  On the other hand I will not be purchasing Samsung products in the future, though the TV quality is amazing.  I am now very paranoid about burn in and constantly run the anti-burn protection scrolling bars.  It's not a great feeling to always have to worry about your TV and simultaneously know how little I can depend on Samsung's warranty.Thanks again Amazon.Final Conclusion:Great TVTerrible Burn in issues.Terrible Samsung support and Warranty coverage", "Date": "October 13, 2010"}, {"Title": "Abe's of Maine delivered DOA Samsung PN50C8000", "Author": "deadlee", "ReviewID": "R2YJ2KC8Y9C8IR", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Abe's of Maine was very prompt in processing the order and getting the TV delivered to my house. That's where their customer service ended. When the box arrived I made sure that it had no damage and the delivery guy helped me pull it out of the box so we could physically inspect the TV's exterior. The TV looked mint with no signs of any damage or trauma. The delivery guy told me that he wasn't supposed to help me even setup the TV because the TV was to be delivered to the threshold and his responsibility ended there. I thanked him and signed the delivery form stating that the package arrived physically intact. I had to wait until my roommate got home to setup the TV beacause it required 2 people to pickup and install the TV onto the TV stand. It was about an hour later that we got it setup and plugged in. I pressed the power button and the TV did nothing. I tried unplugging the TV, using a different power socket, and using a different surge protector; all to no avail. I immediately called Abe's of Maine but I was greeted with a message that they closed early on Wednesday, Sept. 8 2010 and that they would be closed until Sunday Sept. 12, 2010. I waited and called them on the 12th of September and told them that the TV was DOA. I was told that Abe's of Maine was unable to do anything and that all product issues were to be referred directly to Samsung. I was shocked. I had just purchased a brand new TV from Abe's of Maine and it never worked. The customer service rep kept telling me that as per their return/exchange policy they did not exchange DOA TV's. This is very odd considering in that said return/exchange policy it states, \"If your television does arrive damaged please contact our customer service department immediately at 800-992-2237 ext. 2 so that we can arrange for a replacement to be shipped out.\" I would consider a TV that arrives DOA as damaged. I'm going to call them back on Monday and talk to a supervisor.I forgot to mention in my original review that Abe's of Maine also forgot to include my free wall mount. I called customer service on 12 September 2010 and Jason quickly took care of it and sent it out the next day.+++++UPDATE September 13, 2010+++++RATING CHANGED from a 1 star to 5 stars read below:I got a call from Jason from Abe's of Maine this afternoon. He was calling to confirm the shipment of the free wall mount and also to inquire about my TV. I told him that the first time I called Abe's of Maine I spoke to someone (can't remember his name) who basically told me that I had to deal with the issue through Samsung. I understand that the majority of anyone's impression of customer service comes from the individual that they are speaking to. When speaking to Jason he was very understanding and he didn't interrupt me while I was explaining the whole situation. He quickly offered a solution which satisfied Abe's of Maine and myself. I was very relieved that Jason choose to do the right thing and practice not only customer service but customer satisfaction. The next step of the process will be a scheduled visit by a Samsung technician to diagnose and repair the TV on Friday, September 17, 2010. I will continue to add updates until the conclusion of this experience.", "Date": "September 12, 2010"}, {"Title": "Don't order TVs through Amazon in December", "Author": "otclawson", "ReviewID": "R1CB3NOESX0SN2", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "We are loyal Amazon customers,but this was our first purchase of a large item that required scheduled shipping (read:  someone has to take off from work to be there for the delivery).

Two hours later, we received a call from the delivery company saying it would not be coming today, but perhaps in the next 24 hours.  According to the company, Amazon's tracking times posted online are different from when the item was actually received, so it is misleading.  The delivery driver also said they had a large number of TVs to be delivered in the 9-12 window.

I purchased the 3D HDTV, Blu-Ray and glasses bundle.  I made the mistake of damaging one pair of the 3D glasses while removing the battery cover and my experience with Samsung support and customer service was AWFUL.  The person I spoke with fumbled to get the necessary information from me only to put me on hold and ask someone what to do.  He came back on the phone and said sorry, since you caused the damage we will not replace them.  I tried to explain it was accidental and the difficulty I experienced opening the cover was partly to blame and my loyalty to Samsung but he just repeated himself and would do nothing to try and seek an exception for me.  I called the next day and the girl I spoke with seemed so bored, robotic and just wanted to get off the phone and take the next call.  I also sent emails expressing my position and frustration and amazingly received absolutely no response.  I'm so amazed Samsung is so apathetic and unwilling to provide any solution to help me replace the glasses.Another Amazon member has also written a negative response regarding Samsung customer care and support relating to color and design issues for this model and at the time I read it, I thought he was being petty.  Now I realize his frustration and comments are valid and I would seriously not recommend Samsung if service and support are a priority to you.  Read his experience posted here and compare it to mine and then draw your own conclusions.I've also noticed some idiosyncrasies with the picture that I did not experience with my previous Samsung, so naturally I'm watching these closley to rule out manufacturing defects.  I have no confidence I would be able to reach anyone knowledgeable or who cared to discuss my technical concerns.  I do have a careful eye and have been installing digital video for 9 years, but will reserve comment pending further observation.Five other purported consumers have rated this this HDTV five out of five stars and yet not one of these reviews purchased their TV's on Amazon and are Amazon verified purchase consumers.
