I like that you can view it pretty good from any angle.It was very easy to set up.We don't use it for video games or anything like that so can't say how it works for that.I would recommend this tv--nice exterior & good picture & easy to use--I don't need anything else.", "Date": "July 31, 2012"}, {"Title": "Panasonic VIERA TC-L32C5 32-Inch 720p 60Hz LCD TV", "Author": "John P.

I took off one star because it has no output for video.  I wanted to run the cable connection through  the dvd player and was not able to do so.  The other reason is because the directions and placement of the regular red, white and yellow input were unusual.  The red and white are normal, but the yellow does not go above them, but in the top output across.(The \"x's\" represent the input connections)X  < X  yellow on leftX  >  X  white - on rightX  >  X  red  - on rightIt has more features and better volume than a Toshiba of comparable size and price. It is also less expensive than Samsung or LG.  I'm using it in the bedroom and it fits the bill perfectly.

In my house I have a 47\" 1080p LG 3D LED tv (less than $1100 when it came out last year, thanks Amazon), a then $4,000 37\" 1080i LG lcd tv (yeah, they were THAT expensive when they first came out), a 23\" LG 720p lcd tv in my guest room, and now this puppy in my garage. Where does it stand as far as quality goes?I feel it rivals my 37\" LG! I can watch it very comfortably, heck we caught the Pacquiao/Marquez PPV fights, numerous other boxing and football matches. The tv looks fantastic, albeit with only a few quirks. On the Movie setting, some colors really stand out, mainly the reds, which seem to almost glow. I highly doubt most will notice this, but since I have those higher quality hdtvs, I really notice it. Still, it isn't to the point of annoyance. I could see where only having two hdmi inputs would annoy some, but after all, 2 is the current standard to budget tvs. One can easily remedy this by purchasing an hdmi splitter, as I have (you will see it once I upload my pic, it was a cheap one on Amazon, works fine). I have my U-Verse box and AppleTV 2nd gen connected to the splitter and into the 1st hdmi connection on the tv, so I technically can add 2 more inputs if needed. I also dislike the shiny frame, as one can see reflections which are rather distracting at times.All in all, I highly recommend this tv, especially if you can get a close deal to what I paid. I wouldn't want to pay more than $250-$260 for this, as for a few bucks more you can get something better. I'll load my pic onto the user submitted pics, between this 32\" Panasonic I got on an Amazon Black Friday week lightning deal, a Convenience Concepts 131020 3-tier stand I got on sale for less than $35 from here, and a refurbished Vizio soundbar also purchased through Amazon (Tiger Direct), I have an amazing system set up in my garage for under $250 that rivals most people's living room entertainment systems!

There is a bunch of them ranging from around $200 to up to over $400. This one price wise sits right in the middle, so we would expect it to be average in the bunch so I will grade it as such. Every bargain TV has similar picture quality so don't waste time trying to find an advantage there. Things that will change are TV depth, connection, extra hardware/software, and how pretty/ugly it looks from the front.The TV depth is pretty thick on this one, but you would be hard pressed to find a TV in the range that is not. Westinghouse does make a 32\" thinner TV at around 2' think that sells for sub $300, but I can not recommend a Westinghouse TV due my experiences with there bad quality. That being said this TV falls as we expect with a average size and therefore passes.The connection on this TV do not really disappoint me personally. I know people like to run everything with HDMI these days, but I couldn't honestly desire to hook up more that one maybe two devices to this TV. I see this device TV as useful in like a kids room, home gym, sports bar, etc. I would think this would be a good centerpiece for a living room with your bluray player, surround sound, PS3 and Wii connected to it. If that is what you want then look else where as this TV will not work for that. I do consider its connectivity average, although I know some other budget TVs were nice enough to throw a 3 HDMI on there enormous backsides.This TV, in my opinion does succeed in its availability of extra hardware/software. It does have the somewhat helpful game mode if that is your intended use. It also has a more usable usb than most budget TVs and does a good job of receiving photos, videos and music. It also has many eco features, but these I find less appealing. The worst is the auto dimming, which may save you $5 bucks a year, but is annoying. On expensive TVs these auto dimming features can work mostly unnoticed, but with these budget TV it seems to jump down or up in brightness and you find yourself adjusting your eyes to the new screen light. This can of course be turned off which I would recommend.  Overall above average here.This TV is not as attractive looking as you would expect a big brand to be. The budget Samsung and LG TVs look pretty decent in my opinion, but this one missed out. As the TV unit is visible whenever it is on or off I find this fact kind of disappointing.Overall why three stars? This TV is fine by all means, and a great price if you want a safer brand name budget TV. I don't know if you would want to spend the extra $50-100 to get a thinner better looking TV, but you may want to consider it for long term satisfaction. My personal preference, and the one I took was to spend almost $100 less and get a equally bulky and ugly budget TV from a less known brand. The savings there was why I can not give this average performing TV four stars.Cons over previous L32C3 model:Less speaker powerLarger BezelNo IPS panelPro over previous L32C3 modle:It is cheaper to make and therefore cheaper to purchase.", "Date": "May 5, 2012"}, {"Title": "Viewing size of picture difficult to adjust !", "Author": "Factation", "ReviewID": "RGE1SHZUQ8K2M", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Quality of picture for viewing, good.

The base is flimsy and must be screwed on to the TV.  The remote's loaded with buttons and not backlit. The blacks are quite poor and the screen only seems bright when directly facing the front of the TV.  Only 2 HDMI ports (this wasn't an issue for us but some may be upset). Worst of all, the speakers are extremely weak.  Not worth even the $250 we paid for it.Update (11/20/12): I took it back and dropped another $40 for a better TV - Vizio E320i-A0.  There's no reason to suffer for 6-7 years with a bedroom TV that has color and sound this bad.Update (11/27/12): No amount of video or sound adjustments would resolve the poor picture quality and sound quality on this TV.
