It is hidden under the System menu.  It is not split screen (disappointing!), where the two windows are equal size, and it is a single tuner, so you cannot easily watch two broadcast sources, but you can have (for instance) an exercise DVD playing in one window while someone else watches the news or a soap opera or a Football game.  Of course you can only hear the sound from one input at a time. I haven't tried using the antenna as an input or using the extra features of a Blu-Ray player as input, but I imagine there are other ways to finagle the inputs.I highly recommend registering your HDTV at the Samsung site, as they give you an extra 3 months of warranty for doing so.  If you think that is not significant, let me tell you MY story.  I had a 2010 Samsung PN50C680G5FXZA that I had purchased around Christmas of 2010. It started having problems with the power supply in January of 2012, which normally would have been out of warranty, but I had luckily registered the TV and received the extra 3 months of coverage!  Samsung first sent a repairman out to attempt to fix the problem.  He replaced a circuit board, but the problem persisted.  He then ordered more parts, but apparently Samsung has a policy that your repair should be completed within a certain period of time, so I called support and they preceded to investigate a refund or exchange.  I did bounce around a bit between the support staff, but with a little persistence, I was able to get an exchange for the 2012 model with equivalent (or better) features (They didn't have any 2011 models in stock.)  This is the HDTV I am reviewing.Needless to say, I am VERY happy with the end result of my Samsung support experience.Please don't forget to register for the extra three months of warranty coverage!!!I am a sole caregiver for my wife, who has Early Onset Alzheimer's and don't have time to write many reviews, so if you feel this one has been helpful, PLEASE consider voting for this review.Thank you,", "Date": "April 27, 2012"}, {"Title": "It is about the whole package.", "Author": "mclix", "ReviewID": "REUWVHVGYGZGC", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I spent months debating about this set, and the Panasonic ST50, driving myself utterly insane, and roaming several AV focused sites, such as HDTVtest, AVS, and AV. When not researching online, I would go out to several stores and demo the respective units myself. It was a long process, and in the end I pulled the trigger on this particular set. Yes, the Panasonic has the better black levels. That is the truth. However, only slightly. Some people may care about that slight improvement, some people may not. To me, personally, it was not enough. I needed an overall value that the Panasonic could not offer.The e6500 offers better input lag, motion handling, better output of non optimal HD sources such as from a cable provider or streaming applications, a better anti reflective filter, and bette color reproduction. Another selling point to me was also what most professional AV sites have observed: excellent resistance to Image retention. I have observed none. This is indeed a beautiful set. The picture quality is amazing, the Smart TV features are robust, and of course, the 60 inch size truly makes for an immersive experience. Even the design of the set itself is gorgeous with classy looks. The AR filter works great, and the set gets plenty bright with no visable reflections that can be a bane to plasma. What I will say is this - invest in a home theater system, or a home theater in a box, or even a sound bar. Why? The speakers are not very good. The sound output is too low, with not enough depth. I have to pump the volume up for this set. Besides, if you are investing in a 60 inch tv, might as well invest a decent sound system for it in my opinion.I just was not able to put up with the some of the issues plaguing the Panasonic model, which is excellent by the way. Issues such as stubborn image retention, vertical bands, and dirty screen effects. Not every one will experience those issues, as it seems to be a panel lottery, but I have read enough complaints about them in the past year to make me rethink my original choice. I also witnessed some of these issues in store, but not on the Samsung.Speaking of a lottery, yes it is true that some people may get a \"buzzer\". Some people get a loud one, some a faint one, and some none at all. I am happy to say that mine has no buzz at all. If you do get a \"buzzer\", Amazon has a great return and exchange policy. Just swap it out. Luckily, I will not have to do that.Again, the Samsung and Panasonic are both terrific sets. One cannot go wrong. It is a question of what you can live with and what you can live without.

However, during any bright scenes it emits an electronic buzz. This buzzing becomes incredibly loud while watching 3D content, audible even over fairly loud volumes. The 3D also has very noticeable crosstalk with high contrast areas, white text on a black background is nearly unreadable in 3D.

I'm VERY glad that I decided to spend a couple hundred extra dollars. There is barely any reflection on this screen and even if there is, it's faint and you can only see it when the screen is completely black. Picture quality is better than I expected, especially after calibrating the set. I had heard that the speakers were bad, so I paired this with the Sony HT-CT150 and I couldn't be happier. Perfect for my apartment. Blu-Ray looks AMAZING, and the 3D is really good. Streaming Netflix on the PS3 with X-High quality looks as close to Blu-Ray as you can possibly get without having the disc. I don't have the buzzing problem so many people complain about with Samsung Plasmas, although I can hear a faint buzzing if the TV is on with no sound and I'm standing right in front of it (directly in the center. can't hear it if I'm standing to the side which is odd). If you were going to get the 550, spend the extra money. It's worth itI'd also like to add that I don't know why Amazon says the 6500 doesn't have a swivel stand.

The primary reason I did was the CNET review that claims a slightly better picture in bright rooms. I have two windows to the side of the Samsung and I still get a great picture without \"distracting\" reflections during the day.  There are reflections, but I am not distracted by them when watching TV.  With the CNET settings I have found that the picture during the day is bright enough to comfortably watch content.  The Samsung is not as bright as a LCD or LED, but I find it to be plenty bright. As for features other than the great picture, I found connecting to my wifi to be a snap.  The TV connected immediately, updated the TV's firmware and apps and within minutes I was watching Youtube videos.  Although 3D is an afterthought for me, I found that the E6500 does a good job with it.  I was impressed with the little content I have watched so far. As far as the buzzing issues others have written about, I have not experienced any buzzing whatsoever. For what it's worth I did not use break-in slides for the first 150 hours of use and my son played Wii on my E6500 from day one.

Moreover, on a white background ( e.g snow, ice, or hockey game) the screen could not produce a uniform white color, there is a faint but noticeable magenta hue on white backgrounds in areas throughout the panel. During motion or panning left or right the panel exhibited what is known as 'dirty screen effect', it appears as if someone has taken their dirty hands and wiped them across the inner panel.I naively ignored other consumer complaints about Samsung plasma's buzzing and had to learn the hard way. One would think after four years of consumers complaining about Samsung Plasma TVs buzzing they would fix it by now. That being said, its also very disappointing and indicative of the quality of Samsung Plasma TV's when after three returns, not one TV had a clean and uniform screen. A White background should be white, not tints of red. There should not be hot spots where areas of the screen are brighter. The inner panel glass should be clean and smug free after applying the anti-reflective coat.Avoid this TV and Samsung TVs until they address these flaws, many of which have been reoccurring since 2008 ( i.e. buzzing noise).", "Date": "October 31, 2012"}, {"Title": "Excellent TV!", "Author": "sambel", "ReviewID": "R2G6TJCR93ADG4", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This is truly an excellent TV.  I've owned several HDTV's including the vaunted Pioneer Kuro KRP-500m.  This Samsung is by far my favorite.  The picture quality is fantastic.  I've been watching the Movie preset with no further adjustments.  Color is perfect.  Images are clean and sharp (but not overly sharp).  It makes other TV's I've owned look blurry.  Blacks are good, not great.  Regardless, I can't say enough about how good the picture is.  The design is top notch.  The brushed bezel and black stand look high end.  I briefly owned the E550 plasma and this one looks significantly nicer.  I have the TV in a very bright room.  Glare was a nightmare with the E550, but isn't a problem with the E6500.  Online services work well.  I downloaded the 3D demo app.  3D is very impressive, although mostly a gimmick as far as I'm concerned.  A quick note about buzz, yes this TV buzzes although not enough to be a problem.  I can't hear it at normal volume levels.  For comparison, the Kuro I owned drove me crazy because it was so loud.  I imagine room acoustics play a big part in how bad the problem is.  Maybe I'm just lucky, but I consider it a non-issue with this set.  Overall, I'm thrilled with this TV.  It's the 8th HDTV I've owned and it's definitely the best of the bunch (and that includes the Kuro).  Picture quality is virtually identical to the flagship E8000 for considerably less money.

So all in all it took me 10 minutes to get my tv up and running.I watched so many different things after I had all the hook ups and update completed me and my wife were truely amazed by the clarity, colors, and easy hook up.

Yes, I do have a slight buzz, but it doesn't bother me and I can't hear it over the normal volume of the sound system.However, I have some other issues which made me want to return it. Great amazon return service by the way, customer service is excellent as always.The issues I have are.1. HTPC connectivity via DVI - if you use a PC input and if it is anything other than HDMI output , then you have to set the pixel format to RGB, which, in this case, if your black level's are set to anything other than \"standard\" in the menu (mine was set to \"low\") the brightness of the TV increases automatically after a few minutes of watching TV and looks a bit washed out. This is fixed by setting it to \"standard\" and reducing your brightness to compensate for not being able use the \"low\" setting. Or by setting the pixel format to YCbCr on the video card if you have HDMI output.2. Distortion/Flicker on 1080p (this is a major issue/headache) - For some reason if I set my XBOX 360 or Panasonic BluRay player to 1080p , I get horizontal flickering lines towards to the right side of the screen , sometimes they pop-up towards the middle of the screen too. If I set the devices to 1080i, this issue goes away. I have changed power cords, used more expensive HDMI category 2 (high speed) cables, plugged only once device in at a time, but this still happens. I am going to talking more with Samsung tech support on this, as I need this resolved or a reason why this happens, since I plan to replace this TV with the same model exchange from Amazon if it can be narrowed down that it is a defect with this particular unitUpdate 12/29/2012 - updated from 3 starts to 4.The TV was replaced by Amazon. The second issue of the flickering screen or static lines appearing randomly on the screen for bluray and Xbox 360 @ 1080p (note, this doesn't happen if you set input type to PC) is now gone with the replacement TV. I actually returned the old one, planning to buy a different model thinking this is a model wide issue, but after doing ton of research, I couldn't find enough complaints to warrant this is a model wide issue, so I bought the same identical model 60\" again, and for my luck it was $100 cheaper on thanksgiving week. I just couldn't find a comparable model that had the same reviews of picture quality, features, and subtle but great looks. I am happy with the choice I made, the new TV doesn't seem to have any issues I can see, but I will run it a month or so and report back. I do have the slight buzzing, but again, that's just how plasma TVs work, and I can't hear it any louder than my refrigerator in my small apartment. I got no issue with that. I would give this five stars for picture quality, but I had to give 4 overall due to my opinion that Samsung is ruining a great TV with less than adequate quality control, and letting defective ones get out. These are big items, huge in size, it costs buyers time, even when shipping is free, to wait at home for these guys to come pick it up, pack it again, return, etc.", "Date": "November 6, 2012"}, {"Title": "Some hear the buzz, some don't.

I'm giving it two stars because although it seemed wonderful in most ways, we had to return it.We read about the buzz that some people experienced, but we thought we'd see if we got one that didn't.  I suspect, though, that they all buzz- people just vary in whether they can hear it.  I couldn't, really, and I would have been perfectly happy - but it drove my husband crazy.  It reminded him of the sound of old CRT computer monitors, especially early color ones, which had a high-pitched whine.  He said his ears were ringing for hours after watching a football game.  We used the TV every day for a week - it didn't get better.So we exchanged it for the Panasonic: http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00752VKBY/ref=ox_ya_os_product.  So far so good on that - those who do hear the buzz will do better with this one, it seems.A couple differences between the two:  there doesn't seem to be any keyboard readily available to use with the browser in the Samsung, which really limits its utility.  The Panasonic, it appears, works with Bluetooth keyboards that are available - but we haven't tried it yet.  The Panasonic also comes with Amazon Prime viewing, unlike the Samsung, but you can always get a Blu-ray player that has it, if you want Prime streaming on the Samsung.  The Samsung's pedestal pivots, which the Panasonic's doesn't, if that's important to you. The Panasonic sits about an inch lower on its stand than the Samsung does.

I did a ton of research on Plasma vs. LED/LCD, and really I chose plasma becase the lighting issues weren't that big of a concern, and having 600hz vs 240 was a big leap forward in terms of watching sports and playing video games, the two things I use the tv for the most. I think the TV really has been exceptional as far as picture quality - its really very clear and I think a very unique characteristic is that its glass pane is much less reflective of that of other Plasma tvs, namely the LG PA6500. I bought the LG because it was cheaper, but after viewing the Samsung could really tell the difference and went back to the Samsung even though it had a higher price.I'm very happy with this tv. I rarely use the 3D, but its certainly a feature that's nice to have and though the glasses they provide are cheap and flimsy, they do the job ok.All in all, I think this was one of my better purchases.

The fact that the price has not only not decreased but has gone up is a testament to how good the tv is. The only thing I would change is the stand and perhaps getting it in a larger size.Regarding the buzz, yes, if I stand close and listen there does appear to be a slight hum, but my dog, who is incredibly sensitive to odd noises, does not seem to even be aware of it.

The TV has had no buzz but I live in MD at about 76 miles above sea level and from my understanding this creates most of the issue. The picture is ridiculous. I previously owned a 1080p lcd from sony which always had good picture(especially on blu rays). I won't say it's like an upgrade from standard tv to hd tv but the picture difference between the my old 1080p lcd and this plasma is like going from 720p cable to 1080p bluray. The picture is just awesome. I used the Disney WOW to calibrate and just can't imagine the picture quality going up $100 or so better after professional calibration.  The apps run smooth 9 times out of 10 and the Netflix and Amazon prime pictures look very good. As stated in every other review the Plasmas don't look as great in the day light. The TV isn't reflective but the picture looks a little washed out (still awesome though especially golf for some reason). What I have learned from experience is the TV is only going to be as good as the source. The stuff in standard is noticeably lacking, that may be because the hd stuff has spoiled me but i know some tv's do a better job of making non HD stuff look a little cleaner.

All the family wants to be at our house for movie night, football games, and watching any kind of web streaming video.It's been nearly a month since we've bought this TV and immediately used the Digital Trends recommended settings after my 13-year old and I unboxed this beast and set it up. It stayed on it's stand for a week and then was finally moved to the wall. It's ultra thin, has a svelte trim piece, limitless viewing angle, and extremely vivid colors coupled with blacks so dark you may wonder if part of the TV is actually turned off. We nary have any blinds / real curtains in our living room or the surrounding kitchen and entryway so glare was actually the biggest concern prior to purchase. We ended up mounting it a foot above couch/sitting level on the wall and tilting it slightly down. That seemed to have done the trick because we don't really notice hardly any glare now. Part of the equation is that it is so bright however.In the box the included 3D glasses worked awesome (the content itself within Smart Hub seemed to buffer often however), the remote is lit and easy to maneuver, and you can set the settings up individually for each input which is cool. The only button on the set is actually the power button on the bottom left of the unit and actually pivots in case you try to use that button for navigating the menu as well, however painful that may be. Don't lose the remote. We did opt for a new URC WR7 remote (URC WR7 Universal Remote Control for up to 7 A/V Components with 4 Favorite Channel Buttons) that handles all of the interactivity besides the Smart Hub work for our cable box, TV, and soundbar.The Samsung Smart Hub is great as well.

My 8-year old was navigating family movies and photos within a few minute on our NAS. I was surprised there were as many apps within their store as their was actually. We tried a few games as well so that is a quick fun point to mention. Of note, we didn't use the built-in wireless because we have more bandwidth using our newer 802.11ac router (NETGEAR Wireless Router - AC 1750 Dual Band Gigabit (R6300)) downstairs and bridge (Linksys Wireless-AC Universal Media Connector (WUMC710)) that the TV itself is connected to along with our Xbox 360. We are awaiting our Skype camera (Samsung VG-STC2000 Skype TV Camera (2012 Models)) to use with the television's own Skype app to be delivered this week to plug directly into it's USB port.If you couple this television with a nice mount, some LED backlighting (LED Backlight Kit for 46\" to 57\" TV LCD Flatscreen (Wall Mount)), and a soundbar with a good sub (Polk Audio SurroundBar IHT 6000 Instant Home Theater (Black)) to cover your lows and you really do have an instant home theatre.

When watching content from the USB stick or through the network, using srt or similar subtitles, the TV firmware puts them in BRIGHT WHITE at the same location every time. There is no option to make them another color or less bright, to alleviate the problem.The current implementation of subtitles in the 'Not So Smart TVs' could be called 'Plasma Suicide'.Samsung says 'not covered, your tough luck'.The pixel scroll is useless (only 4 pixels is not enough, it just blurs the burned area a bit).The scrolling pattern that should make it better is like refinishing your floors - it will wear out every pixel a bit in hope of making them more similar in intensity (all lower).

I received the TV Friday afternoon. The white glove delivery was good, except only one person came. That is alright because I am a capable person and could help the guy.For the TV itself, out of the box, the picture is so-so. After consumer calibration (via AVS HD 709), the picture is absolutely stunning. I have never had a picture look as nice as the one on this TV (I've owned LED's and LCD's). The blacks are very deep and the white levels are great too.As far as reflections goes, when the TV is off, it basically looks like a mirror. I bought this TV for the real black pro filter, and it does not disappoint. I can watch the TV midday with my sliding doors at the side of the TV wide open.When I first got the TV and was adjusting the settings, I did put it on mute, and I noticed a slight buzzing, but it is not loud at all. My PS3 runs louder than the buzzing does on my TV, that is how little of an issue that is. When I'm watching anything, I don't even notice the buzzing at all.There is a slight lag to the menus, in which upgrading to the dual core e7000 would probably help in that aspect. It was bearable though and it did not take me long to get through all of the assortment of options to optimize the picture on this set.I saw very little cross talk in 3d, almost unnoticeable. I've watched several 3d films so far with my girlfriend. At times, we actually prefer 3d (2d to 3d conversion included) because the image just seems so crisp.I watched the NFL NFC Championship game on it this Sunday, and it was amazing as well.I would definitely recommend this TV to anyone looking for a good Plasma TV.", "Date": "January 22, 2013"}, {"Title": "Great picture, but really annoying buzz", "Author": "C.

After a few days my wife and I decided that we couldn't take it anymore.  We returned it and bought the Panasonic TC-p60st50.

Even so, PQ is subdued in the day time. Not bad or annoying but it is not at the awesome level it reaches in the dark. But if you cant control the light go LCD-LED.

One of the things I liked about this TV is that it has the anti-glare screen which works very well to eliminate glare, not unlike a mat screen on a LED TV would, though this TV also has a darker coating which helps to dampen the reflection of bright white objects in front of the TV. This TV also apparently has the same screen and black levels as the more expensive Samsung 8000 series, and with similar black levels to the Panasonic ST50 (2012) plasma models. The black levels look awesome in a dimly lit room, though in an absolutely dark room the black levels don't match the top of the line TVs, like the Panasonic plasma VT60 (2013) and ZT60 (2013) series.The Samsung 6500 3D (active) picture looks very good, and does give a clearer image than the passive 3D technology which is only 720p, or less, since it splits the image, whereas the active 3D image is 1080p. The only real downside with the active glasses is that they are battery operated glasses, though one can also buy rechargeable active glasses. This TV has a ton of settings and comes with a stand that swivels, 2 USB ports, as well as two sets of 3D active glasses. On some less expensive 3D TVs, like the LED LG3400, and LG5850 series, I noticed that they were very limited in their settings when in 3D mode as compared to when watching a DVD or Blu-ray, but on this TV one has a full array of settings from which to adjust the image no matter what format one is watching.This plasma TV also seems very quiet, and I can't hear anything like a buzzing unless I'm right up beside the TV. My blu-ray player actually makes more noise than this TV.

It arrived on time, the two fellows who brought it were very nice, putting it where it was to go, and basically just turned it on to make sure it turned on.  that's it.

After having this TV for 2 years, the screen made a pop sound and cracked while I was watching it. 2 quarter sized cracks in the bottom left. The picture went out and only the sound was working. I have found no recourse since. I've researched and researched, and researched some more and found many who had the same problem, but no one who made any progress with Samsung. The repair costs more than a new TV. This TV was rated at 40,000 hours under regular use conditions. I'd say these TV's are falling a little short. I don't even watch TV that much so I didn't 'over use' it. My frustration level is pretty high.update:Hello, today I spoke with customer service again and was told that because of the \"point of impact\" the crack on my screen was determined to be \"physical damage\". How can there be a \"point of impact\" when nothing impacted or struck the screen? The TV was wall mounted in my bedroom, the only thing ever pointed at it was the remote. I was told I have no recourse even though my research revealed heat expansion cracks are a very common problem for this TV. I am sorry to have to now disregard Samsung products as I am a loyal and long time customer but I cannot just take a 1000$ hit on one of your products. I feel I must replace it with a different manufacturer's product. I am also going to miss this TV as it was one of the best I ever viewed when it was working. It is a shame I could not get a better resolution in this matter...Regretably, Carmen S.", "Date": "October 22, 2012"}, {"Title": "2 bad pixels", "Author": "Benjamin Lesnak", "ReviewID": "RT6VGCVIF96S6", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I will write a longer review once my issue is resolved.  Powered it up, ran a few test patterns...two bad pixels towards the center of the screen.  I was hoping it was a dirt spec at first, but a closer look showed that one pixel had a \"v\" shaped black area towards the top and the pixel above it had weak output from one of the color bars.  So now all I see it the dark area caused by this.

Additionally, the screws for the stand, the \"active\" 3D goggles, the user manual, the warranty/safety card, and the cleaning cloth WERE ALL MISSING from this item!!! Furthermore, the packaging was damaged and upon finally taking off the plastic cover over the tv I noticed that there was a huge dent on the back left side of the tv.  Then, I called Amazong \"larger purchases\" customer service line who offered only to refund the money so I could ship a 60\" tv back to them, which I've been waiting weeks for...NO! So eventually the tv was discounted so I could then scavenge to find the parts on my own that were not included in the package.  This was an ok solution but I made this agreement before peeling off the entire packing and realizing the LARGE DENT in the back of the tv.  I'm so disappointed with Amazon. I will never recommend buying  a TV on Amazon...nothing but long waits and headaches...STAY AWAY!!!!", "Date": "January 8, 2013"}, {"Title": "Buyer Beware if Your Samsung Plasma Screen Fails", "Author": "Debra K. Corazzelli \"OSUDebbie\"", "ReviewID": "RZ654ZOOIWS52", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I have the older model of this TV, the Samsung PN58C6500TF. I bought it in July 2010 and it has fewer than 3000 hours on it. Several weeks ago I noticed bright purple bands across the screen when the picture was white or light. A quick search of the internet showed on several different websites that this is a common problem--hopefully they fixed it on this model. I called Samsung and they referred a local repair company to diagnose the problem ($85), and they said that I will have to replace the panel which comes out to $995 for parts and labor. Is it too much to ask of a \"quality\" plasma screen TV to last longer than 3000 hours and 2 years, especially when Samsung KNOWS this problem exists??  I've talked to 2 people at Samsung's Executive Customer Relations and they read from their script to inform me that it is not Samsung's responsibility to repair or replace it because the TV is outside of the warranty period.  So THIS is how you treat customers who pay $2000 for a TV with a known defect?  I am not going to put another $995 into this TV, when Samsung should be making their problems right. I guess I'm done with Samsung--the TV  had great reviews and initially had a great picture, but a TV that fails in 24 months from a known problem should be replaced by the manufacturer.  Obviously Samsung doesn't care about its customers.  If you really want Samsung over Panasonic or another top brand, make sure you pay extra for an extended warranty--don't expect anything from Samsung Service once they have your money.", "Date": "August 13, 2012"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "Unavailable", "Features": "Smart Content with Signature Services\nBuilt-in Wi-Fi\n600Hz Subfield Motion\nFull HD 2D and 3D\nTV with stand (Width x Height x Depth): 54.9-Inch x 36.3-Inch x 13.8-Inch, TV without stand (Width x Height x Depth): 54.9-Inch x 32.8-Inch x 2.2-Inch", "Name": "Samsung PN60E6500 60-Inch 1080p 600Hz 3D Slim Plasma HDTV (Black)", "ImgURL": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/31%2BXjd5OOfL._SX300_.jpg", "ProductID": "B0077T0TUS"}}
