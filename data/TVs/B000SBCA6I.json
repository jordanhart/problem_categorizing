I also have two Sharp Aquos LCD HDTVs and I believe this Sony has the best picture of any LCD I have seen yet.  The Amazon price for this is roughly $500 cheaper than Crutchfield.  Additionally after researching many of the other online merchants (many of whom are from the NY/NJ area), most had horrible reviews associated with scams where they try to lure you in with a cheaper price and then later upsell you elsewhere.  The Amazon price was slightly more than most of these so called scam sites, so I was a little concerned with who Amazon might use to supply/deliver the tv.  Amazon shipped this unit directly to me using Eagle Freight. I received a shipping confirmation within 24 hours of ordering the TV, and Eagle freight called me three days later to schedule a delivery time.  They delivered on a Saturday morning, and brought the tv inside my house and unpacked it where I told them to.  Since I was not ready for the tv in my upstairs master bedroom, I had them leave it in the living room.  I powered it up while they were there and verified the picture and that there was no bad pixels.  Once I was satisfied they had me sign for it and then they took all the boxes/packaging away with them.  The whole order and delivery period took 8 days. No headaches or hassles.  I have no complaints, am completely satisfied, and would not hesitate to order another tv directly from amazon in the future.", "Date": "October 12, 2007"}, {"Title": "I spent over a year researching HDTV's - and I love this one!", "Author": "Goldengate \"Goldengate\"", "ReviewID": "R3RI8ZAI1TR0OE", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I spent more than a year researching HDTV's and have been really pleased with this one, delivered in good shape by Amazon's white glove service.  The picture is bright, clear, and even on fast-moving images I don't notice blur or pixelation/tiling.  I had a list of issues/worries as I purchased this - here are my thoughts:LCD vs Plasma: I chose LCD as I have a bright room, I wanted to use less electricity (and create less heat) and I also didn't want to worry about \"burn in\" where the picture is burned into the plasma tube (the CNN logo is burned into my aging father's tube...shows you how much he watches CNN!)Sony vs Samsung: I chose Sony.  Great name, and seems like in general people are happiest with Sony's.  It's a premium brand and you pay a premium price.  I'm sure Samsung would have been fine, but if you're paying $1500-$2000 for a HDTV, why not rest assured you're watching the best?Non HDTV channels: I was worried about this - I had heard they don't look as good on these HDTV sets.  The non HDTV channels look great.  I'm very happy.46\" vs 42\": I was also concerned the 46\" might be too big.  It's not.  If you're deciding between the two, just get 46\" and be done with it.Price: I was also worried (see, lots of worries buying a TV!) that the price would go down right after I bought it.  I've been watching these Sonys for a year and the prices have always held pretty flat, at 12-16% off of MSRP.  This one is actually more expensive than when I bought it on Amazon before Christmas.Difficult remote:  Yes, another remote.  But I solved that problem by buying a Logitech Harmony remote, which controls everything, and sets all the inputs etc.  Very nice.Inputs:  This thing has tons of inputs, HDMI etc... handles my home theater setup well.The menu's on the TV are intuitive.... also the TV seems to switch to the  correct \"aspect ratio\" automatically, which I like.Overall, I am pleased with my purchase and keep asking myself \"Why didn't I buy one of these a YEAR AGO???\"Hope this helps.", "Date": "January 21, 2008"}, {"Title": "Incredible TV", "Author": "puppy's gal", "ReviewID": "R20O8YRF91MME7", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "We nearly bought the 52 inch but this 46 inch set is a little bit sharper in picture clarity so we bought this one.  It is a wonderful set with great color and crisp picture capability.  I don't rave about sound quality but I think this set and others like it are made for home theater which we do not have.  We have our basic cable channels in analog which surprisingly gets a pretty good picture although it is not crisp and stunningly clear like our High Definition channels are.  You feel like the people are in your living room with the unbelievably clear HD channels on.  The digital channels are so so.  Some are actually rather blurry.  You have to know this is a set made for HD and that is still a market that is growing.  I don't even think there is a network broadcasting in full 1080p yet although I may be mistaken.  If there is however this set is fully able to bring in the picture.  I find the remote easy to operate especially when compared to older Sony's.  I do not see any clouding on this set at all.  I was surprised to see there is no \"sharpness\"  adjuster as was present on older Sony sets.  Do not buy this set just for analog signals.  You want as many HD channels as you can get.  Hopefully the BluRay vs. HD DVD war will end soon so we can buy one of those and enjoy the full 1080p experience this set was made for.  The connections are easy to get to on the side and rear of the set.  The picture is best when viewed straight on but is easily seen from any side angle.  The set is really heavy so two people are really needed to lift it unless someone is especially strong.  Overall we LOVE this set and it is stunning, crisp and clear with HD, alright on digital and ok with analog but better than we thought it would be.  I highly recommend this set...best from Sony yet!", "Date": "November 12, 2007"}, {"Title": "Excellent color and brightness", "Author": "Sha_01 \"sha_01\"", "ReviewID": "R2C6F378ODGJ0N", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "We are really enjoying this TV since last 10 days, One of the best LCD ever seen from SONY after long time.

For the price, the little bit of extra money to get a Sony was worth it. It was super easy to set up and the HD channels are incredibly vibrant and sharp. The only complaints I have is the picture for regular cable channels is very fuzzy, and the sound quality is not nearly as good as my LCD Samsung TV. It's very hard to hear the dialogue even though I customized the sound to help this is as much as possible. I am going to hook it upto a Sony Bravia compatible home theatre system and see if that helps.

I researched flat panel tvs for quite awhile utitlizing, print as well as online resources. The picture quality for this tv is amazing. I was in a big chain store when I first noticed this tv. It was hands down the best picture out of the all the ones they had hanging on the wall. I was between the Sony V Series, and this one. I finally decided with the picture quality as well as the extra HDMI plug the increase in price was worth it. I have digital cable, and the standard signal that comes over is very clear although I do keep it in the box format to keep the clarity. The HD channels are amazing. I saw Lord of the Rings this weekend broadcast in HD, and was absolutely amazed at the picture differece. Also saw a lot of football, and the picture stayed clear, and I could see every blade of grass on the field. I was  alittle nervous buying such a an expensive item online, but the White Glove delivery service was adequate. They delivered, unboxed my television. Set it up so I could examine the picture. It was a smooth transaction, and I would not hesitate to use it again.", "Date": "December 16, 2007"}, {"Title": "Great name brand  Great price Great service", "Author": "James Kyle", "ReviewID": "R1RHK5PZCMGZEQ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "The Sony kdl w 3000 Is a great T.V. for a very good price.  Unless you are a absolute purest, I can see no reason to spend more for a brand name T. V.  Sure you can spend less, but for a brand you don't know who made or will service it.  The picture is great, the colors good, and the sound is satisfactory for the average living or recreation room.  In addition Amazons delivery service was very prompt. 5 days when they estimated 8, not a single dent or scrape on the box which would indicate rough handling while enroute.  Adjustments to the picture to suit your individual taste were very easy.  I dimmed the brightness about 20% to suite the location near a doorwall and to ease eyestrain and a few other minor settings which to me made everything seem more comfortable to the eye.  This was our promised gift to ourselves for this Christmas so of course I researched C. C. Wally, Best Buy looking at Samsung, Sanyo, LG and some of the smaller brands and decided to stick with Sony, and Amazons price was the best initally and even better when the no state sales tax was added in.

If you manage to get a bad Sony, boy I would be amazed.  This TV has a great picture, after some personal adjustments.  The sound is also great.  I do not personally use HDMI yet, but I do use component cables for the DVD player.  No need to go out and replace what is already working great.  I enjoy sitting down to watch this TV each night.  And, I too was one who could not decide between the W and the V series.  But when you are already spending that kind of money, I figured I would go ahead and spend the little extra.  It does give you a little more of an advance with the added features.Reviews, reviews, reviews.  All I read was reviews for days, trying to decide which TV to buy.  The Sony or Samsung 4665 series.  I admit, I did buy the Samsung first for the living room.  But you know, I just was not settled with that decision, so I went ahead and got the Sony too.  They are both Great TVs.  I can't say that I would tell you that one is actually better than the other.  The Samsung went out into my sunroom, and the Sony is now in the living room.  I will tell you that if you watch TV in a room where there is bright light, reflection can be annoying.  The Sony is matte, so it works better in that situation.  They are both beautiful TVs to look at.  But this is a Sony review, so I guess that is where I should focus.  So, to wrap this up, Sony, buy it.  You will not be sorry.I forgot to mention, the delivery was quick and a nice experience.  Eagle was not a problem for me.  The only trouble I had was making sure I got home in time for when the guy came to deliver.  I placed the order over the weekend, and that Thursday night, the TV was in my house.  The exact same applies for delivery of the Samsung.  The delivery guy was nice, opened the box and placed it where I wanted it.  He did not hang around while I hooked it up, but it was already late that evening so I would not expect that of him.  So as far as some of the horror stories that you might read about Eagle, it all depends on where you are, and who the driver is.  And Amazon, I could not find anyone who had a price as competitive as theirs with 'Free White Glove' delivery.  Plus they 'WILL' give you your credit if the TV drops in the first 30 days.  Just give them a call while the TV is at the lower price and you will get the credit, no questions asked.  Although, I was only lucky enough for this TV to drop one time, only $10.  And it is actually more now than it was when I purchased it.  But I would not guess that a Sony would drop much in price. So do your shopping around, but it will be hard to find a better deal.So buy it, sit back, and enjoy the Wonder of a Beautiful Sony picture.", "Date": "January 19, 2008"}, {"Title": "No regrets", "Author": "DC-Brooklyn", "ReviewID": "R201ZAAPVTMG5O", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I was deciding between this Sony and the Samsung 4671F 120HZ.  Based on viewing both side by side in a store, the Sony seemed to have more detail, especially in darker areas.  The Samsung is wider because of a wider bezel frame, which gives it an awkward look compared with the Sony. I've had no issue with motion blur on the Sony, and no problems with \"clouds\" or other picture defects that some have discussed.  Most picture settings seema bit dull, but the \"vivid\" setting is very good, and the set allows for customizing picture settings -- contrast, color intensity, sharpness, etc. -- to your taste.  One quirk might be TV related, or HDMI connection related -- sometimes there is no sounnd when the TV is turned on.  The problem is resolved simply by changing the channel.

I called Sony again, but apparently the burden is still completely mine to pay for repairs. Yes, I realize that my television is older than the one-year warranty, but I've researched this model online and apparently several others are having the same problem.I can't wait until Monday when I find out how much it will cost me to fix this problem.Again, it's a great television if/when it works, but I'm seriously reconsidering ever buying a Sony again if they only stand behind their products for 12 months.", "Date": "February 13, 2010"}, {"Title": "Excellent Product", "Author": "M.

Since we already have a niche, several recommended we buy a DLP so you'll get a bigger screen TV for the same or lower price.  When I went to the best buys and the like, I found that the DLP looks good if you are right in front but it does not have a good viewing angle.  I loved the look of plasma TVs but again since I wanted it in my family room, I was looking for something brighter.  I loved all the SONY's in the stores.  Amazon had a great deal on this TV, no taxes, free white glove delivery.  I saved nearly $600.  I am extremely happy with the HD channels and brightness of this TV in the family room.  The only con is for some channels where there is a lot of speed in the picture the TV acts like its catching up.  I was told the XBR with 120 Hertz is better in this regard.

The rating I have given is for the TV only.The Sony 46W3000 lives up to every expectation.  The colors and resolution are spectacular. I haven't found a flaw of any kind (I used to design television monitors for warbirds). Stated simply its a really nice piece.  No buyer regrets whatsoever.The 'White Glove' delivery was another matter. The delivery company called day before to indicate the set would be delivered between 12-5pm. So as the drill goes you rearrange your life and wait hoping the delivery will be sooner not later. I waited and waited. finally about 4:30p I received a call indicating that the delivery was running late. I had a concert to attend at 7p so the delivery was now becoming awkward. Truck showed up at 6:30p. Driver had a sprained ankle and was on a cane, had no helper.  Was barely able to help carry in the set.  Had my wife been home alone there would have been no way to bring the set in.  A jack strap in the truck used to hold the box in place had cut clear through the cardboard box.  Fortunately, no visible damage to the contents.  Driver and I unpacked the box and quickly tested the set with a portable dvd player. I thanked the driver and went to the concert. Arrived late got poor seating. From my experience..  Amazon needs to rethink their 'White Glove' DeliveryPS [added 6/09]: In October 08 [six months old] the set failed.

The whole reason for getting a high end HDTV is picture quality....and the W3000 has top notch picture quality!!!  So, I decided I would do just fine getting one myself and save the $800-1000.

I decided it was time to shop for an HDTV and had great success with Sony so I stuck with them. I did venture into looking at other brands but I always came back to the Sony brand name. Then I had to decided on which size and model? After much looking around and comparing and reading reviews I decided on the KDL-46W3000. For the size room I had I felt the 46\" TV would best fit and I'm happy with the choice. The features and connections this tv has is great great great!! I find myself sitting there just fooling around with all the settings seeing the difference the changes make which is fun. Don't get me wrong, it is very easy to set up and leave but I'm one to fool with all the settings. The picture quality in HD is awesome! even with the faster moving sports out there. Standard tv shows are pretty good and I was quite suprised with that. The sound is decent and with some fooling around with the settings you can make it sound quite good actually. The remote control in which they do not show here is simple to use and has a blue backlight which is nice when viewing in a dark room.When I bought this model I received the Sony DAV-IS10 Home Theater System free. I had my doubts with the sound from this system considering how small the speakers were but after I got it all hooked up I was amazed actually with how it sounded. Playing standard DVD's with the upconvert of this system is truely spectacular viewing. I'm quite happy with the whole set up and to get the Theater System for free was a great bonus!I know there are a lot of choices out there and it can get overwhelming when you walk into a store and see all these different models of LCD TV's but I feel you can't go wrong with this TV. It is a great TV and I'm enjoying it so much.....", "Date": "December 28, 2007"}, {"Title": "my life is complete", "Author": "ctrent", "ReviewID": "R1DUSQ1D10LKS7", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I don't have children, but I can't imagine loving them as much as I love this TV.

Installation is simple and set up is flawless.  Calibration is a bit more difficult (unless you pay for professional calibration).  Standard picture mode works well for most all programming.  SD programming looks best if the wide mode is left at normal.  Stretching SD programming is too distorting for my taste.  Though not a huge sports watcher, what football, baseball, hockey, soccer and golf the hubby and I have viewed as looked marvelous on this HDTV.  We've seen very minimal motion blur (mostly on SD DVD close-up moving head shots), no judder, no jaggies, no TBE.  We watch the 46W3000 anywhere from 2 feet to 8 feet away.  As long as the programming is HD, there is no concern on artifact or pixelation.  SD programming is best viewed from 6-8 feet away on.  All in all, the Sony KDL 46W3000 is an amazing HDTV and just perfect for HD/Blu-Ray.", "Date": "April 13, 2008"}, {"Title": "Awesome", "Author": "M.

There is\"extensive motion blur \" while watching movies. I tried watching casino royale and superman returns. the picture was so blurred in the opening bond chase sequence that i was utterly disappointed. i had read such issues only while watching football. but every movie that i watch has the same issue. All my connecting equipment is MONSTER cable and the most expensive ones. i realised my older panasonic was giving better picture. I called sony. tried all possible tweaks. i finally gave up and decided to return this TV. Meanwhile in just a few days i noticed some minimal clouding at the top edge of screen which was very visible while watching movies in 16:9 format.I have always been a Sony fan and though pricey , it has lived upto expectations.

I upgraded from a Sony Grand Wega 720p LCD projection set to this, and out of the box the first thing I noticed was how red everything looked.  I played with the tint, adjusted the individual color levels and enabled and tweaked every conceivable \"gimmick\" feature on the set, but just could not arrive at a setting that would show accurate flesh tones without distorting some other aspect of the display.  There was nothing defective with the set-- this is a well-known weakness with Sony televisions and in this particular model it was just too much for me to bear.I was also disappointed that the set yielded such poor contrast.  I'm not talking about the difference between black levels and white levels, but rather the more subtle variations on people's faces, clothing and other textures.  Again, I adjusted the sharpness, picture and brightness, and all the other \"gimmick\" features of the set (detail and edge enhancement) and was only able to make minimal improvement in this area.After having this set in my home for barely 24 hours, I packed it up, took it back to the retailer and exchanged for a 50\" 1080p Panasonic plasma set.

Kurtz", "ReviewID": "R28C3BME9S8JDE", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "Without a doubt, this Sony KDL46W3000 is the worst TV set I have ever owned. The picture, which I saw demonstrated in several stores on a HD link, is abysmal using any other input but HD. Surely Sony should have realized that only some broadcasts are in HD and most other sources of input are not. They could have compensated for those circumstances instead of letting the buyer suffer from a low quality picture.The sound is no better. It is muffled and unintelligible in many broadcasts, and the Sound Leveler circuit does not appear to make any difference. I thought I was finally done adjusting the sound level from loud commercials to soft movie scenes, and I expected the TV set to strike some kind of balance. It doesn't.Conclusion: Don't buy this TV set at any price. I paid $1847 and wish I had my money back. Based on reviews I have read of other Sony products (after I bought the TV), they no longer manufacture quality electronics. That's too bad.

Most incredible pictures I've seen.  I highly recommend if you spend the money on this kind of TV, you spend the money on a higher Directv or Cable package.  I bought the Directv basic pacakage at 29.99 that did not have HD channels and I felt as if I had wasted my money on such a great TV.
