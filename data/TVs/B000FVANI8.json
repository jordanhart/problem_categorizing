{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Non-existant warranty service at Akai", "Author": "Paul Connell", "ReviewID": "R1CXRXK172ZPPZ", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "The reason I gave this a one-star is that there's no check box with zero or minus ratings.I have a 42\" plasma Akai and have been waiting two months for a warranty repair, with no resolution in sight. The \"service\" number in the Akai manual connects you with seems not to be tech-support at all, but an answering service  in Ohio. (The corporate HQ is in California!) The \"associate\" who answers the phone tells you that, \"...they will pass your problem along.\" They also tell you not to expect any action for over a month because they have to do \"research\" on finding someone in your area to fix your TV. A month or more to look up \"TV repair\" in the phone book. Right!When you ask for a name of somebody who is empowered to make decisions at the company, you get the dodge, \"We're just an answering service.\" No phone numbers. No last names. They evidently got off the dime when, on the third phone call, I threatened legal action, after a month of being ignored. But I still can't talk to anyone at Akai to find out the problem or who's in charge. Zero, zero, zero in the feedback dept. Customer service at Akai borders on criminal negligence. Nobody is home.Six weeks after my first call, a local repair person called me and showed up a week later. Akai really must have done that \"research\", because he reflects their corporate culture--he doesn't return my phone calls. I suspect they just picked the cheapest service and now are dragging their feet on providing the part. But I don't know. He hasn't gotten back to me for over a week. But at least with him I can personally go to his physical location to find out what's going on.If you think you can solve this problem by getting an independent warranty, think again. Your contractor still has to deal with the coorporate black hole at Akai to get the part...", "Date": "January 28, 2007"}, {"Title": "Never buy Anything from Akai.

It took a month to get an authorized service center, another month for them to tell me it wasn't repairable now we are in Monthy 7 and still trying to get a commitment to getting a replacement TV shipped to me.  These guys are crooks.  Don't buy anything no matter with their logo on it no matter how great it might look.", "Date": "June 19, 2008"}, {"Title": "worst product ever", "Author": "Jose L.

Theriot", "ReviewID": "R1VLH4WKT504NN", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "Well the 42\" Plasma was great until 11 months later the picture went out and we only have sound.  I have been in contact with AKAI for warranty work and have been very dissatisfied.  I contacted them on the day it occurred and as of today, a month later, I still have a broken Television sitting in my living room with no plan of action.  I was told by two different customer service representatives that if a service center could not be found in 14 business days that I would be issued an RMA# and would be able to exchange it where I purchased it.  I called again last night (because no one has called, emailed, or any other form of communication) and was told that it was 30 business days?  Even though I have been pleased with the TV prior to it going out, I can't with good conscience recommend AKAI to others looking to purchase electronics.  I place great value in knowing that the company I purchase from has the integrity to stand by their product and will make things right when their product fails.  Akai has little value in this department thus far.", "Date": "January 9, 2008"}, {"Title": "WOW.....I had No Idea...and for Under a grand!", "Author": "J.
