I returned a  Samsung Plasma and exchanged it for this LCD LN40B500.  I originally bought a Samsung plasma because the salesman sold me on the \"better contrast, blacks, and refresh rates of plasmas.\" Yeah whatever, got it home and absolutely hated the picture quality compared to my previous 720P Samsung LCD.  When I saw this TV in a pre-black friday ad for $597 decided to give it a try.  Boy am I glad I did.  The picture is absolutely amazing.  I have watched many types of programs on it so far; movies, cartoons, sports, standard def, high def 1080i, upconverting DVD.  All have been more than satisfying and select 1080i channels on FIOS have been absolutely breathtaking visually.  Even though this is a 60 HZ model, I'm noticing no motion blur even in sporting events (this can be quite annoying in some \"budget\" LCD models) No worries, this set can easily handle quick pans and motion without even a hiccup, at least to my untrained eyes. (120 HZ models definitely look different, but to my eyes, different in a bad kind of artificial appearing way).  The audio is more than adequate for a reasonably sized room, with a little tweaking of the audio settings I have been watching TV without even firing up the Home Theater Receiver quite often.  The picture quality is absolutely stellar, I do recommend getting into the Picture Adjustment Menu though and adjusting the \"cell lighting\" to setting 5 or 6, as this is more than enough to light the screen, and substantially improves the image and contrast.  At this price point, they have cut back on the inputs (2 HDMI) and no inputs on the side, but that wasn't a deal breaker for me, I ran my FIOS through HDMI 1, DVD HDMI 2, and Wii through Component.  Hopefully Christmas will bring a BluRay player to see what the 1080P will do on this set.  I can't imagine the picture looking any better than it already does.  The cost to value ratio on this set is out of the ballpark.  (Paid twice this much for a 32 inch 720P Samsung 3 years ago).  As long as your cool with the limitted number of inputs and a 40 inch screen size, I wouldn't pass up this deal!", "Date": "November 22, 2009"}, {"Title": "Great value", "Author": "David I.

My Sony TV offers a few shades deeper (almost perfectly pure) black level, but this Samsung is almost there with deep/rich blacks.  If you are downgrading from a 120hz TV to the Samsung, you will notice the lack, but if you've only ever had a CRT or 60hz LCD I do not personally believe 120hz justifies a lot more money, but this is personal preference.  Speakers are comparable.  My Sony offers 8+ inputs including 4 HDMI, this Samsung only has 2 HDMI and 1 component/composite shared.I could go on an on making technical comparisons, but I think the most helpful info I can share is that, having lived with and loved my Sony W-Series for a few months (a mid to top of the line unit), this Samsung offers 80-90% of the black level, contrast, and beautifully sharp image at about 50% of the price.The low number of inputs is not an issue if you are aware of it beforehand.  I hooked my parents cable box up to the component, their DVD player to the HDMI 1, and the Roku HD player to HDMI 2.  If they get a blu-ray player, it will replace the DVD player on HDMI 1.", "Date": "December 26, 2009"}, {"Title": "Basic picture quality okay but not a bargain.", "Author": "D. Walton", "ReviewID": "R1J03JIAWL8ICN", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "The Samsung LN40B500 was marketed widely on Black Friday for $599.  Several retailers, however, claimed that it was a $899 TV that was being offered at this \"special\" $599 price, an incredible $300 savings.  So, I bought one and brought it home to replace my 32\" JVC LCD now destined for the bedroom.  When I went to hook it up it was immediately obvious that my various electronic components (games, VCR, DVD player, etc.)  that were connected to the JVC would not connect to the Samsung because there simply weren't enough connectors.  (a bigger TV should have more connectors, right?)  To my surprise, there were fewer connectors on the Samsung than I've ever seen on any LCD TV, especially one claiming to be a $900 set.  There is only 1 video connector, and that is shared with the one and only component input.  That means that if you are connecting an older set-top box and DVD player, you may be out-of-luck.  And, forget it if you want to plug in a camcorder with S-video because there is no S-video input.  To be clear, there's only one video input, and that can be either composite (yellow plug) or component (RGB plugs), but not both.  Most sets have a couple of A/V inputs and one or two component inputs that are separate.  There is no analog audio output, and no headphone jack (especially important for a hearing impaired person who doesn't want to disturb others with loud volume.)  With no analog audio output, there was no way to connect my sub-woofer.  If you want to connect video games, camcorders, VCRs, set top boxes, speakers, headphones--anything that doesn't have an HDMI plug--then you'll need to purchase an external selector box or home theater audio box that could run you an extra $60 to $500.  The two HDMI connectors on the set are just adequate.  Many retailers will try to sell you HDMI cables for $30 and up.  (I usually buy them online for about $6 and they work just fine.)  With no way to connect all of my gear, I just connected my antenna cable and had the TV up and running in no time.Out of the box, the picture quality of the LN40B500 was terrible.  The whites were blown out, and flesh tones had a plastic, artificial appearance.  The backlight setting was at max, so I reduced it, and also reduced the brightness.  I changed the dynamic contrast setting to minimum, and played around with the noise reduction settings.  After 15 minutes, I got the picture looking pretty good.  Surprisingly, none of the presets came close to providing this level of picture quality.The audio from the built in speakers was tolerable but somewhat tinny sounding.  Again, with no way to hook up a sub-woofer, you're stuck with this limited audio unless you purchase a more expensive home theater audio system.The remote control is very well laid out and easy to use.Samsung doesn't publish the power consumption specification of the LN40B500 on their website, nor is it published in the user manual provided with the set.  For the record, my set was listed at 180W (plate on rear) but I suspect that reducing the LCD backlight and brightness levels will lower consumption significantly.In summary, this is not what I would expect to see priced at $899 or $799 or even $699.  At a full retail price of $599 it's competitive with models from Toshiba, Vizio and others that have more features and connectors. But this Black Friday Price not really very special.  The TV can produce a good picture if you are willing to make the menu settings.  I would recommend this unit if you have basically nothing to hook up except a cable box or Blu-ray player.  For only $80 more, I purchased the Samsung LN40B550 which offers all of the connections I need (2 component/composite video, 4 HDMI, audio out, USB).  The basic B500 model is now with relatives who don't need the external connections.", "Date": "November 28, 2009"}, {"Title": "I really like it!!!!!", "Author": "J.

Sometimes I wonder if we're talking about the same thing. This Samsung is wonderful - but you should understand that it's the first HDTV for me and I didn't bring a lot of expectations to it. Times are tough. I'm retired, and I drive a ten year old car with 150,000 miles on the speedometer - not a Hummer. So you can see where I'm coming from.I bought this Samsung at a Walmart on Black Saturday at the doorbuster price of $[...]. When I got it home and out of the box it was easy to set up. The picture is *wow*. I don't have HD hooked up but honestly the picture is amazing and I don't think I need HD channels. You might think that too - the picture is that good. Almost spooky real.As far as the sound, it's good enough for a mid-sized room; although I know for people who need a theater experience this is not the set for you.

Shows", "ReviewID": "R25IAZW0WW53XJ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I wanted a HDTV during black Friday, so I got out the ads on Thursday and began looking.  I looked over many of the televisions, but I always seem to fall for Samsung or Vizio when it comes to LCD or LED HDTV's.  This occasion was no exception.  Now, some of the Sony Bravia's are beautiful too, but they tend to be a little expensive because of the name.  Nonetheless, I found myself liking the $600 deal that was available at Walmart with this model, so I made the final decision this TV.I haven't had much \"first hand\" experience with Plasma televisions, but of what I did experience, I liked Panasonic and Pioneer the most.  However, plasmas are good for dark rooms, but there really aren't that many people (as far as I know) who have very dark living (tv) rooms and no windows.  So, I tend to go with LCD. Here we go w/ specs:FORMAT:This model has the current 1.3b hdmi format, and so do almost all hdtvs, but there really isn't much of a difference between the a and b format (my opinion).LIGHTING:This TV is a CCFL display, which is understandable for the price, because LED-lit TV's tend to be more expensive. Basically, CCFL is fluorescent lighting, so you have bar-like lights behind the LCD crystals to light them up, whereas LED would have lots of little lights spread all across the back of the TV (local dimming) unless it's edge-lit (leds only on the edges of the tv to make the tv thinner).  This television is plenty bright enough after I had a look at the picture.PICTURE QUALITY:The quality of the picture, after I adjusted it, is fantastic!  I believe it's also because it's a Samsung.  But, you MUST adjust it in order for it not to look pretty \"run of the mill\".  All HDTV's are like this, and no matter how many thousands you pull out of your pocket, if you don't adjust the picture, your tv probably won't look as good as it could.  The default settings always seem to make the tv too bright, and the sharpness is usually up too high.  But, that's what you see when you go to the store to get one.  The tvs are all set to look \"bright\" and \"vivid\" so that it sells.  Now, I'm not a professional when it comes to adjusting picture quality, but I do know what I need to do to make it look good on the eyes.  This tv refreshes at 60 times a sec. (60hz refresh rate), and for some, that is a good thing.  If you start getting tvs at up to 180hz and 260hz, it begins to look a bit like \"plastic\" or \"fake\" to me, so 60hz is fine.1080p....highest picture quality available right now, but you can't really experience it until the cable providers decide to make the switch from 720p to 1080p, or if you've got a blu-ray player.ADJUSTING THE PICTURE:I did lots of research online, but just couldn't find any forums that have had the pros set this tv yet.  I finally decided that the best one to go with was the LN40B530. But, I still wasn't happy.  The picture looked too dark to me. Although, I do have a living room that tends to get pretty bright when the drapes are pulled back, so I decided to do the adjusting myself.  I did the settings based on 720p quality, so it may look somewhat different to you if you do it while watching something in 1080i or p.  Nevertheless, you can try the settings I found and made and choose which one you like the most or tweak it to how you like.  Here are the 2 sets of settings for your convenience.MINE:Mode: StandardBacklight: 8Contrast: 80Brightness: 49Sharpness: 50 or lower (find whatyou like)Color: 50Tint: G51/R49Black tone: offDyn Contr: MediumGamma: 0Color Space: NativeWhite Balance: DefaultFlesh Tone: 0Edge Enhancement: OnColor Tone: NormalSize: 16:9Digital NR: OffLN40B530 (set by pros)Mode: MovieBacklight: 4Contrast: 100Brightness: 37Sharpness: 0Color: 46Tint: G51/R49Black Tone: offDyn Contr: offGamma: -3Color Space: AutoWhite Balance: DefaultFlesh Tone: 0Edge Enhancement: offColor Tone: NormalSize: 16:9Digital NR: off-If you do have settings that you think are better, let me know.CONVENIENCE:There are buttons on the right side of the TV, which is fine, and works for me.  The lettering for what each button does is not extremely easy to see, but it's not a big deal.  The ports are all behind the TV, and on the right side, so it's better that it's not in the middle, but it's still somewhat inconvenient for me because I hang my TV's on the wall, and I have to feel around to find a port.  However, what really frustrates me is the lack of HDMI ports.  You get 2.  1st of all, you already have one taken up for cable.  Then, you have a dvd player, all of your gaming consoles, and anything else you'd like to hook in.  It's not just this tv I'm frustrated with, it's most tv's.  Why can't they add more HDMI ports?  I guess I should go out an buy a switcher.  Other ports include a cable out, optical cable output for audio, a VGA port, Audio line in, and your typical composite and component connections (red, white, yellow, blue, green, etc.).  Overall, the tv is pretty convenient aside from things I mentioned.Overall, I was very happy with this choice on a tv, and I would recommend this to anyone that is on a budget and looking for a great tv.

I bought a Samsung 46inch \"LN26A650\" (6 series) this summer. The only real spec difference between that and the current shipping 46inch 6 series model is the advertised contrat ratio. Also the 6 series used the same actual LCD panel as the series 7 so the picture quality is the same. With this said I should be able to give a good comparision between this unit and the upper middle of the Samsung units.The primary reason for my purchase is to put a TV / Monitor in my home office to retire a 24inch LCD monitor. I know 40 inches is overkill for me but I wanted to try it and see if I could live with size difference of the panel and quality difference between my existing 6 series and this new 5 series.THE LIGHT REVIEWBuild and outside looks are niceMenu / Controls / Remote look the same between models.Unit is real light at around 39 poundsTakes the standard 200x200 Vesa mount (for wall mounting)1-PC Monitor, 1-Component, 2 - HDMI inputs along with the standard SD connectionsWarrantee - 1 year parts / laborBlue Ray (side by side test using same Blue Ray player, cable and movie)Sadly there is a noticeable difference. My older 6 series has better color, better contrast, less pixilation and less blur with action than this 5 series unit.PC - MonitorAdain a noticeable difference in picture quality between the 2 sets. Its about on par with the differences in Blue Ray not horrible by any means its just the same.TV - Have not hooked this up yet but I suspect with non sports over the air, cable, sat HD viewing this unit will SHINE. I'm not sure how sports will look because that may bring in some of the same problems I had witht he blue ray movie.Conclusion* If you looking for a name brand, nice aesthetically looking unit for a low price this should be a good unit for you.* If this is for a second or 3rd room and not the primary viewed TV this may also be fine for you.* If you're a previous owner of a better flat panel or you have high expectation of picture quality for a bargain price then you may be disappointed.

No one there in their customer support could answer a basic question. How much does this TV consume? Well, it is not listed in the user guide, there at Samsung the do not know either. The TV uses 120 Volts at 60 Hz (normal house power). On the back of the TV it says 180W (Watts), so Watts (P) / Volts (E) = Amps (I). 180/120 = 1.5 Amps. This TV produces heat which is wasted energy since it CCFL backlighting.While it has a good picture, compared to Sharp Aquos LED LCD 46\", it is below that mark. At only 40,000:1 Dynamic Ratio the blacks do look like a real dark gray. For the money, it was a good deal but I like the display of my Sharp, so if money is tight, this works well but only 2 HDMI on the back and not able to take a USB plug and look at camera pictures or any of that, this may be a return to seller. The extra money would be spent on getting a 40\" Sharp LED LCD which is only 75 Watts (my 46\" is only 101 watts) and does not produce the heat. And in the bedroom, which is where this is, I can feel the difference. I also want to be as 'green' as possible and keep my FP&L; bill down. Here in South Florida, heat can be a problem sometimes. Since I am a Union JW Electrician, I like to know things like this, power consumption, etc. This would have been real simple for Samsung to just put down on the box or website.I have Google'd plenty of times to just get this basic information and it is not on the web anywhere. Also, I do not recommend any type plasma TV as they are real pigs when it comes to energy consumption and the amount of heat given off. So this is a good deal, worth the money, but it you want (or are like me really really picky) then spend a few more dollars, and try to get a LED backlight LCD tv.", "Date": "December 4, 2009"}, {"Title": "I am returining this one today", "Author": "A.B.", "ReviewID": "RG57AB0Y505FI", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "Insufficient number of connections.

What a nightmage. When you play an action flick, anything that moves, moves out of sync with the rest of the screen. But that was just the beginning of the issue. I made the genuine mistake of calling their customer service line (for shame Samsung, you hire people like this?), After giving all of my information to the customer support person, she sent me up to tier 2. There I got a snotty, mean person (and Samsung, my number is 7209331413, since no one gives their name, feel free to look up my record) After giving her all the exact same information that I had given the first person (and she still could not find my log), She went through the same menu items (she was looking for some kind of motion control option, but that does NOT exist on this TV, which tells you this is a common problem). Finally she told me that I needed to go to an electronics part store and buy a cleaner and clean the lense of the Blue ray disc player. WHAT?? I have had this unit for a few hours! Never mind that the appropriate cabling needed has to be purchased separately, it doe not come with the TV (you have to buy a HDMI-CEC cable separate, yeah, I know the box -implies- it has one in it, but it doesn't). Do not buy Samsung products. I can't believe that I paid hundreds of dollars for this (almost a grand when you add everything up) to get an inferior product and poor customer service.
