I have viewed satellite HD feed, . Blu-ray 1020p discs ,and youtube 4k video clips. The built-in line-doubler works amazingly well, visibly better that the 4K doubler that my home theater system provides ( anthem mrx710) Color depth and saturation is amazing as well. My only nit-pick is that I would have liked local full-array dimming as compared to the edge lit system. This TV comes with a matte screen, which I prefer,  since most of the time I view in a lighted room and am not bothered by reflections.  At $5000 the set was well priced", "Date": "November 26, 2013"}, {"Title": "Best TV ever purchased and I purchased a lot", "Author": "M.

Way too big, way too heavy. The Upscaling on Netflix streaming of Breaking Bad was mind blowing. I am thrilled with this acquisition. It's a no brainier if you hesitate between a 4K or an 80-85 inch Full HD which would be about the same price. The size trade off you make is totally worth it. Sharp did a great job with the configuration interface. Bottom line: AWESOME!", "Date": "March 19, 2014"}, {"Title": "New 4K Sharp TV", "Author": "Wags \"Wags\"", "ReviewID": "R34XMW4O1SOD00", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This is going to be difficult to review and most likely long.  I'm not sure many of these are out yet and I've only had it about a week.  Let me preface this by saying this is a replacement tv for a Pioneer Elite 70\"  I had the Elite for just over a year when it developed a blue vertical line on the screen.  The problem was Sharp had bought the Elite technology from Pioneer after they decided to get out of the TV business.  This meant I had to go through Sharp for a fix.  Since the Elite had a two year warantee I figured I was good.  My dealer contacted Sharp with pictures I took and after several calls it was decided they would give a credit toward a new set or a refurbished Elite.  Sharp said they had no new parts to make new TV's so the choice was easy.  Although I loved the Elite (my second Elite I've owned and I loved both) I wasn't going to take someones problem TV.I'm not sure if I can mention my home theater dealers name but I must say they went way out of there way to make me happy.  They set up three sets for me to look at for a replacement.  I looked at a Sony 4K in 65\" (no 70\" in the lineup), a Sony LED 65\" (an earlier model), and the Sharp 70\" 4K.  All of the sets looked great.  Since I was used to the Elite the Sony's seemed to have a similar picture quality.  I believe this to be the glass used is similar in that it is shinier than the Sharp which is more of a matte finish.  After much waffling I chose the Sharp due to it being the same size as my Elite and it was also a 4K set  The dealer gave me the option of using it in my home for a few weeks to see if I still loved it.While there is not native 4K content out there right now I'll reserve comment until I see it on this TV.  The dealer is driving 45 miles to me tomorrow to download some sample 4K content so I can judge just how good this TV will look when 4K content starts arriving, maybe early next year?  I've heard Netflix is going to begin streaming some 4K content soon.Okay, history lesson over and on to the picture quality.So far I do like the color and picture quality of the Sharp.  As noted the colors do look a bit softer than what I was used to but I think over time I will forget this issue.  I only have Direct TV standard signal now but tomorrow I'm having high def put in so I'll update this when I am seeing a better picture.  As it is the picture is very good with even skin tones and detailed shadow detail.  The blacks are very good as well.  There are many color and picture changes that can be made to suite your needs.  I have left mine set where they had it when I previewed in their store.  It seems to be the best for my eyes but everyone sees color differently.Is this TV a quality product? Yes.  Is it better than my Elite?  Yes and No.  Even though the Elite technology is almost two years old it still had a picture to rival any TV out there.  Still the Sharp has future technology with the 4K ability.  Even though there is no native content right now you have to believe when it does appear this TV will shine as good as the Elite.  Is this TV expensive?  Yes as any new technology is and like the Elite was when it came out.This TV also has built in speakers which are fine but I will be using my surround system.  It has many connection options and has built in wi-fi for everyone with a high speed connection.  Is there value for the money?  It depends on your point of view.  Are you someone that wants the newest and best as soon as it comes out?  Do you care about the actual color and picture quality?  Do you watch a lot of Blue Ray DVD's?  3D?  Or is your TV watching casual or have only off air broadcast signals?The bottom line is I gave it only 4 stars and only because I haven't seen 4K content yet and have only had it less than two weeks.  I will try to update this soon.  I may bump it to 5 stars once I see how the upscalling works on a high def signal and the actual 4K demo being installed tomorrow.  I hope this review helped some of you.Added 11-14-13 to above review.The home theater owner that has been trying to help me came out today and loaded some 4K content.  He wanted me to be sure I saw the TV as it will be soon.  I must say it was pretty amazing to see 4K content.  I've seen it on a Sony demo before and was impressed and this TV looked just as good.  The depth of color and detail are amazing.  I can't wait until providers start carrying content.I also had High Def Direct TV installed today as well.  I didn't have much time to watch but from what little I did see it looked pretty darn good too.  Much better than the standard definition I was getting before.  This TV is supposed to upsample content to simulate (if that's the right word) better than regular High Def.  The color depth again looked great from the little I had time to preview.In the end I'd boost my rating to 4 1/2 stars as I feel 5 stars is almost unattainable.  Except in the case of the Elite I used to have.  ;)November 15, 2013Okay, my last update I promise.  I finally had time to watch the Sharp with a High Def signal last night and tonight.  I am totally blown away by the depth of color and sharpness in detail.  I only wish I'd had the High Def signal when I still had the Elite so the comparison would be fair.  I'm sure the Elite would have held its own but the Sharp looks really amazing.  The upscaling, if that is what makes this set look so good, seems to work as stated.  I will have to give this TV 5 stars now.  It just can't be helped.  I think anyone that wants the latest technology in a large screen will be happy with the set.  Maybe more than happy now that I've seen just how well this TV can perform.", "Date": "November 13, 2013"}, {"Title": "Good but obsolete out of the box", "Author": "Gyro gearloos", "ReviewID": "R266266UUI9961", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I've had mine a couple weeks now so here is what I've learned.USB 1.4:This is fine for 3D at 1080p and 4k at 24 frames. It will not be compatible with USB 2.0 as there is hardware needed. You can't do a software upgrade to faster transceiver chips in the card for HDMI. That means no 4k at 30p or 60p, only 24.The upscaler is excellent but if you get next years best chipset in your new blurY Ayer or home theater and want to upscale there, you have no way to turn off the built in.Picture in THX Mode is fantastic and calibrated right out if the box.Sound is great considering how thin this thing is. It doesn't rival my Denon by any means but it's pretty good for anTV.No 4K on USB, only 1080P so with only the proprietary Sony Media server out for HDMI, your only way to see 4K currently s YouTube, which is compressed.It has all the usual apps like Netflix, Vudu, YouTube, etc...3D performs very well. The 2D to 3D converter even works pretty good. No headaches here by that's probably just me.His thing is heavy: Shipping weight says 124 Lbs. Took 2 to bring it in and put it up installed.Overall I'm very happy and love the TV but if I had to do over, I'd wait and spend a bit more when USB 2 is out solid.
