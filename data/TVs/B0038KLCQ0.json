{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Great value but not legacy friendly", "Author": "J. Lee", "ReviewID": "R1KB7UZQTGHV5W", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Overall:I've had this set for a few months now. Despite the little criticisms I have, I think this set is an excellent value and the picture is breathtaking with a 1080p source or even 1080i over-the-air.Picture:It's a great display and I have no complaint at all with the picture.  It has presets for adjusting the picture and that is a nice feature; I use 'cinema' most of the time.Chassis:The chassis is a very elegant piano black and looks nice when it is off.  This is actually kind of important when you get a TV this large!Sound:The speakers are not great, but they are adequate.  They are in the back so you (at least I) need to turn them up more than you would for front facing ones.Inputs / Outputs:This is where the 'not legacy friendly' gripe I have shows up, and costs Panasonic a star.  The only audio _output_ is a digital optical output.  If you have a stereo with a corresponding digital optical input, you're all set.  However, I'm willing to bet many if not most homes don't have such an input.  This means that you must use the so-so speakers when you use the antenna or an HDMI source that doesn't have an analog audio output (including perhaps some digital cable boxes).  It isn't too big a deal for me since movie watching is usually via a DVD player and I run its (analog) audio output through my stereo and it sounds great.  However, it would have been EASY for Panasonic to have a legacy analog audio output.  On the input side, there is no S-video input.  I get why they didn't put this in; S-video is on its way out.  However, I have a legacy video camera with S-video output and it would've been nice to use it.I've used the SD card input and it is slick.  They have a way to let you quickly start a slide show of all the pictures in the camera and even navigate around on the SD card directory.  It was nicely done and when you see pictures from an SLR camera brought out to a 42\" display the 'WOW' factor is pretty high.I've also used the DB15 connector for the laptop and it worked fine.  Be aware, if you want to use your laptop to stream video to this set, you will need a long VGA cable AND a long audio cable.  I found a combo cable on Amazon (both the video and the male-male audio cable on one 15' cable) that worked great.Remote:The remote is okay, but the buttons are quite close together so it is actually easy to press the wrong button when you do certain tasks.  The one I hit most often is VIERA TOOLS when I meant to hit INPUT.  I don't have anything that supports the VIERA standard (other than the tv) so I never want the VIERA TOOLS, but I do want to change the input fairly often.  The two buttons are right on top of one another and the VIERA TOOLS button is like 3x the size of the INPUT button.One thing I liked about the remote was a special \"sub menu\" button that lets you quickly get to things like the signal strength meter.  I get my HDTV signals off an antenna so I use the meter a good bit and it is nice not to have it buried under sub-menus.  Another cute feature on the remote is the favorite button.  You can program several favorite channels and get to them via this short cut.There are R G B Y buttons on the remote but get this: THEY DON'T TWEAK THE PICTURE.  They are used for special functions.  Uh, how about using F1 F2 F3 F4 for labels and color code those?  Otherwise everyone in the world will think these buttons are for picture adjustment.I really liked the INFO button; it shows you whether you're looking at 720p or 1080i or whatever and if the show is a digital source the name of the show, etc.  The FORMAT button lets you force 4:3 and has a few different 16:9 flavors that are nice to have.", "Date": "July 25, 2010"}, {"Title": "Recommend", "Author": "R. Newel", "ReviewID": "R1WUPX4CPBPBMA", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I replaced a 6 year old plasma TV that went out. My TV screen faces multiple windows. With the plasma I had to cover the windows with towels during the day to avoid glare. With this TV any glare is barely noticeable and only when the screen is dark. I'm watching it right now (day time) with the windows uncovered.I live at 5000 feet which caused the plasma to generate a lot of heat. That thing was hot! I could feel the heat radiating from it when I walked by. It did help heat my house in the winter, but probably caused the TV to give up the ghost. This Panasonic generates very little heat and is hardly even warm to the touch.The only issue is one I discovered after installing this TV and apparently many LCD TV's have this issue. With the TV powered on my dish network remote would not operate the dish network receiver. After entering the proper code it did operate the TV fine but not the dish network receiver. I had to put the remote withing 2 inches of the dish IR port to get it to function. I had a couple of very frustrating days fighting this thinking it was the dish receiver flaking out. Then I did some research and discovered the interference issue with the LCD TV and various receivers. Different LCD TV's have different fixes. Some fixes I found are: turn CATS on or off on the TV, turn energy savings on or off or adjust back lighting. On this TV you adjust the back light on the TV. This TV adjust from 1 to 100. I found that adjusting it below 45 the dish remote inconsistently operated the dish receiver. At 42 or lower the dish remote refused to operate the dish receiver at all. I set the TV back light at 78 and the problem was solved. My research showed that this issue is not limited to any one manufacturer and indicates manufactures are aware of the issue. The possible resolutions to this issue should be included in the manual.I ordered an HDMI cable with this TV, but it was shipped separately and am still waiting on it and am only viewing 480i. Even with an analog signal the picture is much clearer than my old plasma. However, with the analog signal I notice some fuzziness with quick moves on the screen. Most notably when using the dish TV guide. As I move around the guide it turns fuzzy for a fraction of a second, but it immediately clears up and becomes sharp. I suspect this will be resolved once I receive the HDMI cable and boost the resolution to 1080 since it's a fairly well known fact that an HD TV picture is less than perfect with an analog signal.I use the dish remote to operate the TV, but I will note that the TV remote buttons are large and well labeled. The exception is the keys labeled R, G, B and Y. They apparently have nothing to do with the RGBY connection. One wonders why they are labeled this way. On page 11 of the manual it notes the colored buttons are used for various functions and refers to pages 14, 18 and 31 for examples. I could find no reference to these buttons on pages 14 or 18. Page 31 simply says that these buttons are available when their purpose is displayed on the screen. I guess I'll find out what they're for when I need them. I don't consider this a negative because it doesn't concern me. It's just a little confusing.So far I am really happy with the TV. This is a good looking TV. The bezel isn't huge and the speakers are in back which I like. I had it up and running without ever cracking the manual. I look forward to when the HDMI cable arrives. Though I haven't used all the features I certainly recommend this TV. Just be aware of the IR interference issue and how to resolve it and you will be happy with it.", "Date": "August 19, 2010"}, {"Title": "Just Fine", "Author": "Doctor gee", "ReviewID": "R20XF4HDEFI7UU", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "This TV is fine. My biggest complaint is that the only sound output is through an optical cable. No RCAs, no headphone jack, no way out! I routed all my sounds out from cable, blue ray, DVR, and Wii to a switch with 4 inputs and one RCA or headphone jack for output for $30. I can connect it now to my home theater system. The images on the TV are crisp with no blur on fast action. Standard settings seem a little dark but it can be customized for every video input. Good overall set except for the sound.

I was comparing between Panasonic, LG, Samsung and Sony.  I made multiple trips to several stores to check out this TV, specially when put next to other brands.  Needless to say, all look good when watching HD content, but if you pay close attention, you can tell the difference.  Colors in Panasonic looked the best to me - richer, and more natural.The remote is fairly intuitive, and non-HD content looks good as well.As for other features, they're pretty standard across all the brands within this price range ($500-600).My general advice to folks buying HDTV for the first time:When buying an HDTV, buy for (1) screen size and (2) picture quality - those two things you can't \"upgrade\" during the life of the TV.  Other features, like watching internet content, browsing the web, etc, can be easily added through (fairly inexpensive) external devices (BlueRay player, media boxes).  No point paying more to have those embedded in the TV.  You cannot predict all the new features and technologies that will emerge over the life of your TV (hopefully at least 5 years), so you'll have to rely on add-on's anyway.  Focus on getting the right screen size and the best picture quality.  For judging picture quality, don't rely on online reviews, but go out and see for yourself in local stores.  Check out several stores (3-4) so you can eliminate any element of randomness (e.g., incorrect TV setting in a store) from your observations.Panasonic was the best screen size and picture quality for my budget, and so far I'm very happy with my choice!", "Date": "December 14, 2010"}, {"Title": "Great TV.", "Author": "Maxtro", "ReviewID": "R1O8XN1B0EBN18", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I've had this TV for about a month and I love it.

However, I am not using this TV in a media center, so I can't comment on it's performance in that application.  One bad thing was that the delivery company was very slow, so the shipment tracking system isn't very helpful as the shipper got the TV as indicated by the on-line system, but I got it many days later after negotiating a delivery time (not very convenient).

I've been using both high-definition cable and testing various game systems on it, and the picture quality is great regardless of whether 480i or 1080p.

There's a variety of connections available for audio, video, and gaming setups- as well as 3 hdmi connections if you'd rather not mess with a ton of wires all over the place. The only thing it seems to lack is an S-Video connection, which doesn't much matter as manufacturers have been phasing those out since the introduction of flat-screen displays.I happened to pick this up when there was a deep discount being offered by Amazon, so the $400 price was quite the bargain for a top of the line, high-quality name brand like Panasonic.

IMO, it can easily go up against all those other top brands without any noticeable difference in the picture.  Also, I found out tonight after playing around with it and by reading the op. manual finally, that the picture auto dims and brights based on the ambient lighting in the room.  I found this out because the picture was a little too bright for the vivid that I had the picture setting on.  I then changed it to standard and turned off the lights.  When this happened, I noticed the picture went a little dimmer, but everything adjusted together and it looks well balanced.  Watching Grey's Anatomy, everything looks true to color, sharp and vivid now that it is in standard mode.  When I had vivid on, it was slightly too bright and straining on the eyes.

This TV when you auto scan wont let you keep the previously scanned channels.  So with the antenna pointed West I scan and get all channels west of my location.  However, when I want to watch a channel East of me after pointing the antenna East I have to rescan the channels to get the East channels thus losing  all West channels.  Essentially a poor software design by an engineer who has no idea that some customers live in rural area and still use antennas!! One final issue with this set is the sound.  The speakers point to the rear of the TV therefore the volume has to be set higher and the sound is distorted.  Cannot recommend this TV to anyone.", "Date": "December 4, 2012"}, {"Title": "Panasonic 42\" LCD HDTV  TC-L42U22", "Author": "Brian T", "ReviewID": "R3RIKGM6WR4PBR", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "My wife and I purchased this television for our combined Christmas present to each other. We have never owned an LCD HDTV. We read all the reviews on this TV on AMAZON.COM and alot of other sites and decided the Panasonic TC-L42U22 was the best value for the money. It arrived on the day that AMAZON told us it would and it was very easy to install. We had it set up on Christmas day in time to watch the Christmas day parades. We were amazed at the clarity of the picture and sound. We made the right choice buying the Panasonic LCD TV. Our friends have different brand LCD televisions, we think our set is cleaner and crisper than theirs. One friend, after seeing the picture on our set ordered the same model for his family room.

DVDs look great on this - 1080 is beautiful for sure.The speakers are in the back and weak - I had to turn up the volume to the 70s to hear clearly speech.the lack of legacy connections are a problem indeed.  no S video, one optical out only.  Making matters worse, it seemed my (oldie) Pioneer receiver (VSX710S), from about 10 years ago, is unable to talk to this thing.  The optical out doesn't work... even when I turn off the Bitstream signals to PCM... still no dice.  Not sure if the TV optical is broken, but I also checked the optical out from a Viera blueray player and it was the same problem.  looks like I need to buy a new HDMI-based sound receiver to get the surround sound that is a must for me.overall, for the price, it is great value.  the exterior looks nice, picture quality is good, sound is ok but not bad, and inputs are a bit lacking but survivable.

I think for this price range and screen size you're looking at the best deal on the market. The HD is sharp and clear.

I prefer Cinema.I thought the volume was a tad low when I first set it up but after getting used to it I don't find it much of a problem. if you are a sound junky then you'll need to get some speakers that are Dolby friendly. The 3 HDMI outlets are especially welcomed and remote use is user friendly. What more can I say? It's a great television. If you're looking for something in the 40-47\" screen size range but can't afford those $900 televisions this is the one you want.

However, don't care for the long thin remote design which results in an un-natural grip for my ladies (size large) hands (have not had this issue with my Sharp or Insignia TV remotes nor any other that I can remember).  Also, the stand is stationery, so would prefer swivel (new this when purchased).  Instruction book is adequate except the page on how to set up the stand - jumps from putting together stand to TV in the stand when actually there are 4 little screws that must be perfectly aligned in a little channel of sorts.  Combine this with the TV size (would be the same for all models/mfg), it's a two person set up for most of us : ) Sound is adequate with HDMI cable and excellent picture.
