{"Reviews": [{"Title": "LG - LIFE IS NOT GOOD !", "Author": "Charlie", "ReviewID": "R3LEY4WTMDCI2K", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I bought a LG 50 inch Plasma Model 50PA5500 TV on May 16th 2012. After 35 days the picture would not display properly. They responded quickly as far as sending a technician to my house but were unable to determine the cause. I received another call the next day from the repair company and LG told them to try replacing the controller board before replacing the panel. Parts not due in until the following week.I contacted LG for a replacement television because now I will have a refurbished rather than a new television. They refused saying that their policy was to repair the unit. When I mentioned that the unit should last more than 35 days and that there were merchantability laws in Maine, the supervisor balked and told me that it didn't apply to them and that it was only for business in Maine. When I told her I would pursue that avenue, she told me to go ahead because it was her office that  received those letters from the state.", "Date": "June 22, 2012"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": null, "Features": null, "Name": null, "ImgURL": null, "ProductID": "B007QVJ1UG"}}
