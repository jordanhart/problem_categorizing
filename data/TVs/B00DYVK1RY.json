{"Reviews": [{"Title": "2013's best 'FALD' LCD/LED made by LG......", "Author": "Marty Gillis", "ReviewID": "R2G7BAZDGAO7F6", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I am a HUGE fan of LG. Over the last 5 years I had gone thru 5 different models (5400, 6200 , 7600, G2 , and LM9600) before finally purchasing THIS unit. Each subsequent TV was an improvement over the last, but THIS TIME the improvement is a major one. I care very little about Apps or web features and as such will not include them in THIS review. I am more concerned about picture quality and I will mostly talk about THAT.When it was announced a bit more than a year ago that 4K would be soon coming to a store near you, my heart skipped a few beats. Knowing that 4K broadcasting is a long way off (if at all) and that there was an almost complete lack of 4K video in general for consumer use, I was still not deflated, Fact is, I wanted a 4K display for what it could do for my current collection of Blu Ray titles. (and my Fios HD DVR)That's correct, I lusted for and ultimately purchased this TV for it's ability to up-convert my video collection to something beyond 1080p Full HD level. Using a 4K display to improve my existing collection is the ultimate, albeit a bit expensive, tweak. I waited for the price to come down, and with Amazon's current price and $500 store credit rebate, I couldn't wait any longer and took the plunge.Just took delivery a few weeks ago and I am still glowing from the extra added HD PLUS (what I am calling it right now) that I am getting to enjoy.I want to make one thing VERY clear! I have read all over the web about how it was \"scientifically impossible\" to see or notice the benefits of 4K (Ultra HD) on screens smaller than 70 or so inches. I am here to tell you that is ABSOLUTELY untrue. It is readily apparently that you are watching a much higher resolution than 1080p within seconds. It is everything I had hoped HDTV would be, but wasn't. And I am talking about upconverted source material , not native 4K.I sit approx. 8 feet from my screen, in a Lazy Boy and dead center in the sweet spot. I bought the 55 inch screen due to space constraints. There is NO DOUBT at all that I am seeing the difference,. Even my 84 year old father can see it. (He raved on about it for half an hour the other day)SO...... if you are on the fence because you aren't sure whether or not this type of television can or will improve the viewing pleasure with your current video collection,. Rest assured IT WILL....... OH yes, it will!!!!!I need to say that I use an Oppo BDP-95 as my source component, run into a Darbee Darblet and then into the LG LA9700. The results have varied from \"Really Good\" to \"Freaking Unbelievable\" !After viewing this for a few weeks, I can honestly say the improvement in perceived video quality is around 25 to 35% , depending on the quality of the video signal you feed the TV. Even my better DVD's look simply amazing after up-conversion. ( the video quality of \"Seinfeld\" on DVD now rivals the TBS HD broadcasts in both perceived resolution, delineation and stable and correct color rendering)This really is the way to go for movie lovers that want more from their current 1080p panels. While true native 4K content is totally mind blowing, unconverted HD content, ESPECIALLY well authored/scanned Blu Ray is really beyond belief! .. I was and AM stunned each time I see it.As for the actual TV itself, it is top of the line for LG. Made in Korea (not Mexico or China) and a cut above in both build quality and operational ability. Gone is the annoying reflective \"Chrome\" border that was around the bezel of last years 9600. Nice clean lines and THE BEST and the sturdiest TV stand LG has ever made to this date. Everything about the build quality is pro expect for a non-removable power cord. Even my much less expensive G2 has that. Hmmm.......The main thing with all LG panels I have owned has been this: Their out of the box picture just isn't all that good to start with. MANY adjustments are needed to find the sweet spot in regards to picture quality. The LG has a very good dynamic range and once you undo the factory settings and use a few consumer calibration discs, you will be well on the way to seeing what this panel can REALLY do.The main reason that THIS unit looks so good can be summed up in two words... PIXEL DENSITY! You are basically getting 4 times the pixels compared to a 1080p display. Of course, you are at the mercy of your up-convertor, whether it comes from a Blu Ray player or the chip inside the LG itself. So far I have only used the LG to up-convert my 1080i and 1080p signals. If a better job can be done, then I would like to see it.The other reason the picture is so good is down to the FALD (Full Array Local Dimming) design of the panel. LG has never completely got FALD right and this TV is no exception. The problem is the LED's are just too close to the front of the screen. If the TV were maybe \u00bd an inch deeper then perhaps the Nano Filter could completely eliminate any and all horizontal banding and light leakage. While the zones go on and off quickly, I think the placement of the top and comer zones could have been thought out a bit better so that when watching films with top/bottom bars, you would get zero light bleed. As it is, you WILL get a bit, not very much, but it WILL be there no matter how low you put the backlight. When the screen should be 100% black, IT IS, but when there is a bright object at the end of the screen or very top and you have black bars beyond that, you WILL see a bit of light where it doesn't belong. It is down to the design of the panel. It is not a malfunction.People seem to want wafer thin panels and LG is trying to please those people while still offering a FALD panel. Personally, they should have gone with a deeper cabinet design that would have rivaled the SHARP Elite from a few years back.Oh well, you can't have everything. The viewable portions of the screen look fantastic , once you calibrate the panel. Colors are thick and rich, blacks are deep and dark and shadow detail is well preserved.Overall panel performance COULD have been increased by just adding a faster quad core chip, instead of the dual core this one sports. Oh it works well, but perhaps the up-scaling and motion rendering could have been better with 4 cores.Today I watched Star Trek 2: The Wrath of Khan on BD. I was simply awestruck through the entire film. The amount of detail in the picture was so improved that I saw many things never seen before , including a wire or two that were previously hidden, even on the best 1080p sets. Shatner's toupee line was clearly visible and \"Khan's\" pecs were so clearly defined that once and for all you could finally see that they were ACTUALLY HIS and not a prosthetic device as some have claimed. \"Space\" looked just right, nice and black......If you are new to calibration, even basic calibration, you may wish to hire someone who is ISF certified to do the job. The difference is night and day and whether YOU do it, or hire it out, IT HAS TO BE DONE or this TV will not perform to it's full capability. If you are going to plunk some the $$ for this puppy, then just be prepared to spend just a bit more $$ or a bit more of your own time to dial it in properly.I will post my initial settings in the comments section of this review. You can use them as a starting point for using your Spear's and Munsil disc or whatever you have. It will at least put you in the ballpark.A word about updating the TV software, If you are connected to the web and get prompted to update, make sure you write down your settings as the last update I did wiped out all my settings and put it back to factory condition. My last few LG's did not do this, but this one did. Just a word of warning.Motion rendering is a problem with ALL LCD TV's. This one is no exception. Unless you enjoy judder and blurring, you will NEED to use the Tru Motion. The trick is in HOW to use it and HOW MUCH you should use. I have found that for 60hz source material the User Setting set to Judder 2 and Blur 2 will work wonders without introducing any noticeable soap opera effects. For 24 fps material (Bu Ray, etc) using a user Setting of Judder 1 and Blur 2 works very very well and I couldn't get it to even start to show judder on pans or noticeable blurring on fast action scenes. The factory presets for Smooth and Clear are just TOO MUCH and change the cadence of the motion too drastically for my tastes, not to mention the dreaded soap opera effect in all it's glory! LG has improved their Tru Motion algorithms from 2012's models.  Rolling credits on movies were a major problem for it and they would tend to break at the top and bottom of the screen when Tru Motion was engaged at ANY setting. Now they roll by flawlessly with no artifacts.  ALSO, the adjustments themselves for both Judder And Blur seem to have a bit more headroom since I can pretty much eliminated all judder BEFORE the \"SOE\" (soap opera effect) kicks in.....I have, however, seen the LG  processor \"choke\".. It happens every now and then while watching a news channel and there is fast moving multi directional action on the main screen WITH a crawl going on at the same time. That just about pushes the chip into having a nervous breakdown at times.  This is the only time I have seen it choke. Watching \"The Hobbit\" in 3D did not induce any motion artifacts thankfully. But if you put in the CNN craw at the bottom of the screen during it, the TV would most likely have a digital anxiety attack! It is good to remember that this sort of motion handling problem is not exclusive to LG and that LCD displays IN general have a few inherent weaknesses with judder being one of them.  (all you judderless DLP fans out there are feeling so smug about now eh? ) HA HA!After owning and USING multiple LG models over the last 7 years, I have found that the KEY to getting the best picture out of them is to ALWAYS ALWAYS keep your backlight control AS LOW AS POSSIBLE and build you entire calibration around it.  I currently have mine set at 38 which allows for a much deeper contrast/brightness ratio and ALSO decreases the visible horizontal (and sometimes vertical) banding that plagues these things. The higher you set the backlight, the more you will see the actual panel structure and THAT is something you do not want.Anyway, keeping the backlight DOWN with enable you to find this TV's \"Sweet Spot\". Once you see it, you will KNOW IT.  I have seen this with ALL LG sets, once you hit the magic combination of Backlight/Contrast/Brightness values, it will go from look \"Very Good\" to \"Freaking Unbelievable\".. It is undeniable.*** check the comments section on this review for my initial settings.........While I would PREFER not to use the Tru Motion at all, it is necessary with this panel, plain and simple.3D performance is phenomenal. HANDS DOWN THE BEST you can get in an HDTV right now. You are getting at least Full 1080p from both sides with a passive system. Basically with this LG, as far as 3D goes you are getting to both have your cake and eat it too. It has to be seen to be believed,. I watched \"The Hobbit\" yesterday in 3D and it rocked beyond belief! It's the best, really. Watching 3D for me used to be more trouble than it was worth. Now I am having to rethink that point of view. It's as good as the best active you have seen, only better since it doesn't have the active system artifacts.The LG Magic Remote has been refined and now no longer falls over on it's side when you set it down. Nice! The highly touted speaker bar is fine, but the motorized feature is nothing more than a gimmick. I have it set to always stay down as I just know that motor will wear out when the speaker is UP and not DOWN!The speakers themselves are fine, but they are not up to the same level of the removable speaker/sound bar that used to come with the Pioneer Kuro panels. It does, however play louder and sound better than any other TV speaker I have heard lately, except for last years Sony's with the Dumbo Ear speakers on their first 4K models. You can customize the sound itself with a built in equalizer and a fake surround sound algorithm. You can also adjust the delay, both forward and back for lip sync problems. Any good sound bar will outperform the Lg speakers however. They are good, just not all that great. Of course, anyone who spends this much on their TV is probably planing to use it with a full surround system anyway.This model seems to power up a lot quicker than previous models did. It also seems to run a bit hotter as well. As I said earlier, I am a fan of LG. I find their menus easy to navigate and their brand as a whole to have excellent reliability. I have yet to have even one of my 5 other LG's go bad on me. (knock on wood)In closing, until 4K content becomes easily available, the main reason to own one of these things is to up-convert your existing video collection. IN that regard, it does a GREAT job and I have ZERO buyers remorse regarding this purchase.Both Blu Ray and DVD look very good. Even my highly throttled Fios signal (HD LITE) is easier to look at now. The better the transfer, the more dramatic the improvement will appear to be. I jack things up a notch with my Darbee Darblet for even MORE added detail and contrast enhancement. (I use a setting of 54 on Full HD) The Oppo, Darbee and this LG make for a winning combination, with my movie collection taking on a whole new life of it's own now. I am pushing 60 and never thought in a million years I could get a picture this good in my own home. It is truly amazing and at the current asking price, for movie lovers it is WORTH IT!Yes, 4K will eventually come to both physical media and broadcast, and yes, the standard may NOT be compatible with THIS TV.... be that as it may, this is THE BEST WAY I know of NOW to watch BD video at home. And the passive 3D is beyond belief. And while there IS both horizontal banding and some minor light leakage both caused by thin panel design, the quality of the viewing image itself is so darn good that I can overlook it pretty much.Overall, a GREAT Ultra HDTV! This LG has blown me away constantly over the last two weeks and as such, gets Marty G's highest recommendation.

This bad-boy is loaded with bells and whistles galore.  I watched many youtube reviews and personally disagree with many that say do not get this TV - the resolution and clarity is jaw-dropping.  I have gigabit internet so I can easily stream UHD content from Netflix and other sources - so this TV is ideal for someone in my situation.  The speakers are really quite good for a TV and it makes blu-rays and even DVDs look noticeably better.  The only time I have seen any audio lag is when I am watching something quite old that it is up scaling significantly.  I'm guessing when it has to process so much there starts to be a bit of a delay.  The only time I noticed was when we were watching some old 70's sitcom and the voice started to veer away from the lip movements. This beauty really starts to shine when you put in a blu-ray (in my case - through a PS3 with HDMI cable).  People who come over - even ones that are not into the whole high def stuff notice the difference.  The jump from a 1080P TV to this one is substantial.  I'll admit - it's very difficult for me to tell if I am watching 720P or 1080P... but I KNOW when I'm watching this TV that we are beyond 1080P.", "Date": "February 18, 2014"}, {"Title": "Amazing", "Author": "MyPenName", "ReviewID": "R16EMO0UTV52VS", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I don't have the knowledge to get into all the technical specifics of this tv, but what I can tell you is that I have no idea how tv can possibly get any better, aside from teleporting the actors directly into your living room, or perhaps a hologram performance dancing through your living room? Come to think of it, with this tv, those hologram performances WILL dance through your living room, in 3D.This tv has everything you could want. The picture quality is absolutely amazing, right down to every last hairline and detail. The colors and tone are the most real that I have ever seen on any tv as of yet.Remember being too lazy to get up and change the channel?... well, now you barely even have to push buttons on the remote - you can just talk to it. You can speak your websearch, or other apps that use text input, as well as change the channel, control the volume, etc.It can turn regular tv into 3d tv. That's right. It's magic, magic I tell ya.You do not see any motion blur - I haven't seen any yet, even with watching fast action type movies, sports, auto racing etc. People's mouths will not be moving off of their face as they speak and the herds of stampeding lions/bison/elephants/cheetah on Animal Planet will not turn into fuzzy blobs intermittently as they speed by.If you play two player video games that use split screen, you can get a separate set of Dual Play glasses that let you see only your side of the split screen, but it is displayed on the whole tv .. only to you. Again, it's MAGIC. Magic, I tell ya! This won't appeal to everyone, but it is pretty neat. You can get two pairs of the glasses for about 20 bucks, so it's pretty cheap to indulge.You can do all the usual wifi/WiDi connecting to your devices - phones, tabs, laptops, speakers...whatever ya have that connects wirelessly, as well as NCF.Sound is great as is, or you can hook up your system to it. It does have some tweaking settings so you can customize it a bit.The stand is simple, yet stately. It suits the powers of the tv perfectly. It kindly says, \"Here is my big@ss MAGIC tv. Look at it.\"Like I said, I don't have all the technical hoopla knowledge, but I do know this tv looks and sounds phenomenal. If you have the money to invest in a tv that will serve you for the upcoming years, (until that teleportation is fully perfected) this is the tv for you.Programming/broadcasts will become available, but in the meantime, everything still looks amazing. You can definitely tell the difference between this tv and my old 1080p 120hz lcd, even without the broadcast being 4k. You ever hear people say - \"oh, it looked so real...I felt like I was there\" ..  well, that's the kinds of things you will say when you see the picture quality of this tv.I'm tellin ya, it's magic!", "Date": "May 25, 2014"}, {"Title": "Wonderful TV Experience", "Author": "Mark", "ReviewID": "R3FEXCACT6SYJD", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "My brother bought one of these or it's larger brother a couple of weeks ago here on Amazon and it's definitely a center piece of the house.
