At 40\", I consider this a medium size TV not for prime viewing in an entertainment center, so I was not expecting to be surprised.  I just wanted a TV for causal viewing in the bedroom - such as news or something why dressing and cleaning or moving about the house.Set up was easy. The video quality is great. The audio is amazing after a few adjustments. We are audiophiles in the house, but didn't buy the TV for the audio so we are pleasantly surprised. It has built-in surround that works effectively if the TV is near a wall to bounce the surround channels down and out of the back against the wall to get the sound to go sideways. I am not sure the audio may work as well if mounted to a wall - maybe somebody can add their experience to the reviews. My TV is on the supplied stand setting on a 70\" wood dresser which adds to the sound quality. It does not have the vibrations of a sub woofer but this couldn't and shouldn't be expected. However, it was sufficient to disturb people in the rest of the house.I am not wild about the looks of the stand and it does not adjust (no stands appear to adjust for this size of TVs), but I can live with it. It is metal and seems better constructed than plastic stands. There are three primary HDMI inputs which is just about right for my needs. I am not using any of the audio out features.I specifically did not want a smart TV. Most tech reviews will tell you that smart TVs are a waste of money because the functions are typically well behind the current trends, poorly programed and are rarely updated becoming obsolete quickly. I tried it out since it is available and the reviews seem to be on spot. It is okay at best if you have sufficient internet and 85% of American population does not thanks to lack of competition and laws the reinforce internet provider monopolies. Most of the dozens of the added online apps (weather, games, news and whatnot) didn't work. You can be guaranteed the commercials you have to sit through to use an application works great, but the apps themselves generally do not work at all. Some of the high end smart services (i.e. amazon) appear to be in development and say such when you select them from the TV's menu. I am not sure why the service is listed on the menu if they are not available. Considering there is smart services in the TV, BlueRay player, the computer, an Apple device and I think the refrigerator, I do not care about the smart feature and did not not consider it part of the review.  Wait - is the kitchen sink a smart appliance to?I struggled choosing among the Sony, Samsung and Vizio within the same feature class and size. I saw them side by side and could not really tell the difference in video (BTW refresh rates were 240, 120 and 60 respectively). There wasn't much difference in cost so I purchased the Sony. I am glad I did.", "Date": "March 29, 2014"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": null, "Features": null, "Name": null, "ImgURL": null, "ProductID": "B00JBIM3KW"}}
