We've had this Sharp for 4 weeks. We spent several hours comparing this and about 7-8 other LCD/LED/Plasma TVs at our local Sears and kept coming back to this TV. The picture is excellent and very bright with deep blacks for a non-plasma; the Sharp just appeared more natural.  I had heard that Samsung has had some issues with their motherboards, so I was a little scared off. The sound is surprisingly good for just a TV with a nice surround feature and adequate base.  Plenty of hook-ups. I don't miss the internet features since netflix etc are on my blu-ray and also on my laptop; it is probably easier to stay current with these types of features with a Roku or AppleTV anyway. Setting up the TV with the included stand was fairly easy; it took around 15 minutes.  We are really happy with the TV and feel it is a good value.", "Date": "February 4, 2011"}, {"Title": "Nice HDTV", "Author": "Mikmcl", "ReviewID": "R1IWS56S98D4K9", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I spent about 4 weeks comparing different HDTV's. I felt like the Plasma sets I looked at were too washed out and gray looking. I looked at some LCD's and they seemed to have the picture quality i was looking for - brighter, sharper colors. I was struggling with the decision of whether to go with an entry level or mid range model of an LCD and then I found this set for $800 dollars. I've had it for 3 weeks and it has been great.Pro's -Price, all the standard technical specs for $800 - 1080p, 4HDMI inputs...Style, it is a thin TV and looks very sleak, it has a larger bottom frame than some TV's but i like the look.Picture, i have no complaints, movies, cable and blu ray's look great. I have not done too much around reconfiguring the settings and it still looks good.Con's -The stand does not swivel, I mounted mine so it is not a problem but people should keep it in mind.The blue light does get a bit annoying but I can live with it for the price.Summary - if you want a reasonably priced TV in the 46 inch range, this one is a pretty good model to consider.", "Date": "March 23, 2011"}, {"Title": "Good TV", "Author": "Liem Trinh", "ReviewID": "RPI7YYVFENITM", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Good TV so far.

I think buying a LCD makes more sense since the technology has matured and well tested.Dislikes:1. It freezes on many free-over-air channels and then you can't do but have to unplug it and restart it. Else, keep waiting for 15-20 mins to have it come back to life (this is the main reason I am returning it)2. The on screen menu is awkward and covers the whole screen and you can't notice the changes when you are changing your video settings3. In the dark, you can see that the tv has uneven patches of back-lights (may be becuase its a edge lit tv). Another reason to return.4. The blue power light in front is just a stupid concept. When you turn on the tv its turns on and when you turn tv off, it turns off. It should be the opposite way (so that it doesn't bother you while watching tv and secondly you know that tv is in sleep mode and not completely off).5. The stands seems like a rotating stand but it is not which was a big disappointment6. Pilot shipers are not good, I took 3-7pm appointment on Friday so that I have the whole week but they told me it doesn't matte what appointment you took, we can't deliver after 5pm (had I known it, I would have chosen Saturday).Likes:1. Good deal. I got it for 800 bucks, good size and nice looking tv2. You can but connect a USB or Hard Drive and watch movies/photos right away (which i liked the most)3.
