The display set in the store didn't do this set justice. Right out of the box this tv was easy to set up to my PC, Xbox 360 and my stereo all within 20mins (no dead pixels :]). The Hi-def picture quality is awesome. The graphics coming from the xbox are astounding, and it is the perfect size for a large PC screen. Fits perfectly in a bedroom, just about the largest TV I would want for a bedroom, any bigger and you'd be to close to the screen for optimum viewing.I bought this set mainly to use as a bigger display than my 17\" lcd on my laptop, and i was a little skeptical about the color temp and the resolution compared to a high-end computer monitor. As soon as i hooked up my laptop via the HDMI cable this screen blew my mind, the text is sharp, the color temp is spot on (has menu features to adjust) and the shear size makes editing photos in photoshop and lightroom a breeze. I'm a professional photographer and I am pretty picky when it comes to color and res and this set was exactly what I was looking for.I highly recommend this set!", "Date": "August 9, 2010"}, {"Title": "Looks great sounds not so great", "Author": "Krzysztof4Now", "ReviewID": "RTTPN9SSXTDAV", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "Bought this set just before black Friday from Target. Set up out of the box very easy, hooked it to my Verizon Fios, picture looked stunning. Noticed a weird problem that only happened a couple of times. When a non HD commercial would come on, the audio on the tv started to flutter, skip, and then go silent. The longer that I kept this set, the more frequent this started to occur. I was starting to get pretty frustrated with this and finally enlisted Vizio's help. The first thing they have me do is reset the factory default settings on the tv. This means turning off the features I bought the set for, ex: SRS TruSurround, and TruVolume. Ok, I'll play along, so I reset the tv and guess what? It didn't fix the problem, and now my tv sounds tinny and still has the fluttering and volume cut off situation. Frustrated, I hang up with Vizio and now a new problem arises, when some kind of graphic pops up on a show, the sound gets really loud and poof, the tv reboots its self. Now I've had it, called Vizio again, and they tell me they've haven;t had any other complaints like this one?!? ( I guess they don't read Amazon reviews, and now I wish I had seen the Amazon reviews before buying this set). I now make the decision to return the set back to Target, but first I still need a new TV. Just by dumb luck, I find an open box Samsung 40\" 1080p set at Best Buy for the same $399 I just bought this Vizio 37\".  Long story short.... I'm happy with the Samsung and I can use all of the sound features without a hiccup.I tried to leave this same review on Vizio's web site, but they still have not approved it.There are a lot of bad volume reviews about this set and the E371VA, so be careful in your decision when purchasing.", "Date": "January 8, 2011"}, {"Title": "Picture quality ok - Sound quality poor.", "Author": "John", "ReviewID": "R22UORCKVZUTQB", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "The set was delivered quickly and was easy to set up. The picture quality was just ok, but the Toshiba I have in the other room has far superior picture quality. But what really sunk this unit for me was the sound quality - or lack of it.

They even paid for return shipping. Thanks, Amazon! I'll keep looking for a 37\" with good sound.

Barna", "ReviewID": "RQC8YO401Q6TA", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "First off, my wife and I bought this TV during Black Friday 2010. It's now July 2011 and we've been using it ever since. I think for a product to get a fair review, you need to put some mileage on it. So, after about eight months of usage, here's what we've seen:Pros:+ Great picture: Images are sharp, and there's no discernable lag from my gaming systems. DVDs show beautifully on this set.+ User-friendly: The ports are all easily accessible and the remote is easy-to-use and straightforward. Switching between inputs is fast and easy. Additionally, this TV remembers volume levels for various inputs, so as you switch between cable (volume level 11 of 100 for us) to AV or HDMI outputs (volume level 25 of 100 for us) you're not constantly fiddling with the volume control. Finally, the TV is lightweight, so it can be moved or mounted easily.+ Cost: For the value of this TV, the set is reasonably priced; it competes well with other sets of its size and quality.Cons:- Sound: The biggest flaw in this TV is the sound. The SRS TruVolume feature seems to do exactly the opposite of what it purports. It claims that it balances out the sounds of softer TV shows with louder commercials, giving you a more even, predictable volume. We found that when SRS was on, we got ridiculously loud commercials and quiet TV programs. Disabling this helped reduce some of that fluctuation, but on the whole, the volume still needs to be frequently adjusted. This problem is much worse when listening to DVDs. For instance, we recently acquired the BBC's Robin Hood series from Amazon. As we watched season one, we probably altered the volume 6-7 unique times per 45-minute program. After changing the volume settings through the TV to practically every possible combination in an attempt to fix it, we finally gave up and used external speakers, which fixed the problem.- Remote sensor: The remote sensor is located on the bottom left of the TV. Occasionally, a couch or a game controller will be blocking the senor. Not a huge deal, but with even minimal blocking, the sensor won't acknowledge the remote. You can usually maneuver the remote around to reach the sensor. Depending on your setup, you might find this more annoying than we did; it was only a minor inconvenience for us.- Power: This last problem has only started occurring in the last month or so, and has only happened 3-4 times, but it's enough to concern me. Occasionally, when powering on the TV, the Vizio logo lights up (acknowledging the power is on) but the screen stays black. Sound comes through, but no picture. Powering off and powering on the TV again fixes the problem in every instance we've occurred, but I can't help but wonder if this might foreshadow more problems.Overall:Ultimately, this TV does what we want it to do. It has a great picture and is easy to use -- perfect for newlyweds on a budget. For this price, I can't complain. However, if you're not the type to hook up external speakers, you might want to consider looking at other options.", "Date": "July 15, 2011"}, {"Title": "Well Pleased", "Author": "cooter", "ReviewID": "RLW3V3AK697L5", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This tv is well worth the money and is priced below Walmart's price, when I purchased it.

For me I have the picture on Wide Screen for most viewing especially Sports or Stretch, if I am watching a DVD.

When using an HDMI source, audio will flutter and go out when flipping through channels or when a commercial comes on. Surely it was poor quality HDMI cables, nope.

This is perfect for viewing 6-12 foot distances.If you're looking for great sound you WILL have to hook this up to your stereo or surround sound system; logic dicates that would be the case for most flat screens tho...simple basic acoustics dictate that more is needed/not possible in a small cabinet.If you're buying your first time Flatscreen...you'll like this a lot; also, it's great to have the realistic pic you get with this over the old tube pics...and way better than projection...ps...loved the free shipping too!!", "Date": "November 28, 2010"}, {"Title": "Sound/Non-HD are drawbacks", "Author": "bcar", "ReviewID": "R1YA37THX7UBEO", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "Recently purchased the VIZIO E370VA 37-inch Full HD 1080p LCD HDTV from Amazon.  It arrived in a short amount of time and was extremely easy to set up.  I've got it hooked up with HDMI cables from my cable box and DVD player.  The picture is fantastic EXCEPT when the channel is switched from a full HD channel to one that is not.  When that happens the screen shot becomes smaller with black borders around the programming.  At the top of the screen a squiggly white line appears horizontally and remains on the screen until we switch back to an HD channel.  Additionally, the sound randomly cuts out and i've taken out and re-inserted the HDMI cables several times but this does not seem to solve the problem.  The sound will just shut off during a show and immediately comes back on if i switch to another channel and then switch back.  very annoying.  I can't determine if it is a problem with my cables (which are new) or something inherently flawed with the tv.

Overall I am pleased with the picture quality, but the sound quality is marginal for my old ears. I can connect it to my older sound system, but only with an $86 adapter since the TV only has an optical digital audio out jack. Other issues are that the remote must be pointed very accurately for it to work, channel changes take 7 seconds to take effect, and volume changes take 3 seconds.
