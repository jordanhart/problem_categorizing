I actually was debating on whether to purchase this 40\" LED 3D 1080p 120hz Samsung TV (UN40EH6030) or a practically identical 40\" LED 1080p 120hz Samsung TV (UN40EH6000). At the time of purchase the 6030 was selling for $497.99 which has 3D capability and also comes with a pair of 3D glasses.  The 6000 was selling for $548.00. They both have the same exact specifications, except that the 6030 has 3D capability which is the only difference and I even called Amazon to confirm this, as sometimes things aren't 100% accurately described. The Amazon rep confirmed that they were basically the same TV. Don't believe me? Look it up for yourself and compare specs. So I got a 3D TV instead of just a regular 2D TV AND SAVED $50 which is awesome. To seal the deal I didn't have to wait in line for this deal, didn't have to worry about getting trampled, and it was delivered to my home 2 days before Black Friday.Took about 10-15 minutes to assemble (very easy assembly) and another couple minutes to make a few minor tweaks to the picture. I actually used a review from the UN40EH6000 reviews to help make the minor picture tweaks. If you decide to purchase this TV i'd direct you to follow that review to change some settings as they made the TV look even better. The review is titled \"Sometimes...Not BEING a Smart TV... is The SMART TV!\" and it's posted by F. Maria.I am a big gamer, and playing Halo 4 and Call of Duty Black Ops 2 and to say the picture is great is an understatement. So clear, so crisp, the blacks are black, whites are white, as they should be. I'm going to begin my military service here in the next few months so it'll likely be idle for at least 6 months so if you're looking for a updated review i'm sad to say you likely won't see one, but rest assured that if something goes wrong with my television I will do my best to update my review as soon as possible so that you and others researching this TV are given timely information.Was a bit skeptical when purchasing through Amazon as usually with electronics you want to see it with your own eyes, but the process couldn't have really gone any better, unless they decided to give me a free TV :)Cheers!", "Date": "November 21, 2012"}, {"Title": "Take it from an owner, this television IS 120hz... Pay no attention to the other reviewers!", "Author": "Jantzen", "ReviewID": "R1RZRVN1T2V91R", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I wanted to make a review only for the fact that there are two misleading reviews already!  This TV is 120hz.  Period.  People should not always believe what others post based on a hunch.  The reason people think this is a 60hz TV..?  Because the manual says \"120hz Panel Refresh Rate (in 3D mode).\"  That's all they're going off of.  What it should really say is \"120hz Panel Refresh Rate (in 3D mode, too).\"All Samsung TV's with a CMR 240 are guaranteed 120hz in ALL modes.  The 60hz version of this TV is the Samsung 40eh5000.  That TV is not available in 3D because 60hz 3D is not a realistic option.  Images would be too hazy.  This is a Samsung 40eh6030.  I hope I have made myself clear that this is in fact a 120hz TV.  A simple call to Samsung will confirm that.Now for the actual TV.The picture quality is great.  Although it does not get quite as bright as some LED TV's I have seen, it's certainly bright enough.  (I also own the Sony Bravia XBR55HX929, ya know, the $3500 one... It may not be fair to compare them.)  The images are crisp and clean.  The dynamic contrast ratio of 5,000,000:1 gives images an impressive black level.3D.  The 2D to 3D conversion is only decent.  It's preferable just to watch the content in its native 2D.  However, when you get your hands on native 3D content with a 3D blu-ray player,  The 3D is absolutely immersive.  It looks fantastic.  The glasses are somewhat cheap and uncomfortable after a long time, though.  Native 3D gaming is also a whole new experience that just blew my mind.Sound quality.  The sound leaves a bit to be desired.  The TV can definitely pump enough volume for the average living room but to get a full experience, you may want to consider external speakers.Final thoughts.  The TV is a fantastic set... If you were lucky enough to pick one up on black friday for $499 then you should definitely keep it!  You won't find a better deal for quite awhile.  Personally, I'm not into the whole 'smart TV' trend because they make many boxes that can do the same for much cheaper.  If you like that stuff, you will be sorely disappointed.  One of my favorite things about this TV is that there are quite a few ways to customize the picture... More than my Sony even.All in all, I would definitely recommend this TV.", "Date": "November 29, 2012"}, {"Title": "this is a great LED TV", "Author": "Amazon Customer \"vivgor\"", "ReviewID": "R1WGT6WSTGVGOR", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I recently bought the set from another retailer as I got a better deal. I am writing this review to present the facts as I see them. I am no videophile or guru, so please regard my review only as an end user perspective.Pros-1. Excellent picture quality. I have seen 480p, 720p and 1080p channels on this set and without doubt it is as good as the best television sets the stores put up for display.2. Sounds great. 20W does the magic I suppose. Previously I thought Sony Bravia was best at video and audio, but this tv blows it to dust.3. IT DOES NOT FEEL THICK. If you are worried about the thickness of the TV, please refer to other LED sizes. You will be surprised to see that most of them in this class are above 3 inches. This one is 3.7 inch thick, and to me, what matters most is how thick it feels. It does not.4. 120 HzCons-1. I feel the 3D quality is not that great when converted from 2D. I will update the review when I get chance to watch real 3D content.2. When I plug it in the contrast was set to 100. Holy crap. I was so worried.

It's great for 360, blurays, and PC usage. I experience no input lag when connecting to my PC to play some FPS games. The PC mode is excellent and I believe it supports 4:4:4 mode for 1 to 1 pixel mapping. The thing with this TV Is that retalers are advertsiing that it is a 120hz set. This is only partially correct. The 120hz only applies to the fact that it can do 3D, but the set does not support Auto Motion Plus to smooth out the image. One downside is that there are only 2 HDMI inputs, which can be a problem if you have a lot of devices to connect. Otherwise, excellent TV.", "Date": "April 28, 2013"}, {"Title": "Incredibly Poor Customer Service *Revised 5/24/13*", "Author": "Burton Kellogg", "ReviewID": "R3DJQ7VZMHN4BW", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "We bought this TV in 11/2012. We loved the quality of the picture & features. In late April 2013, a grey smudge 1/2 the size of a dime appeared in the center of the screen. I submitted an online repair request with Samsung on 5/2. After nineteen days, six e-mails, several phone calls, two repair services, a visit from a tech, three conversations with 'Executive Customer Relations', two different 'ticket' numbers and one review by the mysterious 'Panel Review Board', I've been advised that they will not repair our TV, and that there is no recourse.Why? They're claiming physical damage, even thought there's not a mark on it. Someone poked it with a finger, they say. My wife is 60; I'm 62. There have been no other people in our home since 2/2013 other than the Samsung tech. And we're not prone to poking our fingers into TV screens. An interned search of this problem indicates a blown led/lcd, but Samsung won't discuss it. We're stuck, and that's it.Btw, no one at Samsung knows what is going on. The evening of the day the Tech was here, I received a call from Samsung asking if I was happy with the repair. The day the repair service called and told me that my repair was denied (5/17), I called Samsung and was told that my complaint would be sent to the 'Panel Review Board' and that I would be contacted by Samsung within 24 hours with a decision. So I waited. On 5/21, Samsung called me and asked if the 'Executive Customer Relations' people had called me back. I said no, I was still waiting. She advised me to call them, stating 'They won't call you'. So I did, and was told of our fate by a nice lady who had no inkling what was going on. And she told me that I could not talk with the 'Panel Review Board', because they could not contact them! She also refused to forward me to a supervisor.Bottom line: Samsung will sell you a defective product and refuse to repair it. They'll snow you with e-mails, meaningless conversations, and hope that you'll become so frustrated going in circles that you'll give up. In our case, the message is clear;:'It's not a big problem. Better learn to live with it, because we're not going to fix it'.Learn from this, people. Don't buy Samsung.Addendum: Today, 5/24/13, I received a very pleasant phone call and an email from a representative of the President of Samsung. They're going to replace the screen on our TV. She also apologized for the treatment we received. As I said, we loved the TV, but did not appreciate the problem we had with Customer Service.", "Date": "May 21, 2013"}, {"Title": "Great TV for the Price", "Author": "Snoopy", "ReviewID": "R2LQT0X2F0Q49U", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This is a review for the TV. This is not a review about the shipping service from Amazon or their customer service like many other reviewers get into.First of all, if you bought the TV while it was on sale at many retailers during November and December of 2012, and paid about $590 for it, it was the best deal that you could have gotten for a 3D TV. The picture quality of this set is great when compared to other 1080p sets within the price range of $500 to $900. The menu and set up of this set was fairly easy to handle. There are 2 HDMI inputs, audio output via 3.5mm jack, 1 Ethernet input, 1 USB input and other RCA inputs for video. Although this TV has the ability to connect to the internet, it does not have the many Samsung apps that other models have. Nevertheless, you may see some 3D previous and short videos in 3D through a Samsung interface that is already installed on this TV when you connect it to the InternetThe picture quality is very good for TV that is under $900. The 3D capability is pretty good. I already watched several 3D movies and the TV gave a very nice picture. The TV also has 2D to 3D option, which is okay. This conversion is not great since it is obvious that 2D content was not filmed in 3D. Therefore, do not expect 2D content look like a 3D movie that was filmed for 3D format.The sound is okay, it is good enough for this TV. If you really want to experience the 3D experience, you would need to connect an external receiver and speakers.Overall the TV is very good for the price. Even if you end up paying up to $850, it is still worth the price. That is, unless you find a better deal on the Samsung 40\" slim model for a better price.", "Date": "February 12, 2013"}, {"Title": "Constant defective audio", "Author": "Eric Tang", "ReviewID": "R2TF0UQ1PXRQDB", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "The only reason I give it 2 stars is because I have been able to see some movies, approximately 7 movies during the 2 month period that I have owned this T.V. At the beginning probably after watching 2 movies the sound gave out completely, no audio whatsoever. Audio still comes out from the RCA connections but who still uses them? Everything is HDMI, and the audio from none of the 2 HDMI outlets worked. Samsung and their techs took approximately 2 weeks to fix the problem. 2 weeks later the same problem occurred, this time I was disappointed and didn't want to go through the hassle of having the tech come again and who knows it might give the same problem again later. So I checked with Amazon to see if I can return the T.V. I couldn't anymore since I was 3 days passed the \"return window\". Now I just have to hope that the audio doesn't consistently stop working for me to wait 2 weeks for Samsung to fix it.

I was amazed given that this unit was $50 cheaper than the equivalent 2D Samsung.  Not sure why it only cost $499 as I enjoy a crisp, clear, fragment free 2D picture that handles action without distortion (in both sports and blueray movies).  The 3D works beautifully as well although the glasses that came with it are insubstantial (lightweight, but easily broken).  I've rated this unit with 5 stars because it provides all you need in a 40 inch LED with the added bonus of 3D.  I couldn't be happier with its performance.  My next set will be a UHD as and when the units become readily available, the broadcast technology and movie technology catches up, and the prices come down.The weaknesses of the TV are mainly focused on the inputs - only two HDMI slots and a standard 3 plug AV input.  But, I've solved that problem with an automatic HDMI switch that uses one input and moves between an XBox 360 and PS3, the other HDMI slot used for HD digital cable input.  If you want more HDMI slots, you'll pay dearly for them in more advanced models.All in all, a great purchase offering significantly more value than other brands/units with equivalent capabilities.", "Date": "December 23, 2012"}, {"Title": "Fantastic picture quality; good value for money", "Author": "ennar", "ReviewID": "R3S4JXQDTLMPK2", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "We've had it for about 2 weeks now and very happy with the purchase so far.

As some other reviewers have noted, would be best to find one of the many posts online with picture settings recommendations (e.g. check out avsforum.com). The 3D picture looks amazing. Sound is ok (I have mine routed to a receiver anyways). We didn't care for a smartTV (and this isn't one).

Morrow", "ReviewID": "R1EG03PJFU9P42", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I just bought this TV last week to replace my 7 year old 720p Samsung DLP.  What a HUGE difference! The black level on this TV is simply amazing and the clarity is excellent. ( I am reviewing the 46\" model--UN46EH6030-- as there did not seem to be a place to do so, but all features are identical to the 40\" model ). I must admit I was a bit confused as to the actual refresh rate of this TV as it is marketed as a 120Hz but the box has the 240 CMR logo on it.  After some digging, what this essentially means is that through complex algorithms taking place in the guts of the TV, the actual refresh rate--while 120Hz--appears much higher ( i.e. 240Hz like ).  I have since watched NFL games, some high-speed chase scenes and the opening space battle sequence of Revenge of the Sith with no visible lag or pixellation noticeable. The picture is --in a word--awesome.  I also fired up the PS3 and played a few games; again, no visible lag.  So for those worried that the refresh rate might not be good enough, don't worry, it is ( and I have a keen eye for these things and was ready to take it back if it didn't pass muster ).  Also, the amount of \"picture tweaking\" within the menus is quite impressive, with A LOT of settings going far beyond contrast, brightness, sharpness and the like. In fact, there are two menus available for picture tweaking that have things I am unfamiliar with so for those wondering if this TV can be calibrated I'd say \"definitely\".  The 3D is pretty cool and will even convert 2D sources to 3D. Some source material is better than others but the fact that the TV even does it is pretty impressive. This TV does NOT have Wi-fi built in ( didn't need a smart TV as I have my PS3 ) but you can buy a USB wireless dongle if you need one for updates and things ( the TV does have an ethernet port ). The remote is great in that it actually LIGHTS UP so you can see the keys in the dark !!

In any case, the picture quality is good and there is minimal ghosting, but I have seen it on shows like Archer though it is not bad enough to warrant the whole ordeal of attempting to return this.Overall, a pretty good purchase if you want to purchase from a major brand name.* If you want a good starting point, go here: http://www.amazon.com/review/R1YKDGGEK5DXQRTL;DRNO 3.5mm output2 HDMI portsSmall amounts of ghostingEnough white balance options to appease a photographer", "Date": "March 26, 2013"}, {"Title": "Good Quality TV from Samsung, Watching 3D at Home is a gr8 exp.

Bought this UN40EH6030 over the UN40EH6000 which was a bit more. I thought I was getting the same 120hz that the 6000 offered and was also getting 3D.

Its thick because its direct lit, not edge lit which I like, not much vignetting.

The TV started not turning on right away.  The red power light would blink with every click of the remote, but it wouldn't turn on with either the TV or satellite remote.  Research shows the issue is likely due to bad capaciters.  Further proof of cheaper components in this model of TV.  I had one day left in my return period and I took advanage of it.  Amazon was great in providing a prompt refund.*End of Update*We had previously purchased the UN40EH6000 earlier in 2012.  I assumed (wrongly) that this would essentially be the same TV except cheaper (I got the black Friday deal) and with 3D.I don't know if this is 120hz or 60hz.  I've seen logical arguments on both sides.  I do know the UN40EH6000 is 120hz and I think it has the better picture.  That's not to say the picture on this model is horrible.  I think it's very good - just not as good as the UN40EH6000.The main problem I have with this TV is after a few weeks we noticed the sound wasn't matching up with the lips of people talking.  We were running HDMI cords directly from the TV to the Dish receiver - no external speakers or soundbar to cause issues.  After much reasearch and trial and error, we narrowed the problem down to the TV itself.  Our satellite installer said he had seen the same issue - usually on cheaper TVs, like RCA - and was surprised it was happening on a Samsung.  He said changing from HDMI cords to Component video usually fixed the problem so we did that and the issue is resolved.  I think Samsung installed inferior parts on this model (and hid the ball on the 120 vs. 60 issue which makes me lean toward it's a 60) in order to put out a cheap 3D black Friday model that would sell well.All that stated, I can live with the TV as the picture is very good (I'd probably give it a solid 4 stars but for the lip syncing issue), but this purchase has put a black mark on Samsung in my mind and I'll be wary before purchasing another product of theirs.  If you want a 40 inch with the same dimenions and can live without the 3D, then I recommend getting the UN40EH6000.", "Date": "January 23, 2013"}, {"Title": "Not quite right", "Author": "Rich", "ReviewID": "RKJWZ4X0HBOM7", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I've tried to stay optimistic throughout these past 2 months of owning this TV, I was hoping that this TV would last me for many years, but I know I will only be able to withstand the defect of the picture for so long.The main issue is that you can see the LED array grid in the picture. Any scenes where it is dark or low lighting brings out the LED grid, I've played with the settings for hours trying to get it to go away. The best comprimise is bringing the backlight setting to about half power and increasing the brightness and contrast to compensate, so you get a less vivid picture that's a bit more grainy that it should be, like a camera with the ISO setting too high. Seeing that damn LED array grid in the background was just driving me nuts, so this is what I'll have to do to get by.Secondly, the sound is abismal. I would say catastrophically bad. It's one thing to have low volume limits or poor sound depth, but this TV outright ruins the sound by vibrating upon itself and distorting at even medium volume levels. You will NEED a theater sound system for this TV, unless you plan on watching C-SPAN with the sound low or subtitles.If I didn't get this TV for a black friday steal, then I would have given Samsung an earful and gone through the hassle of returning it.", "Date": "January 21, 2013"}, {"Title": "Not as good picture quality as my Sammy LCD.", "Author": "brel1600", "ReviewID": "R6VZZFO0X0RYR", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I had High hopes and  expectations for this TV.

How do I know? I've probably seen close to 100 different 120/240hz models in operation, and have also seen a fair share of 60hz sets over the years. The CMR 240 is a software trick to try and smooth the picture, but in the end the picture doesn't have that sharp 120 hz look. This is funny, because the TV is billed as a 120 hz on every website (except for Samsung).Other thoughts:- Decent picture quality at best, definitely not as vivid as other Samsung sets. I tried many settings published on various forums, and even when calibrated the picture is \"just ok\".- When turning on the CMR feature in the options, it does nothing but dim the screen- Sound quality is ok, it works well, no funny noises or anything like that- The 55\" set cost me $950 on BF, so the price was very fair- Having two HDMI ports is annoying, but there are many HDMI splitters out there that'll do a wonderful job- The physical TV set itself looks very nice, it's got a thin bezel and isn't as deep as I thought it would be- The 3D looks great, comes with two pairs, extra no-frills glasses are only $20 eachUnfortunately, I was really, really looking forward to having a 120hz set at home.
