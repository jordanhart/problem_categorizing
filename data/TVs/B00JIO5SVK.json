{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Works with DTV converter box & has channel lock!", "Author": "mom2girls", "ReviewID": "R1T23XHZUHHRLM", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I was looking for a remote control to control my TV, DVD player, VCR, & Digital Converter Box.  I had picked up a cheaper, smaller RCA universal remote because it said it worked with converter boxes.  It did, but it lacked some features like the skip button and the arrow buttons needed when working with DVDs.  So, I found this one.  I'm very pleased.  It has all the control buttons I need to navigate menus and to skip chapters in a DVD.  It also has a \"guide\" button & an \"info\" button to show the info that the converter box provides about what program is on and what's coming up next.  The 4 colorful buttons at the bottom do what the buttons on the converter box controller do as far as zoom/cc/signal strength, etc.  There is also an \"input\" button so when I'm working the TV, I can push that button to change between the TV showing the DVD or my Wii or regular TV.  And, the other great feature about this remote is that it has \"channel lock\" meaning you can program which device you want to respond when you push the channel button.  For instance, I need to change my channels with the converter box, but even when the remote is in TV mode, it will change the channel via the converter box instead of changing the TV channel (which I need to stay on channel 3 for the converter box to work).  This is a great feature!!  Especially great for my kids since using a universal remote can be complicated.  It also has the volume locked to change the volume on the TV and will work no matter which device button you pushed last. That is very nice.  I liked this remote so much I bought a second one so I have this same remote for both of my TVs now.", "Date": "February 7, 2011"}, {"Title": "A good remote but would need improvement", "Author": "Jack Frost", "ReviewID": "R1EXKX22XEN64I", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "This remote is actually fairly well-designed (button placement, ergonomics, ease-of use and setup) but the other reviewer is right that the power button tends to get stuck a bit. It's not horrible as it would pop out almost right away but still a bit annoying. The plastic does feel a bit thin so I would not want to drop that remote very often. However it's not very flimsy either and the overall esthetics is fairly nice and doesn't look cheap. I was able to make it control all of my the devices: a Samsung TV, a Sony receiver, a Sony micro sound system and even my XBox. Just using the codes wasn't enough; you'll also need to use the learning ability of the remote to be able to use all of the main features of the original remotes but the learning setup is quite simple and works very well. I had a bit of trouble making it learn from my Xbox remote though as it seems it would not capture the signal from it as easily as my other remotes but then again I bought the latter from eBay so it may be that Xbox remote's fault more that the RCA one - in the end I was able to make it learn everything I wanted to. I had tried the RCA RCRP05BR 5-Device Cable Replacement Universal Remote before and that one seemed a bit better in terms of build quality and it had less difficulty learning from my Xbox remote however the advantage of the RCN08GR one is, on top of being able to control more devices obviously, it allows for 5-digit codes instead of only 4 so you can re-configure the device buttons to whatever device you want and not necessarily the one marked originally on the remote. For example I'm controlling my Sony sound system using the DVR button and not the Audio one (that one is being used for my receiver). The way the codes work is that the first digit indicates the type of device so being able to enter all 5-digits allows for more flexibility. On the other hand this remote does not have a JP1 outlet so for people who are into the full programming thing (I'm not) they may still want to go with the RCRP05BR. One word about the backlighting: it does not light up the whole remote but only random sections which is kinda weird. However it does light enough buttons to remain a useful function.  In conclusion, a good remote for the price but not perfect.", "Date": "July 9, 2011"}, {"Title": "Works great", "Author": "DanH", "ReviewID": "R214M0XVGP5CIB", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This universal remote works like a charm.I have a Vizio TV, a Toshiba VCR-DVD combination, and a Cablevision digital cable box.I was skeptical that I could get a universal remote to handle not only the three units, but all the weird buttons some of them have.  The RCA RCRN06GR was able to work everything.But don't let anyone kid you, the setup does take some time and thought.  For example, I have a button on my DVD remote that ejects the DVD.  There is no such button on the RCRN06GR.  So using the 'learn' function, I put the DVD eject button on the  RCRN06GR 'exit' button.  You will probably have to do this for several buttons on your old remotes.The 'learn' function on the RCRN06GR is simplicity itself.  After you do it 2 or 3 times, you will not have to even look at the instructions, it's that fast.One suggestion I'd make is to make a list of all the buttons you do with the 'learn' function until you actually start to use and become familiar with them.  This list will be helpful at the beginning.I only have 3 macro functions set up so far, but they sure save a lot of time and keystrokes.One is to turn on the TV and Cablebox, one to turn off the TV and Cablebox, and the third to turn off the DVD and return to the Cablebox setting.  You will have to set up macros according to your own units and how you want to work them.  As with the 'learn' function, setting up macros is easy on the RCRN06GR.This universal remote is reasonably priced and works.

I bought this RCA at Walmart, and it's been working great for 3 years. There are two things however, I don't like about it.1. The back is rounded  - probably out of some \"ergo\" designer's production meeting. This makes it impossible to poke a button without picking it up. If you're on the phone, and you want to quickly mute the TV, poking a button will just cause it to tip over.2. It eats batteries quickly.Other than that, I'm happy with it.3 stars..", "Date": "October 4, 2013"}, {"Title": "2-button is not learning", "Author": "C.

The plastic is glossy and smooth and feels great in the hand, it looks nice but i'm sure it will get scratched up pretty bad.I purchased the 6-device RCA remote which IS learning.

All you need to do to turn on which ever device you are wanting to use is press the button which assigns the remote to that device.

Easily controlled multiple items and was less cluttered than the more expensive RCA remotes. By less cluttered I mean the keypad is a little simpler than some other RCA and more expensive remotes. (Seems like the more \"features\" they put on these remotes the smaller the keys and harder to use)I bought the RCA RCRN04GR for the main purpose of a replacement remote for our Roku 3. I point this out in the headline due to the incredibly difficult time I had finding any compatible remotes for roku online despite an hour of research, as of this writing!... So I hope this review helps someone on that same journey. It has everything the roku remote has except no dedicated back button (there are workarounds) and it's not a motion remote control so you can't play the roku games. For all else it works great, even has a home key that functions same as roku home key, a must for a universal remote to be used with roku. Since you can't control TV volume in your roku remote, having that on this universal remote is a nice plus. And it comes with a light up keypad button, hit the button and most of the remote keys illuminate.This remote has the roku codes included in the manual, so you don't have to search for them!... just plug in the numbers and you're golden.Can't go wrong for the price.I did deduct one star due to the directional arrows are a little harder pressing than I'd like, and most of the remote buttons are tinier than I'd like. Other than that it rocks for less than $15 at a local electronics store.Hope this helps someone and thanks for reading.", "Date": "January 13, 2014"}, {"Title": "pretty good.", "Author": "To The Point", "ReviewID": "RV68PZTSLVBXY", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Got one for my Roku XD 2.
