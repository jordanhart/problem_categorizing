{"Reviews": [{"Title": "What else do you wan for the price?", "Author": "skaughtz", "ReviewID": "RN4JWBAMKW4LP", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I recently purchased this television on sale for $300 to serve as an extra TV for my man cave bar.  Here's a quick rundown of some important points:- These TCL televisions are cheap, but don't seem to be of poor quality.  The television itself is sleek and thin and other than the location of the control buttons on the TV itself (they are arranged behind the front bezel on the right side), everything else is laid out well.  This TV comes with a two year warranty and unless I'm mistaken, they use Samsung screens.- Out of the box, the picture is clear and crisp.  Colors are bright and blacks are dark.  I noticed a little bit of a red tinge to the skin of some people, but with a little tweaking that went away easily.  In fact, it was so mundane and the factory settings were so good that I had to force myself to change it.  The brightness of the TV seems to have quite a range, but it wasn't difficult to find the right lighting for the room I have it in.- I was worried when I purchased this that it only had a 60Hz refresh rate, but the other positive aspects outweighed this one concern (40\", 1080p, LED, $300, etc...).  I have watched nearly every sport that ESPN airs on this television, and the only blur that I could notice was immediately after someone struck a tennis ball or punted a soccer ball across the field.  Even then, I could only notice it if I was looking for it and really paying attention.  I watched the O's game on it last night and I couldn't notice any blur whatsoever.  They lost, but looked great doing it.- The sound is absolutely fine for a TV this size.  I've read quite a few television reviews, and someone always seems to complain about the sound, no matter what make or model.  If you desire 7.1 surround quality from this (or any) television, buy the appropriate audio equipment.  Otherwise, in my opinion, the sound that this thing produces is perfectly fine.If you want a large screen for a cheap price, stop here.  This TV might not have all of the bells and whistles that Samsung or Sony offer, but you also are not paying anywhere near those prices, either.  This TV offers a great picture at a great price (at 40\"), and for my money that is all that I really care about.", "Date": "June 25, 2013"}, {"Title": "Review for the 50\" model", "Author": "Ali", "ReviewID": "R1OXH88NPOVWS8", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Tv arrived in great shape. Packaging was adequate and the delivery box was in great condition. I immediately started setting it up. First thing I did was install the stand. The bracket that you use to install the stand seemed like it was the wrong size at first, but then I realized the holes for the screw that go into the stand need to be aligned just right for the bracket to fit properly so all four screws can be screwed in. A little annoying but no big deal.Another thing I noticed was that the glass base has these \"smudges\" if you look at it directly from the top and shine a light on it. You cannot clean these because they are on the inside between the glass base and the bottom that they glued to the base. Disappointing at first but once the TV is set up and you are looking at it from the front, these smudges are invisible. You cannot see them at all. They are only visible if you stand right on top and look down and shine a light. So unless you have guests that are going to bring flash lights with them, walk up to your tv, somehow angle themselves in the perfect position and then shine the flash light at the perfect angle, this will not be an issue.Once the glass base was set up, I turned it on not knowing what to expect. I have read around the internet and found that these TV's have Samsung panels. If you read the spec sheet, it states it has \"Clear Motion Index 120Hz\". All TV manufacturers have their own terminology on what they call their technology that counters motion blur on LCD panels. LG uses \"Trumotion\" while Sony uses \"Motionflow\". Samsung uses \"Clear Motion Rate\" which is similar to what the specs on this TV state. I did some further digging and found that around 2008, Samsung signed a contract with TCL to manufacture panels for their TV's. So in reality, its not TCL that uses Samsung panels, but the other way around.Once I booted up the TV, it asked me a couple of questions such as choice of language and time zone and then it started searching for channels. This process was slower than I expected but not super slow. Took about 5 minutes to find all the channels. The picture looked decent but it was time to dig into the menu.It came with the latest firmware installed so thats a big plus. Some previous reviews state the previous firmware had some issues with \"TINT\". No need to update the TV since it already came pre-installed with the latest version (From May 2013). One thing I found thats buggy is that I picked the correct timezone for California but if I chose to auto set the time, the clock was 1 hour behind the actual time. No biggie. I will primarily use this as a computer monitor so it does not affect me. However, if you use it as a TV, your channel guide might show the wrong times. Simple fix is so set the time manually if the auto update shows the wrong time.Now I will discuss my experience with using it with a computer. If you want to know about the picture quality and colors etc, you can skip this paragraph and move onto the next. I hooked up my computer to the HDMI port and powered everything on. Even though the website claims its 120HZ, this might refer to TV channels only (or I may have missed a setting). My computer detected the max refresh rate at being 60HZ @ 1080P. The screen was not taking full advantage of the panel as well so I had to use my graphic cards control center to stretch the screen so it touches all four corners of the display. I only had to stretch it an inch in all directions. This could be due to my graphics card however and might not be an issue with your computer. If it is an issue, its pretty slight and easy to fix. I have had the computer hooked up to a 120\" 3D projector that does 720P all this time. I launched a couple of games to see them in 1080P for the first time and they look fantastic. I did not sense any screen lag. Specs around the internet state it has a 8MS response time and I believe this.Now about the colors and picture quality etc. First, a bit of a background for my color preferences. I own a 30 Inch Apple Cinema Display which hooks up with a DVI cable (Digital Video Interface) to my computer. Out of all the projectors/tv screens i've had, the Cinema Display in my opinion has had the best most accurate colors I have ever seen on a display. I also own an iPad with retina display which also has pretty good colors. Initially when I got the iPad, I would sometimes bring up similar pictures on the Cinema Display and the iPad and compare the two to see the difference in color. The iPad looked really good when put next to regular TV's and other displays but in front of the Cinema Display, it was slightly below the quality the Cinema Display was able to output. However, the Cinema Display I have runs for about $2500 and the iPad is around 499 so this is expected. Long story short. The iPad puts out really good colors and can beat most expensive TV's in color accuracy (In my opinion). And in the next paragraph I will explain this rant.Initially when I turned the TV on, the colors looked ok and the picture looked ok. I was not expecting much for $500 but I still had hope I found a \"deal\". I was right. I put the iPad next to the TV and played around with the settings to match the colors on screen as close as I could to the iPad and voila. Now I have a pretty good picture and it looks fantastic. The black levels on this thing are amazing and the colors are really good as well. You will not be disappointed once you set the picture. I am sure $2000+ tv's have better picture than this TV but this TV is no slouch in the picture department. I did indeed find a deal and I am very happy with this purchase. Below are the settings I use. Someone else posted settings and I tried those first but the TV became too dark and weird. I guess to each their own. These settings helped me match colors with my iPad:Brightness: 53Contrast: 35Saturation: 40Sharpness: 15Tint: 53Color Mode: NormalBack light: 80Dynamic Backlight: OFF (I kept this ON for a bit but you can see the backlight dimming on and off rapidly. Its not implemented well. This was during a game on my PC. It might work better with a movie which I have not tried yet.)Dynamic Light sensor: OFFObviously, everyone has a preference for color etc. You should play around with yours till you see what you like. Its totally doable and the screen will come close to what you find appealing.The speakers on the TV are decent. Virtual Surround sound does pretty much what every other virtual surround system does. The bass is lacking but overall the speakers are really good for TV viewing. You obviously cannot compare them to a dedicated home theater sound system. However, they do not sound cheap. No crackle or pops or anything like that.As for the cosmetics of the TV. The bezel is thin and the back of the TV (when viewed from the side) is actually thinner than I expected. The pictures of the TV do not do it justice. Its thinner than you would expect at this price point.All the HDMI ports are on the left side of the TV and so is the antennae/coaxial connecter. The power buttons etc are on the right side. The remote control is pretty simple and well laid out.Everything about this TV is good. If you have been staring at it for a while, just buy it. You will not be disappointed. In the future if you do spring for newer technology or a higher end TV, this could go into a spare room. You cant beat it at this price.If you have any questions, post them in the comments and I will try to reply.", "Date": "August 20, 2013"}, {"Title": "TV works. TCL is a headache", "Author": "Andrew Roberts", "ReviewID": "R1NH66V168G6HA", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "For the price I payed for this TV it is outstanding, highly recommend the TV. Why would I give it 3 stars though. TCL customer support is a nightmare. The originally packaging came with the wrong sized screws to connect the base to the tv. (not a wall mount, the base that came with it). I had tried calling TCL forget that. I emailed them. They actually emailed me back. After 18 (yes 1 8) emails back and forth with customer support they still haven't helped me solve this issue. After email 5 I asked if they could just tell me what size the screws are so I can go to the hardware store and buy them. They told me they don't give that kind of information out about their products. The tv works without a stand though. Just lean it up against the wall\\Never did get the correct screws. Lots of negative comments about how I should have just gone to the hardware store... It screws into the tv and the hardware store said I would need to bring the whole tv in to get screws that fit. I'm not doing that. The hole for the stand is wide enough to hold the tv in place.

I'm not an HDTV expert, but so far I've had no issues like edge bleed, dead pixels, etc with this TV.  It is big, bright and loud.  It was heavier than I expected, which I assume is due to what must be larger than average speakers, which sound rich, not tinny like my Dynex TV.  The built in OTA tuner works great; much better than my Dynex.  I'm also personally a big fan of slim bezel TV's and this TV's bevel is only about 3/4\", so it looks great.Overall, I'm very happy.  I was considering $800-$1,000 TVs and buying a $200-$300 soundbar; instead I'm got this with good picture and good sound for only $500 shipped.", "Date": "July 15, 2013"}, {"Title": "Finally, The TV I've Been Looking For!", "Author": "Bruce", "ReviewID": "R3ATWZPTVR27FG", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Let me start by saying I have not had this TV long (2 days), but it does not disappoint. When shopping for a TV you need to determine what it is you want before you begin looking, then set a budget for what you want to spend.  If you can get everything you want for the money you budget, you will be happy.  For me, I wanted between 46\" and 55\", 1080p, LED, 120hz, NO 3D, NO smart TV, Energy Star, thin bevel and thin TV.  I can't believe this TV is only $500. I was shopping every day for nearly a month, spending hours researching TVs until I discovered this one.  It seems like every large flat screen TV is either Smart/3d or both. Those options not only fatten the price tag, but also the TV itself. Anyways, for all the options I wanted it looked like I was going to have to spend between $700 and $900 to get it all.  I ordered two other TVs only to immediately cancel my order because I did not get that satisfied feeling when I hit COMPLETE ORDER. I was trying to rush buying a TV, but that is a gingerly process that requires patience. When I saw this TV I knew it was what I had been waiting for.  I don't make a lot of money. It takes me around 43 hours to make $500, so I value a dollar greatly. I'm cheap and I can say with extreme confidence that this TV is a hidden gem.  Don't be fooled by the unfamiliar brand. Look at the features and you can tell it's quality.  $10 energy rating on a 50\" is one of the lowest I've seen and that can be a big clue as to the quality of a TV. It lets you know how efficient it is. If you look at some of the cheapest TVs they have ratings getting close to $30. That's a hint for cheap components and design. Comes with a 2 year limited warranty.Negatives:I found two screws on the floor during setup and at first thought they were left over from putting the entertainment stand together. Then I realized they fell out of the TV.  Screws were loosened from either travel or never properly screwed to begin with. No damage done, but has me slightly questioning craftmanship now.  It made it to me in one piece so I'm just being paranoid.I also can't hook up my soundbar directly to the TV with a digital audio optical cable. I'm pretty sure I can hook my soundbar up through my bluray player, but haven't had time to investigate.The stand isn't swivel. If you plan to use the stand and not mount it, it's fixed in place. Not a big deal for me.All the HDMI ports are on the same side.Pros: I haven't noticed any glare yet, but that's because I'm never home during the day.  If you are trying to watch TV with the sun shining through the windows, you probably watch too much TV. I don't know if this screen is MATTE, or whatever it's called.CHEAP, 1080P, 120 HZ, THIN BEVEL, THIN TV, ENERGY EFFICIENT, 3 HDMI PORTS.  I CAN'T WAIT TO WATCH BREAKING BAD ON THIS TONIGHT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! AAAHHHHHHHHHHHH!!!!If you need to spend all your money to feel good about yourself or make your kids love you, buy a different TV. If you make less than $20,000 a year and have poor credit, buy a $2,000 projector. If you make less than $30,000 but don't want to feel like it, buy this TV! If you make more than $50,000 but appreciate money, buy this TV!

Here are some of the pros and cons:Pros:- The picture is crisp and clear right out of the box- There are different picture presets that will help you adjust the picture based on light and other things- It is very slim and weighs very little- It was only $350- It is warrantiedCons:- There are only two HDMI ports- Because it is an off brand, universal remotes are a hit or missAll in all, I am completely satisfied with my TCL.

The 40\" was an easy purchase to replace a 32\"  I have had for a few years now. I have it hooked directly to raw cable (no converter) and the picture is amazing . The tuner picks up on the broadcast HD signals  so I get PBS and local broadcast HD  without an external converter. I have one HDMI  port populated with a computer and they sync seamlessly. HBO GO  Cinemax and Amazon Prime programming pass through in HD  flawlessly, even with a wireless connection . The Tuner also displays non HD programs in better than expected resolution. Above the volume up on the remote control is a button the says PIC . If you encounter a dark picture scroll though the presets you will find one that says personal. I love to watch Law and Order but there are a lot of dark scenes (the interrogation room ) You can set up the personal button to bring up the brightness and contrast and bump up the colors, this preset will be saved.

I was not ready to drop 1k on a new one so started researching lesser known brands.  FIRST MISTAKE .  Even thought TCL makes a lot of parts for Samsung it is not nearly the same.TV arrived very fast from Amazon because they are amazing.  Set up was easy.  Picture settings needed to be adjusted, but that is no big deal. TV worked great after I set up my speakers since the sets sounds is pathetic, but I knew that going in.Fast forward to two months after purchase.  I decided that I was going to mount it on a swivel wall mount.  I followed all instruction and hung the tv and it was great.  2 days later when tilting the tv the screen goes out.  Just like that boom picture gone. I turn it off and on and same thing.  Nothing was showing on the tv including hitting volume, input ect.  I start freaking out, but remember the 2 year limited warranty it came with.  I call TCL customer service (sounds like an India call center btw). After wasting 45 minutes with the employee telling me to unplug then replug,then hit volume then this that and everything, he finally says they will have to send a technician to fix.  Honestly, I am perfectly fine with that considering the time line was 5-7 business days.  One thing that struck me as being odd is they said they would send out a part and then I would need to call back to get a technician.  Wait, how can this person in a different country possibly know what part to send or what is really wrong without seeing the tv.  This makes me believe that they have had issues wit this 40 inch model.  I receive the new part about 2 weeks after initial call.  I call the CS line again and tell thme case number and I have the part so lets send out a damn tech. to get this fixed.  Ok sir, I have now put you in the technician claims que....um what? Yes sir you will be notified in 2-3 days about when the tech. will come out.  Is this a joke?  I am about to waste a whole month with my only TV out of service and this is the best BS they can come out with.I am now furious and demanded a new TV , which they have rejected.

So far they seem to be sold mostly in China and other countries so they are little known here and therefore quite a bit less expensive. I bought a 50\" for my livingroom and liked it so for Christmas, I got my two adult sons 40 inch versions. They are great, multiple HDMI and other connections, I believe three, easy setup, simple remote and very lightweight. The weight really surprised me as compared to my Panasonic HDTV of 5 years ago. You don't need a crazy sturdy wall mount if you chose to mount them. I did buy a wall mount for the 50\" but it looks pretty good on the stand so I've left it on the stand for now. The sound is OK but for such a beautiful picture you should run it through a stereo system, a surround sound system, or a soundbar to get the full effect.

I called TCL USA and they informed me that this TV can only refresh at 60Hz, and don;t \"understand\" why I think it's supposed to be 120Hz, even the site says in the Specs 120Hz!So... now I have a tough choice to make, return and wait (without tv) and spend more on a different brand that supports true 120Hz, or to KEEP IT since it has the best darn display at the lowest price I have ever seen of a 60Hz!..The only TCL LED TV at 120Hz, is the 58\" model the TCL USA CSA told me.  One other issue is much of what is broadcasted on Dish is 1080i, and the TV shows high amounts of grain and sharpness-distortion.

For the price of this TV, I can get over it.  Also, the sound on the TV isn't great.  The difference between the volume at 25% and 75% is slight.

Not a bad pic and since everything is broadcast at 60hz anyways I don't know that the 120hz makes much difference. You definitely have to play with the color set up though to dial it in.

With that in hand we called customer support again, and were originally told that they were shipping a box so we could exchange the TV for a new one. Good news, we thought! Wrong. They called soon after and said that since it was not the ORIGINAL receipt we could not exchange it. Customer service is absolutely horrible, as is their product, and the two-year warranty means absolutely nothing. Extremely frustrating and pathetic, AVOID TCL AT ALL COSTS!!!UPDATE: I was contacted by a representative of TCL regarding our situation. The representative was helpful and courteous, and the issue was resolved in the form of getting a replacement TV (refurbished, upgraded model). I have changed my rating from 1/5 to a 4/5 due to the excellent customer support received.

Be clear though - if you have any secret hopes that this set will turn out to be a \"find\" and surprise you with a better picture than the price suggests - that won't happen. It's not a rip off. It's just a crummy little television for people who don't wish to spend much money.PROS:- It works and it's bright.CONS:- The viewing angle is poorer than I expected since I had found a review claiming it was good.- The color can't be set correctly from the user controls, (and an ISF calibration - if it's even possible - would cost more than the set). That's true of a lot of TV's, but since the digital era I've often been surprised with the color accuracy of low end sets. No surprises here.- It has a perfectly adequate user interface (menus, etc), but it's hard to use because the remote buttons are poorly debounced. You sometimes get unexpected results from it, like accidentally pressing twice on a selection. It can be frustrating.- The internal firmware is kind of \"amateur\" for lack of a better way to characterize it. One arbitrary example, (I could give many others): it has a setting that will cause the backlight to brighten and dim based on the current image. But it is implemented poorly and there is so much obvious brightening and dimming of the output that it's too distracting to use. Like many TCL features, it's in there, but it does not seem to have been implemented by an engineer who was the shiniest coin in the fountain.Summary:If you're oblivious to picture color accuracy (not being cute - many or most people are), and don't plan to watch at much of an angle, then this will give you the biggest brightest picture you can get for the money.", "Date": "July 1, 2013"}, {"Title": "Wrong Screw Size for Base", "Author": "John", "ReviewID": "R34LOFAP4QL1GT", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I received this TV rather quickly which I was very happy with.

Here is the only issue that I had. I checked the code for Comcast so that I could program my cable remote and the code didn't work. After trying a few different codes, I called Comcast and the guy said there were only 2 codes and neither of them worked, he said I would have to return the remote which I wasn't gonna do because I'm stubborn, I researched and someone said to use the codes for RCA and that is exactly what I did and the first RCA code I plugged in worked like a charm!!! I believe it was 0778 but not completely sure on that. Anyway, I adjusted the color a bit since I found it to be a bit to sharp for my liking and now its perfect!! The price on this was only $329. for a 40\" and it makes a big difference watching it versus a 32\". The sound quality is great and if you have a surround sound you can connect it.

As this experience progresses I will update this review.The TV failed in just under 4 months with the screen shutting off while in use followed by a loud \"pop\" or \"bang\" from the unit 5 seconds later and a slight burnt odor.Going to TCl's \"contact us\" page you find a simple and inviting form as well as a toll free number. The TV failed on December 24th so I wasn't expecting anyone would answer but I did expect the recording to say when they will be back from the holidays. Instead the recording simply informed \"Our offices are closed, please call back Monday-Friday between 9am-9pm EST\".So no indication when they are open again... alright. I called back again during their stated hours on December 26th to be greeted by the same message once again. Alright then... I go back to their website's contact form, fill in all the information, serial number etc. and a very detailed description of the issue, submit it... then the page finally loads and gives me this message:\"An error occurred in the application and your page could not be served. Please try again in a few moments.If you are the application owner, check your logs for details.\"Great. So I close the webpage, go back in, fill it all in again, submit it... all the page says now: \"ERROR:500\"So at this point there is no way to find out when their support line will be staffed again, and a form cannot be submitted online. Every other portion of their website works, but the moment I submit the warranty support form... errors abound after 3 separate attempts.UPDATE:After the holidays their phone support line was staffed again and I was able to get through, I gave them all of my information on the TV sent via email as instructed and was told I would receive an email back right away with my case number... 4 days later, no case number. So I called again after letting that time pass and got the same guy I talked to the first time, he gave me the case number over the phone saying he had received the email and told me he would forward the information to the returns department.A couple days later the return department called asking for my address and asked if I had the original packaging which I did. She said someone else would send an email with a postage paid UPS return label which I received a day later. So I sent the TV off the first week of January. A week later I sent an email to the same address asking how long I should expect to wait for my TV to be repaired... never got a reply.So in summary it took 33 days from the time the TV failed till it was fixed and back in my possession. I did not have to pay anything during the whole process.Hopefully my experience is helpful in some way :)", "Date": "December 26, 2013"}, {"Title": "bought one 2 years before so I needed a second ...", "Author": "steve ypsi mi \"steve\"", "ReviewID": "RP4YQBGYKYF84", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "bought one 2 years before so I needed a second one, no other one this size is close in quality and price.no hesitation bought the second one", "Date": "December 12, 2013"}, {"Title": "ok for the price", "Author": "4051kris", "ReviewID": "RJQHYSTTM6ONM", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "Ok, not enough plug ins for gaming or movies, nice picture.

Ultimately, the TCL 40 inch LED TV with 60hz refresh rate performed sub-par in two important categories:1.) COLOR QUALITY - The most noticeable flaw. I am an audio-visual guy, that's what my bachelor's degree is in, yet I really am not extremely picky when it comes to 'perfect' color/white balancing. But, this TV's colors were so poor it was to the point of being unacceptable. I'm not sure if the other reviewers are color blind, or are just buying a TV for one of their kids who just won't notice/care, but even after making many adjustments to the poorly configured picture settings panel such as the saturation, contrast, and tint, I could only fix the problem so much.- Skin tone was the most noticeable failure. Peoples' faces were ORANGE. Not even close to passable.- Whites ended up being either way to blue/cold or way to warm/yellow.- Blacks were actually decent, but I did some reading and apparently the company has to do some serious color processing after the fact to make up for what it lacks in good components.2.) AUDIO QUALITY - Weak, but passable. No one can expect amazing sound quality from the built in speakers of a flat-screen TV. I do have to say the mids where a little to intense for my liking, obviously there is little to no bass response.Overall, I gave this TV a 2 star rating because, although it didn't even come close to living up to my expectations, this TV would be PERFECT for gamers, cartoons, or animated movies. I do have to say that the brightness of this TV will beat any LCD TV, so if brightness and crispness is your top priority within a budget, this may be your TV.After being this disappointed with the orange tinge of every person's face in every single movie/show I watched, I returned it and ended up getting the 39 inch Vizio  Smart TV 120hz refresh rate. I had never gotten a Visio before this one, but decided to get it after hearing that it is the top name in LED technology right now, so I gave it a shot, and I'm very pleased with it so far.If you are at all like me and care about whether or not people have orange faces on your new TV, I would have to suggest spending the 50-70 dollars more and get a better quality TV.", "Date": "September 1, 2013"}, {"Title": "Only 60Hz refresh rate", "Author": "Todd B", "ReviewID": "R3W4Y5FJ62KP5W", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "The TLC website, the amazon listing and even the box it came in listed it as having a 120Hz refresh rate, however, the manual only states it's 60Hz and after setting it up and connecting various devices to it, the only refresh rate I ever got was 60Mz. I contacted TLC customer service and was told that it was \"capable\" of 120Hz but the fact that it was only at 60Hz was due to my devices and/or cable box settings (this is patently false). I pointed out that my other TVs which have 120Hz and 240Hz refresh rates were plugged in to the exact same devices yet they displayed their advertised refresh rates and didn't go down to 60Hz because of some phantom settings on any devices. The customer service rep. then began to read the same response back to me ad nauseum, \"it's capable of 120Hz\". If that's not enough, the picture is often fuzzy/blurry during sports (due to low refresh rate) and the colors make everyone look like garish clowns but when you try to tone it down, it often makes it worse.
