Much nicer looking frame, perfectly flat, and less glares;2. Better 2K->4K up-conversion picture quality;3. No dead pixels, no weak pixels, zero!But things turn up-side-down when I started 4K testing. When I switched to the advertised native resolution (3840x2160), all I got is a cropped, blurry image! It looks like the original 4K input has been scaled down to 2K in 4:3 aspect, and then scaled back to 4K.I tried to adjust every possible options in the menu (including every options in the service mode menu), none helped. I also tried all 4 HDMI input, none helped. I tried 4K input from three different computers (all worked with my previously returned Seiki TV), all show the same phenomenon (blurry image, cropped at top and bottom).It seems that this TV is not capable to properly displaying 4K input signal at all!Since I am quite satisfied with all other aspect of this TV, I will try to contact TCL support first to see if there is a fix to this problem. But if this issue could not be resolved, I would have no choice but return it to Amazon again :( -- 4K TV couldn't display 4K input? What a joke...------Took a picture of the TV showing at 4K (3840x2160) [...]The down-scaling of the input is very obvious -- you can hardly recognize the text on the screen!------Update: the contact page of TCL USA webite ([...] is non-functional. I typed up my issue and click \"submit\", and it shows \"loading...\" forever. Never received email confirmation that my issue was received.Kinda have a bad feeling about this... I will try email USsupport@tcl.com directly. If I don't hear anything back in a week, I will have not choice but return it...------Final update: 4 days have passed, and got nothing from TCL support. I decided to gave up waiting and return it, to avoid the Christmas shipping craze. Had the 4K input actually work, this TV would have gotten a 5-star from me... :(", "Date": "December 4, 2013"}, {"Title": "Early Adopter of 4K is very pleased", "Author": "Stephen Rawlins \"EnglandGreen\"", "ReviewID": "R360XBCT7DRWIG", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "***I added 5 pictures with notes to this review & updated the firmware.***As with all early adopters, I expect technology to improve as the latest gadget matures. That will be the case with this 50 inch TCL 4K TV. The current limitations of HDMI 1.4 (3840\u00d72160 at 24 Hz/25 Hz/30 Hz) means that this is not going to be the fastest display next year (2014). But at the astounding $750 price point for a 50 inch 4K TV in 2013, it's a bargain.Also, since true 4K source material is almost nonexistent except for a few (rather lame) 4K YouTube and Vimeo videos, you are left with so-so up converted 1080p content. All of the so-called \"4K BluRay discs\" are rubbish (in 2013) so do not waste your money. They are regular 1080p discs with clever marketing!My setup is a Sony STR-DN1040 receiver with 4K HDMI 1.4 inputs and various sources, the primary being a Generation 3 Apple TV. BluRay 1080p is provided by an unlocked Pioneer BDP-330 and Playstation 3. Additional 1080p content is via a modified Linux-based Generation 1 Apple TV with a Crystal HD card.Also connected via the Sony amp is a Apple Macbook Air and Apple Mac Mini (both 2011 models). Their max output via Thunderbolt is 1920x1080 to this TV; I have not been able to increase the resolution beyond that yet but I have SwitchResX so I will experiment further to see what I can get. <edit> The reason I could not get resolutions above 1920x1080p is I needed Accell B086B-008B UltraAV Mini DisplayPort 1.1 to HDMI 1.4 Active Adapter - AMD Eyefinity Certified (Blister Package)  so I ordered it from Amazon and I will experiment some more and report back.The vast majority of my content is via iTunes streaming, so it is neither videophile or audiophile quality by any means. However, compared to the TCL 40inch 1080p LCD LED TV I also have, it is light years better!Picture quality is absolutely fantastic but since I do not use the TV audio, I cannot comment on whether audio is any good or not. Also, it has no \"Smart TV\" apps or any other useless features, nor does it have network connectivity. These are very good things, in my opinion, as they distract from the point of any TV; a good display for your content. I experienced zero lag, ghosting or smearing even with fast-moving action films like \"The Avengers\", so I'm not sure what others are complaining about.To get the best from this TV does require quite a bit of fiddling with the picture controls to get it to look its best, but the end result is well worth it. I used THX Tune-Up (iPad software) and Disney's WOW (BluRay calibration disc) to make picture adjustments. My settings are in the Comments section below.Overall, I am very pleased with this TV. It gives me a taste of 4K and I highly recommend it for those, like me, that cannot wait for both HDMI 2.0 next year as well as true 4K content via BluRay.This is a \"living\" review. If you have any questions, I will be happy to answer them to the best of my ability in the Comments (below).***UPDATE: I updated the firmware to V8-MS39N02-LF1V024 dated Feb 12 2014.

I was curious about the firmware update, even though I am not experiencing problems, so I tried to visit their website (tclusa.com), which was all jacked up. Apparently they are using tclusa.tv now, in case anyone else is confused about that. Also, he could not confirm whether or not this TV will support HDMI 2.0 in the future via another firmware update. This is exactly the same situation as with Seiki. TCL customer service seems alright though... I was never put on hold and got a real person within a minute of calling!---END OF UPDATE---I'm not going to review every feature of this TV. Other people have written great reviews with some great tips. What I want to do is help you decide which which inexpensive 4K TV to go with - TCL or Seiki. Now, I have two other TCL LED TVs which have never given me any issues, but I decided to buy the Seiki 50\" 4K TV when it went down in price around black Friday. I got one of the used Amazon warehouse deals, so I expected an imperfect TV. Turns out, the corner was broken, the stand was missing screws, and the screen had a small line of dead pixels, so I ended up returning it. However, I did put it through some tests before returning, and I found that it had great image quality after messing with some settings, and the resolution and upscaling looked great. If it hadn't been broken I certainly would have kept it.After returning the Seiki, I decided to go with this TCL (one of the warehouse deals again) and I do not regret it one bit. This TV seems to be as good or better in nearly every aspect.DESIGN:- The stand feels much more sturdy.- The front bottom bezel is thinner and more stylish.- The bezel all the way around is slightly thinner.- I did not measure but it seems like the TV is marginally thinner overall.- The LED indicator on the TV is smaller and less obtrusive, but still looks cool.- Otherwise I'd call it a wash between the two models.PERFORMANCE:- The audio from the headphone port sounds much deeper and better for some reason. I tried tweaking the Seiki's EQ and could not get good sound out of the headphone port, but this TCL sounds great with flat EQ. NOTE: I do not review built-in TV speakers, because I never use them, and I don't think anyone should. First thing I do when getting a TV is plug in my sound system and turn off the built-in speakers, because they are always terrible.- The user interface on the TCL is significantly better in my opinion.- It has one more HDMI port (4 rather than 3).- The image quality looks about the same to me after some tweaking (color rendering, motion blur, backlight, etc.). Other reviewers have good tips about which \"features\" to turn off for better quality. Definitely turn off the energy star backlight thing, that way the backlight will not fluctuate up and down in a dark room. I have not noticed any picture issues as serious as some of the other reviewers have. Maybe just bad quality control and I happened to get a good one?- Everything else is about as good as the Seiki.So, if they are roughly the same price, I'd definitely go with the TCL over the Seiki; though if you find a good deal on the Seiki, it's a great TV as well. Both are really awesome to use with true 4K sources (i.e. my computer) and have pretty good upscaling from 1080p sources (my 3rd generation Apple TV looks amazing on both). The clarity, detail, and depth of the image is just unreal. True 4K on a small enough screen (such that you can't see any pixelation) doesn't even require 3D to look realistically deep. I just can't wait for more 4K content and distribution to come out.I'd recommend this TCL over the Seiki, but either way you go, make sure you put the TV through its paces before the return window on Amazon closes. TCL has OK customer service, and Seiki's is pretty bad from what I hear, but Amazon customer service is second to none, and they will without a doubt get you taken care of if you have problems.", "Date": "February 14, 2014"}, {"Title": "Great Deal", "Author": "Desoto D.

I bought this one cyber Monday and was very nervous about the ur chase due to lack of info on it and an unknown brand.

What a difference that made! So far I've looked at Netflix, cable tv, blu rays, and ps4 on this tv and everything looks gorgeous.I even went on YouTube and played sme 4k videos and was reminded again why I wanted to be a early adopter.Pros:- once fine tuned, the picture quality is top notch- the audio is surprisingly good (really)- loads of inputs- the tv itself looks nice, does not look cheap like the seiki model.- the priceNow the only cons I have so far:- default settings are laughable. Pls do some research and fine tune your picture- even with all my setting changes, there still is some minor ghosting from time to time.

My PC has Radeon 7700 with 2GB memory. I am running W7 64 bit. 3840x2160 is the highest resolution via a HDMI cable. I did the firmware update 2 days ago. My problems are 1. My neck is hurting. I used to have two 30\" LCD. Now I have to look up more. 2. The color is off and the words are not as clear as in my two 30\" LCDs. 3. Mouse is now the most annoying problem. My Intellimouse 3.0 has been faithful for years. Now It is wandering. I could not adjust the setting to make it as precise as it would be on a 2560x1600 LCD. Then I tried a Logitech G500s and then a Razar 2013 DeathAdder. Both are the same no matter how I adjust the DPI.Oh, lastly, when my PC is sleeping, the TCL will go \"out of signal\" for about 10 mins then it will shut off. When I come back to wake up the PC, I need to power on the TCL first before hitting the spacebar. If I hit spacebar first then turn the TCL on, all programs will be at upper left corner. I think they need to add a setting in the setting so that it doesn't turn power off even no signal.For one more week, if I can't get used to or resolve these issues (my neck, color off, words not as sharp, mouse not as precise, and sleeping), I will have to go back to my two 30\" LCDs.But for $700, it is amazing to have a 3840x2160 real estate.Oh, if you want to see how beautiful it is, download the 4k video test on youtube.com.

So if one wants to run game mode (and thus decrease the horrible input lag) they must set game mode on each and every time they turn on the monitor or change modes.I updated to 2 stars since it appears that some people use it as a TV and love the 4K. For that purpose it is fine (but the lag is still an issue unless you can get it to run at 120Hz @ 1080p - I couldn't).-----------I never intended to use it as a TV. As other folks point out, buying a 4K TV makes little sense without 60Hz support and lots of 4K content. I love the Seiki Digital SE50UY04 50-Inch 4K UHD 120Hz LED HDTV as a monitor but it required flashing the ROM the last time through so I thought I should try TCL. It is indeed bright and wonderful in every way. BUT, the input lag is horrible. Like a poor lip sync, once you notice that it takes time from the mouse to move (and stop and change direction) it drives you crazy. There is an option to turn on \"game mode\" which essentially cuts out all the processing that is slowing down the TV [and probably lowering image quality]. But there is no way to get the TV to remember. Whenever it resets the resolution it goes to being off \"game mode.\"TVs vary in term of input lag ([...] and in the list of TV (which doesn't include this exact one), TCL comes at the bottom (129.8ms for a 58\" version). The Seiki SE50UY04 is actually pretty speedy at 38.3ms, the best (Sony) at <17ms.So if you are buying a TV to use as a 4K monitor, buy the Seiki SE50UY04 50-Inch 4K and skip this one.Note: I have no ax to grind and no industry connections.

Now I have had some more experience with the set and am more aware of its flaws as well as its strong points.First, the TV itself is beautiful.  It is on par with the latest displays from other manufacturers with a thin frame and its depth is minimal, perfect for hanging on a wall.  The picture quality playing HD movies through the HDMI inputs is superb.  I tried playing basic cable through the antenna input and encountered the lip-sync issue others have mentioned, but HDMI movie playback audio is perfect.  I have not observed ghosting at all with any input.I am now using this unit as a computer monitor using a 1920 x 1080 input (DVI to VGA) and its display is much better than the 37\" 1080p monitor it replaces.  My PC graphics card is not capable of 4K output, so I have not tested that.  It is interesting that the owner's manual does not show any input higher than 1920 x 1080 while the HDMI inputs themselves are marked \"4K\".  There is definite evidence of upscaling which is not perfect and is most apparent with text.  I don't know if a scaling algorithm exists that can effectively quadruple resolution without showing some evidence of that in the display.  But at three feet viewing distance (which is very usable with a monitor this size) the effect is hardly noticeable.Overall, I am very pleased with this unit and it is working out very well for my purposes.

Better than 1080p? Not really.... since it's difficult to get any true 4K content fed to it. Now I blame that partly on TCL and partly on the fact the MPAA dimwits promoting HDMI DRM'd cable standards totally failed to provide alternative means to view your own content. Thus forcing us to go through their DRM, as if we are all criminals out to steal their content. It totally cripples your viewing pleasure on your own devices in your own home. Even the Coaxial cable would have been better, if cable companies didn't cripple it too. Because it allows greater bandwidth while at least streaming over that coaxial connection. Where's fiber Optics connections? Oh yeah they want to save that for what comes after you buy your first 4K set!But as it is, we can't even watch our own 4K content (for instance from my Galaxy Note 3). Then TCL fumbles on the fact they're knowingly forcing you to buy their upcoming 2014 4k TV version with HDMI 2.0. Meaning it's the old \"Planned Obsolescence\" Business model that HDMI standards body is pushing us all into. Buy and Replace..... and TCL unlike it's competitors didn't plan for firmware upgrade to HDMI 2.0 for this model. What really gets me about this whole HDMI Fascist Led HDMI Organization, led by the film and television industry, is the cable is the same one we've always been using. So it's all in a chip firmware upgrade. Along with fact that this vers 2.0 won't be the last HDMI revision and even the new version isn't as good as Coaxial Cable..... let alone Fiber Optics!Here's the list of complaints I have for this TCL 4K TV. Although the screen pixels are barely visible up close, it still looks muddy even on 4k pictures via USB port. That's because it's only got USB 2.0 and has a very limited line doubler instead of a full fledged scaler chip. Also the processor is extremely slow. So slow, that when you click a remote key it takes near forever for anything to react. So remote lag is terrible and remember it only has a software line doubler, instead of a full fledged scaler chip. Which also slows things down.The remote is clunky at best and the system setting firmware is so pedestrian that they barely give you what you need to get a good picture. Plus so many features missing it's pathetic. No Power Over HDMI... which my 6yo Mitsubishi 65\" set had! ....so forget about those future devices using this \"Power Over HDMI\" feature. Like with even my Google Chromecast plugged into the TV's HDMI port. It can't turn the TV on from my computer or mobile devices. So using my mobile phones can only control it after it's physically turned on, after you find the remote or walk over to it to do that! ......and you better have that remote pointed directly at the receiver eye on the set!  .....no off angles, so it's frustrating to use this remote too!Good Points? Not too many. Narrow bezel and very slim design. I have no complaints about that. But without a Mini Display port, there still is no way to get true 4K into the TV set for display. It's not very heavy at all for the size, so that's good. It works as a good 1080p monitor, but that's about it and don't expect to get 4K easily with that even.Now I was hoping the new Samsung Comcast Xfinity set top box with 4k streaming coming out in the near future, would give us another 4K feed option. Forget that.... it's Not Happening. I found out it's only for their own \"On Demand Streaming\" Service. So that was it and when I found that out, I made the decision to send this TV back to Amazon!At least Amazon is always good about returns. So I think I'll stick with a Samsung or Vizio set, I'm shopping again right now. At least until that Ridiculous HDMI Fascist Control board, finally dies or changes, so we can at least watch our own video and picture content. It'll be a long time before I get sucked into another \"planned obsolescence\" device though.
