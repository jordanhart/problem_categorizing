{"Reviews": [{"Title": "OK but leaves much to be desired", "Author": "Chad A. T.", "ReviewID": "R3P7FJPJPWU3SD", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "After doing a ton of research on LED televisions, I had decided on the M3D550KD which has raving reviews.  However, it's been replaced with a newer model.  Better right?  That's what I was banking on but have been sadly disappointed.  Let me say before going on that I don't consider myself an overly-picky person and don't have a ton of experience with LED televisions.  I'm replacing a 6 year old Samsung DLP that I've been more than happy with but it's time to get rid of that clunky thing.This really is a nice looking TV out of the box with a really nice remote.  The Visio website shows the new version of the remote with the qwerty keypad on the opposite side but it's an IR remote which means it needs a clear line of sight to the TV.  I was happy to discover that mine came with the bluetooth remote with the slider keypad so I need no clear line of sight.  That qwerty keypad sure saves time when setting up the different apps.  As for the apps, I found them to be easily navigable and smooth enough.  However, Neflix is DOA on this TV.  After troubleshooting with Netflix with no success (didn't troubleshoot with Vizio because there has been a lot of feedback already saying that they're passing the blame on to Netflix).  Their conclusion is that Vizio installed the wrong version of Netflix so they need a firmware update with the right one.  I think that will eventually happen and if this was my only problem, I'd be happy to wait for it but it's not my only issue.Vizio advertises this to be 120 hz but on closer inspection, it's 120 hz effective which means it's actually 60 hz with a little extra processing (which is a downgrade from the M3D550KD which is 120 hz with a 240 hz effective rate).  This really makes it no better than any of the other cheap LEDs out there.  I don't like this because, as with many of the faster TVs today (yes, even 60 hz is faster than my DLP), there is a certain amount of \"soap opera effect\" going on which can be remedied by turning on \"game mode.\"  However, this reduces the speed to 60 hz which is no clearer than my old 720p DLP TV.  That's unacceptable for me when I upgraded and spent $1000 on this new TV.  The preset picture settings are pretty disappointing but with a bunch of tweaking they're better.  However, I just can't get it quite right.  The colors are either way too vivid or too bleached which is just getting frustrating.  Also, at times certain parts of the picture, especially people, go blurry when they shouldn't.I must say that it's got decent blacks for an LED.  The speakers are to be expected from such a thin TV but still decent.  Also, the 3D is good, I didn't notice any artifacts or anything weird when using it.  There are a few light spots (which also is a normal thing for side lit LEDs), especially on the left side but not an insane amount that I couldn't live with.  There are plenty of inputs, I've been using two hdmi's, the optical and the ethernet.  All of them super easy to hook up with no problems.  I didn't test the wireless connection so no feedback there.After all of this, I agree with others that Vizio pulled a bait and switch on the unknowing consumer.  We thought that they'd just do a few improvements on the old model and keep making an amazing product.  This isn't what they did though.  They made a new model at a much better price point for themselves by lowering the quality of components, thus making an inferior product.  Let me say this though, I'm saying \"inferior\" when comparing this model to it's older sibling.  I definitely wouldn't say it's inferior to many of the other LED televisions out there.  It's still a good product but it needs to be at a little lower price point to make it a decent deal for the consumer.  As for me, this is going back to Amazon and my search continues.  Maybe I'll get lucky and find the original version of this guy without the \"E.\"Update:  Now that this is $100 lower than I paid for it, I would say it's more in the price point it should be.  I still think that it's just OK for a 3D LED but if you're on a budget, I doubt you'll be disappointed.Now that I've got the previous version, the M3D550KD, my suspicions have been confirmed, the new version is definitely NOT a true 120 Hz.  In all programming, the M3D550KD has a noticeably clearer picture even with the \"Smooth motion\" turned off which does essentially the same thing as turning \"Game mode\" on.  No matter what Vizio tells you, the M3D550KD is a true 120 Hz and the M3D550KDE is 60 Hz.", "Date": "December 14, 2012"}, {"Title": "Good TV with many features, for a reasonable price", "Author": "K. Woerner", "ReviewID": "R1NXEJSBSW7KHB", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I currently own two Vizio TV's, each several years old.  I've enjoyed both, though they are your basic LCD TV (not smart, LED, 3D, etc.).When looking for a new TV, price was a deciding factor.  I definitely wanted it to be smart, so I didn't need an additional box like Roku (which I own today) hooked up to it.  I use Netflix and Pandora a lot, so this was a must have.  Nothing against Roku because I love it -- but having it built in already is just easier.  Wifi setup was part of the initial turn-on procedures (you can skip if you want), so this was a snap to get going.  I did have to download the Pandora app (following a system update to Vizio Apps), but Netflix came already installed by default.Though less important, I did want the 3D capability given I have a couple movies that have 3D options.  I've never owned a 3D TV, but based on the test with Avatar 3D, I think it performed quite well.  I saw Avatar 3D in the theater, by comparison this TV did produce good image quality and 3D effects, without any blurring or stuttering.I tested this watching a Thursday Night Football game in HD, and the signal from my digital cable box was clear and responsive.  Having owned smaller TV's with less features, I can't really compare the image quality of this unit vs. something priced higher.  However, being a sub-$1k TV (when I purchased it on sale) with more than adequate quality during TV and movies (2D and 3D), I can't justify spending more for the apparent same functionality and experience.There is obviously a dispute over the impact of this TV being effective 120Hz vs. true 120Hz.  I think that is the case in many TV's today, given confusing descriptions and brand-created terms.  However, I judge by performance and not any specs.  Effective or true 120Hz, I saw no blurring/stuttering in action scenes with this unit.  Again, you can pay more for true 120Hz or even 240Hz, but its debatable if you are getting the performance that goes along with the price increase with the higher end specs.In short, this appears to be a good TV with great options for the price.  There are not many TV's with a 3D options with a sub-$1k price tag, and the addition of smart functionality is practically standard these days, so I am quite happy with my purchase.", "Date": "November 30, 2012"}, {"Title": "Do not regret purchase at all.", "Author": "LXAstud", "ReviewID": "R37XZGBB7ICPDI", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "For under $1000, I do not think you can find as quality a TV as this. Out of the box, the picture blows, which is the reason I deducted a star. Thankfully, I'm not afraid to mess with the picture settings, and I now have a picture that rivals my Samsung UN55ES8000FXZA. Had I known I could've had a similar picture as the Samsung, there is no way I would've spent that kind of money on the Samsung name. Also, I love the passive 3d. It works flawlessly, and being able to use the Real3D glasses you get at the movie theaters is a real plus.

I needed the easy return option just in case, though.At first we were annoyed. My wife commented that the picture looked strange. It was the dreaded \"soap opera effect\", and this TV does not have a specific setting to turn off \"smooth motion.\"After some research, I tried setting Game Mode on, and that fixed it. Whew! It was quite unpleasant watching Dark Knight Rises like it was filmed in the As The World Turns studio.Thank goodness for Game Mode, because this is an unbeatable price for its features. A smart TV which lets you use Amazon video, Netflix, Vudu, Hulu Plus, YouTube, some Yahoo stuff, Twitter, Skype (cam needed), FaceBook, MGo, Rhapsody ... no browser, but there is a VGA input. (You'll need to let it update to get all these apps.)And passive 3D, to boot. It may not look as high-res as active - from four or five feet away you may see thin horizontal lines - but it'll do.There are inputs aplenty: 4 HDMI, cable/antenna, component, VGA, ethernet, USB ...Connecting a soundbar: HDMI 1  is the ARC port. That lets you connect a soundbar to it via HDMI and control the volume through it (you can connect the video input directly to another HDMI port on the TV, rather than through the soundbar HDMI IN). If you're connecting a Samsung soundbar (HW-E450, in my case), you need to turn AnyNet+ on for this to work. Go to TV settings, turn CEC ON, System Audio Control ON. Try the Device Discovery. You probably want to go to Audio settings and turn TV speakers OFF. The video may vanish, but just go back and select that input. That should do it!You can adjust backlight settings manually only if you turn off the Ambient Light Sensor in advanced picture settings..Haven't gotten the ideal picture yet ... cinema mode is darker, standard mode seems to warm, vivid mode gives splotchy faces and skin (darker, pink patches on yellowish skin).Had an issue getting Netflix to play video. Called tech support and they resolved it. I've called them a couple of times and they were actually quite helpful.All told, I think we'll be keeping it.Update: sometimes Netflix fails and it goes nuts - the remote stops working.

Vizio produced a tv with amazing reviews, the m3d550KD...this is not that TV. The KDE is an entirely different television. It was rushed into production to replace the KD because it has significantly lower performance and a much higher profit margin for Vizio. The TV was so rushed, it doesn't even come with the correct parts. The TV and base are fine, but the neck is the wrong part and can't be used to connect the TV to the base. Since I can't stand the TV up, I can't even do a proper review of the TVs performance; however, if Vizio sends me the correct part I will update this review with how well the TV performs...which at this point I wouldn't expect much. Please search for M3D550KD before you purchase this TV. You will see Vizio made a model \"M3d550KD\" for about 3 months and it got great reviews. Then just prior to the holiday shopping season vizio canceled production of the KD and started pushing out the KDE. Now ask yourself this. Why would a company stop production and start a new production line on a TV after three moths, especially when that TV was getting great reviews? The answer is fairly simple, and similiar to the games some PC component manufacturers play. Make a great product, then make a s***ty product with a nearly identical model number. People will naturally think the second product is just a newer version of the earlier product since it has nearly the exact same model number...but alas it's just a trick.", "Date": "December 10, 2012"}, {"Title": "Previous reviews were right on the money.", "Author": "Amazon Customer", "ReviewID": "RC4OKJYDZ6QYN", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Set Picture to Game and, in my case, bump the color up to 70 and you get a perfect picture.

Serbin", "ReviewID": "R2644BBGMT13CX", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I ordered this TV on a early Friday morning. It was in my living room late Tuesday morning only because Monday was President's Day. The price dropped $131 from the time I added it to my wish list to the time I ordered.I am replacing a 6.5 year old Sharp 42\" Aquos. The Vizio is like 1.5 inches thick as opposed to the 5.5\" of my Sharp. I was almost afraid to install wall mounting bracket screws. No only is is slim, is is rather light weight as well. I am amazed that there is no flex to it and that something this slim and light did not shatter the glass during shipping.Setting up the TV was rather simple. There was no problem connecting to the Internet, I was able to adjust the picture to my preference and the sound, ah the sound, amazing from such a slim unit. It puts my old Sharp to shame.I have not tried the 3D feature yet. When I do I will update this review. The 4 pair of passive 3D glasses is a real nice touch.The only real concern I have is that there is no physical On/Off switch! I hope that the remote is far more durable than it feels. I like the slide out QWERTY keyboard. I have small hands and have no trouble typing on it.I was able to add and remove Apps at will. No problems there either.The only negative I can list now is that the picture looks a little 'soft' even with DISH HD. It lacks a tad of crispness that my Sharp was producing. I will play with the controls a bit more to see if this can improve. This is my first TV with a 120 mega hertz refresh rate and I have read in many placed that it can produce a bit more 'soap opera' effect on programs than the good old 60 mega hertz of days gone by.I would have given this TV 5 Stars if it had a physical On/Off switch. I guess I am just a bit old fashion and like that one button. Otherwise there are enough HDMI ports and inputs to hook up just about anything you can throw at it.VIZIO, is a great value brand and appears to be making nice quality products. i don't know about durability, but if it can match my 2007 Sharp Aquos (which still works fine) then I will declare VIZIO a top tier #1 vendor along with Samsung, Sony and Sharp. Yeah, it appears to be that good, at a price the others can't begin to match. Great bang for the buck.UPDATE #1: Thanks to a comment left, I did find the power button. It's on the right side. A small button on the back among others. However there are labels but they are in black as well.I bought a Vizio 3D Blu-Ray player. Hooked it up to the TV and the screen had problems properly displaying the 3D picture.  I called Vizio at 3:15pm on a Saturday afternoon, they close at 4. The rep was most kind and helpful. Turns out that I just needed to eject the disc, and load it again. The 3D worked just fine and I must say the quality of the 3D is superb. Vizio uses passive 3D, the kind used in movie theaters. I was very impressed with Vizio's USA based customer service.The screen is glossy, very glossy. it's almost like having a black mirror. The blacks in the picture are some of the deepest black color I have ever seen on a TV. I guess this is an advantage of LED backlighting.While I was taking to the CSR at Vizio I decided to check out the extended warranty. They do offer a it via Square Trade. I took out a 3 year plan for $89. I am waiting for the full details to sent to me. With a TV this size, I thought it would be worth the expense. I have only bought one extended warranty before on my first MacBook, and used it once. It more than paid for itself. I would recommend a 3 year plan as most TVs will exhibit problems within this time period. The extended plan also has service tech come to your place. No bringing in sets of this size for service. That's a good deal.HDMI port #1 is not working.  I use a Sony Home Theater in a box system to add 5.1 channel sound to the TV. I noticed that the Sony can not pass through a 3D signal to the TV. Everything else about the Sony works fine with the Vizio.The set offers Skype. However only a Vizio web cam will work with Skype. My Logitech 9000 will not be of use. The set would not recognize my Pandora sign in. I'll keep working on that.At the end of week one, I have no overall regrets. While the screen is far more glossy that I would like, it does offer very deep black color and is the right size for 3D viewing. The viewing angles are wide with virtually little loss of picture quality.UPDATE #2: I got in touch with VIZIO customer service about the non-functional HDMI port #1. They had me run some diagnostic tests, but they did not resolve the issue. VIZIO shipped a new unit to me, the delivery company took my broken unit off an entertainment stand, hooked up the replacement to the stand and made certain that everything worked before they left. I had been a Sharp LCD buyer prior to this VIZIO, but due to the customer service and that they stand behind their products, I will be a VIZIO customer for years to come.The 3D is amazing. I got a copy of Avatar and the 3D effects are simply stunning. No problems with the screen being too dim or any artifacting in the picture. Simply amazing 3D.Netflix on the VIZIO works like a charm.  It's actually a better experience on the 55\" TV than using my Apple TV box. When watching a series, like House of Cards or Archer, one episode ends and the next one starts. With the Apple TV I would have to go back to the series menu, select the next show, hit the control button a few times and the series would start playing. With the VIZIO app its just automatic.

The other issue I had was the \"Soap Opera Effect.\"  If the odd smoothness bothers you, just go into TV Settings and turn Game Mode \"On.\" (If you change the game mode in the picture settings of the TV...i.e. the mode that changes the color, etc, it will not help, you have to change it in the main setting area).

I have no complaints.  There is one minor thing that may bug some people however.  It seems the TV automatically adjusts for low light, and bright light scenes.  If there is a scene that is between the mark of low vs bright light, you can see the black bars on the top and bottom of the screen flicker a bit as the picture is changing.  This is not a deal breaker or even a big issue for me.

I researched settings for the TV online and then changed the settings to those recommended but with a few additional tweaks. What a difference that made. Just a beautiful picture. The depth of color and clarity make for a really superb viewing experience.The 3D is also very, very good. It is not quite as sharp as in the movies, but is more than acceptable and a really fun feature.Unfortunately there isn't too much 3D content on the air or cable at this time, but I'm hoping that it will improve as time goes by.A real plus is that a non-active 3D system is used and the same type of glasses you use in the movies will work with this TV.The internet setup was very easy and I had no problems connecting with my wi-fi setup.  At first the Netflix app didn't work but I understand that the incompatibility has been solved and it is now working.  The selections of included apps is very nice, but I wish that a web browser would be available.The audio is clear and very powerful for a flat panel TV.

The TV has received two software updates since I purchased it and the menu system is much smoother and a few of the smart apps have been upgraded.  I started having a flickering issue on the screen in December and eventually the TV had trouble turning on at all.  I contacted Vizio customer service and described the issue.  They had me try a couple of troubleshooting methods but neither of them were successful.  They immediately shipped me a brand new replacement without even sending anyone to look at the TV first.  The new TV arrived in less than a week and the delivery company took away the old one and set the new one in my theater room.

We received our set on 1/8 and, as some others have experienced, Netflix would not load.  We could sign into our account and see our queue, but could not play any of the movies.  It took several contacts with Vizio, by email and phone, but I'm happy to say that as of today, the issue has been resolved (at least for me) with the latest firmware update. I still don't understand why it should take ten days to receive an over-the-air update that has been out since December.  Now that it's been fixed, we are completely happy with our purchase!Anyway, this was an upgrade for us from our Vizeo 37-inch flat screen that we'd had for about 5 years.  We're blown away.  The picture quality was fine for us, right out of the box.  Haven't even played around with all the custom settings.  The 3D works great, love the passive glasses.  We tried active 3D in a local store, and didn't like it as well.  That's probably subjective, and I would suggest trying both styles before making a decision, as I know others who definitely prefer the active.  If you have Directv you have access to four 3D channels, plus there's 3D programming available through some of the apps.You are limited to 17 apps at a time, but you can change those up if you want.  Plus, you have the ability to create different profiles, allowing different family members to have access to their preferred group of apps.The remote is bluetooth as well as IR, so I was able to link it to the DTV DVR and use it as a universal remote.

This IS a phenomenal 55\" TV set for the money.The only criticism I have is the Bluetooth Universal Remote.  I could not get it to work quite right with my external, HDMI connected devices; the cursor, enter, and audio volume controls worked with my Apple TV, Xbox 360 and Vizio Soundbar, but I was not able to get each of these devices' Power On/Off to work from the Vizio HDTV's remote control. Perhaps, because these older devices do not support Bluetooth, but then why do they work at all?  However, my Sony 3D Blu-ray DVD Player worked flawlessly, so it must also be using a Bluetooth remote.  Of course, it would have nice to retire all my other remotes, but no such luck.  In Vizio's defense, I have had the same type of issues with every other home electronics device known to modern man when it comes to \"universal\" remotes.This Vizio is incredible thin (and lightweight at ~55lbs).  I was able to manage it myself from the store to the back of my SUV and all the way home into my family room without assistance.  Even attaching the stand was a snap, although at first I thought it was missing from the shipping box.  Alas, it was there all along.Internet setup was also a breeze, although having my security password written down for future access was essential.  With my DSL WiFi (\"N\" type) Gateway upstairs at a distance of about 10' verically (thru the ceiling), I received a signal strength of \"5\" bars.  Excellent!I have not yet tried \"3D\", but that is next on my list of things to do with this HDTV.  I have only purchased a couple of 3D Blu-ray DVDs; the new TRON movie in 3D being one of them.  That movie was a disappointment, so I think I will try to stream Avatar or maybe Titanic in 3D from VUDU and see how that goes. There is an Internet data rate test under the \"Network\" menu options, which is useful to determine if streaming a movie in \"HD\" will work without dropouts.  The best test result I have obtained is right around 4500 Kbps which is minimally adequate.  I cannot get a DSL ISP with a download speed higher than 6.0 Mbps where I live, but my other, smaller Vizio 3D HDTV uses the same WiFi connection and usually works fine even in VUDU's highest quality resolution \"HDX\" movie format, so this 55\" should work just as well..Again for the price paid, Vizio makes very high value and quality Smart 3D HDTVs.  I recommend paying a little extra for 3D feature for \"future proofing\".  Arguably, a \"3D\" HDTV (even if only ever watched in 2D) is technologically superior, and at the very least, often purchased for the bragging rights alone.", "Date": "April 1, 2013"}, {"Title": "The KDE IS NOT Equal or better than The older  KD model", "Author": "W.

Pretty sure picture is inferior in direct comparison.  Not sure bedroom TV is worth the extra $250-300 but I am perplexed why Vizio would cheap out.  They still had market edge for that size class at $100 cheaper than competition. I'm sure they figured they would sell a ton more for under $1000 with less features.Addendum: after a few weeks of viewing and almost direct comparison (the 2 TVs are in different rooms) I think the image is the same on each.  The motion settings are absent from the KDE but for me this is fine because I turn it off on the fast motion (240hrz) models because I do not prefer the soap opera effect.I had to re-rate this higher because I think it has a very  good image with stunning 3D using plain theatre glasses for the price and size.

If you make sure that your stand/mount is tilt-adjustable, this isn't a significant problem.The big annoying problem is the local dimming effects.  On dark screens, like the windows boot-up logo, the local dimming flickers distractlingly.  It's even worse if you have the 3D glasses on.

I also play video games, have a Google TV (the Logitech Revue), stream Netflix and such.  Our television gets a lot of use.  So when our 56\" Samsung DLP died on us (the second time in a year), I started looking for the best replacement I could find at a reasonable cost.I'd recently found out that Vizio was manufactured in the US (California).  Having worked at Best Buy for 12 years, I wasn't as familiar with the brand (we didn't stock them in the stores, and they were commonly thought of as a \"cheap Costco product\"), but I read more and more great reviews.  And then a friend loaned us an old Vizio LCD to use while we were in-between sets.  It was older, but certainly a nice TV.I decided on LED because I wanted the brighter backlike, and I knew that, if I was going to make the investment at all, I wasn't going to go less that 120Hz.  The 3D aspect isn't something we're interested in at all, but I do like that the (included) glasses are for passive instead of active viewing (active give me headaches and eye strain).We did have a problem with the set initially, in that it kept not getting a signal on various inputs after a period of use.  It turned out to be a bad internal board, but Vizio's support was tremendous in helping me get it resolved (both online and the person who came out to do the repair), and we haven't had a single problem since.I use the apps on the TV more and more, especially the YouTube one, as it's often snappier than the Revue at this point.  We have strong wifi in the room, but I tend to prefer a wired connection when available (I use a powerline adapter).  And the screen is just lovely, much sharper than our old HD TV (LED vs. DLP will do that for you).My overall experience has definitely changed my (mostly uninformed) opinion of Vizio, and I would certainly put them at the top of my list for TV choices in the future.

The 3D is fantastic. The kids love it. It was fun watching my youngest child trying to reach out to the stuff in front of him. Another nice thing is this TV is flicker free, that means no batteries for your glasses. If you ever have to replace your 3D glasses they are cheap unlike the flicker style which will cost you over a $100. The color on the TV is great as well. The only thing I would knock is the remote. It flips out a keyboard that feels a little flimsy. It works good as a universal, runs my Hopper DVR just fine. Just seems to be missing something. I don't know, maybe I just expected something fancy. Great TV, the 4 HDMI slots are nice since I seem to have all these extra devices that run off of it now. This is my 3 HD TV, the best I have bought so far. It is also my second Vizio, Vizio has not let me down yet", "Date": "March 24, 2013"}, {"Title": "Excellent TV with superb features and picture. Great value for the price range!", "Author": "B Lael", "ReviewID": "R197C5UKWMCVEG", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I spent many hours researching televisions and the Vizio M3D550KDE is tops in its price range.After reading reviews and specifications for many LED and Plasma TVs in the 50-55\" category, I settled on the M3D550KDE (and I'm glad I did). There were some negative comments on the speed and reliability of the internet apps (Netflix, Hulu, VUDU...) on this TV, but as far as I can tell, these glitches have to be related to internet connection speed. I have a 30MB internet connection and the apps perform flawlessly, even wirelessly.So far, the only slow response related to apps and remote response time that others mention seem to be shortly after initial start-up. If the TV is turned on and allowed to \"boot\", for lack of a better term, there is no remote lag and the apps are not alow at all. I was able to reproduce remote and lag time by using the remote to navigate immediately after the television was turned on. As with most televisions, the picture quality is dependent on the source. With quality source material, I have yet to encounter a poor picture. That said, I did tweak the picture settings from the factory defaults to obtain the best picture. None of the factory presets for \"Movie\", \"Sports\", \"Golf\" etc. provided the best overall picture.Overall, this was a great purchase.", "Date": "April 15, 2013"}, {"Title": "VIZIO TV!

It quit working on the third day. After speaking with 3 different customer service representatives, I finally spoke with a technician who was able to help me correct it. They really should inform the customers on how to disable that function if you're not going to need it, before it messes with the remote. Anyway, after that it seemed to work just fine.Then, while watching normal TV channel reception, I was noticing that occasionally, I was getting these white alternating lines on the top of the screen (\"Transmission Bars\"). (There is a 1 minute video I filmed so you can see what I'm talking about). I also checked on both of the 21\" Vizio TVs and saw it was happening on them as well! I didn't have this problem the old Vizios that I just replaced. I know that this is just a minor adjustment to the size/position control. BUT when I went into that option I discovered that I can only control these settings on the HDMI input and the RGB input. So. I called the customer service line. I couldn't get anyone to understand my problem. First they told me that it was a problem with the equipment I was playing. When I told them I wasn't using any, it was just normal TV reception, they told me to hit the zoom button. This would cut too much on the surrounding scenery out of view. THIS WAS NOT ACCEPTABLE! Here is an example of an adjustment I could have made myself, but have been denied access! I asked the representative to speak to a technician but was unable to talk to one.I was also disappointed in the fact that the Guide button on the new TVs will only let you look at what is currently on. Instead of being able to to find something to watch that's coming on next, Now you have to wait until after the hour/half hour to see what shows are playing at that time. It sort of makes the guide kind of useless. I was not to happy to see that a lot of the commonly used functions were now only in the menu screens. It was nice to have direct access before. Not everything needs to be in the menus! I know everyone is trying to find ways to cut costs, but cutting too much stuff lowers to desirability of the product!On February 1st, I sent letters to the VP and the CEO of Vizio in Irvine in hopes they could help me with the transmission bars and maybe re-instate some of these lost features (like the guide button) for their future TVs. On February 16th I received a call from someone at Vizio. But, to my dismay, this person could do nothing for me. I'm not even sure I know why he called me!  I told him that apparently I would be looking at someone else's TVs when it came time to buy new TVs.In closing, I really like the picture quality of the Vizio TVs. I've compared them to MANY other brands. I believe that they have the best picture reproduction without spending thousands of dollars. But if they continue to try to save a dollar here and a dollar there, the product, and subsequently, the customer will suffer. And now I am stuck with 3 Vizio TVs that have these transmissions lines on them. I hope they will correct some of these issues so I will be able to purchase their products again in the future!", "Date": "February 18, 2013"}, {"Title": "NetFlix doesn't work", "Author": "Volkan Berksoy", "ReviewID": "R1G8KR64B8VD0S", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "NetFlix application doesn't  work with VIZIO M3D550KDE; Vizio & NetFlix working together to resolve the issue!!!

It was actually a very convenient way to purchase a TV.  The purchase price was the best deal I could find anywhere online.  I did my research and this model Vizio had the highest rating for picture quality in this price range.  I previously owned a Sony rear projection that I paid three times as much for and it only lived for 5 years.  The picture quality of the LED exceeds what I expected and the sound is good.  I am a technology amateur and I discovered that no matter how Smart the TV is, it is only as smart as the operater trying to set it up.  But I did manage set up by reading instructions and a few phone calls to Vizio and my satellite and internet provider.  Anyway, that was my only glitch and my situation may not be the same as others.  Otherwise extremely satisified with this purchase!!!", "Date": "February 6, 2013"}, {"Title": "Awesome Deal", "Author": "D.

Barton watched avatar look just as good as it did in the theater. Picture is stunning with HD content, however the cable box hooked up threw coax cord looks only OK, as my older Polaroid 46' looks way better with the same setup. On the whole, the bang for the buck is definitely there, and really can't go wrong with this TV! Also Vizio is a great brand, and the smart hub I works effectively, gets the job done without being flashy or extravagant.  Certainly recommend this TV!", "Date": "March 25, 2013"}, {"Title": "Muy bueno", "Author": "Hugo Centeno", "ReviewID": "R3B2W8GL7EWC7V", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Recomendado excelente televisor  m\u00e1s y m\u00e1s y m\u00e1s  s\u00faper bueno en todo momento comp\u00e1renlo esta en una s\u00faper oferta ....", "Date": "March 20, 2013"}, {"Title": "I Have The 240hz Class - Five Star", "Author": "Mike Mora", "ReviewID": "R2YNHSY8PYCLWK", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I bought the 240hz class VIZIO M3D550KD.

I had just purchased the BETTER unit (from Best Buy, for $300 more), and when I searched for the user guide that might confirm how to mount it on the wall, etc., the search results listed AMAZON's $868 price - so I bit - clicked on it and did not see that it had an extra letter on the end.  My IT/Computer expert buddy says that the quality of the \"E\" version is very inferior to the \"no E\" genuine version.  Vizio, Amazon, or both of them need to fix this to avoid misleading customers - they need to make MUCH more clear that this is NOT the \"no E\" version, and that instead it is a much inferior version.  A hungry class-action atty may already be pursuing claims for this deceptive marketing.  BOTTOM LINE:  I am returning this \"E\" version and going back to Best Buy for the \"no E\" version.  NOTE:  Amazon's customer support was VERY helpful in connection with both this complaint and my return of the TV.UPDATE - looking into the situation further, it appears that the first \"bait and switch\" was by Best Buy.  In store, I asked them for the \"no E\" version (at the time, I did not even realize that there WAS an \"E\" and a \"no E\" version.  Without alerting me, they sold me the \"E\" version.
