Reading all these reviews helped sway my decision. I also really wanted a Plasma as I don't like the picture quality of LED/LCD.The TV is ginormous, and I love it! There is minimal branding - only a small LG logo on front. I like the minimalistic design. There are only 2 HDMI ports but I don't care as I use one for cable box (which will go into XBOX eventually) and the other for a Sony Blu Ray player which also streams Amazon Prime, Netflix, YouTube, etc.Once you get your TV consider configuring it to the following: Aspect Ratio: Set by Program Energy Saving: Off Picture Mode: Expert 1 Contrast: 91 Brightness: 48 H.

Paddock", "ReviewID": "R34YV5FZ8LGVS2", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "So far TV is great!  This will be my 4th 60 inch tv in about a month, first was LG LED-couldn't handle dark scenes(screen was fading in and out from really dark to really light) 2nd was a Samsung 60 inch plasma, great picture but terrible buzzing that could be heard from far away.  3rd was Vizio, cool smart tv with overall great picture but had really bad uniformity issues when there was a dark scene, you could see these light spots around the edges of the screen that extended towards the middle of the screen, very annoying and distracted from what was on the screen.  So here we are 4th tv, I am not interested in a smart tv, all I want is picture quality.  So far this tv is great, I set it up with the THX optimizer program (if you buy Terminator 2 on Bluray it has that program on it, I picked it up for 5 buck on amazon). I also use the website \"picture perfect TV\" which steps you through all the picture settings to get the optimal picture (according to them).  I like their settings and think they look great.  This is their website [...]  Picture quality is great, black levels are really nice and there are no uniformity issues (light spots on dark screen) .  There is no buzzing sound coming from this plasma tv, which is what made me take back the samsung.  You can watch this tv from any angle and it looks great, I noticed the Vizio would wash out pretty bad at different angles due to it being an Edge Lit LED.  This tv handles darkness very well, it doesn't fade in or out during dark scenes in a movie.  Colors on this TV are nice and vibrant, again, picture quality is great.  2 HDMI ports is kind of a bummer but you can buy a 10 dollar switcher here on amazon to bump that up to 4 total so thats not really an issues.  The TV has a color wash program so if you accidentally leave something paused for too long or watch ESPN with the ticker going across the bottom of the screen all day you can run this program to \"was away\" anything that is burnt in.  It also has a pixel \"orbiter\" mode which will shift the picture on the TV about every 2 minutes to avoid burn in.  You can really only notice the orbiter if you are watching a still screen.  From everything I have read plasma burn in isn't really an issue anymore, you have to do something extreme to cause it, like leaving your tv on and paused for a week.  As far as picture quality goes, plasma is the way to go, I have read and watched plenty of expert reviews that say plasma cannot be beat and I believe it.  Out of the box the 2 plasmas I have bought have looked way better than the 2 LED's(which are really LCD tvs lit by LED lights but they call them LED TV's because they sound newer and can charge extra $$$ for them).  Sound quality for this tv is pretty good for being a flat screen, not much bass but that is how tv's are nowadays, you will need a surround sound system or sound bar to really enjoy your movies.  We pull the shades in the room that the tv is in to reduce the glare.  This tv does have a mirror like look to the screen when the tv is off so it is way more reflective then the LCD LED tvs.  This would probably be the only deal breaker for me, if you are putting this TV in a room that has lots of sunlight in front of the TV and you don't have any shades to pull. I personally could not enjoy the tv that way, because when we open the shades the glare is pretty bad, you can literally see yourself in this TV, so you either need to invest in some blackout shades or only watch tv at night!  That would be the only negative to this TV so far. It is really slim (looks as slim as the LCD LED TV's) but it still way heavier.  I think this TV is around 98 lbs where the LED tv's are around 60.  One more thing about LED tv's, another one of the things that are attractive about them is they are the most energy efficient, but not by much.  Most new Edge lit LED tvs this size use about $14-$25 PER YEAR according to the energy star sticker on the TV.  This TV uses $34 PER YEAR so to me that is still pretty great.  It gets a little warm when its on but it doesn't put off heat like old plasma tv's used to.  To me $34 PER YEAR is a non-issue.  I bought this from amazon.com for$750 free shipping no taxes, it was a great deal!  The company that delivered the TV was JB Hunt and they did a great job.  They called 2 days before the TV was going to be delivered to setup up a delivery time, and then they called 30 minutes before they arrived.  The guys unboxed the TV for me and put the stand together, and put the tv on my TV stand, all at no cost to me!  They asked me if I wanted to keep the box because they would haul it away for free but I said yes, I will keep the box.  The original box is the best way to transport your tv, whether you are moving or sending it back because of a defect.  In summary I will say it again, picture quality is great, that is my #1 concern and so far no complaints!  I will update this review if it starts doing something strange.UPDATE 9-2-2013Apparently all LG TV's have a very annoying \"feature\" that cannot be turned off.  The LG LED TV I bought and this LG plasma do the same thing.  If you set your brightness settings to less than 50 your screen will turn off when it is an all black screen.  Let me explain.  The best example I can give is opening credits to a movie (one  name in white letters displayed on an all black screen.  When the movie will slowly fade from one name to another the tv screen will turn off in between names.  This is not really noticeable during the day but at night it is pretty distracting.  You get a TV off to TV on kind of flicker on the screen.  I researched this problem and it sounds like LG tv's do this so that the company can boost their contrast ratio numbers.  When you think about it TV OFF is the ultimate black level so they can legally boast very high contrast ratios.  It is also very noticeable between \"fade to black\" scene changes during a movie.  I have contacted LG about this problem and they just tip-toed around the problem, they just told me to upgrade the firmware on the TV, when I asked them what was included in the upgrade they said we can't divulge that information, didn't know I was dealing with the FBI of flatscreen companies, I have a feeling it was a more \"important\" way of saying \"we don't know.\"  I know an easy solution to this problem would be to set the brightness back to 50 or above, but due to the room my tv is in, that is way too bright and really washes out the picture.  That being said we will be keeping the tv.  This is not a big enough problem to return it and for $750 this is a pretty small problem compared to others I have experienced.", "Date": "August 15, 2013"}, {"Title": "Awesome Plasma!", "Author": "Osirus", "ReviewID": "R1EE0N2UPHXBSW", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I just bought this TV yesterday and it's definitely a beast!

Purchasing an HDTV, much like purchasing other expensive electronics like a cell phone, is a very personal decision.  I tend to like plasmas more than LED-LCD technology, but the technology is getting so good that I definitely considered both this time around.  With that said, I ultimately bought this LG model for the \"bang for the buck\" factor.Pros:- Cost: For a sub $1,000 600hz 1080p plasma, it can't be beat.  Like other reviewers, I paid a lot less for this TV locally than I could find anywhere on the web, so be sure to shop around.- Picture quality - with a little tweaking on initial TV setup, the picture comes alive.  I've tested the picture with Blu-Ray, streaming Netflix and Amazon Instant Video on my Roku, and normal HDTV cable via a basic HDTV Comcast cable box.  Picture quality is consistent and true to form.  I won't be using this TV for video games, so I can't speak to picture quality there.  Blacks are very \"true\".  Watching movies on this thing is making for a great theater experience.- Form factor - the TV is incredibly thin for a plasma; I cannot wait to mount it to my wall.  It is not noisy at all either, and it's designed for the minimalist in mind.  The TV stand pivots left and right as well.- Customizability - great for those that like to tinker with advanced picture settings, in addition to others.  I'm very surprised at the amount of options the user is able to adjust.- Plasma - no issues with shadow or flashlight effectsCons:- Glare: I would not recommend placing this TV in well-lit, or even modestly-lit rooms.  It is best watched with the lights completely off.  The screen does not have any anti-glare capability, and any hint of light will project on the screen unless you are viewing from an angle that does not entail the projected light.  This is an unfortunate, but fairly standard issue with plasma screens, although I typically find this issue in LED-LCD screens as well (just not as prominent).- No SMART functionality (no built in apps, etc.)Other:I cannot comment on the sound, as I don't use it (I have a 5.1 surround sound system).  Also I won't list minimal HDMI inputs as a negative, since I run everything through my HDMI-based receiver.  While I've only owned the TV a week, I have not experienced any of the issues that others have reported.Overall:An incredible value.  This is basically a gigantic monitor that can hang on your wall; ideal for those that have everything else (A/V components, streaming device, sound system, etc.) and for those who do not care to pay the extra options that typically come standard on a TV these days.  I ultimately see myself keeping this TV in the rotation for my home; eventually phasing out my older two models (42\" plasma and 52\" LCD models) completely and buying something new again in a few years, since HDTV technology continues to rapidly evolve.  Coming from a 52\", this TV has completely transformed my living room (about 19' x 15' in size) for the better when it comes to in-home entertainment.Bottom Line:BUY THIS HDTV if you are partial to plasmas, you have a sound system or sound bar, and you prioritize size and picture quality.

On-line, at \u201cThe Big Screen Store\u201d, Target, Best Buy, everywhere.  I looked at Plasma and LED TV\u2019s and I looked at everything from 52 to 60 inches.  I was in the market for a new one after my Samsung 50 inch plasma died on me (see my review on that if you\u2019d like).  This TV came up time and time again as a great minimalist TV.  So I eventually bought it... The one negative I have for this is the input/output scheme.  The TV only has two HDMI ports on it (which is not a big deal for me personally as I have a Blu-ray/sound system that handles two inputs also, but for anyone reading this be warned) and the fact that your only audio output is the optic audio port.  So that is a little on the annoying side but not deal breaker.  Moving forward.  There are many positives about this TV.  First, my previous TV was the 50 inch I had before.  Maybe it never dawned on me til I saw it at my house, but the 60 inch is huge, and it looks even bigger due to the sleek design of the thing.  It has minimal signage, and the border is minimal around the TV as well.  The stand is simple, the power controls are on the same side of the TV as the input/output jacks, and everything just flows together very seamlessly.On to what really matters, the picture quality.  Odds are if you are buying a plasma, you have either A owned one before, or B heard that they offer superior picture quality and refresh rates.  All of which is absolutely true with this TV.  The plasma contrast ratio\u2019s beat out just about everything I have seen.  Out of the box, this TV picture quality is about average for most TVs out of the box.  I spent about a half hour tweaking and changing the various parts of the overall picture quality.  Ended up landing on the following settings:Aspect Ratio: 16:9Energy Saving: OffPicture Mode: Expert 1Contrast: 90Brightness: 51H. Sharp: 15V.

There is virtually no motion blur or anything even resembling it.  This TV looks great for sports, games, and movies; and for the price, it\u2019s virtually unbeatable.

I decided for this UNsmart LG and all I can say is it's the best decision I made in all of last year.* If you have an endless supply of money, of course this review is not worth reading. If you are a regular middle class person looking for a good (should I say great) quality TV please read ahead.I spent hours researching the right TV. My requirements were pretty simple : A great picture quality. I usually don't care for the bells and whistles, so I need a plain simple TV with a great picture quality, but I wanted to keep it as close to a 1000 as possible. I made the decision between Panasonic Plasma vs Sharp LED vs this unit. I am just so glad I did. It cost me ~800.Kudos to amazon for the low price guarantee. I had it ordered and the price fell 50$ and they just refunded it to me.Who should buy this- If you have a lot of smart equipment at home (console, bluray player or satellite receiver etc.) and don't need a smart TV, but just a great picture to run all those smart babies- If you are a quasi-videophile but don't have a very deep pocket- If you can live with only 2 HDMI portsThis is an amazing screen.

The choice between plasma or LCD/LED wasn't a big deal for me.  Unless I was going to great a great deal & black levels with LED, plasma was always my first choice.  3D I didn't need as well as all the smart features as I already have that with my blue ray player and PS3. So skipping these features, specially if you already have them can save you a few hundred dollars.  Most of them are useless as well.  Skype would have been the only real feature that I would have preferred built in.  Since I have a home theater PC connected to the tv, that certainly wasn't a deal breaker. So ultimately I was looking for a big screen, with great picture quality & black levels at the cheapest price I could find. Why pay more right?My old tv was a Mitsubishi DLP 60in. I loved that tv. The reason why we replaced it with this was because the chip was beginning to go bad (white dots on the screen). While this is easily fixable at the cost of about $150 we decided to get a new one because Mitsubishi has since discontinued making DLP. The picture quality was great and because it was reflected onto a screen, it gave you that theater style picture. Also at the time it was the cheapest big screen for the least amount of money. $1100 for a 60in tv 6 years ago was a great deal. Specially since a 50in went for about $2500.So we certainly didn't want to step down in size. I looked at Panasonic and Samsung. The Pannys were my 1st choice. The only issue I had with Pannys were that some reviews were great (on model picture quality) while others weren't depending on the model you were looking to buy. A few of their base models have had there prices remain high because of their popularity. The funny thing though was that a few of their models also had bad reviews for picture quality and black levels. As far as the samsungs go, there were too many reviews complaining of a humming noise. Coming across the LG I read almost no bad reviews. The only one that was middle of the road was CNETS review of LG's plasma.Picture quality is great.  Follow some of the picture settings listed in other reviews here or on AVE forums. Out of the box the picture is good, but the few tweaks make it great.  Avatar used as a test looked awesome. The Dark Night really showed off great black levels. The sound quality from the Tv is actually really good. Surprisingly so. While I have a 7.1 set up, I don't always use the receiver when watching tv so this was a welcomed surprise.We got free shipping with the unit as we'll. it arrived safely and on time. Pilot Air freight brought the unit in the house, took it out of the box and tested it to make sure it worked.  Everything 100%. The only issue I had was my impatience waiting for the tv. Amazon and the shipping company certainly get high marks.Overall we are extremely happy and would recommend this tv to anyone.

This is a stripped down plasma TV with one key feature; a terrific picture.First and foremost, the picture. Most reliable sources will point you to plasma for the best possible picture. If you prefer the glassy (soap opera) style picture that 240hz LED's produce, you will not be happy with the plasma. Plasmas are not as bright as LED's and maintain a more traditional (albeit exceptionally sharp) picture. There is glare. I have a home with an open floorplan and this is in my living room. Direct light from the kitchen causes glare. If you have continuous direct light, you may not want to go this direction. If you are more interested in people that look real and movies that look like they do in the theater, this is a great TV. It is less than a 3rd of the cost of the Panasonic Plasma's; the picture is not as good as those. That said, for regular, non videophile type viewers, the picture is spectacular. Sports, video games and Blue Ray video are really amazing.There are only 2 HDMI inputs, one audio, component, optical and aux jack. If you have multiple components, you will need a HDMI switcher and if you don't have a blu-ray player or console with apps, you will probably want to pick up a Roku or comparable device.  I use Dish TV and a PS4 so I am completely covered and two HDMI's are all I need.  I also use an LG sound bar (LG Electronics NB3530A Sound Bar System) via optical cable. I have about 1500 sq ft in my living/kitchen area for the TV and soundbar and it is a perfect fit. Total investment is about $1100 and I coundn't be happier.Really, the primary issue for me will be how well the LG product holds up. Plasma cannot be treated like an LED and burn in, although mitigated on new models, is still possible. I have had terrific luck with Vizio and Sony, lousy luck with Samsung and LG.

Being a gamer, I was almost sure that I'd regret it, but I decided to take a chance anyway.Out of the box, The TV is pretty lackluster. Mostly due to the fact that the default picture settings aren't setup very well. So you'll want to make sure you setup the picture settings before you go and use the TV for viewing. You can find good recommendations for custom settings in some of the reviews on here or just by Googling.When I finally got around to watching a movie on it, I was blown away by how good it looked. Colors were very deep, blacks were true, picture was sharp, etc... Even when you play a lower quality video on the TV, it tends to just look better. I'd say that's more because it's a Plasma than anything though.But what about gamers? I must warn you that Image Retention is a very real thing. You gotta make sure after playing a game where a HUD stays up for extended periods of time, that you watch something like a movie afterwards. It's a pain, but hey, you knew what you were getting into. I also had read that people were reporting getting input lag on this model. I expected the worst when I first booted up my PS3/Xbox 360, but to be honest, I don't know what they're talking about as input lag is virtually non-existent on this TV. I've put more hours into gaming on this TV than movie watching, so I think I'd notice it by now.Final words on my experience with going to Plasma. Honestly, I like it. The TV gives off less heat than my LCD TV's (not the LED though), it just plain looks better and good luck finding a cheaper good quality 60\" TV. My only tips are to make sure you break in the TV for the first 100 hours and as mentioned before, setup the picture before watching anything.Reasons for 4-stars instead of 5.- For people looking to just plug in the TV and go, there is a bit of setting up prior to doing that. It doesn't bother me, but I can see how it bothers some.- My TV came with 3 dead pixels. As with any TV, regardless of brand or model, there is a chance for this. Luckily, I can't see them if you sit more than 8 feet from the TV, so it doesn't really bother me.- The TV has some stupid power saver thing where if the brightness is below 50, whenever the screen turns black, it'll turn off the panel. As soon as something pops up, it turns it back on. It's only noticeable at night, but I do see it as a needless annoying feature.- There is a surprising lack of inputs on the back of the TV. It doesn't bother me as I have everything going through my home theatre, but I do see it as a weakness in this model.", "Date": "November 1, 2013"}, {"Title": "Less than 6 months old and has issues", "Author": "Michael McBrayer", "ReviewID": "R3UXJZ3V3JQ1EV", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I purchased this TV online due to the great reviews, and also its size.

And I love it that way. If you have a receiver with multiple HDMI inputs the TV only having 2 inputs shouldn't be a problem. I'm pretty close to the TV and for its size it looks great. I had no dead pixels or any inconsistencies. It came in one piece and on the scheduled delivery date and time, very convenient. I have a PS3 so there was no need for a smart TV and to me there's no point in succumbing to the 3d fad/sales gimmick.I got an absolutely gorgeous picture, Massive screen, and Motion friendly TV. What more could I ask for. I love not seeing vertical white lines that are the lamps on the sides of LCD and LED tv's that I have notice on friends TV's. In dark scenes this TV shines! Although when completely black the TV either shuts off or something to that extent because it emits no light. Kind of cool at night though actually... but made me a little nervous the first time it happened.

I was looking at a Plasma TV again after having used a LED TV for the past 3 years and being disappointed at the poor black levels it displayed and issues with uneven backlighting. Plasma TVs also appeared to me to have more natural colours and no issues with uneven backlighting or backlight bleeding. After demo'ing the 60\" TV in store we were ready to purchase the TV as the sharpness and vivid colours looked really great and the image quality was certainly a notch above similarly priced LED TVs. There were some issues with reflections in the showroom and selecting the Cinema preset revealed it not bright enough for brightly lit rooms, but most electronics stores will have issues with this and we argued that most of our TV watching will be during the evening.Getting home and unpacking the TV one is instantly reminded that this is one heavy TV so definitely make sure that you have someone around to assist you with unpacking and installation. Seems like I have been spoiled a bit by the lighter LED TVs I have used in the past. Setting it up in our room, unfortunately revealed that the TV reflected nearly every bit of light source that was around in the room, but this was better during the evenings. The TV also had a tendency to reflect our ambient lighting installed in the ceilings that is located in the back of the room and we ended up watching most of our demo material in a nearly dark room that would have been a more fitting setting for a projector.After watching a movie, both my wife and I suffered from headaches and we set the brightness lower. It is also here that the LG revealed its worst shortcoming, poor black levels. On the plus side I was extremely pleased with the colours on this television and episodes of BBC's Life series were pin sharp, however I wasn't able to overcome the poor black levels by playing around with the settings. The TV also exhibited some pixel noise present in dark scenes with one of my test discs (Dredd) that was very noticeable and bordering on annoying. In some instances during dark scenes, the TV appeared to turn the display off for a fraction until there was enough brightness in the picture again to force itself to switch back on again. I can imagine that some people would find this very annoying. We couldn't find any settings in the menu to force the TV to remain on. The TV displayed no issues with moving images and I think sports viewers would be thrilled with this set.All in all for the price this is a decent Plasma TV if you can negate the reflections and secondly if your primary use is for general television and sports viewing. As a TV for movies it falls short of the mark. If you can deal with the pentile matrix on the 60\" Samsung F5500, I would suggest that you definitely add it to your comparison list. The Panasonic P60UT50 remains the best quality Plasma TV I've seen so far, but from reviews here on Amazon, Panasonic appears to suffer from quality issues.Unfortunately we returned the LG TV the next day and will save up my money for a more expensive LED TV.", "Date": "October 15, 2013"}, {"Title": "Great Plasma For The Money", "Author": "Mike", "ReviewID": "R2QRP9FYZ2OUXJ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Went thought the 100 hour recommended break in period and the picture looks great.

That TV was more than $1500. That is awesome TV too but when watching movies in dark, black areas in the scene will have \"light clouds\". (I think that's the right term but I am not sure.) On this TV, dark scenes are just dark and beautiful. I know that is one advantage of plasma vs LED/LCD.Also there is a noticeable difference between 55-inch vs 60-inch TV. I wasn't expecting that but that was a pleasant surprise and pictures look really big.I use Cinema mode and pictures look great. I tried using various settings suggested here for better picture quality but my eyes cannot tell the difference so I stick with Cinema mode.Last I spend $35 on Chromecast and now we can watch Netflix on this TV without spending 100s more for a smart TV.Just one issue with delivery. Amazon's delivery description said that they will deliver TV to any room and set it up. But when the guys came, they said as long as the room is on the first floor. They were nice and delivered it to desired room, however, I felt bad for them.

I bought a Sharp LED thinking the LED was the best thing. Ended up returning that TV because I wasn't a fan of the fake looking images. Then bought a Panasonic GT50, last years high end plasma, and didn't like it because of the fake look even with being a plasma. I wanted something natural like my 47\" LCD LG TV from 6 years ago.The sharp LED was not good with sports. I'm a huge football fan, and I could not stand the pixilated look. Fast movements became a little blurry on some plays. It was 240hz, but with it being a 60\" TV, you could still see it. On a smaller TV, maybe not so much. Some video games would skip, just didn't like it.Bottom line, this LG TV has a great picture. Sports on it look amazing, and no issues like the LED TV. And for the price difference of the GT50, I would take this TV. Only plus for the GT50, is it has a filter on the front of the screen so has much less glare, but to me is not worth the extra money. The glare is the only downfall to this TV but honestly is not near as bad as they say. Sometimes you notice it but then you find yourself looking right past it. Just something to get used to and is worth it for the price. The picture is great and is smooth moving, and don't have the fake look like those LED TVs. If you don't need a smart TV, or 3d this is the best route to go. The PN6700 is the same thing as this just the smart version.If you don't like how all the LED TVs look, want something great for sports, video games and everyday watching this is the TV to get. Love this TV and would buy another one, as this is my first plasma. You will not be disappointed. Also, some people say it looks grainy, which if you are a foot away, yes it does. But if you are 10-12ft away like me, great picture. Well worth every penny, no issues with home theater or anything.

With this TV I was a little skeptical because of all the burn in issues I'd heard about plasmas over the years (hopefully I can update down the road to see what my thoughts are should I experience anything like that), but have been hearing such good things about the picture quality so I decided to take the plunge.  I'm no videophile so I'm not going to post my settings or rave about deep blacks or anything like that but below is a quick pro/con list of what I've noticed in my brief time with the TV:Positives:- Price - Sorry all I'm a cheapskate at heart, so when I was able to get this for $750 with free delivery compared to the sets running over $1000, I jumped!- Size - I was looking for a big screen and got that with the 60 inch, but was floored when I saw how thin this was, and is this bad boy ever thin!- Picture - OK so I know I just went on about how I'm no videophile, but man maybe it's just bias because this is my TV, but I've never had a TV picture look this good in my life. - No Smart TV/3D - At this point I feel these features are superfluous, I have my TV connected to my PS3, so if I need to get Netflix, Amazon Video, Huly etc I'll just use that.  Also I've never been a fan of 3D, just an overpriced gimmick in my view.Negatives:- HDMI - There are only two (2) HDMI ports, which kind of sucks, but for my use that's enough for now (one for my DirecTV box and the other for my PS3), but I suppose should you need more you can get a switcher to add extra ports.- Energy Consumption - In comparison to an LED, this will cost you a bit more, something along the lines of $15 - $20 a year.- Weight - Yes, this thing is pretty heavy.  The page says 83 pounds, but I'm thinking close to 90, so it's not going to be something you want to move a lot, and you will need a good sturdy stand.So to wrap this all up, hopefully I'll be able to add more to this as I get more time using the TV, but this is a no-frills TV that has a great picture and looks great in the basement.

The Panasonic shows this thing out as the mediocrity it was meant to be; built to a price instead of to a quality.Absolutely no comparison in brightness, contrast, blacks, color accuracy and consistency. Inadequate connections on the LG. And if specs are to be believed, 40% shorter half-life on the LG.Summary: My emotional side says I should have spent more on a Panasonic while I still could.
