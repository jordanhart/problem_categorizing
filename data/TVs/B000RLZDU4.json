One of the big pluses is how good the HDTV reception is off of the antenna.  I have a large set that can barely receive off air (only some channels in the evening) but this little Sharp gets them all without any problem.  I was also worried about the channel delay as it's very annoying with my big TV.  This model is not that bad, better than the big screen, but there is still a pause between channels.  I don't know if it's any better with any other digital TV.  The other thing that's odd, but I've gotten used to it, is that the Sharp mixes analog and digital together as you use the channel changer.  My big screen makes you switch into analog or digital mode to view those channels.I was also worried about the sound quality since I have friends with flat screens that sound terrible, but there is nothing wrong with the sound from the Sharp, it's not amazing, but it has a good quality and decent volume.  The remote is also easy to use, a great relief.The DVD player so far has handled all my DVD-R home made disk without problem, which was a concern.  it has some nifty features such as language and subtitles buttons not on my expensive player.  Other than that it seems a normal DVD player with good picture quality.So far I haven't found anything to fault accept the screen doesn't tilt (it's fixed) and there's no handle to easily move it around.I would definitely buy it again.", "Date": "July 31, 2007"}, {"Title": "Simply Great", "Author": "Bookwriter", "ReviewID": "R1K58Z2MO8Q82H", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I have been a fan of Sharp products for years and this TV has not changed my opinion of this company.  I hooked the TV up to my analog cable and was totally amazed by the picture quality.  It's hard to imagine how great the HD picture will be when I finally breakdown and buy a cable box for my office.  All the programing features are easy to use, and swiching viewing modes (there are several to choose from) is a snap.  DVD is simple to operate and works seemlessly.  I highly recommend this TV.", "Date": "October 10, 2007"}, {"Title": "Almost Sharp", "Author": "C. Arnold", "ReviewID": "R1EOML6JFXG059", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "I went for this TV because, generally speaking, Sharp makes great LCDs.  The cabinet facing is simply artwork and is well suited for our kitchen, but functionality is a whole different story.  The screen on mine, admittedly is not calibrated yet, but it displays a uniform bright hue across the very top and bottom of the screen.  So, in other words, the extremeties of the screen are washed-out whereas the rest of the picture is normal.  Channel changing is slow and tedious compared to the older and cheaper Audiovox FPE-1505DV that I'm replacing.  The Sharp cabinet is also notably thicker than the older Audiovox, although this is a bigger TV screen with a better picture between the aforementioned \"rays of light\" in the extremeties.  The Sharp does have a nifty wire management area in the back of the set, but the engineers decided to drop the A/C plug-in on the other side.  Hello?  Note to the design team: Let's keep the wires together on one side of the set so ALL can be cleanly tucked away.  This one's probably going back.  I might as well save $300 and get a CRT with speedy channel changing if I can't get a Sharp UNIFORM picture with proper wire management.  You'll grow old if you have over 30 channels to surf!", "Date": "August 28, 2007"}, {"Title": "I wanted to Love it, but it has face problems!", "Author": "WA98296", "ReviewID": "R331MY8R4C6KY6", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "I don't like it because of the glossy, shiny black trim around the screen. It reflects every tiny source of light in the room creating annoying distractions while viewing. Even the screen is reflected, since the glossy edge is beveled inwards toward the screen. In real world viewing, it's awful. The trim looks fine, as long as the unit is OFF.I chose to mount this unit on the wall. The power supply cord is TOO short, at about 5 feet. I had to purchase a longer cord. Also the power supply cord goes into the opposite end of the unit than the other cables, making the power cord much more difficult to hide.The 1.5 watt speakers provide only JUST enough volume for my 12' x 12' room. If there were much ambient noise, these speakers would not provide enough volume. This room is farily quiet, and I still have the unit at near maximum volume.Other than that, everything seemed fine.", "Date": "August 28, 2007"}, {"Title": "EXCEPTIONAL QUALITY & Features", "Author": "Wanda Taylor \"folkharper\"", "ReviewID": "R31GF2DE4QFFO1", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This TV has served well for two years in an office environment.
