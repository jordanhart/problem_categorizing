Well, we bought Toshiba Regza 46XV540U 120Hz. Taking out of the box and running it we were just amazed with picture quality and sound. Sony Blue ray picture is just incredible. We couldn't ask Santa Singh :-) for anything more.Please don't get brain washed with soaring Samsung's reputation. Buy Toshiba Regza 46XV540U 120Hz without any hesitation. It will suprise you that it's picture quality is almost at par with Samsung.Online sale runs between $1800-$1500. We bought this TV at Costco for $1150.

Have had it for a few months, and no issues. Crisp image with no blur. The 120HZ technology is a real breakthrough, as I have no issues watching the action / sci fi movies I love.Easy remote and menu navigation, my wife and I had no trouble adjusting the settings to our preferences.

Filice", "ReviewID": "RPA1HQJYHTZJT", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I purchased the Toshiba 46XV540U at my favorite volume wherehouse store for $1199 one week ago.  I originally planned on buying a Panasonic 42\" 1080p Plasma, but after discussing Plasma panels with some video engineers at work, I was NOT convinced that it would be free from image retention (burn-in), especially since I watch a lot of 4:3 programming and I didn't want to lay awake at night worrying about having left-right bars burned into the screen.  Then I set my mind on either a Sony W4100 or Z4100, but my local wherehouse only had a 40\" Sony.  The 46\" cost too much.  I settled on a Sony because I own a Sony 55\" SXRD, which I find stunning, and as good as any Plasma or LCD, and it's 120Hz and 1080p/24 display. Then I saw the Toshiba, which stated that it had similar specs as my SXRD. After obsessing and doing extensive research, I decided to buy the Toshiba.  I was hesitant since I really liked what I saw on the Sony LCDs.  Out of the box, the Toshiba looked good, but the levels needed to be toned down.  I initially used a THX DVD (any DVD that is THX certified, like Toy Story, Monsters, Inc), and the disc has a THX setup menu that will help you adjust any TV to look pretty darn good.  Later I used the Video Essentials DVD for further adjusting.  After setting the color, tint, brightness and contrast, I couldn't be happier.  One of my biggest necessities of any HDTV is that it displays SD (standard def) channels well, and I'm happy to say that this Toshiba does a great job.  HD on my Charter cable looks stunning in 1080i.  Blu-Ray is jaw-dropping. I also watch a lot of sports and the  120Hz option looks great, and from what I've read in test reports, the Toshiba handles this better than Sony, and I condider the Sony better than Samsung for this.  Anyways, the Toshiba colors are excellent, it gives deep blacks, I don't see any pixel blurring or lag and fast motion on sports looks rock-solid.  AND, this 46\" Toshiba cost about $500 less than a similar-sized Sony.  The speakers in the Toshiba give satisfactory audio, especially for my bedroom, where I have this set.  The image looks pretty good even at extreme angles.  The screen is matte-finish, which is essential in my opinion to control reflections.  The bezel of the Toshiba is gloss black.  I would have preferred a satin-black bezel, but no problem.  The Toshiba remote is well laid out.  I recently owned a Toshiba 50\" CRT rear projection set and I loved the remote on that set because of two things:  1) Mute does a half-mute first, then a full mute with a second press.  Half-mute allows you to turn down the TV if answering a phone but you can still hear the sound.  2) The Channel Return will actually return you to a previous Input.  So, if you are watching a DVD then switch to a cable channel to check out a football score, you can immediately return to the DVD by pressing the RTN button without the need of it bringing up the numerical menu or cycling through the Input options to get back to the DVD.  This new Toshiba remote keeps these two great functions!!  The 46RV540U is a terrific TV!", "Date": "January 5, 2009"}, {"Title": "Great TV", "Author": "R.

I currently have a Sharp Aquos 32\" LCD as well.  I bought our Toshiba at Costco for $1199 (w/3yr warranty) after going there to get a 47\" XVT Vizio.  The picture on the Toshiba was just awesome from all viewing angles, whereas the Vizio looked faded if you were not directly in front of it.  Additionally, the colors pop when compared to the vizio and other TVs.

They were on time and very professional.  The unit looks great and has no glare. It provides excellent viewability even on sunny days in a room with a large bay window.  I would suggest you have or plan to purchase peripheral devices (DVD player, receiver, etc) capable of HD output as the TV is looking for a high resolution input to provide the best output possible.  It will accept lower resolution inputs but with its capabilities it would be a shame to not use its full potential.  So far this purchase was well worth it!", "Date": "December 2, 2008"}, {"Title": "Mine died at 2 years - Toshiba Support Terrible", "Author": "Karen F. Zarinsky \"kfz911\"", "ReviewID": "R2ICVRQNEC2PJC", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I initially liked this TV very much, bought it Christmas 2008.  Around 2 years later noticed flickering in lower right screen, and 3 horizontal lines equally distributed across the screen.  When the set warmed it this seemed to go away, but I figured eventually it wouldn't.  Had it picked up for repair and was told it was the lcd panel assembly.  To replace it would be > a new TV.  Tried talking to Toshiba support, got nothing but \"I am so sorry, so frustrating, call this number.....\" and was given phone numbers to nowhere, complete frustration and waste of time.  I'm not used to spending that much $$ (@1200) for a TV and having it die at 2 years.  I did not get an extended warranty, maybe for these LCD's it's a good idea.  I won't buy Toshiba again, and this TV was a huge disappointment.", "Date": "April 19, 2011"}, {"Title": "Great Picture but Bells and Whistles Fall Below Expectations", "Author": "Jeffrey W. Marr", "ReviewID": "RR9QBX6EGBQLG", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Pros: Excellent picture quality; 120Hz with 5:5 pulldown (ClearFrame); matte screen finishCons: Cinema Mode only works with interlaced signals; Film Stabilization only works with interlaced signals and effects are extremely subtle; On-screen menus take up too much screen spaceIf you are looking for an HDTV that will give you an excellent picture when playing a Blu-ray DVD without the desire for the film stabilitzation effects that 1st-generation sets were providing, this set is the one for you.  A 1080p24 signal from a Blu-Ray player with the ClearFrame feature provides for an incredible picture.  This is one of the few sets that provides 120hz with 5:5 pulldown, so instead of having to do 3:2 pulldown and dealing with telecine judder, you can have 5:5 pulldown to get true reproduction of 24 frames per second.However, if you are looking for a set that does rock-solid anti-juddering for 3:2 pulldown on a 1080p24 signal, this is not the set for you.  It turned out to be a major disappointment for me.  You might ask, \"Why in the world would you want this when you can have 5:5 pulldown without juddering?\"  I wanted this feature because of the effect it has on the cinematography of a movie (some call it the Soap Opera effect).My wife and I first became interested in getting an HDTV and Blu-Ray player when we saw one on display in Las Vegas last winter playing Santa Clause 3.  It immediately caught our attention because of the rock-solid detail on the screen.  We also noticed it had a different look to it.  The anti-judder software caused the movie to look more like video than film.  We really liked the effect and this was our top requirement for an HDTV.  The Toshiba Film Stabilization was supposed to do this and actually does on some of their sets.  For more info on this effect, read this article posted at [...]There is a trio of features on this set that interact with each other.  First, there is the Cinema Mode which one would think you just tell the TV whether the source is film (DVD;Blu-ray DVD, etc.) or a video (TV).  These are the choices for this set, but for some reason, Toshiba decided to make this feature available only to an interlaced source (480i and 1080i).  Why in the world would they do this? Film is film and viewing a Blu-Ray 1080p24 source is why I wanted an HDTV.  Progressive sources versus interlaced sources should be irrelevant to this feature.  So I guess this means that for Blu-Ray, Toshiba did not want to give me the option to see a movie via 3:2 pulldown, but don't really know for sure.Then it gets more convoluted.  To use Film Stabilization, the Cinema Mode must be set to Film and Clearframe must be on.  Clearframe switches the set from 60hz to 120hz, though I'm not sure why one would pick 60hz for anything since 120hz should be able to handle any pulldown or soucre signal that the 60hz option would be used for.  Since Cinema Mode of \"Film\" only works with interlaced sources, Film Stabilization only works with interlaced sources.  This sucks because my Blu-Ray player only displays 24 frames per second when in the 1080p mode.I haven't figured out how, but a couple of times the set has allowed me to change the Film Stabilization setting with the Cinema Mode grayed out.  I couldn't tell whether the set was really doing 3:2 pulldown or 5:5 pulldown.  In the highest Film Stabilization setting of \"Smooth\", the effects were barely noticable, except for the occasional slow-pan where the objects skip from one point to another on the screen during the pan.  Even then, I would have never noticed the difference if I was not looking for it.  The same subtleties occurred when I set the Blu-Ray player to output in 1080i (output is not in 24 frames per second).I called Toshiba to verify that this set is designed to use Film Stabilization only with interlaced sources and they concurred.  I filed a complaint via their website as their advertisements never told the consumer that Film Stabilization is not designed to work with 1080p sources, but they never responded.  I guess customer satisfaction is not that important.I waited to purchase this set because it was one of the few 5:5 pulldown sets out there.  I ordered it through Amazon/J&R; Music because of the incredible sale that J&R; was running.  The set wasn't here in the local stores, so I guess the lesson-learned is to wait until the set gets into the store so that you can see if it lives up to all the hype.Even with all the criticism I've provided, I'm giving it four stars.  If this set didn't have an amazing picture with 5:5 pulldown capability, I would have rated it at 2 or 3 stars.", "Date": "August 23, 2008"}, {"Title": "Worth the price!", "Author": "Terrance Pusateri", "ReviewID": "R3H0M0BGTMEVZM", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I've purchased refurbished items in the past and have always had good luck with them.

They have the best return policy and add an additional 2 year warranty at no extra cost!This T.V. is everything people have raved about. No blur effect, deep colors, real blacks. Can handle speedy images no problem. Honestly felt like a plasma or DLP when it came to deep colors.But heres my one problem and Im sure everybody has it. When the screen is in black, no video signal, or watching a dark lit scene, you can see a type of light white screen burn from the lcd.? Not sure how else to explain. Black signal is not an even black all the way across. Generally you will see some whiteness to the left of the \"T\" of the Toshiba logo on the front of the TV. You may also find some whiteness in the corners and possibly somewhere on the top.I returned my first set to Costco without a problem. Went in, told them my issue. They gave me my money back and I simply went back and purchased another unit.Regza number two is alot better than the first T.V. but it still has a slight white blurring on the unit when in black, no video, or dark scene.  In the same areas. You don't notice them much.Regza owners to possible Regza owners can contact me with any questions at onlineemail818@yahoo.comThis unit is still by far the best bang for the buck. Beats many plasma's and most lcd's.Im still debating if to return the unit and buy another and try again.

After 20 minutes or so it would clear up. It gradually got worse until we finally took it to an authorized Toshiba repair service. After 30 days, the repair center and Toshiba finally figured out what was wrong. The main board/panel needed to be replaced. I paid under $1,600 for the TV in October 2008. It started acting up 2 months after it was out of warranty. The service center advised me that their cost to replace the panel is $1,859 plus $200.00 labor.
