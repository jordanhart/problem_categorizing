{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Display comes with a Poltergeist", "Author": "compulsiveconsumer", "ReviewID": "R1JRJBNBHD7P4E", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "This display was released with a nasty version of its software where the display automatically turns itself on every morning at 4:00 am.  Google it if you don't believe it.  This is due to a feature in the software where it automatically checks for software updates, but in doing so it turns the display on.  I'm assuming there is a software patch available to download, but it's not listed anywhere on the Samsung web site.  So that leaves the alternative of installing a wireless adapter and relying on the update feature built into the software.  Unfortunately all Samsung products require a specific overpriced wireless adapter built by Samsung and, of course, it's not included with the product.  You would have to order one and wait for delivery.  Then, once installed you will discover that the adapter recognizes but doesn't allow WEP wireless encryption so you are required to change your wireless router's encryption to a different protocol, and in doing so you will have to reconfigure all your other devices to the new protocol. Good luck with that.  You've been warned.", "Date": "January 7, 2014"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "$1,887.00", "Features": null, "Name": "Samsung ME55C 55\" Commercial LED LCD Display", "ImgURL": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/518fqNbxovL._SY300_.jpg", "ProductID": "B00CYFQDP0"}}
