This 55\" Vizio fills that bill at a very good price.  Its picture is excellent particularly after you calibrate it and you do, of course, calibrate your TVs, don't you? (I recommend the Disney World of Wonder BluRay calibration disk for that - it doesn't take long, makes a big difference, and is easier to use than the other calibration disks I've tried.)  On HD this TV is like the saying goes: looking at the world through a window.  The sound is better than most flat screen TVs but none are great because their thin bezels, while attractive, don't allow room for decent speakers.  I use the Yamaha YSP-2200 soundbar (see my review of it).  For the price the picture quality is excellent.It gets 4 stars instead of 5, because it has a slow processor so when you change to a different screen resolution it hesitates while it thinks about how to display it. This slows down channel surfing from Low-def to Hi-def and back.  I had a Toshiba 46\" that was better at this (although the Toshiba has its own foibles like not really allowing you to turn the internal speakers off).Still, all in all it's hard to beat this TV for the price.", "Date": "June 21, 2012"}, {"Title": "Great picture and solid TV for the price", "Author": "Drew S", "ReviewID": "R3IAEYBJ25M22S", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I have had this TV for the last week and it is great.  It is not the thinnest TV and there is an occasional skip in the image, but overall I am very happy.  I have had 4 or 5 people look at it and they all raved about the picture quality.  It mounted very easy to the wall and has two HDMI ports in the back and two on the side which makes it easy to hide the cables that you want and have quick access for temporary devices, too.  The set up was VERY easy.  The set walks you through most of the settings.  It has quick buttons on the remote for Amazon Prime, Netflix, and Vudu.

Updated 10/2013", "Author": "Neil Rosenberg \"The real Neil\"", "ReviewID": "R2OONJZ8HFKQIN", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I'm not one for specsmanship.  If I was, I'd probably buy another product.  I am however quite impressed with this TV.  For a while I thought that LED backlighting was the only way to go, and it certainly has its advantages from a lifetime and power consumption point of view.  But you really can't beat a good old LCD/CCFL display for even brightness, and absolutely wonderful off-angle viewing.  Try this experiment yourself --  go to your neighborhood Walmart, Sams Club, or what have you and stand way off to the side of all of the sets and you'll see what I mean.  The best sets from this perspective (no news) are the plasma displays, but they have a LOAD of problems (bad overall brightness, burn in, power usage, heat).  The next best are the old standard LCD/CCFL units.  And they're getting really cheap nowadays, with everyone getting wooed by the ultra-thin LED displays.  Honestly I could care less how thick my TV is, within reason.  From the front, where I'm sitting, the difference is moot.  Really, 1 inch thick versus 6 inches.  Big deal!So, moving on, about this set.  OK, it weighs a TON, but once it's in place, again, who cares.  Then the magic begins.  The picture is to DIE FOR.  Vivid colors, really good contrast in spite of what the \"experts\" say.  And the smoothing action with 120 hz is truly incredible.  Makes everything look better.  EVERYTHING!It connected with my WIFI in a heartbeat, with no problems, it has built in Netflix, which I love, and best of all it has an easy to use ANALOG audio output jack on the back that I use with a old set of really great computer speakers from Boston Acoustics.  Cost me all of 50 bucks, and it kicks butt compared with the multi-hundred-dollar speakers you find now.  All I had to do is go into the TV settings, turn off the speakers and set the audio out to \"Variable\".  Now I'm controlling my external speakers with the TVs remote.  Awesome.Now for the bad news.  Speaking of remotes, the one that comes with this set leaves much to be desired.  The buttons are tiny and squishy, and with my normal sized fingers are really hard to find and press.  Do yourself a favor, search on Amazon and get yourself a Vizio VR17 remote.  Totally compatible, same abilities, and much better (as in BIGGER and not squishy) buttons.Be sure to price shop this one.  This is probably soon to be discontinued, and you'll find some pretty great deals out there (no names, but it rhymes with \"Bell\").  I got a new unit, shipped for $649.  Beat that!Enjoy, don't wait, and tell them Neil sent you.4/1 update (NOT April Fools!): Been finding that the Wifi connection drops after the tv has been off for a while.  Kinda annoying since I have to re-punch in the WPA key each time to get it back, which is no joy with this remote.  Finally decided to use the wired ethernet, which solved the problem.  Not sure what's up with the wifi, but be aware.10/19/2013 Update:  Well, all is *mostly* ok in Mudville, and we still like the TV ...but... we have come to strongly dislike the Vizio Internet Apps (or \"VIA\", a major selling point).  In fact we have replaced the internet functions on all our Vizio TVs with a standalone Roku streaming video adapter (2XS model) and are much happier with the situation.  In short, Vizio seems to have no interest in updating their apps and they frankly are really poor.  One would think that Netflix, Amazon or whatever on one product is like on another, but it's just not true.  I'm not motivated to give a laundry list of ways in which the VIA apps fall short, suffice it to say there are many problems -- so many that for us it's not worth the trouble.  Not to mention it crashes way too often, often multiple times per sitting.One other problem that showed up is that our Dish box would frequently lose audio when hooked up with HDMI to this set.  I was forced to use the one component input.  Weird.So, in addendum to my review (which I'll leave at 5 stars cause it's still a fine TV), I suggest avoiding the VIA stuff altogether from consideration, then you won't be disappointed.", "Date": "March 29, 2013"}, {"Title": "A Consumer Reports Best Buy", "Author": "Dr. D", "ReviewID": "R9P74B5R600JS", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I basically went with this TV based on the latest Consumer Reports reviews.  I went with the lowest price \"Best Buy\" and so far have been very pleased and everything works great.It is easy to set up and the picture on default settings is excellent.  I also find the speaker sound to be better than most TVs. This might be due to the fact that the TV is a bit thicker so they might have had more room to put in a decent sound system.I have used it with the Wi-Fi connection and wired ethernet connection from my router and both work flawlessly.  The network connections set up easily.  The apps load fairly quickly and are easy to navigate.The side HDMI input is nice as this is where I hookup my laptop.  I have a wireless keyboard and mouse so I can just sit in the living room and surf the internet on the TV.  This TV doesn't include a built in browser and I would rather just use my laptop anyway where I am free to use any browser that I wish.I haven't used the USB inputs since I can just hookup the laptop with HDMI and access any media this way.The remote is easy to use although the buttons are on the smaller side.  There is no backlight or keyboard which some people might complain about.  Entering text can take awhile when performing tasks such as inputting WiFi passwords.  But honestly you won't need to enter text very often anyways.The screen has a very wide viewing angle and is comfortable from most viewing positions.If you are looking for a great LCD TV and don't care about 3D technology, this is a solid choice. I ended up buying this TV from the WalMart site as it came with a free wall mount for the same price and they have a 90 return policy as well.  Amazon started charging tax to California residents so my preference to Amazon just went out the window.", "Date": "December 4, 2012"}, {"Title": "Very Happy", "Author": "Delivery Guy \"Ron\"", "ReviewID": "R8PLOX2MAGT0", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I have had this TV for two weeks now and am very happy with it. The picture is a definite improvement over my 7 year old 39\" Magnavox.Straight out of the box with a simple installation of the stand and an easy hookup of my components and i was watching an acceptable picture. The adjustments are not difficult but i don't think my parents would be able to handle them. Do the set up it prompts you to complete or you will see the set up screen every time you turn it on. It does require E-mail address and phone number but i give a deletable account information to avoid possible spamming and to protect my privacy. The picture was good but not great until i spent a little time doing the picture adjustments, setting the picture mode to movie, color temp to computer, and some advanced settings. It then looked amazing. Almost too clear, with the Luma tech, there is no really dark areas or loosing detail to quick movements or dark scenes. It takes a little getting used to the new clarity and lighting. Some shows got a surreal, almost soap opera feel to them but it seems like i am right there watching through a large window. The price was unbeatable at around $800.00 for a 55\" LCD 1080p 120Hz refresh rate HDTV with smart apps technology. The smart apps (or VIA) is cool but not essential. It does not allow for web browsing but has a download screen for more apps to add to the already installed YouTube, Facebook, Amazon, Netflix and HuluPlus. I downloaded one movie from Amazon and after a long load time, it was ok for an internet movie, not as sharp as a DVD. I am still exploring the toys this TV came with.It has 3 rear HDMI inputs and one on the side. Hooked up to the HDMI ports, i have a Roku 2 coming thru at only 480p but still looks better than that. I also have a DTVPal PVR that comes in at 1080p and looks amazing. Lastly a DVD that also comes in as 1080p. It also has a VGA input that i have my computer hooked up to. After finding the correct screen resolution for a 55\" monitor i was blown away by the graphics. I have not tried the Wi-Fi since I have it connected directly to my broadband by an Ethernet connection and it works good.---------------Cons: Takes 17 seconds after pressing power on for an image to show up.Slight, occasional random screen flicker on the VGA screen with my computer. Not sure what the cause is but not a very big issue. Screen aspect ratio on some channels would only display in a 4:3 aspect ratio even with the setting at wide screen. Some have said it has to do with the broadcast, but a few of the lower resolution channels are being received at a 480i and still displayed at wide screen and some at 720i would only do 4:3 ratio. I would like to use all of my screen to watch tv, annoying to see a partial image with black bars on each side.Sound is pretty good coming thru the speakers. They are built in to the chassis and are front facing so loudness is ok, but not as good as my old Magnavox that had speaker outputs ready to plug into. The sound was small until i adjusted the audio settings to turn on the \"TruVolume\" tech. Made a huge difference. I might invest in a sound bar later.-----------------Worst thing: The stupid remote is horrible. Junk. It is small, buttons are confusing and just flat out worked like bleep. I changed the battery and no improvement. Even at a distance of 6 feet, the on screen keyboard was hard and frustrating to use. The remote always seemed to have to \"wake up\" initially, then worked fine for 3 seconds and then would lag, skip, or not follow the buttons being pressed than would work good again for 3 more seconds. I would end up stretching toward the IR sensor on the TV until my arm and neck cramped and almost ended falling off my seat. I finally ordered a Harmony 300 remote for #34.00 and it works great.", "Date": "December 3, 2012"}, {"Title": "1 Repair and 3 Replacements Later and Still No Working TV", "Author": "Kurt Inderbitzin", "ReviewID": "R321WZL64WVXSJ", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "We purchased the Vizio 55-inch LCD TV - E552VLE 1080p 120Hz HDTV and 32\" Vizio in June of 2013 for a vacation rental property we own. (We also purchased 3 Panasonic 42\" TVs as well).  They sat in the box for 3-4 weeks while construction was finished on the home, and then were unwrapped and set up.Our first renter complained that \"the Vizios had a mind of their own.\"  (The Panasonics worked perfectly).  And sure enough, when she left, I tested the Vizios and the remote and manual controls on the side of the TVs worked only intermittently.  So intermittently that the Vizios were essentially unusable.  I called Vizio and nearly two weeks later a repairman arrived to fix them.He replaced the motherboard in both TVs and the 32\" worked fine but with the new motherboard you couldn't hear any sound on the 55\" Vizio.  Ugh.  I called Vizio.  They agreed to ship us a new TV and take back the one that didn't work.  2 more weeks.The new TV finally came (a slightly different, and older model, I should add), and the delivery person set it up.  It was immediately apparent to me and the delivery person that the new TV was malfunctioning.  The top four inches of the screen flickered.  I plugged another TV into the same outlet and cable as the Vizio and no flicker.  I called Vizio while the delivery person waited (for over an hour) and the Vizio person on the phone said I need to find some other device to plug into the coaxial cable outlet on the TV, like a VCR or something, to test it, or she couldn't help me.  Unfortunately, all of my devices use RCA cables or HDMI, so she said she couldn't help me.  I refused the delivery and kept my old, soundless Vizio and got on the phone with Vizio again.A Vizio manager agreed to ship me another new TV.  About 2 weeks later it arrived.  We plugged it in and it worked fine.  The delivery person left and then 2 days later we moved our beautiful new 55\" Vizio where we wanted it and tried to turn it on.  Nothing.  No picture, no sound, nothing.I called Vizio and told them that enough was enough, I wanted my money back.  I was denied.  Instead, Vizio has decided to send a technician to my house to see what is wrong with my house (even though lots of other non-Vizio TVs in the house work just fine.)  It will take 1-2 weeks for this repairman to come to my house.It's now October, approaching 3 months since we first tried to use the first 55\" Vizio, and we still have no working TV.  3 months.  We probably have 7-10 hours invested in trying to get a working 55\" TV, to no avail.  Vizio has offered no compensation, no extension of the warranty, nothing.UPDATESo the technician came, replaced the motherboard, and the TV worked...for 1 day.  Then dead.  We have tried two other TVs in the exact same socket with the exact same cable hook-up and they work perfectly.  As it turns out, others have had this nightmare too.  Check out this link...scroll down and see what people have said to Vizio's CEO:  [...]UPDATESo today, after, I guess, going through nearly 4 months and 5 TVs, Vizio is refunding our money.  So happy to be done with them.UPDATESo we have waited for 2 weeks for them to pick up the piece of junk.  More than 4 months now of Vizio in our lives, multiple sets, none work...so many hours on phone.  I called them again today, and they said they had a mix up and forgot to send the box (long gone) to re-pack the TV and the shippers to pick it up.  Box came and the TV didn't fit in it, so back on the phone with them again.  Folks, this is as bad as it gets.

For such a large electronic device with fragile internal components, picking this up in person vs. delivery was logical. This TV replaces a 'bulky' 32 Sharp LCD from 2005 which, by the way, still functions nicely in the spare bedroom.  As for the Vizio, the picture is clear without any color discrepancy.  One plus is the power consumption is very low compared to plasma models. Also, for those with a brightly lit room with skylights, the Vizio screen is non-glossy which tones down the glare and reflection.  The extra features such as Netflix and Amazon Instant Video(Prime makes it even better) come in handy for those days when there's nothing good to watch on the 200+ channels available through the satellite/cable company. I won't go into detailed specs as there are other comments that provide this. The only con with this TV is the extended delay for the screen and sound to appear after powering it on.

There was a young lady on You-tube who basically said \"Don't listen to the \"pros\". go to the sites where people who own it and review it\"Well I did that and low and behold they all like it. We originally picked this TV at Walmart where they had a wall full of working TV's (all prices), and this is the one we liked best. We tried to buy it there several times and they never had it in stock.So I went to Amazon, they had it and it came fast. The picture is amazing, crystal clear. Don't care about the internet stuff much, but it's there and it works. If you watch a 20 or 25 year old movie, it reminds me of blue-ray. Detail is out of this world.Amazon sent this with enhanced delivery, the man helped me bring it in, un-box it, set it where it was going after putting the stand on. He turned it on, made sure the remote worked, made sure there were no dead pixels. He then said \"Me and cable boxes don't get along, I'm done.\" I smiled and thanked him. Oh, he also told me \"You are really going to enjoy this TV.\" WOW, was he ever on!Thank you Amazon, for the service and a wonderful TV, and for the outstanding young lady who called me 3 times until the TV was in the door and I was satisfied, Karen I think.This is the place to go, and OH, I saved money in the process.", "Date": "December 11, 2012"}, {"Title": "Smooth return", "Author": "Grandma", "ReviewID": "R3MQVJHRKM9YT9", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "As Amazon always does, it asks you to review your purchase.

They walked me through the troubleshooting steps to make sure there was indeed a problem with the set and the folks at Amazon where fantastic and processed my refund without a hitch.
