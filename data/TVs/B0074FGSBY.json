{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Beautiful TV", "Author": "William R. Weiss \"Bill\"", "ReviewID": "R2Q8JZEFPMRY4W", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Yes some people will say that this TV is not loaded with features, like all the streaming internet blah-de-blah-blah-blah. But if you have that in your Blu-ray player, you don't need it in your TV as well. And some of us don't care about watching streaming movies over the net, some of us don't have good enough broadband connections where we live to support that anyway. And some of us BUY blu-ray movies that we like. So enough about internet bloody apps.The biggest complaint about this set offered by some is the fact that it only has 2 HDMI ports. And that could be a problem for some. But if you control all of your gear (like I do) through your A/V receiver, you only need ONE HDMI going into the TV anyway. If you've got to plug all of your high-def gear right into the TV, and you've got more than 2 HDMI devices, this TV is not for you, find another. So enough about only 2 HDMI ports.The picture quality of this TV is AMAZING. The total evenness of the backlight, especially during a pitch black scene, or when the background is totally black, is amazing. Total blackness with no uneven lighting at all...ANYWHERE on the screen, even edges and corners. I haven't seen a TV that can compare to this one in that respect.The set has MANY full manual picture controls and tweaks, and some advanced ones, or three pre-programed modes that you can still tweak. You don't have to settle for what the TV maker says is good, although Samsung's modes are pretty darn good, right out of the box. The \"dynamic\" mode is a little contrasty for my taste though. But still, it's easily modified.The front bezel on this TV is about as thin as they get on LCD/LED TVs. Some would say that this TV is a tad on the thick side depth-wise, considering it's an LED TV, but it's still pretty thin, compared to my 3 year old Sony 52\" LCD, which was a tank.The sound is about the same as other thin LCD/LED TVs. You can't get huge speakers to fit into these things, let's face it. Thin with a small bezel means thin, small speakers. If you're listening through a surround sound system (as I and anyone with a \"home theater system\" do) it's not an issue.The remote control is a bit small, but its backlit buttons can light up in the dark, which is a plus.I just bought this TV in a bricks and mortar store for $1199, which I think is a steal. Two weeks ago I bought an LG 55\" LCD and it's going back to the store today. This Samsung totally blows the LG away...the backlighting on the LG was so bad and uneven I couldn't stand it. It was really noticible how bad it was during dark scenes in movies like the second \"Pirates of the Caribbean\" movie, any of the \"Batman\" movies or \"Aliens\" those movies are chock full of very dark scenes. The LG couldn't handle them, but the Samsung does them proud...inky rich blacks that still have some detail in them.Someplace online I read in someone's comments that this TV doesn't do 24hz film mode. It most certainly does....set your Blu-ray player to that mode and then press the \"info\" button on this Samsung TV's remote and it will display that info on the screen. 24 bloody hz. So don't believe everything that people say in reviews. (except for mine lol)If you want a REALLY decent TV that doesn't have to wake you up, make you breakfast, Twitter and Facebook for you, do your laundry and surf the net for you, this is it.", "Date": "March 31, 2012"}, {"Title": "Gorgeous", "Author": "Dave", "ReviewID": "R3I4SYNFRD7LB3", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "The picture on this TV is outstanding.  The LED technology really makes everything pop with its high contrast ratio.  It is just as good as the best plasmas that I have seen.  This set is also more energy efficient than plasmas with a $12 per year energy consumption for the 55\" model.The black levels on this TV are fantastic and even across the entire screen from corner to corner. Samsung was able to achieve this by utilizing the full array LED technology.  The edge lit LED technology on other sets allows for a thinner TV, but in most cases the picture suffers from the flashlight effect where light shines up into the picture from the corners and edges of the screen.  Not on this TV.  It is truly amazing watching dark movies at night on this set.  White text on black background is like reading a high quality printed text.  Watching John Mayer in concert feels like I am in the audience.  Truly amazing.I am pleasantly surprised at how good the sound is.  The standard setting is set to mono, but there is a surround sound setting that simulates a 5.1 speaker system.  As soon as I enabled this, it filled up the room with great sound.  I am also in love with how thin Samsung was able to get the bezel on this TV.  It allowed me to purchase a larger TV for the room, as I saved space with the small bezel.  When the TV is turned off it looks slick.  The screen is a deep matte black that matches the bezel which also matches the sleek looking stand.Samsung was able to keep the cost lower on this TV as it is not a smart TV, only has 2 HDMI inputs and is 2D.  I did not need a smart TV (I use the Apple TV to transmit movie purchases from the App store and YouTube onto the screen), I do not play games (PS2, Nintendo) and so the 2 HDMI inputs work out fine for me.  I also am more of a traditionalist and did not want to buy into 3D technology on a TV while it is still in its infancy stage.Also, I must add that the standard brightness setting out the box was a little bright.  I had to turn this down and I also set the picture to \"movie\" mode with great results.  Of course this is personal taste.  There are many picture settings that you can play around with in order to get the picture to that sweet spot.I have had this TV for a couple of weeks now and as you can tell I am still excited about it.  Overall you just cannot go wrong.  Worth every penny paid.", "Date": "April 15, 2012"}, {"Title": "STOP!  Don't Call Samsung!", "Author": "John Keitz", "ReviewID": "R36NG3FVIALQ37", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I purchased this as a replacement for my 10 year old Mitsubishi RPTV.  After a lot of research, this looked like the right fit for the price.  It arrived in a pristine box, and the shippers carefully set it down in the living room (I was waiting for the accompanying furniture to arrive), where it sat undisturbed for three days.  When the time came, we opened the box, connected the HDMI cable to the surround sound receiver, and turned on the TV.  To my shock, 3/4 of the screen was black.  There was a clear picture on the right side of the screen.  In the box was a paper that said \"STOP: If your TV isn't working properly, do not return it to the store, call this number ------,\" so I called.  The nice representative told me that it was covered by the warranty (of course), and that they would arrange for another company to send out a repair technician.  I wasn't particularly happy that my \"new\" TV was going to be a repair job, but I waited.  four days later, the repair company called me wanting to schedule an \"estimate for out of warranty repair.\"  I hit the roof!  I said \"what do you mean out of warranty, its barely out of box!?!\"  Nevertheless, they told me to take it up with Samsung.  After nearly an hour of getting kicked from one representative to another, Samsung refused to honor their warranty.  In the end, the last Samsung person I spoke to suggested that I \"try to return it to the store.\"  Incredulous, I asked \"if that's the case, why do you put a paper in there telling me NOT to return it to the store?\"At that point, I called Amazon, and the helpful representative arranged for the return in less than fifteen minutes.  He also helped me select another non-Samsung model (I sprung for the Sony, and boy I'm glad I did!).  I am fortunate that Amazon is a reputable company, unlike Samsung.I will never buy another Samsung anything!  On the other hand, while I already did most of my shopping at Amazon, I will be trying to make all of my purchases there from now on.", "Date": "April 8, 2013"}, {"Title": "Almost Perfect", "Author": "tbone", "ReviewID": "R1B2ZTGLRPI9RK", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This is a great TV. I've always read about sets having rich, dark blacks and didn't think much about it because they all seemed pretty similar. The same went for LED. But that changed with this TV as I could see the difference the first time I turned it on. It can maintain the rich blacks even when other settings are at bright levels. The contrast ratio is outstanding as the range from deep blacks to bright colors produce a beautiful and vivid picture. I bought this set primarily for sports, and motion blur has never been an issue.The sound for a HDTV is very good. I know most people will use a home stereo system but there are lots of times when I don't need it. It has great volume and clarity for basic programming after you make some adjustments in the Audio menu.Samsung is using a full array back light in this model line to replace their old CCFL panels. However, to keep the cost at a mid level price, they don't use as many LED's as in their pricier sets. I did notice two things that are more than likely a result of this.1) Each corner of the panel had a small and very feint shadow that extends about an inch into the screen that is only noticeable against light backgrounds. On the good side, I've had the set for about six weeks and the shadows have gone away in two corners and appear to be getting better in the others so this may be a break in issue.2) There is about a 2\" inch band around the exterior border of the panel that is just a bit lighter than the rest of the screen. I can only see it against a light background when the camera is panning across the screen. Otherwise I never notice it. At first I only saw it on the right and left sides but then I saw a shot of a light gray overcast sky that filled the entire panel. At that time I could see the outline of the \"light band\" that framed the exterior portion of all four side.I'm guessing the \"light band\" is the border of the full array back light. The good thing is it is very minor and I don't even notice it anymore, nor do I feel it detracts from the picture. Unlike the corner shadows, I don't think it has anything to do with break in. I would guess many people have sets with the same thing and they don't notice it. In fact, my wife had a hard time noticing even after I pointed it out to her.Before buying this TV, I tried 55\" models from Vizio, LG, and Sharp. The larger the panel the more chance there will be flaw and I ended up returning all of them. At this point I think HDTV quality control is like the lottery, even with the same models. You hope you get a good set but none of them are perfect. This one is pretty close for me and I'm completely satisfied.", "Date": "May 30, 2012"}, {"Title": "Excellente! 55 inches of awesome.  Want Smart TV?, get Roku2", "Author": "Colin P. Saunders", "ReviewID": "R2H6POPAVOWDQX", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Like many others have already said, this is a fantastic LED TV for the money.  It is a basic TV and does what a basic TV should do and that is, look amazing when you watch it.  We passed on the more expensive \"smart\" TV models Samsung had to offer however.  Maybe you are thinking, what is a smart TV anyway?  It is just a TV set that has a built in Internet connection and comes with built in software/applications which allow you to stream videos and watch them on the TV.  If you have ever seen streaming Netflix on a computer, it is the same idea.  Each TV brand (LG, Samsung, etc..) has their own version of smart TV software and applications.  I am sure all TV's in the future will eventually be \"smart\", but right now most people will tell you that the apps (aka: applications) and are really not quite there yet with multiple problems overall.  A quick Google search using the words \"Samsung Smart TV's problems\" came up with tons on people complaining about the \"smart\" part of their Samsung TV's.  The price difference between this \"basic\" model TV and a \"smart\" TV model, was too steep and we decided excellent picture was what we wanted, not a smart TV.  Instead, we paired this TV with a Roku 2 XS 1080p Streaming Player for $75 and couldn't be happier. Google/read the excellent reviews on the Roku 2 if you need more info, but essentially is an external version of a \"smart\" TV, in a package the size of a hockey puck!Sound on this TV isn't that bad, all things considering.  Usually audio on big screen TV's is so poor, you end up having to buy a home theatre system right away.  I spent a lot of time playing with the audio features, working to make the voices/speaking parts of movies and Roku 2 content sound better, with moderate success.  However, this is more of a home theater/Dolby issue, than it is a problem with the TV or Samsung.  I am just not a fan of simulated \"Surround Sound\".  I will eventually move to a 5.1 Dolby home theater sound system and be done with it.  The center channel speaker is the key to clear voices in movies and Roku 2 content, in case you didn't already know that.  Otherwise, our Over The Air (OTA) TV channels sounded fine, thanks to our newly purchased Leaf Plus Amplified Indoor HDTV Antenna.I am not a gamer, so the two HMDI ports this model comes, was enough for us.  We use one with the Roku 2, the other is used by the Blu-Ray player (a regular blu-ray player, not a \"smart\" blu-ray player).  I will end up using the optical \"audio out\" jack on the TV to a receiver, once I go for the home theater sound system.  I thought the optical audio out was a nice touch by Samsung!Saw no odd colors, blacks are dark, the entire panel is back lit and have not seen any motion blur when watching fast moving sports.  I ended up turning off the Motion Plus and LED Plus, but it is there if we need it.TV is light and super thin.  Easy to set up and was great out of the box.Get this TV if what you want is an excellent picture, you don't care about \"smart\" and having two HMDI jacks isn't going to be an issue for you.", "Date": "June 21, 2012"}, {"Title": "Great TV Entertainment", "Author": "Darren", "ReviewID": "R3K4HVAHLEO3FO", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Purchased this Samsung TV after my 36\" Panasonic had a lightning surge that zapped it.

I watch mosty sports on it and the hockey is just outstanding to watch. The 2 HDMI ports are no problem which I use the Charter cable box and my blue ray.

For what the TV costs, stand should be higher quality.

It's not that it wasn't a \"bad\" TV necessarily, but it's just not great especially considering the price and other TV's in the same price range.Pros- Sound: It's actually pretty great. Turn on the \"surround sound\" effect, leave the sound on standard and bring down the bass a little, and you're set. I was really impressed with this actually. I could \"feel\" explosions and deep bass.- Backlit LED: Unlike other \"edge-lit\" LED's, this TV is backlit. What this mean is you're not likely to experience a \"clouding\" effect or light on the edge of the tv during a dark scene. I didn't experience any other these negative effects. I prefer this type of lighting but it does mean that it's not going to be as thin as edge-lit TV's. That's ok though as I didn't have it mounted on the wall. If you plan on mounting your TV this is probably not the one for you.- 120 Hz processing: Samsung does incorporate their 120Hz processing well. This is what other people say gives a \"soap opera\" effect on TVs and just turn off. But actually it's a great thing especially if you like action movies and playing video games. It's basically doubling the framerate of what you currently are watching, inserting frames in-between the source to make the transition from frame to frame smoother. Playing Skyrim on Xbox360 with 120 Hz processing on means it looks like a 60 FPS (frames per second) video game, when actually it's a standard 30. I think a lot of people overlook this feature, but it's great if you're a gamer.-No power light on the front: A lot of HDTV's have a power light on the front. Horrible and distracting! Would you like it if you went to a movie theater and there was a lightbulb on under the screen? There is nothing of the such on this Samsung.Cons- Inputs: Only 2 HDMI inputs. Yikes! If you have 3 devices, you'll either have to switch a device to component or use an HDMI splitter. At this current price an HDTV should have at least 3 HDMI inputs, probably should have 4 though.- Picture Quality: It's ok. Not GREAT considering the price, but ok. You will DEFINITELY have to mess with the settings though. All of the default picture settings have picture settings that wash out the details. I recommend getting a calibration Blu Ray. I used the Disney World of Wonder. I feel like the picture quality is decent, better than a cheap tv, but for this price, it's lacking. Bright blacks and washed out color scheme bring it down. I could not for the life of me adjust the color perfectly. I have the cheap TCL 40\" and using a calibration disk was able to adjust the color perfectly. Not so with the Samsung.- Calibration features: When calibrating this TV, a lot of the menu takes up the screen, making it hard to compare the native image. So you'll have to make an adjustment and exit completely out of the menu to see if you're adjustment is good or not. Makes calibrating very tedious.- TV Stand: Besides being a dust magnet, the Stand makes the TV tilt forward more than 5 degrees. Very strange, I tried taking it off and re-screwing in, but couldn't get it perpendicular. Just the way it's built. It's not a big deal.... but at this price it is. If I'm paying this much for a TV I want it to look good. When I walk by it from the side it's disorienting to see you're TV tilting forward.- Remote: The remote is \"lighted\", which is nice... but not really. In complete darkness it's still hard to see all of the buttons you need. Not a very bright light. On top of that the remote is too responsive. I was constantly going past the menu I needed because I pushed down once but the TV read it as 2 times I pushed it. (UPDATE - 7/15/12) Another user posted saying he had the same problem but you can fix it by sliding the stand in properly then screwing in the screws. I thought I did this, and if I had the TV I'd try it but I've already returned it and am looking at getting the es6500. If you are having this problem try taking the stand off and putting it on again all the way. I guess I didn't. At least I know I'm not the only one I know others have had this issue and thought it was not fixable.I would only recommend this model if it drops in price considerably. And at that, only purchase if you need 2 devices hooked up. Any more and you'll have to get an HDMI splitter. Something you really shouldn't have to do in this day and age. Otherwise, there are a lot of TVs with equal or better picture quality and more features in the same price range.", "Date": "July 12, 2012"}, {"Title": "Superior Value", "Author": "Ethics in Review \"That's one opinion.\"", "ReviewID": "R3DXUFL4NHGAXH", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "My $3300 5 year old LCD died and I was not going to spend that kind of money on a TV again. It's picture quality was fantastic and without jitter and few artifacts. This Samsung is equal if not better! I just needed 2 HDMI ports as my TiVo and Blue Ray disk already have the 'SMART' options so why spend an additional $300 to $400 for options I will never use?  I was having a difficult time getting the Samsung not to look like a \"diorama with distinct foreground and background\" (C. Koehler's description) that makes the scene pronounced. I was about to return the TV for a plasma set until I read the review on the Samsung 40\" UN40EH6000 by C. Koehler dated January 16, 2013. For my tastes, Koehler's configuration is spot on and now I have a TV that exceeds my expectations for price and picture quality. I will take the liberty to repeat Koehler's configuration below. The only thing I changed was to set the Black Tone to Dark (not Darkest) in order to see a little more detail. I highly recommend this Samsung as a great buy (I got it for $799).C.

It is visually appealing for some movies, but a distraction in others -- if you have Judder Reduction set to 10 for maximum smoothness, it will in some cases make the special effects stand out too much and look fake.

We just could not argue with the picture for the price nor could we justify the huge price jump when looking at comparable models which offer Smart and 3D features.  We own an Xbox 360 with LIVE that offers movie and music streaming as well as an internet explorer app so our Smart needs are pretty much already met for what we use it for.  Fellow reviewers have also mentioned several alternative add on's if you desire said features so I encourage anyone to look into those options and save more than a few bucks.We took delivery of this TV on November 29th 2012 and to date (12/13/12)  we have been more than happy with our purchase.  This TV replaced a 2007 26 inch 720P LCD Toshiba Regza so the jump in size and picture quality is quite a bit so I apologize if I may have a bias in this review.I'll start this off withPROS:Thin designVery thin bezelSuper light for it's size  about 45 lbsexcellent picture and contrastCONS:None really for me but I would list a lack of ports for those out there who love options.Picture:The picture quality of this TV is phenomenal.  Super bright display, whites are brilliantly white while blacks are deep rich and dark and the colors are vibrant and vivid.  Do spend some time calibrating the TV yourself as our eyes are all different and a few settings on here I did not like for my viewing needs.  ( plus why wouldn't you want to spend time playing with it?)  There is a plethora of calibration options to tweak the picture as you see fit and I probably spent about a week tweaking the TV until I felt the picture was optimal for our needs.  Don't keep your first settings as your eyes adjust to the new screen you'll more than likely readjust the picture.  DO NOT judge this set based on over the air or cable TV.  It simply made the picture look like garbage.  DVD's Bluray PS3 XBOX are what you want to judge the picture on, then you will see just how gorgeous your new set can be.  I would calibrate your TV with a DVD or Bluray movie that has a wide range of whites blacks and colors.  The contrast between white and black is out of this world.  I have never seen such dark deep blacks on super bright whites on any other TV.  I am thoroughly impressed as it takes dark themed movies and games to a whole new level for me personally.  The colors are brilliant and rich however you may want to tone the out of the box setting down as the colors can be unrealistically bright with LED's.  It is a showcase of how vivid LED tech can be.  Lastly you have the ability to tweak auto motion plus 120hz settings or use presets for fast scenes which I love and the ability to turn it off which is a huge plus because with it on it can give a movie that super ultra realism that quite frankly can take away from a movie. So that is an awesome feature as there are some instances I use it and some where I don't want it at all.  Overall we are in love with the picture quality and could not be happier.Menu:The menu system is very easy to navigate and really quick compared to our old set.  I am happy with the organization of menu and sub menu and how quickly I can go through settings and change things around.  It is really responsive.  That is really all I could ask for in a menu system.Remote:It's a remote and it works for me very well.  Great feature is that it has back lit buttons.  responsive operation and seems well built.  Only time will tell.Design:We love the design of the TV from the super thin bezel to the light weight which made it easy to lift and install to our mount.  It does not get very hot at all compared to our old LCD and the depth thickness of the set is still really thin to us, so it wasn't an issue that it wasn't made with current razor thin tech.  Just the right amount of ports for me personally, I know some will argue that but I can only speak for myself.  The 55 inch screen is perfect for our viewing room which is on the smaller side so overall this TV has fit our needs very well.Value:Considering screen size, design with no bells or whistles just an awesome beautiful picture for a great price.  I would have to place the value as pretty high.  We didn't need nor want any of the other features of higher end models and the savings from choosing a basic model is a very nice thing and makes the bank account very happy.  Plus it leaves us money to add a new home theater system in the very near future so how can we argue with that?Simply a great TV, great size screen, great picture for a much lower price than a Smart/3D set.Overall this has been a great buy for our needs and we are very happy and have had no issues thus far.  We did purchase a 4 year warranty to be on the safe side of things, because as we know there will always be a percentage margin for manufacturing errors and or defective parts from suppliers.  Nothing is perfectly manufactured so they do pop up from time to time.  That is just part of the game, so with anything in this price range a warranty purchase was no question.I would highly recommend this model for anyone looking for a great TV,  not a TV trying to be a computer.", "Date": "December 13, 2012"}, {"Title": "Excellent!", "Author": "C.

For me they are my Apple.  I think no other brand compares to the clarity that they achieve in their panels.  Typically a Samsung TV is priced higher than the competition and for good reason, they are worth their price.  I have research and compared various brands in person to Samsung televisions and there are no other manufacturers that have as nice a screen image.This is a LED back-lit LCD (~3-4 inches thick).  I think for the image it is the best option as LCDs have lower contrast, Edge-lit LED (~ 1 in thick) have the halo'ing or flashlighting problems).  It is actually a tapered design so it looks thinner than it is if you are worried about that.  Having the thin bezel makes a huge difference!As has been pointed out, this is not a \"smart\" tv.  I have a desktop PC, PS3 hooked up to it so that isn't really a need for me.The auto-motion preference is fairly good.  I used to have the ln55c630 and that was 120 Hz too, but this one has some other techniques that Samsung is calling CMR, which simulates 240 Hz.  I don't think it is quite like 240 Hz, but it is better than the normal 120 Hz. Like my old samsung tv this one also occasionally \"judders\", but for $799 you can't get anything that performs better than this one.  My brother-in-law has a Vizio and its auto-motion capabilities are much worse.  You have the option of turning it off, but I really like it.  When turned on it can get rid of the movie feel, but I think it is really sweet, because it seems like you are there in the movie.  A good auto-motion (frame interpolation) is a must for my viewing preferences.There are only 2 HDMIs, but I use a home theater receiver so not an issue at all.Some people have complained the remote is a little small.  I think that is better as compared to having to hold a huge remote.  Much more comfortable.Overall, if you want a plain (not smart) tv with a stunning picture this is really your only choice and for $799 there is no argument.", "Date": "November 26, 2012"}, {"Title": "Big bright picture, great HD at affordable price", "Author": "Amazon Customer", "ReviewID": "R1MB9SYOOA0X7X", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I have looked a many tv's for over three months, researching at amazon, visiting in the big box stores, read reviews here and on cnet and finally realized i would n't need wifi or any smart options.

When I came back home, the picture was better. I don't know if there is a break in period on these tv's , perhaps someone could tell me. I went into the menus and adjusted the picture from a better starting point.I am now very, very happy with the quality of the picture.  The price was very reasonable for a 55\" tv.

Why I like Samsung: my first Samsung TV, way after the warranty had expired, began to experience a problem in turning on. On the web I saw that this problem was somewhat common with my particular model. It turned out that Samsung had gotten a batch of bad capacitors. After contacting Samsung, they sent out a local service/repair technician to my home, at my convenience, to replace those faulty components at no charge to me.  I am in my sixties and had never before experienced, nor heard of, such a responsible action undertaken by a major manufacturer. Now that is a company that one would/should support. Again...it was past the warranty period.As to the picture quality of this model, in my, no doubt, biased opinion, it is the reference that other manufacturers must measure up to. Colors are very true. You can select from three modes; Standard/Movie/Dynamic.  What is animprovement is the higher refresh rate; dark scenes display better. I also like that this is not edge-lit. I have an evenly lit image over the entire screen. A bonus is the ability to access movies/pictures/music from an inserted thumb drive. Another bonus is the Energy Star rating...estimated yearly energy expense based on five hours of daily use is $12 [twelve].Having a PS3 and a Roku I did not need a 'smart TV' and I think 3D is overpriced.One thing that does need improving, though this might be unique to my set, is the HDMI receptacles.

The second unit is flawless.Note that this TV is not a Smart TV which makes it more cost effective than comparably sized Smart TVs.  The last TV we purchased was a Smart TV and we were disappointed by the non-user friendliness of the 'Smart' functionality.  We ended up using our purple branded media puck for streaming and so on this TV I didn't want to pay extra for 'Smart' functionality that I suspect would pale in comparison to the purple puck.The picture is excellent and the sound is acceptable.  We watched a couple of shows with the TV sound before hooking it up to the Bose sound system.  I appreciate that the power cord has a right angle plug on it which will make it easier to wall mount over-top of an outlet.Some reviewers complained about the flimsiness of the stand.  While I recognize there is flex in the stand I would submit to you that it is sturdier than more rigid stands.  My other TV(same size),  has a rigid stand and if you bump it the stand will lift off the table surface while this unit's stand will allow the TV to flex and have the stand stay firmly planted on the table surface.  My old TV I ended up mounting on the wall partially due to concern of the stand.  If I end up mounting this TV on the wall it won't be due to concern over the stand.My only gripe with this TV is the lack of being able to customize the name of the inputs.  We are using 3 inputs, OTA in the antenna input, the purple puck on HDMI-1 and a PC running XBMC in HDMI-2.  On some other TVs you could update the name of one of the inputs to XBMC.

Two weeks later, still no news since apparently the part is not there.I gave a second chance to samsung and I regret it. I really don't look forward to be next year when the warranty will stop.The TV is great when it works. But, for how long will it work ?I am disappointed in Samsung.

Basically, the whole screen was changed. The motherboard was the only thing kept. It basically cost 3/4 of the whole TV. So if you panel breaks after the warranty, it will be worth buying a new one. Let's hope that nothing will break after this small 1 year warranty (I recently returned my ASUS screen for a couple dead pixels. The screen was send back using FedEx, free of charge. A new screen was sent ASA they received my screen. That's what I called a good warranty again!).Again, TV is great.

Since they have changed the panel, TV is responding well with a clear and sharp picture.

I have set the TV temporarily on our black piano bench and oriented diagonally, filling up a small corner. While sitting on the couch eye level is half way up the screen. Very pleased with the look.The picture: just WOW. We don't even have blu-rays yet, just DVDs playing on a new blu-ray sony blu-ray s590 player. I used the calibration settings from a person on AVS forums for this particular model (TH02) of the EH6000 series.The clearness, crispness, colors, blacklevels, off angle viewing, motion handling - all exceeded expectations.  My family is mesmerized at how good DVDs can look. My kids have friends with large screens in their homes, and when they came over during the holidays they commented on how much more clear and real the picture is than their TVs at home.  This is our first big screen TV and I must confess getting such a huge beautiful screen for less than a thousand dollars is a little surreal.  Even the sound of this TV is monstrous. We've never had a need to put it to a third of it's maximum. Maybe it's the result of corner loading, don't know.  One can tweak the sound settings to put more emphasis on voice than effects if desired. Movie mode sounded very fine indeed. In time I'll upgrade to a receiver and speakers and of course a subwoofer, but this TV surprisingly does not make that an urgent matter at all.Once I acquire a USB stick I'll update the firmware, if it needs it.I still have to run a cable from our outdoor antennae to the TV and will update at how it goes. We've never subscribed to cable or satellite so I can't comment on the picture that way.A gripe? On the TV Handling Guide sheet it says this:\"Screen Care Guide  - do not spray cleaning solution directly onto the TV screen. Spray the solution onto a cleaning cloth first, and then clean the screen\"What it doesn't tell you is that the TV should be off and cool and the only \"cleaning solution\" that should be used is a mixture of isopropyl (rubbing) alcohol and distilled water, *not* household cleaners like Windex. Also the cloth should be microfibre, like those soft ones that are used to clean glasses or cell phones. Paper towels will scratch. Common household cleaners will smear and possibly harm the (non glass!) screen.  Yes I found out the hard way.  If the screen is off and sunlight catches it, the smears show, otherwise not.Anyway. Easily 5 out of 5 stars. Thanks for reading.", "Date": "January 2, 2013"}, {"Title": "Excellent LED TV", "Author": "D.

I wanted one that wasn't 3D (what a rip-off that technology has turned out to be!!);  3.) I wanted keep my investment low (around a grand) as I will be buying a new OLED set once they're out a few years and the price is reasonable.  So, after weeks of research and looking at many sets in the big box stores, the Samsung UN55EH6000 55\" was the top choice for me.  Picture-wise, this set out-performs others that cost hundreds more because the UN55EH6000 doesn't have the Internet, 3D bells & whistles built into it's cost.  I bought it for just under a grand about a year ago and it still produces the same beautiful picture as the day I first turned it on.  So, if your requirements are like mine you won't go wrong with this TV!!  One more thing, I saw where one of the reviewers stated that this set was not 55\".  However, if you read his review closely, he states that he measured the screen side to side.

This tv get's one star off for relatively low contrast, low brightness, narrow viewing angle and cheap flexible bezel and another for user interface/ease of use.I searched for large screen tv for a while.  I really wanted plasma as I like blacks to be black, large viewing angles and vibrant color.  However I had to write plasma off almost immediately when it become apparent that I cannot stand plasma flicker.  In addition, Viera ST had been discontinued and models similar in price where too glossy.As it become clear that LED is for me I zeroed in on either LG or Samsung.  I would have preferred LG (IPS panel, 3D) if not for uneven back-light.  Since I did not mind thick case I settled for Samsung EH.Speaking of back-light Samsung's is not entirely even either but it's barely visible as it's outside of the picture (black bars).The TV can look great once tweaked to source and offers satisfactory flesh tones and balanced if  a little flat colors.  Unfortunately each of the two HDMI ports can only have one profile.  That's not enough.  Adding insult to the injury features like brightness, backlight, motion plus, R/G balance are hard to access from the remote and on screen menus are s l o w, unresponsive.Brightness deserves a separate mention.  In a daylight lit room (no direct sunlight) brightness is satisfactory at 12-18.  This makes blur reduction feature (LED strobe) useless since maximum level is 20.Also worth mentioning is dynamic contrast and brightness.  I read few opinions that such features should be disabled.

I was looking for a large LCD TV without the \"smart\" and 3D features that tend to drive up price. After comparing TVs online and in multiple stores, this TV stood out as the best choice for me in this price category (I paid about $850). In fact, I was a bit shocked to find a name-brand 55\" TV for such a reasonable price. The picture is bright, the screen has a glare-reducing finish, and the viewing angle is fantastic. It has 1080P, 120hz and a good number of video processing options. The number of inputs in limited, but no issue for me because I have an AV receiver. The backlit LED makes it a bit thicker than some other TVs, but the tradeoff is that the bezel around the edge is much thinner. The design of the TV is one of the best on the market in my opinion. It mounted easily to the wall (wall mount was sold separately).My only issue is that I am not a fan of the control knob on the TV itself. Rather than traditional single-purpose buttons, Samsung opted for a single button that you can slide left, right, front, back, and down (to click). It is mounted under the bottom left bezel, which is a bit awkward to use considering how my TV is mounted to the wall. I just don't understand the advantage. For example, turning off the TV with the button involves 2 clicks (one to the front to highlight \"power off\" and another to actually select it). I haven't tried to do other things with the button yet, but I have to imagine it would be frustrating. Luckily, I use the remote to control the TV most of the time so this doesn't bother me enough to reduce the star rating.", "Date": "April 5, 2013"}, {"Title": "This Samsung TV is Great", "Author": "Dennis William Hawkins", "ReviewID": "R1MCGVV42QP957", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "THis is my first Samsung TV, prior I had mainly brought Toshiba TV'S.

No problem with delivery although that sounds like it can be hit or miss.  The unit itself has a good picture quality, noticeably better than my previous TV with the Xbox360 and an HDMI cable.  I was impressed with the sound I get out of the unit's factory speakers as well.  I am not an audio/videophile and would say I am an above average joe when it comes to electronics.  If you want this unit for just general use (TV,gaming, movies) and you are not an audio/videophile, then will probably be a good unit for you.The main reasons I bought this TV:-It is not a smart TV.  You can save money if you get a unit without that feature.  Plus, most Blu-Ray players have that feature built in.  No point in redundancy.-It is not a 3D TV.  Personally I don't want anything to do with 3D technology.  I usually do not see movies in 3D at the theater so why would I want to see them at home?  Plus the jury is still out on how good or not 3D is for your vision (last time I heard)A few things that have aggravated me about this unit which caused me to rate 4/5:Only 2 HDMI cable slots.  Granted I can live with it and if need be I could always get a HDMI splitter or a receiver if I ever want/need to add more than 2 HD devices to the unit.Only 1 SHARED AV/Component cable hook up- This is a bit of a pain if you have 2 of anything that isn't full HD (example would be a DVD player and a Nintendo Wii).  You will have to switch the plugs depending on which device you want to use at that point in time.The menu is quiet extensive and navigation can be a pain but I have only tweaked a few settings and I didn't have a problem finding what I needed.", "Date": "March 10, 2013"}, {"Title": "great buy", "Author": "Brenda Laspee", "ReviewID": "R1KYPA32ZVTB3B", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I recommend this product.

Picture quality is outstanding and even the sound is very good for a flat panel TV. I was very close to buying a Plasma but since this TV is on cable news and weather during typical afternoon viewing I decided to go with an LED model to avoid image retention. After hours of researching I found this model on the AVS forums with great reviews. It also fit my $1000 or less budget and size requirements.Be aware there is a panel lottery with this as well as most flat screen televisions. My 55\" is a version TH02 meaning it has a Samsung manufactured S-PVA panel. The Samsung S-PVA panels have the best viewing angles, black levels and color reproduction. If you get a Samsung made panel your set will have either a TSxx or THxx listed as the version number. There is an UNxxEH60xx owners thread on the AVS forums that will explain panel types and manufactuers. I believe Sharp makes all the 60\" panels.Overall this TV is amazing for the price and does not force gimmicky 3D I will never use on you or include apps that I use my Blu Ray player for anyway. It's just a really good bare bones TV. It allows for a very high level of calibration and since no two panels or viewing environments are the same I recommend at the least trying a calibration DVD. You can download one for free by googling \"AVS HD 709 - Blu-ray & MP4 Calibration\". There is also a very good Disney calibration disk.

It is a little thicker than the average slim models now. You do not need a smart TV. The sheen on the screen is a low gloss type that I love in an area with a bright window coming in from an angle. Find someone else' settings posted online. There are web sites with exact setting that worked out for people or just try one reviewer in here. His settings worked perfect for me here. Get Eco settings off. If not, the thing dims to a bad contrasty state and back to a bright, beautiful saturated, color popping screen then back again. Simple fix. If you lose power to the unit. you may have to do that again. Pretty funny watching my Son play XBox and see him throw a fit when it dimmed down. Samsung has a winner here in the mid range prices. It can't be beat. Their capacitor issues are a thing of the past. Fantastic picture and the speed is fine for the fastest moving action. No need for a better TV. This thicker LED does not use edge lighting LED technology. The thinner ones bleed light with the flash light effect in the corners on dark movies. Buy a 100 dollar range Blu-Ray player that handles all movie codecs and has a nice wireless smart phone app to act as a remote and you can sit there and pause a movie with your phone instead of the player's remote. Got an Onkyo 7.1 surround sound. No issues with dropping out video with Xbox as others had. You just buy the newer fast HDMI cables that are real inexpensive on Amazon and you are good to go. This only has two side HDMI ports but the way I hook everything up to the surround sound, we only have one HDMI line going into the side as it is. I use a 45 degree angle HDMI adapter and have the line snaking down the inside of the wall like the other wires. You can be on the side and will not notice that abrupt turn that disappears behind the TV. I used picture wire and two screws to hang it as flat as can be. A few lopps of it and braided. It is on a heavy duty screw that is recessed a bit into a solid wood stud. I can move the TV like a picture to make it level. Really beats back the thick body issue doing that. It sits flat on the wall and has no mountto make it protrude more. Some mounts ahve these slim models jutting out more than my unit and the way I mounted it. Only one screw holding it. A very thick one. I trust it. Great deal. The 60 inch version is now less than 100 dollars more in price than what this 55 inch one was a month ago. Get a smart Blu-Ray player because if you do it that way you have a smart phone remote for controlling what plays and some players allow you to see what is on your smart phone, on the big TV here. For instance, I think a Samsung phone has the same anynet proprietary linking up of the two devices straight to their branded TV and Blu-Ray player. If you are new to TV's and want bells and whistles, go pay twice as much. If not, get this unit while you can. You do not need 3D. It is a novelty. Everyone I know does not use built in web apps on the TV after they purchase one and they wind up taking off the 3D mode that is on their unit because it has what they call that \"Soap opera affect\" during movement. A few friends like my low sheen screen over t heir models high gloss one and the picture quality is better they say as soon as they walk into my living room. Get it. BTW, the huge white glove box that it came in was comical. It really did protect it but wow, it was about the same weight as the TV and gave me a lot of cardboard to recycle. Huge box with the regular box inside. I had no idea that it came with that added shipping benefit.

The picture quality is amazing on this thing. The audio lacks but this is normal for most flat screens, sound bar or surround will resolve that. Don't get me wrong though the audio isn't horrible by any means, just lacks bass and such. Bottom bezel mount feels like its on the cheap side and wish it were bulky like most of the mounts that ship with Samsungs. Still feels sturdy enough to get the job done though, I just happen to like that super heavy piece of glass on the bottom that most of their newer TVs ship with.Picture quality is amazing to say the very least with this unit and with minimal reflection during daytime use. Would of course be worse if plasma with glass but not the case here. My only gripe is that you cannot set an aspect ratio per say that will stretch 4:3 ratio without making 16:9 look blown up. I wish this had the ability to decipher between the two on its own or in the settings. So with a 4:3 ratio when set to 16:9 you will get letter box on the sides unless you change settings to fit to screen etc. If anyone knows a way around this let me know with a comment.

The overall quality seems to be a little better than a comparable Vizio I owned previously.  I would like more HD ports as they seem to go bad often.

The Vizio, of similar size, lasted exactly three years.  All of the televisions I have had in the past have lasted much longer.  It is too early to judge the important factor of durability as I have only owned it for about a month.  I cannot tell any difference in the sound quality of the two televisions, although a near deaf person cannot qualify as an expert in this area.

They only deliver to our area one day per week.  I missed a phone call from them on a Monday and my answering machine was turned off.  They deliver on Tuesdays.  Around noon on Monday  information was in my Amazon account that JB HUNT had tried to contact me.  I called them twice and only spoke to machines.  I contacted Amazon who helped straighten things out  ( I was impressed).  The shipment was one week late. Amazon refunded  me fifty dollars for my trouble.  One important piece of advice:  If you have the delivery people unpack your television--DO NOT let them take the boxes with them as they may have parts stored in the styrofoam packing material.  All of the screws and part of the stand are probably there and lost in the vastness of a JB HUNT dump.

As i seldom use that seating, i'm keeping it, as everything else i'm pleased with.I did notice a very thin neon green line going down right edge of screen... again, after researching it, found out (for my circumstance anyway.. seems to be several causes/fixes out there in HDTV-land) it was my picture settings.  16x9 picture size took care of it.. for now anyway?im in a medium lit room... very dark scenes are a bit hard to see, but i'm sure i can play with settings and tweak it to be better.  there is some reflection on screen from overhead light if you look for it, but nothing that cant easily be ignored (other than during those very dark scenes, lol).if sounds like i'm downgrading this tv, i'm not.  for the fantastic price it's a fantastic TV.
