{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Solid Performance", "Author": "Nicadaemus \"The Leader of the Rats\"", "ReviewID": "R3ASRGLKXENYGA", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I received this TV yesterday delivered by Amazon.com's carrier Pilot. I first want to say how pleasant the delivery experience was. I had considered buying this TV elsewhere where the shipping would have required me to lift the TV off the back of a truck and carry it up myself. The Pilot delivery person was very friendly, carried the TV into my apartment, unpackaged it, assembled the TV's stand mount and together we placed it on my TV stand.As for the TV itself, I am very satisfied.PROS:* Passive 3D - I've watched several movies with 3D shutter glasses and, while enjoyable, I found the glasses heavy and uncomfortable and the process of charging them tedious. I am sooo happy I don't have to add 3D glasses to the list of things charging in my apartment. I also found the quality of the 3D image superior on this set to the active set I watched (believe it was an early 47\" Samsung 3D LED). The 2D-3D conversion is neat to play with, but is not something I will actually use (gives  little extra depth of field, but no more than that).* Off Angle Viewing - compared to the 55\" Samsung C6300 LED I owned previously, the off-angle viewing on this set is a massive improvement. The Samsung use to wash out pretty quickly at off horizontal angles, not so with the l6200u. Note that with passive 3D, however, the vertical angle is important and the TV will need to be positioned at eye-level. Not a problem for me, but may be an issue for those mounting this TV on a wall.* Bezel - I really like the sleek bezel-less design. Note however that while the screen is bezel-less, there is still a 1/3 inch zone of glass extending to the corners of the screen without pixels.* Accessories/Features - this TV comes with a wireless QWERTY keyboard in addition to the remote for use with the Apps. I also tested it and it will work on any PC for those not looking to use the Apps (I have an HTPC). I was also impressed that the TV came with an IR blaster extension cable for those planning to use the TV remote as a universal remote (this passes the signal through the TV to the blasters (2x) that can be positioned in front of the other devices' IR receivers. Also came with 4x sets of Real 3D glasses (same ones used in the cinema). 4x sets of active 3D glasses would set you back another $200.* No lag - I use my HTPC to play games on this TV and have not noticed any lag. Haven't run any official tests, but I understand that lag is a noticeable issue on some TVs. I run an HDMI cable directly to the TV and a digital audio cable to my receiver.* Price - TV is generally priced lower than its immediate rivals (the LG sets) and with the apps, QWERTY keyboard, dual core processor and bezel-less design that are available only on premium models. Compared to the price of active 3D TVs (TV plus glasses) - it's an absolute bargain.CONS:* Flashlighting - flash-lighting is present on this TV, but only noticeable on a black screen when there is no ambient light. I watched an entire film last night (Cave of Forgotten Dreams) and did not notice the flash-lighting.* Stand mount - the mount this TV came with is pretty cheap and flimsy compared to others (Samsung at least) and the TV itself in the mount is slightly off-level. I droops slightly to the left (barely noticable, but I took out a level and tape measure and confirmed it).* Software update - the TV tried to automatically update its software once connected. I allowed it to do so and it broke the 3D option. I called Toshiba and was able to fix by reseting to factory settings. I would suggest new owners not update their software/firmware until it is confirmed working.* Glossy screen - screen is glossy. Not generally noticeable, but during dark scenes, I have occasionally found myself looking at my own reflection.* Limited user control - [SEE UPDATE BELOW] you can control settings such as brightness, contrast, color and backlight, but not much else. No individual color temperature control, no options regarding dynamic contrast, smoothing etc. The good news is that the default contrast and smoothing settings are well calibrated out of the box. I like the soap opera effect, but most don't - and it isn't noticeable on this TV.Overall, very pleased. Will update this review if my continued experience with it changes my mind.**Update 5/14/12**The TV does have advanced picture controls - I didn't see them at first because you need to scroll down past the last item under \"Picture\". Typical picture control settings are included other than a method for adjusting the motion blur setting (there is a \"cinema mode\" but it is greyed out in all picture modes).", "Date": "May 13, 2012"}, {"Title": "Great TV!", "Author": "fizzy1000", "ReviewID": "R31TK2366KB8EA", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I bought this set from Pauls TV thru Amazon, it took 9 days to deliver,threshhold delivery(no help),luckily it was light enough for me to handle myself. It came in it's original box with no additional packing or protection. Setup was simple and it found my home network quickly, Netflix was up and running with no problem. The picture quality while viewing hi-def material thru my Direct-TV box is simply stunning. Rich colors,deep blacks with none of the soap opeara effects I see on my 42 inch bedroom set. Sporting events are fantastic, no blurr whatsoever. I have 3 or 4 3-D channels available and can tell you the effct is amazing! The glasses are light and fit over my regular glasses comfortably. I wasn't able to get the Hubble 3-D disc to play properly tho, it had double side to side images I could'nt format correctly, I can only hope other 3-D discs work ok.(played thru a brand new 3-D Panasonic blue-ray player) I found leaving the set on standard mode delivers the best picture quality on all material I've viewed so far, tho some may prefer a brighter setting. All in all I am delighted with this set and highly recommend it, you could pay alot more for other popular brands and not have the picture quality of this tv.", "Date": "June 15, 2012"}, {"Title": "great price. bad value. Specs can't keep up with motion.", "Author": "Wade Emsley", "ReviewID": "R1U92M73ECSVBT", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "Hi, I never usually write a review but in this instance I had to make an exception.  I got this tv at its lowest price in months and seemed satisfied that not many reviewers had mentioned the 120hz refresh rate being a problem. Saying that the picture was amazing and 3d almost tangible. Well I can attest that both the picture and 3d are amazing on this tv, provided the screen does not move. This tv is terrible in dealing with motion. In fact sometimes the slower the movement the worse the blur.  The 3d is nearly unwatchable in movies as the amount of blurring during movement gives you a seasick feeling after about 5 minutes. I tried 6-7 different style movies from Nitro Circus, Harry Potter, Avatar, The Smurfs & Jean-Michael Cousteau's 3 movies. They all gave the same amount of blurring. Unwatchable.  I have even watched in cinema mode as this is the way it is supposedly shown in 120hz and it looks the same, no difference blur. I also dont like that the back of the TV shows this tv's refresh rate as being 60hz. In talking to a Toshiba help person over the phone, it was explained to me that my tv had a 60hz board and used the clearscan technology to improve it to 120hz. However, the HDMI display when shown shows it only to be at 60hz as well. And nothing under the display options about clear scan or how to turn it on. This performs like all other 60hz tv's I have seen, and if this is in fact 120hz then a minimum of 240hz is needed for 3d viewing and sports. I returned this set with amazon's wonderful return policy and bought a Samsung 60 E7100 instead, where this problem is said to be a thing of the past with the 720 CMR on this set making it at least on par with plasmas 600hz and still pay in my price range $1700 for a set worth at least 2500.

Patel", "ReviewID": "R1U7NLHVE1WEHK", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "This will be a brief review based solely on appearances and as I continue to learn about the features of the TV, I will add on to this review. (4 Stars based on initial reaction to TV)The TV looks excellent appearance-wise. Amazon shipping (Thru CEVA) brought the TV into the house, unpackaged it, and tested the TV to make sure it works! All was good.The packaging of the TV was pretty good as well (Though I had purchased a 55 LED from LG which had much better packaging...more sturdy which made me worry about this one). All four corners were covered, and there was a Styrofoam board on the front of the TV. I will be setting it up in the coming days and will be doing a more comprehensive review of it.A big drawback from what I can see is that the screen is very glossy! (I believe the screen is actual glass) so that will most definitely be a concern if lighting in the room is an issue.The TV came with 4 3D glasses, a QWERTY keyboard, a remote control, and wires to allow RCA cables to be hooked up.Again this TV looks great and it wasn't very heavy at all!UPDATE:After getting to play around with my new toy for a few days, I'm pleased to say I really enjoy this TV! Amazon had a price point of 984 when I purchased it, it was on sale for a very limited time so it may come back a this price...? Who knows...Anyways, here are a few points and grades that I have been able to assign to this TV:- Screen - 8/10 - It's pretty darn glossy when the TV is turned off, but once it's on, you hardly notice the glare. I, personally, don't have any light source behind the TV so don't really need to worry about glare as much as maybe others but again, when the TV is on, not too bad-Design - 8/10 - I really like the design of this TV! The TV, when off, looks beautiful. I have a very primitive 60\" Sony projection LCD to compare to (MASSIVE!) so anything compared to this looks amazing. The bezel according to pictures that I had seen in pictures led me to believe that there was maybe 1/8\" bezel, if that. After turning on the TV, you notice that there's about 1/2\" border (on the screen, not the actual plastic border) that doesn't contain picture, so this was a bit disappointing.- Motion - 9/10 - I haven't messed around with the settings and am still not even sure if the TV has an option to change the 120HZ motion setting. I really hate when TVs have that \"soap opera\" effect and am glad to say that this TV has none of that! (none that I can notice anyway) The motion is very smooth but not overly smooth that it looks \"soap opera-y\"- 2D-3D up-conversion - 8/10 - I have never really seen any other TVs which have up-conversion so can't really compare to any other ones, but I can say that I've tried out Avatar (Blu-Ray) and up-converted that and it looks pretty good! It wasn't the greatest 3D but for up-conversion, it was more then enough.-3D content - 9/10- I watched Under the Sea: IMAX + 3D and this was awesome in 3D on this TV. The colors were extremely vibrant and not washed out at all. Having darkened 3D glasses, I assumed the colors would fade, but this was not the case at all.-I can not comment on Web browsing, Cable-viewing, or gaming yet as I don't have any of those connected, only a 3D blu-ray player. (It's not in its final residing place...once it's there, then I'll connect the other stuff)Any other info needed?

Beats Samsung/LG/Sharp in my opinion", "Author": "Jilla \"Jilla\"", "ReviewID": "R2K2B6LJ4IZDQN", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Update in June 2012 :Although my first TV was excellent, the sound was too low. I had to crank up to 70 (on a scale of 0 to 100) to hear from the normal 8/9 feet. So I contacted Toshibha and they were defensive and said \"This is thin LED TV. This was designed to work with a sound system. Shocked. When I countered them by refering to their own page refering to Audesey ...., they retreated and replied, may be the speakers are defective or damaged during transit and recommended contacting the seller.I contacted Amazon Large items and the CS lady immediately understood the problem and ordered the replacement as the first one was defective. I got the replacement within a week and again CEVA did an excellent job in delivering the replacement and took the old one. I tested for the sound & picture. The sound is much better and even at 35 on the same scale was clear from 8/9 feet. Still not like my Samsung on the sound but much much better. What was the pleasant surprise is Picture Quality on 2D and especially 3D was improved. I thought the initial one was good. This one is excellent and even the 2D to 3D (which was only average on the old one) is very good. Thanks Amazon for replacing the defective one. That is why I prefer to buy from Amazon. Very good customer service.Overall this TV is amazing and has excellent PQ in both 2D and 3D. Even SD channells look good. LG 2012 TVs (LM6700 etc) claim to do upconvert but this one does pretty good job on SD channells which is important to me as I watch international channels on my DISH. I compared the same channels side by side with Samsung and this, for HD both are excellent. On SD channells this beats Samsung (last year's model) by a mile!!I would buy one more if I see the <$1000 price again (lol). Thanks Amazon!!Initial Review :Got my TV yesterday. I got it for under $1000. Now it is greater than $1500. Thanks Amazon for the amazing price and for amazing TV.Good service from CEVA/Eagle. The guy who brought in was professional and knew what he had to do. Got it out of the box and fixed the stand and even adjusted my settings!! all within 15 min & gone!The TV is amazing. I am not saying it because of the price I got it for ($984). 2D content is excellent. Even SD is much better compared to my 2009 SHarp LED or UN55D7000. No soap opera or lag. I played 3D using Bluray & it was stunning!! No drop in brightness in 3D at all. Only thing is I didn't feel it did a good job converting a 2D to 3D.I put it in a family room with 3 big windows. Yes the TV screen is glass like but even with blinds open even, when the picture is on, no problem. Also no flashlighting or any other problem.Setting up the network went with a flash. Setup using \"Assited\" and find the network and adjust the security settings using \"Manual\". Otherwise the push button setup will not recognize as it defaults to something which you may not have.Played some Youtube/Netflix. 3D content in Youtube also look amazing. Only cavet is certain picture settings cann't be set in Mediaplayer or in Network. No big deal as I liked the way it defaulted.I haven't had time to play with the settings yet & I plan to do it in this longweekend. I just got it yesterday evening. I liked the STANDARD mode for Sports & Movie mode for Movies. I am not expert like many of you are but my eyes didn't see any problem (Flashlighting/Lag/soapopera etc). The thin bezel makes the tv look small when on & off. Because I put it in a family room (15 x 15) which is open to the big (12x18) kitchen, the TV looks small to me. May be I need 65/70\" TVPROS :1. Excellent while showing HD & even SD channels.2. Native 3D content is very very good. No drop off in brightness like in my Samsung.3. Very easy setup for network4. Played Netflix/youtube very well without buffering. My tv is on first floor & my wireless in second floor! Even then no problem.5. CEVA gave excellent service. They called to schedule and called on the day of delivery and setup the tv.CONS :1. Some Advanced picture settings cann't be tweaked while in Media player or network but I liked the standard settings.2. My main issue is the box was damaged and fortunately the TV wasn't. The downside is if I move the box cann't be reused.3. The stand that attaches to TV is unlike any other model I have seen or owned, fortunately for me, CEVA man knew what to do!4. 2D to 3D conversion is very average at best.Overall this is an excellent TV even for $1500.", "Date": "May 26, 2012"}, {"Title": "Great TV for the money", "Author": "Joe Hockett", "ReviewID": "R4J1BEZ5ECJ6C", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This TV is one of the faster 55 inch TVs when set in game mode.

Pilot delivery means they would bring it at a certain range of hours.. not like the phone company a range of a day, no this was supposed to be delivered from 9am to 12pm n the pilot guy arrived 11:50am which was perfect! they unwrap the product put it for you where you want, hook up the TV stand .. turn it on (they don't set up the features they just just make sure it turns on).. then he took the old heavy TV I had and carried it to the garage where I wanted..now the stand was slightly lop sided (one of the screws was dif for the pilot guy to screw on) I guess that's the reason.. n so the TV wobbles too ..  but it doesn't look like a big deal.. It still looks sturdy to me. and very sleek.Now the thing I was nervous about is Setting it up being that it is not just a TV:Setting it up was not so difficult (I'm not techno fit) but I was able to get it done..I have cable so I connected the Cable directly to the cable spot in the back which in turn reverted the cable to the built in cable capability but changed the numbers of the chanels n got so confusing where you don't know which is where and what number..  Scanning the chanel made me notice that some were missing so I had to rescan, which made more go missing.. so U have to revert back to scan make sure it is auto from  the setting i.e don't pick cable or antenna just auto scan that brought back all the chanels.. so I had to reconnect my cable box back directly cause that new weird re-arrangement of the channels was driving me nuts plus I couldn't locate A couple of channels at all..The next day I got an HDMI cable and Connected the TV to the cable box  and OMG!!! the picture (which w already amazing) with the regular cable, turned beyond stunning!! the sound too almost surround .. . Got to use the HDMI cable so might as well order it since it doesn't come with that..  they give you a few regular cables to connect your sat. or cable components though.Now the feature of auto 2D to 3D is seemless.. U just press a button on the control. and it is cool but with the real made 3D DVD it is amazing.. if it wasn't for the headaches I get from 3D I would be watching 3D all the time. But just watching the HD off this TV is more than awesome and is like 3D in the \"pop\" effect..The wireless keyboard connected well.. it plays dead when U press on the darn Netflix built in button which is useless and freezes n although I am a member it just wouldn't allow me to log in and the keyboard which works fine all along just won't type neither will the remote.. It's that darn Netflix that made me not eager to leave a 5 star.TV has 2USB in the back one was taken for the wireless keyboard receiver. So U are left with one.About ppl who think that 42\" is better and a sharper image, IDK what they are talking about 55\" in this TV is such a crispy sharp image it just can't get any sharper n vivid than that.. Sure the 60\" or even bigger would be great if it wasn't for the size of my living room n not wanting it to look tacky or an over kill..surfing the web? it is fast of- course U won't be writing documents n working off this while u r on your couch.. Kidding me??!! the writing is still small no matter how big your screen may be.. and there is nothing like a screen in your face or on your lap.. but I watched a youtube video off of my big screen TV n the thought that U can enjoy big screen computer videos like that is great!!Overall with all this was a great buy and Toshiba is a solid brand .. I have a vizio in the bedroom  (not a smart TV), have it for more than 5 years but I read some reviews of the sound acting up on the smart TV n that turned me off ..I had this TV for just a few days now, if there are any problems U'll see me posting an update..update: 10/8/12Turns out on  netflix you have to type via the remote by clicking enter when the screen pops up  to sign in.. n forget about attaching your ipad to the TV and try to watch your amazon videos on that .. the pic . will disappear.. IDK if this is  intentional, like w apple copy-write none-sense limitations taken too far, or if it is the TV just not acting 'smart' .. so don't get too excited that you'll be streaming  amazon videos on your big TV..", "Date": "October 5, 2012"}, {"Title": "Satisfied Owner...", "Author": "Greg Bass \"Sound Guy\"", "ReviewID": "R2NKBG4M7Y0HXG", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I purchased my Toshiba 55L6200U from Amazon 22DEC2012 for nine hundred and eighteen dollars.  It was delivered within one-hour of the scheduled time by CEVA.  Mine is a June 2012 build.I connected it to the internet via wired connection. Updated firmware (and unplugged TV for 5-minutes to perform a soft reset). Made some quick picture adjustments with WOW! DVD and watched Journey 2: The Mysterious Island in 3D off HBO On Demand via FiOS. Looked great.  Have since watched other 2D and 3D content via On Demand on FiOS and on HBO Go online from my laptop going HDMI directly into the TV.  All looked great.Good news, the 6200 does process 1080p-24.  I set my Blu-Ray player to output 24-frame content.  Watched Avatar DVD in 2D and 3D.  Looked great.The built-in speakers are adequate.  I had decent volume @10' away with volume in the 55-60 range.Even with the polarising screen, the TV is pretty reflective.  I have a small living room with three-windows.  I need to draw the shades to minimise reflections.  I posted a couple of user photos to Amazon.I have played WMV video and MP3's from a USB stick. Looked/sounded fine to me for compressed formats.Neflix worked fine. Logged right in and watched a few minutes of some random movie in my queue.Smart TV -  only so-so.  Not many apps. I access smart TV content through my Panasonic Blu-ray player that has a wider selection of apps and only cost $99.Cinema Mode (120Hz/blur reduction mode) is only available on interlaced content.  A Toshiba level 2 tech verified that the 7200's version of ClearScan DOES process progressive content. Although the 6200 is advertised as having CleanScan - it really doesn't - it has Cinema Mode which does not have all the features as true ClearScan in the 7200 as stated in the manual on pg 119 and verified by the tech's tests on his TV simulators of these models.  What does this mean?  Well, most cable/satellite boxes output 1080i max.  Set your set top box to output 1080i and Cinema Mode should automatically be activated.  Turn it on/off in settings>picture>advanced picture settings>Cinema Mode.  Cinema Mode does NOT work in PC and Game picture modes.  If, like me, your AV receiver is performing all the audio/video switching, either bypass the receiver's scaler and let the TV and its dual-processor do it or find a combination of the processing available in both units to get the best picture.120Hz mode offers, to me, a very subtle change in the picture.  Its purpose is to minimise blurring while watching sports and other fast-action/motion content.

Although good things sometimes come to those who wait, such is not entirely the case here.The good: 2D picture quality if quite good when you have HD sources. As expected, the same cannot be said at standard, low resolution. However, it does beat most edge-lite LED TVs out there as far as I'm concerned. Haven't tried 3D movies yet.The bad: Clouding can be very bad to barely visible. Can't understand why it's so inconsistent from one day to the next when you first turn it on. But you probably won't notice it in all but the darkest scenes.After calibrating it with Disney's WOW disk, here's what I got using the Standard Picture mode: Backlight=50, Contrast=90 to 100, Brightness=25 to 35, Color= -6 to -12, Tint=35, Sharpness=0 ( couldn't see any effect here throughout the range of -10 to 10 ) I have yet to try the Advanced Picture Settings and see if any improvement can be had.Going back and forth between backlight, contrast and brightness, I could not get the ideal contrast and brightness as specified by Disney's disk. As a result, brightness isn't bright enough and contrast shows up in the lack of shades of grey and black. Most plasma TVs obviously hold the edge here.The ugly: The connection between Closed caption and sound muting is ridiculous! First, you have to press the mute button twice to get the sound fully muted; once for half-muting. While this might be desirable for some, it isn't for me. There should be at least an option to get rid of this half-muted setting. But here's the really annoying part. Every time you fully mute the TV, it brings up closed captioning on channels that have it. Again, some might like this. But when you turn of muting, the closed captioning stays on for every channel thereafter! Extremely annoying. The only way to turn it off is to go back into the Settings EVERY TIME! Why Toshiba did this is beyond me. Also, Toshiba has a habit of banning anyone who has anything bad to say about them on their forums. Their current firmware update isn't even on their server despite the web page indicating it is there. Does anyone at Toshiba even test their own products? I'm seriously doubting it.Bottom line, I would should have went with LG's LM7600 ( but was initially turned off by that goofy Wii type remote ) or a newer Panasonic plasma instead.", "Date": "September 18, 2012"}, {"Title": "This TV is a pure Gamble, play it only at your own risk", "Author": "ViPeR", "ReviewID": "R3H39JVC4077QZ", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "When I purchased this TV I knew I will be playing a gamble of $699 (got it on sale) since there are not many reviews for this product anywhere online. Picture quality of Toshiba 47L6200U is just satisfactory not that superb, I am mostly disappointed with its sound that even if you are in a small room you have to notch up the volume to 90 before you can hear anything away from 10 feet.Also Netflix app does not work in the TV, you may want to visit Toshiba forums first to see the issues before buying this TV. One good thing is the browser with Flash compatibility but not all videos plays on it..its a pain using the external keyboard and remote as a mouse..there are USB ports but it does not detect my wireless mouse.In terms of 3D, the quality looks good but its not the best of 3D I must say, I have watched Avatar in 3D and its not in your face kind of 3D its just okay.Overall I am not the happiest Toshiba customer..if this was able to be returned I would have returned it back to Tigerdirect and purchase either Samsung or Vizio.Update on 01/07/2013: Still trying to get the Netflix app to be fixed even after 25 days of use, I borrowed my friends Vizio Smart TV just to verify and I could able to run the Netflix on it also I can run netflix on my Xbox or PC but this TV gives me an error \"We are having trouble playing this title please try again later or select a different title\". Toshiba support always was pointing fingers on Netflix and Netflix on them so finally now that I have tested that there is no issue in my Netflix and I am confident that this problem is with this TV I have forced Toshiba to send a technician for the repair so hopefully tech guy can fix all the various issues with this crappy TV.Update on 01/11/2013: Technician from Toshiba has changed the board on the TV and well to my surprise the Netflix problem turned out be a hardware and not the Netflix version. Now Netflix is working fine without any issues, however I find a new issue that 3D option is not working when I am trying to use while watching movies in Netflix..now I will have start a new discussion with Toshiba for 3D.Update on 02/07/2013: After using this TV now for almost 2 months and been through couple of issues and their fixes I am now satisified with this TV in all aspects especially I like it more when the picture has been perfectly calibrated and I could watch videos online without any issues through the web browser after changing the settings to Cinema mode and edge enhancer changed to max...therefore I have decided to notch up the rating to 4.", "Date": "December 26, 2012"}, {"Title": "Great TV.", "Author": "Tsaka Na", "ReviewID": "R3VVGEOF2MILP", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I almost got another brand for twice the price of this TV.

I love a really sharp picture, without any trace of the little pixels from a reasonable distance. I love natural colors. Some brands have a superimposed brightness to the colors which when watching is a little bit distracting to me. I want to not be reminded it's only a movie. And colors that are too intense can do that to me.This set seems surprisingling light for it's size, which for me is a bonus, as I like to sometimes change the locaton of the tv in the house. This was a snap to unbox and setup and it only took about ten minutes until I could watch movies on it.But the main feature I love about this set is the picture quality. It is breathtaking.In particular, 3D is incredible. I love the glasses which can be comfortably worn over your regular glasses.Tweaking the setting a bit to get the picture and colors to your personal optimum for viewing can take a few extra minutes but is well worth it. This found my wireless connection immediately and within minutes we were watching streaming movies that made our family feel like we were in there with the action.In short, I feel this set is pretty close to perfect. I am very happy with my decision to purchase this set and for the money I feel it's as close to perfect as I can get.", "Date": "January 12, 2013"}, {"Title": "How do I 1080p 120hz", "Author": "pbo", "ReviewID": "R3MRO3V45L6HRX", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "So the only connection is HDMI but with HDMI 1080p 120Hz is impossible from a pc.

I moved up from a 46\" Sony XBR LCD and I KNOW that was a great TV.  The Toshiba is just as good if not better and for the less than $1100 I paid it's an absolute steal.PRO's:- Built in picture modes are actually pretty good but easily changed to meet individual preference.  My preferred option for most everything thus far has been cinema/movie mode- WiFi works great.  The browsing speed is surprisingly fast and the apps seem to work great- Color levels are rich, and I personally have not seen issues with soap opera effect or flashlighting.- Crisp picture- 2d to 3d actually works pretty darn well.  Certainly, not as good as native 3d content but very passable all things considered.  It does make my head hurt a bit though.- 3d is gimmicky, yes but so damn cool.  Works great with native 3d content and love the passive glasses.  Even wearing them the image is much brighter than I imagined it would be.- Speakers are decent but I end up using my external amp/speakers 99% of the time.- Menus and remote are fairly intuitive.  I've only opened the manual once to read about connecting my tablet to the TV (which it turned out I couldn't do.)- Thin bezel is great.  It looks even more slick when the TV is off as the glass literally spans edge to edge.  It's NOT as thin as represented in manufacturer pictures though.CON's- Gloss isn't unbearable but definitely more noticeable than my old Sony.  I find that I have to close curtains during the day to not be annoyed.- WiFI was for some reason a pain to set up.  I could see my access point just fine but God help me, it would not accept my password.  After several attempts I finally power cycled the TV and for whatever reason that worked.- No Flash support in browser.  :-(Again, I think it's a fantastic set and my standards are pretty high.  I think this is easily as good as many comparable models from Samsung that I've seen for at least twice the price.  If you can pick it up for $1500 or less anywhere I think you're doing VERY well.

It started with the TV turning on and off by itself once or twice. I thought it was just a quirk and didn't pay it too much attention but it kept happening. I called Toshiba about it in July and they said I only had 30 days of support for software issues and then it's $35 for their support. I told them that I didn't install any software to the TV it was THEIR SOFTWARE. They wouldn't assist me and I hung up. I contacted Square Trade and got the same answer. I just lived with it.Then the smart apps started crashing. Netflix app has been the biggest problem. The app shuts off or doesn't load at all without pressing the button a couple of times. My latest problem is that after I closed out of Netflix I couldn't get back into regular TV viewing. I get a black screen that shows the channel number at the top with the program info but no picture or sound. I called Toshiba again. They said it was a problem with my cable provider. I told them that I got cable service (internet) on other devices from the same cable and it works fine. They reluctantly agreed to contact a support tech to come to the house.I got a call a couple of hours later from support saying this is a mainboard issue and that it will need to be ordered and replaced. I still think it's due to the Toshiba software update. I had no problems until then. We'll see how it goes. The scary thing is I've heard of this happening with other brands of \"smart\" TV's.

I've not noticed any \"flash lighting\" problems which is impressive because the entire TV looks to be nothing but screen. The colors are vibrant and the blacks are nice and dark.I use an antenna to watch broadcast TV so the media guide included on the TV is wonderful. The biggest thing I miss from cable is the interactive guide to know what's on now and what's on later. For anyone cutting the cord and not looking to invest in something like a Tivo, I wouldn't overlook this feature in your TV purchase.The sound from the built in speakers is ok, but you have to turn the volume up quite a bit before you can really hear it. I purchased a Vizio VHT215 soundbar with wireless subwoofer and connected it to the TV via HDMI ARC. Instant improvement and you can control the volume of the soundbar with this TV's remote. With a TV this size, odds are you aren't going to be putting it in a small room, so I would advise investing in a sound system or sound bar of some sort if you'd like the audio quality to match the picture quality this TV can display.As for 3D, I've only watched a few things using the 2D to 3D conversion and played a few games in 3D. It looks great and being passive 3D, I like knowing I can just keep a pair I get from the movie theatre to keep increasing the pairs I have for a movie night at home.All said though, I highly recommend this TV.

I bought this thinking it would be a good TV/media player combo as most of my movies and TV shows in my collection are Divx/Xvid, MKV, DVD ISO, BD ISO. I was wrong. In my testing the only video file it did play was a MP4. When this was playing, the picture was a bit dark so I tried to access the settings. You can't do that while in the media player. After stopping the video, exiting out of the media player, changed the settings bringing up the backlight and brightness to the max, went back to playing the file only to discover that while you are in the media player, it ignores all the settings and goes to a default setting instead. Another annoying thing is when you navigate within the media player directories from my connected hard drive, there is so much lag, we're talking about 2-5 sec.Toshiba support was no help. The technician I spoke with was trying to blame my hard drive for any of the problems saying it was because it was formatted in NTFS, which I had never said and in fact it is formatted in FAT32. No help for them, all they have is the manual for a knowledge base. I requested someone with more technical experience and was informed I would have to get a call back from a senior technician. OK. Call back was from the same tech with no further information.Boot up time is long, at least 30sec - a minute. It is not bezel-less, there is an inch around the border. Lagging through the menus every time you press a button on the remote. Only one app is useful, Netflix, most of the other are pay to play except for a TV guide one, but why would you use that instead of the guide from your cable or satellite provider?, oh and Youtube.This is not worth the $1800 it is listed at... luckily I got it at $990 but it's still not worth that! I think I will return it.
