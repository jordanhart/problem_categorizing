{"Reviews": [{"Title": "835 52 inch Review", "Author": "CN11FortCo", "ReviewID": "R2VH8F9TE2F8NE", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Received this TV late last week (6/2/11). The set looks great. I ordered a 52 inch Samsung 7000 series Plasma a couple of months before this and ended up returning it. It put out a lot of heat! The Plasma also had image-retention.If you would watch ESPN for even twenty minutes and change the channel, you could see the shadow of the ESPN logo for a couple of minutes.. The Plasma also had a slight buzzing noise. BTW the Plasma was properly broken in.After returning the Plasma I decided I did not want logo's and letterbox's (widescreen black boxes top & bottom) dictating what I watched. I knew I wanted an LED-LCD from one of the top manufactures (Samsung, Sony, LG, Sharp).The Sony's were a little ridiculous as far as the price and did not look any better in the big-box stores than the other brands: Buy one if you really want to pay more for a Sony logo to impress your friends (I hope you do not have those type of  friends, life is too short)... The Samsung TV's seemed to have \"clouding\" issues and I was not impressed with my Samsung Plasma.This set had good reviews and the 52 inch size is perfect! The TV is bright (backlight needs to be turned down a bit from factory setting) and really looks amazing with no noticed \"flash-lighting\" or \"clouding\" so far. Colors a very accurate and the apps, ex. Netflix, are great. The TV even comes with wifi built in, no usb wifi device needed! Blacks are dark for an led and viewing angles are very wide.If you want a solid set from one of the top manufacturers this set is perfect and can be had for a solid value.", "Date": "June 5, 2011"}, {"Title": "Decent TV", "Author": "Bryan", "ReviewID": "RC6D8JCUKI17J", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Let me start off by saying this TV when I first saw it online I fell in love.The reviews at the time all had 4-5 star, no complaints ect. I first saw it at $1450ish on Amazon and figured for a 52\" 3D LED TV that sounds like a steal.I have a 32\" Sharp TV in my bedroom thats older and love it, grant it 5 years old, still is a great LCD.Anyway a few things on this TV I want to point out as some reivews don't mention this or understand it.This TV while it is LED it is Edgelit LED which means it will have some very minor bleed, but this is what allows it to be soo thin, and boy is it small! GREAT for wall hanging!Let me go into some details on this.The edges of the screen on dark images look perfect, no issues, on bright images you see the far left and right side have a very minor bit of more brightness to them, and no one noticed until I pointed it out even. (I am just very detailed so I see everything).Its def not a cause to not buy the TV. Its very minor and again on dark images (which I thought is funny as expected otherwise) it has no bleed on edges.The flightlight effect some people are seeing, if I recall correct its same as above, on edgelit this can be common, but its also very very minor and only visable if you have the image set to certain modes that are just bright. I have yet to adjust anything manually, am going to calibrate it with the Disney WOW disk when I get around to ordering but I am sure after this it will be fine.All in all I think for 3d LED tv its fair price. It has plenty of features for network (which the Wifi setup without issue and works great also btw).My only other complaint other than minor things mentioned above, which wouldn't stop me from buying again because for the price I cant find anything better except maybe plasma is that its not a true 240Hz like Amazon and Sharp make it look.This TV is 120Hz and has a setting for 120Hz high, low and 240 Aquomotion. The 240 Aquomotion is not a real 240Hz, its 120Hz on the screen side and does 120Hz on the LEDs or something like that.In Sharps words \"AquoMotion 240 Technology improves fast moving images by combining Sharp's 120Hz Fine Motion Enhanced Technology with 120-backlight scanning. Fine Motion Advanced processing creates and inserts 60 unique frames a second, which smoothes out edges that occur between frames in the original footage. The backlight scanning works with the panel refresh rate to further reduce perceived motion blur and improve overall clarity and picture quality.\"So that's my only other complaint really. I thought I got a great deal on a 240Hz TV to find out its really just 120Hz. That made me feel like the value of it went down some.I really have not gotten to test 3D also because no glasses and the new model ones just came out and are not in stores yet and I don't want to buy the old ones of course. Also if buying on Amazon, buy it after like 1AM ET or late on weekends. The price has dropped down to mid 1300's and seems to jump all over.Also be careful as Amazon only price matches one time, I thought they would keep matching own price but while they did work with me a few times they pointed out its a onetime thing so make it count if using!Overall I would say is still a decent TV for price, even feeling robbed on the 240Hz a little. You cant find a 3D 52\" LED TV for this price. Only plasma.My other minor complaint I forgot to add is the screen is semi gloss, can have some glare. Probably not as bad as a plasma would be but was unexpected.I would rate it at a B+ on A-F scale. Would be an A if was true 240Hz and not gloss as again the bleed and what not is so minor I don't mind it once you correct settings.***Update*** 7/4/11So TV started to get more noticeable flashlighting effect. Seems that as it broke in some they got brighter and now I can see them through some images. I read a lot of people online get this problem but also a lot don't. With the size of these nothing is perfect.Anyway I reached out to Amazon and no questions asked they placed a new order and the delivery guys will pick this one up on way out.I did also notice on this TV I do have 2 stuck pixels. They are the yellow ones too but from 2 or more feet away you can't see them because how small they are.I hope my new one has no stuck (even though couldn't tell) and the flashlighting is none or much less. It seems when you first turn on the TV you get no flashlighting but after about an hour of being on its at its brightest.Will update when I get it *crosses fingers****UPDATE*** 7/11/11So new TV came. Box looked not the best which I was worried about (not Amazon's fault).Anyway got it all setup. It has same flashlight issue, but has a few less but still has them. Hopefully they won't get any brighter this time. The upside is this one has no stuck or bad pixels at all and old one had a few yellow ones. (Not that I could see them from more than 2 feet away and I wouldn't RMA with only a few if you cant see them from 2 feet or more away). Like I said before some flashlighting is expected on these types of TV and it also depends on your brightness. They don't show them also for the first hour you turn them on, it's after about an hour they start to show. I can see them simple after an hour on and than putting it on Auto (so it does not dim down) and turning my cable box off so the screen is blank.They are livable and may adjust away better when I re-calibrate.On the other upside Amazon has a GREAT deal right now. Buy this TV from them before end of July and you also get TWO free 3D glasses!! That's extra $160 you save! Just add them to cart at the same time you buy the TV. This TV does not come with any by default but with Amazon doing this AWSOME BUNDLE the value of this TV just got even better!So after all this would I buy this TV again? Yup! It's still a great price and has a nice picture. My only complaints still are minor flash lighting (only visible after being on more than an hour and very minor, someone prob wont see unless I point out), the semi gloss screen and the misleading 240Hz thing as its really only 120Hz. It's still a great buy though. You can't find anything with these features for this price still. It has great apps, built-in Wifi (no dongle to play with or buy even like some Samsungs make you) and it connects to internet without any issues!Buy the TV and get it before july ends so you get the free glasses! You won't regret it. And with Amazon if you have ANY issues they will work with you without question. So you see a few people with issues with lines or something but a simple eMail or call and Amazon takes care of you. That's why I buy from Amazon over BestBuy or Walmart.

Some professional settings can be found if you search the fourms online.I have two issues with this set.1. Off angle viewing is horrible. I sit about 12 feet away from mine and if I'm directly in front of it the picture is awesome. If I move just 3 or 4 feet to the side of it the picture gets washed out or lightens. I looses about 40% of the awesome color. I now notice this in the big box showrooms as well after owning it. This model seems to be the worst when comparing. Other brand LCD's aren't that bad. And Plasmas don't have the issue at all.2. Blue/Purple blobs or artifacts during darker scenes or faster motion camera panning. This is on all inputs: bluray, dish, etc. Some movies or shows you don't notice, but once you see it you always notice it and you cannnot enjoy what your watching. This also seems to be a common problem if you search though online fourms on this model as well.I really want to love this TV but these issues are forcing me to return it and look into getting a plasma instead.  Hope this saves others from hasseling over the returns.

A very nice upgrade with an AWESOME picture quality, a huge difference with the broken one.  But the joy only lasted one day and a half.  Two days after receiving it a vertical yellow line appeared on the left side.  Called Sharp again and one week later they were exchanging the TV again.  It's been four weeks and so far so good.The picture quality of this TV is really awesome.  Actually I like it better than my sister's Bravia.  A ton of cool features like the WIFI.

There were no marks, no dead pixels, etc.  I do have sound-synch issues on some channels, but that is almost certainly a source issue (dish), not the TV's fault, since it varies by channel.As to the quality of the picture, it is as good as any mid-level edge-lit LED TV out there.  Black levels are excellent, much better than the Samsung 40A630 it replaced.  Yes there are some minor uniformity issues when the screen is all black or all white during a transition.  However, letterboxes are very uniformly black, so I'm guessing that again the issue is the source (there is some signal coming in to tell the TV not to be uniformly black or white).  But in watching normal material, there is absolutely no issue -- repeat, no issue -- with uniformity on my TV.  Blacks are black, whites are whatever color white you want to set them in the myriad of controls, the details are all there (no black crush) and like most good LCDs, the image has excellent dimensionality even without 3D.Side note:  some people hate that dimensionality -- they call it \"soap opera effect\" and it particularly annoys them when they watch a movie.  It can be dialed back on this TV, as on most decent LCDs, by changing the film mode settings.  Or for people who absolutely hate the effect, there are many plasmas that don't have the effect at all, and the great thing about the TV market today is that we each can choose the display technology that pleases us most.Speaking of 3D, I have no idea how it looks on this TV, since I didn't buy the glasses.  Someday maybe I'll buy some if they drop to ~$10/pair, but I'll settle for good 2D dimensionality right now, thanks.A little more on color: I don't know if the yellow pixel helps any, but the TV has extensive color management controls in the advanced picture menu, so the colors can be set any way the owner wants.  I have found settings in review sites (flatpanelshd) and forums (AVS) that I like (with a few tweaks of my own), and some that I don't like.  But given the tweak-ability of this TV, I am certain that a professional calibrator could get it very close to the standards, and you should be able to get it to look as good or as bad as you want, based on your own personal preferences.The TV does have a glossy panel, but I have it in a very bright room with lots of windows, and it is much better at retaining color (not washing out) than my 3-year-old Samsung was in the same spot.  Reflections have not been an issue for me.  If you are concerned about reflections, you can get the less-glossy 830 series, but the 835's glossy screen does provide better contrast.The image does wash out off axis.  Not as bad as my old Samsung, but not as good as some of the LGs/Toshibas with IPS panels that I watched for hours in the stores, and certainly not as good as a plasma.  If you watch TV from more than ~45 degrees off axis, get an LG, Toshiba or plasma.Sound quality is fine.  Gets loud enough with minimal distortion, and voices are reasonably clear.  There are multiple settings for sound too, but let's face it, these TV manufacturers are assuming that if you care about sound you'll buy a separate home theater system.  I don't have a separate sound system for this TV, since it isn't my primary home theater, but I might have to get a separate system with lip-synch correction to fix the issues I'm having with certain channels (ESPN in particular).Overall, this is a fine TV, particularly for the grand I paid for it (hundreds cheaper than a new one anywhere else).  I was also set to buy it for the regular street/online price, but Amazon had it in the warehouse, and it worked out great for me, at least so far.", "Date": "September 10, 2011"}, {"Title": "Pretty amazing", "Author": "John D.

The default settings are the showcase video quality and are pretty neat to look at, but aren't so good for movies.

The color possibilities on the set are endless... lots of viewing options.  The dark contrast is reasonable, and the sound is actually pretty good for such a thin panel.

I mean it's flawless. Now, the cable channels are a different story but I don't think it's the TV's deal. this drove me crazy for a while before i realized that some channels re better HD quality then others. You really have to put in a blu ray to evaluate the picture quality because you can't get any better picture then that. Some of my cable channels are 720 also. I have read so many reviews on these tv's that it makes your head spin. Too much saturation, color bleeding.. etc..  I think most TV's are fine when u get them home and have nothing to compare them to. When your in store and have them side by side you can see some differences but there just might need to be some calibration needed. Now the plasmas are just dull looking in the store and I have never liked them for that reason. I like a brighter colorful screen so plasma wasn't an option.AS far as the Quattron 4 color thing, i really don't think it makes any difference with picture but i'm not an expert here. I liked the 52\" size thing as I am in an apt and it was a nice upgrade from my 46\" Samsung. My older Samsung LCD had a great picture also so I don't think I gained a whole lot other then the 6\" display.All in all a nice TV, very happy with it but it needs more apps and a better user friendly USB and DNLA interface. I canb't for the life of me get  that working. Manual says to connect an ethernet cable but no wireless??? Come on Son!  Gonna double check or call Sharp.Update:I found the rest of the applications under vudu and they are real nice. I would say the Samsung interface is much better for this along with the USB navigation.One other thing to note, some people talk about flashlighting effect on the tv, i'm not sure if they are talking about the sparkles that u can see when looking real close to the tv. These are very visible when looking at a standard def picture. They are sometimes noticable on darker scenes also. I saw a review on CNET on HDMI cables and I have to say that this does make a difference. I bought a 60 dollar HDMI cable swapped it out with my standard one that i bought on amazon for like 3 bucks and presto! no more sparkling pixels. Apparently more expensive better quality cables can make a difference.

I'm very happy with this machine.  It meets all the criteria I wanted when I when shopping and it was under my target price.  The picture quality is superb, and it works very well with Netflix.  There are also ample inputs to serve many devices.  I'm currently typing this review connected via VGA (I've been watching Hulu. which also looks good even for 480p!)That said, the one feature I wasn't looking for but got really excited about was the DLNA.  I went out and bought a Seagate NAS drive to serve my media, and managed to connect it to the TV.  The problem is now the TV will only read music files and cannot find videos or photos.  It's not a file format issue because the TV will play the same videos off a USB flashdrive (Also an awesome feature).  My techie brother and I decided it's just poor programming on Sharp's part.  They're relatively new in the DLNA arena and the interface is poor at best.  It is buggy and slow and not intuitive.  The DLNA interface shows file folders that don't exist on the NAS drive and when navigating to folders I know to contain media, I get the message \"No data.\"  Also the remote has its own typical play/pause/stop/skip buttons, however these buttons do NOT work for media played through USB or DLNA.  (They do work for Netflix.)  For USB and DLNA files you're forced to use a set of buttons labeled with letters A B C D that change function depending on what menu you're in...TERRIBLE!  You also cannot browse to a different media type (from music to video ect.) because the music will stop if you leave the \"Music\" menu.  Lame.My only hope of ever being able to use the DLNA feature more successfully is that this TV has upgradable software and maybe just maybe Sharp will fix it.So if the salesman tries to sell you on the DLNA feature of this TV, and/or it's a feature you value in a device, look somewhere else.  I recommend getting a Playstation 3 or XBOX 360 since those two have DLNA down cold.::UPDATE::  The Netflix app has a tendency to crash on occasion requiring a reboot of the machine (off and on again).  It takes 3-4 minutes for it to connect to the wireless so this is a pain when it happens.  It's been 3 months and Sharp still hasn't upgraded the software to fix the DLNA feature, however I'm making good use of a USB thumb drive with video files on it.  So far I haven't run into any incompatible formats.", "Date": "May 15, 2011"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "Unavailable", "Features": "52-Inch class (52-1 or 32 inches diagonal) 3D HDTV display with full HD 1080p resolution.\nLED LCD TV, 240Hz Aquomotion\nSharp X-Gen panel for added brilliance with minimal light leakage\n240Hz Aquomotion\nBuilt in Wireless with Netflix, Vudu, Cinema Now and more", "Name": "Sharp LC52LE835U Quattron 52-inch 1080p 240 Hz 3D LED-LCD HDTV, Black", "ImgURL": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/31nQ4Oj9MPL._SY300_.jpg", "ProductID": "B004NP3D4S"}}
