{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Superb TV", "Author": "Chrisoft", "ReviewID": "R4B2Q5B8TH0TZ", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "I purchased this TV yesterday from Sears.  I kind of went out on a limb because there were no reviews on cnet or amazon for this model.  I did a lot of research about the differences between led LCD and plasma and what ultimately swayed me was the incredibly lifelike picture.  I will try and go over the pros and cons.PROS- picture is incredible.  Everyone I have had over to watch the tv talks about how lifelike it is.  Has 7 different viewing modes, and every aspect of the viewing experience is customize able (ie backlight, hues contrast etc.)- built in wifi!  The comparable Samsung I looked at was \"wifi ready\" but required the purchase of a separate dongle.  Huge value.  I tried out the wifi and it worked flawlwssly.  Able to stream YouTube w-out any buffering.- Smartv - able to pull up Netflix and YouTube almost instantly.  Also has a built in web browser (haven't used the browser yet so no comment on that)CONS- interactive tv menu is above average but not excellent.  However, my old TV was a DLP Samsung, so the tv menu was a lot better than what my Sammy had.- sound is good (again better than my old Samsung) but not incredible.A few final suggestions...the OLP is a feature that automatically adjusts the backlight depending on room light.  I have found this feature is better when turned off.  Make sure to call Sharp to get your product registered.  If you call you will get a three month extension to the one year manuf. warranty...for free.EDIT:  had to return this after only two weeks of use.  Backlight went out.  Got a Samsung LED 52 inch TV almost 8 months ago and it has been superb!", "Date": "April 23, 2012"}, {"Title": "Very pleased with this TV", "Author": "JETALLY", "ReviewID": "R6RGXE7GLFH33", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Easy to set up. Set up wizard was easy and automatic. Took a long time to scan cable channels but it takes just as long or longer with the two VIZIO TV's I own. WIFI was easy to set up. Picture settings are easy to set up with predefined pictures settings as of Movie, Game, Standard, etc. Turn of the back light OCD function though. With that turned on the picture is way to dim at any time of the day. I like that its thin and thinner than my 42 inch vizio. What a difference technology can make in 2+ years. Digital cable channels and Blu Ray movies look amazing on this T.V. I really like the fact when you turn on your Blu Ray player and put a movie in the player that the TV is smart enough to switch to the HDMI port the dvd player is hooked up to. Menu placement, look and controls on the T.V. are pretty good. I like the fact you can do the web apps and cable channels at the same time (Split Screens). Some people complain about the sound but it sounds louder than my 42 inch vizio. With the surround system it sounds sweet and getting a Audio Optical cable replaced with the conventional audio cable makes surround sound even clearer and louder.", "Date": "June 20, 2012"}, {"Title": "Excellent TV.", "Author": "tony", "ReviewID": "R1YB6ABGST4T21", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This is my second Sharp Aquos I love this Tv, excellent quality like the LED, light weight, very thin.

While watching the TV on December 9th, the TV blanked out and the light icon (transluscent arrow) at the bottom of the SHARP logo slowly flashed, followed by a pause, then 2 quick flashes - in a repeated pattern.  Contacted SHARP CUSTOMER SERVICE the same day, who went through the RESET process which was unsuccessful.  The SHARP customer service rep was friendly enough, but the troubleshooting didn't resolve the issue for a brand new product.  Considering the T.V. is brand new out of the box, SHARP offered the FREE EXTENDED AQUOS WARRANTY and scheduled a maintennance call.  Spoke with the T.V. maintennance technician today (December 10th) who advised the light pattern we received indicates a POWER BOARD FAILURE and it will have to be replaced.  I'm not certain if this is a common issue with this specific make and model at this point, but consumers should be aware this may be a trend in the quality of this T.V.  It's disappointing to have something brand new, out of the box, go on the fritz within 48 hours of purchasing it. (This experience has been like driving a brand new car off the lot and having the electrical system go out just blocks down the road.)", "Date": "December 10, 2012"}, {"Title": "Color me happy", "Author": "Wayne Rudolph \"take-1\"", "ReviewID": "RZS1ETNFTRDUD", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I purchased this Sharp 52\" at Sears on sale ($200.00 less then Amazon) approx 5 weeks ago.

Sound is not great, but much better then others that I've heard on similar size TVs. First LED set I've ever owned, and not disappointed with my choice.

As all home video devices (TV, DVD, Blu Ray) seem to come with apps now it was nice to have on here as well. The picture is very sharp and backlight is uniform. The device produces almost no heat and is extremely efficient. The speakers are adequate but if you use a home theater like I do they will rarely be used. I purchased a WD TV Live box to go with it. This allows you to navigate your PC and drives to play any kind of video.

It just popped up one morning.  I thought it was caused by my new HD DirecTV box so I called DirecTV for help.  DirecTV advised me this is a known problem for this model TV and usually the TV is just replaced.Long story - short - I returned this TV to Sears and Sears gave me a 55\" Samsung UN55F6300 to replace the Sharp because Sears no longer sells the 52\" Sharp.  FYI Sharp advised me they no longer sell the 52\" Sharp.I have to say I didn't know how bad the picture was on this 52\" Sharp until I got my Samsung UN55f6300.  The Samsung picture is brilliant and fabulously detailed.Anyhow, I've got my replacement 55\" Samsung on my den wall and it's great.

We have the extended warranty and will be getting a free service call.  I won't recommend this brand to anyone---not a quality item if it gives out in such a short time---plus we have had the other irritating problems with it too---Netflix re-loads multiple times while trying to watch a show, have to exit out and log back in frequently, channels can be very slow to change, etc....After this service call and we continue to have problems, I will bitterly complain to sharp until I get satisfaction---we paid way too much for this TV to settle for this sub par quality.", "Date": "July 15, 2013"}, {"Title": "Great Picture & incredible value.", "Author": "LoveClassicalPiano", "ReviewID": "R1MA4BIIVI5QHM", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "My wife and I bought this TV online during BestBuy's 2012 Cyber Weekend sales blitz for $799. A 52 inch 1080p 120HZ SMART TV w/ 4 HDMI ports, 1 USB port and an AUDIO-out for $799!!. I owned other sharp products and was already a fan so buying this TV was a no brainer!! Was somebody at BestBuy drunk!?!? Well, I snapped this baby up before they could sober up..LOL! It's everything the online ad said it was...and more.  I like playing and learning my new gadgets and this incredible TV certainly qualifies. The first thing I noticed was that blu-ray dvds and FIOS HD movies had that annoying soap-opera-lighting instead of the dramatic movie lighting affect that the studios apply that enhance the movie watching experience. So I started playing with this TV's pre-programmed \"AV MODE', via the TV's remote. AV MODE offers 6 preprogrammed Video settings ( movie, game, pc, auto, dynamic & dynamic(fixed). Wow... if you have this TV, you absolutely must watch games in the DYNAMIC(fixed) AV MODE. I was totally blown away! The screen brightens by like 40% and the colors pop like you wouldn't believe! My wife and I love this TV. Our friends that own a similar featured Samsung are now questioning their decision to pass on this less expensive/ technology loaded cream puff of a TV... WELL DONE...

But...", "Author": "Papa Carlo", "ReviewID": "RCP9ULBIPQGDC", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "Edit after 2 months of use.I have to remove one star. The  \"smart\" part of the TV is just horrible. Netflix is practically unusable. It cannot play most of the movies. The tech support suggesting some magic key combination to remove the netflix account and readding it again. It did help and all movies started playing. But in a day or so the problem repeated. Once you start a movie the download progress bar freezes somewhere in the middle and after a few minutes pops up an unhelpful message. Repeating the actions suggested by the tech support cures the problem but not for long. Readding the netflix accound every day is a hassle considering you need to enter your e-mail and password with the clunky remote control.Sharp is well known for making great LCD panels. This one is no exception. The colors are very natural with adequate brightness. However other electronics and hardware is horrible. Switching between channels is very slow. If you have cable or dish this might not be a problem for you as you change the channel on the cable box anyway.If you want to watch Netflix you naturally turn on the TV and press the \"Netflix\" button. I always fails to connect on the first attempt.  You have to cancel the \"Cannot establish connection\" dialog and try again. While watching Netflix it suddenly tells you, in the middle of a movie, that you have problem with your Netflix subscription ??? So you have to cancel, find the movie you were watching and continue. Very frustrating. There is no zoom modes so if the aspect ratio of a program you are watching is not 16:9 you are stuck with black edges around the picture.Sharp says this is a \"smart\" TV. I do not see anything smart here. My 5 years old Panasonic does everything the newer Sharp does with exception of Wi-fi, Netflix and a few useless applications like Twitter.", "Date": "October 2, 2012"}, {"Title": "Not the best TV for the money", "Author": "Ian", "ReviewID": "R2HOFXXLIEH2Z1", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "I bought this TV because it was on sale and it had a lot of good reviews. Plenty of people have mentioned the pros of the TV, so I'll just focus on the cons that led me to returning the TV. Based on these cons, I returned the TV and purchased the Samsung UN55ES6100 55-Inch 1080p 120Hz Slim LED HDTV (Black). I have had no frustrations with the new TV.- The wireless connection is not consistent - Netflix constantly drops out or is unable to load the content. If Netflix froze, I'd have to exit Netflix and restart the TV.- I could never get great picture quality. Just when I would find a good set of settings, the movie scene would change and I'd have to adjust the image settings again.- The DLNA network option on the TV could not connect to my home network. I spent a lot of time trying to get the TV's network connect option to recognize the content on my home network, but I was never able to get it working. I thought it may have been something to do with my network, but another TV (Samsung) automatically recognized my home network and played movies without problems.- The TV's built-in TV antenna is worthless. Without an external antenna, the TV could not pick up any over-the-air channels. I contacted Sharp about this and they confirmed that the TV's antenna is not very good.- The channel navigation system is not as user-friendly as the Samsung that I bought.- The remote is very finicky. If it's not pointed directly at the TV, the TV will not respond. This is contrast to the Samsung that I purchased.On a final note, the Samsung that I mentioned earlier in this review is currently listed at the same price ($1099) as the Sharp. In my opinion, there's no reason to go with the Sharp at this price point.", "Date": "November 18, 2012"}, {"Title": "Don't Buy a Sharp Product", "Author": "RMac", "ReviewID": "R2ZNXOIWRU3FL4", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I purchased this TV at Best Buy at the end of September, 2012. It has only been 9 months and it has already given out. While watching TV, the power went out on it completely. At the bottom, a light flashes slowly twice, pauses, and then flashes twice rapidly. Called Sharp and they put me through the factory re-set 2-3 times but to no avail. The Geek Squad is coming today but I'm not holding my breath. Seems to me that 9 months is a pretty short life span and I will never purchase another Sharp product!

Easy set up, no issues, excellent picture. Despite using it only a modest amount, it recently stopped working out of nowhere. It sounds like the same problem other reviewers had posted with the two slow blinks, pause, two quick blinks.I ultimately got the newer model of this tv but in 60\", which is effectively the same tv. The new model has a thinner bezel and the speaker isn't as good but the screen and picture is essentially equivalent to my eyes.

They are up-selling the wifi connectivity and it is weak at best. If I had it to do over I would have bought a dumb TV at a better price point and value then added wifi via blue ray or other external device. I also hate to see a 1 year warranty on a product that they claim has potential to last for many years (aka life of the led back-lighting). I hope that brand wise Sharp remains true and is still producing the quality that they made 10 years ago.
