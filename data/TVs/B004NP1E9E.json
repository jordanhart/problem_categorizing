{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Best LED", "Author": "BTideRoll", "ReviewID": "R3EIL7C27S7F67", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I shopped around for awhile trying to decide between plasma and LED. I went to a few stores to see the TVs in person and to compare all the different brands and features. I had seen commercials for the Sharp Quattron so I specifically wanted to check it out.Hands down the Quattron has the best, brightest, and clearest picture amongst the LED/LCDs. I looked at all the plasmas which just seemed so dull compared to the LEDs and specifically the Quattron. I wanted the LED because it weighed less, consumed less energy, was brighter, and didn't have the risk of burn in or a plasma TV hum, or the glare issue everyone is talking about. It comes down to personal preference really and the debate will never end over which technology is better. But you CAN use facts to determine which to purchase. If you don't care about viewing angle, and want a brighter picture, lower weighing and power consuming product, then you choose LED. The newest LEDs really do have good black levels compared to prior years LCDs.The Quattron's colors truly are more crisp and richer than even other LEDs that I compared it to--it was so obvious with all of them side by side (especially with scenes containing yellow). I found the colors to be pretty realistic, true, bold, and rich. Some reviews I read were saying how the colors seemed unreal or fake. You be the judge. You can calibrate this TV however you want so each to his own with regards to color. I left it on standard and everything looked great right out of the box.It isn't as \"fast\" on paper as some of the 240hz models (mainly those with 3d), but it doesn't need to be. I'm not worried about motion because my 3 year old regular LCD with 120hz from samsung handled sports and motion just fine, and this TV does as well. As the other reviewer was stating, this 120hz motion engine is a beast. It, at times, makes you feel like you are on the set the movement is so smooth. Sometimes it may seem artificial its so realistic/smooth as he was stating so you can turn down some of the effects depending on what you are watching. I've compared this movement to other TVs and the movement is *consistent* on this TV and has no blur, whereas on some other LED/LCDs you will notice edge blur even on regular shows and I'd hate to see those on sports.I'm upgrading from a 46\" Samsung Touch of Color that was top of the line back in 2008 and this 40\" Sharp blows it out of the water in every way. I'm going to be upgrading to the 46\" version of the Quattron since I love it so much.Network setup was easy, it found my home wireless network. I was really impressed by the built in wi-fi. I didn't even have to configure anything. I just turned the TV on, it found my network, and immediately asked if I wanted to upgrade to the latest software/firmware. The Netflix and other apps work fine, but honestly just about EVERY device now has all these built in apps (my ps3, blue player, and now the TV).  So I prefer to use the apps via my PS3 to take the burden, if any, from the TV. Sound is plenty for this TV, but you can obviously upgrade to a home theatre system. I was satisfied with the built in sound and it was plenty loud for my needs.Bottom line is this is a very high quality LED. I have never invested in a Sharp product. I've always stuck with Samsung, but this TV has won me over. It is so high quality from the TV to the remote control (love it). You see this quality in the price, and with TVs, you get what you pay for.Final verdict? I am completely satisfied with this TV. It's very thin, light weight, bright, gives an awesome picture, and has good audio. If you want this caliber of a TV, but don't need the built in Wi-Fi (for many reasons), you can save money and get the 810 series. If you want all the bells and whistles get the 830 series, and if you want everything plus the 3D, try the 835 series.", "Date": "June 14, 2011"}, {"Title": "Turn off Film Mode", "Author": "G-Prime", "ReviewID": "R2DCZ9KUFPUF5G", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "At first I couldn't believe how unbelievably clear things looked! But then it started to weird me out a bit. I felt like I was the camera man and at times it took me out of the story. Also I noticed way too much detail in animated films and they didn't quite seem as fluid as they should be. In action based movies I started noticing that certain parts were suddenly moving a slight bit faster than seemed normal. This is when I really started to investigate all the features. To make a long story short, I figured out that the setting called film mode was giving these awkward effects. Basically turn it off to have a better viewing experience. The TV looks fantastic without the added feature so it's pretty much unnecessary for most situations.Also make sure you do some color calibrations. Start with the movie AV mode and work your way from there.Just remember no TV is perfect out of the box no one setting is perfect for everyone. Play around with the colors and settings until it looks good to you.

Overall, once this TV is setup correctly and all calibration and adjustments are made, it is by far one of the best TVs out there in terms of picture quality, clarify and accuracy. The out of box setting is acceptable but will feel like you are at a big box electronics store. There are a few calibration settings out in various forums so just search for them, try them all and choose your pick.  There is some clouding especially when displaying blacks but nothing that will stand out during a normal movie. It is not distracting enough to take your attention away from any movie. Overall blacks are great. TV is loaded with features and options starting from full calibration settings to internet apps galore. One big con is that the navigation menu/software is far from superior. In fact, it can be downright horrible at times. You will get used to it but it could be better. Internet WI-FI built in is great but getting a good signal is not the best. I ended up using a wired connection with a wireless repeater. The TV tuner is borderline. It takes a few seconds to switch between channels regardless of advancing channels or punching in the channel numbers. Like other reviewers said, do not count of advancing channels, just punch in the actual channel you are looking for.  Finally, this LED TV is the best value out there. For the price, you cannot go wrong. It is clearly about $200 cheaper than the competition and Sharp makes their own LCD panels.  Here are a few calibrations  from various sources.

Backlight on max as well (my preference) and it still looked amazing. Tested it on Alien which contains many dark and simply plain black screens. It was hardly brighter than that of the TV being off just because of the backlight.  - 120Hz: Not the best 120Hz I've seen, but it does the job. A TINY amount of motion blur, but definitely not enough to remove a star.  - Viewing angles: Excellent. I have my TV mounted wall about 3 feet higher than eye level. When I stand up to match eye level it looks as if the TV didn't change brightness, color, or anything of the sort.  - Color: Although some may think of that extra yellow sub-pixel for RGBY as a gimmick, it definitely is working in some way. Every color pops especially the yellow/golds. All of this is adjustable if its a turn off to those who do not prefer somewhat over saturated colors.  - Active Contrast: Known to most as \"Dynamic Contrast\" where contrast will change depending on scene. It works very well here and I actually use it. It instantly gives a noticeably better picture when selected. It slowly changes depending on the brightness of the scene as on other manufacturers' models \"Dynamic Contrast\" would be a flashy mess as they struggle to keep up with fast moving pictures. Here it works the best I've ever seen.Aesthetics:Thin and sexy. Front panel has thin edges as well and simple enough to not distract. Bottom silver edge gives this TV a sleek look along with the lit Sharp logo in the middle. Front panel buttons are touch sensitive and easy to use.Remote:Has many buttons so I don't have to go searching through the menu to change something when I can do it on the fly. Only problem is that the remote isn't backlit which I would have liked.Connections:4 HDMI, 1 or 2 component not sure, etc. HDMI stick off the side so if you decide to wall mount this TV they're easily accessible. I only useWiFi:I don't use it, but this TV has many apps and DLNA.Customization: Many more features and little things to be enabled/disabled throughout the menus. Probably 30-40 sub-settings just for color. Many security features on this TV as well. Most options I've ever seen.", "Date": "July 30, 2011"}, {"Title": "Great TV lots of inputs", "Author": "Picky Parker", "ReviewID": "R1VB8ENGVUYBAE", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I purchased a 37\" LG 37LV5300 and the picture was good but the speakers were horrible, there was some motion blur (even though it was also 120hz) and whenever the screen was supposed to be totally black you could see the LED bleeding through on the corners.  This TV is so much better!  It is a bit more expensive but I plan to keep it for a while and it really is worth the price difference.  The blacks are really dark and the picture is very stable and the 120 hz refresh rate allows you to watch movies at 24 frame a second rate that they are filmed in (most US movies are filmed at 24 frames per second so if your tv has a refresh rate of 60 hz then the tv has to double up on some frames.  It isnt very noticeable but it makes a difference. I believe broadcast is 30 frames  a second so it doesn't make a difference.  For a flat screen it has amazing sound and while not a house shaker the speakers are not tiny at all (a huge improvement over the LG). Another nice feature is that the screen will adjust the back lighting to match the light level of the room, it works really well, and is much better than a similar feature on my laptop. The screen has a semi matte finish and it does a great job of reducing reflections and has a very wide viewing angle which is great because our tv room does not have the best setup.  The tv also has energy saving features like one that will turn it off if it has been idle for 3 hours.The TV has lots of features and an Aquos link that allows it to control other devices like your DVD player when you select your DVD input.  The TV over the air receiver is pretty good although with the newer digital tv there is a slight lag.  I think the LG had a better receiver but I don't watch too much over the air.  It does have 4 hdtv inputs which is good for me as I can plug in my DVD player and PC (it also has a VGA input if your pc doesn't have a HDMI.  It also has a mini plug input that works well with my computers sound (my video card does not have sound over HDMI although some do).  The sound input is shared between HDMI 1 (with ARC, read below) and the VGA input.One really nice feature is its internet applications. I only use the Netflix but the interface is great, you can even search for movies using an onscreen keyboard function and when you finish watching an episode of a tv series and go back to the menu the screen prompts you to play the next episode without going back to your queue.  This is much better than the blu ray player or Netflix's own Roku box where you have to add the episodes with a computer before watching.If I could I would take a half star off because it has some time lag issues with the sound with my DVD.  I have a Sony 770w blu ray and it synced up fine with the LG but I had to adjust the player so that the sound matched the video on the Sharp.  If your DVD doesn't have that ability it might be a problem.  I also noticed the same thing with the PC but it is very very minor.  I haven't tried it with other devices such as a xbox or playstation. I called tech support and they said I might need to unplug and then plug things back in to allow the devices to sync better but that didn't work.  I did try to reduce the processing effects and smoothing but it did not help and really reduced picture quality. Another minor issue is that only one of the 4 HDMI has ARC audio return channel which should reduce the audio sync problem although it didn't.  ARC allows audio to go back from the TV to your receiver which should help remove any lip sync issues or allow you to pass through audio when say watching over the air tv back to your receiver without an extra cable.Lastly the HDMI cables go in on the side so you have to bend them down at a sharper curve than I prefer so that they do not poke out from behind the side. If you use a small strap to bundle them or to keep the wires from the edge it is not a problem.  or use 45 degree adapters).Overall it is a very nicely made TV with a great picture and sound.Quick update: TV still working great,  the remote is just okay and is a bit long for the number of buttons. One issue I am having is with the Aquos Link which allows you to control devices like the bluray through the tv. A huge downside is that when you change the volume it adjusts both the TV and the device you actually want to control.  I think I will program the remote buttons to work with the DVD directly which should provide good DVD control without the volume issue.I also found a setting that turns off the illuminated insignia on the front that lets you know the tv is on (only visible when the TV is on so you cant see it in any of the stock pictures).  It is a bright white symbol that was a little annoying.  Now it turns on when you turn on the tv but fades to off after a couple of seconds.  Downside is that it is hard to tell if is even on although an issue as the set turns itself off after a bit as mentioned above.10/30/2011 UpdateI have had this tv for a couple of months and it works flawlessly.  I also picked up an X-Box 360 with Kinnect and there is no lag or delay even when you pan quickly.  One other positive feature is that it has at least one (haven't tried adding more) user customizable screen setting function (like game. movie, standard, dynamic) that gives you one more pre-set setup.  I use it for games that have darker images/backgrounds to make it easier to play.The screen also seems to be very anti static/dust as my whole setup was very dusty but the screen itself was clean.", "Date": "July 2, 2011"}, {"Title": "Think Twice if You Want to Wall Mount This", "Author": "G. McBrien", "ReviewID": "RWQ3IJFHIIK0P", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I got this TV to replace another brand that failed after several years and wanted to put it in place of the failed one on articulated wall VESA mount. I immediately noticed it didn't match up to any of the holes on the mount and so I looked in the manual to determine the spacing.The manual states that you should only use the Sharp wall mount which, from the pictures, appears to only tilt downwards slightly. As close as I can measure it using an inch/foot tape-measure, the spacing appears to be 300 x 300 so I bought some adapters. These don't quite make it. After several attempts to adjust them close enough I was able to insert 3 out of 4 screws. I've got another adapter on order so maybe that will work out better. I like the picture, and the sound is much better than my previous TV however I've spent more time on the mount than I have watching the TV. The TV is relatively light so why, other than wanting to make more money, they just didn't make this a standard VESA mount and say so, I have no idea.Other than that, I don't like the fact that they pointed the HDMI ports in the direction away from the TV and put them on the far edge. Most people I assume are going to run any cables back to the center of the TV, especially if it is wall mounted and this necessitates bending all the cables back on themselves.", "Date": "August 28, 2011"}, {"Title": "Excellent T.V.", "Author": "Squirrel", "ReviewID": "R3C2KZYG55MVXX", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I don't usually write reviews but just noticed this as the deal of the day and went, \"THAT'S THE T.V. I JUST BOUGHT!\" I figured adding in my 2 cents might help since I had a hard time finding reviews when I bought mine. I've had it for about a month now. I bought it at a brick and mortar store that was selling it for 600 on sale. My two major questions were what effect was the 4th yellow subpixel going to have and how well would this t.v. respond to inputs for gaming. The t.v. is extremely thin, no more than a couple of inches thick, gives off no discernible heat (unlike my old t.v.) and uses little power. Another nice thing is that most of the jacks/ports are on the side as opposed to the back which provides easier access. The t.v. also has a swivel base as well which makes it easier to access the back if needed or to adjust the viewing angle if necessary.The yellow subpixel, doesn't seem to really do anything. I haven't conducted controlled testing or anything but I just don't really notice anything in particular about yellows. Now as for the image quality as a whole, I love it. Vibrant colors, sharp images. I have a small room with my bed in the middle so I end up watching t.v. typically from about 4 feet away. I can't notice artifacts or distortion at this distance, it's amazing to me. Now again, some people have much higher standards than I do but the contrast also impresses me. My last t.v. as well as some of my old flat screens had weak contrast, black was a light blueish sort of color. I'm not sure if it's the switch to LED with this t.v. or something else but the blacks are more than dark enough for me.As for gaming, I've hooked up my PC to the t.v. through a mini-hdmi to hdmi cable. If you want to do this you'll have to check what video outputs your computer has and buy the appropriate cable. I play first person shooters so response time is fairly important. Fortunately the t.v. has a gaming setting. With other modes there's an obvious delay in response time but in gaming mode I haven't noticed any delay. Again, if you consider yourself a hardcore ubergamer master, you might have more discriminating criteria and sit there with a stopwatch but from my anecdotal aggregate experience, there's no lag that I'm able to notice.A complaint I remember seeing was that the remote was too long, which was, to me, a weird complaint. It's long, don't get me wrong, it's about as big as my foot (I wear 10.5 men's US) so that might tell you something. It's not bothersome though and you can always use a universal remote if you really want to. One thing that was really crazy was that somehow, the t.v. remote controls my PS3. As soon as I switched to the appropriate HDMI port the PS3 automatically turned on and the t.v. remote was able to control the menu. I was sitting there surprised, confused and all nerding out. Maybe this is old tech but I've never seen it at any friend's house or had anything like it before. I never looked into why it works but I think the remote has some sort of wireless connectivity, probably bluetooth, and somehow automatically retrieved settings from the PS3. Either way that was just a really cool moment.Basically I've loved this t.v. so far and haven't regretted it for a second. Buying a t.v. is always kind of a big deal because it's one of those things you'll most likely be using for a few years. If you end up buying this one though, I hope you love it as much as I do.

You can enhance it even further with Film mode that practically turns everything into looking like daytime soap opera feel. I had to tone it down to just 120Hz Low (there is low and high) and Film mode off to strike the best balance of beautiful smooth picture without the weird feeling of seeing everything as if they're cheesy soap opera show.- Great viewing angle, from side to side should be almost equal to a plasma.- Sound is pretty good, not home theater quality, but very decent and loud enough.- Netflix picture is surprisingly awesome quality, better than the output from my LG BluRay player and Logitech Revue Google TV, and the TV is actually the farthest from my wireless router with the lowest signal possible.- Panel is light and fairly easy to set up with a sturdy standCons:- The stand only has swivel, no tilt and height adjustment. Presumably not an issue since most people probably gonna hang it anyway.- Remote should have at least been printed with glow-in-the-dark marking if they're not going to make it backlighted. As it is, while functional, it looks easily the most outdated remote in the house.- Being edge-lit there seems to be slightly darker regions in the corners. I was not even looking for it, but while watching certain scenes you just kinda have that feeling why the lighting is unnaturally darker in some spots, then you localize it to just the corners of the TV.Conclusion:My 5-year old Vizio plasma somehow still look better despite being 720p (and did I mention 5-year old?). This is no plasma, but I reckon this is as good as it gets with LCD and for consuming only one-tenth the power the plasma does surely makes you feel less guilty about having it on all the time. With the 120Hz turned on you can hardly notice any movement blur, but push it all the way and suddenly it turns everything into daytime soap opera. If motion smoothness is what you're looking for, this TV does not disappoint AT ALL, but you may be disappointed since at the highest setting it will weird you out.", "Date": "August 26, 2011"}, {"Title": "Great quality", "Author": "Dr Trish", "ReviewID": "R1BVXQW9ZCRCNY", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I have a 3 year old Samsung 1080P flatscreen and thought it had a great picture.

Initially, I was looking for a 46 inch Plasma/LCD and found most good one's to be 900 dollars or more. I had narrowed down my choices to either a Samsung LCD/Panasonic Plasma after reading several reviews. I was very particular about picture quality and design. Though Plasma's are said to reproduce very accurate picture, I decided against it after learning that they consume a lot of power. Then on, I set my eyes on LED attracted by their low power consumption (13$/year if used 5 hrs a day all days on this one. That is something !). Samsung LED's were very expensive and so I reduced my requirement to 40 inch from 46 inch. The price difference wasn't as much as I'd expected it to be on most brands only until I stumbled upon this Sharp in amazon. I had never heard much about Sharp but decided to give it a serious thought. The reviews were just okay but the features were awesome (built in wifi, high contrast ratio, quattron etc). For the price and a brand like Sharp, I said let me take a chance. Frankly, the TV turned out to be beyond my expectations. Here's what I liked. Its really slim and the picture quality is just amazing. Colour looks brilliant and rich (neither artificial like some Samsungs nor dull like certain Sony's). Network setup was a breeze and the software is kept simply and easy to navigate. And not to forget, the sound quality is superb. At this price, this LED is a great VFM with no compromise in class and quality. The only small negative I can think of is the remote. It lacks any lighting or flourescent print which makes it difficult to operate when its dark. This TV discerns a good review from a well known forum like CNET. This TV is certainly not well represented in most sites.

I love watching movies, and while I know a film's FPS (24) isn't as fluid, for some reason the \"home video\" fluid look that 120Hz is proving isn't as off-putting as I had originally thought.LED backlighting - saves 40~50% in energy costs compared to a CCFL-backlit LCD.  And should last far longer.Detail - images are crisp and a number of settings can smooth jagged edges (QuadPixel), add sharpness, clear up DVD compression artifacting (\"noise reduction\") to an extent, etc.Weight - for being 40\", this weighs less than my 32\" CCFL set. :)Price.  I wouldn't pay $1200 for this model, not when one gets stuck pixels out of the box.  (But no dead pixels were found, and those typically can't be fixed.)digital audio pass-through, to make connecting a Blu-ray player's own digital output port unnecessary.  Especially when one has 3 HDMI devices that would make use of the external Dolby 5.1 receiver!Cons:Unlike the composite, VGA, and other inputs, the HDMI ports are put on the left side - making cable organization more difficult, and with cables sticking out beyond the front edge, L-shaped adapters would be needed for ideal organization... unless you like seeing cables everywhere...Once color is calibrated, everything looks great.  Out of the box, depending on mode, there's a blue tint or a yellow tint.  I also found that disabling 'extended color' yields a more accurate color gamut, though I won't deny enabling the extended mode really adds vibrancy to outdoor settings.  Skin tones do end up being a tad oversaturated with it enabled, though.The integrated speakers produce a good range (bass/treble/midtones), but even at top volume it's fairly quiet.For an-originally $1200 set, there should be no pixels.  Why no QC from the manufacturer?  As a customer, I feel less than cozy about this trend.Angled viewing - straight-on is good, but at steep angles (e.g. 45 degrees) there's some color fading, but no color-shift is noted.  The panel used is probably a VA panel.  IPS is best, but I've read companies that use TN panels.  Definitely wouldn't pay even $300 for one of those.)Sadly the unit I bought was the last model available and contains 2 stuck pixels (white, blue-white), for which I am looking at possible options without having to return it as I really do like this model.  But only when I use the TV as a monitor do these pixels stand out, and that's only if I have a dark background.  (If companies did their own QC, imagine how much time customers AND stores would save due to less processing costs and time...)Uneven backlighting - this is inevitable for any TV or monitor, but once you see it, you can't un-see it.  I can handle edge bleed, but the unit I set up has a couple of rounded lit areas toward the left/middle that should remain dark.  It's only noticeable in movies involving outer space or totally dark rooms, but still - the lack of QC at the factory is pretty depressing, and that's the ultimate point to my gripes about backlighting and stuck pixels.  If the company does a good job, the store and customers don't have to go through extra rigamarole and hassle.All in all, it's a good buy for $650 - the competition doesn't really compare; the features in this model make it too good a value.  Just spend time to calibrate it, and if you do see dead pixels or find too much unevenness to the backlighting, weigh the pros and cons of getting an exchange.Will I buy Sharp again?  Probably.  Worse brands to exist, but the lack of QC is worrisome.", "Date": "September 4, 2011"}, {"Title": "Sharp Quattron", "Author": "James A. Menczkowski", "ReviewID": "R3W1FQXIN516BL", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This is the second sharp T.V. I have purchased. The first one was nine years ago [37\"] and is still working well W/O any defects or problems despite the excessive hours it has played. Sharp is one of the few companies that makes their own displays and it is evident in the advances in product development. The color quality in the Quattron screen is unsurpassed by any other unit in its class. After viewing it in several retail stores I decided to upgrade and have not been disappointed in the picture clarity and vastly improved color, especially in H.D. viewing. The 120 Hz rate has to my estimates completely eliminated any blur that I have seen on my friends slower 75 Hz Tv's when viewing live sports. I cannot comment on the TV game mode as this is not used. The WiFi setup was simple and uneventful and I did not encounter any glitches or problems and the number of apps is sufficient for my viewing needs. The remote is properly designed to access WiFi and the menu is sufficiently easy to navigate.All in all...You get what you pay for...The unit sells retail for around $1,100. I payed $799 for mine, but have seen it drop in price to $650+ then watched it go back up to $850...So if you are planing to purchase from Amazon I would suggest placing the model you want in your wish list and watch the price (Amazon makes adjustments daily, depending on the vendors they list) and your sure to get it at a reasonable price. Unlike American manufacturers the Pacific rims countries will lower their wholesale pricing to keep their factories working and have made the onetime expensive LCD's affordable.

We were slowed down with setup as the directions lacked specifics on entering the passphrase for the wifi; they wrote \"enter passphrase using the keyboard\".  Although the textbox to enter the passphrase had focus on the tv, the keyboard did not automatically show.  By chance, I had pressed <enter> in the textbox and got the keyboard to appear.Previously we've had a CRT tv, and it broke.  So I needed a replacement and decided to upgrade.  The picture is great although the HD takes some getting used to and it may still need some picture adjustment.  I don't need to see every blemish and make-up mark on an actor's face.  It does give a feeling that I am right in the studio watching the filming.  Long shots, like a couple walking down a hall corridor, appear a bit squished given the wide screen.On pricing, I learned to go slower.  A 3rd party seller sold the tv and it arrived quickly and in great condition.  However, the next day, Amazon was selling the same model directly for about $50 less (and probably no sales tax).The low price guarantee that Amazon touts didn't apply in this sense.", "Date": "August 4, 2011"}, {"Title": "Awesome TV!! Great picture, super thin..", "Author": "nick P", "ReviewID": "R2JVA4VF61BI9N", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I originaly started my search for a TV with a top end Samsung in mind. I've had many friends with samsung's and they all spoke highly of them. However, owning a Sharp bought back in 2006 that is still going strong, made the sharp brand an obvious 2nd pick. I was looking for something thin, great picture, 120hz and internet(smarTV) connectivity. I went to best buy to begin my search and was really only looking for a 32\" (for the 32\" price range). It wasn't until I came to Amazon to do a review search that I filtered for top reviews that I came across the sharp quattron. At first I was hesitant, not that I didn't believe that sharp was a good brand, considering I already owned/own one, I was just flooded with positive reviews about the samsung's. But when I found that the Sharp Quattron had the highest reviews in best buy AND Amazon and to top it all off best buy had a sale for $500 for the 40\" I jumped on it. I have not at all been disappointed.First off, Picture quality is phenomenal. Netflix streamed flawlessly. VUDU has several apps (pandora, NETFLIX, CNN, etc) that are very useful and work perfectly.Sound quality is \"iffy\".  I will say it is being used for a master bedroom (15'X18')and at 1/3 volume it is\" enough to be almost loud. It is plenty for a medium or even large bedroom. But if this is going to be your main Living or entertainment room TV then I suggest you get a seperate sound system. Im not even the least bit upset about the sound quality however. Even mentioning sound quality on a TV that is literally 1.3\" deep is almost picky. Considering most of these new super thin tv's have speakers probably no bigger than 2-3\"  Im surprised it is as loud as it is.  If you even have a TV for a common room that doesn't not have even a cheap sound system you are an idiot if you complain. One little feature that it does have that I like is an analog audio out (3.5mm). I connected a cheap logitec speaker system to it and I can have a whole complete range of sound, however you can't control the volume from the remote....whatever. Eventually I will get a cheap sound system for the bedroom until then I will take the cheap route.Long story short, this TV is outstanding. I've only had it roughly a month and I haven't found anything I dislike about it. I even bought a cheap \"picture hanger\" style wall hanger for it on ebay ($29) that works perfectly.

The other reason for buying the Sharp LC40LE830U Quattron model is its 120Hz capability which only a few other 40\"+ LED HDTVs offer in the Quattron's price range.Overall, I am quite satisfied with this purchase and would recommend the LC40LE830U to anyone.", "Date": "September 23, 2011"}, {"Title": "\"IT'S LIKE BEING IN THE PROGRAM!\" + TECH REVIEW", "Author": "Eric", "ReviewID": "R38MQHMRN33YMK", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "(GIST OF IT) All my friends say how they feel they are in the program we will be watching at the time. Heard at two different times from two different friends. This TV is, plain and simple, great. I don't have the time to write a long and detailed technical review (not that I'm a super TV guru) BUT I will tell you this:1) (PICTURE QUALITY) Picture is so crisp and clear. I have lights (fluorescent and yellow) all around my room and the Sharp Aquos 40\" BARELY reflects them at all. SO BRIGHT LIGHTS= AWESOME PICTURE & LOW LIGHTS= INCREDIBLE PICTURE. Also, the picture is still flawless from any angle you can view it from. (EXCEPT..up real close of course) Which leads me into my next point.2) (PIXELS-QUAD) I didn't think going from a conventional RGB pixel to a red/blue/green/YELLOW pixel would make a difference.....it most certainly does (in my opinion).3) (INTERNET READY) Some people complain about the Internet Apps being lame. Well, unless you're hardcore into the app scene, the apps are pretty sweet! I suppose one thing that is a negative is if you want FaceShmook, you need to log into the Vudu App first but frankly, the Vudu App is AWESOME! It's essentially the \"X-finity or FIOS On-Demand\" screen and has everything including updated shows. IN ADDITION, it's internet ready so I wouldn't be surprised if they came out with an update that would support WEB BROWSING.4) (HARDWARE/PORTS) The ports are kinda inconveniently located on the side (well just 2/4 hdmi ports and 1/2 USB ports; the rest of on the back) BUT if you have a thick/tough wire, it may stick out a little from the side.5) (DESIGN/LOOK) The whole look of the TV is glossy/sleek with curved edges. VERY nice. There's an upside down \"V\" that glows when it's on but you can turn that off in the settings.6) (SET-UP) Oh yeah, if your technologically \"impaired\" it is a quite an EASY SET-UP. I was highly impressed as I was almost looking for a challenge since I feel I face them all the time with technology.7) (FUN)- I am dying to play with this piece of awesomeness whenever I am away from it. I can't say that you will but if you're a tech-junkie that yearns for QUALITY, you probably won't be disappointed.***CONS***- The only negative comments I can make include the internet updates (which, for the older models, don't always upload right away and are not hastily posted online -to update by USB) AND...that the box it was shipped in looked like...well, it looked like P00P!3.

The wireless connectivity and apps are a nice addition, especially the Netflix app.  It is exactly the same app as the one on the PS3, so I deleted the PS3 device from netflix and added the Sharp instead.  No reason to have two devices on when the apps do the same thing.  The TV is super thin and uses very little power... it doesn't heat up a room like my friend's Plasma or LCD HDTV!

The picture is very sharp but also because of the quad pixel technology it gives a certain softness so that it doesn't fatigue your eyes like some TVs do.  I used the settings listed by T Chens review and then from there I adjusted it to my taste as far as how much of the yellows, blues and greens I wanted. Once you get this adjusted to how you like it then other TVs look very bland.  The Yellow that they integrate into the colors does indeed make the greens and blues really pop! For my purposes I found I had to back the yellow off a tad. Once I did that I still had the great green and blue tones that Sharp talks about but they didn't push the colors into artificial looking territory. Like I mentioned earlier, you will need to adjust it for your taste but if you pop in about 5 of your favorite blu-ray discs it may only take an hour or so to tweak it. This TV is EXTREMELY adjustable. You can take it from a blande gray to an insane world of super bright crazy colors.  If anyone reviews it and says they didn't like the picture then I suspect they just didn't take the time to adjust it properly. There are plenty of HDMI jacks as well as RCA jacks so hookup is flexible and easy. The menu functions and apps are a breeze to use as each has a dedicated button on the remote. One important thing for me was to have access to netflix and vudu. The only one application I wish they had was the Amazon application. My blue ray entertainment center has that so its no loss but it would have been nice.  I have used the USB in function and 720p and 1080p vids and movies look great. I popped a half dozen vids on a flash stick and put it in and it picks them up immediately. The speakers are really good for a TV set. They go very loud and have a decently full sound for a built in flat panel TV. All my blu-ray movies look terrific and regular TV that is broadcasted in HD is a real treat! I cant think of another TV I would rather have than this one. If it were stolen I would definitely get another one.

I was originally looking to get a 46 inch Sony Bravia 3D LED, but the salesman there left me waiting for over 30 minutes and I ended up finding this TV for sale ($629 canadian).  I've had my eye on the Sharp Aquos Quattron TV's for a few years now, ever since I saw them on display and was blown away by the image quality on the blu-ray movies they had playing in-store.  For the price, it seemed like too good a deal to pass up so I grabbed the box and took it to the cashier.After setting up the TV, the first thing I did was hook up my PS3 and put on the BBC documentary Planet Earth.  My girlfriend and I were both blown away by the quality of the images.  Compared to my 4 year old 27\" inch 720p Sony LCD, the Sharp blows it away.  It did take a lot of messing around with the menu to figure out how to tune everything and I can see a lot of people being frustrated because the menu options are not very well named so it took some trial and error to figure out how to turn off the power light below the Sharp logo and how to turn on the HDMI 2,3,and 4 ports.I mainly bought this TV to put in the basement/man-cave so that I could play xbox and ps3 on.  Other than the bigger screen, I wouldn't say it's a big step up from my old LCD for games since games only output 720p graphics, but there is no ghosting when the screen goes from light to dark and I didn't notice any lag.For watching movies, like I said before, Blu-Ray looks great.  I've also hooked up a FAT32 USB key and watched a movie that was 1.36 gb big and it still looked pretty good.  Last night, I hooked up my 500gb NTFS portable hard drive and we watched a 720p HD mkv movie file.  The TV had no problems playing it and there were no hiccups in the playback.  I also had no issues setting up wifi on the TV, I went into the menu option, hit the search button, then hit the quick connect button on my router.  The TV and router found each other and setup the connection automatically.  I have not tried the DLNA home network option, I'm not familiar with this and looked up online to try to set it up, but there wasn't too much info online about it.  Since I can just use the usb connection for hard drives and hook up my android tablet to one of the HDMI ports, I'm not too worried about streaming content over the network to the TV through DLNA, if that's what it's for.  There's also a vga input so I can hook up my laptop and use the TV as an extended monitor.I'm not an audiophile, so you're opinion may differ but I have no issues with the audio.  Movies sound fine to me, I usually wear my Astro A40 gaming headset for games.  The gaming headset is hooked up to the TV through the usb and digital out connection.In summary, this is a versatile TV with great image quality and the ability to play a variety of video files off of different usb devices makes this a very worthwhile purchase.PROS+beautiful images and vibrant colours+ability to connect FAT32 or NTFS usb devices+ability to play different video files (avi, mkv, etc)+smooth video playback off of usb devices+the TV saves individual settings (even the volume level) for different inputs -EDIT(Jan 16, 2012) The TV only saves individual volume setting from input to input, sorry for the confusion.+easy to setup wifi connection, depends on if your router has the quick connection optionCONS-menu options are vague, making it a bit difficult to setup/configure the TV to the way you want it (HDMI ports 2-4 were turned off, it took a bit of digging to find the option to turn them on, but the on/off option for the arrow light under the logo was easy enough to find).The first LCD I bought was a 17\" Sharp computer monitor that crapped out on me after 2 years, I will update my review if this TV starts to have any problems.", "Date": "January 11, 2012"}, {"Title": "Super TV at a Great Price", "Author": "black creek", "ReviewID": "R3RG5BPZQUJZKY", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This TV is everything the good customer reviews say it is.

Competitors were the Samsung LN40D630, LG Infinia 42LV5500, LG 42LV3500.  I didn't want to spend over $650 and that price point was set by the list price for this tv on amazon.  I wanted an LED for their superior clarity and vividness in comparison to LCDs.  One of my requirements was that the tv have a headphone-out port (3.5mm jack), which is surprisingly uncommon for such a basic feature.  I had to have headphone jack to output audio to my Logitech Z2300's.  The next issue was whether to get 60 or 120Hz refresh rate, I decided to ante up for the 120hz from reading that you can start to discern between 60 and 120 Hz refresh rates at 40\"+, and so that the tv is \"current technology\" for a longer period of time.  I ordered this tv with $3.99 overnight, which is awesome, but the first one that came wouldn't turn on, the packaging had a significant dent in it - could have been UPS or the mailroom at my school, either way, amazon has a laser focus on customer service and satisfaction.  So, I just had to repackage the tv in its box, UPS picked it up the next day, and the replacement tv came two days later.  Turning it on and admiring the clarity mollified the frustrations from its DOA predecessor.Now that its working and up and running, my initial impression is that it's a great tv.  I used the calibration settings posted in these comments that was quoted from AVS forums.  However, after watching a handful of different 1080 movies/documentaries, I have fiddled with the calibration and decided I like \"Dynamic Mode\" the most - colors are extremely vivid, I switch the setting to \"USER\" (set according to AVS) or \"Gaming\"  mode for video games though.PROS:-->I play online games on PS3 and there is no discernible motion blur.-->I have watched Planet Earth, BBC's Life and Inception in 1080p via my computer thru HDMI and it looks truly fantastic.  Even though my 2011 MacBook Pro only outputs (via MiniDisplay port to HDMI) at 60 Hz refresh rate.CONS:<--Not a huge deal to me as a college student, but the perpendicular angle of HDMI inputs on the left side causes HDMI cables to protrude past the side of the screen (instead of  inputs that plug in vertically and run down, instead of across).  If I ever wall mount it, I would just buy a 90 degree HDMI adapter joint, so you could hide the cords down the back of the screen.GENERAL:I'd highly recommend this tv, though now that it's more expensive, there would be a different set of competitors.  I would definitely at least initially compare some comparable Sony's, LG's and Samsungs, just because their reputations for quality are all higher than Sharp.  Also, I highly recommend buying this (or any expensive electronics) using a credit card that extends the factory warranty coverage; my amex doubles the duration of the warranty and it makes a world of difference in providing peace of mind.", "Date": "October 4, 2011"}, {"Title": "Good TV for the money, size, and quality.

Pirates of the Caribbean (one of my oldest DVDs that I still watch) looked better than ever on it. Iron Man 2 looked great on Blu-Ray. Of course it's up to you to have 120hz on or off.

It is a sharp looking, thin, high quality, cheat, just all around great TV. I love every feature included. I don't mind the remote either. I only have 3 gripes, and I'm still figuring out what to do about it.1. I got a dead pixel. It happens to everyone. It's only noticable from about 3-4 feet away at max and only during very black or white scenes. I really really don't mind this. From far away I have to look for it to even see the slightest needle-point-dot and only in all black or all white frames. (Up close it's still only noticeable in all black or white scenes.)2. My second gripe is that I have some clouding. There are some scenes where the backlight is off for blacks, and some where it is on (credit rolls, for example,) and when it's on and the screen is fully black I can see like 5 small cloud spots. Google it. I currently have the all 6 Star Wars on Blu-Ray, still unopened. I have decided that will be my benchmark as to if this is an annoyance or something I will overlook. (Space scenes.)3. The box was opened on the bottom. Almost completely. One whole flap was open and the other was torn and half flapping out. Good thing UPS kept it upside-down. I am going to consider returning it, but I'm not so sure if it would be worth the hassle. If you have any thoughts, please comment. I know not everyone will get a TV like mine. I love amazon. I love this site. But I have to recommend that if you can find it for the same price in a store, don't order it online.EDIT: After telling amazon about my slight backlight splotching and the dead pixel, they offered me either a refund, a swap, or a 20% refund. Since the TV works fine and the problem isn't a dealbreaker (just a slight annoyance during all black scenes,) I took the offer.

Navigating the menus works just fine, but all of the additional applications advertised (live support, games, etc.) seem like they were designed from scratch for a television rather than using software designs that are closer to something you might see on the net.  The result is a slow and clunky interface that feels like something out of the 1990s.  The Netflix app works fine, but can only access your existing instant queue.  So there's no browsing of new titles unless you've already added them to your queue on a computer.  I really wish they would fix these issues in a software rollout, but patches are few and far between.The last complaint isn't specific to this model.  The one I bought has no standard RCA inputs in this television, just an all-in-one 1/4\" (or maybe 1/8\" jack) so if I want to hook up legacy equipment like a VCR, I need an adapter cable.  It looks like this model has RCA jacks though so don't worry about that.Still, I paid more for my 46\" and feel that it was worth the cost so there you go.", "Date": "August 21, 2011"}, {"Title": "Perfect.

Based on her observations and previous experience she suggested we go with a Sharp. I had been considering an LG product but our decision was based also on the reputation of Sharp as an industry pioneer in video display manufacturing. When we recently returned to Hawaii we faced the problem of where to make a retail purchase economically. My neighbor has several Sony Bravia KDL's and said that his purchasing decision was based on recommendations of the guy at Costco who recommended either Sharp or Sony. It came down to price for him, but I watched this LC40LE830U and grabbed it when it went on Today's Deals here on Amazon with Free Shipping. Regardless of purchase price, we really are happy we bought the Sharp Quattron. Yes, the display is excellent, but we keep finding more and more features that keep us happy that we made this choice. Other reviews here are of a more technical nature, but I'm just recommending this television as an average user with average knowledge of the specifics, and relying on actual hands-on user experience after five months of ownership.

Especially because of all the \"Smart\" features that the TV has to offer. Such as Nexflix, you just push one button & your in the system to choose what ever movie you would like to watch. The GREAT REVIEWS that you may read on this TV are REALLY True!! THIS TV is by far a 5 Star hdtv, I presently don't have an HD Cable box I still have to switch the analog box over to the latest version so the picture will look like HD however you would never know it because my picture certainly looks HD I can't imagine how much better the picture is going to look because it looks fantastic now.  I have a Samsung 52\" LCD HD TV,It also has a great picture but comparing to the 40'Sharp there's very little difference that I can see but of course I still need the HD Cable box to really see the difference. So if you decide to purchase this TV you will not be sorry you did!!Also, I know that some people complained about the remote not lighting up but I too would like it to be lit up because I'm blind without my glasses, however the buttons on the remote are arranged that you can easily remember where to push each function for what ever button you decide to use.", "Date": "October 19, 2011"}, {"Title": "Great Picture", "Author": "JCFAN22", "ReviewID": "R1JM64H4CU2B17", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I Love this TV!

It's a fantastic hdtv with amazing image quality, and I'm totally thrilled about it.  The super-saturated colors really pop and the clarity is crisp (you ought to have an HD cable/satellite connection and a blu-ray player to get the optimal effect, but I'm sure you knew that!).  Not sure if the extra yellow pixel is all Sharp makes it out to be, but I don't think it's hurting!I like that the LED technology means low energy usage, and I do think it improves the picture quality and brightness over standard LCD sets, as well as providing deep blacks, as well as shaving down the weight of the tv and its thinness.  I'm a petite chick about 100 lbs. and had no trouble picking it up and moving it around- so light!  Made it much easier when I installed it on a wall-mount.  An unexpected bonus is the matte screen- no annoying mirror-like reflections like other sets with glossy screens.Setting up the tv and connecting to the internet was quick and easy; learning all the Menu options and settings (for customizing your preferences) can take a while to read and understand.  The remote buttons and on-screen controlling are very responsive, but I agree with another reviewer that the Menu button is too close to the navigation buttons; I often press it accidentally.  The Menu options are extensive and give you a high degree of control and adjustability for picture, audio, and other settings.  I highly recommend Smart tv's over 'dumb' ones.  The Apps are fairly decent in selection.  No opinion on streaming Netflix or movies as I don't use those features.  I also specifically bought this set because it has built-in Wi-Fi; why would you want to buy a separate adapter?
