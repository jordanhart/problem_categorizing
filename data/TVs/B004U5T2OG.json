{"Reviews": [{"Title": "First Class 3D TV", "Author": "Bob Drake \"BobDrake\"", "ReviewID": "R328EU8PSOG4BI", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "The impressive thing about the Vizio E3D320VX is the way it is packed and the attention to detail. They give you a full sized Phillips screw driver to install the base, and eight stainless bolts when you need only six. The remote batteries are Mitsubishi alkaline, not some cheap \"heavy duty\" items. Both the panel and the glasses come with Vizio supplied cleaning cloths.The TV is easy to set up, and the remote has a rubberized alphanumeric keyboard on the back side, making data entry easy. The two supplied 3D glasses are of the passive, polarized variety, with the premium one contoured and the basic one flat. (However you might want to liberate a pair of Real D 3D glasses from the movie theater if you wear glasses. Both of these bend in at the temples to hug your face. The Real D 3D glasses accommodate glasses better.)The 3D and 2D pictures are both great as is the TV off-air picture using a Terk HD digital antenna here in the NYC area. The 3D (using a Panasonic 3D player) is bright and truly 3D. (The TV indicates with a dialog box that it has detected a 3D source and asks if you want to switch to 3D.)It has a built-in wireless Wi-Fi receiver (not an expensive extra like my Panasonic plasma) and is easy to connect using the alphanumeric keyboard on the remote.I am still exploring the various extras. But things look good so far!ADDED 5/21/11:A recent Samsung ad tells the difference between the active 3D TVs that they sell (both LCD and plasma) versus passive 3D TVs like this Vizio (and some LG models). Yes, they are correct that there is a minor \"venetian blind effect\" (light horizontal bars), particularly on white block text, but it is not really visible when you are watching a movie. (In truth, each eye is seeing a 1920x540 image simultaneously on a passive TV whereas each eye sees a 1920x1080 image with active glasses (in succession, one eye at a time, as the L and R lenses switch on and off).) But, with the convenience and cost of passive glasses (\"free\" at the movies), and the cost of the Vizio TV itself, the Vizio passive \"Theater 3D\" is very, VERY nice if not absolutely perfect.ADDED 5/30/11:I've watched Avatar 3D, How to Train Your Dragon 3D, and Megamind 3D on the Vizio and enjoyed every minute.This Vizio TV has RCA audio out whereas many panel TVs do not. (They have only optical audio out.) I output the sound to a pair of Audioengine 2 - PC multimedia speakers - 30 Watt (total) - 2-way - satin black and an Audioengine AS8 - Subwoofer - 125 Watt - black in the bedroom without a receiver, so the RCA-out audio is a necessity.Reflecting on the CONS in another review: (1) Yes, the boot-up is slow for a solid-state device, but may have to do with the fluorescent lighting panel behind the screen rather than the LCD screen itself. (2) I do not get any buzzing at all. (3) The compact remote is a plus to me. The small buttons are no problem if you are used to the keyboard on an iphone. The rubberized alpha-numeric keyboard on the back is a plus as are the direct-connect Netflix labeled button (and others) on the front of the remote.Keep in mind this is a $500 3D set.ADDED 8/13/11:[SEE NOTE BELOW] This passive 3D TV does not seem to work in conversion mode with the newer players that convert 2D -> 3D, specifically the Panasonic 310.  The 2D and 3D images are perfect, but the 2D->3D conversion results in a flickering image that is 3D but hard on the eyes. The same 310 works well in conversion mode on my 600Hz Panasonic plasma. Perhaps the problem is that the 32\" Vizio is 60Hz. In any case there is an apparent incompatibility problem. If I learn how to prevent the flickering I will report back.ADDED 9/24/11:In Comments, C. Anderson explained how to get this set to work in 2D->3D conversion and it works. His procedure: Turn on your Blu ray player and navigate to setup, next go to player settings, then push TV/Device Connection. Go to 3D settings and then go to 3D type, click this and change it to Side by Side. [I got a warning saying that the set is capable of Full HD, which is true, but not in 2D->3D conversion.] Once you have changed it to Side by Side, the problem is fixed. Now insert a non-3D movie you want to watch in 3D, and push the 3D button on the player remote to select 2D->3D. Your TV will sense 3D content and ask you if you want to watch 3D or 2D. You will only have a few seconds to push Yes, so be ready with the Vizio remote or it will revert to 2D.Note that there have been reports that Vizio will not act on defective sets after the 1 year warranty is up. PERIOD. They will not repair sets AT ALL. While in warranty they will replace sets with refurbished units. So buy a Square Trade warranty of your choice of length FROM AMAZON within 90 days of placing your order (not delivery). Square Trade will not sell warranties from their Website for units bought at certain stores like Amazon, Best Buy, and a few others.ADDED 5/26/12:Still going strong. Zero problems. Remote repelled some liquid with no ill effects.ADDED 7/24/12:Still going strong. Zero problems.ADDED 5/20/13:Still going strong. Zero problems.

Ali", "ReviewID": "RI1CA2RY3R2LN", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I had been researching 3D TVs for over a year before I bought this TV. Plasma had my vote as lack of deep black levels were something that were very noticeable for me on my last two televisions. I had been interested in Panasonic GT25 series for a while but the cost of active shutter glasses and up-keep (battery, wear and tear etc.) was prohibitive (this being a 2nd TV in the bedroom).The first I had heard about FPR passive glasses based devices was about a year ago. They were said to be the next best thing but being a geek who has been burned before I was initially skeptical that the 3D effect would be very good. I was certain there will be sacrifices in image quality for 2D however I was actually very surprised by the image quality (both 2D and 3D) on this television. The device simply can not be beat in terms of image quality and features at this low price (Similarly capable LG TVs (albeit with 240 Hz and some extra bells and whistles) cost more than twice as much).I have had an HDTV (this being my 3rd) for the past 5 years and this TV has the best image quality and features and costs the least.PROS:- Even though this is an LCD panel the blacks levels are actually pretty good.- PS3 and XBOX360 on HDMI look fantastic and there are several modes available to tweak color temp and/or brightness hue contrast levels.- 3D effect looks amazing with both games and movies. I have had the TV for only a day so I have not had a chance to watch a full length 3D movie yet. 3D games I tried include wipeout HD which looks amazing. I had tried this game previously on a 3D Sony TV before and this one looks just as good while costing one 3rd.- Lots of options are available for different settings e.g. Zoom  has 4 settings (normal, wide, zoom, panoramic)- Internet apps are available for flickr, facebook, NEtflix, VUDU, Amazon video on demand, Blockbuster and lots of  news station. Not needing to power up my PS3 (for netflix) or my PC (for amazon video on demand) mean power savings :).- Qwerty keyboard on the remote makes using these internet apps a breeze.- The TV has wifi n and ethernet both which makes it very flexible. It has 3 HDMI ports and 1 component and 1 VGA port.- It has capability to play songs and display pictures a usb disk (has 2-3 usb ports, I tried connecting my western digital passport and it worked great)but no movies. Pictures app has a lot of different transitions that make the slideshow and normal photo viewing great.- The passive glasses are much lighter and more comfortable than active shutter glasses I had tried before. I wear glasses so I have to wear these on top of my existing ones and they have been much easier to handle than other glasses. I believe one can get clip-on type attachments (generic variety not from Vizio) for prescription glasses as well.CONS:- None that I can think of. The TV has surpassed my expectations for its price. To nitpick it is not 240HZ, or LED backlit, does not support PIP or POP. There are less options available compared to TVs that cost more than twice as much.- After a couple of weeks of use I can definitely say that the TV is a little slow to start compared to my older HDTV, granted this one has internet apps (implying an embedded processor with an OS that needs to boot) but it is a noticeable difference. Since, this feature was not something I could test with other floor models, this could just be the norm for internet enabled TVs.UPDATE APRIL 16th 2011:- Confirmed that movie playback from usb disks is not supported as mentioned in the manual.- I had a chance to watch some more 3D content (Tangled 3D, Super stardust HD, mortal Kombat 3D demo, KillZone 3 3D demo) and played around with some internet apps like Vudu and netflix and all looked great. I have not tried the wifi n link as I have it connected via wired ethernet. Vudu has a test festure built-in that tells you what format (SD, 720P, 1080P would be most suitable as they are priced differently. There are not a lot of choices though and the prices are pretty high (4.99 - 6.99 for 720p to 1080p rentals) but they are sometimes better than Sony Playstation Network especially for 3D movies.UPDATE APRIL 25th 2011:- Added more information and my thoughts after a couple of weeks of use.- I also tried IZ3D with every setting but could not get 3D (for PC)to work over HDMI. Maybe it will work over RGB but for my setup HDMI looks and works better so that is not an option I was going to try.- I would also like to add that sound quality is actually decent on this device, depending on the source of the original material sound is clear. I was going to buy a sound bar for this TV (since it is in my bedroom) but i guess i can wait until the next version comes out in July instead of buying last years model.", "Date": "April 15, 2011"}, {"Title": "Best Deal for the Price", "Author": "Andrew Fujii", "ReviewID": "R2NW5ELJMIEU9Q", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "If you're looking for a 3D internet connected TV, then this is the one to buy. This TV is probably the best overall value out there right now. Picture is incredible and sound is adequate. By \"adequate\" I mean that the sound is good enough if this is a TV for your room. If this is a TV is for a family or entertainment room, you may want to buy external speakers just to improve the overall quality of sound.The internet connectivity and available apps is really nice. If you are a Netflix or Hulu+ user, this will be extremely convenient. There is plenty of apps for sports updates too.3D is a really nice touch to the TV. I've tried a few things in 3D and can say that you really will get a solid 3D experience from this TV. However you can't be sitting anywhere you want to. The manual comes with a diagram of \"optimal 3D viewing\". From certain side angles you won't get the 3D viewing.The only major issue I've had with this TV is when using a PS3 to play video games. Ghosting (motion blur) can be an issue as well as awkward pixelations and lag when viewing in 1080p. Vizio support was more than helpful with this. They recommended changing the output settings on my PS3 which ended up fixing the problem for the most part.Overall I highly recommend this TV for anyone who is looking for the most advanced TV tech available, while still being able to afford it.**UPDATE 5/14/11: PS3 Settings to Reduce Ghosting and Eliminate Lag**After playing with a ton of combinations of settings I found the following PS3 settings to work best while gaming in 2D. These settings were based on MLB 11: The Show because that particular game had the worst ghosting issues out of my games. Other games, may not need these settings. The TV settings listed below are absolutely necessary to have. It will eliminate any lag that you might experience.PS3 Settings:--Go to 'Video Settings' and set '1080p 24HzOutput (HDMI)' to OFF.--Go to 'Display Settings' and change 'Video Output Settings' to 720p. To change this setting you have to choose 'Manual' when it prompts you to choose.--The only other setting (which I'm not positive I actually changed or if this setting was default) was in 'Game Settings'. I have 'PS Smoothing' set to OFF.TV Settings:--TV Settings: Hit 'Menu' on your TV Remote and go to 'Settings'. Make sure the 'Input Source' is set to whatever input your PS3 is using. Go to 'Game Mode' and choose 'ON'. This eliminates all lag while gaming which was a huge problem initially.", "Date": "April 18, 2011"}, {"Title": "Think 3D HDTV is a phase, think again!", "Author": "Southernreign \"SR\"", "ReviewID": "R107LYRRB3H1UE", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Vizio 3D HDTV Review.I knocked off one star because of the poor design remote and the mediocre sound of the HDTV.I have been shopping for a 3d HDTV for several years... I am very slow in buying into new technology, but at this price, I could not resist.I was very hesitant to get an active shutter system since the glasses ran around 80 to 130 dollars a piece. Imagine what would happen to those 80 dollar pairs of glasses in the hands of 8 year olds?  I like to have friends over to watch TV for `movie night'/ Knowing 3d movies are being made more-and-more; Having an investment in $800 to $1000 just for glasses was just simply not an option. When I found out passive TV was coming out, I knew I had to check them out as soon as they came out. So, off to Best Buy to see their 3D HDTV Demos.I was impressed! Now, the passive seemed almost as good as the active shutter. But knowing I could get 40 pairs of paasive glasses for the price of one active- I was sold! Remember, the passive TVs use the exact same glasses you get FREE at a RealD 3D Movie Theatre!Now, some people that get motion sickness may have problem with watching 3d movies. This set allows you to turn off the 3d too. It also tells you if a movie is encoded with 3D before playing it in 3D and asked you if you want to watch it in 3D or 2d!I would suggest buying two pairs of 3d to 2d glasses so a couple of guests who want to watch your 3d movie in 2d can and those that want to watch in 3D can use their 3D glasses. The 3d to 2d glasses cost about $9 each. I bought two pairs.PICTURE: The depth of colors and details of pixels are VERY nice. Brightness and Contrast of the HDTV is amazing with just standard TV broadcast, HD is even better. I actually had to turn the brightness down because it was TOO bright for my normal night time viewings. There are so many picture settings you can tweak from the Picture Menu that EVERYONE can find the perfect setting for their liking if they are willing to take the time to tweak them. The response time with fast action is very good, very little blurring, and 99% of people would not even notice. There is a lot of talk between 60hz, 120HZ, 240HZ and 480 Hz and the New 720 HZ. Most movies and HDTV broadcast are at 24HZ... so any set over that for normal cable broadcast will be overkill. Blu-rays runs at 59.94Hz at best/normally at 30hz....all game consoles Xbox360, PS3, Wii run at 30hZ and are up-converted sometimes to 60hz. 120Hz is way good enough for 99% of the people out there. Make sure you have quality HDMI cables between your HDTV cable converter and your Blu-Ray player. The set has 3 HDMI input jacks in the back and one HDMI on the side.SOUND: The Sound is honestly worse than I expected. I have read other reviewers about the poor sound, but did not expect it to be as weak as it was. It is fine for normal news viewing, or children shows, but if you are into Action Movies... you should expect to add a good sound system to this TV, or a Sound Bar at the very least! Believe me, when I say, the sound is tinny at best! I added a Bose sound system... it really adds 50% to viewing pleasure with great deep base sounds and crisp highs! Note, even the highs are weak with this TV not just the bass. If you watch nothing but news... you'll be happy. But, if you watch Tron in 3d with the TV's sound system.... You'll be disappointed not because of the Picture, but because of the sound. Note, this set DOES have one single Optical out jack, so plugging this into a sound system is a snap! I have an optical 7.1 stereo headset I use when playing FPS on my PS3. Having this optical out is another plus for the TV.3D: The 3d TV makes you feel like you are watching something happen live from a window, not that the picture comes out of the TV but that the TV has Real live Depth to it. It still makes you feel immersed in the movie.Games: I have a PS3 and a Wii, so I can only speak about them.  The Wii, a brighter bigger better contrast TV will make the Wii look good. Now, The PS3, W-O-W, Playing Black Ops in 3D or MotorStorm in 3D is simple a \"WOW\" experience one must see-to-believe! I am a big Battlefield 3 player, so having a bigger set will make you a better player. I went from a 32 inch set to this 47\". So, this makes a vast improvement in enemy locating.Mounting: I have this set mounted above my gas fireplace; it is on a adjustable wall mount which I pull out from the wall a foot and normally have angled down at a 15 degree angle. Watching 3d movies is not a problem until you get over 45 degrees from center. 2d shows are fine.We have a maximum viewing distant from the TV at 11 feet. I would not recommend sitting closer than 5.5 feet away. I think the sweet spot is around 6-11.5 feet away.Applications: Can get access to Yahoo, Facebook, Twitter, Rhapsody, Weather Channle, News, and several others. Not great app program, and I can not figure out how to update firmware.Netflix: I have this TV connected via the wireless portion included on the set. I did not test the direct hardwire connection. The wireless works VERY well. It rarely stops to buffer movies. I have an extremely fast internet connection that gives me 45Mbps direct connected and 16Mbps via my wireless connections. The TV works very well.Amazon Prime: Same as Netflix... works very well.Remote: Its okay, could be ALOT BETTER... the buttons have to be pressed EXTREMELY hard to MAKE work. The worse thing about this TV is the remote!Overall: Well worth the money! Just Note...that you probably will need to buy a sound bar or a cheap surround-sound home theatre system to REALLY enjoy action movies.", "Date": "August 3, 2011"}, {"Title": "Crystal clear 3d at an exceptional value", "Author": "Hailey", "ReviewID": "R1GSFESUR56T0O", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I was impressed with how well this TV produced flawless 3D effects without any ghosting at all. 3D Blu-ray movies appear brighter and even more rich in color through the polarized glasses.  As opposed to some of the active shutter glasses I have tried out, the lightweight polarized glasses are less strenous on both the eyes and the nose they rest on. The TV also works well with the PS3 and generates an immersive 3d gaming enviroment. While I was easily able to link my computer to it through the hdmi port to play my downloaded 3d content, I was a little dissapointed that I could not access 3d controls while trying it on the RGB port. I also could not find a way to make it work with nvidia's 3d vision.  However, I am hopeful that Nvidia will provide support for this TV in a future driver release. The TV can normally autodetect 3D content but when it doesn't you can push the 3D button on the remote for easy access to the SBS, TB, or Sensio 3d settings. The wireless setup was very quick and easy and involved no more then picking out my network and typing in my password.  I also really like the one touch buttons for VOD, Netflix, And Vudu.  The full QWERTY keyboard on the reverse side of the remote allows for painless browsing of online movies and TV shows.  In conclusion, for the features, screen size, quality and price of this TV set, it's a fantastic bargain and I fully endorse it.IMPORTANT NOTE --  When using the TV for gaming, make sure film mode is off or you will experience massive input lag.Update: after a bit of tinkering I have found that the TV works flawlessly with IZ3D drivers on the interleaved setting, you don't even have to put the tv in 3d mode for it to work and it produces some truly amazing pc 3d gaming immersion. Don't even bother with nvidia 3d vision its a dead end on this tv, the IZ3D software works with both ati and nvidia cards.Update 2: This TV is now listed on the Nvidia 3dtv play site as supported through the Beta 285.38 drivers. I bought the $40 program but the tv does not seem to detect the 3d signal from my nvidia gtx 285 card. I have both posted on the nvidia forums and sent a support email. I shall update again with the results.Update 3: I gave up on Nvidia for my setup, it may very well be an issue with my particular gpu, I was able to get a refund on the program and I have since switched to an amd card with a built in sound card and actual hdmi output. it works just fine with IZ3d and runing the hdmi from my computer straight into my receiver is a big plus.", "Date": "April 4, 2011"}, {"Title": "Fantastic Deal On A 3D TV!", "Author": "C. Ramos", "ReviewID": "R2U6COVSA3KMQT", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Earlier I gave this TV a negative review for 2 reasons:1. 3D would not work with my Playstation 3 and Killzone 3.2. Games had noticeable lag during gameplay.After some tinkering around, I resolved both problems.The problem I had with 3D is that since this TV is fairly new it REQUIRES 1.4 HDMI cables to enable 3D content to work. So if you plan to use it with an older HDMI cord, think twice. Online forums may tell you otherwise, but take it from someone who's experienced severe frustration from the issue, YOU NEED 1.4 HDMI CABLES FOR 3D.The problem with gaming lag is because of the default settings on the TV. You have to go into settings and enable \"gaming mode\". Until you change this setting on the TV, CoD and other fast paced action games are virtually unplayable due to input lag.After those problems are dealt with then it's smooth sailing for gamers and movie enthusiasts alike. It's a great value for a TV with these features and it really does perform. Only other gripe is that the main speakers are very underwhelming. Which is only a problem if you don't have a speaker system.As of right now this TV is not available on Amazon, so I'd advise anyone looking to purchase it to go to their nearest Walmart and pick it up. You can't go wrong with a deal this good!-UPDATE 05/14/11:Did some more research and found out that game systems can output 3D with 1.3 HDMI cables since they were created before the induction of the 1.4 standard. 3D Blu-Ray Players on the other hand have emerged much more recently and therefore are only compliant with the 1.4 standard. Hope this helps.", "Date": "May 3, 2011"}, {"Title": "Non-expert review (just being honest with you!)", "Author": "Nathan L. Baker", "ReviewID": "R26L3ZRNIZW911", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I have to tell you that I'm not an audio/visual expert. I wear glasses (if that makes any difference) and am prone to headaches (which is relevant to 3D material).So far I only have 3 3D Blu Ray movies (Tangled, Tron Legacy, and Piranha) and have only rented one other (Bolt) so my expertise on this TV is fairly limited. With that said, I've over-all been extremely pleased with the 3D output of this TV. Keep in mind, this TV doesn't require active-shutter glasses (and I'm not even sure if those kinds of glasses will even work with it). It uses basically the same glasses that you get from seeing a movie in \"Real-D\" at the theater--hence the name of this \"Theater 3D\" TV. In fact, I saved a couple pairs of the 3D glasses I got from seeing 3D movies in the theater and they work with this TV as well--which is nice, because I can have friends over to watch the 3D movies without having to shell out a ton of cash just for the glasses.Be warned though, the 3D experience won't necessarily always be good--that depends on the source material, not on the TV itself. For instance, the 3D of Piranha, and the 3D from Time Warner On Demand, made me feel kind of woozy. Time Warner uses (at least on the free 3D shows it has available, that I've watched) the top/bottom 3D approach and that makes me feel horrible. Hopefully that gets phased out and only the side/side approach gets used. Piranha looked decent at times but I'm afraid it uses the t/b approach and it made me feel crummy too.Still, with the right source material--like Tangled and Tron Legacy, as well as Bolt and I'm sure many others--the 3D can and does look stunning. It may not be \"Full HD\" (based on other reviews I've read) but I can't really tell. Sitting 8 feet back, the 3D looks like Full HD to me and the 3D looks awesome. In fact, my dad--who hates seeing 3D movies because it always makes him feel sick, and who says 3D looks poor anyway--was actually very into Tangled 3D at home. He said, with a bit of surprise and even a little smile, \"it actually looks a lot better than in the theater.\"The video quality... I shouldn't really have to say it, but it's great. One of the first things I watched when I got this thing home last weekend was an NBA game and it was SO much better on this TV than my previous (a 32\" Samsung 720p). I nearly felt like I was at the court. It could be clearer, and I still noticed some \"blocks\" (don't  know the technical terms) when there was a lot of fast action, but those moments were few and far between. I only noticed them when I got up close and wanted to see them. Sitting back, you couldn't tell.Besides the 3D, there are other things that make this TV well worth it. First is the Vizio Internet Apps aka VIA. I love having Netflix, Hulu and Amazon VOD right on my TV, without having to switch to another component. You have the VIA button--as well as Netflix, Vudu and Amazon VOD buttons--right on the double-sided remote control. Besides those video services, you can also download Vizio apps such as NBA Game Time (which hopefully, next year, will have League Pass), Showtime, weather, eBay, Facebook, Pandora, a lot of different local news apps, games, Twitter, etc. They all seem to work well, although the Netflix app would be better off if updated (to resemble the current PS3 Netflix app).Second is the remote control which, although not perfect by a long shot, is really cool. For one it's fairly small and thus easy to use. One major plus is, as I mentioned before, the back side which sports a QWERTY keyboard. Unfortunately (maybe) the buttons are not extremely easy to use. I expect the typical buttons to require a bit of force--to prevent hitting buttons that you didn't mean to--but the whole point of a QWERTY is to be able to type faster. Well, the fact that you have to really push the buttons slows you down. Of course the problem here is that if they were easier to push, you'd be pushing them all the time while gripping the remote. Maybe Vizio could redo the remote to have a slide or flip cover for the back?Anyhow, I love the TV and have no regrets buying it. The only problem I have is not having under-$100 access to some of the more popular 3D movies.

Rocke", "ReviewID": "R1JTA98AU2AEI8", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I've had this TV for almost 2 weeks and I am very pleased with it. Keep in mind I rated this TV based on value not on picture quality.  The 3d picture is stunning and works very well, the passive display does mean it cuts down the resolution while in 3d mode, but given it's flicker free and very inexpensive that's not a big deal breaker. The glasses are lightweight, battery-less, and inexpensive.  Those wanting to buy must understand that this is and economy TV, meaning that its primary focus is value for your buck, It won't rival the picture quality of the new 1,000,000:1 contrast ratio led TVs.  Being under $700 puts it at a price that with its specifications and features rival similar 2d CCFL LCD TVs. It does lack 2d to 3d like sets that cost at least twice as much. Overall I think this is a tremendous value, especially for those buying a TV anyway, you get a good 2d TV with the option of using 3d.Pros:-Under $700!-3d is great, no flickering or having expensive glasses to charge or break, you can use Real-D glasses you get free at the movies.-Great with ps3 for playing 3d blu-ray movies, 3d MPO picture viewing(works with 3ds pictures), and gaming(3d adds a lot more to gaming than it does movies).-Wifi and apps- Surprised Vizio include both wifi and apps at this price. Pandora, Netflix, Amazon Video, and much more are available.-Full function remote-  Not only has tv functions and a qwerty keyboard, but also supports CEC for controlling hdmi devices(ps3 control works great for bluray playback and menu navigation).-Ample amount of settings to change- Changing the picture to your liking is easy, also has a game setting to ensure you get lag free play when gaming.Cons:-3d up and down viewing angle is limited and slight cross talk when a very bright color overlaps a a very dark background.-3d resolution is cut in half.  In order to work with the lightweight polarized glasses every other horizontal line of pixels is polarized differently.  This means in 3d mode each eye gets a 1920 x 540 resolution image, when displaying full HD 3d most won't be able to tell much of a difference.  This is also not a big deal for this reason, 3d Blurays are the only content I know of that output full 1080p 3d at this time.  The PS3, due to processing limitations, cuts games down to 720p when in 3d, current internet and cable streaming send half of full 3d by squeezing 2 images into one 2d hd stream.-Lacks backlight uniformity of leds/plasma, Uses CCFLs which causes a slight brightness banding effect that is noticeable on solid and panning backgrounds. I'm not overly picky, but a perfectionist will likely want another set.-No 2d to 3d conversion.-Sound does lack richness and bass of a external system, does fine for my small room but those with a big room may want to invest in a sound system.I gave it a 5 out of 5 not because it produces a perfect picture, but because it is a great value and meets all my expectations.  It has the potential to be the best selling 3d TV this year.  Keep in mind while 3d is the main reason people will by this, 3d is just an extra feature not a mandate and it is still a good 2d TV to buy in case you want 3d in the future.

What's worse, is that the Alphabetic keypad is placed on the back surface of the remote - so that you are in danger of pressing those keys while trying to push in a button on the top of the remote.  It's difficult for me to use, and near-impossible for Mom.Really bad design.  I called Vizio, and the person I spoke to agreed it's a bad design.  He spoke to his manager, and came back to apologize again, and tell me that I couldn't even purchase a better remote from them because the E model TV frequency doesn't work with their better remotes.  The only option would be to buy a cheap generic Vizio remote that will NOT run any of the features (just basic TV channel switching), and save the bad remote to infrequently run any of the TV's features.He said this remote comes with all E (3D) models.  The other Internet Apps Vizio TVs come with the bigger remote, with the slide-out alphabetic keyboard.  I love that remote.  If the person using this TV has arthritis, etc., I suggest you do not buy any of the models beginning with E.(By the way, the indent in the bottom center of the TV is not a dent - it's part of the design.  He said that I was not the first person to ask.)", "Date": "October 17, 2011"}, {"Title": "Great TV. Fantastic 3D. Phenomenal Value!", "Author": "Kevin", "ReviewID": "RD52ADY1FI5IE", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I purchased this TV after buying a Samsung UN46D6400 LED TV and returning it to Samsung for a refund -- Samsung was great to work with, by the way, and I would buy from them again only because they acted honorably in the spirit of customer satisfaction. That being said, having bought the Samsung for $1,300, I felt somewhat like I'd been \"ripped off.\" Sure, the TV's contrast ratio was through the roof, and the image quality overall was bar none, but I believe the contrast ratio, in addition to the high-gloss coating Samsung applies to its screens, exacerbate any screen uniformity issues, and the unit I had suffered from HORRIBLE clouding and \"flashlighting.\" Furthermore, though it was a 3D-ready TV, it included no glasses (which are pricey), and accessing any internet apps would have required the purchase of an external wifi dongle, an additional $80 or so. In short, I would have had to spend about $1,500 to use the Samsung's 3D and internet features, and I still would have been stuck with a TV marred by poor backlight uniformity.For the Vizio E3D420VX, I spent a total of $668, and while this TV is 42\", versus the Samsung's 46 inches, it includes two pairs of 3D glasses and has 802.11n built in. I set it up, connected my PS3 via HDMI, and breezed through the setup procedure. It picked up my wireless network quickly, and I was immediately able to access Netflix, Hulu Plus, Pandora, and all of the other available online content. My PS3 looks fantastic, but the icing on the cake is the 3D. It's not just $668 good. It's very, very good, period. I've played a few game demos and viewed some of the free 3D content available on PSN, and so far, I'm really impressed with what I've seen (and having been partially responsible for the development of Dell's Alienware AW2310 3D gaming monitor, I know 3D).I'm also very happy with some of the TV's other, less prominent features, such as its RCA analog stereo output, the option to turn-off its power LED (thank you, Vizio, and praise baby Jesus!!!), and its clever QWERTY remote. I have a 2.1 receiver with two bookshelf speakers and a sub, and it's becoming more and more difficult to find a TV with analog stereo outputs. With this Vizio TV, I was able to easily connect my receiver and use the TV's remote to adjust the volume level. When my receiver was connected to the Samsung TV, I had to use the receiver's remote to adjust the volume level, because the Samsung remote's volume control becomes disabled when the TV is configured for \"External Speakers.\" Being able to turn-off the Vizio's power LED, while a minor feature, is a HUGE plus to me; I had an older Vizio TV whose illuminated logo I quickly became annoyed with, so to be able to view content with one less visual distraction makes for a great bonus -- it's really nice to see a company like Vizio being mindful of details like this. And speaking of details, while I've noted complaints about the QWERTY remote, the only thing I can ding if for is not being back-lit; however, at $668, I can't balk. In fact, even in the dark, entering text using the remote's keyboard is far, far more convenient than having to use what is usually a poorly executed on-screen substitute.As for the Vizio's picture quality, it's not perfect, but it's still very, very impressive, especially at its price-point. Contrast is good, clarity is very good, and after calibrating the unit, its color reproduction is, in my opinion, extremely natural and transparent. Overall, I'm thoroughly impressed with its ability to render HD content. It does suffer somewhat from backlight uniformity issues, and it's black levels don't touch those of plasmas or LED TVs, but in comparing it to the Samsung LED TV I had, I have to say that even in dark scenes, this TV is far more satisfying to watch; as mentioned previously, I suspect that the astronomically high contrast levels afforded by LED TVs actually work to exploit any clouding and \"flashlighting\" issues that may be present. In the case of this Vizio CCFL TV, its lower contrast ratio actually makes for a picture that is, overall, far more uniform.As a consumer who feels as though truly solid values are becoming increasingly difficult to come by, I have to say I'm very, very happy with my purchase of this Vizio TV. It's a great HDTV with fantastic 3D at an incredible value. Highly recommended.Update: The TV is still working to my expectations. I have noted that, on occasion, the Vizio Internet Apps will act a little wonky (won't start or exit), requiring a second (or third) press of the respective button on the remote. I've also noted a minor uniformity issue that affects the TV's picture only when the majority of the screen is white or near-white; there are three VERY slightly darkened vertical \"bars\" that run down the center of the screen. They're so faint that I'm fairly certain they've been there the whole time and that I simply hadn't noticed them until recently. They're not bad enough to be considered a deal-breaker, so I'm still very, very happy with my purchase and I would still recommend the product to even my very best friends.", "Date": "August 24, 2011"}, {"Title": "Great bargain", "Author": "Teck Kim Khoo \"Vagus\"", "ReviewID": "R1T8RUCTDMIIJK", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Took a chance on this since the smaller version got great reviews- we're very happy with this so far. This was our first 3D tv so we don't have a basis for comparison, but with the 2 3D channels we get with Directv the effects have been impressive so far. Best of all, works with the cheaper polarized 3D glasses (that you get for free at the theaters).Non-3D HD images are excellent too; very crisp and bright on a nonreflective screen. In fact, better than our 46\" Samsung LCD.Didn't buy this for the Wifi but I was able to connect it to our network (after 4 attempts). Iffy connection- Facebook works OK but isn't as user friendly as using your PC- I don't see us using this function much. Haven't successfully connected to Amazon and Vudu yet for some reason but these aren't really important to us.Sound is satisfactory. Bass is lacking but then again no worse than our other LCDs. I have it hooked up to a stereo system, but even without it the sound will probably suffice for most regular sized rooms.I'm keeping my fingers crossed that the TV will be reliable as I've read of issues with other Vizio products before, but so far, we've been very happy with this purchase.

Lee", "ReviewID": "R3VWLIDG2IMJML", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Let me start by saying that for the money, this model provides a rich feature-set and performs very well.  Finding anything comparable--at this price point--will be difficult.  Perhaps this is why I was willing to suffer through three returns before finally receiving a satisfactory unit.  On each of the first three units I received, there was severe backlight bleed at the lower right hand corner of the screen and sometimes at the upper left hand corner.  (For those unfamiliar with the issue of bleed, you need to view a black screen in a darkened room to best observe it.  Bleed is observed as some parts of the screen being lighter than others, or a cloudy white effect on certain parts of the screen.)  On one set in particular, the bleed covered about 40% of the screen, starting at the lower right corner, filling out in a triangular shape from there.  I also noticed that with each of the first three I tested, applying gentle pressure to the screen (using a microfiber cloth) at the lower right corner would cause the screen to \"snap\" into place, as if it hadn't been seated properly.  Unfortunately, doing this often intensified bleeding and so I haven't dared to touch the screen on the unit I'm using now (I'm a little worried about having to clean it for this reason).On the unit I have now, I can see the faintest bleed around the same area of the screen when the room is sufficiently darkened.  I decided this was good enough since I wasn't sure I'd have any better luck by exchanging again.This, to me, seems like an issue with production.  While it was a hassle getting a unit I was happy with, I feel like it was worth the trouble.  For the money spent, I find that this model has brilliant picture quality with nice 3D and a very nice set of features.  I wanted something with a good 1080p picture, good sound quality, at least 3 HDMI inputs and internet connectivity with apps (particularly Netflix, Amazon, etc.) for under $500.  I couldn't find anything else that delivered at this price point and the 3D is a nice bonus.  There are a few other small issues which I could nit-pick, but other reviews cover things pretty well.  I don't mind the \"boot up\" time (mine takes about 14 seconds).  I find that if I wait for about 30 seconds after turning the set on, the CPU bound features (such as loading NetFlix) are much more responsive; it's a bit like using a PC.  While the sound isn't particularly powerful (I generally listen at about 40/100) it has nice range and delivers very \"full\" sounding audio.On another note, Vizio technical support was very friendly and helpful.  I spoke with two U.S. based technicians (they tell you their location at the start of the call) and they even offered to send someone out to my house to have a look at my set.  Hold onto your Amazon invoice / packing receipt, as they will require to see it if they visit you.Hopefully, this is just a weird production issue that will be sorted out.  With that caveat, I can definitely recommend this set.", "Date": "June 26, 2011"}, {"Title": "What a lot of fun crammed into such a low price!", "Author": "Dustin Farahnak", "ReviewID": "R2QF23D7Z2BL0U", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I was so sure this TV wasn't going to be great.  I was compromising on price and just didn't feel good about it.  I'm a die hard Samsung and Sony fan, and I'm used to getting more because I paid more.But this TV has blown me away.  The image really is sharp and vivid.  The 3D is impressive and immerses you.  It's especially a big deal for the games.  I have this game, Gran Turismo 5, which while imperfect does have very pretty cars and high speed racing in 3D.  When I'm in 3D, in that cockpit of my Ferrari, and I spin off the track, and the 3D display shows a wall rushing towards me, or another car... it's actually pretty scary.

The audio is nothing better than any other TV... but I hooked it up to surround sound and I'm delighted.This is a serious upgrade over my 3 year old LCD TV, but it costs about 1/5th!The apps provide a lot more functionality than you'd expect, too.

At home and extremely affordable for the first time. If you want the 3D theater experience at home, this is it.When you see a 3D Theatrical movie, you're given a pair of 3D passive glasses. If you feel the glasses are comfortable and lightweight (just like sunglasses), then bring a pair home(where allowed), as they work perfectly with the Vizio Theater 3D Passive series of TV (not the active battery 3D glasses Vizio series). This is a brilliant move by Vizio, and others like LG, to entice 3D movie fans to get the same experience at home, and will motivate thousands to consider this easy to use Theater 3D.3D PASSIVE GLASSES (The Real D 3D movie theater Glasses)The Vizio 3D HDTV set delivers excellent 3D at a nice range of angles, and best of all, the Passive 3D glasses sunglasses from any major theater (Real D, Imax 3D, Disney 3D, etc) work perfectly with Vizio's 3D Theater experience, no batteries required and 100% 3D quality/effect matched to the included Vizio Passive 3D glasses. That means you can collect hundreds of theater glasses from the theaters that allow you to take it home (excluding Imax 3D). The advantage to this? Lightweight sunglasses that easily fit over prescription glasses, extremely low cost, easily replaceable, whole family can view it at the cost of one theatrical 3D movie for the family, able to tilt your head left/right and work up close or far away provided you're head is on line with the 3D.3D PASSIVE VS ACTIVE HDTV EXPERIENCE:I've compared the Passive 19 pound Vizio 32\" 3D HDTV directly to Sony's high quality Active 3D HDTV Bravia 46\" (at a friend's house), and can say they both look great. 5' is the suggested viewing distance, but you can have your face directly on the screen and still see the 3D working if you prefer getting that close. Take a measuring tape and you'll see 4 to 5 feet is perfectly comfortable for most people. Right now, I'm 2' away from my 19' computer monitor as I type this to give you perspective that 5' for a 32\" TV is not very far away as some may have imagined. Under 4' you can perceive a very subtle movie screen texture that doesn't detract from the 3D effect. Remember, this 32\" Passive 1080 3D image has smaller TV pixels than say a 50\" LG Passive 3DHDTV dislayed at Best Buy. Even better, the Vizio Passive 3D offers a much brighter picture experience to the point the tinted shades are barely noticeable. Only downside is your head should be about centered to the center of the screen at any distance 4' and farther, to get the best 3D effect with the least amount of ghosting; or depending on the movie's 3D, no ghosting at all. (ghosting is the subtle image not completely hidden by the opposite eye's lens. This also happens with Active 3D).3D Features: If you take home 3D pictures or 3D Video set to Side by Side, Top over Bottom, then you can easily view them in 3D thanks to Vizio's Side by Side, Top over Bottom viewing options. The 3D offers the full depth that the film or photo was taken in. Only downside, is I still haven't found an option to adjust the Level of the 3D effect as with Sony Bravia's 3D, so if you have a very close object in view, best to view it at 5' away so your eyes can focus easier on it. Really not an issue.TV Interface: The controller seems to be the only way to easily control all the features, so don't break it. Thankfully, it's sturdy, and the rubber buttons respond well to every input. Batteries included.TV Packaging: Comes in a sturdy cardboard box, includes TV Stand 1 pound, TV 19 pounds, 2 pairs of 3D Passive Glasses (just like the ones from theaters, you can use your 3D theater glasses too and get the same exact effect). Includes a screw driver, screws, instruction manuals, removable power plug, etc.TV Construction Quality: This is a professionally designed TV, made of sturdy material, and well put together. It's also 3\" thin from the side, and only 19 lbs.TV Performance: I counted 18 seconds for an image to appear after pressing power. A bit slow, but powering up a PS3 game or PS3 Blu Ray takes a lot longer by comparison. The performance is flawless on this end. No issues, period. Also draws $13 of energy per year, if 5 hours viewing a day _Energy Guide.PS3 Performance: Looks great with 3D games and 2D games provided you've made the right settings on your PS3. 3D Blu rays looks great including Resident Evil Afterlife 3D, Imax 3D movies, Alice in Wonderland 3D, etc...)TV OPTIONS: Good selection of options and adjustments.Sound Quality: This includes Surround Sound, thanks to multiple speakers on the 32\". Sound is solid and well done, with nice bass and treble. Still searching for the option to fine tune the bass/treble however. Also includes internet ready connections. Plenty of ports for HDMI cords (regular HDMI works with 3D here), USB for USB ports and flash drives, etc...So is (lightweight passive glasses) Theater 3D TV the way to go? Absolutely. If you enjoy the 3D experience at the movie theater, bring home a pair of RealD 3D Glasses to watch on your new Vizio Theater 3D. The tide has finally turned thanks to Vizio's 32\" affordable 3DHDTV.

The first was a samsung 40' from 2006. The hd quality has improved tremendously since then. I mean deep color, black, faster refresh rate... it is really something to watch. The tv (I got e3d470vx, the 47' version) performs less impressively on white and light blue. However this takes nothing away from the overall picture quality. You can watch this tv in a bright room without a problem except at an extreme angle where hues are reflected on the screen.3D: is just phenomenal. I watched the Directv channels so far and it all looks out of this world. Depth perception on a home tv is just what I wanted. Directv has 3 3d channels that come witn your subscription, one for music and concerts, one for nature and history films and the third is espn3d for live sporting events. They also have a $$ on demand channel with limited 3d movie selection.Sound: Tv speakers are worth 3-4 cents collectively, no kidding. I mean I know vizio wants me to buy a sound system, but at least include speakers that actually convey SOME sound. I had to go out and buy vizio sound bar vsb200. It is really a good solution for under $100.Remote: it is odd looking, but surprisingly easy to use. The keyboard on the back is easier to use and more straightforward than any smartphone keyboard I had ever used. I made just one mistake typing multiple times. It is not hard to press buttons like some suggested.Internet apps: vary in quality by purveyor. Netflix & vudu are just great, while Facebook and twitter apps are hard to navigate. The apps are designed by yahoo seemingly as an afterthought. They lose connection constantly, they can't seem to take any advantage of the 47' landscape... A mess really. Yahoo includes all its usual apps: news, sports, weather... Apps by 3rd parties are mostly useless local news channels apps! Note: you can only have a total of 17 apps on your tv at any one time.TV settings: they are quite a bit simplified compared to my previous tv. I kept everything on factory settings so far and picture looks great. I plan to calibrate later but I have explored every setting there is and I found no gibberish. It is all understandable.Setup costs: I needed new hdmi cables for the 3d part. I got mediabridge brand from amazon. They cost $9 each. You should know hdmi terminology changed. It used to be 1.3b or 1.4. This has all been dropped. What you need to run 3d is a \"category 2 certified\" cable. Mediabridge has a fabulous track record and this time was no different. I also needed a digital audio spdif cable to hook tv to soundbar. I got one from bestbyy and they ripped me off. A 6'' cable for 18 bucks. You can get the same one on amazon for 6. And of course I had to buy the sound bar for 98 bucks. Overall for the 47' version you end up with $1100.Note: for first time 3Ders, you have to watch the tv at a straight angle; Straight plane from your eyes to tv. This means that if you have multiple people over, they ALL have to squeeze on a coach facing tv directly.

Matot \"GMS\"", "ReviewID": "R2R94LT6SX7GN3", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I have had this TV for a month now, also purchased a Vizio 3D Blu-ray DVD player.Prior to purchasing this TV I also got an Aiptek 3D digital camcorder/camera (which has 3D HDMI output), so for a month now I have used the three components together. I have also purchased 5 3D bluray discs, all of which I think are wonderful and very lifelike. This tv also displays the 3D picture mode called SBS or side by side just fine.At work we have several plasma monitors on the wall for displaying status in our department, etc. They crank out a ton of heat and up close the picture looks horrible, and they burn-in images from the computers they are connected to. So I have been a fan of LCD since they arrived years ago and would never buy a plasma set.This TV uses passive 3D by placing a mask over the display to put different polarization on different horizontal lines in the display. If you shine a flashlight at the TV when it's off the reflection makes a 4-pointed rainbow presumably from the mask. This set uses the same 3D glasses as in the theater for most films (Real) and it comes with 2 pairs. I noticed the ones that come with the TV are not as darkening as the movie theater glasses I kept from Cloudy ... Meatballs. I cannot detect any difference between the 3D picture on this set and my much larger 2D Samsung LCD set that is about a half year old. I will say that the few 3D DVDs I have seen so far I would describe the images as stunning and extremely lifelike. The difference between passive and active shutter 3D sets must be slight because the \"problem\" the active sets have is so tiny you really have to be on guard watching for it most of the time.The viewing angle for 3D is somewhat limited. You must be at or below screen level. The closer you are to the TV the smaller the viewing space. It kind of projects a 3D image in a cone that gets larger with distance, but at a 32 (aprox) inch size cannot be too far away from the viewer. I use it at about eight feet away from my eyes and it covers the entire sofa and beyond, so theoretically I could have 4-5 viewers at a time.This TV must manually be put into 3D mode when there is 3D content present at the HDMI port. It is continually scanning the input to make sure it is still 3D or it will jump back into 2D mode on it's own.  And it only accepts 3D input from the 3 HDMI ports, not from any other input, like the tuner, wifi, or composite video inputs. This TV will detect one of the three types of 3D signals and briefly put a dialog box on the screen to put the tv into 3D mode, which you must act by pushing a remote button within a few seconds or it goes back to 2D mode. And the player putting the 3D content into an HDMI port must be recognized by the TV as an actual 3D source. So even with 3D SBS content downloaded from online the TV will not allow you to access the 3D menu unless the player is also electronically capable of handshaking with the TV and passing the 3D data handshake.Pros: for the money, it's about the best buy in a 3D TV at this time. Easy to control, I never read the manual. Simple set-up with a standard 95 cent HDMI cable to the 3D Blu-ray player was about all it takes. Wireless wifi for web apps built or more you can download. And the remote has a QWERTY keyboard on the back. Decent sound but no bass to speak of. Has optical output for sound from the HDMI ports and presumably from the tuner or any other input.Cons: the TV is a bit slow to respond to changes from the remote. The TV is constantly watching for a lack of 3D input and is constantly trying to put itself back into 2D mode. It will not switch into 3D mode on it's own, you must push buttons on the remote to manually start that mode. This is important: it will ONLY accept 3D input from the HDMI ports, not from the internet or any other input. 3D input must be from a player device which can handshake with the TV or the 3D mode never enables.Do not get suckered into buying a high priced HDMI cable, especially from Monster Cable, which is a total scam. A regular old cheapie HDMI cable works just fine as long as you dont need a really long cable run.Since the current 3D movie industry is still young you will see scenes in movies that make your eyes feel like the muscles are being pulled. I expect over time they will learn what works and what doesnt and fix this problem. Sometimes movies tend to over-use \"jump out at you\" scenes, which are okay for short bursts but not sustained and repeated use, which you will see today. Hopefully over time it will get better. This TV does depth well but in my eyes/brain the jump off the screen stuff often causes eye muscle discomfort.Follow-up comment Aug 2011:Having used it for months now I am still very pleased with this TV and the 3D effect. Wish I could get Avatar in 3D format. I am up to 10 BR 3D movies now, all are wonderful. Got two more glasses from the theater to use at home, which helps larger numbers of people in the livingroom. My only regret so far is having both a Vizio TV and 3D disc player with nearly identical remotes causes some confusion in a darkened room. My only complaints so far is that the TV will not go into 3D mode automatically when I play a 3D DVD. And it will not allow the TV to be in 3D mode from any device aside from those that tell the TV they are 3D machines. Side by Side 3D images and video from youtube or vimeo would work but the only way to play them would be to burn them to a DVD and play them on the DVD player that can do the 3D data handshake and enable that mode. Maybe a firmware update will enable this to work from TV internet apps like for Vimeo or Youtube. Otherwise it's a great TV. Note: this TV will only allow 3D mode from the HDMI ports.Update: May 2013. Still works fine. The software still drives me crazy, like the warning screens when entering 3D mode!Update: Aug 2012. one year later, still working fine.Update: Dec 2013, still works fine. The way the software tries to protect you from watching 3D content still makes me laugh. They try to treat viewing 3D content being as risky as smoking - it could be dangerous!!! Beware!!!

I tend to be a bit of a butt when it comes to HD quality - that is pretty much the reason I bought a THIRD HDTV, because my Philips was less than desirable.Colors are pretty spot-on right out of the box. I may calibrate the set later, but I am pretty impressed with it so far. Image is sharp (at least it is on 3D content, PC content and Blu-Rays, but its really soft on live TV. Need to play with that one a bit). It is a bit darker than I am used to, but after playing with it for a few minutes, I realized I like it this way.It supports several different 3D formats, making for easy viewing of content off the internet if you connect a PC to it. If you have a 3D source (ie 3d Blu-Ray), it auto senses and asks you if you want to display in 3D. Otherwise, you have to poke through menus.The fact that you are using polorized glasses doesn't seem to affect the resolution at a six-foot viewing distance. In fact, I found the picture to be superior to what I see in theaters.CONSRemote keys feel cheap and gummy, and are not nearly as responsive as I would like. It sometimes takes several presses of a button before the tv registars a key press, even when the remote is directly facing the remote sensor.There seems to be no built-in 2D to 3D conversion. This will probably lead me to watching many of my shows through my PC, as Total Media Theater 5 will do this trick.No S-Video input. This makes me sad, I have an old laserdisc player and an old Super VHS vcr.No cable management system on the back. Would it really have been that hard to add 3 cents worth of plastic.A couple of apps that were on the TV when I turned it on disappeared after recieving an update (notably Blockbuster). Many of the apps are useless. There does not seem to be a YouTube app, which saddens me. YouTube's 3D content would be ideal for this set. If you want YouTube, you will need to connect a PC.Make SURE you are using HDMI 1.4 cables for your 3D devices. The TV starts doing weird things if you are trying to do full 1080p 3D over HDMI 1.3. You can do 3D at 720p, or in SBS (side by side) or Top Bottom mode just fine over older HDMI cablesThere seems to be some issues with certain pieces of software running on this, and I haven't figured out if its a glitch in the TV, the software, or my video card drivers. I have an nVidia GT 430 with the 295 drivers, running on Windows 7 Professional 64-bit. In Total Media Theater, if you setup the display to a polorized display, the 3D works and the TV detects 3D content, but there seems to be weird artifacts (not present in SBS mode). Also, the 3D Vision display is annoying me, because, since I have a long HDMI 1.3 cable running to the TV, it will only do 3D at 1080p/24 or 720p/60. However, no matter how I set the 3D resolution and refresh rate in the drivers, whenever I launch an app, it starts trying to go to an unsupported resolution. Do yourself a favor, and get HDMI 1.4 cables, it will relieve so many headaches.If your content is SBS or TB, you have to manually turn the 3D on and off. This is really annoying when trying to watch short clips off of Youtube. I suggest using a YouTube video grabber, and downloading the videos, and then queuing them up in a video program.The base doesn't swivil! Super annoyingFINAL VERDICT:So far, I am fairly happy with the TV, and the quality of 3D. The apps are fairly annoying, and the unresponsiveness of the remote is going to get annoying REAL fast. But the TV is pretty darn good, so I am going to recommend it.UPDATE: 2-20-2012There is no YouTube app, but you can play YouTube videos, in 3D, with the Web Video app. The Web Video app uses a program called Flingo. First thing you have to do is to figure out how to turn on the Bookmark Bar in your webbrowser on your PC / Mac / Linux box. Most modern webbrowsers have this turned off by default. You may need to Google how to turn it on in your browser of choice.Once you get your Bookmark Bar turned on, you need to go to Flingo.org and drag the Flingo button to your bookmark bar.On the TV, pull you your apps, and go to Web Videos, and open your queue.Go to Youtube, and do a search for something like Music Videos. Once it is up, click on the filter button in the search results, and select 3D.Once you get the results, Click on the Fling button in your bookmark bar. This will open up a new page, and you can do a Fling All. Your TV should start loading, and you can see several videos.DO NOT fling more than one page at a time.On the tv, select a video, and it should start playing. Click the 3D button on the remote and choose 3D and SBS. The TV should flip back and forth between 2D and 3D mode now while you are in the app.NOTE that not ALL videos on Youtube that are labled 3D are actually in 3D, and some videos created were by people who did not know what they were doing. The 3D on probably 70% of the videos I watched were amazing. The others were really screwed up.The second update is to the picture quality. I still have not calibrated this set - I have yet to see a reason to. The image is absolutely beautiful, and the presets meet my needs. The black levels are some of the deepest I have ever seen on a LCD.There is some noise reduction feature that is turned on by default, and I suggest just leaving it on, especially if you get your HD signals from satelite. I have been complaining about how much worse the quality has gotten on HD channels on Dish Network over the past couple of years - my old TV started showing all sorts of compression artifacts. This Vizio pretty much does away with them. So yeah, play with it, you may really like it, and you may find a setting you like better than the default.One of the REALLY nice features is that you can set different picture adjustments for each input. This would be great if I were to use more than one input on the TV, but I don't - everything runs through my reciever. However, I bet that this feature will be a nice addition for many people.UPDATE 4-20-2012There is now a YouTube app for the TV.After breaking in the remote, the buttons seem to handle better, but still not as responsive as I would like.My issues with the PC were all due to the HDMI cable I was using. Make SURE you are running an HDMI 1.4 cable (may be called HDMI High Speed with Audio Return and Ethernet - if it just says High Speed, it may be an HDMI 1.3 cable).", "Date": "February 16, 2012"}, {"Title": "Dont' even think twice!", "Author": "FNKevin", "ReviewID": "R1QFLL2D3A3AJK", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I've been contemplating 3D TV's for some time now. It wasn't really an idea I took seriously until I purchased Nintendo's 3DS and enjoyed the added depth that it provided. Demoing a few active-shutter sets from Sony, Samsung, and Panasonic, I was left with mixed emotions. While viewing some units, I could actually see the lenses flickering, and on two sets I was distracted by a very blue tint added to the picture. Reading about passive 3D made me excited, but many tech sites had reported that passive just didn't quite match up to active... this is not my experience at all. Before finally giving in and purchasing the E3D420VX I viewed a passive set in 3D from LG and was quite impressed. The Vizio was on multiple showroom floors, but never in 3D. This worried me but I took a chance. On to the TV itself...3D:Seeing as I wanted to add 3D to my entertainment (mainly for video games), this was my selling point. When I hooked up a PS3 to the TV and started a game in 3D, I was immediately blown away. I was extremely excited to finally own a 3D TV and knew I would love it, but still expected to be a little let down. However, the 3D on this TV far surpassed my expectations, and actually looked BETTER than 3D that I had recently seen in theaters. 3D was also superior to the active sets I viewed, as well as the passive LG. Images are extremely crisp and the depth that is added seems to make my living room disappear, leaving me immersed in whatever world is on the screen at the time. This effect makes the 42\" TV somehow seem twice as big when viewing in 3D. While the two glasses included with the TV are different (1 premium, 1 basic), there was NO difference in the image between them, just small changes in design. A friend brought over a pair of RealD glasses from the theater and they worked fantastic as well. I prefer the Vizio glasses slightly more because they create a vivid colorful image, and the RealD glasses are a little more plain in color. I honestly CAN NOT speak highly enough of the 3D on this TV and would strongly recommend choosing passive 3D for so many reasons.2D:This TV also has one of the best 2D HD pictures I've seen on a TV. The black levels are extremely deep, and there is no visible ghosting or pixelation when viewing in HD. Since it is a 120Hz TV there is a very smooth image, as has become the case with nicer TVs. Vizio leaves options to disable screen smoothing if that is not your preference (I disabled screen smoothing because it makes things seem like they are slightly in fast forward and give too much of a \"through the window\" effect).Features:The E3D420VX offers a lot at its price point. This is my first experience with apps built into a TV, but I don't really know what more you could want. It has Netflix, Hulu, Vudu, Amazon, Yahoo, Blockbuster, Facebook and more. There are plenty of picture customization options, motion smoothing options, 3D options... really everything a TV should and can have. I've read a few reviews that say the TV takes far too long to start up. This is not an issue for me at all, and don't see where people actually get frustrated about its boot-up. It takes about ten seconds or so for the TV to get going.Hardware:The light weight of the TV was a welcome change to my previous LCD, an earlier model which was almost twice as heavy as the E3D420VX. This was a little extra reassurance that the TV would be just fine hanging on the wall mount that housed its heavier predecessor. I was very happy to find that they had changing their lit-up Vizio logo to a normal branding that doesn't light while the TV is powered up, an aspect of a few Vizio's, including my previous one, that distracted and irritated me while trying to enjoy something on-screen. My only complaint about the construction is that the built-in speakers are not removable, a feature I hoped for since the TV runs through my surround sound. That's only a cosmetic opinion though. I haven't listened to sound through the TV's speakers, so I can't vouch for them. I think the remote is pretty neat, featuring buttons for quick access to Amazon, Netflix, and Vudu. The back of the remote features a full QWERTY keyboard that has already saved a lot of time searching for things to watch online, or even naming inputs (ex: I named HDMI 1 PS3, HDMI 2 Xbox 360, a small feature that made me happy).Overall:All I've wanted to do since purchasing this TV is sit in my living room and enjoy it. I don't understand why it is as cheap as it is compared to other TV's that offer the same features. At $650, this is one of the best and most well enjoyed entertainment additions I can recall. If you're considering it, do it. If you're a little on the fence... still do it!

I cant wait to get the blu ray player and watch blu-ray movies, if its as great or better than my comcast in high def, then im going to be one happy camper!! i suggest if you are afraid of buying a vizio because of the brand name and its generic advertising status then just get over your fear and buy this baby because its just about the best tv iv owned so far! and im a techy guy too!!A++ VIZIO!!! oh and the 3d glasses at the theatre will work with this set, so save them each time you go..vizios included glasses  are slightly better but the galsses from theatres will stil work with this tv!

Why emphasize the control?  Because it is through a remote that you do everything, and its functions are necessary to enjoy the set you will spend or have spent hundreds to purchase.  The provided control is designed for mini-fingers and makes usage unnecessarily difficult.I have three Vizio sets (2009, 2010, 2011) and use the above suggested control for all three.The control I suggest covers all normal TV functions, same as the one which comes with the set, except for access to internet and 3D.  For that you would use the control which comes with the set.  For simply watching TV, accessing the menu, etc., there is no reason to use the mini-control which comes with the set.  Your choice.  Just a suggestion.The provided control is designed for mini-fingers.  Vizio has knocked a full inch off what had been their original control size while adding many additional keys necessary for the more advanced functions incorporated in their sets the last couple of years.I like the fact that they now have one button access to Amazon, Netflix and Vudu.  However, the sizes of the numeric channel selection keys are approx. 3/32\" high and have about 1/8\" vertical separation with maybe 1/16\" horizontal separation - so close that it's very difficult to even measure.  The result is that it's too easy for a single finger to hit multiple keys.I see a lot of people not only praise the remote, but the fact it has an alph-numeric keyboard on the back.  I wonder how much they have actually used that feature.  The keys are also small and the numeric require two keys each, as in ALT + numeric key, both small.  Further, being on the back they're in the way when holding the control by anything but its edges.  I found the on-screen keyboard much easier and faster.  Good idea, but very poor implementation.As for the screen itself, it doesn't seem to be up to par for 2D when compared to my other two Vizios (2009, 20010), both of which are outstanding.  Perhaps it's because somehow the 2D is compromised by it being a 3D set.  I don't assume to know.  I can just compare between my three sets and I've used the menu refinements to do the best I can.These are just my observations.  For those who say everything is \"amazing,\" fine, go for it.

However, unlike the 42\" model with a better tolerance for ghosting/crosstalk, if you move 20 degrees to the side or only 3 degrees above the screen, ghosting becomes so obvious that the 3D effect is almost gone, leaving you with two overlapping images. I tried the 42\" model, which retains the 3D effect much better no matter where you move (of course within a reasonable range).  I cannot figure out why the  42\" model is so much better and the difference between 32\" and 42\" is so big. I don't believe it is because of frequency (32\" has 60Hz and 42\" has 120Hz), as one tester showed no dramatic difference between 60Hz and 120Hz.One other hassle for all Vizio models is the 2D/3D switch on the remote. I hope to click once between 2D and 3DSBS, but Vizio makes you click/move SEVEN (7) times (even using its 3D shortcut button) to switch to the 3D SBS mode, which is the most common mode for me(first click the 3D button, then click twice to move right on a \"3D\" icon, then click it, then move right once again to click \"SBS\", then click a confirmation prompt - 7 clicks in total!!!).  Switching back to 2D is no easier (first click \"3D\" button, then press a button to move right and click \"2D\"; Finished and you are back to 2D? No, it does not end here, you get another menu showing \"2D\", \"SBS\", \"TB\" and \"Sensio\", then you press a button to move right again to \"2D\" again, and then you click it.

Manassah \"Jman\"", "ReviewID": "R1YKC5LG3910R5", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I never heard of Vizio before. My dad told me that Vizio was made by Sony and they are Sony's \"cheap\" brand like Toyota and Lexus. After some research, I found out this was not true at all. Vizio is an independent Chinese corporation. Sony is Japanese. You may also have heard that Vizio is an American company. They do have offices in the United States, but their TVs are made entirely in China. As for this TV, I was going to buy this exact model at Walmart. I went to 2 Walmart stores, but neither one had a 42 inch in stock, only the 32 inch and 47 inch. I then checked at Costco, but they did not have them available in the store either. Both stores had them online for $530, plus tax ($33) and shipping ($35). So, I looked online at Ebay, and the least expensive was $550. Then, I found a brand new one on Amazon sold by electronics101deals for $519, free shipping, no tax and a 1 year extended warranty. So I placed the order and it arrived a week and a half later. I set it up, and everything worked as described. The audio was quiet so I adjusted the sound settings and if you turn off \"SRS true volume\" it sounds louder and much better. Also, if you hook up a computer with an HDMI cable, there is a noticeable lag when you move the mouse, the cursor has almost a half second delay after moving the mouse. This was corrected by putting the TV in \"game mode.\" I tested the 3D with a youtube video of underwater fish on my PC. It looked like the fish were swimming in front of the the TV and the depth is very realistic. In 2D, 1080p video is just as good as the 46 inch Panasonic plasma in my family room. I was a little worried that this TV would not have a good 2D picture because it may have to compromise picture quality due to it being low priced and also 3D. I was surprised that there was no compromise in picture quality. On normal TV and movie viewing, the 120 hz is no different than a TV with 60 hz. In video games, the difference is noticeably better. The apps work great, the TV detected my wifi connection and began downloading the updates. I have my PC hooked up, so I really don't use the apps much, but they all work. I also hooked up an old PC with a VGA cable just to see if it works, and it works great. You have to go to \"RGB\" mode if using a VGA cable. The best part about this TV (besides the 3D) is that it auto adjusts the screen. I remember if the VGA PC is hooked up to a computer monitor, when you change resolution sometimes the screen is all distorted and cut off, but this TV automatically fixes it to fit perfectly centered. On my Panasonic, if a PC is connected all four sides have about 1 inch cut off from the edge and has to be manually corrected by zooming out in the TV picture settings. This is called \"overscan\" and the Vizio corrects it automatically. Also, on my old VGA PC, 1920x1080 (1080p) looks just as good as it does on the HDMI PC I have. The only negative is the remote control's infrared sensor. They put the IR sensor on the top left side, so if you are holding the remote with your left hand sometimes it doesn't work. The layout of the remote and the size of the buttons are just fine. The back keyboard comes in handy if you use the apps a lot. A bluetooth remote would have been 100x better, but since I only use it to turn the TV on and off and the volume, it is adequate. While shopping for TVs, I had it narrowed down to this model and the Vizio 42 inch \"Edge Lit LED\" 3D model (M420NV). After some research, I discovered that an edge lit LED TV has LEDs placed around the frame, while a \"full array\" LED has them behind the screen. According to reviews, the only advantages of an edge lit LED over a CCFL (which this model has) is that the TV can be thinner and may last longer. I went to Costco and compared the picture quality of the 3 different types: cold cathode fluorescent lamp (CCFL; this TV), edge lit LED, and full array LED. I really could not see much of a difference between them. From research, I did find out that the differences are noticeable in a room where sun light is hitting the screen or when there is very little external light. This is where the contrast ratio number is important; the higher the better. According to a few articles on the subject of contrast ratio, any TV with a CR of 5,000:1 or better is good. This TV has a 200,000:1 CR, the edge lit has a 100,000:1 CR and full arrays have anywhere from 1,000,000:1 to 5,000,000:1 while plasmas can go up to 1,000,000:1.  So despite the edge lit being more expensive (about $200 more) the CCFL model is actually better, although it is a bit thicker. If you want a high def, fairly big screen feature packed TV on a budget, this TV should be on your short list. No other 3D TV comes close to this price. And if you do decide on this one, get it from Amazon, it will save you at least $60.", "Date": "October 29, 2012"}, {"Title": "3D value and quality currently unmatched", "Author": "redchord11", "ReviewID": "RLB2IXQ0NZQMY", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I just got this and have been testing it out all morning/afternoon. 2D picture looks incredibly sharp.

I had to shim up the front by almost an inch to keep it from falling off my mantle, or at least looking like it would. It was kind of scary.

It comes with a nice two-sided remote with a QWERTY keypad on the back. While I wouldn't want to do compose long strings of text on it, it does a great job of making it easy to type in passwords and interact with online content. The controls are quite intuitive, and while there's some lag on launching apps, it's perfectly acceptable. The TV does take a few seconds to warm up, so be advised that there will be some lag between hitting the power button and an image appearing.Many inexpensive flat-panels have horrible sound - the E3D470VX has very good sound for the price. Yes, it's not going to be cinema quality, but the frequency response is good and there's very little muddiness on the audio. While I purchased mine with a Vizio soundbar, I'm not sure I necessarily needed it, as the audio quality is more than acceptable.The picture quality isn't as good as some other TVs, but it's more than adequate and stacks up well against other TVs in this price point that offer substantially fewer features. The black levels could be darker, but the colors were rich and vibrant without being overly saturated. This isn't a spectacular TV in terms of image quality, but unless you are a home theater snob that obsesses over details, the quality will be more than adequate.Now, 3D is more or less still a gimmick at this point, but the 3D capability on the E3D470VX works very well. The glasses are passive circularly polarized, so there are no batteries to worry about and no headache-inducing active shutter systems. Instead, you can use the same 3D glasses you use in the theater, which are also available here for a pittance. 3D content is hard to come by - only Vudu and YouTube offer streaming 3D content at the moment, and there's very little of it. But even if you rarely use the 3D capabilities on this TV, it's still well worth the price point.The apps are what really makes this TV special. Do you need to tweet from your TV or check Facebook? No, but it's neat to have the option. But the most important apps are the rich library of streaming services. Hulu Plus? Check. Amazon Instant Streaming? Check. YouTube? Check. Netflix? Check. They are all there - which means that you don't need a separate streaming box unless you're planning on media sharing from your own network. You're not only getting a decent TV, but you're getting a device with instant access to a rich library of content. And getting online was flawless, something that was not always true with other Vizio connected TVs.All in all, the E3D470VX is a fantastic value for the money.

I wasn't expecting the picture to be as crystal-clear, sharp-as-a-tack as it is. The picture is so great that you wouldn't know you are watching a TV instead of a movie in a theater.The on-screen controls are intuitive to use, and very effective.

The estimated yearly cost to operate it is $10 per YEAR. Nice! Of course, that means that it doesn't use up \"phantom electricity,\" so when you turn it on, you do have to wait about 5-10 seconds for the picture.

(Please note that it is not the double-sided one that is shown. The one I received looks like a regular remote; you have to input any letters or numbers using the on-screen menu, but that is not a problem at all, since it all is so intuitive to use.) The buttons on the remote are well laid out and intuitive. Everything is where you would expect it to be. Also, they are raised up enough and textured, which is great; you KNOW when you've pressed a button. The problem is that the buttons on the remote are TINY. I am able to use them without too much of a problem, but my husband has a tougher time. I wound up transferring the controls to one of my favorite gadgets - a Philips SRU4105/27 universal remote that has lovely large buttons, as well as allowing up to 10 \"favorite\" multi-digit channels. (So, for example, if you want to watch channel 41-9 regularly, once you've input it into the remote, you only need to press ONE button. You can do that with up to 10 channels.)So, that's it. Lovely-looking TV that does everything it says it will. Great picture and sound. Easy-to-use on-screen controls and menus, logical remote (but with too-small buttons.) Oh - one other thing - it doesn't swivel either up-and-down or side-to-side, which may be a problem for some rooms.

The 3D in it seems to work perfectly. I play games on PS3 often and find this TV to work great on it. I did have slight lag at first, but after another reviewer said to turn it to 'Game Mode' that resolved the issue completely. The 3D glasses are both very nice. I wear prescription glasses myself and wasn't able to use the 'premium' glasses but the normal ones worked well for me. I personally don't have a huge problem with the firmware. This is my first internet ready tv, so my only issue is that it does seem a bit slow. Not anything horrible and it really isn't a bother. All of the menus seem great so far, and as far as I can tell each individual input saves the desired display settings (brightness/contrast etc..)This TV comes with plenty of connections for HDMI, Component, Composite, USB, etc.. Everything I need.This TV has been perfect thus far. My only problem was that when I first turned it on my remote had a button stuck in and wouldn't work so I thought it was broken. Once I realised te button was stuck and unstuck it, it worked great as well.Speaking of the remote, it has normal remote functions on the front and a QWERTY keyboard on the back.

What an improvement !First off, going from a 32\" to a 42\" is a major step up.  The difference in screen size is impressive.  Vizio makes this model in a 32\" and I was considering buying that one but I'm glad we opted for the larger 42.  Buyers should be aware that the 32\" has a 60hz refresh rate while the 42\" has a 120hz refresh rate.  I didn't have an opportunity to compare the two but the 120hz should make a sharper picture.  Mine came with the remote that has a qwerty keyboard on the back.  The keys on the remote side are wide and narrow, just right for us and makes a small handy-size remote device overall.  The qwerty keyboard makes it simple to enter your credentials into the built-in Netflix app which is really nice.  You can also use remote side by navigating around the character grid like I would do on a remote with no keyboard.Amazon delivery:I ordered the TV online Tuesday evening and UPS delivered it at 9am Friday morning - very fast.  It didn't qualify for free standard shipping, but the 3 day delivery was only .99cents, an even better option.Setup:When the TV is turned on for the first time, you go through a short setup wizard to configure your TV which made it easy to set it up.Boot Up:My TV will cold start and have a picture going in 18 seconds.  A little quicker if it's warm.  I've read some reviews saying it boots slowly but 18 seconds is not too slow as far as I'm concerned.Apps:There are quite a few apps built in including Netflix, Web Videos, Rhapsody, Yahoo News, Weather, Vudu, Hulu Plus, Yahoo Finance, Flickr, Amazon Instant Video, You Tube, Skype, Twitter, Facebook, MGO and Yahoo TV Store.  There is a floating app bar (you can hide it) at the bottom of the screen to easily scroll through and select any built-in app.  The remote control also features Amazon, Netflix and Vudu buttons that take you directly to those apps using a single button.  I find navigating and moving back and forth between apps or an app and the dish to be as simple as it can be.  I use Netflix and YouTube regularly and the qwerty keyboard on the remote makes searching YouTube easy and fast.  Both apps work very good.  I haven't used most of the other apps, just Yahoo news a few times.Media App:I have a lot of .mp4 movies on a PS3 that were made using Handbrake with H.264 (x264) codec.  I copied a dozen or so of them to a 32gig USB flash drive and they all play perfectly with the Media app.  My windows 7 media server is recognized and streams videos over wireless well but the Media app on the TV wants to play only .wmv video files over DLNA.  I copied some of the .mp4's that play fine on the USB flash drive, to the windows 7 media server but when I try to play them on the TV, I get an invalid codec message, even though that same file will play from a USB port on the TV.  I've tried the media player codec pack as well as the k-lite codec megapack and I'm pretty sure the right codecs are installed but windows seems to only stream .wmv's correctly.  I don't know a lot about videos codecs and formats so maybe someone else that's had success streaming .mp4's from windows 7 can add something that will help to this.Settings:There is a rich set of options that let you configure your picture and sound to your viewing preference.  Nine preconfigured picture choices for movies, games, sports etc... are included and a custom option that you can setup any way you want.  You can also fine tune each of the preset choices if you don't want to start from scratch.  There are also several options for configuring sound.Picture:I love the picture.  Sharp, crisp and colorful.  Watching one of our favorite movies or TV shows is a great viewing experience.3D:This feature wasn't one of the reasons I bought this TV but it's nice to know it's there.  I don't have any 3D movies and my TV service package doesn't have any 3D channels.  It did come with a pair of 3D glasses though. If I ever rent a 3D movie on blu-ray I have a PS3 and the glasses.Sound:I find the sound quality to be good for built-in speakers.  Much better than the old TV and the Surround Sound is actually pretty good.  The volume capability is good for built in speakers.  We normally keep the sound between 30% and 50% volume but it can definitely be loud with higher settings.  Our TV is in a small room so the built-in speakers work well for us.  If you put it in a large room you'll probably want an optional sound system.  Our speakers make no humm, hiss or buzz of any kind.  All you hear is the sound of your TV show or music.Wireless:Connecting to the router is a piece of cake.  It found my router and let me configure it during the initial setup.  My router is an Asus RTN12 with dd-wrt firmware, a couple of years old.  I've read some reviews where connecting to old routers can be problematic but it wasn't for me.  The Neflix app works great as does the Yahoo news and weather.  Streaming over DLNA wireless works but see the Media App note above.Warranty:I purchased the 4 year SquareTrade extended warranty from Amazon at the time of my purchase for an extra $83.  I thought it was a decent warranty and priced pretty reasonably.  If you do opt for this warranty, be aware that the coverage will only pay up to a maximum total of the original purchase price of the TV over the life time of the warranty.Overall, I love this TV and highly recommend it to others.  There is a lot of bang for your buck in this TV.**UPDATE (10/5/2012) - I just discovered that I can play all of my .mp4 videos by plugging my Seagate 2TB USB hard drive directly into a usb port on the TV.  I had read an older review stating that you couldn't run a usb hard drive connected directly to the TV but mine works perfectly.  The hard drive I am using is a Seagate FreeAgent GoFlex Desk 2 TB USB 3.0 External Hard Drive STAC2000106.  Now I don't need to bother with streaming from computer.  This TV gets better all the time.**UPDATE (10/16/2012) - Tried out the 3D a couple of nights ago with the most recent Transformers 3D movie.  Awesome is how I describe the experience.  Just like being at the theater but at home.**UPDATE (1/8/2013) - TV is still working like new.  Picture is beautiful.  No problems with any of the apps or built in wifi and media player.  We've watched a few 3D movies on it and the 3D is a true in-home 3D theater experience.  I Love this TV.**UPDATE (4/11/2013) - After 6 and 1/2 months of daily use, the picture is as beautiful as ever.  Absolutely no problems encountered thus far.  Great television.**UPDATE (11/24/2013) - We've had this TV for 14 months now with almost continuous daily use and the picture and sound are as good as day one.  Watching 3D movies like Avatar is just like being in the theater.

I was able to play some pretty sweet 3d vids on youtube though.the speakers, despite what nearly every reviewer mentions....were not that bad.  wife was vacuuming in the background and i cranked the tv up to 50 (out of 100) and could hear just fine.  if you're expecting a full enveloping surround sound, look elsewhere and expect to pay 3 times as much as this tv.tried the wii.  needed to switch to game mode in order for the controller lag to disappear.  worked just fine, but teaching my 6 year old how to do that could be a pain.  i'm not sure if the tv remembers the individual settings for each specific input...havent investigated that yet.the worst part about the tv in my opinion...the startup time.  it literally takes 15-20 seconds to get fully up and running.bought on amazon with a squaretrade warranty for the same price i couldve bought at walmart without a warranty.overall i think it's a solid tv and unbeatable in this price range.  i wish the processor was a little speedier on startup and youtube worked better, but other than that, no real complaints yet.3 WEEK UPDATE:  TV is still great.  I am not having the difficulty that others are saying with the remote.  it's not bluetooth like newer/more expensive models, but the remote is smart enough that when typing with the keyboard you dont have to turn your body sideways to make it work.  typing on it is similar to typing with a tactile phone keyboard (think blackberry) and the buttons dont have to be pressed all that hard to register.  the lag in start up time continues to be my only real complaint...other than i would have liked two component video inputs for some older hardware i've got.i did find out the tv is smart enough to remember that game mode should turn on when the input source is changed to the wii, and turn off when changed to the cable box.", "Date": "October 8, 2012"}, {"Title": "Excellent TV Lots of Features", "Author": "Mike C", "ReviewID": "R12A1H9W122EOU", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I have had this 42 in Vizio TV for about 2 months now and I am very happy with my purchase. At $638 this was a real bargain even if it didn't have 3D capability.2D: Has a fantastic  picture right out of the box.  The pre select settings are pretty close to being right on.  If not some tweaking will get it just the way you like it.  The automatic light sensor (when enabled) works great without it being noticeable as it works. If the sun comes out or goes behind a cloud the tv picture adjusts to just the right brightness. Also, I can tell the difference with the 120 hz refresh rate vs 60 hz. I am not sure your eyes could tell the difference between 120 hz vs 240 hz, so I opted for the 120 hz version.  I have seen some advertised as high as 480hz but not sure if it would be worth the expense.  You also have to consider the source material and whether it is in 240 hz or 480 hz format.Netflix: I really like that you can connect to the internet and hook up to Netflix without having to go through another device. Especially with a PS3 that uses quite a lot of electricity. Oh, this TV uses very little electricity. $19.00 /yr at 5 hours per day. Another nice point to consider. And it puts out very little heat compared to my previous HDTV.There are many other settings you can adjust to your liking that are too numerous to talk about here.  But go through your manual to see if there are any that you would like to change.  There is even a lip sych adjustment in the other settings area.3D:  I do like the passive 3D glasses:  (Inexpensive and lightweight) You can even order extras if needed online, but not through Vizo since their price was much higher.  The 3D picture is amazing with the right source material. Now not all 3D is created equal, but when it is filmed correctly it shines on this tv.  There is some ghosting on some 3D material, but again you have to consider the source. The angle of viewing also affects the amount of ghosting so be aware of that. Another thing I noticed is that there is a vanishing point in distance where the 3D effect disappears. This probably varies with the type of 3D camera being used. You will notice that things far away will look 2D. This is normal an not a TV defect.  If you have Directv, you are in luck since there are 4 channels that have 3D content and it doesn't cost anything extra to view them, except for the premium movie channel. I especially like watching Lady's Tennis in 3D. Football not so much, but there is a good variety on DirecTV's 3D channels. I have a DVR and it works good recording 3D content as well.Sound: The sound of the TV is lame as is the case for just about all Flat Panels.  But I really like the optical audio output so I can hook up the TV to my JVC 5.1 surround sound system. All sources are HDMI and whatever source being used goes right into my sound system.I do like the remote too in that you can control Netflix with it as well as the TV itself.  I could go on but other reviewers have done a pretty good job with many of the other specifics about this product.In conclusion, I can recommend this Vizio. Yeah I know you're skeptical because its not a Sony, LG, or Samsung etc., but it's every bit as good and much less expensive.I did get a chance to use Pandora and it works great once I figured out how to use it.

Have tried 3D with a few different movies, all using 3D TB (TB = Top Bottom) settings with varying results.  Pirates of the Caribbean/Stranger Tides was aweful in 3D, the 3D was inconsistent and jumbled and unwatchable (I had to stop it after less than 30 minutes of movie time).  Green Lantern on the other hand was great in 3D especially the beginning sequence.  My cable provider has a couple 3D channels playing random stuff.  The SBS (Side by Side) channel worked great but the same program on the TB (Top Bottom) was really bad.  3D isn't perfect but I bought the TV for HD and its fatastic.  3D when it works well is just a bonusA couple comments that might help others:1. Make sure you use a high speed HDMI cable for best picture quality.2.

It's not noticeable for day-to-day viewing, but if you use a calibration DVD, you'll see it. Unfortunately this is typical for IPS panels, although they have relatively wide viewing angles. If you're looking for deep blacks, you'll want to pass on this model.The unit makes a constant low humming or buzzing noise when powered on. It's noticeable if you're up close to the TV or if you have the volume muted and you're in a quiet room. Increasing the backlight to level 100 and turning off the light sensor and dynamic contrast makes the noise go away, but you'll need to re-adjust your picture settings.It takes a full 15 seconds for the TV to boot up, and channel switching is somewhat slow. Channels on the skip list are not accessible by any method. You cannot input the channel on the remote control for an occasional view.The remote control unit is easily the worst feature of this TV. The buttons are tiny and jam-packed together, and they're difficult to press unless you use your fingernails. Although there's tactile feedback, you often find yourself pushing twice because there wasn't enough pressure the first time. The buttons are also very short and if you press too hard at the wrong angle, they get stuck underneath the surface of the cut-out and you have to pry them back up.The IR sensor on the TV has a very narrow field of reception--you have to aim the remote directly at the sensor or it won't pick up the signal.Pros: Overall good picture quality and vibrant color. Front-firing speakers that sound pretty decent. Most of the TVs on the market today (especially thin LED models) have down-firing or rear-firing speakers which produce muffled audio.

Before long, I found this tv and was watching the price carefully to see the trends.  Last week, I finally went for it.  I had planned on the 42\", but ended up getting the 47\", and wow, this tv has only impressed.  I'll update the review if anything changes (breaks), but as of right now, I couldn't be more pleased with the product.  2D picture is superb, especially with Blu-Ray movies, and the 3D is really a nice feature.  Note: you need the source to be connected with HDMI to access the 3D options on the tv.  Everything else is about what you'd expect (just read any other review about this tv), but in my case, I also wanted to try the \"dual-view\" gaming.  No one else made mention of it (that I saw), but if you are in the minority of people who care about dual-view, let me assure you, it works fine on this tv.  You can look it up on youtube, but basically, you use the 3D feature to display 2 images simultaneously - which can then be separated through makeshift double-left and double-right lens 3D glasses.  Anyway, it works beautifully, although there is some ghosting of the second image if you are not positioned near directly in front of the screen.  Needless to say, I am very happy with this purchase, and I can't wait to try out more 3D movies.  Of note: I've read several complaints about the remote.  Yes, the back (qwerty keyboard) is not the most responsive, but the front side has not given me any trouble.  Bottom line: I don't think you can find a better tv with these specs for the price - I looked.  Well, maybe on black friday, but then you'd miss out on family time as most black friday deals are starting soon after Thanksgiving dinner - bleh.  Best of luck to you!p.s. I game on the 360, though I'm sure everything works for PS3 as well.

Never really considered 3D, but since it was included for the same price or less as other non 3D TV's I thought why not?  Friends who own Vizio TV's also said they liked them.  So, I ordered it and it arrived within a few days (ahead of schedule with the free shipping).  TV was double boxed i.e. Vizio branded box was bubble wrapped and another plain box was added outside original.  Good job really, since the outer box had taken quite a beating - inner box was virtually undamaged. Tip - flip Vizio box upside down, open from bottom, take out styro and carefully rotate package - TV will slide out easily.  Set up was very easy - except for one thing...when connecting to the home network the screen asks you to enter your network password- but none of the buttons on the remote keyboard work!!  So the highlight just sits there and you can't type in your password - TIP: hit the 'OK' button on the remote (think the V button does the same thing) and then another screen with a keyboard will pop up ON THE TV which you then use similarly to Netflix - i.e. using the remote arrow keys to highlight a letter/number and hit \"OK\" to accept.Am very pleased with the picture/sound on the TV - as good if not better than my 52\" Sammy, for under $699.

The TV has to compete with high levels of daytime ambient lighting and reflections. It does so admirably. The panel itself is not of the \"glossy\" type, which lends itself to reducing the reflections that some other displays ( notably plasmas with their glass surface ) have. In a perfect world, the Vizio would have a limited sheen bezel as well, but this is not the case. Piano black and very glossy.  Connectability:  A full complement of connections are available and well thought out on this display. If you are going to connect any legacy equipment that requires analog connections you will not have the problem of running out of input jacks. (As a side note, be aware of the lower priced models. Vizio has \"dual purposed\" the component/composit jack pack making that connection an \"either/or\" situation.) A side jack pack is also available and is handy for temporary hookups.  Ergonomics:  The remote is a classy little brick. The qwerty keyboard on the flip side proves to be very handy if you search frequently for various programming from your cable/sat provider or Netflix/Vudo or similar. My mother immediately said she would never use the keyboard until she found just how simple it is to use in comparison with the standard \"letter selection\" process normally found as your only option. Well done Vizio. I'd like to see some of the better universal programmable remotes have a qwerty keyboard as well.  Side control options are poorly marked as usual, but since very rarely used, quite the norm.  The stand has an interesting flaw. When properly connected to the panel itself, the display actually leans back a few degrees from vertical. Since LCD technology still requires us to be pretty much centered in front of the display, I found that I had to modify the stance with the effect of pointing the display to the sight line. Since the Vizio is even a touch fussier than some other makers in this regard, I was surprised at the lack of a swivel/tilt stand on this 3d capable display.  Performance:  After making the connections and dialing in the built in wifi for the apps, a pleasantly simply procedure by the way, I immediately noticed the limited viewing angle issue mentioned before. Be aware of this if your seating configuration covers a wide area. Those outside of the somewhat limited \"sweet spot\" will not have the same viewing experience as the front and center crowd. If you are front and center although, a very nice bright image is viewed. The controls are all there if you wish to adjust for various lighting scenarios and as an ISF tech, I was pleased to see a full complement of drives and cuts to dial in the grayscale in the advanced user section. After setting the black and white level controls, I measured the contrast ratio at nearly 600 to one using the checkerboard ANSI pattern. Very decent for a ccfl LCD display. The primary and secondary color points were spot on and after dialing in the grayscale a bit, film DVD/BluRay viewing in a darkened room (evening in this case) proved the display to be quite capable. The 3D capability with the enclosed passive shades was not tested.  Conclusion:  A lot of bang for the buck here. It is no wonder the once titans of tv's are scratching their heads. Vizio has a fine display here for a well lighted room with a casual viewer as the target market.d6500k", "Date": "August 28, 2011"}, {"Title": "An amazing TV", "Author": "David Gish", "ReviewID": "R1CTO5TIZEE7LM", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Wow!!!!What a shock I had upgrading to this TVI have had this TV for 4 days now and am extreemly happy with it.Don't laugh to hard at this, but I was using an analog 32 inch TV untill last thursday.This TV was the perfect upgrade for me, same height as the old analog but alot widerI plugged everything in, 2 HDMI cables, RGB Cables, old antena, hung it on the wall with the Cheetah Wall Mount I purchased with it, plugged it into a new APC AV Surge protector. Turned on the TV, setup the wireless connection, setup my profile, downloaded the new Widgets to get Amazon Instant Videos and started watching my Video Library in about 30 minutes.I was suspect at videos where Amazon says they are viewable in Hi Def on your TV, so I setup my TV on Amazon instant videos and last night I watched DR. Doolittle in High Def, WOW what a huge differanceThis TV is super clear, love the 120hz (I was looking at some of the TV's under $400, and all were 60hz), the boot up is a little slow, but not anything to complain about.I select Amazon Instant Video and search, go to my Video Library, check Prime Instant Videos, selecting the videos is fast, so far all the movies I have purchased are viewable in Hi Def on the TV (where they are not all in Hi Def on my computer monitor).I sign up for the TV Series I want to watch and subscribe to weekly updates, this is cheaper and better than having cable.It is kinda like a kid in a candy store, I love love love this TV.I was shocked that it was a Prime item (free shipping).The only complaint I have is it was a day late getting here (2 day air with Prime), I called Fed EX and was told it was labeled on Monday but not shipped till tuesday, and arrived on thursday (it should have been shipped on monday and arrived on Wednessday, sheduled to arrive on Wednessday anyway), but it got here and I am extreemly happy.If I could give this TV 10 stars I would.I did allot of research on TV's before I purchased (about 6 months) learnig all I could, talking to friends and family about their experiences, Visio has thumbs up from everyone I have talked to that has one (about 10 people I talked to, my Brother has 2).I dont have any 3D movies yet, and am still using my RGB DVD player. will be purchasing a new Blue Ray 3D player next month and a new multi region DVD Hi DEF player also, I doubt I will purchase any 3D movies untill the price drops allot.I never dreamed that a TV could connect to the internet (looking from my analog world), or that I could purchase a Hi Def TV this good for such a great price.I highly recommend this TV to anyone looking for above 32 inch and under 50 inch", "Date": "August 22, 2011"}, {"Title": "An Excellent 3d TV for starters with very few flaws", "Author": "Kent D", "ReviewID": "R2PGDRS3BSXJHA", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "For the past 24 months I've had nothing but a small, square 480i television serving as my bedroom entertainment and for my dorm in college. It got the job done, but when I played split-screen games with friends the size constraints really showed. So I decided to upgrade and I haven't looked back after buying my VIZIO. I wasn't in the market for a 3D TV. I liked the idea, but it seemed only huge and expensive TV's had the hardware. Imagine my surprise when I found a 32\" (Which is fairly large for a small bedroom/dorm)with full 1080p HD and 3D support! Not only that, but its a great TV with some really nice features. If you're on the fence, here's a little breakdown of the pro's and con's of this particular model.Pros:-Excellent 3D imagery with light battery free glasses. (No real noticeable difference between the two types of glasses picture wise. The shapes of the frames are slightly different though.)-A decent sound system which I find to be rare in most smaller televisions. (Not much bass oomph, but to be expected.)-Plenty of HDMI ports for lots of hook ups.-Crisp 1080p picture that tends to rival my 64\" downstairs.-Compatible with my CPU to get a bigger screen in 1080p that looks great through HDMI cords (I lacked the connection cables that could connect a macbook pro through the PC Input on the back).-Affordable, by 3D standards. Couldn't recommend it enough.Cons: I'll go into more detail here in case, for some reason these are deal breakers for you.-The biggest problem for me was the position for best 3D quality. It requires 5 and half to around 6 feet before the picture is no longer distorted. When playing shooters I tend to have to sit closer because I have a lot of problems spotting enemies on screem. I get a little distortion by going just past the recommended distance, but it wasn't unplayable. In fact, the only thing I really noticed was that my crosshair had slightly unfocused, but while actually fighting it wasn't a problem.-The remote keys stick a little. For me, I have trouble with the 'E' key and find myself often having to go back and retype it. This can be a hassle if you are really into the apps (which are more just a bonus to me rather than a main attraction).-While on that front, the interface for the apps is also a little annoying at times. But if you have a little bit of patience you should be fine.-Keep the remote near you when activating 3D. I turned it on in Crysis 2 for my PS3 and the TV prompted me with a YES or NO to activate, but only gave me ~5 secs to hit YES. When I didn't reach the remote in time, it made me cycle through the TV menu to turn it on. Just a little frustrating.-Auto screen dimmer can be flawed at times. Light in my room may remain consistent, but the screen did brighten itself a noticeable amount once or twice for no reason. Doesn't happen often though.-Had a small issue with lag in my games. Not really fair to call this a Con, however, seeing as it is easily fixed by hitting \"Game Mode ON\" in the settings menu (not the picture menu.)Aside from that, its been great. I'll be sure to update if there are more issues that emerge, but for someone who is looking for a small and affordable 3D TV without sacraficing quality, you can't go wrong with this VIZIO 32\".", "Date": "June 17, 2011"}, {"Title": "Great, bargain 3D TV - Great for the price, Really Good in comparison to what's out there", "Author": "C. D. Posten \"ENTJ dad\"", "ReviewID": "RWU25U8ZAHOBQ", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I bought this TV back in April, so I've had it a little over six months now.  It was an upgrade from a 32\" HD (non-3D).  I chose it because it had a great picture in the store, uses passive glasses, and it was a steal.  I have not once regretted my purchase, although there are some flaws.  So let's skip the pros for now and get right to the cons:1) The remote is pretty bad.  Lots of little buttons all scrunched up together with no intuitive layout and you have to press them pretty firmly to get a response.  I do like that there's a full qwerty keyboard on the flip side of the remote.  I don't use it that often, but it's convenient when I need it.  A non-essential but very cool gizmo feature.  If I were rating the remote by itself, I'd give it 1 star, 2 tops. But I only need that remote occasionally (to access Netflix, for instance.) Otherwise, I just volley between the Comcast universal remote and the PS3 remote.  This isn't a dealbreaker, by any means.2) SD picture is not great for sports (but fine for just about everything else).  I get a ton of sports channels that aren't offered in HD yet (at least not on Comcast in my area), and the SD picture on sports with fast action leaves quite a bit to be desired - significant motion blur, indistinct images, poor resolution.  Some of it may be the signal coming through these channels in the first place - but not all of it.  I've gotten good pictures on these channels from other TVs.  To me, this is kind of a biggie because that's what separates the good HDTVs from the great ones - how well they can play NON-HD stations.  It would've cost the rating more than one star except that this makes up such a small percentage of my watching - and the rest of my experience has been excellent - that it was only worth knocking off one star for me.  For some, though, it might be worth more.That's really all the bad I can say.  Yeah, the sound's not fantastic, but I knew going into it that I'd be buying a sound bar eventually.  I still haven't bought that sound bar yet, and the TV's sound is still acceptable.  Not great, but you can't expect to shake the house with a TV's built-in speakers.  It just doesn't happen.  I'm ok with it.Other than those few things, though, I truly enjoy this purchase.1) It plays 3D extremely well, both through Bluray on my PS3 as well as through the 3D channels Comcast offers. (Football in 3D still leaves a heckuva lot to be desired, by the way.  Woof.) The picture is crystal clear,and the 3D images are just that.  3D.  Never had a problem with it - aside from when I picked the wrong setting to watch 3D, and that was user error.  You're best off, by the way, letting the TV tell you when it gets a 3D signal, rather than trying to select the 3D signal from the TV's settings before the signal actually comes through.  You're liable to get it wrong, but the TV picks the right setting every time. Just let it do its thing.2) I really like the fact that it uses passive 3D glasses.  I have a ton of them lying around, and they all work fine.  I've had 8 people watching in 3D at once before, and active shutter glasses would've cost me $500 minimum to allow that (and probably more).  I do see a bit of a difference between active and passive (to my eyes, active seems to jump out at you a little more while passive seems to have more depth to it), but personally I like the way the passive looks better.  I wasn't super keen on the active sets I looked at and thought they would probably give me a headache after watching them a while.  I've never had any issues with watching through these passive glasses.3) WiFi enabled out of the box.  Set up was easy, signal is strong, nary a problem here.  One of the instances where the qwerty keyboard was nice, typing in my wpa key.4) I've played around with a couple of the pre-installed internet applications (and there are lots more you can download), but I've really only dug into Netflix.  No problems here either.  The only times a show's ever stopped to buffer have been when either Netflix or my Internet connection was having problems (as verified by the fact that the issues followed me to other Netflix-connected devices in the house.) Streaming's been great - no concerns.5) It seems nearly infinitely adjustable.  A ton of settings to tweak to your heart's desire.  You may need to play around a little to get the picture just the way YOU want it (because many of the customizations are really for personal preference), but it looked great right out of the box, and my tweaking made minor changes at best.  Nevertheless, it's nice to be ABLE to tweak.  In fact, the only tweak I really NEEDED to make was turning off the Smooth Motion motion compensation.  It created a noticeable \"soap opera effect\", which was distracting when watching regular shows, and I really only need it, want it, and turn it back on when watching sports.6) Great price.  I got it on special at the time for a little less than $800.  Looks like it's about $800 now, so there you go.  Still a great price now.So there you have it.  Really great set for the price.  Not perfect but perfectly enjoyable.  Are there better 3DHDTVs out there?  Yeah probably.  But would you pay a ton more money for them?

My previous set is almost the same one from 2 years ago minus the 3d and online features and I have to say vizio has really improved the picture quality. The blacks are blacker and the 2d performance is just great. I was very pleased with my first vizio so I had no problem throwing down the dough for this one and after a weekend of use all I can say is \"wow\". They have hit one out of the park with this one and I'm starting to call it \"the little tv that could\".  The first thing I did after hooking it up and setting up the wifi, which was a snap with the onscreen prompts, was fire up COD black ops on my xbox 360 and turn on the 3d feature. Holy cow is the effect great, your weapon feels like it is in your hand and the game world gains all kinds of depth. No disappointment there, crysis two also supports 3d and while the effect isn't as dramatic there it is still darn good. I searched online and stumbled across an xbox live arcade game called 3d infinity,I recommend grabbing the free demo at least. It is a simple 3d shooter but it made me blink thinking objects were going to smack me in the face on more than one occasion. Then onto the Ps3. I picked up motor storm apocalypse just for this tv and I'm glad I did great game, great 3d, Nuff said.  I snagged a 3d blue ray IMAX wild ocean and the once again I was very satisfied with the 3d performance.  The glasses (they provide 2) are stylish and comfortable and are not gaudy or goofy looking at all. All my connections are hdmi so the digital sound is delivered from the source in that manner so once again super simple the digital optical output of the tv plugs right into my yamaha 5.1 receiver and I changed the settings the Dolby digital and the sound is superb.  I didn't really care to much about the online capabilities of the tv, I was more about the 3d but after playing with it I now adore this new dimension and will be using it all the time. The weather,yahoo and flicker are all great but the icing on the cake is the rhapsody widget I am a subscriber and a huge fan of the service and the ability to digitally deliver my library and playlist and their radio stations to my receiver almost brought tears to my eyes. I don't know if the music is in 5.1 surround or not but the way the music wraps around you and fills the room is some of the best implementation I have ever heard. By the way a 30 day free trial of rhapsody is offered on the widget and only a fool wouldn't try it for free.  So there you have it, the tv, the glasses,the remote and yes even the screwdriver all deliver.

I'd say for it to fully turn on and get moving is a good 5-10 seconds.  Not a huge issue, but it is what it is.Another issue for me is it's wifi capabilities.  My router is in my basement right under the tv.  Certain areas tell me i have the maximum amount of bars (4 or 5) for signal quality. yet other areas say i have 2.  I pick up the signal with all my wireless devices anywhere in my house without issue.  Yet when I am watching something on Amazon Prime it will spontaneously lose signal, or not load it at all.  Makes no sense to me other than believing the wifi hardware is trash compared to many others.My last complaint is the remote.  The remote feels very cheap.  It is pretty awesome that it has a keyboard on the back  especially if you plan to tweet or post on Facebook or what not ( i don't but it would be convenient if i did).It is a thin plastic, feels like it could be a toy for an 8 year old boy.  that and the controls can be sluggish.

I could not get the volume to adjust with the TV remote so I want to hook up a set of computer speakers sometime to make sure that can be done in case I want a better soundbar or surround sound system.Just watched a preview on the 3D movie I purchased and this 3D stuff is going to be way cooler than I anticipated.November 3, 2012Still very pleased with this purchase. The remote hasn't turned out to be an issue after getting used to it.The 3D was a neat novelty but wore off by the second movie. We actually had a bad experience with 3D on the second one. We watched about 2/3 of a movie without taking a break and all of our eyes started to get irritated. We finished the movie with the 2D disc and haven't messed with 3D since. The first 3D movie we watched we took a break every 20 minutes or so and had no such problem. I tried the simulated 3D on the TV and from the Sony Blu-Ray player and neither were anything I would consider usable. The picture quality is great in regular 2D mode and newer blu-ray movies seem to have near 3D depth without this feature.Even though the sound wasn't that bad I added a pair of Tascom speakers with a sub woofer to enhance the sound. It sounds a lot more dynamic but the sub woofer on this set is not very strong. I would like to add a quality surround sound but the wife would not let me crank it up if I did so this is a compromise.", "Date": "October 18, 2012"}, {"Title": "awesome price - great 3D quality", "Author": "Halo Guy", "ReviewID": "R3NONRW8BNL8XS", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I bought this Tv a little skeptical of Vizio's brand but after researching this TV has upped my expectations, i saw this TV in action In my local Store, and compared the video quality to that of a Samsung of the same size and quality of 3d, the active glasses did not impress me but passive no matter what was on was amazing, at times the active glasses seemed blurry on and off.After receiving my TV I opened it up and plugged up my PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360, after looking at the 3d games ( halo anniversary edition, and Shadow of the colossus combo pack of ICO games, I was very impressed at the 3d capability of the TV's and after buying Avatar in 3d today and watching it, this Tv has blown me away for the price of $550 when i bought it, now its time to buy the Extended warranty just in case but knowing how LCD's last i may not need it but its a precautionary measure.Also the Internet apps are great, wireless built in was a shock i thought it just had normal wired connection to the internet when i purchased it.the only downside of this TV is the Remote, you need to be somewhat far away to use if you are to close its like hitting a button 5 times to get it do what you want, also the buttons to turn it on are on the back, but like way behind the left side of the tv, at first i almost thought you would need the remote to turn it on and off only.", "Date": "October 16, 2012"}, {"Title": "Great Buy", "Author": "Ren \"Ren\"", "ReviewID": "R3RA7I9580V4F4", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I purchased this tv as a gift for my younger son for his birthday.

It was very bare bones and basic. It had no streaming capabilities or anything. I probably spent a similar amount getting that HDTV nearly two years ago that I spent getting this 32 inch Vizio 3DTV.This TV is infinitely better than the Emerson. So let me start with what I love about the TV:1. The 3D works great on 3D specific content on both the 3D Blu rays and the HBO 3D content.2. I definitely noticed the 1080p HD quality difference that I never noticed with my 720p Emerson tv.3. I love the Netflix and Amazon Instant Video buttons on the remote.4. Connecting to the internet was pretty smooth (can't say the same for my 3D Blu ray player5. At the top right corner, the TV will tell you what the quality of the program is in. For instance on a standard channel, it will say 480p but on an HD channel it will say 1080p.Now here are things I don't like:1. Sometimes the sound will automatically lower itself2. The thick black framing around the screen makes the TV look smaller3. 2D to 3D conversion does not work properly at all either on the TV or my Sony 3D blu ray player.4. Even though there is a widescreen button to change size settings, sometimes a widescreen movie or a full screen movie will appear as a small square surrounded by black on all 4 sides. Its quite annoying.5. The position of the HDMI cables and control buttons. My TV has to sit in a corner in our apartment next to a bookcase where our Motorola box sits at. My 3d Blu ray player sits in front of an old antenna TV that is too big for us to move out of the house, so we use it as a stand. The position of the panel on the far right side of the TV makes no sense to me. But even more confusing is the the control buttons such as the power button being placed on the right side of the TV as opposed to beneath the TV.But are these problems enough to make it a bad TV? Nope. Coming from a bare basics TV that had a bunch of bad reviews, this TV is pretty great. Sure it has its problems but no TV is perfect. So far, I enjoy it very much. I will probably update in the future as I get more used to it or if it starts misbehaving at an alarming rate like I've read of other reviews.I think this TV is definitely worth getting if you are in the least bit interested in 3D. 3D content is improving a lot. So far I only own 2 movies (Titanic and Avengers) and both of them look great. I've also utilized my cable's 3D offerings and have enjoyed movies like Harold and Kumar 3D and having seen the 2D in theaters can definitely say the movie works a lot better in 3D.But if 3D isn't your thing and you know no one else that would love it then you can probably find a cheaper bare basics TV for a hundred or so dollars less and maybe add a Roku box to it to get your streaming content.Update:So I've had this TV for a year and I don't use it much yet it stopped working. The sound is okay but the screen turns black. I am not surprised to find out that this TV is no longer in production.

That being said, I do like how it has other apps you can use, such as Youtube, Netflix, Facebook, Skype, etc... switching from screen to screen is a bit laggy, though that might have to do more with the internet speed than the TV. It is technically a 3D TV (comes with 2 pairs of 3D glasses), but you still need a 3D player (PS3, Blue ray player, etc...) and a 3D movie; I don't have either, so I can't comment on how well it plays 3D flicks.All in all, very easy to set up, decent size, definitely worth the money.

Carvajal \"jay105\"", "ReviewID": "RJMJVUMUE55UO", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "First of all let's start saying that at the price I bought this T.V in Amazon ($579) this is a steal!!!. I have read almost all the reviews not only in here but in Cnet, Tiger Direct, etc. and I was afraid of the problems that some people mentioned. Let's go 1 by 1 so if you decide to buy this T.V you will avoid all the hassle others has been through.1, Problems with clarity of Signal in 3D while using games consoles etc. Bad 3d lenes.  To avoid any problems don't be cheap and stop using your old cables ot eh glasses you \"forgot\" to return in your movie theater. this is new technology and to enjoy it properly you have to keep with the new requirements. You don't have to break the bank to get the best of this T.V. I bought the new series 2 certified cables on this same web page the Mediabridge Ultra series ($9.99) and 3 pairs of new RealD compatible Polarized Glasses ($8.51). The best money you ever spend!.In my case the 3D image is crisp, vibrant and left almost nothing to desire in comparison to a $2.000 T.V with lenses costing $200 each!!! Yes you have to be in front of the T.V because when you moved to the sides or too much up or down the image deteriorate a bit but give me a $1.000 in savings and I will seat in the middle happy with the money I saved!!!2. Too much Ghosting - Soap Opera effect, not as vibrant image in 2D  than \"more Expensive\" T.Vs.The solution for these problems in my case was rather simple. I follow some of the advices from C.Rickel \"Turn the auto-motion off. On this Vizio, Menu>Picture>More>Advanced>Smooth Picture Mode and turn it to \"off.\" Always can be turned back on for a game.:  I also changed the picture quality to \"Game\". I adjusted the colors to increase blue to 130 decrease green 110, increase red 130. Turn off the light dimming thing. The soap opera effect disappeared, not more ghosting but a clear vibrant image.  I get my signal from a Time Warner Box that actually only sends signal at 720p (lower end of HD but some theorist and studies actually recommend this for watching fast paced action games and action movies). I get my 3d signal from a 3d/High def capable DVD.3. Bad Sound. Yes, this Vizio won't win any sound or aesthetic competition or put Bose on the brink of Bankruptcy but you can play with the settings as well.  I set \"the surround sound on\", \"Reduced Noise\" is \"On\" and the sound improved a bit still kind of flat. I have not done that yet but I think I will buy the VIZIO VSB200 Universal HD Sound Bar ($100) I already saved around $1.000 in comparison with the TV's I was looking for so this won't be a biggie. Sound on the other hand is \"Acceptable\" bass is the one that is missed like in all cheap speakers. Trust me if you are a regular user the sound is average/acceptable for a regular size room.4. Useless remote Control. Read lots of complains with the remote. Have this people ever complain while sending a text message in a I-phone or other cell phones? In comparison to the cellular phones QWERTY keyboards the keys in this remote are actually BIG and have some spacing between the keys (Try that with an i-phone 4s for example).  Yes the keys felt a little bit soft and unresponsive you have to press them to the bottom but they do the work again a regular user that has not read the negative comments most likely would not even notice.So far when I Bought the T.V there were 205 \"5 stars\" reviews from a 314 total reviews that means a absolute positive factor of almost 65% add the 4 stars (56 at the time I bought the T.V) and the positive appreciation factor jumps to 86%!!! I read the negatives and it is my understanding that for bad luck or careless shipping these unfortunate people received defective units. Remember there are almost around 3-5% of defective units not matter the quality of production line this is almost a fact of life and also there is around 5% of people that would never be happy with anything....Get your T.V, make your kiddos happy, save yourself some money and start enjoying 3D.

For the price and features, you will not go wrong.Amazon AND Vizio offer an extended 4 year warranty plan for under $50 on this 32\" set. A small price for long term warranty coverage. I suggest adding it.Yes, its small (32\"). Yes its under $400. Yes it is featured packed. Yes the remote (even without the rear keyboard) is a pleasure to use.Remote challenged folks WILL LOVE this included remote.VUDU...VUDU offers a $5.99 free credit to your VUDU account upon registering this TV with VUDU (both current and new customers).VUDU 3D streaming. VUDU 2-minute free preview of all 3D movie content in their 3D movie catalog.

Hoffman", "ReviewID": "R84WLK2UYBCR2", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "As most other reviews have focused on using this item as a television monitor, I thought I'd share how well this unit performs as an analog PC monitor.First and foremost, the size of the screen may be overwhelming to you.  For me, it's perfect although I have moved it several inches further away than the 23\" HP LED monitor it replaced.  Speaking of the HP monitor, it's hard to believe but the Vizio actually provides a better overall experience for me.  I'm am using the RGB PC input with an older Dell workstation, and set the resolution to 1600x900.  The size of everything on the screen has dramatically increased and I'm able to view the screen without using reading glasses.I have also watched a few Netflix videos streamed using the wi-fi capability.  The movies played perfectly.  The sound from the speakers is decent, but if you want higher quality there are audio output jacks that can feed an outboard system.For the price, the Vizio is hard to pass up.  I may need to buy another one for my wife's PC now that she's seen mine.Update:  My Dell recently became somewhat unreliable, so I replaced it with a new HP i5-based desktop system.  I'm using the HDMI output on the desktop instead of the RGB PC feed (as it doesn't exist on the HP) and have switched the resolution to true 1080 HD.  The picture quality is still sensational, despite a slight downgrade in dot pitch from a true computer monitor.  Considering the versatility this TV/Monitor provides, it is an easy choice if you plan to use it primarily with your PC.Next update:  To save a few bucks (actually over $100) I bought my wife a Sceptre 32\" 1080P television, which according to my research, was a Vizio design.  Unfortunately, it does not equal this machine in text display capability.

Singley", "ReviewID": "R3MO2EM0Y6O11E", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "The setup was fairly quick and intuitive, the longest part was the channel scan and the parts that wanted me to type something.  I almost took off a star since the remote I received did not have the keyboard on the back of the remote, but I checked the listing first and the only mention of said keyboard was in a user review of the 42' model.  I guess the 32 comes without it, which was disappointing, but really you only have to use the onscreen keyboard to enter a few things during setup and if you ever do any searching on an app so it's not such a big deal.I did have a problem during setup where it wasn't asking me for logins for netflix or amazon instant video so wouldn't run them.  A quick live chat on Vizio's website pointed me in the right direction though and the fix was as simple as letting it reset to factory settings once.  Of course that meant I needed to run the initial setup again which was mildly annoying, but to be honest I was more annoyed at myself for not trying something so simple before running to tech support.I have the tv connected directly to my incoming cable line without any type of cable box and it found all the channels I get through the cable box in another room and then some.  The picture quality with the standard def channels was perfect when displayed at original size, and only showed a little bit of noise when stretched to full screen.  HD content is outright gorgeous and I can find nothing to complain about there.  Granted this is my first lcd tv of any type but I am more than happy with the quality.The wifi connected easily to my home network and gets great speeds.  And the apps work wonderfully.  Streamed in HD from my Amazon Instant library flawlessly.  Played netflix without a hitch.  I had been disappointed when reading reviews that it said this tv wouldn't play video files from usb drives as that would have been nice.  After actually hooking up the tv however, I have found that would have been a useless feature since this television does something far far better.  It can see DLNA shares so if a video shows in your windows media player video library and you have media sharing enabled this tv can browse files shared over the network and play them directly from your computer.  No need to copy to a usb stick first.  So far I have played mp4, xvid, mov, and wmv files this way and all have worked fine.  It doesn't see mkv's so those would require conversion first.The 3d was another feature I was very excited about and expected to have to wait to try as I don't yet have a blu-ray player or any 3d movies on disk.  I found a quick and easy way to at least see the effect in action though and was VERY impressed.  I installed a youtube downloader plugin and then searched for 3d videos on youtube.  I ended up saving several movie trailers and a few demo videos into a folder on my computer which I then added to my video library and loaded media player so it would update the shared files.  After that they showed up when browsing from the tv and played perfectly in 3d.  There were a few that started playing as two side by side images but simply opening the menu, highlighting 3d and toggling it off then back on started displaying correctly in 3d.  Some clips were better than others, but keeping in mind these were downloads from youtube they were far better than I had expected.  With a well done file the 3d was great and I have no complaints at all.  Now I can't wait to get a 3d blu-ray player and start getting some movies to play with it.Update 8/4/12:  I've had the tv for two weeks now and wanted to update my review just a little bit.  I found out that the television actually does play videos just fine from usb disks.  I have personally used standard thumb drives, microsd cards via a usb adapter, and even my android phone connected via usb and told to connect as mass storage.  In all cases the tv can browse and display photos, play music, and even play video files.I also discovered both an easier way to do searching in the tv's built in youtube app without using the slow onscreen keyboard, and a real use for QR codes. The youtube app has the ability to pair with a mobile device, and when you select this option it shows a QR code on the screen.  Simply scan that code with your phone and it loads up the mobile youtube site and works as expected, with the one difference that when you find a video you want to watch, clicking it starts playback on the television instead of your phone's screen.", "Date": "July 19, 2012"}, {"Title": "Great TV that rivals much more expensive models", "Author": "Eric", "ReviewID": "R3UFMHGVFOPA4X", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I bought this TV because of the great price point.

The picture quality is very good, but the audio on the HDMI port lags behind the sound by a fraction of a second.This causes issues when watching streaming videos on my PS3, but the bluray sound sync is just fine.  Let's just say that there is a definite lag.  Do yourself a favor and get an external sound processor (surround sound or soundbar) and make sure that you don't output the sound from HDMI through the TV.It's not to detract from the TV completely because I love the passive 3D and using those cheap polarized glasses you get at Real-D and other 3D movies nowadays.  Still, when it plays back 3D, it's hard not to enjoy what you have, but keep in mind that when you play at 1080p in 3D, you get two frames at 540p which is still OK.  Also, line doubling for lower-res content works really well.  I've streamed movies from Hulu, Revision3, and Netflix.  Great quality.Basically, if you want 3D, you can't beat the price.  If the audio lags when you use the HDMI, just use a surround sound processor and you're just fine.", "Date": "April 1, 2012"}, {"Title": "Vizio 42\" 3D HDTV", "Author": "Jeremy", "ReviewID": "RA9U1YX0BPHWS", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I am just an average Joe, so I will relate with most readers.

I agree the sound could be better, but, the $1500 Samsung's sound was week too.  The sales person said they are all designed to add a sound system too, it is the drawback of the small size.Don't hesitate to buy this TV, also know that Vizio is an American owned company (a nice perk).Just a fast update.  1 year in and it is still fantastic.

The t.v. ,eh,t.v. is an insult! This marvel of modern day science / gift from the gods over at Vizio only weighs 31 lbs!! My old plasma weighed 89lbs!!!!! Mind you, I haven't really heard of Vizio, I figured it was some cheap ,generic,no name store brand and never paid it much mind. I was out and not looking for a t.v. and I saw it on display. The price drew me immediately becuz of the size, resolution, and hdtv 3D! It boasts 120 hz reso speed , this friggin beast out performs my TOSHIBA  which was about double the cost and a half!The 3D cant be beat! And they don't tell you this in the book, they say you need the 3d blu ray player to try it out or a ps3 with 3d hdmi cables...the cables you need but if you rent movies in 3d off of vudu and soon to be announced, netflix, you dont need a blueray player! Unless you collect movies and want to have the boxes laying around, thats another story. Besides ,you can buy the 3d flix on vudu and always save them and you can stream it directly to your tv without the bluray player or the bluray 3d dvd. The app features are a blast and once you hook up net flix to your tv you can get it immediately on your fone or ipad as well! You have facebook and the remote flips over and has a full QWERTY keyboard that rivals the best flipfones that we all had and it's about scale also! So u can get your text fix on.

My family could not be happier. This is a great TV and a great buy. My criteria were: 40-42 inch, 1080p resolution, 120Hz refresh rate, access to online streaming meadia (either through the TV directly or ROKU), under $600 and, of course, excellent picture quality. I was not looking for a 3D HDTV, nor was Vizio on my early radar. In what seemed liked my unending daily scouring of both online and brick-and-mortar sellers for a good deal, I came upon the Vizio E3D420VX at BJ's for $579. After reading reviews on Amazon, BJ's, Consumer Reports, CNET and other websites, I decided to go with it. I'm glad I did.Highs:-Setup was a snap using the easy to follow onscreen prompts.-We do not subscribe to cable or satellite; the tuner quickly scanned for and found 16 over-the-air TV stations and 1 audio-only station. I did not know there were this many available in our area. Our old TV, a Samsung, pulled in only 8.-The TV is in our family room, which is not the best room in our house for our wi-fi signal (DSL), yet the TV had no problems connecting to our wireless network, and then connecting to Netflix and Vudu. We were amazed.-Picture quality is outstanding in SD, HD and HDX.-Super-wide viewing angle. We see no loss of contrast when viewing the picture from angles in our room.-Non-glare screen.-The quality of streaming HDTV and SD content from Netflix and Vudu has been superb. We have had no issues with buffering or synching of video with audio.-Sound is pretty good out of the box. Speakers are front-facing and mounted along the bottom of the display, much as a soundbar would be. We do have the set connected to our stereo system.-Passive 3D is a bonus for when more 3D media becomes available. It looked great in the store.-QWERTY keypad on the remote.-Sturdy stand.Lows:-None to speak of, but if you want a couple:-Like all remotes, a new one takes some getting used to and not all of the controls are intuitive. Nor is there a backlight.-The stand does not swivel, but this isn't a concern for our setup.In sum, for the features, quality and price, you'd be hard-pressed to find a better deal - providing you can get it for around the price we did at BJ's.

Kalicharan", "ReviewID": "R2QNKPSTALDTC6", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "What else can I say, this TV is absolutely amazing. There are just so many more pros than cons  I won't even bother making a list. I'll just ramble on and on about how awesome this TV is.Don't get me wrong, it's awesome for my use in a bed room but if you've got a 24 by 24 room or larger you may want to consider something a little bit bigger, I would assume anyway. In any case on to more rambling.I've had this TV for a few months now you'd swear it was an led backlit TV, but it's not. I owned a 37inch Sceptre prior to the Vizio. The Sceptre worked well but it was much thicker, heavier, and gave off a LOT more heat than any other TV I had owned, more specifically the Vizio. The Vizio was also so much more lighter then my previous television which was a huge pro for me since I had it wall mounted.There is one feature that this television had that made me a bit, for lack of a better work, meh. It can adjust its brightness based on the environment. For example, if you were sitting in the room at around midnight in complete darkness, the TV would actually start to dim regardless of what mode you set it in. Don't get confused now with what I just said, I'm just speaking about the backlight brightness. If you set it into sports or vivid mode; the contrast, sharpness, and etc would stay the same its just the brightness of the backlight would either dim or get brighter depending on how much light you have in the environment. At first I thought my TV was done and borked but no, this feature is automatically turned on by default and can be turned on and off depending on your preference.As far as movies and entertainment goes; this TV is, once again, amazing! Keep in mind this is passive cinema 3D, the type used in most small movie theaters with the polarized glasses. That being said the 3D glasses you get at the theater work well with this TV. I've tested the 3D out on a homemade SBS 3D DVD. It actually looked pretty dang good! I could only imagine how a 3D bluray must look. As for gaming, I was playing Stardust HD in 3D and it was mind blowing. In terms of 3D and viewing angles, this is passive 3D and optimal viewing is achieved smack dab right in front of the TV. I moved around to the sides of the TV and you know what, at about 8 to 10 feet back at side angles the 3D effect is still there with very minimal, if any, distortion. Of course it looks much better if you're facing the TV directly but even if you moved the sides at an angle it doesn't look all that bad.Don't expect much for sound, I knew this during my search for a new TV and had my 7.1 sound setup prior to purchasing this TV. So for a couple of weeks I was stuck listening to 1010 WINS through 7 speakers until I could pony of the cash for the TV. During that time I was able to catch the TV on sale from Amazon.The remote is pretty neat. It's got your standard buttons on the front but when you flip it over its a full QWERTY keyboard.I haven't tried out the APPs on it yet mainly because I really only watch Netflix and my PS3 is setup with that already. I may give Hulu a shot tonight who knows.Bottom line is it's a great TV for what you pay for. Its full HD 1080p, 120hz, 3 HDMIs (not a problem if you're using a receiver), and more. If you've got a little extra in your budget, you may want to check out some of the other TVs out there, but when it's on sale, for its price and features you just can't go wrong.", "Date": "November 7, 2011"}, {"Title": "Just Perfect!", "Author": "Arun Nair", "ReviewID": "R3J7F9SNNZZWZH", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "After looking around for over a year, reading 100s of reviews, going to Best Buy, CostCo, Fry's etc etc to see various TVs, I finally bought this awesome TV from amazon a few weeks ago.  Let me just say that I am more than happy.  Lot of people still think Vizio TVs are not in the same category of an LG or Panasonic when it comes to picture quality.  But after seeing all those other TVs in various stores, I can confidently say that this TV is as good as or better than those more expensive brands.The setup was super easy.  Once you plug it in and power it on, it has a easy setup wizard similar to computer program installs.  It asked me for all the network information step-by-step (for the built in wifi to connect to internet) and some other questions and I was good to go!  The TV comes with 2 pairs of 3D glasses (passive, no batteries needed and very light) which are wide enough to fit over my prescription glasses.  After checking out various HD channels for picture quality, I decided to try my PS3.  Popped in COD game and to my surprise, I got a prompt on the TV asking if I wanted to switch to 3D mode!! I didn't even know Call of Duty had 3D option/support. The 3D effects were a good addition to the game play, but it was nothing that made go wow.  However, I later read reviews online that said COD doesn't have the best 3D effects and I really need to watch a 3D blue ray movie to really see the full effects.As you have seen from the specs, this TV has a lot of internet widgets/apps built in and you can download more.  I like the Netflix App on this TV much better than the one in my PS3.  Also, the remote control has a full keyboard on the reverse side, which makes it much more easy to use than those on-screen keyboard.  I have an Onkyo home theater system, to which all my audio/video inputs come in (ps3, cable box etc) and then a single output to the Vizio TV. This TV support Audio Return over HDMI.  This means that when you are watching movies, shows etc via the built in apps, the audio from TV can flow back to your receiver via the same HDMI cable that normally brings data in and hear it through your HT system (your receiver also has to support this).  The TV also supports CEC (consumer electronics control) over HDMI.  So you can set your connected HDMI receivers to turn on or off with the TV.  Just make sure you purchase the latest HDMI cable (version 1.4, available on Amazon for about $8), to support all these features and more!All in all, I am very happy with this purchase so far.

If you can afford a little more though you should check out  this vizio 42\" it uses LED which provides a much better picture (my other vizio is a razor LED) and also it uses true 3d (the active shutter glasses) were this tv uses the polorized passive which ends up dividing your HD signal in half. Having said all that, I purchased this TV for my upstairs living room, I didnt want to spend to much but still wanted the built in streaming options and at least some type of 3D. The 3D is pretty good, it seems like many people cant seem to tell between hd and a high quality digital signal and you can use either vizios glasses or the real3d glasses you can pick up at the theater (so easy and cheap for friends when they come over). The internet applications are an area where vizio excels at (say what you want about anything else) and this tv delivers with over 150 different Internet widgets you can select and download, from weather forcast, news, streaming online content and of course the big players netflix amazon and vudu have there own dedicated buttons on the remote control. Sound is adequate for most applications as well. Overall this has been a good purchase and shouldnt regret it. I'm getting the vizio warrenty for a few years just to be sure it will last.

I decided that I would look for a good 3D TV for an even better price. I realize it is not something I would use everyday, but I figured I would enjoy playing some 3D Blu-Rays and playing some PS3 games in 3D. I had really been looking at the Panasonic TVs, their 3D is really excellent. I've found that the Sony brand of 3D TVs was really hurting my eyes when watching. Panasonic didn't do that. Then I came across this Vizio TV and decided to give it a try.PriceThe price on this TV was pretty good. It was about $150 cheaper than the same Panasonic TV I was looking at, and that is before adding the price of the active shutter 3D glasses that Panasonic needs. The Vizio brand passive 3D glasses are cheap on Amazon, or you can just use all those 3D glasses you've not turned in after a movie.QualitySo far I'm really impressed with this TV. It compares well to my friends 3D Sony Bravia, which is a little higher quality in picture. The Sony TVs are also much more expensive, and his does not have the wifi and internet apps that this Vizio has. Someone had posted about the quality of the stand that the TV uses. They had said it was poor and wobbly. I don't find it to be wobbly at all, I actually think it is quite sturdy. Someone else complained about the onboard speakers, saying they weren't loud enough. I find that they are pretty good for built in speakers. Many of the TVs out there don't have amazing speaker quality, that is what surround sound is for. The speakers are just fine.3DI will say that I was blown away by the 3D. I really wasn't too sure what to expect, as I had not seen a demo of Vizio 3D before. I was a little weary because LG uses passive 3D glasses, and they did not impress me very much. Vizio seemed to do it right though. After many days and nights of playing on my buddy's Sony Bravia I can say that I prefer the 3D on this TV over his. While watching Tron and Alice in Wonderland in 3D on his Sony I noticed a lot of ghosting. I don't know if the batteries in his glasses needed to be changed, or we weren't quite at the right viewing angle. Those same movies on the Vizio have much less ghosting than on the Bravia. So far we've watched Tron, Alice and Tangled, all in 3D, and really enjoyed it. I've also played Killzone 3, COD: Black Ops and Gran Turismo 5. They all look really good in 3D, especially GT5.Pros:3D looks greatHD Looks greatPassive glasses seem to cause lest ghosting (and are MUCH cheaper)Remote control is awesomeCons:TV turns on kind of slowlyCome with that video smoothing turned on, which annoyed me to no end right away (now turned off and working great)Basically, if you're in the market for a 3D TV but don't want to spend too much money that Vizio is an amazing TV. I usually find myself very picky about the quality of video I am watching (much to my fiances irritation) and I haven't had one thing to complain about on here.

Not a dealbreaker, but noticeably laggier than my other LCD monitorsPicture quality is more than adequate, viewing angles are good (no inverted colors from off-angle). Streaming apps Netflix/Amazon/Vudu all play smoothly, Amazon Prime gets you free streaming video, but I mostly just use Netflix and occasionally the Weather app. 3D has \"just worked\" with every source I've tried: Vudu app, TimeWarner Cable on demand, Boxee Box, VLC via a DVI-HDMI cable all worked without any hassle, you just press 3D on the remote and choose 'side-by-side' or 'over-under'. I have no reason to believe 3D Blu-Ray content via HDMI 1.4 wouldn't also 'just work'.In addition to the  two included Vizio pairs (one value, one Vizio Theater 3D) Movie theatre glasses (RealD) work just fine.  I've even used  LG clip on 3D Glasses although I feel super dorky wearing them.  3D viewing angle is quite good, somewhere in the ballpark of 100degrees, not as good as the horizontal viewing angle for normal content (178deg) but even the worst seat in the house can always see 3D just fine.Other notes:* The Vizio logo on this TV does not glow (thank god).  You can even disable the small power-on light via the settings if you're a super-minimalist.* The remote is not a universal remote; where device selection buttons would normally be, Vizio chose to place dedicated app buttons (Vudu, Netflix, Amazon).

It looks great, it handles everything I've thrown at it INCLUDING rendering a 3d signal from my ps3 with an HDMI 1.3 cable. The fact of the matter is, the PS3 doesn't even have an HDMI 1.4 compatible port. No model of the PS3 does. Sony has made sending a 3d signal over HDMI 1.3 hardware possible by putting the rendering weight on the cell processor itself. That said, I've played Super Stardust HD in 3D, Wipeout HD in 3D, Mortal Kombat in 3D, and Killzone 3 in 3D. Wipeout looks even crazier with the 3D enabled, it's not distracting but it does make itself very apparent. It looks great, the vehicles stand out very well from the environments. Super Stardust HD doesn't make a huge use of 3D outside of the menus. The menus look great, though. Mortal Kombat doesn't apply any 3D effect to the characters on screen, but it does separate them from the background by focusing all of the effect on the backgrounds. The Haunted Woods stage stands out the most. It looks very good with the added depth. Killzone 3 looks neat with the 3D effect, but it is actually pretty distracting. It was easy to miss the damage indication from the corners of the screen turning red, too. I prefer playing Killzone 3 with the 3D off, but it's worth looking at once or twice.For those worried, I have noticed no input lag while playing games. I made sure to turn off Film Mode beforehand, though. I play fighting games regularly and I've noticed no difference from my 1ms monitor.

The tv has a better 3d effect than the movie did!32\" is huge for a bedroom, you don't want to go any larger because the image quality will start to degrade. 32\" is when 1080p really starts to make a noticeable difference from across the room.Pros:Best sounds I've ever heard from a tv.volume actually makes a difference with every single tick mark, you don't need to scroll through 20 ticks before it gets louder like some tv's. The audio is rich and full, much better than any hdtv i'v had, including smaller vizio models without the \"sound bar.\" The sound is balanced, and not tinny at all.The picture is great, I recommend going online with the tv (i used my ps3) and finding a monitor calibration tool. It helps achieve a perfect balance of contrast, black level and color level. It also helps set the sharpness which has always been a tv setting that is hard to set on the fly.2d images are crisp with no artifacts of the 3d polarization, even though the image is clearly always polarized, put the glasses on and  get really close to the screen, you'll notice the lines even on standard tv.3d is great. You only get 1/2 resolution, but you truly don't notice any reduction as far as textures go. The only real downside is on sub pixel lines. If a line, most noticeable a black line, is only 1 pixel wide and completely horizontal, only one eye can see it. An example is the white lines on the ps3 controller menu. the lines almost seem to glow as you see them with one eye, and not the other. There is minor ghosting, but i've never seen a form of 3d that doesn't suffer from that. it happens in the theater, it happens on active and passive and even on the 3ds. For some reason you can see a very feint duplicate image offset to the left or right. that's ghosting. it's most noticeable  in areas of super high contrast, like a white object on black.  It's not a con of the tv, just a negative effect of 3d in general. I only notice it on the powerups in super stardust HD and in the rafters of a stadium in mlb 2011.They recommend 6 feet from the screen, I agree, the image is definitely best at that distance when using 3d. at 5-6 feet you can't see any 'blinds\" effect from the passive 3d.The apps are of no use to me, but a cool addition.Cons:Boot-up time is slow, but it's a TV not an epi pen. I think you can survive 10 of fifteen seconds because you get to watch 3D AT HOME!!!The tv has a slightly slow response time. Not like the psp, which you may recall has an image blurring effect during motion. Instead when something vibrant moves you might notice a slight shadow of the opposite color. You can't see it on films, sometimes i notice it watching the Simpsons if i really look for it. Also if you are playing assassins creed and you rotate the camera you can sometimes notice this effect at the very edge of a building. No ones noticed it but me..so maybe it's just my eyes!The remote control receiver doesn't work so well with the plastic over it. I keep the plastic on the tv as long as possible cause its glossy and will get super dusty.Overall it's better than theater quality 3d, in your home, for 500 and i think it's a must buy.later this year, SONY will release a PlayStation branded 3d tv. It's 24 inches. requires 70 dollar glasses but allows you to play local co-op without split screen.Two players each see a full screen image by wearing the 3d glasses.Sony's new tv will come with an HDMI, one pair glasses, and a free game, resistance 3 i believe. it's going to cost 500. If size isn't a big deal for you, and you can afford the extra pair of glasses, id wait for that deal.If you want a bigger screen and glasses that are basically free,  this tv is the one to get.", "Date": "June 8, 2011"}, {"Title": "42\" inch - 8 Days to Return/Refund.

Mins-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Update: 1st/Sept/2012Just got to upload a short clip, (no audio) on this device's long start up process, straight down to the light bleed that takes places on any bright/whitebackground image display. I've also upload photos with notes to better help describe my experience, and as it stands, I'm now sending pictures to the companyabout the malfunctions, so that I can ship it back for a refund, bare in mind I'm living overseas, so this may be a hassle to ship this 30lbs+ tv.. sheesh. stay tuned-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Let me first say that on receiving and unwrapping this device on the 22/Aug/12 that I at first glance was immediately blown away by the size, shape, stereo set (which is at the bottom of the device) and the refresh rate of the tv, which is 120hz. Day one was a solid experience upgrading from my old 32\" Panasonic 60hz refresh rate, hd tv, and man was I blown away just by the size of that thing.But on the following day, i began to check out all the promised features of this device in both 3d and 2d, and the first thing i noticed when I went online using my Playstation 3 web browser; was this very heavy horizontal dark shade stretching across the bottom half of the screen, On any white background imaging, you'll notice a shade of black running straight across the screen.Honestly this was a small price to pay for the fact that I just had gotten a Like New, 42\" hd 120hz refresh rate, 3d (best viewed playing Killzone 3), smart tv, (which i used my ethernet line to try out the features with), so I said I'll just get use to the blur at the bottom half..but to make matters worst, not only does it take long to start up, when the device did, and I'm assuming that this may be a possible flaw for refurbished and mostly used models of this device, that there was a very and i mean very annoying thin black vertical line stretching right down the screen looking like this, but only this is horizontal ---------------------------------------------, this happend to me on the 3rd day of using my tv, it first started to come on for about 3 -5mins then it disappeared, but then on the 8th day, which is the current day of my review letter, that ugly, unattractive, and discouraging vertical line stayed on my screen all the hours I watched tv, played game, changed the settings back to factory, went to NO Signal setting, it just stayed there,Truth be told, I tried to just keep my cool about this tv, because I really do like and appreciate the functionality and features it presents to movie lovers, and game players, but in my opinion this model isn't manufactured properly and stands the risk of becoming defectively way before your return/refund deadlines pass.I\"m currently trying to get a return, and possible refund on this item, because I love the fact that its a 3d tv, thats a big plus, but honestly i'm not watching 3d or playing 3d around the clock like i'm enjoying 2d, and the smart tv function, I mean its cool too, but my ps3 can do most of that stuff... Right now I\"m just going to go browse for a regular 2d, 42\" - 55\" hd tv with 120hz+ refresh rate function around this same price. When I update this review, I'm hoping to add that video clip I took of this tv's worst possible defectiveness. I really think, that besides all the good reviews and high ratings that ppl can still be warned that this tv is not guaranteed to outlast other hd models.", "Date": "August 30, 2012"}, {"Title": "Awsome!

The 3D is amazing(watching Tangled with my daughter right now) and the glasses do not need any charging or batteries. The wifi is my favorite part. With just one touch on the remote(which has a keyboard on the bottom side of it) and your watching a movie or listening to Pandora which is pretty cool especially if you have surround sound. The HD is great but side by side next to my Samsung it is just right below it. Which is why I didn't give it 5 stars(i would of given it 4 3/4 if that was an option).

The 3D quality is awesome. I've played some games and I've had no issues with the 3D. It came with two glasses which is awesome and the movie theater 3D glasses work with it as well. I've also used dual play on my PS3 playing COD Black Ops 2, which had a little bit of ghosting on the TV (I could see a little of the other \"screen\" through my glasses) but it wasn't bad and I believe it was partly due to the game, not the TV. The TV without 3D is fantastic as well. You can adjust how much the screen zooms in on a show on regular cable in order to fill the screen if you want. Netflix and other apps can be loaded onto the TV, and Netflix works great. My whole family couldn't believe how real and Hi-Def Netflix looked. It takes a few seconds to a minute for the picture to become Hi-Def, but that's going to happen with anything.

There isn't another TV that is going to offer the pure feature set this Vizio offers.  This TV has a 1080p resolution, something still surprisingly not standard on a lot of budget 32 inchers.. 3D & Wi-Fi enabled apps.. it's quite a package, but naturally if the picture quality doesn't add up is it worth it?I'm glad to say the picture quality lives up, it's good with the major exception of ghosting. My previous two HDTV sets was a 05 Samsung 61\" DLP and for the past 3 years a  Samsung 55\" 3D Plasma..  There is quite a bit of odd ghosting when it comes to watching sports, especially when the camera pans quickly. You see the bounce of pixels/outline.. it's most noticeable in hockey and football.. I can't say I see it in basketball or soccer.  I don't really notice it in normal television or movies. I've tried fiddling with settings including turning game mode on, turning sharpness off, 720p vs 1080i  but not a lot help. It's not massive, but if you do plan to watch a lot of sports in particular football and hockey, I'd think about seeing this in person or getting a different set.  (Note it's not my source, I've actually changed from Cable to DirecTV in the ownership span and it's still there)The overall PQ though outside of the ghosting is pretty nice, it takes some fiddling though. If you check CNET they have some calibrated settings for the 42 and they seem to translate decently if you don't have a calibration disk.  First and foremost I would turn off the ambient light and DCR, they aggressively turn down the backlight and it makes the picture look really dank.  The picture quality when calibrated is really nice, colors seem accurate, sharpness even with the sharpness off is pretty nice, and the contrast is pretty nice.Game mode helps a lot with lag, I hooked my PC up and noticed my mouse had a noticeable lag and felt \"heavy\" due to it.. turning on game mode basically put it into unnoticeable. It makes gaming quite nice.3D is nice, but it should be noted that it has a really small viewing distance and has to be seen head on.. this isn't much of a problem on a 32\" set considering that's the ordinary size for a bedroom or small room. If you're using it as a family room, I'd look for another set with better 3D viewing angles.I've mainly only used Netflix as the apps, and it works just as it should.  It's smooth, fast, and nice over Wi-Fi. It's really nice to have some of the apps built in rather then on a somewhat loud and power hungry game console, and it also saves the purchase of a Roku or similar streaming device (albeit with less options).  It should be noted it takes about 25 seconds for the TV to actually boot up and show a picture source.  It's not really a big deal, but it's noticeable.Overall, I'm happy with my purchase, the ghosting is the only major sticking point for me but I'm sure I'll largely get used to it.  I've contacted Vizio to see if there are any solutions, I know that some LCDs for computers have something called \"overdrive\" that tend to cause that black outline I mentioned earlier.  It's possible the Vizio has the same thing and maybe there is a way to turn it off.. who knows.For $298, you get a 32\" 3D 1080p Wi-Fi enabled TV that has nice picture quality and a lot of settings to tweak it as you feel right.  You really can't beat that value because the same feature set would typically cost you  into the $600 range with Samsung & LG. It's a good value and it really shows how Vizio is the king of it.  There are a few drawbacks to it, but overall I'm happy with it and recommend it.UPDATE: After using it for a few more days and as hockey season ramps up, I've really gotta go ahead and dock this another star.. the ghosting makes watching hockey a bit of a nightmare. There is just so much of it.. everywhere you go it's black lines around players, the only thing I can think of is that they are using some really hard OD to get regular blurring out and it's just ridiculously distracting. I'm now considering putting it up on craigslist and getting a different set, it's a shame they don't make smaller 1080p Plasma's.", "Date": "January 23, 2013"}, {"Title": "Waited to rate this until I have viewed it for a few months...and here it is.", "Author": "Silverclone1", "ReviewID": "RFHN8I7O6MPXR", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I did the research, investigated the reviews, and found myself with an excellent television.

I've seen some reviewer's complain about the \"normal\" 2D picture, I'm not really sure what they're seeing but in hi-def with the correct high speed HDMI cables and settings this LCD has a stunning picture. I've come from many LCD's, last being a 42\" Toshiba 720p which has a great picture, and this Vizio beats that TV's picture quality in HD hands down. I've also seen someone mention here in one of their reviews, that it's almost like being there when watching a program in HD, the easiest way for me to describe that is how my son describes it, \" it's like your looking through the cameras filming it yourself\", it's that surreal on certain HD programs, and that's only 2D hi-def pictures.Now on to 3D, which will blow your mind when you first pop in a bluray 3D movie. The day we received this Vizio unit, my wife and I watched some demo in 3D and we just smiled without even saying a word to each other. Seeing flame embers, water droplet's, spears etc. filling up your living room is quite the experience.The sound is not bad but not great either. I think it falls pretty much inline with any other LCD in this category. Your not going to get that \"boomy\", expansive sound field that you will have with an home theater system. It's going to sound like any another TV when using the speakers, \"tinny\" and lacking any real depth at all. Granted there are some audio settings to change it up a bit and to add different elements to the TV sound, but if you want that depth and deep bass to draw you into the experience then a surround sound system is needed.Goes without saying that personally, I have very high marks for this TV and I think for the money your spending this rival's much higher priced 3D LCD's.

It is basically a 47\" tv. it was advertised wrong for some time & i hope they have fixed that part of the ad.it sounds good for a tv sound system , the hd picture is good also when hd is available. it was easy to set up including the wireless , there is a base that holds the tv nicely on a horizontal surface or you can buy a mount & hang it. buttons to turn it on without the remote are on the L side, the lower L corner is where you aim the remote.

I'm not an \"HD junky\" and before this tv we owned a 32 inch, 720p unit.  These are simple comparisons and observations.First off, I love the picture.  I didn't think it would really be \"that different\", but I was wrong.  Sharp is probably the best word to describe the picture.  As I'm watching Thor, Blacks are Black. Reds are vibrant. The clarity really is impressive.I know there were some reviews with sound quality being poor.  Eh... with two small children running around, I'm able to turn it up and hear the movie over the kids.  It's set on 47 and is only around half way.  Most of the time it's set to around 25.  Could it have richer sound? Sure.  but I'm happy it's not as bad as others have said.The \"Internet apps\"... Amazing!  We've always used our Xbox for Netflixs and hands down the Netflix app is Much faster.  It also has a good format for scrolling through the movies and picking out shows.  It also has Hulu, Vudu, Amazon, and Youtube, as well as some others.Several reviews discuss how slow the bootup time is.  I don't think it's that bad.  People are saying it's a minute, but It's less that that by far.  We live in an age of Instant gratification, so 30 seconds seems unreasonable... but it's really not that bad.The remote has a ton of bad reviews, so I'll be reserved in my opinions on it.  I will say, you don't have to \"stand\" on it to make the buttons work, but if you firmly push and hold it for half a second, it registers each character every time.  It's all in the timing, and slowing down a fraction of a second makes all the difference.There is glare as our tv is directly across from a window.  This is annoying in dark scenes, but not entirely the TV's fault.  We just don't have a lot of placement options in our house.Again, as I watch Thor, Colors are awesome and bright.  This is Thor streamed from Netflix, not from a bluray or dvd and it's still Impressive!Vizio has provided a quality product and it's worth the money.Oh, one last thing.  We don't have a 3D capable device, but YouTube has 3D content, and the passive glasses work like a charm.  Fun and exiciting for sure.  The plan is to pickup a PS3 and take full advantage of it, but I don't have a lot of exerience with the 3D as of yet.  As a 2D tv, worth the money!  the 3D is an added bonus for sure!8/12/2012 updateI'm very excited that the TV supports DLNA.  In short, I can stream movies from my Android tablet directly to this TV.  You will need an android app from the market to complete this, but it's super easy.  I do not promote any specific app, but for the technically challenged I used iMediashare.  It works well, but not all formats show up (BluRay specifically).  The idea is, you can stream pictures, movies, and music from your phones or tablets directly to the tv with no wires/cables.  We are watching a movie as I type this, which is an advantage for sure.  You're not dedicating your device to the movie.  You can enjoy streaming content on the TV and surf the web, check email, and play games.super cool!", "Date": "August 11, 2012"}, {"Title": "VIZIO Hits A Home Run", "Author": "Christopher Robert Mohr", "ReviewID": "R1FM1FYHLXTKK0", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I just received the Blu- Ray 3D copy of The Avengers two days ago and watched the 3D feature disc yesterday.I was kinda disappointed in the much too long two and one half hour film and confused by the way they acheived the 3D effect.On October 12 I expect to receive the Alfred Hitchcock 1954 3D film \" Dial M For Murder\".  In those days 3D films were shot with twocameras, one for the left eye and one for the right eye.  The two views were then projected with a slight overlap through polaroid filters onto asilver coated screen that would retain the polarization. The polaroid glasses the audience wore separated the left and right views.  Simple, but very effective.Apparently, \"The Avengers\" was not shot that way.When I viewed the film without the glasses a close up of anyone seemed to be a 2D image with the background blurred into two images thatproduced some 3D effect, but still remained almost impossible to fuse even with the glasses so it remained a double image.  Today they referto that as ghosting I believe.  There was quite a bit of that in \"The Avengers\".When I receive my copy of \"Dial M For Murder\" I can only hope it was processed the \"old fashioned\" way and not mucked up with someone'sidea of improved digital processing.NOW, having said that, could my disappointment be due to a defect in my 42 inch VIZIO 3D HDTV?  I will greatly appreciate it if someonewould comment on this if they know how I can improve my 3D viewing.I have been shooting stereo slides with the same Stereo Realist camera since 1952.  I have been waiting sixtyyears for 3D to be completely accepted and now that it is coming to pass I cannot go to see a 3D moviebecause my arthritis will not allow me to sit in one position for more than fifteen minutes or so.The next best thing is 3D at home, but what 3D HDTV to choose.  After some consideration and research Ichose the VIZIO 42 inch Class Theater because I can well remember using polaroid glasses to see films like,The House Of Wax\", \"Dial M For Murder\", Kiss Me Kate\" and John Wayne in \"Hondo\".  Contrary to a lot ofmisinformed reviewers these films were NOT viewed through cardboard red and blue cellophane filters.  I alsochose the polaroid glasses over the active shutter glasses because I have a shutter glasses system from someyears ago that only works with a Cathode Ray Tube television set.  They are bulky and do not fit well over myregular glasses.  And then there's the batteries.The VIZIO 3D HDTV is just about the most TV technology you can get for $548.00.  In conjuction with myVIZIO Wireless Router I can watch all the Netflix streaming instant movies I can stand.  The 2D picture isexcellent and although people complain about a backlight washing out the blacks, the black level on this TV ispretty close to what you would expect from a plasma set.I cannot fairly comment on the 3D picture because I have no 3D Blu Ray discs as of yet and that's thestandard on which I will judge the 3D picture.  I have preordered \"The Avengers\" and \"Dial M for Murder\"which I will get in October and if I am really impressed with the 3D image I will update this review.There have been complaints about the built in sound system having low volume and poor sound reproduction, butthose complainants must have received defective units.  I could not believe the quality of sound and stereoeffectiveness of this built in sound system.  I have a good quality surround system, but I have yet to hook it upbecause I am really satisfied with the sound as it is.If you want to go the polaroid glasses route, seriously consider this VIZIO 3D HDTV.It has been about five months since I have written the above review and I feel that I may now comment on the 3D performance of this excellent television set.I had trouble at first since my viewing angle was slightly off.  To get a good 3D picture you must NOT be looking up at, or down on the face of the TV.  You must be viewing thescreen straight on.  I wrongly jumped to the conclusion that the Blu-ray transfers were at fault and that, for that reason, the screen image exhibited ghosting and double images.However, once the proper viewing angle is established, the three dimensional image is perfect.There has been some criticism that scan lines can be seen on images produced with the passive system of 3D presentation.  There are NO visible scan lines associated with my 3Dimages.  Nor is there any ghosting or double images whatsoever.  My conclusion is that if you will seriously evaluate point for point the Active system against the Passive systemyou will find that the Passive system is much cheaper, brighter and completely flicker free.  A big bonus for me is that by using my $6.00 pair of clip-on polaroid glasses it isas if I were wearing only my regular glasses, which I would be wearing anyway to watch TV.", "Date": "August 10, 2012"}, {"Title": "Great TV - Take Time To Set It Up! - UPDATED 07/28/2012", "Author": "S. Epstein", "ReviewID": "R32MHMS5AK1KY3", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I have above average experience and knowledge about A/V equipment - mostly in the mid-range consumer realm - [not the audiophile range].This is a lot of TV for the money! TAKE TIME TO SET IT UP! [sorry I shouted] - you can resolve most of the issues noted in other reviews if you will tweak the picture settings. The back-light is bright, but proper set-up will mitigate this problem. After spending an hour adjusting the picture settings, I watched some of Star Trek TNG remastered Blu-ray, and even the space scenes [stars and planets] looked awesome.  The out-of-the-box settings are OK, but if you will take time to tweak the picture, you may be amazed. I watched a bit of a baseball game the other day [go Rangers!] and the 120Hz really enhanced the moving ball. Concert DVDs and movie DVDs and BRs are also beautiful on this screen. I stream Hulu-Plus TV shows - there is a problem with volume fluctuations, but I believe that is a Hulu issue - not the TV. Netflix works nicely, though there is buffering, even with Cat-5 - probably my ISP's fault as it happens on the other TV as well. WiFi works great, but I ran the Cat-5 just to be sure to get the fastest throughput.Note that you will find several websites with user's settings for this set. Play around with these, but be aware that they are not likely to give you the best picture. I tried several and the output ranged from washed-out, to too much contrast. Every TV set is different, as is every environment and user preference. These websites can help you understand the results of the settings, but you will have to find what works for you. You may even want to purchase a calibration BR or DVD, though I believe these calibrate the set for someone else's [an \"expert's\"] preferences.The set has most every feature one might want: 1080P, 120HZ, 3D, WiFi, Abundant and responsive internet applications, energy efficient, etc...The set does not have a 24P mode, but does a nice job of conversion to 30P.Note:While playing Pandora or Tune-in Radio, I have not found a way to turn off the screen - there are static images with these applications, and the set is lacking an anti-burn-in feature [moving screen, etc...] This may or may not be an issue, depending on which \"experts\" you trust. I don't think it will be a problem with less than full-time use.The online manual does not explain many of the settings options: I had to travel the inter-webs to learn what Backlight Control > \"DCR\" and \"OPC\" meant - these seem to be redundant methods for adapting to the room lighting - there is another setting for \"Ambient Light Sensor\" on or off, but no explanation how these are each different. \"Adaptive Luma\", a method for adjusting the overall brightness to compensate for brighter areas on the screen, is distracting to me, as it takes a second for the processor to respond before the adjustment - I leave that option off.I would like to be able to run my center channel from my 5.1 receiver into the TV [until I get some more speakers], but this does not seem possible, even though there are RCA audio inputs [seems these only work when the input is set to \"Comp/AV\".Please remember how much you are spending for this unit. If I had a larger budget, I'd have bought another Panasonic Plasma set - this TV is not in that arena. I don't think you will find better bang-for-the-buck than this model. I am really enjoying the set, and I don't have a cable box in the room - everything has been DVD, BR, or Streaming.I always learn a lot from these reviews, so I hope this contribution helped you.PS - Just watched Watchmen on Blu-ray - Awesome movie, and it was awesome on this set! The whole movie is a bit dark - the back-light is noticeable, but not distracting in the least [Was daylight, room not dark, but has two windows with drawn blinds].UPDATE 07/28/2012:A few new comments...The description indicates two different pairs of 3D glasses, but the package only included two of the standard style... I don't really know that this is a big deal, as I have read that the nicer pair is not as good for viewing;Hulu Plus does not function well on this unit [runs fine on my other devices]. The stream frequently becomes choppy, even in the lowest quality mode, with a hard-wired internet connection on FIOS, and the menus become unresponsive. Additionally, the volume fluctuates, regularly, from inaudible to normal. I have uninstalled and reinstalled, but this appears to be a buggy application. Hopefully, an update will come along to resolve these issues, as this is the usual method for me to stream content;I think the unit they shipped me may have been \"open box\"... This might explain the condition of the packaging when delivered - pretty torn up - I blamed FedEx, but this might be Amazon's fault. There are signs that the stand was installed at one time, some marks along one side of the screw holes, that cause me to believe this was previously out of the box. Too much trouble to exchange it just now... I'll keep an eye out for other issues, though;Overall, I still very much like this set considering the price, but I cannot compare with my Panasonic Plasma, downstairs.

This is very useful while searching on Amazon, YouTube or while accessing facebook (my main TV is Sony, and I wish it had something like this)- The box that I picked up from local store had a regular remote in it. I went back to the store but they pretty much raised their hands and said I should contact Vizio- Hesitantly, I sent an email to Vizio customer support explaining the problem; in less than two hours I got a response back asking me to call their customer service number- I called and explained the problem. They created a trouble ticket and asked me to send them proof of purchase and photo of my current remote electronically- I sent requested documents, called back ... the person on the other end verified everything I had sent and placed an order to send me new remoteAnd ALL these in less than half a day  - and I already got my new remote today !!!!

Purchased at walmart new for $399 and let me tell you, this is an amazing tv. Alright lets get to it here are my pros and consPROS-1. Great selection of apps as of 2/28/12 over 150 (152 give or take).2. Lots of inputs 3 HDMI, a component and composite as well as audio output on the tv L/R (red/white) and optical outit does not include s-video but it's also 2012 so who cares.3. AMAZING COLOR I'm talking great color tone and absolutely vivid and colorful picture.4. The remote control is awesome with netflix,vudu, and amazon prime buttons on the top and behind it is a full qwerty keyboard.5. LOTS of options to customize picture and backlight very easy to navigate.6. Firmware updates over wifi (which the tv has included) adding new features7. You can name inputs i really like this also settings for each input stay as they are for that input only so every  input can have its own custom picture settings.8. 3D is great the \"drop\" in resolution is barely noticeable if anything all the people bragging about active being better dont have a clue. I have an active 3d viewsonic monitor and ive compared the two and this TV beats itCons-1. Black levels leave something to be desired (when completely dark) although not horrible, i do wish it was a tad better. i wouldn't really say this is a negative because something as simple as a light on in the room can make the black levels better.2. TV does take sometime to boot up but again cant really complain because this is a tv that has apps, 3d, and wifiit obviously has to load all this when it boots up and i also feel like a firmware update could help this3. Crosstalk is noticeable very rarely usually when there is a dark color on top of a bright color or a combination of that. this leads to another problem, that you can't adjust the 3d depth but for the most part its set at just the right depth3D independent reviewIll give the 3d its own separate portion because there's so much to talk about it. If you have a nvidia 3d kit and and obviously and nvidia video card than you can hook this tv up and play all your games in 3d using the passive glasses which is great ( to reduce lag and help performance play at 1280x720 60hz NOT 1920x1080 24hz). The TV has a 3d button on the actual remote which can also \"convert\" if you will 3d movies to 2d if you for some reason wanna do that. Also as of now apps that dont have 3d recognized by the tv cant be put in 3d so for example a side by side youtube video using the youtube app cant be made into 3d by the tv (the button wont work) but if you watch 3d movies from Vudu the 3d knows that you are doing so it changes it automatically. You need to sit at about 6 feet back to feel a good amount of depth and about 10-20 degrees downward from the center of the tv or you will see more crosstalk than usual.I recommend this tv for EVERYONE seriously BUY THIS TV i really dont know how else to put it. If youre in the market for a new TV this should be it period. I have the 32\" model but i would get the bigger models if i couldP.S. this tv is not 120hz only the 42\" and above.", "Date": "February 28, 2012"}, {"Title": "Can't beat this for the price", "Author": "Akshay Joshi \"akkiboy\"", "ReviewID": "R2S9QL94NDV1N2", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Got this TV two days ago and have now setup everything including the wireless feature and 3D blu ray player.Fantastic picture quality, great features and especially for this price.

Just a little history...  I've owned a samsung PN63, that was stolen, and I've sampled two other 3D TVs from Amazon; Samsung pn64 and LG LW6500. Ever since the Sammy was stolen I've been on a mission to find another 3D TV, but I concluded, shortly after trying the PN64, that I would no longer consider active 3D. After trying passive, I just hate active, but I'm not here to compare active vs passive. I've done a bit of that in another review.What I am here to say is that this Vizio is the best passive 3D TV out there currently (maybe with the exception of the LG LW9800 which I have not tried, but considered getting, before I got this one). And for the price, well... its out of this world. I sampled a lot of 3D media (movies/games) on this TV and they've all looked just stunning. I've noticed almost zero ghosting, and I'm one of those folks looking for it. Funny thing about this TV is that with very little ghosting I forget about it and just enjoy the movie.I watched Avatar 3D last night and was sort of comparing the experience with my two-year-ago IMAX theater viewing. I guess its pretty much the same, as you would expect, but I tend to believe the 3D on this TV is better. I've had active 3D sets before as well and I'm completely sold on passive technology... there's less ghosting.I didn't like the remote at first, since its small and has tiny buttons but I've gotten used to it and the full qwerty keyboard is really nice to have. The wireless works great and the network features and apps are nice. I've tried Netflix, Pandora, and Vudu. I don't have a Vudu subscription but I always take advantage of their free movie when I get to try a new device. Most TVs and blu-ray players have Vudu service access pre-installed so even if you are only trying the unit out you might as well watch the free movie! I watched Beauty and the Beast 3D and loved it so much I bought the 3D blu-ray. Sure I've seen the standard 2D movie before, and I'm not really interested in watching it in regular 2D again, but in 3D it is just so cool. Its a whole new experience. I've also used Pandora radio a great deal on this TV and it works fabulously. I did notice that Netflix seems to be a little slower on the TV vs on my PS3; the picture not as sharp at times. I don't know if this has to do with the buffer size or the processing ability of the unit, or if there was just \"network congestion\" when I noticed it. Anyway, may not be a problem with the TV at all.The sound is very full and sufficiently loud with decent low end for an HDTV. The speakers are front projecting (not rear like some TVs) so that helps. So even if you don't have an external sound system I still think you'll be happy.Update 12/7/12: after owning this 42\" Vizio for a year or more and trying several other TVs over the same period I've almost decided to buy the larger 47' Vizio for my  living room.

I first bought the LG 42LV4400 for $529 at BB but happen to be in Target and saw this one on sale for $599.  The LG had LED backlighting and this one has CCFL.  We bought both and compared them at home.  The backlighting technology was tempting on the LG but this TV had network capability and 3D.  The picture on the LG took some adjusting to get right. When we turned on this one the picture blew us away.  One look at the 3D and it was no contest!  The speakers on this TV were miles better than the LG.  I packed up the LG and returned it the next day.The Editor's review on CNET says this TV has a lousy 2D picture but I don't know what was wrong with their set as our set has a great picture.  Don't hesitate to buy this TV it's one of the best in it's price range and better than a good many more expensive sets.  As for CCFL vs LED backlighting  the only difference I can see is that the CCFL is good for 50,000 hours while the LED will last almost indefinitely.  How does that 50,0000 play out well if one watches TV for 6 hours a day it will last for more than 22 years!

We replaced our old VIZIO LCD television and are shocked at how much technology has changed!  This television is so sharp and clear that you feel like the people on the screen are right there with you, more like you're watching a behind the scenes show rather than a movie.  It's definitely taking awhile to get used to.  Xbox games are also much sharper, so that also takes some getting used to.  So far, we've only watched the Lion King in 3D, but it looked just like the theater but on the smaller screen.  I also found that one of my theater glasses is actually more comfortable than the Vizio glasses, so I've been using those instead.  It's so much more convenient to be able to use the RealD 3D glasses rather than having to buy special glasses at an exorbitant price.  I also love that there's a Netflix button on the remote, so I can immediately access my queue.  Since I'd mainly been watching Netflix through Xbox Live, I'm thrilled that I can now watch directly from the TV and don't have to power up the energy-hogging Xbox.  Also, we combined this with a Panasonic DMP-BDT210 3D blu-ray player purchased from Amazon, which comes w/ a rebate for a free copy of Avatar in 3D (which is not available for sale elsewhere), so we're really looking forward to watching that on our new television when it arrives!", "Date": "November 9, 2011"}, {"Title": "Great 3D TV and an Unbelievable Price!", "Author": "Gregory G.", "ReviewID": "R1YY4CL5YXH1KJ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I bought this TV about a month ago because I was interested in getting a 3D TV.

Concerning how it stacks up to other HD TVs I have a Panasonic plasma that I have put side by side to my new Vizio. Panasonic plasmas are renowned for their picture quality, which is why I got it, but honestly the Vizio has just as good of picture quality. A professional may be able to tell the difference but honestly I really can't tell. Plus the price of the Vizio TVs are really good compared to most other manufactures. I feel like Vizio has really formed a name for themselves and I see more and more of them showing up at other houses.If you're looking for a good 3D TV at a great price there really isn't another one right now that is comparable when you consider the price, size and the ability to use inexpensive polarized 3D glasses.Pros - Great Price, picture quality as good as TV brands, cheap passive 3D glasses that don't need recharging, really nice lookingCons - Since Vizio is relatively new the long term reliability isn't really know.

I have to give Amazon credit on this one, as I'm not accustomed to the good kind of shipping surprises when buying online.As the the TV itself, you'll find more depth among the other reviews, so I'll just give me quick opinions.Installation: Hardware and software setup take a few minutes each.  No problems, very straight forward.A list of available wifi access points are displayed for you to choose from or you can opt for built-in ethernet port (cabled).  The wifi receiver is very strong compared to other devices in that same room.Remote: Great range and regardless of what angle I held the remote or where my fingers were around the edges, input was received nicely by the TV.  No frustration.  Of course the qwerty keys are small, but that's pretty obviously a given since it's on a remote.  I had no problems inputting registration email, and the alt key can be kept down to allow multiple symbols and numbers to be entered.  It has colored buttons to instantly jump to Vudu, Netflix, etc.Interface: Very nice menu system.  The widgets bar is responsive, and the main menu for settings is in a box format.  It's intuitive and responsive as well.2D: Quite good by LCD standards.  Not much to say hear, other than the colors are very well, blacks are acceptable so far (haven't calibrated yet, but the blacks look nicer than I'd expected from previous comments).  No ill effects from the 4-8 foot range I'd tried sitting at.Sound:Fine.  I do not understand anyone having an issue with this, given the 32\" size.32\" is not a screen you buy to base a home theatre with 12' viewing distance around.More than ample for a room, and what to expect from two respectable sized built-in speakers in a TV this size.If this were a 60\" TV I might feel differently, but for a room, it's fine for standard speakers.3D: I've thus far only tried HBO's OnDemand 3D movies.  Avatar opening few minutes (a bit weak in depth IMO), and How to Train Your Dragon (very good 3d).  The included glasses and Real3D glasses I got for dirt cheap on ebay all worked well.  No ghosting was present.The Horizontal angles were liberal, as the room I have it in currently as  chair in front, and my bed about 45 degrees to the side, and the 3d effect was retained.  The issue with losing 3d is more present when moving your head higher than the screen.  When testing what would be a normal range of view for me and a few others, it passed the test.One annoyance is that for my cable box, 3d mode remained on, after I went back to 2d content.  I thought the set actively checked for 3d and reverted to 2d automatically.  This might be my cable box.I have not yet had time to compare 3d vs 2d for loss of noticeable detail, nor have I connected my PS3 yet, but that stuff's all been covered very well and at length by other users.Overall, I highly recommend this TV if the size and features match your needs, regardless of budget.", "Date": "October 7, 2011"}, {"Title": "AWESOME!", "Author": "bayoubelle", "ReviewID": "R3AMF9ROAM1ALG", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I still can't believe I got this awesome TV for the price I paid!

Motorstorm and Super Stardust HD look amazing in 3D as well as the trailers for UNCHARTED 3. I got this tv for 2 games, Gears of War 3 and Uncharted 3.. but during my testing of the 3d effects with available content, I found myself becoming a fan of the Resistence series, and Crysis 2. This is a great tv and I do not regret this purchase at all. even if the 3d wasnt available..it would still be worth it because of the internet apps and the picture quality alone. This a great Tv. Highly recommend if you want to enjoy the great 3d gaming and movies that are soon to hit this holiday season.", "Date": "September 13, 2011"}, {"Title": "impressed by what i got", "Author": "guyfromage", "ReviewID": "RKVO2A4KFGWNZ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "this is our first hdtv and after doing research i settled on this one (got it from Costco).  going from a 14 yr old tv to this was awesome!  seeing all of the positive reviews it got, seeing it in action at Costco, and the price all led me to this.  i was concerned that because it wasn't an LED LCD tv or plasma that the picture would be subpar.  seeing it at Costco and checking out the viewing angles, the 3D, and the picture quality, all for the price made it a no-brainer.i love having wifi built-in so we can very easily access Netflix and Vudu.  this is the first time we've had either and it makes me glad that we have the cheapest level of cable ($10/month w/ Comcast).3D is very impressive, though the fact that it's 3D wasn't a factor in my purchasing of it.  a friend of mine who has a home theater w/ a hd projector onto a 110\" screen came over to check out the 3D and was shocked at how good it was.  now he's looking into 3D projectors.i do wish the sound was better.  i had to turn it way up when i watched the newest Hulk movie on Vudu.  sometimes you could barely hear the dialogue.like some others have said, the ONE screw that goes into the stand doesn't make me feel all that secure w/ its stability.  i look forward to being able to mount it on a wall in the future.the remote is both good and bad.  sometimes you really need to mash the buttons (especially the Netflix and Vudu buttons), but i like having the qwerty keyboard on it.overall, it's a great buy and i highly recommend it.", "Date": "September 2, 2011"}, {"Title": "Fantastic Entertainment", "Author": "Theo Puckett \"Theo\"", "ReviewID": "R1DLPDDPA8C8D5", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I love this TV.

I had been comparing the active to passive 3D in best buy and I found this to be just as good. Except much cheaper and no charging glasses. I had my friend over who has a active 3D tv to check out mine. He said he liked mine more after watching a 2 hour movie. The active glasses he said gave him a headache after watching anything for more than a hour and half. But after 2 hours from him no headache. I have watched two movies back to back and have experienced no problem with eyes or headache on this Vizio. Now my friend said he is going to buy this TV to watch movies primarily and put his active samsung 3D tv in den. The Vizio apps are only so-so. They weren't a deal breaker for me but wasn't a plus. Really just want a web browser but I haven't found any tv yet able to do that properly anyways. 3 HDMI ports make my life so easy with lack of clutter. The sound from the TV is better than I expected having read so many reviews about all low profile lcd/led/plasma tv over the older tube televisions like I had. I still would recommend some kind of home theatre to get the full effect, but it isn't needed right away. My biggest problem with the Tv is the remote. Sometimes I have to press the button to power on several times before it actually turns on. But besides that no other issues.

The base is a bit flimsy but seems to work just fine.  The picture quality is excellent- and no more burn it like we had with the plasma.  Set up was a snap.  We don't have cable- so hooked up the Blu-Ray player and began checking out Netflix on it. After dealing with macro blocking and burn in with the plasma this was such a joy to watch!  The sound bothers me as it could be better and kind of ruins it... but after adjusting the equalizer and upping the base a bit- it does sound better... not great but tolerable till we purchase a surround sound system.

This TV is phenomenal. For the price, size and features you cannot go wrong...The Theater 3d is quite acccurately what you get at the movies except, brighter (Ie: Better) The widgets (a.k.a apps) are fantastic.(There's dozens of channels in the entertainmet subfolder alone that pays for the TV if you have an internet connection.)The TV can update itself, you can have multiple profiles, it auto detects the best resolution for whatever your input is (PS3 gamers take note you should activate game mode in the settings tab it will only come on when you have the game system running.

But, I think this TV has a lot going for it.I am impressed with:- The cost- LCD is most energy efficient HD TV- I don't see any problems with off-center viewing, though in my den I can't get too far on the side.- I can run all my inputs to the TV (including audio) and run 1 optical audio to my stereo and switching inputs on the TV switches audio too!  This allowed me to get rid of my switching box.- My inputs:  - upscaling DVD player (probably will replace with 3d blu-ray at some point)  via HDMI  - a Roku (now still only needed for the roksbox app ([...]) so I can view video off of my home linux box) via HDMI  - a Wii via Component cable (and RCA stereo audio)- My roku is now mostly obsolete because the TV supports Netflix and Amazon VOD, as well as Vudu- The remote is standard IR, so I could train my existing universal remote easily- The picture quality looks great to me, though I'm coming from an SD, so maybe I'm easily pleased.- My wii was really laggy until I realized I hadn't turned on \"game mode\" for that input, problem solved!  Game mode is a permanent setting you can set per-input.- Does not seem to \"stay on\" when I turn it off... I have it plugged into an ethernet switch and the link light goes off when the TV is off.- I know it isn't perfect, but the passive \"theater\" 3d is great for my house.  I have 4 kids and can afford the theater 3d glasses, enough active shutter 3d glasses would have been as expensive as this whole TV.  We watched \"Tangled 3d\" off of Vudu and really enjoyed it.  3d probably won't be an all-the-time thing, but an occasional treat.- I haven't used the sound at all, but I like that the settings allow me to turn off the TV speakers completely.  (my old tv wouldn't do that and I was always finding the kids had turned it up to compete with my stereo).What could use improvement:- The TV doesn't support DLNA, which I can supposedly use to watch video off of my home network.  I'll likely buy a 3d Blu-ray player that supports it so I can get rid of my Roku.- The Apps are sometimes a bit slow to launch, netflix especially- The inputs are separate from the \"apps\".  So you can be on any input and then turn on an app and it \"overrides\" the input.  I'd almost rather prefer the apps menu was full screen and resided on its own \"input\" to keep the interface cleaner.- Pushing \"exit\" on an app will exit the whole app, which is counter-intuitive if you are coming from a Roku.- There are a variety of display \"modes\", like \"normal\", \"movie\", \"game\", that set things like the color balance, tint, etc.  I wish those could be permanently set per-input- There are a variety of HD settings like smoothing, etc that I don't understand.  I wish those could be set per-input, and also there was a way to reset them to the default.- It has 2 HDMI inputs on the back and 1 on the side.  I kind of wish it had 3 in the back, but once I ditch my Roku and get a blu-ray, I'll have an one left over in the back for the new HD wii, or whatever gaming system I get in the future.Other notes:- I have this standing on my old TV cabinet.  The stand seems fairly stable, but I am worried about the kids knocking it over.  I haven't looked, but I'd like it if the stand had a few holes I could put some bolts through to bolt it to the tv cabinet.- As long as this TV proves itself as reliable, overall I'm very pleased with the purchase and would definitely buy it again (until new technology supersedes it).- I like having apps be first-class on the TV.  Looking at 3d blu-ray players, it's almost like they're setting boxes to run apps, and occasionally play discs (some reviews say their discs skip, but the apps work great).  I don't need another set of apps, but at least if I like how, say, the Netflix app works on the TV vs the player, at least I have a choice.  That being said, I wish there was a Roksbox equivalent app on this TV (I haven't seen it yet) or a DLNA app, so when I get blu-ray I can just focus on getting a good disc player.", "Date": "August 11, 2011"}, {"Title": "Best TV value for the money !!!", "Author": "ampgreen", "ReviewID": "R1TF23X73ZZK5F", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I have bought 3 LCD HDTV sets over the last four years, and this is the best overall value I have found. The 3D effects is excellent, although I only occasionally use it for 3D PS3 videogaming and 3D movies. The built in WiFi internet and internet apps, which are automatically updated by Vizio,  gives me access to my Netflix streaming account as well as numerous internet sites with movies and videos, and even Pandora streaming music for free. No need for a computer or anything else.The 1080 P picture quality is excellent, slightly better than my other two HDTV's . There is a function on this tv that smooths out the framerate for tv shows and movies or streaming video, which some people in my house don't like, but I love. It makes movies look more \"real\", as if they were shot on a digital HD home video camera . It makes everything look so smooth and clean and clear. Kind of like real life, but I think most of us are so accustomed to the usually low framerate of movies that we actually prefer that certain \"unreal\" artsy look that they have. Given your preferences, the smoothing feature can be turned down or even completely off, if you like. About the only gripes I have with this TV are fairly trivial, and not deal breakers.The remote control has a keyboard built onto the back, which is fairly useful when entering text info for netflix and various sites, but the buttons on the remote and keyboard are hard to press and erratic with no feedback. So you find yourself having to press and repress and undo what you have done. A bit annoying, but tolerable. Another minor thing is the TV is very slow about turning on compared to any other tv I have ever had. It is kind of like a computer booting up, it takes about 15 seconds to startup to a tv picture. Probably booting up its own operating system and WiFi connecting, maybe .Overall, Outstanding TV value bang for buck.", "Date": "July 27, 2011"}, {"Title": "Passive 3D TV", "Author": "John Pacheco", "ReviewID": "RNTI2FXJEYLCY", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I bought this from Amazon, refurbed on sale. I was going to get a 40 inch and sell off my 37 inch. When I saw a 42\" 3D for just about a $100 more, I figured why not. It was packed well and looked like it was never used, in fact some of the items were still sealed. Took about 10 days to get it in, but it came and I have been happy with it. It plays Passive 3D just fine. Yes the effects look good and deep, and with the Passive glasses I had no eye fatigue at all. You might notice in some scenes that you are only in 720P status when in 3D, but it is more up to the movies filming quality rather than the tvs quality, that makes the difference. Regular over the air 2D in HD is excellent with the picture as good as any. I don't have cable or a dish, but have over the air tv, 3D/Blu-Ray, and with the internet DSL, I subscribe to Netflix and love it. (Yea, they are going up in price like everything and everyone else, but I will stay with it and maybe just cut out the disk delivery part after this winter.) I would advise to use a wired connection for the DSL with Netflix, because with wireless only it has to rebuffer too often. Might not be the TVs fault, but I didn't have this problem with a wireless Blu-Ray player with Netflix, so I think they have a chip or something that doesn't have a high enough speed or capacity for the thru the air storage.

I've heard rumors of Vizio's having issues but ignored it as my experience has been great.  So it was time for a new TV for a different room and I decided to go Passive 3D with this set.  I received it and was disappointed to have issues out of the box.  When I watched TV in 3D mode there was a very noticeable black bar extending across the screen and major back-light bleeding in 2D and 3D.  It was unbelievably distracting when the scene or game had dark colors on the outer edge and you can see bright white beams bleeding into the picture.  I returned it and received a replacement.  I was pleased that the issues were all gone.I loved the 3D on the replacement set, It looks really good - nice popping images, good color, the glasses are light, and cheap!  However, I wasn't as impressed by the HD non-3D pic.  The contrast and colors weren't as sharp and crisp as my other Vizio.  That is because it didn't have as many features as my other Vizio (Contrast Ratio in thousands not millions, refresh rate of 120 instead of 240, etc.) so fair enough - Traded in some of the Cadillac features for the 3D - I can live with it.  The apps were great - no major complaints and I'm a happy man.Sadly, 32 days later(just beyond the return policy)I turn on the TV and I have the same back light bleed issues as the first TV :(. I called Amazon thinking I'm SOL but their great customer service team made an exception to extend my return policy by a few days - what amazing customer service!  I decided to give up on this model and I opted to try my luck with Vizio's new M3D460SR Razor Edge LED LCD for a few bucks more.  3D as well and better picture specs than this and my first Vizio (which has an AMAZING picture).  I'm hoping to get the best of both worlds on this one - 3D and higher image quality and performance.I only gave it 2 stars because of the two defective sets I received back to back but would have given it a 2.5-3 stars if the TV had no defects.  The lower image quality/performance than other High Defs (including Vizio's own models) in regular 2D mode would've prevented me from rating higher.

I have a 55\" LG 3D LED TV in the living room and wanted a tv that included wifi and smart apps. My biggest concern prior to purchasing this set was the screen size. At 32\", I wondered it it would be big enough to watch enjoyably as well as get a cinematic 3D experience out of it.  Well after doing extensive research in consumer and editor reviews of televisions, I came across this one, which was only a little more expensive than the non-3D set (I bought this 32\" model for $309.99 shipped on Feb 16th, 2013). I read reviews of crosstalk or ghosting with this set, and I can say after watching over 10 3D Blu Ray movies on this tv, that it is minimal and hardly shows up(it's not constantly there, its more during heavy, busy scenes) and does not detract from the overall experience of watching a 3D movie on it. This model does not have the 2D to 3D conversion feature, although you can manually change the picture to 3D SBS -Side by Side, TB -Top & Bottom or Sensio- format used in some dvds. While it will display in 3D, if the source material doesn't have a 3D format, it will show a distorted and unwatchable 3D picture, which can cause a headache. Another configurable option you have is the 3D depth amount. You can determine how deep the 3D effect on screen is viewed.The glasses provided (This came with 2 pairs) are light and comfortable. I've also tried the ones from the movie theater (Real3D) and they are great too.The 2D picture 1080p looks beautiful and I've viewed Blu-Rays, PS3 games and XBOX 360 games on it and it hangs with the the best of any other top name brand model.The audio is as expected, while not terrible, it is clear and loud enough, but you won't be getting a cinematic experience listening through the speakers. So do yourself a favor and connect a soundbar or other external system with a subwoofer to make the most of your viewing pleasure.The media apps work fine, I connected to all of my accounts with my wireless router at home and had no issues with passwords or connections. It has Netflix, Hulu Plus, Amazon Video, YouTube, Yahoo apps, misc video apps, and a 3D video channel that you can subscribe to for 99 cents a month to view 3D video content that ranges from history, travel, cars, food, etc. It changes so you wont be stuck paying 99 cents a month for the same channels and videos.The remote control is light, but does not have backlit keys, making it hard to use in a low light setting. You will no longer be getting a remote with the full keyboard on back, which is disappointing. Don't be fooled by pics showing it comes with it, it used to, but as of April 2012 they stopped packaging that remote with this set. You can buy a remote that has the keyboard on back and it works fine with this model. If you buy a Vizio Blu Ray player with internet apps, it comes packaged with that and you can use that remote for the TV and Blu Ray player.To sum it up, After watching 3D movies on this TV, I felt I had a true 3D Theater experience that holds it own in the 3D TV market and for the price and performance/features you get, this TV is a must buy!", "Date": "February 28, 2013"}, {"Title": "Awesome TV!!", "Author": "Barcheck55", "ReviewID": "R1QG3Z7M88UVGL", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I had needed a new TV and I did a lot of searching  for a great TV, that had it all, along with being dependable.

The sound if OK, the picture is barely OK. I have to admit that the LG picture was AWESOME!!!!!! This picture quality stinks for DVD. For HDTV broadcast it is lacking big time in picture quality. It has to be set to vivid for an alright picture. When viewing Blu-Ray and 3D content it is good, not great or awesome. Since there are few options for a 32\" 3D t.v with passive 3D, I would say this tv will work. I am not happy with the quality of the picture after trying all the settings, it will have to do. If this tv was for my house I would send it back, but as it is on my boat I will live with the so so picture. I have 2 other VIZIO tv's on the boat, a 20\" and a 22\", this units falls well short of expectations. 3D content is good only if you sit directly in front of the screen, any off axis viewing is not watchable.

Kelly", "ReviewID": "R16K8NZ8WB4C1S", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "So this TV has some really strong pros but a few potent negatives as well. Let me give the major drawback for me first.I got this TV for my parents as a Christmas present. I got it a little early so I gave it to them before the holidays. At first it was really great. But within a couple of weeks, the picture stopped coming on, and there was only sound. Then after a few days of that, it stopped coming on all together. We tried everything. We contacted VIZIO. Nothing. The unit was dead. Instead of dealing with Vizio's repair service, we simply returned the defective unit through amazon's return process (absolutely FABULOUS system! - Thanks amazon!) We opted for an identical replacement. After talking to a friend in the electronics business he told me that 25-35% of Vizio TV's are duds out of the box. Sounds like the first TV.Now the next minor issue - with the apps on this tv, there are a lot of alpha-numeric entries required (passwords, search for items, etc.) There is no keyboard on the remote and the onscreen keyboard is pretty lame. So be prepared to spend the majority of set up time entering in data - hunt and peck style. And if you have to re-enter information. forget it.Now for the pros (in relation to the second unit)TV is still working and (knock on wood) we don't seem to be having any issues with this one.-Blacks are very good-Picture is very sharp, you can tell it's 1080HD. (Even with your basic cable the picture is VERY good, very crisp. Blu-rays look great!-Sound- for the size of the TV I have to say this is probably the best sound I've heard from a 32\" LCD. I have a Vizio sound bar and am very impressed with that sound as well, so I have to say, vizio seems to get sound. The \"replica\" surround sound is actually decent I think. It fills the room, and is of good quality, nice full sound, not squeaky, not muffled. If sound matters to you, consider this unit (but be prepared for the first one to be a dud).-Like the option for 3D - though I haven't used it yet, but cool that it has it.-Apps (most) are decent - note on my unit it has Rhapsody and NOT pandora. So just be aware of that. Facebook is USELESS. Super slow load times. This may be due to the wireless connection. Wireless is find for most stuff, but facebook is so full of data/images, etc, just forget this unit even offers facebook.If the first TV worked without a hitch this would be a 4 star review (with the remote and apps pulling away one star), but a brand new TV should not just die within a few weeks of normal use.", "Date": "January 22, 2013"}, {"Title": "Hard to use with Amazon Prime", "Author": "Karen \"Karen\"", "ReviewID": "RA5W6SDZLUF2T", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "The tv works fine - slow startup, slow response to buttons (channel-changing, etc.) - my biggest frustration is the TERRIBLE interface for using Amazon Prime Video.

Digital Optical out as well as a 3.5MM stereo out.  I'm disappointed, because the previous version of this TV (returned for warranty reasons) had regular RCA audio out).  Luckily, I happened to have a 3.5mm to RCA adapter cable.Sound:Decent.  It has decent volume, although its fairly thin.  I haven't heard an LCD with decent internal speakers since my old 2005 Panasonic.  It is louder than most others I've heard recently, however.  If you don't have a stereo or a surround sound system to route the sound through, you'd probably want to consider a speaker bar.480 Performance:First thing's first...  The product has a truly AWFUL 480 picture.  When viewing a 480 program via cable, satellite or over the air (yes, I've tried all three with this TV), the color is washed out, the picture is fuzzy, and there are artifacts and blocking and assorted \"noise\" all over the picture.  Its so bad that if you happen to be watching a black and white picture, you will not only have a fuzzy picture, but you will have faint splashes of red noise flashing all over the picture.  480 images are FAR sharper and cleaner on my old 36\" CRT TV.  Everything from old Twilight Zone episodes to sit coms from 2005 look about as good as a poorly preserved film from the 70's (washed out, fuzzy).HD Performance:Now, if you don't care about 480 (somehow you have cable or satellite that has nothing BUT HD channels, for example), this is a great TV.  Its a little slow switching formats between 480, 720 and 1080 when switching channels, but when you have an HD digital signal, the picture is crystal clear with no motion blur.  Out of the box, the blacks ARE very dark and the whites are very white.  I am NOT one of those people who like \"deep black\" blacks, but I realize all the techno nerds love them for some reason, but I was able to adjust the brightness levels to actually see details in the shadows while maintaining a pretty dark black.3D Performance:Warning:  The TV will only automatically detect 3D and switch to 3D mode if you are viewing content from the internal apps (like Vudu) or from a 3D Blu-Ray disc.  I don't have a 3D Blu-Ray player, but my Blu-Ray player plays movies from USB, and if you have access to 3D SBS movie files, you can play them from your avi/divx/mp4-enabled Blu-Ray player (3D or not), you can manually activate 3D mode, and it works beautifully.  The 3D picture is very bright, considering the polarized glasses, with only a slight \"halo\" effect when you are viewing a scene with a huge contrast between the foreground and background images.  The 3D is about the same as I have experienced in movie theaters.Apps:All the standard apps are there, Netflix, Vudu, Hulu, YouTube, etc.  It even has Amazon Prime, which is a nice plus!  Although the Amazon app leaves much to be desired as far as search features.  There are a few other apps that I consider useless on a TV (who is really going to look at Facebook and Twitter on a TV?) that I have not looked at.Random thoughts:* The TV takes a good 10-15 seconds to go from OFF to having a picture.  Doesn't bother me, but it might bother you.* Wait about 30 seconds after you get a picture before you start trying to access apps, or else there will be some random lag in the apps menu.* The remote is full-featured, and has a QWERTY keyboard on the back.  I have never accidentally hit any buttons on the reverse side by mistake as you have to deliberately push the buttons to make them work.  However, some people may find this annoying, as you can't casually tap buttons and get any response.* The remote is small, and doesn't not give you the option to control any other devices.  Universal remotes work fine with this TV, but you will need to keep the TV remote handy if you want to access the 3D function.Final thoughts:If the horrible (awful, nasty) 480 display does not bother you, this is a fantastic TV for the price range.  The display rivals some of the much higher-priced options out there, especially considering you have a 120Hz refresh rate and 3D ability.

I'm not really into the 3D experience (gives my wife a heahache) but because I have a 3D Blueray player I decided to get one in case in the future I decided I wanted to try it out.  For the most part, I bought this model because of the 200,000 to 1 pixels and one 120 hz refresh rate.Setup was fast.  The TV came on instantly, and the installation procedure was clear.  I was amazed how quickly it detected our network, even though I disabled the feature because I use my wireless Blueray player through my receiver so I can have sorround sound, whether it's Netflix or a movie.  Boot-up didn't seem painfully slow, as some have reported, and I haven't noticed any more than a normal amount of glare, as some have reported.  In fact, the TV I just replaced, a 57 inch Mitsubishi, had more glare in comparison.A note of caution: when I first installed the base, the TV wobbled too much, and I discovered that I hadn't tightened the thumbscrew enough.  You want to make sure it doesn't turn at all.  Don't overtighten, of course.  But there shouldn't be any give.One default setting I didn't like was the dimness of the screen.  The TV's menu, however, is easy to navigate, and you have complete control over every aspect of the image.  For my tastes, I found changing the setting to \"footbal\" (even though I'm not a football fan) over \"standard\" gave me the brightness and contrast I was looking for.We watched Men in Black for our first BlueRay, and I couldn't believe how vivid and crisp everythign on the screen was.  It felt as though Will Smith was in the room with us.  My last TV is five years old, and the technology has obviously evolved.So far I am very happy with my purchase.

Highly recommend!!!", "Author": "Capt.

However, the seller, Electronics101 really did a great job quickly sending me out a replacement so kudos to them! (Don't bother calling them though, use the Amazon e-mail service if you want a quick response.)3D Content:I purchased this as a first 3D TV, so I can't really compare to other 3DTV's.The only 3D movie I had to test with was Finding Nemo and it looked fantastic! When the TV detects 3D content (from my 3D Blu-Ray Player for example) it automatically asks if I would like to switch to 3D. Sadly, with my Time Warner Cable (Cisco) box this isn't the case- but I'm not surprised as cable companies are behind the times when it comes to 3D content.Blu-Ray HD:When I put in Band of Brothers (Blu-Ray 1080P, 24p) it was the crispest picture I have ever seen. This was especially the case when I enabled the Vizio Smooth Action/Cinema settings. It did kind of look surreal in some parts (like in a long scene where people are walking) as if people were moving faster than they should have, but part of that is because with regular TV we are used to seeing motion blur. This blur is precisely what the Vizio Smooth Action/Cinema settings try to omit.Darker colors show up nicely. The blacks in a picture show better when the Vizio Luma setting is on high.Digital Cable:Unfortunately I'm plagued with Time Warner Cable monopoly in my area. The only 3D channel (with content on it) are the old replays ESPN3D, which is not worth the $10/month they require you to pay. Time Warner does offer a 3D section on their On Demand movie lineup, but the free contents are short documentary-type movies. Regardless, the 3D content through cable looks fine- though not nearly as good as when played back from a 3D blu-ray disc.As of now, TV companies only broadcast in 1080i or 720p (1080p is too expensive), so the HD content through cable looked good, but again, not the 1080p you get when playing back from a blu-ray. By the way, those of you watching DirecTV 1080p are watching a dumbed down/compressed version of 1080p, so again, it's not true 1080p therefore the quality won't look like a 1080P blu-ray.Internet Content/Vizio Apps:I definitely didn't get this TV for the use of apps, as I use the blu-ray player for streaming. However, it is nice to hit a button the TV remote and scroll through the apps while watching TV simultaneously. I especially like being able to check the weather when watching TV. The YouTube app is nice, but not as easy to navigate as the blu-ray player YouTube app and I can only assume the same for Netflix. I believe all the apps are sponsored/developed by Yahoo!, but as I said, the blu-ray players is much better. You can also download more apps from the Yahoo! app store (or whatever it's called) but there isn't much of a variety.It DOES take a few seconds longer to turn on than a regular TV. But I feel this is normal as I attribute this to being a Smart TV and having to load the operating system, apps and also logging on to the wireless network. Patience is a virtue.The 802.11n WiFi works very nicely, after putting in the password for my wireless network, the TV did the two firmware updates automatically.Remote Control:The idea behind this thing is simply awesome. It would take FOREVER to use any of the apps without a keyboard so the keyboard on the flip side of the remote is really a great idea. The problem? It's not bluetooth, it's infrared! At first glance this might not sound like a big problem, and indeed, that's how I felt when I made the purchase. However, it's a pain in the neck. If there is ANYTHING even close to blocking the IR receiver on the bottom left of the TV, forget about using the remote! In my case the TV is sitting on a dresser which is higher than the bed. When laying bed trying to use the keyboard-remote, you have to tilt the remote up while pressing the keys. It's especially hard because the cable box sits in front of the TV (there's no other place for it!).Again, not a deal breaker as I didn't plan on using the apps much anyway, but still would have liked the solid bluetooth.Input/Output:This TV definitely CAN play movies from USB Flash drives. Some reviews have said it can't. Perhaps they were trying to play file formats that were unsupported? I created a 1080p movie using iMovie and it worked without any conversion. There are two USB ports.The HDMI ports are great, I only wish there were more than three! (One on the side, two in the back.)Summary:This is a wonderful TV. Yes, there are a few small things that could have made it even better, but they might have those features omitted simply in order to entice the purchase of a different, more expensive model. Also, it's 120hz as opposed to 60hz, so that makes the picture looks even sharper. 1080p Blu-Ray's look wonderful and 1080p 3D blu-rays look even better! With ethernet/wifi ability the TV is able to keep itself and apps updated automatically which is very nice. If you have reasonable expectations, you won't be disappointed with this purchase.Tips:As with any TV, if you really want to watch true HD/3D, make sure you have the necessary additional hardware to it (3D blu-ray player, 3D digital cable box). One more thing, when selecting blu-ray movies, check the back of the package to make sure it is 1080P so you get the best quality picture.

I can't believe how great it looks.As for 3d, I never experienced it outside of the theater, but was amazed at how images on Call of Duty Black Ops popped out of the screen.  I got Black Ops 2 for Christmas, and set on 3d it will blow your mind how real the game becomes!  The experience is just terrific, and the price compared to other companies is so cheap for the quality.I have streamed Netflix through the television with the built in application, and it works flawlessly.  The remote responds well, you just have to make sure to keep line of sight.  The glasses for the 3d are high quality just like in the theater, and you get a pair.  The sound out of the television is also amazing, and is perfect if you live in an apartment as you will never exceed 24.  It has plenty of ports in the back and the side as well.I strongly suggest this television to anyone looking for one.

Fabulous Picture quality.", "Author": "Pinot Noir", "ReviewID": "R2BTUI5RCVLKE0", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "December 2012. I love the picture on this 47\" Vizio.Superb clarity and sharpness from the display. Better than most ofthe low cost LG and Samsung models sold at the wholesale clubs.My goal was $700. max for a good 47\" 120hz HDTV. Did not need 3D ora smart TV. I do need a beautiful sharp picture. Really sharp.I spent many hours looking at TV displays in 720p and 1080i resolutionat many different stores. Then more hours reading reviews and stillI was not satisfied with the picture on my first 2 choices.Tried an LG 47LS4500. Not a great picture. Not for an LG.Next tried a JVC 47\" LC47BC3002. Slight blur with several sources. Blur!!on an HDTV.  Great sound quality though.Then I found this Vizio E3D470Vx. Wow! Superb picture with antenna and DVD.I judge this picture to be as good as the Samsung 7 series HDTV at $1400.Tried many sources and resolutions.  They are all great.Netflix streaming video is Superb on this TV.The QAM ATSC receiver is good. I live in a weak signal area and canview 7 HD channels (plus sub-channels) with small outdoor antenna.The remote is nice with a QWERTY keyboard on back side, but hasVERY small buttons on the front(TV) side. Why so small?? Men withbig fingers will hate this remote.Sound is Good. Not tinny, but not really good. I can live with that.The 3D is a bonus. The kids love it, I have not tried it.The Smart TV is a great bonus. Many apps available incl. Netflix.I have only tried the Smart TV apps for an hour, but they work andthere are many web channels availableI'm glad this unit is still available. One great value at $580.Go view it at your local Big Box, you will be impressed.", "Date": "December 14, 2012"}, {"Title": "Excellent Value in spite of the Remote Control Issues", "Author": "G. Cox \"Shanghaied\"", "ReviewID": "R26VC4R641SH82", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Note: I would have given this TV 4.5 stars if I had the option, but decided to round up.Pros:*Amazing value for the price!!!*Easy to set up (the TV walks you through step-by-step how to set it up and it only takes a few minutes)*Crisp, clear picture*Streams movies/TV shows on Netflix, Amazon Prime, Hulu Plus, etc, all pretty quickly and easily.*Easy to change the picture settings for viewing movies, video games, etc*2D to 3D conversion capability (with glasses included) is nice to have, but I can't say that I ever take advantage of this feature*Seems to be pretty reliable after more than 3 months of daily useCons:*Really the only con for me is the not-so-responsive remote control (see below for more details).Overview:I would definitely recommend purchasing this TV: it's a great value, has held up over some time, and has a lot of great features. This is the first time I've used a TV with internet capabilities and I was really impressed both by how easy it was to set up and how reliable it's been.I mostly use the TV to stream Netflix movies and television shows and I'm really happy with this feature. Netflix maintains an instant queue of programs you've recently viewed, so it's easy to pick up where you left off in your favorite TV shows or movies. If I were to be picky, though, I would say that the Netflix application (which I use most frequently of all of the features) leaves some things to be desired. It doesn't seem to have some of the same functionality as using Netflix on my computer and it can be rather slow to search for new movies/programs. However, I really don't see this as a major downside and it might be true of all \"Smart TVs\".Really the only downside about this TV is the remote control. It can be very unresponsive and frustrating at times. I'll push a button over and over again without the TV responding. This doesn't seem to be a problem with the TV itself, but rather that the remote has to be aimed in a very particular direction for the signal to go through. The remote has an alphanumeric keyboard on the back, which you need for setting up your internet connection (the first time you set up the TV) and also for searching for programs on Netflix/Hulu/Amazon Prime. But this keyboard can be frustratingly slow when you have to aim the remote so precisely for it to work. I suppose I could get a universal remote control but I haven't looked into this option. I assume that it might be hard to find one that has a keyboard on it, but I've also seen that some tablets (like the Samsung Galaxy) can also function as universal remotes, so that's another potential solution. All in all, the remote control is annoying but compared to the amazing price of the TV and how satisfied I've been with all of the features, the problem with the control is not a big enough issue for me to take a star off of my rating.", "Date": "December 12, 2012"}, {"Title": "WOW an OUTSTANDING 3D WIFI TV SYSTEM FOR ABOUT $500...WOW!", "Author": "Dr. Love", "ReviewID": "R362HOOAVJOZE9", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "WOW an OUTSTANDING 3D WIFI TV SYSTEM FOR ABOUT $500...WOW!

We are on DirectTV. So I immediatly connect the HDMI cable from the sattelite box to the new 3D TV. I had to look around a bit on DirectTV but forund 4 3D channels. 1 was PPV the rest are free. My favorite is ESPN 3D. Football game are incredible in 3D. That alone was worth the Price. DirectTV to my knowledge is the only sattellite provide with 3D channels. Of course we connected our Blu-Ray player, as well and that was amazing. If you have a decent internet connecting you can download (rent or buy) movies in 3D from Amazon via the TV.

If you have SRS True Sound enabled the sounds goes up and down a lot. if you turn this feature off the sound if fine but you lose sound quality and loudness as a result to the point where the sound sounds rather basic. Vizio decided not to put LED back lighting in these TV's, instead they went with the traditional CCFL Bulb back lighting on these new models which was prob due to cost cutting measures. CCFL Bulb back lighting isn't bad, but it's  older technology and the picture isn't as vibrant as your LED black lighting are. Then again if you want LED back lighting you are going to pay a higher premium for it as well. So it all depends upon what is in your budget.For the price though you can't go wrong with this TV if you are on a budget.

I went into the store to buy the Vizio w/out the 3D but after seeing the price I downgraded the LED version to opt out for the LCD 3D just based off the display and features (3D & VIApps).3D & Picture: With the 3D Olympics Channel through my cable provider was nice I felt a little exclusive being one of the few to watch this channel & I have watched a few movies with them & my family has enjoyed both greatly. The glasses are passive so no annoying batteries but still gives a nice 3D effect. I've seen $2,000 Sony 3D tvs and was not impressed to spend that kind of money & it was with glasses that needed batteries. I love the picture & 3D works great to me being that I've never had it before it definitely a nice bonus & is worth it!REMOTE: NOT LIGHTED My only complaint with the remote because it is a nice decent remote and since I have it in my bedroom if it's dark using the remote for the keyboard is probably not going to happen without some lighting added.CAN TAKE SOME ABUSE/BUILD QUALITY: Recently my family were transitioning & my toddler son was acting out, he ended up pouring oil over the TV then again he's poured water & the liquid from the perfume bottles. I lost one cable box already because of it but not this tv. Every time we thought the TV was a goner. Each time we turned it off, turned it over on it's top and let it drain and dry out for about a half a day & each time we would turn on the TV and it would work like nothing ever happened! My husband and I were like \"we need to write some reviews\" because this TV has shown itself to stand some blows. And one time we had to open the TV with the water incident to get a blow dryer in there and found out the screen was made by LG anyway! I was told in the store that Vizio was made by Sony but all in all it's a great TV no matter who made it.APPS: The apps are great and to my liking and growing every week. You can now watch YouTube Videos, so with that, Pandora, TuneIn Radio, Amazon Instant Videos & Netflix I'm set! My only complaint might be that I had to choose between apps because it would only let me have like 10 or so apps installed.CONS: Then also it does not have full internet which would have also meant that it would have cost more & also the sound/volume probably wouldn't be ideal for a large room.SOUND: We have it in our bedroom so not much noise to compete with & its fine at the middle to low level for us. But we know if we move it to the family room we would need a sound bar or something to enhance the sound over kitchen noise and kiddies etc.OVERALL: With this purchase we are sold with Vizio products! Every time I make an electronics or computer purchase I'm checking Vizio first & based off quality & price I am almost certain they will win everytime! They have found a loyal customer in me!", "Date": "August 3, 2012"}, {"Title": "Awesome TV. Great Price!!!!!!", "Author": "A.

I know it sounds silly, but the remote control alone is one of the most beautiful pieces of electronica I've touched.I was a little apprehensive about the contrast ratio (200,000:1 on this TV as opposed to millions on higher-priced models), but it doesn't seem to affect the darks and blacks in the picture. Perhaps if it was side by side with a model costing several hundred dollars more, you could determine a difference, but the thing is that I only have one TV in my living room. And there, it looks fantastic. And about those other models costing hundreds of dollars more: I've heard nothing but questionable (to be generous) reviews about their internet interfaces.

I had some trepidation about it, based on the too-good-to-be-true price and the negative reviews stating that their sets just died inexplicably after some time or arrived broken.However, this TV has been a joy for me. Beautiful picture, great sound, and nice features. Others have complained about the lack of internet options, but with Netflix, Hulu, and a bevy of others, what more do you need?The 3D, in particular, is wonderful. Haven't watched any movies yet, but I've played three 3D PS3 games, and they look AMAZING. The included glasses work just fine. They're lightweight and don't interfere with vision when not staring at 3D.Others have also complained about the remote being too small. In a word: WAAAAAAAAHHHH. To me, it's just fine. I LIKE that it's so small. What do you want to do, schlep around a whole keyboard? It WORKS.Another complaint I've heard: lack of HDMI ports. Again, what a bunch of crybabies. There are 3 ports, how many more can you possibly need? And they're easily accessible, so swapping out cables is a cinch.A big bonus for me: 2 USB ports. I was able to plug a flash drive right in and watch AVI movies directly. Formerly I would need to use my PS3 for that, so this saves me a step. Of course, just like the PS3, it won't read .mkv files, so HD/blu-ray rips will still have to be played on my laptop, with an HDMI cable running to the TV (easily done on this baby).Here's my one beef: the menu system. Too slow and too clunky. And the internet set-up that is part of those menus is weird and glitchy. It did not accept my wireless network security key after several tries, despite the fact that it's the same key all my other computers use (and they're all connected just fine to the wireless). I gave up and was about to run to the store to get an ethernet cable when, all of a sudden...it connected to my network on it's own. I still don't understand what happened, but just expect to encounter some similar hiccups.The complaints are minor and the praise is great.

I have not been impressed with the 3D performance. I have watched Born To Be Wild and The Darkest Hours (save yourself time there and avoid) to wildly varying results. I am using a Sony BDP590 DVD player. I have seen the LG passive TVs so that is my comparison; I had to buy this sight unseen as nobody carried this TV locally. The 3d seems to be okay with images in the central portion of the screen but images on the size seem fuzzy and/or out-of-focus. I have also noticed some distracting ghosting. I had better luck with Born To Be Wild as there is a lot more static, sustained images than the fast-moving action film. Is this a limitation of the set or do I need to look at some adjusting and tweaking? Having positive experiences with other Vizio products and seeing the LG set, I can't believe there would be this much of a gap in quality. BTW, I went with the Vizio over LG because I needed a smaller set.UPDATE: The problem was in my DVD player settings - feel like an idiot for not figuring this out before I posted. I bumped this another star. The 3D is not as immersive as the passive sets from LG but I paid $200 less than LG's comparable model. I also set up the wireless connections - had no problems except I had to try VUDU twice before registration took. I tried the TRON 2 minute 3D demo - as suggested by a very helpful VIZIO customer service rep - which helped me figure out the problem was not in my set as this played flawlessly.

The speakers are a little weak, but we've adjusted to it, and it can be connected to a stereo if desired. The 3D is great with minimal ghosting (it seems to depend on the source). Over all we really like the TV, but we'd trade it in for the following fixes:Major complaints: The TV allows watching of 3D for HDMI inputs ONLY; SBS and TAB 3D support should also be available for USB memory sticks or from analog sources. The YouTube app offers a large selection of 3D videos, but the L/R images are often swapped and the TV doesn't have the option to swap the images, rendering them unwatchable (unless maybe you were to take apart a pair of glasses and swap the lenses.) The audio is somewhat flat unless TruVolume and TruSurround are on, but if you use any legacy analog devices such as VHS or LaserDisc players or older computer/gaming systems, TruVolume will steadily increase any quiet audio until a hissing sound fills the speakers. The Amazon app often plays videos in the wrong aspect ratio, and has no option to correct this behavior.Minor complaints: Regardless of menu settings, the screen will automatically dim and sometimes won't un-dim for long periods with certain apps like Amazon, Netflix and YouTube. The advertised Amazon streaming video app has a button on the remote, but pressing it did nothing. It turns out it doesn't come preinstalled and has to be added. The YouTube app often stops playing videos and has an unintuitive interface unlike any other app. The TV's menu system is slow and complicated, and pressing up on the first menu item doesn't bring you to the bottom of the menu. Instead of using a 3D camera's HDMI cable, it would be nice to have native support on the USB port for the popular MPO and 3D-AVI formats. Connecting a laptop was difficult as you must have the correct output resolution chosen or the TV will simply tell you \"No Signal.\"", "Date": "March 24, 2012"}, {"Title": "Review for FACTORY REFURB", "Author": "Rebecca N", "ReviewID": "R121C3J87I0HX8", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "OVERALLI bought a factory refurbished model and had a wonderful experience. This is a great TV.  From the time I had it out of the box until it was running was less than 3 minutes.  Granted, I don't have it hooked up to cable because that was the point.  I have amazon prime video and hulu plus, and that's all I need.  The 3D is decent, but doesn't really apply to most of what I watch.  I got this for the internet TV part of it, and figured that once I'm making the purchase, might as well get the 3D model.  Anyway,  I'm really happy with this choice.  The only downside, which is trivial, is that it can take 30 seconds or so to start up when you first turn it on.  Of course each factory refurb experience might vary, but mine had everything in the box including the manuals and looked untouched.WIDGETSFor some reason, I didn't have amazon prime in my widgets.  There's an amazon button on the remote, and when I pressed it, nothing happened.  But after I turned the TV back off and on again, it said it had updated the widgets, and after that there was amazon in the choices and the amazon button on the remote worked.  I don't know if this has to do with the refurb, but it's nice to know that the widgets are auto updated and maintained.  It's nice to see new companies on the list of widgets that I know didn't even exist when this TV first came out.  So I guess as digital media companies develop TV apps, they can get added to your choices.DAY 1The first things I watched were Brokeback Mountain (Amazon), The pilot to Quantum Leap from so many years ago (Hulu), and the latest episode of Modern Family (Hulu).  The quality I get is full HD.  I have Verizon FIOS internet though, so my speeds are generally awesome.CLOSINGI'm hooked :)  Glad to be free of my monthly cable bill, which for basic cable and the DVR (who needs a DVR anymore when it's all on demand) was north of $75/month with tax.

It is very hard to get used to. There is a \"game mode\", but it is not a TOTAL fix.Second, when playing games like COD:BO and MLB the Show 11 in 3D this TV will only allow 720P processing therefore you cannot use the GAME MODE, so the lag is even worse.

I wanted to replace a 22inch TV hooked up to a computer with a 32inch TV to be able to watch from a little bit of a distance (I have a rather large bedroom).  My thinking was I'd either get a 32inch or replace my 42 inch in my living room with a larger TV and move that one.Well, I ended up with this TV for the bedroom.  I had certain criteria:Had to work well with a PC32 Inches or moreInternet Apps were a huge plus, especially netflix/huluHad to be affordable - TV and Stand needed to come in under $800So, I decided to look in Walmart of all places to get an idea of what is out there.  I have a Phillips 42inch as my last purchase 3 or 4 years ago.  It's worked well, but I know TV tech keeps moving along...I wasn't going to purchase a TV at Walmart, but this one kept luring me back.  It was cheaper (I paid $598) than the Vizio 42\" Internet TV with no 3D (that one was $648)..  The 47\" 3D was $798 and just didn't look that much bigger for a $200 difference...  Anything bigger was either out of my price range, or the ones in my price range had very limited options...So, after mulling it over for about 45 minutes, I pulled the trigger on this TV.  I'm glad I did.  As skeptical as I was of buying a 3D TV, my fears were allayed as soon as I got it home and turned it on for the first time.  A quick 2 minute setup, and I was watching 2D TV.  Just in time for the NFL Playoffs.  The 120HZ refresh rate coupled with full 1080p is great.  My other 42inch is 1080p, but only 60hz.  The difference is noticable.  The screen itself is coated (I presume for 3D and anti-glare), and it looks great in anything but the most direct sunlight.  No complaints with picture quality, especially in this price range.The Internet Apps are great.  Dissapointed there is no YouTube Widget, but what do you expect for Yahoo! branded software?  Everything else works like a charm.  Netflix, Hulu, Amazon (button doesn't work until you configure the widget with a Prime account).  WiFi was simple to setup, and I'm getting excellent speeds and range.  It's a little slow on the uptake as far as navigating sometimes, but responsive enough to not be a fault ...  Some apps are blazing, some take a little more patience.. Not sure if that's the TV or the app itself.  Absolutely love that the apps come up no matter what input is selected as there are some TV's that are really picky about where apps can be brought up.I didn't buy this TV for 3D, but of course I wanted to try it out..  I'm not a big fan of 3D movies at the theatre -- in fact I watched Avatar in 2D when it came out.  It just wasn't that big of a deal to me.  But, I do play a lot of 3D games on my PC, so wanted to try that out.  I first loaded up some 3D You tube videos, just to see if I could get it working.  After a few misfires, I got a nice flower demo with some classical music.  The 3D works great!  I was shocked at how well, and it's a passive system so that's even better.As far as the 3D gaming is concerned --  It's taken a while to get it working with my PC and GFX card, but I found a program called DDD 3D that works well.  Some tweaking of game settings, but I got Elder Scrolls: Skyrim working with it, and WOW!  3D Tech has come a long way since Jaws 3D ...  I still think it's a little gimmicky and I'm not sure if I'll switch full time to 3D viewing, but it's nice knowing I can use it when the content is available.  I will say this:  Games and Movies made for 3D vision look great --  Anything really not meant to be in 3D that was converted to 3D looks ok, but not convincing enough.If you are on the fence with this TV, I say dive right in.

Not only is it a bargain price for a 1080p 32\" with 3d capabilities, but it also has built in wifi and is a Vizio. The TV is easy to set up and is big enough tv for many people to watch movies and play games on. I own a PS3 and 3D gaming on it is an amazing experience. The glass for the tv are passive which means they require no batteries and are cheap. I found that 3D glasses from movies work well with the tv, so 3D glass are cheap and available. The only complaint I've heard from people using my tv is that the 3d is that it doesn't work if you are within five feet of the tv or too far to the side BUT all other 3d televisions suffer that same problem, and too be honest you shouldn't be that close to a 32\" tv anyway. The internet apps on the tv are another good addition. Vudu let's u instantly stream 3d movies while netflix and hulu plus provide 2d movie and tv series streaming. Even though the tv is a 3D tv you will spend most of your time using it in 2D. The television's 2D picture is great and better than our 55\" Samsung we own. The tv's multiple hmdi plug in's are nice to have allowing you to hook up multiple gaming systems, blu ray, and cable tv. The TV also has standard yellow, red, and white plug ins for older hardware. In conclusion I believe that this tv is the best 3d value available. I would also recommend a PS3 with the televisions because they have the ability to act as a 3d blu ray player, which typically cost 150$, and gaming in 3D is awesome :)", "Date": "January 7, 2012"}, {"Title": "great tv", "Author": "YD \"DY\"", "ReviewID": "R3VR3FYV54LCN0", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "this is my first 3d tv and it took a bit to adapt to the picture.

It looks like any other 2D monitor I have used unless you sit about 4 feet away, and the small horizontal lines become slightly visible.  The 3D aspect gives great depth and convergence, but adds a strange shiny interlaced effect to anything that measures a few pixels tall.  That means that in games or other 3D content, things such as text or tiny objects will render with a shiny border that runs horizontally across it.  This makes text difficult to read unless you enlarge it significantly, and any small portions of an object (like reigns on a horse) will have a glossy outline.  Not devastating to the screen, but if you're like me and want a gaming 3D screen or are a stickler for crisp image quality, this is a deal breaker.  To some it won't matter, but if you are looking for a crisp, anomaly free 3D experience, this is not the screen for you.  I have my eye on 3 new monitors coming out and I am waiting for helpful reviews on them before I decide: Acer GR235H, HP 2311gt, and AOC e2352Phz.

Then I found this unit locally at an incredible price. Because of my familiarity with it through this site I was able to purchase it with confidence. And I have not been disappointed!This more than meets my wish list for our new TV. It was important that it had wifi to connect to the internet, that it had the Amazon Prime app, that it was 1080p (my husband has failing vision due to disease), and that it had enough ports (specifically, at least 2 HDMI, a PC port, and USB).This television has all of the above and also has the 3D function which we had never even considered! Since we will be replacing our older DVD player with a newer BluRay within the next 6 months, we will enjoy being able to use that unexpected function.Our living room is small, so we didn't want a too-large TV. In our 12x16 space 32\" is perfect! The picture is crisp and clear and even my husband can see it without moving his chair right up to the screen. We are enjoying our Amazon Prime videos like never before, as well as the other apps. I wish it would have come with the YouTube app but we purchased the Premium 25ft HD15 M/M VGA / SVGA / UXGA with AUDIO Monitor Projector Cable Stereo 3.5mm Audio - Double Shielded UL Listed and by connecting it to our laptops we can see videos there also, so not a problem! (I also have a Micro HDMI to HDMI Cable 6 FT. Motorola Droid X HTC EVO 4G on order through amazon so I can connect my DroidX to the TV and watch content through it. I'll be able to leave the phone near the TV and use my netbook while I watch videos.)The only drawback with this unit, and I'm not even sure it is from the TV itself, is that when in RGB mode and connected to a computer there is a low hum whenever the screen is just showing text (such as reading email) and not using audio. The hum disappears when watching videos or listening to music however and I solve this by pressing the mute button on the remote until I'm ready to use the audio again, so it's not a huge problem for me.All in all, this is a great TV and would be a bargain even if we'd paid a lot more for it!", "Date": "November 30, 2011"}, {"Title": "Great!!!", "Author": "Bud", "ReviewID": "R178KWOA6PW9W9", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I purchased 2 of these and was not disappointed.

In fact, I LOVE IT!!!Vizio more than met my expectations with this HDTV.  It does EVERYTHING almost anyone ever could want in a full feature wide screen TV at this price point.  Better still, some stores are currently selling this exact same model with a $100 instant rebate, which makes this an incredible value!  (I paid $569 plus tax).  It comes in a well protected container, but is relatively light weight, ~35 lbs, so that I was able to load/unload to/from the back of my SUV by myself.Some lesser known discoveries with this TV may be of interest . . .VuDu is currently offering a $5.99 credit to open a new account to owners of this TV.  VuDu, along with a couple of other streaming video apps (like Netflix and Amazon.com) has a large selection of old and newly released movies that can be directly streamed over an Internet connection.  For Facebook users, that app is supported as well.  You can connect to these via an Ethernet cable or wirelessly via WiFi, using this TV.  Keep in mind, for ALL streaming videos sources, you must have a HIGH SPEED Internet service provider to properly and effectively utilize streaming videos.  (I'm using AT&T; DSL with a MAXIMUM download speed up to 6.0 Mbits/s.  Lower cost ISPs with download speeds of 3.0 Mbits/sec or less, simply will not cut it for full High Definition quality streaming videos).A nice feature on VuDu is that it allows any movies selected (in one of 3 different resolutions, the highest being true 1080p) to be \"tested\".  The first few minutes anyway, without charge, using your existing ISP connection.  If you can view it without any issues, you are good to go.  This testing capability is very useful to avoid renting a HD movie only to find your Internet connection has insufficient bandwidth to stream that movie at a high enough download speed.  If it cannot, not to worry, VuDu can usually still stream the same movie at a \"standard\" wide screen resolution of 480p, at lower cost.  Even at 480p movies still look good on this Vizio HDTV!VuDu also has a terrific selection of actual \"3D\" movies unlike most other real time VOD (Videos On Demand) sites.  I found an inexpensive 3D documentary, \"Hearst Castle\", to watch in 3D.  All I can say is, WOW!  The 3D effect is very realistic!!!For a membership fee, Amazon Prime is also supported, which has many FREE movies, but VuDu is strictly a VOD site without any membership fee.  VuDu, Netflix and Amazon are all accessible directly from the Vizio remote control with one button dedicated to each.  The remote is unusual in that it has \"two sides\".  A QUERTY keyboard is on one side to make browsing on these (and other) movie sites much easier.  My only gripe with this remote, is it has no backlighting; nor do hardly any other TVs currently on the market.  IMHO, such a useful feature should be offered by all consumer electronic manufacturers.  Without backlit illuminated buttons, operating virtually any remote in a dark room is almost impossible.The built-in speakers, as many other reviewers have commented, leaves a lot to be desired.  However in a small size, quite room environment, like a bedroom, they are quite adequate.  To inexpensively enhance the audio, Vizio's separately offered, 40\" wide Soundbar is perfect for this model 42\" HDTV.  BUYERS BEWARE, unless you elevate this TV off the same surface the soundbar is on, which is generally placed directly in front of the TV, the TV's IR window in the lower left will be blocked.  If wall mounting the Soundbar and/or HDTV (light enough to be quite feasible), solves this problem!In conclusion, this budget minded 1080p, 120Hz, HDTV is 3D enabled right out of the box.  It looks great in 2D as well.  The pair of included 3D glasses work surprising well.  3D viewing on this TV is just as good as any movie playing in the theater.  Vizio has competitively priced this particular model, yet it is still of exceptional quality, enriched with many additional, useful features.

I think Vizio would have done better with a matte black finish.4: It is somewhat wobbly and they only included 1 tiny cable to secure this huge TV to the wall or TV stand.

I have it drawing 47 watts/hr which is just 16 watts more than my 23 inch computer monitor draws. For a 1080p, 42 inch, 120HZ display with as nice a picture as this has that is incredible ! My plasma wall ornament draws over 300 watts/hr and thus it's current status as a wall ornament. The only changes I've made to the default picture settings was: Go in advanced picture settings and change the backlight control from DCR to OPC and the ambient light sensor from medium to low. The room the TV is in also has to be pretty darned dark or the power consumption will be higher: Depending on room lighting up to more than double the dark room draw. If you have one of those 20 dollar kill o watt meters hook it up to test. I found the results to be eye opening. Officially this set is rated at 93 watts/hr but that's just an average estimate based on 2d and 3d use and in varied light settings.3d viewing puts this tv into high energy draw mode(160-170 watts/hr) regardless of settings or room lighting. That is a flaw in my view although I saw nothing wrong with the 3d picture quality. If your ps3 is configured to play 3d enabled games this television will draw that extra power continuously as long as the 3d enabled game is playing even if you choose to play the game in 2d. Regular 2d ps3 games are not affected. There is a work around that involves reconfiguring your ps3 to not recognize 3d enabled games. You do this by plugging the hdmi of the ps3 into another television  a 720p 2d set for ie:) and then once the ps3 has configured to that tv replugging the ps3 into this tv but this time ignoring the countdown prompt. Every time you start the ps3 the countdown prompt will have to be ignored. The xmb will display at 1080i vs 1080p. You won't get 3d in your gaming but you also will save the 120 watts/hr and the tv will run cool.There are two usb thumb drive connections. Playing music files through a usb thumb drive connected to this television uses about 57watts/hr. Displaying photos uses a whopping 137 watts/hr. You can listen to your tunes and display your photos but the power draw will remain at about 137watts/hr(using my picture settings in a dark room). External hard drives will not work(according to the manual) only thumb drives. You also can not display video files through the thumb drive connections. I've had no problems with Netflix but Vudu streams will occasionally freeze up because they max out your bandwidth and mine can only handle 720p at 7 mb/s. When a freeze occurs you may have to cut power to the television and restart to fix. Streaming movies adds 7.5 watts to the television's energy draw plus the 5.5 watts my router draws.  One potential long term problem with this set is the lack of energy efficiency for 3d use. If the set used double the power and didn't get quite so hot I'd probably be okay with it but this set uses almost quadruple the power for 3d and gets quite hot which means alot of that wattage is wasted as heat. That can't be good for components. Fortunately for me, I won't be watching much 3d programming but if you want this set primarily for 3d use you may want to wait until a more energy efficient model for 3d becomes available.Even so I have to applaud electronics manufactures for stepping up to the plate in regard to carbon emmissions and energy efficiency. This set draws half the power of a 2008 32 inch lcd 720p television I still watch on occasion when used for 2d viewing. Internet connectivity and apps, theatre 3d, 2d energy efficiency, great picture jaw dropping value ....for me this although not perfect is still a 'pinch me' product !", "Date": "June 23, 2011"}, {"Title": "Great for sports!", "Author": "Wesson E.

I knew we were going to get new TV this year and started doing some research.  Less than $1000 around 42\", best bang for the buck, plasma or LCD.  I had pretty much decided to buy a Panasonic used Plasma from Amazon and get the square trade warranty, about $800 for a newer plasma w/ 3D capability.  3D wasn't a must have but I felt is was wise to get in case it \"takes off\", I could get the special shutter glasses later.  We went on vacation in early April and I was going to order when I got back.  We stopped at my brother's house on vacation and he told me I should check out Vizio, well I hadn't seen anything pop out at me but a few days later when I got home and checked things out and found this gem.

I felt a \"go big or go home\" mentality rush through me and I grabbed this 3D TV. I have watched a few of the 3D selections available on VUDU (one of Vizio's internet apps, one of the great features on this TV) and I am very well impressed. No flickering, no headache, great picture and great sound. Not to mention that 3D glasses are included, and you can even use the 3D glasses from the theaters so your friends can watch too! I highly recommend this TV to anyone shopping around for a 3D tv with a budget in mind. You will get the bang for your buck for sure. My only complaint is of the double sided, QWERTY remote.

At first we thought it was the way the tv was and never said anything about it.  The longer we've had it and look at it, we are now convenced the center is not to have a slight crease on the bottom of it.  We're not people to complain about things that much so we just let it go.About a month ago I was sitting there one night and all of the sudden the wireless went out on it.  This means I could no longer use the smart tv features on this TV.  I was frustrated but really didn't have the time to troubleshoot it at the time.  I've watched this tv just using it as a tv for the past month or so.Well today our router went out and we had to purchase and set up a new one.  We got all the computers back on-line without any problems.  I thought this would also cure this TV's connection problems but it didn't.  I proceeded to contact Vizio via their chat technical support.  While I slowly waited for responses, we troubleshooted this for a good 70 minutes.  The verdict on their end was my router's security settings.  I patiently changed all the settings and anything they had me do to the router and the settings on the tv.  It was VERY tedious to go through all of this and in the end, they told me it was my router's security..... really?  It did work when we hooked it in directly to the ethernet cable, or if I disabled ALL security on my network, but I'm not going to drag a cord all the way from another room every time I want to watch Netflix or leave my network unsecure.  So bottom line is the 70 minutes I spent with technical support was wasted.  I'm no better off now than I was before I called.The TV is an \"okay\" tv.  It does have a clear picture.  The sound is a little bad but we were always going to put a soundbar on it to make it sound better as others have said.  I just don't think it should be this hard to get it to work with a router that was just taken out of the box this evening.  Something is very strange about that.I don't think I would suggest anyone buying another smart tv.  Looks like I'll just go hook my Boxee that I put away up to this tv.

We've had Hitachi, Mitsubishi, Sony and Panasonic big screen TVs and nothing else compares. We currently have a 50\" Hitachi HD Plasma that has a beautiful clear detailed picture but this Vizio beats it on color. The colors are brighter and definitely more vivid. Considering the relatively inexpensive cost (we bought it elsewhere for much less on sale), the picture quality is remarkable.The other impressive aspect of this Vizio is that the picture looks perfect even up close. We have a Sony 40\" HD LCD and when you get up close, the picture looks fuzzy, I've seen this on other LCD TVs. When I looked at this Vizio up close in the store, I was surprised at how good the picture looked even a foot away, it was perfect, the Sony doesn't look 1/2 as good.The 3D is really unbelievably good. I was skeptical that 3D on a TV would be any good but it is on this Vizio. We played Legends of the Guardians from a Vizio 3D Blu-Ray player and it was really great.If you are looking for a great HD LCD 3D TV then seriously take a look at this Visio, you shouldn't be disappointed, especially with the color quality and brightness.However, if you bought this Vizio TV for the Internet Connection, you will be disappointed. You are limited to ONLY the apps from Vizio through Yahoo. If you have a streaming content service not listed in the Vizio Apps, you will not be able to connect to it. I have a ROKU and can connect to any service that I am subscribed to. And do not expect to be able to do anything else other than the apps, this TV will not function as a browser and you cannot do general internet stuff. I was really hoping it would function similarly to my ROKU box as there are 3 streaming services that are NOT listed in the Vizio Apps and I will not be able to connect to them. That means I either have to not use those services on this TV or buy another ROKU box.And the \"Guide\" button does nothing at least I cannot get it to show anything.I originally rated it 5 stars based on the Picture Quality and 3D and if that is all you are interested in then it is a great TV. But I also bought it for the Streaming Content (WiFi Internet) and a few other features. I also contacted customer service with some questions but I would have been better off talking to my dog.

We went to another retailer to buy a TV, and I had a list of specs I wanted.  I wanted a 1080p, 120Hz, LCD or LED TV that was over 40\".  That's it.  This TV was not only the best value with those specs in mind, it also was 3D, has internet apps and wifi, and is from a great brand!  I absolutely could not have asked for more, especially for the price.Initial impressions - The TV and accessories were very well packaged.  The TV looks incredible.  The remote is so cool - it's got a QWERTY keyboard on the back!  It comes with 2 pairs of 3D glasses - one premium and one regular - both work well and are comfortable.  If I had the choice I'd buy the regular glasses, frankly.  It also comes with a high quality cleaning cloth and some really good instructions, if you're not like me and too proud to read them.  I wish this TV had the glowing orange bar in the center of the speaker like other Vizio's.  I guess they felt it took away from the viewing experience, which I guess it could.  This TV relies on picture quality to impress rather than fancy lights anyway.Setup - Installation was a breeze.  The stand was easy to put on, and the rest of setup was cake.  There are plenty of inputs/outputs for this TV.  I particularly like the optical audio out for a flawless connection to my audio system.Menus/Interface - The menus on this TV are incredible.  Absolutely the best menu system I've ever used on any electronic item.  They are intuitively laid out, with high quality, smooth graphics and text.  It really makes the TV feel like a high end item.  You can tweak all kinds of settings - it has a full five band equalizer for the audio, you can rename inputs to coherent names instead of remembering which input is which, etc.  It is just filled with genius little touches.  For example, when you mute many other TV's, and then press volume down, it turns the sound back on and then proceeds to lower the volume from it's starting point.  This TV lowers the volume, but keeps it muted.  So if you mute the TV and need the volume to resume at a lower level than before, it can be done.Apps - Unfortunately this TV uses Yahoo's Connected TV apps, which are scarce.  It has the staples, like Pandora, Netflix, Hulu Plus (which curiously you can't use without registering/paying), Amazon videos, etc.  It doesn't have a web browser or a YouTube app (although it does have a \"web videos\" app with which I don't have much experience).  The interface for the apps is great, so my blame falls squarely on Yahoo.  The apps seem somewhat neglected.  The Facebook app is difficult to use and not intuitive at all.  The Pandora app plays music after you close it and demands to occupy the screen while its playing.  The TuneIn Radio app has trouble connecting to a lot of the stations it lists.  Long story short, the internet apps are a great concept, but I'm hoping a few of them will be receiving updates soon.  Either way, this wasn't a primary reason I bought this TV, so it's not of the utmost concern.  And still, it's pretty cool to be able to listen to Pandora or check my Facebook from my TV.Sound - The speakers are good for a TV, but they're still very weak.  They sound comparable to an inexpensive soundbar without a subwoofer.  As I said before, the TV has a five band equalizer, so one can adjust the settings to his heart's content, which is very important to me as a tech junkie.  But still, if you're going to use it for anything other than watching the Weather Channel, do yourself a favor and invest in an audio system if you don't already have one.  It's silly to watch a movie on such a jawdropping TV with weak sound.Picture - The picture is perfect for this TV.  Absolutely perfect.  As other reviewers have said, it's almost unreal looking.  Sitcoms look like you're looking through a window in the studio audience.  Seriously, it's that good.  The 120Hz irons out motion blur in sports.  I just wish my cable provider could give us content that would actually take advantage of the specs.  Blurays are unbelievable.  Video games are sublime.  The picture requires very little tweaking out of the box to make it look its best.  I am completely and utterly satisfied with the picture of this TV, and that is BY FAR the most important aspect.3D - The passive 3D on this TV is great.  It works, and it works well.  Playstation games and movies look very, VERY smooth, without the typical \"flickery\" nature of other 3D screens I've seen.  In fact, this is the first 3D TV I've viewed that doesn't give me a headache.  I'm usually the guy pulling off the glasses in the Imax theater.  Speaking of glasses, the fact that this TV is passive 3D is great.  The glasses are light, comfortable, and relatively cheap.  I bought two more (in addition to the two that came with it) a few weeks into owning it, and the beauty of these TV's is that to my knowledge, any passive 3d glasses will work with it.  They're not proprietary.  I got a good deal on a set of 2 pairs of LG glasses, and they work great with the Vizio TV.  Now everybody can watch me play Gran Turismo in 3D!  Not that they would want to, but they could...Overall, I'm thrilled with this TV.  It's got some minor hiccups with the apps, but other than that, it is flawless.

Ghosting does occur if your not in the 'sweet spot' (5 to 7 feet away with about 30 degree angle from the center of the screen giving you an optimal viewing area of about 20 square feet and an acceptable viewing area of about 60 square feet). As a 2D set this TV is incredible. The salesmen did say that 3D TV's (both active and passive) were better than 2D TV's for 2D picture. Even my wife who is not an avid 3D fan admits that the 3D experience is amazing with this set. We already had a Sony 3D Blu Ray player and purchased a 3D Blu Ray disc of an Imax film about Egypt ('Mummies - Secrets of the Pharaohs') as a nice demo disc, and you feel like you are there. With a couple other 3D titles and more on the way, we will soon have a nice little collection of some great 3D titles. Hope some classic 3D titles come soon, like \"Dial M for Murder\", \"House of Wax\", and \"Kiss Me Kate\". If you happen to have a Fuji W3 3D camera, you'll be pleased that you can plug in the camera for an enjoyable 3D slide show of your own pictures or 3D home movies.9/24/2011Now I've had this TV a little longer, and I am even more pleased. This displays my 3D home movies from the Fuji W3 3D Camera like I never dreamed possible. Buy this TV (or one of its bigger brothers) if you have the W3. We watched \"How to Train Your Dragon\" last weekend; the experience was as good as the theater. I am not sorry I went with this size although I originally thought I might want larger.

This rep, WADE, told me \"YES it does.\"  With his position at Vizio, he's suppose to be informative and relay this information to the potential customer.  So, I ordered this TV.  Upon setting up the TV, I inserted my USB thumb drive, with many .MPO images on it,  Seems those .MPO's don't show up.So, I called, AGAIN, to Vizio customer support telephone line.  Spoke to ZACK.  After a couple of minutes on hold (he must have actually done his \"homework\" and looked up my question on his script for this model) he informed me .MPO is NOT possible as this TV doesn't support this format.Seems Vizio's customer support's left hand doesn't know what the right hand's doing!!!!!!!!!!!!So, for those who might be interested in viewing their personal 3D pictures from their twin lens camera or downloading .MPO's from the Interenet for viewing on a 3D TV, forget Vizio.

Once I said this I have to say that this set is well worthy its price, specially if you are into stereoscopic (3D) quest. That thing about huge ghosting I can bet is because that person is very close to the TV (3ft to 5ft) so if you are that close, small variations in your position/alignment to TV would produce ghosting because at short distance the angle of view increase when you move compared to your distance to it when is longer. However, by keeping certain distance from TV would reduce the ghosting effect if you move. I also have the 47\" version of the TV ad obviously size help but the mechanics behind ghosting effect is the same. Obviously,with 47\" you can keep further away from TV without suffering lost in detail and helping better to avoid ghosting. Since this TV is based on passive technology when you use it as a PC monitor you might feel a little awkward by perceiving tiny lines (division) between each row, it gets bad when you are in 3D mode on and trying to read regular text like for instance from a browser. Now for stereoscopic game I have to say that this is a very cheap solution considering screen size, cost of glasses and the fact that you do not need to invest in technology/parts for your computer. Nevertheless you still need to spend some dollars in your 3D driver/software, for instance Tridef (DDD). Yes, there is input lag on this SET when using as a PC monitor, I am not sure if that also happens via RGB since I have not used it that much. So it is not very recommendable to use it for multiplayer online gaming, specially if you are in competitive mode, even though still is playable I would dare to say that this input lag would equal something around 200ms which is not catastrophic neither recommendable. This happen even in GAME mode ON. One thing that I noticed on gaming (not online) is that the surround sound of this TV is great. I usually play with 5.1 Psyko Carbon headset but they are big and heavy so when I get tired and do not want to use my 5.1 receiver I switch to TV speakers on surround mode and the effect like i said is great. Do not expect a big punch or bass I am just talking about the 5.1 simulation. I also use it with two more 27\" monitors for Eyefinity set up. If you align them at the right distance you can keep the same screen ratio, like they were the same size. Since this is not a PC monitor I needed to tweak a lot my monitors to compensate color variation so you can still see some difference in Eyefinity mode but not too much for complaining. IMO the only cons is that most of the time you will not play in multiplayer with this set.

When I mirrored my MacBook Pro, the mouse was off by less than half a second, but visible. To correct this there is a game mode setting for the inputs. I encourage you select this option.It is also noteworthy that the 3D effect does not work at wide viewing angles.

Honestly I am a little bit nervous for the low price and resulted in low quality in 3D before I ordered it.  I ordered it by 2 days shipping.  I was so surprised that 3D quality is amazingly excellent.  I could not find anything that I can not be satisfied. I am near sighted,so the polarized glass will need to wear correctly to get the best result.  I found that you need to watch 3D in the right position as described in the manual to get the best results, but it won't bother me.  My daughters sit beside me still have a good 3D quality. It is a LCD TV so it is not as bright as LED type. But I do not like bright TV, so I like it. I connect TV via PS3.  I need to press 3D mode on the remote control panel if I want to watch 3D movie or play games on PS3.  I order a v1.4 HDMI Cable for 3D connection because someone claims in the review needed.

Turns out though, after a year of having this TV, I have only watched 4-5 3D movies.  It didn't end up being worth it. I think it would be more for someone who has children that could appreciate the 3D display. it has a great picture quality, much better than the samsung I have in the bedroom. I've seen some reviews about using it for gaming, I do not do that however, but for basketball and football season, the boys don't complain.the speakers are ok on their own, but recently I had it hooked up to surround sound for a much better quality sound.but my biggest problem with this tv, since day one has been the apps. i just ignored it at first because I never the tv that much when i lived alone, which was my own fault now I see. but then I moved in with my boyfriend and his roommate, a year later, they watch TV. But now my warranty is expired. The apps are incredibly slow.  It takes forever for the Vizio app page to open. Amazon is slow to open and change between pages when you are searching for something to watch.  I end up never using the Pandora app and use my computer or phone instead to listen to music.  Although the sound on the tv would be of much better quality, I just would rather not deal with the frustration.Netflix is by far the worst thing to watch on this tv. I'm cringing right now just thinking about it.  If i even get it to load, it is a miracle.  Usually the screen will come up with the message saying that it cannot connect to my wifi... when our roommate, who's room is further away from the router than the TV is, has excellent connectivity.  The Network Settings say that everything is working fine but Netflix still gives us grip.  We remove all the memory, try it again, and about the third time is when it usually freezes the TV completely.  I mean nothing works, not even the remotes or the buttons on the side of the TV.  At that point, we have to crawl underneath the tv stand to unplug it and plug it back in, in order to use it again.  I've been reading a ton of reviews online about this same model and it seems it is a very common problem.  One would think that Vizio would offer to fix it, since their troubleshooting on the website does nothing to fix it.I've also read that the remote seems to completely die after 1-2 years, which would make sense why mine seems to just stop working sometimes.

Vizio sent out a repair guy to take a look at it that had no experience with 3D tvs and didn't fix anything.  I put in a second call with Vizio to have them come out again and they sent out the same two guys with the same part.  The person that did the write up was not the guys that did the service work and what was put into the system was a lie.  When I talked to the manager of the guys that came out, he treated me very poorly and talked down to me the whole time even though I clearly had a better understanding of the technology than him. I called Vizio again but because what was put into the system was a lie, they stopped helping me and treated me like I didn't know what I was talking about.  Next time I buy a TV, I will be buying it from a big box store so that I can bring it in to exchange and I doubt I will but a Vizio again.2. The boot time is a bit outrageous.

It was still under warranty so someone came out and replaced the circuit board. The 32 inch broke after 13 months so Vizio of course wants nothing to do with it. The thing about it too is that it's in a bedroom and was only used an average of one hour per night. It probably would have still been under warranty except that we didn't have an outlet where we wanted the tv to go when we first bought it, so it sat around in it's box for 6 weeks.

It's basically something you have to work around and push buttons on 3-4 times to get it to work.  The keyboard is a joke.  It doesn't work almost at all if you block the sensor and you have to get up anyway to get close enough to use it or the remote in general.  Because the keyboard is annoying, a lot of internet apps are really painful to set up.

At this time is was sol/shipped by Amazon - now its 3rd parties. This is the 2011 model which retailed for $999.  It was highly rated in some magazines/sites listings as a product of the year or best buy for it's low price point in 2011.The TV works great, the picture is bright clear & the 120 MHz refresh rate keeps up with fast action sports even in 3D.  The more expensive 2012 model went to 240 MHz .  Maybe that helps with intense gaming but I'm not a gamer.  The menus are easy to follow and setup is a breeze.  There is a large amount of ever expanding apps for the smart TV Wi-Fi usage.  The remote is very friendly with quick links buttons to Netflix, Amazon Prime and user defined options.  Flip it over and it is a full keyboard to enter information with.3D is stunning and easy to use.  ALTHOUGH frankly I thought that I would use it more.  My Comcast cable has 2 fulltime 3D stations & 3D shows on demand.  But it is nice to have.  Love the TV - NO complaints.BUT - the Amazon listing is misleading.  It states that this 47\" TV has a viewable area of 49.96\".  Even some of the reviews boast that TV it is really a 50\" TV for the price of a 47\" TV.  That is just WRONG.  The Vizio website along with my own measurements confirm that the Viewable area is 46.96\" NOT 49.96\".I complained to Amazon customer service after I received and installed the TV.  Their initial response was that I could return the TV and they would give me an additional credit of $50 to offset the cost of having the TV mounted.  I objected to the offer, kept the TV and was given a credit of $76 to compensate me for the 3\" size difference.  The said that they would take down the listing for the TV and correct it but never have.Even that this is a 2011 model IF I could get a good deal on it I might buy it again today.  I'd have to compare what else is out there and the features on them.  I noticed that the price is much higher than the $599 I paid in Nov 2012 yet this is another year older.  I don't understand this - but compare it with other sites and models.  IF this is comparable to the best deal you can get I would recommend this because it is a GREAT TV.", "Date": "May 28, 2013"}, {"Title": "Paul Locatelli  Tulsa, Ok", "Author": "paul locatelli", "ReviewID": "R4KC38A8X50GW", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This TV is a whole lot more than just 3d!

I didn't find that obvious and assume it's a result of an update.  The apps all updated immediately upon connecting the wireless.Unfortunately though the Amazon internet app is clunky.  There is no way to search the Amazon Prime streaming videos and you just have to keep paging through them until you find something you like.  Amazon has the watch list now that you can add movies to so that you can find them easier but that function is not on the internet app on the TV (or on my blu-ray).

We wanted it in time for Christmas, and they shipped it right out. It arrived with extra packaging added to ensure that it wouldn't be damaged in shipping.I was interested in having the 3D TV for our bedroom, so the smaller size is perfect for in there. The picture quality of the TV is really good for regular viewing. And the sound is perfect for a bedroom setting. The 3D experience is amazing, with objects seemingly coming out of the screen to where they seem almost touchable. Two sets of glasses come with the TV, but I also have two more pairs that I saved from the movie theater. All work great.Setting up the TV was easy, and we easily connected it to our wireless router for an internet connection. That enables us to watch Netflix and other such streaming offerings. We also purchased a blu ray DVD player for the best experience in playing 3D movies. The remote is easy to operate.The one problem I found was obtaining 3D movies. I can't find any place that rents them. Netflix has begun streaming in 3D, but finding 3D content that is worth watching is difficult. Our cable company offers pay-per-view movies in 3D, but there are only a handful at any given time and now we have the cost of an additional cable box plus the cost of renting the movie. So I ended up having to purchase a few movies, which is no more expensive per movie than paying for the cable box and having to rent movies. We will watch them and then sell them back through Amazon when we are finished. I have petitioned Redbox about renting 3D movies. If you want accessibility to 3D movies, you should contact Netflix and Redbox about renting the DVDs. Still, I'm very happy to have the capability of watching 3D on the rare occasions when we can, and the TV for the price is great even if it didn't have 3D.I am leaving additional comments here about the seller, because Amazon only allows seller feedback within 90 days of purchase. But Electronics 101 was so helpful and cooperative, that they must be applauded. After purchasing, I found that another company was selling the TV for a bit less. While the price difference wasn't that great, it meant being able to purchase a less expensive, but more expansive, Square Trade warranty plan for the lower price range. I contacted Electronics 101 and they refunded the $26 difference in price. But to be able to purchase the warranty, I needed an invoice showing the lower price. The one listed on Amazon still showed the original price with a notation of a refund at the bottom, but I needed one that gave the TOTAL as the lower price. E101 attempted to fax me a new one several times over several days, but for some reason the fax wouldn't go through. So while they were in a very busy season and must have been tired of hearing from me asking favors by then, they gave no indication of being anything but helpful and supportive and took the time to scan the invoice in so that they could attach it to an email for me.......and also mailed out a copy. Hopefully, this feedback will bring them a new customer or two.

Noack", "ReviewID": "R2DACJE5IOAEEK", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "After having this TV for almost a year, it's flaws become pretty apparent. The TV is perfect except for the following things.1) Sometimes the letter buttons on the reverse side of the remote will just stop working. So if you are using the built in YouTube, you might find that you have to manually use the arrows to go to each letter on the screen even though you have all these letter buttons on your remote. They just randomly don't work sometimes.2) Netflix is fine, but YouTube and other apps have serious difficulty streaming for extended periods of time. Even on a 50mbit internet connection, the TV can't seem to buffer the video far enough into the future, and videos play extremely choppy. But this seems to happen more on the 3rd or 4th video you watch, almost like the older videos are being stuck in cache somewhere and now the cache is full, so quitting the app and reloading it makes it better for another two videos... it just seems like they didn't test their included Apps. Maybe this app is provided by YouTube and not vizio, but it is still a part of the TV.3) Automatic volume adjust doesn't work after awhile... the volume will be great, and then sometimes the volume auto adjust feature that is supposed to maintain a constant volume on all content gets screwy, and the volume goes up and down and up and down and up and down while watching movies or videos. Extremely annoying. It can be rectified by either turning the Smart Volume off, or resetting to factory defaults (but then it may randomly return). Turning the Smart volume off would be fine, except when you do this, you may find for certain videos or movies, you will turn the tv volume all the way up to 100% and it will still be quieter than it was when the smart volume was working at 30 or 40%. Basically, your overall maximum volume is seriously reduced. I would say this is the most annoying issue of all with this TV, and if I had known this before hand, I would not have purchased this TV unless I had also purchased a separate audio system.4) About once every 2 months the TV just completely freezes, won't turn off or on until you unplug it. Something about the software on the TV I guess, just has some kind of error and if you are watching TV at the time, the picture gets stuck, and the buttons stop working. You need to unplug the TV and plug it back in. Sometimes it happens when the TV is off, and you can't turn the TV on until you unplug it and plug it back in. This happens without rhyme or reason, but it is rare. Still, it is very annoying when it does happen.5) 3D auto detect is a little poor. It detects fine with certain things like PS3 games, but other things like streaming movies it doesn't detect so well. I'm not sure if other TVs are better at this. It could be a fault of the source.Otherwise, this is a pretty nice TV. I do think it was worth the price at the time I bought it, it was very cheap for the included features.

I decided to return it for the following reasons. As a TV, the 3D picture was very nice but there simply isn't much programming to watch on DirecTV. I thought the ESPN 3D channel would show all of the big games live but that wasn't the case. All you see are old games. Who wants to watch games when you already know who won? And the other 3D channel showed mostly documentary types of shows. There is absolutely nothing new in 3D programming. I had no idea there was really nothing new to watch - boo! Also, the picture didn't turn on right away when you press the \"on\" button. I think that is because the TV has to connect to the internet which creates a delay of up to 10 seconds - not good. And the remote control didn't seem to respond correctly when changing volume levels. Too often it just refused to change the volume. So there were a few problems both with the TV and definitely with the paucity of 3D programming.As a computer monitor, it actually worked fairly well in 2D but I couldn't get the 3D to work right. I downloaded some software from NVIDIA and then pushed some buttons to get it to play 3D games but no luck. Also, I realized 32\" is too big for a computer monitor - it was giving me a headache.If you are a gamer and/or 3D BluRay movie user, I imagine it would work very well and satisfy those needs and I think my PS3 could do the job. However, for regular TV watching in 3D there simply isn't anything to watch. I've read newer TVs will all have 3D capability in a few years and you won't even need special glasses.

I finally bought the Vizio E3D320VX on Amazon. What an incredible picture and price for a TV that is Full 1080p HD, 200,000:1 contrast ratio, 3D, Internet TV with built in Wi-Fi and unlimited apps, 2 HDMI ports in back and 1 on the side; USB; It was $299 on Black Friday 2012. I was kicking myself in 2011, when I didn't buy a 720p, but now I am SO glad that I waited. This was a smart purchase. I am a disabled, female and this was an easy set up for me to do alone. It even comes with real tools for assembly and (albeit not the best) 2 pair of 3D glasses (nice touch)...but I haven't watched anything in 3D, so for me, it's not an issue. Make sure to purchase HDMI cable that support 3D technology or you won't be able to use that feature with Blu-Ray or other devices. I found some cables that supported 3D technology, audio return and Ethernet on Amazon for $9.99 from Mediabridge on Amazon. I have this TV in my bedroom. I had to exchange my DVR at the cable company for a HD model in order to get HD...but that was free. The picture is VIVID and crystal clear. I am confined to this room much of the day for medical reasons and the TV is on most of the time. My sports nut husband loves the picture settings that adjust for every kind of sport. I didn't need a sound bar, its plenty loud with 2 10Watt speakers. I will admit, that when setting it up, initially, I couldn't figure out how to get to the keypad to enter my WiFi info. I am not one to read instructions and even when I read the instructions, it was not explained. It took me a few minutes and finally I realized that you have to press the OK button to get the Keypad and just use the arrows around it to navigate. There is also a button on the remote with the Vizio symbol, press that for all of your internet apps. I have my log-in for Netflix programmed and using that is a piece of cake. Your choices for apps are unlimited with internet TV. It has great Energy Savings. The only negative that I have found is that it is not instant on...it takes about 5 secs, before a picture is available. For this TV, I can wait 5 seconds.

I had read a few reviews from the technology web sites that gave this TV average to above average reviews so I was hesitant.  Their main complaint being the 2d picture quality, notably lack of deep blacks.  Then I came on here on saw a lot of great reviews on Amazon from regular users, so I decided to pull the trigger on this.  So glad I did!I actually got mine for $588, heck of a bargain.The screen is stunning...2d, 3d, whatever.  I am coming form a 42\" plasma TV that has a pretty dang sharp picture (720p) and great blacks and contrasts.  This has just as good or better picture quality...well, in fact better because its 1080p with 120 refresh.  Contrasts, colors and black levels all seem supurb to me, and very customizable. Mind you, I am not a \"videophile\" by any means.  Right out of the box the picture seemed a little dark to me, it was a snap to go into the settings and choose another picture mode...I scrolled thru them all and chose \"golf\" as my favorite.  It was as easy as that...it's a bit brighter and vivid to me than \"standard\".Took me twenty minutes to get the thing unboxed, set up and completely connected.  I am a network administrator with 20 years of electronics experience though lol.Easy to use menus, easy to configure, easy to use remote...although I must add that sometimes the remote seems to be slow, or take more than one push of a button to get it to respond.  Will keep my eye on that.  Not the fastest boot-up time when powering on but that's not an issue for me.Already tested 3d with a movie off my PC and some short clips on YouTube...looks awesome, although like earlier reviews have noted, there is a somewhat limited viewing range for best results.All in all I feel that I made a wonderful purchase...I have no regrets whatsoever.

Just be aware if you order from Dell the shipping arrival date they give you (which was supposed to be 7 days) is only when it arrives in your area. Then the company they use- Pilot calls you to make an appointment to deliver to your home, and their next available appointment might be a couple of days after that.

The cardboard box face had a hole in it where something had punctured it & had broken the screen.  There is no foam protection on the screen side of the box, so perhaps it was damaged at the warehouse or while being shipped.

Thought it was going to be a steal. Sadly that's not the case, main issue being it only takes RGB cables or HDMI's, there's no support for RWY cables (which is shown in the product images) which my Dish only supports. It also takes the antenna but the quality is nothing but fuz. Apart from that I have a surround sound setup but it connects to the tv via RW cables which, once again, isn't supported, despite the product pictures again. Since I opened the box Amazon won't take it back and it's completely useless to me. Disappointed.EDIT: So I've had my TV for almost a couple months now and I gotta say I love it now. Thanks to MINDSCI, the reasons I originally was disappointed with the product have been resolved. The price for the size (42\")and capabilities are pretty hard to beat.The TV has 3 HDMI ports, a component cable section, an aux out port, an ethernet, pc, optical cable port, 2 usb ports and an antennae port. The original issue was that my DISH only supported the composite cables which was shown in an image for the product, which I still don't know why it's shown, maybe it's available on a bigger screen, and I had no idea how to connect my composite cables to the component input section, which all you have to do is put the white and red cable in their appropriate sections and plug the yellow cable into the green cable and wa-la, let there be image! And I gotta say, the quality's pretty good, not the best, but still good, nothing compared to the antennae, which was once again nothing but fuzz.The second issue was that the images, once again, showed a composite audio section in which my surround sound receiver supported and the TV itself only had an aux out port but, not really thinking about it before, I had a composite to aux port converter and wa-la, let there be sound! Great sound I might add.So now that my initial issues are resolved let me actually review the TV: fantastic! The size is perfect for my room, although I'm considering a 47\" now, and the quality of the tv is pretty great too. Screen is a flat matte finish, non gloss, so non glare/reflection, which is great, and the sides of the tv are pretty thick so it's a pretty bulky set, which in a way makes it seem cheaper, but that doesn't bother me much. The sound and visual settings are completely customizable which are always a must, and the tv allows you to set profiles, so every profile has different saved settings, but I don't use that much..or not at all really. The control it comes with was my favorite part at first, has a standard front side with quick links to Netflix, Amazon Prime and M-Go, which I only really use Netflix, and pressing the Vizio icon in the center brings up different launchers such as Hulu Plus, Flickr, YouTube, Pandora, etc. The only issue I'm having though is that every time I try to log into Facebook, I get an error saying my username name and password are incorrect, which I know they're not, so I don't know if there's a fix for that. Now the back of the remote has fully functional keyboard including arrows and the RGBY buttons, which is a major plus because typing using arrows alone are a HUGE hassle. Last but not least, the 3D, simply AMAZING. The best part by far and the biggest plus/reason for purchasing, it takes the passive glasses that you can get at theaters, which is fantastic because who doesn't have those lying around?So overall, VERY pleased with TV set , especially for the price once again,and I would definitively recommend to anyone looking for an affordable 3D TV.", "Date": "January 26, 2013"}, {"Title": "Remote function issue & Tv was refurbished (not disclosed) thus no warranty according to Visio", "Author": "troy kinne", "ReviewID": "R2J8ICXUXTFUJI", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "Tv was purchased as a new TV through Amazon but when I call Visio to get assistance for a remote that is not functioning I am told there is no warranty because the TV was originally sold by Walmart and then returned.

But the movies like spiderman and avengers is awesome viewing.", "Date": "January 6, 2013"}, {"Title": "3 Months with VIZIO E3D470VX 47-Inch 3D HDTV", "Author": "MINDSCI", "ReviewID": "R2D644ABK2V58D", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "*Update 2-8-13: The E3D470VX is available for $599 on Vizio's website*I have had my VIZIO E3D470VX 47-Inch 3d HDTV for 3 months now and have used EVERY feature... It's Rock solid so far. With a 200,00:1 DCR the Vizio is at or very near LED HDTV performance levels! Moreover, an examination of the Vizio's Advanced Picture adjustments eludes to the amount of thought and effort Vizio has put into maximizing the picture quality of the E3D Series LCD HDTVs.The picture is beautiful with excellent black level, white level, and color. It has tons of intuitive picture adjustability. It also has plenty of audio adjustments and an EQ, but I rarely use it as my Vizio's audio plays through a 5.1 digital surround system. Meanwhile, the ambient light sensor can be shut off. Titanic 3D is amazing, and Dredd 3D was very cool too. Dredd 3D in particular really pops with in your face 3D effects during the SloMo 3D scenes. For 3D I set the picture to VIVID; Backlight at 100;  with the Adaptive Lumina on Extended and the Advanced Backlight Control set to OPC (both in the Advanced Picture Menu). As such, there isn't a noticeable loss in brightness. As a result, Prometheus 3D was actually better at home on the E3D470VX than it was in the theater, seriously! I have also watched the 3D content that was available thru the VIA (Vizio Internet Apps) and Sony's content; it is quite impressive too.Wired/Wireless Streaming Performance:Both wired and wireless performance are great. I have CenturyLink Internet and a TP-Link Router with 5 ethernet devices connected: TP-Link WL RT TD-W8960N 300M WL-N. The Vizio streams Netflix Amazon Prime and VuDu great.  Even lower resolution streamed content looks exceptionally good. I can't stress enough just how exceptionally good the Streaming performance is. The Vizio E3D470VX's picture is the best I have seen for Streaming at lower resolutions. I have Centurylink with which the internet speed is too low to stream at HD resolutions, yet the picture is better than DVD quality. I sit with my eyes 7 feet from the screen, and the picture is clean with no visible pixelation, blockiness or patchiness.Remote Control:My remote has been working just fine. It is not too small, and I have big hands. The QWERTY keys are easy to press, and they have a nice positive \"clicky\" response and feel. In addition, the QWERTY keyboard makes it so quick to find content during searches. This is especially helpful in the Amazon Instant Video App that is nowhere near as good as the Netflix one. An unexpected plus is that the rubbery QWERTY keys allow that side of the remote to grip recliner armrests and tables. Additionally, the remote is heavy and has a good build quality as does the TV. Unfortunately, the remote is not backlit. It is a no brainer that a backlit remote should be standard, but sadly virtually all HDTVs come without that feature. Consequently, I ended up getting a Vizio 8-Device full backlit remote for $20 VIZIO 8-DEVICE UNIVERSAL REMOTE CONTROL (XRU300) as I mostly watch in a very darkened room. It mostly has the same buttons as the included remote including the same large silver VIA button, but it lacks a QWERTY keyboard and dedicated buttons for Netflix and Amazon Instant Video.LCD (CCFL) and LED Backlighting considerations:The picture on the E3D470VX is as good as it gets for any LCD HDTV, and I am a Videophile and Blu-Ray movie junkie, so performance is paramount to me. I went with LCD over LED because some LED TVs still in the market are experiencing problems with banding (all brands) as it is sometimes referred to. The newest Edge lit units seem to have resolved the problem, but you are still paying a \"premium\" for \"LED\". Banding can also occur with poorly designed CCFL Backlit LCD HDTVs too. Banding is an artifact of LED edge lit LCD HDTV's which the vast majority of LED TVs are. If one is looking at a scene which is white or uniformly bright it appears as cloudy bands, lines or blocks indicating un-uniform backlighting of the screen. Some reviewers here have posted photos of Banding problems with their E3D Series Vizio HDTVs, but those appear to be source related from what I can tell. I have experienced no such issues with mine.Meanwhile, a notable number of LG, Sony, Samsung, Panasonic, and some Vizio LED units still in the market: VIZIO M3D460SR 46-Inch 1080p LCD TV (Black)have been failing from power supply capacitor problems. Power Supply Capacitor problems have plagued the  Flat Panel industry for years, and continues as OEMs try to cut costs by sourcing cheaper components. Vizio uses Samsung and LG components for some of its models (the 47\" E3D470VX appears to have a LG screen). However, Vizio's main technology partner is Amtran Technology a respected ODM/OEM company. Vizio teams design their TVs and then get them built by those they judge to be the best available contractors for each design (see the JD Powers awards). In addition, Vizio is an AMERICAN company, so the profits stay here.Importantly, LCD TV Tech is quite mature and at its very best. An LED TV might have a longer lifespan and deeper blacks. However, LCD TVs have around a 50,000-70,000 hour lifespan which could work out to 8 years if it's on 24hr per day. Furthermore, the E3D470VX has very good  Black Levels & Dynamic Contrast Ratio that have many adjustable aspects too. In fact, Black Levels and Contrast etc. are so customizable that I consider it a huge plus. It enables me to tweak the picture so that I am not forced to sacrifice shadow/dark-scene detail while achieving very nice Black Levels at the same time.Connectivity:4 HDMI's are a must with my setup. I have it paired with a Sony BDP-S590 3D Blu-ray Disc Player with Wi-Fi (Black) that also has wifi and internet apps. The Sony also has DLNA so I can access PC based content on my Vizio (the E3D Series do not have native DLNA). The Sony BDP-S590 has 2D-3D conversion too. The E3D470VX is also hooked up to a magnavox 2D Blu-ray player: Magnavox NB500MS9 Blu-ray Disc Player, a Phillips upscaling DVD player, and as an HDMI monitor for a 6-core dual SLI videocard Gaming/Home Theater PC too. Meanwhile, do note that the Vizio only has Digital Optical Out (no Coaxial Digital), so I got a: Toslink-to-coaxial Rohs to run the audio via: Forza-700 Series 40756 Digital Coaxial Audio Cables (2 M) through an \"Ambery '4-Port Component Composite Video Switch + Digital S/PDIF Stereo Audio Switcher w/ remote'\" and a \"Ambery '1 In 3 Out HD Component Video RGB RGBHV Splitter ~ High 480Hz bandwidth'\". These feed full Digital Coaxial 3D DTS 5.1 and Dolby Digital 5.1 to a pair of JVC RX-5060B Digital 5.1 Channel Receivers with Digital Soundfield Processing: JVC RX-5060B - AV receiver - 5.1 channel - black, a Phillips Digital 5.1 Channel HT in a box, and a 5.1 x 3 speaker surround setup.I got my VIZIO E3D470VX 47-Inch at Walmart because I couldn't afford to get mine through Amazon (Preferred). Layaway allowed me to pay for it over 4 months. I did get a $70 zero deductible 3 year extended warranty too.IMHO this was absolutely the most, and best, bang for the buck for a high end Smart WIFI 3D HDTV, and I  bought mine largely to get 3D and Internet video streaming. The build quality of the Vizio appears to be top notch. At the same time, the Vizio Internet Apps could be better, but this may get improved with a firmware update.  I watched the reviews over several months before getting mine. The VIZIO E3D470VX 47-Inch and its siblings have the highest positive ratings on Amazon and Walmart with great reviews (1,000+ reviews). There is a reason it is virtually sold out online and in stores. I had shopped all the major brands for months for both LCD and LED models, but nothing else compared, especially in the Vizios price range. So far I have not been disappointed. Amazon Marketplace still has the E3D470VX and it looks like Walmart and DELL might still have some. If you can still find one get it; it is great!Finally, much thanks to all those that have written such informative reviews here on Amazon; it helped tremendously in my decision.", "Date": "January 6, 2013"}, {"Title": "Fantastic TV for a great price!", "Author": "Alli09", "ReviewID": "R1DBTIU3LCSNRN", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "For all the capabilities that this TV has, it's listed at a bargain price.

I purchased it after Christmas and received it in 2 business days. The set-up and internet apps activation process was easy...under 5 mins. The picture is AMAZING! I wasn't sure that 42in would be big enough but it's actually perfect. I haven't tried the 3D settings yet and the sound quality is good enough for me. I have a pair of speakers and a sub-woofer that I usually connect to my computer, and it works wonders on the TV as well.I really feel like I got a little more than my money's worth and I'm loving every minute of it. Anyone who pays $500 and up for a SmartTV without these many options is a sucker. lolI also recommend buying the extended warranty.

It takes 15-20 second to boot the TV.  I was able to use all of the ports easily (Comp/AV, HDMI-1, HDMI-2 and HDMI-Side).  Netflix app has issue that has nothing to do with the TV.  Netflix has a solution when you can't connect from this TV.  When the Netflix screen shows up and the connection progress bar doesn't move fast enough you'll end up getting connection error.  As soon as you notice the progress bar isn't moving fast enough start hitting up-up-dn-dn-left-right-left-right-up-up-up-up button in the sequence and the bar will move fast and you'll be able to log into your netflix account.", "Date": "January 3, 2013"}, {"Title": "Love It!!!!!!", "Author": "R.

The picture is just amazing.  I watched my first 3D movie on it last night (Avatar) and I was blown away by the picture.  For the best 3D effect, you do need to be more or less directly in front of it.Pros:1.  Price2.  Picture QualityCons:1.  Wireless setup - I could not get this TV or the 42\" version to connect to my wireless.  I noticed some other reviewers had the same issue.  Luckily I also had CAT5 already ran to these locations.  I didn't have any wireless setup issues with any of my other devices (laptop, tablet and other TVs).2.  The remote is not very responsive.  Sometimes, I'll have to press a key 2 or 3 times to get it to respond.3.  Sound - The equalizer is disabled on this TV and there are no bass and treble adjustments.  As with all the other flat screen TVs, the sound is underwhelming.On another note, I bought this on Amazon through electronics101deals.

Cornell", "ReviewID": "R2RUGJPUSMM0I6", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I got this TV for my two young (4 and 6) kids to watch their cartoons and movies on, and it's SO much better than mine, I'm thinking about trading with them..  Beautiful picture, sound, clear, crisp.  The 3D is great - better than in the movie theaters in my opinion.2 cons -1) I did notice that the darks seem to be very dark.  When watching a movie the other day, I had selected \"movie\" in the pre-formatted modes, and a night scene looked very dark and it was hard to see.  I'll have to play around with the pre-setting mode, maybe it was just me; and2) the remote, partly my fault though.  I read the CNET review of this that said it came with a QWERTY remote (awesome), but when I got the TV and the QWERTY remote was just a flimsy remote with no QWERTY keyboard, I went back to Amazon and at the VERY end of the description is a small note that as of April 2012, there was no QWERTY remote.  Bummer.  The included remote has hard to push buttons that, at times, doesn't seem to register with the TV that I'm pushing a button (particularly the volume buttons).  But, and I LOVE this about the remote - the Amazon and Netflix buttons right on the remote.  No more searching menus, for the young kids, that is great!Other than the remote and some dark issues - I love this TV6 month update - still a pretty good TV andI am still happy with my purchase.  The remote is still annoying.  However, i don't know if it is the remote or not.  It may be the TV itself taking forever to register that a button was pushed. I've noticed that it takes the TV 10-20 seconds to perform the button function (changing the channel/volume, selecting netflix or amazon).  Darks are still dark, I've had to seriously up the brightness level during movies with dark scenes (Transformers, IronMan, Avengers), it dilutes the normal scenes, but at least we can see what is happening in the darker scenes.", "Date": "January 2, 2013"}, {"Title": "Great TV for the price.", "Author": "Tyler \"Carpe diem\"", "ReviewID": "R3C4JVB5NIBKZ9", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I've owned this TV for about 15 months and it's still like the day I got it. Blu rays look amazing on it, as does gaming. I've played through Uncharted 3 and Assassin's Creed III in 3D on this TV and both look really really good. The water in Uncharted looked especially awesome. The 3D didn't hurt my eyes either after hours of playing at a time. I recommend keeping glasses from the theatre if you watch 3D movies there as they're also usable on this TV. The sound on the TV is also decent, but I mostly wear a headset when using the TV so I don't have much of an opinion on it.The only downside is screen bleeding. If the TV is on with nothing connected to it so it's just a black screen, there is very easily noticeable screen bleeding covering about a fifth of the TV, mostly in the corners. However, when I am watching movies and playing games it isn't noticeable at all, even during dark scenes, so I don't find it to be worth docking a star.Overall this tv is very nice. The 3D could be better, namely because it can be blurry at times, but it's still very good for the price.

LED is a slightly better lighting but not  worth the extra $300- Greater than 100000 Dynamic Ratio (tv has 200000) with at least 120Hz refresh rate (60 is too little for such a large tv)- Built in WiFi with SmartTV capability- Very well reviewed and made from reputable manufacturer- Price tag $700 or less (paid $598)- 3D (Was not actually a prerequisite but a gladly unanticipated bonus considering the price)- All required ports being HDMI, USB, RCA, Cable, etcI've been using the tv now for about a month. I'm quite happy with my purchase and do feel I got the best deal out there. The picture quality is good, probably not the best considering the Dynamic Ratio isn't as high as the new Samsungs which are in the millions now. However the quality is very nice with little to no lag due to the refresh rate.The 3D is surprisingly very good. Watched Avatar on it and was amazed.I kind of like the remote. I'm not sure why others dislike it so much. I suppose if there was more distance between the remote and tv the signal might not be very strong. However I don't have this problem. The querty keyboard is a really nice touch.The downfalls:- Takes 10-15 seconds to turn on, however the V logo is rather cool- Sound quality is not the best but is not as bad as I've seen reviewed. Acceptable but will still look in to a home theatre something later on.- The WiFi sometimes requires refreshing. I'll attempt to use a static ip and see if this solves the problem.- Despite it saying that .mp4 videos are supported, this does not appear to be true. I've tried several .mp4 movies with no success until converting to .avi which work just fine. I'm not sure what other codecs are supported but if mp4 isn't I'm pretty sure others like divx, xvid, and mkv won't be either. A bit of an inconvenience but definitely not a deal breaker.Setting up the tv is very simple and is light enough that I did it without assistance.

Now to the functionality:1. Picture quality... I know CNET doesn't give this a high rating, but I think the quality is outstanding. You have to do a little tweaking to get it to what you like it to be and for your room conditions, but it is very easy to do. Just remember that you will have to do the same for the various inputs (cable, game consoles, Blu Ray etc.).2. The Apps are great. Netflix, Youtube and Amazon load very fast. I wish the Amazon app was easier to scroll through but overall the convenience of having the apps on your TV instead of having to stream from another device is outstanding. The Crackle App is a little slow but I don't use it too often anyway. Netflix is excellent as is Youtube. One thing to note on Youtube is that I think it won't play some copyrighted material. Specifically music videos. Not sure why this is the case.3. I have heard complaints about the remote, but I received the double sided one with the QWERTY keyboard which works great. Yes, it isn't backlit but other than that I find it quite simple to use.4. The 3D quality is excellent. If you want to feel how good it is, watch a 3D video on youtube, something like Avatar. You will immediately see how rich the 3D experience is.5. The sound is fine for normal use. For movies and games, I pipe it through the home theater, but otherwise the TV speakers work just fine.6. The power usage is very low. It shuts off completely when off so takes about 5 seconds to start up, but I think that is just fine in order to use less energy when turned off.I mounted it on the wall and with the VideoSecu mount it was very easy to do.So far I have not found anything to complain about with the TV and I highly recommend it to anyone interested in purchasing a full featured TV.", "Date": "December 19, 2012"}, {"Title": "Fantastic TV", "Author": "Edward P Krivis", "ReviewID": "RBYGU8MLCV6R", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "We all love this new TV.

In addition, I felt that a tv with internet apps would have a remote with more functions, like a qwerty keyboard. I also find myself having to turn on the bedroom lights to chang channels or adjust the volume because the key layout is not intuitive.I contacted Vizio inquiring about other remote options and discovered that this model tv came with a full qwerty remote up to a month before I purchased it. Mine did not come with one of these. They said that the newer model was not compatible with the  qwerty remote so that was not an option. They said that it doesn't seem like there is anything wrong with my tv and there was nothing they could do to help.

Netflix streamed without issue over a wireless 3Mbps DSL connection. The 1080p provides excellent picture quality with HD channels through DirectTv and blueray movies. I was not originally looking for 3D but I am now a huge fan. I thought picture quality would suffer while viewing movies in 3D but I was wrong. The quality of the picture and the depth that the 3D adds to absolutely amazing for my movie watching experience. I use my PS3 to view the movies and in most cases, you have to let the PS3 and television auto detect the 3D content to get the correct settings. I was very pleased while playing COD Black OPS II in 3D campaign as well. I had a little bit of trouble with this at first but you will get used to it.

Some of the 'issues' that some reviewers had such as not finding an analogue output etc. and the image being too clear (whatever that meant) is no fault of Vizio...its just that some persons do not take the time to do their research and just want to jump into new technology. Here's a reality check - 'Any item that will do multiple functions will need some brains.' In other words, if you are a dummy then the TV will not bode well with you. You will get a soap opera effect but, duh, you have to change the settings in order to get the fantasy effect (Game Mode).Here are a few helpful points from my experience so far:I have a XBOX 360 with kinect and I have played Halo 4, Forza, Dance Central and Kinect Star Wars and the image is fine. No problems.I have the TV hooked up to my stereo via analogue and through the microphone jack. You just need to find the correct adapters to make it work and they are very cheap to buy (about $0.50). I have had one for 7 years. With these you will get a very good surround effect. No need to purchase some expensive home theatre system. And I have listened to the expensive theatre systems and my system is far better sounding.The TV picks up the internet just fine....once you have a good router.I have watched a few movies and at first they were so clean that you can clearly see the soap opera effect but when I changed the settings the image was movie quality.The only downside to this TV is that it is larger than the regular LCD TVs but it is not that big that it will not fit in your living room or on your wall. Besides, its not like you will be going to work with it in your pocket every day and will have to cry out about the 42lbs weight in your pocket. It will either be on a wall or on your TV stand.The shipping was great and the box it came in was very sturdy. Amazon delivered as promised with Prime.As to the life of the TV, I will update every 2 to 3 months on its performance. I do agree with one writer where he said most persons posting were new buyers and I only got this TV a few days ago, so I will update to let you know of the long term performance.Again, this Smart TV (as the box says) is not for Dummies!Update - December 28, 2012Its been one month since I bought the TV and it is still going strong. I had the opportunity to test the 3D and it works excellent. The images are very close to cinema 3D. Also, the TV works great with the internet.

My PC connects directly in (3D won't work when passed through an older non-3D capable receiver) and both it and my X-Box show me a great picture at 1080p with no motion blur or hardware lag time (gaming-related issues that plague some televisions).  I've also enjoyed the convenience of being able to flip straight to YouTube, and if the other built-in apps I haven't tried are the same, the responsiveness (time to load the app) is really fast.  In fact, the only real responsiveness problem I have with the TV is two-fold:1) Turning on or switching inputs can seem slow:  for example, powering up the TV may take 20 seconds before I can see my PC's screen.  I learned to be patient and eventually the picture pops through just fine.2) The backside of the remote has a keypad, but I find there are times it simply doesn't work and when it does respond it can be very slow going typing things in.  Fortunately, I almost never have to use the keypad.My TV connected to the network easily using the built-in wireless:  I was going to use a high-speed Cat 6E cable for Ethernet straight to the router, but there's been no need (I have a LinkSys WRT 610N, by the way):  it uses my 5N network.  There are some customers that had things go screwy after the TV updated itself but I'm pleased to report that hasn't happened for me.With all this, the Visio E3D470VX is a great TV.  the \"Minor Packaging Flaw\" though is quite an annoyance and I hope yours doesn't have this happen.  There is no manual in the package, but the installation instructions say that the unit's stand is attached via a simple thumb-screw in the bottom of the stand that you can tighten.  The manual I downloaded says the same thing.  Unfortunately, what I got instead was no thumbscrew setup, and a stand that requires four screws be screwed into the back of the TV.  No problem...except that there were no screws in the package.  I had to call Vizio's support, and while the guy was smart, polite, and clearly trying to help me, his hands were also a bit tied:  he had to walk through the same manual I did, confirm that I did check the entire box, and was stumped as to why the TV wasn't built the way it was supposed to be.  Eventually he agreed to send me the screws, but I had to hang up with him, wait an hour, call back again, ask someone else to check the system and see if my ticket was in there, and then explain the entire thing to them and ask them to please ship the screws that the first guy requested they ship for me.  The screws arrived 3 days later via FedEx (I had to call on a weekend), and, lo and behold...they weren't right.  In fact, they are identical to the four screws I had in another entirely different Vizio TV that I ordered later (a very different model used in a spare room).  I was lucky because the first person I'd spoken to told me the specs for the screws and I was able to run down to my hardware store and buy my own--but while my hardware-store screws work, they aren't the right size either (see customer images).  This was a really weird way to have to start off with a brand-new TV.I love everything about the TV.  If yours is going to be wall-mounted you won't have to worry about the problem I had...but even so, I don't regret buying the TV.

Even my wife who genrally doesn't notice the difference between HD and SD asked why it looked so much more realistic.Standard Def looks worse, a lot worse, I'm wondering if it's a TIVO setting or just that LCD doesn't bleed/blend in the same plasma did.I tried to watch Cars two with my son in 3D, I bought the 3D version when it came out because I had a $10 coupon making it about the same price as the regular Blu-Ray.  I thought it looked Amazing, my wife said it hurt her eyes, and my son wouldn't keep the glasses on.  (He's almost 4)  So I only watched about 1/2 of it in 3D but I liked it.I had a few games that Play in 3D, on the playstation Wipeout HD looked good but there was a lot of ghosting, where you see double of anything white.  I found it distracting, Super Stardust HD looked good, Ratchet & Clank all for one was a free game from Playstation Plus this month and I hadn't had a chance to play it yet, it looks good in 3D but there were some effects that didn't work and sometimes the screen was noisey with artifacts from bad 3D. Sly Cooper had more subtle 3D but I thought it looked the best of the games I tried on PS3.I then enabled 3D for XBox 360 and played Batman:Arkham City and it looked amazing.  Really the best way to play that game.The netflix app is just like the one on Apple TV, and has a Kid mode.  I tried to teach my 3 year old how to start it and find his own movies.  The old sytem of change the input, turn on the Xbox, PS3 or Apple TV,switch remotes find Moves, Find netflix was too hard for a 3 year old but the one button system on the TV I'm sure he will be able to do in a month or two.I installed the revistion 3 app and the video looked really good, I was having TV download some of the shows but this has all of them, I'll use that a lot.  There are more useful apps than the ones that game pre-installed and there is a limited number you can install, remove services you don't want to pay for by pressing the yellow button first.The TV is half the weight of my old one and 25% bigger but looks alost the same size on the stand.  Sound wasn't any worse than my Panasonic, I have not yet set up the 7.1 speaker system.I also was able to watch some side by side 3D youtube videos in 3D, witch sometimes worked ok, and other times was barely acceptable.WiFi was worthless!  I needed to get some new bolts to mount the TV to the stand I had my Panasonic on but the botlts were different. I set up the TV not near the stand for a while and connected to WiFi and opened Vudu.  I wasn't able to watch a 5 minute short without it stopping even few seconds. Connected to the router was find but Wifi Couldn't stream any video at all.

I ended up buying the sony Htc soundbar to go with it. For the money, I highly recommend that soundbar. I've had some quality bose home audio in the past, and the Sony soundbar comes close to matching that. If you watch any action movies or play any video games, splurge on some speakers, you won't regret it.All in all, very happy with my purchase.  On a side note, I bought the tv \"used\" from Amazon. You could never tell that this thing had ever been opened. When Amazon says like new, it's litterally brand new.  If you can get it used from Amazon, go for it.", "Date": "June 29, 2012"}, {"Title": "VIZIO E3D320VX", "Author": "Ann Velush", "ReviewID": "R1BO4KLIIDOOVU", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This is a fantastic TV and the price is great too.

I went to Best Buy to compare passive verses active glasses and even though the active have better resolution I decided on the passive mostly because the difference in resolution wasn't apparent on a 42 inch TV even if you were a foot from the TV.  The glasses may be less expensive but if the 3D image were poor I wouldn't have hesitated getting the other type.  The reviews on Vizio TVs have been great to poor depending on the model but the reviews on this 3D TV were pretty solid.  After having it for a month I feel it has been a very good purchase.  Color is very good, resolution is fantastic, the sound is fine for the bedroom, however, as with any TV, for the theater effect you'd be better off hooking into a good sound system.  An important point: the movie industry has been working very hard to adapt the 3D imaging system as a standard so my guess is it's here to stay as a format.  What is also as important is that the TV, even if never used for 3D has better and more advanced electronics.  This means it should be usable far into the future and can be updated and given new firmware as needed.  Items you may want to purchase with this are some extra glasses and a 3D compatible HDMI cable.  The cable does make a difference when converting a 2D DVD or Blu-ray to 3D which can be done with certain 3D Blu-ray players.

Got it at WALMART online brand new for 448 bucks, nice right?. Not the 600 from Galaxy via Amazon. Amazon I love you, but Walmart rolled it back too far this time!So far no complaints at all. I'll give an update after i've had the set for a while.Set up was easy, and thank you very much to those of who posted the more techinical aspects for compatibility with gaming systems.The regular HD picture is great. The 3D, like everyone said, is every bit as good as in the theatres. There is some ghosting if you are at the wrong angle (you can't be looking down at the set or you get really bad ghosting. You kind of have to be \"head on\" So for example my set sits on a pedastal on my desk. When i lean back in my desk chair i get slight ghosting so i just (temporarily) put a shim under the back of the set (a game case) to tilt the set forward slightly, ghosting gone.I have used it with both my XBOX 360 and my PS3, no problems. Played Gears of War 3 in 3D and it looked quite good. Unlike another reviewer, i didn't find it necessary to set the PS3 to 720p, it seemed to work fine on 1080p. (under display settings, not video settings)Remember that you have to set game mode (prevents lag) independently for each HDMI input if you have multiple systems. Interestingly, the set automatically switches game mode off when you play a 3D movie on the PS3, it is back on again when the movie is stopped. Interesting....Sound is adequate, but if you want booming then hook it up to a system.Yes, the buttons on the remote are hard to press and some are very tiny. The keyboard on the back is awesome!No problems with the wifi setup, no problems using built in apps, no problems running netflix. I tried the yahoo news app, and it's ok, but nothing to write home about. I haven't downloaded other apps yet. I didn't really buy it because it was internet ready, but still it's nice that is runs the online streaming services.Yes, when it asks you to enable 3D upon detecting a 3D signal you need to act fast or you have to run through the menus (just a minor inconvenience).Games look quite good, I downloaded killzone3 demo for PS3 and it was good, but maybe a bit blocky. Uncharted 3 however look positively stunning. Fast movement sometimes makes things a bit difficult to watch, but i think it's just a 3D thing, i'm not quite sure, but the experience was enjoyable.Watched a bit of Cars2 in 3D, again, absolutely stunning 3D effects, just like in the theatre.Watched some 3D content on direct TV they have like 4 channels including ESPN 3D, very cool. There is another channel that had like etxtreme sports with people doing motocross jumps and i thought i was going to hurl from the 3D effect. Still, very cool. On direct tv you see 3D when watching full screen but it seemlessly swtiches to 2D when you pull up the channel guide. After going back to the channel it takes a couple of seconds, then it's 3D again.the unit has 3 HDMI inputs, one on the side and two on the rear which is nice. All inputs can be given custom labels (pretty standard)All in all (especially only paying 448.00) I can't believe how good this set is for money. Seriously. This television is why I waited before purchasing any 3D equipment. Vizio you did a damn good job! Keep up the good work!I know that some people had technical problems and things that didn't work, but that is always the case with electronics. As the reviews were overwhelmingly positive (you can't please all the people) I thought i'd take the plunge and so far i'm glad that I did!UPDATE!!!Still love the TV but there is one little quirtk. As you know you have to set \"game mode\" to eliminate lag in games. However, even though game mode was on for my xbox I noticed terrible lag for Street fighter (i was losing all the time when i usually don't). I found that I had to disable game mode, then enable it again and voila! no lag....pretty inconvenient, but I disable and enable game mode each time i boot up the xbox just to be certain.", "Date": "November 11, 2011"}, {"Title": "TV", "Author": "Isashar Nagar", "ReviewID": "R1NAKYB8VJH0MO", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Very good TV and for the right price.

I watched Tangled 3D and I only noticed very slight ghosting once or twice, but I think this is the norm for any 3DTV content. Otherwise, watching in 3D is so cool! The colors are vibrant and you will notice that there is much more depth to the picture. You get the impression that you are in the scene with the characters and can reach out and touch things. The app menu is great, because it is easy to navigate and it really does look nice. Also, when you open the app menu you can still see whatever you were watching on the other half of the tv. My favorite app is Vudu, it allows you to rent and buy SD, HD, HDX and 3D HDX movies, streamed directly to the television! Others mentioned that the buttons on the remote are hard to push, but I haven't noticed this. I press the buttons just like I would on a regular remote and it seems to work fine. The only problem I did encounter with the remote was the top of the arrow button getting stuck under the plastic of the remote. It's kind of annoying, but it's easy to pop it back out and resume your browsing.

Sometimes the sound cut out for minutes at a time, and when I went to turn the device on/off, it would not respond for around 30 seconds and then suddenly make a loud popping sound and then turn on/off.I REALLY didn't want to send it back, because - this sucker is SMOOTH. We bought it because it was 3D and had all the apps that were important to us. Our blu-ray player was also defective (imagine that?) so we have yet to watch a 3D or blu-ray movie on it, but what really blew us away with this TV was how SMOOTH the picture is. If you've heard of people saying, \"It looks so real it feels like you're actually there.\" that's it. The very first thing we watched on this TV was an episode of The Walking Dead, a standard definition cable DVR recording no less, and I felt like we were actually ON the set. How creepy is that?When we sent this TV back to Amazon, we used the refund money to buy the same TV at a local Walmart - or so we thought. We were disappointed to find out that it wasn't 3D. That wasn't the only thing different though - the picture just was not as smooth as this TV is. There's not even a smoothing setting. I don't get that eerie feeling that I'm in the movie (which is a really weird feeling when watching all-CGI movies). So we took THAT TV back and ordered this one again on Amazon. Seeing that amazingly smooth picture, despite STILL having not been able to watch a blu-ray or 3D movie on this thing, is a breath of fresh air.I only have ONE complaint. This thing is super picky about the remote. You have to point the remote right at the sensor to get it to do anything. If you plan on using the QWERTY keyboard on the back of the remote, keep your patience. I strongly suspect that the keyboard is the whole reason for the pickyness, since they have to put the sensor on the side. The non-3D TV we bought was definitely not as picky.

I previously owned a regular Vizio 32\" LCD TV and was very happy with it. I owned it for about 2 and a half years and surprisingly I paid less for this TV (last one was 400$).Now this TV isn't equipped with the best 3D technology, however for the price you really can't complain because it does work rather well... 3D is rather easy to transition into (most things you are viewing, the TV will recognize and automatically turn over). The one thing I've found you have to go to the settings to switch to the 3D setting is when you are using a USB device, but even still, switching it this way is just a few buttons away.The LCD has a fairly good picture, I'd say better than my old 32\" which is why I decided to sell it when I purchased this TV. The applications are useful, especially Netflix. I do wish it had more options for applications, but nonetheless, it has a semi-large verity. They are easy to access to since the remote has an application button which brings up a window at the bottom of the screen that you can scroll through.One thing about this monitor that may bother some people that I've noticed is that it has a light that will project on your wall behind the monitor. It creates a little pattern, that I've honestly grown to like, and it isn't too bright, but is noticeable. Another small flaw is that the sound on the monitor could be better, but for the price you should be able to pick up a cheap sound bar with the monitor to up the sound quality.This TV does operate well for its price range. It's a good option if your interested in 3D but don't want to pay a lot at first.. I doubt you'll be disappointed in your purchase if you try it out, however one thing I am sort of disappointed in is the lack of 3D content that is out there...

If you are interested in my experience with the TV, read on...I want to start off by saying that I am a photographer/videographer/musician/gamer, so I have a pretty decent eye and ear for picture quality, audio quality, and latency issues. I purchased this TV because I wanted to try out 3D gaming. I sold my two-year-old 42\" Sharp for half the cost of this tv so that I could justify purchasing it, and my goal was to have at least equal 2D picture quality with the added benefit of 3D. When I first hooked up the TV to my computer, it was obvious the 2D quality was sub-par compared to the Sharp. I found the TV had very noticeable latency in regards to response time (the Sharp has an excellent response time), and the video playback was unnatural. The 3D worked well, but there was noticeable drop in picture quality compared to 1080P 2D (passive 3D splits the image to 540P per eye, and I could definitely see the difference). I only had about 20 minutes to play with the TV before work, and I started regretting the purchase decision.The next morning, I finally had some time to sit down and adjust the settings of the tv. The first thing I did was disable almost all of the features on the tv. Doing so fixed the response time issues (in 2D) and fixed the unnatural video playback. If you are looking for deep blacks, you won't find them here. Black levels are a dark grey, but black enough that I'm ok with the overall picture quality. At first I wanted to give a 3-star rating because of this and a few other things, but then I reminded myself that this tv is a fraction of the cost compared to TVs with deep blacks and stunning picture quality. And to be completely honest, I really only notice it when I'm trying to point out what's wrong with the tv. If I start watching a movie, I tend to forget that there are better quality displays. For the sake of time, I will try wrapping the rest of my review up into a Pros/Cons section.Cons-Initial setup has poor-average quality picture/performance (for my eyes).-Blacks could be deeper.-Noticeable drop in quality in 3D.-Sound (I know HDTVs all have poor sound, but my Sharp sounded much better). It's passable, but I ordered my first surround sound unit because of it. Tip: Turn off the audio enhancement features. Before I did, I had volume levels that would continually rise and fall in a poorly managed way.-Latency in 3D gaming. (2D has a gaming mode option. 3D does not.) Although I could play games in 3D, you have to time actions like jumping a little early. I found myself running off of cliffs unless I timed the jump about a quarter-second early.-Stand isn't very sturdy, but it works fine if you don't have to worry about anyone or anything bumping into it from time to time.-Picture controls. Things like switching from 2D-3D or changing picture modes require clicking through a few menu options. I had already expected this from reading other reviews, so it hasn't bothered me too bad. But a dedicated button for picture modes, and the ability for the TV to automatically adjust for 2D or 3D would have been nice.Pros-3D TV around the same cost as bare-bones TVs.-Satisfactory picture quality when setup right. (I highly recommend turning off all of the special features, and then turn them on one by one if you want to get an idea on how they effect the picture.)-Great color depth and contrast considering sub-par black levels.-Feature adjustments are saved to individual inputs. For example, my PS3 settings for gaming are set to HDMI 1. When I switch to HDMI 2, the settings for my PC are automatically saved as a second feature profile.-Gaming Mode for 2D gaming.-Passive 3D technology allows brighter picture and cheaper glasses compared to passive technology (although my movie theater glasses did not work with this tv for some reason)-Overall great TV for the priceI bought this tv to try out 3D, and I think it's a great option for anyone else wanting to give it a shot. Although 3D comes with a slight degrade in picture quality, the added depth tied with the right movie really does enhance the viewing experience. For gaming, I'm not sure if I'll use 3D much. Few games so far use it well, the drop in resolution is distracting in some games, and the latancy issues may be more than acceptable for some. Where 3d really shines is animated movies. I watched Up 3D, and the quality of the 3D really shined over the live action movies I've tested so far. Will the 3D eventually grow old? I guess time will tell. But so far, I have really enjoyed the experience, and I think the quality is high enough to satisfy most consumers.", "Date": "July 14, 2012"}, {"Title": "Fantastic", "Author": "Celtics Baby!! \"The Truth\"", "ReviewID": "R3HE3Y06KPDHTW", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Just bought this tv, and not only is the 3D viewing spectacular, but the overall quality and brightness of the picture is amazing.

You must use a 1.4 HDMI rated cable with ethernet for 3D and I also suggest wall mounting with a tilt mount for the best 3D effects to show.The provided 3D glasses work well and are interchangeable with the ones that came with my passive LG and they both fit comfortably over my prescription glasses.If you don't have over 800 bucks to spend on a different TV and want a 3D smart model,this Vizio is a very good choice.", "Date": "November 13, 2011"}, {"Title": "good tv", "Author": "Chris Yardley", "ReviewID": "R1TPO9ET975CY5", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This TV is Great, for price and functions.

I fed the same signal into both the E3D420VX and one of the old ones simultaneously. I compared the two TVs with standard definition 480i digital (from my satellite box), with 480p from an antenna, and then with 1080i from the antenna. (I don't yet have HD service from my satellite provider.)With both types of signals, the old TVs were both noticeably better than the E3D420VX. The E3D420VX was not as bright, even with the backlight and the brightness turned up to 100%. The colors were not as vivid and not as true as on either of the older sets, regardless of how much I adjusted the color settings. With the 480 signals, the E3D420VX showed a lot of pixellation around the edges of everything in the picture. Even with the 1080i signal, there was a little more pixellation than with the old TVs running at 480i. Finally, the sharpness was noticeably worse on the E3D420VX.One major annoyance was that the E3D420VX takes a long time to come on once the power button is pushed. Perhaps the CCFL backlights need time to warm up???

For the price, this tv is an ok gamble if you want to try some 3d imo and so far I've had a positive experience with passive 3d and have enjoyed afternoon's of 3d movies and games.The passive 3d technology works great. The television is feature rich with smart tv goodies. The picture and 3d looks great for the price. The sound is fair but nothing special.  It's lightweight (although cheap feeling). Comes with passive 3d glasses.Now the bad news. My television turns on by itself. Started a couple of weeks ago. It also locks up occasionally and must be unplugged from the wall. Happened twice since new. Lip sync issues with Netflix. There is a lip sync adjustment but it doesn't help. Viewing angles are problematic in 3d. You will need to pay close attention to tv height and distance. The remote is meh. Console 3d gaming isn't quite there yet and gaming input lag is there a Lil.In reality, you almost need to set this tv on your lap to get a worthy 3d experience. My next 3dtv will probably be 55 inches or larger and likely not a ViZio.

Also, what is not mentioned is that since it is a 42\" TV, the warranty (a full one year parts AND labor) includes in-home service, so no trying to package this monster to ship for service,, no sending it anywhere,, they come to you.  Also, Vizio offers an additional 3yr in-home extended warranty at a very reasonable price on their site.  You have sixty days from date of purchase to obtain this warranty and I am getting it next month after I get my next Social Security check (to make a payment on my credit card LOL).  Yep, spend this month's allotment for extras on this TV and as in purchasing a Samsung BD-D7500 which is playing very well also.  Unlike the TV, this Blue-ray 3D DVD player is sold through a second party.  If you read their return policy closely, you will guess why I did not buy it from them through Amazon.  I got it at B&H; Photovideo at a good price, no tax nor shipping,, Can purchase an extended warranty through them,,, and,,, a full 30 day no questions asked return policy and from date of arrival, not date of purchase.  No one can be fairer than this.  This DVD player is working well also.

I tried to do some research on 3D TVs before ordering, but generally found useful information hard to come by.1.  It's a perfectly adequate HDTV.  However, if you're looking at this model, it's because you're interested in something more.  If you don't care about 3D, get something else and save a few hundred dollars.2.  The way 3d seems to work on this model is that the left and right images are interleaved (e.g. the left eye sees odd numbered lines, and the right eye sees even numbered lines).  This effectively halves the vertical resolution whenever you are in 3d mode.  This is NOT what I would have expected - I would have expected frame-sequential full resolution.  (It seems like it would have been straightforward to do, too, by adding a liquid crystal layer on top of the display to switch alternate frames between left- and right-circularly polarized.)  It's still a good deal for the price, but a small disappointment.3.  The TV supports 3 methods for interleaving the 3D image - side by side, top and bottom, or a proprietary \"Sensio\" format.  As far as I can tell, this doesn't \"just work\" with OpenGL quad-buffer mode on the ATI graphics cards (tried a FirePro 8900 and a Radeon 6850).  If you're writing your own code, you can certainly \"fake\" the output by rendering the left and right eye scenes into the same image but it's not the straightforward, seamless experience it ought to be.4.  You have to stand at least 10 feet away for the 3d effect to work, and not be too far above or below the screen.  This usually won't be a problem unless you want to do something \"interesting\", like make your coffee table into a Surface-type display.5.  The built-in internet apps are mostly a curiosity.  It comes preloaded with a lot of apps I have no use for (e.g. Twitter) but lacks the obvious - there's no web browser!  It's based on Yahoo Connected TV Internet Widgets, which seems to offer free developer tools if you want to roll your own.  It's a bit unfortunate they went with that instead of Android, as the selection in the online market is very limited.My take - it's a good deal for now if you want to dabble with stereoscopic 3d, but hopefully new models will fix these shortcomings.", "Date": "July 30, 2012"}, {"Title": "3D TV", "Author": "utahsand", "ReviewID": "R29JJK3HNUZ3CT", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "this vizio 3d tv is a great product at a very very great price it comes with everything you need to install it the phone in live custoer support to help you install if you have a problem is amazing the picture will make your jaw drop it is so crisp and clear it was very lite and install in minutes the internet ,dvd and cable were hooked up in seconds all hdmi you realy cant beat the price for this bad boy", "Date": "July 27, 2012"}, {"Title": "Just what I've always wanted", "Author": "Pandora's Box Productions", "ReviewID": "R1E509V1HEHT2Z", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I don't know much about Tv's so I'll keep it short.

It is not extremely long but if you absolutely NEED your television to turn on IMMEDIATELY you may find it a bother. There are power saving options that you can turn off if you find them obnoxious, such as the auto adjust for lighting. It caused the tv to randomly change its brightness setting while wathcing. That was immediately turned off on my set.It has a plethora of inputs. My entertainment stand is stacked with game systems, a hard drive, and a cable box and I found no trouble connecting all of them.The 720p-1080p HD displays are all very crisp and compare nicely to every other television. I find that the 32\" smaller display size provides a clearer image than larger televisions.The best part of course is the 3D quality. When I played the first 3D movie on this television I was astounded. The image looked as clear as a movie theater. The 3D was truly as good as what I have viewed in both IMAX theaters and Real3D theaters.(Minus display size of course). I have had a few people view the 3D capabilities with me, all are impressed and nobody walks away with a headache. I have not seen a slight bit of ghosting in 3D as other reviews note. The image stays crisp and clear at all times (I have viewed about 23 hours of 3D content at this point). Then above all, the glasses are the same as Real3D theater glasses. They are light, convenient, and not battery operated.Paying under $500 for all of the above content was WELL worth the price. I am totally impressed by the technology.

However as long as I put my hands in front of the 3D glasses like wearing binoculars, dizzy feel disappeared. Later I figured out that was because of ambient light: when I view the 3D channel at night with all light off, I see clear and comfortable 3D!One other problem with 3D on this set is the 3D setting: left and right eyes could be easily reversed mistakenly, which resulted in no (or as someone said inverted) 3D effect, unless you wear the 3D glasses upside down. The right way to correct it is to reset to the original factory settings ( ->menu->help, and erase the setting in memory ). But what makes it a problem is that it looks like a software bug: if you change the picture setting in 2D mode (->menu->picture->advanced->motion correction to off), you could make that No-3D problem come again when you watch 3D channel in 3D mode!Don't know where to put this but if I could suggest to Vizio engineers, I would like to fix this bug in the next version of the TV firmware, at least to add a menu setting in 3D mode so that left and right eyes images could be easily set back when they are wrong.", "Date": "June 28, 2011"}, {"Title": "VIZIO E3D470VX", "Author": "erik mercado", "ReviewID": "R1SSSO01RG5MVM", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "soy de venezuela compre este articulo y estoy muy satisfecho por el tv, tiene un buena resolucion y sonido impresionante, este es mi primer tv 3d... es un buen tv a muy buen bajo precio..", "Date": "November 3, 2012"}, {"Title": "Great T.V. and not just for the price but with minor flaws", "Author": "oka20", "ReviewID": "R15JK8GV8PQWFG", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "i've had a full day to tweak and play with the tv and i will say it has a lot of pros to just a couple of flaws...i bought the tv after extensive research and i wasn't even looking to buy a 3d tv but with it just being a couple of more bucks i decided to take the leap. the 3d quality is great... i've seen tron and the ota 3d on directv and both were awesome... but i did see some trailers i.e. drive angry and toy story 3 that were underwhelming. the viewing angle seems to be pretty good and i sit about 7-8 ft away and i have seen no problem nor have i seen any ghosting.

It's an installer's nightmare.  Despite having USB ports, wireless, and ethernet, you need to use its remote to do anything with it.2) It won't show 3D content without you clicking \"Ok\" on a pop-up using its remote.

My old desktop computer boots up faster than this TV.4) There seems to be no way to shut off the screen backlight while leaving the speakers on.

You can listen to music and view pictures, but video is neglected.The Media App is one of the primary reasons I bought this SmartTV over one of the other conventional HDTV's.  I was excited to hear that DLNA (and Plex) were supported by the Media App so I would not need to add yet another black box to my entertainment center.  That was in theory, in practice the Media App is very slow and prone to freezing when it finds an unsupported video (which is quite often).  Finding out which formats and codecs are supported for this TV are extremely difficult.  There is no information in the user manual, but there is 1 very lonely, difficult to find piece of information on Vizio's website (that I didn't find until after I bought the TV) that suggests that only x.264 in .avi format is supported.  The only codec/file format combinations I've found to work are Xvid and x.264 in .avi format.  .mkv and .mp4 videos will not play which is very unfortunate as the vast majority of the newer videos (including most 3D movies) around the internet are in these two formats.Trying to play 3D is similarly frustrating.  There are different types of 3D videos, but there isn't a widely used naming convention for them so just like with codec/file format, trial and error is just about the only way of finding supported content.  Finding 3D movies on the internet that fit both the 3D format, and the codec/file format constraints has so far been impossible for me.  Either the file will be unsupported, or it will be in an unsupported 3D format.  Youtube has a small handful of videos that work fairly well.Streaming HD video works and looks great.  I haven't used Netflix, but the Amazon app works well 90% of the time.  The problem isn't with the streaming, it's with the App itself.  It will freeze on random menus and the app needs to be restarted for it to work again.The WiFi on it is miserable.  I have a 802.11G access point in the room the TV is in and a 802.11N access point 2 rooms away.  I was unable to connect to the N access point with this TV, but have no problems with any other device I own so I was forced to connect to the G access point.  802.11G is sufficient for streaming HDTV over the internet, I haven't had any streaming problems with Amazon.At the end of the day, this TV would be 5 stars IF they added support for .mkv and .mp4.

In video reviews you can see the scan lines like analog TV when you don't wear the 3D glasses.  When you have the glasses on, each eyes see half of the scan lines, that is, 540p for each eye.  For active systems, full 1080p is available for both eyes.  Say a movie has 24 frames per second, an full 3D movie has 48, 24 for each eye.  Active glasses black out one eye when the other eye is watching a full 1080p frame.  Since 120 Hz refresh rate is the standard for HD 2D TV's, 240 Hz is required for active 3D systems.The other passive design tries to show each eye full 1080p resolution.  Instead of dropping half the information, the frame rate is doubled.  Each eye sees 540p as in the Vizio, but the frame rate is doubled.  The review I saw reported that there's some improvement over Vizio, but noted that in theory scan lines have to be in the wrong position half the time.  It could be better than without the wrong half I suppose.Blu-ray 3D movies are 2 x 1080p resolution, or you can say side-by-side 1080p.  For some distributions, there are ways to reduce the resolution to be backward compatible with 1080p.  If the format is Half Top-Bottom, it will fit the Vizio perfectly.  A normal frame is squeezed in height to 540p. The two stereo frames are stacked top to bottom into a 1080p frame.  But the more usual format is half side-by-side.  It make more sense to squeeze the wider dimension, but what you left after the Vizio is one quarter of the resolution, for each eye though.That doesn't mean that I don't recommend it.  You know that plasma has better contrast but LCD is becoming more popular.  It has to be the price.  And that I can lift the box myself, half insert it into the trunk of a compact, and drive home with the trunk open.  The picture is bright, the color is fine.  I like the 3D.  When displaying SD DVD, it's not as sharp as HD because the lines are doubled.  For 3D you can't get close to the screen and focus on a spot to see if there are enough pixels.  I don't feel that I'm watching a DVD.  Even half SBS are pretty good.  If you are worried you need to go the the show rooms to compare.One dimension is worth a lot more than the reduced resolution.  You don't feel like breathing taking when watching HD's, but you do with 3D.  Since the image changes with the position of your head.  It seems as if you can move sideways to see more what's behind an object.  The Vizio has wide watching angles and distance.  You don't worry losing the 3D effect if you don't have the best seat in the house.Dr. Hermann Snellen has a formula for good viewing distance (you see his chart in the eye doctors). For 42\" and 47\" TV the distance is 5 ft 6 in, and 6 ft 1 in respectively.  This is in line with the minimum viewing distance manufacturers recommend. If you have a room wider than 9ft, you need a 70\" TV to feel that you are immersed in the action.  It doesn't mean that it's bad when you sit further away for a feet or two.  People have been happy with smaller analog TVs for so long.  But instead of getting a 70\", I opted for a 42\" and some high end camping chairs for anyone who want to sit right in front of the TV any time.If you have a high end plasma since not so long ago, you probably want to hold on for a while until more great movies are in 3D.  It's not bad for kids to have their own TV to play games and watch animated films.  And since the DVD rental business is still going strong, I would think this is a good one when you need to upgrade your TV.  Paying some extra for 3D and you can hold on to it for years to come, until they think of something new.I wrote the review to complain about the lack of quantitative reviews and head on reviews.  Then I found a good review at the discussion forum below.  The conclusion is that because of the way the brain combines a 3D image, you can read finer text with passive technology than active technology.  You can try that at home to see that 3D is not far behind than in the 2D mode.  And you can compare in the show rooms.  I feel so much better now.

I loved the TV almost more than my first born.  The apps are the best collection that I have seen.  Just watch my video and see it for yourself.  I would like to note that I had the TV on for a while trying to make the video and that is why the lines went away so fast.  They normally take up to 30 minutes to go away.  They stay off for about two hours and then they come back on and stay on until you turn the TV off.  Tonight there was a problem with the sound.  I was trying to figure that one out.  Couldn't figure it out.  So, I cut the TV off.  So the TV was warmed up before I made the video.  I will post the video at Amazon, Walmart, and Youtube. Please know that I will talk before I cut the TV on so the video starts off dark.UPDATE - I returned the TV last night and exchanged it for another one just like it.  I set the TV and four apps (netflix, hulu, amazon prime, and vudu).  The set up was about thirty minutes total.  Soooo much better and user friendly - as compared to the PS3 and XBOX 360.  MY GUIDE BUTTON WORKED AGAIN!!!!!  If you don't have cable (like me) that guide is awesome.  Then I went to sleep, turned the TV back on and it said it had updated.  THE GUIDE WAS GONE!!!!!  The size of the picture changed.  I don't know what VISIO is doing - Yes, you can't stop the updates.  I'll have to research that one. Now, I remember that the problem started after the update.The bottom line is the jury is still out.  The thing to know is that this TV is fantastic for the price.  I read so many reviews about things with this TV.  Regarding negative ones (like mine), I think I really get it.  This TV is priced low and an LCD (not LED).  So it's not supposed to be thin and light weight.  The remote is really good.  I don't doubt that many reviews have to push buttons really hard but I've had two and they are like a normal remote (not like a touch screen).  The querty keyboard is awesome.  You will not find many of the features on more expensive models or other brands.  I researched TVs and I could have afforded to spend more on a TV, but this one had the features I really want: apps (netflix, hulu, vudu, blockbuster, and amazon prime), passive 3D (inexpensive glasses), built in 3D (better than 3D ready), three types of 3D (horizontal, vertical, and sensio).  Now defects in manufacturing will negate everything I just wrote about.  I really want this TV to work long term.  I have 8 televisions (all are LCD or LED).  Only one has been temperamental and that was after five years of ownership. The fact that the TV was not working properly within two weeks of purchase is a serious thing with me despite how I really like what it offers.  If there is another problem, I will not get another TV like this one.PRICE:  This time I bought the TV for $713 ($648 + tax) and $65 for a two year extended warranty.  Now, Amazon is really where you should get this TV and where I wish I would have gotten it.  It is $629 and you could get the four square warranty for (four yrs) for $99.  That would be a real savings.

The 3D worked great, but problems quickly became apparent. First, the remote that comes with it DOES NOT have a QWERTY keypad, as on the more expensive versions, and it will cost you another $60 to buy one. Not having the QWERTY keypad forces you to use the ordinary 'up and down, left and right' buttons on the remote to enter characters on the image of a keyboard presented on the screen. It might take you some 10 keystrokes to enter a single letter or number! Secondly, the ordinary image quality was very poor, with the different colors not always being superimposed on each other, so you got colored fringes that were not consistent and therefore, if adjustments did exist, would not be easily corrected. Finally, the documentation on general use of the TV was poor. I decided within a day to return the TV. Right price, but more trouble than it's worth.", "Date": "August 15, 2012"}, {"Title": "A great entry level 3D TV", "Author": "Daniel A Moir", "ReviewID": "R28KRSO07JRRAU", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I am happy to report cheap 3D is ready for Prime Time.3D TV sales are slow, according to the guy behind the counter at Best Buy in Murray, Utah. The company considers it a \"now\" technology with an uncertain future. What happens to 3D beyond the next couple years is anyone's guess.The FYE salesman I spoke with in Murray offered a contrary opinion as FYE is seeing sales of 3D Blu Ray movies gradually increase. Two different outlooks from the retail front, one bleak, one cautiously optimistic. Can 3D survive? Yes, but only by dispelling some of the misinformation floating around out there, and thankfully, I now have the personal experience with a product enough to help with that.I had been renting to own a 2D TV that if I had completed the purchase it would have cost me another $3,400.00. It was getting too expensive so my wife and I decided it was time to do something to resolve that debt. However, in our current living situation (renting out a basement) one needs a TV in order to at least feel independent. We can always retreat to our basement and turn on a movie to escape.I was delighted when I found that Sony has released a new line of inexpensive LED-LCD hybrid TVs called the E series. Cheap, sturdy and affordable Becky and I bought the 42\" TV and we have a lot of good things to say about it, which will help dispel the rumors that I only complain about stuff. Not true, this TV is awesome.While not as bright as a Plasma or truLED TV the picture is plenty crisp and the TV also includes limited Internet connectivity allowing you access to Hulu, Vudu and even Netflix, but it's best asset is it's approach to 3D. I can happily say that rumors of Passive (Cinema) 3D loosing resolution is no longer true. Older models lost picture quality due to the polarized screens which helped to generate the illusion, the pictures were grainy but it was a cheap alternative to the Active Shutter 3D glasses (now $50.-$70.00 each). Inside the year since passive 3D first hit the Market Sony seems to have resolved that problem as this E-Series presents lossless 3D through the same $2.00 glasses you get at the theater, so save those because now you have a reason to take them home. You can watch your 3D movies with full High Definition and not worry about loosing a single pixel but it gets better.The other drawback to Passive 3D in theaters is that the picture is rendered about 25% darker by the glasses. This is not as big of a problem on the E Series TV which comes equipped with an LED backlight to help reduce the loss of luminosity. It's still there, but the loss is more like 10% meaning you still maintain a picture that is plenty bright.Now you gamers out there will likely ask \"yeah but how does it do with games?\" Pretty good, though not as good as a plasma, admittedly. The PS3 is the only system that I have capable of 3D as 3D does require HDMI, which my older 360 does not have. Now I do not know if this is a limitation of the TV or the PS3 but 3D games will max out their resolution at 720p, not a big deal for TVs between 30-50 inches, and this series stops at 47\" so far as I know. Movies still play in full 1080p High Definition. The brighter-than-theater picture eliminates the headaches (at least for Becky and I) caused by the eye strain which the darker picture of a theatrical presentation creates. All in all this is the best way to experience the next logical step in film evolution on the market at this point.Talkies never went away... I'm just saying...With the cheapness of the TV, and the glasses and the glasses being much more comfortable than the more expensive Active Shutter lenses Sony has resolved one of the biggest complaints about 3D TVs. Granted it would be great to have glasses free 3D, but the technology isn't quite there yet. The Sony E Series is a great stop gap to hold us over for the next few years, and for those who enjoy Avatar and Transformers 3 it's a great way to have that breathtaking experience from the comfort of your living room.", "Date": "August 19, 2011"}, {"Title": "update", "Author": "Diana Vu", "ReviewID": "R37N1YEJCVXXRA", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "i received the tv and set it up. but the only thing that came on was the vizio logo. after that, it was all a black screen. i pressed all the buttons on the remote, only the power button worked to turn on and off the tv. i would love to say the tv is great, but i had a bad initial experience. amazon service is great though. they are sending me a replacement one soon so hopefully i'll get to change my review.the second one i received was awesome! i love it", "Date": "November 20, 2012"}, {"Title": "VIZIO E3D320VX 32-INCH FROM AMAZON", "Author": "FIT4LIFE", "ReviewID": "R3LZTRXQWLHZ3C", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "THIS IS AN EXCELLENT PRODUCT.

Tried this about three times, and still no connection.  Upgraded firmware, reset router, tried again.  The television sees my network, but just can't connect.After I tried a fourth time, the remote control died!!  I called customer support at Vizio and I will say that they were terrific.  We worked through every possible fix, including taking the batteries out, pressing every button once, putting the batteries back in.  Nothing.  Then we tried pressing a series of buttons on the QWERTY side of the remote.  Nothing.  Tech rep had me use a digital camera to see if we could see the infrared signal.  That fix was kind of cool!  We could see it through the digital camera, and then it would go away.  It would work, then it wouldn't.  Finally, the tech rep decided to send me a new remote control via mail.  I should receive it in three to five business days and I'll come back to edit my review at that time.I'm so disappointed.  The TV is absolutely beautiful, and I can access 3D content using the side panel buttons, but I'm not going to keep the television if the remote doesn't work and I can't connect to the internet.UPDATE: Received the new remote control direct from Vizio, and it works!

I took the advice of commenter Arsynic below and replaced my old dinosaur of a router with a new Wireless N compatible router and was able to connect the Vizio TV effortlessly!  So, after several weeks of hassles (having the remote replaced by Vizio; having to purchase a new router) I am finally satisfied with this TV.  I don't feel right to change my initial 1-Star rating since the TV provided far more hassle than expected out of the box, but with a little effort and patience I was able to resolve the problems.  As long as you get a remote that works, and you have a newer router, you'll probably love this TV.  The picture is gorgeous and the 3D is fun!!

It will cost over $65.00 to have the remote replaced, less than one year from original purchase! Vizio remotes have been a problem for years, it's certainly not just me. So, sigh.
