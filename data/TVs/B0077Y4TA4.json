Beware of the \"surround sound\" offered by these TVs; such a title is dubious at best.  Sound is tinny and weak, coming out of the metal back.  Some sounds caused rumbling against the speaker casing.  Poor design by Samsung.  Absolutely requires a soundbar, and I'm no audiophile requiring home theater and such.  Also agree with another review on the lack of audio outputs. Had to hook up the soundbar to my cable box. Strange that Samsung would not offer this basic feature that you see in virtually all other TVs. Regarding the TV stand, there are two flimsy screws used to keep the TV \"stable.\" Indeed, lightly pushing the TV could cause it to topple over.

Picture quality is fine for a 60Hz screen.  The sound quality is decent but not great.  I wish it had an audio jack to attach external speakers.  That's my only complaint, except...A note to fellow TiVo subscribers.  This TV's backlight control affects the TiVo remote.  I had to comb through the TiVo forums to figure this out, because unfortunately the TiVo support people had not encountered this problem before.  We like to watch the TV fairly dim (bright screens give my wife headaches).  We turned the backlight on our TV down to a very low level, and within minutes our TiVo remote had stopped talking to the TiVo box.  Of course, we didn't make the connection right away.  I tried replacing the remote batteries, I tried rebooting the TiVo, I tried updating the firmware, all to no effect.We called TiVo support and they concluded that our TiVo box was defective.  So they shipped us a replacement box.  Of course, the same thing happened again.  So we had gone to the trouble of shipping off our old TiVo box, had to have Comcast come and install a new cablecard in the new unit, and lost a bunch of recorded shows on the old box for nothing.Since then we have found that if we keep the backlight setting at 2 or above on the TV, the TiVo remote is not affected.I only put this in the review to help out other TiVo subscribers.

Picture quality is great. Sound quality was great. Until I blew the speakers. I admit, my fault. I like to listen to my movies loud. Once the speakers were blown, I bought a samsung home theatre system to fix my speaker problems, but come to find out, THERE IS NO AUDIO/VIDEO OUTPUTS. I can not return the t.v. since it was purchased in the late summer of 2012. One would think that if a t.v. has a power button, it would also have all the audio/video inputs and outputs. Who thinks to check this when shopping anywhere? I didn't. I see others also didn't. Also it is pretty hard to see the back of a t.v. while it is on display, since they are hanging from fixed mounting brackets at the store. The box also doesn't indicate this. It may say audio input, but lacks to say no output. Once again, my fault for not realizing this. Hopefully myself, others and Samsung will also learn to make sure that all of the t.v.'s have at least the basic essentials that we all grew up with. Otherwise, there is no chance to have any sort of home theatre system in your home, which I personally was really looking forward to. I DON'T RECOMMEND IF YOU WANT SURROUND SOUND.

The outputs aren't an issue. You're home theater system should have a decent receiver for your input components in the first place. If you're trying to do something like use a 3.5 mm connection (headphone jack), you probably shouldn't be doing that anyway. The tv's plenty loud and clear for casual viewing. The colors are really sharp and bright. I previously had a 42\" Vizio with similar specs, but the Samsung just looks better. Did a side by side with the old tv, both running HDMI and the Samsung was the clear winner.I've read concerns about the tv not having buttons. It does, in fact, have buttons.

I have another 40-inch HDTV that retails for about $1,000 and the picture quality is much better than this Samsung.Pros:1.  The menu allows for a great deal of control on the color, sharpness, sound and many more features.2.  The setup is very simple, right out of the box.3.  Plenty of input choices: HDMI, Composite, RCA and of course Coax Cable.3.  The picture quality is . . . . well, good for a $350 HDTV.Cons:1. There are no audio or visual out-jacks, not even a headphone plug.  This is a problem because the native sound quality is fair to poor.  My workaround was to buy the new Roku box which includes a bluetooth headphone jack.  Setting it up like this, the sound is awesome (through Bose headphones, not through speakers).2. The screen is matte coated, so the dark tones look flat or the blacks look grey instead of rich.  However the matte coating does prevent distracting reflections on the screen.3. The 60Hz refresh rate.  A 120Hz or higher really makes a big difference in the picture quality.Overall, you can't expect a $350 HDTV to compare well to a $1,000 HDTV.
