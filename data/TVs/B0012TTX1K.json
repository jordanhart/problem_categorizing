{"Reviews": [{"Title": "LC-32D44U is an excellent TV! Very well-balanced and always looks good!", "Author": "N. Williams", "ReviewID": "R1QI0IRGAEPCHQ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I have both this TV as well as a Samsung LN-T2642H. It's very interesting to compare the two TV's performances. If you want the more balanced natural look, go with Sharp. If you're more interested in a vivid, colorful image go with Samsung. I also did an extended look at the Toshiba 26HL67.There is a key difference between the panels Sharp uses compared to others. Sharp's TVs are made with panels called S-IPS while Samsung, Sony and Toshiba currently use a panel called S-PVA. This has everything to do with why Samsung, Sony and Toshiba have very strong color but one thing I noticed about Samsung is that when you look at it for a slightly low angle, the color gets darker and starts to invert. If you look it from above, the color gets lighter and starts to invert. With the Sharp, no matter what angle I look at it, the color doesn't change AT ALL! This is very impressive and cool!I also notice that when I played around with the TV settings, it doesn't need much to look good, it almost always does. When you turn on the Active Contrast mode on the Sharp (it's equivalent to DNIe), it doesn't totally knock out the details in darker areas. At first, I had to keep checking to see if it was on or not because I was so used to the way the Samsung crushes black details even on the Low setting. Once again, I was more impress with the way this TV addresses contrast in fact I think the Sharp does a better job with contrast because of its black color.The Sharp's black color is closer to black than the Samsung. The black color on the Samsung is more of a dark blue even on Warm temperature (it's especially noticably at slight vertical angles) but with the Sharp the black was much closer to real black.The speakers on the Sharp doesn't distort at volume levels higher than 30. With the Samsung, when u turn the volume up pass 30, the bass tends to distort the fidelity of all the sound resulting in a buzz. This is probably due to the build of the unit and the lower wattage for the speakers. Sharp doesn't sound perfect either but it's definitely warmer and clearer at high volumes thanks to having 10 watts per speaker instead of 5. I would recommend everyone to get a 2.1 speaker for any LCD TV though. Take advantage of those sound outputs on the back of your TV! :) It definitely takes your experience to a higher level!One minus I have with the Sharp was that it didn't have a headphone jack.Overall, I think this is an excellent 32\" TV. Sharp is definitely worth a look and probably my new LCD manufacturer of choice. It doesn't need as much tweaking when you switch between uses. I tested both TVs with PC (via DVI>HDMI), Xbox 360, HDTV, SDTV, HD-DVDs and upconverted DVDs. With the Samsung, I find myself always tweaking the settings between uses like changing the Energy Saving level, turning up the Digital NR for SDTV, turning it off for everything else, toning down the DNIe.Thanks to Sharp's OPC, the backlight adjust very intelligently based on what's on the screen. I just leave the Active Contrast on because I know I'm not missing out darker details, the picture is very sharp and the panel is slightly faster thanks to the 6ms speed, which equals less motion blur with things like text and more solid image overall.This Sharp is the real deal and reminds me much more of a CRT than the Samsung because the Samsung requires too much twinkering to get things comfortable. I think if the Samsung's black was more like true black and the vertical angle didnt distort so much I wouldn't tweak it as often.So in summary, if you want the most vibrant colors and don't mind tweaking between uses by all means get a Samsung. (I still like the Samsung and would give it a 4 out of 5)If you want a more, natural looking picture, that doesn't offer or require as much tweaking because it just plain looks good, go with a Sharp.I think Toshiba and Sony TVs tend to do a better job with black crush and black color than Samsung but since the panels are the same technology (S-PVA), they still have the vibrant color and probably some vertical viewing weirdness.", "Date": "March 23, 2008"}, {"Title": "Great TV.

But this tv blows me off. Great natural colors, no bright and deep colors as in other samsung and toshiba Tvs.The Menu is simple but even then it gives wide range of adjustments. Don't be attracted by the video reviews of the other TVs given all over the internet about the different options you can change on your TV because you know what, not many people use all those menu items. This has got bunch of inputs to it and it also have a headphone jack. I added my Bose system to this TV and it really gives a great Movie Experience.The edges can be a little too glossy, but if you are a person who likes to keep the things neat, you will love the gloss.Very useful menu item as skipping the Inputs makes this more versatile.16 ( 4 x 4 ) Customizable favourite channels make life a little more easy. I bought this TV for the olympics and the NBC gives a HighDefinition Feed using the regular cable(no HD receiver required to watch some of the channels like NBC, TNT, A&E; ) and its absolutely stunning. I also get some digital channels that are great. The audio can be skipped between mono, stereo, surround where available.This is a tv that can be rated more than 5.Pros: Everything.. really amazing tv.I cannot believe you are still reading the review instead of going to the store and buying one. But for those who \" have to read \" here are thecons: The Remote has to be really pointed to the receiver which can be a pain somtimes and also the channels skip a little slow, but that doesn't bother me.note: avoid plasmas they give out toomuch glare.update: the latest plasmas are giving much lesser glare then the older ones, i guess the technology has finally caught up.If you are looking for a tv at this size, it really doesn't make a lot of difference between 720p and 1080p/i. it only matters when you go for a more bigger tvs.And as an electronics engineer , i can safely say, that Sharp carrys one of the greater tv screens if not BEST.Hope this review helps.Please email me with questions. more than happy to reply.", "Date": "August 18, 2008"}, {"Title": "Great set", "Author": "M.

Turned On and wait for about 10 minutes that the TV code all the channels. When done, I selected the Input source, selected the \"Dynamic\" Display and bingo!. The most beautiful picture on Screen for this TV category. The Remote use is supper easy, the on screen setup is very easy as well. I read the previous reviews about the sound, I have an 11 by 17 feet Room and I don't need any louder that what I use which currently is not even 10 percent (unless you have some hearing impair) . if you want a great and clear picture and excellent price, you need to get this TV, you will not be disappointed", "Date": "December 12, 2008"}, {"Title": "Great T.V.", "Author": "Jerusha", "ReviewID": "ROSEU7GFA7VSK", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Being used as a bedroom t.v. and I also use it as a second monitor for my computer.  It switches back and forth from cable to PC mode very quickly (via a \"flashback\" button on remote).  Also hooked up to an xBox and the picture looks great too!  As far as the t.v. goes, it has a great picture.  The colors are very good (comparable to our Samsung 50\" plasma television; although the plasma does have better black color) and the sound is also good too.  My son has a 32\" lcd by LG and I think his colors are a bit stronger (better) on his as far as blues and reds but the blacks are equal on both units, so with tweaking that can be equalized.  I will say the sound on my son's LG is a little bit better, but not enough for me to make him switch t.v.'s with me!  I like the Samsung's menu interface better, but how often are you in the menu?  Between the Sharp and LG, the Sharp has a better menu interface.  For example, you can input your own unique input label whereas the LG and Samsung just have default tags to use.  You can also choose which font you want to use for the closed captioning as well as font color and background color.  It has five different fonts to choose from as well as seven colors. Using this as a second monitor is also great.  The text is clear and sharp and the colors are also very good as a monitor.  It has a good refresh rate.  Overall, this is a really great t.v.

However, consumers should focus upon their particular needs, since their desires might not match my own.RESOLUTION --First, this is a 720p resolution screen.  Yet, as a 32-inch screen, this resolution is more than sufficient.  Viewing distance is important with this television.  I have it placed at the end of my bed, approximately 10 feet from where I normally view the television.  The picture is AMAZING from this distance.  However, if I sit at the foot of my bed (only 3 feet or less from the screen), I can see a great deal of pixelation.  There are various websites that can calculate the proper viewing distance for each size of screen and resolution.  I highly recommend using these calculations when choosing an LCD TV, since most stores will place these \"smaller\" HDTV's in isles where you are standing within 3 feet of the screen, giving you a distorted perspective on how the screen will actually look within your home.  I suggest finding a venue where you can stand the proper distance away from the screen to evaluate the picture quality.CONTRAST RATIO --While the Sharp Aquos may have a lower contrast ratio than its competitors, please note that most competitors utilize their \"dynamic\" contrast ratio as their base line.  For those familiar with digital imagery, this means that when using the \"dynamic\" range, the images are \"stretched\" (with the darkest pixels contrasting sharply with the lightest tones).  I must admit that the Sharp Aquos has a horrible Dynamic range function.  Like most dynamic range LCD TV settings, it makes each color garishly bright (this might be nice if you watch football and want the astro-turf to look greener than green, but it's not pleasant to watch if you are viewing a drama or action film).  The benefit of the Sharp Aquos is that the \"Standard\" contrast setting is exponentially better than the \"dynamic\" setting of any of its competitors.  It provides a true-color experience, (more like a well-adjusted CRT television yet in high-def) without the hyper-contrasted colors and tones of similar HDTV's.VIEW MODES --The Sharp Aquos has a half dozen pre-set viewing modes, including \"Standard\" (which I prefer for most purposes) and \"Movie\" (which increases the soft golden tones you would expect from a theater experience, like the old Kodachrome film).  Each preset can be modified with fairly detailed options and saved as the preferred mode for an individual input.  This means that you might fine-tune the \"movie\" setting to your own preferences, and then save that as the default setting for watching DVD's.  If you pop in a DVD, that preset will automatically be used.  But if you change to watching Cable television, the Sharp Aquos will automatically switch to whatever other view mode you chose to associate with that input.  There are also the \"User\" (customized) mode, and a \"Gaming\" (high contrast) mode, as well as the additional two \"dynamic\" mode functions.There is also the unique OPC option (which can be saved as a preference on any of the view modes listed above).  It reads the ambient light in your room and adjusts the backlight of the LCD accordingly.  I like this because it saves energy and adds hours/days/months to the life of your television (the bulb will eventually burn out -- more quickly if it is on its maximum setting all the time without the OPC).  In fact, watching movies in a pitch-black room, I've noticed I get blinded by the brightness of this screen if I don't turn OPC on.  That's how wonderfully bright the screen can be (yet does not need to be all the time).INPUTS--I have an HD-DVR hooked up through Verizon FIOS using an HDMI cable.  Verizon sends out HD at 1080, and standard definition television at 480.  But this TV only displays 480 (native) or 720 (downsampled from Verizon's 1080).  The Sharp Aquos is able to quickly recognize and convert each signal to the proper resolution within about 1.5 seconds of switching between Hi-Def and Standard-Definition channels (between 480 and 1080), providing amazingly clear images from down-sampled HDTV signals.  I have been consistently amazed at the HD picture of this television, including action-packed movies and television shows with fast movement.Note that most cable companies broadcast their HD in 720 (the native resolution of this television), so you do not need Verizon/Fios to attain this quality.I also have a PS2 connected to this television.  When I first connected it with the standard \"composite\" video cables (the \"Red, White and Yellow\" cables) it was horrendous.  However, hooking that same PS2 through the \"component\" cables made the video games appear almost movie-like.  I was greatly impressed.I do have a standard DVD player (not up-sampled) connected to the Sharp Aquos through \"component\" video cables.  The output is exceptional, with no issues.I have also hooked up my iPod Classic to this television, using the iPod-to-composite cables (available online, but nearly all such cables are sold separately).  For down-sampled videos (iPod videos that were only meant for the iPod screen), these images were sub-par on the Aquos HDTV.  However, for videos purchased at HD resolution through iTunes, the picture was amazing on the Aquos.SOUND --My wife and I have been surprised by the complaints about the Sharp Aquos on-board speakers.  We watch our T.V. within a relatively small bedroom, and the on-board sound regularly tricks us to think the special effects are coming from outside the house.  The sound quality also depends upon the input.  I've noticed that the best sound comes from my HDMI inputs.  I do own a surround-sound 5 speaker system that we use occasionally with this Aquos set (the audio output is easily accessible on this TV) but we have found few reasons to use it, other than the truly blockbuster sci-fi or action films.  Most of the time we use the on-board speakers and keep the volume set at about 1/4 of the total output.  That is PLENTY loud.  Much beyond that and we'd be covering our ears (and probably damaging the speakers).OVERVIEW --A great HDTV for a medium-sized room when the viewers will be between 8 and 10 feet away from the screen.  Don't worry about the \"Dynamic\" contrast ratio.  This HDTV is best in \"standard\" mode (more \"life-like\" than any HDTV I've seen).  If you want an HDTV with the most true-color tones and a flexible menu for the average user, I highly recommend this television.  If you don't believe me, go into any store and compare the true color tones of the Sharp Aquos to any of its competitors.  That test is what finally sold us on this TV.

My screen no matter what AV mode it is in grows dark, then light.  If it is a night scene, it just grows dark, and you can't see anything.  So I thought this isn't right, and Sharp came out to fix my TV.  So far they have put in a new board, and it hasn't gotten any better.  I called Sharp again to say hey, my TV still doesn't work right, and they told me to adjust my AV controls.  So, this isn't effective, and basically also does not allow you to watch the TV in different AV modes.I was told by a Sharp represenative in this older generation of TV the TV attempts to adjust the contrast itself, and well it basically gets it wrong sometimes, and you just have to put up with it.  They don't make them like this now, but if you have an older model, too bad.  Seriously?  I think the picture on this TV stinks, whether you are watching a DVD, playing a game, or watching TV this issue acts up all of the time.

If the shop is open on Sundays this is going back in the morning, simply as the picture quality is so poor.It distorts horribly. If the camera pans across a room, you see things such as doors or windows, or people's faces, changing shape.At first I thought it was some kind of deliberate effect for the movie I was watching, as it's like the view of a wide angle lens. Then when the movie ended, guess what? It wasn't the movie, it's the TV. Now maybe I'm using the \"wrong\" cables or something but I see no excuse for such distortion. The image quality is worse than our old CRT set.Talking of cables, we're unable to watch DVDs as it only has the connectors on the back for one unit at a time. Sure, there's a bunch of other connectors but both our sat' box and DVD player use the same red, yellow and white cables. This pile of C can only handle one set of such cables. Rather than buy more cables I'd rather buy a different TV. Oh, another thing, spent an hour or more digging around the house to find some suitable screws, as the screws for the stand were missing from the box.I am deeply unimpressed. I should add I didn't get this from Amazon but I doubt it would make any difference. I'm online right now seeing if there is any known solution or if it's a common problem.", "Date": "September 5, 2009"}, {"Title": "Compared to my 32\" Sony XBR", "Author": "Robert Enyeart", "ReviewID": "R29BVGW2HKX3Y0", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I have a Sony 32XBR in my living room - which is an excellent TV - highly recommendI bought the LC-32D44U for a little more than half the price of the Sony for bed roomHard for me to say how much better the Sony is to this oneI guess the Sharp is about 75% comparing picture and soundColors are 'better' on Sony - across the boardShadow detail is better on Sony but not by as great a margin as color diffBoth are sluggish channel changing but Sharp is twice as slowMine developed a very annoying buzz emanating from the lower tv housing after about a weekTook the back off (sorta) and put little foam sticky dots wherever the back and front touched and buzz is goneThis tv is good for the money and am ok with the purchase - but - I wish I had of waited a little longer (saved up more $$) and got the 37XBR for liv rm and moved 32 to bed rm", "Date": "March 24, 2009"}, {"Title": "MY second love", "Author": "Veronica Thomas \"Mommaofballer\"", "ReviewID": "RJRXR4M64NTSK", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I fell in love with this TV the first day, It lives up to every expectation I had.", "Date": "March 26, 2009"}, {"Title": "Received broken", "Author": "Ann K.
