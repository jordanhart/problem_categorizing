I was looking for the KDL5000 but could not find one on Amazon, so I went after this one.  It looks the same as those models and works the same.  Recently on some of the channels I now watch over the are, when they have paid programs, this thing seems to block them and have to unblock them with parent control password, which I NEVER use that feature.  I hope this doesn't start to happen on ALL channels.  Not that I watch paid programs anyway, but it's weird that this TV started blocking channels on its own like that...  So far the rest of the time it still works.  The close caption on it is lousy though.", "Date": "July 19, 2013"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "Unavailable", "Features": "Sony; KDL-32LL150; widescreen", "Name": "SONY 32'' Bravia LCD HDTV KDL-32LL150", "ImgURL": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/31ygTVA694L._SX300_.jpg", "ProductID": "B002DZN1A6"}}
