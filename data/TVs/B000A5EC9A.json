We have this TV in the bedroom and have found it to have great color, sound and DVD functionality.  I like the flexibility of multiple inputs.  The HDMI input provides outstanding color.My only complaint is that the TV selects the aspect ratio of the picture.  You can't artificially change a standard picture to wide screen for example.", "Date": "November 26, 2007"}, {"Title": "Great TV for Guest or Kids Room", "Author": "jeff", "ReviewID": "R2BURNEO95GD2O", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This is a great tv which has all of the features of more expensive models.  You can use it as a tv of course but also as a computer monitor.  It hasnumerous inputs and great sound.  They call it a TheaterWide TV as the bottom of the television is actually a sound bar speaker which alleviates theneed of having to go out and purchase a speaker system for your set.While the 23\" screen size is small compared to the average sets of 32\" this tv is the perfect size for a kids bedroom, guest room, or small game room.It is very east to hook up game consoles, a computer, blu-ray player, etc.  The nice feature is that all of the inputs are along the bottom of the tv inthe back which has a removable panel.  This panel helps keep all of the cord clutter to a minimal.This tv is wider and a little heavier than most flat panels due to the fact that the DVD player and sound bar are integrated. I have mine wall mountedand it is a very sharp looking tv whether on the wall or on its regular stand.  I am very happy with the versatility of this set.", "Date": "December 14, 2012"}, {"Title": "Didn't last 5 years.", "Author": "Pierre Fassie \"Pierre  Fassi\u00e9\"", "ReviewID": "R25ADABRLLF3XM", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "It lasted 4 and a half years. Six months after the extended warranty had expired it could no longer be turned on. That, by the way, is pretty revealing about extended warranties; I will never purchase another one again. The  23HLV85  overall quality was neither better nor worse than other brands (I also have 2 Samsung and 1 LG). The incorporated dvd player was constantly plagued with problems, unreliable, especially with dvds getting stuck and difficult to remove. We quickly gave up using the dvd player since we usually watch movies in the living room and the 23HLV85 was only for a bedroom. According to reviews on the net, the problem with the on/off switch and dvd player are pretty common. We inquired about fixing it but  the cost was not worth being left with an old and unreliable set. We replaced it with a Samsung. I will stay away from Toshiba from now on.", "Date": "September 27, 2009"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "Unavailable", "Features": "23-inch HD-ready LCD TV with integratd DVD player; measures 20.92 x 14.34 x 4.18 inches (WxHxD)\nDVD player compatible with DVD video, CD audio, DVD-R/RW, MP3, WMA, and JPEG (Kodak Picture and FujiColor CDs)\n3:2 pulldown detection and reversal, 3D Y/C digital comb filter, 500 cd/m2 brightness, 500:1 contrast ratio, 1366 x 768-pixel resolution\nInputs: 1 composite, 1 S-Video, 1 component, 1 HDMI, 1 PC VGA, 1 RF\nTwo stereo speakers, 5 watts apiece (10 watts total)", "Name": "Toshiba 23HLV85 23-Inch TheaterWide Flat Panel HD-ready LCD TV/DVD Combo", "ImgURL": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51Z4YW1723L._SY300_.jpg", "ProductID": "B000A5EC9A"}}
