The 64 series LCD's are incredibly slim and have a smaller bezel.  They really look awesome wall-mounted due to the small profile. No other LCD is currently available that is this slim and has this picture quality.  The 64 series TV's also add several tone and picture corrections, an analog PC input, a USB 2.0 port for firmware upgrades, an RS-232 control port and three HDMI 1.3 inputs.  The picture quality actually seems to be slightly better which is amazing because the 62 series looked fantastic (specifications indicate a better backlight system).I am a professional AV systems design engineer and part of my job is to keep up on new TVs.  This unit is currently the best we've seen for a consumer model and we specify it all the time. I highly recommend this unit or any of the 64 series.", "Date": "September 30, 2007"}, {"Title": "great LCD, Great Technology, Very Thin", "Author": "I. international", "ReviewID": "RQ7BB0QCZMIVI", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Compared to Samsung 1080p with tons of reviews and which I returned simply because of lack of picture formats this TV rocks.In short, Samsung provide you with great and bright LCD panels but with zero technology. so a letterbox directtv movie on a 32 inch Samsung will be actually 22\" viewing area on the screen. Try to use the picture formats such as wide and zoom and you get blurry and distorted picture which is to me impossible to view. This is were Sharp step up with it's technology. Picture formats are all viewable so you can super stretch a 4:3 picture without almost any distortion. The only con is lack of brightness (450 nits compare to 500-550 in other popular LCDs) but the blacks are superior. You can increase the brightness by playing with the contrast to full but then it is not like the Samsung whites but less eye soaring. I found that the Samsung brightness is great but after a while watching it sores on your eyes and the Sharp auto dimming feature is great for movies and it is fully controlled by the user.Aside to that, this TV is probably the thinnest and idle for hanging on the wall. The connections on the back are extremely well thought after for wall hanging. It seems that what people complaint about in the previous models in series 62U is now fully addressed in the 64U.I am perfectionist and recommend this TV. Most of my comparisons were for regular directtv broadcast.HDTV and DVDs shows naturally prefect. The colors are well defined as oppose to Samsung and you have tons of options to program it to your taste. Sound from these little speakers is the best comparing to not a few LCDs I had. Very well done!It needed 2-3 days to break-in and some customization. It is professional TV for professional users but very user friendly and within no time anybody can easily program the brightness, contrast, color and other cool features to its liking.

Picture Qaulity is SHARP & rich. Colours are Vivid, BLACK is Deep black.3. Easy to setup, thin like 4 pancakes, stcaked.4. Regular DVDs/Video games look alive on this TV.5. Tons of HDMI & other connectivty ports.CONS:1. Remote is too big.2. Caliberation is not easy to do & i could find much help online as well.3.

Origonally targeted the samsung 4665 but a friend alerted me to the Sharp price reduction. Talked to a bunch of verizon service techs and the general concensus was Sharp, Sony or Panasonic are worth the money. The others are iffy, and by reading all the reviews on the latest LCD's, they're right. Stayed up til 2am hooking it up, big difference from the old Pioneer rear proj I had. MAKE SURE your cable box is sending the 1080i signal out to tv or you will not get the picture you are looking for. Check the cable box manual for instructions, OR try this. (after you have hooked up your tv to cable box) Still in 480 mode? leave tv on, turn off cable box, push and hold menu button on cable box and the menu to change the res. should pop up. Do yourself a favor, go to Costco and get the fiber optic cables package for $75. Much cheaper than getting overpriced ones along with tv purchase. DEFINITELY purchase the longest extended warrantee with this, not a big fan of ext. warr's but its a major purchase. Remote control takes time to get used to. PICTURE IS AWESOME!!! Purchase was worth it in the long run. Wanted to get last years model for $1388 but for $300 more I got a better tv all around. You can prob find it a bit cheaper but I had the money now and got the \"itch\" so.... Thinner, smaller bezel, lighter, blacks are black, no trailing or shadowing on fast action, side inputs for gaming, 1 more HDMI input (3) and a PC input, 4 ms response are the upgrades from last years model. I cant walk away from it. Worst part is, Im leaving for Fla. for Christmas tomorrow and my house sitter is going to have all the fun with my new tv.

I'm going to break down the unit so novice buyers can be aware of what to expect from this televisionPanel (Television or Display):This is the bread and butter of this unit.  Before you turn it on you will marvel at the unit's ultra slim design and the piano black finish.  A glorious picture quality with blacks levels that rival the most expensive units.  The vibrant colors jump and the details are nothing short of amazing.  I'd also recommend using a Home Theater calibration disc to get the best picture that suits you.  If you are viewing this in SD then you are doing this unit and yourself a dis-service.  This unit begs to be hooked up to a high definition source. Any gaming system, Blu-Ray, HD Satellite or HD Cable.  Make an investment and you'll understand then.  Oh yes replace the remote ASAP. As a side note, I've had HD Cable and HD Satellite.  The banding issues do exist but are so minute that it really wasn't a drawback.  It also seem less apparent on the HD Satellite then the HD Cable this was using the same HDMI port and cable, while watching the same programs.Speakers:The speakers on this television are just plain weak.  But given the size of the unit what can you expect.  I'd highly recommend to anyone if it is feasible then by all means bypass the speakers and get yourself a surround sound system that supports HDMI and 5.1 Dolby digital after all is said and done this is the unit to beat for 1080p LCD's.(update) after 3 years of quality service this unit went belly up.

Let me tell you how much research I did based on value and quality.  Also, I was torn between the cost effective Samsung DLPs or this.  I decided I wanted a slick thin TV with a superb picture and viewing angle.  I hooked this up to my HD satellite and HD DVD player via HDMI.  I messed around with different picture settings that I found on various forums and the picture looks great at 1920x1080p60.  One thing to mention, if you purchase a Toshiba HD player, don't bother getting one that supports 1080p24 because this TV doesn't support the format.  However, that isn't much of an issue because the processing on this TV is one of the best on the market.  It will take a 1080i picture and make it look ALOMST every bit as good as 1080p24 but you need a really good eye to see the difference.

Doesn't matter when the TOSLINK audio out stopped working a month after I set it up. Sound is still decent even without digital out.

Mine broke for no apparent reason less than 2 years from purchase (my kids were just watching their cartoons, then it blanked out). And since it's over the standard 1 year parts and labor, Sharp will do little to alleviate the upcoming repair costs.Google this: power and opc lights blinking.  Apparently, this is the more common 'error code' prevalent on this unit, after the problem shows (no display suddenly). It may require 2 boards to be replaced, to the tune of upwards of $600 (just for parts).  Most complaints I've seen tells of lemon tvs.  Those which are defective within the first few days or weeks of operation.  But as I said, mine broke down before 2 years.

Its not that bad and if I had never gone on to the AVS forum I would probably never had noticed it. If stuff like that bothers you then don't buy this TV or any other LCD TV in this price range. They all have some sort of artifact type issues. If you don't want any artifacts or motion blur then go plasma. You can go 120hz on a LCD but your going to pay a lot more money for the same TV with a higher refresh rate.The good...I think Sharp has the best overall HD picture and color compared to any other TV in this price range. The colors are fantastic and I like the fact that you can fine tune the TV to your hearts desire. Black levels look good as well. The TV cabinet is well designed and the sound quality is good. SD channels look alright, better then most of the sets that I have seen out there. There is some motion blur on sports but not near as bad as the entry level Sony and Samsung TVs.The bad...As I stated before it does having banding. Don't fool yourself into thinking you will get one with out it, they all have it. I mostly notice it when I am watching football and the camera does a fast side to side pan. I have read that a lot of people have problems watching hockey because banding that is caused by the ice. The remote is not very good. It wont control my Phillips DVD player or my Sony receiver. For some strange reason it does work with my Motorola cable box.If it weren't for the banding this would be a 5 star TV. I have had it for about 3 weeks now with no other technical issues.

I unfortunately did not do my research prior to buying this television, and was so consumed by the unbelievably low price that I jumped on it.  What a mistake.  After a few weeks of viewing (and researching) I began to notice the vertical banding issue that others have noted seeing with this television.  Most noticeable as noted in other reviews - during panning shots and uniform color screens.  I ended up calling Sharp and they sent out a local repair person to take a look.  The tech immediately agreed that banding was prevalent and took pictures (attempted to anyway - not easily photographed).  I then called up Sharp Aquos customer support, and after some back and forth, I must say that I am pleased with their service.  After owning the TV for 10 months, they reimbursed me a pro-rated portion of the original price (I bought this directly through Sharp).  I know they've offered others exchanges/ replacements, but I insisted that this was unacceptable as I know that although banding is not prevalent on all Sharps, I was not willing to risk it.  It's a shame b/c the TV's functionality and such is really good - the banding and buyer regret was too much for me to take.  Don't buy this television.

While the external sound system is nice, the built in speakers are really quite good and in retrospect I probably would have waited on the surrond sound system and saved some money.To the poster who commented about the home theater... that is pretty common.

Sharp help line said they didn't know what the blinking error codes meant and referred me to a local service center, which based on the reviews, would sit on my TV for 3 months prior to telling it couldn't be fixed or charging an arm and a leg. Figured I would try a couple of boards before throwing it out. Certainly the last time I buy anything made by Sharp.

The television worked beautifully until February 2009 at which time it started experiencing a blanked-out or vertically lined area about 12 x 12 inches in the upper right had corner of the screen.Initially the problem was intermittent but within several weeks the damaged area of the screen became constant.  We contacted Sharp who contacted a local Sharp Electronics Master Service Center.  After four visits to our home and the replacement of both the LCD Controller and an internal cable the problem remains.  And yes, the problem was confirmed to be with the television.Although Sharp Techical Support attempted to diagnose the problem, they were unsuccesful.  Because of their attempts and the attempts of the Service Center I am giving this a 2-star rating.  Otherwise it would be 1-star rating. The unit is out of warranty but we expected a longer service life than 20-months for the Aquos line of Sharp televisions.  The Sharp was purchased to replace a Sony Trinitron that was still working fine  after 18-years of use.We are now researching for a replacement television and the Sharp Aquos line will not even be considered.  We will probably purchase a Sony Bravia LCD since, in our experience, they are a better quality television.", "Date": "March 14, 2009"}, {"Title": "Great Picture, Dumb Remote", "Author": "visin", "ReviewID": "R1PTD493A0QTS4", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Great picture, using over the air digital channel.

A year later, we're still incredibly happy with our purchase.HD signals look incredibly.

This is pretty rare and usually with sports that involve fast panning by the camera.The only other thing I noticed after we got the TV was that commercials are crazy loud. Our old TV I believe had a feature that automatically adjusted the volume level of commercials so they weren't louder than the program.

Was actually shopping for a DVD upconverter. But decided to upgrade the 2 yr old Insignia 32\" 720p.  I like the quick/easy approach, so the First thing I noticed when I tried to hook up my surround speakers was that there is no Headphone jack! Even though that is mentioned on Amazon in the description as a feature.  So now I hope I can find some type of cable to convert the RCA outputs for My speaker system.  I don't expect to upgrade to a new surround setup just for that. If I find any other workaround I'll let you know.  Also I was trying to figure out if I had the latest firmware revision. The manual says to go to Menu/Digital Setup/Identification. Well, how about...this option doesn't exist! So I don't know if I need an update or not. I suppose I have to guess. (I only get the software update option.)  This upscales Std Defn. better than most TVs I have seen, not as grainy. But I am still having a tough time adjusting the greens out of this thing just like the one I noticed in the BB store.  I hoped it was just the way they had adjusted theirs. Also, it is amazing how different the video looks based on the source material. For instance, I was watching a News broadcast the first night and they had 2 interviewees on a split screen. It was amazing how degraded and molten one half of the screen looked and the other half looked decent.  Speaking of which, the blacks, yes they are very black, but my picture often looks too black. I have tried adjusting contrast and brightness various ways, but I'll still get a scene where I feel like it's too dark to see the action. No banding yet. Maybe it's just me.  I am planning to try one of those \"Digital Video Essentials\" DVD's that were mentioned on one of the forums.  One other thing I seldom see mentioned. These make the most AWESOME PC monitors!!  I love seeing my photos so large and using MediaPlayer visuals!  I don't ever see much info on this type of usage. But that RS232 jack is Gold in my book.  It was even amazing on my old 32\". But I did expect this newer, higher-end TV to handle a resolution finer than 1024x768. Hope I just missed a setting somewhere. I'll call Cust. Svc. this week and check them out.

The 42\" was beautiful, the 46\" is beautiful +4\"!!It is a superb television, and MUCH better than the Sony Bravia 46\" that my son-in-law just purchased.  Lighter, thinner, bezel is smaller so it looks more sleek and picture is better in my opinion.  The picture is sharp, even with 4 south facing windows behind and to the side of it.I am not sure why they would place some of the inputs on the side of it, however, but I do not anticipate needing them anyway.Be SURE to sign up for the Aquos Advantage program.  You get great customer service, a warranty extension, and firmware upgrades if needed - and it is free.  By the way, I think the Sharp extended warranty program is better than the program offered through Amazon.After extensive comparison shopping of all the major brands for 12+ months, I am satisfied that the LC46D64U 46\" Aquos is the best value on the market.

Ever since I set my eyes on the crisp picture and vibrant color that high definition had to offer I was determined to have one. So after years of waiting and saving I finally decided I was going to take the plunge. I took the time to do my research and after a month or so of comparing reviews and staring aimlessly at in store floor models I decided that the Sharp Aquos 46 inch LCD HDTV was exactly what I was looking for. After all, it was a quality product that got great reviews at a comparable price, how could I possibly go wrong?After I bought my television I took it home and carefully unpacked it, plugged it, turned it on and basked in all the glory that Sharp had to offer. For a short time, the relationship was a good one. I came home and it dazzled me with a crisp fluid picture, superior sound, and a full 1080p resolution, I was in love. A whole new world was at my finger tips, Dirty Jobs never looked so dirty, I was totally smitten. Then suddenly without notice, everything changed.The screen went black and the sound went off. This happened in 20 to 25 minute intervals. Frustrated, I did what every good consumer would do, I called customer support. Naturally they walked me through all the obvious troubleshooting steps, is the TV on? Is the power chord plugged in? Is the sleep timer on? No, no and no. Twenty five wasted Verizon minutes later they decided they were going to send out a tv repair man to resolve the issue. Keep in mind, at this point I'd owned the TV for one month. The repairman determined (on the phone) the problem was the circuit board. How can you determine the solution to a problem without physically diagnosing it? Initially, after the parts were replaced everything went smoothly. The TV, by all accounts, was running full steam...at least for a little while.Within three days, the screen went black and the sound went off...again. I sat on my couch perplexed, how could Sharp put out such a subpar product? What ever happened to the customers always right? After all I owned the product for little over a month, don't I deserve a new television? I guess not. Suffice to say I'm not happy. Tomorrow I'll call Sharp again, and most likely they'll be sending out ANOTHER repairman to not fix my television.
