The heading is wrong on this TV, it is a 240Hz. It has a PMR 240hz type screen this screen has 8ms reaction time. If you get the 55\" or the 46\" the screen has a 5 ms reaction time which is even faster, this is important for sports and Video games. That speed make a top notch computer monitor on its own. The TV has a great 1080p Picture and sports are no problem on this TV and LED keeps it well lighted in our bright room. Sound is nice and basic if you want to listen to the best you have to buy a sound system though. My wife like it because it simple to use and it doesn't make her dizzy, because she hates 3D movies anywhere. This TV has most smart options except for, 3D and a keyboard input which will cost at least $500 plus with any other TV. I use the Wi-Fi more than I thought. Next TV I will have a keyboard input. CON: The TV came with out it's four screws for mounting to the stand, but customer service was quick to answer and sent out the screws and told me, what size they are so i could buy them at the store if I was in a hurry, but the TV sit on the stand with out the screws any ways and I will wait..", "Date": "December 18, 2012"}, {"Title": "This is a great TV from my favorite brand.", "Author": "Patrick", "ReviewID": "R1ZTXH8HR0CM3Q", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "My wife and I bought a Phillips television for our first LCD HDTV nearly five years ago.

It's super easy to use and set up.  Other tv's I tried had too many unnecessary options making it more difficult to set up but maybe a way for the others to justify a higher sell price. I love the tv, it's sexy shiny frame, awesome picture quality, quick access to Netflix with built in wi fi.  I'd definitely buy another Philips product.", "Date": "October 17, 2013"}, {"Title": "Great Picture", "Author": "Neil_O", "ReviewID": "R34877X3E9B0JW", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This is the 6th Philips HD TV I have purchased for personal use and as gifts.  Two things I have always liked about Philips: 1) Very natural skin tones - the in-store demos on the screen may look dramatic on other brands, but look carefully at the accuracy of the skin tones.  When you get the TV home, the bulk of viewing you'll do will include human faces, and Philips reproduces these as well as any brand. 2) In the picture format menu, Philips includes an \"Automatic\" setting.  This works great at maximizing the viewing size of media not originally produced in HD without distorting the images.  Philips is the only brand that I've seen to do this very well.In my experience with Philips TVs, the sound quality has never been one of their best features.  However, this model is one of the better ones in terms of sound quality.  If you want impressive sound, you will need to add a surround system.  Even though this is a 55-inch TV, the basic-black look of this model and thin bezel help this TV blend into the room and not dominate it when the TV is off.I have read several reviews stating that the picture on this TV leans heavily to the blues and they recommend some significant adjustments to increase the reds.  Maybe it's just my TV, but I don't see these tendencies in the out-of-the box picture on the TV.  I tried the suggested adjustments for about a week, but found that they upset the near-perfect skin-tone balance that I like in Philips, so I went back to the default settings for reds, blues, etc.I have made some simpler tweaks to default picture settings starting from the \"Standard\" setting.  Here's what I use:Backlight: 15Contrast: 85Brightness: 42Color: 43Tint: 0Sharpness: 3Noise Reduction: OffLight Sensor: OffBlack Stretch: MaximumDynamic Contrast: MediumGamma: +1Dynamic Backlight: MinimumColor Enhancement: OffIt's a great TV; I'd buy it again.", "Date": "January 2, 2014"}, {"Title": "Nice tv", "Author": "TUCK", "ReviewID": "R2S85BPTM4ZX7V", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Nice tv, full function of smart tv. Best if you invest more with a home theatre system to go with the tv.", "Date": "September 12, 2013"}, {"Title": "Great TV", "Author": "TheGuy", "ReviewID": "R2WHLQHKSVIDD6", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I've had this TV for about 8 months now.  I've had no problems with it whatsoever, and the picture is great.  I found some reviews talking about the blues being off and offering up calibration settings, and I found that my set actually did not have the blues problem they spoke of, I modified their calibration settings to not include the huge tweaks to blue and my picture is perfect (pretty easy to find if you google it, I think it may have been cnet related).One thing I really like is the motion on this tv, even with all the motion features turned on, it looks very minimal and natural unlike a lot of TV's today.  It doesn't add the very 3d effect that some other sets do but it just looks so smooth.  I had no interest in 3d or any advanced setting so this TV was perfect for me.  I had a vizio and sony bravia before this and I like my set better, but if you like the weird unnatural soap opera 3d effect that some of the enhanced motion TV's give this may not be the TV for you.", "Date": "October 1, 2013"}, {"Title": "Broke within 8 months:  DO NOT BUY", "Author": "handsomematt", "ReviewID": "R3G20H9E4C9FWL", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "This TV is absolute crap.  It has broken twice within 8 months of purchasing it brand new.  Yes, it is under warranty; however, they will not replace it.  Instead, they just keep sending out a repair company that they have contracted to try different things to fix it. Thus, we have not had a TV in our bedroom for 2 weeks *(again, second time it has broken).  Phillips makes a poor quality product and has terrible customer service. If I could give it less than one star, I would.", "Date": "March 8, 2013"}, {"Title": "Excellent TV for the price", "Author": "GirlX \"\"Addicted to Amazon\"\"", "ReviewID": "R1BT5HF9Y10WW0", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This TV has many features and for the price, I am very happy with it.I will summarize, but feel free to post a question if you'd like specific information:- This is actually a 240Hz TV, and not 120Hz as the ad states.- Color and picture settings come up when the TV is turned on, to be set by the user. Very easy to use.- Wireless connection was a breeze, the TV brought up a list of available wifi connections immediately and connected without issue.- Lots of pre-loaded apps, including NetFlix, Vulu, YouTube, Pandora to name a few. Most of the others I probably won't use, but Pandora and YouTube work great!- I actually prefer the \"soap opera effect\" so I have set the motion settings to maximum on this TV. However, it can be toned down.- Picture quality is excellent. Clear and crisp, colors are spot on. The room it's kept in has a large window, and I have no issue with glare at all.- The volume is ok, bass is pretty loud. However, if you're looking for it to sound like a movie theater in your living room, you may want to get extra speakers. For my taste, it's plenty loud in a room of approximate size 20x20.- Media Connect is a very nice perk. Software was downloaded to my laptop (for Windows 8) and it was as easy as selecting \"start projecting\" from the laptop. The TV did the rest, with no additional settings required. Absolutely foolproof.- It is rather lightweight considering the size, and extremely thin.. 2\" at the widest.- The base swivels, I didn't know that when I bought it, but I was very happy about it.- There is an option to load from USB, but I haven't tried it yet.- 4 HDMI cables was very convenient for me, compared to 2 on my other TV.- Although the remote has no QWERTY keyboard, the menus do have a keyboard on screen to select letters. I find this to be covnenient and possibly easier than trying to see the buttons in the dark.- It came packaged very securely with styrofoam. The box had hard pieces of cardboard (to prevent bending/damage) around the corners of the box and was wrapped in shrink wrap.  Fortunately, the packaging wasn't excessive, so the TV was easy to get out of the box.I wanted to also comment that many people mention not to touch an LED screen, as damage could occur.  While I do not recommend touching the screen either, I did want to point out that I absolutely manhandled this TV and it caused no issues. I was trying to carry it up 2 flights of stairs in my home without help, and I very nearly dropped it on the floor due to my klutzy nature.  I was pleasantly surprised I didn't do any damage to the screen.I would absolutely recommend this TV, as I feel it stands up to the competition very well. Friends of mine have that other brand (the most popular one right now) and I truly believe this TV is just as good, if not better.  This is the third TV from Philips that I have purchased, all of which have been excellent quality.  The other two are still fully functional, I just wanted a new TV with the smart features.  Going by my past experiences with their stellar customer service and the quality of the products were the major deciding factors to purchase this over other brands.", "Date": "January 16, 2014"}, {"Title": "B-day gift for the wife", "Author": "thomas e siverson II", "ReviewID": "R1FT0H539VTOWK", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This television was a b-day gift for my wife.
