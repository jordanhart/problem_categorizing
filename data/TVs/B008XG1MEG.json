I love TV's and the latest gadgets .. I am not a professional and my review is more from a personal point of view.My TV arrived yesterday, replacing the Panasonic VT50 65\".. While the VT50 was a stunning display, it was only that way with HD content and in the dark. When in the dark, that tv blew me away, however during the day and watching older TV shows.. I was just not impressed. I was looking for a TV that I look at any time and feel really good about.This one really does the trick, even though it is 10\" smaller .. I am so pleased with my decision to swap TVs spending the same amount of money.I have never owned a Sony before, the Samsung 8000 was too gimmicky for me.. (I am not going to start talking to my TV or hand gesturing in front of it.. not to mention all the reviews posted)This model to me is the perfect for my home. I LOVE the display.. bright, crisp..  just a joy to look at.A few things that I tried to find out about this TV (before my purchase) that I could not locate anywhere are as follows:  (hope it helps)*You can use the following model of 3D Glasses: TDG-BR750, BR250, BR200, BR100, BR50, Playstation 3D Glasses.*Minimal Glare (compared to VT50)*Quality sturdy stand, swivels and tilts*Wireless function works very well and is easy to set up.Bottom line..  I am much happier with this purchase!! While the VT50 has such a high rating, It was not a tv for me.. It has great reviews but if you look at the amount of used units offered by Amazon, I think I am not alone. (I mentioned the VT50 in my review, because many people out there seem to want to know how it compares to this model)I will be adding to this post as I try out more features such as 3D etc..Please feel free to ask any questions you might have.. I am happy to reply.****edit same day as post 8:09pmI have had a chance to give 3D a thorough test, watching Hugo and the Avengers. I am still impressed!The Colors, Black Level, and clarity are fantastic.. In my opinion 3D is more enjoyable on this TV than what I remember from the movies.I also tested 2D to 3D conversion, it creates a bit of depth and enhances the viewing experience. Even in daylight, the 2D to 3D conversion worked nicely.", "Date": "October 9, 2012"}, {"Title": "Viewing experience on another level", "Author": "Paul M. \"Paul\"", "ReviewID": "R34NX7TKAWTOVO", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I am giving this television 5 stars even though I am currently waiting on a replacement unit from Amazon because of several bright red pixels in the middle of the screen. Like always, Amazon was top notch with delivery, customer service, and response...handing this issue quickly and with no drama.  The new replacement TV is expected to arrive tomorrow and this time when I power it up at delivery, I will open to Sony Home menu (full graphic screen) which obviously shows the pixel flaws.  Yes packing it back up will be a hassle but well worth the final result.This picture is by the far the best I have ever seen on an LCD and I have seen many.  Currently we have 4 other Sony XBR LCD TV's of different ages and sizes and there is no comparison to this new model.  This XBR55HX950 will replace a Pioneer Elite Pro 530HD rear projection TV (nearly 10 years old and still kicking); which says a lot because the Pioneer is fabulous but getting dated and many possible replacements have come and gone once compared beside this TV.In general, after quick calibration and tweaking the XBR55HX950 picture is approaching the level of our dedicated home theater(OPPO BDP-95 BluRay, Anthem Statement D2 processor, JVC Reference Series projector, Stewart 110\" Studiotek 130 G3 screen).  This Sony's white levels, black levels, and contrast are stunning and gone are the common LCD dragged jerky motion images...this TV is fast and smooth displaying motion.  The black is so black that in a completely dark room, the screen light showing black between commercials is virtually undetectable. We are displaying Blu-Rays with the Sony BDPS790 which is a great player and very convenient with the HDMI link control.  I cannot comment on 3D performance, as we did not buy this TV for 3D as I consider it too gimmicky and fake looking irregardless of how it is presented. I may borrow some glasses from a friend so our children can check it out, but that is not a priority.  Also, regarding our children they already have figured out the menu system, switching between sources, playing Netflix, and playing Blu-Rays...they are tech savvy for 6 and 7 years old.The color depth and edge detail is spot on and sharp looking with displayed images so real and natural.  Our children were watching a movie with a bright white Maltese dog via Netflix streaming and they even commented on how white this dog was and how its hair was so real looking...a difficulty for LCD's displaying white.  It does take a little tweaking of the settings and there are quite a few settings but I like Sony's menu system.  I do still feel that with more involved TV menus Sony should adapt the format of a webpage explorer  bar [like their website]with main features across the top, multiple drop downs, and use the Return button for Back.The networking setup, Netflix, Amazon Prime videos, and DLNA worked flawless and all our videos [AVCHD), pictures, and music came through from our QNAP NAS Twonky Server with no issues.  The file interface could certainly be improved with features such as Play All, Select particular videos to play or pictures to display, and image thumbnails (think about something like the excellent PC and tablet interface for SONOS for those who know it).  The OPPO has a little better interface in this direction.  The i-Manual is great...it is about time this convenient feature is there for quick reference of features particular for those not so technically experienced and it can be updated as the firmware changes.To sum things up, I highly recommend this television, but if you need something bigger perhaps wait for the 65\" model which will be coming out soon.UPDATED 10/10/2012:  The new replacement TV arrived on 10/4 as scheduled and the display was perfect.  After spending more time with the TV, we love it even more.  I have tested the built in speakers and to those who do not know about these thin TV's; do not expect full sound.  Even after tweaking all the settings, the sound is weak and metallic.  Most will be using processors or external speakers; so even though this is not deal breaker for such a great TV...plan on supplementing the sound to be in line with the great picture.  One other annoyance is getting out of Netflix or Amazon video back to...cable for instance.  The Input button on the remote give an error when it is pressed and will not return to HDMI or Components inputs.", "Date": "October 3, 2012"}, {"Title": "Banding problems mar an otherwise spectacular TV", "Author": "Behzad", "ReviewID": "R1PL391K5VNOBO", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "There are so many things to like about this TV. In many ways, the perfect TV as far as I am concerned. Unfortunately, the vertical banding on the two units I have received so far (that's correct, I am on my second one at this point) is just way too noticeable for me to ignore, especially considering this model's \"premier\" status.There is no doubt that other than the banding issue, this is a clear 5-star TV. But the banding is so noticeable and distracting that I have no choice but to lower the rating all the way down to 2 stars (debating 2 or 3 stars, 2.5 is not an option). I frankly find it to be an inexcusable compromise on a $5000+ TV set (and yet still contemplating keeping this TV because I like it so much in every other way). I know, I it doesn't make much sense, but that's where this TV leaves me.Here are some of the highlights:* Exceptional black levels and contrast, the best I have seen. Yes, there is a little bit of blooming if you really want to nit-pick, but I'll happily take that when accompanied by the most amazing inky blacks I have ever seen on a TV (maybe OLEDs are better, but I haven't seen them). To my eye, this TV has better black levels than Elite or any of the Plasmas. Full array LED with local diming and the OptiContrast panel really shine here.* Very nice and bright colors. Overall picture is extremely pleasing to the eye (the included \"Scenes\" provide a good selection of settings to match the content you are watching).* Pretty decent \"Smart TV\" features including Internet content options (Netflix, Amazon Instant/Prime Video, Hulu, Sony, etc.), network remote features (iOS, Android apps), Skype, and basic browsing capability (not sure who really uses that)* Motion flow XR 960 does a very good job with minimizing any kind of motion blur. You simply don't have to worry about watching sports on this TV.* No problems in a bright room. The TV is bright enough to handle daytime TV watching without issues and glare is for the most part kept in check.* This may seem odd to most, but aesthetics of a TV are very important to me as it tends to be a main focal point of any room due to location and size. And this TV does not disappoint. A nice silver frame and edge-to-edge glass result in a modern, clean, and attractive look. Nothing tacky here (rose gold frames, etc. that you may see on other brands). As others have noted, the stand is the only semi-tacky item, but it's a non-issue for me as I intend to wall-mount the TV (if I keep it). The TV is not particularly thin, but that's to be expected with a full-array LED panel.As already mentioned, there is only a single real negative to this TV for me (banding), but it's a pretty major one. Others have noted the price, but I don't feel like this TV is overpriced. There simply isn't a large available selection of premium TVs with full array LED and local dimming. And the ones that are available are no less costly than the Sony. Sony also eliminated a few features compared to last year's HX929, most notably the Presence Sensor, but nothing that I really miss. Also somewhat surprisingly, they switched to a less capable and cheaper looking (and feeling) remote compared to last year's HX929. Again, not a real deal-breaker as most people buying a high-end TV like this are most likely using their universal remotes.Another minor gripe is lack of options for turning off the front status LED (the Sony logo can be turned off however). This was also an issue on last year's HX929 and hopefully something that Sony addresses with an update at some point.As far as banding goes, I simply don't know enough about the nitty-gritty of LED technology (as related to LCD backlighting) or the manufacturing process of these TVs to know what technical challenges exist and why controlling banding is so difficult. But given how common the problem is with many makes and models of TV, it must be a fairly difficult problem to solve (just search for banding problems with Samsung ES8000 as an example). That said, my 2011 55\" HX929 does not have this problem. And with the higher price point and advanced technologies that Sony put in the HX950, I expect nothing less from this TV.In case you think I am pixel-peeping and looking for the problem on test patterns, rest assured that I am not going out of my way to look for this problem, it simply finds me. It is that noticeable in every day viewing, particularly if you are viewing the TV from any sort of angle (the banding is a little less noticeable when viewed from dead-center, but fully noticeable with as little as a 20 degree angle). It is severe enough to be noticeable even in many static scenes, not just  panning shots across lighter colored backgrounds. I will try to post some pictures from both the 55\" HX929 and the 65\" HX950 later on.I am now debating keeping this TV or perhaps going ahead with yet another replacement (I am sure Amazon would not be thrilled, although they are always amazing to deal with). I am simply torn between this TV's many pluses and its single, yet significant, minus.=============Update 01/09/2013I have posted 4 pictures to show banding on the HX950. Two pictures are from my second HX950 (1st one had even worse banding), and the other two are from my 55\" HX929 which doesn't display any significant banding that I can see. I took these pictures using each TV's built-in input selection screen to avoid any source-related issues and to compare the performance of both TVs on the same image. Keep in mind that banding is sometimes more noticeable depending on the image being displayed and the small photos are masking some of the problems (e.g. the less pronounced bands away from the center of the TV are more difficult to see in these pictures). But hopefully they give you at least a feel for what the problem looks like and if it's something that you would be concerned with as you make your decision about this TV.", "Date": "January 9, 2013"}, {"Title": "Sony XBR55HX950 55-inch 240HZ 1080p 3D Internet", "Author": "AZ-Bob \"AZ-Bob\"", "ReviewID": "R1B4EVVR79ZIK1", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Got mine yesterday, quick initial review... Phenomenal!!  Did very little tweaking on setup as of yet, but let me tell you such a superb picture we were blown away. It bought our high definition viewing experience to a new level.  Easy network setup.  Amazon delivery was excellent, brought inside, and tested before leaving. We have not tried the 3D yet.I will update my review after playing with it over the weekend.  But so far, extremely satisfied.Update 10/9/12:After a couple of weeks with the TV, we just love it.  Yes, the 3D is excellent.  We had not really expected to like or use 3D at home, but we have found it much better than going to a theater.  I highly recommend this unit.The online content is easy to get to, with several sources to choose from, amazon prime, Netflix, sony entertainment, etc.  I am running wireless N, via a cable modem, and have had only one bad day of streaming.

Sony is definitely not the Sony I grew up on. They now assemble their flagship TVs in Mexico and boy does it show. I'm on the exchange merry-go-round and I'm on set number 4 right now. Every single set has significant banding issues. I can't imagine I'll find one without it so I'll call Sony and see what they can do, I'm done hauling a 65\" TV back and forth....it's not that much fun believe it or not. I'm holding out hope that Sony can deliver one without significant banding, because aside from the banding, it's a very impressive set with an amazing picture.

I believe that has more to do with each person's individual tastes/ set up. For me, this TV is absolutely perfect. The color reproduction is extremely accurate, the motion handling is nearly perfect and does not create and weird SOE (soap opera effect).Fist off let me tell you about my set up. My tv room is extremely dark room, darker than a typical movie theater, so there is no ambient light which can cause glare. The TV is basically a giant black mirror when powered off, but when it is turned on, ANY and ALL reflections are eliminated. Now your room probably isn't as dark as mine, and if there are any bright lights your tv is going to show reflections. There is an anti-glare coating but it probably won't help you.I personally do not care for the stand, but I do plan on wall mounting it anyway so it's not a deal breaker. I honestly don't see how it is a huge issue for people, get some black felt and cover it up or paint it black. Cheap and easy solution right thereNow let's get to the actual performance of the TV. Here are my settings, I use them for everything. Set it and forget it. These settings provide a natural skin and color tone. It may be too cool for you, and I do plan to update this review with some warm settings when I recalibrate it.Scene Mode: GeneralPicture Mode: StandardBack-light: 1( again its a super dark room, you might need to be higher)Picture: Max (but reduce to 85 or even 60 for 3D content to help with crosstalk)Brightness: 52Color: 60Hue: 0Color Temperature: NeutralSharpness: 65Noise Reduction: OffMPEG Noise Reduction: OffDot Noise Reduction: OffReality Creation: Manual with Resolution 20 and Noise Filtering Min OR Off, based on preference.Smooth Gradation: MediumMotionFlow: StandardCineMotion: Auto 1Black Corrector: OffAdvanced Contrast Enhancer: OFF for 2D content.

Both of which look amazing, now tv broadcasts can vary wildly. I find that certain channels/shows look better/worse than others. ESPN, Discovery/History channels look very good. Fox sports, honestly, kinda looks like crap. I suspect it is because of the high contrast and excellent picture that this set is capable of, the TV may bring out the natural flaws in the source. Garbage in, garbage out so they say. I'm not saying that you will be disappointed in your general TV viewing, but you wont be wowed by it.For me, this isn't a huge issue. My general TV viewing is done in another room, not in my home theater. I really only bought this TV to watch blurays and play games on and if that is what you plan on doing, then this is the TV for you.If you have any questions, feel free to ask them.ThanksUPDATE #1After downloading a software update, I noticed that TV broadcasts have improved. Most channels now look good, though no where near as good as bluray. There is still some blurring but it is something I can live with.I am still working on some settings for Warm viewing, I gave the Dark Knight a run through and I found that blooming can be a little bit of an issue with my above posted settings. After applying my Warm 2 settings, I found that blooming is almost eliminated. It's still there, but you really have to look for it.My next update will be about 3d. I am still waiting on the glasses.UPDATE #2I received my 3d glasses, the PlayStation branded glasses, the other day so i decided to give Prometheus a watch. I saw Prometheus in IMAX and I originally thought that the 3d was very subtle and well done, on the XBR the 3d is much better and really \"pops\" at you. Now i all honestly, I do typically hate 3d, it usually gives me headaches it and makes movies unwatchable because of picture quality loss. I experienced none of this while watching Prometheus. The image does get a little darker because of the glasses, but I did not notice any loss of detail or dip in quality in the picture. Best off all, i could tilt my head, lie on my side and the picture never degraded. AWESOME! I am actually very impressed by this TV's 3d capabilities.That being said, I did try and watch some non 3d content( Adventure Time) in Forced 3d mode. And I immediately noticed some crosstalk and had a headache within a few minutes. There are some options which may or may not help with the crosstalk, but I did not play around too much with that as my head was getting ready to explode.Next update will be about the Warm settings I promised or gaming.UPDATE #3God Frakking Dangit! OK. SO after some serious game playing and movie watching sessions, I started to notice some DSE (dirty screen effect). For example, while playing Borderlands 2. When i slowly moved the analog stick, I would start to see blotches on the screen. Basically my awesome picture would deteriorate. Even in blurays, I started to see the same thing. TV sports,like hockey and football became unwatchable.I'm not sure if my tv always had this and just didn't notice it, or if it started to wear out(the tv is less than a month old at this point). Either way it will be exchanged.UPDATE #4Good news, bad news.Fist bad, I received my 3rd TV and it has a single dead pixel.The Good news is that the blur surrounding everything is much better on this TV.I have not decided what i will do with this set. I may keep it depending on how noticeable the dead pixel is or if i am done with the 950 all together.For those keeping track, this will be my 3rd set.1st set - 2 dead pixels2nd set - motion blur and DSE3rd Set- 1 dead pixel less blur and DSE", "Date": "November 20, 2012"}, {"Title": "XBR-55HX950 TV", "Author": "phil", "ReviewID": "R2BDHAKIQS0H7W", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "PROS:1.  There's no difference between a dark scene and the TV Off...in other words, it gets really dark!  Glass is just plain beautiful, and a lot more pleasant to look at when the TV is off than my old XBR3.  It's just a work of ART.2.  It takes about half the time to start than the XBR3.  Colors are very nice, and the 3D feature works nicely.  It recognized the BDP-S590 on the first try, but I had to reset the PS3 (1st generation) to its factory default setting to get it to recognize that the TV was 3D capable.  This TV replaced my 7 year old, 40 inch XBR 3, and I'm happy about the purchase.  In fact, the XBR3 and this TV were the same price, but I faced it...7 years of technological advances do show up with this TV.4.  Compared to the XBR3, this TV has wireless ability; ability to deal with a lot fewer wires; less heat production during operation; and the many other capabilities does lead me to believe that the TV was worth every penny that I paid for.5. It takes about half the time to start than the XBR3.  Colors are very nice, and the 3D feature works nicely.  It recognized the BDP-S590 on the first try, but I had to reset the PS3 (1st generation) to its factory default to get it to recognize that the TV was 3D capable.6.  Streaming services are nice when the signals go straight to the TV, and enjoying youtube in the living room is just an added bonus.7.  The TV stands allows you to tilt the tv up and down, and turn it sideways about 45 degrees to either side, thus giving you access to the back panel without having to lift the TV.8.  Firmware updatable wirelessly, so the product is easily updated if the need arises.CONS:1.  No buttons! Need the remote, or the Sony App for iPod/IPad to control the TV.2.  Takes a bit to get used to sound going toward the back, but no biggie, since I rather look at that 1 piece glass than to look at speaker grills in the front.  It's by no means a negative, since this TV is just beautiful, both: On and OFF.3.  I wished it had more RAM to load full webpages when searching the internet.4.  I also wished it was bluetooth capable to be able to use it with a bluetooth keyboard for searching the web, and typing passwords, but if I want to search the web, I use my iMAC.I've had two Sony TVs in the past...the XBR3, and a Z series in the master bedroom, and they're both still serving me well.  I've had this TV for about a month now, and after utilizing the set up instructions for color, sound, etc., as seen on many blogs around the web, I was up and running in about a couple of hours.This TV is definitely a nice upgrade, and since I had never had issues with Sony TVs in the past (problem wise), why change?  I had also recommended Sony to my in-laws, and my own parents, and those sets are still alive and kicking.  The first Samsung I bought 8 years ago, right before the 1080P televisions came out, malfunctioned on me after 1 month of use, and I haven't gone back to that ever since.  I do take first impressions very seriously!It's true that there's a cloud effect on small bright images when surrounded by dark scenes, but if you are able to sit down, and enjoy a good movie here and there, you can definitely tell that this product is a high quality product.  I was thinking of upgrading to a living room projector system, but a really good one costs over $10,000, and they're still too dark for 3D showings.  This TV costs a quarter of that, and delivers good 3D images.  I have seen Avatar, Avengers, and Thor in 3D, and the effects are just beautiful.The four 3D glasses I bought were the latest titanium ones, and I find them easy to wear over my own prescription glasses over extended amounts of time without an issue.If you're on the market for a new TV, and are torn among brands and capabilities, I would recommend to concentrate on the basics and stick with a good picture quality.  A TV with a better picture than this one still costs over $2000 over this set, and the other TVs with similar capabilities to this one did score lower in the professional comparison reviews.  I would say, pay the extra $1000 it costs, and be free of buyer's remorse.", "Date": "January 3, 2013"}, {"Title": "The best TV picture I have ever seen.

After researching options, my first thoughts were the 70\" Sharp but after spending a little time watching the screen during a football game, I knew this TV was not going to work (AND Sharp is on the doorstep of bankruptcy which is not encouraging when considering a major purchase like this one). I also looked at the Elite (also another Sharp product), but in my opinion, the image was superior on the Sony. I also considered the Samsung 8000 (and I have an older Samsung 52\" which looks great), but this TV did not 'wow' me when I looked at it in a few stores.I am not a TV guru, but I will give some opinions on the quality of the image:- Black levels are amazing. So much so that when the TV is on and displaying no image (ie no input from the HDMI source), you can't tell the TV is on except if you leave option to allow the SONY logo to illuminate (which I do as I have already had a situation where the kids switched off the blu-ray and left the TV on and I only noticed because the SONY logo was illuminated).- Football looks great without judder. This was my number one concern and I was focused on Plasma specifically for this reason but I am still worried about screen burn in (and I have kids so there will be times when the TV will be left on with a still image).- It seems like the best image comes when there are no image enhancers activated (frankly, it doesn't seem like all of the picture bells and whistles actually do a whole lot) - this doesn't matter as the basic settings seem to deliver the best picture.- The sound from the TV seems pretty good, but we listen through the surround, so I can't really comment on how the speakers really stand up. Does anyone buying a 65\" TV really expect to listen to it without external speakers anyway?- The 3D works very well. It was irritating to have to purchase separate 3D glasses when you spend $5k for a TV, but it works like a champ.- I can see how viewing angle could be a problem for some people. 45 degrees from center is about right in terms of having no image degradation, but this will never be an issue in my set-up and I think it would be awkward to sit that close and to the side of the TV for this to be an issue for most people.- The image is ultra-sharp. I don't know what all of the fuss about 4K is about because even at 65\", 1080p just looks SO GOOD!Other aspects:- The TV itself is very good looking and practical. The best feature is a continuous sheet of glass on the front of the TV. This means you can actually CLEAN the screen without worry. (I have kids and some bad experience with stuff somehow getting on the screen)- The TV is heavy. No doubt due to the glass front and metal trim, but it's not super easy to move around and you definitely want a very sturdy wall mount if that's the way you go.- You will either love or hate the silver stand. I think it looks cool, but it is very inconvenient for placing a center channel speaker in front of the stand (you can't).- The SONY internet connectivity seems like a waste of time. Doesn't everyone have a Roku or Apple TV these days? The SONY is not the best interface for this.Bottom line:The TV met all of my main expectations - A high quality, judder free image that looks just as good off as it does on. It was probably too expensive, but I'm 100% satisfied with the picture quality and I don't have to worry about burn in.", "Date": "November 28, 2012"}, {"Title": "Great TV worth every penny", "Author": "Robert Matera", "ReviewID": "R1BGBPOTD7C87K", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I purchased this TV from my local Sony dealer, they did the set up.

I used the AVS forums settings and the TV had the deepest blacks I have ever seen in an LCD and no loss of shadow detail.  No motion artifacts, no dead pixels, no blooming, no banding.  Set #2 was destroyed in the truck on the way to me. Set #3 was pretty bad.  It had blooming very bad, motion artifacts (sports were unwatchable), bad color, it was blurry on all content, had banding, horrible off-angle viewing, and a green line down the middle of it...could have been the 18 inch drop the delivery guy did on it.  Yep, I said guy in the singular.  There was no two-man delivery for me at any time.  The 4th set was the charm.  The delivery guy actually encouraged me to assemble the stand (he had heard about my plight in the shop as Amazon replaced two sets due to their issues).  It is every bit as good as the first one. There are also pro reviews now, with decent settings out there (waiting on my DVE and WOW discs).  Honestly, I am so happy with the settings now that I likely will just leave it be!  There is no banding, no blooming, no dead or stuck pixels, and the off-angle viewing is pretty darn good.The picture is so crisp and vivid and all HD content.  I still can't get over the blacks and shadow detail!  The lack of motion blurring (nearly non existent) makes watching sports a joy on this unit!  3D performance is outstanding.

Frost", "ReviewID": "R2YHLL6IT560WI", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "After I had my last, way to expensive TV crap out on me (Samsung 9000), I decided to replace it with another, way too expensive TV.  Why? Well I really like the look of LCD over plasma and to get LCD looking nearly as good, you need to get a high end LED/LCD. Preferably with local dimming LEDs.  So, the XBR 950 made a lot of sense. Samsung has stopped making local-dimming LED/LCD for a while and Sony has picked up the torch. Until the next gen OLEDs come out, I think LED with local dimming is still the LCD champ in terms of technology. And I feel that LCD produces a more crisp picture that I have come to like over plasma.As a replacement for the Samsung 9000, this TV has proven to be more than adequate. Its better than the 4 year old Samsung in nearly every way. Black level and overall color and pop is much better. Feature wise, it has more refined levels of back-light control and 2 different levels of local dimming (Low and Standard). The Low setting helps reduced the perception of \"the halo effect\" when watching in low light rooms but still provides enough extra black level to make the black bars disappear.I have not calibrated the TV yet but from my basic blue-filter checks, the color levels/hue is spot on. Overall I am seeing a slight too much green but I will be able to tune that out using the white balance settings and a color meter. Most TVs seem to push one color or another. The Samsung had the classic \"red push\" and that too was corrected with a bit of calibration.So, this TV excels in black level. Dark scene detail is also nearly as good or better than the best plasma TVs. The high-end pop is way more than you will ever need even in a bright room. For example the back light has 10 levels and I never put it above 3 or 4 even in daytime viewing.With the staggering number of settings and a manual that explains NONE OF THEM well, it does take a bit of work to get the TV looking the way you like it. I turn off nearly every picture enhancing feature but for low quality video or internet video there are a few that are surprisingly useful. Though you should leave these off with any good/HD source (Blu Ray, HDTV, games, etc) these can be turned on to some nice effect hen viewing old TV on Netflix or YouTube quality video:Contrast EnhancerBlack CorrectionEven the mostly annoying \"Reality Creation\" can be almost useful with some really poor video sources.  Note that ALL of these should be set \"Off\" for Blu Ray or Video Game content that needs none of these fancy image thrashing techniques. I found other settings like MPEG/Dot noise correction pretty much useless all the time.Overall, the TV will produce an amazing image given the right settings and good sources. It will deliver these images better than nearly every other LCD on the market today. So, why the 4 stars? Well, this was due to an slight DSE (dirty screen effect) on the TV that I received (see below). When compared with other, less expensive, TVs it may deserve the best score but I think Sony can and should do much better with its flagship TV in terms of LCD uniformity.  Even though the unit I received only had a slight uniformity issue, many other 950 owners have reported similar clouding, light bleeding, DSE, issues as well.I am giving this 4/5 stars even though the TV is on of the top LCD TVs on the market simply because its also one of the most expensive and I feel that there are some quality issues here. I did consider getting a replacement but after reading threads over at AVS, I realized that my minor DSE issues were not that bad and it would be just as likely to get a replacement with even worse issues, like dead pixels.  So, after going over the TV closely and not seeing any dead/stuck pixels (looking at full field read/green/blue and white). I decided the TV still looked pretty great most of the time and the minor DSE was only perceptible during some bright sky scenes and only if you were looking for it. But nearly all other times, the TV looked brilliant. Still, if you are charging a premium for a top-of-the-line TV, the panel uniformity should be unquestionably very good and that is simply not the case here.", "Date": "April 7, 2013"}, {"Title": "Expensive, but a really great TV", "Author": "KS CT", "ReviewID": "R15UP7Q5NS63I", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "We received our XBR55HX950 about 2 weeks ago.

My opinion is that the HX950 beats out the new 4K sony. the picture is excellent in a bright room. (my living room) and even better at night. The TV has many settings as for you to dial in the perfect picture. It can almost be mind-numbing. You could sit there for days tying to get it perfect. If you need help (such as myself) there are a few AV forums online with great, smart TV guys with this same set that have EXCELLENT settings posted, so it will take the guesswork out of your hands. If i had any CONS about the TV, obviously it would be the price. However, now the price has gone down a little, which makes the TV a little easier to manage. Not to mention, you get what you pay for. you want cheap, you get sub par performance. not too happy that the remote it comes with doesn't have bluetooth to control a PS3, but for an additional 14.99, that problem is fixed. (the PS3 remote will also control the TV and all its settings) the speakers are a little quiet and volume needs to be turned up a little louder than normal. but if you have a sound bar, or listen through a home theater, this shouldn't be a problem. Defiantly not a deal breaker. (I guess this is why on the new 4K's they have the speakers on the front side of the TV and not the back or the bottom.

(compare Panasonic GT50)", "Author": "Patrick Niemeyer", "ReviewID": "R2MP0K5DG8Q4OU", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "Having been very happy for six years with my 46\" Sony Bravia KDL46S2000 I ordered a new 65\" XBR-HX950.  I didn't have any particular expectations or requirements other than bigger and presumably better. So I was really surprised that my experience so far has been kind of negative. In many ways I feel that this TV is worse than the one it is replacing.It is big and occasionally produces a beautiful picture... But overall what I notice most are flaws and a very inconsistent experience.I have a mix of issues, some of which are personal taste... But let me put them in order of annoyance:1) I can't get a decent picture setup that looks good for normal TV viewing, especially news and broadcast stuff. I'm not looking for perfection, just something reasonable. I've spent several hours going through settings and experimenting and my settings seem to line up with what I've read on this forum. What I've found is that they'll look great for one particular scene and then the next will be horribly off. e.g. watching the election coverage was bouncing between people who look pinkish/blue and overly \"vivid\" to crazy orange pancake flat. With a middle of the road setting the Daily Show looks like it was filmed under a heat lamp... Everything is glowing orange. Even within a single broadcast between scenes there will be jarring color discontinuities. I thought the set must be automatically switching modes or something... but it's not. There's something wrong with the color management that is amplifying differences in white balance in a very weird way that is just horrible... The \"cinema\" setting seems to reduce this effect and dulls the weird color issue a bit, but also dulls the images... They are soft and lack contrast and saturation... with seemingly no way to recover it.I'm open to the possibility that there is some magic setting that will fix all of this... but I'm skeptical.2) Viewing angle washout is bad. I guess I'm just used to high quality laptop displays now but I thought viewing angle problems were a thing of the past. Walking over 45 degrees washes out the image and just makes me sad. I never noticed this on my older Bravia... How could the phenomenon have gotten worse on a six year newer TV?3) Highly reflective glossy screen - I can see every light in my room when the scene is dark... I was so spoiled by the matte screen on the old Bravia that this is even harder to accept.4) Build quality / ripples in glass - If you have a 65\" sheet of glass that acts like a mirror any deviation from flatness is very noticeable... Where the glass meets the body near the top I see small but noticeable ripples / bulges... The top edge of the glass deforms a bit where it's mated to the body and so all of your room light reflections are a little distorted near the top... It's not an issue when the TV is on, but I notice it every time I walk by the giant black mirror in my living room...5) The stand is the ugliest thing I've ever seen... If I keep the TV I'll probably have to cover it or spray paint it black... It's just a large silver ring shaped distraction near the TV.6) There is an option to turn off the glowing Sony logo on the front panel, but not the red, yellow, and green xmas tree power and status lights... Why do I need a light to tell me that my TV is on or off? I guess I could cover them somehow.Ok... So as far as good points -1) As I said it *occasionally* produces a really nice picture...2) The DLNA server is useful... I can send photos from my iPhone to the TV. It's slower than AirPlay but works reasonably well......UPDATED 11/28/2012One more minor annoyance:7) It takes a while for the logic of the set to \"boot up\" after you turn it on.  This wouldn't matter so much for advanced features except that it affects basic *volume control* or at least the on screen feedback for the volume control.  I flip the TV on and start hitting volume down (e.g. late a night don't want to wake up the kids) and nothing appears on the screen... then suddenly the bar shows and catches up...  I think it's just the on-screen indication and not the actual volume, but either way it's a little annoying for a core feature that you really expect to be \"instant-on\".Overall I just feel the TV is of poor quality or way overpriced or both.After going back and forth on it for a while I am returning the set and ordering a Panasonic GT50. I really would have preferred the LED vs. a plasma, but it's half the price, seems to have a better picture quality, and hopefully doesn't have as many quirks.Amazon return process comments -I must say that Amazon was awesome in dealing with the return.  I was dreading the call, expecting to get some pressure or \"support\" or at least a hefty fee for the return.  (With the premium delivery you don't keep the box, etc. so I have nothing but the TV).  But they just told me they were sorry I wasn't happy with it and agreed to pick it up with no fee.  I was pleased enough that I felt comfortable ordering the replacement through Amazon and (after calling them back) they are going to coordinate the delivery and pickup of the old one.UPDATED 12/03/2012I got the Panasonic GT50 65\" Plasma today.  My first impressions and comparison are as follows:0) Color and contrast are 10x better out of the box.1) The GT50 plasma is not nearly as sharp as the LED.  But this is only really noticeable when viewing CGI content or graphics.2) The GT50 is about *half the thickness* of the Sony. Ok, maybe 1.25\" vs 2\" but still.. it's quite noticeable.3) Plasmas make a little buzzing sound and produce a little heat.  So far these aren't an issue for me.4) The GT50 has no way to produce analog audio out (only digital).  It looks like it has analog, but it does not.  So if you have an audio system that takes a 3.5mm standard audio input you cannot use it with the TV without some kind of converter.The only real hit is #1, the sharpness on CGI content.  It's not even close... I guess LED has the edge here.  However the color and contrast are so much better that I'm going to stick with it.  Also being half the price of the Sony helps.", "Date": "November 7, 2012"}, {"Title": "Sony XBR-HX950 Review", "Author": "Curtis Bard \"c.bard\"", "ReviewID": "R1SOFK55I2CZFS", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Sony XBR-HX950We are awaiting Amazon delivery on the Sony XBR55HX950 55-inch 240HZ 1080p 3D Internet Full-Array LED HDTV. This is a rather new model that we believe was released in late August or early September 2012. I assume that is why it is stated that it will take so long to process & receive this order (5 to 7 weeks). (Note: This delivery time has changed since I posted this pre-review. The delivery time is now listed as 3 to 4 weeks. - Changed again to 1 1/2 to 2 weeks)This item (as well as the HX929) has received very good reviews from a number of sources, mostly because of the X-Reality PRO engine and the LED dimming / full array capability which is (supposedly) able to provide fantastic contrast, and an even better picture than the excellent older SONY model TVs that will even rival the deep dark blacks of the plasma HDTVs, have brighter colors than plasmas, and have no burn-in and image retention issues that the plasmas still have. SONY has slipped a little in the Consumer Report ratings, but this HX900 line should bring them back up, - if it performs as expected.We will be using this 3D HDTV in conjunction with our Onkyo (wired) 7.1 sound system, which we would rate highly and which we really enjoy.We are replacing a 5 year old SONY KDLXBR52BR4 52\" LCD Bravia that cost about as much ($3,000) as this one does. (We felt from before we purchased it, and during the whole time we had it, that the non-HD channels looked the best on the SONYs, so when you go out to view the HDTVs in the showroom, be sure to ask the clerk to switch the ones you like and are considering buying, to a SD (Standard Definition - non-HD) channel to see how that looks.)We used it (the older 52\" SONY Bravia) in conjunction with a SONY Playstation 3. We loved it (The 52\" Bravia) and it had a fantastic picture, before the screen crapped out after about 5 years; which was part of the now infamous batch of bad screens that came from a manufacturer that supplies the panels to many HDTV brands. There is a class-action suit concerning the defective screens, and we are registered for that, but we're not sure what will come of it, if anything. We are all assuming that the defective screen issue from several years ago has now been successfully rectified.We understand SONY (and all or most other major brands) have outsourced their customer support, as several people have discussed in various reviews, and it apparently leaves much to be desired, so we have also purchased a SquareTrade warranty for 5 years, which includes in-home diagnosis & repair. Along with Amazon's excellent customer service and return policy, we hope we will not have to deal directly with SONY support or service to any great extent.We also purchased 2 pair of the SONY USB rechargeable 3D glasses, and 2 pair of the SONY USB rechargeable Playstation 3 3D glasses, as well as 2 Mediabridge Ultra HDMI cables, and we are considering a recommended Monster surge protector, so we will also try to review those items after we receive and use them. We have since ordered the premium USB rechargeable Sony TDGBR750 Titanium 3D Active Glasses which are more expensive than the others ($71.35), but supposed to be better. We will try to test them too and compare all three types of 3D glasses.We have also recently ordered the 2012 Disney WOW calibration DVD disc.We will update this review after we receive the 55\" XBR55HX950 and check everything out.P.S.: I recently found this list of Blu-ray 3D DVDs:www dot blu-ray dot com/3d/And, of course, doing a search for Blu-ray 3D on Amazon will turn up some very good all-time 3D favorites, such as: Avatar, Avenger, Hugo, Tron, Transformers, Prometheus, Spiderman, Thor, Captain America, and more. Because almost all of the best HDTVs are now coming out with 3D capability, we can be reasonably sure to see some fantastic 3D movies being made in the near future, as well.--------UPDATE:We received the Sony 55\" XBR55HX950 today (October 25th 2012). The delivery people were very friendly and provided a courtesy call when they were near delivery, carried the unit in, and un-boxed the HDTV in our family room for us. They recommended (as does Amazon) that we keep the Sony box, so we did.I believe when Amazon had their white-glove delivery they would assemble the stand & attach it to the TV, and set the TV up for you. They don't do that anymore, but they do unpack it, plug it in, put the batteries in the remote control, and bring up the initial screen to show the TV can successfully power on. (But they don't plug in your HDMI cables, or show you an actual HD picture, etc.).They then allowed us to inspect it closely to look for any screen creases, screen lines, screen cracks, dead pixels, case scratches, cracks, or dents, or other imperfections. We found none. They commented that they have only had a few that they had to take back because of defects found on arrival at the destination. They commented that Walmart ordered TVs seem to have more problems and severely damaged boxes! If you do see any shipping damage or manufacturer defects upon delivery, don't initial the invoice as that is verifying that you have received it in perfect condition! Instead, call the proper number they provide immediately to report it and arrange a timely replacement (1-866-423-5355).We assembled the stand and attached it to the TV and lifted all 70 some pounds up onto out TV table. We had to adjust the tilt until the TV was straight.The criticism of the shinny chrome stand is a valid issue, albeit a peripheral one. It has an angle that highly reflects room lights. It should be a non-relective surface, preferably matt black in color. We placed a black felt piece over the reflective stand. We may put an elegant black velvet cloth around it, or possibly paint it matt black sometime in the future.When a picture is on the screen, screen reflection isn't much of an issue, unless you have really bright lights or unshielded windows opposite the screen. If there are lights on in the room you notice reflections more when the scene or TV has a black/blank screen.After we hooked up the HDMI cables and finished the very easy setup screens (Wi-Fi connected flawlessly), and accessed the HD channels, we agreed with \"Nuke\" when he says in his review that his new Sony 55\" HDTV didn't compare with his older 52\" Sony. But after trying the settings found here and on the AVS Forum, we felt that this HX950 is about as good as our older 52\" BR4.We did experience some differences though that are a little hard to explain. We seemed to see more noticeable differences in the different channels and resolutions. I.e.: when Two and One-half Men was on with our best settings it looked rather dark with high contrast. But when a commercial or other programming came on that same channel, we saw a big difference (lighter and brighter). It appears that this TV is changing according to the change in resolution that occurs, and yet this doesn't happen all the time or on every channel, and usually looks great. Our 5 year old 52\" Bravia was somewhat more consistent in this sense of changeability between channels and resolutions. This odd and unexpected phenomena would probably be worth a deduction of 1 star, had it not been for the new and superb blacks that this TV has that closely rivals Plasma TV blacks, (as some others have already said in various reviews).We also notice that the 720p and other low resolution content looks worse than it did on our 5 year old 52\" Bravia BR4, but the 1080i or 1080p looks better!We might be able to do a little better with more tweaking of the settings and a calibration with the Disney WOW disc we have ordered.We still have to check out all the 3D aspects. So we will do that and update this review later. As you might expect, the 3D conversion of content that was not originally created as 3D is far inferior to any 3D movie that was filmed in 3D. We have now tested all three types of glasses on the 2D simulated as 3D content and found it equally unsatisfactory.UPDATE: We've tried the 3 different types of 3D glasses and they seem to be pretty much the same to us in terms of viewing quality. But two of them are a little heavier (but have side shields that keep ambient light out), and one of them (the more expensive model) is very light-weight and considerably more comfortable, but also more fragile in the hands of young viewers.We are now calibrating with the Disney WOW! disc...UPDATE: We did not find the Disney disc to be a lot of help in calibrating our HDTV. The settings found in these reviews and on the AVS forum probably helped more.IMPORTANT AUDIO SYNC UPDATE:We had an issue that someone else mentioned about the audio and video not syncing up, and displaying a noticeable difference of the video (movement of the lips) and the audio counterpart. This happens usually when you hook up video via HTMI and audio via an optical cable, but can be corrected if your home theater audio receiver has a setting for something called \"audio sync\", audio delay\", or \"lip sync\". Ours is an Onkyo and did have a setting, so we were able to take care of that problem.(Audio sync problem links were deleted. You can do a search and look for those issues described on the \"cnet forums\" under \"audio delay problems\", and on \"hometheater about\" under \"avsynchtips\". I've purchased many products on Amazon, and IMHO Amazon reviews would be much more useful and be considerably more popular (like Facebook) if they allowed out-going links to other sources of information on the product reviews. It's the new \"global\" or \"wholistic\" way to do things - \"Everything's connected\", so why fight it?

I figured since I never owned any HD TV before (Sony XBR being my first) then I'd get the best. Of course, those under a budget shouldn't use this review as good place to help them decide.Anyways I enjoy playing my Xbox 360 on it and I have noticed that it glitches at times. Basically, when switching inputs it doesn't or lags really bad even if I turn it off and back on it will do the same thing at times. I don't know why it does that (I have the most recent updated from Sony too).Since I live in a small one bedroom apartment I believe my Sony TV stands out because it takes up half my wall (lol).

But...", "Author": "Sean", "ReviewID": "R14KHWGPETVLV3", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "To start, I have been a Sony XBR series fan since I first purchased a 40\" XBR 6 in early 2009. After that, I stepped up to a 52\" XBR 9 that I got just before Super Bowl Sunday in 2010. I wanted to make the jump to this model earlier, but didn't want to drop the 5k asking price when it first hit the streets. A few things stand out about this television. I won't mention sound quality, because most who purchase a TV like this have a surround system to hook it up to. While the built in Apps might be clumsy, it can be solved with a simple addition of a Roku box or Apple TV. My review is based solely on picture quality. A matter which has an incredible upside, and a down side I cannot overlook.First: The picture quality on this TV is the best I have seen on an LED backlit LCD television. The Full Array backlight with Local Dimming simply does amazing things for picture quality. You get a truly inky black in areas of the screen that need it, while other portions stay bright when they need t be bright. Scenes from 'The Hobbit' look fantastic with the amount of detail that is created by the local dimming. The contrast on this TV is not in question, by any means. I have owned the Samsung UN65F8000 as well and can say, in my humble opinion, that the picture quality generated from this TV is MUCH better.However, I have experienced some DSE (Dirty Screen Effect). To simplify that term if you're unfamiliar, it's much like driving on a road lined with trees and beautiful colors, but your windshield is dirty so it disrupts what you're actually seeing. I am a big sports fan. I watch Hockey and Football mostly. The issue with the TV is that there are a few vertical lines of \"Shadow\" that can be seen when viewing brighter content. This shows itself the most when watching a hockey game. While the Motionflow does a great job at generating a smooth picture during a fast paced hockey game, I can't help but notice the vertical bands of shadow.I've contacted Sony and they informed me that it is an issue with the panel itself and have offered to replace it. While they can't assure me that I will get the exact same TV, past experience with replacing my XBR9 gives me hope that it will be the same model. I simply hope that if I do decide to replace this one with the same model, that the new one won't have any issues and I can watch whatever I feel like without worrying about the silly line on the right side of the screen.I will also say, that I am more sensitive to this DSE effect because my job is picture quality. I am a photographer and videographer, so I spend a good amount of time deciphering between a great image and a good image.This would have been a hand down 5 star review had it not been for the appearance of having a dirty windshield. If I decide to swap this TV with the same one and get better results I will update this review.", "Date": "January 9, 2014"}, {"Title": "Terrible TV, very disappointed.

What is banding you ask? I did not know what it as either until I purchased this Sony TV. Banding is a problem with the screen where large bands that run from top to bottom appear darker than the rest of the screen. This TV came with two bands about 2 and 3 inches wide on the right side of the screen. They are very visible when the picture is clear such as a blue sky or white background image. It is less obvious with complex picture scenes, but once you see it these bands are hard to ignore.

Even after extensive tweaking, the picture quality, primarily resolution, is quite not up to par with the older set. Same media, input devices, cables, etc. were utilized.Follow-up. Amazon is great! Following the above review many folks chimed in and recommended some picture quality adjustments. Hence forth the review gets bumped from two stars to four. I now judge the picture quality to be on a par, or nearly so, with the set it replaced (mentioned above). Still, cannot give it a full five stars, again based on comparison with the previous. For one, it does not have the viewing angle. The remote is a good deal less robust and non backlit. Additionally the stand is not all that sturdy, but does rotate (helps offset the viewing angle limitation)However, why cannot Sony pre-configure the sets out of the box to have a quality picture? We didn't have to tweak the KDL-52XBR5.Update - My rating is now an unqualified five stars. It turns out the original concerns regarding picture quality were based on input from an Oppo DVD player. For some reason, yet to be determined, this premium player does not perform as well with the new set. HD streaming is nothing short of excellent, and black levels are something to behold.

REVISED ON 12/12/12 . . .", "Author": "joeb", "ReviewID": "R3CTBYIKD391A6", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Can't comment much at this time but after reading the above XBR 65 reviews, I thought I would add my $0.02 worth since I'm seriously considering this new Sony 65\" as a replacement for my KBR 55 NX model which is going in the bedroom.For Black Friday I thought I would go by the local Sony Store in the Galleria mall and see the XBR 65  (price = $5K, the same as Amazon).At the Sony Store they had the 65\" showing in all its Blu Ray glory.  Besides the screen size the main difference between this model and my year-old KBR 55 is the full array backlight feature which is pretty impressive. It is a noticeable improvement over the zone array LED system in my KBR model. While I didn't play with the adjustments I must admit that the picture quality of this unit is the best I've seen.  In a word, \"Outstanding.\"While I use an external sound system be aware that this model does now comes with a subwoofer.  This makes the set a bit thicker that its predecesor.  But you probably still want to spend some bucks on an external audio system for a TV this price.So I cannot really comment on the workings of this model yet.But I can say this: THE STAND IS OUTRAGEOUSLY UGLY.  Let me say that again, UG-UG-YOUGLY!.What were Sony engineers thinking about!  My KBR 55 model has a nice flat stand in gloss glass black so as to match the monolith-type screen.  This stupid semi-circular stand is silver and contradicts the beautiful monolithic lines of the TV. (I think my KRB is prettier off than on.) Many other reviews give the silver stand a big negative too.  Some reviews say that the silver stand might be painted or covered in black electrical tape.  All of these remedies are not going to work.  They will look like crap.My wife says the stand is a DEAL-BREAKER.  I'm sure the Sony designers were out on the town the night before they designed this FLAW.  That's the only explanation for ruining a GREAT thing!!! Or maybe they thought that all purchasers would mount the set on the wall in which case the stand in a moot point.I will try to talk to the war department, but I do not think I will prevail. Wish me luck.REVISED RATING FOR SONY XBR 65\":My above review has garnered so much hate mail from the Amazon cyber death squad that I am revising my original one-star rating to five stars.  As the above review explains this new Sony product is absolutely outstanding from a picture quality standpoint (and relative to my Sony KDL 800 55\" model).  As my above review also explains, the garish silver stand is totally unattractive--something that didn't need to happen. I'll admit that this mistake floored me and resulted in a somewhat knee-jerk reaction and a one-star rating.Some reviews suggested that my review should only consider picture quality and that my review added nothing to readers' opinions about this product. I do not agree.  There are other facets of this product that (others) might find useful. Knowledge about this flaw might receive some weight by others.  But I surely did not intend to mis-lead readers with my review. I only intended to bring attention to a design flaw that could have been easily avoided.Incidentally, I tried to use the flat black glass  stand on my 55\" KDL model in place of the silver stand on the 65\". Unfortunately it does not fit.Let's do it this way: Five stars for the TV; one star for the stand. I trust that will be an acceptable compromise.Postscript: I just purchased the 65\" XBR Sony after weighing the pluses and minus and after -- following another reviewer's advice -- placing a black velvet \"sock\" over and around the silver stand.  While I've not had a chance to fine-tune things at this time, I can say that the picture quality of this XBR 65\" is far superior to my 55\" KDL model. The full array LED back light feature results in blacker blacks than the zone array LED feature on the 55\".The large volume of responses to my original review suggests that Sony has a real winner in the large flat screen market. If you are in the market for a 65\" flat screen I don't believe you can do better than this Sony (just get some black velvet cloth if you are not going to wall mount the thing).Merry Christmas!", "Date": "November 25, 2012"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "$5,499.99", "Features": "TV without stand (Width x Height x Depth): 59.375-Inch x 35.5-Inch x 2.125-Inch, TV with stand (Width x Height x Depth): 59.375-Inch x 38-Inch x 14.75-Inch\nPro-grade detail for discerning eyes: X-Reality PRO\nFull-array local dimming for our best color/contrast\nExperience precise motion clarity with Motion flow XR 960\nFrameless design with Corning s Gorilla Glass\n3D in Full HD 1080p for phenomenal 3D picture quality\nConnect to the TV via Wi-Fi without using a router\nMake life-sized video calls with Skype\nMedia Remote app to control your TV with a smartphone\nMovies, music and apps with Sony Entertainment Network\nPC and tablet content on your TV with Intelligent Connect\nStream HD entertainment wirelessly with built-in Wi-Fi", "Name": "Sony XBR65HX950 65-inch 240HZ 1080p 3D Internet Full-Array LED HDTV (Black) (Old Version)", "ImgURL": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41VMucEyyoL._SX300_.jpg", "ProductID": "B008XG1MEG"}}
