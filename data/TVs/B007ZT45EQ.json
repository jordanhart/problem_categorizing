I tried to see if there are more reviews other than the existing 7 reviews in Amazon.  I called on Dec. 16 (Sunday) afternoon at 4pm to see if Haier has any customer service representative working, and to my surprise there was a person answering the phone.  I asked if there is any authorized Haier service center in San Francisco and the answer was yes.  Therefore, I decided to give this TV a try and order it from Amazon.  I received the TV today with enhanced home delivery (EHD).  EHD means the delivery person will deliver the item inside your home and take the TV out for visual inspection and turning it on to ensure the unit is working properly before leaving.  I immediately checked the TV by connecting it to a DVD player to ensure the HDMI ports worked.  I also scanned the TV channels to ensure the tuner work.  The TV work beautifully: the color is brilliant and the sound is good.  I own two other TVs:  a 40\" Sony LCD and a 42\" Panasonic LED.  So far, I am glad that I make this purchase.", "Date": "December 20, 2012"}, {"Title": "Great TV for price, plan for surround sound system", "Author": "Plantain", "ReviewID": "R1BTYPACOGVGKJ", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I just got this TV yesterday and for the price I think it gives you alot of bang for your buck.

I am happy with the Picture (1080p, 120 refresh rate, LED).  My son has found that the tv picture quality degrades when very fast motion appears on the set.  This causes some blurring...which was specifically mentioned as not being a problem for this TV.This TV has 3 HDMI inputs which is adequate.  There is not a digital sound output as available from other brands.The biggest knock on this TV is the terrible sound quality from the internal speakers.  I am able to use my digital audio output from my Directv box directly to my surround sound system, as well as our PS3 that we use for BluRay movies (and gaming), but there are times that I would not normally run the surround sound with my previous rear projection TV, and now I have to use the surround sound for everything.", "Date": "December 7, 2012"}, {"Title": "Very fast shipping and good graph quality!", "Author": "congshu wang", "ReviewID": "R26KHQ46KAZJCF", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Super fast shipping with good quality.

The lighting and sound. I found the tv has sufficient sound levels(I have yet to turn it above 40, which is loud and barely over half way up) and the lighting effect is only truly noticeable if you actually looking for it. My though is that those people who felt these were major issues most likely had defective models. Which can happen with any electronic device.

Need a sound bar/surround sound though!", "Author": "Brandy", "ReviewID": "R3KY5DCJ9M18R", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I paid under $570 for this tv on sale. Received it quickly, and it was easy to set up. The picture is amazing. The remote has new batteries in it, and it doesn't have a very far range. You have to be closer than 8 feet to the tv for the remote to work. Not a great feature if you have a big space. Don't know if it is just me or not. But you can program your DISH remote to work the TV, so not a big deal. The only downfall on the TV is the sound as others have said. I wasn't sure what people meant about it having horrible sound. But, I bought it since it was such a good deal. As soon as I took it out of the box I noticed that the speaker is only a circle about the size of a dessert plate on the back of the tv. The tv does get very loud. So it isn't that it is too quiet, it's just the quality of the sound. It is muffled and sounds like to are listening to an old radio or something. BUT...it's an easy fix. I bought a sound bar also on sale for $36 shipped. It was normally $110, and bought it on Amazon cheaper than Walmart had it. I attatched the sound bar bracket to the wall mount and then plugged the sound bar into the tv. Amazing. So, even though I had to spend an extra $36 for the tv to be perfect, I have no problem with it...it was still an awesome price for an awesome TV. I am not picky about having high def sound or surround sound...but I would definately reccomend if you buy this tv, to just buy the sound bar with it so you have it right away and don't have to wait for it and listen to the bad sound for a few days before getting it. You will kick yourself if you don't.

On a black screen the black levels are SO uneven you can actually see in the center of the screen a rounded black spot that is about a foot and a half in diameter, this is the only part of the screen that has \"even\" black levels. The edges are very uneven, and the corners are very bright, you can definitely tell there are ripples of light in circles starting at the center even dark spot, and making its way up to the corners. On a white screen you can see the center is obviously the darkest and it causes what your watching to appear brightest on the sides and have a center dark line like a quarter of the width of the panel going down the entire center. It's like the tv was laid sideways for a long period of time, or was just manufactured wrong because you can definitely tell the panel itself is pulled backwards causing the light to be very uneven across the panel from the led's on the edge. You can tell the panel is actually quality though, it has pretty accurate color reproduction after messing around with the settings for a while trying to fix the black level.

While it states it's a 1080p tv, it's default resolution is that of 720p. Try to set it higher? You can, but you will have a blurry picture quality.The worst:-Warranty. I have a failed HDMI port, and the other is slowly failing, not wanting to recognize any input. Called Haier, and after 30 minutes, the rep told me they would ship me out a new tv. Called back a week later, and the new rep said they would not ship me out a new tv, and that I would be forced to take it into a service center that is 50 miles away, and have to get it repaired. They would not ship me the parts to do myself (needs a new main board), and would not budge at all. So not only was I originally lied to, they want me to drive a good 100 miles round trip multiple times to get the tv worked on.Good luck with Haier, but I will never purchase a product from them again.", "Date": "June 11, 2013"}, {"Title": "No audio outputs!", "Author": "chris", "ReviewID": "R15VXS6CZLHTNH", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "It says it has audio outputs, but it does not, infuriating!

I hadn't heard of Haier before, but the reviews were good except for the sound and I'm using external speakers so I never use the internal speakers anyway.  The TV arrived on time, as usual with Amazon.  This was January 7.  I set up the TV that night and it looked great and worked..... for about four minutes.  As I was cleaning up the packaging the screen went completely blank.  I waited in case the broadcast was messed up, no such luck.  I checked other inputs, no good.  The TV's own menu wouldn't even come up.  The only thing I could do is turn it off and on.So I called Haier and they said that a repair place would be calling me in two days, but if they don't that I should call the repair place.  After three days I hadn't been called by the repair place.  I had lost their name and number so I called Haier to get it.  I called the repair place and got voicemail and left a message.  This was on a Saturday.  On Monday the repair place called me and told me that they can't repair my TV because their field guy was out with an injury.  He also tells me that he called Haier and told them that he couldn't do it.  I call Haier and they confirm that that repair place couldn't do it and that another place had rejected a request to do it.  Haier tells me it will be another three to five days before they get back to me with a repair date.  None of these places ever called me.  The only time throughout this whole ordeal that I got any information was when I called them.  It has now been a week since I initially called Haier.  After three days I called them back and was told that my case had been given to another group that decides whether or not the TV will just be replaced and that they will also need three to five days.  After this I just called Amazon and they were the complete opposite of Haier.  On the first call they offered to either replace the TV or let me return it for a full refund with no shipping cost to send it back.  I took the refund and was told that it may be four or five days until the shipping company calls me to schedule a pickup.  The next day the shipping company called and the next day after that the TV was picked up.Today, on January 23, two weeks and a day after my initial call, Haier called me for the first time.  He told me that he was still trying to find a repair place to do the work.  I told him I had already returned the TV but was curious how long they would keep looking for a repair place before replacing the TV.  He said they would have given it to the end of this week.  That's just shy of three weeks before they DECIDE to replace it.  How long until they would actually replace it, who knows.  I won't be buying Haier again and I don't think I'll buy a TV online again, despite Amazon being awesome.  If I bought this in a store I could have a new TV or my money back in an hour.", "Date": "January 23, 2013"}, {"Title": "Amazing tv!", "Author": "james", "ReviewID": "R32YMVOL31H0D5", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Sound quality is a little sub-par, but I have a sound system so it is a non-issue.
