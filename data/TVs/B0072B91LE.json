{"Reviews": [{"Title": "A good but not great set", "Author": "Nerrel", "ReviewID": "RG4NROQIKTQ0Y", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "LG's lower-mid level sets have earned a reputation for having low gaming lag, great color accuracy, and the most extensive picture options of any sets at or even above their price level. The CS560 series still delivers in these regards, but to a lesser extent than past models.The styling and build quality of the set are fairly good overall. My panel is a S-IPS type, though LG may be conducting a panel lottery (randomly shipping VA and IPS panels for the same model) as they have in the past. The buttons are front mounted and touch sensitive, which seems like a nice feature at first but makes operating the set awkward and frustrating in a dark room- don't lose the remote. Another complaint is that the set buzzes audibly unless the backlight is fully set to 100, which can be annoying when using the set quietly at night.The input lag for video gaming keeps with LG's standard for fast processing time. In the stopwatch lag tests I've done (in 1080p) the CS560 matched the response time of the Wii U's gamepad exactly, putting it in the 1-2 frames range.  There is hardly any noticeable increase in lag when upscaling from 480p and I can play timing intensive games and online FPS with no problem. If you're buying a set for use with modern games, there are few if any faster sets available than this.The color accuracy also seems to live up to LG's usual standards, although it's hard to know precisely how well without measuring with a meter. Every color is vivid and deep without appearing over saturated. The black levels are average at best, but the unbelievably bright white levels help to offset them and create contrast during bright scenes. The set is capable of 4:4:4 chroma sub sampling when used as a PC monitor over HDMI, but, as with other reviewers, it required an EDID override in my computer's registry. Regardless of the source used, the overall picture is extremely clear, vivid and detailed.The motion handling is mixed, but at least partly excellent with no visible streaking and only very light blur on moving objects during camera pans. There is, unfortunately, a large problem with juddering from most video sources, notably blu-rays at 24p. Almost any time the camera is panning the scenery and objects on screen will move in a jerky, strobe-like fashion. Past LG sets were able to handle 24p content smoothly, even models at much lower price points, so this obviously comes as a disappointment. If you intend to use the set mainly for watching blu-rays then you may want to buy the 2011 LK450 model instead.The feature set is another startling disappointment. The TV only has 4 inputs- 2 HDMI, 1 RF, 1 analog input, and no VGA or audio outputs whatsoever. To reiterate, there is no audio output, not even optical; once the audio goes into this set, the only way it can come out through the speakers. The analog video input functions as a joint component/composite input, meaning that you can't use both cable types at the same time. Users with more than two sources will find themselves having to use adapters or receivers to handle most of their connections.The HDMI inputs also have occasional problems connecting to sources.  Rarely the set will display \"no signal\" even when a device is connected and powered on, and other times the hue of the image will  shift toward an extreme red or green.  These problems can be solved by changing the input to something else, then changing back, or powering the set off and on again, but it's disappointing that the HDMI inputs have any defects at all considering that they've been given priority over the other input types.Some of the advanced picture options have also been cut, giving the CS560 the most limited menu of any recent LG (though the range of options is still fuller than any competing set).  The more pointless features such as \"eye care\" have been omitted, but some useful calibration tools have also been removed; there is no longer a color filter option, which means that color and tint calibration now require a pair of blue glasses to set. The 10-point IRE calibration has also been removed, leaving only the option for 2-point.  The picture wizard seems to have defective patterns for brightness and contrast, yielding white and black levels that are wildly off target and impossible to match correctly (Update: The Picture Wizard has been fixed through a firmware upgrade and now calibrates correctly).My opinion of the 560 is that it's an excellent looking TV but one that grinds right along the border of \"minimal\" and \"cheap\". The features of the set have been scaled back significantly compared to past models in response to the advance of LED, which seems poised to become the default backlight technology of LG's TV lineup. If you have simple tastes and just want a good looking set for gaming and occasional movie watching, the 560 is a great value and will perform well enough. If you're a more serious film enthusiast with a large blu-ray collection, then you may want to seek out an LK450 or choose a different brand to avoid the judder and limited inputs.", "Date": "March 31, 2012"}, {"Title": "They stripped a lot of features out for 2012 over the same 2011 model", "Author": "finally_cool_in_ks", "ReviewID": "R1BJNK9FCS38VV", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "Review written by K.WatsonThey stripped a lot of features out for 2012 over the same 2011/2010 line/models. The reasons are unclear. I assume to just make more money and fleece their customers even more. They removed so many great features that really made this a great set but they kept the price the same, which I would like to point out is already high compared to other models in the size. There is just no sense or logic in the stripping of these features whatsoever.They removed a HDMI port. Now there are not enough ports to hook up everything you need. Deal breaker for most potential customers right there. With just 2 ports, I've already had to pull out my set away from the wall several times to juggle between consoles, or if I want to watch a bluray movie or if I want to watch cable. It's a hassle. God only knows why LG would remove a very much needed HDMI port from us. Even the guy at Best Buy told us that he does not recommend this set to anyone because it has the least amount of HDMI ports of all their sets. He seemed really shocked. So were we.Movie quality is now worse. They removed 5:5 / 2:2 pull down from movies. Actually, ANY video content you want to display. 480, 720 or 1080. This means there is a huge amount of video judder / jitter present in any movie you watch. Go google \"judder\" it's a bad thing and you don't want it. But, if you buy this set, you will have plenty of it. Judder makes objects on the screen herky jerky when panning left to right, right to left, any panning whatsoever. Up / down, you name it. Objects will skip along the screen. God only knows why LG took this very basic feature out. It basically ruined this set. Even my daughter noticed the judder in her Disney movies and asked if the game needed cleaning. She is still at that age where she doesn't understand fully about bluray or dvd discs and thought that if Daddy and Mommy cleaned her \"game\" the movie would display smoothly. Of course it wasn't a game but a Bluray disc.They took out many many features from the user menu. Gone are many features that could be changed in the 2010 and 2011 version of this set / product line. Basically, at the expense of picture quality. Dozens of features were removed. They absolutely sabotaged this set and mangled what it once was. I know, I own both the LG 32KD450 and LG 32LK450. I apologize if I am being so harsh but LG warrants such a response and I think potential LG customers deserve an in-depth review.The night I returned my set to Best Buy, the sales person looked at me, puzzled I might add and asked me, what is so bad about this set? He went on to say two other people had returned theirs as well over the weekend.What a shame that LG would ruin such a fantastic line of TV sets by removing so many features that made this such a stand out TV against other 32\" sets from other manufactures. Let's just hope that LG discontinues this model next year instead of releasing this kind of garbage upon it's customers. What I really want to ask LG is, why did you not want my money? Why did you remove the HDMI port and all those very important hardware features and menu features that made this such a great TV? Why LG?Update: I had a chance to speak with the sales manager from Nebraska Furniture Mart in my area and he tells me LG purposely crippled, removed these features, both hardware and in the user menu to make it's newer LED based TV's stand out against this set. He tells me that sometimes manufactures will do this to artificially highlight a TV in it's product line as having more features , better value, when the truth is, it never did. This is to drive sells in that area.I can tell you this LG. You customers are both smart and savvy and will see through this gimmick. I would also like to point out that when your customers are treated with respect, they become \"loyal\" customers. Pulling these kind of stunts will only drive business and customers away. I returned my set and I will not be looking at LG as a brand I would consider for anything in the future.", "Date": "March 28, 2012"}, {"Title": "Great TV for the price -- An Honest Review of LG 32\" CS560", "Author": "LivingFit365", "ReviewID": "R1TDZ5VVKR2XTA", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "First and foremost this TV is not for high-end videophiles, audiophiles with highly sensitive, discerning taste, or dedicated, scrutinizing gamers. If you want that type of TV, you'll need to step it up a notch and of course pay more money. This is a medium, entry level 1080P TV with a clear, crisp picture and enough features to satisfy the average TV and occasional movie viewer, mom, pop and the 'family' -- That type of consumer. Maybe, just maybe some higher-end users will enjoy this as a second TV to use when they're not watching blue-ray on the high-end, expensive TV.Some reviewers criticized this TV for not having features of previous models in this price range. Well, I never had those features and don't miss them, nor do I need them. So to a new buyer its most important that you remember if you don't need a certain feature and/or never had it to begin with and don't miss it, it's not a big deal.I consider myself a savvy shopper and critical when it comes to quality of a product. I was looking for a low-priced TV that had some decent picture and sound quality. I just purchased this TV today from a local, big-box store for well under $380 and I'm very pleased with the great picture quality and especially the low price and great value.The other thing I wanted to mention is that don't over-buy in size. Everyone seems to want to buy the biggest TV they can afford. Well let me tell you, that's not always the best thing to do. I bought this TV because it is eventually going into a bedroom. So I opted for the 32\". Right now it is set up in the living room and to be honest, the size is perfect for the living room. I was considering a 40\"-50\" at one time, and that would have been overkill.Also, DO NOT go by the picture quality at the stores no matter how 'great' they try to make it look. It's not a true representation of the TV's picture quality, nor how it will look in 'your' home, in 'your' lighting. It is also very hard to decide on a size when all the other sizes are sitting next to one another. It's very overwhelming a one can get confused trying to figure out which size will be best.My advice is to look at your room and space and try to decide on a TV that is not too overpowering yet not too small where the room dwarfs the TV. Here is an idea ... tape together pieces of poster board the size of the TV and place it in the space intended to get a perspective on size. Actually I think a 32\" is a great size for most medium-sized rooms. Once you decide the size you're looking for, go shopping. You may change your mind a little bit smaller or a little bit bigger, but at least you'll have a base line to start before you go.Okay, so now with all of that being said and out of the way, here is my review.------Pros------Esthetics (design) ---> Modern, clean lines. Thin profile, but not the thinnest and not like the older, thicker models either. This TV has about a 2\" black frame around the screen. It seems these days people are interested in the paper-thin frames, or the frame-less TV's.  Actually, I 'thought' that was going to be my preference, as it is more sleek, minimalist, etc. But actually, when I got this home I really liked the fact it has a wider black frame. It accents nicely against the white walls and gives it sort of a 'picture frame' type of appeal. It makes the T.V. more of a focal point in the room. If you already have one big piece of furniture or artwork that is the main focal point of the room, then maybe a thin-frame or frame-less TV would be better in your situation.  So anyway my advice is, don't go by what is 'trendy' go by what will look good in your particular home and environment. In my home the wider frame looks very nice.There are no buttons on the front of the TV, which is nice. It has flat, flush, touch-sensitive selectors for volume, channel, menu, etc. This keeps the TV looking clean, and uncluttered. Some manufactures hide 'buttons' under the frame or on the side of the frame. The 'clicking' of buttons just seems old-fashioned to me, at least now with iPads and such, and everything going to touch panels. I actually like the touch-sensitive, flat selectors on the 'front' of this TV within clear view of what I am pressing.This TV is very lightweight. Really it is. I carried this with one hand out of the store, and easily lifted this up onto my mantel with no problem. This means if you wish to move it from one room to another it can be done by one person. This was a blessing because I can remember not too long ago the behemoth tube TV's needed 3 people to help carry and install. This TV is truly a do-it-yourself TV. Nice!Assembly---> Easy. Out of the box, all that needed to be done is screw on the base, plug in your video source and power cord and that's it! You're done. Oh and put the 'included' batteries in the remote.Picture and Audio Set Up ---> Simple and intuitive. Using the 'picture wizard' guides you step by step to calibrate the TV and adjust picture settings. There are advanced settings to fine tune the picture even more. The auto-tune feature pulls in all your cable stations into the built-in tuner fast, easy and automatically.Selecting the audio preference is just as easy. Faux surround sound, etc.. Just a few selections and you'll soon be listening to the TV to your liking.Picture Quality ---> Sharp, vivid, clear picture quality for the price. Now compare this to the 50\" plasma the store had on display running Avatar on Blue-ray and this TV pales in comparison. (but so did most of the other TV's on the floor). The bigger TV was 5+ times the price of this one. So you get what you pay for. Watching ABC, CBS, NBC and other cable stations, this TV has an amazing picture that will not disappoint. Blue-ray and DVD are just as fine.Audio Quality ---> Pretty good actually. It has a faux surround mode that does a nice job of dynamically enhancing the sound. There is also a feature to enhance the voices too so they don't get lost in background music and such.  This TV does not have the tinny, AM radio sound you may expect from a low priced TV. Nor does it have the booming sound of a higher-end TV.  This TV has very acceptable and clear, crisp sound for the price. The sound easily fills the room. You won't be disappointed in the sound from built-in speakers.USB connector ---> This is a nice, added feature if friends or family come by and you'd like to watch a home video or pictures on your TV. Just plug in the USB drive and start watching.Remote Control ---> A very basic, simple, easy to use remote. You won't find a bunch of confusing bells and whistles on the remote. No it's not going to make your toast and start your car. Nope, it has just exactly what you need and nothing more.  So, the reason I like that is because I don't have to worry about family or guests trying to figure out how in the heck to turn on or operate the TV with a confusing remote. It spares me the agony of conducting a 'TV 101' classroom session for family and friends. Ugh!----Cons----Not very many cons actually. I mean for under $380 dollars for a 32\" 1080P TV, you're really getting great quality and value. Seriously, technology is advancing so rapidly that in 5 to 10 years most computers and TV's are behind the times and out of date anyway. So, at this price one could easily afford to buy another mid-level TV like this one every 5 years. On the other hand, spending $1,000+ on a TV to try to get a few more bells and whistles might extend the time a bit more until it's out of date, but probably not by much. In 5-10 years you're still stuck with an out-of-date TV.Hookups ---> No VGA connector to hook up to a computer. This is only a slight con, because you can use one of the HDMI connectors if your computer has an HDMI. Most newer computers have HDMI.Some people are complaining this TV only has 2 HDMI connections. This again is only a slight con, because you can buy an HDMI 1080P hub and expand the amount of HDMI connections if you really need more.For my needs, all I really need is one HDMI to hook it up to Apple TV and one for my blue-ray player That's it. The Apple TV pretty much does everything I need. It has digital audio out, so I can hook it up to a surround sound system If I choose (expanding the capability of the TV) And what is not available on NetFlix or my purchases, I can use my Blue-ray player. I can mirror my iPad through Apple TV to have internet on my TV. So, having only 2 HDMI connections is not such a drawback, for my needs anyway.----------Conclusion----------The LG 32\" CS560 is an excellent TV at a very low price. It combines a clear, crisp 1080P picture quality with impressive, built-in sound quality. For well under $380 dollars, you can't go wrong buying this TV. This TV is not going to replace a high-end theater or gaming TV for your theater room, but it will make a good living room, bedroom or family room TV. Who knows, once you buy this TV, you may decide you don't really need to spend extra bucks on a bigger, home theater TV. At such a low price, it allows a person to purchase a newer TV in 5 or 10 years without feeling like you're constantly spending tons of money to always upgrade your TV. You'll be surprised how much quality is packed into a TV at such a low price.---------------------------------If you liked this review, you may enjoy other reviews by me.

While it may be the 32LK450's replacement, it certainly doesn't live up to its predecessor.  The only area of \"improvement\" is that they will all allegedly have IPS screens.  The one I purchased was an S-IPS (I would have chosen A-MVA if I had a choice), the other unit on the shelf had the same AUSY code, and so did the display unit.  The IPS is only an \"improvement\" though if you were playing the panel lottery with the 32LK450 and trying to find an IPS panel instead of the A-MVA panel.  The TV I got has a very minimal amount of backlight bleed on the bottom edge slightly to the right of the center.  It's not very noticeable with the backlight down but if you have it high, it stands out and has been getting worse.  Initially there was no banding on the DVI>HDMI signal from the PC on various test pages but, that has started to show up as well for some reason.  Speaking of tests, do not bother using the \"Picture Wizard\" on the TV as it will crush your black levels and it is impossible to make the which image look like the recommended example unless you increase the brightness and wash out your black levels in the process.  There is something fundamentally wrong with the \"Picture Wizard\" and/or the TV.Several of the options in the TV menu have been removed and are as follows:Picture Mode:APS Photo (this was model Dependant)TruMotion: This was model dependent but it's allegedly in the 32CS560 yet there is is no setting for it in the menu.Screen RBG PC: This is obviously missing as the CS560 series does not have a VGA portAdvanced Settings/Expert Control: Dynamic Colour (this is missing on Expert 1 and Expert 2) Skin Colour Digital Noise Reduction (Noise Reduction is still there) Clear White Eye Care Real Cinema/Film mode (24fps video has to be playing to gain access to this) Colour Gamut (EBU, SMPTE, and BT709 have been removed) xvYCC (I haven't seen this but, that type of signal may not be getting put out) Colour Filter Expert Pattern Color Temperature (is not available on expert and it has been changed to only go from W50 to C50. All methods except 2 point have been removed and 2 point is under the Expert Control on all video modes including Expert 1 and Expert 2. The 10 point IRE settings have been removed)Option Settings: ISM Mode (this was used to remove ghosting from stationary images and it has been removed).In addition to that, the 32CS560 does not process 24fps video content correctly.  There is a judder/jitter/stutter every time the camera pans up, down. left, or right.  You have to have \"Film Mode\" on to make the judder/jitter/stutter not look like a bunch of zig zags but it doesn't stop it from happening.  You need ot reduce your contrast setting to 20 or less to reduce the judder/jitter/stutter and that will seriously degrade your I/PQ (image/picture quality) as it will leave it dim/dingy/dirty/etc. as if there is a film of dirt/fog on your screen.  There is absolutely no way to correct this issue and to make matters worse, you can not use \"Film Mode\" when the 32CS560 is hooked up to your PC.  This issue has been reported by two other owners as well.Speaking of the PC, you are able to have the 32CS560 do 4:4:4 chroma without renaming the input label but, you have to do the EDID override if you are using a Nvidia video card.  When it comes to video games (PC and console), there aren't a lot of complaints as myself and two other owners didn't notice any issues.  When it comes to video though, the TV's flaws are there in full force just like they are with a DVD player.I will be returning this TV for a refund (purchased locally so I didn't have to wait for shipping) as I have absolutely no interest in an exchange as the issues are present with other owners.", "Date": "March 25, 2012"}, {"Title": "Great Picture, But Features are Lacking", "Author": "DMFC", "ReviewID": "R68JVRYKVMN7C", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "This is not a bad TV in most respects.

It's used every day, for basic cable (through a coaxial cable), streaming movies through a Roku with Netflix and for playing Play Station 3 video games.Picture/60Hz:It's beautiful! Movies look awesome, TV looks stunning and video games look dynamic. The 60Hz refresh rate has not been an issue for me at all while playing any games on the PS3. I can't say I notice any visual distortion with any of my games, such as Modern Warfare 3, InFamous 2, Uncharted 3 and Heavy Rain. I'm a pretty avid gamer and I haven't had seen anything with the refresh rate that would make me think that I needed one with a higher rate. Maybe if the TV was lager than 42 inches, but at this size everything looks and works beautifully.Sound:The sound is great. I bought a flat screen 2 years ago that had abysmal sound. The speakers in it are so bad if you turn the volume up at all, it's almost painful to listen to. I've heard better sound come out of AM/FM radios than some of the \"budget\" priced TVs being sold out there now. However, I'm extremely pleased with the sound from this TV. Everything sounds clear and like it should. Nothings muffled or sounding like someone is talking into a tin can.Remote control:Like most TV's these days, it's narrow, tall and complicated. It has tons of options on it for controlling every aspect of the TV. But for the most part, once you have all the settings on the TV just how you want them, you'll be using this mostly for changing channels, volume or switching to HDMI/AV ports. What I do like is they put all the less used menu buttons on one end of the remote, and the most common ones on the other end, by your hand at the bottom. So for the most part, you can reach everything you need for basic TV watching (except for the power button) with your thumb while holding the remote.Size/weight:The 42 inch version of this TV is big and beautiful, but not so heavy it can't be moved around. Once you mount it on the included stand, it can easily be slid around and positioned any way you need it to go, without the need of a second pair of hands on the other side. When it comes to moving it from pace to place, the size itself (being such a wide TV) makes it more difficult than the weight actually does.On-TV buttons:The buttons on the TV are actually sensor buttons inside the frame. They are not above the surface, but inside it. Like that of a device with a touch screen, when you touch the area on the black frame around the TV that indicates where the power sensor is, it will recognize you touched it and power it on. Because all the buttons are like this, the black glossy TV frame looks solid and uninterrupted like a picture frame, looking completely button-less. When actually the buttons are there, but just as sensors inside the frame.Price:Hands down this is the best TV of this size that I've found, that has this beautiful of a picture and great of sound.Conclusion:After two months of daily use and seeing how well everything works, I wouldn't hesitate to buy another one of these at all. I am astounded at what a great TV it is for such a good price. If anything ever changes, I will update this review. But as of now, I really like this TV and would recommend it to anyone.Update 1/19/2013: 8 months after buying this TV I'm still loving it.

We rolled the old \"giant\" out to the curb and began looking through the LG's now available. My husband said if the 720p gave us the fine picture we were enjoying, the 1080p would have to be nothing short of fantastic.

The picture is amazing and Mom is happily working her way through her entire DVD movie collection because she loves the big, clear picture (she says it's like having her own movie theater) and she can now hear and understand dialogue that she's been guessing about for years, thanks to the dialogue enhancement feature. Mom spends between 4-8 hours a day in front of the TV and this has made a huge improvement in the experience for her.We did get off to a rocky start. The first unit shipped had a faulty screen and it had to be exchanged. I didn't deduct a star for that because I know that every manufacturer has one slip through the quality control process from time to time. In all fairness, it did function as advertised for an hour or so before the trouble began. I called LG and they were very helpful. They had a tech out here within 2 days and, when he couldn't fix it, he boxed the unit back up for me so that I could send it back to Amazon. Amazon was great. The return process was painless and I had the new unit the next day. They also scheduled the pick-up for the defective unit. I didn't even have to print a shipping label.So, I think this is an excellent product for a really good price, especially for someone who just wants to watch TV and movies. Set-up was a breeze. The remote is easy to understand and use. I highly recommend this product.", "Date": "June 16, 2012"}, {"Title": "LCD or LED", "Author": "A.

The TV started having problems in early 2012 (approximately 14 months after purchase)with a green band covering the left side of the TV (intermittent but consistent). The bottom line was that Service Net would not repair it because the repair was over $800 and LG would not repair it because I had an extended warranty and they would not repair it under LG extended warranty.Lesson to be learned - ServiceNet is limited warranty and won't cover major repairs to the TV and LG TVs are of such poor quality that they are in essence garbage after the manufacturer's warranty expires. I find it hard to believe that LG does not stand behind its product. In fact we purchased an LG TV before, it had a similar problem and Best Buy stood behind the warranty.So, here's the Catch 22 - LG won't offer extended warranty to repair their TV because I purchased an extended warranty from ServiceNet and ServiceNet won't cover the cost of repair because LG TV's are too expensive to repair.Caveat emptor..... don't buy LG42 TV's....they have a consistent problem with the panel / screen....if you do...the extended warranty through ServiceNet will do you no good if you need something major repaired.", "Date": "June 26, 2012"}, {"Title": "Poor Picture Quality, No Way to Connect to Home Theater, Soundbar", "Author": "Michael", "ReviewID": "R1UHGKCA70US6T", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I have owned this television for approximately four months now, and I am extremely disappointed in nearly every meaningful category.

I understand that the refresh rate is only 60 HZ on this set, but I have seen similar models from other manufacturers do a far better job with the same types of images.But the real kicker is that there is no way to connect the set to any type of external speaker--no digital coaxial, no RCA audio cables out, not even a headphone jack. The very meager speakers that are part of the set are what you're stuck with... do not bother purchasing a soundbar, 2.1, or home theater system. You will have no way to connect it.

It came very well packaged. I set it up on a table top using the stand that comes with the TV. Once set up with the stand, which was fairly easy, it is very sturdy. If you have young children or a pet or there is any possibility it can be knocked over it comes with a screw that allows you to stabilize the TV by attaching it to the desktop with the screw. I had no need for this as it is quite stable without the screw.One suggestion is that if you order this TV also order the component video cables AND the HDMI cable. They are not expensive and are included with the free shipping.I set up the TV with the component video cables first as I had read that this gives the best picture and sound. All I got was snow on screen. I then added a coax cable and this got me a picture. I was then able to get into the menu.This was not a problem with the TV, but with me because I really didn't know how to get into the different modes. I then separately bought an HDMI cable and added that. With the three different cable attachments I was able to compare picture and sound in different modes (using the different cables). I found the HDMI cable gave me the best picture and sound.From there you can play with the different adjustments under whichever mode you chose to use until you personalize the TV to your own taste.I have Verizon FiOS and am able to control the TV with one remote. (The TV comes with it's own remote, but this wouldn't work the set top box). The only problem I had using the FiOS remote was changing the volume when using the HDMI cable (which I eventually stuck with). At first I had to use the LG remote just for the volume. I finally found a trick in the FiOS remote instructions that show a setting to allow use of that remote for setting sound. The FiOS remote did control the sound when using the component video cables.All in all I am extremely happy with this TV and it is a great value for the price. You just need to do a bit of trial and error with the settings until you get the picture and sound you are most happy with. Thus I would suggest setting it up from the start with coax, component and HDMI cables and play around with them.

Setup was extremly easy, plug it in, hook up the source of your TV connection, I connected my HDMI cable from the cable box to HDMI1 on back of the TV (Make sure choose on the LG remote your connection input whether HDMI1, HDMI2, RCA cable setup or over the air antena, set the lanuage and the time zone, after that go to setting and choose Picture Wizard it will automatically adjust the TV colors for best setting and it has the intelligent Sensor feature it will also adjust the colors if the lighting is too bright or dark, you never have to adjust the picture, change your audio under setting from standard to cinema , it will give you more powerful detailed sound, then guess what...You are done! I couldn't believe how clear and true the colors are...just superb. Huge difference between my old one and the LG.

Sharpe \"Ghostbusters!\"", "ReviewID": "R15W3BXL4PCTCH", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This set seems to be perfect for what I need it for, TV and movies. No Netflix, no internet no junk. Simple hook ups on the back, a component input, audio input, 2 HDMI's and a USB which I'll never use. Finish is so nice, piano black. First the only real awful thing about this TV is that the USB is angled to out the side of the set, the HDMI's are not which they really should be.This TV is equipped with an energy saver, the factory apparently sets this at \"auto\" and the picture was awfully dim. I started playing with all the picture modes and setting and saw where you can turn this off and it makes the display much brighter which how I thought it would be at first. TV looks pretty amazing to me, I haven't seen a movie on it (only in power save mode) it was too dim to judge with that on. I haven't even hooked up an HDMi cable to it.I picture wizard? I didn't get a lot out of it, I just went through it and it looked like everything was where it needed to be, in the recommended setting which was fine. there is an \"edge enhancer\" which really improves the picture sharpness but makes some of the lines have a white outline to them, this is just on animated programs. So far we haven't watched any live-action movies but I'm willing to bet that they'll look outstanding as well, the Commercials on the TV look amazingly sharp.there is an adjustable setting for just about everything you can think of. Treble, Bass, Balance and you can even turn the speakers off. you can adjust sharpness of course, color, color Temperature (haven't figured that out yet), contrast, Backlight, brightness and etc. there are also Advanced settings like Gamma, Black level, Film mode, things like that. there are many other settings I still have yet to fool with that some people would find very helpful. You can probably download the manual and look at all these online before you buy.I was hoping for a removable power cord because the one supplied is about 4 foot long and the house I live in there is only an outlet about 12 feet away so I have a belkin surge suppressor hooked to it right now. I'll eventually get some else that can go behind the TV and not right in front of the subwoofer (the sub is sitting behind my front left speaker and the surge protector's cord is only 6' long and can't reach all the way to behind the TV.Not very heavy, very easy to put together and move around. you have to put the stand together on the TV, I wouldn't freak out about assembling this, there isn't much to it at all, you can almost look at it and tell how to do it.I am comparing this TV to an older Sanyo CRT and the picture was got to where it was pretty sweet even on it since it had Component video. The picture is sharper on this TV and I can't wait to not only replace the component cable with an HDMI cable. Plus coming from a CRT that weighed a ton this is basically heaven for me.The only thing I don't like is the Energy saver, I mean honestly, why would you buy a TV and have it dimmed all the time and not be able to enjoy to it's fullest extent? We started \"it's complicated\" the other night and I could not for anything get the picture bright enough then after we had to turn it off I realized this energy saver makes the screen very dark, it's much better without it on at all, although there are a handful of settings for it.UPDATE, still haven't gotten HDMI but to be honest we've only watched a few different things on it so far, King of the Hill, Ice Age and the Rescuers movies and the picture looks close enough to blu-ray. I'll still upgrade to HDMI but if Component video is all you have you'll be happy with that. The player I'm using is a Denon 3910, you may not get this good of picture from a cheaper player through Component video cables, it only 1080i and looks amazing. I'm quite content with the results of this combination. The video is being passed through an older non-HDMI receiver which is used to switch from DVR to DVD player. The cable I'm using is 24' long too, I had it used for a long run around half a small living room. I plan on again getting a much shorter HDMI cable.", "Date": "January 11, 2013"}, {"Title": "Nice Picture", "Author": "SusanATX", "ReviewID": "R3IT4OO9KEONK0", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "Nice picture, but sound is delayed to my other TV's so I can hear others in other rooms out of sinc.

I know LG's been having a lot of financial problems lately and their product quality in their appliances and electronics has gone down hill, but for $50 I took the jump. Well... now I know what happens when you skimp and go $50 less than most other higher quality TVs.Came with a clear manufacturing defect where the back panel screw holes were visible through damage to the LCD in the form of 6 perfectly placed purple dots on the screen when colors were dark. Rather than replacing my defect model I'm getting a refund and ordering a Panasonic LCD with impeccable image quality and product reviews for $50 more.Also, the color quality and overall HD quality was extremely poor. Maybe this is unreasonable given that I'm comparing it to a Panasonic plasma, but other Samsung and Panasonic LCDs that I've seen aren't so annoying to look at.PS: Mad props to Amazon for making the refund process painless.

Ivory", "ReviewID": "R2AS8WNVBQK0HK", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I received this television as a Christmas gift last year Christmas 2011. When you first get it you will LOVE it. The screen quality is beautiful, the sound is perfect. There are various options to choose from for different programs, if you are watching movies or sports you can set the screen for enhancement. BUT then the television for no apparent reason starts to turn itself off. It's a constant ANNOYING problem, because once it turns itself off, it turns itself back on again, and then off in about 3 seconds. It continues doing that in a loop until finally it turns itself off and stays off. The remote won't work to turn it back on nor will the button on the side of the TV. You have to unplug it from the wall and then MAYBE it will turn back on, and if it does turn back on it will stay on for a while and then begin to turn itself off again. It first started happening about seven months after I had it when I watched a Netflix movie on the TV. It stopped right in the middle of the movie. I ended up taking it to a repair shop and they took the dongle off of it, and it began working fine. No I don't have warranty papers or anything because my sister gave it to me as a gift and didn't keep the receipts or anything oops. Doesn't matter though because all of the people online who have warranties said they are ignored by LG, speak to rude representatives, and/or have a huge problem getting any assistance. Some have been placed on a repair person waiting list for months. Anyway that  removal of dongle fix lasted for about a month, so of course I thought it was the dongle causing the problem. Then I decided to hook up my Xbox to the TV. MISTAKE! I didn't even play a game I watched a movie one day and it was fine, a couple of days later I watched another movie on Xbox and now the TV is turning on and off again. Yes I unhooked the Xbox, but I am still having the problem...It's just my TV you say... I have a lemon... well when I went to check online for help there were over THREE THOUSAND complaints about the same issue with this television. Once again, I warn you DO NOT BUY THIS TV!!! Although I received this TV as a gift I will NEVER buy an LG product EVER! I'm just going to end up putting this TV in the other room and go back to my non HD Sony TV that I've had for more than ten years.

For the most part this TV fits that criteria.  It was up and running out of the box in minutes. There were only two problems I noticed. One, and I knew this before I bought it, there is only one set of component plugs.  This means that they had to forsake their older DVD player for the Wii that they use when their grandchildren visit.  I have thought about buying a new blueray which can be plugged into the HDMI port, but that will have to be for another time.  The second is that  was that one of the reasons I got it was the feature that supposedly brings balance between dialogue and background (if you ever watched a new movie on an old TV you will notice that the dialogue can be drowned out by background noise and music).  This doesn't work as well as I thought it would, but my parents feel it is a great improvement over their old tube TV.There is no audio out, so the speakers will have to be good enough, and they are.  The volume has never gone above \"10\" and even at 10 it was pretty loud and still clear.  I don't know what \"10\" is out of, but the audio display bar is barely a quarter of the way when it is on 10.If getting a TV for normal cable and over the air stations, with the occasional DVD is what you want, then this is perfect. Lightweight, thin, good picture, and audio.

It took me maybe five minutes to assemble and hook it up. All I needed was to borrow the neighbors phillips-head screwdriver. The set has four screws for the attaching the flat panel to the base, and it wasn't all that difficult, once I put on my reading glasses and opened the instruction manual. I have Charter cable, which plugged into the back with ease. The original settings were good, but I was able to redefine the overall settings, picture size, sound quality, etc. and the customized settings are great. I also plugged in my HDMI cable and watched Harry Potter DVDs the first night with no problem at all. The only issue I've had with the set is not being able to use an external sound system. I have difficulty hearing some sounds. I bought a set of headphones with a wireless tower that is supposed to plug into the headphone plug on the LG. It doesn't work. I still haven't been able to figure it out. If anyone else has solved this problem, let me know.  All in all, I'd recommend this HDTV without reservation. This picture quality alone (1080p) is brilliant. The 32-inch size is just right for a small apartment or large den.

Luckily I had an extended warranty and I got a replacement 32\" LG HDTV because the motherboard, or whatever they call it for these tvs, was defective and it would have cost too much to repair so it was more logical for me to get the replacement. So I got the replacement. Had it for about 2 years then there was problems with the HDMI input in regards to the screen being faulty and the signal cutting out. This tv I didn't have an extended warranty for and the basic warranty was out. That's 2 of these 32\" LG HDTVs I've had with a similar issue with their internal components. A lot of these reviews you'll read are on immediate impressions, but I am here to mention my longer term impressions with LG. And sadly they don't meet my long term expectations. And it's a shame I have to chuck these tvs out after not even five years of moderate use just because of minor issues. But if you want a television that will last you longer then look elsewhere.

A second 42\" purchased some months later went black (would produce sound but no picture) and the third, a 32\", started powering on and off by itself for no reason when changing channels and became unwatchable.

This TV however, has been a problem from the start.I ordered the TV on Sunday night looking to replace an older LG that I loved.  I was going down from a 120GHz to the 60GHZ as I rarely used it on my previous set, even when gaming.  I was a little nervous about this, but I knew I could return it if I was not happy.Prime let me send it overnight to be here on Tuesday for $3.99, but on Tuesday morning the UPS website indicated it would not be here until Wednesday.  I called customer service and they apologized and refunded my $3.99 shiping.  I considered canceling the order and buying the TV at the local Walmart, but decided to wait one day even though CS told me I could cancel the order right then.On Wednesday the TV came, and had a completely smashed screen.  I called CS again, and they indicatd they would send out a replacement, and a UPS driver with a slip to pick up the broken set with 1-5 days.  I called back an hour later to just cancel the order, but they told me I had to refuse delivery instead.  That seemed weird because they could have cancelled it on the truck the day before.  I then noticed it was being sold for $50 cheaper than when I bought it, so they refunded me the $50 due to the low price guarantee.So, the TV finally came on Thursday, and the broken set was also picked up later that day.  The TV is OK, but it's a lot cheaper build that their previous sets.  Even the menu graphics look cheaper.  It could just be a more basic model, and it seems fine for the $, but I'm not impressed by it.
