Received this tv free when purchasing another item for my house (obviously the \"free\" aspect makes me a bit biased) but as it so happens, I have another tv comparable to this one already. I also have a Phillips 32\" LED flat panel model# PFL4505D/F7 that I purchased about 3 years ago for $300-350 (when that was about the lowest price for a 32\" flat panel, especially name brand) and this one has features I've wished for on my Phillips since I bought that one!!!I've spent about an hour playing with this tv, the color saturation and picture controls are more customizable than my Phillips and the picture quality is comparable (the Phillips has \"modes\" more than adjustment \"bars\" for specific settings like the Seiki). The sound is pretty good, it's a bit better than the Phillips (Seiki's speakers are on the bottom of the panel pointing down and I believe my Phillips has them pointing backwards). I usually use the tv's speakers rather than the home theater I have since I live in an apartment and don't want to be \"that neighbor;\" that said, I'm sure a home theater would deliver superior sound quality but I'm not at all disappointed having spent a couple years being acclimated to \"flat panel\" speakers.The awesome part!!!! (for some of us) VGA/D-SUB port!!!! For the non-geeks that means if your computer has a monitor cable using the blue connector end (with the little thumb-screws connected) it will work on this tv. My wife uses a netbook to write papers for grad school and uses a monitor instead of the tiny netbook screen so she can see multiple windows (Win Starter won't let you extend your desktop, only mirror) now she could EASILY see multiple windows. . . but she'll probably laugh at me and tell me that I'm strange and that a 32\" computer monitor would be overkill. . . go price a 32\" computer monitor. . . they're astronomical. Planning to see if I can make my desktop pc's graphics card angry by using HDMI, D-SUB, and DVI out simultaneously to play a computer game whenever I get free time, it'll either be cool or expensive (melting computer parts). Lol. It's also got a usb port. . . maybe I'll plug in my USB pet rock. . . no, seriously, they make those, they're on Amazon, go search for them, you know you want to.While I can't speak to the product's longevity, I'm pretty satisfied with it. As of right now, assuming it doesn't break quickly, I would look as Seiki products in the future. It seems like if you can find this tv for sale it's near the bottom of the price point for comparable units. I haven't seen anything thus far that would make me shy away from this tv for the $200-300 range. That said, these are all first impressions so. . . grain of salt.", "Date": "September 14, 2013"}, {"Title": "Great Value", "Author": "Bud", "ReviewID": "RMAUQA6X7830Q", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Bought this TV because of the price.  Price was a major consideration because it will only get used about 2 hours a week.  I hooked it up and programmed it which took about two minutes.  I also selected my favorite sound output and discovered the TV had a built in equalizer. Excellent sound for a small low priced TV.  I am quite impressed with the options and quality of the TV.  I also noticed it had 3 HDMI and PC connection ports.  I would surely buy it again and will look at other Seiki products in the future.", "Date": "November 16, 2012"}, {"Title": "Its All Good", "Author": "Nancy Hernandez", "ReviewID": "R385XKE2NWM4D8", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "The Tv Has All Digital Not The Clearest Picture But For The Price Its Well Worth The Buy For An Hd Tv", "Date": "January 10, 2013"}, {"Title": "TV", "Author": "T.

It's a great purchase for a second bedroom TV or spare guest room, or even those just wanting a quality HDTV without any of the frills of newer TV sets.It has 3 HDMI, 1 Component, 1 Composite, VGA/PC.Screen quality is great if you take the time to adjust picture settings from their preset values. I have it currently hooked up to my Wii U ( as well as PS2 ) and haven't had any issues with video game consoles. Sound is average for TV speakers, but you can add external speakers or a sound system if you wish. Does not have Optical Input, so you'd have to use RCA jacks (red/white) for sound.The inputs are lined up to the left of the TV on the back, and there are physical buttons (power, volume up/down, channel up/down, etc.) on the right edge bezel.The stand assembly was a little odd as you need a screwdriver for 4 screws. Maybe I\"m just used to other HDTVs having the big metal bolt that secures it to the TV.Setup is a breeze, menus are clean and are not confusing. Power on time is pretty good, as is the switching of inputs. The remote has all the buttons and then some. It's useful just pressing the specific button than having to dig through the menus to find the desired function.Brand name \"Seiki\" may be a big question of unknown TV quality, but in my experience, it seems great! If you are worried about the long-term reliability of a TV, purchase a warranty service from companies such as SquareTrade.Pros:+Weight+Easy to Setup+Remote is fully featured+Picture qualityCons:-Not 1080p-Assembly of base is unusual for some-Brand name may be a turn-off", "Date": "December 7, 2013"}, {"Title": "great tv", "Author": "tern2", "ReviewID": "RESOYLME6YBX3", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "So far so good.

I could have stuck to my old boob tube but I needed HD man. You know how it is, especially with all these pretty games like Witcher 2 and Skyrim wishing to be appreciated in full high definition glory. Being the budget conscience (cheap/broke) guy that I am, I went on a quest to browse amazon for deals. There had to be something that was cheap and relatively large out in this day and age right? Wrong. I guess I could have sprung for that $250 32inch on sale with all the refresh rate bs but I don't really care about that and it was 50 dollars more than I had at the time. After a few hours on google and amazon looking at 23\"-28\" tvs I stumbled onto this one that was not only larger than the ones I had been browsing, but actually a little cheaper. Seiki? Who the hell is that? I thought it may be some knock off brand that trys to sell crap quality electronics. Don't Care. Read the reviews that said it worked, and I was sold. For a whooping $170 dollars I got a 32inch HD tv. It looks just like everyone else's, and the picture looks great. I don't know anything about TV's  other than what the pictures coming out of it should look like. I can't tell any difference playing my xbox on this cheapo (in price, not quality) tv and playing it on my friends $350/400 32inch tv. As an added bonus, I used the free super saving shipping that usually takes forever to get anywhere and i got it in 2 days. Not 2 business days, 2 days. I ordered it, waited one day, then got it the next day after work. Free. Probably cant rely on this instance for your experience, but still that was awesome. Easy to set up too.
