After spending 4 hours on the phone with support, and being told 3 different stories and having to change all the setting, including connecting the tv directly to the modem they gave up and said to take it back.The LG immediately connected and downloaded up dates. Then when I clicked on HULU I just had to log in with my password, and I was watching stuff in my queue.Connecting the LG was easier as the connections are flat on the back facing out, not up in a hole facing down as the vizio was. [It is hard to screw on a type f when you can't get your fingers around it.] The only setup I had to change after it scanned the channels was to remove channels Ididn't want, and to go in settings and tell it to use the fiber port for sound instead of the speakers.It does do 5.1 and DTS both, and even did 5.1 on a you tube video.The picture on the LG looks better out of the box then the vizio did after adjusting everything.On the vizio to see what program is on the channel you have tuned to you have to press a button,and then it is in small letter that are not readable from across the room.  The LG has a banner across the top as you change channels with the channel numbers, station call sign, and the name of the program.  If you click on this it takes you to a banner at the bottom that will give you info on what is on next for several hours. That was not available on the vizio at all.The LG has a setting for aspect ratio called \"set by program\".  This takes care of the stretchingor squeezing that happens between programs.  I never could find that setting on the vizio, andwas constantly having to change the wide or narrow setting.The LG has a setting so you can turn off the screen and just have sound for listening tointernet radio.The LG has a web browser that looks somewhat like firefox and has bing for search.No browser on the vizio even if it would have connected.Also the LG will do Skype and face book with the addition of a optional camera.The speakers on the LG are on the bottom instead of on the back as the vizio.The LG also has a 5 band equalizer in the sound settings.The remote on the LG is a bit strange.  It is like a mouse and has a pointer.  To move the pointeryou just move the remote.  It has a scroll button just like a mouse that can be used for multiplethings including changing channels.The remote on the vizio was a pain, because about 50% of the time it would double clickand you had to go back to get to what you wanted.The only complaint about the LG is the full manual is only on the help screen, or download, but not as pdf. The downloaded manual is in white letters on black background and 203 pages, which means printing it would use all my black ink.", "Date": "December 26, 2013"}, {"Title": "Meh...", "Author": "RjB", "ReviewID": "R3KKBQMNI47395", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "The setup was easy, the picture is good and the wifi is very good. The sound was horrible, though, I had to shell out for a sound bar. The \"magic\" remote is a pain in the neck; as pointing devices go it's only barely adequate in most cases for the smart TV functions (including browsing) and it makes the simplest functions (like going to a specific channel) ridiculously hard so I tend to avoid most of the \"smart\" capabilities the TV has. For that matter, a number of the usual functions/capabilities I've come to expect from a TV are not supported; you can only consistently get program information if you use a \"cable box\" (I get program info for 2 channels out of nearly 100), the channels are laid out based on source (TV/DTV) so 2.0 is 70 channels away from 2.1, and there is no \"back\" capability to go back to the last channel viewed (my previous TV allowed setting up to 4 channels for surf/back capability, which worked great for college football Saturday). so, generally, I'm hoping this LG dies soon so I can justify going back to a Sony Bravia to my wife.", "Date": "December 4, 2013"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "Unavailable", "Features": "LG SMART TV\nTRUMOTION 120HZ\nLED BACKLIGHTING\nFULL HD 1080P RESOLUTION\nENERGY STAR\u00ae MOST EFFICIENT 2013 TELEVISION", "Name": "LG LG 47LN5750 47IN 1080P LED SMARTTV (REUFRBISHED)", "ImgURL": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/31644XYr1XL._SX300_.jpg", "ProductID": "B00C4WOW7Y"}}
