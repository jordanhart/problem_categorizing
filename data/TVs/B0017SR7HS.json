{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Great TV", "Author": "Houston Customer", "ReviewID": "RGHUT6DLATRO0", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Found this TV at Circuit City for 799 (sale is now over).  I have had the TV for a week.  I also have a 50 Samsung Plasma, both on HD.  The JVC has a better picture on both regular and HD channels.  I like the Ipod feature.  You need to play with the sound equalizer to get the best quality out of an Ipod without a sound system. Ipod video is fair.Pros:  Picture quality - HD and SD, integration of Ipod, sound is above avg from built in speakers (after tweaking settings).Cons: Remote does not completely control DVR cable box, manual not clear on initial connection setting particularly for component cables on accessories (requires using the remote in a way that is not obvious).I would buy this TV again.", "Date": "December 30, 2008"}, {"Title": "Nice TV - Ipod functionality limited", "Author": "Michael E. Henderson", "ReviewID": "RBDNKG8NBL0IP", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "The TV is great...on its own.  I am totally impressed with the TV.  I have to confess the Ipod Teleport is not that great, at least to me.  You can't toggle playlists and you can't listen to the Ipod in TV mode.  To switch playlists you have to manually do that on the ipod.  I think this is a seriously flaw.  Who the heck wants to have to walk up and toggle to switch playlists.  Also your play list will not show up on the screen so you have to push forward to get to other songs.  As I write this, I am higly disappointed with the Ipod function.  If you are buying for this reason, please don't.  If you are buying this for the TV, then ok.  But the Ipod dock SHOULD NOT be your determing factor.", "Date": "August 15, 2008"}, {"Title": "JVC 42\" 1080p review", "Author": "C.
