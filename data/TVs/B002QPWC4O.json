{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Superb TV for a great price", "Author": "Jeremy", "ReviewID": "R141EBTWW1BYKI", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "We recently purchased this television from a different store but were impressed as soon as we turned it on.  We had received a 24\" Vizio LCD for Christmas, but its quality was severely lacking - the picture went dark very quickly if you viewed the screen off-center, even about 10-20 degrees off axis - to the point that having the television on top of a chest of drawers caused it to be too high to watch TV with any decent quality.  We returned that one and bought the SV320XVT and were blown away by comparison.Pros: The 1080p quality at 120Hz makes digital television channels look great.  Device buttons are easily accessible for changing inputs instead of pressing a single \"Source\" or \"Input\" button multiple times to get to the input you want.  There are three HDMI inputs, which is great for a cable/satellite tuner, Blu-Ray player, and another source (we use it for the Canon 7D's video output).  The viewing angle is excellent, especially for an LCD.  We were able to get a consistent view at about 120-140 degrees off-axis.  Different video modes are available for different types of viewing (Basketball, Golf, Baseball, Movies, Normal, etc.).  Sound quality out-of-the-box is excellent, though a surround sound system could be hooked up with either RCA, HDMI, or TOSlink.Cons: 120Hz can still make some live-acted shows and movies look computer animated, but that happens with any TV that has this feature.  This TV does not have a 10/100 network port, which I've only seen on a few televisions at this point, but it would be nice to have it for web streaming.  There is an RGB input, however, so we can still hook it up to a computer.  I'd also like if the TV had an alarm clock on it, but that's a very minor issue.  Also, having a jog dial on the bottom right side of the panel makes for an awkward way of controlling power, volume, and channel control; I'd rather have actual buttons for each.  It took trial and error to figure out that adjusting the volume from the side did not require me to push the button inward to confirm the change, as that just turned off the TV.", "Date": "December 27, 2009"}, {"Title": "Good Solid TV", "Author": "SD PHOTOG \"SD PHOTOG\"", "ReviewID": "RAEJCEA52AXPG", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "\"We were looking for a Bedroom TV that didn't dominate the whole space so we were excited to see the \"slim-ness\" of the unit and the small bezel around the LCD. The unit is nice and light so it can be easily transferred and wall mounted.The picture quality is great, it's quality exceeds our three year old Phillips LCD and equals the PQ of our two month old 52\" Sony Bravia. HD signals from BLU-RAY and TiVo HD (w/ HD CableCARD) look wonderful with rich colors and sharp picture. The Smooth Motion (120Hz) does create the \"Soap Opera Effect\", but it can be turned off in the setup men. There are plenty of video tweaks in the menus just like the other Major Brands.The sound quality was really good. Obviously nothing that gets you to 5.1 home theater level but has plenty of options for audio mode adjustments.The build quality is wonderful, solid, slim, design, down to the box it came in. The remote is good, looks pretty, the channel up/down Volume up/down button light up, which is a nice touch. The inputs in the back are configured well, with nice color separation for visual cues.The only issues that prevented the TV from getting a Solid 5 is the Menu system and remote's button layout.The setup menu was difficult to navigate, with some important settings buried deep in submenus upon submenus.The input menu does not give the option to \"skip\" or \"not display\" inputs that aren't in use. This is an issue when you only have two devices connected to the TV but you have click through 8 inputs to get to the device you want.This is a solid TV and our first VIZIO product.

Benson \"Benny90\"", "ReviewID": "R266VSKGG4J87O", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I have owned many LCD TV's over the years. From Sharp to Sony and from Magnavox and Toshiba. My most recent was a beautiful 24\" LED TV and a 46\" Sharp Aquous LCD TV. I have also owned over 5 32\" HDTV's, the most recent being a Sony KDL-32S5100 and before that a 40\" KDL-40S4100. While I was entirely happy with the excellent quality of the S4100 the S5100 was HUGELY disappointing. The S4100 had some higher end specs with a 10-bit panel and a very nice casing. As the SonyKDL-32S5100 nearly directly competes with the Vizio SV320XVT I will compare the two. As a cost saving initive by Sony the S5100 dropped all the quality parts. It has a lesser 8-but panel and the casing overall feels cheap and is a much lesser quality than I had come to expect from Sony, especially in this price range. The Vizio however screams of quality.The looks of this set is absolutely beautiful. You can truely tell that Vizio took their top of the line parts and put them all into this awesome package.  The casing of the set is stunning. It has a beautiful gloss black surrounding the screen with the speakers, which are the best I have heard from a set this size, sit at the bottom. A very cool little feature is the light up VIzio branding under the screen. It glows a pleasent orange when the set is off and white when it is on. Even the remote is high quality. It is by far the nicest remote to come with any TV I have ever owned. It is super thin and light has a gloss black and chrome case and also has universal remote capability. I have it controlling a Samsung Blu-Ray player, which by the way looks simply awesome on this set. Smother awesome thing about the set is that it is only 2.2 inches thick! This leaves a bunch of extra space on my table for anything else that I want and would be excellent for wall mounting.Unlike other 1080P sets that I have had SD content looks very good, even coming in straight from a wall jack. The HD 1080P processing on this set is in a league of it's own, image truely pop from the screen, unlike the Sony which was only just ok. Some people do not like 120Hz sets as they can sometimes have weird effects on what you are watching. I can proudly say that that is not the case here. Another huge plus are the speakers. On my Sony I had to get a separate sound bar to have the sound quality that I wanted. However, no sound bar is needed for this set. I don't get the low end bass that I got with it but everything else, mids and highs sound perfect.If you can't tell, I am absolutely in love with this TV and recommend it to anyone looking for a 32\" HDTV. It is an amazing TV at an amazing price.

This is my fourth lcd t.v. Other brands i own are philips 42 inch 1080p, mavnavox 32 inch 1080i and a samsung 24 inch 1080p. I bought this t.v. to replace my 24 inch samsung i was using as a gaming/computer work bench monitor and i have to say i am not sorry for making the purchase. It exceeds the picture quality of my samsung 1080p. I upgraded my video card in my pc to include an hdmi output in which transfers both video and sound to the t.v. so i therefore eliminate the audio cable if i were for use the rgb pc input. The t.v. has a rca audio out for easy connection to a stereo system or simply buy a rca to 3.5 heaphone jack to connect to pc speakers in which is my setup. The graphics through my xbox 360 is awesome in game mode. Video from my pc is pretty good i am still messing with the settings which may be my video card or the t.v.'s setting.

I usually shop things to death but in this case time did not allow that luxury.  I had intended to buy a Samsung but decided to take a chance on this unit because of price, availability and advise from a knowledgeable family member.  I have not been disappointed in any way with my choice.  Set up was quick and easy although the manual could use some work on some of the features.  The picture and the sound both off the dish and the antenna is perfect and compares to much more expensive units I have watched.  I really like the wide viewing angle and how sharp and viewable the picture is at extreme angles.  The remote buttons are a little small and crowded and the remote could use back lit buttons never the less it gives you complete control over the televisions features.

We isolated the problem to the TV set (not the HDMI cable or set-top/DVR box). After troubleshooting, Vizio technical said the problem was particular to my TV set and offered to fix it. But, since I was in the 30 day purchase period, I returned the set. I re-ordered the same model and will let you know how it works.The audio problem was unusual because the failure on a given channel seemed to depend on the way you accessed the channel. I mean if I used the channel+ button to get to channel 840, for example, there was absolutely no audio. If I continued to use channel+ to go up a few channels and then used channel- to get back to channel 840, I often had full audio. The DVR audio failure was intermittent, also. I could try to play a DVR and get no audio but if I changed the channel that I was tuned to and went back to play the DVR sometimes I got audio.

Kelly", "ReviewID": "R3NTZWVR29OV8Y", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Okay, so I spent about three weeks scouring Amazon for good, technical reviews on 32-inch TV's. I recently canceled my cable TV, so I began using my computer to watch things and play some Xbox occasionally; my 27-inch monitor wasn't really cutting it anymore.I decided that a 32-inch was just enough of an upgrade to make it easier on the eyes. I wasn't really looking for anything top-tier, but I was definitely hoping for slightly better quality. My Samsung P2770HD was versatile, but the vertical viewing angles and light bleed were pretty big issues.Vizio has stepped up its game lately, so I figured I'd give them my money and see how it went. Amazon has a good return policy, after all.I couldn't be happier.The first thing I did after getting this display and turning it on was getting up close and personal and taking a look at the pixels. Mine arrived with an IPS panel, which is easy to tell by looking at the geometry of the pixels. A quick Google image search will show you what I mean.So, I was immediately satisfied. I knew this would be a lot better, but I wasn't expecting everything that came my way.- The contrast is pretty incredible. I actually had to turn it down to 30 / 100 to make it usable as a computer monitor.- The backlight is really, really strong. Keep in mind this does NOT mean \"brightness.\" This is the actual power of the light that lights the screen. I keep this at about 80-85 depending upon the media.- Viewing angles are pretty incredible. Vertically: awesome. Horizontally: awesome.- Resolution is obviously 1920x1080. Not bad if you're sitting 3-4 feet away from it as a computer and 8-10 for movies / games. It could be sharper, of course, but I'm not complaining. You just have to get used to the new DPI and make some sacrifices unless you have $2,000 for a professional monitor.- Picture adjustments within the menu are pretty in-depth, and contrary to what I read in reviews here, the menu system isn't confusing at all.- Build quality is good and it's a really thin TV. I'll be mounting it on the wall behind my desk soon to save some space. I imagine it'll be pretty easy since this isn't a bulky TV.- Sound could be better, but who cares? It's good enough and I have external speakers anyway, as this is mostly a computer monitor.- 120hz is nice, but keep in mind that Mac OS X does not recognize that. At least, not that I've been able to see.Other than all of that, I have yet to stumble across any negatives. It takes quite a bit of time to calibrate and get it to more \"neutral\" settings for everyday use, but once you're done with that, you're good to go.Assuming all of this model are manufactured as IPS displays, then I highly recommend this purchase. Just be 100% sure that it's IPS when it shows up at your door, or else send it back. Get your money's worth.Kudos to Vizio for a good first impression.", "Date": "January 23, 2011"}, {"Title": "Great TV Buy", "Author": "N.

For sound I also found online that the factory settings for the equalizer are set too high and tuned them down to get a very acceptable sound but not as good as I would prefer, still has a laptop sound quality too it, at least to me. So again, if only I could attach external speakers to the set directly and have the TV sound control control them. Hate to, but I may have to go to an amp for externals.

Split-screen too!", "Author": "PakoPako", "ReviewID": "R1UQDBDN6Q3OHZ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "First off, let me say that I love having split-screen. Absolutely cannot live without it. I had it on an old ViewSonic, and when that went out, I was worried since very few models today support split-screen. Samsung and SONY have PnP/PoP/split-screen with PC inputs, but not with HDMI or component or composite. I don't know why -- who doesn't think it's awesome to watch the weather report (TV) and play Rock Band (Xbox) at the same time? Or split their TV so one half of the room can use the PS3 (HDMI) while the other half is on the Wii (YPbPr)? I have a DVR with its own tuner so I can even watch two shows side-by-side. VIZIO is one of if not THE last brand to keep Picture-in-Picture, Picture-outside-Picture, or Split-Screen viewing.Onto the review.Isn't technology great? My last LCD TV was about the same size, but weighed almost FOUR times as much. This Vizio SV320XVT is so incredibly light, I can lift it with one arm! The knob is a great space-saving innovation and the universal remote has a (half) clear and easy-to-read layout. The viewing area is 1-for-1, pixel perfect if you nitpick about that sort of thing. (I do; my old LCD had 5% overscan so stuff like TV logos or team scores in the lower corners of the screen are cut off.) It's also got more inputs than you can imagine, from VGA/RGB to even S-Video! On top of that, you can have up to 10 customizable color/brightness pre-sets (great for all the inputs you're putting through).The colors are amazing, though not as great as my friend's Panasonic 40\" Viera LCD. But he paid almost three times as much, so he deserves that. The built-in speakers are serviceable, but if you have external ones (via RCA stereo or SPDIF) then I'd suggest using those. If this is going to be your bedroom cozy-TV, you can probably live with the standard speakers, but the internal mixer settings are pretty bad if you go beyond \"flat\".The worst end of this deal is the Smooth Motion. It bumps up the screen frequency to 120 Hz to show realistic movement. It actually works like a charm and even 80's episodes of Law & Order look like they were happening in front of your eyes. However, human eyes aren't really used to 120 Hz viewing and prolonged exposure (in my case, 1 minute, 47 seconds) can cause dizziness or nausea.The remote I said was pretty clear, and that's half true. The split-screen viewing buttons and universal switches are difficult to see and reach, but the channels and menu buttons are nice and big. (Plus the volume and channel surf buttons light up when pressed.)After half a year of usage, there is a bit of an EMF buzz from the power adapter built inside, but that's to be expected from most electronics these days. For anyone who hands their TVs flush against their walls, you'll need those \"elbow\" plugs because this thin TV doesn't have enough depth to offer downward-facing inputs.Bottom-line: If you want a great-performing 32\" TV for an affordable price, you don't have to look anywhere else. It's even light with legacy inputs and split-screen. Just be sure to lower all the brightness settings first.", "Date": "February 10, 2012"}, {"Title": "Excellent 32\" flat screen LCD TV", "Author": "Jordan M. Braunstein", "ReviewID": "R3HHEG1703NW5M", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I was initially interested in this television via a DELL Home discount, but decided to order through Amazon, at only a marginally higher price.  I was looking for something to replace an aging 27\" CRT.I'm what you might consider an informed TV consumer; I know a few things about panel display differences, refresh rates, response time, signal-sourcing, pull-down methods etc.  After some research, I decided that this Vizio was a good buy, and I'm happy to report it's met my expectations.The TV is very slim, light and low-profile with a handsome stand but would be a good candidate for wall mounting.  As any HDTV owner knows, picture quality depends on several factors in addition to the quality of the television itself; Fortunately, HD signals look wonderful and while there are enough advanced picture options to tweak to your hearts content, the preset picture \"modes\" do a fine job of representing a range of different looks and tones for whatever is being displayed (ex. movie mode provides a warm color filter that replicates the look of film rather well, while \"game\" is appropriately bright and punchy).  The panel is an IPS display, which is important in that the richness of the color and picture is maintained without distortion or wash-out at wide angles of view.  Non-HD sourced video will look crappy at any angle, but that's par for the course.The 120hz true-motion feature is great for smoothing out fast action and decreasing judder while watching sports or other media shot on video.  Be aware that it will artificially add that \"shot on video\" effect to film and other media recorded at 24fps for which this is not intended, ruining the viewing experience in my opinion.  Good thing its easy to turn on/off from the menu.With 4 HDMI ports and a USB port for flash drives, its ready for multiple inputs and can easily serve as a nice computer monitor too (haven't tried that myself).One important thing about the sound.  Volume shouldn't be an issue in any moderately sized room.  However, turn the simulated surround sound ON (its off by default).  The difference is night and day.  You will think this TV's speakers are garbage until you turn that setting on, at which point the sound quality instantly becomes great for integrated speakers on a flat-panel.  If you're connecting your own speakers or home-theater system, this is a moot point.If you buy this TV, you won't be disappointed as long as you know what to expect.  My only personal quibble is that it's a little too small for the room it's placed in, but that's my fault, not the TVs.  Bear in mind, 32\" is not a big screen!  If you're going to be sitting more than 5 ft. away from the screen, I'd recommend a 37\"-42\" screen at a minimum for the best experience.", "Date": "May 18, 2011"}, {"Title": "Don't buy this product", "Author": "Paul J Gscheidle", "ReviewID": "R3MR01ZF75C7GP", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "After just a year and a half, this TV developed the irritating habit of turning itself off for no apparent reason.

The quality of the sound that does come out is rather poor, but when you hit the bass sounds it rattles like the speakers have been blown and it did this right out of the box.  EXTREMELY annoying.  For such an expensive item I expect it, to you know, work.The logo on the face lights up.  Annoying.The finish is a gloss black which I personally hate.  I AM happy to say that the screen is more a matte finish as opposed to gloss so it's not going to reflect every single ray of sunshine.Lightweight for such a large screen and slim.  If the sound weren't shot out of the box I'd have given a much higher rating although I generally wait a while for more complete reviews.UPDATE 3.09.11I returned it to amazon (I love you amazon) and tried again.  The sound in my old apartment still wasn't that great and certain base sounds still caused a slight blown speaker sound but it was MUCH better.  In my new apartment the sound is great and I'm playing it at a lower volume (I'm not sure why this is the case as my other apartment was smaller.  I moved within two weeks of the first purchase).Overall I'm much happier with the product and no longer feel the need for external speakers.Of note for those who plan to mount it to a wall:  The outputs are somewhat in the way of the brackets and you'll either need connections with 90 degree turns or you'll be scrunching your cords a bit because the output is right where the bracket bar hits.Due to everything and the new monitor I'm upping my current review to three stars.  Hopefully this has some good life to it.  The picture is incredible.  the sound isn't that great, but is working better at lower volume (over 50 seems to be where the issues are.

The picture is outstanding, sound is more than acceptable, considering no 32\" HDTV has great sound (I recommend an add-on of the stereo \"Sound Bar\" for around $120). As for construction, the Vizio is no different in quality than any other set on them market. One negative is the on set controls, which are virtually non-existent. You get an on-off push button that shuttles left and right.  The Panasonic, by comparison has a fully load instrument panel on the side.

Not as solid as other remotes,but again, if you're hooked up to a cable box,the Vizio remote can be put in a drawer. You use the cable universal remote. The only glitch we found may have come from our cable installer, since after the cable box was set up, the Vizio remote stopped working entirely, which is not good in the event you need to bump up source volume, etc.All in all, Vizio is a remarkable \"dark horse\" brand, perhaps used more in corporate and commercial venues.

Piper", "ReviewID": "RUJWP77TTJF02", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I've had this TV for about three weeks, after replacing a 27-year-old Zenith that was still in good working condition (if only all electronic appliances could be counted on to last so long!).  After doing some research, I knew I wanted a set with a 120 refresh rate.  I saw this one for a great price at BJ's, and I have been very happy with it.  The picture is chrystal clear, and the sound quality is quite good (not comparing it to any kind of fancy theatre system, obviously, but as far as I'm concerned, it's very adequate for my needs).  Some reviews have complained of the lighted \"Vizio\" logo in front, and I feared it would be distracting, but I haven't been bothered by it at all.  Too much going on on the screen for my peripheral vision to take notice of the lighted word beneath.  I hope this TV will last a long time, but just in case, I insured it with an inexpensive SquareTrade warranty, which is very economical compared with store or manufacturer warranties ([...]).  So, just adding my two cents to the other glowing reviews; I don't think you'll be disappointed if you purchase this product.", "Date": "July 7, 2010"}, {"Title": "Best Computer Monitor Ever...ok not ever but almost", "Author": "Warren Massey", "ReviewID": "RSF2C7BUDMQ2B", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I bought this TV almost a year ago and have had plenty of time to work with it. The purpose of the TV was to be my new computer monitor so the review will mostly focus on that. My requirments were 1080P for higher desktop resolution at 1920x1080, 120hz as it is occassionaly used for media, and overall sharpness/colors. This TV exceeded this in all categories. I previously purchased and still own a SV420XVT I purchased for the bedroom and was our first Vizio purchase.Vizio really impressed me with the cost and quality so I went with the SV320XVT after extensive research. First, on the TV it did everything I wanted. The desktop, as I type right now is crisp as the best Sony monitor. I have no refresh issues and the sound quality with virtual surround is eerily good. I say that because it is able to simulate rear right and left speakers even though I sit 2 feet from the TV. So, as a computer monitor I could reccomend this more and I really look at it as a very long term investment. This is due to the high feature set since this is a premium model from Vizio and the fact were not going to see the succesor to 1080P anytime soon.That covers the review, now Ill tell you about the pros and cons of using a TV as a computer monitor. Most of these I learned POST purchase, so please read this.Pros1. Very large screen, at 32 inches you will have no issues seeing the desktop icons, pictures, or text. If you have any vision problems, I highly reccomend looking into a 26+ inch 1080P TV as a monitor.2. Great for media playback, with 1080P and 120hz, the TV faithfully reproduces movies with astounding quality. I say this as a home theater specialist with a number of mid to high end TVs/Projectors.Cons1. Very large screen. So why did I repeate a pro? Because I believe I came close to making a big mistake, not with this TV but with its bigger brother, the SV370XVT. The reason is that 1080P or 1920x1080 is in fact a very large and respectable resolution but the larger the screen that the resolution is used on, the bigger everything looks. Icons are enlarged, text is bigger, etc. So in essence, as you increase in screen size but remain at the same resolution, you begin losing desktop real estate.So the reason I mentioned the SV370XVT is because I was so close to pulling the trigger but I felt it may be too big for 1080P and boy was I right. At 32 inches, I think 1080P hits a little above the sweet spot for computer monitors. A 27 or 30 inch is probably the sweet spot but you dont get that \"Giant Screen in front of your Face\" coolness. So think carefully on the size you want, again I reccomend the 32 overall.2. Sound, oh man, Sound. So, Sound is really good on the TV but I discovered that to use the sound for a PC with DVI through HDMI, many a hurdle is required. So, if you have an HDMI port on your PC, dont worry your are good to go :) but if your like me and have DVI, read further. So the issue is this, when you plug a monitor into a PC/Mac/Whatever, it identifies it by a unique identifier. The problem is that your PC will see this TV as exactly what it is, a TV and try to push sound through HDMI. Thats fine if you have an HDMI port but if your using a DVI-HDMI adapter, more then likley your video card doesnt support passing sound through DVI.So your PC will refuse to use any other sound ports like RCA for instance. Now, this isnt Vizios fault and it isnt Nvidia or ATI's fault. Without this feature, your PC or DVD player, etc just wouldnt know how to communicate with your TV. So with that said, here is how you fix this. Understand that it is technical but if you follow the instructions or grab your neigborhood geek, youll be fine. We need to trick the PC into thinking the TV is really just a plain old monitor. By doing that, it no longer will try to push audio through HDMI and will use your RCA cable instead.Here is a link: [...]So despite some of the cons and nearly a year on this TV, its still the best computer monitor I have every owned and if the 1080P successor is any later, it may well be the best one ever.", "Date": "December 9, 2010"}, {"Title": "Great TV", "Author": "Bradley", "ReviewID": "R1PKZB4KYOMI3M", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This TV gives a fantastic picture and has more options than most TV's in this price range.

I wasn't disappointed when I finally was able to use it.Shortly after connecting the power cord and cable and powering it on, it prompts you to scan all the channels and it will tell you the amount of channels as well as how many of them are digital. This seemed like it took a while, but it's barely enough to make a mention in a review.After going through the settings, I was flipping channels and landed on the digital ABC channel showing the Rose Bowl between Oregon and Ohio State, and I was amazed at the picture. It was such an upgrade from a non HD 1080 TV, which is what I had before. A few weeks later I bought an HD XBOX 360, and again I was completely blown away. It really is a different experience, and I won't be able to go back to what I had before.The controller is a well made component, it feels like a good quality plastic with good weight. The buttons are well spaced, a good height and easy to press. The volume and channel buttons are unique and they work well  for their purpose.The sound is good; there's been no problem with the speakers and it sounds like a TV should. This TV wasn't bought for it's sound though, so the fact the sound isn't fantastic doesn't hurt my opinion of it. Overall this TV is a 5 star, a little overpriced I believe though.

They're still very functional, but shrill. I would not listen to music through them.-Not as many inputs as I would have liked. Only having one standard stereo input means I have to swap out my Wii, N64, and SNES.
