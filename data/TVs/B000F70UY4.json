{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Worth Every Penny!", "Author": "Joshua Bond \"Josh@mrbond.com\"", "ReviewID": "R2QK3G77LA32VP", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This is phenomenal tv. I searched for quite some time, looking also at the Pioneer and Samusung models which are in the 60 to 63 inch range. I found this one to be the clearest, crispest, sharpest, and brightest picture. I went to Circuit City to see it in person, as I hate buying a product site unseen.I am using a Comcast HDTV cable box with the DVR functionality. The HDTV channels look absolutely amazing, even when standing 1 foot from the set. UNBELIEVABLE. The normal (non-HD channels) also look very good. I noticed that normal channels also appear clearer and crisper than they did on other tv's. Not sure why that is exactly.I mounted the tv to the wall, using the Omnimount tiltable wall mount system. As long as you hit studs for all 4 lag bolts, it will hold just fine. I was a bit nervous about mounting 115 pounds on the wall but its held just fine.I am not a believer in over priced Monster cables. HDMI outputs are a digital signal--either it gets through or doesn't. It's not a sliding scale or progressive like an analog signal. I used the Philips HDMI cables  from Walmart for $20. The picture is absolutely crisp from the cable box and from the dvd. It looks as good as the display model did in Circuit City, so I can't see the point of paying $140 for monster cables.Whatever cable you choose, however, it will look good on this tv! You can't go wrong with this model!!Joshjosh@mrbond.com", "Date": "January 11, 2007"}, {"Title": "Excellent TV", "Author": "W. Patton", "ReviewID": "R3CI3OOIZLZ21K", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I researched dozens of tv's over the last few weeks and it is very difficult to determine in a store and online which tv has the best picture. Although money was a consideration my primary interest was screen size and quality of the picture. I primarily watch sports such as football, basketball and golf however we do like to watch our shows such as Lost, Heroes, etc... You know... the good ones that are in HD...Anyways, I was seriously looking at the 61\" Samsung DLP and the Mitsubishi 57\" DLP because you get more screen size for the buck and they are 1080P. My thought was that 1080P is the future and so I want to future proof my setup. Unfortunately 1080P plasma's were way to out of reach for my budget. I wasn't considering plasma's at first because I wasn't about to buy a 1080i/720p model however, I came across this model TH-58PX60U at Costco for $2300.00.How I made my decision was based on the refresh rates of action sports which I've concluded that Plasma is the only way to go...In stores, the DLP's seem pixelated and the screen couldn't keep up with the motion. I think if electronic stores want to sell more DLP tv's...they need to enhance their signal.I did buy an HDMI cable (rocketfish 4' for $65) for my Verizon FiOS HD DVR and hooked it up and I could tell a slight difference in quality vs. the component video feed. Now that I have it setup the picture is amazing. Here is what I tested:I tested late night drama's and the picture is super clear. I did get some football clips on ESPN sportcenter and the picture and clarity was exactly what I was hoping for. I started watching non HD broadcast and the picture is good...I was watching the Golf Channel and even though it is not broadcast in HD, the picture is very good. I am excited to see what it looks like on HD over the weekend.The price to value ratio for this particular tv is awesome! I am a little concerned still that I didn't buy the 1080P but it is way to expensive to keep up with technology. 2 Years ago this TV was over 5K and now it is less than half that. In the stores, I couldn't tell the difference between 1080P and 1080i/720P and although I am taking somewhat of a risk by going with the 1080i/720p I should be good to go for the next 5-7 years before I buy again. Besides, broadcast TV is only 1080i/720p and since that is what I predominately watch a 1080P TV isn't going to do me much good. Of course Blu-Ray and HD-DVD are out however, now that I blew my wad on this TV...it's going to be a while before I can get one of those...not too mention that they are going to have to come down in price to about $200-250 before I would consider them. I did test my DVD player and it was ok...We watched 'Cars' and there were absolutely no artifacts from the speed of the picture. It was clear and overall, I'm very happy.58\" Plasma for less than 2500 bucks...Wow! you can not go wrong...especially from Panasonic and their quality products that they put out...I would recommend this set to anyone.Another reason to buy from Costco is they extend the manufacturer's warranty by an additional year so you get 2 years for the price of one. And if you pick it up...not that heavy and the box is easy to manuveur because someone got smart and put handles in the box although you will need a truck...Anyways, hope this helps!", "Date": "July 6, 2007"}, {"Title": "One of my best purchases ever", "Author": "Mark Spicer \"Original Kings Fan\"", "ReviewID": "R56WAG3VDHI0W", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I've had this panel for a little over 2 months now and am still amazed at the quality of the picture.  I was upgrading from a traditional style (big box) rear projection HDTV and was definitely concernced that the picture would be better, but not enough so to justify the $3500 I paid.  I must say this is one of the best investments I've made in entertainment value.  I don't get to watch very much TV, but when I do have a few minutes to enjoy a show, sports game, or movie - I want to really enjoy it e.g. great visual and audio experience.  Part of the reason I don't watch much TV (aside from my 3 kids, busy job, and numerous other interests) is that the picture has always been dull, dark, without much life when compared to actually being outside and doing things.  A few years back I spent over $3800 on a new \"top of the line\" HDTV thinking it would be a whole new experience.  It was not.  The picture was certainly better, but it was still very one dimensional.  The color reproduction, contrast, and brightness wasn't lifelike and I was easily bored with what I was watching.  After looking at numerous Plasma TV's in electronics stores over the past several months I decided to give one a chance in my own home to see if the in store WOW factor translated to a real world experience in my own home.  For the first time ever watching TV, the experience is as close to actually being there as I've ever had.  The clarity, brightness, and vivid colors combine to create an almost 3 dimensional clarity.  I have mine mounted on the wall which really ads to the experience, like you're watching what's happening through a window.  It's a rare occasion when a piece of technology actually delivers on its promise.  This is one of those occasions.  I strongly recommend going and checking this panel out at your local store.  Sit in front of it for 10-15 minutes and you'll notice things you've never seen before while watching TV.  Good luck in your search for the right TV for you.  This was definitely the one for me!", "Date": "January 16, 2007"}, {"Title": "Excellent - Worth the extra $1200 over 50 inch TV", "Author": "Number 9 \"Number 9\"", "ReviewID": "R3J8VLJEIGL3OX", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "For me 50\" is a big TV and looks impressive, but at 58 its no more a TV its a mini Movie screen. Those last 8 inches makes a real difference.First I decided the reason I want a new TV is not to have a TV but have that movie feeling at home. So ruled out all below 50\" sets. 50\" looked like a Tv where as 58 gave that movie touch.100% of the available onair/cable channels and 99% of DVD's are not full HD there is no point spending $2K to $3K more for a 1080p set so 1080i / 720p is more than sufficient for next 5 years.60\" projection TV's looked nice then I was told that I will be spending atleast $1000 on bulgs to match the same life span of Plasma. Plasma's are durable. For commercial puposes every one goes with Plasma. The real drawback is Plasma consumes 3 times more power than LCD but 60\" LCD is about $8K++. And Good 60\" lcd projection TV's and this TV are in the same price range (give or take couple of hundred bucks). I think under $3.5K this is the best buy.Now for the real review. I dont have HD transmission on Dish Network. Regular channels looked better than on any normal Tube TV. So I can attest that for regular channels this TV looks excellent. DVD picture is also very very good. I haven't tried HD yet but will keep you posted as I get a HD antenna.One -ve I can fishout with difficulty is that the sound is less than stellar (Still way way bettern than my previous TubeTV) but on the other hand why spend $600 more for 600U while you can use that money on a home theator.", "Date": "December 20, 2006"}, {"Title": "BUY THIS TV!", "Author": "Joy Watanabe", "ReviewID": "R22IHTEXFX6EC9", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Before we bought this TV, my boyfriend and I spent the majority of our weekends looking at 50' plasmas since they're at practically every store we went into.  Very few stores had 58' Plasmas.  One day we saw it at a nearby electronics store and it was unbelievable!  Our family room had a 61' Projection TV in it so I started doing research on this plasma.  It is definitely worth every penny.  Do your research on every place that carries this TV - shop around and take in your lowest price to the store you like the most - chances are, they'll match the lowest price you found.  The markup on these TVs is outrageous.  The picture quality is perfecto!  We set up our HD tuner with our satellite dish and my boyfriend and I just stood in complete awe when we saw how awesome the picture was.  Bigger is better and you'll be extremely happy you spent the extra money on this 58' TV - it will definitely look bigger in your room than you anticipate.As a final note, there are 2 Panasonic Plasmas with almost similar model numbers.  This is the TH-58PX60U and the other one is the TH-58PX600U.  My friend got suckered into buying the TH-58PX600U and after looking at mine he said their was virtually NO difference.  The only main difference is that the 600U is HD cable ready with no box required and in order to get HD on the 60U, you need an actual box.  We have satellite service with a DVR so it made no sense to pay the extra $500.", "Date": "December 16, 2006"}, {"Title": "Panasonic TH58PX60U Plasma HDTV", "Author": "Jeffrey J. Wedinger", "ReviewID": "R1VELBCP7C94A", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I spent months reviewing the available HD Plasma televisions.  I finally settled on the Panasonic brand and have no regrets.  The picture is outstanding and better than any other TV I looked at.  Setting it up was easy.  I also added a Panasonic VCR/DVD unit (DMR-ES45VS with HDMI) and a Panasonic digital receiver (SA-XR57K) to complete my home theatre makeover.  With everything connected it's like being at the movies.  My experience with Amazon couldn't be better.  The orders were handled promptly and the items arrived earlier than estimated.  One real plus was the included \"white glove\" delivery service on the television.  The men were courteous and professional.  They unpacked the TV, attached the stand, placed it where I wanted it (it weighs 130 pounds), and took away all the packing material.If you are going to go with HDTV there are alternative technologies available.  LCD is good; but has viewing angle disadvantages.  DLP is also good.  Plasma however is the best and that view is supported by most experts (I read many reviews on the internet).  Plasma will cost a little more; but it's worth the money.One other recommendation is to use HDMI connections (cable box to the TV and to the DVD/VCR).  The cables afford the ideal transfer of the signals.  For sound use the digital optical audio cables to connect with your receiver.  Also, spend the money!  High quality cables (I used Monster) are worth it.  I sought the advice from an experienced electronic independent service person and he advised using good equipment.", "Date": "January 9, 2007"}, {"Title": "Problem Fixed Great Product", "Author": "J.

I ordered the tv Dec. 16 ,and it was at my door Dec 21. I saved  over $800,including the 4 year warranty.  I didn't pick the lowest price . I picked the Amazon price for a few dollars more. I decided what I wanted , and Amazon delivered in spades.  The TV is great. HDTV for a $40 hd antenna is a deal. The Panasonic TV s  ending in 600 are supposed to have a better sound system. Probably reccomended  if you don't have a surround  sound system ,and depending on your room size. 60 series is ok .

My conclusion was, based on prices today - PLASMA is the best value you can get per square inch viewing screen.  And in that category the TH-58PX60U is a total winner.  No other TV out there with this size and quality for this price.  VIZIO is not even an option when compared to this TV, quality and price wise!I got it last week, set up was a breeze and the picture is just amazing![...]Make sure that you have at least 10-12 feet viewing space from it.

While heavy during installation, there hasn't been any need to move it around after that, as there have been no defects. The only downside is the resolution for the size. While the HDTV experience is awesome, well, as good as it can when not displayed in 1080i/p, you will notice color blending when watching some of the older shows due to the size of this television. Burn-in happens quickly, so don't have Bloomberg on for more than 2 hours otherwise the stock ticker won't go away for 24 hours. So with all that said, I would purchase this unit again, especially now, given its price. This was my second Panasonic plasma purchase and since LCDs are getting cheaper, it will probably be my last plasma.

You can tweak all of the setting modes to your liking and I would suggest you do.  The THX mode setting seemed washed out and not useable to my liking.  No matter what settings I tried I could not produce a picture that I liked.  My custom mode settings and my tweaks on the other modes are terrific!  De-boxing and setup is very easy.
