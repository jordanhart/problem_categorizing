{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Great Television or Computer Monitor!", "Author": "William E. Beavers Jr.", "ReviewID": "R1F6MWC0IE3ILS", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I purchased this television as a computer monitor.  I wanted it because of the LCD backlight, built in speakers, and large screen, for a computer monitor.  When I purchased it my computer had not yet been built so I hooked it up to my cable box and WOW what a great picture!  Granted I was coming from an old CRT television but hey this thing was very impressive!  It is very customizable and can be set on preset settings as well.  It worked great to replace a 1981 circa Magnavox in my bedroom.  I used it for a couple of weeks as a television and when my computer came in I switched it to a computer monitor.  I had purchased an HDMI cable from AMAZON before my computer arrived.  Plugged in the HDMI cable and the power and keyboard and wal-la the picture came on with the sound!  No need to configure the system to set up, it just works!  Right out of the box.  Being an informed consumer I had read that you need to calibrate the screen.  Well when the monitor first came on I understood why.  Things seemed a little blurry.  I set the Veiwsonic to Computer and it helped but this was not yet the solution.  I then found in Windows 7 the clear type set up under the control panel and displays.  Once you configure to clear type this thing looks great!  It is like reading on a piece of paper!  Screens and videos look great!  I am running Windows 7 64-bit professional.  The high resolution high definition screen is very impressive!  For me the price was right because I have a computer monitor that can be a television if I want as well.  It has three HDMI connections so I can connect another computer, maybe a Mac Mini in the future, and later maybe an X-box 360!  You can easily switch with the touch sensitive controls or use the remote.  The colors and contrast are really incredible.  This television/monitor is a great deal for the money!  I caught mine at a good time to purchase because I got it for about twenty-five dollars under three-hundred dollars!  If you read these reviews often you will know why I wrote it like that.  It runs cool, comes on after a 5 second Viewsonic warm up screen, switches between sources easily, looks great and works like it is supposed to!  In short I like this monitor a lot!To me it rivals the Apple LED Cinema Display.  Notice I said rivals not as good as or surpasses!  This television is great!  It works as a monitor wonderfully!  Part of the reason I purchased it is due to the fact that I wanted built in speakers and an HDMI connection.  I did not want to have a video cable, power cord, speakers, speaker wire, and another power cord for the speakers forming a web on my desk.  This set up is clean and simple.  HDMI cable to the back of the computer to the monitor, then everything works.  One power cord for the monitor and one for the computer. Simple!  I compared it to the Apple Cinema Display because I was thinking of using one of these to connect to my PC.  Unfortunately you would need to by the Apple Mini Display video connector to HDMI conversion plug and pray that it would work.  I could never get assurances that you could get PC drivers for the camera and I did not find anyone that said that it worked when they connected to a PC.  Oh and also to buy the Apple you would need to cough up three times the money!  I know the Apple display is IPS has a glass screen (the Viewsonic has the plasticky laptop screen) and a built in video camera.  Still this does not make it worth nearly a thousand dollars!  I do wish that Viewsonic would place a glass screen on this television; it would move it up in class, and admittedly in cost.  I wish they would install a camera on the top of the screen, a good one, like the new ones from Logitech!  Then they would have a true Apple competitor!  When I looked around for a large screen, LED backlight, High definition monitor, with multiple HDMI connections, and built in speakers the Viewsonic television is the only one I could find this affordably.  This is the only monitor, or television, that came close to the Apple Display, and after purchasing it and using it as both a television and a monitor, I feel that it has lived up to its printed specifications and my expectations!  Buy one I think you will agree!One more thing; I purchased this through Amazon along with another item through J&R; Audio.  I had to return the other item after purchasing it.  I could not have had a better experience from the folks at J&R; Music.  They were kind, helpful, and did everything they said that they would do and even faster than they said they would do it.  It is rare these days to find a company that under promises and over delivers and I feel these folks did.  I am always leery of ordering from a reseller and these folks gave me confidence!", "Date": "July 26, 2010"}, {"Title": "Perfect small tv", "Author": "BM", "ReviewID": "R2R1FVZXGUMRHD", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I got this tv for my apartment bedroom at college, and it is great. Easily hooked up to my computer to watch movies, gets great hd local channels with an antenna.I would give it 5 stars, but the speakers don't sound that good. They are on the back, and therefore project sound backwards, but the tv has a headphone out, and was very easy to plug in some computer speakers that sound better.The remote has really handy buttons, including a cc on/off shortcut, and a channel list button, which shows available hd antenna channels in a handy on screen menu.The tv also looks amazing, very sleek.I love it :)", "Date": "August 13, 2010"}, {"Title": "Nice picture, menus are wanting, sound as previously reported is terrible.", "Author": "John C. O. Donnell \"Eclectophile\"", "ReviewID": "R3419FQ4ACLLUR", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I bought this TV to use as a secondary monitor and TV in my bedroom rather than have 2 screens cluttering it up.  I chose this one because it's an LED and the reviews were fairly promising.  So far I'm happy with the purchase but not blown away.  It does what I want it to do, for the most part.The first one I received worked brilliantly for the first day, then I turned it on the 2nd morning and it just cycled through the channel list without actually stopping or showing anything.  I was pretty disappointed but Amazon made it easy to return.  I printed up my label, the UPS guy showed up with a second box, I gave him my return box, and I was up and running again in about a week.  Not too bad I suppose.One observation.  I'm very supportive of Amazon wanting to be a green company but I really think that part of the reason my first TV had an issue is because they shipped the TV in the box it came in without any additional packaging.  So it got to me relatively banged up.  The second TV, still working after 2 weeks, came in a box with a hole punched in it.  Not promising.  The issue is that the box, as packaged is not sealed, it just has one of those foldy flap things in the center and if someone wanted to they could have easily gotten into the box and taken anything they wanted and there would have been zero evidence of tampering.  Spend a couple bucks guys, put these things in TV's with some bubble packing and spare yourself the returns.Picture.  The picture on this TV is actually pretty impressive.  Not as good as the 23\" Samsung LEDTV that I was originally looking at but definitely a very good picture with vibrant, but not surreal colors.  Straight out of the box the backlight is set at 50 percent and this is adequate for most rooms.  I use it in a room with a substantial amount of light in the day so I have mine set at 60 percent and it is very viewable.  Off axis viewing is acceptable from side to side and when viewed from above, when viewed from any kind of angle from below it's next to worthless.  I had it on a stand on my desk originally and an angle of as little as 30 degrees and you get that picture fade that makes it look like you're looking through a polarizing filter.  As long as you keep this in mind I think this TV is good for 90 percent of applications.Sound:  Sound quality is tinny and insufficient.  I knew this going into this unit.  I had a 2.0 set of computer speakers that I set up on either side of the TV, used the headphone output, and just cranked the volume on the computer speakers to max.  I can use my remote to control the volume, no problem, and it sounds great.Menus.  Menus are typical not great.  OSD is lacking and the type is much to small if you're any distance from the TV.  I like to watch TV in bed when going to bed and you can't read the type letting you know what's on and there's no option to increase the size of the type.  One thing that is really handy, since I don't have cable, is that when you hit the info button, it tells you the relative signal strength.  One thing that is terrible, unlike most HDTV's, this TV has no program guide.  The channel list provides just that, the channel list with station IDs.  When you hit on info you can find out what you're watching, but there's no way to look ahead to see what's going to be on any of the channels that are programmed in.  Even the old Sylvania ATSC tuner I bought 5 years ago has this ability.  Poor choices Viewsonic.  Channel changing takes a second or 2.  Leads me to suspect that they put in a less powerful CPU to control this TV, but it gets the job done and aside from losing the signal it hasn't frozen up or played audio that was out of synch yet.Remote is acceptable and does not need to be pointed directly at the TV.  All the frequently used buttons are immediately available and it only took a day or so to know where all the functions I wanted were by feel.  No complaints.  Touch controls on the TV itself are relatively sensitive and I have had no issues thus far.All in all I'd say that bang for your buck this is a very competent TV/monitor.  There are very few choices in this size that have all of the features that this one does.  Picture in picture would have been nice.  I would have like putting TV in the upper corner of the screen while using the rest of the screen as a desktop extension, but that's a little much to expect for 250 bucks.  the form factor is very nice and thin.  Not a fan of the silver base but that's just my personal preference.I would recommend this monitor based on the quality of the picture but realize that it has limitations.  Neither of the 2 that I received from Amazon had dead pixels so that speaks to the quality of the screen manufacturing at least.  A good choice for someone wanting the picture quality of an LED but not wanting to break the bank.", "Date": "September 18, 2010"}, {"Title": "Nice HDTV but still need some optimizations", "Author": "F.

Bought it from amazon at an unbeatable price, but super saver shipping took much more than a whole week to deliver.First let me say that this is a goog looking HDTV. It will catch the eye if standing on any desk. But in my honest opinion, it has two real defects that can be a deal breaker, so be aware.PROSNice Looking TVVery Light and thin.Plenty of inputs and outputs for the everyday use.VERY NICE AS A MONITOR (HDMI-DVI cable is the best choice)Easy to use and set up (assembly and setting up took less than 5 minutes including analog and digital channels from my local cable company)Space saver and versatile (I use it as a monitor for my bedroom desk and as TV at night)CONSFirst is the audio issue. This TV sounds like my grandfather's old transistor radio. There's no sign of low frecuencies and no matter how much tweaking you can do, you will end with a mid-hi tone that can be very annoying to some people like me. I hooked up a pair of good external speakers and problem solved!.Then is the angle-of-view issue. Horizontal view is almost perfect, but there is a mild loss of if you change your vertical angle of vision. So every time I want to watch TV from a point lower than my desk (like the bed), I have to tilt it down a bit in order to get the details of darker scenes instead of shadows.Start up time is around 5 seconds.Nevertheless I'm happy with my purchase. 4 stars rating for HDTV and shipping speed, but full 5 stars as a monitor.", "Date": "September 15, 2010"}, {"Title": "splendid monitor if viewer is seated directly in front of it", "Author": "briarsmith", "ReviewID": "R3GUDEAN9848OZ", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "This is an excellent monitor if you use the TV as a computer and sit directly in front of it with the screen at eye level.

I have been extremely impressed with the picture quality and the sound is OK (considering the small size of the speakers) as long as the SRS Trusurround feature is NOT used (this makes it sound very tinny).  The clarity of the picture is very good and the resolution is extremely good.  There are many video inputs available to be able to connect nearly any type of device that you might wish to use.  The remote operates as expected and the buttons are fairly well laid out.  Considering the low price through Amazon of less than $250 shipped, this TV is an exceptional value for a LED LCD that is 1080p capable.  I would highly reccommed this to anyone that will use in a medium to smaller sized room, and might end up using a set of computer speakers to make the sound a better quality.", "Date": "August 21, 2010"}, {"Title": "Great tv, great price!", "Author": "D.

It was the best price online, and the picture is very nice. Shipping was also very fast from the vendor. The only thing we did not like was that it was not packed inside a box for protection and privacy -- it arrived in its original brand box and left on my doorstep by UPS!

When I received the monitor and started reading it carefully, I realized why. Check it out: people who use this device as TV are very satisfied. People who try to use it as PC monitor have attitude \"whatever, it's ok. I  can live with it\" If you think about this as computer monitor, don't!!! It is not. The picture is horrible even after adjustments. It fails all calibration tests. You can adjust settings to make it average, but that's the most you can get. It cannot and should not be used as computer monitor. Nice little TV for small size root (I guess students and rental apartments are targeted here), but as computer monitor it is horrible as many of the reviewers have mentioned. Text is not crisp.

I'd like to disagree; maybe they had an outdated video card.I have a Dell Vostro 1310 laptop (3years old) and I bought this as an external display to convert the laptop into a Desktop. Picture quality is awesome, I get full 1920x1080 resolution display just using a plain old VGA cable. Great sharpness of image, absolutely no picture flaws that I can see (and I'm not a person who has low standards).I haven't tested the sound on it, but I wouldn't expect much since the speakers are on the back and look small. But the TV has a headphone jack and so one could buy their own set of speakers and plug it into the TV.I haven't used this as a TV yet. (just got the product 5 days ago, and I need to get an antennae). But I guess there's ample reviews here saying it works great as a TV. Just wanted to write this review since someone gave a rather convincing sounding review that the product is no good as a Monitor, and that had gotten me worried but I decided to take a gamble and am happy that I did; Therefore I wanted to let others in a similar situation know that I bought this primarily to use as a monitor, and it works amazingly great as a monitor, in spite of whatever written here stating otherwise./matt (2011 August 5th)===== Update August 7th, 2011 ======Again I shouldn't have believed all those people here who're the kind that buy a toyota pick up truck to haul a 52 foot trailer. For the size of the TV, the speakers are great - provides good sound in my bedroom even when the sound it left at a fourth of as high as it can get. I should have tested the speakers before believing the reviews and ordering an external speaker set -- now I have to sell that off when it comes. But yes, contrary to what anyone else says, the sound is great.Got a cheap antenna and tested the TV functionality out. HD channels look awesome on this TV. The older format channels look fine but not great; I guess it would be the case on any fullHD TV though - you're comparing that against the HD quality for one, and they don't have the resolution for your TV for the other.On other fronts, the TV stand that comes with it doesn't allow rotation on the vertical axes, but allows rotation on the horizontal axes - which is fine since you could just reposition the whole thing if you wanted to rotate on the vertical axes. I was really worried since I need a TV that can be tilted up/forward and down/backward since i need it primarily as a monitor - so happy on that front too. Assembly and use was a cakewalk, really happy about how user-friendly this is. I also liked the options on the remote.It also has a cool feature that if it's on computer input, and if I turn off the computer, the TV would turn off after 10 seconds. While this is expected, the cool thing is that, when I next turn on the computer, I don't have to turn on the TV again, it will sense the computer input becoming active and turn itself on.

I was looking for an LED monitor with decent speakers, HDMI, 1080p and a TV tuner - this is pretty much the only item that fits the bill, plus the price is right.PROS: Inexpensive, relatively loud speakers (for built-in ones), HDMI, bright display, HD tuner, good video playback.CONS: No bass in speakers, text is hard to read (not crisp), limited color controls, color saturation could be better.SUMMARY: While I don't love the monitor, the price was right and it does a decent job of meeting all my criteria.

Incredibly, the displayed aspect ratio does not automatically track the program content. Specifically, off-air HD programs (16x9) require manual selection of \"FULL\" while off-air std-def (4x3) programs require manual selection of \"NORMAL.\" Failure to manually select these settings to match the program aspect will mean a distorted picture.If you are going to use this TV only as a computer monitor or are feeding it from, say, DirecTV or Cable box this will probably not be an issue for you, because (at lease with my DTV HD boxes) aspect is controlled by the set top box. Using the internal ATSC Tuner for off-air, however, you will probably find this design flaw unacceptable.I called ViewSonic support for help on this and there was none. They acknowledged the problem but have no solution. Also, there is no apparent way for the user to update the firmware, assuming they ever do decide to correct this problem. There is no ethernet port and no mention of the possibility of future firmware updates on their site.I ended up returning the set to Amazon. ViewSonic really screwed the pooch on this tuner issue.

The base is nice and solid, I think it is aluminum.  The screen is super sharp even when not at the native resolution.  It adjusts to the computer resolution automatically.  This is a very efficient TV/Monitor.  I tested it with a kill-a-watt tester and it uses only 33 watts.  Strangely it stays at 33 watts no matter how low I set the brightness.  So you can adjust it to anything you like and the watts stay the same at 33.It is also pretty good as a TV.  I like how setting the screen to full will give you a full screen regardless of the channel.  I also like how it changes channels pretty fast.  I would say it is a better computer monitor than a TV, but it is a good TV also.  The sound is ok for me.  It is a good enough sound for a small TV.  Obviously if it were a big screen TV the expectations of sound would be greater, but for the size I am ok with it.  Unlike some reviewers, the sound levels are very flexible.  On level 1, I cannot even hear it.  Actually, at night a low level at 5-8 would be low enough not to bother anyone.  It gets loud too if you crank it, just not very much bass, even though I turned the bass all the way up on the settings.For a small TV/Computer Monitor, I think this cannot currently be beat.* Just a few things I forgot to mention= When changing the channel, the numbers showing the channel are so tiny, you literally have to get up and get within a few feet of the TV to see them.

It has 3 HDMI ports which make it be able to connect your PC, gaming console, hometheater suits and other HD output devices at the same time. Its picture is very nice compared to other TV at the same price, but honestly, it is not as good as Samsung, Sony and some other Japanese Brands. For a monitor, it performs great on video and game but not very well on text. Some previous reviews state its poor sound quailty and tiny volume, but I think it depends where you put/use it. I use it at college dorm and it works perfectly, its sound can be very loud if you turn the volume up to above 40%.  I believe it even fits for a very big living room if you turn up to 75% or above.

Using the VGA port, it is much worse than my 7-year old monitor. Using the HDMI port, the quality is even worse and text becomes painful to read. I spent two days trying to change the configuration (monitor settings, video card settings, and Windows 7 settings) and while some improvements can be made, the display quality is never good enough to be used as a computer monitor. From a close distance, text always appears grainy and aliased. This problem can be reduced a bit by lowering the \"sharpness\" setting on the monitor, but then the text becomes blurry.The HDMI port clearly was not designed to be connected to a computer video card. The VGA port seems to be an afterthought and barely works. It is surprising that the digital port (HDMI) provides even worse quality than the analog port (VGA).

On the soundtracks with lots of high hissing and tsking it can get really bad. Turn srs off and turn treble down a few dBs (default setting was +6 on mine).

Deluise \"Computer Geek\"", "ReviewID": "R3U3G48XIMJY1F", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "When I recently built a new PC I decided to treat myself to some new monitors as well.  I have a dual monitor PC system (dual output video card), but then my left-hand monitor is also the display for my PS3 and acts as an external display for my laptop via HDMI (obviously I don't use the laptop and PC at the same exact time).  The right-hand display is the extended monitor for the PC and is also connected to my Cable TV.  I was using the VT1900LED previously but decided to try to go a little bigger since I would be using my PS3 with these as well to save some space.Let me start by pointing out these are BIG.  23\" doesn't sound much bigger than 19\", but on my desk they look massive compared to the old screens (which is a good thing).  They do take up more space than I realized but this is a problem I didn't mind having.  A nice improvement over the VT1900LED by the way is that with this monitor you can adjust the viewing angle about 10-15 degrees up and down which you can't always do with an LED in this size range.First, the input via either HDMI or composite (I tested both) from my PS3 was amazing.  The picture is razor sharp, the blacks are \"black\" as they should be and the response time is excellent.  When connected via composite I did have to adjust the brightness a bit; it was surprisingly dark at first, but once that adjustment was made, it looked great.  I then connected the cable TV, and again, I was not disappointed.  When first setting up the unit, you have to walk-through a configuration wizard which will also begin scanning your channels to determine which ones you receive.  This is good and bad: The bad is you cannot use the unit until you complete the wizard so you have to make sure if you are going to use a cable/TV connection, connect it before you turn the device on.  Also, on one of the monitors I wasn't even using the tuner but had to wait for the wizard to attempt to scan anyway; there was no way to tell it to \"skip\" scanning so I had to wait for it to finish. Cable looked very good as well.  Hard to be a good judge here because I was not going through a cable box so my connection was essentially an analog RF connection, but it looked just as crisp as my 32\" Flat screen when connected the same way.Last step was to connect the PC.  After reading reviews here I was holding my breathe because I was expecting to possibly be let down.  However, far from it.  I connected my PC using DVI to analog VGA converters to connect to the VT2300's VGA inputs and pretty much right out of the gate everything looked great. Graphics looked fantastic and I started playing a movie and that looked amazing as well, however, I did have an issue with text looking blurry.  I played around with the monitor settings and tried a few things to correct this and nothing seemed to make a difference.  I then ran the \"monitor optimization wizard\" in the Windows 7 Control Panel and that made a huge difference with text now appearing much sharper.  After that, it looked just as good if not better than a regular monitor.  Curiously, when I connected my laptop via the HDMI port (my laptop has an HDMI out), that step was not necessary.  My laptop looked very sharp from the start.I am doing quite a bit with these monitors/TV's and expected to spend quite a bit of time fine tuning them to meet my needs.  When I turned the first one on and got past the wizard, I marveled at all of the options available for fine tuning the display properties and even discovered there is a way to create \"templates\" to save the settings you have adjusted to in case you want to go back and forth or switch settings for different uses/applications etc..  None of that was necessary and I wound up spending very little time in the menus making adjustments.  In fact, I am pretty sure I spent far more time in the menu trying to figure out how to adjust for Daylight Savings Time than I did trying to adjust picture quality.Last thing worth mentioning is sound/audio quality.  I generally have the sound down kind of low because these are used in a home office.  With that being said,  the sound appears \"decent\" to me.  The speakers are small though and like most Flat Screens in this size range, to keep the bezel size down, they mount the speakers just behind the screen and point them down.  Not an optimal configuration if you are an audiophile.  The monitor I have as the 2nd PC I only have cable TV coming out which is usually a background thing for me anyway so the sound is fine as is.  For the other display however, I connected a nice but inexpensive pair of computer speakers to the output and my PS3 and movies sound great.  People have complained about the audio from these in other reviews and for the most part they are right, but even my big living room flat screen is connected to external speakers, so to me I wasn't bothered.  Overall very impressed with the versatility of these screens and the price point made my purchase a home run for me.", "Date": "May 17, 2011"}, {"Title": "Samsung", "Author": "Bueno", "ReviewID": "R2LKB8ORGA60L8", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "ViewSonic is an great company but unfortunately for this product I need say - bad,bad,bad - worst colors that I saw already for an LED monitor.

What I don't like is the following:  (1) the info displayed when the info button is pressed on the remote control is in very small letters (very hard to read) and I have yet to find a way to increase the time that the info is displayed (not enough time to read the info), (2) I checked my favorites on the favorite menu and hid those channels that I wanted hidden on the hide/visible menu, but still snowy analog channel 11 keeps coming up when I want digital channel 11.1, (3) the literature suggests that a multiplexor should be used if a non-digital type antennae is being used, but when I emailed Viewsonic support, I, so far - it has been two weeks, have not received an answer as to what kind of mulitplexor I need.  The most annoying of the deficits is that when I want channel 11.1 and get channel 11, I have to move one up to get channel 11.1 and then the \"last\" button on the remote won't work for the previous channel.  I should have sent the tv back, but I have had it for a few weeks now, and rather than having to repackage the tv, I will keep it (at least the picture is good), put up with the annoyances, and buy a different brand in the future.  If, sometimes in the future, I get a response from the Viewsonic support person on how to remedy the discrepancies that I have listed, I will be more than happy to change this mostly negative review to a positive one.", "Date": "May 3, 2011"}, {"Title": "great", "Author": "kth46", "ReviewID": "R3D0SI8S2MBV4Y", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "the TV works great.

I was planning to use this mainly as a monitor, but I am going to return it this morning because the picture quality is terrible. Even at Full HD definition, when the monitor is plugged to my computer everything looks very bad. I tried to look for drivers, and I had no luck. Some drivers are available on Viewsonic website, but they are unsigned, and that makes it impossible to install them on a Windows 7 64 computer. I also tried a few different methods (found online) to install the drivers, but with no luck. That's why I am returning it.One more note: the touch buttons are terrible too, and it forced me to use the remote for even setting up the monitor. I also believe that it does not have an OFF button on the monitor, but I am not 100% sure because after 2 hours spent online to try to find a solution to the driver problem, and after 2 more hours spent playing with the settings, I decided to repack this junk!As other people said, also the audio quality sucks.
