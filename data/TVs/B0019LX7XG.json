I am a long time Sony fan but after looking at the various offerings in this size/class and comparing them to the LG there was one major thing that stood out, there was NO glare at all.  I have this TV in a room where there tends to be a lot of glare and the Sony I had in the room was terrible with reflections.  I went into a local store to see the 47LG70 and could not believe how well it dealt with glare from the lights in the store.  That sealed the deal for me.Excellent picture, pretty good sound but I rarely use the speakers on the TV and instead us my Sony sound system for everything (XBOX 360, Dish HD, Blueray, Apple TV, etc..) and lots of connections with HDMI.  Remote is fine and I really like the swivel stand.  A snap to setup and the picture quality with blueray (Iron Man looks fantastic!!) is truly amazing.You cannot go wrong with this unit.", "Date": "October 19, 2008"}, {"Title": "Excellent LCD", "Author": "Paul R", "ReviewID": "R3B5ZBTQV7DE35", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I recently purchased this TV from Fry's Electronics for about $1400.00 with tax. I have been waiting (for almost a year) for the Samsung 650 to drop below $2000 but finally decided to go with this LG. I could not believe the price of this television given it is 1080p and 120 hz. So far, I could not have made a better purchase. The sound is great and the picture is absolutely wonderful. I've been watching movies on Blu-ray and playing games on my Playstation 3. My jaw drops every time. The picture is really incredible. To be perfectly honest, I couldn't see a difference between this television, the Samsung 650/750 and the Sony XBR. Now that it is in my living room I have no regrets. It looks amazing!!!", "Date": "September 29, 2008"}, {"Title": "Full review of 47lg70 -4.5 stars-", "Author": "K. Krueger", "ReviewID": "RTLSA1A5LCXKD", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This is for SD content at a 16x9 ratio on this model as there is still so little true HD content available (over-the-air is still <10% 16x9).  DVDs upconverted to 1080i look incredible, with no noticeable artifacts and enabling settings/processing features don't detract from picture quality.  Over the air \"HD\" digital channels are not quite as good, but clear.  SD DirecTV varies but you get a slightly soft picture or else \"shimmer\" artifacts around the edges of moving things, most notable on faces.  Even so SD processing is as good as other brands.  Obviously the less processing devoted to stretching signals to match a 16x9 ratio the better here.  The two \"Expert\" (night/day) picture settings are the only ones that lessened SD artifacts.  On \"expert\" much tuning is needed to get the brightness/contrast, back-light, and advanced options balanced to your liking.  Color is very nice everywhere and blacks are great. In fact, when using Intelligent Sensor blacks and contrast can be too high, it works best for sunny/outdoor rooms (wish the I.S. had low/medium/high).  Perhaps a firmware update through the USB port can add this feature.  Even so, when using I.S. one \"lite\" options menu is still available to tweak some picture settings like black level, dynamic contrast, tru-motion, etc.  Tru-motion/120Hz gives new life to old TV programs but takes the romance out of many movies.  It's nice for documentaries/true stories but bad for fantasy/adventure.  S-Video processing in the set is of good quality and if you convert the s-video to HDMI through an upconverting DVD player the option to \"just scan\" is available for SD.  I'm glad I decided on the larger 47\".  When using \"just scan\" an extra inch of horizontal picture is revealed which shrinks the actual vertical picture to 17\" (but still 41\" wide!) for widescreen DVDs.  On a 42\" that is less than a 15\" high picture 37\" wide.  LG's S-IPS panel shines on viewing angle as well as colors.  Picture barely begins to darken at 45 degrees from center and only loses about 5% color and brightness to it's widest viewing angle of around 80 degrees. This is a wider viewing angle than all other LCDs.  Some I've seen begin to lose brightness in less than 30 degrees and half their picture is gone from 45-60 degrees off center.  The HD tuner is kind of weak.  My cheap-O Walmart 32\" Emerson receives perfect signals from my large attic antenna.  Using the same cable the LG cuts out on some D-TV stations and SD ones are grainy. Maybe a $15 booster will solve this?  SRS sound from the \"Frame speaker\" works well when a Dolby 5.1 signal is being received.  The surround effect is actually good enough that you think sounds are coming from beside you.  Clear-voice lowers all channels besides the center one.  I haven't needed it as the SRS is so good.  Auto-volume really works on this TV.  No more incredibly loud commercials:)  The anti-glare screen!  My 14'x5' picture window is finally open all day.  With a Sony or Samsung/(large)Toshiba in bright uncontrolled environments you get an expensive mirror.  The non-shiny Sharp/(small)Toshiba panels do not match the LG for beautiful picture, tuning options and features.  Still don't mind shiny?  Then get a plasma, their pictures are creamy and show the beauty of HD better.  LCD's main advantages over plasmas are a matte screen and lighter weight.  Why would anyone want a shiny LCD?  Looks wise, the bezel is thicker than some and reflective.  Although not too annoying, I may add anti glare monitor cover material over the side bezels to fix this.  Other brands advertise thinner panels, however, in person they all have a 12\" square power brick sticking out the back that makes them about equal.  After living with it a week I find the syle to be a contemporary design that will not look dated for many years.  Free white glove delivery through Pilot Air Freight was on time and smooth.  They unbox and place it for you so you can see it in good condition before you sign.  Prior to delivery I called their local number and the people were friendly and knew about my specific TV, amazing.  Bottom line, picture and contrast on this panel is good to great in any lighting conditions.  Get this set for the beautiful color and it's very wide, 'useable' 160 degree viewing angle.  Pricing is very good for the many high end features LG managed to put into this LCD viewing experience.", "Date": "December 13, 2008"}, {"Title": "Very good for the price.

Got the second one home and the faux chrome decorative piping at the bottom of the frame peeled right off when I (carefully) removed the protective plastic.  The picture is wonderful for most applications; it has excellent color and deep, rich blacks.  The standard audio and the surround-sound simulation are both very good.  I'm not entirely sold on the 120Hz feature, though.  Couldn't really notice any difference with it on or off while watching football or hockey in HD.  I guess plasma is still the king when it comes to fast-motion applications.  Still a very good buy.

When the Amazon delivery guy showed up, my jaw dropped at how big the 47 inch looked in our master bedroom.  That said this TV has some great features, with some calibration we were able to get some of our 720P Apple TV content to look exceptionally well. One caveat is that the picture with all the bells and whistles is almost TOO good when playing non HD content, so that sometimes shows look almost hyper real and more fake. We found that by making sure the True Cinema is off with non HD content, that solves the issue and when it is on with HD content, it truly is amazing. The blacks are extremely black and we found the calibration menus to be very easy to use. Also we had the White Glove Delivery and we were very pleased with that as well. All in all, with all the TVs we looked at before going with the LG, the LG seems to have the crispest colors and it \"Popped\" more then the other. We saw the 47LG50 at Best Buy and that picture looked miles above even the most expensive TV they had on display and the 47LG70 is even better then that.

Riley", "ReviewID": "RDOZOMGQGYKYB", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I got this TV recently and couldn't find that much on the internet about it in terms of reviews, so I want to share my experience. I had previously owned a 720p LG and bought the Samsung LN46A550 because of a great deal and great reviews. Once I got the Samsung I was happy, but when I spend over a grand on something I need to be ecstatic. So... since I was in the window to take the TV back, I did some research. I came to where there were two TVs in my price range that I was interested in, the Samsung LN46A650 and this TV. I went with this TV because the Samsung seemed to have more issues based on online posts (AVS Forums) and the picture looked a bit better to me in the store. So... here is my review:Setup: I had heard that with this TV you have to attach the stand, but you don't. Its with the smaller models I believe, but this one is was new out of the box and the stand was attached. It was as easy as it should be (instructions are included on how to detach the stand).Look: It has a really classy look. There is a dim light that's red when its off and blue when it's on in the bottom right of the frame, but you can turn it off if you don't like it (I like it). There is red on the trim, but I haven't noticed it since I set it up. I really like that the input/channel/vol buttons are basically touch sensitive.Audio: What you would expect from an LCD. Not that great, but not bad. In my opinion you shouldn't be using the TVs sound if you're going to spend this much on a TV unless you have to... but that's my opinion. I've got mine running through my 5.1.Picture: WOW! HD looks stunning! The contrast compared to the Samsung 550 series is incredible. Blu-Ray is absolutely beautiful. If you like things simple, you can just use one of their many preset options. Plus, the TV does pretty well with the intellisensor. However, if you are a complete videophile, you can calibrate it with the expert setting and control many things (search for this model in the AVS Forum and you can get different people's calibration settings to try if you want to go more in depth). I'm not totally into the Trumotion (its good with sports and a few movies), but turning it off is easy enough. I will tell you though, when you watch true HD content (not just stuff on the HD channels, but the stuff recorded for the HD channels... usually the newer stuff), the picture is hard to beat. The blacks are about 9/10 (compared to other HDTVs), but the colors are 10/10... easy. Standard-def looks about the same as the 550, but not bad enough to make me like this TV any less.CONS: (because everything has them)1. The remote is horrid. If you're going to sell such a great item... spend some time on the remote! However, it doesn't matter to me because I use the Harmony universal remote. Don't have one? Check them out... mine is a cheaper one and I could never ever go back. I can't imagine what he expensive ones are like.2. This isn't much of a con for me, but it would be for some; when you change inputs it takes about 2-3 seconds to come up to that input and another second for the sound.3. The side inputs aren't 100% on the side. They are a bit further back than most TVs have them. However, not too big a deal if you ask me.4. You have to enter settings to turn on/off Trumotion. As I said, there are a few things that it works great with... wish the remote could turn it on/off so I could program my Harmony to do it.That's it... all my cons...I strongly recommend the 47LG70 vs the Samsung A550 or A650 series... well I just recommend it overall. I mean, even the settings menu is pretty. Plus, my last LG shows me that this brand is reliable. It kept going and going and never died... not even after several years and many moves (I'm in the Navy and move a lot). If you have questions check out AVS Forums and search for this TV. It's free and someone on there will answer your question.

It appears to be in 3D most of the time. People and objects appear to jump out at you. I believe this is due to the rich colors/vibrant colors and deep blacks. Also, there's absolutely no glare.  I am not totally confidence that the 120Hz feature really makes a big difference. I'll give it some credit though - it's 25-30% better than without the feature. You will not notice this unless you watch motion movies or sports. I like the Intelligent Sensor. It appears to adjust to the environment - I am still trying to figure that out. LG has very good features, but you will have to read up on a few of them. Everyone else is correct, the sound is not great. Mine runs thru a stereo, so no big deal.Overall, if someone makes a better 47\" LCD, I would be shocked.

Read that the Vizios 120Hz mode left something to desire. Got this LG for $1399 which is an incredible deal for this TV, actually same as the Vizio. 120Hz is great for viewing broadcast, when watching DVD it makes the picture funky.

The USB in is a great little feature, just plug your usb drive or camera in and do a slideshow while playing your favorite music, great when entertaining guests!Menu is easy to navigate.

The picture quality is fantastic in HD and the colors really pop.  The black levels could be better and if you have this tv on a shorter stand, the colors tend to wash out when your vantage point is looking down on the tv (standing up).  The TV really needs to be at eye level or above to avoid the washing out.  Also, you NEED to calibrate this TV. I had it for two months before I found calibration settings online, and WOW what a difference it made. You will get so much more out of this TV if you have it calibrated correctly.  I like the matted screen because it reduces glare to almost nonexistent; however you lose a little clarity in dark scenes compared to other LCD's. I previously owned a Samsung 750 and returned it because it had so much glare...but the darks scenes were very clear.  I prefer not having the glare with my LG; it's a tradeoff.  All in all, i reccomend this TV because the picture quality rivals that of other higher end LCD's, but the price doesn't.  Of course there are some drawbacks, but if you are willing accept those drawbacks, you'll save some money and still get a high quality TV.", "Date": "April 14, 2009"}, {"Title": "Hell of a bargain", "Author": "SteveS \"Steve\"", "ReviewID": "RW5LUAIMSK24P", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I'm really impressed with this TV so far.  I've only had it for about a week so I can't speak to long term reliability, but otherwise I'm impressed.  The picture quality is on par with a really nice Samsung 42\" I had previously.  It also has the advantage of being a few inches bigger.The menus are easy to use, and the quick menu feature really helps to switch picture modes.  This becomes important because you'll want to be able to turn off TruMotion for movies, and turn it on for games.TruMotion tries to smooth out video and it works wonderfully in games (highly recommend this as a gaming TV), but in movies it has the effect of making things move rather oddly, seeming to move too fast somehow.  It's hard to explain the effect but if you get one you'll know what I mean.  Honestly I'm not sure it's bad, it just looks wrong to me so I turn it off.The other thing worth mentioning is that unlike some flat panels I've seen, the screen has a more matte finish.  This is a god send for me as I have the TV in a room that gets a lot of sunlight.  It takes the edge off the glare and makes the TV far more usable in non-ideal lighting.I kept trying to find something wrong with it but so far the only problem I've found is one slightly dead pixel.  It shows up green but only if you're sitting way off to one side and it's in a far corner.  So in the grand scheme a very minor defect.

This was my first HD TV and I previously had a 32 inch 11 year-old SDTV.  The upgrade to a 47 inch screen was amazing, not to mention the superior clarity and detail on movies, sports and network TV shows.  I saw a Celtics basketball game on their parquet floor and I have never seen it look like that!The best features of this TV are:1) Screen size.  We sit about 6-7 feet from the TV and 47 inches is perfect and does not overwhelm the room.2) Thin screen.  We put the TV much closer to the wall than our old RCA clunker with the huge back.3) Swivel screen.  This is a great feature!  Our rec room has a long couch that faces the TV straight-on and a recliner about 4-5 feet to the side.  We can angle the screen between us without any perceivable change in size or picture quality.  The advantage is you do not have to re-arrange your furniture to optimize your view, just turn the screen to face where you are sitting.4) Glare reduction.  We have a basement rec room that gets no direct sunlight, but we do have several lamps.  Before we turn on the TV, we can see the glare on the screen from the light on the end table. After turning the TV on, you don't notice any glare whatsoever.  This model LG comes with a feature that automatically adjusts the brightness of the picture based on the amount of light in the room.  We shopped for plasmas in our local electronics store and the glare was a huge distraction.  You will not have that issue with this TV - it is a must if you are going to use it in a room that gets substantial sunlight.5) 120 hz refresh rate.  This was the biggest decision we faced since this feature adds about $300 to the price.  We are huge sports fans and were afraid of \"pixilization\" during fast-moving sequences.  I am happy to report that the picture quality is outstanding while watching football, basketball, Winter X Games, etc.  We tend to keep things a long time so we were willing to spend extra for this technology.The one negative I have to point out is the sound quality.  On some movies and tv shows, the sound is tinny and vibrates like the speaker at an old drive-in movie or fast food drive-through.  It's not quite that bad, but it is noticible and distracting.  I would expect better sound for a TV of this price but I guess this is a common complaint since many people purchase sound bars or surround sound speakers.  I'm sure we'll get those eventually, but for now it will do.Overall, I feel like my 4 months of research paid off and this LG LCD gave me the bang for my buck that I was looking for.

I was trying to look for a good black Friday sale on a 120mhz LCD.  I went and checked out so many LCDs and saw this one which I loved.  Well after looking around for the sales and deals, nothing came close to Amazon's price, which included free white glove delivery and no tax, so my total price was $1380.TV arrived on time and the delivery guy even took it up stairs and unpacked it and hooked it up so I could test it to make sure it was working fine.  Setup was a breeze and watching my HD Uverse and my upscale DVD, both on 1080i, is such a blast.  I don't have a Blu-Ray, so I could not tell you how it looks on 1080p yet but I have seen how it looks at the stores playing Blu-Ray and it looks great!  I can't tell you how great the picture is, you have to see to believe.  Do what I did, go to a Best Buy, Fry's, or any electronic store and look at the picture yourself.  The great thing about that is you can do a side by side with other models and brands.  I also have a PC hooked up to it and using it as a monitor and playing games on it via the computer looks great.  Movies played off of the computer or streamed from the internet look great as well.  The LCD has 4 HDMI connections which is a great feature to have.  To me the build-in sound is good.  I have it in the media/game room and it sounds just fine without any hook extra hook ups.  When I have people over, I'll turn on the surround sound on to feel the movies but for everyday watching, the build-in sound is great. Many of my friends that come over comment on how nice and true to life the picture quality looks.  These are people with other LCD like Samsung, Panasonic, Toshiba, and Sony.  Their LCD/Plasmas range from 42-50 from 60-120mhz.  It's nice to know that they think your LCD looks good.  Glare is not an issue with this LCD.  Others I had seen at the stores had a bad glare from the lights of the store and this one did not at all.Like I said before, I had shopped for many months looking and playing around with different LCDs and Plasmas, looking and picture quality, features, price, etc.  This LCD stood out in my top 5.  The price offered on Amazon sealed the deal for me.This is by far the best LCD for the price.

My friend just bought a new Samsung, LCD 52 inch, and has it hooked up to Direct TV HD.  The other night he stated that his HD was not as clear as my Dish TV HD. You should have seen his face when I told him that I do not have HD.  I am always getting comments on how clear the picture is.  The best feature's are the Aspect Ratio; this sets the screen to the signal feed automatically or you can adjust it yourself.  Picture Mode; This mode has Intelligent Sensor as well as other choice's.  The Intelligent Sensor adjust the quality of the picture in different lighting conditions.  Our LG is set up in a room with large windows with Southern exposure.  No matter what the light condition is the screen stays the same.  Oh yeah, No glare!!!!!!If you are not sure what to buy.  Stop your looking and buy this unit.  You will not be sorry.  The one only draw back is that it only has one Composite (RCA) Connection.  But is does have plenty of other inputs that you may  never use or need.", "Date": "December 26, 2009"}, {"Title": "Love this TV", "Author": "LCS", "ReviewID": "R3CDEJW5HZN18G", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I needed a matte screen for my sunny living room, so it was between this and the Sony.  The LG had a stand that turned (limited turn radius, but beter than nothing), one diagonal inch more, and was a few hundred $$ cheaper, so that decided it.  It's been four months and I love this tv.  Caveat: you need to get HD service.  For the first month, I had my old non-HD cable programming and it was hardly watchable on this big a TV, it was all pixelly.  Once I got DirecTV with HD, I can watch both the HD channels (gorgeous!) and the standard def. just fine on this big TV.  So if you're investing in this big a TV, go ahead and invest in the extra $20/month for HD programming, and you're all set.

I took a look at the models I was thinking about buying at the local Best Buy. They all looked pretty good, but the picture on the LG just looked a little better (maybe it was my imagination). Anyway, until I saw the models in the shop I was favoring the Samsung, but after seeing the LG working I opted for it.The TV was easy to set up and looks great. The various mode settings (Cinema, Sports, etc.) do seem to be effective. I've watched some Blue Ray films and the picture is just amazing.I have to confess, this is my first HDTV and I previously watched everything on a 28\" tube TV, so I certainly wouldn't call myself and expert.

The zoom 1 has to be used to enlarge the picture, and that cuts out part of the picture. There is such a waste of the screen when you watch a picture in 16:9 ratio.Also, the clarity of the picture is bad on some channels. I get a motion delay when things happen, like a hesitation or shadow behind it. The colors in some channels shows green/blue lines in certain areas. I have called an LG service dealer, and they thought some may be due the cable providers signal being supplied. I am waiting to see if the digital transistion will make it better. If it does not I will be taking the tv back for warranty work or a replacment. I have been somewhat dissatisfied with the product so far.
