The only reason I didn't give it a five star is because of the sound from the speakers. It is fine for a bedroom (which is where we use it) but not if you want to use it someplace different. Great picture and great quality. I would recommend it to anyone for the price.", "Date": "May 28, 2011"}, {"Title": "Good LED picture, bad sound", "Author": "J. Watson", "ReviewID": "R18EEPGSF3KGAO", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "If you always (and I mean for everything) run external speakers, the sound won't be an issue. But if you're like me and want to use external surround sound just for watching movies or your favorite action TV series, but feel it's overkill for every day viewing, this may not be the TV- it reminds me of the old tin a.m. radio on my dad's workbench in the garage. I don't want to run surround sound for news, talk shows and regular sitcoms, but this TV sounds so bad that the speakers just are not adequate for every day viewing or for watching movies. I returned it and bought a Sony Bravia 1080 LCD. The extra inch or two in thickness was an acceptable payoff for the vastly better sound quality.. And the LCD picture is just as good if not better.", "Date": "November 10, 2011"}, {"Title": "excelente", "Author": "darwin guatarasma", "ReviewID": "R1I2EBSO6JPXJK", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "muy buen producto, cumple con mis expectativas y requerimientos, producto llego a tiempo y en excelentes condiciones por parte del vendedor, se los recomiendo para futuras compras.", "Date": "January 14, 2013"}, {"Title": "Better than expected!", "Author": "H. Heuser", "ReviewID": "R15UR9JET9CGCX", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "We purchased this last year for the family for Christmas - our first flatscreen television! It is wonderful. The picture quality is excellent. We had extended family over for Christmas and my brother, an engineer who spent about eight months researching before he bought his last flat screen television, said the picture quality was better than his. We are very happy with it.There is one thing that is a bit of a glitch though - the picture size changes mid-way through movies. We just re-set it to whatever size we want, and it's not a big deal for us, but it can be a little annoying.For the price we are extremely pleased with the quality of this television and would purchase a Toshiba electronic again.", "Date": "November 28, 2011"}, {"Title": "Incredible image for a great price", "Author": "Jarc", "ReviewID": "RJYNPTQSOUOCW", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I was affraid about this shop, because it was my firts hdtv, I get it about time, and the picture quality is amazing, good sound system, and looks great mounting in my bedroom wall.
