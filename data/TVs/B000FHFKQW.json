Want to watch a movie on your progressive scan DVD player?  \"Not Supported Mode.\"  Want to connect an HD cable box using HDMI/DVI?  \"Not Supported Mode.\"  Have an Xbox 360 that you want to use as a DVD player?  \"Not Supported Mode.\"  Ugh.  I am so sick of the screen going black with a pop-up box saying \"Not Supported Mode\" that this TV is going back from whence it came.I've tried fiddling with different hook-ups and cables for almost a week now and have had no luck.  I can hook up the HD cable box with component connections, but not HDMI/DVI.  I can play games on my Xbox 360, but can't watch DVDs on it.  I can use an old 480i DVD player and it will work fine, but my newer progressive scan will not.  All of these work fine on the 2 other (older) HDTV's I've tried them on, so it's nothing on my end, it's the TV.  The only reason it gets 2 stars is because the picture is nice.  But I can't justify $700 for a TV that isn't compatible with high end gear.

Thus, my experience only concerns this model running at 480p for a game console.I'm quite happy with my purchase. Setup was easy, the screen is bright and clear, and the speakers are surprisingly powerful. The TV includes a \"game mode,\" that is supposedly optimized for console use. (The actual adjustments made are unexplained.) There are also a number of brightness modes for different ambient light levels.The odd reviews for this product put me off initially, but several of them seem somewhat out of place. That is, they seem to be reviews of the shipping company or of Samsung's warranty service, which may be isolated incidents. If you're planning on using the LN-S2341W for HDTV, I encourage you to view other reviews or check out the product in a brick and mortar store.As a final note for other Wii users, there is a slight groove at the top of the screen that is perfectly sized for the Wii sensor bar.", "Date": "November 21, 2006"}, {"Title": "Superb LCD TV for Xbox 360, PC, Upconvert DVD HDMI", "Author": "Roy Basilisk", "ReviewID": "RJI7DU2JEFX3U", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This is a superb and affordable 720p/1080i capable widescreen HDTV for close-quarters movie playing and next-gen (360, etc) gaming.  As well, I have also decided to use this room's PC on the TV, plug VGA in and it auto-adjusted to an ultra-crisp widescreen 1360x768 pixels.I am using HDMI w/an upconvert (720p best on this TV) DVD player, the aforementioned VGA connection, and Xbox 360 (720p as well) through Component 1.  Everything looks incredible.One caveat is that it is indeed TRUE that 480p component on both PS2 and 360 would only work with some DVDs.  The \"Cars\" DVD for example would not play visuals (audio comes through) on either machine at 480p, though I could turn off progressive on the PS2 and it would then play in 480i without a hitch.This model is thus not recommended only if you must rely on these videogame machines to play your DVDs at 480p via component.

No degradation in picture quality and zero issues.Update: I've had this for over a year and a half now. My better half runs it daily for hours and it's still going like a champ. Looks great and no problems. I now have 4 Samsung LCD's in my house and have not been disappointed by a single one. In fact, we now have Samsung Blu-ray DVD player, refrigerator, washer and dryer. She calls it 'the house of Samsung', but hey, they make a great product and I can buy most of them on Amazon.----------------------------------------I liked the Samsung LNS4692D 46\" LCD I bought on Amazon so much that I purchased this little unit for my guest room.This is a little brother to the 46\" with similar features/capabilities. Of course, not quite as good contrast ratio and some other minor specs, but as I mentioned in my review on the 46\" unit, I personally can't tell the difference (and you probably won't either unless you are in a perfectly dark room with zero reflection off any other surfaces).Great looks, easily mounted to wall, and unlike some other folks, no problems with using any device whether it be component running progressive (my DVD player) or HDMI. Those issues sound like user error or perhaps something wrong with that particular set.Compare the specs and features with others in this size and price range. You'll find this is a great value. My second Samsung LCD and no regrets yet.The free shipping (which was prompt) and the assurance that I bought from Amazon so the warranty is honored by Samsung were deciding factors for me to order here.Be careful - other sites selling cheap LCDs, Plasmas, electronics many times are NOT authorized dealers of what they are selling so most manufacturers will NOT honor the warranty - period. And, if they offer their own warranty, you had better hope the little guy is still in business when you need them and they actually do something about it. I say this because I was burned a couple years ago trying to save a few extra bucks.

I use an HDMI cable to hook my HD STB and that looks great also.  The picture is great at all resolutions except when hooked up to analog cable, then there is a lot fuzz. My only real gripe is that there is NO audio out. I think that is something that all TV's should have.

However, the volume and sound system on this television is very poor.  You have to turn volume up to 75 (out of 100) just to get an adequate volume for the program you are watching.  I called Samsung about this and we went over all the adjustments, wires, etc and that is just the way the television is (I am told).Another major problem for you gamers out there is the volume.  When you switch the television over to your gaming system, you better not have the volume set higher then 15 or you will blow your windows out!Samsung has designed a nice, economical television for the LCD-HDTV beginner but, the volume issue is inexcusable and I certainly know what to look for next television I purchase.

The onscreen channel numbers are very small and hard to read at a distance.  I have found no way to increase font size.

It does not have audio out. You can defeat that by hooking up your cable box to your Home Theater System.

I have an XBOX 360 connected and the games are beautiful. There is a problem watching XBOX 360 dvd on the LCD but I use the xbox for gaming.

But I have been hearing really good things about Samsung's line of TV and the contrast ratio of 3000:1 on this TV made me pull the trigger.I am just very disappointed because the complaint about the \"Not supported mode\" is very true.  It appears that this TV doesn't like to support progressive scan from a progressive scan DVD player.  It does fine with HDTV signals which are currently at 720p or 1080i but half of my use of this TV is to watch DVDs on a progressive scan dvd player.  Yes, I can still watch DVDs by disabling the progressive mode of the DVD and watching it in 480i.  But that's like going backwards 5 years.And the thing about Xbox 360 makes perfect sense.  If you are playing games on it, you are most likely in HD mode so it works, but if you are trying to watch a DVD, then you are in progressive scan mode (480p) so it doesn't work.  I am just deeply disappointed in Samsung that they failed me like this on my very first Samsung purchase.  This is a basic mode that they overlooked.  Who knows what might go wrong next?  This TV is going back to the store.The TV itself is very nice actually.  Nice sleek look, great picture from HD signals, but it still left a really bad taste in my mouth that Samsung couldn't get one of the most basic things right.An update.  If I could rate Samsung's Tech support, I would give it 0 stars.  I called them up on this issue and was hung up on twice while in the process of going to higher level of support (which I am beginning to guess is their way of hanging up on people).", "Date": "December 29, 2006"}, {"Title": "love it!", "Author": "Eduardo Escobedo Jr.", "ReviewID": "R1UV30FSMLW8ES", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "this was my first flatscreen/hdtv...its been really reliable, great tv, i dont understand all the other reviews about it not supporting alot of their other devices....i have hooked up alot of things to it n it all worked perfectly, it has such a clear picture...the only downside which i wish i had been better informed of when i bought it is that it does not have an atsc(digital) tuner, it only has an analog tuner...but other than that its a great tv", "Date": "May 21, 2008"}, {"Title": "Don't call customer service", "Author": "R.

On Feb 13, took it to the repair shop for warranty repair.  Was told after 5 days, that the part that it needed was no longer available.  And that they would send me a  replacement TV.  The TV was a 2005 model, manufactured in 3/2006.  Was asked to fax my receipt.  Samsung gets my receipt and says that it is to blurred to read.  Have spent hours on hold trying to get to their customer support about the TV.  I feel that since I have called several times to try to get some answers that Samsung is recognizing my name or case number  and just ignoring my being on hold.  Yesterday was on hold for an hour and a half with music playing in my ear.  Monday, I will fax them an 8X10 copy of my receipt that I hope will not be too blurred to read.  So things are still up in the air.  Was getting the TV for a bedroom, and had plans to buy a 40 inch soon.  No way, will I buy it from a Samsung dealer.  With all this calling and waiting, my 30 day return policy has passed and I stuck having to make payments on it. I had the TV for about 10 days, and even though it was my first LCD type TV , had to learn about it.  I could not turn it on or off, except with the remote.  Neither did the controls on the side work.  So I can not give any opinion about picture quality or anything..........just want them to send my replacement TV.  So beware of needing any repair while in warranty.  And if your TV is not working as it should, take it back and do it quickly, and forget about having any warranty work done.
