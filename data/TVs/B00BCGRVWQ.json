{"Reviews": [{"Title": "So far everything is nearly perfect", "Author": "Charles S. Yordy III \"Charlie\"", "ReviewID": "R3ZLRLTGVVX9Q", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Just got this last night at a big box store.  So far I have no complaints.  The picture looks even better in my home than it did at the store, where the contrast and vibrancy of colors \"popped\" far more than comparable models around it.  This TV replaces a Samsung LN32A450 32-Inch, bought end of 2008, and is our main living room TV.Pros:  Seems like the the best 1080p LED Smart TV at its size for the money; love the picture; the speakers are completely satisfactory for our purposes (seem a good bit stronger than the old TV); the Smart features are very cool and so far work great, but we've only started messing with them; 3 HDMI ports make it easy to connect cable, game system, and any other device we may acquire in the future.Cons:  using the remote for web browsing or apps isn't the best, but we may just get a wireless keyboard and mouse to go with this - already tested a Logitech wireless USB mouse with it and it works perfectly; watched 3 consecutive Youtube videos without incident, but it had trouble loading a 4th...I've read that the wireless card can struggle, so we'll see how that is over the long term; accessing Game Mode requires three steps through the menus, but it doesn't take too long using a wireless mouse, and I think it switched off Game Mode automatically when we deactivated the console and went back to cable.Overall:  After 1 day it easily gets an A+.  If problems develop with anything I'll update my review.Also, I used the following website to set these calibration settings - really like the picture with these:  [...]Post Calibration SettingsPicture Mode MovieBacklight 16Contrast 97Brightness 48Sharpness 0Color 51Tint G50/R50ADVANCE SETTINGSDynamic Contrast OffBlack Tone OffFlesh Tone 0RGB Only Mode OffColor Space AutoGamma +1PICTURE OPTIONSColor Tone Warm2Size Screen FitDigital Noise Filter OffMPEG Noise Filter OffHDMI Black Level LowFilm Mode OffLED Clear Motion OffWHITE BALANCESetting ValueR-Offset 25G-Offset 25B-Offset 27R-Gain 19G-Gain 22B-Gain 21", "Date": "July 3, 2013"}, {"Title": "Excellent picture AND sound, software needs some improvement", "Author": "Goldengate \"Goldengate\"", "ReviewID": "R1ORMAYO1DJYD6", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "NOTE: Scroll to bottom of review to read 2014 updates -- I am returning this TV.This TV was released in February as Samsung's \"budget\" 32-inch  As of this writing it's going for around $475, so about $200 more than the budget Smart TV's from Vizio.  First my review of the TV, then I'll compare it to Vizio's product VIZIO E320i-A0 32-inch 720p 60Hz LED Smart HDTV, which I have also purchased and decided to return in favor of this unit.  As you would expect, the TV has a great picture. Smooth, no pixelation, even sports look great on here.  It's advertised as a 60hz -- but then the box refers to \"120 Tru Motion\" so I'm not sure what to make of that, but suffice it to say that refresh rates are good.  The remote control is decent - lights up at night and has good sized buttons, but I'd like dedicated buttons for Netflix and Amazon VOD.  This TV begins to blur the line between TV and computer... the internet browser is competent, but pretty frustrating to use without a keyboard.  You can hook up a USB keyboard through the TV's slot.  This TV does NOT accommodate bluetooth keyboards, so wireless is out of the picture.  I believe the next model up of Samsung (the 6000 series) accommodates Bluetooth as that is referenced in the manual.  The \"Smart Apps\" section reveals many apps (Pandora, Picasa, etc) that you would find on your Smartphone.  Due to the dual core of the TV's processor, apps load quickly and the TV starts immediately.  As for the sound, it's really decent to good.  You're not ever going to get good base etc without an external sound source on any HDTV... but this provides a good viewing experience.  Figuring out the DLNA networking (to watch videos and pictures stored on my computer) was unnecessarily complex (very simple on the Vizio).  The TV couldn't \"see\" other devices on the home network until I clicked \"Play to\" on the computer in the right click context menu and selected the Samsung.  The Samsung asked for permission to link to the computer and then I was able to browse.  I'm sure this will be fixed in a future software update.  By the way, Netflix, Amazon, every app I have tried works great.I think the software on these \"smart TV's\" is still overly complex to navigate... At some point a company like Apple is going to figure this out and make a truly seamless intuitive experience.  For example, to get to my media on my computer, I have to click \"smart apps\" then scroll to video, click that, then select a source, then start scrolling through files on the computer.  There has to be a better way.  Having said that, it's not terrible, and the dual core makes for gorgeous animated menus and really nice response time.Comparing it to the Vizio... if you are thinking \"Should I spend the $200 more for the Samsung?\" here's why I ended up returning the Vizio in comparison to this unit.  First off the positives: The Vizio had a gorgeous picture also, comparable to the Samsung.  So it's a draw between the devices.  But in every other aspect, Samsung wins.  Setup on the Samsung was a breeze -- it scanned all of my Comcast digital channels WITHOUT a converter box, and then automatically subtracted out the scrambled channels.  Vizio couldn't/didn't do this.  Samsung also has an interactive/nice guide much like the guide you'd see on digital TV/satellite... grid format that tells you what's on all the channels.  Vizio didn't have that.  The Vizio TV took 5-9 seconds to start.  That's a long time when you're trying to catch the end of a show.  Samsung starts up instantaneously.  The Vizio had TERRIBLE sound -- everyone sounded like they had a lisp when watching TV... the Samsung has a million sound options including even an equalizer.  Great sound.  There are many more apps on Samsung's unit, and there's also the Samsung version of video on demand where you can download and watch movies.  Vizio has placed a button for this on their remote control but it is still a \"coming attraction.\"If all you care about is a nice picture, get the Vizio.  But if you care about sound and the internet apps, as well as platform stability, get the Samsung.  They are both energy efficient - the Samsung is $6/year according to the Energy Wise label on the set and the Vizio is $8.This TV actually begins to blue the line between TV, computer and tablet.  You can attach a keyboard.  You can also attach a webcam and have Skype video calls.  There's also a social app integration that I don't plan to use where you can link everything to Facebook and other social sites, sharing comments on TV shows etc with your friends.  Not my style but some might like that.  As I use more of the functions on this TV I will update this review, but for now, hope this helps!UPDATE January 2014:  So less than a year later and I'm having some pretty significant trouble with this TV.  I've spent four hours on multiple phone calls with Samsung to resolve, but they have been unable to.  In short, they released a firmware update last week which made the Netflix app not work... and nothing (factory reset, having them take over the TV from remote somewhere in Japan) will get this working yet.  A fix is always \"24 hours away\" but the deadline comes and goes with no fix.  AT this point the new 2014 models should be coming out and perhaps their software will be more stable but this TV has really been a disappointment.  One other issue -when you are viewing videos / movies via DLNA streaming you cannot fast forward or rewind, and there is no resume function if you watch half the movie and turn the TV off (or have a power failure) you have to start watching the movie over!  I'm not sure it's fair to change my star review on this TV at this time -- I will think about it and see if Samsung is finally able to get this TV working, but I have to say this whole experience has soured me on the Samsung brand.UPDATE February 2014:  After trying and trying with Samsung, it appears they are unable to fix their firmware update.  The TV displays a \"no new firmware\" when you check for updates and Netflix is still broken.  Basically, Samsung has great hardware but terrible software, and in the era of Smart TV's you have to have both.  Fortunately Amazon stood behind Samsung and is taking this piece of junk back, but I have to go through the hassle of taking it off the wall, boxing it, and then installing a new one (I'm ordering the new Vizio's that are coming out in a few weeks).  I don't want to sound like a bitter person (\"I'm never buying Samsung again!!!\") but I have to admit this experience has soured me on the brand.  Their customer support and their software development is just terrible.  I'm downgrading this to two stars as the picture/sound are indeed good on this TV but the SMART features... not so smart!!", "Date": "April 11, 2013"}, {"Title": "Wifi and sound issues", "Author": "Gotham Observer \"porkboy\"", "ReviewID": "R1G2O6HPB0IXH0", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "Let me start by saying I'm a former employee of Samsung. I know they make incredible electronics, I've seen the glowing customer reviews on samsung.com, I've owned quite a few of their products and loved them, but this TV is not meeting expectations. I'm also a web marketer by trade and have a background in internet tech support. I'm tech savvy and I know what I'm doing.First, the good parts. The picture is great. Set up is easy. The menus are so much easier to understand than other TVs I've wrangled with. External media via USB works well.  I bought a Samsung DVD player too and they pair with the same remote which is a nice bonus. All that is great. I have two major complaints.1- Sound. I have a set of computer speakers that I plugged into the mini jack audio out of the TV. You cannot control the external speakers with the TV remote by this method. Since my computer speakers do not have a remote it means I have to get up and walk across the room to turn the volume down or just use the TV speakers which are pretty worthless due to the nature of every flat screen TV - they must have the speakers in the back by design. I contacted Samsung support and they confirmed that the mini jack audio out is a fixed volume and cannot be altered with the remote.2- Wifi. Maybe I have a dud, but as a wireless device this TV is pointless. I don't have cable TV. I don't watch broadcast TV. I use Netflix, Hulu and Amazon almost exclusively for video entertainment. This means a solid connection to the internet is a must. The TV has major issues with my wifi. I have troubleshooted this issue in every way I know how: network settings, rebooting cable modem and router several times, starting the devices in order from modem to wifi router to TV. I even added 50 ft. of ethernet cable to get the wireless router to just 4 feet away from the TV itself. I then tested the download speed using speedtest.net on the TV's web browser. My laptop, also 4 feet away from the wifi router, measures 14 mbps download speeds. The TV at the same time registers 300 kbps - about 1/40th the speed. As a result none of the streaming video apps work reliably. I wind up going back to watching on my laptop like a student in a college dorm. This defeats the entire purpose of why I bought this TV in the first place. Samsung support suggested I turn off all other competing wifi devices in my home so there's no competition for the signal. Well, ignoring that this is not a viable solution for web device addict like myself (2 laptops, a tablet and two wifi enabled smartphones) this didn't work.UPDATE: I bought a $30 wifi range extender that has a ethernet port out. I connected that to the TV with a hard cable into the LAN port of the TV to bypass the wifi antenna and this has improved things greatly.", "Date": "April 28, 2013"}, {"Title": "Nice picture, smart hub bug, wall mount issue", "Author": "Matthew D Muller", "ReviewID": "R3CFFJ15F99OTR", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "===OVERALL===This is my third Samsung LED and I found the picture to be as good as that of my UN46D7000 (higher-tier 2011 model).  Supposedly this set can't do micro-dimming.  But you wouldn't know it from the black levels, which are as good as or better than the D7000's, lending the F5500 great picture depth.  Overall this is a solid performer where it counts, and in a nice-looking package.  Very good value for this price point.  As noted below, the power cord connector protrudes from the back enough that it might interfere with a low profile mount.  And some of the smart apps didn't work out of the box.  There are workarounds for the first issue and as for the second, I expect Samsung will fix the apps with an update soon.===DESIGN===Most of this is evident from the photos.  The bezel is glossy black and the screen is matte with an anti-reflective coating.  It has a gray plastic Samsung emblem at the bottom center that looks like it could be pried out if you wanted to for some reason.  There's also an IR receiver that protrudes about a centimeter from the bottom right corner.The rear ports are recessed and side-facing, perfect for wall-mounting.  Unfortunately, the power cord socket faces straight back and is not recessed.  So the cord when inserted is not flush with the back of the set.  It has a T design that lowers the profile a bit, but when inserted still protrudes about .65 inches.  That's a bit more than some slim wall mounts (e.g. the picture-hanging style mount with a .5 inch mounting depth).  I shaved part of the T-connector tip and insulation off with a razor to get it down to .5 inch. So far nobody's been electrocuted.The base is satin graphite-colored plastic (some similar-looking Samsung bases are metal; this one's not).  You really have to torque in the screws when attaching it (tried this before wall-mounting).By the way, if you inexplicably can't seem to turn the thing on, try the master power button at the bottom right back of the unit.  Turns out this works much better than throwing the remote at it.===SMART FEATURES===Set-up is easy with the built-in wifi.  The interface is intuitive and not tough for non-techies to figure out.  There do seem to be a few bugs.  Several of the apps (e.g. Netflix, YouTube) prompt you to update the unit's software before proceeding.  However, when you do the update check (hit menu and then look under the support submenu), it advises that everything is current.  So I haven't been able to use at least two of the apps, as of firmware version 1013.  Hopefully Samsung fixes that quickly.  Amazon and Hulu work fine.The apps aren't snappy-fast but also not turtle-slow.  Unless you really want these things to pop, you probably won't miss the quadcore processor.No problems hooking up a Logitech wireless mouse and keyboard. You have to enable it under a menu but otherwise it's plug-and-play.The web browser works well.  Not super-fast but quite usable.===AS A COMPUTER MONITOR===I/ve hooked this up to a Macbook Air for use as a monitor.  So far I haven't figured out the right mix of settings to get the desktop to display without scaling/underscan/overscan that leaves text blurry and images a bit off (try setting your computer monitor to something other than its native resolution if you're not familiar with this effect).  Selecting \"screen fit\" for picture size at least seems to get the desktop properly fitted on the screen (16:9 will scale it).  But the text is still fuzzy.Sometimes settings for a particular input are optimized by default for use with a computer (usually they're marked something like \"HDMI 3/PC\" or \"HDMI 4/DVI\").  I tried all of them, no change.  I turned off all motion smoothing and other picture processing.  No luck.  I tried various configurations on the Mac display menus.  Still no go.  It's not clear whether the issue is on the Samsung or Mac side.  It might be fine with a PC.I'll try to post an update if I figure this out.", "Date": "March 18, 2013"}, {"Title": "Quite Stunning Video and Audio", "Author": "Thomas Krafft \"thomaskrafft\"", "ReviewID": "R13E3K6YF97534", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This is not my first high definition set, but it is my first smart TV--40 inches makes it the largest I've owned--and I am duley impressed so far. What drew me to this set was the very thin frame or bezel around the screen which obviously gives a larger picture in a smaller space.The technical specs and capabilities are well described on the product page, so I won't repeat them here. I want to give you an idea of my experience with the set, the things I was surprised by, and what you may not otherwise find out.The set-up was the easiest experience I've had so far with the TV guiding me through the process before I even had to find the Menu or Guide buttons on the remote. The ports are plenty and well marked leaving a minimal wire profile and a clean look.The remote control is pretty well marked and easy to follow, though not as tactile to use in the dark as the Dish Network control. The Samsung's remote, however, is backlit so it doesn't need to be particularly tactile.I very much like the fact that the base is not a large, flat, glossy black surface as most sets have been in the last few years, showing the first specks of dust and never staying clean for very long. This stand is four curved grey legs that are elegant and practical from a cleaning point of view.The sound quality is especially good with broad range and deep, unmuttled lows. Every manufacturer claims good fidelity, but this set actually provides it. My dog reacts to the slightest animal sounds as if they were right in the room.There were only pros in my experience and no cons (if that changes I will update this post) and I highly recommend this TV.", "Date": "April 6, 2013"}, {"Title": "Samsung makes great TV's that are best in their class", "Author": "Christopher J. Cowen", "ReviewID": "R1K93WEWMN41XT", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Samsung makes great TV's that surpass every other manufacturer in their class. I have two Samsung's in my house and I can tell you the image is beautiful. This TV has an LED screen and in my opinion this the way to go (LED is similar to LCD its back-lit better so that they are no dark spots on the screen).Now add in that this TV can directly connect to the internet and I'm sold. TV's of this class have never been cheaper.One thing that I have found with TV's that its very important to actually look at the TV in person. Now when you look at the TV's, go to a place like Walmart to see them, because many times specialty stores like Best Buy play with the lighting controls on the TV and in the store to skew the image to there advantage. Once you look at the TV simply look and decide which one looks better to you.The next step to take into consideration is features. Here are a few that come with this TV:This Samsung comes with Auto Volume which automatically adjusts the volume of the desired channel, lowering the sound output when the modulation signal is high or raising the sound output when the modulation signal is low. This reduces the difference in volume when changing channels. The Auto Volume feature can be set to Normal, Night or Off.As far as outputs most of these TV's will come with more than enough Inputs and Outputs. This TV comes with 3 HDMI Audio/Video In, 1 RCA Component Audio/Video In and 1 Digital Coaxial Audio Out.Next thing when shopping for a TV is in box technology. Here are some of the features of this TV:With this Smart HDTV there is a full web browser with WiFi built-in apps made for TV. Some of the apps this TV features is Hulu Plus, YouTube, Netflix, Facebook, and Twitter. Browse the web while you watch movies and TV shows, and enjoy TV while you chat with friends and family online, all on one screen with this Samsung.Thank you for reading my review, if you have any questions feel free to email me, I would be happy to help you with any questions you have.", "Date": "November 28, 2013"}, {"Title": "awesome tv", "Author": "Alla S.", "ReviewID": "RKS6P945RIJWG", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Great picture quality and sound. It was easy to set up and to connect to wifi with the wireless modem. I love the look of the tv and how it's situated on a four-leg stand. When you turn it on, you get an attractive menu with one tv channel playing in a small window, and a bunch of other channels lining up at the same time. You can then enlarge the channel currently playing, or to switch to any of the other channels. Definitely have the HD box hooked up to the tv for some terrific picture quality.Besides the \"on tv\" section which is automatically selected when you turn on the tv, the menu interface includes other categories like \"movies and tv shows,\" \"photo/video/music,\" \"apps\" (that's where you get the web browsing, as well as access to facebook, netflix, amazon instant video, twitter, youtube, skype as well as a bunch of other less known apps), and lastly a fourth category called \"social\" (not sure of its purpose, as you can just use the apps for that).One thing I really liked is that I noticed the screen automatically adjusts itself to its surroundings--if the room is bright the tv is bright, if I turn off the light and the room is dark, the picture becomes dim as well. Great sensors.Now to some things that could be improved: If say I lose my remote control and need to turn on the tv manually, I have to actually bend over and reach all the way behind the tv to locate the joystick-like button that turns it on and controls it. This is inconvenient. Also, when I turn on the internet, I have found that it's uncomfortable to do the typing with the remote control pointer. I have remedied this issue by purchasing the logitech k400 wireless keyboard, which was easy to set up and I noticed works well with this tv. Lastly, and a minor annoyance with the otherwise superb design, is that while the brand name \"samsung\" is often directly imprinted on its products, here it sticks out separately, underneath the monitor, like some kind of cheap tag that you keep wanting to tear off, before suddenly remembering that it's attached to the tv.Overall though, this is the best smart tv on a budget, that has almost everything that the more expensive models have. The only thing lacking is a camera (that's if you want to use skype, but it would cost way less to purchase one separately and hook it up to this tv, than to buy a more expensive smart tv model where the camera is included).", "Date": "August 6, 2013"}, {"Title": "Excellent TV", "Author": "E.

The F5500  series is about $200 more retail and from appearance looks to have an X shaped stand with a much slimmer side profile than the EH5300. In fact last Christmas we bought my mother a pair of 32 inch EH5300s for her kitchen/bedroom and those TVs were awesome. So I assumed the F5500 was just a newer slimmer stlyish series to the cheaper EH5300 when I picked one up last week from Best Buy for my fiance's birthday.Man was I wrong about it just being a slimmer TV. The UN32F5500 is a BEAST!!!! First and foremost when you hook it up and turn it on the quality of the surround sound is what hits you first. The sound that comes out of this little 32\" guy is crystal clear and super loud (be sure to set it for MOVIE Mode). It literally feels as if the scene on TV is going on in your room. The trick is the speakers on the F5500 are on the bottom edge of the monitor so mounting it on a flat wall helps project the sound even better. By contrast the EH5300 has poorer sound quality.The F5500 is a slim and thin TV that weigh far less than the chunky steel wall mount anchors that I screwed on the back of the thing. This is good but also can be bad if you want your TV to make a bold statement in the room you mount it in.If you are replacing an older beefier wall mounted 32\" flat screen (the older TVs had 2 to 3 inch thick bezels with 4 ot 5 inches of bezel on the bottom edge for speaker grills and buttons) with this F5500 the first thing you will think is the F5500 screen is smaller on the F5500. This optical illusion is a result of the micro thin bezel that surrounds the F5500's display. It makes the entire package appear tiny on a big wall. This is why we returned the 32 inch F5500 for the 40 inch version. As a matter of fact the 40 inch F5500 has the same wall mount footprint as our old 32 inch Dynex Flatscreen.With everything said and done when it comes to Samsung HDTVs you already know you are getting great picture quality and with this F5500 you will not be dissapointed.As for the SMART TV features I believe Samsung does a great job with providing many apps and making the interface easy to access and really fast. The Netflix and Smart Hub shortcuts on the remote is super helpful. You can also program the F5500's remote control to control your cable box. If you have other Samsung or Andriod devices in the house then you can connect everything to this TV.Overall this is a great TV.

People who are in search and in need of a T.V., I know this one will not let you down and put your hopes up for no reason. Trust me this is the T.V. you are looking for. I fell in love with this T.V. I wish I would have bought this television a very long time ago. I wouldn't be struggling with my old T.V. My previous television was from the 90's and it was such a dramatic change between the two. I always had trouble with my old antenna television. I'm so glad I don't have to deal with it no more. Also my old television, like most old T.V.s it was a very small size T.V. I no longer have to stand right in front of it. On another subject I went from a 60 channel to a computer T.V. This one can even be hung to the wall and I can sit back and relax. You can only imagine how happy I am with my T.V. now. Now I can have entertainment with my family without having the argument of blocking the view. In fact I enjoy it so much that I can't wait to save up for another one for my living room. This is a $579.00 worth T.V. for the price of $375.99 which is a little over $200.00 dollars less than it is worth. It is totally worth it buying it on this website. To make the price even better, it's included with a free delivery and within a 1 day delivery. It's a cheap price and after you own the T.V. you will not be spending so much money in electricity because it is also an LED T.V. This is the perfect size (32-inch) of T.V. for a room or even the living room. To top it off it's a slim HDTV, what does that mean you ask? This means that it will not take too much space between the wall and the T.V. Not only will it be the perfect size but it's high definition which means that the resolutions are amazing. I'm sure you will enjoy watching T.V. on this as much as I do.Let me tell you more of the qualities I was talking about earlier. Like is said this will do about the same amount of things your computer, laptop, and smartphone does. You can be connected with friends and family by Facebook, Skype, and Twitter. You can have many entertainments such as: Hulu, Netflix, YouTube, and Pandora. With what I just mentioned you can watch movies or listen to music by yourself, with family or friends. You can also download game applications that you can use as entertainment. Or simply watch regular cable T.V. of anything you like to watch whether is a regular show, episodic, or a movie. I really love this T.V. this television even makes things easier to do because it does so many things and it all happens in one single T.V.After all, this is an overall spectacular television, which is affordable, enjoyable, entertaining, and worthy. And in the long run it will not take up too much of your electricity bill. If I were in need of buying another television I would choose exactly the same one that I have bought once, without a doubt. I think everyone should have one like this one because it's a decent size for any room and the brightness of the T.V. will adjust to the light in the room on its own.", "Date": "September 15, 2013"}, {"Title": "Pitfalls of edge-lit LED screen", "Author": "N", "ReviewID": "ROD7YD6TGK2UV", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "Overview:  an annual update to UN32EH5300 smart TV.  Dual core makes everything snappy.  Despite the quality Samsung panels, though, uneven lighting is noticeable.Pros:  solid quality, smart TV with apps you would actually use, adequate amount of ports, solid design, good viewing angle, high energy efficiency, setup is relatively painless and scans all the channels for you and hides all the scrambled ones.Cons:  edge-lit LED as opposed to last year's full array LED, uneven lighting with bright edges and dark corners, some apps are unoptimized and hard to navigate as well as providing lower streaming quality than a Roku box, remote doesn't have QWERTY buttons like Vizio's, stand is only ideal if you're putting it on a solid pane as opposed to wire shelf or other less-than-ideal footing, bezel not very thick despite utilizing edge-lit LED.In a nutshell:  two steps forward, one big step back.Everyone has priorities.  When it comes to TVs, I have priorities as well.  High resolution is nice, but not necessary. Size matters, but in that it should match the location it's going to be at.  Smart TV is good to have, but it's nothing a Roku box can't solve.  But I game. I like pretty pictures.  So my interest lies in low input lag, good color reproduction, and nice, even lighting.  Looking at the reviews on many TVs, I settled on this one.  I actually went out to a big-box retailer and got a Samsung-paneled one (Samsung is apparently notorious for mixing and matching different manufacturer panels on same models, with wildly different picture reproductions and such. You should read up on it).It's all pretty good.  The stand \"legs\" are unorthodox but fashionable, and TV is constructed well.  It has 3 HDMI ports--pretty sure that's about how much I need.  Colors are good, setup was painless, and it has audio-out AND Ethernet-in.  It's great.But it has its downsides.  From old model, they have decided to make the TV thinner by switching from full array LED to edge-lit LED.  Now, what that does is moving all the light source from the TV from directly behind the LCD panels to the edges of it via light guides.  Think of it like, say, a Kindle Paperwhite, except in reverse and with much stronger light.  In theory, it'll work just as well as full array.  Nope; it usually ends up in corners being dim and edges being brighter than the center.  And that's exactly what happened with this TV.  It functions, it's beautiful, and smart TV function is actually usable thanks to a substantial hardware upgrade.  But I have slightly different priority, which makes its cons cut a lot deeper than others.You're a sexy beast, Samsung, but the bright and dark spots of yours bug the hell out of me.  I've just ordered its slower, older sister to see if it makes a difference.  Two TVs come in, one leaves as a return--wish me luck.", "Date": "September 15, 2013"}, {"Title": "Best Picture I've Seen in This Class of TVs", "Author": "The Travelin' Hrncirs", "ReviewID": "R3FT2PWDDLWCNA", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I had a hard time going between 4 and 5 stars.I like this TV a lot - I really do. I am stationed in Mexico, but ordered it from Amazon when I found it at a Walmart here for about $150 more. So we waited a couple of weeks and I eagerly took it out of the box.First of all - our stuff comes through USPS and then a second mail forwarder, and it still arrived in perfect condition. I was a bit concerned, but it's clearly packed well.As far as operation, I was impressed by the buttons for Netflix and Amazon Prime Video, but unfortunately only the Netflix works here. The Amazon Prime clearly does not work out of the US - even just south of the border. Ironic since they sell this model here...The setup is fairly intuitive (initially all menus were in Spanish because I'm in Mexico - but that fixes itself). Trying to use Facebook is a pain because you have to create a Samsung account. I assume that means that if my wife and daughter and I all wanted to use this TV for Facebook, we would have to create separate Samsung accounts and log in and out. We opted not to use that feature, mostly because who wants to create another account (Samsung) to log into an account you already have (Facebook).The TV updates its own firmware, but that takes quite a bit of tie when you start up... Even though my internt connection is not too bad (20-30mbs on average).I thought Skype was going to be awesome for the big screen, and frankly was a huge selling point on this model (besides having the best picture in the store), but only when it arrived did I read that in order to use Skype, you have to buy one of their 2 specific models of webcam. The webcam that I plugged into the USB port (that says WEBCAM) was not compatible. Only two webcams on earth are compatible apparently, but luckily I can buy it on Amazon for $80 with free shipping for Amazon Prime Customers. A bit of a turn-off.I do like the fact that I can plug an external hard drive in and play right from that. So far I've had only one issue with a file that would not play (.mkv files play amazingly well), and there's a chance that it's a problem beyond the control of the TV - so for all intents and purposes - it plays everything I threw at it.There is a screen mirroring feature that sounded awesome (playing video on your screen from your smartphone) but then I discovered that this of course is only available with some Samsung Phones. Which was a bit of a downer... If this had that same ability from an iPhone app - I imagine it would expand their audience... but I'm sure there are compatibility issues there.The single biggest complaint that I have about the quality of this TV is that when I connect it from the Computer to the TV via a HDMI cable (does not matter which HDMI port on the TV), sometimes (not all the time) the TV starts to emit a horrible humming noise. It happened the first day I set it up and I thought maybe it was the cable. I plugged it in again the second day - no noise. Just now, as I was writing this review, all of the sudden it spontaneously came back and would not stop until unplugged. It might be the cable, but I never had this problems with my last TV. I did have it hooked up to a laptop for a brief while (2 episodes of Breaking Bad) and I did not experience this problem, but again - for 4 years I had this same computer hooked up to a different computer and never had the same hum. Clearly a compatibility issue.I was pleasantly surprised to see that it discovered my wireless laptop on the network and offered to play files, but it didn't work smoothly. I don't plant to use it for this purpose often, but it was frustrating that it could't play a couple of video files without giving me a network error message. I also wish it would recognize the lan connected cable instead of just wireless shared files.The App Store from Samsung is lacking. It's okay, but most of which I have no interest in. My turn-off from Facebook was referenced above, and I didn't bother to set up twitter because I'm not likely to go through all those steps when it's one click away on my phone. Skype is worthless unless I buy a camera from Samsung. And really - the rest is boring, or a link to buy something else. The App store is not a selling point, unless you count Netflix as an app - which is the only saving grace on this machine... Although, I am pretty sure we'll buy the stupid camera because I really like the idea of all sitting around the TV instead of sitting around the Computer.So I've said several negative things about it - but the reason I was torn... I LOVE THE PICTURE. It's really fantastic. In the store compared to all the other similarly-sized TVs in the store. I mean the picture wasn't close (to be fair I'm sure it would have had more competition in a Best Buy than in a Walmart). Getting it home and playing digital files, I am NOT disappointed. Watching episodes off of Netflix is not the epitome of High Definition (I was playing via a hard wire connection. not wireless) but comparable to my computer monitor - just bigger. My cable box has not been properly set up so my cable comes in as standard definition, but it's still very good. I can't wait to turn on the HD channels. So all and all, for the size of the box, the picture could not be better in my mind. I am very happy with the picture and quality.In the end I determined that my disappointment with unit's shortcomings were a bit too much to overcome, despite being the best picture I've ever had in my living room. At this point I would definitely buy again (I've seen nothing else in this price range that compares) and would recommend this TV to all but my geekiest friends who would expect more out of a SmartTV.TL;DR: Best Picture ever, rest of the apps and features leave a little to be desired.", "Date": "September 13, 2013"}, {"Title": "Wow Factor - Picture & Sound", "Author": "SHARON \"rubyvern\"", "ReviewID": "RZ42B4W02Y81W", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I was expecting the Samsung LED picture to be great, but given what a lot of reviews say in general I thought I'd have to buy a sound bar or some sort of expensive audio supplement.

I'm not an audiophile, I'll admit, but I will not need to spend $$ on sound in the near future.

Compared them side by side to decide which to keep.  Input lag on the F5500 matched the EH5000, which is best in the industry.  Around 20-23ms of lag, when game mode is enabled.  Tons of lag without game mode, so watch out.  Contrast and brightness, as well as color accuracy, are excellent for this price range.  Ran the same show on an Apple TV and the Smart TV netflix to the two sets at the same time in order to do a comparison.  Thought the 50\" video quality was extremely poor.  Plugged the Apple TV into the 50\" F5500 and the picture was dramatically improved.  Not sure why, but the picture quality of Netflix streaming via the built in wifi and smart TV app is just garbage.  Could not believe how bad it was.  I am keeping the set because of the great open box deal I got.  Otherwise, I would buy the F5000 and get the same screen and picture quality and buy a separate external smart TV solution like a ROKU box or Apple TV.  Then it can be used with other screens too, if necessary.  Honestly the worst streaming quality I have seen.  The resolution was there, it wasn't downgrading the signal for bandwidth, but the colors, contrast, and detail were all wrong.Side note:Already mentioned low input lag.  Just need to state that this is, in my opinion, one of the best sets of 2013 for gaming.  Able to turn off almost all video processing, super low input lag, very good contrast and color accuracy result in a great gaming experience.  Some people will say, \"What about 240 HTZ sets?!\"  Your Xbox or PS3 is only outputting 60 htz.  The 240 htz sets may have a better pixel response time, which will reduce motion blur on fast action, but 60 htz and 240 htz guarantee nothing in regard to this pixel black to white to black response time.  I have had no motion blur problems while gaming on this set.  The response time seems to be perfectly adequate, though I admittedly have never really been bothered by motion blur on any of my sets and do not have an exact measurement.  Input lag is what I despise and this is one of the very few sets that will get you into the low 20ms range while maintaining a very respectable picture.  Only small computer monitors have less lag and many computer monitors still have more.  I also own a Dell S2440L with a sub 10ms input lag response and cannot clearly  feel a difference.

It is a second TV, and it lives in my bedroom about 10 feet away from my viewing position. It is a fine TV, some of the reviews are a bit harsh in my opinion. Compared to the Sony Bravia picture I'm used to the Samsung is much brighter, vivid, clearer, and the blacks are definitely what I would expect and not dark grey. The TV as a Smart TV does have some drawbacks but as a whole is definitely worth the money if you were to buy this.I primarily use this set to stream Netflix, Hulu, and my iTunes library of movies through an Apple TV. My only other use is watching DVDs or Blu-ray Discs.Pros:TV is very light, easy to moveBright, clear picture in standard, 720p, 1080pRich colorsVibrant sound for a small room, even at volume setting 8.Music was slightly overpowering at first until I turned on the True settings. The voices in the streamed movies and TV shows I was watching sounded clear/acceptable. It filled my 16 1/2' by 12 1/2' bedroom with ample sound even at lower volume settings.Picture is clearly visible from everywhere in my room, some LED TVs get dark or blurred when you are at extreme angles.Samsung Apps seems to offer quite a lot of video and educational apps. Gaming on a TV doesn't make sense to me, but if that is your thing, then they have that as well.Refresh was perfect in 1080p with some of my larger files, but then again I was streaming through the Apple TV and not using the processor of the TV as much.The TV resembles a PC LED Monitor, I personally like that since it makes the unit a little less obtrusive. For instance, I have mine sitting on top of a dresser instead of hanging it where the Sony used to be.Turning the unit on; it loads fast (My Sony Google TV took almost a minute, sometimes more to load completely)Cons:Smart Hub is not so smart.TV configuration is okay, entering text is very cumbersome. I've seen worse but it could have been better.First-use configuration is looking for you to attach cable or antenna. It didn't give me an option to skip and I really think it should have.The remote is nothing fancy considering it is a smart tv.The base seems stable but as some have stated it does look and feel a little cheap. In my opinion it doesn't look like the base of a TV and therefore the feel is wrong.The WiFi disconnected on the TV the first two times I tried updating the system software. It has been fine after the update dated Aug 2013.My overall impression is that this TV is 4 1/2 stars for picture and sound quality, take away a little for the cumbersome uninspiring Smart TV interface and remote. My out of box experience was positive, the TV set up fast with very minor tweaking to get it the way I wanted it. My Apple TV and Blu-ray plugged right in with no further manipulation. The remote control for the TV is less inspiring however perfectly acceptable for general TV usage. The overall build and feel of the TV is really quite pleasing considering the retail price.

For most people, that leaves you with this TV or the VIZIO M321i-A2 32-Inch.  If you go to best buy and are lucky enough to have these two TVs close together you will see that the Samsung absolutely destroys Vizio in the picture department.  To be honest, it's not even close.  The colors are so much more vibrant on the Samsung TV.  I tried many different settings on both TVs and at different Best Buys and the Vizio colors just look dull next to this Samsung.  With all of that said, the smart TV feature is also a very important component of this purchase.  I am not going to go into the plethora of things I have done with samsung tech support and my internet provider, but this TV consistently drops off the network.  My apple TV is sitting directly under this TV and has not dropped off the network while streaming once in the last year since I bought it and every single device in my house has no problem holding a connection.  You may ask why I still keep my Apple TV and the reason is because I feel I get much better quality streaming with Apple TV with absolutely no hiccups.  The only thing is that I also have amazon prime and would like to stream movies from that app, and I can't do that with apple products \"yet.\" Thus, one of the reasons I bought this TV was to have access to these other streaming apps like Amazon.  I feel confident saying that it is a hardware issue with the TV.  I will continue to try and troubleshoot this issue, but sending this TV back to Samsung is honestly going to be such a hassle just to get amazon prime streaming.

But at the 32\" size, LCD is the only choice, and I must say I'm pleased.  When I compare the picture and features of this model to its competitors, there was no comparison except a Sony going for an outrageous $200 more.  The Sammy itself is pretty pricey for its class.  But you get what you pay for.  Samsung's Smart Hub is hands down the best of the smart TV platforms, and the picture quality is top notch, as is the nice little extra of including an IR blaster to control your other devices hooked up to the TV like a cable box, DVD players, etc.  Tell it who your cable or satellite provider is and it'll create its own program guide for you that in some cases will be better than your provider's.  It will also make recommendations for you to watch.  The more you use it, the more it learns what you watch and changes the recommendations for you.Yes, you can pay less to get a 32\" LCD Smart TV from Vizio, Toshiba, LG, etc.  But go do a side by side comparison of picture quality and features, and you'll see the difference.  Like I said, you get what you pay for.  Samsung makes one 32\"  model higher than this, the 6300 series, which I don't see as being worth its $130 price premium.  Near as I can tell all you get is an extra HDMI input, a 120 hz refresh rate, and Clear Motion Rate 240 instead of this model's 120.  Clear Motion is Samsung's term for a bunch of electronic trickery that attempts to mimic a 120hz or higher refresh rate.  But make no mistake, the 5500 is really a 60hz panel, while the 6300 is really 120hz.  Setup was easy and everything worked as it should.  Hooking up to my Wi-Fi was a breeze and streaming videos on Amazon and HBO Go works great with no buffering.  I recommend calibrating the display to get the most of out it.  Just Google a review of it to find professionally calibrated settings.I do have a few quibbles: though the blaster works well, controlling my cable box with ease and little delay, be advised that Smart Hub is not designed to operate a DVR, so you'll still be stuck using  a separate remote if you have one.  Samsung dropped the ball there.  Also while the remote is backlit, it doesn't light up unless you press something.  But you can't see what to press in the dark.  They should have made it light up when picked up.  The button layout is not the best.  Often used buttons like play, fast forward, etc. are at the very bottom.  Dumb ergonomic design.  I'm not a fan of the quad stand either.  It's a bad design that simply takes up too much space compared to a simple rectangular stand other brands use.  The stand on this TV is 22\" wide and 10.4\" deep for an entire TV that only measures 29\" wide.  By comparison, the stand for my far larger 58\" plasma is only 24.5\" wide.  The stand only rotates 10 degrees.  That is useless, barely moving it off center.  Why bother?  Lastly, though marketed as a 32\", the screen measures only 31.5\"  C'mon Samsung - I paid for 32\", I expect to get every inch I paid for.  At least market the truth.In summary, the Samsung UN32F5500 is the best buy in its class if you want a smart TV.  It's on the upper end of the price range - but it's not the most expensive.  The ones that cost more don't offer anything to justify their price premium.  Meanwhile this model justifies it's premium over the models below it in price with its superior features, smart interface, and picture quality.  It's not perfect, as it's let down by Smart Hub's inability to integrate DVR functions, as well as a poorly designed remote and stand.  So I docked it a star.  But those minor issues aren't enough to keep me from recommending it.  If you don't want/need smart features, go with the 5300 series for about $50 less.

Based on past purchases, Amazon has been great and have no issues with them. The review is about the product.I bought this product back in December as a holiday present. Did not open it until January. It was working fine until couple of weeks ago. TV started power cycling (restarting) on its own. It can be while in a middle of a program or when just turning it ON. I initially called the vendor but was told that since it is more than 60 days, I will need to contact manufacturer. I called Samsung support. The tech advised to plug it a different outlet and upgrade the firmware. I followed their instructions but problem persisted. I was told to open a service request online. After couple of days, I received a voicemail instructing to perform same troubleshooting steps and that they will close the service request. I did it anyway and obviously did not work. Opened another ticket online. I got a call few days later and was being told the same thing. I told them that it has been done few times and that it does not work. I was told they will open a service ticket but I will need to bring it to their service center. I said that it is ridiculous and want a tech visit since it is not my fault and still new. I was told that they can send a tech out but I may have to pay for the repair. At that point I asked to speak with a manager. I was put on hold for at least 10 minutes then they hang up on me.I want to give them the benefit of the doubt that I probably just got a defective product but their customer service is so so bad that it makes me wonder if I want to purchase any other product from them with this experience.", "Date": "March 27, 2014"}, {"Title": "Really great TV", "Author": "tundish", "ReviewID": "RTT1UUE6A5CGR", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I really like this TV and it seems to be an ideal choice for a smart tv in this price range.

De-boxing and set up of this TV was extremely simple - and it connected effortlessly to our wireless network. Netflix works great and the picture and sound quality are superb for this price point. Our biggest complaint (and the reason I can only give 3 stars) is that after about 3 days we had a pixel die (dark red) in the right center/middle of the screen. It's goes largely unnoticed when viewing active TV or movies - but when the screen is predominately dark/black it is clearly visible. Ultimately, this isn't enough of an issue to warrant returning or pursuing alternate brands but it will be something I continue to monitor like a hawk - I will not tolerate even one more pixel dying. Even at the great price we picked ours up at ($488), who wants to deal with the heartbreak of an imperfect product. Fingers are officially crossed!**UPDATE:On advice from my attorney/father I submited a complaint about the dead pixel - not in order to exchange it, but simply to have it documented in case more pixels decided to die.Shortly (near immediately) after submitting the complaint I received an e-mail response from the 3rd party vendor that sold me the TV - Video & Audio Center of Santa Monica, CA. Once seeing that my TV had shipped from across the country (I live in Ohio) I braced myself for a run-around - but that was ok, as I was just documenting the issue.Well let me say - Video & Audio Center went above a beyond any customer service experience I've ever had. Aside from responding to every e-mail I sent as quickly as one would expect from an instant message exchange - Video and Audio Center offered to send me a replacement TV upon simply providing them a picture of the defective pixel. Under this arrangement, I was never without a working TV; I was able to re-package the defective unit in the packaging provided by the replacement (since I had disposed of the original shipping box); and they agreed to pay for all the shipping costs so I was never out of pocket another penny.I have the new unit hooked up and couldn't be happier. All the pixels are in great working order and I couldn't be happier with both the TV and my experience with Video and Audio Center of Santa Monica. I'm sure Amazon strives to partner with great 3rd party vendors - and, in my experience, they couldn't have landed a better one in this case. Although I live on the opposite side of the country, I will go out of my way to do business with them in the future if at all possible.Upping to 5 stars because I think customer service this good is a rarity these days.", "Date": "December 25, 2013"}, {"Title": "Great buy", "Author": "Locs", "ReviewID": "R156XOYUN4BA24", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Im very pleased with my Amazon smart tv.

I was also able to set up a free Pandora music station where I was able to save some of my favorite Mariachi radio stations and old school rock & roll stations. We use this in our bedroom where I have it connected to a Panasonic VHS/DVD Recorder combo player via an HDMI cable and it works great. In fact, before I even programed the universal remote, I tried playing a DVD disc using the Panasonic remote to open the players door to put the disc in & close it. I then tried using the Samsung remote select button (enter) and the movie started to play. I tried  the pause, forward, reverse, & stop buttons and they all controlled the Panasonic DVD player much to my surprise. I haven't had time to check out all the other features, but so far I am satisfied with the performance of the TV. I wish Samsung made a 36\" or 37\" size of this model as the 32\" is a bit small for my eyes, considering our old one that burned out was a 37\" Westinghouse, LCD, 14 year old TV.

It was disappointing, especially since the apps that are provided include HuluPlus but not Hulu.  The apps work great for the most part but be aware that just as it took a while for Android phones to amass a collection of apps, it will take time for this TV to do the same so you won't find everything you're looking for.

The TV looks great and the picture quality looks great with what Samsung has provided. I noticed 85% of the reviews were men!  This is not easy for a 69 year old grandma to hook up on her own.  Will add more later if I ever get it hooked up. I will call my cable provider and see if they can hook it up.  I'm extremely unhappy with how hard this is to hook up.  The menus do not say how to hook up cable TV.  The should have a training video on it.If I ever do get this hooked up I will write a better review I hope.  All the reviews were so positive except for a few.  I guess I'm one of the few.  The TV may be Smart, but this lady don't feel very smart! :(  (Read updated review at the top - give it a chance and don't be tired when hooking it up.)

The TV pretty much does everything for you and the onscreen directions are so easy to follow.The fact that it has exactly what I needed built right in made this an even better deal for me...I was all set to have to set up my net-book or Kindle to be able to do some of the things that this TV is already programed to do.It (the TV itself) even managed to find our DVD player even though it's an older one, and set that up too.This is the perfect lower end TV for those of us that have not kept up with technology.

This is my third Samsung TV (different models) and all of them had issues. I have to admit their TVs look nice, but fail on the quality control, have cheap parts, and cease to perform within a relatively short period of time. The bottom line is -  it became a gamble to purchase this brand.Before listing the problems I've encountered, I want to mention that improper reviews lead to boosted ratings and potential customers are led to believe that problems are rare or isolated. Surely you've noticed this.I have not used this TV for smart features yet, but encountered the following issues:1.  The IR extender does not work properly. It tends to block the signal to the setup box, so the TV remote cannot be used to control both TV and the setup box.2.  If you plan to mount this TV on the wall be prepared to run around looking for the hardware and be creative.  The mounting holes on the back of the TV are different. Samsung said it was a defect. In reality, this model is made that way (3 holes with threading and 1 hole without threading) - there is absolutely no reason for that!3. This is a big one! After 6 months of moderate use, TV screen suddenly went black (no picture). The main panel (screen) was replaced. It was repaired under warranty. Needless to say,  you have to go through a torturous process to get it fixed.Now, on top of all the issues that customers have encountered, add Samsung's horrific Customer Service. Their lack  of knowledge, misguided information, complete disregard for the customers' time, and rudeness leaves you with only one  impression - they just don't care!  They have a big market share and will sell their junk to another victim. They don't care about the longevity of their products, because they want you to go buy another TV as soon as possible. How else will they sell the flood of TVs they throw out into the market if you keep yours for a long time? Think about it!Well, some of us can't afford a new TV every year!

However, Netflix app does not work with the keyboard, you have to use the remote which is very slow.This is a good start at being a Smart TV, but Samsung needs to make their system faster and easier to use. Their remote is just to slow and it is NOT user friendly. If they are going to sell Smart TVs they need to make their remote, an easy to use KEYBOARD and make all the apps work with a keyboard.

Rosinbum \"\"chickentender\"\"", "ReviewID": "R3U4T7PW1VFVWZ", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I am truly glad I waited more than a year to buy a new television. I looked at Samsung and Vizio and several others last summer and wound up sticking with my old 24in Samsung (which I still believe to be an incredible small tv/monitor - it's sound quality is head&shoulders; above this newer set, surprisingly) and letting the \"smarts\" evolve a bit more. I am very glad that I did.This TV has impressed me in nearly every way. The interface is intuitive, the picture quality is outstanding and the sound is more than passable for such a thin and light flatscreen. (this review is of the 32in model - I personally don't think anyone needs a tv larger than that in their home, perhaps up to a 40in if the room is incredibly large. too much emphasis is placed on the TV in american homes and too little on conversation and \"living\"... but that is an entirely different subject)My only complaint is that the tv *only* has line level audio available from *both* the analog and digital outputs, e.g. you cannot control the volume level of those outputs via the TV's remote. It they'd included a way to switch this in the software I'd have given the TV 5 stars.Even the onboard HD OTA/Cable tuner is fantastic. We use only OTA broadcast signal for our normal tv watching and this tv picks up more channels clearer and more reliably than my dedicated HD OTA Samsung tuner that I've used for years prior. It also creates an *extremely* well put together channel guide, with options to schedule viewing etc, based on your local listings. Very very well done and implemented. Makes my old STB look *truly* like an old dinosaur.My Xbox360 will likely see much less use (though it is still superior in some areas, such as watching MP4 encoded videos. I've not tested thoroughly on the Samsung but it seems that, depending on the codec used --most of mine are the very common h.264/AAC-- some options, like skipping forward or backward are not available (not so on the XBox)... Hopefully this can be addressed down the road with software updates. Netflix and Amazon Prime both looked fantastic, as did pretty much everything I threw at this tv after setting it up yesterday afternoon and playing with it/watching it until late last night.Overall, I think this set is fantastic and darn near perfect. Hats off to Samsung - as usual they've manufactured a quality set.UPDATE: 7/22/2013 Still very very much enjoying this tv. At first I did not care for the Eco settings which can dim the screen based on ambient light in the room ... I have it on its most modest setting and at time (rare) it gets too dim but most of the time it does a good job, keeping the screen lit enough to see all the details but without being so bright in a dim room. Definitely saves your night vision late at night, or if you turn on the tv when it's late it does not blind you with how bright it is.Only other complaint I have is that support for some digital video files is limited, e.g. I have a small number of mp4 and mkv files... most of which the tv will play, but you cannot skip ahead or backward. This is not a problem unless you stop a movie (purposefully or by accident) and want to go ahead to where you were, or just skipping ahead in general, or backward because you missed something. It will only play some files from beginning to end, so for that my xbox is still used more often. Hopefully, again, this can be fixed with future software updates. Still a fantastic tv in my opinion though.", "Date": "July 17, 2013"}, {"Title": "Fails after 3 months", "Author": "Brad Bartlett", "ReviewID": "R4U2WKHD0F0ZW", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "Purchased this as a christmas gift, but after only 3 months, 1 horizontal and 1 vertical line of dead pixels appears on the screen.

I have tried 4 or 5 recommended settings, and done some tinkering of my own.  But I remain dissatisfied with the picture quality -- it is simply not as sharp as the screen on a Vizio I bought for a different room at the same time.  And I must change the picture choices whenever I view it at night in a dark room after making adjustments for daytime viewing in a bright room.  Engaging the auto detection feature that is supposed to do this does not seem to do the job.  This model's picture rates 3 stars at best.The program guide included in the smart features is a blessing.  It was the inclusion of this feature that tipped my choice in favor of this model (so far as I know, only Samsung has this feature).  I use an over-the-air antenna, and Samsung's guide is better than the guide my cable service provided when I had cable service.

The tv is like brand new no scratches as described (thank goodness). It only cost me about 320 so it worked out well.. I haven't had any issues and have had it for a month and couple weeks.Alright, on to the tv. I love everything about it. The picture is really good.. not like soap opera good which is a good thing. You can adjust the brightest and backlight to your wanting. The sound is good in my opinion I noticed before I bought this tv some people said it was ok. That's not true.. it meet my expectations. Of course your not going to get theater sound all around, but lets be honest movie theater sounds have tons of expensive sound equipment don't think for a second just because you get a tv it's going to be like this home entertainment system without dropping some dollars on it for upgrades. The apps run well, I can't really say I have issues, it's rare but at times the app can sort of freeze and not work but you can easily hit the home button and restart it. I do hate how sometimes my tv seems to drop (WiFi) forcing me to put my password every now and then but it doesn't occur to often for it to be a headache. There are tons of free apps, workout apps that monitors your progress, apps for kids. You can go to Samsung movie apps and rent movies, add photos, sykpe if you have a web cam. I'm a college student and it also works great with my PS4 I don't get any lag or anything and picture looks nice. Even at regular settings. My two only cons is the remote controller. The search button is right under Netflix, hitting that accidentally will take you out of any app your on and but you back to the app homescreen, also the exit button is also next to the arrow navigation button so if I accidentally hit that I sometimes exit out an app.. oh surfing the web is a pain without a keyboard, it feels like forever.. and there's no pop up block so if you get on a webpage but as soon as you get on it, nothing is stopping it from being redirected to a site your not even worried about. I did get flash player to work on but it took a few shortcuts to get the page I wanted and dealing with pop ups. But it's not even worth the hassle. Just use a computer or laptop. Other than that it's a great tv. Netflix looks good and works flawlessly, havdnt used amazon prime or hulu but I expect it will look great as well. When I have kids I would invest in a smart tv. I watch YouTube channels a lot, I can control YouTube as well as anyother app that's on my tv with my HTC One. I can also use my HTC One as a remote . Of course I don't do it often no point of wasting my battery for that. It's a nice feature if you don't wanna get up and do a more detailed search through your phone and have it play on your tv.

Installation is a breeze with the quick start guide. However, be aware the the quadpod stand foot print is significantly wider than a typical TV stand (for the 32 inch set 22\" x 10.25\" existing HDTV was 16\" x11,25\") and overhung the nightstand I was previously using. Updating the software took forever at about a hour (DSL) and the Smart TV works well except navigation is a little clunky. There is some motion blur on sports programming, so if you watch a lot of fast action TV, you may want to step up to 6300 series which has a 120Hz refresh rate (5500 series @ 60 Hz). One annoying feature is that when you mute the TV, the mute icon stays on the screen. This requires you to put the sound level at zero if your switching from the TV to an external audio source (and as one reviewer noted, neither of the HDMI inputs support ARC which in 2013 and at this price level is a major omission) One nice feature is that the sound output (digital audio) can be changed to PCM allowing any external device which may not support the Dolby encodes (my ZVOX did not) to operate.

I decided to purchase the Samsung UN46F5500 46-Inch Smart TV for my mom and was super excited at how quick it arrived.  TV setup was fairly straight-forward, and the Smart TV apps were nicely organized and ready for use.I had also purchased a Samsung Blue Ray Home Theater system to connect with it.  Long story short, I could NOT get the TV to produce surround sound through just the HDMI cable.  Yes - I did confirm the HTS supports ARC through HDMI.  And yes know I could've used the Audio Optical cable.  But I wanted only an HDMI connection using the HDMI/ARC technology.  Well it turns out this TV does NOT support HDMI/ARC.  And NO where online was this mentioned on the spec sheets.  Only after spending countless hours (and trips to buy new HDMI cables) trying to get TV sound through the Home Theater, I found a detailed manual online (not even the manual that came with the TV) that indicated this model does not support ARC.Needless to say I am extremely disappointed that I have to return it.  I really wish these vendors would show a picture of the back of their TV's in the online ads and/or list something specific about support of HDMI ARC.  So buyers beware - if you want to connect this TV to a Home Theater system so you can get surround sound from the TV (e.g. through Smart TV apps like Netflix), the HDMI connections will NOT support this!", "Date": "October 20, 2013"}, {"Title": "Love the Smart Features", "Author": "Scott Miller", "ReviewID": "R1T1J2WKRPBBSY", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I finally bought a TV because I was tired of watching Movies and TV Shows on my laptop. All I can say is, Wow!! It really makes a difference watching Doctor Who on a 32\" HD screen. If you've only seen your favorite Guilty Pleasure on a 15\" screen, I highly recommend the investment. Just be prepared to spend a month re-watching some of your favorite shows. I cannot speak to the picture quality, other than to say it looks great.I bought this model because of the Smart Hub feature. So far I have not needed to connect it to Cable.Overall I like the Smart Hub features. The Samsung Apps store has a Very Good  (on a scale of Poor to Excellent) selection of Apps. It's not quite the selection you get from Roku, but Samsung does include YouTube, and UStream, which Roku does not at this time. Plus I get the best of both worlds since I have also connected my purple Roku box to HDMI_2.My criticisms of the Smart Hub read more like a wish list.When you first turn on the TV, it takes about 30 seconds to connect to the Smart Hub. This may seem trivial, but it is noticeable after a while.Some of the \"Recommended Apps\" cannot be removed. To name one App I most likely will never use: ESPN ScoreCenter. I'm not into ML sports, and I get all the info I want from friends who are. Also you cannot re-order the apps. I use some more than others, but I cannot re-order them for my preferences.A lot of the Apps are not keyboard-optimized. Netflix, for instance does not allow you to type searches in the search window. All you can do is use the keyboard to arrow between letters and then select them with enter - which is the same thing you can do with the remote.Audio. The audio is somewhat weak in most Apps. The worst is Amazon Instant Video. When I'm watching a Movie, I have to turn the audio up to 60+ in order to hear the dialogue. In most other Apps, 15 to 20 is usually pretty good.Things I do like about Smart Hub:Global Search. If you cannot find a TV Show/Movie in the usual places; Netflix, Amazon Instant Video, Hulu, etc., you can search for it using Samsungs search.Samsung Link. You can connect your Windows PC to your TV using Samsung Link to view Photos, Videos, and Music.Web browser. The browser is actually useable, although it's one of those features I have thus far used only once, since I usually have my laptops, tablet, smartphone, and iPod Touch nearby when I'm watching TV.Samsung's fitness App. I don't use it exactly how it's intended to be used. While I exercise daily, this App is a great place to explore  new exercises, new workouts, and have a virtual partner to do some exercises on days I don't make it to the gym. I did have one problem with this App. When I first used it, it would hang and load videos slowly. I had to add Google Public DNS to my DNS Server List on my router. This took care of the issue. There may be better DNS servers to use - I chose Google because it was the first one I found, and it solved the problem.YouTube has a nice App called YouTube Leanback. This connects your tablet to the TV and allows you to search, play, and control videos from your tablet. It works well, and it is a lot more convenient than using the remote. Are you listening Netflix?One nice thing about Smart Hub is that it's software, so hopefully it will improve over time.", "Date": "June 29, 2013"}, {"Title": "a good tv, DLNA server not great", "Author": "Cherice Evans", "ReviewID": "R21M1A3M1BHMUV", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "This TV has an excellent picture and very good sound.

The longest we have ever gone before we get a message from Netflix on the TV that says \"unable to play that title right now\" is through 2 20-minute episodes of anything.  Then if I go to settings it will say I'm not connected to WiFi, but I am.We are 100% certain it's a software issue with the TV with Netflix.  We will play the exact program, episode, etc at the exact same time with another TV that has Apple TV and without issue. When we get the error, we can click on Amazon app and play movies, further demonstrating the problem is with Samsung and Netflix compatibility issue.We Google'd this - and apparently the Netflix/Samsung issue is a HUGE issue talked about in numerous forums on the internet.Our next step is to call Samsung, but reports are out there that it takes 3-6 hours to get through to their customer service - so I will update as soon as we go that route.Also, TV picture out of the box needs work.  I researched this on the reviews on Amazon and used Gordon's settings.  I believe Gordon reviewed another Samsung TV that was not a SMART TV, but I kept seeing his name come up when people talked about their settings, so I found his review and used his settings.In the meantime, if you are looking for a SMART TV, I would suggest buying a standard TV and buying a Roku - which has roughly the same viewing options as what a SMART TV has.", "Date": "February 9, 2014"}, {"Title": "Too Smart?", "Author": "mstephe51", "ReviewID": "RA8DP5JCTSC0F", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "First the good:The picture was greatThe \"smart\" features were super greatNow the bad:Almost immediately this TV started turning off and on for no apparent reason.

So, I am not specifically saying anything against Samsung. I guess it is the cheap components they ALL are using to save a few pennies. Well, we do that to ourselves by being more focused on price than quality. Here is my suggestion. DON'T buy your TV from an online store.

I had a 5 year old Samsung TV which had the 120hz feature and I specifically wanted a TV that was only 60hz this time around.  The 120hz \"motion plus\" or whatever the feature is called is practically useless.  It makes the movement of the picture \"smoother\" by inserting fake screens using built in processors.  Those screens aren't actually a part of the broadcast, the processors inside create them.  After watching a few minutes with the 120hz feature, I shut it off because everything looked wrong.  It's called the \"soap opera effect\".  It was a useless feature so this TV was perfect for my needs.I've played PS3, PS4, Xbox One, and PC games on this TV and they all look excellent.  This TV also has been rated \"good\" as far as input lag (28ms).  Many HDTVs have much higher input lags.  Please note that input lag has nothing to do with the lag you experience in online games.  You can check the input lags of various TVs at [...]Live broadcasts, Netflix, and other streaming looks excellent also.  My old TV wasn't a Smart TV and I really enjoy having a Smart TV this time.

Some may hate on the type of plastic they use on the outside (because it is glossy and leaves finger prints) but lets be real, how often do we touch our TV to leave those finger prints.  All you need is a simple microfiber cloth to remove those prints.  The one gripe i had with this TV was how it would change the brightness automatically.  This would change even if the light settings wouldnt change.  This was a very easy fix and i just had to play around with the settings.  Another thing I would like to change (if possible) is that everytime i turn on the TV it goes to the smart menu, i would like to just turn on the TV and have it automatically hook up to which source i was using.

I've gone through two standard definition tvs and a spare monitor just for the game. I wanted to to replace tha for 1 hdtv. You wont regret it. This is my first HDTV, tv period that I bought myself. I didn't get it from amazon, but from Best Buy (in store).What a dramatic upgrade, first impressions are astounding.Hooking up the stand to the TV was not a problem if you use the correct screw driver. I'm a noob at tool knowledge so that was a prob, because the size didn't fit, but I received help to use the right one. Manual directions a easy. Let's skip to the good.I have a small box room, and this TV fits perfectly. Use this with an hdmi cable for both the Console and Cable Box. The setup prompt plays a little music when the Tv first turns on and is smexy.going through the setup was easy, excluding wifi if you don't know what you are doing. A little experimenting with the WPS on the router and TV had me up and going. Note that your connection may effect the experiences. I have 4 bar according to the TV, and Apps flow pretty smoothly so far.Apps: An abundance of apps that my appeal to your interests, even a fitness one. Oh, and this TV does have a Web Browser. It works, but the cursor is a bit tedious to move with. It's ok if you don't mind feeling like barebones. Has Amazon, Yotube, HBO, Netflix, Skype, etc.Gaming: Picture quality is amazing with 360's hdmi. If you have been doing research on a good Led tv for Cable and gaming, then look no further. Imput lag is reported to be neglible. Around 30ms. I'm a Halo guy, and with game mode, I still felt some lag. I was just sucking (it was frustrating looking at the tv respond), but WAIT. If you want to reduce that lag, then turn off Dynamic Contrast (or was it eco sensor, both if it's not. Just mess with them). Game mode doesn't turn off everything. With that off, it completely did a 180 and I was sniping domes and 4 shotting fools like I was on my monitor or even better. Anyways what a big sigh of relief. Do not just depend on Game mode, as you will experience imput lag.Sound: Was the least impressing experience, even for my small room. My standard tvs sounded better at times, but you'll put up with it. In some areas the sound is improved. I recommend \"Clear Voice\" for sound mode. It's hard to choose. You could always get speakers, but still the sound is not bad for my room. It just could be much better.TV: Picture quality is great. Recommend movie mode as well and Warm 1 color. I swapped out my standard cable box for an old HD Box that we've had for some time. Might need a new one, because image looks foggy on some channels/choppy or grainy. The HD box I had was used on a Standard box for years. I only found that out recently that a certain someone was using a HD box for a SD TV this whole time -_-. Tis may just be a Cable box Issue, but even then, the problems don't appear frequently at all. The TV itself is an awesome buy for price and value.Magnificent first TV and would recommend to anyone. Had it for about 3 days. 4/5, but since I can't rate that, I will be damn well glad to give it a 5 over a 4.", "Date": "August 17, 2013"}, {"Title": "Expensive for a 32\" TV, but worth the extra cost", "Author": "Josh90", "ReviewID": "RF994BVD77XW8", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I bought this TV at a traditional electronics store after doing some online research and comparing it with other models in the store.  I was a little hung up on the cost of this model; many similarly-sized models sell for much less.  In the store I visited, most 32-inch TVs were selling for about $100 less than the $400 I spent on this one.  I bought it anyway because of the picture quality; this was easily the brightest and most vibrant TV available in this size class.  It may be expensive, but at least it has the picture quality to back up its price tag.  It also has a pretty attractive design; it's extremely thin and has a narrow 0.5\" bezel.  After getting it home, I discovered that it has really impressive sound quality, too--at least for built in speakers.  Great picture and sound quality, wrapped into a thin and  attractive design.  As a simple TV, I doubt there is anything better on the market in this size class and price range.  Despite the 60Hz refresh rate, it even handles Xbox games with ease.The built-in features have left me less impressed.  Samsung boasts that smart TV features are powered by a dual-core processor, and the interface is pretty slick and hums right along without much stutter.  Software has been totally redesigned from last-years models.  The interface is completely different from the year-old 46\" Samsung TV in my living room, and everything looks pretty good and works well.  The cheesy underwater background has been dropped in favor of a simple grid of icons with a monotone background.  It's much more understated and, for the most part, works well.  It even has a built-in channel guide, which is nice since I don't have a cable box in the bedroom this is going in.  Unfortunately, some of the web apps need work.  Hulu and Netflix load quickly and have smooth playback with high-definition picture quality, but the very first show I streamed stopped right in the middle with a playback error message.  This has been a problem with my living room TV as well.  It doesn't happen all the time, just often enough to be annoying.  It's clear that Samsung doesn't use the best WiFi chipsets in their TVs.  I loaded SpeedTest.net using the built-in browser, and it recorded a maximum download speed of just 2.63 Mb/s downstream.  After it was done, I turned on my MacBook and recorded 13.93 Mb/s downstream.  The slow WiFi chip is probably a big part of the problem.  I told Hulu to retry a couple of times, and eventually encountered a critical error that made me restart the app.  I unplugged and restarted the TV, and encountered the same error message after about ten minutes of streaming in Hulu.  The router is only about 15-20 feet away, so I don't see what the problem is when a laptop does just fine at the same distance.  For the record, I haven't had any of these issues when streaming content with an Apple TV or Xbox 360.  This isn't a huge deal, but these are expensive TVs given their size.The bottom line is that this is a truly excellent TV, it's just not very good at streaming content.  You could certainly get something bigger for the price, but this size is just about perfect for a bedroom.

There were some snags at first with apps not working and my wifi info getting reset, but there were a couple updates that got released along the way and it seems to have cleared up my remaining issues. I ended up getting an ethernet cable to run it directly to my router since the wifi would slow down a bit here and there. I'm not sure if that's a wireless card issue in the TV or an ISP issue. Wired internet works great though.I also bought this TV to work as a monitor for my computer. When I want to watch Netflix, Hulu or Amazon I will just use the TV to save electricity. But it's nice having it function as a monitor as well so when I have movies not on the streaming sites, or if I need to print something, I can just switch to the PC source real quick.

Firstly the picture quality is top notch. Regular TV as well as streamed videos (which of course depend on your internet connection speed) all come up looking very good. I attribute the quality of streamed videos looking good to a good wifi adapter in the TV. Other TVs flake here leading to choppy and interrupted viewing which I hate!The design is also very slick. Looks very sophisticated, and goes well with my urban themed bedroom.Something I love about this TV is that it includes Samsung\u2019s Smart TV suite. It is very good, and I believe based on a dual core processor. This means navigation is very fast (my other TV although costing far more has slower navigation).The sound quality is also decent. You won\u2019t be winning any bass competitions, but perfectly suited to a bedroom environment.

Meanwhile we ordered the bigger 46 inch one on prime. We didn't get a brand new one but decided to go for a \"used-like new\" TV from Amazon Warehouse. It arrived in an Amazon carton instead of a Samsung one but was shining like new with the screen protector and all other coverings/ stickers/ accessories! It was very easy to set up and synchronize with different accounts like amazon prime / netflix etc.. These two have a dedicated button on the remote control too. But there are dozens of other apps as well, even skype / FB etc. The picture quality is very good. Sound is kind of okay-ish. You might want to consider external speakers. Anything played on TV sounds fine but if you're streaming something from laptop connected via HDMI then it can be a little bothersome finding the perfect video with a loud enough sound.

Both TV's are super slim and very good looking on the wall mount.Now for the kicker, the price on my 58 inch was $900.  This 50 inch Samsung was $770.  While I plan to keep the Samsung, if I could do it all over again, the Panasonic is my solid choice.  To me its just a better TV in just about every thing I can compare.

Gradually, the problem increased dramatically to the point where it would turn off and on repeatedly so often that it became unusable for all practical purposes.In researching my specific problem, I learned that hard drive failures are a common problem with Samsung TV's as well as some other manufacturers. Since the TV is still within the manufacturer's one year warranty, Samsung has arranged for an in-home repair. I'm hopeful that once the part is replaced tomorrow, the issue will be permanently resolved.My last TV was an old fashioned analog that served me well for more than 20 years. While, I know that electronics and other consumer products are not made to last as long as they used to, I certainly didn't expect the TV to become unusable and require parts replacement within 6 months of purchase.Frankly, I'm not sure I would recommend this model of LED TV until I felt confident that Samsung had permanently resolved its long standing issue with sudden and catastrophic equipment failure.Updated 5/17/14:My TV was repaired, at Samsung's expense, by a United Service Source, Inc.(USSI) sub-contractor who installed a new mainboard.

The choice was made, based on very positive reviews here and on Best Buy, to replace a smaller bedroom TV. So far its a great TV but there 3 things that keep me from giving it a great rating; 1)Don't like the cross stand - is not as steady as my other traditional stands and it tends to draw the eye down toward it (do appreciate swivel) 2) Stand assembly; it has 8 tiny screws; 4 go in the base that goes together and the other 4 bolts TV to stand.  The latter were easy to install as there were threads in the TV holes.  HOWEVER, putting the 2 piece stand together, which should have taken two minutes, took an hour because I had to drive to a friend's home to borrow a power screwdriver because there were no threads in the stand holes(w/extender due to design - I have assembled many other TVs). 3) The quick set up guide and manual are not detailed enough except for the remote page. My old red, white, and yellow attachment (can't remember if its video or audio) did not match their colors - think it was blue or green instead of one color (guess its ok as I can see it and hear it :) In fact Samsung has several U-tube how to videos for stand assembly and all indicate its a snap (as I was looking I found one written summary that said extra torque was needed (but no reviews even mentioned stand assembly): I had to get a magnifying glass out to read the labels on the different HDMI ports etc. (online support section was not helpful).

Also the Netflix app continuously drops sound and you have to back out and restart the video to regain sound. This happens at random but only on the Netflix app. Sent tv back for replacement.2nd tv: received second replacement tv and installed it. Immediately notice another pixel out in the top right of screen.  Back to amazon!3rd Tv: Received and installed immediately noticed a whole cluster of pixels out in middle of screen (5-6) out. And Netflix app still drops sound. Finally called amazon to see if other customers were receiving similar TVs with issues like mine. Amazon customer service very good and upgraded our tv model to the un40f6300 for free.4th Tv: Received (over night) as with the third tv. Installed turned on the new upgraded model and yes a pixel was out in the top right corner. Also the Netflix app still drops sound all the time.In the end, we decided to keep the 4 th tv and live with the out pixel. I believe may TVs coming out today have this issue, but many don't notice. When I visited best buy to see other comp models, I again notice out pixels on many of the brand new TVs. I just think quality control is no existent and nobody really complains or notices. Both Samsung and Netflix blame each other for the sound issue. But it is a Samsung problem, Netflix works on ten other devices in my house just fine.So if you do receive a brand new tv with an out pixel, please return it, it's very easy to do so with amazon. I figure with the shipping back and forth of 7 TVs, amazon is out over $1k in shipping.

Crowley \"mmcjprof\"", "ReviewID": "R1XF0FVWYKW91S", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "I got this on sale at a local big box store on a special sale.  I have had Samsung electronics in the past.  This looked great--50 inch wifi, smart tv.  What's not to like?I have called support once and chatted with them three times in two days.  The manual is useless. Out of the box, the TV needs to have a software upgrade.  (Over a high speed connection, the download took 20 minutes.) Software upgrades are not unusual, but the setup does not direct you to set up your network connection and then upgrade the software.  The good news?  Once upgraded, I could connect to Netflix.  The bad news?  I can't seem to connect to other services.  Also, it drops the signal a lot.There are no explanations of the connectors on the back of the TV.  I am hearing impaired, so I use wireless headphones. They worked fine with my old Samsung.  This model does not have RCA connectors (even though their website shows a picture of RCA connectors).  It has only a 3.5mm connector.  The only solution was to buy another connector cable. If you go to the online manual and search for headphones, you get no hits, by the way.The box says wifi in big letters on the front.  However, it's rudimentary.  The TV has no bluetooth capability.  Worse, it does not work with a wireless keyboard.  Why anyone would want to have a wired keyboard connected to a 50 inch TV? If you sit close enough for the keyboard cable to reach, you are too close to the screen.  Every cheap PC can use wireless keyboard.  Sadly, only Samsung TV's from model numbers 6400 and higher can work with a wireless keyboard.  If you can't use a keyboard, entering information (movie or tv titles, etc) has to be done with the arrow keys on the on screen keyboard.  It's at best cumbersome.In the first two of my three online support chats, I mentioned wanting to use a wireless keyboard, and both times they indicated that it was possible.  After the second chat, I bought a new one first checking that it was HID capable. It was only on the third chat that the consultant revealed that the TV did not have the required capability.  I could use a WIRED HID keyboard.So far I have not been able to get the universal remote to work with my set top satellite box, or with my Samsung Blue Ray DVD player.  In fact, to turn on the TV I now have to use both the Samsung remote and the satellite remote. This TV has a list price of $1300.  I do not see any reason that such an expensive piece of electronics would be so firmly mired in the previous century. I am right on the edge of returning it to the store, sale or no sale.

Don't waste your time or money on Samsung's ridiculous excuse of a smart TV or Blu-ray player; you will regret it. I am very satisfied with my high end Sony blu-ray player and the Sony Homestream server. Additionally, I just noticed a banner on the TV today that says they are discontinuing paid apps on the TV.

If you have an Xbox with a 3-point component cable--this monitor needs 5, and you can only plug one device in at a time--you will have to play your games in black and white. I only use the TV for video games, so it's in my best interest to have a cheaper, low tech monitor if it means I can actually have color--the one upstairs is years older, with more component ports, easier access, better quality and almost idiot-proof.

I was never able to get as far as seeing the app menu or anything great like that.  Just continued to receive the error message indicated in my original reivew.The SolutionSamsung Customer Service(no help)I first tried to speak to the Samsung customer service folks, and I received no help at all.  To be honest, I could tell they were reading from a script.  I spoke to three different reps and they all used the same words and sentences.  Oh well.  I still give Samsung Customer Service zero stars, but it isn't their fault.  You can tell they have no knowledge of troubleshooting other than what is on the screen in front of them.My ISP (problem resolved)I was able to speak to a tech guy with my ISP.  He said that he was aware of this issue with other Samsung Smart TVs (not sure if it is just my ISP's compatibility with said TV or simply a problem inherent to Samsung TVs).  The solution was to change from a Dynamic IP Address to a Static IP Address.  That was it.  Problem solved.  Samsung never even suggested this solution.MY NEW REVIEWI love this TV - it is SO FUN!  I downloaded the screen-mirror app onto all of my ipads (iPad Mini, iPad Air, & iPad 3) and we are loving it!!!  This is probably one of the coolest features.  I now have a mini-television wherever I want it (bathtub, kitchen, garage, deck, etc).  So COOL!!!  And of course - access to Netflix and Amazon (my go-to apps) are awesome!  The remote control has a button to quickly get there without a lot of hupla.  Love that so much!!!  The image itself is simply beautiful.  I really bought this product for the \"smart\" features, so that is my focus for now.  I haven't really been able to do much with the browser...I think i need a wireless keyboard to really use that to it's fullest extent.Anyway - my apologies for the first review.  I jumped the gun.

After the one year warranty period SAMSUNG Television screens tend to show burn-in and ghosting with horizontal lines, along with very heavy distortion of picture on right side of screen.

There are even numerous Youtube postings with the exact same problems as in my DEFECTIVE SAMSUNG model, as well as the same DEFECT in many other DEFECTIVE SAMUNG models.  This defect occurs upon start-up, and lasts for the first 15 minutes of trying to view a program. Then the picture gets progressively worse over time and continuously declines.I tried SAMSUNG's Executive Customer Relations Dept. and was told:  \"We will do nothing but refer you to a local Authorized Repair Shop.\"  They were downright blunt and rude to boot!  I feel robbed of $2,900.00!Furthermore, I was informed that the repair will consist of a diagnosis visit, and then another visit to install a replacement \"Panel\" that costs $1,300.00 for the part plus $279.00 to install, plus taxes......all told, another $1,719.16....at which point the technician basically stated, \"just buy another TV.\"SAMSUNG customer service also told me that their Televisions depreciate at a rate of 20% per year, and that they do not repair any of their products after 4 years!  Their own repair people told me to just buy a new set!!!If I save one family the heartache of losing they're hard-earned money on SYSTEMICALLY DEFECTIVE SAMSUNG TELEVISIONS, and a company that offers zero customer service....I'll be happy!

I do with Amazon Instant Video and Amazon Cloud Service. Both with apps. pre-installed on this TV.  I will cut to the chase and give you the latest correspondence with Amazon Customer service.Comments: I have had an ongoing problem (since 7/27/13) the day I received my new Samsung smart TV from Amazon. It won't register to Amazon streaming video or Amazon cloud. All other apps. work perfectly. I have no trouble what so ever with Netflix streaming.  After several phone conversations and e-mails, Amazon has admitted that the problem is theirs and they are working on it. It has been near six weeks and nothing has changed on this problem. ( \"as of 8/24/13 it is now 9/1/13\")  Amazon has misrepresented this TV as working with it's services. I'm paying for a service I can't use on a device sold to me by Amazon and represented as working with your pre-installed apps. on it.  I have been ignored by your so called customer service for far to long now. I rate them less then zero. I don't need any more delays or non action from a outsourced customer service  rep. in South Africa.  I'm going to do everything I can to escalate this complaint to the highest source I can It seems that Amazon Customer Service is trying to hide this problem, ignore it or both.  Here is their response dated 8/24/13 I'm extremely sorry to hear about the issue you are facing Samsung TV to your account.

Big mistake. Somehow I missed the part where they tell you that Samsung is not compatible with Mac computers. This means that some functions are not available to me--I cannot show photos from my computer on my TV because there is no Samsung app to support this. I e-mailed Samsung and they said they are \"working on\" a Mac app. In addition, I cannot stream Netflix. The TV constantly drops the network connection. I have spent untold hours with my internet provider and verified that it is not an internet provider problem. I \"chatted\" with Samsung who suggested some extensive additional wiring. I have since found on the internet that this is a common problem with Samsung TVs. I just wanted a TV that I could plug in, Amazon would help me with the set-up and I would be good to go.

The blacks are shockingly black and the sunny scenes make your eyes hurt with squinting.  Its the best picture I've ever seen. But it too easily blurs the line between reality and fantasy but providing such a convincing illusion that near complete submersion in non-reality is a strong possibility and even a probability that is harmful to human nature and good judgement.  This TV causes one to be convinced that magical thinking might actually be a reasonable approach to daily living.  The TV seems more real at times than looking out a window.  Not recommended.

When it just got off warranty it started having some issues with image. You can find a lot of complaints if you ggle 'horizontal lines and ghosting samsung'. Apparently the problem is created by samsung, to save some money, making a decision to put cheap chinese parts in their tvs that deteriorate very quickly, within ~1-2 years. This is perfectly timed with their warranty period. So if you do not want to buy a new $1K tv every two years do not buy this product.
