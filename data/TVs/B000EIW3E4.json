I finally decided plasma over DLP because of the vertical fading effect I saw with all the DLP sets. I took two of my own DVDs in to the store with me and made the staff there hook up a player so I could see both the fast action of The Matrix and the beautiful scenery of Spring, Summmer, Fall, Winter, Spring.  The picture on the Samsung HP-S5053 was the second best of the many plasmas that I examined. The Pioneer had a better picture but was significantly more expensive.  I do not use the built in speakers because I had an existing 5.1 speaker system.  I really like the  minimal black casing since the silver finishes are distracting-at least to my eye.  The menus are extremely intuitive.  I didn't have to read the instructions at all to get anything working within an hour of unpacking my system.  I purchased an upconverting DVD player and an HDMI cable at the same time I purchased this TV.  My old DVDs look great on this TV.  The 10-15 HD channels I get with Cox cable also look incredible.  The one fault I've found is that if I use the HDMI cable from my cable box or DVD player and connect to the TV and then connect the digital audio out of the TV to my receiver I only receive stereo sound even when the original broadcast is 5.1.  I get around this by using composite video cables from the cable box and DVD player to the HPS5053 and also run a digital audio line from each source to the receiver.  The HPS5053 has plenty of inputs to support almost any type of user.", "Date": "October 15, 2006"}, {"Title": "The best 50 inch plasma at the best price", "Author": "Richard S", "ReviewID": "R293IU9DF3VZGK", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I sent a month reading reviews and in circuit city and best buy looking at plasmas.

Underwood", "ReviewID": "R1PTH51L13X8OI", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "After spending much time reading reviews and spending hours at the local Magnolia home theater center seeing the displays for myself and playing with the different picture settings and functions, I finally decided on the Samsung HP-S5053 over the Pioneer PDP-5070HD and Panasonic TH-50PX600u. My decision was based primarily on Picture Quality and overall value of the display.Picture quality on the s5030 is simply amazing and in my opinion better than the Panasonic 50px600u and the Pioneer 5070. Panasonic's black level clarity is superior, but the s5030 comes very close, especially with the ability to turn off the DNIe function, and has superior image clarity overall. The Pioneer has great clarity, but a much softer picture overall than the s5030 which provides very sharp and detailed images. Overall, the picture quality is truly stunning and deserves recognition as one of the top plasma displays in this respect. With HD service the detail is unbelievable, whether it be watching sports on ESPNHD or Discovery Theater. I've had the s5053 for 2 months now and the picture just seems to get better and better. I'm 110% satisfied in this respect.In addition to the amazing picture quality, the display it self looks very nice. The piano black finish makes the s5053 look great even when it's not turned on. A huge advantage over the Panasonic's ugly silver cabinet on the 50px600u.The s5053 also had a lot of other features that made the decision easy. The built in tuner, pip, built-in hidden truSurround speakers, pc imput, 2 hdmi input, DNIe, advanced 13-bit processing (549 billion colors compared to a max 29 billion for Panasonic and just over 1 billion for Pioneer), anti-glare filter, and especially the pixel-shift feature (to prevent screen burn-in) were all superior features that made the s5053 an exceptional value.You may read negative reviews based on buzzing and shipping issues, but don't let this discourage you from purchasing this tv. The buzzing issue has been isolated to a limited run of s5053 with an August 06 Mexico manufacture date/location. The good thing is that most of these have already been distributed and replaced, and my unit was buzz free. The shipping issues with screen damage should also not discourage you from buying this display, because lets face it, sometimes things get damaged during shipment due to mishandling or various accidents. My display arrived ahead of schedule and in perfect condition.Overall the Samsung HP-S5053 is a terrific all-around package. You get superior picture quality, a great set of features, and most importantly a great value compared to the other plasma displays in the same top tier. I would highly recommend this unit based on my own extremely positive experience thus far.", "Date": "November 17, 2006"}, {"Title": "I feel lucky!", "Author": "R.

Inspite of Thanksgiving Day Holidays my TV arrived on the earliest possible date of schedule Nov 27 (Nov 27-Dec 13). The value of shipping Standart Ground was $78, but Amazon discounted it for me down to $0. On the moment of purchase the price of my TV was $2069, and after a three days it went down to $2019, when I called Amazon they immediatelly returned $50 bucks on my credit card. Little unexpected bonus. Customer servise in general is very helpfull. Ordering this TV from Amazon, I literally saved $800 compared to BestBuy and CircuitCity. No tax and free shipping you have got nothing to lose.Delivery \"Eagle\" guys always made calls prior to delivery, initially it was scheduled for delivery at 10 am, but since they were running late waiting for some customers, they called me again and said about it. When delivered, they connected and installed TV without even asking.TV looks fantastic, the image is great. I wanted to buy this TV for a long time. Two reviews made me worry by talking about buzzing noise coming from the back of the screen, well in my case, nothing was standing out. Just like every other plasma TV. May be one guy was unlucky, but the other guy's review history showed there was not a single good review there. If you are thinking of purchasing this TV, go for it.

I was aware of the buzzing problem that seemed to occur with some units but took the chance. Eagle delivered within about 5 days (standard shipping!). Unfortunately, there was the buzzing from the first start up which is constant and seems to come from the left and right top of the housing. It is definitely not the cooling fan as described elsewhere. Anyways, the buzzing was loud enough to be annoying in quieter scenes from a normal viewing distance. Sad, because I otherwise really liked the TV and the picture quality with my up-converting DVD player was great.I contacted Amazon about this problem.

We bought it at Best Buy and to return the 42 inch and get a 50 inch meant spending over $1,000 more.  A big gap.  We went to Amazon and the difference was only $400 more, plus free shipping and no sales tax.  EGL was the shipper and fortunately the unit was shipping from the city I live in which is Dallas.  I tracked to EGL and after talking with them, they brought to me the same day (imagine that).  Not only did the shipper open the box to inspect the product, but insisted we plug it up to see that it worked OK.So I plugged it up and connected it to the DirectTV HD receiver and went through a setup routine with the delivery man assisting.  Within 5 minutes we had the unit fully functional with the receiver and the Samsung unit worked flawlessly.  Then the shipper hauled away the box.  A nice service touch.  The unit is great overall with only very minor viewing glitches when very dark screens are presented, the colors don't come out exactly right. But that is an infrequent occurence and it's trivial.  The pictures, particularly the HDTV are beautiful in color, and contrast, brightness and resolution.  The controls are simple (which is no small feat given the various options) and any control is accessible through the remote including 'short cuts' to display options.

I was very nervous about this so called buzzing noise, but I took a chance anyway. I purchased the tv from Circuit City because they had the best deal at the time. Yes, right out the box when I first powered the tv up, there was a very loud and annoying buzzing sound. I was sitting about 11 feet away from the tv and the noise was very audible when watching a quiet scene in a movie. My heart was crushed, because the picture on this tv is UNBELIEVEABLE!!! I hooked up a Sony HDMI upconvert dvd player and the picture quality on a movie is just to die for. I called Samsung to complain about the buzzing sound and a technician came to look into the problem. I'm very happy to say that Samsung has finally seemed to isolate this buzzing problem with this particular 50\" model. Two guys showed up and explained to me that they would be lowering the voltage on my plasma tv. They went on to assure me that this would in no way affect the performance of the tv. They unscrewed the back panel and tinkered with the motherboard to lower the voltage current in two specific areas. After that they pulled out some special adhesive strips and taped them onto certain areas of the back panel. They put it all back together and PRESTO!!!! The buzzing sound was reduced to almost nothing. It seems that they really know what they are doing now in regards to this problem. Now, I'm enjoying my tv to the fullest. I have yet to receive my Direct tv package, so I can take advantage of the HD content. You heard it from me. Samsung is GREAT! The two technicians that came over were just awesome and they seemed to know exactly what they were doing. I would say they were at my place for no more than 35 minutes.

As others have reported I was very pleased with the picture and other elements of this product.The other day the TV just died. No problem, I thought. It's still under warranty. I can call them, and they'll send out someone to repair it. I called Samsung support, and they created a repair ticket. They said they would call me back when their service locator was available. That took two days....a little irritating that it took that long to get me the name of a service center in my area that could perform the work, but it was nothing compared to the frustration to follow.I called the service center to setup an appointment for the technician to come out, but they said \"sorry, you are out of our service area. We can't come out.\" I called Samsung support back and asked for a service center in my area. They stated there weren't any. HUH??? I live 25 miles outside of the 8th largest city in the U.S. (San Diego) and the only service center in my area is 60 miles outside of San Diego proper? That didn't seem right, so I called again and had another support person check. No....that is the closest one, and did I mention they don't service my area!!! The only recourse Samsung was able to offer was they would have to submit paperwork to get \"executive approval\" to have someone from the service center sent out for the repair. This would take 7 to 10 BUSINESS DAYS. Are you f@!*%$$& kidding me!!!??? That is completely unacceptable. I can't imagine any company having the arrogance to suggest such a thing to a customer...\"sure, we'll get back to you in a couple of weeks.\" No thanks, I think I'll take my business elsewhere. I immediately asked to speak with someone higher up to get this problem escalated. The support person connected me with Executive level support, but they were just as ineffectual, saying the best they could do was to mark the request as urgent. I think we know how much that is going to change things.Obviously, Samsung has a process that is almost completely broken. To make a customer wait up to two weeks to have a repair ticket approved is mind numbingly ridiculous. Add to that the time it may take to complete the repair, and it could conceivably add up to three weeks or more. This is what I spent $2,400 for?

The standard digital cable images are OK but in older shows (my kids watch Full House, Brady Bunch, etc.) you can see the pixels and its a bit fuzzy. That is partly due to the fact that we are sitting 9 feet from a 50\" screen and gets better as you move back in the room.

You can hear it until you turn the sound up to the mid-20s.  I called customer service and the guy was less than helpful.  Said a buzzing was normal and if the noise level of 18-20 covered it, there was no defect.  And any salesperson or web site should notify customers that this TV has a buzz.

He couldn't tell us how much it was, just that it was pretty expensive. (This is not my idea of impressive customer service attitude).  We asked to have the service guy call before he came out.  He called 2 days later and said he thought some fan would have to be replaced since he had been doing a lot of those repairs.

I bought this from Amazon, it had the best price I could find, and it also included the free shipping.  My wife even loves the TV.I think I'm like most people, I just want a big TV with a nice picture.  I'm not into all the techie stuff, so I can't comment about all the do-hickies that do or don't connect to it.  All I know is when I plugged it in and connected it to cable, it looks fantastic.  Watching a Hi-Def sporting event on my Samsung is absolutely gorgeous!  The screen is much brigher and the colors more vibrant than my old rear-projection TV.  I mounted mine on the wall and was suprised at how much bigger the room feels vs. having my old rear projection TV.I did a ton of research about plasma and lcd TVs.  My conclusion was, as long as I get a brand that I've heard of the picture would be good enough.  The people that talk about how deep the blacks are and it being just a little warm, and...  These people must have supersonic eyes, 'cause when I went to the local Fry's, they had them all lined up and I couldn't tell the difference AT ALL; and I've had Lasik surgery!  I'd love to bet one of these video nuts whether they could tell the difference.  Cover up the brand and make them pick out which is the more expensive model.  I'll bet they're right only 50% of the time, they would be totally guessing.So, I was very close to buying one of the Vizio TVs.  They have very good reviews on Cnet.  Then I found this on Amazon for only about $200 more.  With the free shipping and no tax, it was almost a wash.  What swayed me to the Samsung and what I like most about the it is the look of the TV around the picture.  It has a high gloss, black piano finish with a very small silver stripe at the bottom.  The silver is not that noticeable because it is recessed and on an angle.  A friend of mine has a 50\" plasma with a silver casing around the picture and I think the black looks much better, especially with the piano finish.  He also agreed with me when he came over to my house.  This TV has the \"Wow\" factor.Bottom Line:  At the price Amazon is selling this for, along with the free shipping; I think this is by far the best deal for the average person looking for a 50\" TV.", "Date": "February 2, 2007"}, {"Title": "Excellent experience & a great TV all the way around.", "Author": "Kenneth E.

Amazon claims there's a glitch in their system which won't allow me to leave feedback for this company, so this is my only means of doing so. Here's the story:First, understand that my wife and I have been Amazon customers for over 2 years.After 15 days of waiting, 9 phone calls to LCDMART, and 3 phone calls to Amazon, I finally cancelled the order for my plasma screen through Amazon.The SAME day I cancelled the order, I FINALLY received a call from LCDMART and the representative told me that I'd receive my TV within 3 business days, and that he was emailing me a tracking number. He claimed that Amazon takes 10 business days to submit orders to his company...from experience, I find that very hard to believe. I waited until the following day, and not having received my tracking number, I called yet again, and was told by John at LCDMART that he was emailing me a tracking number immediately. I did not receive it, so I called YET AGAIN, and was told that I would not receive a tracking number until the following day. I asked \"How can I receive the TV by tomorrow if you don't have a tracking number today?\" I then asked when I would receive the TV. I was told, \"I don't know.\"I asked to cancel my order, and the representative for LCDMART said, \"No. I can't cancel your order.\" I repeat, he said, \"NO!\"After a few choice words, and my persistent demand that my order be cancelled, he put me on hold, then told me my order was cancelled.This company is doing Amazon a great disservice, and is damaging its reputation. LCDMART did not return a single phone message, or email inquiry.I'm sure LCDMART will find some reason to make me look like an unreasonable customer, but read the reviews...I'm not the first to experience this, and this \"feedback bug\" appears to have been in effect since 5/2007, so NO feedback, negative or positive, has been submitted to this company since then.Buy the product, you'll be happy.

I think that this TV is simply the best choice in the 50\" plasma range.  Sure you could squeeze a little more detail in blacks with the Pioneer, but the extra $800 you're going to spend just isn't worth it.  I also really enjoy pixel shift and whitewash (burn in features)  I think pixel shift really helps to reduce direct line burn ins, and the whitewash does a great job of removing anything that is left behind (I've seen some burn-in left behind from xbox360 as well as anamorphic programming.)  I was very impressed by this model's ability to handle SD programming.  I have my motorola 6400 box from Comcast set to stretch SD 4:3 programming into 16:9, and the Samsung displays it very well.  So long as you are at the proper viewing distance it looks just fine, no quality loss over a standard CRT.  This whole experience of finally buying and HDTV has been great, and my only problems are with the programming available.  We all know that it will be a while before there are a bunch of HD channels available, but until then I just hope that movies stop being released in anamorphic widescreen.  Before the TV came in I DVR'd 4 star wars movies in HD, only to be disappointed to find out that George Lucas apparently thinks that there is a reason to record in anamorphic widescreen.  For those of you who don't know what it is, its a different aspect ratio which will leave you with black bars on the top and bottom of your screen.  Very, very annoying, especially when the plasma is in the break-in period and more susceptible to burn in of the lines.  Anyways that's my little rant on anamorphic programming, but bottom line is this TV is great, I couldn't possibly be more satisfied.

The exact same model tv at Best Buy was \"on sale\" for $2659, not including an additional $140 of tax.  Dilevery would be an additional cost as well.

The buzzing is my only complaint, but its so faint that over time it becomes unoticable.  From my research, the noise is coming from the plasma jets that shoot the electrons into  the gas, generating the picture.  Samsung even puts a caveat in the owner manual that this TV will not run silently and a slight buzzing sound is considered normal. Again, thats my only gripe about it.

I thought I would take a chance anyway, because the price was pretty much too hard to beat.  Well, the buzz was there right from the start and still is a constant annoyance.

Needless to say, we did call Samsung and they will be sending someone out to look at the tv next week.I do know 2 others who have the 42-inch Samsung and there is no buzz at all with their tv's.I should also note that we are using the stand on a tv table, and it is about 1 foot from the wall.  We do not have a surround sound system or any other speaker system hooked up yet so we are only using the built in speakers.

It's sleek and classy, and I can't wait to get it hung above my fireplace. Colors are so vibrant and even skin color on this plasma is pretty close to looking normal.

Just make sure you have all the right stuff", "Author": "Dmitry Glozman", "ReviewID": "R1557D4MVITBEE", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Excellent TV! After doing a lot of research and comparison I decided to go with Samsung 5053 model and I'm really happy with my decision.No buzzing sound of any kind. My TV was made on 10/2006 on Mexico. I think the major mistake people do is not buying extra stuff that are really necessary.First, if you spend $2000+ on TV, please invest a little more into HDMI cable (can be bought for $15, and there is no need for Monster HDMI brand that cost $90+).I compared them (Monster and other no brand cable) and there is NO difference what so ever.Second, you need to get a High Definition receiver from your cable/dish company that have an HDMI output. I have Cablevision and I got DVR box with HDMI output from them. If you want to see high resolution picture you MUST get a High Definition receiver otherwise you will not get the same picture you see in the store.Actually you will get a BETTER picture then in the store because most of the stores do not use HDMI cables.And the last thing THE MOST IMPORTANT ONE since the biggest problem for most of the people in reviews below is BUZZING sound, is to get a noise reducer / surge protector.This thing is a MUST HAVE, if you do not want to have buzzing problems like many people have. I got Belkin PureAV 10 Outlet Isolator, but there are other brands available like Monster. It DOES reduce any unnecessary noise and IMPROVE your picture and sound. In this case I would recommend to spend a little extra and get a good quality isolator instead of the unknown brand model since it does make a difference (unlike HDMI cable)Also make sure your cable is also connected to Isolator first before it goes to TV.All I can say that I have a BETTER picture that most of the stores have, and HDTV channels are breathtaking! I just wish my cable company provided more channels in high resolution. One thing that stand Samsung apart from most of the other plasma brands is the quality of Analog channels. On my TV they look even BETTER then on regular CRT TVs! The only difference since they are displayed in 16:9 format, the picture is a little wider then normal but it is barely noticeable.Also make sure you set up you cable box properly, so it would up convert all 1080i signals when you switch to HDTV channel and go back to 480i when you switch to Analog channels. This way you will not have to constantly change setting in order to get rid of side bars that all Analog channels have when viewed on 16:9 format TV.I'm not sure how it is done with other cable providers but in Cablevision it is really simple: you just make only 1080i and 480i formats available and for picture format option choose \"Auto DVI/HDMI\"Also you might want to get something like \"The AVIA Guide to Home Theater DVD\" (sold here on Amazon for $39). It will help you to calibrate your picture settings. I did not purchase it since I think that my picture is already amazing, but I know few people who did and it help them significantly improve their picture (contrast, color, sharpness, etc).So overall I'm very happy with this TV an I do not think there are anything better available within this price range and even Pioneer Elite (for around $6000) is not noticeably better.", "Date": "January 30, 2007"}, {"Title": "BUUUUZZZZZZZZZZ!!!!!!!", "Author": "J.

I did lots of shopping... well over 4 weeks of going to stores and playing with the settings in a lot of them; and there are a couple of issues to be aware of.  One is that when you are using the 4:3 mode on the TV to view 4:3 content the sidebars are silver... which is annoying and cant be changed... HOWEVER, if you use an HD-upconverter type DVD player with HDMI that goes away since aspect is changed by the DVD player.  The other issue is that its only 1080i, which frankly is not a big deal, especially considering most HDTV this large under $5000 are as well.  I was borrowing a 42\" 3rd generation Dell plasma with about a 4000:1 contrast ratio from my company while i was shopping, and was really unhappy with the muddiness of darker onscreen areas of that tv, but I have to say this one looks GREAT.  You can notice some muddiness if you have your contrast set too low and the picture quality of the DVD is poorly lit, buuuut honestly I keep mine set around 55% and it looks awesome.  Of course with a plasma you dont want the contrast set to high if you want it to last longer and always avoid falling asleep to a dvd menu if you want to avoid burn in, but if you accidentally fall asleep (i did), it comes with a burn in erasing rolling pattern which is a really big comfort to the mind.  Not to mention its a very sexy piece of furniture when not on.  I can't speak for its sound system, because if you are spending 3 grand on a tv, you really should have a nice sound system and mute the tv anyway.  I would recommend buying a plasma from a local appliance store for quite a few reasons... but chief among them people on here seem to be getting them smashed in transit frequently, which a local store is not going to let happen, and if it DID happen, you would avoid the nightmare I'm sure that has got to be.  The only TV I saw that compared to this one was a Panasonic that was running over $1500 more expensive, and it did look nicer... but only about 100 dollars nicer.  Of course there is a certain subjectivity to this, but if you read about non-defeatable DNIE or whatever and are nervous about this set, simply go out to somewhere they have them and play with the features and settings.  The people that complain about this seem to not be going through the options.

The delivery guy packed it back up and now I have to reorder it, wait for a credit to my account, wait another 2 weeks for delivery.  Not the best situation to save a few hundred $$.  At least Amazon should send another TV by express and not make me reorder it and wait 2 more weeks and have the change of another damaged TV.", "Date": "September 29, 2006"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": null, "Features": null, "Name": null, "ImgURL": null, "ProductID": "B000EIW3E4"}}
