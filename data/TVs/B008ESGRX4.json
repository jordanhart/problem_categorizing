You feel like you are losing horizontalpicture. Truth is your not.This set takes a little getting use to. Its by far the mostbeautiful/stylish set ive seen to date.The picture itself is gorgeous. Crisp, detailed and it pops.Where this set excels is watching blu ray movies.Take a good look at this set if your in the market.Its that good!", "Date": "November 16, 2012"}, {"Title": "properly displaying extra wide films", "Author": "Doug M", "ReviewID": "R370BTDPSKLRMW", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Thanks to a helpful comment from Joseph L on the Amazon review by Bobby Player, I have been experimenting with the Picture Size controls and have found a way to achieve the proper display of films formatted wider than 2.40:1.  In the Automatic mode, some films formatted wider than 2.40:1 aren't properly detected by the TV and display window boxed and letter boxed in the 16X9 frame, making them look pretty small. This shortcoming has been noted by many professional reviews, including Consumer Reports, CNET and others, but I've not found a description of how to overcome it, so will offer this solution here.In the \"Wide\" menu, select either ZOOM 1 or AUTO STRETCH.  That should cause the movie to horizontally fill the 21:9 screen.  Then, go into the PICTURE settings, choose \"More\" at the bottom of the list on the first page, and find the Size & Position settings.  Use Vertical Size to achieve the proper geometry--I've found that a setting of between + 75 to +80 seems about right.  I used the geometry pattern on the test disc Video Essentials HD Basics, as well as several movies to determine the range of settings, but your own eyes may lead you to apply more or less vertical stretch--there is lots of range to work with.  I find pausing the picture and looking at a still frame much easier to judge than moving images.  Don't forget to put the Vertical Size control back to 0  and the Wide control back to automatic when you're done watching the film--otherwise whatever you watch next will look distorted.Note that this applies to an input of 1080p--usually even a regular DVD is upscaled to that resolution in the player.  I don't know if this would work if the TV were fed a 480i or 480p signal directly, or with broadcast TV signals.  I don't know that it wouldn't--I just haven't tried.Sometimes the TV will properly display an extra wide movie in the Auto mode--mine displays the How the West Was Won Blu-ray (2.89:1) like a champ--and even displays the \"Smilebox\" version with the corners cut off, but across the full screen.  But Its a Mad, Mad, Mad, Mad World  ( 2.55:1) just parks in the middle and looks small until I apply the correction.  The standard def. DVD of Oklahoma has a Cinemascope version  ( 2.55:1) that also won't display properly until the correction is applied.  On the other hand, the standard def. A Star Is Born (approx. 2.55:1) displays properly without the added correction.I hope this is of some assistance to other owners of this television who have some extra wide films in their collections and would like to enjoy them on the \"big\" screen.", "Date": "May 4, 2013"}, {"Title": "Decent TV for ultimate movie watcher!", "Author": "Thefrequentbuyer", "ReviewID": "R2H3TK32S6EEVM", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "Well it appears I am the first person to write a review on this product the XVT 58in Cinema wide TV by Vizio.  Out of the box the TV worked well and setup didn't take too long.  I am a very picky person when it comes to my TV's and have gone through a lot of products.  I got this TV because I love movies and wanted something new and first of its kind.  This fit that bill movies looked good on the TV.  Watching regular cable with the stretch picture is a little strange faces are weird shaped and all.  You can turn off that feature and go to a normal view anytime so that makes that irrelevant.  The speakers seemed to work well but I mainly run my surround sound and disable TV speakers.The TV was quite heavy so was quite difficult to maneuver by myself.  I only used the 3d on a ps3 game COD and it seemed to work well.  I don't own any other 3d products yet but when Avengers comes out that will change.  I did notice a little image correction at times when scenes in movies or shows change the picture lags for a second then catches up nothing to noticeable or annoying.Overall it is a good TV but I don't think worth the price ($1999) you can probably find a better TV for the price.  If the black lines on movies that are widescreen drive you insane then this is the perfect TV for you.  Otherwise it still needs to come down some in price.  I decided to return the product back to Amazon.  They have a great Amazon return policy.  I am going to go with a different Vizio Model with all same features or better ones for $800 cheaper.Also downside not relevant to product but Delivery Company that delivers product CEVA is not the greatest.  They call and ask you to schedule a time block for deliver which is 10am-2pm or 2pm-6pm and they only could come to my area two days a week.  I picked the 10am-2pm time slot and took day off of work. The guy didn't arrive till 4:30pm 2.5hrs late from their 4hr window.  Company slogan is \"On time, every time\".  Amazon should possibly use a different or more reliable company. We shall see when my next product arrives.  I was able to arrange for them to take this product back with them when delivering the next one so a little positive.Hopefully this was helpful to you I always read product comments before I buy anything off of amazon and I felt the need to review this product because it was not reviewed yet.Pro: Lots of HDMI connections  Widescreen format is niceCons: Cost  Size/Weight  No 2d-3d conversion", "Date": "September 13, 2012"}, {"Title": "Amazing", "Author": "NWIDAD", "ReviewID": "R3PQQGW3W4JLUK", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Love it, Love it.

For a short time we had two very nice TVs with exceptional picture quality and amazing 3D. Our first Vizio started having what I call \"the flashing logo syndrome\" (see my review for that model) and now the second, the 58-inch XVT model, will no longer power up as well. The issues with the first Vizio started just after the warranty expired... great timing! However with our XVT model the initial problem was the right half of the screen would display \"green\" only. We checked all the settings and they were correct. Turning the TV off/on worked occassionly but eventually the XVT also stopped powering up. The Vizio XVT 58-inch was suppose to be an enhancement to replace our Sony Bravia SXRD KDS-50A3000 50-inch 1080p Rear Projection HDTV purchased in 2007. Now, both Vizio TVs are headed for the repair shop. We're back to watching the 50-inch Sony in the bedroom and we also have a Sony 52-inch LCD in our living room, both have great pictures by the way. Of note, both Vizio TVs were connected to surge protectors that also protected our LG 3D DVDs and Onkyo home theater surround sound systems. Over the years we've experienced an occassinal power outages but no other electrical equipment in our home has been damaged as a result from any power outage or power surge including our Sony TVs.

However, any aspect ratio under 2:35, you'll have black bars on the sides. It glitches every so often, but nothing too distracting.Watched \"Titanic 3D\" on it, was pretty good 3D but was 1:85 aspect ratio so there were black bars on the sides same with\"The Avengers\". It's got a pretty good picture. Basically, I'll watch 2:35 ar on this Vizio 21:9 art.v. and watch 1:85 ar films on my Toshiba 16:9 ar t.v. It arrived with a damaged stand which amazon sent a whole new t.v. to rectify, guessthey were unable to order just a replacement stand. Overall, it works well, looks good(silver and black) has a very good picture. Just wish it was $1,000 instead of $1,500. But its cool and fun and easy to connect to your wifi and the remote has a slide out qwerty keyboard for web surfing. If you already have a 16:9 t.v. and want to get this to add to your t.v.'s then you should be pleased, however if this is your first hdtv you'd probably be happier with a 16:9 t.v.", "Date": "December 14, 2012"}, {"Title": "Great for Movies and 3D", "Author": "Christian Wolff", "ReviewID": "RUUG1VHRTJDAU", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I ended up getting this TV directly from Vizio, having missed all the $1000 sales here. I've now had it since Christmas, and I'm overall happy with it. The wide aspect ratio is so much better, visually, as all content is displayed at the same height, with black bars on the sides. It gives a more even visual impression of different content. This is similar to movie theaters, which use curtains at the sides to adjust the screen size, but always use the full height of the screen.As for the size, it shows 16:9 content as on a 46\" 16:9 screen, and 4:3 content as on a 37\" 4:3 CRT, but it shows 21:9 content as big as on a 61\" 16:9 screen, just without the excessive height of such screens.The passive 3D is also great, I find it superior in all points to the active shutter glasses. The half vertical resolution inherent to this 3D technology really does not affect the image quality significantly.The main drawbacks for me are the atrocious viewing angle issues (the black level goes up and the contrast goes down, and darker grays get a greenish hue at just a few degrees off angle) and the lack of a complete set of fixed aspect ratio control setting, as well as the glossy panel. But these are issues with just this set, and this is not discounting 21:9 as a concept in general.Until anamorphic Blu-ray or other movie content becomes available, which will use the full 1080p frame for cinemascope movies, the \"automatic\" aspect ratio function of this TV is an acceptable compromise. It determines by itself whether the image is full frame (1.78:1 and 1.85:1) or letterboxed (2.39:1). It mostly gets it right, taking a couple seconds to detect and crop bars, and switching almost immediately back to 16:9 when the bars are gone.I would like to have a few more forced aspect ratio modes. There are none to force the upscaling of the 1920x810 letterboxed section of a 1080p signal to the full screen, or to force 480i content to be 4:3 full frame or letterboxed. I have the european 50\" Philips 21:9 model at work, and that one features all of those settings, and a few more.The CEC functionality is also a bit odd. When enabled, most buttons on the TV remote turn into buttons controlling the player. Even the \"Menu\" button is affecting the Blu-ray player and (at least on mine) puts it into the \"Setup\" menu, stopping the Blu-ray in the process with no way of resuming.As for Blu-rays that have the subtitles outside of the active picture, that is the fault of the Blu-ray Disc producers. Solution: Get an Oppo or Dune Blu-ray player, they allow to offset the subtiles vertically, shifting them back into the picture.It would be great if a 21:9 Plasma becomes available some time in the near future, but seeing how much of a niche product this turns out to be, I don't have much hope. But maybe a higher quality set will find more acceptance in the market.So, for now, if you mainly watch movies, and want to have a great 3D experience on top of that, then this set is for you. For TV shows, a 46\" screen will be an equivalent alternative. And if your living room is big enough for a 60\" Plasma, then that will be a viable alternative, too, but this will have the inferior shutter glass 3D.", "Date": "February 28, 2013"}, {"Title": "Still Love Love Love It after more than a Year", "Author": "ArtFirst", "ReviewID": "R33ZYLJZXP87LG", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "We love this TV! Got it at Costco over a year ago for a grand. Big purchase for our budget, but haven't regretted it for a second.The 21:9 aspect ratio gives a nice wide picture without the set looking ridiculously huge in our small living room (as it would if it were the same width at standard 16:9 ratio). It's not that easy to locate streaming content in 21:9 format, but when it is, it's spectacular! Regular HD programming is also amazingly crisp and gorgeous...such as Downton Abbey grounds and interior shots.We also love it for its looks. We got an industrial-look stand and sleek sound bar to go with.The included internet apps are slow and inelegant, but a $99 Roku 3 has solved that issue nicely. Roku and TiVo work great with it.As other reviewers have said, it has a high gloss screen, so plan placement accordingly. I personally like the glossy surface, it makes for incredible contrast -- with deep deep blacks, and clean colors. The gloss also looks great when it's off.The first one we got had issues with HDMI not working properly, and Vizio gave us a brand new one at no additional expense.Downside?

I happened to be perusing Amazon Warehouse deals around Christmas and one of these popped up for $1100 so I snatched it up. I've had my eye on this TV for a while and was not going to let it go. I see that a seller has this TV for $1700. It's probably worth that much, but if you're willing to wait, just wait for Vizio to produce more. The MSRP is less than that. If you're antsy, though, go ahead and buy it.First I'd like to commend the delivery company (Pilot) for their work. They kept me informed on the whereabouts of the TV as it made its way across the country, and then they delivered it two days early. Nice! Luckily my wife was home but that was a pleasant surprise. She informs me that the two delivery guys were great. Top to bottom the delivery experience with them was world class. Now on to the TV.Since this TV was in the Amazon Warehouse it was a return, but all the stickers and protection on the TV were in tact. My wife says the box looked like it had never been open. Someone must have bought this TV for them self then perhaps the wife put the kaibash on it. Ha ha. Good for me.We were moving from a 47\" Vizio we have had for almost four years and this was a great upgrade. The picture is even better. Colors pop. The blacks are super-black. We mostly watch movies and blurays look pretty incredible. One interesting thing is that I never noticed how many of our blurays are in an HDTV aspect, re-mastered for HDTV's. Then I noticed that they were all movies I didn't care *that* much about and the 'money' movies (Prometheus, Pulp Fiction, The Godfather) are all in widescreen. Prometheus, especially, looks fantastic on this TV.How about the 3D? This is my first 3D TV so I have nothing to compare it to, but Coraline was incredible. Prometheus, as mentioned, was incredible. It's very well done. I have a camera that can composite 3D photos together and those look impressive, too. I have found no drawbacks to the picture on this thing, it's beautiful. (Note that I've disabled all the motion and edge detection mumbo-jumbo they have since it doesn't really do much but get in the way when watching a bluray. I suggest you do this, too, and set your picture to 'movie' mode.)So, are there any drawbacks? Maybe, but nothing I can't live with.1. The screen is very shiny so it reflects a lamp I have opposite the TV. Our last TV had a kind of matte finish so I never noticed. So I watch movies with the lights out now. No biggie.2. The built-in Internet apps, while a good idea, are not as great as they could be. I only use Hulu and Amazon and have reverted back to my Roku for a few reasons. First, they're slow to load and get running. Second, the Amazon app does not provide access to your watchlist, which seems like a glaring omission. The Hulu app puts all your queued videos in one big pool without categorizing them by show, so it's a little clunky to sift through them. None of these are necessarily dealbreakers to anyone who doesn't have a Roku, but I do have one and will continue to use it until the built-in Internet apps improve.For the average TV watcher, the added width of this TV won't really come in handy. Although it's a nice touch that when you open a TV menu it scootches the picture over so the menu doesn't obscure it. Even so, the extra width will be wasted while watching regular TV. This TV is pretty much the exact height of our 47\" but perhaps a foot wider. If you like your epic movies to look a bit more epic or if you're annoyed by letterboxing, then you can't go wrong with this TV.", "Date": "January 6, 2013"}, {"Title": "I Hope They Make More", "Author": "Goban \"The Thief\"", "ReviewID": "R9MI1CZH8UJYH", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "First I want to say that whatever delivery company Amazon hired did not meet the delivery date, in fact they called me the day prior and tried to bribe me with a $100 gift card if they could deliver it 9 days AFTER the promised date.  I cancelled and bought it from Costco instead.Still, I wanted to say that I love this TV (loved actually, since it was stolen on Christmas day by some jerks). It is NOT the best picture out there, Samsung and LG make better screens by far, but I would choose this one in a heartbeat over any other set on the market because the 21:9 aspect is awesome for those Blu-rays in scope or other extra-wide aspects.  The LED backlit screen didn't have the greatest contrast, there was noticeable banding (not from the source), and I couldn't really adjust the color temp exactly the way I like but it was good enough.  And hey, maybe these problems were the source and I just didn't notice on my previous 46\" Samsung, this VIZIO is BIG!The built-in audio is...there.  Hook it up to a home theater, a soundbar, or something because the sound is disappointing in comparison to the picture; I guess that's just the way it is with TVs though.  It does have Bluetooth audio streaming capability so you could use headphones if you don't want to disturb your housemates or neighbors.  The auto-switching between aspects is nearly seamless, I watched Tron: Legacy in 3D on this set and some scenes were displayed shot for IMAX so it would almost unnoticeably switch back and forth.  it certainly didn't adversely affect my viewing.  Speaking of 3D, I still prefer the shutter glasses to the extremely cheap feeling polarized glasses they include, but the 3D effect still looked nice so I guess there is no reason to complain about it.  The glasses are light which is nice, but the shutter glasses never really felt like a burden.  The remote felt super cheap, the sliding mechanism was uneven, but having a keyboard for entering login information for all the built in VIZIO Internet Apps was really nice so ultimately I'll take the cheap feeling remote with keyboard over an onscreen keyboard.  It had more than enough ports for me, and they include CEC and ARC which is probably expected nowadays and the built in Wi-Fi was also great, no need to run another cable or buy a dongle.So there is one problem with this set and I've already mentioned it, it is BIG!  I'm sure in your head your saying \"duh!\" but seriously, it is a lot bigger than a normal 58\" set.  Obviously the right size is always a personal opinion, but I wish they made them smaller.  They were announced smaller, don't know if they ever sold the smaller one or not but it doesn't seem to be on their website.Anyway, I hope this review doesn't come off as negative, I am (was...) extremely pleased with this TV.  The few things I mentioned are really no big deal, and I got it on sale for $999 so it was very reasonably priced.  I hope they make more but it doesn't seem like it caught on, It's out of stock almost everywhere now so maybe it's been end-of-lifed. If you watch a lot of high definition content and most of it is wider than the typical 16:9, and you don't mind the budget quality of the screen (it looks just as \"good\" as their other Razor LED TVs) then this is definitely the TV you are looking for.", "Date": "January 4, 2013"}, {"Title": "Love It So Far", "Author": "S.

So if this is your first HD TV... you want to pass.  If you are still tethered to network or cable television... you want to pass.  This TV is really for those of us who have cut the cable cord and only watch discs or stream.  More disc than stream to be sure.You cannot play 2:55:1 content as the TV freaks out.  So Sleeping Beauty, Ben Hur, Lady and the Tramp and a few other films will make you very angry as they look like postage stamps on your 58\" cinema-scope TV.  Which brings me to the TV's biggest fault it is only good for 2:40:1, 2:39:1, and 2:20:1.  Vizio does not offer the kind of manual adjustments to allow the users to effectively view 2:55:1 content.  Not such a big deal based on my viewing habits but to the average american this TV will be a straight up nightmare.  We are talking total Nightmare on Elm street.Now the good stuff.  2:40:1, 2:39:1, and 2:20:1 aspect ratio films rock the house with this television.  The picture as presented when connected to my OPPO-93 is stunning.  1:85:1 is acceptable.  4:3 is just about as worthless as can be, which is to be expected.Lawrence of Arabia looks fantastic as do the Incredibles and Brave.

Images are crisp and clean... Vudu is the standout in this department.  Dredd looked almost as good as the actual blu-ray.So I love the TV set, but your mileage may vary depending on your movie collection aspect ratios.", "Date": "April 14, 2013"}, {"Title": "Great 2D, killer 3D", "Author": "Eman", "ReviewID": "R3FAVORPT4R2LF", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "For me this TV size is a dream come true. For past two years I have owned a Sony HX800 LED LCD with 3D. The Sony 3D has always been marginal in 3D with the overblown brightness revealing the cloudiness that the local dimmed LED function usually hides. This makes anamorphic 3D films have bright bars or corners which are distracting. The set is also unable to zoom in on this content (I hate black bars so I usually zoom in on all films). The crosstalk has always made 3D kind of lame with video games impossible to stomach. Finally, the glasses are uncofortable and are battery hungry - we have 6 pairs and one or more always need new batteries even when we only watch a couple of hours a month of 3D movies. Other than this the Sony is a great TV in regular 2D content.The Vizio picture quality in 2D is just as good as the Sony, but 16:9 content is smaller. I wish Vizio had a geometry correct zoom for 16:9 in order to get a bigger feel but its not such a big deal to me since I care more for Blu Ray film content. It is here the TV shines. So far I have watched a handful of movies and they all played without any issues. The Dark Knight was a bit of a pain when it switched aspect ratios from 16:9 back to widescreen as it took about a second or two to go full screen (widescreen to 16:9 was seamless). I dont particularly care for this effect in my old Sony either though I will admit it was less distracting. Screen uniformity and color/tint after calibration are a bit better with the Vizio, but there is a tad of DSE in this panel that I do not see in the Sony. There is however no smearing, corner bleed/flash lighting or other problems that I have noticed so far.In 3D the Vizio is absolutely fantastic. I remember being a bit concerned with the 'resolution drop' that I must admit is discernible in all of the passive sets I have sampled ( at viewing distances equal to or larger than my 8 feet). I was prepared to take a hit and live with the bit of horizontal lines but to my surprise I saw none or at least nowhere near as noticeable as with the other passive sets. It may be that the added pixel density slightly offsets this - dont know. The picture is brighter with colors/tint virtually unchanged compared to using the active Sony . Crosstalk is non-existant I can now play wipeout and other PS3 games without issues. With the Sony I had to have my head fixed as any slight leaning would make crosstalk worse not so with the Vizio. Viewing is also more comfortable with the lighter glasses. 3D is killer on this set - I am sold on passive dont care what anyone else says.", "Date": "December 10, 2012"}, {"Title": "There are consequences to going abnormal !!", "Author": "Suman Chitturi", "ReviewID": "R23HRHWF6LG7KX", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I am only writing about the bad because other people covered all the good about the TV, and there is plenty of it.- Subtitles often appear in the black bar area and this tv cuts them off- When watching movies on showtime channel, their logo is slightly into the black bar and the TV does not want to crop their logo, so even 21:9 movies don't quite fill all the screen.- Most 3D movies are in 16:9 format. I tried atleast 8 of them.- I tried several movies from different sources (netflix, amazon, redbox, friends blurays) and found only 60% of them to be 21:9 format. So, 40% of the time you are watching movies on a 46 inch screen.- It appears often movies are converted to 16:9 for dvd/bluray, though they were actually 21:9 at the theater.- Remote is annoying. It is over smart and detects my bluray player automatically and starts acting like a bluray remote. The problem is that when I am watching bluray I can no more change TV brightness and such. The 'Menu' button brings up bluray menu !! There is no device selection option on the remote like most universal remotes.- And it is one ugly, bulky remote.- There is the issue with viewing angles. When viewed from an angle the picture looks as if you bumped up the brightness.- In very dark scenes, the TV fails to produce good blacks. And there is noticeable backlight bleed from the corners of the screen.- There is an option to adjust backlight in the menus, but that is always disabled.- Both my bluray player (Panasonic) and my xbox have way more and better apps than this TV. I guess you will use Vizio apps only if you want to use apps on the side while watching 16:9 TV. I know I will never use them.- Issues switching from 3D back to 2D. After I finish watching a 3D movie from bluray player, when the bluray returns to its menus, the TV tries to interpret the image as 3D and shows it garbled. I have to manually switch it back to 2D from the TV menus.Feature Note:One feature that is not in the manual but useful is audio pass thru. Audio routed from bluray to the TV via HDMI comes out of the TV via toslink/optical. However, dolby digital sounds comes out as is (which is good) but dolby DTS sound comes out as 2 channel PCM (useable but that is some serious degradation).", "Date": "January 18, 2013"}, {"Title": "Stopped working - unlucky", "Author": "Andy", "ReviewID": "R1E07VCRPLWQ5U", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I fell in love with this set when I first saw it on display at the store.

Tried the TV again this morning and it's working!! It downloaded a few updates shortly after the logo came on, then went on working like nothing had happened.

Yay!!  :)PROS- Vizio apps are great and even better on this TV than in other models I have used.- The 3D surprised me. I didn't buy this TV with 3D in mind, but was pleasantly surprised when I tried it. Hopefully, more content (especially content I'm interested in watching) will be available soon.- It's great to get actual 58\" of picture when watching movies!CONS- As much as I like this TV, I feel like I paid the fair price for it on Black Friday, $999 with free shipping. I wouldn't pay twice as much for it and would consider purchasing a nice HD, 3D projector instead for that price range.- I'm surprised they don't have this format in larger sizes, it would be nice to have larger sizes to choose from for people with good sized home theaters._____________________________I was pretty happy with this TV. I didn't think it was worth its regular price, but getting it for less than $1,000 on Black Friday felt like a pretty good deal to me. The TV didn't feel like it would be big enough for a home theater, but it worked well for my living room. Purchased it with free shipping, so it was a pretty reasonable deal for the price. Unfortunately, the TV was delivered on 12/07/2012 and died on 01/20/2013. Not a good lifespan, especially not for $1,000. I hadn't even used it that much, since it sits in my living room and in the colder months I tend to watch TV mostly in my bedroom. I was watching a Netflix movie last night and, all of a sudden, half the screen froze while the other half continued playing the movie over the frozen screen. I tried to back out, but the frozen, flickering, screen wouldn't clear. I turned the TV off and when I turned it back on, all I got was a black screen, brighter at first, then darker after a few seconds. That's it! No menu, no apps, nothing. Just a black screen.Thankfully, I purchased it directly from Amazon, so we are in the process of deciding of to do next. They offered me the option to return it for a refund; return it for another item; or return it and wait until it is available in stock again and get it replaced. I don't know, the thought of returning it is overwhelming, since I no longer have the box and this is a rather large item. But I am considering taking it to their shipping company in Philly and letting them deal with it. Due to the shipping difficulties, I am considering getting a projector this time around. At least, if that breaks, it's easier to send it back and get another one, no need to sit at home waiting for the delivery truck, or feel overwhelmed dealing with how to to return it.Like I said, the TV was ok for the price I got it, but this headache makes the price too high...", "Date": "January 20, 2013"}, {"Title": "21:9 is Awesome", "Author": "Solar Powered USA. \"JustDoIt\"", "ReviewID": "R3BPGAN5P1DOFG", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I just wish more companies made this form, and that Vizio continues to produce it.

With the price on Amazon.com around $2200 dollars, I was very close to buying when Sam's Club had them for $1288. When I checked again they had marked them down to $988, which was too good to resist. I bought one and took it home, hooked it up to both a Blu ray player that is 3d capable, as well as my sony PS3. It took a few days of tweaking with the controls to get it exactly right because it seemed a little dark to me, but once I had it where I wanted it, it was a beautiful picture. I loved the widescreen effect, and the 3d was every bit as good as my LG and Vizio. On some lighter scenes I noticed very faint vertical bars that were quite distracting. It seemed almost like image burn-in, the type of thing a screen saver is meant to prevent. I hadn't left the screen displaying no image, and most TV's these days have an automatic screen saver that kicks in so I don't believe that's what it was. I thought it might be a bad cable, so I swapped out the HDMI cable with no difference. Both 3D players had the same result, so I knew that wasn't the cause. If that had been the only anomaly, I could probably have lived with it. Sadly, there were other things I noticed that made the decision to return it for me. Several times the unit turned itself off, and then back on. This happened four times in a fifteen minute time period, during a show I was interested in so this was very frustrating. On top of that, I would hear an occasional popping sound in the audio, so after ten days it was time to take it back for a refund. Like other reviewers here, I feel the idea was better than the execution. I would love a well-made 3D TV in a widescreen format but unfortunately, I don't believe this is it.
