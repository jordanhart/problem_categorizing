I really don't understand the thinking that goes behind selling higher end TV's with more HDMI connections. If the tv has internet connectivity built in, that is one LESS HDMI connection that is required, but if you are like me and want to add a streaming network player, you need that extra HDMI connection if you already are using the other 2 for BluRay and satellite receivers.The 2nd selling point was that the screen, while not truly a matte finish, is still much less reflective than the other top brands, especially LG. This was a big consideration for me, as my tv room has a lot of windows.I love the TV's appearance. It is very thin with a modern look. The picture quality is great, and I like the movie mode for watching movies and normal tv dramas and sitcoms, while the 120hz ClearFrame is great for sports, especially fast action sports like Supercross and Formula One.The reason I don't give it 5 stars is the remote. It is crappy looking and feeling, the buttons are bizarrely either over-sensitive or under-sensitive when using the onscreen prompts. Really hit or miss. It needs a better remote, and I am thinking about trying one from the L6200U series when my local big-box store gets them in to see if it will work with the L5200U series as well.One tip: Make sure you download and flash the firmware upgrade from Toshiba's website before you try to scan for local channels with the tuner.", "Date": "May 9, 2012"}, {"Title": "Solid picture Solid Price", "Author": "Aaron Trejo", "ReviewID": "R1U8EDG0QOWUQE", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "The picture is outstanding and very natural, Great contrast, whites are super white and blacks are very deep.  Menu buttons are very responsive, no delay.  Thin frame and a sturdy stand.For the price nothing came close in comparison that is 120hz l.e.d less than 2\" thick with clear frame technology.The clear frame technology works great but works via HDMI not the dvi pc connection.  Whats cool about it is that you can have something in clear frame mode AND then set the degree of \"camera stabilization\", between smooth, standard and off.  So you can avoid the complete soap opera effect by setting it to off instead of smooth.Blue Ray video is jaw dropping indeed, with the clear frame technology applied over Planet Earth the picture seems ultra real and life like.There are a few things about it that are small inconveniences but definitely pale in comparison to the overall deal.-Each input saves display preferences EXCEPT for Game mode-no dedicated game mode button, access quickly through menu.-no start up sound; I enjoyed my Samsung's jingle to confirm the button press was received.I use this as my pc monitor connected via HDMI.$650 after tax from Best Buy.I had to do a lot of color calibrating but I am extremely satisfied with my purchase.I hope this helps as there are not many reviews out about this model.Enjoy it!", "Date": "April 27, 2012"}, {"Title": "Excellent buy.", "Author": "Nits", "ReviewID": "R14PPSQUHJG2DG", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I shopped around a lot comparing features to every TV out there before I made the decision to buy this TV.I narrowed down my choices in the following order of priority:1) Size2) Picture (image quality, colors & refresh rate)3) Sound4) Screen resolution when Connected to computers5) Sound Output (Auxilarry, Digital or Co-axial)6) # of HDMI ports7) Component jacks8) Smart apps & wi-fiSize is something that every individual will have their own preference on. My comparison came down to Sharp LC42LE540U, Toshiba 40L5200, Samsung UN40EH6000FXZA & Panasonic TC-L42E50. Out of these 4, Sharp had the best picture quality.Picture & Refresh rate: Hardware on Sharp, Panasonic & Samsung is 120 Hz whereas hardware on Toshiba is 60 Hz. Toshiba presents this TV with 120 Hz refresh rate but truly hardware is 60 Hz. I am a die hard football fan so I made sure I watched some really quick forward passes on this TV before I picked it. ClearFrame technology works good on this TV. You may see a few kinks but overall, you will not notice a difference. The image n this TV however was second to Sharp. It was more true. Samsung image appeared good but it was too bright, looked almost like made up image. Picture on this TV looked real as if I was looking through my window.Computer Connectivity: Sharp was a better choice in terms that it allowed connection to computer using a VGA cable and it's screen resolution was 1080p for computers using VGA port. Panasonic & Toshiba only provide resolution up to 768p (also commonly called 720p). 768p is higher than 768p but it is easy for people to understand. Samsung had no VGA port.Wi-fi: Sharp had in-built wi-fi. Panasonic was wi-fi ready. You need to purchase a Panasonic Wifi Dongle to connect to the only USB on TV. Samsung & Toshiba both do not have wi-fi. I was not worried of the Wi-fi because I was going to connect Apple TV to make it wi-fi enabled.Sound: The choice all came down to sound quality for me. I understand that using a Sound bar is cool thing to do with TVs but I want my TV to be able to work without Sound bars too. Sharp was the best choice in every other department except for its appearance and sound. The sound out of sharp was muffled and not easy to relate to. Panasonic on the other hand was barely audible on max vol. Samsung had decent colume coming out but Toshiba was so loud and clear on 34 vol (max 100).Appearance & inputs: I was instantly sold on this Toshiba TV. It has good appearance. It's skinny (thinner than Sharp, Panasonic & Samsung). It has 3 HDMI ports as opposed to 2 in Samsung & 4 in Sharp. It has a composite input to connect your older devices to your TV. Samsung only had HDMI inputs. It has a PC sound input from computer. The best part is that you can choose your input source on your computer. So if you use a VGA to HDMI converter then you don't need to worry about not getting any sound from your TV. You can select HDMI input as video source and PC input as audio source. Vga clarity is good. I have a display port on my computer so I can connect my notebook using HDMI port and get max resolution but for older computers VGA is a must.Sound Outputs: Toshiba TV also has both Digital & Auxiliary sound output. Aux output lets you connect your high intensity BOSE computer speaker system to your TV. I don't know about other but I like having only one good set of BOSE speakers which I can use with both my TV & computer. No need to spend money on 2 separate sets. Samsung had only digital audio output.This TV also has a USB input like other TVsAll in all, this TV has given me the best value for my money.I saw some reviews on software problems with this TV. I also noticed that at times I had video but no Audio.I figured out the problem. It only happens (intermittently) if I use my comcast cable remote to turn the TV off but use TV's remote to turn it back on (or vice versa). I now use only my cable remote to turn tv on or off and I have not seen any software issue with the TV.", "Date": "August 20, 2012"}, {"Title": "Best Buy!", "Author": "Joe P.", "ReviewID": "R3IMP3LTOL26YS", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I did quite a bit of research before purchasing this TV, so I was fairly confident it would be a good set. However, it was even better than I expected.  First, let me say that I was looking for a tv, not a machine that does it all. I did not want 3d, picture-in-picture, or internet connectivity, though I get internet via both Direct TV and my TIVO. The TV itself has a fantastic picture right out of the box. The basic setting for home is so good that I have not yet found a need to tweak it. The sound is loud and clear, and the leveling feature keeps the loud, obnoxious commercials from being too irritating. I have been pleased with the motion reproduction.  Other reviewers have commented on the remote, so let me say that it really works fine, though it is a little bit light weight. Personally, we use the Direct TV remote, so it is not much of an issue, anyway. If you are like me and want a great TV that does what it should without all of the bells and whistles, then you can get this at a reasonable price. I suggest shopping around. Also, i don't normally get extended warranties, but I did this time. Not really sure why, but I did.

I m techno person n I looked through lots of brand like Samsung, Sony, LG, Sharp, Panasonic etc. I wanted a tv with best picture and sound quality. After spending hrs in comparing the picture quality n contrast ratio, I purchase this tv from a nearby store for just 600 including taxes.I found that TOSHIBA has come up with this 2012 model 40L5200U, which has the best sound and great picture with rich colors, the picture looks so real and natural as though u r looking out of the window.I was initially planning to get a Samsung 2012 ES model, but did not like the picture and color in it after comparing both tv in store for hours. Smart features was not a priority for me because I wanted to get an Apple tv with all the Apple devices I have iphone, macbook etc, Airplay mirroring is a great plus.I purchased an apple tv n connect to my TOSHIBA n u wont believe that along with my Bose speakers it became the best SMART TV u can think of. Why to pay extra $200-$300 for getting a smart TV with built in wi-fi when u can get smart devices like apple tv, ruku, smart bluray players for just $100.Really Appreciate TOSHIBA for making this Great TV without the smart features at a reasonable price and giving back the price benefit to the customers, to choose the smart device of their choice.", "Date": "April 20, 2012"}, {"Title": "Great value, great TV!!!", "Author": "Njackso7", "ReviewID": "R1TCQ2AIYAORD9", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This unit is great!

I didnt need one because I run all apps through my xbox and ps3. For an HDTV, the speakers are rather impressive, but if you are focusing on having such a great picture and not combining it with some sort of surround sound, shame on you I do not want to hear how much you hate the speakers. I find them more than adequate.When playing through an HDMI input, you have to turn the TV to \"game mode\" or it will show lag. It takes two seconds and does not bother me one bit.Toshiba has long been known as a great television set maker, and this one falls right in line with that assessment.

The picture is awesome! Many have complained about the sound, but really does any flat screen TV have great sound? My other TV a Sony 32\" doesn't, my friend's Samsung doesn't, nor have I heard great sound on any of them. I put a Coby sound bar on, sounds great now! Has plenty of inputs, would of liked to have something other than 3.5 mm audio output jack, luckily my Coby sound bar had such a connection, a couple of RCA Jacks would of been nice. It does have a digital sound output. My biggest complaint is you can ONLY use the remote that came with it. I can't use my Cable DVR remote. On calls to Time Warner and Toshiba, after about an hour trying to program it myself, no one had a code, and Toshiba said it would be about a year before one was availabe?? Say what! A little bit of a P.I.A. but I guess I can live with it, as really the only functions I really use with the Toshiba remote is volume, to turn it off and on and the occasional video source change.

Because i am making this review so early since my purchase so that people will have an idea of this tv because it has not ratings besides this one.. that being said i will update. so anyways lets get on with the review. I''l post pics soon later.For starters i was on a budget and before getting any tv i came across over everyone of them online, this tv was just luck but i still looked for reviews from customers and found ZERO so i knew i was taking a chance. I was planning on getting a cheapo westinghouse but when i went to Best Buy somehow this TV cought my attention. I have a 3 year zero percent interest financing plan so i have a while until the tv is mine....Anyways I got it for my small-medium sized room and it looks perfect. not too big if you are looking away from 5+ feet.Specs: This TV is 45.6 inches diagonally. full 1080p (1920x1080) and has clear frame 120hz. It also has 3 HDMI outputs, VGA for pcs, one usb port that only plays music and photos  a component,optical port, and pc in jacks for audio (which i think is just a 3.5 mm jack)This is my first Tv with 120 hz refresh frame and i gotta say i can really see the difference. Also worth noting is that color may not be good out of the box as in some tv channels i saw a warm color so people's faces were red tanned, i tweeked my video settings and i got a much better color.  I've heard Toshiba has awful sound but i am not disappointed with this tv's sound . It sounds a lot louder than its predecessors but for optimal sound i recommend a sound bar or 5.1 which i plan getting( i mean c'mon lets be honest 95% of all HDTV's speakers suck).Pros: It is 1080P,120HZ, has 3 HDMI ports, i am a gamer and this tv has a game mode when connected to an hdmi (without it you would see input lag or a slow responding gaming experience),Cons: i have an old Sony 5.1 with no digital coax or optical so i cant connect it to this unit, i have tried everything from RCA cables to a RCA to 3.5 mm jack and nothing....... this tv only accepts digital so i will have to replace it but hey i was planning on getting blu ray either way.The USB port does NOT play video so that is a con for me so i use my xbox 360's usb ports to play them.the color kinda of fades when moving away from the center but its minimal. i see no difference really when being from an angle but it IS brighter if you watch from the center since this is an LED tv.so far this tv has been great. i gave it 4 stars because of its cons but then again no TV is perfect. so if you think about getting this tv i recommend it if you are on a budget for a big screen. if you have any questions feel free to contact me.  I wish good luck.-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------UPDATE APRIL 7 2012: i have found out that the censor is at the middle portion of the tv which is the aero design with the brushed stainless steel metal.... this probably means that if you have a sound bar it may be conflicting.", "Date": "April 4, 2012"}, {"Title": "Best value", "Author": "Oleg Mikheev", "ReviewID": "R1S07JW40WKL9", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I researched all available LED 120Hz HDTVs in 46-55'' range and this one was the best value I could find.I was expecting some lower class TV for the money that I paid but it appeared that its picture quality is ever better than that of its >$1000 competitors.Remote control is not very good but usable, I will replace it with some universal one.I compared my TV to Samsungs (we've got lots of Samsung HDTVs at work), and I started to LOVE Toshiba's matte screen.Samsungs' glossy screen reflects everything and it acts more like a mirror if it faces window.

My first tv to ever crash on me.  I just wanted a tv that could change channels and inputs.  Is that really too much to ask?It also did have some edge back lighting problems when the picture was of a very dark or black seen. The corners had slight light bleed through.  Nothing that made it a deal breaker for the price. It was just a little annoying to notice it at times.It crashes when using the built-in tv tuner.  About once ever 2 days.  When it does crash it goes black and then after about a minute the last channel you had comes up. After that last channel comes up then the tv no longer responds to any buttons.  You have to shut the tv off and then turn it back on to be able to use it again.  And it seems to sit there and think a while before actually shutting off.I tried updating the software that you can get from the Toshiba site and it didn't help.  The fact that that you have software updates for your tv now days is just sad.It wasn't real bad, but the cable connection coming out the side  might be a pain depending on the cables you have.

It's amazingly crisp and the colors are great. I don't notice any problematic areas of the screen.I'm sort of baffled that it takes 15 seconds to get a picture after hitting the power button the the remote, and wondering if somehow there's some setting that I could change to alter this... but I looked through the menus and didn't see anything relevant. I also find the menus to be non-intuitive, although there's not so many options that you can't just look through them all when searching for a potential option to control.I also find the stand to be surprisingly flimsy and disappointing, and the remote entirely inelegant.FYI: I got the 46\" model of this, and I use my TV with a Roku and an internet-enabled BlueRay player for Netflix, Hulu, and rented movies. And also that we recently got an 42\" LG TV (LG 42LM6200 42-Inch Cinema 3D 1080p 120Hz LED-LCD HDTV with Smart TV and Six Pairs of 3D Glasses), so I have a recent high-end point of comparison. I like this TV way better than the LG.When all is said and done, I do realize that I prefer that TV manufacturers get the picture right first and that the user interface is a second priority. However, as a technical person, I am disappointed at the lack of attention to the user interface.Pros:1. Beautiful picture.2. Love the slim design.3. Sound is great.Cons:1. Wish the stand were more sturdy and that it rotated.2. Wish the user interface was better, including the weird 15 second startup.3. Wish the remote was sexier.I don't regret this purchase because the picture is totally beautiful. But I do wish those details had been tended to better.A couple of updates, 12/4/12: I just got around to connecting my older receiver and CD player to this, partly because I was curious about the interoperability with older components (no HDMI jacks). And I'm dragging my feet about upgrading the receiver, which I use for my surround sound. (Note: I recently moved, and haven't yet connected all five speakers, so I can't comment on that. Nor have I set things up, yet, to have audio go from the TV to the nice speakers.) Really, this is just a comment that the RGB works fine. That goes straight from the CD player to the TV, and then the sound (optical cable) goes from the CD player to the receiver (not through the TV). I do think this TV might have had more in the way of the older inputs, but I also think it's basically fine, and the bottom line is that I don't have to buy a new receiver right now to use this TV. And when I get another optical cable, it will be easy to go from the TV to the receiver.Update, 12/24/12: I've hooked up the surround sound now, as well as the digital audio from the TV to my receiver. Again, I'm pleased with this TV, and that it works with my ~10yo receiver (again, I'm using digital audio). I love having the surround sound for my internet movies... Netflix, Amazon Prime, etc.FWIW, I have found that I'm used to the weird 15-second startup, though I do still find the lack of prompt feedback weird.", "Date": "November 25, 2012"}, {"Title": "Absolutely lousy customer support", "Author": "MaryMarvey", "ReviewID": "R2BFW6S9EPZ0U1", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "This has been a great tv for me.

Very thin, and looks nice3. Perfect sensitivity touch screen controls4. Decent sound quality5. Excellent customer serviceCons:1. HDMI ports are near the edge of the TV and you can see the cords sticking out from the front of the TV. It looks bad2.There is a lip near where you plug in the HDMIs, so some cords won't go in all the way. They still work, but they're very loose and fall out if you turn the TV3. Touch screen controls have no backlight, so I find myself pressing the wrong button on accident in the dark4. If you want to watch movies or play games, you have to turn the TV back to 60Hz or there will be a lot of video lag. It almost defeats the purpose of a 120Hz TV5. The TV switches itself back to 120Hz everytime you change the input, so if I'm playing Xbox and need to switch inputs6. After only 4 months, my speakers started making a buzzing sound, so I called Toshiba and they said the main board was fried (the main board is the most expensive part, and it's cheaper to replace the entire TV). Luckily I was still under the 1 year warranty and they replaced it for free, but it's the fact that it needed replacing after 4 months is bad.Overall I would rate this TV decent, but I would never buy it again. I paid six hundred for it, and a month later my brother bought a Vizio 47\" 3D LED TV for thirty dollars more. His TV hasn't had any problems like mine has, and he's very happy with it. While touchscreen is a cool technology, we don't need it in everything. I can't stand the fact that I have to look at the dark text on the control buttons in order to see what I'm pressing, unlike on a physical button control panel you can memorize what each button does (for example, you could feel for the third button from the bottom and know that button lowers the volume, but it you feel for something on a touchscreen, you end up pressing the wrong things). I'm not much of a complainer and I don't write reviews often, but I'm giving this one an honest review since I feel everyone should be aware of the problems of this TV, and I'm not one of those people who gives a one star review because Amazon shipped it a day later than they were supposed to.

No boring tech specs here.  The package arrived one day earlier than expected, Kudos to Amazon and UPS.  The TV arrived in good shape.

The screen easily connected to the base stand with four hefty screws...quite easy for one person to put together alone...took all of five minutes and that was with two kids climbing on me while putting it together.  Once assembled and powered on, setup was a breeze thanks to it's auto-startup and scan.  The TV found our cable signal and cable box quickly and without any problems.  I have read reviews of custom settings everyone recommends for this size, but to be honest my family and I were quite happy with it right out of the box.The remote does feel a bit on the medium size compared to current day trends.  The sound from the built-in speakers is IMHO is better than any previous speakers I have noted on any LED/LCD televisions.  With that being said, I will be investing in a sound bar for this TV when I can figure out which one I want.  We like our sound turned up for movies and such,  and that is when you realize that the built-in speakers weren't made for 53 laser guided photon torpedoes blasting across your screen all while a swarm of aliens defend their hive from a herd of mindless attacking zombies.  Also, all of the inputs/ouputs on the back are well laid out and easy to get to EXCEPT for the cable input that you have to twist/screw the connector into the tv....fairly tight squeeze to get my fingers in there and get it connected.I would recommend this TV to anyone interested in a midsize television.

The picture is nice (well...OK) but it takes forever to set it to the way you want it.  After fooling with it for several hours, I finally came back to these reviews and used the recommendations of one of the reviewers.  They were very helpful except that I had to tweak the sharpness more for my taste. I read the reviews that the TV doesn't rotate before I made my purchase thinking that it wasn't that important, but turns out that it is which is why I gave it 4 stars. It just doesn't seem ideal that a 40 inch TV can't be rotated. I also thought the 12 second startup delay was trivial in the previous reviews, but turns out that it is pretty annoying. I don't believe what I got in the box was a manual so I am having a hard time figuring out how to connect a DVD player to it. The sound comes through but not the video.  This is where the problem with just the red & white audio connectors comes in from other reviews that I didn't think was that important, oh but it is!!! I got a good deal on the TV with financing and I needed it before hosting a Thanksgiving Day football watch party so I'm pleased with my purchase.  I may also be a bit spoiled by my Sharp AQUOS and it's unbelievable picture, as well as it's ease of use to tweak settings, rotate, and connect/use a DVD player which makes some of the not-so-important issues with the Toshiba seem bigger than life since nothing I have comes close to the Sharp's exceptional value. One cool feature of this TV that I wanted to add that I wish existed on every TV is that when you click the Mute button, it first drops the volume by half and if you hit it a second time, it will fully Mute but then the Caption appears so you can still keep up with your TV program without the volume.", "Date": "December 3, 2012"}, {"Title": "Ties a room together as well as the right rug", "Author": "D.

(Though it applies equally to the 46\" model of this same exact one, as I tried that one out for a month as well, with equally great results.)I got mine at a larger Costco with a gigantic TV dept, where I could compare against Samsung, Sony (1 model), Vizeo (which they really push as \"best\" at several Costcos), LG, Phillips, JVC, and some others I'm forgetting.  And I went to several Costcos, also Best Buy and Video Only.  Spent MANY hours on this!I had no preconceived notions going in, and no biases; I just wanted the best picture quality I could find, at least adequate sound, a good-looking set overall, and least of all (after accomplishing the latter items as the much bigger priority), a good price.  I can say that this Toshiba won handily on ALL of these issues except sound, where it was comparable to most others, though not best.This Toshiba had the sharpest, most beautiful picture BY FAR (with the best, most realistic colors, esp. all-important fleshtones--on white AND black people).  The one I bought and took home is even nicer at home with my Comcast/Infinity HD cable box.  On the HD channels, it simply LOOKS the most clear, sharp, and the most \"HD\".  Colors are the most realistic--still vivid, but not tending toward brown/yellow/green like the Vizeos and JVCs.  (I spent LOTS of time on the latter two brands, adjusting the tint greatly to get them to be more natural, but to no avail; neither could the salesperson accomplish any better with those two; they have \"ugly\" pictures in my opinion . . . and I say this as a guy who had LOVED his 1998 tube-type JVC 32\" TV for its beautiful and realistic picture, with perfect color and amazing surround sound, too . . . but things have changed with HD, and the manufacturers aren't even the same ones anymore.)This Toshiba has the option of the \"dreaded\" soap opera look (set Picture Stabilization to \"Smooth\" for that, \"Off\" to avoid it), and then any film looks like brand-new VIDEO-- a truly amazing effect, not necessarily to be avoided at all.  Anything \"live\" and recorded in video (soap operas, nature shows, live sporting events) should be viewed this way, THAT is HOW you get the MOST from an HD TV!  Blu-rays look off the charts on this TV, whether in that \"smooth\" mode or with it Off!I had purchased the 46\" version of this exact model, loved it for ALL the same reasons, but exchanged it for the 50\" version to get a bigger screen. They are identical in all respects except for the size--both equally great.  (And I checked how \"identical\" they are not just via comparing the 46\" and 50\" TVs, and the instruction manuals, myself; I also called Toshiba customer service and checked on MANY specs between the two sizes.  And THAT person at Toshiba said that everything was identical up and down his spec sheets.)The remote control is uninteresting, but works perfectly.  There are lots of options on this TV for picture quality and a few for sound quality.  The sound is sharp, background noise-free, but only rarely seems \"surround-sound-like.\"  It can get pretty loud, but as with all these flat-screen TVs, not overpowering at its maximum setting.  The sound is fine!  I don't want a sound bar, so having decent sound from the TV was important--and this TV meets that requirement easily.No bells and whistles for this TV--no 3D, or internet, though it does accept PC input.  It's amazing as a TV, not as an alarm clock or as a recipient of streaming movies.  (It, of course, DOES have a sleep timer to set so as to make the TV turn off after a certain number of minutes or hours even, so that it doesn't stay on all night after you've fallen asleep.)The TV, apart from the picture, is extremely attractive (as a piece of furniture, i.e. when turned off!)-- it has a fairly thin bezel, no hanging speaker panel, and is VERY thin from front to back, like 3/4\".  An extremely modern, edge-lit LED TV.No, it doesn't swivel on its stand (few do), and yes, it takes like 15 seconds for the picture to come on upon power-up (as do ALL brands and models that I tried).Just a marvelous TV in all respects.  And again, the INCREDIBLE sharpness, realistic colors, and overall beauty of the picture (even when not in \"Vivid\" mode)--simply blow away the competition at ANY price, including the \"great\" Samsung. This Toshiba is a superb value ($649 at Costco for this 50\" version; the 46\" version was just put on sale from $539 to $499!)Great job, Toshiba!", "Date": "February 20, 2013"}, {"Title": "DO NOT BUY A TOSHIBA!!!!!!", "Author": "Kristy S.

Long story short, I was considering going with a VIZIO, so that I could get my 3D also for around the same price, but decided to go with a more established brand (although I hear really good things about VIZIO). Best Buy was also having some sort of sale on this model I believe, so with the 2-year warranty, I believe I ended up out the door having laid down $600 and change, with the TV around $500. For a 40\" and above TV in 1080p, the only other Tvs in that price range are going to likely be Dynex or Westinghouse....and Ive already been that route and been woefully unimpressed.Overall, Ive been very pleased with this televsion. Ive had it for I believe a little over a year now. I will admit that I had to return my first one. Starting shortly after I set it up, and becoming increasingly more noticeable as time went on, There were a series of fine, thin, rainbow colored lines coming out from the left hand side of the screen, reaching into the middle. It was a very small section, but still, it annoyed the hell out of me and I dont think I should have to deal with that right out of the box. But Im sure things do get mishandled and kicked around in the warehouses of stores like that, and I had had the foresight to buy the warranty (which is really one of the only things I love about Best Buy), so I hauled it back, and in less than 10 min, I was wheeling out the door with a new one, same model. The second one has worked almost flawlessly, with amazing picture. I head read that I couldnt connect the TV via DVI and get sound, but with an HDMI-DVI adaptor cable, and selecting \"TOSHIBA\" as default in Sound Manager on my PC, after months of trying to figure out, Im able to Play PC games, Netflix, etc, in stunning quality on this TV (dont forget to select \"game mode\" to eliminate the lagging response. With Steam's \"Big Picture\" and a wireless xbox 360 controller, I get all the benefits of console gaming, but in lightning fast 1080p.The only problem ive had with the second replacement television- has been more of an annoyance than a real problem. It happens so infrequently that I really dont mind, considering how pleased I am with my purchase. Every once in a while- like once every 2 or 3 days, in the middle of viewing (maybe something overheating?), the screen goes black for about 20-30 seconds, and doesnt respond to any remote presses or anything. Then, it flashes back to life, except its now on the local hispanic language channel, with some older Mexican man in a feathered headdress, with cactuses and a stuffed eagle, and oils and incense burning, snakeskins and crystals. Either that or telenovellas.  I guess my TV is posessed by a Mexican grandmother. Anyway, after being completely unresponsive for about 5 minutes, it goes back to normal, and I can control it again. It seems like unplugging the TV also does the trick, but like I said- everything else on the TV works fine, and its only a very minor annoyance, considering how problem free everything else with this TV has been. Maybe my viewpoint is a little skewed, but when your last television was a preowned 22\" LCD from craigslist that you had to lean a bookshelf against and duct tape the cords into the inputs to keep them steady so they didnt make a loud buzzing noise- this TV feels like heaven.SUMMARY: Great quality picture, great value. Comparable LEDs look to be at around $800-900. With a TV this thin, sound will always be an issue, but it isnt terrible at all, and its fine for most regular, low-volume Tv usage. And you can always look into a soundbar or dedicated computer/ speakers like im doing right now. The remote is definitely a bit cheap and the documentation that came with the TV was severely lacking in explaining the different features. However, after tracking down the model number, I was able to find a lengthly manual on the Toshiba website. Great to hook up to a PC. Great for gaming. at 120Hz, works with aftermarket 3D products. All in all, Im very satisfied with my purchase.", "Date": "April 23, 2013"}, {"Title": "excellent picture", "Author": "GDawg", "ReviewID": "R1E045SA3PW4AO", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Very impressed with the picture at 1080p.

This was one of only a few 40\" class units that had a width dimension under the 37.5\" limit.  The thin bezel also provides a very attractive look.  Was hoping the  reviews on the picture quality of this \"no frills\" set were accurate and I was not disappointed.  By following an early reviewer's recommendation for picture settings, some frustration was no doubt avoided and I was rewarded with a very acceptable picture at a bargain price.  As others have stated, turning off the clear frame 120Hz option produces a superior image for my tastes.  I use these settings for antenna, satellite and DVD inputs.  There is some delay at startup, but nothing to get too worked up about.  I like the 2-step mute button that cycles to half volume, then full mute and then back to full volume - provides an extra choice for handling the loud commercials.  The sound quality is exceptional for a flat panel TV, in my opinion.  No problem at all filling our family room with full sound and rarely need to push it over 10 unless there is extreme ambient noise.

Great picture and color when watching blu ray movies and over the air antenna 1080i tv shows, i.e. The Jay Leno Show.  I popped in a Blu ray version of Avatar on a sony bdp s390 and was very impressed with the picture.  The unit has good sound too.  When changing the channels, the remote control has a VERY VERY slow response time.  I've owned 2 of these units brand new and both units had this problem.  I returned the first unit due to \"ghosting\" or white smearing clouded images when dark black scenes from a movie or a tv show are watched, VERY irratating.  If you're not familar with 'ghosting', do a search and type 'led ghosting'.  Sadly, the 2nd unit I purchased has similar ghosting issues, but not as bad as the first unit; I should be able to tolerate it this time around, though one should not have to considering the fact that hard earned money was spent to pay for the tv.  When watching movies that take up the entire screen, the ghosting blemishes are not noticable, again, only in dark black scenes.  Another thing that is irritating, I believe it's called the stabilitation mode feature.  Make sure you set this mode to off, otherwise, character's movements on screen will appear very video game like, kinda like their movements have a floating look or appear as if their movements are in a slow fast forward motion, if that makes sense to you.  Also, cheap feeling remote controller.  I've yet to use the pc functions on the unit so I can't comment on that quite yet.  Overall, a solid B as a grade.  Try not to pay more than $500 for this unit tax and shipping included.  Paying over $500 for the unit isn't worth it, especially if ghosting images are present.

This was discouraging, also discovered that the set needs to have game mode enabled after every power cycle! Also discouraging. Other than that the picture is good, the black on my set is kind of ugly and gray and blotchy, maybe that is the light leaking? Only noticeable in very dark or black picture. Still, I believe this is the largest lowest cost LED 120Hz panel available currently. THese words describe the TV -- Beautiful, nice, smelly (mine stinks bad! Like poison plastic), easy to navigate, disappointing, simple, bright, good, considered returning, a little heavier than expected, cool, 3 stars for lies.The picture is great, the viewing angle is amazing, easy to press buttons on the side.Update 09.22.2012After getting some time to get used to the TV I am fairly satisfied. But there are some noticeable differences from the previous set that I was using that I did not expect. No 1080 support on VGA input, needing to enable 'game mode' every time the TV is powered on has become a nuisance but the speed at which the TV can process menu commands is acceptable and using the remote control is fairly simple. For general entertainment viewing/gaming the picture is enjoyable but the response time is a little low for a lot scenarios that are encountered when using a PC. Any high contrast images actually leave trails as the view is panned or resized, etc. when dark is replaced by light -- fade is highly apparent. The odor released by my set when in operation has filled the home since day of purchase and is not comfortable to breath. Has required frequent house air refreshes and disappointing when 100+ F degrees outside. But the odor is finally lessening after a few weeks. I definitely feel like I should have waited to make a purchase for a set. But I also find enough value to keep the TV.", "Date": "August 29, 2012"}, {"Title": "Great Picture!

A little bit of a green push but I prefer green over red accentuation.  The tinny sound is not a problem because I have a decent sound system to make up for it.  What was disappointing is that 1) this unit will remember all kinds of parameters persistently but game mode always shuts off if you change inputs or power off.  Not too bad to deal with but even with game mode, there appears to be a good 2-4 frames of input lag.  It puts me at a bit of a disadvantage in say Halo 4.  I play with my computer monitor (no input lag) and my roommates old Vizio 42\" and there is less lag.  It's still fun to play on but can be irritating to lose scores due to something you can't change.  A minor issue to note is that above backlight settings around 60, there is a TINY bit of backlight bleed at the top but it is almost not worth noting.

The picture is amazing: great contrast, deep blacks (for an LED), and colors that really pop. The design is simple, the screen super thin, the settings easy to control. It has no features to speak of, but I honestly just wanted an amazing picture and I don't care so much about the extras, especially for under $500.The Not-so-Good: My boyfriend and I play a lot of video games so we were really interested to try out Game Mode. As far as the picture goes, it works great; the problem is the sound. We have an old analog stereo system that we hooked up to the TV, and while it works in all of the other modes, the sound shuts off when we enter Game Mode. It appears that Game Mode will only accept digital audio for some reason, so now we are looking into getting a converter. Of course we can still use Game Mode with the built in TV speakers, but they sound pretty bad compared to our stereo and produce a bit of a crackling noise sometimes. The other option is to play games in another mode, which is what we're doing currently, but that means we have to deal with some lag time that makes games feel sluggish. Hopefully the converter will solve this problem.All in all I'm very happy with the purchase.

This is big for me because I use it mostly as the PC monitor extension and every time I have to disable the Game Mode.The unit didn't come with the M8 screws and for some reason, the wall mount supplier's screws just won't fit in the wall mount, so I had to cut the screws with a powersaw, so if you don't have the resource and you want a wall mount, you might run into trouble.  (the supplier's screws are either 10mm or 20mm and this one uses 16mm, which isnt available in home depot).Overall, I'm happy with the unit, with minor gripes (which may be dealbreakers for some people).

The sound was very tinny, which was less an issue for me because I have a sound bar but my wife doesn't use the sound bar enough to be familiar with its operation so she listened thru the TV's speakers.  It didn't have a clock - even though it required time-zone and daylight-savings-time entries. The remote had a cheap feel and was not laid out well so it was cumbersome to use. To change channels by entering the station numbers, the entire number with decimal point had to be entered. Other tvs will take the first number or 2 and take you to the closest station.

Good black levels to the eye as well as decent shadow detail and blu rays do look crisp and sharp as they should, would recommend putting it in preference mode and tweaking the settings as per recommended on various websites.
