This is my first HDTV, so I may not be an expert, but the picture is beyond my wildest hopes.  The details are bright, crisp, and first class.  You can see everything that you always imagined could be possible with excellent hdtv.  Look in the background of any scene and look at the books or dvds on shelves of the actors and you know who the characters are.  I have owned big screen tv for over 25 years.  Nothing compares to this picture.  Just hope it lasts - the bulbs are known to go out quickly.  I will follow up in a few months with updates.  Make sure you are hooked up to hd cable or hd satellite receiver.", "Date": "August 11, 2008"}, {"Title": "Reliability issues", "Author": "trystero", "ReviewID": "R2KZRQXMHS6TR9", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I purchased this TV a week ago. It arrived on a Friday; I took it out of the packaging and put it on the stand on Saturday; I went through the menus and set it up on Sunday; and Monday the screen wouldn't come on (and hasn't come on since).I opened a service ticket with Samsung with my warranty: they sent a tech out to my house to replace the system board, which had no effect. So I'm now waiting on a replacement DMD board, but they're out of stock, so this may be a while.So it's worked for me for just under two days. Not what I'd consider a sterling record.", "Date": "August 30, 2008"}, {"Title": "Beware of breakdown!", "Author": "Timothy Weygandt", "ReviewID": "RKNUUC6HYS37D", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I had my tv for 14 months and then kaplooey!!! Just out of warranty, the TV started blinking off and on by itself and then finally quit working. I couldn't get Samsung to take responsiblity at first till I researced and discoverd that my problems and syptoms are well documented all over the internet with other unsatisfied customers. I called the Better Business Bureau and filed a complaint, and Samsung could all of the sudden extend my warranty to cover the repairs. After two months of waiting for different parts, they are now saying that they have to replace a part they have already replaced once already. I still don't have a TV and Samsung customer service thinks that extending my warranty another 90 days is the resolution to this problem. THE JIST OF THIS IS THAT I PAID OVER $2000 DOLLARS FOR THIS TV AND AFTER 14 MONTHS, I HAVE NOT HAD A WORKING TV FOR OVER TWO MONTHS!!!!! That is very poor value and very poor customer service. I will not be purchasing another Samsung product EVER!!! Look it up! Samsung 72\" dlp problems.......just bing it or google it.", "Date": "July 16, 2010"}, {"Title": "HD Heaven", "Author": "S.
