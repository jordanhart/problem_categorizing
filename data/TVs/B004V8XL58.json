I bought one for the garage, because that's my exercise room and I can play my exercise videos there.The sound is good and loud, clear. The visual quality is good, I won't say great, just because well, when you compare it to a $400 tv that's like a plasma tv or something, it doesn't compare. BUT that said....for something basic, it's just perfect.The dvd works great. I love that I don't need to plug in anything, just stick the dvd in and and that's it. It plays automatically.", "Date": "October 6, 2011"}, {"Title": "Very Good, But---", "Author": "W. T. Towles", "ReviewID": "R24IALZLTEQNG1", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I bought this television for my office mainly for four reasons: its size, the built-in DVD player, the claim that it will maintain a constant volume from channel to channel, and the sound equalizer. A reasonable price also helped.It has met or exceeded expectations in all ways but one. The sound quality is poor--flat and tinny--and the equalizer cannot make the small and cheap internal speakers deliver near enough bass. I fixed the sound problem with a pair of external speakers (also from Amazon)--the Logitech X-140 2.0 speakers connected to the headphone jack on the side of the TV. They make a huge difference. So the total package of TV and speakers cost $281 with no shipping costs. Still not bad.TV setup was quick and easy and the remote is nicely laid out. I especially like the mute button. Its shape and location make it easy to find even in the dark. I use mute buttons a lot.Without the external speakers, I give the TV 4 stars. With the speakers, the combo gets 5.", "Date": "January 19, 2012"}, {"Title": "Exactly what I ordered", "Author": "Lauren", "ReviewID": "RNK4RRLHIDUHL", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Good size, and the DVD drive is very handy on the top of the TV.

Riffel", "ReviewID": "R2HEVXS2EDZ6ZO", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "My wife wanted a simple TV with a DVD player to watch her exercise videos while she worked out. There is no TV connection in the exercise room so I only needed to worry about the DVD portion. I also need to find a Birthday/Anniversary/Valintines Day gift, which is no easy task after 45 years of marriage. This unit was about $70 more than the no-name brands but got much better ratings.  I figured that the extra money might be worth it.  When she gets tired of working out (if you can call that wiggling around a workout)...in a few weeks... I'll use it to replace our small 15\" monitor on the spare computer. At least she was happy with her gift and now I'm happy for another year....what the heck will I get her next year....UGHHHH!", "Date": "March 11, 2012"}, {"Title": "a warranty that's not a warranty", "Author": "M. C. \"mahniah\"", "ReviewID": "R2CFQRKN39Q3P8", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I purchased this Magnavox TV and it came in a box that had been opened and was taped closed.  Looking back, I should have just sent it back.  But I set it up and right away there was a problem -- the sound goes off whenever it feels like it, and I have to turn the TV off and then on again.  That sometimes starts the sound, and sometimes, after it's turned on again, there's also no picture.  As you can imagine, it's a real nuisance. I contacted the dealer, and DataVision said they can't do anything, and to contact Magnavox directly, which I then did.Magnavox will not replace it with a new TV, but only with a refurbished TV.  Well, that's not so bad.  But they tell me that the process takes 2-3 months.  It starts with Magnavox sending me packing material in which to return the TV.  When they receive it, it will take a 2-3 weeks to process, and then they'll send out a  refurbished TV.  I've already gotten rid of my old TV, so I'll be without one for 3 or more weeks - no telling.  I really don't want to have no TV for that long.  That doesn't seem like much of a warranty.I hope they start including the warranty info on the product website - it would have been helpful to know that if I get a product that doesn't work properly, it will be replaced with a refurbished one in 2-3 mos.  I'll be more careful about warranty info in the future.", "Date": "June 5, 2013"}, {"Title": "At Last, a TV with sound", "Author": "S. Mitchell \"samintx\"", "ReviewID": "R2J1RO2MB97EXE", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I am so tired of getting TVs and the sound is so faint and no ordinary external speaker plugs. I do read the reviews here before ordering and appreciate the comments. I will say this TV has a DVD player, Lots of input ports and sound you can enjoy with external speakers but there is a connection for my Logitech twin speakers I got from Amz. The picture quality is very good but then I don't require extreme retina displays like an iPad. One thing I haven't found is on and off switch and other buttons to use on the TV without using the remote. Easy to setup and I'm a happy camper tonight.PS: on thing I don't like about this TV  ON AND OFF SWITCHES impossible to immediately find! They are underneath the front. You need (anyway I did) a flash light to see the words on the front bottom. Feel underneath and you will feel the buttons.Good price and Great Amz delivery!", "Date": "April 24, 2012"}, {"Title": "it's ok, sound is poor tho", "Author": "Denise Schroeder", "ReviewID": "R1UP3CFP9XWWAA", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "Picture is just fine.

BUT THEN SOMEONE SENT ALONG A POORLY DESIGNED STAND, ALMOST IMPOSSIBLE TO PUT IN THE 3 SCREWS WITH A REGULAR SCREWDRIVER AND ACUTE ARITHRITIC HANDS.  THE HOLE FOR THE THREE SCREWS COULD HAVE BEEN MADE MUCH LARGER FOR THE ATTACHING.  AND THEN WHEN THIS IS FINALLY COMPLETED, THE STAND IS WOBBLY WITH THE TV ON IT.BUT BACK TO THE TV, IT IS EXACTLY AS ORDERED AND MAKES A GREAT MONITOR FOR MY PC COMPUTER, TOO.  DID ATTACH THE LOGITECH SPEAKERS I ALREADY HAD WITH MY LAPTOP, SO SOUND AND PICTURE ARE NOW BETTER THAN EXPECTED AFTER READING SOME OF THE REVIEWS.OPENING THE BOX AND TAKING THE TV OUT COULD NOT HAVE BEEN EASIER.  NICE PACKAGING, NO FIGHTING IT.  A NICE INFORMATIVE MANUAL IS INCLUDED, BUT THE TV WENT RIGHT TO ONSCREEN SET UP AND I REALLY DIDN'T LOOK AT MANUAL UNTIL READY TO INSERT THE FIRST DVD.  WANTED TO MAKE SURE I WAS DOING IT RIGHT, SO DID INQUIRE OF THE MANUAL; HOWEVER, THAT COULD NOT HAVE BEEN EASIER, ALSO.  AND, ALSO, THE REMOTE IS EASY AND SELF EXPLANATORY.DO AGREE WITH THE ONE REVIEWER THAT SAID THE ON/OFF SWITCH IS A LITTLE HARD TO FIND THE FIRST TIME; IF HE/SHE HAD NOT SAID IN THEIR REVIEW WHERE IT WAS, I WOULD PROBABLY STILL BE LOOKING FOR IT.

Impressive sound compared to the Samsung - which sounded very tinny.  I don't have HD hookup so there is some graininess, but it's not bad at all after fiddling with the color, tone, brightness, sharpness,  etc.  And DVD's are really gorgeous.  I don't know why Consumer Reports lists Magnavox TV's poorly. FYI...there's no USB port on this model---sob. I bought this TV because of the reviews on Amazon, so I hope that my review can give someone else confidence.

I am comparing to my old TV, a TV/VCR combo circa 1996.DVD playback is also good but I haven't tried out all the many features.
