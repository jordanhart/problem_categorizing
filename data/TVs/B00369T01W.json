{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Excellent small and inexpensive TV/monitor", "Author": "SB Leo", "ReviewID": "R271EGZXJZ26GD", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I bought this TV to use as a small TV that I could carry around and also to use as a computer monitor sometimes. I was not surprised to see it looked very similar to my Samsung TVs because I read from a few websites that it was built with Samsung OEM parts. Even the menu and the setup were very much the same as those on the Samsungs. OTA HDTV quality was decent for a 720p TV of this size. SDTV channels looked better than I could get from the VSonic LCD TVs I also own. Sound quality was excellent considering the small size of the TV and the speakers. The audio was clear and loud even on the default settings. Besides the VGA input, the HDMI input and coaxial digital audio output were the nice bonuses that I didn't believe I could get with a 15''/15.6\" TV but this TV has them all. With a cheap antenna, I could get more than 50 DTV channels in the city. The TV looks very slick in glossy piano black. When used as a monitor, I was very pleased with the 1366x768 screen I got from my laptop via the VGA connector. I also tried the HDMI connection with my desktop and it looked excellent, too. Overall, I would highly recommend this TV to those who are shopping for a 15\" TV. Another plus is it has a 16:9 aspect ratio (which I prefer) and not the 16:10 that most other 13 to 19\" TVs have.", "Date": "April 9, 2010"}, {"Title": "Perfect for the price", "Author": "Benjamin", "ReviewID": "R2AJX77DS6ERC1", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Gee, some of the reviews here had me a bit nervous about purchasing this little tv, but I sure am glad I did.  Maybe these folks were expecting to plan a Super Bowl party around the little fella and were shocked that it doesn't compare to a Samsung 50 inch with surround sound?  For $100 I can't imagine doing better than this unit.  I bought it for our kitchen about three weeks ago and it's been perfect.  I even purposely held-off on my review in case it blew-up or the sound went out or it started summoning the undead, etc..  Nope - it pretty much does exactly what I bought it to do.The picture is great - nice and sharp.  I did see what people meant about the sight lines fading a bit if you get too far away, but this was easily corrected by veerry slightly tilting the unit upwards on the swivel stand which comes with it.  Our kitchen isn't exactly huge, but I can wander from one end to the other and see the picture just fine.  The sound is a total non-issue.  It's precisely the sound you'd expect from a 15\" tv if you're a realistic person.  I've never even had to turn it up all the way.I honestly think you'll enjoy this tv just fine.", "Date": "January 14, 2011"}, {"Title": "Barely acceptable", "Author": "Terry1022", "ReviewID": "RERYRFJNOYA0F", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "If you are looking for the cheapest, barely acceptable video component ... you found it. I bought this strickly because I have a limited budget and this met it. The colors are washed out on all the settings. The available angle of view is difficult if you are using this in an area like a kitchen. Probably no more than 50 degrees of working angle.The unit worked for approximately a month and a half. Shut it of one night come back the next day and the remote doesn't work ... at all. After trying a new remote it's been diagnosed as a bad remote reciever in the TV.... not acceptable on a unit that is only a few weeks old. All in all it's a stretch to give it 2 stars.Amazon was really great in offering to replace or refund. After looking on line at other issues with the brand, I've decided to spend the extra $30 and buy, from Amazon, a name brand I have confidence in.SPEND THE EXTRA $$$$.........", "Date": "September 9, 2010"}, {"Title": "Coby TFTV1525 15-Inch Widescreen TFT LCD 720p HDTV/Monitor with HDMI Input (Black)", "Author": "R.

Much better than I anticipated, but this is day one, we'll see.The sound? HORRIBLE, just like the other reviewers have said. My workaround? I picked up a pair of Logitech speakers for $11.88 at Walmart and plugged them into the headphone jack on the back of the TV. I set the sound to \"theater\" in the setup and problem is solved.It will not put out air bleeding volume as the tv over rides the volume control on the speakers, but it is plenty loud for my usual viewing. If I want to get blasted out of my chair, I go into the living room and turn on the home theater.Because Colby is known as a low end electronics company, I will probably buy a three year warranty from Squaretrade for about $15.00.

I was going to buy a DTV converter for 50 bucks and hook it up to an old CRT tv, but for just a little more, I could buy this TV.So, I did.I got the TV because it had VGA and HDMI inputs, I could hook my workstation computer up to it, and it was perfectly camouflaged.  Using a simple antenna, I was able to effortlessly pull in all my local TV affiliates and their DTV subchannels.  I was getting about 25 channels over the air for free.  I was able to effortlessly switch between the football game and the computer, in case my supervisor came by.The picture is fantastic.  Extremely crisp, HD, accurate colors, and very sharp resolution.  The games looked beautiful on this thing (again, using OTA antenna).  The sound is nothing special, but it's more than adequate for any normal sized room.  My only complaint with the picture is that when you don't look at it straight-on, the picture goes a bit photo-negative, making odd viewing angles challenging.Another thing I like is that this TV is extremely portable.  I've taken it to and from work, outside, to tailgates, and it just works well each time.  Because its so small and flat, I'm able to set it up virtually anywhere.  When I was laid up after surgery in my small bedroom, I fit this tv, along with a videogame system on a small dresser.  It's really convenient.Finally, the price is fantastic.  I can't find any other 720p HDTV for this price point.  That was what really sold me on it.  I was worried that it might be a cheap piece of junk, but I have been quite satisfied with my purchase.So, if you need a TV that goes anywhere, has great clarity, and gets HD...save yourself some cash and buy this one.

Harrison", "ReviewID": "R2B068TGXF6QI7", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I bought this unit about a year ago to replace a dead CRT type TV that we'd been using in our kitchen.It works fine, and has an acceptable picture, plus the price was good, especially with free prime shipping.The only somewhat bizarre characteristic I've noted is that the unit often turns itself on when we turn on the lights in our kitchen!!  We've got a track lighting system with five compact fluorescent lamps installed.  The pulsations from the lamps, at start-up, must simulate the IR pattern that the remote control sensor uses for the \"on\" command!  At first, we thought the darned thing was just coming on at random, but then it became obvious that whenever this happened, it was always associated with having turned the Kitchen lights on.The TV takes quite a while to turn on (or off) after giving it the command, so that's why it wasn't obvious immediately that it was switching on the lights that was turning the TV on.Another somewhat annoying design issue is that the jack to accept headphones is on the back of the TV with the other connectors.  When someone wants to watch without bothering someone else, they have to pull the TV out to them, turn it around, and then find the little jack to plug the headphones in.  It would be enormously easier if the jack was on the front as it almost always is on other TVs.  And using an extension cable doesn't solve the problem because plugging the 'phones into the jack disconnects the speaker, and unplugging them reconnects it.  And that's an important feature since the whole point of using the headphones is to silence the on-TV speaker.  So that is something that's proven to be an issue for our purposes.  If you never intend to use the headphone jack, then having it on the back won't be of any consequence.", "Date": "March 7, 2012"}, {"Title": "nice TV", "Author": "pgailc", "ReviewID": "R11K1NVFLEP8JH", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I purchased this TV for my kitchen.

The little blue LED on the unit; when the power button was pressed it would light up like it was going to turn on, but them would turn off then come back on with the standby light then the entire unit powered off. There is absolutely no information in the owners manual. All it says is to unplug for 30 seconds and replug... didn't work. It still take at least 10 tries turn on, can't return it because my son threw away his receipt. The only way I would recommend this TV to another person is they planned to make a camp fire with it. Also even when the TV does come on it has the worst viewing angle I have ever seen. I had to put the TV on a Spool of dental floss the increase the viewing angle. I have never seen a TV that cannot be tilted. So to remedy this problem I will never turn the TV off. Instead I will just put it on a black source like AV so there is just a black screen. This is in fact the worst purchase I have ever made. They did such a great job...making this TV defective. I feel sorry for anybody else who has bought this TV because it is the most unreliable piece of junk I have ever owned. I have owned a small 9-10\" TV back from the 70's and it still works just fine, goes to show how cheap these TV companies are getting these days. If your going to buy a TV make sure it is a reliable company like LG or Samsung. I will never buy another Coby product again.

Found out that a widescreen movie on this widescreen TV on Normal Mode (there are 4 modes: Normal, 16:9 Widescreen, 4:3, and Cinema) DOES NOT fill the screen.  There is @1.5-inch black border on the top and bottom, and @2-inch black border on each side.  So essentially, this 15.6-inch screen TV is an 11-inch screen TV.  4:3 Mode looked exactly the same as Normal Mode.  Widescreen Mode stretched everything to the sides but still had @1-inch black border top and bottom, Cinema Mode is useless as probably at least a quarter of the image is lost all around.I called Coby and spoke with someone who advised me that the way to fix this is to buy fullscreen DVD's and play them on Widescreen Mode.  Huh???  Isn't this a widescreen TV??  Shouldn't I be able to buy widescreen DVD's to play on my widescreen TV and it will fill the whole screen??  When we watch DVD's at home on the 32-inch Sanyo, the movies fill the screen.  Why not this one?I'd like to return this but I didn't hook it up for a while, so it's probably been too long.

You see their products everywhere from Wal-Mart to Best Buy to here on Amazon, and it just erodes my confidence in the store-- I know that COBY means cheap, but it just drags down Amazon's reputation as a reliable retailer.
