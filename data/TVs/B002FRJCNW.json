Sometimes, after it's been on a really long time, if the screen might go black if it overheats. However, just wait for it to cool and turn it back on. The picture is not the best that I've seen, but for the price, it's worth buying.", "Date": "February 16, 2010"}, {"Title": "VO420E", "Author": "Eric", "ReviewID": "RDG5W9RQ47R70", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I replaced a sony bravia kdl-32M4000 with this HDTV not expecting it to be quite as good.  It turns out its much better the sony had poor backlight uniformity, Color saturation, black level.  The Vizio is much better in all those cases. All though the black level is still not as good as i would want its still very good such as it is for a CCFL backlit LCD.
