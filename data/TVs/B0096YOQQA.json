{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Surpasses my expectations,but  read my update before buying!", "Author": "serenic", "ReviewID": "R8YI26Y8J1X54", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This set replace a 27\" CRT TV which broke down.I found the set-up easy, although I had to call Vizio tech support twice during the process to walk me through the settings. They were quick to respond and politely and expeditiously walked me through in clear English (they are located in the U.S.A)I was initially satisfied with the video, but found the audio to be tinny and annoying.At the time of order through Amazon, I also ordered the low priced HDMI cables and Square Trade 3 year warranty for $ 29. Two days later, my cable guy replaced my TV box with an HD box using a more substantial HDMI cable than what I ordered. I was flabbergasted with the result. The video filled the screen with a picture of photographic clarity and the sound quality is such, that I shelved my plan to use external speakers. I couldn't be happier with the end product.I returned the cables to Amazon using their prepaid shipping label (the shipping charge was equal to the price of the cables. I swear by Amazon and would not think of making a purchase without the feedback of their reviews.While I made my purchase based on all the favorable reviews and the promise of tech support for the life of the TV, I have a bit of trepidation after reading many complaints concerning their service. My cable guy assures me that they had a lot of trouble with their sets until two years ago and stated he now considers their TVs to be of high quality with lowest prices.Update: I remain very pleased with the quality of the video and audio.Following are the picture settings I have adjusted, which you might find helpful.they apply to a movie picture setting using Cablevision with a TV box with HDM1 cable.backlight ... 66brightness .. 52contrast .... 49color ....... 45tint ........  0sharpness ...  4UPDATE#2 (April 7,2013): After owning this set for two months, I am still amazed at the quality of the video and audio. There are,however,some occurrences which may benefit you through my recent experience which may be food for thought. Before I go further,be aware that like many other seniors in my age group, I  have little understanding of the technical jargon and comprehension of today's communication devices that go beyond the science of conversation with the aid of two dixie cups and string.Shortly after Cablevision installed an HD box and HDMI cable which brought out the picture and sound quality that pleased me, I noticed a lipsync problem that became manifest on several cable channels(the sound lagged behind the picture with progressive gapping to two or three second after an hour's viewing.)Cablevision made four attempts to correct the problem, changing the HD boxes three times and the HDMI once without any success.I contacted Vizio support and was told to change the PMC setting on the HD box. Cablevision stated there is no PMC setting on the boxes used and they didn't know what a PMC refers to. Finally, Vizio suggested doing away with the HDMI cable and use three single cables in its place and I will get the same reception quality that the HDMI cable provides. This was done by cablevision and the video and audio became synchronized. It was explained to me that an HDMI cable is composed of three cables in one.While I now enjoy watching talking heads without words trailing their sealed lips, I must pull out wires and plug in the jacks of my DVD in their place since it does not have an HDMI connection. This is somewhat of a nuisance, but I rarely use my DVD and it is not much of an effort, less so than having to return the set to Vizio and be further aggravated.I must add that Vizio responded to my e-mails within minutes or hours and were quick to respond to telephone calls. They are headquartered in South Dakota and speak in good old Americanese. Also Cablevision was very responsive and courteous in their attempts to correct the problem.The question remains as to whether my problem is limited to only my set or is it prevalent to this model? What HD boxes are compatible with this set?I mention the above to save you the aggravation I experienced the past six weeks of multiple calls and tech visits.If you want to discuss this problem, feel free to forward your comments.P.S. I changed the menu settings above from what I previously listed, increasing the picture quality.UPDATE #3i HAVE OWNED THIS SET 7 MONTHS AND REMAIN JUST AS PLEASED AS STATED IN PRIOR REVIEWS. I HAVE RATED 5 STARS FROM 4 AFTER HAVING MORE CONFIDENCE WITH TIME. I AM ESPECIALLY DELIGHTED WITH THEIR CUSTOMER SERVICE WHICH IS HANDLED IN A VERY CAPABLE, PROFESSIONAL AND POLITE MANNER, WITH NO ENGLISH SPEAKING BARRIERS.", "Date": "February 11, 2013"}, {"Title": "What I consider to be a budget friendly LCD TV.", "Author": "Thomas (Sherri's husband)", "ReviewID": "R3DSTDVIX5M4W2", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "First things first, as most might already know, there's a sibling to this Vizio offering, an E420D-A0.  The \"D\" is for 3-D.  The 3-D model also has Wi-Fi capability and a 120Hz refresh rate.  We chose the 2-D model.I've had the unit setup for an afternoon and have put in about four hours of viewing; \"Cowboys and Aliens\" was the main movie watched and several newscasts.  I have not watched any sporting events such as tennis or hockey so I can't say how well the television handles fast moving, small objects like a hockey puck or a tennis ball.  If I come across any niggles that a consumer should know about, I'll comeback and post follow-ups and if no follow-ups, then everything is performing as one would expect.The unit was easy to set up.  A very simple auto-setup came up when first turned on; language and the user was ask if they wanted to do a cable based, auto-channel select routine.  Other than that, if like us, using a HD cable box, I set the appliance to accept the HDMI input from the cable box and everything came right up.  I programmed the cable box remote and after entering the fifth number choice on the list, the cable box remote now operates both the cable box and the television.The unboxing was a normal event.  The only assembly was attaching the base to the already attached base neck, attached to the television with three hex head screws and the provided allen wrench.The out of the box colors, are set to factory specifications and I found them to be excellent.  There was a minor tweaking with contrast to improve movie shadow detail in nighttime movie scenes.  Other than that, everything is good to go, right out of the box.At this point, there's not much to add.The unit comes with a quick start manual and that's it.  If one wants, the full manual is a download from VIZIO.COM/SUPPORT.The unit has full back lighting as opposed to edge lighting.  Because it's has full back lighting, the case is deeper (thicker) then edge lit units but for the thicker case, one has much better contrast.  When we compared this unit to other units of similar size and price that were setup next to the unit, we immediately found the image of this unit to be a bit better in overall image quality.It was brighter, cleaner and had more image definition (sharper) than the Vizio unit next to it or the Toshiba unit that was a 46\" unit, and next in line, to the left, of a three television display.  When one stood in the middle of the three television display, equidistant from this unit and then compared image quality to the 46\" Toshiba unit to the left, this unit had the better overall image quality.Colors are excellent.The unit has a 6ms refresh rate.Our cable box provides a 720P/1080i signal and the image quality is excellent.We won't have a Blu-ray player hooked up so I can't comment on 1080P resolution.We have cordless headphones hooked up to this unit and the sound quality is excellent.  The speakers sound fine; not tinny or weak.For easy access, the controls are on the edge of the left bezel.The television has, as is typical, two connection sites.  One on the left edge of the bezel and one on the same side but in the back.If I have to give some negative ink, it would be no 3-D, no 120Hz feature and lacks any Wi-Fi capability for easy software upgrade capability.  Nothing that a convenient thumb drive won't fix.FYI, the stand is a fixed stand and does not have the much needed base, swivel component.Other then these obvious niggles that with the exception of a missing swivel component, for a hundred dollars more, the sibling version has the listed missing features.  At the time of writing this review, I have no user complaints and if one is looking for a budget minded, 42\", full back lit, LCD television with a great image, in my opinion, this unit will make you happy.  In short, there are no shortcomings to feel the need to get over.Hope the above helps in your buying decision........................................Note: When I made the purchase, I purchased the extended three year warranty contract.Disclosure: the unit we have was purchased yesterday at a big box warehouse.

Stand and positioning is a little strange...", "Author": "KDM", "ReviewID": "R3KVNJW847EURH", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I was looking for a TV for the kitchen that fits in a cabinet so I had a limited size that I could work with. I really wanted at least a 26 inch TV.I had originally purchased a Samsung UN26EH4000 26 inch LED TV based on the excellent reviews,however when I got it hooked up I was dismayed with the pixelated picture quality with my DirecTV HD receiver.I started looking for other 26 or 28 inch TVs when I saw this 29 inch Vizio. I looked at the product dimensions hoping it would fit and to my surpise it was an exact match! And it was 3 inches larger than the Samsung to boot! At the time there were no reviews available so I really didn't have anything to go by except for prior experience with a 22\" Vizio LED (still working, just wanted something larger). I decided to buy it knowing that Amazon has a great returns policy. I figured I would compare it to the Samsung and return which ever one I did not like.The assembly of the TV is very easy. The stand is not a typical flat panel stand (more on this later). It installs easily by just snapping into place and there are 2 screws that are hidden from the bottom to install. Very easy to install though. From there it is typical install of plugging in your cables.This TV has 2 HDMI ports, and the first port supports Audio Return Channel (ARC) which is a nice feature if you are going to hook up an AV receiver. It also supports standard composite and component connections and a PC connection.For audio connections it has an optical audio out connection and a 1/8 inch mini-jack audio out. This 1/8 inch jack is a standard headphone jack and the volume control of the TV controls the volume of this jack. THe Samsung TV does NOT have this feature and I sorely missed it. I use the 1/8 mini jack to hook up a nice pair of computer speakers for better sound and being able to turn off the TV speakers and still use the volume control from the remote to control external speakers is a great convenience.The picture on this TV is noticely nicer than the picture on the Samsung. Within a minute of hooking it up my wife instantly said this picture was noticeably better than the Samsung, which is strange because when I mentioned that I didn't like the Samsung picture she said it looked fine to her! Women, go figure! Just kidding. Both are 720p resolution but the Vizio is a much nicer picture. When you are close to the TV (within 3-5 feet or so you can start to notice a lower resolution but from a greater distance, 720p is more than adequate. I would suggest getting 1080p for anything larger.The internal speakers really are not too bad. They aren't surround sound quality but they are fairly robust and actually sort of loud. I forgot to plug in the external speakers at first and though they were being used because the sound was that good. As with most flat panel TV's there is very little bass.THe only strange (not negative, just different) thing about this TV is the stand. This TV does not have a standard upright stand. The stand consists of a V shaped bar that attaches at the bottom back of the TV and the TV actually leans back about 5 degrees to stand up. For my application this is good and bad. The tilt actually helps alleviate some glare from straight on light sources. For us, this TV is in an upper cabinet in the kitchen the TV leans back and it looks a little strange sitting in the cabinet, but in no way affects the functionality. Just be aware that it sits this way when purchasing. One of the stock images shows the approximate tilt of the TV when using the stand. It also has standard VESA mounts if you wanted to utilize an arm.The TV itself is slim. It isn't the slimmest TV but it is pretty slim. The outside frame is also minimal and provides for an overall sleek appearance to the TV.Aside from the funky stand, I would rate this TV a 4.95 stars out of 5.", "Date": "November 27, 2012"}, {"Title": "audio cuts out - a possible solution", "Author": "Amazon Customer", "ReviewID": "R98TXUZDZSUGX", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I selected this model for its 1080P resolution (rare in this size class). I had purchased one, and the audio continued to shut off, and as others have said, the only way to restore volume was to turn tv off and then back on, a process which takes 30-45 sec.  This happened 6x so far today, random and irregular.  Went to customer service at Vizio, they said I could send it in for repair, 3 week turnaround.  Not going to happen.  Returned to BJ's, got a replacement, and it is doing the same thing. I see others share this problem, and it is clearly a Vizio issue.  Vizio then suggested getting FIOS to change the audio output of the set top box (convertor box) from digital audio to PCM audio.  Verizon FIOS could not help me with that so far.  Vizio told me that some cable boxes seem to trigger the vizio set to shut its volume off. Be forewarned on this model.  Do not know if it can affect other vizio sets or not. (Have no problem with my 47\" vizio in living room.) This set had decent sound and a nice picture, but this problem is annoying to say the least.  I will next try replacing the HDMI cable with the component cables, but this means 5 cables stuffed behind the tv vs. the nice simple HDMI cable!

Surprizingly, and probably to the disappointment of many who later buy sound bars/systems, many Samsungs/LGs around this size/price range do not have a digital out. That's idiotic even for low end systems.Packaging was excellent. (Though if you have delivery concerns re: security/theft note it ships in a Vizio box - people are going to know it's a brand new flat screen. I arrived home to it just sitting in my common entranceway.)Set-up is straightforward and super-fast. Remote is well-built but nothing special. Sound is suffcient for casual viewing, but for gaming or an immersive movie watching experiance you'll need to upgrade. (That's true of almost all internal TV speakers.) Sound maintains well at high volumes.Black levels are quite good for such an inexpensive TV. Level of detail is great and I haven't noticed any artifacts, trails, etc. BUT, as other reviewers noted, there is a brightness issue with this unit - noticed it right away. Menu options are basic and, because there is no real backlight control, it doesn't seem changing settings would remedy the problem. I spent a couple of days going back and forth, trying to decide whether I should return this TV - it's just nowhere near as bright as the 46\" Samsung LCD in my living room. But because we are using it in the bedroom, typically with the lights low or off, I've decided to keep it. It's a good quality unit at an excellent price, and other than the backlight issue, delivers in every way.", "Date": "December 18, 2012"}, {"Title": "Not bad, not great", "Author": "MinneMan \"CJ\"", "ReviewID": "R1CPV5DE2522K5", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Unboxing it, I was impressed by the construction and design.  I didn't see evidence of cutting corners to keep price down.Turning it on, I wasn't impressed by the picture at all.  It was dim and had too much contrast and not enough gradation of tones.  None of the presets were useable so I had tailor a custom setup.  It took some messing around with the settings over a couple of days to get a picture I could be satisfied with.  The automatic backlighting feature, which adjusts the brightness to the room's ambient lighting, was getting in the way so I had to disable it.Comparing it with two other flat screens TV's I have (non-LED), I think this one is the least bright and the least able to finely render the delicate color shading of skin tones.  It also seems to have an odd color palette on solid tone graphics.  I have two computer monitors that are LED and are they're bright and render color very well, so I don't blame the picture deficiency on being LED design.To get it bright enough for my needs, it lost some of the depth of the blacks, but it's not bad in that regard.  The image is sharp enough to read very small text across the room.  Viewing angle is superb in all directions.  The image doesn't change in appearance as you move from side to side.The sound is decent.  You won't need an add on sound system unless you want to hear bass.  The SRS surround simulator is interesting.  It can over-exaggerate the spread of the sound sometimes, but it does help on most content.  The feature that automatically rides the volume for you is pretty useful.The remote is quite nice and was easy for me to learn, although I don't need it.  The thin frame case is simple and elegant.  The base is very stable.  The screen is not very anti-glare and I can see reflections from windows and lamps pretty clearly when the unit is turned off.  Not a big issue when it's on.It has 2 HDMI inputs along with the older style analog inputs.  For those adding a sound system, it has an optical output (fixed volume) and a pair of RCA outputs (selectable fixed or variable volume).All things considered, it's a good value.  It seems well made.  If you're looking for a knockout picture or wanting to use it in a very bright room, maybe there are better choices out there.  If I weren't very tightly constrained by the space I have to fit a TV into, I probably would have returned it for a 40\", of which there seem to be a lot more to choose from.", "Date": "November 30, 2012"}, {"Title": "Vizio has many quality problems", "Author": "Bob G", "ReviewID": "R2PGKAY4W4ACK7", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "After only 14 months both of the HDMI ports on my Vizio failed.

The picture is amazing and it is large enough for everyone to see in my massive living room. The only real problem with the TV was a noticeable dimming of the middle of the TV during movies as well as TV shows. At arbitrary times the Vizio would get dark in the very middle of the entire screen. I was able to fix the problem doing the following:1) Go into the picture menu and you will find the option for more that will take you to the advanced picture menu.2) Under the advanced picture menu you will find \"Adaptive Luma\" which you would want to set to off and the \"Smart Dimming\" which would need to be set to off as well.3) If these settings are off but the issue is still occurring then we would perform a series of resets to the TV. The first reset would be to unplug the TV from the wall outlet and then press and hold the power button on the TV itself for 30 seconds and then plug the TV back in. Test to see if the problem is still happening after reset.4) If issue is still happening after the power cycle of the TV then we would factory reset the TV by pressing menu on the remote, going in to \"help\" on the menu and selecting \"clear memory (factory default)\". The default code is 0000. It will ask you if you're sure you want to reset and then select yes and the TV will turn off and then back on.5) After the factory reset go back in to the advanced picture menu and make sure the \"Adaptive Luma\" and the \"Smart Dimming\" are still off.The dimming was due to a power-saving setting.

I got it refurbished from another store for under $200.APPEARANCE:This is a great looking TV. The pictures make it look extremely thick, but it's really not---and the bezel is thin enough to make it look more modern than most other TVs.The thin bezel also allows the screen to be a little bigger than most 32\" TVs, even though it takes up the same amount of space. So that's nice. This TV is the perfect size for a small bedroom. For a living room, game room, or bigger bedroom, you'll want something bigger.SETUP:Relatively straightforward. You have to attach the TV to the stand, basically. There are two sets of screws, and the manual doesn't make it clear enough which screws go where. I had some trouble because of this. Maybe I'm just dumb. Just remember that the longer screws are used to attach the base to the stand, while the shorter screws attach the stand to the actual TV.Once you power on the TV for the first time, it guides you through some really simple setup steps. No big deal. After that, you're free to change whatever other settings you want.REMOTE:It's a remote. I guess there's nothing wrong with it, but it doesn't have a backlight and it can ONLY be used to control the TV, so I'd recommend using a nice universal remote instead.VIDEO QUALITY:Coming from a 27\" CRT, this is an amazing upgrade. The black levels and sound (both common complaints for non-CRT TVs) are phenomenal. You'll have to mess around with the picture settings to get everything perfect, but that's to be expected.This is only a 32\" TV, so 1080p is unnecessary. Save yourself some money and go with 720p.If I have to make one complaint, I've noticed that really dark scenes can sometimes appear a little too dark, but it's not a huge problem.AUDIO QUALITY:Much better than I expected. The bass isn't going to shake your house, but if you put this TV in a small room, it doesn't sound the least bit empty or tinny.FEATURES:This is a very barebones TV, but that's fine with me. I would've appreciated a third HDMI port, but again, I can't complain for the price. Plus, it's not like switches don't exist.I also would've appreciated separate composite and component inputs---one of the ports is shared, so you'll have to pick one or the other. Most TVs I've seen have multiple composite/component inputs, but this TV only has one...again, not a big deal, since I already have a switch.There's also no internet connectivity (you'll want the E320i-A0 for that), so no \"smart\" TV features are available. This won't be a problem for anyone who already has a Wii, Wii U, PS3, Blu-ray player, or any other device that can run Netflix, Hulu, etc.The USB port only allows you to view pictures, which is sort of useless for me, but some people might find it handy. I purchased an HDMI media player to watch movies with.I guess what I'm saying is that as long as you're fine with buying several cheap devices to add functionality, this TV is a great starting point. If you're the type of person that likes to have everything on one device, you might want to spend a little more.

This used to be an issue with commercials but with the passage & implementation of the CALM Act (Law passed by Congress that makes it illegal for commercials to be broadcast at louder volume) that's less of an issue.

Wanting to get a smaller TV for a second bedroom, I stumbled upon the TV featured here, the VIZIO E320-A1 32-inch 720p 60Hz LED HDTV TV at a friends house. He had just purchased it from Amazon. Upon checking out the TV; I felt as if it was missing some features that I was looking for. My friend was a little upset, but eventually pleased when I told him that he might want to return it to Amazon and get something else. While the picture and sound are excellent on this model; unless you're only buying a TV for the basics; I'd spend a little extra and get one that has more features than this. On the other hand; if all you need are the basics, look no further, as you won't find a better picture on any other 32\" TV. This one comes with only 2 HDMI ports, which in my opinion is too few. There's no picture in picture, and more importantly, there's no Apps for streaming video. It comes with a very thin bezel(a great feature), as do all of the new Vizio TV's. The 720P resolution is superb, and is all that's needed on a TV of this size. As mentioned above; the surround sound was exceptional and quite an improvement over previous generation Vizio TV's. While at his house; I watched a few minutes of a soccer game, and found the picture to be extremely stable, with virtually no blurring effect during movement. The problem with the TV(for some people, not all) is that for the price, or slightly more; you can get one that has a lot more features. My friend knew nothing about streaming video, as he gets Netflix DVD's by mail. When I told him about the streaming feature available on most new TV's; he agreed that he had probably made a bad choice for him, which does not mean that this would be a bad choice for others. The bottom line is that if you're looking for a basic TV without streaming capability; this is an excellent choice. If you want more features, such as are available on most new TV's, than I would look elsewhere. Keep in mind that many people have no interest in streaming video, and as such this TV IS a superb choice.", "Date": "November 7, 2012"}, {"Title": "So much bang for the buck, it's hard to believe.", "Author": "Manaan", "ReviewID": "R3VQI3ASFBUM72", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "There are two things you need to look for when buying a TV.1. Contrast Ratio. Average TV's have about 1:4000 to 1:7000. This thing has 1:100,000. That alone should add $100 to the price of this TV, but yet it's only $388.2. Refresh rate. 60 Hz is plenty for a TV. 60 is approaching the upper limits of human eye capability, forking out $$$ for a 120 or going for lower-quality plasma for a 600 Hz refresh rate is pointless.Smart TV's are pointless when you have BR players with youtube, netflix, pandora, etc built in them.

There's no sub-woofer/bass, so if you want to feel the sound in the floor you're going to have to get a sound system.The auto-dim adjust feature makes this thing work out-of-the-box without having to fiddle with settings.

I wanted to provide my impressions of the model.  I find actual user reviews to be very helpful when deciding on whether to buy a TV or any electronic device.This TV is not a top of the line Vizio model.  This is a good, entry level LED TV. The TV looks great. It has a very thin bezel, which makes the screen look even bigger.  The Vizio user interface is easy to use.  The included remote only works the TV, but our cable remote functions well to control the TV.Now, as to the picture.  This is the heart of the matter.  I'm used to LCD screens, which seem brighter out of the box than LED.  This TV's picture was very dark and washed out when I set it up.  Partly is was my familiarity with LCD screens that made the screen look so dark by comparison.  The Vizio pre-set picture modes all seemed dark.  The Vivid mode was the brightest, and is the mode I use for all inputs with some adjustments. I have either turned off or lowered the Vizio automatic ambient light adjustment that comes automatically set on the TV.  I found that it kept the screen too dark.  By turning it off, the picture has brightened considerably.I expect that most users will probably need to adjust the picture mode to suit their taste.  This has to be done for each input (TV, HDMI, etc.).  The mode and adjustments you select for an input only apply to that input.  While this is a bit frustrating, it does make sense.  Over the air TV, cable input, or streaming video will be fed into the TV through different inputs and will need different adjustments to achieve the optimal picture.  If you really don't like the adjustments you've made, the good news is that there is a reset button to reset the adjustments you made to the TV to factory settings.  If I remember, this does reset all the picture modes to factory settings. The most bang for the buck with adjustments is the backlighting and contrast.  This really helps picture quality and brightness.I find that the picture is relatively sharp, but still not as sharp as the LCD screens I'm used to.  However, the overall look of all programs on the TV, including the HD programs streaming through my Roku, look very good.A few comments about the sound.  For a TV at this price, you might expect the sound to be somewhat thin.  It is not.  The sound quality is very good.  We have this TV in our bedroom, and rely on the TV's speakers for sound.  The sound is relatively full, with not a lot of bass.  You can hook the TV into your sound system, and you have the flexibility to set the TV to deliver digital or analog signal (and you can select the type of digital processing you need).After several days of use, I have come to appreciate the picture on the TV.  While still not overly bright, the contrast and sharpness is pleasing.  My rating of 4 out of 5 is based primarily upon the price and the acceptable TV picture after adjustment.  You aren't going to find a better picture or value at this price point.  You can spend more, but this TV works very well for us. To be clear, though, I wouldn't consider this TV as the centerpiece of a top-notch home theater system.  For that, you will probably want to spend more (probably much more) for a much better out-of-the box picture.

So I went to a local store to look at another one.  Same issue, uneven backlighting.  It can best be described as looking through a sheet of glass with dust smudges scattered about it.

The 32 inch size is perfect for the cabin and the picture we were completely happy with.  However the sound was a bit to be desired. At times the sound was just fine and at times the speakers sounded like they were blown. Sounded like we had the speakers over loaded. Completely annoying. We watched 3 different DVD's because we are in the sticks so to speak and can not get any signal.  Cable is not available and we do not pay for Dish or Direct TV.  So our signal comes from a Sony Blu Ray with a HDMI cable.  All 3 movies were the same sound wise.  So we took it back and bought a 32 Samsung 4003 series TV.  I honestly can not say the Samsung is better or worst picture wise but the sound is superior in comparison to the Vizio. This last rainy weekend we watched 3 DVD's some were Blu Ray and some were not.  We could not tell which was a Blu Ray and which one was not. So the Samsung has a new home and we are happier for it.I do wish the Vizio worked out because I know the control panel by heart and it is much easier to set up. I feel that the Vizio has a more user friendly system with more optional settings to customize. But the sound was the deal breaker.It was something we just could not live with.I do want to comment that Vizio 800 number customer service was excellent to deal with.

The 32 inch screen feels almost theater-size compared to the 20-inch I used to have in my room. It's hard to tell without seeing it in person, but the TV is very classy looking and should look good in any home. The thing I love most is how thin the bezel is. In a dark room the screen just kinda floats there.As for quality and features, the biggest drawback of this television is obviously the lack inputs. I lucked out because I'm ONLY using this TV to play video games and watch movies, but others might find the number of inputs completely inadequate. There are only two HDMI ports, which is bad enough, but the Component and Composite inputs are shared as well, placing huge limits on the number of items you can connect. If you're a gamer like me then you're limited to only one old-school console. And if you're setting this up for basic TV and movies then think very carefully about the components you'll have to hook up and if you have the proper connections.I won't say much about the sound and speakers because if you actually care about audio then you've already got a solution for that. But if you just need a TV for the bedroom then the sound should be fine for you.The picture on the TV is clear and the colors are rich and deep, but the standard picture setting is overly warm and has way too much contrast. Changing the picture mode to \"Computer\" relaxed the colors and provided a true white. I lowered the contrast and raised the brightness almost to max in order to achieve an almost perfect picture. It takes a LOT of tweaking, but this product is certainly capable of a displaying a nice picture.EDIT 8/20/13 *After owning the TV for several months and calibrating it properly, I have to say that it's one of the best looking televisions I've ever seen. Proper calibration is important. High end TVs are probably capable of a superior picture, but I've never seen one set up correctly! Using the free \"AVS HD 709\" calibration tool, I was able to get the black and white levels perfect. Using the same tool on a 50-inch Bravia I couldn't achieve settings of the same accuracy. Whatever you do don't settle for the factory/showroom settings. *END EDIT*One thing I couldn't figure out was how to change the backlight level. You have to find the Advanced Picture Settings and set \"ambient light sensor\" to Off or Low. What the ambient light sensor does is adjust the backlight based on the amount of light in the room. It's actually a very useful feature, but enabling it removes backlight control completely.An interesting thing I noticed is that the TV is advertised as 720p, but when receiving a 1080p signal the display reads \"1080p\" in the right corner. So maybe it IS displaying 1080p? Who knows. Regardless, the picture looks phenomenal. I'd say it's on par with my 50-inch Sony Bravia. Another thing I like is the design of the remote. It's very small, sleek, and easy to use.I tried to cover all the little things that separate this TV from others. But if you're just looking for a cheap TV with a great picture, you can put your faith in this one. It's really a beautiful television and the ONLY thing I can really complain about is the lack of inputs.", "Date": "April 21, 2013"}, {"Title": "Not the best color", "Author": "joe jarvis \"magnoila joe\"", "ReviewID": "R2DIPYP0AB6S0G", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I recently purchased this LED HDTV for price, size and for having had great results with another Vizio TV.

The images are clear & look just the way they should without me having to reprogram colors or anything like that. The TV does come with pre-programmed picture settings like \"General, \"Movie\", \"Game\", \"Vivid\", \"Football\", etc. that influence the colors & brightness (Including other sport options). I tend to stick with game because that's what I'm using it for normally. I did have to dig through it's settings to find the \"Ambien Light-Sensor\" setting & turn it off because I think it was sensing it's own light & dimming the screen. The speakers might not be the best, however they get the job done fine & they don't offer any problems. It may not be the best as a computer/laptop monitor, but given how the TV does with PS3 & PS4, I doubt it's too much of the TV's fault things aren't too clear. I do use HDMI to connect the TV & computer but I just think it's partly that the TV isn't truly made to be used as a computer display & that the display I have it set to isn't the computer's native display (the other display options morph the picture). The only reason this TV didn't earn 5 stars is just about all because it isn't that great as a computer display.

P. Stern", "ReviewID": "R1UCLTMLKSEU57", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "My several year old Sharp 46\" TV recently died due to a delaminated diffuser.  As a replacement, I originally purchased an LG 47LN5700.  While at first blush an impressive set, after a couple of weeks I found enough to dislike that I returned it (I have a review of that TV on Amazon).  I bought the Vizio E470-A0 in the hopes that it's lack of whiz-bang features would work in its favor; it has.  Out of the box, the picture is great with little adjusting needed.  The contrast is good; details in white / light color areas aren't blown out.  The sound is quite good but I can't say it's really noticeably better than the LG's although it is better than my old dearly departed Sharp.  The surround function does work quite well, hover, with sound seemingly coming from beyond the TV.There is a little bit of unevenness in terms of the backlighting, but not the worst I've seen and better than I've seen on more expensive sets.  Fast motion doesn't create banding or artifacts, just motion blur (which I am fine with).  It's 60Hz, has no networking or smart capability. I just wanted a solid TV with a good picture and sound which is what I got.My complaints are few:- The remote has to be pointed right at the sensor on the TV.  This is an issue with the remote itself because once programmed, my Universal Remote RF-20 has no such issue.- Like every TV now, there's no S-video, and component and composite jacks are shared so if you need to connect more than one older device, you will need a switch box (I have an S-video and composite device; a converter switch box on Amazon is less than $20).- Also like other current TVs, the screen is somewhat glossy.  Not as reflective as a plasma screen but a lot more reflective than my old Sharp.  I can see my sofa and coffee table reflected in the screen when the image is dark, even without any lights on.  Not a deal breaker since every TV I looked at was the same.  My solution for this (I hope), is the MXH antiglare film from Photodon, who makes these films precut for various screen sizes.*** UPDATE ***After spending more time using this TV, I noticed a serious problem:  The audio would go out of sync with the video.  Video source is my cable box attached to the TV via HDMI.  After about 10 to 15 minutes, there will be a delay in the audio that will progressively get worse.  Switching the channel and back again will resolve the issue, but only for another 10 to 15 minutes.  While this TV does have a \"lip sync\" function that allows you to delay the audio, it does not allow any delay in the video thus there is no good way to resolve the issue.  If left on its own, the audio will eventually get a good 3 seconds or more behind the video.  This TV is being returned.The MXH antiglare film from Photodon, while difficult to apply, does work very well.", "Date": "June 18, 2013"}, {"Title": "I liked it then I didn't", "Author": "Cotton Socks \"Cotton Sox\"", "ReviewID": "R5XCYKM9233WW", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "Arrived here early December 2013.

I've no idea why they left this feature off. People may or may not continue to have cable or sat service and rely on over the air channels. It would be a drag to not easily see what's coming up in the near future.There are often times when OTA offers better programming than cable, especially overnight. I don't think many cable or satellite on-screen guides show the info for (or even receive) the local sub channels (such as say 8.2, 8.3. 8.4, they would only show info for 8.1)There is no headphone jack but that is easily and cheaply fixed by using an rca adapter from it's 2 rca audio outlets. The optical-out audio is switchable between: off, dolby, or PCM. The abilty to switch to PCM is apparently a plus when running the audio through older amplifiers which only have rca inputs.

I was tweaking the picture settings and it would look great for a few seconds, then go to an overcast grey look. To disable you need to go to Picture, More, Advanced Picture, then turn it off. You will need to do this for each Input, and each setting and each Picture Mode (Movie, Football, etc) as each one remembers it's own settings.Now that I've got this unit dialed in I'm loving it.

I used to recommend this brand but after seeing this TV I can no longer endorse Vizio.1) For Over the Air HD channels, the guide button does exactly the same thing as the info button -- it does not show the program lineup like my other TVs do.2) Most importantly to me, the color saturation is just dull and off-tint. Even turning the color saturation up to max (100), it is closer but still does not approach the amazing richness of my vf552xvt. In fact setting the E390-A1's saturation to 100%, I could only make them *almost* match -- by turning the 552's color saturation down to 40. And the skin color just was not true. I tried for 3 weeks to tell myself I could live with this, but decided to return to store.COMPARE this TV's richness of red and blue side by side to other BEFORE you buy it.I can only believe this reversal in quality was the result of management.

This 39\" uses the same mounting and finally gives me a picture usually at least as tall if not a little taller and that is often much taller than the old CRT used to give--this matters tremendously when you're trying to read something on screen.  It doesn't matter how wide the letters can be if they are not tall enough.Like all newer 16:9 aspect ratio TVs that have small, down-facing speakers, what it gains in sleekness and lightness it gives up in sound; but I knew that going in and got a 32\" sound bar and subwoofer to use with it.

After much frustration, I purchased new HDMI cables and all problems solved. The other cables still work fine with the other HDMI television.

You will need to tweak it to meet your particular preferences and viewing conditions, but the setup menu is extensive enough to satisfy most any user's preferences. This thin bezel also adds to the impressive appearance of the television when it is off, and makes the image seem even larger when viewing the television.There is one small negative, and that is the fact that the television has a lag time when you first turn it on. There are a few seconds of viewing the Vizio logo, while the television recognizes the source it is connected to and displays it in the upper right edge.

I used the 1080i, 720p, and 480i/p modes W/HDMI & Component inputs. The screen render is spectacular. However, we don't have a particularly bright living room when the sun is shining in, if you do this unit may not be bright enough for you - such as many large windows facing south in your viewing room. We found it just bright enough to be totally pleased with the display.The sound was lacking, did not have much low-end frequency, and not very loud either - I'm not usually satisfied with most stock TV speakers anyway. Mounting it against a solid wall might improve it, IDK. When we had loud fan(s) running (in the summer) we had to turn it up nearly all the way to hear the words. It also has a distortion (resonance) at a particular frequency when turned up >60%, and it only affects a few actor's voices, but they are noticeably distorted at that point - I didn't try filtering out the frequency with the included 5-band graphic equalizer that only works when you turn OFF \"SRS studioSound HD.\" Now if you live in a quiet environment, or if you watch the TV at low volumes that other people can't hear, that wouldn't be a problem to you. And my hearing is excellent - all frequencies - as my hearing test results prove.But if you need to overcome city noises, child noises, fan noises, air conditioning noise, etc. you will be disappointed with the sound as I was. I bought an auto-shutoff amplifier and hooked it up to our excellent home stereo speakers and now the sound is excellent, shakes the house. If you are using a home theater surround sound system, and if you are not using this unit just as a monitor (in which case sound doesn't matter) you are probably not considering this unit anyway. It is worth noting that the RCA stereo outputs go dead when you turn the E390i-A1 off, so an auto-shutoff amplifier works great with that - but the E390i-A1 volume control only affects the RCA stereo output levels when you have all the sound menu settings set just right, and some other settings make it too quiet to use in less than quiet rooms.It's too bad that the sound is lacking, because this has an excellent display. I have been watching NFL football on it and the clarity of detail on the field is phenomenal, and beautiful colors that seem to be right on target with the hue. Also the viewing angles are great, the colors don't wash out much until you reach a very tight angle (like approx. 30-40* from parallel to surface). The stand tilted the screen upward just slightly, like only about 1 degrees, there is no adjustment.One (other) caveat: I did have trouble at first with the display brightness dimming and brightening noticeably with no apparent reason, until I turned off \"smart dimming\" in the options. At first I thought my model did not have that option in the menu, until I noticed the \"more\" option in the onscreen menu under \"picture\" (it's in the manual too). As others have said on the reviews I had to turn this off, as the picture brightness was changing regardless of the steady room lighting state.

I love the picture quality but there are some things I would change about it.

It seems you have to really get rough with it to get it into place.  I was afraid of breaking the plastic to do this.  I also don't like the way the stand makes the TV slant backwards.  I think it needs some sort of adjusting capability.  Then, there is the issue of only being able to use a little more than half the screen if you are trying to watch a show that is not HD.  In other words, my 29\" TV is about a 20\" TV most of the time.

Like any $250 TV, it is the mid/low end of product line, but Vizio seems to have a good reputation on this market.  Before I purchased, I called technical support to see how the response time was and was speaking to a person in about 2 minutes. (I always do that to make sure the support is there if I have a problem)  Also visited some stores that carry Vizio and talked with Returns people to get an idea of how many Vizio returns they have.  In both stores I visited returns were very low.I replaced an older, smaller Samsung 720p with the 320-A1 and have been very happy so far.  The small footprint fit nicely in my armoire.  Took about 5 minutes put on the stand, plug in the cable coax, and get it turned on.  I have Cox cable and put this in the bedroom without a cable box.  After the channel scan, I got the lower basic cable channels as well as the HD locals.  There were several local channels I didn't want so I set them up to skip those channels in the Tuner setup.  Like any HDTV, the picture in standard broadcast is okay but the picture is 4:3 so it is smaller unless you select wide or panorama mode which will distort the picture some.  Select the HD channels and you will find the picture quality was very good.  I have a DVD player (not Blueray) and Roku connected to the two HDMI ports the picture quality was again very good.

Only two HDMI inputs and one combined composite/component input (this is a huge problem with just about all TV's now due to cost cutting),2. Contrast drop off and black level increases when viewing off axis, but no different than most other LCD displays except IPS panels,3. Side mounted controls on set hard to see and/or feel (yes I do actually walk up to something to turn it on or off without using the remote),4. Some dirty screen (clouding) effect. On white scenes (snow, hockey etc) there are some slightly darker 'patches' due to mild uneven backlighting though you have to look for it.Contrast ratio on all LCD's falls off from center. I've seen worse, but improvements over the past 5 years make it more livable. The 'pop' goes away off axis due to the black level increasing, washing out the video (depending on how far one goes off axis).

The picture is great, though I agree with other reviews that you should turn off the light sensor for best picture.The setup was very easy, though it does require a screw driver to put together the base.  The base does tilt the screen backwards just a few degrees, though it is not really noticeable from a viewing standpoint.  I am not sure, but this might actually help with glare or reflections.When you turn on the TV for the first time, there is a very easy initial setup - choose your language, input source (cable vs. antenna).  We do not have cable, but this TV has a built in digital tuner that has worked very well so far.  It automatically scans for stations, which is convenient, but I have not found a way to manually add stations.  The automatic scan does not pick up the local PBS broadcast, and I have not been able to add it.We have a PS3 that connected easily and works great.  I planned to use the second HDMI port to connect my laptop computer to watch movies or HBO Go (which does not have an app for the PS3... get on that Sony!), but for some reason my laptop does not recognize this TV when connected via HDMI.  From what I can tell, this is not an issue with Vizio, but rather with the Intel HD Graphics 3000 driver for Windows 8.1.  Apparently the driver will recognize some HDTVs, but not others.  Intel is aware of the problem but tells me they have no plans to fix it.  Go customer service!On that note - We received 30 days free tech support from Amazon.  I called that number and the tech was very polite but was unable to correct the issue.  I have a second laptop made by Dell with a HDMI port which connects without an issue, so I will use that computer to watch online videos.This TV does not have the built in wifi capabilities and apps, but since we have the PS3, that is not an issue for us.So far we are very happy with the purchase.

It's big no it's not a 1,500.00 dollar 55 inch 3D but it is huge, the thing was set up easily and put together easily with just six screws and Costco's concierge hot line helped and has still been helping me to understand it.  Once I figured out to turn off ambient light control I adjusted one of the picture settings as my own custom one which was a bright pic with good pink faces as opposed to the more yellow it was, now I'm happy.  There's also, movie, game, sports modes, etc.  But movie and custom is where I stay it's the brightest.  Xbox 360 is amazing, fills the whole screen Batman is huge.  Movies are cool on it.  I have a streaming converter box and get sound feedback so I'm gonna try a new 3.5mm cord at some point but it works, has sound out so my comp goe's vga to converter to hdmi and then tv stereo out into my stereo (boom box), xbox is just video wire into tv right now waiting for my other hdmi cable to arrive.  Only has two hdmi inputs instead of three, no ethernet in, but without quibbling am very pleased and give it five stars for price, customer service and warranty.  Costco concierge will walk you through it all if your a member or I'm sure if recieved as a gift.  It's a big tv going from a 19inch and only weighs like 36 lbs.Update two weeks later:  the picture on faces is kind of yellow and no customer support can help me to change that, the color controls including picture color are useless, and if ambient light sensor is on all the picture is too dark to watch so that always needs to be turned off constantly.  Overall I like it, black people look fine, asians look ok, but white people look yellow or too red not tan like on my comp streaming.  So if you can deal with that as an issue the hd off an xbox movie is amazing and it's still a good price.  The only two Hdmi ports is causing a problem for me though I've got three hdmi items and had to hook one up as red white and yellow to make it all works and the first splitter I bought for hdmi is defective so it might end up causing me more money for another splitter then I bought a roku for netflix where maybe buying the fourty inch with wifi and I think three hdmi ports might have been the better choice, but as the present I got it for I still love my new tv from my old 19inch.", "Date": "October 17, 2013"}, {"Title": "Just what I needed.", "Author": "CM", "ReviewID": "R1NMFBXWX7J1ZI", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Delivered in a timely manor.

In this review I will attempt to cover both my original TV, my replacement TV and Vizio service department.I ordered this unit after reading the reviews and was confident that I was going to be receiving a quality product.  Amazon shipped on time and using Prime I received the TV as delivered.  So far, so good.TV 1 StoryI boxed  the set, took down my old set and connected everything together.  As far as setting up the TV, not a big deal.  We have Dish Network, Roku and a DVD home theater using AVI.  After I got everything hooked up, did some testing, found the dish network worked fine, Roku (I only tested to the point of scanning the menu). The next day we decided to stream a movie on Prime.  As soon as the movie would start we would only see a purple screen.  Off to google we went to search why.  The answer was the HDMI hand shake was not working, possible cause, TV, cable or Roku.  We did some trouble shooting and found the HDMI port was not working.  When we swapped ports between the dish network and Roku, the Roku would work and dish would not.  Being the type of person I am, I would rather chat than call and wait in a queue.Support storyI was disconnected twice from chat sessions.  I found this frustrating because you enter your phone number, bot they did not bother calling back after the session got dropped. So off to the old phone line.  I was already not happy, and when prompted said I would more than willing to complete a survey...  We'll after holding for a while, I got a tech on the phone and started following their trouble shooting process.  Turning TV on and off, a power reset, I was then asked to hold and...went right into the survey because they disconnected me again...  Called back again... Got a new tech, and had to go through the process again.  I am understanding that they have a script and process, but by now I had spent a great deal of time on the web and phone so I was a little grumpy.  In the end, I was told to take a picture and email it to them to verify the issue.  Send the email, wait 24 hours and call back...  Ok, a little strange but ok.  Called back and was told yup, they verified an issue... DUH!!  Then I was told to send them via email a copy of the proof of purchase and again wait 24 hours and call back.  UGH, ok, so I did this too.  Called back and this time I was told, ok we will ship a new TV.  They did via ground from CA to CT so 5 days later, plus multiple days on the phone I received a new TV.TV #2Yeah!!  New TV!!  Removed defective TV installed new TV.  HDMI ports work.  tested dish and Roku, both work.  Tested DVD, works fine.  Sat down and finally was able to enjoy the TV.  I will admit the screen is great, colors are great, sound is great.  However a few hours later notice that the sound and the picture are not in sync.  I went to the set up and found the l sync adjustment.  However that would only make it worse.  Right now I am stuck with turning the TV off and back on and presto back in sync for another couple house and then BAM out of sync again...Bottom line... 2 TVs multiple calls into Vizio more then A week later and I am still not a happy Vizo customer...

Our last Vizio model, the VW32LHDTV20A, was hit by a power surge through a faulty surge protector the last full week of march, and since then it has become unusable.  It was a great TV for being nearly 8 years old and I was sad to see it go, had it not been for the power surge I would still be using it today.  That being said, I can't fault Vizio for a power surge and because of my satisfactory experience with the previous TV, I was willing to buy from them again.I did some research and chose a unit based on my needs.  I wanted a unit with the following inputs and outputs:-Minimum of 2 HDMI inputs-SPDIF out-Coaxial input-RGB input-At least one component input-At least one AV inputAfter doing some research on Amazon and other sites across the web, my options became very apparent.  I can pay tens or even hundreds of dollars more to get a reliable unit from a trusted brand that has everything I just listed, or, I can pay as much as 100 dollars LESS on a less reliable unit from a more obscure brand.  After weighing my options and considering the fact that I can live without the RGB input since my computer has an HDMI output, this TV was the only standout.  It was within my price range ($250-300) and had enough inputs and outputs that I could get by with no problem on my current setup and still have room to grow.  I did briefly consider the next step up (the E320i-AO) but since we use our recently custom built desktop PC as a media hub, we did not require a smart TV with apps and wifi connection.  If you use your desktop PC as a media hub for your HDTV like us, I would strongly advise that you save yourself 40 dollars or so and consider this model.  The LED LCD panel is the same and you won't really notice a difference in your viewing experience.  As far as the difference between 720 and 1080 resolutions, take it from me, don't waste your money on anything under 40 inches that is 1080.  You really can't see a difference.  I have a friend with a 1080p unit and I can't tell the difference.  I can't see the difference when they are side by side either.  I have noticed however that when a 1080p signal is transmitted to the TV through HDMI, it displays \"1080p\" in the upper right hand corner.  Whether or not it's actually displaying in 1080p, I do not know, because like I said I can't tell a difference.  I just know it says 720p on the product page.Now let's discuss my actual experience using this unit.  When compared with our previous traditional LCD TV (VW32LHDTV20A) the picture is a much better.  The colors seem to be deeper and richer, and the edges and corners of objects are very smooth with no pixilation.  Our previous unit had occasional pixilation, especially when handling darker colors and while watching local TV channels.Yes, it only has two HDMI inputs.  But considering that most new surround sound units now have 4 or more HDMI inputs, a true home theater junky will not see the need to have this many on your TV.  A friend of mine runs all of his HDMI cables into his surround sound receiver and only one HDMI cable from his surround sound to the TV.  The surround sound acts as the hub for all of his devices.  Many DVD and BluRay players also have additional inputs for other devices as well, so the need for many HDMI inputs on TVs anymore is becoming questionable.  So if you have a newer surround sound unit or other device that has HDMI inputs, you will not need many on your TV.Scanning for channels is about twice as fast as it was on our previous unit.  This TV also seems to have a more sensitive tuner card, as we picked up channels from sources about 120 miles away.  Our previous unit never received channels that this unit will.  While I did block some of the channels because their signal wasn't strong enough to render then watchable, this unit does have a far more powerful tuner card than previous generations of Vizio TVs.  My only true complaint is that there appears to be no way to see the upcoming schedule in the TV's guide, you can only see info for the current time slot.  I like to look ahead sometimes to see if there is anything I would like to watch, and having to skip over to the computer or pick up a TV Guide at the store is bothersome.  I am surprised this slipped the minds of the engineers at Vizio.  Maybe a firmware update will return this capability in the future.  Of course if there is a way to view a full guide with upcoming show information, please leave me a comment.I have read some complaints about sound quality on this unit.  I honestly do not see where the trouble is.  Compared to several previous generations of Vizio TVs, the audio quality is clearly superior.  Some of their previous generations had speakers that sounded more like cell phone speakers than a traditional TV speaker.  The sound had no depth.  Our previous unit had fairly large speakers, I can not tell you what the wattage was, but while they had depth, the clarity and surround sound on them was not as good as it is on this TV.  Granted the sound may not be as good on this TV as more costly 32 inch units from other brands, but at this price point they are more than satisfactory, and I see no reason to complain.  If you plan on using surround sound, then you have no reason to worry about this, as long as it works.I have read some complaints about the backlighting.  This isn't really a problem, you just have to make some adjustments to get it to a level you are satisfied with.  Go to Menu, Picture, More, Advanced Picture and adjust the Ambient Light Settings to \"Low\" or \"Off\".  Problem solved.  If you turn it off, adjust the backlighting to a satisfactory level in the Picture menu.As far as the physical aspects of this unit, the thin bezel sure is nice, particularly for a small living room like ours.  It helps the room feel bigger.  The thin design also helps the unit feel less intrusive than previous generations of Vizio TVs.  The real estate savings are enough to make a positive impact on our entertainment center.  The only downfall is that it makes it more difficult to hide the cables behind the unit.  An easy fix is to either direct all the cables directly behind the stand, or to bundle them up nice and neat wherever they fall so they don't look so sloppy.Speaking of the stand, this was the only part of the setup where I had trouble.  I read another review where someone else had trouble.  They couldn't get a screw to start, but a family member made a suggestion that worked for them to resolve the issue.  I had a hole that was milled too big for any of the screws that shipped with the unit.  Since it was where the two portions of the base connect, it wasn't really a big deal because the full weight of the TV is directed downward onto it.  I used a longer and coarser screw I had on hand instead of the provided screws to fix this problem.  However it did provide me with 10 minutes of frustration or so.  Also, go easy when attaching the stand to the TV itself, I heard a \"pop\" noise when turning one of the screws in, and now it won't back out.  I assume they had a nut that was either spot welded in or molded into the plastic internally, and the weld or mold failed.  This really isn't a problem for me since I do not intend on ever mounting this TV, thus ever having to remove the stand, so at least that screw is secure.  However Vizio really needs to get with the supplier that molds their plastic components and make sure they are producing quality products.  Since I'm not the first one to have a problem with the stand, a trend is becoming obvious.  This isn't enough to remove a star for me since everything functions as intended, but it is a problem that can be remedied easily, and I am certain and could be worthy of a lower rating for someone who needs to wall mount this unit and finds they can't remove their base.So all in all, I am satisfied with this unit.  It works as intended for the price point and also has a stellar picture.

The only solution was to turn the TV off and on again to restore the sound.  I contacted Vizio and their explanation was: \" What happens is the digital audio out on the device connected to the TV is set to Dolby Digital. This overloads the chip on the TV which causes anomalies such as this.\"  They suggested \"...trying first is set the audio out on the connected device to PCM or LPCM.\"  This turned out not to be easy for this challenged electronics user.  I contacted Comcast, my cable provider, and they were very little help.  Finally, I found the users manual for my Motorola DCX3200M set top box (it turned out to be the manual for model RNG 150N).

The two rails screw into the back of the TV and then hang on a rail bolted into the wall.  One of the rails came down over the power plug in the back of the TV.  You can see on a back view of the TV how the two mounting screw holes are directly over the power plug.  Because of a modification I had made to the rail on the prior TV I was able to get it to work (I cut off the bottom of the rail to shorten it).  This issue would have been solved by moving the power plug elsewhere on the unit or having a right angle plug.  Also, the cable connection comes straight out the back.  Again, this wasn't too much of a problem as I had enough space between the back of the unit and the wall but a tighter fit to the wall would have posed a problem for the cable connection.  Finally, while I don't have an HDMI plug, the location of the plug would probably cause problems with a rail mount as well.As to the TV itself, the picture is good considering the price of the TV.

Essentially I got this around president's day and the price was at least $45 lower so it was really a no brainer of a purchase.I am really happy with the picture...both standard and HD stations are really good and the colors are accurate.  Far more accurate than a 22\" samsung that this unit replaces.But the samsung kept the relative screen sizing for the analog and digital channels.  What does this mean.  Well, these days, most stations have adjusted their analog stations to have a bar at the top so you can zoom and get a full picture without loosing much real estate.  And you can zoom with this set, but it stays on zoom when you then change to a digital station.  The samsung did not do that.  It is annoying to have to change it.  But I can live with it.I have no clue about the sound because I never tried it.  Hooked up a pair of Bose silver desktop speakers and had to turn the base down (it was nice that it had this option) on the equalizer settings.  So I have nice full sound with the bose.  Tough to get good sound with flat panels, especially small ones.No favorites on the remote.  Really?  Again, not the end of the world but really?  I watch like 3 stations on this kitchen tv and having favorites is very helpful.Lastly, the smell was overpowering.  It was really stunning how strong of a plastic smell there was.  I ended up lightly spritzing the plastic with Fabreeze where able without getting into the electronics or on the panel and rubbing it in.  Worked pretty well to reduce it dramatically.  Still, there was a hint of plastic smell even a week later.But, for what I paid...it deserves at least 4 stars.  The colors on the Samsung were pathetic.", "Date": "February 28, 2014"}, {"Title": "PERFECT", "Author": "Kelly M.", "ReviewID": "R12JYOR24IFQ2A", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This TV came packaged excellent!

The front TV cabinet in my motorhome cannot be easily expended without major cabinetry re-work, and this 29\" model fits with just 0.5\" to spare.  The stores only carry 26\" and 32\", probably because the 29\" costs the same as 32\", but I was happy to find this 29\" on Amazon.This is a size upgrade from the previous Sony 26\" LCD. It's lighter (only 13 lbs) and has a thinner frame than the 2008 vintage Sony.  One of the signal sources for the tv is the old fashion non-HD composite video and I think the Sony did a better job of that, but the Vizio is adequate. In HD (720P) the picture quality in the Vizio is every bit as good as the more expensive Sony.  Plus, the LED display looks brighter than the older Sony's vanilla LCD display (this is generally true of LED vs LCD).This tv is wall-mounted using the standard VESA mounts on the back. I was somewhat disappointed in the mount because the back case of the tv is not very rigid. It allows a lot of flex and the tv can wiggle quite a bit both vertically and horizontally, even though firmly bolted to the wall bracket.  It  wouldn't make any difference on a house wall, but in a motorhome, subject to road vibration and bouncing, I don't think it would last at all. I made a slim metal bracket for underneath to support it over road bumps and wedged dense foam behind it to dampen vibration. Seemed solid enough once I did those two things.One other comment re the sound system: If anything is plugged into the external audio output jack on the rear of the tv, the Vizio disables its internal speakers. You have no control over this except to physically plug & unplug the external audio jack, difficult to do with any wall mounted tv. The previous Sony had a menu option to enable or disable the speakers and/or external audio. If you need selectable audio output, this is not the tv for you. I doubt if many people would care about this, but I wanted to point it out in case you do.", "Date": "December 31, 2013"}, {"Title": "Pefect TV for Kids", "Author": "martjose", "ReviewID": "R227Q6B08731U", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I bought this TV for my daughters room.

As you can guess, rather than have cable or satellite we use an attic-mounted antenna that I bought at RadioShack in 1987. We watch more DVDs than TV broadcasts.In order to simplify our viewing we decided to go with a flat-panel TV that would fit our existing TV cabinet. 37 inches was the max that would fit the cabinet, and research on Amazon revealed that Vizio's E370 filled the bill.

I like the idea that I can tweek the sound and picture and have so many choices. I do think the sound is great but I am going to get a sound bar for a better boost to the action movies I watch alot.

My other LCD is an LG and I was looking at LG's but they were twice as much as this one. With Amazon's super saver shipping it was even more of a bargain for me (and no sales tax). It only took three days to arrive via UPS ground. The picture is good quality for a 720p. It was very easy to set up, though the initial scan for cable channels took a little longer than I was expecting, I thought it was not picking up any channels at first. The picture took some tweaking to get to my preferences. I did not like any of the presets so I went with my own custom. The sound is adequate, and I have stereo through my cable box into my stereo system. I have no trouble watching TV on this set with just the internal speakers on.

Digital optical wireless headphones are really expensive, so a pair of sennheiser rs 120's with this Vizio 32 inch tv has made all the difference and makes a good combination.As for the TV itself. Easy to setup and easy to configure with the end result being a 32 inch tv with a really nice picture and due to the bezel size, it's pretty much the same size as the older lcd tv I replaced it with. I use a zvox audio system for sound with it, so I can't give my two cents worth on audio quality, but so far $250 for a 32 inch led tv, I'm pretty impressed.

I purchased this for a second TV down in my basement where we just set up a play area for my daughter.  I was pleasantly surprised all the way around.  So surprised by Vizio in fact, that it gave me the confidence to look at them for a replacement to my 50\" Samsung Plasma with the New 55\" M-Series LED TV (you can see my full review for that TV as well).First and foremost, this isn't a primary TV for us and it's certainly not going to compare to high end TV's.  However, it is a tremendous TV for the value.  I thought I would have to go with a 32\" given my space, but the razor thin edge allowed me to go up to a 37\" in the same space.  The look of the TV is great and the small bezel is wonderful. I can't speak to the stand, as I mounted this on a small  entertainment center that had a mount (a necessity so my daughter wouldn't pull it over), but it looked fairly sturdy and it doesn't seem to distract from the sleek design in the photos.  Very light weight and I mounted it by myself.The picture quality surprised me, probably because I have been viewing Plasma for so long.  LED really is a great improvement over LCD and it certainly shows with this TV.  I changed the picture presets but you don't have near the level of tweaking available as you do with higher end TVs.  That said, the preset options were fine and the colors were impressive.  It's only a 60 hz TV, so don't expect  the smoothest of images with live action sports or action scenes, but I watch a lot of Cardinals baseball in the evenings when my daughter is playing downstairs and the image quality is impressive and has been growing on my each day I've had the TV. It's only 37\" TV and we don't sit ridiculously close to the set, so there is really no reason to invest in 1080p.  My primary source is 720p cable and even when I do put a PS3 or Blu-ray player down there, my eyes won't really be able to see the difference at my distance and with a set this small. I was very impressed with the look of the 720p and probably won't ever care that it isn't 1080p.The biggest surprise was the sound. I was looking at sound bars when I ordered the TV thinking for sure I would be appalled at the sound (I have a nice Klipsch/Yamaha home theater set up with my primary TV).  However, I was pleasantly surprised and might skip the sound bar altogether.  With the surround sound option on, it was pretty good.  I won't be showing off the sound of it to my friends or anything, but it was actually very good for a TV :-)I don't use the remote as I have it programed to adjust the volume with my Uverse remote (as its my only source hooked up for now), but it seemed just fine to me when I first used it.  Also worth noting is that the TV qualifies for Amazon's low price guarantee & free super saving shipping.  I purchased this for $30 under the list price and then it was an addition $20 below that a week after I ordered it.  I went on the web and submitted the claim to Amazon and they refunded the difference.A good overall LED Tv and a good purchasing experience from Amazon.", "Date": "June 24, 2013"}, {"Title": "Plug-N-Play", "Author": "Ayris \"Ayris\"", "ReviewID": "R3VN0PC24HS9L3", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "This TV is super simple to set up, has great picture quality, and the audio sounds wonderful, even in my 10x10 living room. The backlight is also perfect for us. We keep the apartment very dark. Too much backlight would have killed my eyes, I am very photosensitive. Somehow it manages to be wonderful with all the lights on and wonderful with all the lights off, definitely a good indoor TV.The menus and generally using the TV is pretty intuitive.The remote is small and straight forward. I like this, but not everyone will.Set up was as easy as having a philips on hand and about 5 minutes. The instructions aren't super clear on how and where to screw, but logic worked out fine in the end.My husband had a brain fail and didn't figure this out at first, but AV(3 connectors, red/yellow/white) needs to be on AV input setting rather than composite(5 connectors) or it will be black and white. He googled it and saw the question occured often, so I thought I should share. The composite/AV inputs are color labeled. Since the TV doesn't pivot, you might not want to put much things next to your TV if you have to change them out often and don't want to use a switcher.I wish the 2 HDMI ports were labeled better than 1 & 2. I can never remember which one is what. Arrow to where the cord connects to the TV would have been nice.My only issue was with the TruVolume. When playing a movie when it transferred from a loud fighting scene to a heart to heart, the TruVolume took too long to ramp up. I missed half the talking. However, when I turned off TruVolume I discovered that my portable movie device's volume was almost silent. It ramped it all the way up to a listening volume with no distortion from nearly inaudible. That was impressive.The equalizing also makes the background music a little too loud when there is talking, mostly for epic scenes. All my issues can be adjusted though. I love technology.We use this TV mostly for gaming. Everything we've connected there's been no issue with, including older consoles. It also works great with my PC.I think all around it's a good price for a good TV. It doesn't have all the fancy features that new smart TV's have, but I don't have internet either way and didn't want to bother with all of that.

This used to be an issue with commercials but with the passage & implementation of the CALM Act (Law passed by Congress that makes it illegal for commercials to be broadcast at louder volume) that's less of an issue.

IMO CRT still has the best quality and Plasma second, unfortunately can't do CRT in HD so that's irrelevant.For me supported res I have tested/used and confirmed are:480i/480p576i/576p720i/720p1080i/1080pI always recommend using a custom color adjustment DVD as none of the factory settings get it quite right.", "Date": "May 20, 2013"}, {"Title": "Perfect For The Price!", "Author": "cj", "ReviewID": "R301D201LL9LEK", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This TV was purchased for my grandmother so that she would be able to better see the screen.

Mikkelson", "ReviewID": "R3DDUXSMZAMD3F", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "Others have commented on the odd, undersized and unstable stand included.  I cut a piece of 1/4\" plywood about 12\" X 19\" as a base and fastened the rear plastic stand to the back long side of the plywood with a tie wrap to solve that problem.  My 2nd grip is with the brightness of the screen - which is about 80% that of my old LCD set.  The workaround is to dim the room lights in the evening I suppose.The non-working guide function is my biggest complaint. On my old LCD set, pushing the 'guide' button on the remote produced a TV guide - a list of the current channel's schedule with time slot, title and short description.  The included remote has a 'guide' button, but it does the same function as the 'info' button (displays information on the current show being broadcast).  The fact that the remote has a separate button for bringing up the channel guide means the engineers at Vizio are aware of the function and purpose.  The data for the guide function is within the ATSC signal, same as the 'info' data is, so there's no excuse for not having this function implemented that I can understand.", "Date": "December 24, 2012"}, {"Title": "Bad Picture", "Author": "jesus", "ReviewID": "R38HAHEUZ5DL4O", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "everything was good except for the color.

The best feature of this product is its slim and sleek design. LED TVs do have the characteristic of the picture being a different hue/brightness dependent on the viewing angle. Since I wanted this set to placed on a chest of drawers and viewed while lying in bed, it became clear that i could NOT adjust the picture quality sufficiently so that the brightness/contrast was adequate! And so, I get continually complaints regarding the \"dark picture with odd color\" from mother! And I don't blame her! She is correct! Additionally, the bass and treble are entirely unadjustable! The sound mirrors what one would expect from the soup cans in a Progresso commercial! LOUSY LOUSY LOUSY sound! And you cannot change it in the least. It seems that this is another Chinese imitator product. While the display is nice, it relies on the software to run the electronics, and this set is woefully inadequate.

If you can use a phillips screwdriver to tighten six screws,you are set. The picture is great and the sound is very good. The on-screen guides are easy to follow.  I hooked it up to a standard Directv receiver (which does not have hdmi so the cable I ordered with the tv was useless)  I looked up the code to program the Directv remote and I was off and running.  This is my first flat screen tv and I really like how light it is and I like the styling of the small bezel. I am not paying the extra money for HD but it still looks and sounds great. However the reason for three stars is I think a new tv should have functioning connections!  The coax jack does not work and so I can not hook the tv to a vcr, dvd and directv receiver, which was my old system. My only choice is to use one set of component cables to connect the directv receiver.  I purchased component cables which are supposed to be better than composite but there is not difference. The only way to use the dvd is to disconnect those cables from the satellite receiver and connect to the dvd player.I tried several coax cables and two vcrs and the sat dish receiver.  I am sure the coax on the new tv is non-functional. It only delivers a heavily snowed static.  So now I must upgrade to HD receiver and pay an extra $100.00 plus $10.00 extra a month in order to use the Hdmi connection (hopefully it works).  Or buy a hdmi dvd/vcr player or a composite to hdmi converter.  Or I could return the tv.  It's a good tv except for this one issue.I thought I'd write a review though in case someone else might benefit. One of the reasons I bought this tv was it appeared to have all the connections I'd need to hook up my existing system.

I had a SHARP AQUOS tv and it is still going strong, but being a 7 year old model was not up to date with the latest technology.  I did my research and VIZIO came up as a pretty good TV.  But this model leaves a lot to be desired.UPFRONT:  Buy SAMSUNG, PANASONIC or SHARP (SHARP \"AQUOS\" model only), they come up consistently as the best TV's on multiple sites, by editors choice AND buyers, like you and me.ISSUES:1.  First, I bought it as I thought the picture would envelope the entire screen as it did with my 40\" AQUOS in the living room and the 22\" in the bedroom.  IT DOES NOT.  Under \"Normal\" view, it is an almost square picture with a ton of extra black space on each side, so it ends up the same size as my 22\" SHARP.  This is a bummer, especially since I bought a larger TV for a larger picture AND this TV has a very small frame, hence = even bigger picture.  I actually PAID for this extra real estate and it is not being used.If you change the picture mode to \"Close Up\", that is what you get, but since it is a close up you lose part of the picture frame, it cuts it smaller than it really is so it is a little annoying and you lose some quality.If you change it to \"Wide Screen\" or \"Panoramic\" view, which to me seem to be the same so not sure why 2 options for the same result, at the ends of the picture horizontally, the last 3\" to 5\" on each side seems like you are looking at it through a bottle, it waves and distorts like it is being pulled out of shape.  So, that does not work either.  It also widens the picture horizontally only and you have again quite a few inches of black space on the top and bottom of the screen.2.  The sound said it was a premium sound system, and yes it does have quite a few speakers, but for me not enough bass at all, even when toying with the equalizer.  BUT, for my Mom who has hearing loss in one ear and deaf in the other this actually worked out well, as she does not blast the TV in order to hear it now and can keep it on a moderate level.  IF it was for me I would have to buy speakers to get the sound I want.  So, Sound is tinny.  Others have complained about this issue and that it cuts in and out.  I do not have the latter issue, but if I do I will update this review.3.  The remote control is small and hard to read, even for me and it is not backlit.  Shame on them for skimping here of all places.4.  The stand for the TV is static, so you cannot tilt the TV for the best angle for viewing, just place it an angle of choice from left to right.5.  The picture quality is not as good as I expected.  I thought I would see a remarkable difference at 720DP. but just do not.  SIDE NOTE:  Unless you play games or will view A LOT of movies at 1080DP, ALWAYS get the 720DP!!  This is because cable and satellite TV only have the ability to transmit a signal at 720DP so you are paying A LOT of extra money for nothing.  Also, it will be this way for a while, so by the time they have the ability to transmit in 1080DP, it will probably be time for a new TV.6.  When looking at the menu, it ALSO is hard to see and dark, even for me and there is no way to brighten the control menus, or any menu items, this also is a bummer.7.  This TV refreshes but at 60HZ.  In order to get a good picture when watching sports or action movies, you need a refresh rate of at least 120HZ, prefer 240HZ, otherwise you get a lot of blur.  So, you get a lot of blur with this picture for sports or any type of action in movies.PROS:1.  It is very light, so light that I can actually pick up the TV with one hand easily.2.  Easy to set up.3.  It does have a better picture quality than my old TV, but that is because it was old.  It is also better in a brightly lit room.______________If I had to do it over again, I probably would have spent a few extra bucks and bought a SAMSUNG, that comes in at the #1 and #2 slot consistently on multiple reviews, PANASONIC which also comes up great in reviews, SHARP \"AQUOS\" because that 2 that I have are beasts and LG also reviews well, but all were more expensive.Because returns are a real ordeal when it comes to electronics I am going to let this one slide unless the sound starts to go out.  It is ok for a smaller TV in the bedroom or kitchen, and my Mom can hear it really well.When I buy a larger set for the Living Room, I WILL NOT buy this brand again, and pay the extra money for a SAMSUNG, PANASONIC or SHARP \"AQUOS\" ( the most expensive).  I will also buy it as WiFi ready but will not waste the extra money on a \"smart\" TV because I do not use social networking sites.Word of advice...  Buy what you need, not what marketing is telling you what you need.  99% of the people out there will use WiFi ready sets for the internet, etc,,, but really not use the \"smart\" options on a \"smart\" TV.  And REMEMBER, 720DP, even in HD is all that you will be able to upgrade to from your Cable or Satellite feed, so keep that in mind.

Also, compared to my older Vizio, this one had on-screen guides which were much easier to use than the older ones, as well as decent sound quality.  And although it has a matte screen, which diminishes to some extent its picture clarity and gloss, it's a decent entry in the Vizio E series. (I would recommend skipping the earlier picture-tweaking options and choose instead the overall, preset \"Vivid\" option.) As for the new LED lighting, I wasn't able to see any difference between this and my old Vizio, which didn't have it.I object strongly, though, to the absence of any manual in the TV box other than the very brief \"Quick Start\" pamphlet.

Not many companies make them. In fact, they are, for the most part, more expensive that  a similar-quality 32\" set. We bought this 29\" model for a guest bedroom, based on price and reviews. The 32\" was too big and 24\" too small for this room. The Vizio has a great picture. However, it's difficult to tell a great difference in picture quality between the most expensive and  bargain-priced sets. The sound is ok. Small TVs have small speakers and one can't expect home theatre audio. My only gripe, shared by others, is that this TV does not have the traditional, bottom-mounted, pedestal stand. Instead, it has a rear-mounted brace. This system has two flaws: It takes up room behind the TV and it leaves the TV's screen with a slight upward tilt.

I bought this from Walmart for $238 and put it in my bedroom. I had it for a couple of weeks and then the headphone jack stopped working.

In my opinion it takes up about the same amount of space as the regular stands but made the TV sit at a weird angle.I'm also not a fan of the \"razor thin\" frame, at least in this particular size. 29\" is already kind of small (in my opinion) and I like my TV to look big, hehe.I've got a blu-ray player but then I also have a vhs/dvd player combo (I don't plan on getting rid of all of my tapes anytime soon, go ahead and call me old-fashioned). After trial and error (including a few trips to Radioshack) I realized there was no way to play my tapes on this tv without buying a $40 converter box. I needed to hook up a composite cable (white, red, yellow) and this TV does not have those inputs.After all that mess, I returned this to Walmart and got a 32\" Sceptre instead.

However, for those of us who favor a crystal clear picture, DO NOT BUY!  Although, someone who likes a crystal clear picture with a bigger budget would not have purchased this 720p TV in the first place, I guess.  However, this was in my price range.  I know a lot of people said they had problems with the stand and at first I did too.  At first I inserted the neck into the TV, which requires 3 screws.  I screwed in the first 2 tightly and kept trying to work with the third and it did not want to go in.  Then I took the screw out and look inside the hole.  Turns out the hole in the neck and the hole in the TV were not lined up.  However, I happened to be on the phone with a relative who suggested loosening, but not taking out the other two screws, then inserting and screwing in the third one.  Worked like a charm.  I tightened all three screws and screwing in the neck to the base took no time at all after that.I went through all the setup stuff only to find an awful grainy picture.  There are times when the picture is too dark, too bright, or the colors are muted or washed out.  I played with all of the color settings for about 45 minutes.  I finally got the color decent but there is still a lot of picture \"noise.\"  I had a 19\" and was so excited to finally have a bigger picture.  I am considering returning this and going back to my little screen. Another thing is that I hate how a lot of manufacturers put the input for the cables in the most awkward places.  It was very difficult to screw mine into the television. Also, others have said they had problems with sound, but the sound on my TV is set to Surround and I think it works pretty great.  Again, if you aren't the least bit tech savvy and going from an old fatback TV, and you're on a budget then maybe this is for you.

We responded that vizio had not resolved the issue even after we had contacted vizio again.
