{"Reviews": [{"Title": "The Mitsubishi WD-65734 is outstanding!", "Author": "james", "ReviewID": "R2O0V0RON79CQW", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Having seen this television at a local retail store, displayed among many others in the same price and size range, I was immediately sold on it.  It, by far, had a better picture and viewing angle than the other five models around it, plus it handled motion better than its competition (including Samsung's LED DLP).  I decided to look it up on Amazon, and I'm glad I did.  The price was significantly lower online than it was in the store.The delivery went smoothly (Eagle shipped it), it was easy to set up (by the way, I recommend the LACK tv unit ($69.99) from IKEA.  It is sturdy, it doesn't bow from the weight of the tv, and the television fits perfectly on it), and within minutes, I was enjoying the beautiful picture.I have no complaints so far.  The controls are intuitive, the color control is great, and the PS3 and X-Box 360 look excellent on it.  Blu-ray discs look especially good.I've waited years to get an HDTV, and I am very happy with my choice.  Also, this model includes HDMI 1.3, which should keep it relevant for a while.I highly recommend this set.  It's the best in its class, and not very expensive either.", "Date": "September 2, 2007"}, {"Title": "Phenomenal TV!  Great first experience w/ HDTV", "Author": "B. Benedict \"BB\"", "ReviewID": "R2V437DT580H04", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Wow!  What can I say!  First, I'm normally an early adopter for new technology!  However, I've had a hard time making the decision to move to HDTV.  Partially because it's hard to find enough info online to really understand HD, how to set it up, etc.  Partially because I've had a great Hitachi Ultravision 61\" Projection tv (not HD) for the past 7 years.  I had a hard time convincing myself that HD would be that much different to warrant spending money and learning how to get HD.  Well, I waited far too long!!The Mitsu 65\" 734 series (Medallion series) is a phenomenal tv!  Everything about it is truly amazing.  First, let's start with appearance.  The 734 series doesn't have the ultra shiny appearance of the 833 series (Diamond Series).  But, the appearance is stunning!  It's incredibly sharp looking.  Everyone who's seen it has just stopped in their tracks.  And, that was while the tv was off!!Next, setup.  The setup on this tv is ridiculously easy.  When you plug a device in, it detects it, tells you where it detected a device (HDMI 1, 2, or 3, Component 1 or 2, Ant 1 or Ant 2, etc).  You just pick the type of device, and you're pretty much done.  Changing input is great.  You press the input button, and it shows all the inputs that are plugged in right on the screen.  You just pick the one you want.  No filtering through 7 inputs to find the right one.My setup.  First, antenna.  Our house has a very large antenna in our attic (it's literally five feet tall).  It's not an HD antenna, but I started with that input.  Well, I live 40 miles from downtown Chicago.  After scanning channels, this tv picked (with the antenna's assistance) all of the free digital channels, aside from CBS (low channel number).  Next, cable.  I've got basic cable.  I connected to cable to a separate input, scanned channels, and it picked up all the unscrambled digital channels we have, with no cable box.  Very nice!  Third, I also have a standard tivo connected to this tv.  I will be connecting an HD tivo in the next week.  I also have a dvd player connected via component input.Picture quality.  Broadcast HD.  The HD picture quality is amazing!!!  There's no other way to say it.  There is absolutely no ghosting.  I've watched some heavy action scenes on HD broadcast tv and you just sit back and shake your head at the picture quality.  It's stunning!  DVD.  We watched MI 3 on dvd.  The picture was unbelievable.  The tv does an incredible job at upconverting the signal.  I'm upgrading to a dvd player with HDMI connection.  But even over component input, the picture was fantastic.  Tivo.  Well, it's a standard tivo.  But the picture is really surprisingly good.  You can see that it's not HD, but the upconverting here is most impressive of all.  Nonetheless, a new HD Tivo will be a happy addition.Negatives.  A couple. I think their impact will depend on the individual person, and the room the tv is going in.  First, noise.  The tv is DLP.  Guess what.  There's a LOT of heat with a DLP tv with a screen this size.  So guess what.  It can be a little noisy.  We have our tv in a 25 x 20 room.  We're sitting 14 feet away from the tv.  If you mute the tv, you can hear the fan.  If you turn the volume up a few notches, the noise blends out or can't be heard, depending on your listening volume.  The further you are from the tv, the less noise you'll hear, since the fan is in back.  But, we listen to our tv relatively quietly, and after one week, the noise doesn't bother my wife or I.  Second item, heat.  Make sure you have enough clearance for a tv this size.  We have our tv a full 18 inches off the wall (it's a big room).  That really allows the fan to get airflow for the bulb.  How long the bulb will last, we will see.  But unless you plan on sitting behind the tv, I don't think the heat is a problem.  Just plan on at least 12 inches of clearance behind your tv.  Third item, tuner speed.  The tuner is digital and well, it's a little slow.  There's an on screen guide that provides some programming info for some of the digital channels.  You can use the guide to directly navigate to a channel, or you can type the channel number.  If you're used to tivo though, the channel changing is a little slower.  If you change channels constantly, it's probably worth a small investment to get an HD Tivo.Would I buy it again?  In a heartbeat. Hope this helps.", "Date": "December 13, 2007"}, {"Title": "Bought from 6ave electronics, great in everyway!", "Author": "Emily I.

That means I have not fully explored all the intricacies, but I have used it under everyday circumstances.The HD picture is extremely clear. Sports in 1080i and 720p look stunning. Switch over to my Blu-Ray and it's like I'm looking out my window. So far there is not an artifact to be seen in 1080p, even with fast moving objects and camera pans. I should mention that the HD inputs are being fed by HDMI connections.SD DVDs look pretty good as well, but that may just be the PS3's interpolation. Nonetheless it's acceptable. SD television feed still leaves a lot to be desired, its not very crisp at all. (Maybe I've become an HD snob)The user interface is very intuitive and ergonomic. Simple on-screen menus make setting up and navigating through inputs and menus very easy. This TV also includes 2 IR emitters to control other devices (SAT, DVR, DVD and A/V Receiver). No one wants more remotes to lose. On-screen menus make this set up extremely easy with very little chance for error.All in all, this TV has a lot of bang for the buck.

We finally got one, and it's the Mitsubishi WD65734, a DLP, thin-frame, 65-inch, 1080p TV.  We looked at TV pictures over and over and over again in stores, read user reviews, and this one looked great but some people complained of the projection bulb burning out frequently (they are supposed to last about 5,000-hours) and a noisy fan.  We've only had ours a short time so can't comment on bulb life yet, but most user ratings did not report a problem and hey, that's what the service contract is for.  The fan is not noisy, one can hear it with the set off during cool-down but otherwise not an issue.  The picture is lush, detailed, crisp, and bright.  No DLP \"rainbow\".  Off-angle viewing, while not as good as a plasma, is good side-to-side, and more limited but still good up-and-down.  The user manual is amazingly clear and easy to use.  We view broadcast TV using an attic antenna, analog stations are grainy but digital ones are great.  We also have a Blu-Ray DVD player and Blu-Ray disks let this TV show its stuff, actually better than a real movie theater.The built-in speakers are survivable if you must but I would recommend an add-on sound system, at the very least a stereo (2-speaker) system but more typically a 5.1 surround-sound home theater system.  Note that many such sound systems advertise tons of watts but lousy, audible distortion (on the order of 10% THD = Total Harmonic Distorion), while others, such as the Onkyo unit we got, have more normal and inaudible 0.1% THD and are true sound systems.We shopped all over, found some slightly better prices from places that we would prefer to not buy from, wound up buying the TV via Amazon itself, got a very good price, free shipping, and the folks who delivered it did a great job of bringing it in and doing basic set-up.We are VERY pleased.  There's a newer model available, variously reported as the ...735 or ...736, but I have no idea what additional improvements or features it might offer.  We're happy with the ...734 series, which enjoys a noticeably better picture (sharper, deeper blacks and colors, etc.) compared to the ...733 series.Note that we purchased directly from Amazon, it may be sourced via other parties (Amazon partners) now, but the TV is super and the delivery service, EGL (= Eagle??  Local truck but paperwork has Houston, TX HQ) did a great job of carefully delivering it and setting it up.", "Date": "April 21, 2008"}, {"Title": "A lotta TV for a small (relatively) price", "Author": "D.

Brilliant colors, excellent picture, light weight, and thin.  If it weren't for the large dimensions, I could have carried it myself.  I don't use the IR NetCommand because the remote was already compatible with my devices (Motorolla cable box, Onkyo AVR).  I did have some issues with the coaxial audio output from the TV to my AVR.  I used an HDMI connection to hook up my PS3 to the TV and, with different games, the audio output from the TV to the AVR doesn't work.

As far as the picture gos it is amazing , Great colors and picture  !  I am overall very pleased with the tv easy setup and user friendly ! Some people have mentioned a whine from the tv some say its not there or they dont hear it , well it is there but like others have said it depends on how hot the bulb is , And it also depends on if you actually listen to the sound from the tv or a/v receiver. If you have the tv alone volume above say 12 (comfortable listening not even half way up) you CAN NOT  hear it at all ,since changing tv stands recently i now can not hear the fan . I have also read some reviews saying the sound is horrible , you have to remember this is a tv and not a surround sound receiver so for a tv I find the sound to be just fine ! i really dont know what they are expecting the sound to be . As far as the bulbs go this is a dlp so it may or may not pop.My brother bought a 62 toshiba several years ago his bulb lasted about 3 months till it popped, since replacing the bulb he has no problems with his.Why buy the extended warranty ? mitsubishi will replacethe bulb once in the first year and you can pick up replacements for around $170 and the prices keep dropping.Overall this tv is OUTSTANDING great picture decent sound and if you look very well priced (even consumer reports says so )! i found mine for $1499 shipping included with no tax, circuit city wanted $1800 for a wd657 which is a slightly lower model according to mitsubishi's customer service!

This is THE BEST TV you could EVER want!!  The color's are the most lifelike, the blacks are the most vivid and real. What is MOST attractive to me is the fact that it DOES NOT have just 1 input that is 1080p. It upconverts ALL the inputs to 1080p! Which means that you would not have to buy another DVD player that upconverts to 1080i, or 1080p, just use your existing DVD player. Everything about this tv shouts \"BUY ME, YOU WON'T REGRET IT\"!! It has all the inputs that you could want, or need. I am using three of the four HDMI inputs now, and still have one left for the future. I actually gave up on finding a  HDTV that was THIS BIG, with 4 HDMI inputs, picture quality to DIE for & was THIS AFFORDABLE at the same time. I figured I would have to give up at least 1 of the things I wanted, to get the rest. BOY, was I WRONG!! I always knew that Mitsubishi was THE BEST HDTV on the market! My first HDTV was a Mitsubishi also. I bought it in 2003, and am now selling it to a friend of mine who is buying his first HDTV. I have never had a problem with my old tv, & it still looks good. By the way, I gave up on the war between HD DVD & Blu-Ray. I figured why wait to see which format would win. So, I bought BOTH of them, & now enjoy the advantages that they each have. I know that people are currently buying TV's that mount on the wall. The truth of it is that while seeing it in your mind, you have a tendency to FORGET that there will be wires that you will have to hide SOMEHOW! Also, they don't care as much about picture quality as they should, so they buy 720p's. Most will be buying a new one in a short while, when they see their friends with 1080p's. They will also want to buy a BIGGER size screen. PEOPLE, I know that this TV can NOT be mounted on the wall. BUT. it will NOT take up your whole room either.

I was so disappointed I kept it for a week trying to tell myself it wasn't that bad.  It was.  It didn't get better and I didn't get used to it.  I bought this unit on recommendations from a couple friends that have NO issue with the noise.  After going back to the store and listening to the floor model, I was convinced it wasn't just mine that was a problem.  Clearly, with all the good reviews here, many people don't have a problem with it.  But there were times I was watching this TV and just wanted to turn it off!  Ironic when I think I watch too much TV but not the point of spending nearly $2000.It IS a great picture for the $$$, it has an IR emitter cable for your other components and that is nice but that is about it for the good points.To add to the buzzing noise problem, the unit has VERY bad built in speakers.  Ok, I know most people buy the surround sound and never listen to the built in speakers, but they were so bad I would put them on par with grandma's portable AM radio from the seventies.  There is no excuse for sound that bad.I traded it for a Panasonic PT-61LCZ70 with the LIFI lamp and it is just as good a picture to my eyes and completely silent!  Also, the built in speakers are very decent.  For sports I prefer the built in speakers to all the ruckus created through the stereo set-up.

Michael Sanford \"Book Monger\"", "ReviewID": "R2SLM456U64KZT", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "Where should I start.  Two weeks after we purchased the unit, we had to send it to the shop.  Not a Mitsubishi shop, but a non-mitsubishi shop since the authorized Mitsubishi repair center refused to come down here (38 miles) to pick it up.  I wasn't about to load a brand new TV into my car and try to deliver it.Anyway, I got the local TV shop to at least take a look at the unit after spending a week on the phone with Mitsubishi to have the local shop be approved to do the repairs. After all, I wanted them to get paid for their work.The first time, all the logic boards were replaced.  They brought it back and two weeks later the same problem developed.  It apparently overheats and then shuts off.Back to the shop.  In the meantime I purchased a 42\" Samsung Plasma to have something to watch while the Mitsubishi is being repaired, wonderful TV by the way.Three weeks later, the TV is back in the home.  A few weeks later-same problem, overheats, shuts down.  Back into the shop.  Its in the shop for nearly a month.  Now its almost mid summer (we bought it in November 2006).  The hold up is primarily getting Mitsu technical support to return calls, faxes because if they don't, parts cannot be ordered and invoices be paid.Back into the home.  Still having intermittent problems with overheating and shutting down.  By this time, most of the boards have been replaced.The service shop told me that he has another Mitsu of the same size having the same problem and that he thinks it is the thermal sensor that is connected to the projector bulb, since he replaced the other sensor and that customer is not having anymore problems.  The reason why he didn't recognize the problem in mine earlier was that my TV would  indicate that the \"TV will shut down, please check air vents\" and the other did not.  In any event, he said he would order the thermal sensor to see if that will take care of my problem.  The sensor comes in, and its installed IN MY HOUSE which is good for me.No problems until last week, 1/8/08.  All of a sudden, the set shuts off, no warning just the red \"projector\" LED lights up.  I call Mitsubishi, on the phone for nearly 4 hours, accidentally hung up on twice.  I lost my religion my then, and the representative purposely hung up on me.  I called back, and tried to keep my composure since I doubt if I would get the same Indian again.  I explained the problem and he said, \"I think you need a new lamp.\"  I said, \"Well send it too me.\"  They said, \"It will cost you $25-.00 plus shipping.\"  Never mind what I said next.  I told them there was no way in heck that I will pay for a warrantied item.  They said, \"your warranty went out on November 11.\"  I said, not it didn't, \"I have an extended warranty.\"  They said they would call me back, which they didn't for nearly a week and by then I was ready to have another heart attack.Pros:  The TV, when its working, has a great picture and the connectebility is wonderful.  I have most of my electronic devices hooked using HDMI.  I have a Nintendo Wii, Denon DVD, Denon 5.1 Receiver and a Direct TV HDTV-HDTV recorder all hooked up with HDef cables, mostly HDMI except for the Nintendo.  Even with HDMI, you will find that the Direct TV unit is best hooked up with HDMI through your receiver so that you can hear in Dolby on those channels that offer it, and then using RGB+analog audio from the Direct TV receiver to watch regular non-Dolby channels.  The TV will up convert most analog signals to a digital formal as will the Denon.Since I use the Direct TV remote mostly, I can't make any judgements on the Mitsu remote.Cons:  Quality Control., Customer service is the absolute worse that I have had to deal with from any company.  Two weeks after my manufacturers warranty expired, I received a letter from Mitsubishi that they had a problem with the \"THERMAL SENSOR\" in certain models.  GO FIGURE.  Since I am outside the service area of three authorized service centers, I would absolutely not recommend buying any Mitsubishi product unless you have service coverage.  Secondly, PURCHASE a extended Warranty.  It was $160 for one year.  It paid for the projection bulb although the bulb has a 5000 service life on average, but the strain the bulb had to go through with the thermal problem obviously shortened it life span.  I did contact Sears and they will work on them.  They in fact may send them to authorized dealers for the work.  It really doesn't matter, I will never purchase a Mitsubishi product ever again.", "Date": "January 12, 2008"}, {"Title": "Amazing Picture.  Scratch that..

All this time my TV was unwatchable.Finally nailed down a return repair date of Feb 14,2008...a full three months without a usable TV!If this is the kind of product and service Mitsubishi is going to supply now, you can bet I will be telling all my friends about the `NEW\" Mitsubishi!", "Date": "February 7, 2008"}, {"Title": "Looks beautiful, if it works", "Author": "Nikolaus L.

Sometimes they will transfer your call to 'Level 2' Consumer Relations, at times they refuse. Their response is always 'part will be shipped in 7-10 business days'. Four months later it is still the same excuse.Highly disappointed in Mitsubishi. What really upsets me is that the TV is for my elderly mother who is confined to the house and this wonderful product of theirs has been sitting in the living room inoperable for four months.
