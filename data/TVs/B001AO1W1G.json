{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Undersized power supply and now a black stripe on the screen", "Author": "Horhey AK", "ReviewID": "R33HHA1WH7S94D", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "After owning this TV for under 2 years (purchased Nov 2008), the power supply failed (Oct 2010) and required complete replacement ($300 repair).  The repair shop indicated that the issue of undersized power supplies is a known problem with these Samsung plasma TV's, however Samsung did not provide any out-of-warranty coverage for this known defect.  The TV now (July 2011) has a black vertical stripe approximately 1.5 inches wide just to the left of the middle of the screen.  Based on some research on the internet, this may be due to a failed ribbon cable, bad connections on the ribbon cable, or a bad panel that may or may not be repairable (we've not pursued our repair options yet).  Based upon the lack of support from Samsung for a known defect and now another failure of their product, I would not recommend purchasing this TV.Between the issues we've experienced with this TV and those I've experienced with a Samsung Epic mobile phone, I doubt that I will ever purchase another electronic item from Samsung.", "Date": "August 6, 2011"}, {"Title": "Best Brand, Best TV", "Author": "Item Review", "ReviewID": "R5JTKR0ZBWO7K", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This tv has amazing picture quality and many great features to go along with.
