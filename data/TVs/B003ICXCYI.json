This one seemed to have all the amenities for a much lower price than most in it's category (such as the Samsung). I read the feedback that the sound wasn't great but thought it couldn't be that bad.  Well it is.  It sounds like a transistor radio. The speaker faces the back and you cannot adjust for more full sound depth.  It sounds like its coming from a tin can.  The picture was just okay too.  I thought I could add some speakers for around $50 and then be happy with it but the speakers I ordered arrived and they could not be hooked up without an amplifier so I had to return them.  All I wanted is decent sound, not asking for super duper theater quality.  So it went back today after I received my new Panasonic TV.  What a difference.

Miller \"I'll take two!\"", "ReviewID": "R9FSCINHQJ5XP", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "*EDIT* In case you run into the problem I did, here are the screws I'd recommend getting for wall mounting.  Because the screw locations are recessed on the VESA 100x200mm pattern, the screws that came with 2 mounts I had were far too short.Get 4mm screws (diameter) by 20mm in length.  Available at HD with hex head.*COMMENTARY* I don't expect much from TV speakers in a < 2\" panel ...but agreed, these are unlistenable as the set ships.Typically I like to boost bass and treble to get a sound I like.  In this case, the first thing I noticed wasn't what I'd expect.  It wasn't that there was no bass ...it was that the sound was a muddy mid-bass disaster.  In small speakers you can't get decent bass, so I think Philips decided to crank the bass as much as possible to try and get some to come through.  This is a disaster.What I'd recommend ...go into the audio setup area - there are a lot of tweaking options.  Obviously 'to each their own' ...but give this a try as a starting point:Disable the simulated surround mode.Disable the volume leveling (messy on some program material).Go into the EQ, and from left to right (low to high frequencies) set:-8-30+3+5Yes, it looks ridiculous, but at least it becomes listenable.  From there modify it to your taste.  I have not tried a 'good' source yet, but on TV I noticed tons of variation in recording.  Once I get my blu-ray hooked up I may edit these values.Of course ideally you use external speakers, but a lot of people will use this as a 2nd TV and don't want to deal with that.

Don't buy it just for the price.", "Author": "Newbie in New York", "ReviewID": "R2Y4RC3081U4DW", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I read all the reviews before purchasing this TV, and went into this purchase armed with information available at Amazon and elsewhere.  That having been said, despite my higher hopes, I am somewhat disappointed in what came out of the box.  I think this TV's performance falls squarely in the middle of the poor-to-good quality continuum.  At the outset, let me say that I did not purchase this TV with any expectation of listening through its speakers since I have it playing through a 5.1 sound system already in place.  Even so, despite the terrible reviews regarding sound quality, before I hooked it into my sound system, it sounded about as good or bad as I'd expected from its small on board speakers, which means that in a small room, for basic everyday viewing, the speakers are adequate enough.This TV replaced a Panasonic 32-inch 720p I purchased about 7 years ago, which worked just fine.  I wanted to trade up to higher resolution and to LED backlighting, and I thought the Philips would bridge that gap economically.  Although I've got another Panasonic and a Samsung too, the Philips is in the bedroom, where I hang out most to watch television including Blu-ray DVD and video streamed from Apple TV.  Unfortunately, the Panasonic I replaced was a much higher quality TV, and the Philips can't measure up favorably to it, even with the LED backlighting and higher 1080p resolution.The things I'm dissatisfied with:  You must watch this television straight on, as others have said.  Accept that as the gospel truth.  I've never seen a television with such a narrow viewing angle.  The published viewing angle is just not correct.  If you don't watch it straight on, the colors are faded and the picture loses clarity, like the first generation of flat screen computer monitors which have since improved tremendously. If you do watch it straight on, most of the time the color/resolution/contrast/brightness are pretty good, but in order to get there, you need to tweak the hell out of the settings, since the defaults just won't do it.  The Panasonic had higher contrast which means darker blacks and brighter whites and vivid colors with an overall depth the Philips lacks.  Using the Blu-ray DVD player or streaming from Apple TV amps up the picture quality somewhat, but other video sources are not as successful, like live cable or programming recorded on an HD DVR.  Unlike most other brands, having LED backlighting does not make the Philips picture any brighter or more vivid than an ordinary LCD.  The really aggravating part is the lack of consistency in display quality.  I have this television about 1 month, and I've recently begun to notice some strange artifacts in the picture, particularly in scenes with low light.  The picture becomes quite grainy, and when that happens, it seems to pulsate between not-so-grainy and very grainy.  Brighter scenes become less grainy.  But that's not always the case since it happens intermittently; you can watch the same program through the same source, and scenes that are dark are often quite clear and stable, but without any warning, the grainy quality reappears.  It may go a few days without this happening at all, but then the problem returns inexplicably.  Not yet sure what that's all about, but I am sure its not intended by Philips to happen, and if this problem becomes persistent, then I'll return it. I'm hoping against hope that it rights itself. I'm still well within the warranty period.The things I like:  when the source is solid and its not displaying any strange artifacts, the picture is decent if somewhat lesser in quality than a more expensive and tested brand such as Samsung and Panasonic.  For a modestly priced TV, it's pretty stylish with a piano black bezel so it's easy to look at when it's off.  It has a light at the base when its powered up.  The stand is very low, and I've had to raise the viewing height by resting the TV on an additional platform.  Viewing the Panasonic in the same space required no additional platform.  When it's working properly, I'm happier with the product, and feeling good that I didn't raid the college fund to buy it.  The remote is about as basis as it gets; I use a multi-function remote, and as far as I'm concerned, the Philips remote is a toss-away.  But when it's acting funky, I'm less happy.  Again, because it is neither consistently good or bad, I haven't been as quick to return it as I might.Bottom line:  If you can, save a bit more money before you buy your next TV, and don't be tempted by the lowest price.  You'll probably end up with a better experience in the long run.  However, if that's not possible, so long as it behaves properly, this TV is more than just sufficient--it can display your favorite video sources nicely.  It just won't blow you away as other sets might.", "Date": "March 4, 2012"}, {"Title": "Good picture but bad sound", "Author": "Bryan W.
