{"Reviews": [{"Title": "The best monitor available today.", "Author": "J. Donaldson \"Cal-diver\"", "ReviewID": "RDBSZ7J4DJ5GJ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "We purchased an XBR4 and brought it home last night from a brick-and-mortar store. I didn't think they would be available for another month. I've been trying to decide what to purchase for almost 4 months (a common story from what I've read on the internet). Every time I stood in Frys Electronics, or Best Buy, or Circuit City the Sony XBR series would catch my eye. In my opinion they simply are better than all the rest.I looked briefly at Plasma but our living room has lots of windows so we couldn't tolerate the shiny screens. The latest and greatest Samsung LCDs also have shiny screens so alas they were excluded.We compared the Sharp Aquos 52d82 with the Sony XBR3 and once again the sharpness and clarity of the Sony outstripped the Sharp. This is all subjective mind you. You might very well be quite satisfied with another brand. For me I would never be happy had I purchased something else, knowing these XBR series were out there.Last night the Sony 46\" XBR4 was sitting between two Plasma TVs in the store. The Sony was sharper and had deeper blacks than the two Plasmas.I was itching to purchase a Sony but I knew the XBR4 & 5 were coming soon with the 120Hz refresh, 10 bit color, 3 HDMI 1.3 inputs, PC input, 15000:1 dynamic contrast ratio, 2000:1 true contrast, and the BLACK bezel. Yes the XBR4 came with the black bezel which I prefer over the silver of the XBR2.Setup was as easy as the traditional CRT TV the XBR4 replaced in our living room. Plug it in, stick the Playstation 3 HDMI cable into the back, turn it on, select the game input and away we went.We have a library of over 300 480i DVDs. I was concerned they wouldn't look good. I've read many user reviews about poor quality 480i presentations on the previous XBRs. While they can't hold a candle to the Blu-Ray Planet Earth series the standard DVDs look quite respectable on the XBR4.The Sony remote is quite long compared to our other remotes. It has single buttons to change the Picture from Wide Zoom, to Normal, Full, and Zoom. You can quickly also select Vivid, Standard, Cinema, or Custom Picture Modes. The remote is a \"universal\" type that will control a Set Top Box, DVD, Blu Ray disk player, or of course the TV. The remote picked up my Sony DVD player without me having to do anything to set it up. However we have a Logitech Harmony 890 (Amazon has a great price) so won't be using the Sony remote.There are 10 input selections, TV, Video 1 (which we named DVD), Video 2, Video 3, Component 1, Component 2, HDMI 1 (which we named Game for the Playstation 3), HDMI 2, HDMI 3, and PC. I did hook up my PC which has 1080p capability and surfed the internet for a while. I don't think these big screens make good PC monitors though as you have to sit close enough to read text and at that point they are too large.There were no dead pixels, and I haven't seen any \"clouding\" that was the bane of the XBR2&3.Yes it is pricey but in my opinion it is the best.September 27, 2007 updateNow that I've had this LCD for over a month I'm very pleased with it. One additional comment is the built in speakers are quite good. I also recently purchased a 34\" Sharp with built in speakers and immediately noticed the difference in the poorer sound quality in this Sharp. The Sony sounds so good I haven't spent the time to hook the sound output jacks up to my surround sound system.Changing channels could be quicker, but my guess is the TV is trying to figure out what kind of signal it has (480i, 720i, 1080i) and make adjustments.I've had issues with dropping sync with some digital TV channels but I have no way of knowing if it is the TV itself or the quality of my cable. It will lose sync for about 5 seconds then re-sync.", "Date": "August 17, 2007"}, {"Title": "Fantastic once calibrated and having all features turned on.", "Author": "zarxs \"zarxs\"", "ReviewID": "R28DLQB6318YB4", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "HDguru's review of this TV pointed to a problem with the handing of interlaced video and recommended switching from Vivid to Custom (or cinema settings), it does make a difference once you settings on Custom are right.  Picture is incredible.  With Motion flow turned on and sharpness turned up, contract and back-light turned to max it looks like you are looking through a window.  If anyone wants my settings let me know.  I am just thrilled with quality.  I have a PC-VCR attached to the VGA connector.  I have a DVD player connected using HDMI and using the scaler from the TV take it to 1080p.  With sharpness turned up motion flow turned on, detail and edge enhancer turned on the DVD's look amazing I can't wait for a Blu-Ray player, can you say PS3?Weaknesses1. the out of the box settings seem ok but you get so much more after you tweak it.  Which leads me to my only complaint which really isn't one there are so many settings and the manual doesn't do a good enough job explaining what they do (even for a techy).2. The cost is pretty high but if it's worth it.Suggestions buy your cables through Amazon it's worth it.

Webster", "ReviewID": "R33GOOYD0PBJFW", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I was having trouble deciding between an older XBR model (such as the XBR2 or XBR3 ) or waiting for this new model to come out.  I decided to wait, and I am very glad I did.  The new Xross interface is amazing, as is the picture quality.  No \"clouds\" in the corners like some of the XBR2 and XBR3 models.  One thing I must mention that is a real plus is the \"Game Mode\" option for various inputs.  For people familiar with games like Guitar Hero, A/V lag can be a big deal.  The game mode on this model works like a charm and removes almost all lag (I didn't even have to \"calibrate lag\" in the game options).  The only negative I have noticed so far is the automatic backlight adjusting.  It can be easily put to manual, but on the default automatic setting it seems to overcompensate when credits start to roll, or if something is white on a black background.Update:  November 31, 2007I have had this TV since the day it was released, and I don't regret purchasing it at all.  As some of the other reviewers have mentioned, you really need to take the time and adjust the \"Custom\" options to your liking, because \"Vivid\" is a bit over the top.  After 3 months though, the TV is still going strong with no dead pixels or clouding or any problems at all.

I read reviews on every imaginable website.  I even looked at the TV manual on Sony's website, just to see what features it had before I bought it!  If you're going to spend this amount of money you want the best.  This TV is the best.  I ordered it from Amazon because the price was good and I saved around $300 in sales tax.  I figured I could easily spend that money on an upconvert DVD player, which you MUST have to view regular DVD's on this TV (with any kind of quality), and HDMI cables.  I also bought the Sony upconvert DVD player from Amazon.  I have a few tips however to get the best bang for your buck...First tip:  Follow the shipping.  Amazon emails you a tracking # which you can then plug into Eagle Freight's web site to track your package.  Once it gets to your state, call them and arrange for delivery.  Don't wait for them to call you!  When it reaches your state another delivery company may be subcontracted to deliver.  That's where your proactiveness comes in.  By being proactive (and very anxious to receive my new TV), the TV was delivered 3 days early!  The guys came in unpacked it and let me plug it in to make sure it worked.  I had them leave the box, just in case.Second tip:  Google \"XBR4 calibration\".  You'll find a web-site called AVS.  There is a forum on which a bunch of techno geeks discuss how they adjusted this TV.  You can then print off settings and see what's best for you.  The manual for this TV is not comprehensive enough and doesn't explain well what all the settings do.  This website discusses it at length and then some.Third tip:  Direct TV offers the best HD package.  They have over 100 channels.  Standard TV looks OK, but HD is like looking out a window.  So clear...Where ever you buy this TV, you won't be disappointed.  Sony is a leader in electronics, and you get what you pay for.", "Date": "October 26, 2007"}, {"Title": "Sony Delivers Again", "Author": "James A. Swartz \"JASwartz\"", "ReviewID": "R10REZIMC8RKT", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I want to add my review to all the laudatory reviews so far, admitting that I have been a Sony fan for many years and generally tend to prefer their television products to other manufacturers. The one exception, a 35\" RCA tube set purchased in 1995 and a fine tv, was replaced by the XBR4.This was my first foray into HD. I first went to the brick and mortar stores to compare them in person (I recommend doing this even if you end up buying on line.) I was mainly interested in comparing the Sony with the Sharp Aquos, which a friend had told me was comparable in picture quality but lower in price. It could be my bias, but there was no comparison, the Sony looked much better to me. The blacks were deeper and overall, I thought the color representations on the Sony were richer and truer than on the Sharp Aquos (and comparable Samsung models). Standing in front of the two sets, my eyes were naturally drawn to the Sony picture. I did not compare plasma sets because my gut feeling is that the market is going to LCDs now (much like VHS eventually won over betamax, ironically, Sony's standard).With that decision made, I ordered on line about a month ago after continued reading of technical reviews. The main issue was whether to buy an XBR3 at a lower price versus the newer XBR4. The deciding factor was the reports of clouding or \"mura\" in the corners of some XBR3 models and that the XBR4 had reportedly fixed this problem. Spending this much money on a set, I wanted the optimum picture quality and especially good quality for watching Bears and ND football games! So the decision was to spend the extra few hundred and get the XBR4, although my understanding is that these problems with the XBR3 may have been worked out by now.The set arrived in splendid condition. I am a fan of the hi tech look and aesthetically, this is a beauty with the floating glass surrounding the black matte bevel adding a nice touch. To my surprise, the set fit in the same space occupied by the RCA tube set and was much lighter to lift and position. I even like the small Sony logo that gently lights up at the bottom of the set (you can turn this off in the settings menu if you want.) The jacks in the back are well labeled and easy to connect to the various input devices you might have. You will be most concerned with the HDMI inputs but legacy devices such as VHS and older DVD players also connect easily.But note that purchasing the set is just the beginning of your expenses to convert to HD: You will need to shell out at least $75 more for an HDMI cable to connect the tv to your cable box. If, like me, you are also a Directv customer, you will pay another $300 for their HR21 HD receiver (no other choices available), $100 or so for the installer to put in a multi-switch and recable your dish (unless you can do this yourself), and a monthly upcharge for the HD signal. Altogether, add another $500 to the cost of the set to fully convert to HD if you have not been receiving HD prior to this.Once done, the change is amazing and worth it. Hooked to an old receiver prior to installing the HD receiver, the picture was only average and even a little grainier when I applied the \"stretch\" feature as opposed to cropping the image. I even noticed what looked like clouding around the picture edges. However, these problems disappear once you have an HD receiver installed. Even the stations in regular broadcast are clearer and the HD channels are so vivid, they almost look hyper-real; you actually feel like you are at the game. It is even a pleasure sitting and watching shows you have seen before on regular sets in HD to see all the details you missed; I rewatched the entire past season of Top Chef just to marvel at how pretty Padma Lakshmi really is in HD!I agree with others that you should change from the default Vivid mode, which is garish and too bright, to Cinema or Standard right away and then explore the many other tweaks you can make (Sony lets you separately adjust the settings for each input so you can have one set of settings for your cable box, another for your DVD player, etc.). However, once I switched to Cinema mode, I left the other settings at default and have been quite happy with these.The set does hiccup a bit (or perhaps this is the Directv receiver) when switching from HD stations to regular broadcast stations and vice versa, but this is nothing too alarming and will be less of an issue when more stations come on line in HD; right now, many of my favorite stations are in HD on Directv with more planned for next year. I am also trying to figure out how the settings on the XBR4 interact with the settings on the DVR (for example, picture size); this will take some time and has not been a hindrance thus far.In sum, for other long time Sony fans thinking about going HD, this is the set you want, very highly recommended and a nice Christmas present for you and the whole family. (I believe the XBR5 is exactly the same as the XBR4 save for allowing you to change the color of the bezel from black to something else.) For those not yet Sony fans, this set will convert you.", "Date": "November 25, 2007"}, {"Title": "Magnificent HDTV", "Author": "Modrnknght", "ReviewID": "RZJDVY1DTMLMK", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I bought my Sony 46XBR4 on Labor Day, so I have been using it just about a month now.  I can't even tell you all the worrying about which model of Sony HDTV to get that I went through prior to that, especially since some other recent Sony models were several hundred dollars less than the 46XBR4.  Finally, finally!, I bit the bullet and went for this one, knowing three grand was an incredibly ridiculous amount of money to pay for a TV and sweating bullets every day until it got delivered.  I think the most I ever paid was about $700 before years ago (also a Sony and I still have it), but that might even have included a stand.  (A few days later, I was talking to a coworker about each other's activities over the holiday, and I said I bought a 46-in HDTV and mentioned the price.  Let me tell you, this was the first time I had said the price aloud to anyone, and it suddenly hit me just how much money that is, and what the HECK was I thinking??!!!Well, now, I think it was the best TV decision I ever made.  Wait...I'm sorry, I can't call this just a \"TV\"; it should have a more magnificent name.  There are times when I am watching some HD programming (such as Dancing with the Stars -- okay, go ahead and laugh, but I love Jane Seymour on it) or a Blu-ray movie, and I am stunned at the incredible depth, color, sharpness, anything you could name.  I find the Motion Enhancer feature set to \"High\" makes things very three-dimensional like.I also have an Optoma HD72 projector, and up until I got this HDTV I would be watching it almost every night.  There is still nothing to compare with the size of a 120\" image on a huge screen to really give you the theater feel.  However, since getting the HDTV, I have barely had one night when I have used the projector.  Certainly the HDTV image is much smaller than the projector's but, oh, that image!  I have always been impressed by Sony products (I would guess 95% of my home entertainment items are Sony) but I never realized how much better the image was on a Sony until I started looking before - and after - selecting this HDTV.  I have a game now where I go into a Costco or Best Buy and see a line of HDTVs, and I try to guess from the screen alone which is the Sony.  And it is very easy because the Sony HDTVs shine above the other.A few days after I got this TV delivered, and enjoyed playing with it, I went into the Burbank Fry's Electronics store.  It turned out that right near the entrance, they had the 46XBR4 set up next to a 46V3000 or a 46W3000, I think it was.  Now, let me just say that before I decided on the 46XBR4, I was almost going to go with either the V or the W.  However, now seeing the XBR4 and the other model right there next to each other...there was no comparison.  The 46XBR4 made the V or the W, whichever it was, a pale imitation.  They were playing the first Pirates of the Caribbean movie from a Blu-ray player on both screens and I was listening to other people saying how much better that XBR4 was in every detail.  I could definitely see it.  Believe me, I was certainly a happier man when I saw the two HDTVs together because it told me I made the right choice.  That extra money was worth it!I love it!  I absolutely love it!  This is the most incredible picture I have ever seen!

In 45 days the TV has stopped working. I opted for not taking the store warranty thinking that we pay a premium for Sony quality.Boy was I wrong, not only did the TV stop working its now more than a week since I called Technical support for in home service and their service, for lack of a better word is nothing short of miserable.After a week of waiting, I took a day off from work to get the TV fixed, the technician doesn't show up!! He reschedules to another day and even then I can only hope that he shows up today.If I want to complain, I will have to request another authorized repair shop which means more waiting!!Completely dissatisfied with both the TV, that stopped working in 45 days, and the service, which is bordering on the lines of non existent.Update:Finally after a few more verbal disagreements with the completely incompetent repair guy, he showed up more than an hour and a half late.As whiny as I sound, he called to reschedule a second time (after a week a waiting) and then again when he finally got there said that if he cannot find parking he will move on. Not sure if they are training their people to ensure that once you request service from Sony, you will never buy from them again.Thankfully, the TV is now working and hope it will continue to do so.Once again, if you do find yourself with a 'Lemon' you can be almost assured, at least from my experience, that the customer service if terrible!!Update 2:YES....the TV is not working again. And, as you will have it, once again the brilliance of Sony's customer service means at least another week of waiting. If you request quicker service, they cant help because they have to order parts, if you request a refund or an exchange, you have to call during normal working hours. Isn't it fantastic that they actually want you to call from work (yes some of us actually work to be able to afford these things) so that everyone around you is aware of the brilliant Sony product and shadowy customer service (We have spent collectively more than 5 hours with them so we rightfully have an opinion).This has to be taken into consideration before making your purchase. Customer service is equally important and from my experience, I can reassure you of that fact.Totally disgruntled at this point. Will definitely update once again with the outcome.Update 3:A few more days have passed and I have just been told that the part that the TV needs (the whole panel apparently) is out of stock. I cannot tell you how overjoyed I am that I might have use of my 1 month old TV for another 3 weeks. Owned the TV for 6 weeks and if it does get fixed in three weeks, it will not have been working for about 4 out of the 10 weeks that I have owned the TV.I encourage everyone to go take this into consideration before any purchase from SONY is made.", "Date": "April 21, 2008"}, {"Title": "Why Go To The Movies??", "Author": "M.

But nothing beats actually seeing the sets in a side-by-side comparison. There was good, better, and best. The Sony is the latter. To me the 46xbr4 was so much bigger at home than in the store, seeing the 50-60+ inch sets make it seem a little small, it's not. From the outer edge of the bezel horizontally it measures almost 50 inches. It's quite hefty too, weighing in at 84lbs. or 71lbs. without the base. Just something to consider; you will need two people to hang this on the wall. Also if you go that route shoot for a tilting wall mount so you can get the perfect angle from your viewing position.Connections in the back are well placed and labeled, I personally would have liked all three of the HDMI connections to be on the back, (there is one on the side). I ran all of these cables through the wall, why plug something into the side? Maybe a camcorder...The good part is that the picture is beautiful. A nice matte finish that reflects zero light. I have a HD-DVR from Directv pluged into the HDMI. The images from the 50 or so HD channels I get is stunning, the detail and reality is second to none. No other LCD on the market will match this set. I'm rewatching my DVD's on a 1080p upscaling 400v Pioneer player. Why go to the movies?

I had a green line down the middle of the screen and panicked I thought the TV was a dud, it was in the SD signal. I put it in Picture-in-Picture and there was the line resized. I also recorded the effect with the DVR.2) Thanksgivings day - Cowboy's game is on and I see two bright white pixels on a close up of the Cowboy's coach, again panic... different camera the pixels come back, close up of coach, dead pixels.. It was the broadcast camera.3) The only issue with my set has been within the first two minutes of it being on I get the flashlight effect in the bottom left corner, mine goes away once the set has been on for at least two minutes - I'll live with it.The 46xbr4 has a ton of settings, I think I've got it set just right.

No residual image on fast motion and no mura detectable on our set.  Blacks are very good. I think the color is the best on any monitor I have seen.

This is after countless visits to CC and other stores. The samsung 1080p first caught my eye, but then I started to gravitate toward Sony. It's fairly common for people to stop and gaze in wonder at the 40\"XBR4 that CC has on display on one of their endcaps (playing a demo blue ray disk).I've had it for a week now and am fascinated with the PQ for the most part. I previously owned a Mitsubishi 60\" projection tv, and was pretty happy when I got that, but detested the thought of moving it (this was purchased back when projection tvs weighed 200-300 lbs). Comparitively speaking, the XBR4 is like going from a decent 4x4 pickup truck to a $100k sports car.I do have very minor clouding with minor/moderate flashlighting in the upper corners. The clouding is virtually unnoticeable after applying calibration settings, and with powersave on, but I still notice the flashligting in upperhand corners during certain dark scenes, especially when playing blu ray movies with the small black bar at top and bottom of screen. I have a Dec 07 build according to label on back of tv.I noticed that my HP 20\" lcd monitor (I was using for my pc) had major clouding (a solid bar of gray) across top part of the screen when the screen was dark or black. I have researched the clouding issue throughout forums and elsewhere on the net, and have come to the conclusion that this is one of the bugs that could be very difficult for manufacturers to work out, very much like how they've tried to improve the blacks on lcd tv's. It appears to be a problem that happens across brands, and for the people who've noticed these issues - there are too many repeat defects for multiple returns for me to think that a relatively small percentage of the tv's made have these bugs. I believe it could be quite a large percentage, with varying degrees of 'defectiveness', depending on brand, settings, environment, and material being displayed.I don't want to *cloud* over the great features with my rambling of clouding/flashlighting, but I felt this warranted the 4 star rating for picture quality.  I'd have voted it 4.5 if possible, because pic quality is truly excellent for the most part.Blu ray and HD programming look amazing on this tv, as already pointed out by several people. SD is nothing to write home about, though I did notice some improvement after cable company swapped out my digital cable box for an hd box. I'm still peeved that cable company only offers like 4 hd channels in my area.That said, there have been scenes (blu ray or hd tv) that have given me goosebumps while watching this tv. I constantly find myself thinking \"Whoa\" or \"WOW\" lolPS3 Gaming is a blast. I was also very impressed with how well my pc looks hooked up to it, but will be getting a better vid card to play microsoft flight simulator. High resolution 8 mp images (taken with my digital rebel xt) are as crisp and beautiful as they were on the 20\" monitor I was using - even when blown up to full screen view. It's weird to see my nose hairs blown up this big lol It will be great using photoshop with this tv after I get a better vid card and cpu (to handle the editing).Sound quality is impressive. A sound system is not necessary unless you really want to feel the bass and have true surround sound.  Also am noticing the humming (fan?) in a quiet room with no sound on tv.  This is usually drowned out with my ps3 fan/disk noise.  The tv sound with volume up is more than capable of drowning both out with ease lolI opted for the relatively inexpensive HDMI cables, since I didn't need anything over 6' long.  May try the 4' long Monster cable to see if there's any improvement, but I doubt it's necessary.  I still get a good laugh out of the prices for some of these cables.The features were only given 4 stars due to limited P&P; options.  However, there are a ton of options for calibration/adjustment to the picture.Bottom line...I've decided to keep the tv in spite of the mentioned issues, because I believe the pros by far outweigh the cons. I did get a pretty good deal on the tv after a couple of discounts through CC (not the open box discount-it was brand new).  This tv is well worth buying, and I think I'll be keeping it for quite some time.Many thanks to the folks in here (and on the forums) who have provided invaluable  input and information.", "Date": "February 5, 2008"}, {"Title": "Pricey but worth it", "Author": "R.

I didn't even get to finish setting it all up. Good reviews overall, but if you aren't lucky, you're in for a world of hurt.  This is day 34 since the television arrived, and there is still no resolution to the problem.  First I was given two service tech firms to contact.  Neither do home warranty in my area.  One even laughed at me and told me that they'd look at it if I brought it to them.  Imagine that, me in a compact sedan with a 46\" diagonal HDTV television in the back seat. Yeah, right. Sony then directed me to a third firm.  An appointment was made for nearly two weeks in the future, and they only come out on a Tuesday, so I had to take that and take time off work.  Tech guy diagnosed the problem as three - yes, three! - bad circuit boards.  He made a return appointment for, yep, two weeks in the future when the parts would have arrived.  He suggested, however, on the q.t. that I urge Sony to take the set back.  What more might be wrong, he wondered.  So I began to pursue that while keeping active the appointment for the next service call, with the hope that one or the other would happen first.  Nope, about a day before the new appointment for service, I had a call saying that the parts were unavailable, but they would call me when they could be.  When might that be?  Well, the earliest they could be available, but no guarantees, might be two more weeks.  Again, I asked Sony to replace the set.  \"Oh, sir, we're so sorry about your (note: \"your\") problem.  But we can't do that.\"  Why?  \"I don't know.  You'll have to call the X department for that information.\"  Again, more waiting, no calls back, no information. On the 30th day since the set arrived, I phoned and started demanding that a return merchandise authorization be provided me and I would at my own expense send the set back to Sony.  \"Can you tell me what the problem is?\"  Again, went through the whole drama (by this time I have an official complaint file).  Next call on day 32: \"Sir, you can't get an RMA since you have had the television for more than 30 days.\" I popped another high blood pressure pill. Finally, \"We'll send you an email within the next 24 to 48 hours with the information you requested.\"  \"Sir, does this resolve your issue with Sony?\" Huh??  I replied, \"I sure hope so.\"  So guess what?  No email has arrived.  No RMA has been provided.  No parts are available. Still in Sony customer service hell.  By the way, I asked for the name and address of Sony's USA president, and the customer service person said, \"If you sincerely want that information, sir, call X, because I don't have that information in my database.\"  Unbelievable.  Moral of this story: Don't ever buy from Sony directly (SonyStyle.com), as I did.  If you want to go ahead and spin the roulette wheel, then buy a Sony through a reputable reseller so you can return the television without a hassle.  I've been a loyal, repeat customer of Sony over the years.

Quite a bit of fine tuning was required to get the picture just right, and we still make small adjustments trying to get it just the way we want. We don't have BD or HD-DVD, but the upconverting DVD player makes the videos look great, so I don't know how much better a high-def disc player would make them look. I fnd myself watching channels I would not normally be, simply because of the HD picture, such as HD Theater and golf matches on the local channels. To get the picture where you want, there are calibration videos available, but you can also look at user posts  on sites such as AVS Forum. The 46\" seems to be just the right size where the pictures look more realistic but the TV doesn't look like a beast in our small living room.I have heard the issues with \"flashlights\" in the corners, but it's barely noticeable.We have HDMI hookups and I can see a somewhat noticeable difference over the component cables, so we're sticking with the HDMI. There are some \"quirks\" with using the HDMI though. If you run the optical audio from the TV to your home theater system, it won't show up as Dolby Digital, but rather Pro Logic. The TV can supposedly control other devices via HDMI, but doesn't seem to work well for us. It appears the other products must be Sony as well. Also, we run the optical audio from the cable box to the home theater system and even though not connected directly to the TV, the sound from the box does not play when the TV is turned off. This is primarily for listening to Music Choice channels and the such.Fortunately we don't have to run the sound through the home theater system very often because the sound from the TV speakers are much better than anythign we've had before. There is one issue that drives me nuts though and that is the issue of \"lip-synching.\" Sometimes the audio and video speed don't match and Sony's support team hasn't been a lot of help.The 120Hz function seems useless in many cases and just makes the picture look strange. Moving characters seem MORE jittery today, which is contradictory to the purpose of this. this si primarly when the level is turned up to \"high.\" The \"standrad\" level soesn't seem to be as bad.Lastly, the delivery went smooth, though it took too long in my opinion.

Tang \"P7M13 User\"", "ReviewID": "R2JJJTRIFL4TSX", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "After exact one month of having this set, I am very glad to say that the XBR4 is worth the wait and cost.Some background on how I came to buy this particular model:1. I am one of those lucky people that never had any problems with Sony products.2. I had and still have many Sony products, from the yellow water-proof Walkman to MiniDisc Recorder/Player, to Camcorder and WEGA Trinitron's.3. I always wanted an XBR TV set since back in 1995 when I bought their  27\" set with matching stand, but could never justify the cost.About little over a year ago, I bought a Sharp Aquos 37\" 720p set when I retired the 27\" Sony tube (to a friend who does not watch TV). Another friend bought a 42\" XBR2 for about $3200 over the internet around the same time. I am very happy with the Sharp and I used it for watching SD cable TV programs, DVD movies, playing PS3 video games and Blu-ray movies at 720p. During the year, I finished a mahogany \"bookcase\" for the living room that I started a year and half ago. Then it was time to find the right TV to put in there. First, I thought that I could get a 52\". But the \"bookcase\" at about 58\" is not wide enough for a Sony XBR4/5 set and would be very tight for a Sharp set. So, the choices were narrowed to 46\" models. I started looking and it was pretty much no brainer to decide between a Sony 46\" XBR and Sharp's 82U/92U, never liked the sound of \"Samsung\" or owned anything with that brandname, so why bother start it now? Some people still consider the Pioneer Elite plasma as the reference. But after I learned some guy had to spend $500 to have it calibrated after paying $6-7k before he could really use it, that just turned me off. Back then, two things on the Sharp set make it better choice - 4ms video response time and 120Hz refresh rate. Then Sony XBR4/5 were released with 6ms VRT and 120Hz, and BLACK bezel (wow, not gray!). I didn't like Sharp's glossy frame, nor XBR5's. So, XBR4 became the obvious.I have been reading some boards about this particular model and learned that some people had problems with blurred/ghost image. I decided to buy this from a local store just in case. When it was delivered the next day (tax was probably less then next day shipping if bought online), I noticed that it was made in Mexico about a month ago. By then, I had installed an articulating mount (got from Costco for $160 after $40 rebate) in the \"bookcase\" to the wall. The box that it comes in allows you to remove box top like a cover while the TV sits on its stand on the base (bottom half of the box). That allows me to take the screws off and detatch the set from its stand when lifted up.The clean symmetric looking without its stand is the best part that you can't find in any other brands/models. Chrome logo in wider bottom frame between the spearkers sounds familiar? SONY logo in the glass will light up during power on/off (can stay on if set). There are a few LED's in the lower right corner of the glass that look like floating in there.The TV without stand weighs about 65 lbs. (my guess) was a bit challenge for me to put it up on the mount. Not because of the weight, rather its size and my bookcase's top was in the way. Good thing was the mounting bracket is long enough for me the hold it in balance while lifting up to the mount's receiving part. I had to adjust the mounting bracket once on the back of the set to make it right. It has VESA 400x200 pattern. After it was mounted, the bottom is about 18\" from the floor and 1\" below the bookcase's top rail. That gives me a perfect viewing level - the horizontal center is about eye level when sitting down. I just can't imagine anything else would look better in there.[...]I hooked up my PS3 to play video games and watch Blu-ray movies. I also bought a Radio Shack remote controlled VHF/UHF antenna ($50) to get off-air HD channels. I have been using a cheap ($15) GE antenna upstairs for the 37\" Sharp to get HD signals (watched last SuperBowl), but it did not work downstairs. The new antenna allows me to pick up about 12-15 HD  channels. Some people are still confused and keep looking for/overpay for HD antennas. All you need is a good regular VHF/UHF antenna, then your HD set will do the rest. Among the off-air HD channels I pick up, there are mainly 720p and 1080i. When I watched CSI: Miami on Monday night, the colors are just phenomenon. In comparison, my analog cable TV is somewhat grainy as well expected and is no worst than on a regular tube set. Now, the exciting part - Blu-ray. The PS3 games are just unbelievable. I, personally couldn't really tell the differences between 720p and 1080p games. But of course, I always look the back of game case for supported solution. After the firmware update on the PS3, it can upscale/play regular DVD and it improves image quality quite bit. My favorite is watching the Blu-ray version of the Planet Earth set. The combination of the breath-taking video and being played on this XBR4 set just can not be matched by anything else on the market. Some people complain about the fan noise. For this size, the best viewing distance is about 6-8 feet. I normally turn the volume pretty low and I have not noticed it at all. The fan on the PS3 is much louder, but even when I play subtle game like the Lego Star Wars with my son, I am not bothered by the fan noise. The sound quality from the build-in speakers are very good. I thought of getting a HDMI/7.1 receiver to go with the new TV since I am still using my 12 years old Denon AVR-5600 THX/Pro-Logic A/V receiver.The only thing I wish to have is a better remote control or even just a better layout. The numeric buttons are way up there from the volume and channel rockers. And you can't switch between cable and antenna with a single button. Why can't it be made into the input list that let you select? Of course, you can't save both cable channels and antenna channels in one favorite set. As for improvements, even the set works pretty well right out of box. There are so many adjustments that you can play with, you could easily mess it up and lost. If the settings can be edited on a computer thru wi-fi (well, it's not there) or the USB/service port that's already on there, that would save a lot of time and make things much easier to manage. I recently bought a all-in-one wi-fi printer for $150 and love it. I am glad that waited a few months to get mine since some people are having this smearing/clouding problems with their sets. I just can't image some thing like that would happen or should I just feel lucky. Anyway, I will be enjoying watching this TV for as long as it lasts. Now go out and get yourself a PS3, it's still the best deal on a Blu-ray disc player. You ever wonder how will your family photo albums look like when you do a slide show in 1080p?

I would think this speck is on all sets since they are following a \"Process\" to manufacture the screens.I am really depressed now :-( I love this TV since the pictures are great but it just has these little problems that bothers me since this is not a cheap set and should not have these pesky problems.", "Date": "March 9, 2008"}, {"Title": "Dissappointed", "Author": "Jeffrey Nielsen \"Jeff N\"", "ReviewID": "R3DY1PV1F4DIMO", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I have had the television about a year and a half now and when I turn the television on the picture is terrible with the color darkening and melding together.

Wow again.  Still outstanding.  I have found the settings that are best for common programs.  Have now re-cabled with RG6 Quad-shield, and got Comcast to give me a new drop from the street, and all new box stuff (no charge). We are VERY happy with this purchase.  The family and I are still impressed each day we turn this TV on.April 2008: Just got the Sony Bravia XBR KDL-46 1080p LCD HDTV.  It replaced a CRT - Sony Wega KV36F16 circa 2000 that is still performing flawlessly, but gotta prepare for the much-ballyhooed date in 2009.  The LCD was delivered by CEVA a day earlier than estimated by Amazon (I took the steps to track it properly, and made a phone call, too).Easily hooked it all up to the local cable service (monopoly-minded telecommunications giant that it is), HDMI, using my Sony STRDE945 receiver and Bose Acoustimass 5.1 for audio. Within thirty minutes of the arrival of this TV at my front door, I was ready to watch this thing do its thing.  It searched.  I set.  In a room filled with bright springtime daylight and sun angle, I was gratified and satisfied as I watched my favorite MLB team win their 1:05 daytime start handily.  Then, as I began tweaking my settings, and the evening waxed and waned into the dark night, I was absolutely sure I'd made the right choice.  There is no fan noise.  And of course, SD is not spectacular, and HD broadcast is 720p, and maybe a rare or occasional 1080i.  I can't wait to see a proper DVD in full regalia.Sony?  I'm a frugal and cautious middle-class consumer.  Knowing what I've read of this company and its megalomaniacial approach to consumer electronics and domination of the whole industry, it galls me to admit that apparently, and in my opinion, Sony has recently matched and surpassed its competitors in LCD price-to-value of television consumer electronics for the masses.  And plasma is no longer the way to go (for me at least) and has been surpassed by LCD. I still have a 27\" Sony Trintron circa 1987 in the guest bedroom which is still looking good, but will soon have to go - wanna buy it for ten bucks?  I've never had a problem with any Sony TV, VCR, DVD, or A-V receiver.  I had a Panasonic VCR (my first which never died, just became obsolete).  In fact, I've never been let down by any of the audio components that have been Sony, either.  Can't say the same for Onkyo, or the old Kenwood or Technics. (Nothing beats my Nakimichi cassette machine for true state-of-the art for that medium.)  But, I digress, this is about TV.The 46\" size and clean looks of this rig works best for my house, considering the windows, southern exposure, recessed lighting in the room, and of course, the 15' distance from which it is viewed.  I considered the 52\" but decided that would be overkill for the space I have, and the higher price to boot.I'm no videophile, but I have close friends in the business as cameramen, and stage managers,etc. in nearby Atlantic City to whom I turn to for advice ... you know, the kind of persons that buy that high-end stuff for double the price or more for only slightly marginally noticeable improvements.  I know they will approve of my purchase when they see this.  It certainly looks to me that the 46XBR5 (that's five) is basically the same rig.  And yes, the XBR6 is coming.  But man, do I hate the reflective, dust-attracting \"stylish\" piano-black finishes every manufacturer feels compelled to market to the masses this year.  It will date your TV like the silver look of the last decade.  As it is, the Sony design of the \"distinctive\" glass framing adds a one-inch margin capable of reflecting distractions from the environment the television is placed in by the actual consumer. Let's just focus on the viewing area, though.I pulled the trigger on this LCD for after six months of researching the online reviews, viewing demonstrations in many high-end electronics stores, the three big-box electronics stores, and even discount online sources.  I didn't think I'd make such a big-ticket item purchase online, but the time to do so had come, what with the price of fuel spiraling higher and higher, and \"free shipping\" included in the price. I see today, two weeks later, it's here at Amazon and is over $150 bucks more than what I paid.  A local independent appliance store can usually meet or beatWell, how about the TV?  Even the delivery man said, \"this is the best LCD on the market for the price right now.\"  It arrived at my house in perfect condition, but I was nervous when I saw the box had some black, greasy dirt on its bottom from the trucks, and he asked that I put down on old blanket or something to protect the floor.All was well and fine with this.  I'm satisfied with this purchase.  I'd recommend the Sony Bravia XBR4 1080p to my friends and family, and I no longer worry about ordering online.  For products over $50, I would not trust a NYC electronics marketer online, however, heck, I don't even like their sales tactics in their brick and mortar stores I've been to  The sub-contracted Ceva delivery man who, with my assistance, brought it up to the 2nd floor of this Jersey Shore raised ranch on pilings, unpacked it, and assisted me to lift it to its waiting stand, said to keep the packing materials and the box for a couple days, just in case.

Bought Avatar as my first Blu-ray movie. Let me just say that I will likely never go to a theater ever again to see a graphics and computer animation intensive movie. I will wait and buy or rent it on Blu-ray. Between the quality Blu-ray player, well made movie on Blu-ray and the quality of this TV, the visual was stunning. The streamed video also looks terrific, even through WIFI.So lets hope I can add another positive addition to this basic review in another 3 years.

They do not come right and say that this TV is ruduced or cheaper because it does not come with the stand, or maybe they think your just going to buy a wall mount anyway.  One of the ways to tell is go to Sony's website and look at the specs, especially the weight of the TV with and without the stand, 84lbs (38kg) with pedestal; 73lbs (33kg) without pedestal, then check what the shipping weight of the TV will be from the prospective merchant.

The speakers thats in the TV work real well. Next, to put it to the test, I hooked up the TV with my Playstation 3 and it was amazing...I played Heavenly Sword and Call of Duty 4, both were outstanding with vibrant color and rich texture. Then, I tried out a blu-ray movie which is included with the Playstation 3 and again was Impressed with the quality. Basically I think SONY makes some of the best products on the market today.

MY REVIEW IS BELOW. Be aware that in August the new models usually come out. The prices drop on the older models. In December the prices will drop on the newer models and then go back up until the next summer. This has been the pattern; perhaps it will change due to the poor economy. Whatever model you buy, you'll love the TV with HD. Remember, you gotta get an HD hookup, which is more money. I have Dish which recently added more HD channels in my area, probably because Direct TV has been adding more. I think I get something like six HBO channels, not long ago I only got one in high def.*************************************Purchased this TV from Amazon and about a week later it arrived on time by Eagle shipping without any problems. I must say that with the Dish HD signal the picture is amazing. The colors and clarity are second to none.Without the high def signal the picture is just okay so if you buy this set you gotta go high def.Plus what's great about Amazon is their price protection policy which saved me another $100  since the price went down about 30 days after I made the purchase. This made it the best deal anywhere and I've researched the TV and the market for months. I'm a happy camper no doubt. Now all I need is either the Blue Ray or HD DVD player and I'm set.

There is a world of difference. I rate this TV better than all the TVs out there. That's why it is more expensive. That's why it's a Sony. The XBR line is their flagship.

Setup was very easy, the back panel is very non-cluttered (and flat) which is nice.The picture looks great with minor tweaking. Sound is very good although I hooked it up to HT system so do not use the internal speakers any longer.My only complaint is that while the blacks overall are quite good, I have very noticeable (verging on annoying) \"cloudiness\" when the screen fully dark, e.g., during a nighttime or space scene.  The cloudiness is areas that are not nearly as black as other parts of the screen.  Particularly noticeable is a big puffy area in the lower right quadrant, and two almost identical \"beams\" of non-blackness that streak down from the upper right and upper left corners, almost like shadows from \"spotlights\" glowing down from each corner of the TV (the upper right corner being a bit worse than the upper left).  In other words, in dark scenes, the black background is not at all uniform and no amount of adjustment seems to correct the issue.  If I had to guess, it has something to do with the way the screen platter was laid down and mounted since slight pressure on the screen (as with all LCDs) causes brightness distortion; I dont think the screen frame was evenly tensioned. Also, the very very edge of the screen is black but just an inch or so in from the edge it is lighter around the circumference of the TV, again hinting at uneven tension on the platter. This is aside from the clouds and beams described above.The picture during lighted scenes is phenomenal. I am only disappointed by the very noticeable and non-uniform dark screen performance.  I think if a Sony engineer took a look at it they would definitely see where improvement could be made. I am not at all an \"audio or videophile\" but I noticed the dark non-uniformity within 60 seconds of turning on the TV.So I give the TV a 4/5 overall picture, but a 1/5 on dark screen performance.

And although I am not in complete \"Awe\", this Sony Bravia KDL-46XBR4 is everything that it claims to be. 120hz Picture quality, color saturation, and High Def images are all beyond the norm, with accurate color depth, consistent performance and beyond average on HDMI 1.3 input source depiction. My Sony PS3 as well, seems to excel on visual clarity with it's picure quality with this monitor, not just because their manufacture sources match, but even with a typical 420p DVD, the upscaling is sublime I must say. I believe there is upscaling performance on both the PS3 end as well as the Sony Bravia Engine Pro on the monitor end, so on both ends you have performance enhancement. As well, as expected, the Blu-Ray Source achieves equally impressive, beyond lifelike imagery, although I believe that this technology, believe or not is still limited, in that as we all know, Blu-Ray with full 120Hz/96 is not utilized in it's full potential on most Blu-Ray Titles as of yet, as I quote a noteable review, \"No (very few) xvYCC films are currently available, and we expect the first such xvYCC-enabled content to come in the form of video games\". Blu-Ray and the new HDMI 1.3 are young, such as it is not widely available in the highest level of it's full capacity. Not canning anything, but still not to be dismissed as an average hi-def monitor mind you, but this Sony XBR4 provided me full on as much as I can tell you. I am very impressed.You can be one of those person's with all the techno buzz words that can praise or kill Sony XBR 4 vs Samsung 6 series, with contrast ratios blazing specs, all I can say, screen glare factor on this Sony XBR4 vs Samsung-81F series is a noted issue and one must understand that ANY source of light on the Samsung will cause a irritating reflection, this will be the discerning factor in making that choice. In be it, I opted for this Sony for that reason alone. My viewing room is fully lined with half-length windows...a sunroom, and it has no problem with it's mattel screen viewing...none whatsoever!And also I must add that my choice for the XBR4 vs XBR5 was finially decided in that a single digit advantage was not worth $800+, being XBR5 offers the addition of the piano black finish and theatre sync (only applicable with Sony Recievers's mind you) and the option on this XBR4 had a option color bezel in 5 colors, WOW, broke that decision right there. BTW, the stock color with glass bezel is cool on it's own, believe me. Also, for some reason the Sony Remote does not operate my PS3 as a DVD Player, they MUST have something to fix this, but as usual they play stupid, the only problem I have had mind you.Okay, no techno babble here, but babble I do, sorry. But this is just an honest home-spun opinion. A noteworthy fact, HDMI 1.3 specific cable jargon, here we go, concerning is it not especially important to have a cable that is branded 1.3 specific...I hate to say it, but there IS a difference in that I wired in-wall a typical high end HDMI cable and then compared it with, in this instance, a Sony HDMI 1.3 cable direct input with this specific cable and compared to the two, fiddled with settings and compared to the two with my highly acute visual senses, and I hate to say it, but there IS a difference in that the high-end xyv color. This brande so called \"Deep Color\" is vastly noteworthy and well I was skeptical of the cable issue as are many. Honestly, it took me 3 visits to the store to give in on this, but this proved it's importance to me. The Sony cable was much less expensive than say the M---R brand, so that is worth taking note of. I hated to mention that, being I scanned the blogosphere on this issue for months before my purchase, noting the opinions of many that there was NO difference. Thus my short-sightedness in imbedding it my walls the typical HDMI cable, believe me I am not happy, but is just MY observation. It is not incredibly important though, just noteworthy. This HDMI 1.3 protocol is for \"future\" Blu-Ray and PS3 gaming and I suppose HD photo which would benefit the most from this, but only if you direct wire it with this cable, not a daisy chain I believe. Please be in no hurry to change-over, very few titles out to utilize this, but that is an issue I chose to address. Oh yes, another minor issue, I would recommend if you settle on one size of screen, consider the next size up that is in the back of your head, or save you packing material, please consider. If possible,  do that bigger option if you \"HAVE ROOM!\" and can afford it, believe me I made a minor mistake between the 46\" and 52\", and chose the lesser. This even complies with the \"Master Control\", the better half, which agrees after my scourging of that issue upon my preliminary decision making...just a heads up.To wrap it up, this Sony XBR4 is very pleasing to the eye in itself and in it's picture quality, what else matters. The picture excels as mentioned, and the surround sound is very good well, you will have your Home Theatre Surround Stereo turned off most of the time for normal viewing and I must say, the New Toy WOW factor seems to linger on so far, new toys has such a short WOW factor anymore...huh!

Patch \"Audiophile\"", "ReviewID": "R2IBJJABAZEIO6", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Not enough has been made in either Sony's promotion or the public discussion of the upscaling capability of the current generation of 120hz, 1080p/24fps, motion enhancement LCD TVs.  The improvement over the standard 1080p version is far more than the jump from 720p to 1080p. Combined with a high-definition player (preferably a Toshiba A30 or A35 HD DVD player that upscales to the 1080p/24fps output; apparently, Blu-ray players only upscale to the 1080p/30 output) and an HDMI cable and applying the various levels of motion enhancement, you will experience video nirvana when playing back your existing DVD's and videotapes.The Sony \"Motion Enhancer\" control, which greatly improves color depth and image separation for lower-quality media sources, can be set at \"High\" or \"Standard\" levels or turned off.  It has little effect on high-def sources or even some recent good quality standard DVD's, and can be left off for these discs.Applying the \"Standard\" level to most older DVD's yields a stunning level of upscaling, far superior to that output by a standard DVD player with \"HDMI Upscaling\", and truly \"near high-fef quality\".  Comparing the upscaled to the high-def, you will be hard-pressed to notice the difference.The upscaling brings out the full quality of recent digital remasters.  Old Technicolor films (\"Gone With the Wind\", \"Singing in the Rain\", etc) look as if they were made last year, not the more-than-half-century ago.  You will clearly see the tears (sincere and otherwise) welling up in Vivien Leigh's now bright blue eyes.The real deal maker is the upscaling achieved by applying the \"High\" level to the remasters of the 1930's black-and-white films (\"Astaire and Rogers\", \"Thin Man\", etc.).  If you have followed these from theaters to the Late Late Show to videotape and early DVD, one viewing of \"Swing Time\" will be worth the price of the set. The Art Deco dance floors and Fred's Brylcreemed hair shine like the real things.  The \"High\" level also does wonders for videotapes, as well as standard definition TV viewing.With the dramatic price reductions in both the XBR4 and the high-def players, particularly the HD DVD variety (they may be obsolete for high-def, but that is not why you want one), now may be the time to investigate and invest.

Couldn't find anything that I thought had a better picture.  Ended it up getting it at Video & Audio Center, same prices as Amazon (within $10) free shipping because I was local, and they had a promotion for a free Bravia home theater system.  The TV is as good as advertised, sports, video, etc. all look awesome.  Speakers actually work remarkably well, but I usually don't use them.  The standard settings, except for the picture (Vivid was just too bright for me), worked fine, though I've played around with them since then.As for HD service, I thought I was going to be able to take my time, but standard feeds just look sad.  I had DirecTV, and ended up just upgrading because the price worked out to be the same as Dish Network over the minimum subscription period (2 years for DirecTV, 18 months for Dish).  That and they could install it the next day.  My old DirecTV DVR (with Tivo) was just better.  I've been disappointed with the interface and remote control, but everything works.  It just could work better.  For the channels that my wife and I watch, the monthly service is a bunch more for Dish Network, which is why even with the current promotions it was a wash to just upgrade.  I did get DirecTV to only charge me for the box $299 + tax, and to toss in 6 free months of HD service.  If you've never had a DVR you probably won't mind the DirecTV one, but I feel like its a downgrade over my old one (except for the picture in picture feature when using the various menus).  Picture is great, there are a ton of channels in HD, and if you're signing up with DirecTV for the first time you'll get a good deal.

A year ago I had the lcd replaced because the picture would not render. Tech replaced and worked fine until a couple weeks ago. I called Sony 800-222-7669 and told them the picture in the bottom left was cloudy (darker than the rest), the rep didn't say much so I just said I would call the repair shop that replaced it last year. I called ABL Electronics Madison Heights MI 248-588-6663 and related the problem. They told me Sony is aware of an issue with these tv's and they will warrant until 2012! This extension was just issued by Sony very recently and that is probably why the rep did not tell me, since they may not always have the  latest information. Same guy as last year from ABL came today and swapped out the lcd and we're back to normal. I hope everyone having a problem finds out about this so they can get their's covered at no cost.5/5/08 - the tv has shown some dead pixels occasionally. Oddly, they flicker and do not always appear in the same place when watching different programs. Does not always do it. It is not terribly vexing and total number at any given time of appearance is maybe 5 tops. Noticeable in a black background. I think I maybe should have bought a warranty if it becomes intolerable....One other kind of major issue - we can't use a Wii with this tv. It puts out some kind of signal that bothers the pickup for guitar hero. I haven't heard of anyone else describe this problem so don't know if it is common to all Sony's or just this model or what.Original post: I pulled the trigger this morning and anticipated delivery date is 1/29. I guess I'll have to burn a vacation day for that day. Like many, I have been researching for months. All the reviews have really bolstered confidence in my decision. I already purchased from Amazon the Sanus Articulating Mount For 30\" To 50\" Flat Panel TVs based on reviews. When the tv arrives I will update this review for both tv and mount. I am also getting directv installed Monday 1/21 in preparation for sony delivery. One thing though, the price tonight is about $100 less now than in the morning when I ordered. I also bot the Yamaha RX-V2700 - AV network receiver - 7.1 channel from Amazon so we'll talk about that as well, sometime the first part of Feb after I get everything hooked up.  I just hope I can figure out how to update this review. In the meantime I'm giving this an anticipatory 5 thumbs up.The tv is now mounted on the wall and everything works perfectly. The only thing is, the screws provided with the Sanus are too long or too short. No big deal as I went to my local hardware store and purchased the right length. And as the instructions say, be careful not to put the screws in too far. 2 washers were the ticket. Assembly was easy. Also, when you level the tv, you do not need to loosen the allen screws much more than maybe a quarter turn. It is easy to adjust. For my application, the mount went on a cinder block wall (it runs the length of the house, splitting the basement in half). I used 12\" carriage bolts attached to 2x4's for additional stability, bored a hole (using door knob circle cutter for the drywall and a masonry chisel) for cabling and used a perfect fit section of pvc for a clean look. I use DirecTv and the picture is fantastic. I did not tweak any settings as it looks fine out the box. If you use the Sanus mount and only have 2x4 to attach to, I would think you would need to be dead-on center to make sure it is secure. Other than that, the mount is awesome.As for hdmi and optical cable, purchase from Amazon and save yourself a BUNDLE. Also, delivery from Eagle was excellent and happened earlier.
