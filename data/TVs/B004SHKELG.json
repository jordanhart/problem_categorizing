{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Feature by Feature Review", "Author": "Bob Robertson", "ReviewID": "R2X8EK8V71L22C", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I spent several months researching HDTV's and finally landed on this model (Samsung LN40D630).  I read a lot of the forums online (Cnet.com) about this particular unit, and I had several concerns that wound up being unfounded.  I think the best way to approach this review is to do it by some of the major features, so here goes:AutoMotion Plus (AMP):I was initially concerned about the AutoMotion Plus feature.  Many forum posts complained about it.  I was afraid it would be too smooth (i.e too much \"soap opera effect\").  My concerns were unfounded.  It's easy to turn off this feature and it is easy to customize.  I love that it is customizable by SOURCE (meaning the settings for your cable may be different for your DVD or BluRay player and the TV will save them as such). I like it very much for fast-motion (such as hockey games) and use the \"clear setting\" for just about everything else.  The \"demo mode\" is a nice feature showing you the comparison of AMP on and off on a splitscreen.  pretty cool.Connectshare:This is the feature that allows you to plug in a USB hard drive or thumb drive and play videos, music, or look at pictures.  I'm pleased to say that this quickly has become my favorite feature since I have a lot of videos saved on my computer.  The TV does a great job reading almost all of the major file formats.  The external HD powers off when the TV turns off, which is a nice feature (because I don't have remember to unplug it every time I shut off the TV and vice versa).  The built-in video player interface firmware works great (pause, fast forward, and returns you to the place where you left off if you have to shut down, even if you turn everything off and come back later).  The music player interface is a bit clunky, but it works ok.  My only complaint about the music player is that it doesn't include a shuffle feature.  I've written Samsung and asked that such feature be included in future firmware upgrades.Firmware Upgrade:One of the first things I did was upgrade the firmware.  The instructions on Samsung's website (and in the owner's manual) were easy and worked perfectly.  I look forward to further refinements from Samsung.Allshare:As I understand it, this feature allows you to plug your TV into your PC and watch the videos, look at pix, or play music you have stored there. I haven't quite set this up yet, but I did download and install the Allshare software from Samsung on my PC and I setup my media server in no time flat.  Very easy and straightforward.  All I need now is a long ethernet cable to plug it into the TV (you can go wireless with a special USB wireless adapter, but the adapter is a lot more expensive than an ethernet cable!).  I'll be plugging the TV directly into my router.  Fingers crossed.  But even if it doesn't work, it's really no big deal to save media on an external USB hard drive and plug it into the TV directly.  [I'll update my review after I've had a chance to experiment with this feature].TV Picture Quality:Samsung is hard to beat in this category.  The image in the store looked great. And looked even better in my home environment.  Clear, crisp, beautiful.  Very happy!Sound Quality and Outputs:This is perhaps the weakest feature of this TV.  The sound is often \"tinny.\"  Fortunately there are several easily selectable default sound settings that allow you to compensate.  The Clear Voice setting works great for dialog.  An equalizer is included for a custom setting, which can also help compensate some as well.  I was disappointed that the unit didn't have a dedicated headphone out jack on the side.  It does, however, include a single \"audio out\" jack in the back.  This works fine with my wireless headphones which are amplified (i.e. built-in volume control), but it won't work well with \"dumb\" headphones (with no amplification).  Since there is only one audio output jack, I had to plug in a splitter to send the audio out signal to both my headphones and my home stereo, which works fine.  It also has an optical audio out jack, but my home stereo is ancient and won't accept that input type.  I wish the audio out jack was variable (i.e. volume would be controlled by the TV), but it isn't.  Perhaps the optical audio output is variable... I don't know... haven't tried it.That about sums up the major features of this TV.  Overall I'm very pleased with my choice.  Hope this helps you!", "Date": "June 15, 2011"}, {"Title": "Great basic LCD TV", "Author": "Patrick Oden", "ReviewID": "R2ILNF3H7DG5ED", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I hesitate calling this a 'dumb' tv, but that seems to be the option given the moniker Smart TV that is applied to so many higher end products these days.Maybe the LN46D630 isn't as much dumb as it is ignorant.  Which isn't a bad thing. Indeed, that's why I bought it.  More on that in a bit.Before I get to saying what I like about it, let me respond to some of the negative comments I've read.  I can't answer for their experiences, but I can share my own.  The picture quality is quite good.  I don't have any issues with light leaking or other problems. It is a very consistent image that allows for a great variety of adjustments.  If you look in the discussion under the 40 inch version of this model, you can find some added pointers about adjustment.  I also got the Disney WOW! dvd which helps for much more precise adjustment.Some others have noted problems with shipping.  I had no problems at all. Amazon shipped this tv through Pilot Shipping, with a scheduled appointment set when I purchased this.  Very professional service.  It did take a bit longer than my usual prime shipping, but everything was handled quite well and everything arrived in perfect condition. Two men carried the television into my living room. They didn't set it up, but I didn't want them to anyhow.When I did set it up, everything turned on quick and easy.  The size means that unless you're big and strong you might want help setting it up, as it is a bit awkward to maneuver to attach the base.I bought this model because I was wanting a television that allowed for good multimedia connections but was not loaded down with a lot of extraneous features I wouldn't want or need.  I don't need a television with its own browser or apps.  I have it hooked up to a pc, which gives it all those functions.  Indeed, with so many game systems, blu-ray players, etc. with their own ways of connecting to media sites, paying a lot more for a television that does the same seemed plain silly.  The newest models offer 3D, but that's much more of a gimmick than something I really wanted. The technology isn't advanced enough to use it without thinking about it, and when I'm watching a show or movie, I want to think about what I'm watching, not how.So, this 'ignorant' television allows me to connect whatever I want, and have a great image when I do.  I have an over the air antenna connected to it as well as a PC, playstation, and dvd player.  The reception is good with the antenna, and living near Los Angeles gives me about 70+ channels to choose from (though a large percentage of those are in languages I don't understand).  I connected my PC to the TV with a HDMI cable, and that provides both high quality image and sound.  It's like having a much larger monitor with all the same functions, but I almost exclusively use it for multimedia.The sound is good, but not great.  We live in an apartment now, though, which means that great sound would bother the neighbors.  We can have a fan on, and still keep the volume about 15 (out of 100), which means the speakers work sufficiently and are indeed better than the model we had before.The image quality is superb.  Deep blacks and bright whites.  There does tend to be a bit more shadow in these Samsungs, so you have to think about whether you want deeper blacks or more washed out images that show more detail. I've yet to be bothered by it, myself, so it is far from being a major issue.  Color is great, and the extensive adjustments that are possible make it very personalized to your own preferences.Each of these preferences have to be adjusted for each source, however, which makes for a bit more work. I wish they had a universal setting to adjust every input the same.But that's a minor issue among many other very great attributes. I wanted a TV that functioned more as a screen for my other media products, not a TV that replicated all those other functions. I wanted a TV with high quality picture, a lot of inputs for both new and older components, and that would allow me to customize what I needed without having to pay for a lot of stuff I didn't need.This has fulfilled and exceeded in parts my expectations.", "Date": "September 29, 2011"}, {"Title": "Excellent value", "Author": "Brian C", "ReviewID": "R1Z56SKQTVEUMF", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I purchased this TV to replace a 2006 LG plasma that went out of commission.  It was going to cost $300-350 to fix it so why not spend a little extra for a brand new TV...  Overall extremely happy with the TV, it was a very good value for the price.1) Picture quality - of course compared to the old LG plasma, the picture quality of fantastic.  Rich colors, very little glare on the screen, pretty good viewing angle.  I looked at this and several other Samsung models at a local electronics store, and I honestly could not tell much difference between this model and some of the higher-end models in terms of just the picture.  I was specifically interested in the D550, which is about $100 cheaper since it is 60 Hz, but the D630 did have a small but noticeable improvement in fine details especially with moving objects.  I also thought about the D5500 but to me there was not much difference between LCD and LED all else being equal.  I can see why LED would be attractive for people who plan to hang it on the wall, but if you are going to let it sit on a stand you can't really appreciate how thin it is anyway.  Made more sense to spend the extra $100 for 120 Hz than LED.2) Sound quality - so so, but what do you expect from a TV.  It is good for regular TV viewing, I really like the \"clear voice\" mode which lets you hear conversations easily without cranking up the volume.  The TV speakers sound a little thin or hollow if you are watching a movie.3) Other features - remote works fine, nothing particularly good or bad.  TV stand swivels, which is good.  Connectivity is good, 4 HDMI and 2 USB are more than enough for me.  It does not have built in wireless, which didn't matter for me since my router usually sits under the TV anyway so I just hook up the ethernet cable if I needed internet connection.  No web browser or apps, which again would have been pretty useless for me since I can get all of that through my PS3.  I tried the Allshare feature to stream videos from my computer to the TV.  It works okay but I find it easier to just connect my portable hard drive to the TV.", "Date": "May 11, 2011"}, {"Title": "Samsung LN40D630 40-Inch 1080p 120Hz LCD HDTV (Black)", "Author": "Gene Kim", "ReviewID": "R6V3ZH5Q1DC01", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Introduction:The Samsung LN40D630 40-Inch 1080p 120Hz LCD HDTV (Black) was purchased to replace a Samsung plasma that I've had for 10+ years. I wanted a 40+ inch 1080p 120Hz television by either LG or Samsung, ultimately going with a Samsung LCD TV.Picture Quality:Far superior to my old Samsung plasma. I'm amazed by how rich the picture is and details that can be seen. I have Verizon Fios and the HD picture is fantastic. The quality is \"flexible,\" meaning that I can still see the great quality when sitting at various angles. You can change the PQ if necessary by using the remote. The quality of the TV is fantastic on Playstation 3 games through an HDMI cord. Everything that you do on your controller is very responsive on the screen and has smooth animations/movements.Sound Quality:Better than I expected. I read reviews saying that the sound quality wasn't so great and that you're better off getting a home theater sound system, but I still chose this model. Like the PQ settings, there are various settings on the remote to change the SQ (Standard, Clear voice, Movie, Music). The \"Standard\" setting sounds hollow and lacking for certain shows/movies. The \"Clear voice\" and \"Movie\" setting definitely amplifies the voices and sounds that you can hear for movies or games.Some Other Features:-TV stand swivels and very flexible (this is very convenient for me because I have the TV on a home theater furniture where I can't go around the TV--the TV turns around to me instead so that I can easily plug in cords)-Remote is responsive and simple to use (you can make the buttons light up by pressing a button located on the top right hand corner)-Great inputs (4 HDMI and 2 USB 2.0 Ports-There aren't any web browser or applications (unnecessary functions for me since I have my Playstation 3 console set-up anyways.-AutoMotion Plus (I felt that this function made some HD movies too smooth)Other features will be further tested and posted in the future.Overall, I am very pleased with this LCD television by Samsung and highly recommend it!Edit (6/5/11)Further Impressions:Played Enslaved Odyssey to the West (PS3) and made the following observations-Cinematics are vibrant; colors are vibrant-Settings were on SQ(movie) and PQ(dynamic). Forestry is lust (green colors and everything stands out). Music comes alive and the conversations between characters are clear and crisp-Some framerate issues and hiccups but this is most likely due to the game itself and not the TV", "Date": "June 30, 2011"}, {"Title": "120Hz brings new meaning to Hi Def", "Author": "JD", "ReviewID": "R1DPNZ69YE7R4Q", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I recently bought the Samsung LN40D630 as an upgrade from my Samsung LN32A550 and the difference in picture quality is obvious. I still love my 32' flat screen and it will be moved into my bedroom, but this TV is far superior. To really appreciate the TV's capacity you need to have a true Hi Def source like a blu ray player, Playstation 3, etc. Most cable companies are still broadcasting at 1080i and are not true Hi Def sources, although the D630 will make any source look a bit better with the Auto Motion Plus feature, which can be tweaked to your liking. It adds an extra image between frames to create a smooth and truly life like image. This may sound great and but it takes a bit of getting used to. I currently have it turned off because the image on the screen is almost too life like, and makes the movie or TV have a \"soap opera\" feel to it. Before you get any bad ideas about this feature, or the TV, it does have it's uses. This setting is great to use for fast action sports, or low def programs/channels. I tested in while playing a few different playstation games and although it really enhances the image and resolution it also creates lag while using the controller. For fast action games that require quick reflexes and little hesitation this feature will definitely work against you, and can be very annoying. In conclusion, it is a great feature to have, and you have to see it to completely understand it's impact and look. There is no doubt it has it's uses, but I wish there was a button on the remote that could allow you to quickly enable and disable it, instead of searching through the menu.I spent at least an hour recalibrating the TV for each source (cable, movie, playstation, etc) and this set does come fairly well calibrated out of the box. It will save your different picture settings for each source, so once you calibrate each source accordingly you won't have to mess with it. Most LCD and plasma TV's come calibrated in a \"Demo Mode\" to show off it's appearance next to it's competitors and to accomplish this they usually turn the backlight and brightness up way to high.  This will shorten the life of your TV and consume more power. Calibration depends on the viewing environment (light room with many windows or dark basement) and the viewers preferences, and this TV allows you to tweak everything including the Red Green Blue scale and many other standard and special effects. Some retailers recommend this be done by a professional (Geek squad) but you can also use a calibration disk. I simply consulted a trusted site for my tweaks (I posted them in this TV's customer forum) and I adjusted it to my liking and viewing environment. I recommend using \"Movie Mode\" over all others and go from there. I am still making fine adjustments here and there, and they can and should differ from source to source.The TV's sound is so so provided the speakers aren't even visible on this model. No problem, as I typically hook my sets to an audio receiver for better sound, although I did have to buy a $30 audio digital optical cable to hook up the TV to my home theater. Keep in mind it does not have a standard Left/Right audio out. If you plan on also using a home theater I recommend you rout all of the source's audio through the TV and not directly from each source to the amplifier or receiver. This could cause a delay or lag between the sound and the picture that is common to hi def sources. By routing all of your sources (hi or standard def) through the TV you avoid this problem and won't have to calibrate each source or your audio receiver to compensate for this delay.All in all this TV is definitely worth what Amazon is asking. It is not a 3D TV and is not on the cutting edge of new technology, but it offers excellent picture quality and is a trusted brand. I am not going to list and repeat every feature it has, as that is already listed on the product page. This is my second Samsung LCD TV and I would buy another if I needed it. Nowadays you have to be careful not to buy things before a new wave of technology comes, but there is no question that the TV's are more sophisticated than the sources (DVD's, cable, Netflix, etc). Although this set isn't 3D compatible, and may lack some features and performance of the newest models, it is a long way from being obsolete or outdated. To tell you the truth I honestly wouldn't want a higher quality image than what this TV offers because it takes away from the film, or program. I know everyone is pushing for realism and life like images but you have to draw a line. It feels like you are watching them film the movie (or a play) and not actually watching a movie. Maybe it is because I am used to that barrier between us that separates real life from fiction/entertainment and it takes some getting used to. I am not saying this TV lacks high def, actually it offers too much, although fortunately it can be turned off. Don't take my word for it, you really have to see it to believe it......", "Date": "July 17, 2011"}, {"Title": "Great TV, but light leaks from the bottom 2 corners", "Author": "Dave Stone", "ReviewID": "R1K0MC9C2VSD3C", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I bought this on a whim at a local big-box store after seeing true blacks beat the competing LG 47\" model. Everything about the TV is incredible, especially compared to the 32\" Toshiba LCD it replaced. The display settings are all adjustable, for example, \"Auto Motion Plus\" with 1-10 settings for both blur and judder reduction.It has a USB input on the recessed side and can play Divx AVI files, XVID, and a few video files types. If you're playing a movie file and stop it (accident or otherwise), the 'D button' on the remote will return you to the same spot. The player also has fast forward and rewind. Only minor complaints are the back-lit remote glows orange (cheap) and doesn't even light all of the buttons.The big problem I have is light leakage in the bottom two corners. On a black screen, you can see this as a flashlight effect pointing at 45 degrees to the middle. I can adjust the settings and come close to fix it, but on a dark movie like \"The Descent\" - it's still there. This is totally not acceptable, as I bought the TV primarily to watch movies. I'll probably return it in the next few days. Maybe for the same, or the LG 47\" model.

I was immediately disappointed with the Sony's motion blurriness. I could barely make out the numbers on the cars on the Sunday Nascar races. I hadn't done my homework before purchasing and just blindly purchased in the store, based on the nice bright Sony image. (there were no Samsungs there)I have since done my due diligence and studied up on what is what in the modern TV world, and I chose this model based on it being 120hz with a special motion feature, as well as reading all the user reviews.There is little doubt that this TV has the best picture for the money, amongst the 40 inchers.There are TV's in a similar price range that are packed with a ton of options and features, like 3D, LED backlit, Google TV, etc, but if you are simply looking for the best image for the price, this Samsung wins first prize.The image is so much better than my 60hz Sony, that I wonder why they even sell 60hz TV's.How could anyone tolerate images that go blurry every time there is motion.For me, it is completely unacceptable and my new Samsung is as good as I could hope it would be.I have never been a Samsung fan as they had a checkered past of low quality products.Clearly, times have changed and they now make a fantastic television. I highly recommend this unit to anyone who doesn't need more options or features that this one offers, as the picture is superb.On another note, it's a nice feature that it has a swivel base, backlit keys on the remote control, soft touch menu controls on the TV and the whole bezel is quite handsome too.", "Date": "August 11, 2011"}, {"Title": "A note about the \"soap opera effect\"", "Author": "Madmax", "ReviewID": "RA8GUWSNJ3GWG", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Hi folks. Others have described the many virtues of this tv, but thought it might be helpful to comment on the \"soap opera effect\" having recently encountered this problem myself. The solution for the soap opera effect is NOT simply turning off the Auto Motion Plus feature.  This is a commonly offered remedy I've seen online, but in my experience turning off AMP does little if anything to eliminate the problem. The solution is to use the \"custom\" settings for AMP. Set the \"judder\" setting to 0 or 1 and the \"blur\" setting to 8 or higher. Apply those settings anytime you see the soap opera effect. Works like a charm, at least to my eye. I'm actually quite surprised that solution isn't more widely communicated to LCD owners. I feel like I have the best of both worlds now -- the benefits of AMP for sports and fast action and little or no soap opera effect for other programming like movies or HD tv shows like Breaking Bad. Fair to say it's taken me from being a very unhappy customer thinking about buying a plasma to a very satsified one.  Happy viewing!", "Date": "October 7, 2011"}, {"Title": "A Realistic Review", "Author": "JJI", "ReviewID": "RI5EJAEUQVI8K", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "After 25 years with our old tube TV's, we decided it was time (probably past time!) for us to make the switch to a flat screen HDTV. As with many things these days, the shear number of choices is bewildering, and it's hard to figure out where to start the search. The internet is overflowing with reviews and recommendations, but you can easily get trapped in \"analysis paralysis\" with the amount of information that is available. Still, it was worth reading the reviews to see which TV's were considered worthwhile, and which weren't. The Samsung LCD HDTV's had high marks overall, as did a few other brands. Once we had some information to guide us, we set out to narrow down the choices.We spent about a year casually looking at HDTV's. We weren't in a rush to buy one, and we had a $1000 budget to adhere to. Whenever we made a trip to Sam's Club, Best Buy, etc., we would often do a quick view of the TV's on display, and one thing always stood out: the Samsungs had a picture that was always as good as any other brand, if not better, at least to our eyes. So we decided on finding the right Samsung for our situation. We planned on putting the TV in a small room, with our sofa approximately eight feet away. Due to the relatively close viewing distance and our price range, a 40\" or 46\" screen would fit the bill.When we first considered the Samsung 40\" LCD early in 2011, it was selling for $799 on Amazon and elsewhere. But then LED HDTV's were coming down in price as well, and we waited to see which would be the best play in the quality/value equation. With January and February traditionally being good months for a TV purchase, we decided to make our choice early in 2012. The LN40D630 had dropped in price to a wallet-friendly $649, and, since the comparable Samsung LED model was $200 more, we opted for the LCD HDTV. Additionally, since the thin design of flat screen TV's necessitates compromises in regards to speaker design and sound quality, we decided to pick up a Samsung HW-D450 AudioBar (a speaker bar with wireless subwoofer) for $249. The savings on the cost of the TV allowed us to purchase a Samsung BD-D5300 Blu-ray player as well.Why did we go with all Samsung products? Compatibility was the main reason, along with the need for fewer remotes. The TV remote can control the basic DVD functions - Play/Pause/Stop/FF/Rewind. The TV is connected to the sound bar with an optical cable, and the sound is great. Is it the best sound? Probably not. Is it as good as surround sound? No. Are we satisfied with the sound? Yes! It is a massive improvement over the TV speakers.When turned on, the Samsung Blu-ray player also automatically powers on the TV, which then automatically turns on the sound bar. Pushing one \"power on\" button instead of three is a nice feature.The LN40D630 has an outstanding picture. Whether watching broadcast HD signals or Blu-ray discs, the color, contrast, and resolution are fantastic. As for the much-maligned Auto Motion Plus (AMP)feature, there are times when it improves the picture dramatically, and times when it doesn't, just as with other manufacturers' motion-compensating features.If you don't like the \"Soap Opera Effect\" that AMP can give to film-based sources, simply turn it off, or set AMP to the \"Custom\" setting with Blur set to \"2\" and Judder set to \"4\". This will provide a more film-like image, instead of looking like live video.If you are watching a Blu-ray and noticing a lot of Judder (the jerky movement on the screen that is most visible when the camera is panning horizontally across the scene), we find it best to set AMP to the \"Clear\" setting or to \"Off\". When in the \"Off\" setting, people and objects that are moving will be less sharp, but we find this less distracting than the jerky movements caused by Judder.Regarding the complaints about power supplies and capacitors that go bad in a year or two, well, we suppose time will tell. At the time of purchase we did not opt for an extended warranty.To sum up, in our opinion the Samsung LN40D630 LCD HDTV is a great buy. Set up was easy, and 1080p resolution at 120Hz makes for a stunning picture. Does it have all of the latest bells and whistles? No. Is it the best LCD HDTV out there? Maybe not. But for $650 or less, the combination of features, value and stunning Samsung picture make for a great TV.We hope you find this review helpful!", "Date": "February 23, 2012"}, {"Title": "Superior picture quality and great sound to boot!", "Author": "Vicki VinHatton \"VV\"", "ReviewID": "R3ESSN15SU41NG", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "We moved from a 37\" Vizio to this 40\" Samsung in our living room. First, let me tell you that our living room is not like most. It's an absolutely terrible place to place audio or visual electronics. The room is part of an open layout... so, there are really only 2 walls, one covered in windows. The ceilings are high. And, the floors are hardwood. So, there is a ton of light and terrible sound absorbing qualities. Every TV we've had in this room has looked and especially sounded terrible... UNTIL THIS ONE. The only reason I purchased this TV was because I got it as a 'last model clearance' at my local SEARS store. It was $419 after tax... a smoking deal. But, let me tell you, I would've gladly paid twice that if I'd known how awesome it looks and sounds in our space. We had to use an ugly sound bar with our last TV and it still didn't sound great. The picture quality on this TV is unmatched. It's one of those TVs that has you staring at the blades of grass on the screen during a football game or gazing at the pores on the newscaster's face. It's pretty awesome. And, there are a lot of adjustments if you don't like some of the preset ones. The sound quality is just great in my opinion. No, this isn't a 'Smart TV'. But, for the price, you can't beat it. Also, you can get a wireless adapter to plug into one of the TV's USB ports so that you can access a/v files from your computer. Remote control layout is standard and the remote fits comfortably in my medium-sized female hands. The only thing I don't like about the TV is the brown stripe along the bottom edge. But, it's really no big deal and I don't notice it that much anymore.

Later on, a friend of hers gave her some tips on how to set-up the Emerson with various commands via the remote control.  Those tips really paid off and suddenly the previously lackluster picture became an beautiful picture, regardless of input.In the meantime, however, she asked me to help her find an HDTV that was of a higher quality, so I started doing my research, online.  My research lead me, basically, to Sony and Samsung.  I was looking at the Samsung LN40D550, which is 60Hz, and I thought it was going to be \"the one\". I compared it to a similar Sony, at Walmart, (Side-by-Side) and the Sony seemed to have a duller picture (which I later found out was completely due the user changeable settings on the TV, such as brightness, and color).  I brought her down to WM to see both TVs and she didn't like how both of them seemed blurry during sports action scenes, such as a football game.  Then, just by chance, she noticed another Samsung (the LN40D630) which had a 120Hz refresh rate... and that CHANGED EVERYTHING! She and I both noticed that the same sports scenes, which seemed blurry on the Sony and Samsung \"60Hz\" TVs, were almost perfectly clear on the \"120Hz\" Samsung LN40D630.  We both started honing-in on this TV as the best of the 40 inch TVs we'd seen (putting LED's aside).  The price was either $648 or $698 at WM... then I found the same TV at Amazon for $598.  Wow, a whole $50 to $100 savings... plus by not buying it locally, we didn't have to pay 6% State sales tax... and by using my Amazon Prime account, I could get free shipping or pay $4 to have it delivered \"next day\".In the end, we bought the Samsung LN40D630 through Amazon and had it delivered next day, and it arrived exactly when it was supposed to.  She loves this TV!  The picture is amazing!  The sound sounds exactly as it should (like a TV).  I've heard others complain about the sound on just about every HDTV out there, including this one, but in reality the sound is perfect, unless you are a spoiled Home Theater brat, in which case you need only connect your external sound system to the TV.Here are the facets which prompted my friend to buy this TV:High Resolution, Ultra Clear, PictureNo motion blurring during Fast Action (such as sports scenes)Swivel StandBacklit Remote ControlSamsung's quality reputation and Positive owner reviews of this TVand the old adage:  You Get What You Pay ForWords of Wisdom:Don't buy a TV, and then return it, until you have set it up properly.I bought a 42 inch Sharp HDTV once, and was ready to return it because I couldn't get it to turn on and show a picture.  The TV just had some default message displayed on the screen, but I couldn't get it to show any channels, and no DVD, and would display nothing when hooked to my computer.  I pressed every button on the remote (Including the Up, Down, and Side arrow Keys)and nothing would work. I was ready to pack it up and send it back to Dell when I decided to try the remote again, AND I FOUND A SINGLE BUTTON WHICH ESSENTIALLY brought the TV to life and allowed me to select an input.  I was thinking \"what f-ing idiots the Sharp engineers were to design a TV which, fresh out of the box, would seem defective to the average owner/user.And remember what I said about my friend buying the Emerson TV and was ready to take it back to WM and get her money back, because she thought the picture was of poor quality, when in fact, after she learned how to use the remote to give the TV the correct settings, the picture went from poor to fantastic (on regular Cable TV, HD Cable TV, and DVD).  By the way, although she bought the new Samsung LN40D630, she decided to keep the Emerson TV as a backup TV, which made me happy because I hate it when people buy stuff and then exploit the customer-friendly return policies of some merchants to return items simply because of a change of heart, impatience, or lack of common sense.", "Date": "July 27, 2011"}, {"Title": "NOT 120 Hz!

Now I looked all over the website and everything is in Clear Motion Rate and there isn't any hz anywhere. When I called Samsung and asked about it the operator said it was 120 hz, but when I talked to Bust Buy and Sears employees they said it's really a fancy 60 Hz.Samsung's website wont compare CMR to Hz at all, so I searched all over the place and the only thing I can find is info in forums and people are basically saying that the HZ is half what the CMR is.I don't like being deceived and I don't think I can buy a Samsung at all now.Samsung is Letting Amazon, Sears, Best Buy and everyone else say 120 Hz, but that's misleading, it's 120 Clear Motion Rate not Hz .I tried to leave a review on Samsung's website, but you had to log in and make an account, so there's no way to post an anonymous reviews.

That thing only lasted about 5 years before the picture started going bad. Black band across the bottom of the screen until it warmed up. Then on Friday it began having new problems with the picture after it warmed up...After four Sony turkeys in a row I have quit that brand. It's sad b/c I bought several high end Sony VCRs and TVs back in the 1990s. I just won't risk that kind of $$$ on that brand again. Before the TV 5-6 years ago I bought a ~$200 Sony DVD player that began randomly skipping even on new movie discs. It might skip from 3/4 of the way through the movie back to the beginning.By Saturday I had hunted for a Samsung with a 120HZ screen in the 40\"-ish range and found this TV. Previously for projects at work I had purchased a 37\" LG and a pair of 46\" Phillips TVs. One of the Phillips died (bad screen or bad backlight?) and it took 9 MONTHS for Phillips to fix it! I was told the company had been purchased by someone and there were problems with communications and procedures... No thanks. Not again. (several years later the TVs all work perfectly).Those projects helped me know what I valued in an LCD TV and which sizes. This fix the bill perfectly. We love it. Looks great. Plenty of connections. Competitive price. Seems as well done as the Samsung DVD player I purchased a year ago to replace the randomly skipping Sony DVD player. Our Samsung isn't even an expensive BluRay player. It is a progressive 1080p player that does a good job. Samsung DVD-1080P9 1080p Upconverting DVD PlayerThe menus are well thought out and very detailed. I lamented no bass/treble adjustments until last night when I found the equalizer. Down went the treble, up went the bass and now the sound is pretty good. Not great - it's just too high. The speakers are optimized for high frequency sounds. Likely very small speakers but they make plenty of noise and we can certainly hear everything clearly. I think a subwoofer is in order. I don't need bone shaking bass but just enough bass to offset the higher frequencies. Don't like the smooth video? You cna adjust that or turn it off entirely. Want to save power? You can adjust that too. I've tinkered with everything to fine tune it just the way I liked for a week. It looks great. By default it seemed too dim and colorless. Tune up the adjustments a little and it looks spectacular.We don't subscribe to satellite anymore and not cable for 15 years (too expensive). We instead run DVDs through this TV and a ROKU. Even the ROKU's picture for Hulu, Netflix and some of the news shows look good despite DSL internet speeds. Our Roku is an HD version and we are using an HDMI cable. Looks much better than the RCA cables. Not perfect of course b/c of the slow internet. Wish we had faster DSL but I'm too cheap for that. ;) If you have trouble with the Roku locking up try moving it away from the TV. We were having troubles with that occasionally watching Hulu and this mostly fixed that. Netflix and Amazon never have that problem. I just slid the Roku box forward about 12\" and eventually will relocate it away from the TV to some part of the entertainment center below. My theory is that the Roku and the high frequency inverter for the backlight might be interacting in some negative way.

The size and model were our best guess after researching for a year and more, and we got a lot more than we expected!We live in the country where there's no cable and one clear antenna channel (NBC) -- but that channel is superb. Everything we've watched was clear and smooth and the colors seem completely natural.We were worried about getting a too-big screen for our small living room but it turns out to be pretty much a non-issue. The terrific quality of the picture and lack of flicker make it easy to watch from a big range of distances. The oldest poorest quality movies (such as the unreconstructed ancient film reels in the  Horror Classics 50 Movie Pack Collection and the Mystery Classics 50 Movie Pack Collection) are much easier to watch -- clearer and less flicker, somehow-- and the difference between this monitor and the old one still startles us when we watch a new DVD episode of a series we've been getting for a long time (Midsomer Murders, Foyle's War). The daylight colors are more natural and the cameramen's genius with light and shadow really shines in indoor and twilight scenes.Everything loads fast (the TV stays on standby when \"off\")-- the screen is on with the last channel up immediately, or the DVD if there's one in the player. I haven't found the menus to be at all hard to work with (but haven't tried to do anything very complex with them so far).There are no buttons to press on the TV itself -- instead the bottom frame is sort of a power strip with almost invisible touch-sensitive areas, kind of like the touch-wheel on a classic iPod. (The Samsung DVD player is the same). This is a bit disconcerting until your finger knows where to touch and slide, but like most people we use the remote anyway, and I like it because buttons tend to get pressed so hard they fail around here. The remote is the most sensibly arranged and designed of any I've had, and it controls the new Samsung BD-D5300 Blu-ray Disc Player (Black) [2011 MODEL] player (from Amazon) to some extent also. The remote does seem to need to be pointed right at the sensing area on the TV, not just waved in the general direction like other remotes we've had.The screen's semi-matte surface is just right for our room -- reflections from lamps or windows are far less of a problem than with the previous TV's \"non-reflecting\" screen. And -- a small miracle-- the screen hasn't attracted one single dust mote.

When I first hooked it up I wasn't that impressed, but that was due to my own stupidity. I didn't realize that you have to have your cable box upgraded to HD.. DOH!... One call to Charter and I had a installer out in 48 hours with the new box and instructions... In a word... I'm shocked at how good the picture is and 100% happy I chose the Samsung brand and  46\" size TV.. Many had advised..\"Go larger than you think you need.\" I did NOT take their advice.. I chose the 46 because I did NOT want a TV that would dominate the room or my field of vision.. The size is perfect, IMHO. I would NOT want any larger.. at least in the room it's located... about 12 x 20'Picture quality is so good that I find myself watching movies that I've seen dozens of times and they look completely different..

The quality of a Samsung over its competitors is well worth the few extra dollars you might spend over the other brands on the market.See, that wasn't so bad, was it. Now for the rest of us who have more time than money. In my shopping for my first HDTV, I found that the only other brand to equal Samsung's quality is Sony; and their prices run higher than Samsung, but I could not discern any difference in picture to my eyes. One more thing while on the subject of brand. Even though this is my first Samsung TV, it is not my first Samsung product. I am familiar with Samsung's quality through its line of computer related products.The features on this TV will keep anyone busy discovering for years. I especially like how with a couple of clicks on my remote I can let the amount of light in my living room dictate the type of picture that is best. This remote can do anything except go into the kitchen and fix me a cup of coffee. You will discover that you and Samsung's remote will be getting very close.Two things (yes, only two) rather disappoint me: the quality of sound coming from those teeny-weeny speakers, and the weight of this TV (my gosh, it gave me a hernia!). I believe that when I can afford it, I will get a couple of $90 Bose (just right for my apartment) and solve the sound deficiency. As far as the weight problem, it is staying right where it is until I move.All in all, I am very pleased with this 40\" as it fits my small apartment very well.", "Date": "February 5, 2012"}, {"Title": "Happy TV Watcher", "Author": "the_bake", "ReviewID": "R3F4JXG5J7GGX9", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Put off buying a high definition flat screen TV until January of 2012.

McEwan \"yellokat\"", "ReviewID": "R2MCLNUZC9HG8S", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I bought this Samsung TV from Amazon after comparing it with a bunch of others at a local Target. The price was better here and I could have it delivered at no additional cost with my Prime membership. After using it at least once a day for the past 4 months, I feel that I now have enough experience with this television to write a fair review.The TV is easy to set up and the directions are simple to follow. The set slides on to its pedestal stand and after I tightened a couple of supplied screws I was ready to go. The TV remote has decent sized buttons and good labels, so it's easy to see which buttons operate which functions. Samsung makes much of a bronze colored rim on the bottom of the LCD frame, marketing it as \"a touch of color.\" I couldn't care less, one way or the other. I'm fine with the accent color and would also be fine without it. Overall, the picture is excellent, which is what matters to my family and me.We have one complaint with this television: It doesn't interface well with our cable remote, which we have to use to operate the set when it's hooked up to the cable box. I have checked several times to ensure that the remote is properly programmed, which it is, and also played around with the interior settings on both the TV and the cable box. Still, the set does not turn off when the off switch is pressed on the cable remote. You have to hit the 'system off' button to cut power to the cable box, then hit a different 'power off' button on the cable remote in order to turn off the television. It's a hassle.Also, this set does not work with the remote from our new SONY blu-ray player, even though that is also programmed properly. Same thing -- the blu-ray remote will turn on both the player and the TV, as well as tune the television to the correct source for viewing the blu-ray. But when it's time to turn the blu-ray and the TV off for the night, the latter will not disconnect, nor will it return to the primary source channel so it's ready to receive the usual cable signal the next time the unit is turned on. Instead, we have to turn off the blu-ray player, then use the TV's own dedicated remote to tune it to the primary source and also turn the TV off. Again, it's a hassle.Overall, this is a good television for the money and it most definitely delivers a sharper picture and better color than does a similar LG model I purchased for my sister.

How is anyone going to glean information that makes any sense, if your not reviewing the right product?Another gripe refers to those people that buy something that may be considered a big ticket item, but then expect miracles from online shopping for the \"best\" deal and then not spending a few extra dollars on an extended warranty to protect your investment. There aren't many people that can afford a $700+ mistake, so why not protect yourself from that. Please also remember that you should shop at a reputable establishment. Nothing against Amazon here, but how many of you know anything about the business that actually stocks and ships the product to you?", "Date": "January 15, 2012"}, {"Title": "Excellent TV", "Author": "J. Cooper", "ReviewID": "RCY2MIM8VT482", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Before purchasing this TV I bought a 51\" plasma (samsung PN51D530).  What can I say, the extra few inches enticed me.  Took the TV home and the glare was too much (plasma's have a REAL glass front).  So I took the plasma back and bought this TV.  In comparison this TV is absolutely great!  Way better than the plasma, better picture, better colors, brighter, etc.  It even has deeper blacks (this is one area where plasmas are actually supposed to be superior).  I love this TV and the extra few inches that are gone are not that noticeable.", "Date": "August 8, 2011"}, {"Title": "OK TV", "Author": "Mr Podman", "ReviewID": "R2SNA6ZWOCEWH1", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "It is a nice TV.  The picture quality out of the box is stunning when it is on a TV channel that is broadcasting a high quality HD signal.So why only 3 stars from me?1) Cost.  TV's like this one cost about twice as much as they should (compared to the last TV you bought).  Based on cost, they're all a 3/5 in my book.2) Setup.  The TV I bought had trouble initially detecting the TV cable signal during \"Plug & Play\" start up.  The cable signal worked perfectly on my old TV and on a smaller Samsung I own.  It worked eventually.  When I Googled \"Samsung Weak Cable Signal\" there was no shortage of items available for viewing.3) Sound Quality.  Sound quality is very basic and unimpressive.  As picture quality on all TV's has improved significantly over the years, sound quality hasn't.4) Features.  One feature of this TV is a scanning function of the ambient light in the room.  The problem is, that \"feature\" blocks the signal from the remote control for my BOSE system.  This means that every time I turn on my TV I have to use one remote for channel changing and a different remote for volume control for about the first 5-10 minutes.  I'm unable to completely disable that function on the TV and so will have to live with it.  Not good.5) WiFi Capability.  For about $50-$60 you can buy a Samsung dongle and plug it in to this TV making it accessible on your home wifi network.  I did so and can tell you it works.  The problem is that there is no benefit in doing so.  Save your money.  If you want to see your kids pictures on the TV you can use a USB drive.  If you want to watch movies from Netflix etc, the Samsung dongle won't do it for you.  I returned the dongle and bought an Apple TV puck.  Very nice.6) Documentation.  When I was trying to get the wifi dongle to work the TV manual explained I needed to download \"PC Share Manager\" software from the Samsung website.  A trip to their website yielded a completely different software download called \"AllShare\".  I presume it is a renamed update for the software but am not sure.  I ended up not installing either.7) Software.  There are a few annoying things.  For example, I have my Apple TV plugged into HDMI port 1.  On the menu screen showing sources I wish it could set it up to say \"Apple TV\" so that members of my family don't have to remember that I happened to plug it in to port 1.Bottom Line:Nice basic modern TV. Stunning picture quality. Lousy sound quality. Has features that may get in the way of working seamlessly with my Bose surround sound system.  Should cost about half of what it does (as should they all).", "Date": "September 13, 2011"}, {"Title": "Fantastic Design", "Author": "Kathryn Peer", "ReviewID": "R3J0UDDRBAT8K9", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Fantastic Design, ultra sharp picture, reasonable price, but for sound use an external sounds system.I also like the innovative usability options.Perfect picture, perfect Design -> I am very satisfied!", "Date": "July 25, 2012"}, {"Title": "LN46D630 - Really...it's a good TV,", "Author": "Kagoshiman", "ReviewID": "R1PAKN1GS6HU5F", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Updating - 2/1/12:Need to provide an update in order to remain honest and consistent with my review. I returned the LN46D630 for a 51\" plasma, the Samsung PN51D550C1. Did so primarily to get a larger screen, but also I fortunately was able finally able to see the difference between LCD and plasma. I mean I knew the difference but a little viewing of the latest Tron movie sold me on plasma. I realized that I liked the plasma better for its richer, smother colors...creamier is what I call it.I always debated the difference between LCD and Plasma, orginally deciding on the favorable brightness quality and minimal abmient light reflection with LCD. I still think the LN46D630 provides very good picture quality, but I think I just love the creamier warmth of the plasma. Now, there is the one thing I am still not 100% satisfied with on the new plasma, and that is the bright vividness of whites. The LN46d630 produces the bright colors perfectly. The PN51D550C1 does not. I am a bit bothered by this even though the rest of my household is not. I might need to find another plasma model. The search for complete (bdugeted) happiness continues for me.Anyway, if you decide you like vividness over warmth and richness then I still highly recommend the LN46D630. Enjoy!(I'll review the PN51D550C1 shortly.)*****Original Review:DGiving it 4 stars ... Why? Because nothing is perfect and I'm sure I could complain about something if I thought long about it.Why 4 stars? The picture is awesome. Awesome compared to the top $$ plasma or 4 color LED, perfectly calibrated to -nth degree by really, really sharp guys? Probably not. But it is really good. I mean, I looked at every TV in the price range I wanted to spend, back and forth between plasma and LCD, Sony/LG/Sharp/Panasonic, 60hz to 120hz ... looked at 1080p and 720p. Keep coming back to the LN46D30 because of it's crystal clarity and bright, vivid colors. That's what I wanted. That's what I got.My second choice was going to be a Panasonic TC-P50S30. The images on that TV was just a little richer, you could tell. Again, the deciding factor was that I couldn't get the brightness I sometimes want or need from the plasma. But you can \"tone down\" the brightness of the Samsung and still get a really good picture, really nice colors. Liked the Samsung over the LG because clarity seemed a little better. We mostly watch cable, have a xbox 360 for games and netflix, and also have an 1st gen. Apple TV. We're not invested in super video this-n-that. Good sports. Good movies. And some games for the kids. But, still, we want good clarity and realistic colors. Super important! Got that with this TV.The Samsung wasn't too difficult to set up. After a few minutes of maneuvering through the nicely intuitive menu we could watch some pretty good TV. But, you'll inevitably will tweak the brightness, contracts, color levels, etc. to ensure you're getting the best picture possible out of this thing. Have fun with that. I mean it. Have some fun.The sound isn't going to be full and rich like we all used to get from pricey TVs, but I was expecting that; we've all read that this thin panels don't produce great sound, right? So I hooked up a my Denon stereo to the TV and my sound problem was solved. You should plan to invest in some a sound bar or something when buying a new panel HDTV.Haven't notice the reputed light leakage. No lag or motion blur. Nope, none of that. Honestly, some of these reviews are just too much. \"Horrible this\". \"Awful that\". \"Can't get my black and black as ...\" - fill in the blank. My advise for purchasing a new HDTV is know your budget and the size you're looking for. Trust the big guys to put a decent, quality TV out there, get extended warranty, and then let your eyes and preference decide. Yeah, check out to see if the model you're interested in is some a a clunker somehow. I spent some time just looking between all those that fit the profile and decided based on what I liked, not because some guy got a dented box and the picture didn't live up to his Sony Triniton from way back when. I went to the store a couple times before deciding, just because I wanted to be sure and I like doing that kind of stuff. Drooled for all the stuff I wasn't prepared to pay for. Then I got real with it...I made my choice. Got the LN46D30. Very happy I did.Watch the setup display tricks at the store though; what do they say now, the \"big box\" places--geez! I think Best Buy (etc.) will set up a model with 120hz a little cleaner than the 60hz. 'Tell you 720p for a 42\" plasma is not as good as 1080p. A little extra beans for them when you get the 120hz. Funny...I bought a 120z model, ya know. Silly me. Just had to have it.Anyway. Go ahead. Check out this model. It's a really good TV. You'll get what you paid for.

The wireless connection isn't greatly dependable.  It can go out sometimes just maneuvering through your shared file systems, or while streaming a media file.

Samsung is a great company and is quickly taking over the media hardware/home entertainment market.  And with products like these, I can see why.

It was the best \"40 LCD on the floor, not a 3D or smart tv, but would serve well. It was easy to set it up with Comcast. The image was crisp and not a problem within the 1 year warranty. Then double images and multiple horizontal lines showed up right after 16 months of use. I called Samsung 3 times, asked to speak to a supervisor, only to be told I was out of warranty and there was nothing they could do. I emailed with video of the problem to their complains dept. and never even heard anything from them.I then decided to try to fix it myself. Read every possible solution at almost every forum, but no success. I finally called a repair technician and had it diagnosed. The tech said the tconn board along with the screen needs replacement. Repair cost is at least $500.00 Worth it? The tech said no. I would buy a new for my mom, but working a 30hr part time at a min. wage is impossible. I did not expected the LCD to last 10 years, but not only a year and 4 months. My old Sony tube 20\" inch tv is still working strong after 13 years of daily use and never a repair.", "Date": "August 24, 2013"}, {"Title": "I am so happy", "Author": "Odette M.

It arrived on time, and I've been happy so far with it's condition & performance.  It's not clear if & how I can watch Netflix, etc. on this, or if I need a roku or the like, but I'm not too technically savvy.  It has great options and features, noticeably better sound, and a great image.  The screen sizing's a bit odd - you either watch it as 4:3 (smaller screen than it needs to be), wide screen where everyone's wider than they really are, or a larger screen where you can't see the top and bottom of the intended images...  Why someone didn't add good old full screen to the viewing options is beyond me.  Small complaints aside, it's a great TV for the price.", "Date": "July 25, 2013"}, {"Title": "You get what you pay for and maybe a little more...", "Author": "Jennifer D. Sullins", "ReviewID": "R16WLOMIW4JAOL", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I purchased this TV (46\") from a local retailer in my area back in Sept.'12 and can't say enough good things about the picture quality.  I use Standard Picture Setting, Dynamic was too white-washed and faces looked terrible.  Standard is the best, IMO.  I found a few stuck pixels and one dead pixel.  Samsung, and most TV Companies, won't replace or do any repair work on stuck/dead pixels unless there are a cluster of 7 or 8 in a localized area of the screen so I didn't worry about it.  Also, since I can't see any of 'em, unless I'm a few inches from the screen, it doesn't take away from the PQ.  I've read through a lot of the reviews here on Amazon complaining about the PQ and I believe the one's complaining got a different panel version.  The correct, or good \"Samsung Panel\" for this model is SQ01 or SQ02.  Excellent PQ and solid viewing angle but does have minor flashlighting in bottom two corners.  The other panel is, I believe, a 3rd party panel that has better screen uniformity but horrendous viewing angles and bad PQ.  It's a trade-off and I for one would much rather have the best PQ.  Sound is actually not bad on this set.  Plenty of HDMI Ports, stand was easy to install, and it swivels.  As expected from a 1080p TV, Video Games and Blu-Ray Movies look great.  Motion Resolution is really bad.  The Clear Setting on Auto Motion Plus, is the best setting.  Off, Standard, or Smooth induces terrible juddering/stutter.  Most Samsung TVs, even the ES8000, have Motion Resolution problems.  Clear produces the best, seamless, judder-free viewing experience without soap opera effect.  This TV does have some pretty bad banding, probably one of worst I've ever seen.  It's only evident when LIMITED is activated on PS3.  I've only seen it on Cable/Satellite signals about 5% of the time, depending on what channel is on but it's mostly SD Channels.  Black levels are ok but a little grey at times.  Screen is matte but if you have a lot of windows good luck because it doesn't take away from the glare very well.  Overall, if you're looking for a good set for your living room or bedroom it's a great TV.  It sucks it doesn't go up to 50 or 55\" though.

I am not sure if that is the channel itself, or the TV adjusting non-1080p video.  I had 720p Samsung DLP TV before this and that never happened.- The built-in media browser for locating and playing files on a home media server (via the TVs network connection) is incredibly slow and strangely laid out - it gives you standard folders/directories regardless of what folders you have at the top level (when you first access the media server).

Thompson", "ReviewID": "R150N4SLFI54RG", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "First off, just to clear all of the confusion, this tv is NOT 120hz, BUT it performs as well or better in the motion blur department compared to actual 120hz televisions. I got this TV after returning the LG 40LV4400. The LG's black weren't very dark although it was an LED, and it's motion blur function wasn't very effective at all even though it was supposedly 120hz.BLACKS/COLORS:Although this TV does a lot of things well, the color is the best. Everything looks very lifelike with no colors overpowering others. The blacks are as black as you could reasonably expect from an LCD. There is some clouding, or decrease in contrast when viewing from off angles, but nothing outside of what's the norm for an LCD. I am not getting any light bleed from the corners. If you stand or sit to close though, the edges of the screen may be at an increased angle, and you may start to get light bleed. But if you're sitting a reasonable distance from the tv, you shouldn't see that.Protip-Do not set blacks to \"dark\", darker, or darkest, you'll lose detail. Also, lower the black level (brightness) by only a notch or two, and lower the backlight to get darker blacks.MOTION:Although this TV is technically a 60hz television, it's motion blur feature works as well as 120hz televisions. I don't care what the box says, only how it performs.Pro tip-I use settings of 2 for motion blur and dejudder when playing movies/television, and 8 and 8 for when playing video games. You don't want the soap opera effect when playing movies. And you don't want to have the processing to high when playing video games which supposedly reduces the television's response time.OTHER FEATURES:One of the best things about this tv is it's ability to play video off of a usb connected device. I have my 500gb external hard drive hooked up via usb and I can play my 1080p .mkv files on the TV without the need to connect my computer or use a dvd player that has a usb media player function.Pro tip- hit the tools button rather than the usual \"menu\" button to adjust video settings when using the usb media player function.", "Date": "June 20, 2012"}, {"Title": "Best Bang for Your Buck!", "Author": "F.

One input source (AV1) is a dual component/composite jack where you can either plug in the old SD yellow RCA plug or the new set of 3 jacks for HD sources.  The composite/SD/yellow plug works, but using them as HD inputs does not.  Another input source is exclusively component and it just doesn't work at all.What that means is that the source is disabled in the source list menu and cannot be enabled.  You can refresh the list and they won't enable, and you can explicitly attempt to use one of those sources and you'll be told there's no signal.  You can use AV1 with the old yellow SD cable, yank them out and swap to a composite video source and it still won't work.I have attempted to use these two devices on another HD set and they work just fine.  I even used the same cables that I used on the Samsung so this is not user error, device error, or wire error.  The set just doesn't seem to understand that it's being fed a signal when it comes through these composite video jacks.The device is out of warranty and so I am out of luck.  It just took me this long before I really had a need for these inputs because I prefer HDMI, and those work just fine on this set.I've owned 3 technologically advanced Samsung devices in the last two years and all three of them have needed repair and contained shoddy embedded software.  I'm going to try a firmware update on the set to see if that resolves anything, but if this TV is like my Samsung bluray (which is currently on its second trip to NJ for repair) or my Samsung Instinct phone (the most awful device I've ever owned) then I will not hold out any hope that these glitches are fixed.", "Date": "June 25, 2011"}, {"Title": "Samsung LCD", "Author": "TimH", "ReviewID": "R3V8R6EKKHFFRR", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "After a month of looking at and reading about LCD TVs, we chose the Samsung LN46D630.
