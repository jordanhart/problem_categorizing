{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Excelent HDTV for the Price!!", "Author": "C. Gimpel \"viper\"", "ReviewID": "R2LN7VK1B59NWL", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I've had this TV for about a month and I'm quite impressed with the image quality running from a HD source.  The problem is that if you don't have a HD source like cable (Direct TV) or a DVD with HDMI or SVideo connected to it.... then you'll get the normal video source which can be a let down if your video signal is not OK.  The main issue here is that there's people that still think that because this TV is HDTV capable, that then it'll improve the image source one already has and this is definitelly not the case. And here's where buyers should be carefull since the electronic shops which carry HDTV units have them hooked up to HD TV signals and that's when people get convinced that they need one of these. Now if you're going to hook it up to a Home Theater then this is a very good choice for the value and the features given.If you happen to own an Xbox 360 (which I hopefully will one day, now I've got the first Xbox), then the image should be impressive.  I've already hooked this unit to my Xbox and a Toshiba RD-XS52 DVD Player/Recorder and with something like this you definitely take advantage of the features the n3260w has. The  RD-XS52 comes with HDMI cable and setting of up to 1080p resolution and with it, you really start to notice the difference between a good video signal and a poor one.The n3260w's colors are very crisp though you need to do some tweaking like other reviewers have explained and the menu for the TV is not the best one out there, I'm still having trouble with the PiP.These cons put aside.... this unit is definitely worth the money and should be wall mounted since it really looks nice that way.  The wall mount kit is a very solid one and I would say it guarantees your TV won't fall of the wall if it is mouted correctly due to the materials from which it has been made.I would've given the TV a 5 star review but I'm still working on the PiP configuration and have struggled with the menu but other than that I definitely recommend this purchase.", "Date": "June 5, 2006"}, {"Title": "Excelllent TV and Excellent Value", "Author": "Brad M. Cassagne \"Computer Buff\"", "ReviewID": "R2GVE5XW0BFOS7", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This TV has several nice improvements over last year's model (I have one of each).  The menu's are nicer and easier to navigate.  The controls for volume and channel are now on the lower right which makes them easy to reach for a wall mount.The mounting bracket is now centered like most flat panels.  There are 2 component video inputs now that can be used for HD or SD signals.  The picture and sound quality are quite good also.The only complaint I have is that the native resolution is not 1280x720.  The upconverting to 1366x768 cause some quality loss which is impossible to avoid on flat panels.  You can run the video at 1:1 sampling but then you get the black border and a 30\" tv for the price of a 32\".  The loss of quality is rarely noticable and is never obvious.  I forgot about this issue very quickly.  I've had this TV in my garage for a month and so far the humidity has not been a problem.", "Date": "May 9, 2006"}, {"Title": "REMOTE TRICK:", "Author": "L. Liu", "ReviewID": "R1N3QENN5JCBS0", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "REMOTE TRICK:Own the monitor for over 3 and half  years now, love it, no problem at all.  Initially lot of problems with remote just like everyone else is experiencing. I called customer service many times and nobody seemed to know what's going on. They just sent me a replacement  remote.(which had same issue)  But after years of use,  I got it figured out....so I thought I should share it for those who still doesn't have a clue what's wrong with their remote.If the remote is not working for you. What you need to do is PRESS THE \"TV\" BOTTON on the top left corner.  And then everything else should be working again.What happened is that the remote come with your Viewsonic is actually a universal remote.  So if you accidentally pressed DVD or something else on the top.  You are switch the remote to a different mode.  You must switch it back to TV mode to control the TV and voice and everything else.Hope this helps.", "Date": "August 5, 2009"}, {"Title": "Good monitor, until they start dropping like flies", "Author": "IceOnFire", "ReviewID": "R3851PNHGUB46Y", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "We ordered 3 monitors, wall mounted them in a hospital, they are setup to run 24/7.  Long story short, after a year and a half, all 3 died within 2 weeks of each other.  Viewsonic wouldn't do anything about it, since its only a 1 yr warranty.  Safe to say, we will never buy from Viewsonic again.", "Date": "June 5, 2008"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "Unavailable", "Features": "32 color TFT active matrix LCD screen\nResolution - 1366 x 768\nContrast Ratio - 800 - 1\nResponse Time - 8ms\nBrightness - 500 cdm2", "Name": "Viewsonic N3260w 32-Inch LCD HDTV", "ImgURL": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51aP7mNtd3L._SY300_.jpg", "ProductID": "B000E3BV3S"}}
