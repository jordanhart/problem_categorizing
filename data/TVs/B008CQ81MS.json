He loves it! It is a nice size for his room. It looks and feels like a real basketball! The sound is great, it has a good picture and the price was right. It can be placed on a table top or mounted on the wall! I would recommend this for any basketball fan. We have only had it for a couple of weeks so I do not know how it will rate long term, but I am very pleased with it initially!", "Date": "January 8, 2013"}, {"Title": "Awesome looking", "Author": "BUGMAN", "ReviewID": "RS0Y3XSIOLRNN", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This is a great product.

Seems to be just fine for now. No one around us have one. My major complaint is the set I got was Manufactured in \"JANUARY 2011\". I contacted support and said they would send me another set that was \"newer\". The second one arrived and it also was manufactured in :JANUARY 2011\". Sent the second set back as the first one was already in place.If support team new this ahead of time it could have saved me much time and hassle waiting for and returning the second set, as well as saving AMAZON the expense of shipping twice. AMAZON should state that these are older production run items in the discription so everyone will know beforehand exactly what they are purchasing.", "Date": "March 14, 2013"}, {"Title": "Very disappointed", "Author": "Unknown", "ReviewID": "RR8ZBJKMWEQ9V", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "Initially my son loved this tv as it looks and feels like a real basketball. After less than three months of use however, the television completely stopped working! No picture. Nothing. We called to find out what our recourse would be and were told that we need to not only wait for emails, print copies of the emails and fill out the forms, but then we need to find a box large enough and pack the tv using specific instructions given by the seller. We have not found a box to fit and needless to say the television still sits,  unusable . The forms we printed are now expired so we need to go through the whioe phone call, waiting for email process again once we find a box! So,not worth it!  Don't waste your money on this television,", "Date": "November 30, 2013"}, {"Title": "Excellent condition", "Author": "Suzanne Hayden", "ReviewID": "R319RG37HWYIRC", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "What more could a dad want on Father's Day?
