{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Specifications schmezifications...", "Author": "Rick V \"Bargain hunter by day, shopaholic at ...", "ReviewID": "R52LY7FMWP4W8", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "BackgroundWe decided a while ago that we wanted to upgrade all tube TV's in our household with decent wall mounted HDTV's. So we started of researching and initially bought the Samsung LNT series. This HDTV @ 1080P had a great price point for the specifications listed (contrast, resolution, available ports).The second brand we bought was the Sharp, more specific the aquos series. Again, very similar to the Samsung although a bit more pricy and not necessarily as nice looking.We then ordered a Marantz from the Philips outlet and boy was that a pice of junk. Cheap but it had sever ghosting and was impossible to use. That one moved to the family room.Finally we needed the 4th TV and wanted it for the kids' XBOX 360 and PS3 experience in their gameroom. When checking over Thanksgiving we wanted to get another Samsung as that was the best one in our experience but no good deals were out there and most that had them were out of stock on the reasonable deals.So we ran into the Toshiba 40RV525U as the cheapest 1080P 40\" HDTV with (supposedly) a fast screen rate for gaming.About the 40RV525UFirst of all this is NOT a REGZA from Toshiba, which is more high end than this item. However, this TV does look good with its black piano laquered front bezel (although it is not as shiny as the Samsungs but less wobbly in its reflection, so it is equal in aesthetics).It comes with 3 HDMI ports. Very important for the furture as the switch boxes are trouble in our experience.What we noticed MOST during the reasearch into this item is that Toshiba is not very forthcoming with specs other than Gamer Mode being great for next gen console requirements, 1080P and the number of HDMI ports. Even downloading the manual for spec sheets gives you nothing on contrast or the milliseconds is requires.We took the gamble since the item was hundreds cheaper than the next best thing and are VERY happy with it. The contrast ratio is not as good as a Samsung since you need to put the contrast and brightness up a bit but there is no ghosting or fuzziness when playing XBOX or PS3. We have noticed the same issue another reviewer had: the XBOX does not produce sound when connected via HDMI but this is a known XBOX 360 NXE issue and not a Toshiba one. The component cable connection is great and the screen looks wonderfully crisp.Another few comments: the side buttons are very plasticky but luckily hidden. The remote is simple and effective (not a button laden brick) and most of the interface is VERY simple to navigate through. Make sure you switch the gamer mode on as it is of by default. It does make a visible difference.Pros:Great piece of technology at 1080P for a very low pricepoint3 HDMIPlenty of other connectionsGamer modeLooks very sleek and expensiveConsLittle heavy compared to  Sharp and SamsungLack of information on contrast ratio and other key specs (but it is excellent in what it delivers so not really a ding)Wallmount screws are placed relatively far aparts so if you want to adjust screen horizontally you will need to buy a wide mount. Samsung has the mount holes really close together, as a contrast.", "Date": "December 17, 2008"}, {"Title": "Great buy", "Author": "Arvind Somya \"Tangled Wires\"", "ReviewID": "R3XNOAFWZ3F8D", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "This is my first HDTV, got it for $679 + tax from Amazon over thanksgiving.Initially I was a little skeptical because of the low price tag and lack of reviews but I decided to take the plunge and buy it coz Toshiba is an old and reputed brand.Pros:- The picture quality is simply amazing on this TV. Blacks are pitch black and the colors are sharp.- Blu ray DVD's are crystal clear at 1080p.- Response time, while not great has not been a hindrance in gaming so far (GTA IV and LittleBigPlanet on PS3)- It was extremely easy to set up. Remove packaging, screw in stand, plug power and you're good to go.- Lots of HDMI inputs (3). I have a PS3 and an upconverting DVD player plugged to two slots. will be plugging in my desktop to the third one once I get my DVI-HDMI cable.- PC VGA input with stereo sound jack, makes it easy to plug in laptops.- Sleek stylish looks.- Remote buttons glow faintly in the dark :)Cons:- A little on the heavy side compared to the newer flat screens, It weighed around 50lbs+, I was able to lift it alone onto a VESA mount around 4.5ft in height but I lift weights.- The picture is a little too dark, I've been fiddling with the picture settings but I haven't been able to get a perfect balance of light and dark.Had to turn up the brightness considerably while watching some dark movies like Underworld.- Mediocre sound, would recommend investing in a surround sound system.- PC VGA input doesn't go beyond 1368x768, haven't tried a dvi to hdmi yet.- Screen is a little reflective, tubelights especially messed up the picture completely.Overall I'm extremely satisfied with this purchase, can't beat the features at this price for a 1080p.", "Date": "December 12, 2008"}, {"Title": "Fabulous value", "Author": "Pete Brown", "ReviewID": "R3M1GRMY4ZK3X6", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I bought this TV for our bedroom two weeks ago based on the price and the positive reviews I read about it. I was a little skeptical that such a low-priced LCD could provide the kind of quality I was looking for but this is the real deal. The picture is bright and crisp even using the component cables I'm stuck with until my new HDMIs arrive.

It fits perfectly in our living room. The tv has excellent 1080p resolution. That coupled with the deep blacks and quick response time makes my 360 look spectacular. The game mode does seem to improve my gaming experience as well. For the price, this tv really cannot be beat. I've seen other reviews discussing that the sound and 60 hz response time are downfalls...First of all, the 60 hz is perfectly fine unless you're a videophile. It's hardly noticeable to most - and as for the sound - it is RARE that tvs put out great sound. The sound is fine. It sounds like a tv. The only genuine negative mark I can find with it to this point is that the remote really needs to be pointed right at the sensor to function properly which is a little annoying. Still, this is a GREAT value. If you're on the fence, allow me to shove you over...get this set!!! Great job, Toshiba.", "Date": "December 31, 2008"}, {"Title": "Very Pleased!", "Author": "D.

I am happy overall with the purchase.There are a couple things that stand out as being a bit less then expected. The sounds can be a bit flat and off with a slight echo. I don't really notice unless I am playing music through the TV. I plan on remedying this by getting a decent surround sound system.The video also can be a bit tricky if you are switching types of input. I have an HD box from Time Warner that will switch outputs depending on the channel. Some are 480i, some are 720p, and some are 1080i. The TV can be slow to switch when it changes and sometimes it is faster and easier to turn the TV off and back on to get the signal synced with the source. I've noticed the same thing with the PC being connected to the TV when switching display modes. Both are connected to the HDMI inputs.Overall the price and display make these just minor nuisances. I saw this same set in the local Best Buy and compared to similar sizes this set's picture is much sharper, clearer, and has better blacks. I'm glad I got it.", "Date": "December 18, 2008"}, {"Title": "Great tuner, great picture, very good gaming, so so remote.", "Author": "Toophless", "ReviewID": "R2F9EGMB1JV94Y", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Although I actually have the Costco version 40RV52U. They seem to be the same model.Tuner: I'm very pleased to find that the tuner can bring in several digital HD channels off of my very basic ($[...] / month for 13 channels) analogue cable connection without any extra boxes, antennas or subscription fees.Picture: I get all the local channels in either 720p or 1080i and they look great. The inauguration looked fantastic and I can't wait to watch the superbowl in HD from my own couch. SD channels are fine. 4:3 pictures are the equivalent of a 32.5\" CRT so replacing our 27\" was win-win. Lowering the sharpness helps SD. Upconverted DVDs and Netflix (both via XBox 360) look great. I'm sure a BlueRay player will be fantastic.Sound: Great for TV speakers. I don't need the stereo on unless I want the big sound. The RCA output on the back is variable so you can set the stereo at a good volume and control it all with the TV remote.Settings: They are straight forward and probably layman friendly, though I'd like a little more control over some features. I'd like to be able to disable the SmartSound feature during gaming example.Remote: Not great. It needs to be aimed a lot more precisely than any of my other remotes. It is prone to double taps (jumping over settings in the menu / channels in the guide etc...) The keypress timing seems to be set too fast. Even though it is a \"universal\" remote (quotes used because it can't be programmed to my audio system) I'll probably replace it with the Harmony designed for the XBox 360.Gaming with an XBox 360 and a Wii:Audio: There is an issue with the 360's audio via the HDMI cable BUT I understand from a Microsoft friend that there is already a fix in Beta to resolve the issue. The SmartSound feature (to keep commercials from blasting) cuts the volume in video games sonmetimes so I have it wired directly to the stereo anyway.Video: I've only had one moment during a particulary bright scene in Rock Band 2 which produced an odd slow-down effect. I changed a video mode to Gaming and haven't noticed it since. Fast paced FPS and driving games are smooth. The Wii is only 420p of course but Wii Tennis is a lot more fun in widescreen.Other: There are enough inputs and outputs to keep me happy for a long time. It's light and easy to move around. The base is a little flimsy for my taste but not a concern. The shiny frame is not noticable though it might be if you have it in a bright or sunny room. I like that you can turn the backlight off behind the \"Toshiba\" nameplate on the front of the unit. Left side controls are easy to access and simple to memorize.If I could remove 1/2 a star for the remote I would, otherwise it's a very nice TV, especially at the $[...] price point.#################1 month down the road: XBox 360 HDMI audio issues have been resolved by microsoft, but new HDMI issues have come up. The HDMI connection drops occasionally. Switching to another source and back resolves it, usualy until the next time I use the TV. Seems to be more prevalent while watching Netflix or a DVD and almost never does it during a game. Component inputs seem fine.I think I'll swap it at Costco for a new one. If it continues I'll be getting another brand.##############################PROBLEM SOLVED! The replacement has no issues at all. I just had a unit with flaky HDMI inputs. I've played a few hours of XBox 360, watched several episodes of 30 Rock through Netflix and watched a couple of movies witohut any cut-outs.

COULD NOT BE HAPPIER!! the picture is awesome.  my xbox 360 looks absolutely stunning as well.  the reviews are true that the sound on this tv is not up to par.  but not many lcd's have great speakers because of the small size the speakers need to be to fit in tv.

It appears to be solidly built, easy to set up and operate.  The image quality is outstanding -- extremely pleased with this.  The only real weakness is the sound.  It is barely acceptable in quality, and kind of weak.  Even when you turn the volume up real high the sound never gets really loud.  The fidelity is acceptable for casual viewing but would not be acceptable if you were using this TV for serious entertainment purposes -- you would definitely need a home theater surround sound system.One odd characteristic is that it is tilted forward slightly -- the top of the panel is about a quarter inch further forward than the bottom.  I thought I had mounted the base incorrectly, so I unscrewed it and remounted it, and same result.  Then I went back to the store where I bought it and looked at the floor model, same thing.  Then I called Toshiba and asked them about it.  They confirmed that it is actually designed to tilt forward slightly, but could offer no reason for this other than \"stability.\"Overall I heartily endorse the TV, glad I bought it, so far.

Having looked at the Sony Bravias closely and using them as the benchmark I searched for a comparable or better TV for less money. I found that Toshiba had an excellent contrasting image and would compete with the Sony and it was usually half of the Sony price. The small downside is the sound quality but using the auxilliary audio output allows for a standard stereo system or surround system to utilize the signal and makes for a fuller sound.

It has built-in features such as CineSpeed and DynoLight, which are supposed to make your movie viewing experience close to that in a cinema; but frankly, I don't really know how much better these features have made a regular DVD any better than they already are (sorry, not bluRay yet).The TV tuner seems to be better than that of the Sony we had.  We use a rabbit ear antenna with enhancement features, and this set has picked up three extra channels than the Sony did - albeit these additional channels are all religious channels that we don't really care for.While HD signals are played beautifully, SD signals suffer from quite severe ghosting - that is, murky color spots would appear to be \"fixed\" at certain spots on the screen while the rest of the scene move. It may also have something to do with how SD images are rendered because we don't notice this problem with HD signals.Not sure how much output power the speakers have.  We only use the built-in speakers for TV and Wii; as for DVDs, we pipe the sound to a 5.1 with fiber optics.  The mute button is a two-step mute. That is, the first click cuts the volume by half, and the second click completely silences it.  nice or annoying, you be the judge.CNet review says this TV is not \"digital TV certified\" and I am not quite sure what they mean by that.The picture size features are badly named. While \"native\", \"full\" and \"4:3\" make sense, we have no idea what \"Theatre 1\", \"Theatre 2\", \"Theatre 3\" and \"Natural\" actually mean.  Just different types of zoom modes, I guess.What bothered me the most is how its PC (or VGA) port only displays up to 1050x768. If you want to get 1080p for your computer, you must get a DVI/HDMI cable (I got a 10' cable from monoprice dot com for about 18 bucks).  However, the default picture setting has over-set the saturation, so the green and red look as if they are going to melt the screen and burn my eyes out.  I had to lower the color setting to lower the saturation.  But quite frankly, 1080p is bit too small on the fonts (I know I can change the DPI, but I don't want to), so I reverted back to 1050x768 (shhhh... don't let my wife know that or she will yell at me for buying that DVI/HDMI cable for nothing).The remote control comes with the set is a universal remote and it looks fancy... but a lot of buttons are useless until you program it to replace all your other remotes... the buttons are not back-lit, but are actually glow-in-the-dark, so they are still difficult to use in the dark.  Personally I prefer a simple remote with few buttonsIts power saving (and screen saving) feature is not as good as I hoped.  The TV does not turn off its back light quickly when there is no video signal; instead, it displays a jumping blue banner that says no signal detected, and I have not found out how long it takes to automatically shut off (or on standby).Overall I am very satisfied with this unit, and it is definitely worth the price.", "Date": "April 5, 2009"}, {"Title": "Great TV, Nice price.", "Author": "Henry Johnson", "ReviewID": "R7OMUIJ7K094W", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Purchased Tv Feb.09 for $698 from Tiger Direct.

The Toshiba 40\" unit fits perfectly.  The TV is very light weight for its size compared with the TV I replaced.  This made carrying the thing upstairs a lot easier, a one man job.  I hooked it up to hi-def digital cable/dvr.  It took longer to snake the power cord through the entertainment unit than it did to hook up the dvd/game unit/dvr+stereo receiver.  Set up was pretty simple!!  The difference in picture clarity between standard tv and hi-def is just unreal.  The Toshiba has a nice clean \"frame\" around the screen, doesn't distract from the picture.  The Toshiba logo on front can even be turned off, which some may like.

While I knew I could trust Samsung from the name, after reading many reviews it seemed that you are basically paying an extra $100 or so just for that name.  To me Toshiba is a good brand name as well, so I didn't think I would be gambling anyway.I bought my TV at Best Buy using the $600 price match on Amazon at the time (12/31/09).  So far after owning this TV for one week I am thoroughly pleased with it.  It happens to fit perfectly into my 2 bedroom apartment living room and I feel the size is pretty much perfect for the place and seating distance.The only issues I have had so far are minor.  The remote for the DirecTV works after programming it to the TV, but for some reason the power button doesn't turn off the TV, so the TV remote is still somewhat necessary.  The only other thing I have noticed is that after changing the \"pic size\" to a different format it resets to the default after turning off the TV and turning it back on.  I'm not sure if there is any way to set that to a new default, but either way it's only a minor nuisance.My closing statement is that if you are in the market for a TV upgrade, but don't want to go all out, then get this TV.  Another thing is that if you are going to want a higher level TV, then you should really be getting an LED and shelling out the big bucks.  If you are getting one in the mean time that isn't so high priced to hold you over (older technology like regular LCD or Plasma) then I can think of no better way to spend your money.", "Date": "January 8, 2010"}, {"Title": "Excellent value", "Author": "W.

As compared to the REGZA, these are the biggest difference as I noticed with the 40RV525U:Picture:  Out of the box, the picture was actually better on the 525U (non-REGZA).  There were fewer adjustments, but the stock picture was definitely better.  The REGZA unit also up-converted inputs, which made a noticeable difference in quality.Sound:  The 40RV525U sounded a little thin in comparison to the REGZA unit.  Its no replacement for an AV receiver, but fine for most general TV viewing .Other:  The 40RV525U does NOT have a swivel base.

After our terrible experience with this, i wouldn't trust Toshiba to make a toaster.The TV continues to get worse and worse and worse. Reception is incredibly awful - even after attaching to antenna and signal booster - the screen frezes about every four or five seconds. Literally, any time a vehicle goes by, or someone walks in the room, it loses signal. It's Toshiba's poor quality - my neighbors with LGs and Sonys do not have this problem.The ongoing control panel malfunctions continue to get worse as well. Previously, it was enough to use the remote to lock the control panel so that it wouldn't change channels, volume, etc on us, it would just put up a red \"Not Available\" to let us know that we couldn't change channels, inputs etc. When this first started happening, the Not Avaialble would show for a few seconds and go away. Now, it can last days. We literally set the TV at night to whatever channel we want to watch the next night, just in case. The TV is, thus, unusable.I'm continually astonished by how terrible the quality is on this TV, especially given that it was priced mid-market, similar to the Sony M seris. We should've gotten one of those. Next time we will. I will NEVER buy any product made by Toshiba again. They are unreliable and, we find out too late, the only warranty service is in a bad area of town where I don't feel safe hauling my TV to.ORIGINAL (5/3/10)We've had this TV for a little over a year. Picture is outstanding - too good for my old video game consoles but the Blu-Ray looks awesome. Sound is only okay ... a set like this really deserves a good amp and 5.1 speakers.Setup is easy, although the built-in tuner is really weak. This is a set designed with cable or satellite in mind - and we tend to lose reception every time a car drives by because we do not have cable. The stink of it is that if we got cable, we'd only be able to get 480i or at best 720p on most stations, including local, because of the local cable companies. Even with an antenna (an RCA flat) reception is not much better.The tuner also has a tendency to freeze - or something like it where the channel will just stick and nothing responds. Just faces frozen in time on our screen. Turning it off and on has worked - so far.The other gripe is more recent and perplexing. Our TV has a tendency to randomly change channels. It's not the remote (we can take the batteries out and it still happens) and it doesn't seem to be a stuck button on the console itself (we'll hit the opposite button to no effect). It just fundamentally dislikes what's on and decides that something must be done about it. Our only solution is to turn it off and wait a while to see if it stops.
