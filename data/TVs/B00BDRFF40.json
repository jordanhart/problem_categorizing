I've been through many Tvs.  I currently have the Vizo M501 M Series and it's nothing but trouble for me.  This little known JVC BC50R is a workhorse! Almost no (if any) edge bleed from light.  Motion is rock solid.  Black levels are solid.  For the price, this is by far the best picture you will find for an LED/LCD.  No doubt in my mind. If you're not looking for fancy apps (that you probably won't use anyway), and don't need 3D (which you probably won't use anyway).  This is the dark horse for 2013.", "Date": "June 3, 2013"}, {"Title": "Almost 5 stars", "Author": "Christopher Higgins \"topher13\"", "ReviewID": "R10HYL1V7OTR7B", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "The sound is not amazing, but everything else on this TV is top notch. The picture quality is much more like a plasma than an LCD, and  the blacks are deep and rich, all of the colors very bright and beautiful. Movies, news everything comes through crystal clear. This TV is much better to look at than my $2,400 Samsung LCD. Highly recommend it, if you can find one.", "Date": "October 17, 2013"}, {"Title": "Excellent TV for the money", "Author": "J.

We will be using in the bedroom to replace our Samsung junk that died after only 5 yrs.  I am so sick of Samsung junk but that;s another story.  Anyhow if you don't need all the wi-fi stuff on the TV this is a great bargen.  We use ROKU for all our wi-fi viewing as it has more selections than any TV out there.  The JVC picture looks good... clear - bright -  good color right out of the box  - good black level too and the speakers (which you can customize) are better than any Vizio or Samsung even selling for several hundred dollars more.

( although no longer available @ that price)The TV's controls, permit the user to configure the picture for very high-contrast(i.e Bright-White through absolute BLACK with vivid & realistic colors)But, if viewing in a dark room, be aware, I noticed a significant andannoying LED-light \"edge-bleed\"; which is more noticeable during darker scenes or DVD chapter changes.pros:slim,  50-1/2\" diag., semi-gloss screen (low-glare), 1/2\" bezel, extra-sturdy stand,Optical-Out (PCM or DD), Stereo-Out(var), 3-HDMi,lip-sync, audio-only , abundant controls for Picture/Sound, ...cons:  chg'g TV channels, limited viewing-angle,  TV-sound,un-grounded pwr-cord, remote-cntl sensor location,Picture settings ARE universal (NOT per input),things I miss .vs. my prev.

If you want a 50\", this is worth the $$.", "Author": "TNT", "ReviewID": "RIDJP73LFDMWB", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Great TV.  I bought online at a major retailer on Cyber Monday and really like it.  The size is awesome, the 120HZ refresh was important to me.  Sound was a little odd at first, but I turned off the Xtreme Bass (or whatever it was) and it sounds as normal as any other TV I've had. Picture quality is really good.I really like the remote- on the bottom there are buttons for HDMI, TV etc, so I can switch right to my Roku w/out having to navigate thru a bunch of menus like on my old TV.Note- the plug for this TV is not grounded (has only 2 prongs). Not that it matters, but I bought a surge protector too and thought it was worth mentioning. TV prob uses so little power (?) that it didn't need a 3 prong plug. I think this uses like $15 worth of power in a given year (?), that's due to the LED's. Awesome. TV doesn't get 'hot' like my old tube TV years ago!Now, this is NOT a SmartTV, I didn't want one. Having all that 'stuff' built into your TV and in 2 years (like most cell phones) the apps and processor are outdated so you have to replace the ENTIRE TV.....no way.  I'd rather get a new Roku or external device to handle my apps (like Amazon Prime) versus having it built into the TV.Also, this TV is built by the same manufacturer  that makes Vizio (I believe?). Do some research....you'll find it.Worth noting - it does have some 'legacy' inputs for hooking up older school devices. I have none, but that may be of interest to some people.  Has 4 HDMI ports.Great TV. Very happy w/ my purchase. (have owned for about 2 weeks as of this review)Edit:  it's now been about a month, and I have to say this TV is awesome.  That Xtreme bass needed to be turned off, that is a huge part of any sound issues you read about w/ this TV.  I did buy a 4 year product protection plan (bought online thru W*lm*rt where I bought the TV), hope I never need it though!Also, there are apparently 'better' times of year to buy a TV, do reading online as I did and you'll understand. Example - one thing I read stated that new models come out in the Spring (?) so that's a good time to buy LAST years model at a discount etc.These things aren't cheap, so it's worth researching.ALSO, refresh rates - may manufacturers have 'fake' refresh rates - specifically fake 120Hz rates. Google 'misleading refresh rates' and read up. This pushed me away from many TV's.
