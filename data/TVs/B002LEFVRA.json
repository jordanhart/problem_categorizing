Now, I can put a DVD in, and it turns on TV and starts playing onscreen! No menu surfing. Very nice! Easy out-of-the-box setup. As other reviewers mentioned...Turn off light sensor!!! Sony should disable this feature. It really does make the picture quality look really bad. Thanks to previous reviewers for mentioning this. You save me hours of grief.My main concern was reliability. I heard about most reliable being the three \"S\":-Sony-Samsung-SharpI saw too many posts mentioning Sharp power supply failures. Same for some Panasonic plasmas from last 2-3 years. Also heard some complaints about some of the Samsung models. Much less with this Sony model. So, I decided to buy it. I hope this post helps. God bless you and good luck!UPDATE: Nov. 2012 - Still have this TV. Still working fine. From the beginning, I did have it connected to a UPS and had a small turbo fan in back of TV to keep it cool.", "Date": "October 3, 2009"}, {"Title": "Great TV", "Author": "Richard Thomas Stone \"Rick Stone\"", "ReviewID": "R2ZWKHECYNE6IW", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This TV has plenty of inputs and outputs to hookup all of my components. The picture is excellent and the remote is easy to use and program for other components. I also purchased the internet video link box which is a nice addition. I would recommend this TV to anyone looking for a great picture and easy to setup.", "Date": "September 2, 2009"}, {"Title": "Bravia just keeps getting better", "Author": "P.

I am thoroughly blown away with the amount of variety on this TV System. Internet, 7HDMI ( 4 HD inputs),Picture in Picture is back and numerous options for accessing functions. If you have a PS3 you will be more familiar as it follows the PS3 menu style of searching. The Bravia Synch is wonderful with the SONY Surround Sound System and the design is simply beautiful. Keep it up SONY.", "Date": "January 19, 2010"}, {"Title": "Amazing TV!", "Author": "Patricia Hampton", "ReviewID": "R239UFNN1PASR4", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I absolutely LOVE this TV!  The picture is clear, I have had no motion issues and the color is both brillant and natural looking at the same time.  It doesn't take up much more space than my old 200 pound 32 inch tube TV but it is all picture.  It's easy to plug in and use. Switching picture modes to eliminate strips on the sides or bottom is easy and their are four choices so you find the right one with a push of a button. Recommend having some good quality HDMI cables on hand. I had a cheap one and it didn't work at all. If there is a down side, it's that I find myself watching more TV!", "Date": "January 2, 2010"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "Unavailable", "Features": "Full HD 1080p resolution\nMotionflow 120Hz technology\n30,000:1 dynamic contrast ratio\nSony's BRAVIA 2 Engine\n4 HDMI inputs, 1 USB port", "Name": "(Refurbished) Sony Bravia 46\" VL Series 1080p LCD HDTV", "ImgURL": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/31cT0mXGpxL.jpg", "ProductID": "B002LEFVRA"}}
