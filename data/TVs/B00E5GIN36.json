The colors jump out, and with no LED-style backlighting, the blacks and contrast ratios are fantastic. It's also \"fast\" with no motion artifacts, and with a good quality 1080p signal, there's a smoothness to the image that has to be seen to be believed. I've owned and auditioned lots of Plasma and LED monitors - this is by far the absolutely best image I've ever seen on a 55\" screen.Worth checking on this TV is 3D. I've never really found 3D in the home to be all that fantastic - but the Samsung takes it to an entirely different level. I'd actually say 3D on this TV is better than 3D in any theater.A funky use of the 3D technology is \"MultiView\" - a feature Samsung advertises as the ability for different viewers to watch two totally different programs at the same time on a single TV by wearing your 3D glasses. Not sure I see a lot of utility to this (I like my sound from my home theater speakers, not the 3D glasses), but it is kind of an amazing way to show how much raw capability the TV itself has.In terms of construction quality, I give the Samsung high marks. The set itself is thinner and lighter than many others in this size, though at over sixty pounds, it's not exactly a featherweight. I have mixed feelings about the curved screen, mostly because it makes the TV a bit more difficult to wall mount or fit into cabinetry. Still, that aside, it's like an IMAX screen that gives you a stunning side-to-side view, even if you're not right on center.This TV also integrates Internet and other high tech features in the best way I've yet seen.For one thing, the TV responds to physical gestures and voice commands, much like an XBox Kinect. Wave at your TV and ask it whether your favorite TV show is on and you get a custom directory on the screen showing the schedule you asked for. Very cool.The TV also has all the usual Internet options built-in, from a self-patching software management system for the TV itself, to browsers, Netflix and so forth. WiFi is built in and you can share content with other devices and computers on your network, and there's even a rudimentary video conferencing system that works with services like Apple's FaceTime and Skype. The quad-core processor makes all the animations smooth and performance fast.The only drawbacks I see are (of course) the price and lack of screens larger than 55\", but I'm sure that will evolve soon enough. As for the price, the performance is so much better than what you get on a $2500 unit, I have to say that the Samsung is a good value for the price. Still, I'm sure prices will drop quickly (this unit was $15K when first announced in Korea), and before you know it, OLED technology on an 85\" screen with 4K signal processing would be quite an amazing product.At the moment, I'm feeling like Samsung has created a product that's in a class of its own, and that this is the TV all others should be measured against for the immediate future - at least until all the other brands catch up. Even if you don't intend to buy, it's worth a trip to your local store to see one of these close-up...it will definitely give you a sense of where TV is going in the future.Definitely recommended.", "Date": "October 13, 2013"}, {"Title": "Best OLED TV available yet", "Author": "Mumbi", "ReviewID": "R2Q7GTIBU4WM48", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I bought this TV recently and the picture quality is absolutely stunning. This TV has the deepest black levels combined with the brightest whites (it's much brighter than LG's OLED TV with color filters). Samsungs OLED doesn't need this filters, the light comes directly to your eyes and the picture is crisp and clear. MultiView allows you and your family and friends to watch two different programs at the same time and with the built-in headphones its absolutely stunning and it works so fine! you can also watch two 3D movies at the same time. The colors are so deep, it's incredible, it's a whole new experience to watch movies and playing games. the curved panel is not so much curved but you can't mount it on the wall but it looks phantastic in the room. I would prefer a flat panel but the curve here is very minimal. if you wan't the best picture quality available yet: this is it! well, it's not 4K but this TV edges out every 4K LCD out there in terms of picture quality, color reproduction and contrast.", "Date": "December 12, 2013"}, {"Title": "Best Picture Quality Of Any TV, But No 4K, Curved Screen And No Wall Mount Hurt The Package", "Author": "P. Colin McGraw \"AV, Computer & EnviroTech Nut\"", "ReviewID": "RR1SXMU4NFXLA", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "OLED represents the future of premium quality and this TV already offers the best picture quality of any TV ever made, finally besting the fabled Pioneer Kuro. CNET reviewer David Katzmeir noted \"Its picture surpasses plasma and LED LCD in the most important ways, with no major gotchas or downsides.\"The key to the picture quality are the unrivaled black levels. Unlike LCD/LED sets, each pixel can be individually turned off with no \"blooming\" even at off angle, and the the pixels can basically reach absolute black whereas even the best plasma sets emit a faint glow. Additionally, this set can offer a brighter picture than plasma, so the end result is a contrasty image that wows and pops! To see this set in action is to love it! I compared it to my (also expensive) Sharp Elite set and was absolutely blown away!If you want the spare-no-expense best picture quality, this is it. The Samsung even edges out the more expensive LG OLED set.However, there are some important drawbacks to be aware of (beyond price). The first is that this isn't a 4K/Ultra HD set, so by the standard of resolution, this set already trails the (also beautiful) sets like the Sony XBR-65X900A.Additionally, the set has a concave curve, which Samsung claims is to make it so that every part of the screen is an equal distance from your eye if you sit in the right position, but I secretly suspect that the real reason is either because of an undisclosed technical limitation, or just to show off the thinness and flexibility of OLED (since no other set can be bent or curved the same way). For me, I'm used to flat screens and prefer them, especially when viewing with friends and family who may not be sitting in the sweet spot.The last notable limitation is that this set can't be wall-mounted, which may or may not be an issue for some shoppers.All in all, however, this is the best picture quality TV money can buy (as long as you have a LOT of money to spare).", "Date": "November 21, 2013"}, {"Title": "jaw dropping color and deep black", "Author": "J.

The set is not as curved in person as it appears in the product photos.  From head on at 10 feet I perceived it to be fairly flat.  If you stand on the side it is more obvious.  Side viewing angle is amazing.
