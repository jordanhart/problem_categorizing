Hickey", "ReviewID": "R1B5LXMC3N6U0V", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "When I first started looking for an HDTV for my husband and did some research I had decided to purchase a smaller Bravia or possibly a Vizio.  We walked into Best Buy and started looking at the specs on various models just to get ideas.  I had read earlier in the day that you should ignore the picture of the TV while in a retail store and only look at the hardware esthetics and the specs as some retailers will try to make certain expensive models look better than other models.With that in mind we began our actual comparisons and found that the models on the walls with the best specs were all well over $2000.  We had decided that we definitely needed the 120hz rather than the 60hz in order to ensure we had the TV for a longer period of time and we wanted the 1080p not the 1080i.  After browsing and beginning to think we were going to have to go with a smaller 42\" TV for the price point we wanted to stay with we met a salesperson who showed us this TV.  The picture was great, the specifications were better than the Bravia's and Vizio's we were looking at and the sale price was $1299.00!  We continued to review the specs and looking for the hitch.  We could not find one.We decided to bring the TV home that night with the understanding that we could return it within 30 days if we decided to but we have now had it for four weeks and we absolutely love it.  We sit about 6-7 feet from the TV and the picture is clear, the TV easy to use and we have had to switch our DVR recordings over to the HD channels because everything on the regular channels looks awful because the picture is so good.  Note:  the contrast ratio on this TV is 50,000:1 vs. the 30,000:1 you typically see on much higher priced TV's.We are very happy with our choice of TV and wouldn't switch it out with anything else we have seen.", "Date": "December 22, 2008"}, {"Title": "Scarlet", "Author": "C.

I feel like the characters in the programs are right in the room with us.  The clarity is amazing.  This is our third LG HDTV and it is the best.  The price on Amazon was a terrific value and included white glove delivery.  This was the first time we had anything delivered by Pilot Freight and they were courteous and prompt.  They called on Monday, Dec 15 to set up the delivery day and time and worked with our schedule.  The driver called and gave us an exact delivery time.  We are very satisfied with our purchase.", "Date": "December 18, 2008"}, {"Title": "AWESOME!!!!!!!", "Author": "S. Cardwell", "ReviewID": "R1QA0K2OXGZPDX", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "After a couple of months of researching LCD televisions, I narrowed my search to Sony, Samsung, Visio and LG.I saw models of the first 3 brands that I was interested in, but couldn't find a store that carried the LG Scarlet........until I visited Conn's when they were advertising a lower end LG model at a really great price.I was checking that one out and just wasn't that pleased with it.....and then I noticed right above it was the LG 47LG60 Scarlet.  It was hands down the most attractive of all the televisions with an awesome picture.So instead of buying at the store, I came home and made my purchase through Amazon.com and couldn't be more pleased..........with the service, with the delivery and best of all - with the television.", "Date": "February 27, 2009"}, {"Title": "47LG60 With red back and glowing circle", "Author": "Zack Sonshine \"INTERGRAVE INC\"", "ReviewID": "RSX660KLH0XDQ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "OK lets talk about features that some people don't understand and would like if considering this unit.  It has 1080i resolution. (possibly best than can be seen by the human eye) Resolution speaks for it's self.Now here's where people get cheap, misinformed, exc. it has 120Hz Technology. What does that mean? Producers of movies, sporting events, TV shows and alike constantly move the camera. (unless your watching c-span) While moving the camera, on a 60hz model you will notice blurriness..  It gets quite annoying to say the least, if your watching an action movie, it is not nearly as sharp as what you could possibly be watching. Going with that... The 120Hz \"Feature\" technology, <refreshes> the screen faster so images are not blurred. (so much you can actually tell it's a stunt double, or in the matter of sports, view details much more precisely with out waiting for the slow motion replay.)The combination of the 1080, and 120Hz IN THE STORE, is usually under rated by poor wiring.  A proper DVI/HDMI cable MUST BE USED to get 100% of the TVs potential.Add this all together, and based on my experience with Digital Cable, HDMI Cable ( standard 1.3 ) <Regular non-high speed>, and the 47LG60.  I haven't left the tv.. I wish more/all channels came in HD..It's ridiculous to explain the resolution/detail.  It's like I never REALLY was truly watching TV before this set.  Allow me to elaborate quickly.  I now see that the camera is not on a tripod in 90% of shows / movies.. it bobbles around constantly. In fact now with the HUGE TV, i find myself kinda getting motion sick / car sick because in bobbles so frequently.  Secondly I see every detail. Not to name shows, but you can see a SINGLE stray hair on an actress's head and be amazed, that watching your nightly news, the anchor man has dog hair on his suit, visible now, unseen before...  and finally.  Hollywood's actors act horrible.. their movements now in HD are MUCH more obvious and don't seem real.My evaluation.. buy yourself an awesome 1080 120hz LCD TV. Get an HD tuner, and watch TV for a week straight.. if you don't realize what you've been missing in the first 5 minutes..  I'll invite you to come view mine, the 47LG60, and watch me outburst with \"OMG do/did you see that?!\" Enjoy.LG 47LG60 47-Inch 1080p 120hz LCD HDTV, Gloss Piano Black with Scarlet RedLG 47LG50 47-Inch 1080p LCD HDTV", "Date": "February 24, 2009"}, {"Title": "A beautiful TV", "Author": "Kerrigan \"Kerrigan\"", "ReviewID": "R31WJM0TY85QIB", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "My friend bought 2 tv's just like this. One he placed in his home, the other in the office where we get to watch HD and blu ray videos and concerts. He also bought additional speakers to have a theater effect. Everything was perfect. The colors were superb, the pictures were excellent - you could very well see the details.
