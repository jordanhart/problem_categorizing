Clean, simple lines ... and the 19 inch size is perfect for the space. Note that the pictures here are of the 22 inch model ... the inputs are actually on the other side of the TV.Plenty of inputs, set up was easy... (my only gripes are not the fault of the TV .... #%^* Comcast ... why do you insist on scrambling basic cable so I need an ugly digital adapter?) The on screen user interface is pretty and easy to use. Remote Control is your standard multibutton affair!Sound and Picture quality? Great for ths small inexpensive TV. It has a plethora of settings so you can adjust it the way you like. like one reviewer here, I thought it was a little washed out ... but then I found the \"Magic Angle\" setting and changed it from default to I'm looking at it \"Standing\" ... i.e. from above (which is how I'm using it - on a kitchen counter) ... and POW ... great color and picture!Couldn't be happier. Excellent TV. Highly recommended!", "Date": "March 26, 2011"}, {"Title": "Couldn't be much better", "Author": "jimbinaustin", "ReviewID": "R316RQOBUIWJXQ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Got this TV about a week ago from Amazon and am amazed by the picture quality. In addition I love the sleek profile which works exceptionally well in my Kitchen. I looked at this side by side with last years Samsung C model lcd which is heavier, a lot bulkier looking and, at least in the store I saw them, did not have as nice of a picture quality.By the way this is listed as \"silver\" but it's really black with clear plastic on the outside edges of the TV. Calling it silver may mislead some. I was going to blow off buying it because of this but glad I went and checked it out in person. This is one modern looking TV.The only thing that's to be desired is the sound quaility. I'm not going to call it a strike because that's par for the course with this size unit. There are limitiations to every product. It would probably cost a fortune to put full sounding speakers in such a small profile.Highly recommended.", "Date": "March 18, 2011"}, {"Title": "Awesome LED TV", "Author": "Kevin", "ReviewID": "RH5P2GGBQ5B2", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I bought this for my college dorm room and so far I am very happy with this purchase. It delivers a crystal clear picture and amazing sound. I plugged in my Xbox 360 and it plays it on high resolution and it looks incredible. A very good investment for a kitchen or a small room or a college dorm room.", "Date": "August 9, 2011"}, {"Title": "Great Picture once you learn the trick", "Author": "Jeanne", "ReviewID": "RIFBDVMOOHI52", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "My 19\" Samsung sits on a counter-level peninsula in my kitchen.  Initially, I was very disappointed in the color which was very washed out.  I hesitated to start playing around with the color controls fearing I would make it worse.  I decided to check out the Reviews and discovered the solution in an earlier review.  Namely, to go into the \"Samsung MagicAngle\" option within the \"Picture Mode\" in the Menu and change the angle to \"Standing Mode.\"  That worked like a charm.  Also, I agree with earlier reviewers about the sound.  I typically have to turn the sound up nearly as high as it will go to hear it 8' away. Nevertheless, I really like the TV and am glad I got it.", "Date": "January 12, 2012"}, {"Title": "Samsung UN19D4000 19\" LED HDTV", "Author": "ysutton", "ReviewID": "R37IPAT8XIRS6B", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This 19\" television was purchased for the kitchen and I am very pleased with the picture quality and sound.

Now  very little available and of poor quality in 15\".  This19\" tv fits the space perfectly and oddly even looks smaller than the old one because of the way the measurements of the screen are configured.

Only complaint is that it was stuck in \"store demo\" mode and took me 2 hours to figure out through internet searches on how to turn it off. Lets hope that never gets turned on again lol. Most importantly there are two hdmi plugs on this tv so we could plug in the cable box and a blu ray player.

The picture is of the 22\" model, which shows the mounting screw holes centered on the back of the TV.  The 19\" model, probably because of the smaller chassis, has the screw holes at the very TOP of the back of the TV.  So, when I hung it on the wall mount, about 1/3 of the mounting plate sits above the back of the TV, making it look vaguely like it has bunny ears.  Pretty ridiculous in my opinion.  Customers should be aware of this.  Otherwise it's a good TV, a little pricey for the size, in my opinion.  I got the 40 inch version 1080p SmartTV for under 600 dollars at Sears, so it seems like this is a little expensive, but it's in line with the prices elsewhere.", "Date": "December 13, 2011"}, {"Title": "Smells like a chemical factory.", "Author": "goodstuff \"no crap!\"", "ReviewID": "R3DSBS1X3HAUPV", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I had to return this unit.
