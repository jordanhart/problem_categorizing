{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Gamer Review - No Smart TV Features, No Problem", "Author": "BrainiacRK \"BrainiacRK\"", "ReviewID": "R2IZQTZLGPZUOW", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I'm a gamer. I have an Xbox One. I use it to (obviously) play games, watch Netflix and YouTube, listen to music, and even browse the Internet occasionally. And if I had a PS4, I know it would offer many of those same features.It's for this reason (because I own an console that already does everything) that I DO NOT want a more expensive Smart TV with a bunch of built-in apps that I don't care about. Instead, I simply want a basic, reasonably priced, high-quality LED on which my Xbox One interface will look great. And this TV... it delivers. It is a 'stupid' as they come when it comes to LED TVs and that makes me very happy.Additionally, newer Toshiba TVs have an excellently responsive Game Mode. Just go look over on the Input Lag database (search Input Lag Database on Google) and you'll see that Toshiba offers some great options. This TV isn't in the database yet, but I decided to go ahead and gamble and buy it anyway... and after a couple of days worth of TitanFall I'm confident that this TV is super-speedy for gaming. My daughter watched Frozen with the Movie Mode turned on and it looked great too, but honestly, like I said, this is a gamer review, so there's probably somebody else out there more qualified at telling you if the 120 HZ ClearMotion is quality enough for movie buffs.So yeah, if 1) you want a pretty big TV on which to play games, 2) you're like me and see no need to double-dip by having both Smart TV and Xbox One apps that literally do the exact same thing, and 3) you're on a budget, then this TV is a GREAT choice.", "Date": "March 26, 2014"}, {"Title": "Great No Frills LED TV", "Author": "jjh10718", "ReviewID": "R1SAE2R9YB4HBX", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "If you are shopping for a TV but don't need all the bells and whistles that come with a smart TV, then i highly recommend this unit.  It is a very attractive unit - slim and stylish.  Best of all is the picture! So clear and bright.  Definitely worth looking at when shopping for a reasonably priced LED TV.", "Date": "April 2, 2014"}, {"Title": "Awesome TV for PS3 and PS4!", "Author": "Jay Man", "ReviewID": "RZVS1SOXIEOUA", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I was specially looking for a non-smart TV just for gaming and I picked this one. There seems to be a few problems with Samsung Smart TV's freezing up and I did not need that option anyway. If you are looking for a smart TV, I would recommend buying a Roku with this TV. You can't go wrong for the price since it is a 1080 TV. Also this is not a true 120hz TV, only in cinema mode and I did not see any difference in gaming and I am not using gaming mode since this TV seems fast enough. This TV is also a gloss finish which makes the picture more crisp! Once thing I noticed playing Battlefield 4 on my new Samsung and LG TV, that there is a certain map that has a cave and I can actually see with the Toshiba inside the cave and the LG and Samsung I could not, so I always hated playing that map till nowThe colors are nice and crisp and there is no delay in the response time with the controller. I am using a HDMI connection and did a few adjustments on the colors from a previous review someone did. Amazon can't seem to keep this TV in stock, so I had to buy it from a different dealer. The only thing I did add was buy a Philips CSS2123B/F7 SoundBar Home Cinema Speakers for added gaming experience, otherwise it sounds pretty good with the built in speakers. The TV is also very light and can be easily moved around and it also has a VESA mount for mounting on the wall.", "Date": "April 21, 2014"}, {"Title": "Fantastic TV for the price", "Author": "updeau22", "ReviewID": "R1IH6FISDP1FJM", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I bought this HDTV on Amazon Warehouse deals and it came quick and in excellent condition. Right out of the box it was a very easy setup. I had bought a Samsung Smart TV and I was a little disappointed in the Netflix app stuttering and stopping many times.

One had major bleeding issues during dark scenes. Looked horrible. Exchanged it for same model. All is good.1080 looks awesome in my bedroom. The tv is 60hz with basically an enhancer that clocks refresh at 120 but you only can 'enable' that by putting it in Cinema mode. Basketball looked no different in Cinema mode than it did with Cinema mode turned off.Spend some time tinkering with the picture settings. After a while I got things looking amazing. I keep backlight at 30 and brightness at 20. Contrast at 60. Noise reduction off. Color at 30. Tint 0, Sharpness at 5 and didn't even bother messing with color hues and such. Temperature is medium and picture mode Standard.2 hdmi is enough for me. Sound is great. Plenty loud. Easy setup. Aluminium-ish stand and bottom frame look really nice.

Both are very good products, great pictures, colors, contrast, etc. Easy to customize various settings to individual desires. White Glove Delivery was exceptional. Delivery company was in contact with me prior to date of delivery. Via phone contact, set delivery date convenient for me. Two delivery persons came, as did for delivery of first set (handed down to nephew and wife as theirs was \"on it's last legs\". Delivery persons brought tv in, unpacked and attached stand, inspected and allowed me to visually inspect, carried to desired room and set up. They offered to hook up tv and program, however I waived this and did later in the day. Delivery persons very friendly, relaxed but very efficient manner and treated tv with great care.

The Vanity comes in as all the other electronics in the cabinet were \"gun metal\" and I did not want a black bezel on the tv. Searching for maximum size and gun metal resulted in this HDTV. The bonus is is that it has a great picture (after following suggestion from an earlier reviewer) and the sound is acceptable. I wanted a plain HDTV as I won a Roku 3 and luckily we have over the air digital signals for the local channels. I assembled it, set it up, attached the Roku and life is excellent on the bedroom tv watching spectrum. Regarding the other reviewer's statement about the instability of the stand, if you screw it into the TV stand, and/or apply a strap to the provided rear hook, as Toshiba states to complete the installation with the stand,  no problems with tipping. I live in earthquake territory and all appliances get locked down.So if you want a \"vanilla\" HDTV of decent size you can't go wrong with this purchase.", "Date": "May 1, 2014"}, {"Title": "awesome product", "Author": "Alex Sendejo", "ReviewID": "RC1HG2LOD5UU4", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This t.v is perfect for gaming,everything looks clear and it feels like i can see clearly for the first time,i was using a very old model tv with a fat back,compared to that im in heaven,and i have no issues with the t.v whatsoever,i live on a budget and this t.v was both affordable and gives a high quality picture for the price.esspecially for gaming,very good response time even when not in game mode.", "Date": "April 23, 2014"}, {"Title": "TV", "Author": "Tony Barragan", "ReviewID": "R11I7FKALXG18W", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Good quality', easy set to up and perfect image and sound.

For me, all I needed was a reasonable size, acceptable amount of HDMI ports (2+), and most importantly, NO SMART FEATURES!After a couple days of consideration, I decided upon this Toshiba. It's a nice package all told with a nice big picture frame. It looks great on a mount. In addition, the picture quality is pretty good and the picture presets are customizable.The only complaint I have is that the stock speakers sound a little tinny. Nothing a soundbar/subwoofer couldn't fix though.After a couple weeks with the TV, I am so far satisfied. I was in desperate need of a TV, and this definitely filled the void. All told, I easily recommend this set because of the all-around encompassing package this television provides.", "Date": "May 25, 2014"}, {"Title": "Great performance for a low price!", "Author": "Michael L.", "ReviewID": "R390LGNMGGFDDN", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This is Toshiba's latest budget-price HDTV offering in the 32-inch class and, unlike earlier generation models, it is capable of 1080p HD output.  Picture quality is quite nice out of the box, with a bright picture and strong backlight.  There are five different display modes: standard, dynamic contrast, cinema/movie, gaming, and PC.  Although it is advertised as 120Hz, the higher refresh rate is only available in Cinema Mode, and thus far I haven't really seen a difference between cinema and standard.  Response times for the TV are pretty good, making for a lagless gaming experience even in standard mode.  As a monitor replacement, it works very well, though I needed to adjust the colors a bit for it to match my desktop monitor display.  Regardless, it renders even small text with nice sharpness and clarity out of the box.Sound is quite good for standard TV speakers, with options to auto-balance for music, movies, and \"Clear Voice\" along with the default settings.  Adjustments to boost bass and treble are also available.  Regardless of the settings, though, the sound is crisp and surprisingly loud--even at low volumes, I can hear Battlefield 4 from across the house loud and clear.The included stand is reasonably sturdy.  Previous models seem to have had issues with it being a bit on the wobbly side, but I have no complaints thus far.If you're looking for internet-ready TV features, this is not the TV for you, period.  It is almost as no-frills as you can get, with no built-in web browser, Netflix, or the other apps commonly found on TVs these days.  However, if you are primarily a gamer on Xbox 360/One and PS3/4, or if you have a Roku or home theater PC for your multimedia needs, you are well set with this particular model.  MSRP seems to vary from $279.99 to $329.99, although at the time of this review, most places currently selling or taking preorders for this TV are selling it for $259.99 instead, giving it serious bang for your buck.", "Date": "May 10, 2014"}, {"Title": "Great experience", "Author": "Lori Cianciotto", "ReviewID": "R2A100PL0TGEXX", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "We have had Toshiba TV's before and have been extremely happy with them.

I love it.  This is my 2nd Toshiba. My previous one was 720 p and lasted me 6 years. It was time for an upgrade.  I'm an avid gamer and my PS4 games look gorgeous on it.  It's very simple to use and doesn't have the Smart TV features which I'm completely ok with.  I find them unnecessary with all of the gaming systems and streaming devices out there.  Movies and Netflix look amazing on it too. I use the UV Movie via VUDU and they look as great as BluRay.  The price is awesome.  I am on a budget like most people.  Every time I went to Best Buy I would be looking at the Samsung TV's.  Yes the one's that are 1000 + have a little better image, but nothing too substantial to make me want to throw down 500 more dollars. This TV is amazing and it's surprisingly way thinner than I expected. It looks very chic in my apartment.  Best Purchase in a long time..  50 inch is perfect too.  A little larger than my last and much better for the room.  The Sound not really sure if it's great or not because I use a soundbar.  I assume it's average.
