Like the Samsung LTN1735, it is a very nice TV. However, I'd prefer 1735 than this one because you can't make it sit straight up--it inlcines backward---like the Sharp E1U or EsomethingU. When I sit on the sofa to watch TV (I am a short person) I have to raise my head all the time.My ranking according to my personal preference of the 17\" 20\" LCD TVs are as follows:1. Samsung LTN2. Sharp Aquos B4U3. Toshiba4. Dell 1700 / Batesias VMT2015. Sharp E1UHaven't tried others. There certainly are better ones out there and you just need to do a little researchSome people don't like the Batesias for its average PC pic. But I feel OK. But ultimately wife bought the LTN 1765...personal preference!", "Date": "May 16, 2004"}, {"Title": "Disappointing picture quality", "Author": "M. Panjwani", "ReviewID": "R17RWN46C00S6Q", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "First, a correction - the above reviewer has mentioned that this monitor cannot be set straight up and is angled backwards. This is not correct. The screen can be set vertical and can swivel back to about 15 degrees.I researched every tv/monitor of this type and size on the internet and settled on this model. However, I ended up returning my first piece to Amazon and am in the process of returning its replacement too. The picture quality on the first one was pretty bad. The lower half of the screen was very fuzzy (both in the TV and PC monitor modes) and the colors bled. The replacement was sharper, but the colors are all off (too green and bright). I painstakingly spent 2 hours trying to tweak everything very late at night(that's when some TV stations broadcast their color test pattern that you ideally need to use), but have not been able to elimate its green cast.The set looks very sleek but of what use is it if it doesn't deliver in the picture quality department? Pass on this one. Amazon has been extemely easy to work with on these returns, but buy one locally if you must so that the process is faster.", "Date": "August 14, 2004"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": null, "Features": null, "Name": null, "ImgURL": null, "ProductID": "B00009RTP6"}}
