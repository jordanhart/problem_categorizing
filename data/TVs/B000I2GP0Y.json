{"Reviews": [{"Title": "This is a great TV", "Author": "Bob Boberson \"carrotsforcookies\"", "ReviewID": "R28FX7HM1GZTTQ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I got this TV because I got a great deal on it. It was not in my list of choices due to the fact that it was more expensive than my budget. Thankfully the other two sets I was looking at were not in stock, and ultimatly I was offered this model for 1,501. I have wanted a flat panel since they were 10-16k. I have followed trends and prices every since. When my 10yo tube died, and it came time to buy I figured it was time for a flat panel. My suggestion to people when shopping is to go look at the TV and PLAY WITH IT. Try different settings. If the salesperson gives you [...] then go somewhere else. Do NOT rely on people like Consumer Reports, or other review types. People precieve color different than others. What looks good to one may not look as good to another. For me the Hitachi is simply the best to my eyes. The connections they give are great. The remote is nice, however unlike others I don't revolve my life around a remote. Yes I have acctually seen people bag a TV because of the remote. If you read the features of this TV then compare with what is considered to be the best, or TV's in the same price range you will find the Hictachi is feature rich. The only thing I would like to see from these Manufacturers is built in DVR. As small as large capacity storage is getting this could be done, and we could all loose one box from our systems.This TV has an in depth color setup, and 3 levels of black enhancement. It also sports three HDMI connections (two in back one one the side). The upper level menu functions are available from the TV panel such as changing the channel, and menu functions. There are 3 screen savers (user selectible) to be used to help with IR. The TV is cable card ready so if your provider has this say goodbuy to the 'ol cable box. In my area if I use the cable card I save $13 a month buy getting rid of the box as the card is only $1.50 a month. You still get all of the HD and programming just without the box. The overall picture is great on this TV. HD is nothing less than awesome. SD is great on some, not so great on other channels. The not so great I blame on systems outside my TV. I had to call support because I broke my remote the second day I had the TV. After going through some steps with the support tech we found the remote was bad. They sent one to me 2nd day air no charge, no questions. THAT is service....oh did I mention I spent more time getting through the automated menu on the phone then did waiting for a tech to answer? Not that the automated menu was long, they were just THAT fast getting me connected to a live AMERICAN ENGLISH SPEAKING person....did you hear that DELL, HP, and etc.....go buy this TV.", "Date": "January 25, 2007"}, {"Title": "Better than our Panasonic or Sony- especially movies!!!", "Author": "Prof and spouse. \"psych professor\"", "ReviewID": "R2EPFZBCGJEAG", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "We have had the Hitachi for a little over a month. Our two other HDTVs are a 42\" Sony LCD rear-projection and a Panasonic 32\" LCD which we have owned (and loved!) for 14 months and a year respectively. For sports, it is a very close match between the three - I may prefer the Panasonic just a smidge but it is in a very small (and darker!) room. For broadcast TV we like all three but this one (the Hitachi) wins for reasons of flexibility and a far superior remote (imho). A lower model (the 69) was rated highly in, well, you know, but below the Pani but this model has a 16 bit processor (and picture was roughly equal with the reviewed 12 bit) and thus a superior picture and features. The case we found to be far superior for viewing purposes. We couldn't find an angle, for example, to view the Pani where glare wasn't obvious- on this one we have to TRY to find any glare. Our kicthen/dining area is directly behind us and has the brightest lights and 3 large windows. We don't see much if any glare even on sunny days (we have the set tilted down about 10-degrees from vertical on a wall mount and that helps). But the real selling point is the adjustability of the picture/color and how this set performs on movies. I teach film classes at least a few times per year at our college and I watch a LOT of movies (tough job but . . .). :) The subtlety and superiority of the picture on dvd, up-converted dvd, or HD-DVD are all very obvious (two pair of 52 and 60 year old eyes agree with this assessment). HDTV is also superior though HDTV looks so good, relatively speaking, that it is harder to tell under our viewing conditions and with present conditions (DirectTV and off-sat reception). It also doesn't seem to get nearly as hot as some reports and I've had no problem what-so-ever with \"odd\" greens as reported on a few blog sites. Having so much experience with LCDs before it did take our eyes a few days to adjust to the greater and more subtle detail of a plasma but it has been well worth the adjustment! (Our set is professionally adjusted but I found the same things to be true with my own educated guesses before adjustment!).", "Date": "January 17, 2007"}, {"Title": "Disposable electronics", "Author": "M. Carter", "ReviewID": "R2RKMD4SBWIA47", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "We enjoyed this TV while it worked.  We purchased it in January 08, had to have a service tech come fix it right away and then had to wait for Hitachi to send a firmware upgrade before we could use it.  Two years later, it plays for a minute then shuts off.  Hitachi sent another firmware upgrade, but the power won't stay on long enough to do it.  Now we have to pay for someone to come tell us whether it's worth fixing or just scrap it because it's not worth fixing.  Too bad.  I won't be buying another Hitachi, I would suggest the Sony Bravia which we've been much happier with the picture quality anyway. Customer service at Hitachi acts like they get calls about this all the time.  Seemed to know what the problem was but didn't tell me.", "Date": "February 10, 2010"}, {"Title": "Great HD TV for the money", "Author": "Robert B. Wayne", "ReviewID": "R3U6UQM7DMF8TS", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I waited a long time to get a large screen tv. At first I purchased a Sony at Sams but we hated it, it was a rear projection LCD, the picture was dark in spots. We decided that the Plasma had the best picture.This Hitachi TV in full 1080 is AWESOME with HD Cable TV. I swapped my cable box for a HD Model with HDMI output and DVI Recording, it is SWEET! Simple to use, and I have a pretty good 5.1 Surrond system, and the TV has 5.1 digital output that makes it simple. This TV has so many settings, memory options for DAY/Night Settings also. It also has 2 tuners built in for PIP, and a nice way to view up to 5 images on the screen. It also has a remote swivel that is nice for when company arrives to watch Real HDTV, not the 720 dpi that most people buy and do not consider. I only wish the cable company had cable cards instead of the box.I rate this HDTV very high on the list and absolutely no problems after a  year of ownership.", "Date": "February 6, 2008"}, {"Title": "Wow. I LOVE this tv", "Author": "Aaron J. Floyd \"masochists4\"", "ReviewID": "R1EA9DOAKNN9D3", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I love this TV. Picture is one of the best on the market.What I love:Picture quality: The picture is crisp, clear, bright, and just perfect. I looked at a couple other plasmas and a couple DLP's and LCD's and I just felt this one was the best in this size range.Features: I love the swivel stand. My apartment has a huge window and being able to swivel the stand just a inch or so can make a big difference with glare.Remote: The remote is easy to use, I like the way it lights up, I like the scroll for the volume. I do not use the channel scroll because of my Time Warner cable box remote but I imagine that would not be as easy to use as the volume would be.Looks: Except for the little silver strip on the top and bottom I think the TV is great looking. And even that is not bad.Price: For $1,799 (price paid at HHGregg with 0% for 12 months) it is an amazing value.Aspect ratio: I do now know why but not all HDTVs have the aspect ratio. They just have like a zoom button with a few different levels. A friend has a LCD 42 that has that feature and I hate it. The 42HDT79 has 4:3 zoom, 16:9, 16:9 zoom, and a few others. I just like being to readjust the screen ratio easily and properly as I switch between HD channels and regular digital channels.HDMI Inputs: This TV has 3. When I bought this in March (I think, maybe Feb.) most on the market in this range only had 2. I have a HD DVD player, PS3, and my cable box so I need at least 3.Inputs: On top of the three HDMI inputs I use I also have a Wii and occasionally an Xbox 360 so the 5 total inputs, plus a separate line for wall cable and a photo input come in handy.TV Guide: I really like the built in TV guide. The first month or two I had this tv I used basic cable and this TV guide is great. It is better than satellites and basic cables. The digital cables I use now but I still love that feature.Customer Service: I have only had to call Hitachi customer service once and while the wait was long (30-40 mins) once someone was on the phone he was helpful, polite, and friendly. One can not ask for much more than that.What I do not like:Sound: This would definitely be the one glaring weak spot. Most of my fiends with 42 TVs also have bad sound systems in them. And I understand the main purpose is a great picture but I was a little disappointed. I am working on buying a decent surround system for my apartment but still.PIP: I love that it has PIP (picture in picture), especially during football season. I hate that it requires a second tuner. I feel that should have been included.Very few cons compared to a lot of pros. And there probably are more. I will probably pick up one or two when watching it tonight that I forgot right now. Either way I love it and have been contemplating buying another just like it for the bedroom. I am torn between that an 57 DLP just because I wont need as many features (but will need TV guide since bedroom has basic cable so that will be a must) and the value of a DLP for that situation.", "Date": "September 11, 2007"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "Unavailable", "Features": "1080i high-definition display\nALiS Alternate Surface Lighting\n16% brighter panel technology\nPure HDTV Blue\nVirtual HD 1080p III video processor", "Name": "Hitachi 42HDT79 UltraVision CineForm 42-Inch Plasma HDTV Television", "ImgURL": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/5108MZZD3QL._SX300_.jpg", "ProductID": "B000I2GP0Y"}}
