After seeing several of the new plasma TV's at the local electronic stores I decided that was the route for me.  After doing weeks worth of research I was set to go with the Panasonic 42px500u.  The unit had all of the specs that I wanted: 42\", cablecard, TV Guide, VGA input, PIP and media card slots. Then I read about the new Toshiba Plasmas that were coming out in August/September.  The Toshiba 42hp95 pretty much had the same specs as the Panasonic except for the name.I went to a local electronics store that had the TV and watched it side by side with the Panasonic 42px50u.  Both had clear black levels and an unbelievable picture.  Not finding the 500u in a retail store, I went with the Toshiba.  I have not regretted it at all.First what you should expect: bright clear picture.  HD of course looks incredible.  I do have digial cable and the digital channels look extremely well but surprisingly the SD channels look great! Setup was easy and within 10 minutes of hooking up the audio/video cables I was watching HD football.Probably the biggest surprise with this TV is the quality of the built in speakers.  The speakers create a pseudo-theater sound that I was not expecting.Bottom line is that this TV is great.  Toshiba obviously spent the time to come out with a quality set that should be recognized with the plasma kings Panasonic and Pioneer.", "Date": "October 3, 2005"}, {"Title": "Guess I got the LEMON", "Author": "Janis Smith \"janster\"", "ReviewID": "R2V73YR0DY96JU", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I purchased this Toshiba 42HP95 in Jan 06. I have had constant picture problems, flickering and rolling, most recently it goes to a black screen. Toshiba has been little help. I have now had 3 TV repair guys see it. One installed an update that made it worse.Now my gorgeous when it works plasma tv is in the shop, unfortunately they didn't take my 3000.00 credit card bill with it. Today is 5/22 they said they would get around to looking at it on 5/29, good luck, that's a holiday.I wouldn't recommend this to my worst enemy.Well here's an update 7/3/06. After filing a BBB and FTC complaint, Toshiba finally replaced my defective TV,( after 4.5 weeks in the shop) with the newer model 42HP66. There are a few differences. The 66 doesn't let you change the screen size, without loosing quality, or giving you the full 42\" on non HD channels/broadcasts. Possibly one of the reasons the 95 model kept crapping out on me. The built-in channel guide is also missing (not really needed,, since the cable co provides one)Seems the bad ones were purchased at SEARS. Most other reviews loved this 95 model, those purchased at SEARS weren't so lucky.Crossing my fingers this one gives me years of good service.Way to go Toshiba for finally stepping up to the plate and replacing my set. No thanks to the guy on the phone line named JOHN!!!!", "Date": "May 22, 2006"}, {"Title": "Toshiba Sucks!", "Author": "Klaus Ahlers", "ReviewID": "R2WGQ674HNM2YL", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "The TV worked fine until just after the warranty was over.

I am a dish network installer, so i see hd flat panels everyday in customers houses.. the company i work for sells jvc and panasonic plasma and lcd tvs..  in my opinion very few of them come close to the picture quality of this set.. dont get me wrong, there are still nice sets out there, but the accuracy of the color, and the clarity of this set just cant be beat in my opinion... it looks amazing with xbox 360, and blu ray.  dishnet has some truly UNREAL content, and this set shows it in amazing plasma colors..  here it is october 2009, and it still looks as good as the day i bought it.. in my opinion, as the price of flat panel sets have come down, so has the quality.. i wouldnt hesitate to buy another toshiba plasma..", "Date": "October 6, 2009"}, {"Title": "Beautiful and Reliable", "Author": "Angel E.", "ReviewID": "R2K0RCGEZI64W7", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "We have owned this Toshiba since 2005 and it has yet to disappoint us. It has a sleek design, stereo sound, and vivid picture screen. It is also easy to program and user friendly to operate. The only problem we have had is with the remote control (believe or not) some buttons do not respond when pressed and it has so many features that when combined with our digital cable remote, it's too much feature to keep up with.

During that time it has been OK with a couple of quirky things, like low buzzing sounds when it is switched off.  The cabinet is very contemporary, the sound is very good considering the speaker grill is an inch wide and three inches deep. It has ample inputs and outputs.  In all a nice set...until exactly two months out of warranty the picture went haywire.  UPDATE - After nearly three months, Toshiba issued a full manufacturers' credit towards another TV.  The repair shop said we were extremely luck, if it were most any other brand, it would be too bad for us.  Our present TV is a Sharp Aquos LCD, and the sound and picture are not quit as good, even though the Toshiba was a much lower resolution.  (The newest Toshiba LCD's were not avaialable at the time).  Kudos to Toshiba for doing the right thing.  You have truly earned our loyalty to your brand!", "Date": "January 24, 2007"}, {"Title": "Great Tv", "Author": "F.
