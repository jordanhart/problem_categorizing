The line appeared on first start-up of the set.  Called Vizio and must say the customer support was very good.  They saw where I'd registered the set on-line using its internet connection.  They asked for pictures of the set showing the issue.  That took a couple of tries, but once they saw it, the volunteered to replace it.  So that I don't have to go weeks with no TV in the bedroom, I agreed to the option where they put a charge on my credit card, send the replacement, after it arrives I box up the \"old\" one and return it.  Then the charge is refunded to the card.  Meanwhile, the TV is serviceable enough.  Other than the defect, the picture is excellent.  As my wife pointed out, if we'd made the purchase from a brick-and-mortar store, the exchange of sets would have probably taken an hour.Some other comments about the \"A\" version stated that the Amazon button on the remote didn't work.  On this one, the \"B\" variant, the Amazon button worked perfectly, and after logging into Prime from my laptop and getting the code to register the new TV, my Prime account is accessible with one click.So, yes, I would have preferred that the TV be perfect right out of the container, but I'm pleased so far with the customer support response", "Date": "February 23, 2014"}, {"Title": "Great tv for the price", "Author": "Rini", "ReviewID": "R2E1UNQX1E4TZZ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "We researched many TV's till we found the one we wanted.

I bought it specifically because it offered good framerate interpolation, and it does an excellent job with that. The picture is exceptional as well. I'm not a detailed expert on the finer points of picture, but I can tell a good one from a not as good one, and this TV is among the best I've seen. I also didn't plan on using any of the smart features at all, since it's connected to a full HTPC, but the Smart interface is so good sometimes I just use it cause it's easier.", "Date": "May 1, 2014"}, {"Title": "Visio E390i-BO rates high", "Author": "Alan J.

Amazon did send out a replacement (it too arrive late) but onthe upside when it was all said and done this set worked.  After receiving one that was damaged I did scour the internet looking for similar issues andthere were many to be found.  However, this is about the TV not the ineptitude of shipping services,Packaging:  The box is sturdy and the foam for the top and bottom were thick but I feel they should of had a better bufferto protect the screen and back (there is a tiny 1/4\" foam piece but does not really add to the safety)Setup:  Took no more than 5 minutes and it was up and running, doing the initial TV setup took about another 5 to 10 minutesto connect it to the WiFi and setup the apps.TV:  Great picture, awesome blacks, and vivid colors.  Tested it on several Blu-Rays and several HD streams of TV.  The sound is okay, it isbetter than most flat panel TVs but it's decent.The Apps:  The Apps take a bit to load and execute but there is a wide variety to be found.  One reviewer said the Amazon Video app was not workingthey must of fixed it as mine worked well.  There is no PLEX app yet but according to their 2014 CES announcement an app is coming soon forthose using media servers in their house like myself.The Remote:  It is okay nothing to write home about it has 3 fast access buttons for Amazon / Netflix / M/GO but I wish it was backlit.", "Date": "February 17, 2014"}, {"Title": "Not what it seems", "Author": "Amazon Customer", "ReviewID": "RJPTT98NHS8LR", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I am disappointed in my choice in television.  I have wireless and Netflix stops every five minutes.  Most importantly Amazon is not on, my main purpose was to use the television as a wider screen then my laptop and using my kindle mainly for reading.  I know I have to reorientate my furniture to maximize the usage of my network and wait patiently for Amazon to be uploaded on this brand. I previously returned one that was all cracked up on the inside, I should had just stuck with my original Samsung.  The model I bought seem more advanced but the consumer could not tell because the year it came out was not indicated on all the televisions.
