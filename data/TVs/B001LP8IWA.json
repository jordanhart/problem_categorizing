Nice for kitchen, bedroom, office or small rec-room. GREAT picture!!!Includes 2 HDMI ports (1 back and 1 side), Component connections, S-Video and etc.When you program the channels on setup it picks up both analog and digital channels.You don't need a set-top cable box to get a great picture just hook the cable from the wall to the TV rf in.Hooked to an antenna the digital channels look fantastic.The sound is what you expect from a small TV...good but not great.The remote color including the buttons is very dark and hard to read in dim lighting but works great.Great little TV!!!", "Date": "May 27, 2009"}, {"Title": "It's okay but seems to have HDMI handshake problems", "Author": "K. Dommer", "ReviewID": "R3HXR0ZQ61OOK6", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "I bought this back in August on impulse at a store when the old CRT TV in my kitchen quit working one day.  I've seen better picture quality, but it's certainly not bad for a TV this size and price.  As for sound, I think it's pretty decent for a smallish TV.  Better than expected actually.  I also like the ability to upgrade the firmware using a USB flash drive.  Very handy, and I wish all non-internet enabled TVs were like this.  My slightly older Toshiba requires a memory card to upgrade the firmware.  No big deal but the USB option is quicker and easier in my opinion.My problem with this TV is that it doesn't always perform the HDMI handshake correctly with my DirecTV HD receiver (HR2x-700) and the result when this happens is a screen with a pink/purple hue and no sound.  This wouldn't be an issue if you plan to only use the TV's built-in digital tuner or use component connections instead of HDMI, but I don't.I'm no stranger to electronic gadgets and technology, so I can assure you that this isn't a case of user error.  I have two DirecTV HD receivers (HR20-700 & HR23-700) and while my other larger LCD TV (a Toshiba) has *zero* HDMI handshake problems, this one does.  I tried all the different HDMI inputs and it's not an HDMI cable problem either, as I have tried several including the one I use for the Toshiba.  While it is possible that part of the issue lies in the DirecTV receiver, the bottom line is that this problem does NOT occur with the Toshiba using the same cable and DirecTV receivers so there is clearly something different about this Philips model and how it handles HDMI.Will you have HDMI handshake problems with this TV?  You might, you might not, but at a minimum I would not recommend this TV if you plan to use it with a DirecTV HD receiver via HDMI.  I don't have a need for anything else connected via HDMI to this TV, so I can't tell you if this happens with other HDMI hardware (such as a Blu-Ray player).  This problem primarily pops up if the TV is turned on when the DirecTV receiver is already on, such as if I am watching DirecTV in the bedroom on a CRT and my wife turn this LCD on in the kitchen.  (This receiver resides in the bedroom but is shared between the bedroom and kitchen).  Recent changes to DirecTV firmware have in some ways helped the problem and in other ways made it worse.  You may say that the problem is with the DirecTV receiver then, but I will remind you that my Toshiba *never* has this problem.  Draw your own conclusions from that.  There are other DirecTV users with similar HDMI problems on certain specific TVs and I am not alone with this problem on a Philips LCD TV.  At least DirecTV listens to their customers and attempts to correct problems that only some people report (there is an online forum that allows for indirect contact with DirecTV developers and allows customers the option of testing beta versions of their firmware).  I tried contacting Philips about this problem and while they initially responded pretty quickly, they never followed up with it after they asked for more details and I provided them.  I even tried a more recent firmware update from Philips but it made no difference.I'm currently shopping for another 22\" LCD TV for the kitchen, about the biggest we have room for, and hopefully one that will work better with an HDMI connection.  At that time I will move this TV to the master bedroom (where the DirecTV receiver is) and connect it using component cables.  I will still have a comparable HD picture but this will stop the HDMI problem.  If it weren't for having the HDMI cable running inside walls to get from the bedroom to the kitchen I'd just hook it up that way now but I shouldn't have to do that anyway in my opinion.I usually save the box for months for things like this, but for some strange reason I decided to throw it out after only two days before we noticed this problem around a week later.  If I hadn't thrown out the box, I would have exchanged it for a different brand.  I guess I could have tried to exchange it for another of the same model but I'm not sure that would have helped as I think it's just a quirk in the TV's hardware and/or firmware.This review isn't so much to put Philips down, but just to warn others of some potential issues that may arise.  If you decide to purchase this TV for exclusive use with an HDMI connection, I hope it works well for you.", "Date": "November 27, 2009"}, {"Title": "Nice value", "Author": "Amazon Customer", "ReviewID": "R1TSD7BXXU7AQE", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Excellent picture quality, decent sound for its size.

I looked at this one for months at the local department store where it was displayed next to several other, similar sized TVs. The Phillips had by far the best quality picture and I planned to pick one up when the price went down. Luckily I happened to stop by when the set went on a close out sale and they had only had 3 left. So, picture wise, I like this TV better than the competition. It was simple to set up. It was refreshing to see the simplicity of the Menu after my large Sony LCD TV, which is a great TV, too, but complicated and somewhat cumbersome to manage. The sound volume is good for the small room that I have it in, and I am happy with the sound quality. This is a really nice TV and I find myself spending more time in my bedroom, as a result.18 November 2012Still loving it. The longer I live with this TV, the more I like it. It has a nice seek feature, so if you mistype, or get lazy, it will go to the active station nearest to the one that you mistyped or partially typed. If I want to go to CSPAN, for instance, I just have to type 84, not 84.201. None of my other LCD/LED TVs do this. I also have a 19\" Philips that I primarily use as a computer monitor, and it works the same on that one as well. Nice feature!", "Date": "May 26, 2010"}, {"Title": "Never Again", "Author": "MollyMoore", "ReviewID": "R2NK80MMUA4MG4", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "We purchased this tv about 1.5years ago and it stopped working. It just wouldn't turn on. In researching it, there seems to be a recurring problem with Philips televisions where the power supply board goes out shortly after the warranty is up. Philips will NOT fix it even though they know this is a problem. The customer service agent informed me it would be cheaper to purchase a new tv than to send this in to get it fixed. NEVER again will I purchase a Philips anything. I have two Vizio flat screens that work flawlessly ... think I will stick with that brand. At least I know they will work after the warranty expires.", "Date": "September 19, 2011"}, {"Title": "died after a year", "Author": "JMX", "ReviewID": "R154IQ7M7A7G5G", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I purchased this TV in spring 2011 for my bedroom. It worked great up until October of 2012. It was on in the bedroom. I turned it off and left the room. When I came back about 20 minutes later, I could hear a high pitched ringing noise. It was coming from the TV. I tried to turn it on with both the remote and the button on the back, but nothing happened: screen black, ringing noise. I unplugged the cable cord: no change. The only way to make it quit was to unplug it. I let it sit for about 10 minutes then plugged it back in, no change. When I called Philips they told me it was out of warranty and that it definitely needed repairs. I understand that 1-year warranties are standard, but I also believe that a TV is something that should last at LEAST 5 years. It just should. Also the price of this 2009 model TV as I am writing this review (Nov 2012) is about $180. For less than that I just purchased a Vizio 24\" LED TV to replace this broken one. That's a much better value. I strongly recommend you go with another TV, and for my part I will not be going with this brand again.", "Date": "November 4, 2012"}, {"Title": "So Far SO GOOD", "Author": "Tasha", "ReviewID": "R11BNA96T61DZ7", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I have to say I was quite skeptical to order something on line & this was my first time purchasing something on the internet & so far so good!!!

I turned it on leaving on the HDMI channel and let it sit. About 10-15 minutes later it turned itself off as it does when you let it sit with no input going into it. About another 10-15 minutes later I turned it on and on its right side brightly colored vertical lines appeared. I turned it off hoping those lines would go away, turned it back on same thing. The t.v. is shot to hell. Up until this point it had everyday usage and was perfectly fine. It traveled fine back and forth from campus to home during breaks and holidays. It was not hit or damaged in anyway but it just conked out. I read the reviews and apparently this is what it does. I say go for a different brand :(.
