The tv is super thin and looks great.  The picture quality is unbelievably sharp.  The sound is as good as can be expected considering all flat screens suffer with lowered quality sound.  The only negative I have seen so far is that it has an spdif coaxial output instead of a digital optical.  I just ordered a converter to resolve this issue. So now I will be able to connect it to my sound bar.  The converter is another $35.00 through Amazon. Other than that I any still happy with my purchase and would recommend it.", "Date": "August 17, 2013"}, {"Title": "Nice TV", "Author": "Jerome Hoxton", "ReviewID": "R37GO8MC1WCGA1", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "No issues whatsoever.

Less than a year, it went out. It was still covered under the Westinghouse warranty. It took 30 days to get a case number. Then it took another 2 weeks to get a RMA for me to return the tv. I had to pay for shipping which was $167. They told me it would take 10 to 15 days before they sent the replacement. I called back 20 business days later and the young man told me it was on the dock to be shipped. 8 business days later, I call back and it's back ordered by two weeks. Two weeks later, it's another 2 weeks. Then they wanted to replace it with a 55\" LCD after I reported them to the BBB and the CAG. I took the tv bc I wanted a tv in my den. I got the 55\" and it was a dud. It has too much red, the base is melted, and the model number has been cut off and a paper label with a different model number is just stuck on there and it's peeling. DO NOT BUY A WESTINGHOUSE PRODUCT!! Any company that has a social media pages stated \"WE HATE WESTINGHOUSE\" and they have valid reasons why, has to be a rip off. To get a refund for a tv I sent back and they have had for over 10 weeks should not take an additional 8 weeks to release a refund.", "Date": "March 23, 2014"}, {"Title": "I have two of them may pick up extra 2 for office.", "Author": "Marcin Kozyra", "ReviewID": "R25I7YLNY8M1DF", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I usually don't write reviews.

The speakers are in the back, and no matter how high you crank the volume it does not seem to matter.  You get a lot of color blooming discoloration (solarization) when you watch a non-HD program.  There is no regular RCA, or earphone audio output.  You have to point the remote to the left lower corner for the TV to respond to it (that is where they put the sensor instead of in the center), also you have to keep resetting the previous-channel button for it to work properly, so you can flip back and forth.  If you mis-dial a channel that don't exist, the whole screen will go blank, and you have to wait (about 20 seconds) for it to reset, it will not let you re-dial, or cancel you mistake until it is ready. There is no way to scroll the program content description if there is more info than fits in the field on the screen at one time, the information is just chopped off.  You also can't see what program is coming up next (no screen schedule).A different company must have made the 50 inch model for Westinghouse, because the design features and its remote is very different from the 40 inch Westinghouse model.  I love the 40 inch model and its remote functions!", "Date": "November 3, 2013"}, {"Title": "Worked great for 8 months then broke and warranty is useless", "Author": "Rachel Neva", "ReviewID": "R2VHTD7F3ENIRD", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I bought this TV from Target on Black Friday. 8 months later, half the screen has gone dark. Called the company about the warranty (about 3 times since they kept forgetting to call me back), they said to ship the TV to them in California. I live in Boston. FedEx told me it would cost $80 just to pack it up and I'm guessing another $150 to ship it. I'd rather buy a new TV than spend that money to ship this piece of junk. Also, my warranty card says TVs bigger than 50in qualify for in-home diagnostic and repair. Westinghouse is acting like I have a Master's degree but don't know how to read or comprehend basic instruction.

I've had nary a problem. It has ample input and output slots for various electronic devises and the picture quality is an an 8 out of 10, in my book. Sound reaches peak at about 40 with almost zero static, however the loudness factor hits a monotone, the louder it goes--an almost muffled monotone.
