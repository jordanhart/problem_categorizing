{"Reviews": [{"Title": "(updated) Thoughts After 1 Year of Use", "Author": "JDC", "ReviewID": "R1ZIB4OYDQ1A6U", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "When I purchased this TV from Amazon.com I had already decided on this Samsung 52\" series and was trying to decide between the 650 and the 750.  At the time there was a small price difference between the two on Amazon.com.  I ended up choosing the 650 because I was placing the TV inside a nook that had limited space.The 650 has a less bulky frame around the LCD screen and therefore it was only 50.2 inches wide as compared to the 750 which is 52\" wide.  Both screens have the exact same visual display area.  Beyond trying to accommodate my limited space, I felt that the smaller frame looked nicer on the TV than the larger frame.The other reason I chose the 650 is that it can swivel on the base, whereas the 750 is fixed on its base.  Because I have placed the TV in a nook, this swivel feature has come in very handy as I have had to get behind it from time to time to plug in cords, etc.I have read a lot about screen reflection and was bracing myself for a potentially unpleasant experience during daytime viewing, especially since the room the TV is in has windows all the way across two walls and is full of sunlight daily.  I'm happy to report that screen reflection is absolutely no problem.  The TV that I was replacing with the Samsung LCD was an older 32\" Panasonic Panablack analog TV with the glass screen, which had a lot of reflection.  As a point of reference, the Samsung has about 20% of the screen reflection of my old TV (judging from when the TV is off).  When the TV is on, the Samsung has about 5% of screen reflection compared with what I used to have with my old TV, which may be due to the incredible brightness of the display.I spent a number of months on this decision and I feel like I hit a home run with this purchase.  Samsung has certainly exceeded my expectations with this model and I have been very satisfied with my first experience of buying a TV online from Amazon.com.DEC 20, 2008 UPDATE: I've now owned the TV for more than 6 months.  No regrets.  The TV has survived well in a family with 5 kids under age 10.  It's taken some direct hits to the screen with toys thrown by a 2-year-old but any marks on the screen easily rubbed off.  It still looks just like the day I first got it and runs perfectly.  I'm very happy with this purchase.JUNE 7, 2009 UPDATE:  Still going strong after 1 year.  Absolutely no problems with the TV.  Best purchase I ever made.  Everyone who has seen it can hardly believe the picture quality.  I get positive comments all the time.", "Date": "June 1, 2008"}, {"Title": "Beautiful TV! From the picture to the bezel, just perfect.", "Author": "Scomel", "ReviewID": "R1ZC7I8DATDAKU", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I've had this TV since very early March. I've watched HD, SD and Blu-Ray and can not find a flaw. The 650 handles motion extremely well to where blurring and other artifacts are vitually non-existant. The AMP is a very cool feature that brings a realism to film making it seem more life-like, or as if it were originally shot on HD Video. Some have said this gives off a \"soap opera\" effect. I can see that description, but to me it makes film based DVD's and movies look more like your watching a real-life play, viewing it through a window. It's a very cool effect!I understand people's concern's with the glossy screens found on plasma and some LCD's. This screen is slightly less reflective than Samsung's 71 series but can still be a problem for some. It would be nice if there was an easy solution for this but there's not. Sony and other makers use a matte type of screen that certainly helps or eliminates the problem but introduces other negatives. I find colors and blacks just don't \"pop\" on matte screens and tend to wash out more for off-angle viewing. The 650 has a picture with great depth and color from any angle, greatly adding to the immersion effect.Much talk has been about the TOC bezel. I think Samsung has hit it out of the park with this. I absolutely love the red. I think it adds just a touch of class. It sets this tv apart from all others(though the picture quality already does this) while still being very subtle and retaining the ability to blend in with any decor. Most people who've come to my home do not even notice the red until I point it out. I'm a little tired of every set looking the same with either a piano black bezel or flat black. This is a very welcome change.I like many other suffered the shut-off issue. As has been mentioned it appears Samsung has fixed the issue with a firmware update. I've updated the FW and so far so good. It was annoying but not a huge deal to me. Samsung should be commended for how quickly they addressed the issue. I received several calls from upper level officials that were very concerned with my problem. I've never had this level of service from any other manufacturer. Well done Samsung! A side effect of the FW update is that the AMP processing received a boost. Before the FW update I usually had AMP on low at all times and would occasionally put it on High. Now, I still use it at the low setting most times but will put it on Medium occasionaly, and find the High setting a bit much for me. I can put it on High without most of the annoying artifacts people have desribed the 71 series has, which is nice, nut the actual effect is bit much for me.Overall, this is best the LCD on the market. I can't see Sony or any of the other manufactures making a better TV this year. They may match it perhaps, but certainly won't surpass it. For those that were on the fence waiting to buy until the shut-off issue was fixed, your wait is over. Buy with complete confidence and enjoy one of the best TV's out there!", "Date": "April 5, 2008"}, {"Title": "My research concludes this is #1 - Auto-off Problem Resolved", "Author": "G.

After watching them all side by side, I dropped Sony off the list as it is simply not worth the price & it wasn't as bright as the other two.  And since I had owned a Panasonic EDTV for last 4 years, I was ready to test waters with an LCD TV. After watching the picture quality of the Samsung 6 series, I was blown away. I can confirm to you that this unit offers the best picture quality in LCD, bar none.  Also, it comes really close to the Pioneer Kuro in black levels.A few basics. I have used all HDMI 1.3 connections. I have an Onkyo TX-SR705 A/V receiver which is great.HD Content from DirecTV with DVR  - Watching HD content from DirecTV is pure pleasure to eyes. Eventhough I am sitting just 7-8 feet from this huge TV, I see breathtaking picture quality that I did not notice in any other HDTVs.Blu-Ray on PS3 - I downloaded a few HD trailers from Sonystoreonline using my PS3 and also watched Spider-Man3 on Blu-Ray. This was simply spectacular.Non-HD content - I am quite disappointed with the quality of picture with non-HD content on this TV.  My old Panasonic plasma did a much better job at this. My only hope is that most channels would make the switch to HD in the coming years.120 Hz experience - May be its me but I couldn't see a visible difference between keeping this feature on versus off.6 series versus 7 series - The extra pre-loaded content and a better integrated speaker weren't worth $400 premium for the 7 series. I would suggest you stick to the 6 series. But watch out the amazon price fluctuations, you shouldn't be paying more than $2270 for the 6 series.White Glove Delivery - The CEVA shipping took about 7 business days and I had to be proactively calling them to schedule the delivery and track shipments. A lone fellow showed up at my doorstep struggling to lift the TV up my front porch. I had to help him bring the TV inside. Onbce he got in, after a little effort in helping me place the TV on the stand, I could see his desperation to leave. Hence, I had to sign him off and call a pal in to help me with the rest. I am satisfied with this service but not super-excited like some others.", "Date": "August 6, 2008"}, {"Title": "Wow - now that's a picture !", "Author": "Turbo Tony", "ReviewID": "R3Q1JAV50FNLQB", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I hesitated buying this TV until I read that a firmware update fixed the shut-off issue. I bought mine today - hooked up a Samsung (DVD-HD860)unconverting DVD player (HDMI) and Wow. The DVD player is only a 1080i - I'm gonna get the 1080p version or wait for Blu-Ray (read below). The picture on this TV is simply amazing. If you're thinking about this TV, just do it. I've been researching and waiting for 3 months. Incredible PQ. HD channels look great and DVDs are fantastic. I'll be getting a Blu-ray player as soon as the new versions come out later this summer (I hope).I played a home movie DVD that I made and saw colors and detail I hadn't seen in the same movie on another (DLP)TV/DVD player.BTW, I called Samsung for the firmware update - the gal told me it would be harmful to my TV unless it had the shut-off problem and advised against it.To say the least - I'm impressed. Strong buy recommendation here. I just hope my initial enthusiasm isn't ruined by any problems down the road.There is some glare from a large bay window on the wall perpendicular to the TV (if I'm watching TV, the window is on my right hand side) - but it's not terrible when the TV is displaying something. If it's blank, the darn thing almost looks like a mirror (during bright daylight).Nice styling on the TV also. Comes with a cloth to keep the bezel clean and finger-print free.Oh, and playing-back (JPEG) pictures using the built-in USB drive and slide-show with music - I'm seeing my high res photos jump-out at me. Wow.Not sure what the Ethernet port is good for yet. Perhaps some future functionality. Can't even use it for firmware upgrades I believe.Good luck with your purchase decision. I'm very pleased so far with mine.If you have any questions, feel free to ask. I'll be as honest and objective as I can. Heck, I'm an engineer  - I can't lie ! Wish they had a 58 inch model ( my DLP is a 61 inch and I'm trying to get used to a \"smaller\" screen now). I haven't even played around with most of the settings ( AMP ? what's that do? ) - but I'll be experimenting over the next few days. My wife told me while I was raving about the golf on TV \"Golf ALWAYS looks good on TV\" - so I guess I need to see another sporting even with faster action to comment further :-)TTTwo week update: Installed the firmware upgrade. Hasn't shut-off since (yet).The picture on this TV is like looking thru a picture window at the image - sports or movies - incredible clarity and colors. I have not seen a better picture anywhere.

There is an inherent problem with the model I purchased, which is the television turns on and off repeatedly in rapid succession.  This obviously renders the television set useless.  It was impossible to fix this problem on my TV by downloading the suggested update becuse the television will not power on long enough to load the update. Samsung refuses to be proactive in addressing this issue. This Samsung \"wait and see\" attitude inconveniences customers such as myself who have to wait upwards of two weeks while the part is ordered by their service contractor prior to scheduling a repair date.  Customers are further inconvenienced by having to take a day off from work to accommodate the scheduled repair date.  Obviously Samsung's position is that it makes much more fiscal sense to place this burden on the consumers as opposed to recalling the sets prior to end user purchase.  When it comes to discretionary spending consumers do not like to be inconvenienced, especially in today's economic climate.  When I voiced my complaints with Samsung's customer support staff my impression was that they felt the only reason I was complaining was because I am without the television during the holiday season (kids at home, bowl games, etc.).  While the timing certainly magnifies the problem, under no circumstances do I feel that this business practice is acceptable.  Prior to the malfunction of the set I was extremely satisfied with the quality of your product.  I felt I had made a wise decision concerning the purchase.  My experience with the customer support and repair process has diminished my satisfaction with the product.", "Date": "December 29, 2008"}, {"Title": "Fantastic TV...", "Author": "Amazon Customer", "ReviewID": "R1NZ3BSST83MXZ", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I buy a lot of stuff on Amazon and always look at the personal reviews so I thought it was time I did a review myself.  I love this TV!  I've only had a week now but so far it's been fantastic. I was really on the fence about this TV and was thinking of waiting for the new Sony XBR6 thru 8 to come out and compare before buying. My biggest issue with the Samsung was the big glossy screen and I have several large windows behind the couch that I was afraid would cause a terrible reflection.  I'm very pleased to tell everyone that is worried about this as well that it really isn't  a problem The screen is so bright itself that you hardly see any reflections. If you watching a very dark movie during the day you might have some small problems with it because if the screen is showing black that is the one time when you get some reflection. Either way it's definitely not something that should cause you problems or concern. The reason I didn't wait for the new Sony is because whenever Sony comes out brand new their TV's tend to be very expensive. I would of loved to get the 55\" XBR8 when it comes out but it mostly likely will be about $5,000.00 to $6,000.00. I was able to get this Samsung for $2,199.00 from Circuit City! It's actually a pretty wild story on how this came about , I'll tell it only because I think other people might benefit from it.I went to Best Buy to get this TV because it was on sale for $2,399.00 but it turned out that it wasn't in stock and they wouldn't get it in for about 5 days.  I didn't want to wait so I called Circuit City while there and they had it in stock. The B.B. salesman didn't want to lose the sale so he took $150.00 off the price for me to wait. I bought it but then went to Circuit City and asked them if they would match the price. At first they said they would only do it if it was an advertised price (company policy) but I pushed it a little and asked for a manager. It didn't make any sense to me that they would match an ad price but not an actual sales receipt from their competition. Finally the manager said he would beat the price by $50.00.  I got the TV there and drove it home myself- plus I got 3 free Blue Ray movies because of a promotion they were running. The crazy part of this story is when I went back to B.B. to cancel the order and get a refund the salesman asked if there was anything they can do to keep the sale- I said no but then he offered me another $200.00 off!  Now I didn't really want to deal with having to take a TV back to C.C. so I said no- but man, it was very tempting. Both these stores offer free returns at no cost within 30 days which is the only reason why I purchased there vs. Amazon. Well, that's my price story- hopefully it benefits someone else out there.Either way you'll love this TV. The picture is incredible. My only complaint about the TV is the sound. I used to have a Sony LCD rear projector which had very good sound out of speakers on the sides of the TV. I'm assuming most LCD's and Plasma flat panels have the sound coming out the back to keep the size down. The problem is I didn't even think about this and I have the TV sitting in a built in wood cabinet. Because the sounds is going into the cabinet the sound echos.  I know that most people will be using a home theatre set up for this TV but I sometimes actually prefer to just listen to normal TV with the TV speakers. I can't do this anymore and we'll need to run all sound through the audio receiver. Not a big deal but wanted to point it out in case anybody else had the same issue.", "Date": "August 4, 2008"}, {"Title": "Great TV (no, actually BEST TV), Great CEVA Service", "Author": "BK of PA", "ReviewID": "R50FM8B4CUMIX", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I was initially taken aback from all the 5 * reviews at amazon.

This is the best LCD TV with the most flexible connectivity options. Picture is breathtaking. I did not have a SAT and my HD Receiver was outdated and I was still enjoying the picture. HOWEVER, when I received my latest SAT HD receiver, I simply can't take my eyes off the TV when viewing Discover HD, CBS HD, CNN HD...so on. DVDs play great.

Since the family was all here we did not do anything more than set it on a stand and hook it up to out satellite box via coax. We all were thrilled with the picture. It was not until the second week in Jan. that my wife and I hung it on the wall and began to connect components to it using RCA cables. The rear RCA jacks only produce a fuzzy black and white picture. The side RCA jacks work fine. Also the Samsung Wireless Info-link (that you must purchase separately) does not work.So I started calling Samsung's customer service number. After folowing their sugestions for a week or so I finally convinced them I had a real problem. In order to use my components I have to keep connecting them to the side and disconnecting something else. On Jan. 27 they Finally issued a repair order and gave me a phone number of the repair shop that I was to call to set up a time for them to come and service my TV, which I did. The repair man said I was outside their service territory and that I should call Samsung back. I called Samsung back and was told the problem would be assigned to their Service Dispatch Team who would be calling me in a few days. After a week and 1/2 passed I called Samsung again and was told they wrer working on the problem.The next day I called Amazon.com to complain and see if they could maybe help me with getting Samsung to do something. It was then I found that had Samsung not given me the run-a-round for so long Amazon would have simply replaced the TV. But now I wasd a week past that time.Amazon customer service made a three-way call with me to Samsung. At that time i found that Samsung had simply cancelled my repair order due to inactivity!!! I was issued a new repair order number and had to start over.The customer sevice person at samsung gave me the phone number of the repair shop that refused to work on my TV the first time. When I informed him of this he said he would assign it to their Service Dispatch Team. Sound familiar? So by this time I was steamed. Yesterday I wrote the following email to Samsung's Consumer Complaint Dept : \"I have been calling since before Jan. 27 about my TV problems (rear rca jacks and Wireless Info link which have not worked since the start.) and finally on JAN 27 a repair order was issued (4003102008).

I called Samsung back and was told it would be assigned to the service dispatch team and they would be getting back with me in a few days.I gave them well over a week and called back yesterday and found that no progress had been made about getting my TV fixed.And today I found my repair order has been cancelled. I have to start over!!!! New repair order4003109377.The old one was cancalled due to inactivity!!! The service guy wanted me to call Action TV again!!!So today I called my dealer, Amazon.com, and found that since Samsung has been giving me the run around I am now a week past the time that Amazon would have just exchanged the TV with a new one for me!!!!I am very unhappy with the level of service I am receiving from Samsung. I researched Samsung before I purchased and found you had a great reputation.\"This is the reply I received today:\"For any inquiries regarding an existing service request, please call 1-800-SAMSUNG to speak to a live agent who can assist you. Please have your transaction number ready when you call.\" This answer puts me right back on the same treadmill. I wonder why they even give you the opportunity to complain via email?

There is small issue with flashlights and clouding, but not too noticeable.  When I watch sports, my experience drops to 7/10 due to motion blur. Mainly this is NBA. Will it happen with other sports as well? Not as pronounced with the NFL, but it still is not as crisp as I like. MLB is fine, as well as Indy car racing. Tennis has a little blur on the ball. This is because it is tennis.  With AMP on, there are serious issues with vapors and Triple Ball effect (where the football is thrown, the ball splits in three.)  I need to sit 14 ft away to not see the blur, which is impossible at this house. Yet, at 14 feet, the pq still is amazing and blur is 99% non-existent. I decided to return the set due to this issue.Here is my analysis of the 52a650. I will start with the cons. There is a slight issue with my current TV with flashlights/clouding. However, turning energy saver to high reduces the issue. It is not as glaring as first TV I had. As far as clouding goes, it is similar to 5271- not a big issue.  I have seen some vapor issues with AMP on, low to high.  Some NBA replays and Groundhog Day. Vapors are less noticeable on TNT than ESPN. Comparing to the 5271, Vapors are less on TNT, similar to more on ESPN. There is no TBE even when AMP is on high- Cowboys game/other football games. This is dramatic improvement over the 5271. There is more blurring, though slight, of the tennis ball  with AMP on. With baseball, the ball slightly splits and has artifacts with AMP on.  As for positives, bluray was spectacular. MI 1 and 2 both looked sharp and handled motion scenes excellently. DVD of Batman Begins looked terrific. DVD of FOCKERS looked all right.  Lost in HD looked fantastic. Leno is smooth. And I really can tell a difference between the 5271 and the 52a650 when it comes to sports motion blur. Both NFL and NBA games are crisper with significant less blurring around fast motion plays. This is worth the price for me. NBA finals looked very crisp, even at 9 ft. I am not saying it is perfect.  I think TNT is better than ESPN when it comes to picture quality.So for this TV, high ratings all around. Based on prelim research, it seems that the following are the best for the LN52A650:Bluray and DVD- Movie, AMP offDISH HD Movies and TV- AMP- off or low,  MovieNBA, NFL- AMP High, Standard or MovieMLB, Tennis, NHL, soccer, probably golf- AMP off and Standard or MovieI used cNet's Movie calibration setting for this TV.Points to Realize: The so called problems of this TV are few and far between. Let us say I watch on ideal setting.With sports, crisp picture, little to no blur, maybe a vapor or artifacts with AMP on, nice and bright.With DISHHD- crisp picture, great contrasts of bright and dark, good smooth motion handling, maybe a vapor with AMP on. It is not perfect, I might see some bright spots on the sides (clouding/flashlights)  The huge majority of the time it is stellar.With PS3 movies, same as above, just better. Amazing blu-ray quality! Might see some bright spots during dark scenes. It is not perfect. It still is amazing. A possible vapor every once in a while, though this happens with AMP on.It seems higher AMP gives movies and TV shows more \"soap opera effect\"  Does it do anything for sports? I think that AMP on high for NBA increases smoothness, but introduces vapors every once in a while. For NFL, it increases smoothness; have not noticed problems with artifacts. A possible vapor in a fast play.One option if brightness (clouding/ flashlights) in dark scenes is bothersome is to use ES on high. This reduces the issue significantly. This possibly takes away from lighter scenes though. Does the HD detail get lost if this happens? Also, having some lights on in the room could possibly reduce the issue, as you will not see the blackness as much. This really is not much of an issue.All in all, a wonderful TV, and the best LCD for the buck on the market today. If you want to get the best LCD has to offer, go with this TV.

Naturally, the Pioneer PRO 110FD was at the top of my list.  However, at $4,200 as an open box locally, it wasn't going to end up in my home.  I then started looking at the next best thing, the top-of-the-line Panasonics (800U and 850U).  After deciding on the 850, I was at the store making final comparisons to the 110 and I wasn't impressed.  That's when I noticed a TV next to the 850 that was blowing it away...the Samsung LN52A750.  The 750 was rivaling the 110.  I was stunned.After a little research, I found out that the LN52A650 has the same panel as the 750.  The only differences were the speakers, some pre-loaded content (art, cooking, etc.), and the design of the frame.  Speakers aren't that big of a deal, especially if you plan on getting a surround sound set up.  Pre-loaded art?  I actually saw a demo of this...couldn't imagine why anyone would sit and watch it.  The frame would be a matter of personal preference.  The 750's frame is flat, squared off, and larger (wider).  The 650's frame curves back a little at the top and bottom, has a slightly curved bottom edge, and is slimmer.  The stand is oval versus rectangular on the 750.  I chose the 650 mainly because of the frame and stand, although the $200 savings over the 750 didn't hurt.My digital/HD feed won't be set up for a couple of days, but basic cable looked very good.  Color, contrast, etc. all looked great.  I didn't watch any sports (football doesn't start for a couple of months), but motion on action shows and commercials was displayed fine; no judder was noticeable to me.  Knowing a digital/HD feed is preferred, I expect the picture to only get better.  My PS3, connected via HDMI, was stunning.  The 650 had no problem with any of the fast motion of the games.  BluRay's were equally as stunning.  And with regards to black, this TV has deeper blacks than most plasmas, including the Panasonics.  The blacks were on par with the 110, which is known for its blacks (hence the \"Kuro\" name).Oh, and all of this was out of the box.  I was too excited about getting it to take the time to tune it.  I've read that this TV generally requires few adjustments out of the box to get it set at optimum settings, but I'll find out for myself tonight when I tune it.A lot of the reviews I read of this TV seemed to slam the remote.  Honestly, I had no problem with it.  The buttons are large, clearly marked, and backlit.  Back lighting is great to someone like myself who previously didn't have backlit remotes and had to memorize botton locations.  The \"wheel\" that seems to get most of the complaints isn't that bad.  I don't have an iPod or any similar device, so rotating a wheel isn't second nature to me; however, I had no trouble using it on the remote.  After a couple of times playing with it, I was adjusted to its sensitivity and it became pretty easy to use.A final note on Amazon (the seller) and CEVA/Eagle (the shipping company).  Both are great.  Amazon had an unbelievable price and shipped it the day I purchased it.  It arrived a day before their estimated arrival date.  CEVA called the night before and arranged to call me half an hour before their arrival (ie. no sitting around for hours waiting for them to show).  I had wanted to inspect the TV to make sure it wasn't damaged during shipping before I signed for it.  Before I could even mention that, the delivery guy said they wanted to open the box and plug in the TV to make sure everything was okay before I signed.Overall, I would highly recommend the Samsung 650A, as well as getting it from Amazon.  You won't be disappointed in any respects.UPDATE: After having the TV for a couple of weeks, I'd like to add the following.  First and foremost, I love this TV.  Every time I watch it, I am amazed at the picture this TV generates.  With DirecTV, the SD picture looks really good.  The digital feed is noticeably better than the regular cable feed; I would expect the same would be true for a digital cable feed.  The HD is great; nothing compares.I tweaked the settings slightly based on CNET's recommendations for HDMI1 (DirectTV).  The difference is a little hard to notice, but there.  I still think the out-of-the-box settings for this TV are really good.  In fact, I use them for HDMI2 (PS3).  I do this for gaming, where I find the out-of-the-box settings to be perfect.  I would prefer to watch BluRays with settings identical to the TV settings, but I don't want to change them everytime I switch from gaming to movies.  Ultimately, I'll probably get a dedicated BD/DVD player since you can adjust the settings for each input individually.", "Date": "July 9, 2008"}, {"Title": "W-O-W, simply amazing", "Author": "I. A.

I've loathed LCDs ever since I've had a plasma.  When I went out to look for a new TV, I was focused on getting another plasma.  I went to a couple of local stores, and found that this Samsung LCD was just so bright.  It was much brighter than any plasma, and the blacks were blacker as well (because of the added contrast).  So if you're worried that this LCD can't possibly compete with a plasma, let me reassure you of it's torch brightness, and very BLACK blacks.But don't take my word for it.  The proof is in the pudding.  I'm quite confident that if you actually see the 650 at a store, you'll come to the same conclusion that I did.  As much as the purists like to say that accurate colors or perfect white balance are what it takes to make a great display, in my opinion, it's all about brightness and contrast.  When you see a sunset that you perceive as sun-bright, against a backdrop of a dark violet sky within which you can actually make out the dark details, you know you've found your perfect display.Pros:- Torch bright- Black blacksCons:- Unlike a plasma, this display does not yield the same quality at all horizontal angles.  If you aren't watching it dead center, it doesn't have the same punch.  This shouldn't be a problem, because the 650 comes with a stand that swivels from side to side.  But if you're flat mounting it, and someone is watching off angle of more than perhaps 15 degrees, they'll notice.  It's not nearly as bad as a DLP rear projection TV, but it is perceptible as a lightly washed out picture.- The TV is very slow to start up.  If I have the input set to my PC (via DVI), it takes 11 full seconds from power ON press to seeing the desktop on the LCD.  In contrast, my five year old Pioneer did the same thing in perhaps 5 seconds.  So this is excessive.I'm still giving this 5/5 stars because the cons are pretty minor compared to the unbelievably satisfying picture experience.I also want to add that the CEVA delivery experience was the best I've ever had.  My old plasma was delivered (from Dell) by one guy dragging it to my front door.  From there, I had to unpack and test, after the delivery guy was gone.  In contrast, CEVA delivered this LCD with two guys carrying it into my family room, taking it out of the box, and allowing me to attach it to my PC for some initial testing... amazing.  Amazon.com/CEVA really hit it out of the park on the purchase experience.

This TV has fairly major \"input lag\", the delay between the time it receives a video signal and when it displays that signal on the screen. In standard video modes, there is a bit less than 1/10th of a second delay, which may not seem like much but is enough to make console gaming extremely frustrating for some people, especially for games that require \"lightning reflexes\" (rhythm games, first person shooters). While some games (Rock Band, Guitar Hero, etc.) can be calibrated to compensate for this lag, many cannot be.The \"Game Mode\" on the TV is designed to help reduce this lag, and it does reduce it significantly. But this mode comes at a huge cost... the picture quality cannot be adjusted *at all* while in Game Mode, and it defaults to extreme levels of brightness, contrast, and sharpness, making the picture look, in my opinion, absolutely awful. I could not stand gaming with these picture settings as everything appeared pixelated and oversaturated.A Google search for \"a650\" and \"input lag\" will bring up additional information about this problem, but I haven't seen it discussed often enough in these comments, and as a gamer, I wish it had been. I'll be returning this TV likely in favor of a Sony, since by all accounts they have the least input lag of the major LCD brands. The Samsung likely has a better picture, but as a gamer, I need a TV that can handle gaming as well as movies and TV viewing.I hope this helps some fellow gamers not to fall into a similar \"trap\".

You will get the highest quality TV on the market, and it won't cost as much as some of the other name brand TVs.I did a lot of research before buying a TV like this. I wanted a TV that would be worthy of blu-ray, the PS3, and HD cable. I looked into plasma, projection, and LCD TVs. I looked at reviews from numerous places. I compared TVs in stores, and compared specs online. This TV consistently came on top, so I ultimately went with it, and I made the right decision.First of all, let me tell you about black. Black is a relative thing. If you turn out the lights at night and cover your eyes, that is a good approximation of true black. If you were to turn on most LCD TVs now, just with a black screen, they would look white in comparison. Now this TV isn't perfect, there is still some light leakage, but it would be a dark gray. When I compared the TV in stores, I could tell how good it was. When the demo video went to a black screen between clips, this TV looked like it had turned off, while the other TVs had a more traditional LCD \"black\" screen look. This excellent black level contributes greatly to the experience of movies in dark scenes.Now let's talk about clarity. The picture on this TV is so clear, the first time I plugged in my new HD cable box, it seemed more like a window than a TV. The algorithms in this TV make even standard definition content look great, but high def content looks amazing. If you've heard people tell you not to get blu-ray because it doesn't look much better than a DVD, it's because they are not using this TV. But you definitely don't need to throw away your DVD collection when you get this TV. The clarity and quality of the picture get enhanced by this TV, and you'll notice details that you didn't know were there. When you apply these enhancements to blu-ray, it is as good if not better than watching a movie in a theater.Now, why the LN52A650 rather than the LN52A550 at a lower price? What you get in the 650 model is the 120Hz refresh with an algorithm to interpolate frames. This may not seem like a big deal, but it does produce a more compelling and engaging experience. It's hard to put your finger on it, but it just looks better. I personally have vision very sensitive to low refresh rates, and I find this TV much more comfortable to watch. The added price of the 650 is well worth the enhanced quality.All of the fancy features of the TV (infolink, etc) are not important. They are just feature candy. With or without them, this TV would still be by far the best you can buy. It is about picture quality, and this TV exceeds all expectations. In fact, I normally use the TV on fairly low quality settings to save power, and it is still by far the best TV quality I have seen.My recommendation for you if you are considering this product is to go visit your local Best Buy and look at the HDTV selection, and see if they have this TV. If they do, look at it for a while. Compare it. You will see how excellent the picture quality is. Then come back to Amazon and buy it, since the price is better here and you get great white glove delivery.Oh, and don't worry about the \"touch of red\" if it doesn't match your decor. You can barely tell that it's there. It's not nearly as well defined as it looks in the pictures online.", "Date": "July 14, 2008"}, {"Title": "More than I expected!", "Author": "Jeff W.

Shortly after receiving it and my HDMI cable , I connected the PS3 to try out Ratchet and CLank:Future Tools of Destruction.

It's so crisp and smooth it makes you realize exactly what they mean when they said the PS3 was the future of gaming.

It was sheer luck and it is a replacement for the 71 Series, hands down. I still need to go in and do some manual settings, but for now, Ratchet & Clank, and even Heavenly Sword, are hands down spectacular on this display.

Song", "ReviewID": "R2FD3R1VES4M8X", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "First I would like to mention the delivery service with CEVA was excellent!  I ordered the TV through Amazon on 4/23/2008 (Wed) and received an email for delivey scheduling which was received on 04/25/2008 (Fri) 8am.  If I had checked my email that morning I might have been able to schedule the delivery for that day and enjoyed the TV during the weekend.  But I found the email late in the afternoon and scheduled a delivery for 04/28/2008 (Mon).  Delivery was prompt and on time and even gave me a 1 hour notice phone call before they came by.  They were curtious and very professional.I have been waiting and waiting to buy a HD LCD TV and I am so glad I waited to buy the LN52A650.  Like every one says this is an amazing TV!  I cannot stress enough how great the picture looks.  It is just breath taking when I watch HD broadcast (especially sports) and up convet DVD movies through PS3(did not have chance to watch Blu-ray yet).  The default setting of the picture was a bit too bright for me so I played with the setting a bit and got the picture that I wanted.  One thing that I notice is improvement in AMP feature when comparing to LNT5271FN.  I have not seen any TBE in this one but I do remember seeing some TBE in LNT5271FN when I was in BB to compare the two.  I've read that Samsung released a new firmware for LNT5271FN that minimize TBE but I was not able to compare.I think Samsung's philosophy of thinking that a TV set is also a furniture when turned off really paid off.  I just love the contemporary look of the Touch of Color design on the 650.  Just having this TV set displayed in the living room makes the room so cool!!! The red is almost not noticable when the room is dark.  But when the room is bright or if you have sun light coming through then the red becomes more noticable which i think is just fabulous.I think quite a lot of people are comparing and deciding whether if they should buy LNT5271FN or LN52A650 just like i did.  As most of you know both TVs do have issues.  5271 has the dead pixel issue and the 650 has the auto reset (turn on/off) issue.  If you think about these issues, it made sense to me that the 650 issue is a minor one compared to the 5271.  I have not seen any auto resets happening to mine yet.  However, even if I do see one I can just make frimware update and the issue is solved.  The dead pixel issue on the 5271 was more serious because you needed to exchange the LCD panel which is major change and very time consuming.  Also, just by comparing the specs it made sense to buy the 650 because of the improvement in the picture quality (Dynamic contrast ratio, increased color range...etc) compared to 5271.  The question is do I really notice the difference in this when I watch TV??? probably not since the human eye can only detect a limited quantity of colors.  But, I still recommend the 650 because I do see an improvement in AMP which did bother me on 5271.  Yes, the 650 does cost a bit more than the 5271 when I compare the price in Amazon (roughly $200~$300) but I think it is well worth the extra bucks.I'm excited to watch my first Blu-ray movie tonight on my NEW DREAM TV!!!  (Will post reviews or coments after watching Blu-ray)Update:I bought my first Blu-ray movie \"300\" and watched it last night. I have to say I am extremely satisfied with the picture quality, especially the movement with AMP turned on.When I watched \"Pirates: Dead Man's Chest\" on 5271 in BB, I noticed a lot of TBE when AMP was set on High.  On 5271 the TBE did reduce when AMP was turned off or on Low setting, but you lose the crisp edge cutting 120Hz picture effect (some call it \"Soap Opera\" effect) which is a main reason why you buy 120Hz LCD TVs.  Of course since I did not watch the same movie with mine it's hard to say if TBE was gone in 650.  However, in battle scenes in \"300\" when movment is pretty fast, I was not able to see any TBE issues even with AMP on High.This is totally my personal opinion but I think Samsung weakened??? the AMP setting on 650 comapred to 5271 to get rid of the TBE issues or at least that is how I feel after watching blue-ray movies.  For example I felt that the AMP High setting on 650 is more equivalant to Medium setting in 5271 and so on which explains why I have not seen TBE yet.  This does not mean that the picture looks bad in 650.  For me, the AMP High setting on 5271 was too strong and took away the cinema feel when watching movies and gave a feeling that peolple were floating and gliding around when moving because it was TOO smooth.  In 650 you still see the AMP effect but it tends to be a bit less stronger(but strong enough to give the 120Hz feel) which is actually what I prefer.", "Date": "April 30, 2008"}, {"Title": "Simply OUTSTANDING! (Samsung LN52A650)", "Author": "Stuart Floyd", "ReviewID": "RAB77J9O9WUZL", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "What a outstanding picture, clarity, color and shear SCREEN SIZE!  This is what Blu-Ray movies are meant to be seen on and you can actually get the tru clarity and in some movies see a huge difference over standard DVD's.  That said just watching TV whether standard or even better HD channels are wonderful, enjoyable day or night.I went with the 650 over the 750 and 850 one for cost, two for \"Auto Volume Control\".  That is where you have an option of two settings that will keep the volume almost uniform between tv shows and commercials.  Why is that important to me. I hate LOUD noises or commercials and let me tell you ALL commercials on TV are set at a higher volume to force you to listen or notice a product or service.  Of course I often would just mute or have to lower the volume in btwn.  This set does it for me and I don't have ringing in my ears or have to jump to get the remote.  For me that was a clincher.The 750 and 850 models are thinner and lighter in weight but basically all have the same functions but if weight or space are an issue you can spend more on the 750/850 models.  I have noticed now after the holidays that all of them of course are lower in price as that is always the case.  They have to make room for the latest models that are usually out in late February or early March.As for glare, I virtually notice none, if you have the TV near bright lights or windows, one close the blinds/shades and two you have a Dynamic, Standard, and Movie settings which has to do with day and night time watching on the Samsungs.  Everyone has different likes and such with brightness, color etc, so it is easy to play with the settings to tune the visual just as you like it or your family.I recommend this TV or any of the Bravias in this size, LG, Panasonic, and even Sharp Aquos I thought was not as good as this Samsung.  This is my second Samsung and once again a hands down winner.Key things you must do is go to the Best Buy, Circuit City or wherever you have a wide selection of brands and look at them all side by side.  Do your reading of reviews on the store sites, Amazon and look for pro reviews too.  When you are going to spend $1,500, $2,000, $2,500 on an item do your reseach and get what YOU personally like and what looks best to your eyes.This TV at 50000 to 1 a 4MS response time and true 120Hz is outstanding.  Remember 99% of cable companies broadcast at 60Hz and this TV will tell you onscreen what the Hz is when you change channels and such.  The only thing I have had at true 120Hz have ben blu-ray movies via my Playstation.  I look at it as I have the latest technology but the industry hasn't caught up yet.  for example I am on Time Warner Cable and there HD boxes only output at 1080i at 60Hz that won't be changing anytime soon for them.  Regardless the movies, the TV the games are simply WOW by anyone who has been to my home and seen any of the games, movies or TV programs.  My TV is connected via the net and I pipe music from my PC through the receiver and look at all my thousands of photos using this awesome huge screen.As for the touch of red around the TV itself, I read people complaining about it.  I virtually don't notice it unless I am dusting off the TV, otherwise it is very minimal and just such a non issue, or it should be.  It certainly won't clash with any decor being it is so subtle. Here is a more detailed list of the abundant features and I have a proline Onkyo TX-NR906 Receiver running everything with the desktop computer for optimal performance and control.TV FEATURES: ***(Below is a compilation of information from Samsung and other external sights to provide you very detailed specs)*****ToC (Touch of Color): Samsung's new Touch of Color design features a hint of amber color naturally blended into the traditional piano black frame of the Samsung 650 Series LCD television.**HDTV Tuner: The TV has built-in over-the-air HDTV (ATSC) and Digital Cable (QAM) tuners, so you don't need a separate set-top box to receive and decode over-the-air HDTV/SDTV or unencrypted Digital Cable signals.**Native Resolution: The television has a display resolution of 1920 x 1080. The HDMI and component video inputs will accept 1080p, 1080i, 720p, 480p, and 480i (component only) signals and will display them as 1920 x 1080. The television features a full HD 1920 x 1080p digital format converter for all inputs.**Ultra Clear Panel: Samsung's Ultra Clear panel provides a bright, clear, colorful and overall more vibrant picture.

Auto Motion Plus calculates the image between frames and inserts it, creating a non-repetitive transition from one to the next. The result is a clearer picture than ever before.**4ms Response Time: One of the most important features for an LCD panel is the pixel response time. Response time refers to the amount of time it takes a pixel to \"refresh\" itself-to go from being active to being inactive, (ready to be re-activated). The lower the milliseconds, the faster the response time. A television's very fast 4ms response time virtually eliminates any blurring and gives you smooth-motion action scenes**Digital Natural Image Engine (DNIe): Samsung's DNIe makes input signals sharper, clearer, and more lifelike. It's advanced  image processors and six-times density enhancer help to create true-to-life colors and high contrast, while virtually eliminating digital artifacts.

These firmware upgrades will be possible by connecting a USB drive to the TV's USB port.**PC-Capable: This unit has a 15-pin D-Sub (RGB) input that allows you to use it as a high-resolution computer monitor. The HDMI input can also be used for connecting the PC. The TV can be set to automatically adjust to the video signals received, or you can use the setup menu to adjust the screen quality and position. No cables are supplied for connecting the TV to a PC.**InfoLink RSS: The Samsung 650 Series LCD TV features an Ethernet port which allows you to connect the television to your home PC's network through a router so you can use the InfoLink RSS function of the television.

The picture is the best on the market today.  I watched it side by side with the Sony XBr4 and several other leading brands.  The touch of red is very stylish but not over bearing.  I have a blu-ray playstation 3, and HD FIOS and the TV picture is perfect.  I also have an amplified external antenna and the HD picture over the air is awesome as well.  What else is there to say.The only complaint I have over my old Sony HD is that the sound component in does not work unless there is also a video source.  In other words I can not just plug my ipod or sound from my computer without also having a video signal.  Oh well I guess I will have to also buy a 7:1 home theater system.  I was using an old amp and speakers.(1 Month update) - Connected my HP dv6000 laptop with internal HDMI HD card and the resolution is fantastic.  Connected new Panasonic Lumix DMC TZ5 with 16:9 pictures at 7.5 M and 4:3 at 9.1M also fantastic picture.  My iPod now plays music if also showing a slide show so I have not upgraded my sound system yet.  The SRS surround sound option is also great.  The Playstation web browser is extremely clear (1080p), better than my HP laptop which does have a lower resolution (720p).I have seen some comments about \"jitters\" for the NBA playoffs, this is probably someone who did not set their auto motion setting correctly, or does not have HD.  My FIOS HD for the playoffs is unbelievable (no \"jitters\" or \"flashes\" as one reviewer noted) it is so good.

And it even handles standard-def stuff off the cable box (even after the heavy compression with the DVR) really well. 'Touch of Color' thing is nice too -- very subtle, but sets it apart from other TVs and makes the set look a little more like a piece of furniture. Only gripe at all is with the remote, particularly when using the little round slide wheel. It could use a little more resistance, as it tends to fly by the option you're wanting a little too quickly. Luckily, it also operates as a push button device, so you can just as easily scroll up and down by clicking on the wheel.We ordered (straight from Amazon) on a Wednesday and it said that it would be about two weeks before it shipped.

Our initial opinion remains unchanged - The picture quality is simply phenomenal! And we have yet to make any of the picture adjustments recommended by CNET, AVS and other sites. Seeing HD on this set makes you hunger for more HD programming. We have experienced none of the shutdown, purple haze, flashlight, mura, etc. problems reported here and elsewhere so perhaps Samsung has resolved some of their early production issues. In fact, we have no problems to report at this time. Our set came with the 1003.M firmware update installed (there is one more recent update that seems a little buggy so I won't download that unless needed). I selected the set after exhaustive research online plus in-person side by side comparison. I chose it over the Sony XBR4 and various top quality plasmas. The Series 6 colors are vivid and crisp, the blacks are black and the motion is true. With this LCD set, there is no lengthy break-in period and no potential burn-in problems that are still reported for new model plasmas. In my opinion, there is currently no other product that can match the picture quality and feature set of this set at anything approaching the current market price. The much-discussed, red, 'Touch of Color' bezel is 'Much Ado About Nothing'. It's so subtle and tastefully done, I don't know what all the discussion is about, positive or negative.

There were no hassles picking it up at their facility, which was only 15 minutes away from my house.  The box was in perfect condition with no marks or scrapes to worry about.This set is amazing in every way!  From the moment I turned it on, I knew I had a keeper.  At first the picture was very bright and cartoonish, but after turning down the brightness and adjusting some other things, it is perfect for everyday content (HD cable).  A small warning...every artifact present in the source material to this TV will be obvious to you right away.  My wife doesn't notice things like that, but I do.  But what's more important is that all content will look better than you have likely seen.  Even standard definition looks MUCH better on the Samsung than my old HDTV.  Do yourself another favor, and purchase a blu-ray player to really see what this tv is capable of.  Blu-ray looks absolutely realistic and beautiful on this set.  I have walked up close to it many times to look closely for defects, and can find no flaws.  I have no detectable clouding and no flashlighting at all.  Some people are complaining about glare, but it doesn't bother me a bit.  My last set had a gloss front too, so maybe I am used to it, but only on very, very dark scenes when the sun is shining outside my kitchen do I even notice the glare.  This TV is in my living room, not a dedicated home theater.As far as features and settings, this set has more bells and whistles than a brand new Escalade.  I haven't quite figured out the AMP feature yet, and on my standard setting I keep it on low and things look great.Movie mode looks a bit dull at first, but you quickly get used to it and feel like you are watching in a theater.  Somehow it softens things around the edges, while still keeping the picture sharp and clear.  Magic maybe?When I first hooked it up, I plugged it into my home network, and didn't have to configure a thing.  All the weather functions and stock prices and news just worked.  Simplicity is nice to see in a set this complex, and the interface for the internet functions are easy to use and customize too.Enjoy your new set - this one sets the standard for everyone else!", "Date": "May 21, 2008"}, {"Title": "Phenomenal", "Author": "J.

A couple of months ago I narrowed it down to either a 650 or 750 Samsung based upon all of the positive reviews these two models have gotten everywhere.  I followed the AVS Forums for these sets, and although there have been some issues noted about these LCDs, it appeared that they got the worst of them fixed with the latest software updates.  So, although I had decided upon a Samsung, I still couldn't decide upon which model.  I also was debating about which size, 46 or 52 inch, to get.After much internal debating and comparisons at brick and mortor stores, I finally decided upon the 52 inch 650.  There really was only one feature of the 750 that interested me at all, and that was the DLNA option, but after reading some reviews of that technology, particularly with the Samsung LCD, I determined that it wasn't quite ready for prime-time, so that ruled out the 750 for me. The only decision left was what size to get.  Since I currently had a 42 inch, I was thinking a 46 would be a nice increase in size, but after viewing both the 46 and 52 Samsung side by side, and thinking how small the 46 looked, I decided to go for the larger model.  I'm happy I did too!  Although I have a small living room, my viewing distance is still 11 feet.  While others might disagree when they see it, I don't feel that the 52 inch overwhelms the room.Although I could have found this TV for a lower starting price, and no tax (I live in NY) at another website, I decided that Amazon's free \"white glove\" delivery was the decider.  Even with the NY tax added to the price, no brick and mortor could touch it, and based upon the reviews here on Amazon, I felt more comfortable purchasing a large priced item from here than from another website.  I have to say though I was a bit disappointed in the local delivery service (Eagle).  Only one guy delivered the set, so in the interest of not damaging the set, I ended up helping the guy bring it into my house, and set it up on the stand.  He also told me that they didn't hookup the sets, which seemed contrary to what I was reading on Amazon's reviews, but since I only had to connect the power and one HDMI cable, that wasn't a big deal.  He did stay and let me go through some visual inspections and check for a couple of the issues that I had read some people have had with this set.  Mine was PERFECT -- YA!!  I am very happy with this LCD TV.  The colors are tremendous, and the blacks are sooo deep, at least as deep as I've ever seen in an LCD TV.

I've got my TV hooked up to a wireless bridge and I'm able to check the weather at the push of a button.A couple of things to keep in mind though. If you plan to wall mount this (as I did) make sure you have a long philips screwdriver. The TV comes with the stand already attached and the screws are very deep. Secondly, be aware that the PIP on this TV is practically useless since one of your sources has to be an HDMI or component source and even then you may only view analog channels on the other source. Other than those minor details, I've no complaints.*UPDATE 10/2011*Unfortunately, my set is now afflicted with the power problems you see many other reviewers complaining about. It seems Samsung TVs across several models have problems with their capacitators failing after a short time. The symptom is the TV will not power on and just keep clicking. It looks to be a very common problem and the fix is to replace the failed capacitators for a few bucks plus labor. If you are comfortable with de-soldering and soldering on a circuit board, you can save money and do this yourself, but for others, this repair will cost you a couple of hundred.Since the failure in many cases happens after 3 years or more, you will inevitably have to foot the bill as was what Samsung support told me. Apparently, though some customers have had their TVs repaired by Samsung outside of warranty, just not myself. Which sets qualify or do not qualify for this courtesy repair does not seem clear. Support told me although my model was the same as other customers, the part installed was different. I asked for the part number that they were doing the repair for and mine, but they said they would have to escalate the issue. I told them to escalate, so now I am in a waiting game. I would recommend you try to contact Samsung support and see if they can repair your set even if its warranty has expired. If not, then at least they have another complaint on file so that they can see, this is not just some isolated incident.As a result, I am dropping my original review from 5 stars to 3. The performance when it works is great, but I was one of the many to get a set with poor parts and although Samsung support was polite, they failed to explain why they would fix some TVs but not others.", "Date": "May 28, 2008"}, {"Title": "Huge disappointment!", "Author": "R.

Straight out of the box, the colors are brilliant but not oversaturated.  The picture at 1080i (which is what most local stations are broadcasting over the air) is crisp and looks amazing!  We will likely not bother with satellite/cable for a good while, seeing how many stations the internal digital tuner picks up in our area with our rooftop antenna (Twin Cities metro area).  We are currently getting about 19 digital channels, and nearly all of them are sharp and come in very clear and detailed.The ToC bezel on the TV is hardly noticeable in our walkout basement.  In fact, I don't notice the red coloring at all while it's on the wall.  In a well-lit room I should think it would be quite subtle and elegant, and nothing to complain about.On the topic of complaints I've read by some here, I'd like to address the remote control for the TV.  Are you guys serious?  You paid $2k for an awesome TV and you're complaining about the remote?!  That's just being nitpicky and to be honest, I disagree whole-heartedly with those opinions.  I think the remote is quite modern and stylish.  It looks sleek and sophisticated; perfect for this TV.  The delay when using the jog dial is a little frustrating, but really, it's a jog wheel on a wireless remote people.  Does anyone REALLY expect to not have a bit of a delay as the TV picks up what you are doing with the wheel?  They couldn't have implemented the design any better on a wireless device.  The other major complaint I've read about is about the glare on the screen.  This is ludicrous.  Yes, there is glare on the screen when it is turned off, but when the TV is on, the glare disappears.  Does anyone really care about the glare when it's off?  That's just silly.  We have a large window and glass doors less than 12' away from the right side of our TV and have no problems with glare.  If there is a glare problem, try changing the brightness/contrast/backlight settings on the TV!  Don't downgrade the rating of the TV just because you're unable or unwilling to tweak the settings to accomodate your surroundings, folks.  It's unfair to mark down the TV for this in my view.The on-screen menu is a joy to use.  Easy to navigate, nice to look at and has pretty much any setting you could want on an LCD TV.  You can even tweak the individual colors to get the picture exactly the way you like it, which is a huge bonus in my opinion.I bought this TV from Sears [...] , so I can't comment on Amazon's delivery service.  Yeah, I paid tax, but I'd rather be able to walk into a store with any product issues than deal with the headache of having to return it to an online shop and wait for a new one to be shipped out to me, etc.I've played Xbox 360 and PS3 games as well as streamed TV show episodes from my PC (via the PC/PS3 wirelessly), and have watched standard def (Series of Unfortunate Events) and Blu-ray (Transformers) movies on it, and everything has looked fantastic so far.  120Hz really does improve standard def TV, sports and gaming.  I turn it down to \"low\" or turn it off for movie watching, because it does look a bit wierd with movies when it is on.  The \"soap opera\" effect is pretty bad when the setting is on \"high\" while watching movies/TV.  Some folks might like this, but most people I talk to don't like it set on \"high\" for movies or normal TV viewing.  Gaming and animated movies are another story though.  120 Hz works excellently with these applications.All of my video sources are passed through or upconverted via my Denon 789/1909 receiver, and as stated on the AVS forums there is no issue with the HDMI handshake between the receiver and this TV.  Apparently Onkyo and Yamaha receivers have had problems with dropping the signal or clipping the picture when passing it to this TV, but I can confirm that no such problems exist with the Denon (thankfully!).While the TV is not overly heavy, it is large and awkward.  3 of us mounted it on the wall, one to guide it onto the mount and two to hold it up, but we might have gotten away with just two of us holding/mounting at the same time.  One of the screws didn't want to come out of the base at first, so two of us had to tilt the TV back and lightly jiggle it while the third person worked the base enough for the last screw to come out.  Kind of a pain, but we got the stand off in the end.  I highly recommend getting a tilting mount for this TV if you are wall-mounting it, because you will not be able to reach the inputs/outputs on the back of it otherwise.  I bought a tilting mount for 42 - 63\" screens at Monoprice for $35 (don't ever overpay in a store for a mount!).  Had to buy different lag bolts, as the included ones were far too wide for my application (dry wall with 2\" wood and poured cement behind it).  I bought six 2 1/2\" long cement lag bolts (5/16\" diameter) and rented a hammer drill with a 3/8 cement bit to drill the holes big enough to accomodate the wall anchors.  Worked a treat, and the TV mount is securely hung on the wall (my brother-in-law even hung on the thing to make sure it wasn't going to come off!).Hope some of this has helped folks with making a purchasing decision on a new LCD TV.  I'm thoroughly pleased with it, and I don't even have it completely tweaked to perfection yet. I'm not sure I'm going to have to change much honestly.You won't get a better TV in this size range at this price.", "Date": "January 13, 2009"}, {"Title": "Don't even bother looking at other LCD TVs", "Author": "iMinnesotan", "ReviewID": "R1110LJI5NG7KL", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "After more that 500 reviews of this HDTV what more can I say?

One important feature we considrerd was the expected life of the cold cathode flourescent light (CCFL) and ease/cost of replacement. Samsung engineered this set so that the flourescent backlight is easily replaced.  We expect to replce it within 3-5 years.  The order/purchase through Amazon was flawless.  Excellent price, service and delivery.  We have been viewing our new tv for two weeks, and we are blown away by the vibrant colors and features this set provides.  We hooked up our sound through existing home theatre (Onkyo amp and speakers, Infinity subwoofer, LG DV/VCR player/recorder).  Sound and picture is remarkable.  There is no going back to regular tv.  HD content channels are the only way to appreciate this set.  I urge everyone to consider the 52\" over the 46\" screen.  At a viewing distance of 8-10', the 52\" is perfect.

Now I will go through the details. First, have the software upgrade available. I have received two of these TV's and the first one didn't require, the second one does. Simply download the driver from the Samsung support site and place it on a USB drive. If you select sw update from the setup menu, it will tell you if the version is the same, so it won't do it unless needed.I have a basement with a window and a light right on top of the TV set. This is the first big advantage of this TV --namely the construction material of the screen. The low reflective layer simply ignores the external light source and it is almost as of it absorbs the light. The result is that the image from the TV is unaffected by the external light. It is as vivid regardless whether it's dark or daylight shining on the TV --truly amazing.Another amazing fact of this material is it allows viewing from a very obtuse angle without losing clarity. Remember those airplane mounted LCD monitors which turns black when viewed from an angle? No such thing with this TV.The picture simply looks fake. This is not a negative comment. Remember those magazine advertisements which always claim \"simulated TV picture\"? They basically cut and paste a picture to the TV screen. guess what, this TV looks fake. It looks like someone took a large poster of clear photo, and put it on the screen. Simply flawless.I have played with the settings and found that the default \"standard\" setting is the best for my taste. You can make the screen a lot brighter if you want. I strongly suggest to not set the brightness too high which may lead to clouding. I have read reviews complaining about lcd clouding --where on very dark solid scenes, an uneven brightness is visible on the screen. Clouding is common due to the way LCD matrix works. One way to combat this effect is to avoid watching your television in completely dark rooms. Turn on a lamp with a low light setting to keep a small amount of ambient light in the room. Some LCD manufacters offer ambient light built in to their television (such as Philips Ambilight) but this option is not available on this TV. So if you review 100 different TV's (even though they are all the same model), it is not uncommon to find one or two sets which has worse lcd clouding issues than the other. Mine is just perfect.The response time and 120hz made a big difference. A tv with 60 hz refreshes the screen 60 times a second. On an LCD screen, a high action picture can produce a blur simply because the refresh cannot cath up to the changes of the picture composition. Those days are over. 120 times per second the image is updated so it doesn't matter what movement or action you got on the screen --it remains picture perfect sharp.I was rather worried about the \"red\" bezel but this was unnecessary. The color tone is very subtle.Watching TV is a pleasure. I appreciate the channel list which actually reads the broadcaster info (station ID and the current program). The majority of the screens are smaller than what the screen can accomodate. Most cable deliveries (unless you have FIOS) do not deliver the full 1080p but a quick blu ray disk play will eliminate doubt that this is the most amazing HDTV.The WiseLink option is extremely poorly programmed. I stuck in a USB drive with directories containing files mixed with pictures, music, etc. The system is over protective to the user and attempted to make life easy by tabulating *ALL* the pictures and music for you. I prefer to be able to browse my thumb drive directories. It is extremely annoying trying to get to a particular picture you wanted to see and having to go through literally thousands of JPG files. Remember, if you have files such as offline internet browsing files, every single button and pictures are saved as a JPG. This is a major flaw in the software rather than the TV. Hopefully the programming team can revise the software and allow direct browsing. Again, I have to clarify that this shortcoming is a software issue rather than TV performance.When the TruSurround XT SRS sound option is enabled, the sound coming from the standard speakers is very commendable. The sound surround reproduction is rich as has dimension. This is probably moot for most users who will connect an AV receiver. Just make sure you have an optical cable to connect the TV to your AV receivers so you can get the best sound from the TV to your receiver as well.One sound option that is really nice is the sound leveler which can be set to \"ON\" in the setup (the default is off so look for it under sound). With this option on, when you channel browse, you no longer get surprises on those channels which are much louder than its neighbors (or much lower). Adjusting the volume from channel to channel is a thing of the past. A very nice welcomed addition.For those who struggle with component video cables please don't. You are shortchanging yourself. Please connect this TV using an HDMI cable. And don't go cheap on the HDMI cable. Make sure you get one with enough bandwidth to handle 1080p. It may cost more but it's worth it.The 50,000 to 1 contrast ratio is not just hype. I have a Sharp Aquos in the house as well and I have great respect for that TV but it can't compete with the dynamic contrast ratio which makes a big difference in picture clarity.

I've not seen any HD format material on it yet, so I've no way to verify that except what I saw in the store on the 46\" version of this set.  They were showing a Bluray disc on it.  I have only regular format cable and regular DVD material I've seen on it (oh, and a Wii using component inputs) and I can see details I've never seen before.  We'll see what happens in Feb 09 when the formats switch.OK, the cons - the CRT TV was pretty much instant on, instant off.  This one blinks about 2 sec, plays a little sound, then about 8 sec later you get a \"searching for signal\" screen, then your show pops up about 2 sec later.  Power off takes a bit less time, about 5 sec.  The \"auto\" power save feature is pretty worthless as it is driven by the material played, not by the ambient light in the room - if they had a lux sensor on the tv then you might actually save some power when the room is dark.  I've seen some folks complain about the screen as being too reflective.  Yes, it is reflective, not exactly matte finish, but I've not seen any interference from light shining through the window about 10 feet away.  The odd thing about the remote isn't the remote so much as it's compatibility with other remotes - I've tried setting up my DVD and DVR and receiver remote to operate it, and it is hit or miss whether I'll find a code that will not only turn the tv on and off (the ability to switch channels and the built in tuner are fairly useless for me since I have cable) but control the volume.  That is, just about all of the codes will allow you to press the volume up or down one step, but if you hold the volume button in one direction or the other, you only get one step of movement from the TV.  So you have to keep pushing the volume button.  A bit annoying.  Of course, this isn't an issue with the TV's remote, but it doesn't control any other components, so I rarely use it except to control the backlighting.  Finally, it seems to be a bit \"smart\" in that it knows when I turn on the DVD player (which is piped into the HDMI2 port) and will switch to that signal from the cable signal (which is piped into the HDMI1 port).

I love the auto motion plus (120Hz technology), but it does take time to get used to at first.  The picture is SO smooth that it makes movies have a documentary feel to them.  It looks live.  I think Americans (like me) in general, aren't used to that live feel for movies.  After careful observation, it is superior, and I shudder when I switch the 120Hz off because it is so chopped up looking in comparison.  1080i sources are also greatly improved because of this and feel more like a progressive scan source.  Video games on the PS3 look great too.The only disappointment I have is that the Optical audio output will only route Stereo audio coming from a 5.1 digital source (via HDMI).  The only time it will output 5.1 digital (or higher) is from an off-air coax connection.  Lame eh?

Gates", "ReviewID": "R3S1LZ5X63P6MF", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Pros: Very crisp! In the limited time I've owned it, it has far surpassed my Bravia V in almost every way image quality wise! If you're a big fan of CG movies, this is THE set to have! With AMP off, I experience zero controller lag on my ps3. I much prefer not to use the gaming setting, as some games require a bit of tweaking so as not to be too dark (Resistance 2 anyone?). Even with Gaming mode off, this set seriously puts the everloving trounce on the Bravia. Bu-rays that aren't meant to play at 24p, such as Planet Earth and CG movies, are completely breathtaking with AMP on. Smooth as silk, like you're looking through a window! The buttons on the tv are heat activated, how freakin' cool is that! Just gently touch the bezel on the icons. That kind of thing appeals to the geek in me. Extremely wide viewing angle makes for a fulfilling experience, even if you aren't dead center of the screen.Cons: Remote response is laggy. If your main purchasing criteria is based on how quickly the tv responds to remote input, you will not be happy with how slowly the menu scrolls respond to your inputs. Coming from the Sony XMB, I was quite disappointed that Samsung's menu system is so slow. But once everything is dialed in, I consider that a small gripe compared to the advantages this system has to offer. Oh, and I hope you're handy with a microfiber cloth, cause the bezel is a dust magnet with no equal! Glossy Screen won't be a bonus to everyone. I'm nocturnal, so most of my watching is done at night. However, during daytime watching in a loft with no curtains, the glare was not distracting in any way to me. During gaming it might be more of an issue than casual tv time.Other Notes: Pilot shipping wasn't given all the necessary paperwork to make the shipment to my home on the estimated delivery date. Delivery was delayed by 2 business days, which doesn't sound like much until you're waiting for a $2000 HDTV over a weekend to arrive in 1 piece. However, the agent in my area was sincerely apologetic about the delay and Amazon did their best to keep me appraised of the situation, including putting me directly in touch with the delivery company. I would say, if you order from here, add at least 3 days to the estimated delivery date to avoid disappointment and stress.", "Date": "February 27, 2009"}, {"Title": "This is the TV you've been looking for!", "Author": "Matt Combes", "ReviewID": "R1WFRYTNNNM0HP", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This TV is just amazing. I had been planning on purchasing a new TV to upgrade from my 50\" LG plasma, which was only 720p. My top pick was going to be a Panasonic Viera plasma, based on reviews over at CNET.com, but I wanted to see it in person so I trekked on over to Best Buy to check it out. I was not impressed after looking at the Panny they had up ... nor was I much impressed even by the Pioneer Kuro they had right next to it, which was supposed to be the best of the best. No, surprisingly enough, when I sat back and scanned all of the TVs they had up, my eyes kept being drawn over to the Samsung LCDs. The 650 and 750 models they had up were brighter, more colorful, and just \"popped\" right out at you. So I took a closer look, dug the 120hz feature, and decided to investigate more.I did a lot of searching around online for both reviews and pricing. Sure enough, I found the best spot for each here, on Amazon.com. There were so many reviews, mostly 5-star, and the price was definitely lower than any big box store and most places online. Once I realized how often the price fluctuated, I watched it daily like a stock ticker, waiting for the prime opportunity to take advantage -- which came 2 days after Christmas, when it hit the lowest point I've seen on Amazon to date. A great post-Christmas gift!There was a bit of a hang up with the delivery, which involved me having to call Pilot to ask when my TV was getting here because nobody had ever called me to set up a delivery 7 days after ordering. Since Pilot didn't have a location near my city, they had contracted a local delivery service, Queen City Delivery, to handle it. The QC rep advised me that they would get to me the very next morning, and they did. There were 2 guys, and they were more than happy to do the white glove delivery, putting the TV up on the stand and all ... although I didn't have them check the operation of the TV due to the fact it was 15 degrees outside and the TV was ice cold (and according to the manual needs an operating temperature of at least 50 degrees). I waited a couple hours for it to warm up before I started playing.Like I said, this TV is amazing. I had to play around with some settings on my cable box to get things to look proper on-screen (resolution-wise), but once I got that down, it was just a matter of toying around. Standard Def, of course, looks kind of crappy at 52\" and stretched (I don't do 4:3, thank you), but it looks better than it did on my old LG. Where this TV really shines, though, is in playing upscaled DVDs and Blu-Ray. This TV coupled with my Playstation 3 is a winning combo. When my DVDs are upscaled to 1080p, with the right picture settings, they look SO close to Blu-Ray quality. There are still obvious qualities that allow you to tell that it's not, but for DVD quality it's great. Blu-Ray, on the other hand ... that's where it's at. Stunning. I've been watching seasons 3 and 4 of LOST on Blu-Ray and with the 120hz feature on (usually low or medium), and my personal picture preferences, it's drool-worthy. The blacks are very black (again, better than my LG and rivaling even the Panny I was looking at), the colors explode, and every detail is right there for you to inspect.I also use this set a lot as a computer monitor for my MacBook Pro. It's gorgeous in 1080p. One of the reasons I was more willing to get this set is that LCD is less susceptible to image retention and burn-in than plasma, which I noticed a lot when I was using the LG plasma as my monitor.Oh, that Touch of Color bezel? I'm not a fan of red at all, but got this TV despite that because the picture looked THAT good. But you know what? I can't even see it. I mean, if you're looking for it, it's there, but because my living room has ambient flourescent lighting rather than any kind of direct lighting, the red almost blends right into the black. And the gloss? Again, because I have no direct lighting and no windows behind me, there really isn't any. Now, I will say that if I have the lights on, and I'm watching a really dark, shadowy scene, you can quite easily make out reflections. However, it's that big of a distraction and if I really want I can just turn off the lights. The remote is actually pretty nice. The scroll wheel gets some flak, and deservedly so because it sucks, but the good thing is that you can still use it as a clickable direction pad -- you don't have to use it as a scroll wheel. Switching inputs is slow, and I wish you could cycle the 120hz settings or your personal picture settings with just 1 button, but these things are not enough to deter me from giving this set a 5-star rating.BUY THIS TELEVISION. Seriously. You won't regret it. Most of the 1- and 2-star reviews for this television have to do with the shipping company or Amazon, neither of which have anything to do with this product. And those who have had problems with the product most likely got an errant lemon and are too impatient to deal with the warranty service. I have had no problems so far (granted, I've only had it for 2 weeks). The TV came with the latest firmware, so I didn't have to update it. I can't rave enough about this product. No more TV upgrades for me for a long time!", "Date": "January 16, 2009"}, {"Title": "52\" of HD goodness.....", "Author": "Brian Fox", "ReviewID": "R2GROFJ20WRAKP", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This was my first Amazon purchase over $200, and I couldn't be more satisfied.  I researched for several months like many others, to learn as much as I could about the current specs and to see all the different models in person.  I haven't owned a new tv since the 19\" back in high school a decade ago (roommates won out), so I wanted something that would handle movies/computing/gaming for some time to come.  I also knew that my father, who was shopping for his first HDTV, would more than likely go with my decision as well.We picked his up Christmas Eve from Best Buy, along with the 32\" Whalen corner stand.  Unpacking and setup was easy enough, you simply pull out the two plastic retainers and the box lifts off.  Cable coax directly from the wall, or hdmi from the cable box both have a great picture, no issues with cable box compatibility with Time Warner.I ordered mine from Amazon on Dec. 26, and Pilot delivered it in a pickup truck on Dec. 31st, just in time to watch the Huskers beat Clemson the next day.  Pilot probably did a better job than if I would have bought it from a retailer, as the box wasn't bent or gouged anywhere.  I also didn't see any dead pixels or any other flaws in either of the 650's we bought this Christmas.  For a stand I chose the Whalen BBL44BP from Best Buy, since Amazon didn't carry it, which is a 44\" wide base with chrome reclining legs and black tempered glass.The picture is incredible, and the tv itself is well made and looks great.  It's not facing any windows in my house, so the glare is a non-issue.  It did take me a little while to realize there are no buttons on the tv, instead in the lower right hand corner there is a touch sensitive pad for power/volume/channels.  It will leave fingerprints using them, but they work fine.Hooking up to the xbox360 via the component cables will give 1080p output, contrary to some of the rumors that you absolutely have to have the xbox hdmi cable to get above 1080i.  I have the optical audio from both the tv and the xbox running to a Yamaha receiver.Connecting to the computer via a standard VGA cable works great, and is perfectly readable from 8ft back at 1360x768 (slightly wider resolution than a standard widescreen monitor, which I normally ran at 1280x768 or 1440x900).The backlight and brightness settings were a little brighter than they needed to be across the board, so after some minor changes everything looks great.  The built in speakers are small, and sound as generic as I expected.  They work fine for normal low to mid volume purposes, but lack the bass and midrange for movies or games.  Not a big deal to me, so I normally turn them off or all the way down to let the receiver do the work.Other tv functions include the ability to connect directly to a LAN for software upgrades, InfoLink news and weather, which is kind of nice, but a little redundant as it's already hooked to a computer.  Same with the Wiselink USB port, which lets you plug in any usb music or picture storage device and browse through pictures or play mp3's.I also haven't spent much time with the Automotion settings, or had anything that would output at 120hz to justify that aspect of the 650 over the 550.  It did seem to help the clarity during standard dvd playback, when the background and foreground were moving at different speeds.  Otherwise, I assume it's something that will be taken advantage of more in the future, or with a bluray player to eliminate the 3:2 pulldown inherent in 24fps film.I compared this tv with several Sony's, and the LG70, before deciding on Samsung.  The 750 series' extra software, and the 850's slimmer profile weren't worth the extra money, in my opinion.  Assuming that I don't run into any unforeseen repairs, this seems to be an outstanding tv that I look forward to keeping for quite a while.", "Date": "January 6, 2009"}, {"Title": "Everything as promised", "Author": "Tina C.", "ReviewID": "R1PLHSV8N58F7F", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "The TV is excellent, the picture quality is wonderful.I want to comment on the delivery and set up.

I was a little nervous about buying something used and repackaged in a new box, but after having it for a week I couldn't be happier.  The description noted \"cosmetic blemishes on main unit.\"  After doing some research I concluded this could be anything from cat hair on the body to scratches/chips/knicks.  The only \"cosmetic blemish\" we (me and the delivery guys) ever found was some sticker residue from the \"Full HD 1080p\"-type stickers that used to be on the front.  That was easily rubbed off with a finger.The TV itself is purely beautiful.  I upgraded from an old Sanyo 32\" SDTV that I've had for about 10 years so, of course, I've just been totally wowed by having a nice HDTV in my home.  Picture quality is astounding on all sources.  Non-HD cable channels are lacking in quality, but that's the same with any TV.  The standard definition channels come through very nice on this TV and it doesn't bother me to watch them at all.  If anything, it definitely looks better to me on the HDTV than on the SDTV.  It has lots of picture options and modes for sports, movies, etc.  The body of the TV is very nice.  The red Touch of Color is a nice effect and definitely adds to the beauty.  The red is not insanely bright so it's noticeable but it's nowhere near an eyesore.The 120hz refresh rate is great on this TV.  I spent a few hours at Best Buy and Circuit City evaluating 120hz TV's.  It's not hugely noticeable on regular things (sitcoms, SD channels, etc).  It makes a noticeable difference when watching sports in HD.  It makes an incredible difference when watching movies in HD and on DVD (I don't have a Blu-ray Player so standard DVDs here).  Some people don't like the way it makes movies look since it does take away that film \"feel.\"  Personally, I like it much better because it makes things very smooth.  It's easily turned on and off via the remote and actually has 5 settings: Off, Low, Medium, High and Demo.  Turned to Low and Medium you retain about 50% and 25% of that film \"feel\" respectively.  On High you've got the full 120hz, and Demo shows you 120hz enabled on one half of the screen while the other half has it disabled for comparisons.I've seen a lot of complaints about the speakers in this TV, and while the speakers aren't amazing, they aren't terrible either.  They are perfectly fine for average TV viewing.  Personally, I don't feel the need to turn on the stereo and crank up my speakers just to watch G4, VH1, Discovery Channel or some other generic TV viewing.  They sound fine to me and are plenty loud enough for general viewing.The remote control is very nice.  I only use it now to change sources since I use the universal that comes with my cable service for pretty much everything else.  There are touch-sensitive \"buttons\" on the right side to use for power, volume, channel and a handy source button if you ever need to control sans remote.The TV stand is good and has a nice swivel.  I don't use the stand anymore since I mounted the TV to a wall.  A plastic cover is provided to cover the hole where the stand goes.  Mounting this TV was pretty easy.  I used the Peerless SF6640 Universal mount purchased from Amazon.  Installing the brackets to the TV was simple.  The back of the TV isn't cluttered with unnecessary markings or anything and is the same size everywhere the brackets went.  Hanging the TV on the wall was a two-person job simply because I didn't want to risk dropping it.  It's 64 pounds without the stand, and, while I could lift it and mount it myself, it's just easier and safer to do it with two people.One of my main concerns with the mount I got was the clearance for cables plugged into the TV.  The mount offered 1.7\" of clearance to the wall.  I organized my cabling very neatly and ended up with about 0.25\" of clearance from the cables to the wall.  The included power cord is a right-angle cord and easily fits with the wall.  The input panel is slightly set in so it gives a little extra room there (about a quarter of an inch).  The component and HDMI cables are curved from the connector to the center of the TV.  I didn't have to make any hard curves or bends to get it to fit, but they are not ideal in my opinion.  The cables and inputs are in no danger of being damaged, but I would've liked to have 0.1\" more just to keep things from having to be curved much at all.  On the back of the TV in the center is an attached table wrap that makes routing your cables down and away from the TV easy and neat.The delivery service was great.  They set it up on my temporary stand and powered it on to make sure it worked.  I let them take the box after they informed that if I needed to exchange the TV, Amazon would just send me a new TV in a new box anyway and I could just use that box to return anything.Overall this is one of the best purchases I've ever made, and I got a stellar deal at $1604.81 before shipping.

After lightning destroyed my 27\" analog JVC and reading speculation about upward price pressures, decided to act.  Had settled on Panasonic plasma when I discovered this model - what luck! The model has the best of both worlds - brilliant picture and pop of plasma, but with low-power consumption and freedom from burn-in worries of LCD. I no longer felt like I was compromising. And the extra dollars for 52 inches over 46 well spent.Positives:- Best designed remote I've ever used.- Menus are well designed and transparent.- Great speakers even though I normally use a 5.1 sound system for movies and extended viewing.- Screen reflections a small fraction of the flat CRT it replaces, virtually unnoticeable in a room with only east windows.- Delivery was timely and uneventful - I had prepared several solid color jpeg's on a USB flashdrive to verify zero pixel defects before the delivery guys left. Never thought I would order a large TV from an online merchant; now I would never do it any other way.- Amazon quickly adjusted a few minor price decreases without question after delivery.Extra features:- The Wiselink support for MP3 and JPG viewing is interesting but very basic and will be used minimally. I tried a 8GB USB flash drive full of photos and waited 20+ minutes while it was creating thumbnails of all the pictures. Probably useable for a few hundred photos at a time.- The RSS news/weather feed doesn't seem compelling enough to hunt down the WiFi dongle required for wireless use.- The picture-in-picture facility is limited to an analog feed in the window.

I waited for a call until Thursday noon, and was told they wouldn't have the two man truck coming to my area until the following Thursday.  I think I could have talked them into sending it earlier if I'd help unload, but decided agianst it.  When the day came, the delivery window was 11-3 and they showed at about 3.05.  They unloaded, unboxed, and made sure the unit worked.  My advice would be to call as soon as tracking on the CEVA website shows its reached the local terminal.  If I had, I think I could have had the TV a week earlier.  A google for CEVA Trak or tracking should lead you to thier website and you can navigate around thier site to find the local phone number, then ask for who=ever schedules deliveries.

I've been seriously researching HDTVs for about 8 months and my first choice was going to be the LN5271F, but never pulled the trigger because of the numerous problems users were complaining about on the AVS Forum (great place to research TVs even though the owners tend to be very picky and notice flaws normal users such as myself wouldn't),  and the price was slow to drop to a level I could afford.  I'm glad I waited because it brought me to this TV.  It received much better feedback from users on the forums and even some of the professional calibrators mentioned it is the best LCD tv they have ever worked with, rivaling even the top notch Pioneer plasmas in picture quality.I currently have HD cable (1080i), Wii (480p), and the computer (1080p) hooked up to it.  It has a fantastic picture from all sources.  I can't stress this enough, it is amazing.  I find myself watching a lot more TV now because of this.  Black levels look great and the picture is very vibrant and sharp.  The AVS forum also has a calibration thread for this TV which helped me dial in the picture and then making small adjustments to get the picture to my satisfaction.  Each source can be calibrated (to varying degrees) and the TV remembers them all.This TV comes highly recommended.  Pricing on Amazon is great and delivery was a breeze.

Naturally, it only happens after the set is out of warranty, so the repair is several hundred dollars.The failed capacitors are usually detectable visually and many folks have successfully completed the repair themselves for a few bucks (new caps and maybe some soldering tools), according to a tech report web site.  You do have to lay the set down to take the back off in order to get to the circuit board.  This site contains detailed instructions and pics and links to videos.

Although admittedly the top of the line Plasmas might have a slight edge in presenting fine detail, this TV is simply more enjoyable to view.  We found it's bright, anti-glare screen gorgeous and far superior to all others in the store. With 1080p, the details are sharp and crisp enough for just about anyone. After getting it home, we couldn't be more pleased.  The picture is breath-taking!We were slightly concerned over reading of complaints of glare, but we are not having this problem.  The set replaces a large rear projection screen, which gave us horrific glare off of our front window and we were concerned that this unit would do the same, but am very pleased to report that glare is minimal. Compared to my LCD computer screen, I guess it gives off more glare, but then it is 52\" and has a glossy trim...both of which are bound to catch more light. However, this is basically a non issue for us...we are thrilled with the reduced glare we are experiencing compared to our rear-projection.We were also hesitant on its red-trimming....concerned it would look ugly in our living room.  I can say, you barely notice it is red trimmed.  The red tinge is subtle, and for all intents and purposes, the set looks black.The remote is nice...easy to use and agreeably good sized (I hate tiny remotes with buttons you need a magnifying glass for).When the set is turned off, there is a very small red light at the bottom right that stays illuminated. We like this since it is easy to accidentally leave a tv on all night (when cable is turned off) without this type of feedback.There is one important negative. The sound quality of the speakers is not very good. To be fair, we have been listening to a 5-speaker home theater system for 8 years, so perhaps our ears are spoiled.  However, compared to our rear-projection, the speakers on this are very inferior.  If you are not going to use an external sound system, I would recommend listening to the set in a brick and mortar store before buying.I would highly-highly recommend this television.

Now a lot of people don't take kindly to consumer reports, but it has never failed me. I originally bought a sony bravia 32\" LCD when they first came out because they were top rated at the time, and it still shines bright 2 years later. Particular reasons the 750 (which is more expensive) was rated lower are it does not have a swivel base, and a lot of people complained about the bevel glass edge on the 750 which tended to cause an annoying reflection inside the TV during late night/ dark viewing. Really the picture on this set is phenomenal (HDMI 1080p of course). The 120 Hz really does make a huge difference. Motion is so crisp that it hurts your eyes. It takes a few days for the damage to be done to your retinas, but after that you get used to it. You really should sit back at least 7 feet from this TV otherwise your brain just melts. The infolink feature is nice, but not really practical considering you could just turn to the weather channel or stock channel, etc..

Had great concerns over the more reflective screen on the 650 but it really is a non issue in the setting I use it and this issue is way overblown, I believe.  The TV \"sees\" exactly like a mirror so use that as a guide (the screen itself is not nearly as reflective as a mirror or the old CRT tube, though).  The matte screen on other models is actually a diffuse screen which diffuses the LCD output as well as absorbing and reflecting light around the room so it has it's own issues with the net result of lower contrast and less deep black.Features:  The USB port slide show from a thumb drive is great, easy to use and recognizes everything I plug in. Amazing picture quality at HD level.Infolink/Internet connection is cute but not that useful as it delivers a simple weather summary and stock quotes.

Just have to shut the blinds though.  Do not be overly concerned with the alleged glare issue.- Size - I couldn't decide between 46 and 52.  Cost was my main concern.* Go 52 if the room can handle it.  The additional cost was TOTALLY worth it.- 120 hz - would it even make a difference?  Is it worth the extra couple hundred dollars?* Haven't had a ton of experience with this outside of gaming but compared to my 60 hz sharp this one is smooth as butter.  I have the motion thing set on low.- Touch of Red - is it going to look dated in a few years like the 80's sony trinitrons?  Would the style be overwhelming?*  Touch of red is subtle and only really evident on the top and bottom edge.  It looks much more pronounced in the Amazon photos.

I thought the clear frame on the 750 looked and felt cheap, and prone to scratches, plus, I didn't need the additional features of the 750.  The red tint of the TOC bezel on the 650 is barely noticeable, and provides subtle warmth to the frame.  I have TV mounted directly on the wall and it looks like a piece of art.The picture is excellent and I have had no problems with this set.

The difference being that the A630 has a more matte finish to the screen (resulting in a slight drop of contrast 50,000:1 vs. 40,000:1) and has one less HMDI input (4 vs. 3).I had read some people's complaint that the A650's screen was distracting with the more glossy finish. I can say that I have this set in a room with windows on three walls, allowing in plenty of natural light regardless of the time of day, and there is zero problem with reflections off of this screen. Go for this set and enjoy the ever so slightly better picture (than that of the A630).The picture is mind-blowing. It is like having an IMAX theater in your family room.

I immediately called Amazon.  Because it was late on a Friday night, I had to wait until Monday morning to speak with someone in the \"TV department.\"  Instead of waiting for them to call, I called.  They appreciated my quick attention to the matter, asked me a couple questions and then gave me two options: (1) keep the tv and accept a discount for purchasing a slightly damaged one or (2) get a perfect new one.I chose (2).  Within 24 hours, they shipped a new TV to me.  When it arrived, the CEVA guy took the old one and replaced it with the new one.

The guys brought it in and we turned on the TV and watched a couple of channels, just to make sure everything was OK. This is a wise thing to do, as they can take it right back if something isn't right. My screen seemed fine.Previously, I had a 50\" Samsung DLP, so I was used to HD pic quality, but the new LN52A650 is noticeably sharper than my old DLP (which crapped out after only 4 years). I watched Russel Crowe in \"Gladiator\" using a Samsung 1080P7 (non-HD) DVD player and I swore it was in HD. It was incredibly sharp and clear. I have watched football games in HD and I could detect no motion blur at all, the games looked awesome. Some programming in SD is not so hot, but it's livable.The LN52A650 setup is somewhat complex, so you'll need to educate yourself on calibrating and such. There are a number of sites that offer calibrations from others to get you started. I recommend joining a forum or two, something like \"AVS Forum\" where you can ask questions about calibrating. If you want the best picture this thing can offer, then you will definitely need to do some adjusting (calibrating).The remote is OK. I love the fact that the backlight is motion-sensing. As soon as you pick up the remote, the backlight comes on. The remote has a funky scroll wheel, which is overly-sensitive and it will mess you up in the beginning, but once you get used to it, the remote works fine.The LN52A650 screen is highly reflective. If your viewing area has strong lighting, then you may need to add some blinds or curtains. The TOC (touch of color) is barely noticeable and I like the deep red.

That's the best way for me to describe the TV.  I went from a tube TV to a 52 inch Toshiba DLP and thought the transition was great.  When I bought this Samsung, I felt the DLP I had was my old tube TV.  The picture is phenomenal.  I hooked both my Xbox 360 and PS3 and played games and was amazed how clear, and crisp the picture looked.  The detail and picture had me speechless but that was just the beginning of it.When I placed a Blu-Ray disk (Alien vs Predator) into my Playstation 3 and played it, I was in awh.  I couldn't believe the clarity, the detail...I'm still speechless.  I felt this TV just put my DLP to shame.  One of my gripes about Alien vs Predator was the scenes in the movie when it was dark.  I had a hard time making out what was going on.  Not with this TV.  I could see the Aliens running around in the tunnels where as with my DLP, I could barely make them out.  It was a frustrating experience to watch on my DLP, not anymore with this Samsung.  You can see what was going on in the intense action scenes with perfect motion clarity and no haze or blur.  Another thing, with such clarity, I could see just how fake the Aliens were.  Something I couldn't do with the DLP.I gave the TV a 4 star rating because the sound system was less than spectacular.  It really doesn't bother me since I have a Samsung surround sound system.  It also would have been nice to up date the firmware with the network (internet) connection instead of having to download the firmware onto a usb flash drive and then plugging it in to the TV.If you are in the market for an LCD, buy this model right now.

The A750 had some bad reviews about the glare on edges of the screen border.  The A650 did not!This was my first big ticket item I bought from Amazon.  The delivery went well.  I called CEVA and setup a time with them to bring it out. Two guys from CEVA carried the set in, unpacked it and pluged it in.  They were in a hurry but gave me a chance to check it out before I signed off the delivery release.Overall I'm very pleased with this set but I wanted to post the negitives I've had with it.  This is nit picking somewhat but I feel others can gain something from this - read below.Problems encountered: - The firmware needs some work.  I did NOT have the problem of the set turing off as some owners did, but I decided to update the firmware anyway.  The latest is always best, right?  Wrong!  After downloading firmware from Samsung, copying to my USB drive and plugging it into the TV the upgrade began.  Easy enough.  I was watching digital over the air TV as I had not yet got my Sat receiver yet.  When watching over the air the TV would suddenly make a LOUD full volume screaming sound out the speekers, then turn off, then back on for about 30 seconds, and crash again, turn off, turn on, crash... You get the idea.  Oh great I thought!!  Just killed my new tv!  I could not back out of the upgrade because Samsung does not post older versions of the firmware.  I had to search the internet to find it.  When I downgraded the firmware version the problem went away.  Pretty scary thinking I killed a $2200 TV set!  Samsung needs to get their act together on this.  Now that I have my Sat TV receiver hooked up via HDMI I'm able to use the latest firmware without problems.  If I were to guess, the firmware has an issue if the over the air TV signal is weak - causing the TV to crash.  (note to techies - the TV runs a custom version of Linux!!)Other negitives:* When switching inputs from one HDMI source to another, the set will not switch until about 4 seconds have gone by and it has 'locked' on the signal AND you've pressed enter.  A little annoying.  Could be fixed in software - (Hint hint Samsung!)* The remote is just OK, could be better for a set like this.* When watching the TV and the program suddenly goes from white to black for more then a few seconds, you will see the screen fade from a light white color to black.  Its almost like the LCD screen is un-charging.  I'm being very critial here and its not that noticeable.So.... Would I tell my friends to buy this TV.  YES!  Its well worth the money!  I read in the paper that Samsung is losing money for each set sold because they are trying to compete with the bargin brands.  Bad for Samsung, good for us customers!

I had some concerns before buying the TV since this is my first set that isn't a CRT and is far bigger than any TV I've owned.After some initial disappointment (due to my cable box being stuck outputting 480i) I have to say this TV is fantastic.  The out of the box picture settings are not fantastic, I found the normal, game and sports settings way too bright, but there are more settings than you can shake a stick at.  I'm no expert but after a lot of fiddling I have a setup I'm happy with.  The blacks are actually black, very black, the picture clarity is sharp and even the TV speaker is not horrible.  I was worried about how standard definition would look but I'm pleasantly surprised.  I've seen a number of other TV's in the same size range that look great with HD but pretty awful with SD.  Although SD is not a patch on HD and there are some stations that look better than others, the SD display is very good.  The most interesting feature on the TV is the 120Hz Auto Motion Plus.  I love it for sports and any other show that realistic movement is not a downside, eg talk shows, food network and cartoons to a certain extent.  For me it's not so great for movies and other shows filmed in the same type of format, it's just too realistic and looks not quite right.  I usually have it off or on low for these types of shows but I hear a lot of people love it.There are some other things that are nice.  Plenty of connections, although if you are hooking anything up using s-video the connection is only on the side, nice looking frame, pretty light for the size, nice viewing angle and nice menu structure.  There are also some downsides.  The \"iPod\" wheel on the remote feels flimsy and really doesn't need to be there, it's just dumb.  The frame especially does seem to attract a fair amount of dust as well.  None of the issues I have with it really detract from how good it is as a whole though.  One thing I found annoying is that when using the picture adjustments a lot of the features are locked depending on selections made elsewhere.  It would be nice if the manual included something that told you what selections lock others, maybe it's in there but I just haven't found it though.Overall I love the TV and would recommend it.  It's not cheap but I think it is worth the money based on how it performs now and with the features it has that should mean it shouldn't be out of date any time soon.As a final note to a select number of people.

All the great reviews on here and on other sites got me thinking about this particular brand and model.  I had little experience with HD TVs so I spent weeks reading about various models, the pros and cons of plasma versus LCD and other such info.  I checked review sites such as Consumer Reports and CNET to gain some understanding as to the quality afforded by various models.  I made numerous visits to the Best Buy showroom to look at this model in person and was blown away by its picture, as was the Best Buy salesperson with whom I spoke.  In fact they had a blu-ray movie playing on a 650 to show just how great the picture was!  Over time it became readily apparent to me that there was nothing out there at the price Amazon offered that I could get that would be any better.I ordered this TV from Amazon on Saturday, June 14; it shipped on Monday, June 16 and was in my living room by 11:30 AM Wednesday, June 18--and the shipping was free!  With no shipping fee, no sales tax and this low price on Amazon I saved hundreds over the best deal I could find at any local store. And over the next 30 days I got 3 refunds totalling $128 because of the price dropping on here--all I had to do was monitor the price each day and email Customer Service to request a refund when I saw a price reduction. It was easy to do and they quickly made a refund to my credit card each time.I find myself just sitting in front of this TV amazed at the clarity, the colors, the depth of blacks, the perfect motion...my friend bought a 52\" Sony Bravia model a month prior to my purchase and he wishes that he had seen this model on Amazon as he paid hundreds more for his TV but there appears to be no difference in the quality or performance! I find the surround sound to be very good and the overall sound to be definitely better than the sound on any other TV I have owned--I can't imagine how good it will be to watch a movie with this TV hooked to an ET system.

For slower motion scenes, everything looks so life like, it is like animated real life motion....some people may not like it cause it is so non-traditional tv like.

The TV, even though under 100 lbs. is still a load, especially when trying to access the connections in the back. The swivel feature obviously makes it much easier.

First, I would like to thank all the customers out there who take the time to write reviews. Many of the reviews were so helpful in figuring out what works best for our family's needs and wants.There are many more reviewers out there far more eloquent with words in describing the picture, so I will just say *WOW* and *AWESOME PICTURE*. The quality of the TV is just as good as we expected. The sound quality is not an issue for us as we already have a home theater system.

The delivery service that Amazon used to deliver our set was top-notch. The guys were so nice. I wasn't sure about ordering a TV through the internet, but between all the reviewers and Consumer Reports and personal positive experience with Amazon, I felt that the risk was minimal. Full disclosure... A big motivator to order from Amazon was the price - about $830 less than the local BB store. I did a lot of research on flat screen TVs and feel that we made a winning choice.  Originally I had decided that a plasma (also Samsung) was the right choice. But when we looked at it in the BB, we felt it was way too reflective. My family liked the LCD better because the reflections in the plasma were just too distracting. I agreed. I had not looked at LCDS, because I was concerned that the blacks would be too dull. We looked at the Samsung LCD and thought it was similar enough to the plasma in terms of the vividness of black, yet was not as reflective. So, back to the internet I went to scour reviews and shop prices on the Samsung LCD. The reflectiveness of the screen was a concern I saw in other reviews, but I hardly noticed it compared to the plasma we nearly bought. The frame is reflective, but I don't notice it though others might find it distracting.We are so pleased with the TV and the service.

First, the Touch of Color is very difficult to discern in the store - once the set is in your room, it is more evident. Fortuanately, I like it. Secondly, unlike many LCDs, these models have a reflective surface, just like plasma. If the room has a lot of reflective light, then you may want to consider other LCDs or even Plasma. The 50\" Samsung Plasma was far cheaper than the 52\"LCD. Again, not a problem for my set-up. Third, the set comes mounted on a swivel stand. This capability was an important capability in my room set up. I found that not all sets swivel.The set arrived in a timely manner, though the white glove service was a bit disappointing. While \"set-up\" was promised, it was far less than that. They take it out of the box, place it on furniture and plug it into an outlet and verify \"blue screen\". In my case, they said it was too cold to risk plugging it in, so they left. After a couple of hours, plugged it in, connected components and everything worked beautifully. Only have a set top box that is digital, bought an HDMI cable through Amazon, but it did not work with the set-top box. Don't know whether it is the HDMI cable, the set-top box or the TV. I am still trying to verify if the TV is the problem. All of the component connections work just fine; they were well marked, easy to get to (and there are lots of them!), which is a good thing.A couple of annoyances to consider. the TV controls are invisible on the lower right front panel - making them virtually useless. You have to use the remote, which is the other annoyance. It uses a track wheel for Menu set-up and adjustments (setting time, color balance, etc.). It just does not work well, seemingly \"jumping\" to an unintended, adjacent selection. Basic set-up can take far longer than it should and tests one's patience. The user manual is pretty intimidating, but take your time and it all comes together.I researched models and sales outlets thoroughly before selecting the Samsung 650 from Amazon - looked at LG, Panasonic, Sony and others - off-brand and high-end, the Samsung LCD is the best value and it showed up on all the recommended picks, far more than any other brand.

It was not a problem.  He was familiar with the TV and got it up and running in just a couple of minutes.  The unit itself is beautiful.  The TOC (red) in the frame matches perfectly our Mexican decor in our family room.  The physical appearance is an issue because our old Hitachi projection TV that it replaced was so ugly that my wife called the company and complained.

I have done nothing fancy as far as picture setting go--I keep it pretty much on the factory defaults.

I went to several stores looked at the tv screens pictures and then researched the features for each tv on the internet. I felt like the Samsung was the best tv I could buy in my price range. It had all the features I was looking for. I bought it at Amazon which was $200.00 cheaper than at any of the retail stores pre Christmas prices. I thought the stores might discount them further after Christmas so I held off. Well after Christmas the stores raised the price $200.00. So I bought from Amazon. I got the TV well before the arrival date shown. I think it took a week or less to appear on my doorstep.  I could go through a lot of the features it has but the main one that I liked  was that the 650 has a volume leveler. I was tired of having to raise and lower the volume from tv programs and commercials or other tv shows. I wired it with HDMI in but then ran an optical digital line from the tv to my receiver. It is not perfect but it does help with leveling out the volume.  The other cool feature that I like is DNEI (I had never heard of it). I came across it in the manual. I turned it from off to on and man I couldn't beleive my eyes. On certain movies it makes it look like you are right in the scene with the actors. I was watching \"The One\" with Jet Lee. It was an amazing experience. It also worked with network tv when I watched the movie \"The Last Templer\". (Stupid movie by the way) Mira Sorvino must have been hard up for some money.  This TV replaced my Toshiba 50\" which had a good picture and sound but this tv is even better and I got the updated technology and 2 more inches of veiwing space for the same price as the Toshiba I had bought 4 to 6 years ago. I thought it was a bargain and gave my toshiba to my brother. The sound on the tv had some bad reveiws but I tested it out before I wired the optical cable to my receiver.

I went with the 650 because it provides the best image quality for the buck, and because I didn't need the gimmicky packaged-in content (750) or additional thinness (850). the 650 has the same *excellent* image quality, and a straightforward design.i was a bit hesitant about buying it online, and would have got the TV in Best Buy if their sales people had been a bit more competent (they tell me it's out of stock, and called me back an hour later to say they had one in, which screams \"return\" to me).  i should not have worried - the delivery from CEVA here in the bay area is fantastic. they said it would be a 12-6pm window, but they arrived at 12.15pm. and did a great job, friendly and helpful. i am not sure if you're supposed to tip them, but they were so good that i did. so don't hesitate to benefit from amazon's excellent offers (they beat the best buy price by several hundred bucks).a lot is said about reflections from the glossy screen. it truly makes no difference to me, and our TV family room is far from the perfect TV environment - the entire side of the room is glass. of course we have blinds that can shut it down, but most of the time we leave it open, and it's not an issue with this TV even on sunny california days. the \"red touch\"? invisible as far as i am concerned...and the Samsung worked great from the get go. my sources are- Comcast HDTV digital cable with DVR recording capability- Roku Netflix box- Panasonic DVD player/recorderMany HDTV channels look stunning. Some barely improve on their STD equivalent and should give them away to those who are willing to do more with the bandwidth, really. But HBO in HD (HBO boxing in HD is awesome!), or the tennis matches from Australia - wow. if you were still having some buyer's remorse it'll fade right then and there. all the stuff they talked about when it comes to LCD image quality (ghosting etc) is *gone*. fast objects move smoothly and sharply. my misgivings and worries about having to live with reduced contrast compared to my old XBR TV are gone - this beats that TV by a mile.the SDTV channels are a mixed lot. some look quite acceptable, but some look downright horrible. i was watching the John Stewart show on comedy channel and it too me a while to adjust - between the big 52 inch and the resolution you are missing out on, you keep wishing for more. this TV is so revealing that it is quite cruel to a poor source. keep that in mind.the Roku netflix box offers an HDMI interface and these days they support both standard and HD content, and both look very good on this TV. it is very interesting to watch what netflix labels 4-star quality SDTV on the samsung, though, because again, it is very revealing. netflix obviously uses some compression algorithm to provide very good quality over the internet. which -even when you get 4 star reception- results in interesting artifacts in very dynamic scenes that reveal both the netflix compression and the way the samsung tries to go about improving quality by interpolating pixels in increasingly small squares. i was watching \"apocalypto\" (very rich visuals despite the overall depressing content) and it was quite clear in the fast paced scenes, like the jungle escape where the captors make sport of mowing down the poor sods that they encourage to run. if there is a way to optimize performance for this (quality, not the ability to successfully escape captors :-)), i'd be interested to learn. but as a rule, when you have 4 star SDTV reception quality is great (depending on how good the original is), and HD is downright great.which deserves a short detour into setup: i find the standard settings great, the only thing i have done, in the interest of power consumption, is to go for \"power savings\" to be set to \"low\", which lower brightness, and power consumption by about 30 Watt or so. the medium and high setting could possibly work in darker settings, or if my electricity bill gets too high. :-) with the old TV the entire setup would consume around 190W when up, with the Samsung set to standard with low power saving the new setup gobbles up 270W... finally, on setup: [...] again, i played around with it, and hardly saw a difference, and kind of prefer the standard settings as a more versatile setting.the panasonic player provides images that reveal the differences in compression you chose to record them. you will really see the difference - again, this TV reveals everything.standard DVDs also look great. some of them, like \"walking with dinosaurs\", look to be near HDTV quality, the TV does an excellent job in generating the best possible quality when the source is good, even when it is not a native HDTV source, i guess the \"upsampling\" algorithms are pretty smart, and that the source has to be pretty poor for the upsampling to not provide very good results.i should note that the build-in speakers are actually pretty good - even though i don't use them, i hooked the TV's audio out to external speakers right away. i wish the audio-out provided variable levels that could be controlled with the remote - they are fixed level, great if you go for a receiver/amplifier, less optimal if you are directly driving powered speakers like i do (i opted to invest into a very clean sounding 2:1 setup rather than all-out surround).i should note i use component cables between the cable box and the dvd-r and the TV. the TV does an excellent job in automatically detecting the image's resolution and format based on channel and source.so i am extremely happy with this purchase, the image quality right out of the box is amazing. great TV. and a fantastic price for the size and stunning image quality.", "Date": "January 28, 2009"}, {"Title": "can it be too good?", "Author": "Kevin Tipton", "ReviewID": "R3VXHL1G62OWOE", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I have had this television for three weeks now.

I have researched so many TV's and nothing else comes close to the Samsung 650's feature set and picture quality.  For a lot of people the decision starts with Plasma or LCD and for me that was easy.  I love the picture of an LCD TV/Monitor, the colors seem to be much more vibrant with LCD.  I watched this TV many times and compared the picture to all those around it at my local tech store(It's Blue and begins with B).  The Sony KDL-52W4100 is really the only other TV I was considering because I like Sony products and it has a similar price to the Samsung.  The Sony has a nice picture but after watching both TV's side by side I noticed more detail and richer color from the Samsung.  That was all I needed to decide on the Samsung.  The one thing that bothered me was the \"Red Touch of Color\" on the Samsung but it does look sharp once you see it.  Picture quality is amazing with very deep black levels and a high contrast ratio (50,000:1).  The 120Hz function is a nice touch but you don't even need to use it to get a nice smooth picture.  The TV does a good job at up scaling your basic cable stations and those HD channels look really nice.  Full HD through HDMI is where this TV really shines.  After hooking up my PS3 and watching the Blu-Ray \"Planet Earth\" I was floored by the picture.  The scenes from the movie are simply amazing from Mountains to Deserts to The Ocean, it looks great.  Standard DVD's are up scaled nicely and bring out a lot of extra detail than with your standard TV and player.  I heard people talk about up scaled DVD's being as good as Blu-Ray and I think that they may come close but Blu-Ray has a definite edge especially when sitting up close.  I found the sound quality to be pretty good on this TV, while it could benefit from a nice audio receiver the speakers get the job done.  The features of this TV are the best I know of.  There are so many options to adjust picture and audio settings, you have full control over how your TV looks and sounds.  The inputs on the TV are also quite generous with all the standard component and composite connections you would expect on an HDTV along with 4 HDMI ports and a USB port for Music, Pictures and Firmware Updates.  One feature I found really cool is that when you adjust the picture settings on an input source like HDMI those settings stay custom to that source.  This means that every HDMI port can have it's own settings saved in the TV's memory.  This is great because while one picture setting works on a device it may not look as good on another and need to be adjusted.  This also works on cable channels too, when you set your settings on an HD station all the other HD stations use those settings same is true for SD channels.  Shipping was great for me, I live close to the CEVA distribution center so I got it fast(Order on Dec. 19th Delivered Dec. 22nd).  Overall I am very happy with the TV and my experience with Amazon and wouldn't think twice about doing it again.

The greatest part is, that this TV set produces an excellent picture already, WITHOUT these features, whereas other sets use those same features as gimmicks to make a below average picture look mildly acceptable.

HD channels picture quality is awesome so I would assume anything fed to the TV with atleast a 720P resolution would look great. I even used a USB drive to view photos, again loved the way they were displayed and the slideshow functionality. I wish I had opted for the A750 that includes the mpeg functionality through the USB. :-)The only problem that I have faced so far is when I connected the pioneer dvd player, the menu and the initial startup image was not displayed immediately and the message 'Mode not supported' was displayed. However, when I hit play, the movie came on and then I could activate the menu. Weird but probably has something to do with resolution incompatibility.Cannot wait to wall mount and conceal the wiring now :-))Would definitely recommend to anyone looking for a 52\". Cannot go wrong here...5 stars for delivery by CEVA/Eagle, Amazon for the unbeatable price and Samsung for the production quality.", "Date": "September 28, 2008"}, {"Title": "First HDTV has spoiled me", "Author": "O.

I am no videophile but everything positive I've read about this tv seems to me to be true; the color and clarity are amazing and (especially) compared to some of my friends HDTVs that are not 120hz, the motion is smooth.The only issue I ran into with the tv ended up being a mistake on my part where I didn't understand the difference between AV & Component. I was trying to get my Wii to play via Component while plugged into the AV2. Whoops.I contacted Samsung's online support and it was a mixed bag: the first rep tried to talk me into flashing the firmware with the latest version online (2001.3) but luckily I realized rather quickly that the firmware on my TV (2003.0) was newer and thus probably wasn't the problem.So I contacted a second support rep.

Mcnamara", "ReviewID": "R1IYGDM63CDVHK", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Lots has been written about the quality of the picture, so I will just say everything written has been my experience also. Awesome picture. It blows away everything else I looked at in the stores and now in our home, it is even better.Spend some time playing with the menu settings if for nothing else just seeing how much control you have over the picture. The menu is pretty well laid out and easy to make changes (although the remote's scroll wheel is a little frustrating). Menu changes take place right away making it easier to see what you have done without having to exit and re-enter the menu systeam again and again.Some notes on my setup so that it may help some others having any issues.TV connected to Comcast DVR (motorola) which seesm to only output 1080i max. Not sure if Comast has newer DVR boxes that offer 1080p or not. Will have to check on that. Might also be a Comcast cable limitation. But  the picture still looks pretty great, so I don't see an issue here. I found that newer HDMI 1.3 cables did not work well with this box. I could sometimes get it to work on the side HDMI 4 input, but usually the TV said no cable was connected. I simply used my older HDMI cable plugged into the HDMI 2 input and I now have no problems.Using a PS3 for games and Blu-Ray movies. At first the picture was really odd looking. Movies looked like video games almost with sharp looking actors against an odd background. Hard to describe but it looks wrong. Same with regular DVDs. Traced this back to the 120mhz refresh being on and when I turned this off, the movies looked great. So you might want to turn this off and on depending on what you are watching. Using an HDMI 1.3 cable here and it works fine.Also got a Samsung HTZ-310 DVD/surrond player. It really integrates well with the Samsung TV, doing little things like changing the TV input to DVD (HDMI 3 in my case) when I put a DVD in.For sound, I use an optical audio cable from the TV to the surround sound. This way I get surround on evrything: PS3, Cable and DVD's. Set the surround sound to Digital In for this set up.I also have a Harmony 550 remote and it has worked well so far. I have used one on my previous TV (moving to the basement) so I got this (only $49 at the time on Amazon, although the price fluctuates a lot). Everything works great. It will turn on the cable box, TV and surround sound, set the proper input and tyhe surround to D.In and I'm good to go. Highly recommended as the Samsung remotes are kind of big and bulky.Delivery was not great, but certainly not a deal breaker (especially for free). You have to wait for the service to call you to set up an appointment time, for me between 12 and 5. Only one guy was doing the delivery (from CEVA) which seems totally wrong on items with such a large box. I did not appreciate the way he turned the box over to get it up my steps. He also took off right away before I even took it out of the box. Certainly not white glove. So, delivery could be better (maybe it varies by city) but I really did not have an issue with the TV related to the delivery, so I guess it was all OK in the end.Anyway, I would not hesitate to buy from Amazon. Wait until you are totally ready however as the price seems to keep dropping every week. I purchased in August while they still had the price guarantee. I called back after the price dropped $130 and got a refund. Now it is $50 cheaper again.

Even the Dish Tech that put in the new box for this set commented on the fact that the Mitsubishi was better. Believe me I am also happy with the Samsung which resides in my loft.  Where the problem comes in is that the sound is very bad. I have gone through all the options, which are many but I can not get any combination that sounds clear.

At first I was hesitant buying from Amazon in case I needed to return for any reason, I knew it would be a hassle (reshipping the item and all).  So I went to my local Best Buy and Circuit City where the TV was $700 more and asked if they could match it (it would be easier to return it there if need be).  Best Buy would only come down to $100 over the Amazon price, and then you'd have to add the 10.25% Chicago tax, which is another couple hundred dollars (Amazon had free shipping on this item).  Also, Amazon dropped the price $127 AFTER I ordered the TV and BEFORE it had been delivered.  After calling their great support line they were kind enough to reimburse me the $127.  I have absolutely no complaints in ordering from Amazon.I did a lot of research using several websites and publications (CNET.com, Consumer Reports, etc.) and this TV always ranked in the top for 10 for 50\" and larger LCD TV's.  Then I went to the stores in person to check for myself (I whole-heartedly agreed).  The TV looks stellar with more clarity than my previous 42\" Dell plasma, which had a great picture, but died.  Also, Samsung is listed at the top in television reliability, which is important to me based on my last large TV purchase (Dell was dead last in reliability and no longer makes TV's!!!).  No more glare than my Dell plasma and my living room is surrounded by windows on the East and North sides.  Glare is not an issue with this TV as it is so bright and vibrant.  The value for the money is great too!  I spent about $2500 for my 42\" Dell just over 2 years ago, and this 52\" TV was more than $500 cheaper!

This is crazy since you can use another credit card to purchase the gift card???

After days of being on the phone and computer, following Amazon's advice, it still didn't process(they had problems with their gift card site).

What upset me the most, was that not one agent could stay with me through the transaction until the problem was resolved. I would call and explain everything, the agent would recommend something for me to do online, it wouldn't work,I would call back, get a different agent, go through the whole story again.

ALMOST two years.  A couple of weeks ago it started turning itself on and off for no reason.  We figured it was our television provider and didn't think too much about it.  Then last week two vertical white lines appeared on either side of the picture before it turned itself on and off.  I called Verizon who checked their box and said it was a television issue.  Since then, the television has been displaying the white lines (which disappear if you manually turn it off and on) and continuing to go off/on.  In the last day or so the sound goes off, there is a buzzing, and then the television turns off and on.  Every 3-5 minutes.  Upon reading other reviews we went to the Samsung site and downloaded and installed the \"fix\", to no avail.  Samsung Customer Service doesn't want to address the issue that many of their customers are having with this television.  Their mantra seems to be \"We are sorry, it's out of warranty.  We apologize for any inconvenience this may have caused you.\"  I politely informed the Customer Service Representatives that this seems to be a prevalent problem with this particular unit, and was met with the same response.  The reviewers are all saying the same thing -- Samsung refuses to answer the question and stand by the product when they have a systemic known faulty product line/issue.UPDATE:  TV repair shop came to the house, took the TV, replaced the defective capacitors in power supply, returned the TV two weeks later, plugged it in and IT DID IT AGAIN.  Took the TV for another two weeks, replaced the board, brought it back last week and it started the power on/off issue again yesterday.

They were extremely open for me to come and pick it up myself (I was anxious to get it!).  The box was in great shape and the TV couldn't be more perfect.  Plus, with Amazon having free shipping for it and the fact that there isn't tax charged for MD, I saved a bucket of cash after their initial sale on this TV.

Great price, great delivery, greatest of all was the product.  The Samsung 52a650 LCD TV worked, letter perfect, right out of the box.I agree, that the input options on the TV could be improved, but there are enough for most applications and everything that I needed to attach.  I did my homework using the tech stuff (like 120 hs refresh rate, or 4 ms paint, and millions of colors) to compare the top sets below $2,500.  The two which seemed always to be on top were the Sony Brava 52-6x and the Samsung 52a650.  Generally, price put the Sony in second place, as it was always $300 to $500 more then the Samsung.Finally, Amazon Wearhouse deals came into play.  I could not be more pleased with top quality, mint contidion, open box sale.  Every aspect of the purchase was as expected or better then expected.  The outside of the box was damaged, but everything inside was brand new, sealed, just as advertized to be in Mint condition.Finally, I came to the acid test, to make my wife happy.  The touch of red case, the overall look, and the ease of operations all were a plus.  Bottom line, though, was the picture quality in 1080p and with Dish HD.  We both agree that viewing non-HD shows on this TV leaves something to be desired.  In fact our older Sony analog 35\" is better for that, but clearly the WOW factor is present when you're viewing HD on the Samsug 52a660 LCD set.  Once you have one of these set up in your home, you can never go back to non-HD again.  I am now spoiled.

I have my laptop hooked up to the TV, so I can watch movies thru Netflix.  The only negative was the price. I got it at a reasonable price, but the following week, it drop almost $200.  It is what it is.  I had some issues with the delivering company. It was only one guy and I had to tell him to unbox the TV and I had to help him put it on my TV stand.

It is everything we could have asked for without any troubles whatsoever.  Once we narrowed it down to the Samsung models, we had to decide which model.  The 550 was older technology so it was out (even though it is a great tv for the price) the 850 was really nice but $600 more than the 650 and the 750 was about $100 more but we didn't like the bezel or the possible 'halo' effect that has been mentioned.  After deciding on the 650 and placing the order, everything since has gone great.  Delivery was fine, they called to schedule the appointment and they showed up on time.  I have run through all the menus on the TV and everything was easy to understand.  I haven't tried to calibrate all the color settings but I'll get to it.  I never realized how much better the clarity is on HDTV until now.  Wow is an understatement, it is awesome.  My friend has a really good 720 plasma but this 1080p LCD is so much cleaner.

It makes my old 1080i DLP 52\" look as if it wasn't even HD.  Also the non-HD playback is very decent.  I priced out TV's at Costco, Samsclub, Best Buy, and this TV which is easily superior in video playback quality to anything the chains carried was significantly cheaper from Amazon, than the lesser quality screens from the big box stores.Cons:  I've had a little trouble with Audio for my PC.  According to the manual if you use HDMI 2 from a pc, you can connect an RCA cord for audio in.  I don't know if it's poor documentation or just a menu setting but I wasn't able to get audio from my pc.  I ended up plugging in pc speakers directly to the PC instead.  The sheer coolness of running 1920x1080 on a 52\" monitor made up for any problems I had with PC audio.  Fallout 3 looks amazing!  Oh, one last thing.  It may be worth going with the next model up for better audio quality.  The 650 model has kind of weak bass.

Delivery was on time and we were able  to track it daily on line. Delivery crew set it up for us on our table and even moved our old media cabinet upstairs for us. We saved a considerable amount of money by using Amazon as our local stores were charging delivery and other fees for items which we really did not need.

When we got it, there were a few minor complaints, like the remote is directionally sensitive.  You can't point it anywhere from the middle left, or up.  You have to point it toward the bottom right of the TV for it to work.  At the beginning we would be trying to change something and nothing would be happening.  You can't just have it on a stand like we used to next to your couch and push the volume up a few times.  You have to pick it up and point it at the TV.  My wife would be pointing the remote from her walking machine on the left side of the couch and couldn't get the remote to increase the volume of the TV when she was pointing it right at it, I played with it and got it to work if you leaned over or pointed clear down at the bottom right.  The sound could be better.  But the reason we got it was for the picture and that was amazing, with no complaints.  The delivery was impeccable.  The guys were courteous, set it up, tested it, asked if I wanted the box removed, but recommended I keep it, etc.  No problems there.However, exactly one month after the delivery, it suddenly developed a row or two of dead pixels horizontally across about 4 inches up from the bottom.  It was distracting and annoying.  I called in for repair and by the time they came out and looked and then ordered the part and got back, it was over 3 weeks later before it was fixed.  They guy had to replace the whole screen on it.  I asked if this is a common problem and he said that it is getting to be, so it sounds like they are seeing more of these problems now.  He said that it is more usually for the line to be vertical instead of horizontal like mine was.  I asked how much this would be once it is out of warranty and he laughed and said to just throw away the TV and get another one, that the replacement screen costs more than I would have paid for the TV.It did get fixed and is back to it's former glory, but I am not feeling so great good about this now.  To spend so much and be faced with the thought of it going partially dead after a year and either having to buy a whole new TV or try and ignore a row of dead pixels is not too thrilling.  I just hope that it is one of those things that if it lasts past a year, then it will be ok and last a long time.  I never buy extended warranty, as on the camera I once did, I never used it and by the time it stopped focusing well, I wanted a better model anyway.

I even went so far as to register for it, not that I really thought anyone would spring for a gift that expensive.  Once the wedding came and went, my wife and I decided to buy ourselves a big screen TV as a wedding gift to ourselves.Once I got the green light from the Mrs., I began to do more extensive research which included a visit to a local chain store to see my options.  Upon walking in, I was immediately struck by the picture on a Samsung LN52A850 that they had displayed right near the door.  Further investigation showed that the 750 and 850 models had features that I don't need or want and the LN52A650 had the same picture.  The slam dunk came when I saw a 650 displayed right next to the Sony XBR6 -- the Samsung had a much sharper picture with more realistic color tones and more attractive styling.  Then, as if to eliminate all doubt, an issue of Consumer Reports landed in my mailbox the same week and inside was a review of big screen TVs that had the Samsung LN52A65O number one of all LCD TVs.  End of discussion.After checking prices everywhere, Amazon's price was at least $100 less than every other price I found and with no shipping or sales tax.  I paid exactly $1,799.  The price seems to fluctuate daily but I have found it to be lowest on Sundays, for whatever reason.  I bought the TV on Sunday, February 1st with an expected delivery date of Monday, February 9th which seemed fair given the no cost shipping.  The TV shipped early Monday morning via Pilot Freight and, incredibly, I received a call from Pilot on Tuesday afternoon telling me that the TV was in Connecticut and could be delivered to me on Thursday the 5th!  Woo hoo!!!  As it turns out, I couldn't be home to receive it that day so I arranged for delivery on Monday the 9th which is the first day of my vacation.Pilot subcontracted the delivery to a local moving company and, having been given a delivery window of 11-3, the truck arrived at about 11:30.  Two fellows unloaded a very large box, carried it into my living room, opened the box, removed all of the protective wrapping and placed it upon my stand.  They advised me that because the outside temperature was below 50F they couldn't plug it and turn it on.  So I was only asked to sign a statement that there was no physical damage to the TV.After a couple of (long) hours, I finally fired it up and I have to say it is breathtaking.  The 1080i HD that Comcast delivers looks stunning.  And even standard definition is quite good.  I haven't even had a chance to play a blu-ray movie.  I'm sure it will be unbelieveable.  The Touch of Color is a non-issue -- only visible if you look for it and even then it is hard to see.  The screen glare is not a problem but I don't have direct sunlight on it.  The frame of the TV is much more glossy and even that doesn't cause a problem.I would have liked one more AV input (yellow-red-white) on the back as there is only one (there is a second one on the side) but that is a minor quibble.  I've connected the cable box and blu-ray via HDMI which is a thing of beauty.  The swivel stand is a nice feature as is the rubberized bottom of the stand.All in all, one of the best purchases I have ever made.  I bought the 3-year extended warranty which seemed like it was free after saving so much money at Amazon.One more added bonus...I offered the two delivery guys $50 each to haul my massive 36\" CRT TV upstairs to our den.  Happily, they took me up on it.  Another home run since I could have never done it myself.

Previously I'd bought only books from Amazon and had some concern about buying a large TV on line.  I decided to go ahead based on the good reviews, Amazon's warrantee/return policies and their service, and the price.  Each was much better than anything local. I'm very happy with the results.The TV is great -- I high recommend it.  The delivery service was also great, beyond expectation -- Seven days total, several calls from the freight company (Pilot) to advise me of the schedule. The delivery man was very experienced with these TVs, knew what to look for (he said he had delivered many and had encountered two with screen damage), and how to safely handle it.  He unpacked it, carried it upstairs, removed my old CRT TV from its stand and placed the HDTV there.  He hooked up the cable and turned it on.  I was able to verify it was in perfect condition before signing anything.  He carried the packing box to the attic (I'm keeping it a while just in case...).  We've used the TV for almost three weeks and have had no problems.  I highly recommend this TV, Amazon, and the shipping service.The picture quality is wonderful. I won't go into that as it is well described in many comments.Several comments that are minor but perhaps of interest --1) As others have noted, that silly ring around the 4-way controller on the remote can be aggrevating -- it makes using the controller difficult.  I solved this by putting a piece of scotch tape over the controller and ring so the ring won't rotate -- problem solved.  (I first thought of but quickly dismissed a drop of super glue.)2)  Connecting a component Home Theater system is turning out to be less straight forward than I expected.  My wife uses the TV more than I and would like to do so without the HTR.  To achieve this result, I thought I could simply connect the TV to my cable box and other components with HDMI cables, and connect audio from the TV to the HTR with component or optical cables.  The Samsung remote has one button that makes selection of a video/audio source very easy.  I now understand that the connection is a bit more complicated.  According to the Samsung manual on page 11 and a big surprise to me, \"When the TV is displaying a DTV (air) signal, the TV will send 5.1 sound to the HTR.  When the source is a digital component such as a DVD and is connected to the TV via HDMI, only 2 channel sound will be heard from the HTR.\"  To hear 5.1 sound through the HTR, component cables or optical cables must ALSO be run from the cable box or other components to the HTR.3) I've found the manual to be very clear in describing how to operate all the features of the TV.  (Figuring out what exactly all the features are or do is less clear.)  An aggrevating part of the manual are the page numbers which are printed in black type and are highlighted (covered) by a dark gray box, rendering them invisible except in good light. If one is watching the TV in a medium dark room and wants to use the manual's table of contents and then find the page number, forget it, or keep a flashlight handy.Each of the above is minor -- none are reasons not to buy this TV.Regarding Touch of Color.  We like it and would think most would like it.  I'm surprised that some do not.  If you are concerned, take a look at a store model and determine this before buying it.  It seems a bit unfair to rate it down, already knowing what would look like.Finally, we have found the sound quality to be poor.

I was concerned about the Red Touch of Color, but was able to see it in person at a local store and was pleasantly surprised it was so subtle.  Unless you know it's there, it's hard to see - yet gives an elegant slight glow to the edges of the unit.I subscribed to HD programming through Dish Network when I bought the set.  The color and clarity of this TV is amazing.  I've seen no problems with blur or bad blacks in various programming that LCD's sometimes have problems with.  The AnyNet feature (that automatically turns the TV on when a connected device, like a DVD player is turned on) is a great feature, though I'm having a few issues with it.  If I turn on the DVD player - which automatically turns the TV on and sets the source to HDMI Theater, then want to switch TV sources to HDMI Satellite, the DVD player turns off.  I don't like this lack of control, so hope to find a way to disable the AnyNet at my choosing.My parents bought a 46\" Sony Bravia XBR4 in 2007 and it's a wonderful TV.  I love my Samsung more.  I like the black frame because it blends better into the backround than silver framed units.I spent quite a bit of time viewing the Samsung 46\" and the 52\" because my room is somewhat small (12' x 15') and I sit 9' from the TV - I was concerned the 52\" would be overwhelming.  It's not.  I replaced a 36\" CRT that looked HUGE because of the big box.  This 52\" Samsung actually looks smaller.I definitely recommend this television.", "Date": "January 18, 2009"}, {"Title": "After several months of research and side by side comparisons", "Author": "Eduardo A. Pineda", "ReviewID": "R34FGOJGEWHAR", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I had a sony projection HDTV that was about 4 years old and needed to be replaced, so I spent about three months researching HDTVs. Initially, I was sure I would get a Plasma tv because they had better reviews on picture quality, black depth (important if you like to watch movies with the light down), and response time. The Samsung 650 was on my short list but I wasn't going to make the final decision until I saw a side by side comparison. I'm not a pro, but I can usually tell the difference between LCDs and Plasmas when I'm in a showroom especially in fast moving or dark scenes. I thought the 650 was as good as the panasonic 800U plasma which was my first choice at the time. I played around with the picture settings on both, to the point that some B.Buy employees were giving me the stink eye a little. The 650 had brighter colors without loosing the black depth that I like, and the blurring effect from regular LCD was not noticeable thanks to the 120hz processing. The 800U/850U panasonic was just as good so I made my decision based on several other factors.1.  The 650 was cheaper than the comparable plasma by about $100-2002.  You get extra 2 inches with and LCD (52\" LCD vs 50\" Plasma), 2 inches isn't much but I'll take it.3.  Turns out the plasmas take more energy/$ to run, some energy websites put the difference at about $50 bucks a year.4.  The LCD weight about 70lbs while the Plasmas are closer to 100lbs, makes a big difference if you hang it on a wall, a lighter load sits more secure.5.  LCDs picture looks much better when hooked up to a PC, which I routinely do.6.  The TV design is very elegant, the glass look of the bezel makes it very attractive and the touch buttons are embedded in the frame so the tv looks smooth throughtout.Issues reported by others- The TOC red bezel:  The bezel looks has a dark burgundy rim around the outer 1inch edge. Hardly noticible under normal light conditions, It's not noticeable at night. Unless you point it out to people, they won't see it.- Reflective screen:  This could be a major issue if your TV is placed across from the window as mine is, and the sun is shining right on it. Otherwise the screen is not worst than a any other TV. I solved it by getting darker curtains (brown curtains look nice in an off-white room) and by buying a tilting wall mount, which blocks the light from the top of the curtain where the suns light is brigthest. I have a mount from amazon too (~$40), the stores were selling them for $150+. I got the HDMI 1.3v from here too for about ~$10, not $50+ like at the stores. I guess the stores see the accesories as their way to recover reduced sale prices.- The sound quality: You won't get the same reaction from seeing the tv as you will from hearing it, the sound is simply adequate. The sound is fine for watching sitcoms, the news, or any regular tv programming, but you'll want to hook up your audio systems action shows like 24, Heroes, Sports, and especially dvd/blu-ray movies. To be fair, I would turn on my audio system even if this tv had a better sound system. Who buys this tv and not have at least surround stereo or 5.1 system?Minor Cons,- There's a 2-5 second lag in signal when switching between standard and HDTV sources (my old TV did the switch in 1-2 seconds)- The clickwheel on the remote is not as responsive as an ipod wheel, takes about 1/2 turn to move the menu choice- The push buttons on the TV itself are very well hidden, almost too well hiddenAnyway, the picture is just as great as others describe in this forum. The experience with amazon was very quick and painless. I received the TV in 4 business days after. The delivery company was CEVA logistics and they had their own tracking on their website along with amazon's own tracking system. I got a call the day before delivery and they offered morning or afternoon delivery. You should have the place where the TV will be placed ready because 'white glove delivery' just means that they bring it in, unpack it, and turn the power on to show that it works.", "Date": "January 14, 2009"}, {"Title": "Best Shopping Experience", "Author": "Kathy M.

At the time, that was most important until we realize just how much better the picture quality is.  The TV works great in all lighting situations, at least in our house.  We have many different components and having 4 HDMI ports makes a big difference.  Playing video games with the kids is a blast!  The picture refresh speed is amazing, we have yet to come across any situation where we experience any \"blur\" or \"spottiness\" on the screen.  We bought the TV a month ago and I just discovered the picture-in-picture feature which is incredibly handy on football days :)  The kids played a video game while my husband could keep an eye on the scores.

So far it was easy to set up, delivery was great, got it 5 days and the white glove service was fine. I had read a few bad reviews of that service but in Denver it was fine. They called a couple days ahead to schedule delivery.  They delivered it within the 4 hour window they provided, two guys brought it into the home, removed it from the box, put it on our entertainment center, plugged it in, I helped with the wiring to the cable box and DVD player.  They turned it on, checked to make sure it got tv reception, offered to take the box, you sign some paper work and done.  For this size TV it was much better than buying an item at the store and having to figure out if or how it will fit in our car.As far as the TV, it is beautiful.  I can't really say how it compares to the other brands.  I think there are a lot of good technically oriented reviews on Amazon and Cnet that can help with that.  I was looking mainly at the Sony W series, and the Samsung 750 in addition to this one.  I at least looked at the other brands but they all seemed to be a half step below the Sony and Samsung.  It probably is just based on marketing that I have that impression than on real facts.For my decision, the only important differences between the Sony and Samsung were the matte of the screen and the number of reviews.  There are so many people that have reviewed the Samsung 650 on the site vs any other brand or model of Samsung that I decided these at least had sold a ton and the reviews were still almost the same on average as the Sony.The TV does sit in a room with a lot of windows so glare was a bit of a concern with me.  Now that it is in the room, the colors of the screen are so bright, the glare is not distracting, and at night, the color is incredible, but again, I'm not that picky.  It was so great watching the bowl games and playoff games on this TV.  One other thing I noticed is non HD channels don't look any worse on this TV than our 3 year old 40\" LCD.

As near to perfection as I think any TV can be! Okay, the sound isn't the greatest. But we did use just the tv sound for about 3 days and it was quite acceptable until we bought and hooked up a Sony HT-C100 (Walmart $256) soundbar system. We aren't audiophiles, but the TV does lack a little if you want that theater experience. And as most on here and other review sites have already mentioned, most of us who are buying a TV of this caliber won't mind investing a few hundred more for a sound boost.The capabilities of this set are truly amazing. But keep in mind that source is paramount. We have watched blu-ray (got the Samsung player offered with this for $150 off) and you just can't imagine how incredible it is. We have a Dish 622 DVR and most HD programming is outstanding. Not all HD is created equal though, but you can expect this set to provide you with the best picture your source has to offer. We have played around some with the various picture settings and it is great to have so many options to tweak to your own personal likes and dislikes. Maybe a better picture could be obtained with a calibration dvd or a professional but I can't imagine getting it much better than you could yourself. It's already that good. And I have had our bedroom tv (Samsung 42\" dlp) and our former living room tv (Panasonic 47\" HD rear projection) calibrated professionally. It did help both of those sets. But this one is far superior without calibration than either of those afterward.I would also like to comment on Amazon as a seller. The morning after I placed the order, the price dropped $100. Because the tv had not been shipped (that is now their policy), they gave me the credit. However, when I had placed the order, the blu-ray offer was for $200 off making the player \"free\". By the time the tv shipped, the blu-ray offer was only $150 off and that was changed on my order summary to reflect that. All of this is just very minor, but I thought it might be useful to anyone who finds themselves in a similar situation. Bottom line is we got the tv and blue-ray for less than I could find for just the tv by itself anywhere else. And of course, no tax, no shipping charge. Our order was placed on Friday, received the blu-ray on Monday! Pilot was prepared to deliver the tv on Thursday but we delayed it until the following Tuesday as we were having our new stand delivered on Monday.Speaking of shipping, I cannot for the life of me understand why some on here feel compelled not to give this tv a true review because they might not have had a perfect shipping experience. These are, after all, \"PRODUCT\" reviews. I was one of the majority of customers who had a perfect shipping experience with Pilot. The only thing that was left off was they could not start up the set because of the extremely low temperature here at the time of delivery. Not worth damaging the set over. Obviously, they could not sit around for an hour or more waiting for the set to warm to a safe temperature. That is just pure professionalism as far as I'm concerned. They were very prompt, courteous, even going so far as to help my husband carry our humongous old set out to his shop because we had no one around to help us with that. We did give them a nice tip which they tried to refuse.If anyone has an issue with their delivery, they should take it up with Amazon, not take stars away from this outstanding product. One other suggestion is to verify with the delivery company when they call exactly what you expect. Just don't wait until afterward and then slam the review. And besides, the shipping is free after all.I will parrot what so many others have said: Buy it.

The reason came down to one simple thing (beyond all the positive reviews). I went and looked at Best Buy, AV Discount, Circuit City etc. and in every case the Picture on the Samsung looked better to me than any of the others. Forget the technical specs, response times, setting options, etc. What it comes down to is what looks best to you, and that was teh Samsung, hands down. Been watching it now with Digital Comcast HD and the picture is fantastic. Regular network programming HD channels are out of this world. I am coming from a regular picture tube TV so the Discovery channel, Survivor, even CSI are unbelievable. It even makes the Warriors look good and the Sharks are off the charts. The Niners are another story. The sound is NOT a problem despite the reports and I was afraid of that. The delivery was great and not tax and no shipping costs were another plus from amazon. I am not even worried that is it now about almost $100 cheaper. it was worth getting it sooner. I went with the cheap HDMI cables from Amazon (about $1.50) and they only carry 60mhz but you can see it vs COAX. I recommend them. I also got monster power cleaner / protection for Surge protection and coax Cable cleaner(only $20 online). The cable guy told me it is a scam and not necessary, all home circuits are already grounded but for $20 I now have $100,000 warranty against damage. He thought I paid the $100+ they sell for in the store said A surge protector is a good idea and with a half dozen power cords you need something anyway.I highly recommend this TV to anyone.My only complaint is the loud signal it puts out when you turn it on and off....

Amazon no longer provides sale price credit so basically what you pay for it when you buy it is it.  They state they have \"changed their policy regarding credits\" and refuse to budge on this which leaves this customer with bad taste for ordering anything else from Amazon as this rule applies to ALL ITEMS they sale.  So, do your homework in price.  This TV has gone from base of 2699. to 2059 to 1840.72 as of today.....quite a difference in price!

Barz \"Master Amazon Shopper\"", "ReviewID": "R3J1K8ID4WVCFY", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I purchased this set from Amazon and received it very quickly.  The shipper - Pilot - sent one person to deliver the tv, first thing in the morning, and did not take away the packaging, which was part of the white glove service offered by Amazon.  That turned out to be a good thing.  Exactly 7 days after receiving the set the problems began, starting with the sound, which would go to zero by itself, constantly.  When viewing a dvd the sound \"slide\" would show on the screen and would \"ping\" constantly.  Gradually I couldn't shut off the set and had to unplug it.  I contacted Samsung, who sent an email to a service shop 45 minutes away and in another state, then contacted Amazon.  AMAZON WAS WONDERFUL!  Samsung was not.  The first service shop never contacted me ... no, correct that, they contacted me 2 weeks later.  After much pestering, Samsung contacted another service shop, now 15 minutes away and in the same state.  They didn't contact me either - ever.  After emailing Amazon each day - and promptly receiving a response - they agreed to replace the set.  I kept watch of the shipping status and, when I found it had arrived at Pilot, I called regarding setting up a delivery.  They advised that they now had a third party delivering the set.  That afternoon they called and set up a delivery time for the next morning.  They arrived on time - and this time there were three delivery men instead of the 1 Pilot sent.  Additionally, since it was the first thing in the morning, and being New England and very cold, the set-up man advised that they couldn't test the set as it was unadvisable to turn it on.  When queried, they advised that since it was under 50 Degrees (it was probably around 25 outside) and the set was obviously cold (you could condensation around the edge of the screen), it was unsafe to turn it on until it had warmed to room temperature.  Smart man!  I believe this is what ultimately fried the circuits on the first set.  We waited until afternoon and turned on the set.  It worked just as the first had - beautifully.  16 Days later there are no problems with the set, except one slighly frustrating problem.  When turned on early in the morning the sound can be intermittent.  I found if you turned the set off, counted to 10 and turned it back on, it was fine.  When turned on later in the day there isn't a problem.  Is it annoying?  Can be, but the overall joy with this set is more than worth it.  Watching blu-ray dvds is totally awesome.  For that matter, watching anything on this set is a joy.  Also, the tv sits about 16 feet from the picture window in our living room, which has morning sun.  While you can see a reflection, we found it not to be a problem at all.  Very surprising - our last set was a very good Sony and the reflection issue created a problem in viewing tv during the day.

The Wii looks great as well even with component connectivity.  THe 120Hz really does what it is intended to do, not just a phony feature to sell the unit.  One thing I will stress is the importance of turning this feature OFF when wathing movies and television shows.  If left on, it's like watching the making of the show through a window rather than giving that cinematic look.  Hard to explain until you see it for yourself.  If watching sports or anything meant to be viewed in a realistic setting, turn the 120Hz ON.  I found the factory settings seem to be the best.  Again, the only setting I feel needs to be changed is the 120Hz, depending on what yu are watching.  I see alot of comments on the reflective screen.

I researched for about a month before deciding on this model.I debated between plasma and LCD.  Even though plasma technology has come a long way recently, I was still worried about the slight risk of image burn-in.  With LCD's, I was worried about lack of deep black levels that plasmas are best at.  I had also looked at plenty of both types in the stores and had the opinion that none of them matched the overall image quality of my CRT based rear projection TV.  Everything I looked at in the stores just seem to amplify any digital noise in the image.  Knowing that stores are probably the worst place to evaluate a set, I decide to trust the many good reviews I've read about this model and ordered it.After it arrived, I set it up next to my rear projection HDTV.  Wow!  What a difference between the two.  The LCD was much brighter and vivid then I had expected.  The other big difference was the LCD was viewable from every spot in the room.  The brightness and color stayed consistent at extreme angles.  The colors didn't shift or reverse like some cheaper LCD's when viewing from the side.I did notice that any noise and compression artifacts in the image were amplified more by the LCD, however, the set was still at it's default factory settings.  I then went into the menu and put all the settings to values I found on a forum that someone with the same model had fully calibrated.  I didn't know how their settings would look on my set but decided to give it a shot.  I was very pleased with the outcome.  Noise wise, the picture now looked a lot smoother and comparable to my old TV.Black levels are absolutely beautiful.  Best I have ever seen on an LCD.  Even in a dark room, the blacks are black.  With a completely black screen the backlight is just slightly noticeable.  In a lit room it's non-existent.  Also, the backlight was completely even.  I saw no light bleeding or hotspots from anywhere with this panel.I love the features and beautiful menus.  The glossy screen posed no problems what so ever.  When the TV is on, the image just seems to burn right though any reflections that were there before.No complaints with the quantity or type of inputs on this set.  My HD satellite DVR through HDMI looked great and my Xbox 360 with a VGA cable was also stunning in full 1080p!  Even SD content was much more tolerable to watch on this TV.Overall, I have no regrets with this purchase and would do it again!

The box was opened once, but the tv was never unpacked.  The only finger prints on it are mine.  The tv is almost too clear... and I underestimated how big it is.  My Old 32\" Sony seems to be half the size.  My eyes are still trying to adjust to such a big, bright perfect picture.  My sitting area is about 7-10 feet away from the TV and I am contemplating sending this one back to get the 46 inch.  Even standard DVDs on a standard DVD player look amazing in 480p resolution.  Star Wars II was so clear, I could tell completely when I was viewing computer animation or actors in front of a blue screen. It almost seems unnatural.  The unit has buckets of great features, even packaging on the unit is genius.  The unit has really cool power saving modes which makes this a good \"green\" tv choice.  The tv settings menu is very fast, user friendly and easy to operate with on screen help guides.  So far I have zero complaints...can't wait to see what this thing can do with a blue-ray player.  Also, a note on HD satellite and cable programming. Not all HD channels are the same.  I have 3 ESPN HD channels, but only the Main ESPN channel has a high HD quality to it.  The other two channels, while they are better than the standard definition channels, they are are not as good as the 480p DVD or the main ESPN channel.  The content provider companies (cox, dish and direct TV) have to squeeze and compress some signals.  Without more band width, there is no way to add more true high definition channels with out compressing signals which results in, in my opinion, non HD content.  However, it still looks good!

It is absolutely the best price performing LCD on the market today (in my humble opinion) in the 52\" class. Even Consumer Reports recognizes this model and I often use CR as a benchmark when making purchasing decisions.I waited well over a year for the technology to mature and for true market competition to bring HDTV's within my price range. After agonizing over the LCD vs. Plasma decision, I was gunning for the Sony 52\" XBR4/XBR5. Needless to say, Amazon offered a terrific deal on this Samsung model plus free shipping. So I made several trips to Best Buy just to compare the various brands. It was pretty easy to walk away feeling that Samsung hit a home run with their ToC line and I did the deal through Amazon. I received the TV through a third-party shipping company (CEVA) in less than a week.

For color and picture clarity, this model is the best.  Sony has richer color but not as crisp as this A650.  I also consider A750 which has USB port as well as menu page to make configuration easier.  But for $200.00 difference, I skip it and choose A650.

It came down to the Sony 52XBR4 and the Samsung LN52A650.  They are both excellent performers, but the 650 has the advantage in picture clarity and the \"through the window\" look. At first, I felt the Touch of Color was gimicky and was actually a deterrent.  After seeing it set up in my home, that slight hint of cherry red makes the set look unique and classy.  My friends have commented on how good this unit looks, just setting there!Delivery was ahead of the estimated time and the service men did an excellent job of placement and of answering my questions.  They were perfunct, but pleasant and thorough.I highly recommend purchasing a Blu-ray player or PS3 and a few BD's to accompany the 650. Every picture looks good on this set, but the Blu-ray connected via HDMI creates an image that looks almost 3D.The TV's settings are highly customizable using the remote.  The control's wheel takes a bit of getting used to as it can be tricky at first to coordinate the press of the remote and the zipping by of the on-screen menu selections.  All in all, this is  a very minor complaint.  Buy this set and you won't be disappointed.A final note about Amazon.  They have one of the best cusotmer service policies in the busines and they back up their word.  When I purchased the LN52A650, Amazon's description including a comment that was easily miscontrued to imply you were getting an additional discount of $200.  Actually, the offer was for $200 off some sports items.  While Amazon, technically did nothing wrong, they later issued me a $100 gift certificate, an apology for any misunderstandings and still enabled me to use the original $200 sports offer if I wished.

The picture is phenomenal, particularly when viewed with a HD signal.CONS:  The remote has a wheel similar to the iPod, but far less responsive.

It supports digital optical in, but obviously not HDMI.  I was psyched to find out this set would output optical.  Multiple HDMI sources come in, one optical audio out to my receiver, right?  Wrong.  Output is limited to 2-channel so 5.1 isn't used.  Not sure why they would even bother giving you that feature if they limit it to 2-channel.  I guess 5.1 is used if using OTA but let's get real.  Who buys a set like this, uses optical out and WOULDN'T pay for HD programming?To be fair, almost any device with hdmi also has optical out.  But having optical out meant fewer cables (and one less dongle hanging off my Xbox 360.)Other than that, it's killer.  Who cares if the remote sucks.  Pay $50 and get a universal.

I am not quite sure how he would have gotten it in the house had I not been physically able to help him, but I was so it is a moot point.  I was a little surprised he did not mention this when he called ahead though. Anyway, he was very helpful and waited patiently while we turned the TV on to make sure it was in working condition.  He offered to take away the packaging, but we opted to keep it just in case we needed to ship it back for any reason.As far as the television itself, I am very, very happy with it.  It is light (as compared to my old tube style TV) and you hardly noticed the red border.(I was concerned about this at first)  I actually like the subtle red accent.  I find the remote easy to use and was very impressed with the quality of the sound that comes from the television even when the surround sound is off.  Now I only use my surround sound to watch movies or special programs which I believe is an energy saver- every little bit counts.I am very particular about my coler viewing; particularly fleshtones and reds.

I work in a service industry where I'm in many different people's homes and businesses on a daily basis.  I had a 30\" HDTV (CRT type) that I bought a few years ago as a necessity when my old 27\" SDTV died on me.  It looked good but I really liked the flat-panel look, especially with all the wires hidden/fished in the walls, which I'd seen in many homes.  The space you'll save without an entertainment center if you wall mount is incredible.I'm really into movies and sports, and I liked what everyone here was saying about the Samsung series 6, so I went over to my favorite big box electronics store to compare and see them in person.  I really was set on the 46\", but I'll tell you the 52\" is the way to go if you can swing it.  It looks so much better at a distance of 12' or greater over the 46\", and I love it.The picture is number one as far as I can tell, compared to anything I've seen in the stores.  So I pulled the trigger, at least I thought so, Amazon approved me for exactly $100 less than the TV cost to get the 0%/36 mo financing offer on their card.  They \"said\" they would ask the bank for $100 more on the limit, but I never heard anything, and you can't put part on the Amazon card and part on a debit card or the like, so I cheated (like someone else here mentioned) and bought myself a gift certificate to make up the balance.  And away we went.CEVA/Eagle Logistics showed up about 2 days before the original delivery date, so I was pumped.  The fellows set it up (initially) on the stand and plugged in my HDMI DVD player to make sure it worked, and were very courteous.I then wall mounted the unit, along with fishing all my HDMI cables in the wall, along with a recessed AC plate installed behind the TV.  (I do low-voltage wiring for a living). It simply looks amazing.  I bought an audio pier for my components below, and it works great, very high-tech looking.The TV is simply stunning.  And you can't go wrong.  Just do it.  Do yourself a favor and schedule your upgrade to HD with your satellite or cable provider as soon as you order, so there won't be a lapse in SD to HD programming.  SD looks OK, but a 52\" makes it look worse than say a 30\" LCD.  I went to a Dish Network VIP 722 Dual Tuner HD DVR.  You'll probably also want an Upconverting DVD player with HDMI or a BluRay player if you watch a lot of movies.Make sure to check in for price drops over the first 30 days, Amazon gave me a $95 refund during this period to make it over $700 cheaper than BestBuy.", "Date": "August 4, 2008"}, {"Title": "A gem to behold", "Author": "Skinner \"Skinner\"", "ReviewID": "R2U58ADSZ6A5AC", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Waited a long time before replacing a SONY 17inch color TV purchased in 1974.

The 750 is priced about $500 more than the 650 for a couple of features that I didn't care for. So to me they were identical TV's.

I agree with everyone that scored this product with 5 stars.Technical Comments:1) Make sure that your receiver can at least handle Dolby surround sound. PCM signal is ok, but does not convert to a rich surround sound. I have an Integra receiver that lets Dolby fly. Unfortunately, it is old enough not to have the DTS HD or other HD audio converters. But for now, I'm very happy with Dolby via optical cable.2) My Cox Cable HD feed is fantastic. Although some HD programming differ in quality, I can accept some shortcomings and \"blurriness\" and \"pixelation\". I can't wait for the Olympics and the NFL season.3) Blu-Ray HD quality is the best I've ever seen.  I watched Underworld:Evolution last night...Wow.

Originally I was going to get a Sony XBR4 or XBR5 because my friend and I were looking at televisions ( at best buy) when we came across this particular model of Sony we both stopped and our jaws dropped!  It had the most amazing picture and so much detail.  It was like looking out a window, it was so clear we could have been at the archaeological dig site they were showing.  I was sold!  Had I had the thousands of dollars required that day I would have went home with that TV.  But I didn't, so I was looking on the internet to try and find cheaper prices, but I accidently stumbled across something that said Samsung had something better and it cost less.  I couldn't imagine something being better and CHEAPER!  So again I start reading reviews and such and found that people were debating which model was better, although all stated Samsung was cheaper.  Finally, I went to consumer reports and found that they stated that the Samsung LN52A650 was the best model they have ever tested.  It rated #1 and Sony XBR5 and then the XBR4 came in a close 2nd and 3rd.  With that and the Samsung being  about $1,000 cheaper  I decided on the Samsung, now where to buy it from. I again looked all over and was pricing various places.  I wanted to buy from a \"brick and mortar\" store so that if there were problems I would feel covered though it would need to be delivered.  I looked all over and Circuit City was the cheapest at $3,200 after shipping, but when I looked at Amazon it was $1,000 cheaper after shipping (which was free)  so I looked further and that was the cheapest price from a reputable internet site.  So, I decided to give it a shot and get the TV from Amazon.  A great TV and one that I would save a thousand dollars on...AMAZING not to mention it was already cheaper than the Sony I was looking at!When I got the TV, what can I say but WOW!  What a beautiful picture.  The touch of red bezel isn't as bad as I had read about, it's just a touch, sure I would have rather had blue or green instead of red, but it doesn't show up that much and in the end it's hardly noticeable because I'm too busy drooling over the picture.  The wheel thing on the remote is a little difficult, but I'm not used to that sort of thing and it's not that bad it just takes a little getting used to.  I am going to hang the TV on the wall, it seems that the base is a little less than stable, but I planned to hang it on the wall anyway.  I am glad I bought this over the Sony!CEVA was alright too!  The people were friendly, and worked hard to get me the TV.  I was a little frustrated because I couldn't take off work so I missed them a time or two, but in all reality I had the TV less than a week after I ordered it.

You can select several \"entertainment\" modes with one click.  \"Sports\" and \"games\" make the picture brighter; \"cinema\" reduces the brightness and the makes the sound fuller.

Similarly, Enhanced Definition content from the DVD looks great too.But, the plain fact of the matter is that most Cable content is 480i and many of my DVDs aren't Enhanced Definition, and it is completely unacceptable to me that 480i programming on this fancy new HD set performs far worse than it did on my 10-year-old 36\" Sony Wega Trinton, which I stupidly gave away to a friend when buying this set.The SD picture problems include: edge outlines around objects on screen, a grainy picture, artifacts in more-distant objects on the screen, and motion artifacts.I tried to resolve the problem with the cable company, and went through 3 cable boxes, 2 HDMI cables, the 3 HDMI ports on the TV, 1 visit from a Tech with the cable company, many tweaks to the cable box settings, 2 calls to Samsung Support, and hours and hours of tweaking the TV picture settings.  Nothing gave me a substantially better picture for SD cable content.So, I decided that I'd had enough, and since my 30-day return period hasn't expired, I'm ditching this set, and plan on buying the top Consumer Reports rated Plasma in hope of a more-satisfactory viewing experience.", "Date": "April 25, 2009"}, {"Title": "great picture, but...", "Author": "Mitchell Gertz", "ReviewID": "R3A4FD875KXP1L", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I carefully researched TVs and finally decided on  Samsung. I ordered it on 2/28/09 and it arrived exactly on time on 3/6/09. Amazon's ordering process was very easy. It was delivered by CEVA Logistics. They did a great job bringing it in, unpacking it, and making sure it was undamaged and worked. The set up was very easy using an HDMI cable. The menus are easy to navigate and the picture was eye-popping on HD channels.Unfortunately, as a few others have mentioned, this TV gives off interference of some kind that interferes with the infra-red signal on the cable box remote; so much so that it's not useable  (Samsung's remote works fine, but you really don't use it much with a cable hook up). I called Samsung's 800 number. They were very helpful, but couldn't provide a fix. They then set up a time to have one of their service techs come out and try to help. They came out, tried, but currently, there is no solution for this problem. My cable company is RCN and I'm in the Boston, MA area. Samsung said they are working on a solution, though.I also noticed a couple of other \"cons\". Occasionally, there is a static flash when you change channels, instead of the usual momentary black screen. Also, this TV has a pic-in pic function, but the other picture (the sub-picture) has to be from an analog signal, so this function is pretty much useless, unless you're hooked up to an antenna also. In other words, this TV has only one built in tuner, which doesn't allow both pictures (main and sub-picture) to come from the same source. One must be from an external antenna and the other can be from an HDMI, Component, or PC input. And if you use closed captioning, it is very clumsy to turn on if your TV is hooked up using an HDMI cable because this setup bypasses the TV's tuner where cc is decoded. To use it, you have to shut the cable box off, while leaving the TV on, open the cable box menu, enable cc, then turn the cable box back on again. This is probably true for any TV set up with an HDMI cable.Also, under certain conditions, glare can be a bit noticeable, say, when you are watching during the day, in a light room,  and the picture is a night seen. Even at maximum brightness, the glare wins out during a dark seen.So, because of all this, I am returning this TV. Probably going to look at a Sony Bravia. I'm very disappointed. I think Samsung's quality control needs some quality control.

They have a special device that attaches to the front of the TV and that device relays information to the laptop its connected to, which then tells the technician what to adjust to make the picture as good as possible. A few tweaks and it was done and the colors were much more vibrant.3 years later and this TV is still going strong. Samsung makes great displays at competitive prices and I couldn't be happier, nor do I have any envy for those with 240Hz 3D LED TVs. This suits everyone in the house just fine.

Onofrio", "ReviewID": "R1L855LK7OHNLL", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "Although the LN2A650 is discontinued, there are newer generations of Samsung TV's that still get pretty good ratings.  I have no reason to believe that their design and/or build quality is worth your time, money, and piece of mind.  Don't be fooled like I was...I have not owned any other Samsung products and was reluctant to purchase a Samsung TV to begin with, but it came highly rated from reputable consumer and electronics evaluators (i.e. CR, CNET, etc) for picture quality, adjustability, and the like.  On October 21, 2008, I was excited to finally be getting rid of my 10 year old 32\" tube and decided to go for the then-well regarded LN52A650.  I enjoyed it thoroughly with my 7.1 surround sound system, HD cable channels, PS3 games, and Blu-ray discs.  Then on May 27, 2010, it began rapidly cycling on/off for no apparent reason.A little online research reveals that this has not been an isolated problem.  After the TV began cycling on/off, I tried various fixes as directed by Samsung (all to no avail): upgraded the firmware, unplugged it for 30 seconds, removed it from the surge protector and plugged directly into wall outlet, etc.  They offered to cover the cost of the replacement of the capacitor, but would not cover anything else. (As a side note, the capacitor was not an issue with my TV in particular, but had been an issue with other Samsung TV's.)Samsung tech support, customer service, and repair people were all very friendly, but that does not make up for the fact that the TV was out of warranty and they weren't inclined to do anything about it.  The earliest appointment was two weeks out and the window was an utterly inconvenient seven hours.  I took a day off from work, paid $95 for the repair guy to spend no more than 15 minutes with the TV, before I was informed that it needed the LCD panel replaced because of the backlight overloading.  The panel with labor would cost nearly a grand and it would take at least a week for the part to ship from California.  He emphasized that this LCD replacement panel is \"popular\" and might be on back order.  Even if I were to do the repair there is no guarantee that I wouldn't have the same problem again.It is sad that the reliability with these TV's has been so bad.  The repair guy acknowledged that they do give him a fair amount of job security.  He also noted that most people choose to buy a new TV rather than have it fixed.  It is even more disappointing that Samsung doesn't stand behind their products more -- there is clearly an issue with many of their TV's (almost seems like they're following the old Toyota play book).I guess if I had less faith in Samsung from the start, I'd have gotten an extended warranty.  I just thought they had better credibility after having done all of my research before the big purchase.  Now all I'm left with is a $2,000 paperweight and the solace of knowing that as the \"go-to guy\" for all things electronics with my family and friends that I can effectively prevent a few others from purchasing Samsung products in the future.", "Date": "June 9, 2010"}, {"Title": "Might not be good for gamers...", "Author": "M.

My kill:death ratio was well over 1 and after switching the television I noticed a huge difference. It always seemed like I was a step behind everyone else in the game and my kill:death ratio quickly dropped below 1. I eventually went back to my old TV and things are back to normal again. I tested the lag using Rockband 2 on the Samsung TV and the first results were in the neighborhood of 70ms.

The Touch of Color is subtle, but it adds a touch of class to the room. At 56\", this TV is dominating. Make no mistake, this will be the center of attention in any room you put it in. When friends come over, their immediate reaction is usually a curse word because of the sheer massiveness of the TV.The LN52A650 is the second Samsung in my house (after the 46\" in the living room) and my third LCD TV purchase overall. I heartily recommend the Samsung brand of TVs over other manufacturers for the price to performance ratio and for a number of design innovations. Both my Samsungs have a swivel base which is very helpful when accessing the back panel to plug in other devices. I am surprised by just how many other brands do not have this simple design (including Sony Bravia's, Panasonic, Olevia, ViewSonic).Pros:----- attractive and BIG! It's beautiful every time I look at it.- elegance of contours and simplicity of design: TV is completely buttonless. Instead, front right side has touch sensitive controls that detect human contact, like the PS3 power button. Touching it with a pen, or other object won't activate it.- large number of ports and plugs, so you'll very likely have more than you need for all your devices. 4 HDMI ports- Ethernet port for weather updates, stock ticker, and news headlines that overlay on the screen, though I don't use this at all, since I have PCs and Macs.- nicely designed remote that is sturdy, shiny, and big buttons. Not nearly as confusing as other remotes. At 10 inches tall, the buttons are given plenty of breathing room, instead of being all squished up on a smaller surface. Has a motion sensor inside, so the buttons light up when moved -- really helpful in a dark room.- remote battery cover is tethered, so you can't lose it! A small detail, but a very smart design innovation that speaks to the level of care Samsung devoted to this product.- swivel base allows easy access to ports, a design many TVs lackCons----- AutoMotion Plus not very useful and is really just a marketing gimmick. It makes everything look artificial, though when turned on for some games, they do look better. Don't use for movies, unless you want to wash away that look of film and all the care directors put into making a film look the way it looks.- onscreen menus could've been made simpler. For example, turning on and off the AutoMotion requires at least 3 menus because it is buried.Not many cons I can think of.

I couldn't be happier with the Samsung. Must be the 120hz and automotion??Pro's: Crystal clear pictures when watching blue ray movies (i use hdmi cables). Makes you feel like your shooting it or almost like your watching it being filmed. Some people might not like it but I love it. Its all in the motion.Con's: Color is not as good as the plasma, but its very good.Overall: I think the picture is better on the plasma when watching sports on cable tv. Little more clear.

(but not a major issue.- Screen is more reflective than most LCDSs I have seen but not as much as Plasma or CRT Tvs. The brightness of the picture does overcome this in my situation but I would check it out if you are using it in a very bright room.If I had to do it all over again I would definitely buy this TV.I bought it from Amazon and the price was much less than what I could find locally.

Once the TV is on the wall mount, it's really hard to connect cables without un-mounting it.Once you get this TV, you HAVE to get a blu-ray player. The sony blu-ray player you get at costco is pretty good. It's Anynet compatible. Anynet is some sort of a media device protocol that lets your DVD player talk to your TV. When I pop a DVD into my blu-ray player, it switches on the TV if it isn't on already and changes the TV to the right input source.WARNING: To people who're planning on mounting this TV: You'll need to remove the base before you can mount it. This is easier said than done. The screws are really deep and tight. Make sure you get a really long screwdriver for maximum torque. It took me 3 trips to home depot/target to find the right screw driver. This may seem like nitpicking but you can't imagine the frustration of having a wall mount all set up and then being unable to get the darn base out.", "Date": "March 8, 2009"}, {"Title": "Beautiful Design Amazing Picture", "Author": "Hector A.

Blacks that are absolutley black and colors that are eye popping. Plasma may end up going the way of VHS.One last note. Notwithstanding the brilliance of the images, I'm beginning to suspect that we may hear or read some visual equivalent of the complaints we often hear about CD's sounding \"metallic\" or \"artificial.\" In some respects, the images are almost TOO good, if one can imagine such a thing. This may particularly be the case with '40's films in black and white. An exmample: watching a standard DVD of \"An American in Paris\" with Gene Kelley, using a Sony BlueRay player with acknowledged fabulous upscaling capability. At times, certain scenes from this DVD--from 1953, I believe--looked amazingly as if it were videotape! I happened to enjoy the effect, but I can imagine that some purists might find this offputting.

Sound quality is excellent and I have not experienced any glare problems when the lighting is bright in the room.  Comcast standard definition cable picture is acceptable for the majority of channels (but your spoiled once you see HD) and I have noticed that certain SD commercials and some SD broadcasts display a jittery white line at the top of the picture. Since this never occurs with HD broadcasts I would attribute it to older standard definition programming. The TV was delivered in a week after I ordered, but the so-called \"white glove\" treatment was somewhat of a joke. Don't get me wrong, the delivery person was courteous and respectful, but only 1 guy showed up with an inadequate hand truck, and I ended up helping him pack the TV from my driveway up the stairs to the 2nd floor family room. Had I not specifically requested his help in unpacking the TV, he would have bolted as soon as we got the box to the room.

Until I purchased this screen it was simply an extra living room with good sound.  With this one simple purchase I was able to transform my home theater experience from simply watching a movie on a TV in a living room to something more akin to a state-of-art movie theater.  Please be aware that the LN52A650, although it has speakers, obviously was not designed for superior sound.  You should match this screen with a dedicated home theater audio system to get any sort of movie house experience.I put the television through the ringer as far as video playback.  I played several Blu-Ray movies through my PS3 and the image quality was spectacular.  When I turned the Motion Plus on High for the Nightmare Before Christmas the transformation was unbelievable.  I feel I lack the words to describe the difference it made, but it made me feel as though I were walking inside the miniature stop motion universe.  If you have this screen try watching the Nightmare Before Christmas on Blu-Ray with the different Motion Plus settings and you will understand what the 120 Hz does for you.The HD-DVD playback over component video (1080i) out of my Xbox 360 looked as flawless as the Blu-Ray version of the movie over HDMI (1080p).  Standard unconverted DVDs played well on the screen, and looked better than they ever did before, but you can still tell it was not a HD formatted material.The color reproduction on the HD content is on par with the best HD CRT monitors.  The blacks truly do come through as true blacks without grey tones.  I was able to set the screen only 7 feet away from the viewing location without any visible pixels, so the resolution is very good.The digital tuner works well.  I was able to receive all the local channels in crystal clear digital and in many cases high def.  The picture quality of the HD content over the air is quite good.  I am very tempted to cancel my Dish Network subscription because of the quality of the local programming.

The only noticable difference from being on-center is just the increased distance to the far side of the TV - lol.For those planning to use this as a computer monitor, I measured that a 12 point font at full 1080p resolution at normal (96) dpi is 3/4 of an inch tall - easily readable from 10-12' away (perhaps more.) Also, for those using this as a computer monitor, it should be noted that the output should be set to use YCbCr, rather than RGB. With an NVidia card, this can be done under NVidia Control Panel -> Video & Television -> Select Digital Color Format. I'm assuming that this can be changed easily on an ATI card as well from Catalyst Control Center, but I don't have one sitting in front of me to test it with. This thing has been great for all kinds of computer use. I'm a software engineer, so I'm regularly editing software code from 8-10' away with even as low as 8pt fonts. Programming from the recliner with my wireless keyboard and mouse is very nice. :) The response might still be a little slow for the ridiculously good FPS players out there (I'm not one, so I'm not really sure,) but I've been able to play FPS games on it as well as I can on a regular computer monitor.Also, for the geekish out there, this TV (along with other recent Samsung models) runs Linux and busybox. I want to say that it's uCLinux/ARM arch, but I don't remember for sure. The tools to hack the firmware to your liking are out there. The easiest way is probably to unpack a firmware update image on your computer, alter it, then run the firmware updates. However, it has been discovered that there is a passwordless root shell running on a serial device, but you'd probably have to crack this thing open to get at that UART port (if it even has headers,) so the former option is probably your best bet. Of course, if you can install sshd on an image, then flash this thing, you would be able to just control it over the network, since it already has an ethernet connection in place. Of course, I'm guessing that doing any of this stuff would void the warranty...Overall rating: If this set is in your price range, buy it (or one of its newer Samsung cousins.)", "Date": "February 26, 2009"}, {"Title": "love the tv but should have gone with a850", "Author": "N.

I was actually debating between the 550 and 650 series, due to the savings ($400 cheaper for the 550), but really did want the 120Hz LCD.  The features available on the more expensive 750 and 850 did not really appeal to me either, as many others have also mentioned.  So I finally settled on the 650.The Delivery Process: I ordered the TV on a Wednesday, and upon checkout, was asked to choose a timeframe of when the TV would be delivered.  I selected the following Friday between 8am-12pm.  Very easy, simple, and a nice new addition to Amazon's white-glove delivery service, as I had previously purchased a TV two years earlier, and this had not been offered at the time.  The delivery service called once they had received the TV the following Wednesday, and gave me an even more accurate time of 12PM for that Friday.  They did arrive one hour late, but called to alert me of the delay.  They carried the TV to the second floor (for my Mom, as I do not live with my parents), unpacked, set it on the TV stand, and then carried the TV box back down to the garage in case we needed to return the product.  Excellent, excellent service, that saved my parents the back breaking ordeal of carrying the TV upstairs.BEAUTIFUL TV! When I went to help set up the TV to the cable system, the TV absolutely blew me away.  We have an older 46\" Samsung LNT4665F, and it makes this TV look ancient.  The screen is noticeably smoother, and has a much more rich feel to it.  One of the biggest convenience factors is the MUCH quicker channel switching.  The 550s has a slight delay when changing the channel, and is a bit annoying to sift through.  If you are looking to get into Samsung's 120Hz LCD series, the 650 is a great great purchase.  And you cannot beat Amazon's price or service.", "Date": "February 24, 2009"}, {"Title": "Samsung, 52\" LCD TV", "Author": "Jack R.

Six", "ReviewID": "R35SW4Q2AJS7MT", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I owned a Samsung 61\" DLP (2nd generation) that I had purchased from a membership store. In 3 years I had to replace the bulb twice, the mirror engine once and finally it needed a part that was no longer offered by Samsung. Luckily I had purchased the extended warranty; the store gave me a cash refund of the purchase price (and the warranty). I used the refund $$ to purchase the Samsung 52\", 120Hz LCD (touch of color).First - I love the picture quality of this TV. I didn't think a picture could be any better than the DLP TV I owned; I was wrong. Our family watched 'I Am Legend' on BluRay. It looked so good that it seemed strange... it really looks so good it almost seems to be 3D.Second - the major drawback (and reason I originally didn't buy an LCD) is refresh rate. My son and I play Xbox 360 FPS type games together; these are high action games with a lot of fast-moving graphics (explosions etc). The 120hz version seems to have resolved this latency issue. That, coupled with the fact the prices have come down dramatically on the larger LCD screens makes it the time to buy LCD on larger screens (50\" or larger).Third - this was my first large purchase on Amazon.com. I've made hundreds of book/electronics purchased on Amazon.com but never bought a big-ticket item. It was shipped directly to my door; the shipping was included and had no sales tax. I recently visited Circuit City's store (going out of business sale). They claimed a 30% savings on a 50\" Samsung LCD TV; the price was more than I paid on Amazon for a 52\" Samsung LCD (120hz).", "Date": "February 24, 2009"}, {"Title": "Good experience", "Author": "Wilassasin \"Wilassasin\"", "ReviewID": "R2NQIM8BBS40T0", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Fast delivery, Box was delivered undamaged.

First night hooked up a PS3 and watched a couple of blu ray movies, Wall-e and Transformers and both were amazing.  Color, depth, crisp picture.  Everything was how i wanted it.  Played Rainbow Six Vegas on the PS3 and again, great picture.  During the loading scenes when the screen is black i did notice some of the \"clouding\" issue that others have mentioned but it in NO WAY cause concern.  As soon as the game was loaded, didn't notice it at all even in dark scenes.  For some reason, either it didn't happen or i just can't see it during the movies.  The remote is easy to use and navigation works well.  I play everything through a surround sound system for movies and games but for standard low level listening, the speakers work fine.

After showing them the location in our house, they advised me that sometimes the boxes are dirty on the bottom, and that I might want to put something down to keep the floor clean (a nice touch).  They had it out of the box and on top of our new home theatre furniture in no time.  They even took extra care in making sure no damage was done to the furniture (another nice touch). WE thoroughly checked for shipping damage, and thankfully none occurred.  They then plugged it in and made sure it powered up, and that the remote worked.  They also offered to take all the packing material and box with them, or if I wanted to keep the box, they would gladly take it to the garage or basement.

Finally chose the Samsung LCD over the Plasma for several reasons. The plasma seemed to have to many restrictions compared to the LCD i.e. weight, picture quality and finally handling. What I mean by handling is that everywhere I researched the review always mentioned keeping the plasma upright at all times to keep from damaging the screen. In the final analysis the LCD seemed to be more rugged.Comparing the two at a local store I actually preferred the LCD over the Plasma. Brightness was the big factor. Both pictures are fantastic but I give the edge to LCD.I have Dish TV, Apple TV and a Onkyo 606 all connected via HDMI. They all work fine. The CEC HDMI communication on some of the features do not work properly but I put this down as the CEC standards set by the different manufactures, each have their own quirks.Watched the Titans game the other day and that was great in HD. The 120 MHz motion program worked great and I have it set at medium.The complaints on glare I have read about have not affected me. I am in a great rooms with lots of light. The only glare I notice is the reflection on the black bezel around the screen. Setting the picture viewing to Dynamic I feel cuts back on a lot of glare.The menu setup list is great. When you select the menu item there is a brief exclamation what that feature does listed at the bottom of the screen...nice touch.Had the TV for 5 days and no problems.

I have one comment regarding the Amazon.com stats for the TV... if you look at the connectivity features under the \"learn more\" heading, you're likely to find that the TV supposedly has two RF antenna inputs (ostensibly one for a coaxial cable TV connection and another for over-the-air antenna). This is incorrect. The TV has one RF input. So, if you're planning to use a coaxial cable connection (not HDMI or component) AND an over-the-air antenna, you'll need to scrounge up or purchase an RF splitter switch (aka an A/B switch) for your cable TV and antenna. If you're going to pay for HD cable or satellite, I suppose you're probably going to use one of the HDMI or component inputs for the Set Top Box.

I would like to note that the family research has been confirmed by the recent Consumer Reports' ratings on LCD HI-Def TVs that placed this set at the top of the 52-inch LCDs and the Samsung 46-inch and 40-inch at the top of their peers as well. CRs evaluations were hands-on for the different sets tested and if you are looking to get your first LCD Hi-Def television, I would suggest that you spend about $4.00 and buy the Consumer Reports Dec.

The blacks and color trueness and separation are outstanding.And of course this quality is present in watching regular TV programming, whether HD or standard. I've seen some criticism of the handling of SD, but I see no problem with it. It is certainly no worse than other TVs on that. It's just a matter of going into SD shows with reasonable expectations. SD is simply rather weak and the weakness is exaggerated on big-screen TVs. SD on this TV is fine and HD is phneonmenal. (My cable provider is Verizon FIOS.)The colors were set nearly perfectly, right out of the box. The contrast was set to 90%, so I reduced that to about 60 and made some other slight adjustments, but it is hugely impressive right out of the box and easy to set up.I can't speak to the sound, since I use a home theater system, and I rarely use the remote, since I am using a universal remote, but from what I have used of it, it seems fine.Some of the settings are buried deeper in the menus than I would like. There is a PIP function, but no button on the remote to access it. (The PIP allows you to view a channel in the TV input mode together with something from another input, but not 2 channels in the TV input mode, since there is only one tuner). To access it you have to scroll deep into the menu.Overall, I am hugely impressed with this TV. It is replacing a 3-year-old Samsung 50-inch DLP.

The entire conversation with their service rep took less than 5 minutes.The delivery service was also great.  My TV was shipped first to Pilot, who then handed it off to Meyer as Pilot does not deliver TVs larger than 52 inches.  The people at Pilot and Meyer were very helpful and I was able to pick a window when I would be home with ease.  The two guys at Meyer brought the TV in, took it out of the box, and placed it on the stand.  As it was cold out they recommended I wait for the set to come to room temperature before turning it on, so I did not test it.  As a result of that I held on to the packaging, which they would have taken away if I'd asked.

Glare is not a problem for us, fine we may have to turn off a light or close a blind.

Two guys showed up in the deliver truck,  I asked if they could removed my old 46 inch very heavy TV off the stand. They said they would, I was worried because  it is so heavy I do on know if I can lift it.  They unplugged and disconnected the cables and  moved it across the room for me.  Then they Removed my  new 650 from the box and placed it on the stand, could see no damage to  the box or the TV,  they plugged in the TV,  placed batteries in the remote and showed me it was working.  I signed the papers and they left.  Not many stores would have come  out to my place and done the extras. Since I live 16 miles from the closest town, I had figured on a Freight Truck delivery and they would not do more than kick the box out of the truck, but Pilot came in a van and made it a pleasant experience, they made sure the TV was not damaged.I hooked up everything else myself and it works great.

I have been looking at this LN52A650 for quite some time, comparing it to other manufacturers and models, and checking prices.  The 50,000:1 contrast ratio, 120HZ, and 4ms response put it at the top of my list.  When I finally bought it, I couldn't wait for it to arrive!On the scheduled delivery day, I was told to expect delivery between 11am and 3pm, with a call 30 minutes prior to arrival.  That call came at 10am - earlier than I expected, but fine with me!  At 10:30, they arrived.  The delivery men brought it into my living room, unpacked it, put it on the stand, plugged it in, opened the remote, put the batteries in, and handed it to me.  After verifying that the TV works, I signed their paperwork and they were on their way - about 10 - 15 minutes, and back to work for me.When I got home that night, I couldn't wait to finish the installation.  I have a wall mount for this, and all I had to do was take the old one down and put the new one up.  Well the old TV is pretty light (about 50 pounds), so it came down easily.  Well this new one is much bigger and heavier!  It took about 6 tries before I got it hung on the wall mount, and I was pretty tired afterwards.  It was recommended that I have help doing this, but I didn't think I needed it.  Looking back, I now recommend a second person.  The last thin you would want to do is drop your new $2000 TV while installing it.Once installed and connected, I turned on my new TV!!  The last channel I was watching was Spike HD, so that's the first thing that came on.  Star Wars III was playing when my new TV booted up, and let me tell you, the picture and sound were simply AMAZING!!  It looks 100 times better than my other TV.  I'm not sure if it's the 720 vs 1080 or the size difference (or both), but I couldn't be happier with it.  Every channel, whether HD or not, looks incredible.The controls are pretty straight-forward.  I didn't need to read through the manual to figure out the basics, although the manual is well-written.  I also have a Samsung blu-ray player, and it still auto-detects it even though it is plugged into my Sony receiver.  I have the TV hard-wired to my internet router, and it easily set itself up.So far, after 2 weeks, I can't find anything negative to say about the LN52A650.  I looked at the A750 also, but the only difference between them was the additional storage capacity, which I don't need.  Also, the A750 does not included picture-in-picture, and while I don't use that feature much, I want to have the option.If you're thinking about buying this TV, I highly recommend it.

Also, I did not have any of the issues with the TV turning on and off, on it's own. I guess my TV's software was updated in the factory/production.If you've been considering buying this particular model, it would be an excellent purchase. It's well worth the money and the price continues to drop. I give it my highest recommendation. There IS a reason that Consumer Reports gave this very model it's highest overall rating (LCD HDTV's over 50 inches).", "Date": "November 16, 2008"}, {"Title": "Annie,  AZ", "Author": "Ann L. \"Ann Langford\"", "ReviewID": "R2L6ZVBIFS8UW7", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Best Lcd TV, after much research, I narrowed my options to 3 Panasonic, Sony, Samsung.

What a deal to get HD movie quality! The picture quality is wonderful, clear, accurate color, etc. It is even spectacular after adjusting the settings recommended by CNET. For the price, I believe that the Samsung LN52A650 is a much better buy than the Sony's. I could see that the glossy screen might be a problem for others in bright settings. However, this is not a problem for me as the TV is in part of my basement that is away from windows. The CEVA delivery went very smoothly without any problem. I got a call from them as soon as the TV was at the delivery center. They delivered the TV in the time slot they said they would come. There were two guys, not just one guy as in some of the reviews mentioned here. They unpacked the TV and brought it to where I wanted to put in the basement.

Before the visit, I was going to buy the Samsung 61\" DLP because I wanted the biggest TV I could afford. But after comparing all the TVs, the picture on the Samsung 52\" LCD was far and away the best. It was simply stunning. I went home and ordered it on Amazon. The total price, including no shipping or tax, was about $400 less than Circuit City..I must admit that I was a little leery about ordering such a item online, but it turned out to be a wise decision. When I received the TV, everything was fine except that there were some smudges and scratches on the bezel. I called Amazon Customer Care and they simply ordered a replacement. It came 5 days later, and it was perfect. Make sure you keep your packing box for at least a week in case you need to return it. Bravo Amazon!The bezel was important because it's simply gorgeous. The infused red color was a brilliant idea (there must be a woman at Samsung with come clout). And the picture on this TV is jaw-dropping. Everyone who has seen it has been blown away. You need to sit at eye-level to really appreciate it. ESPN never looked so good!I bought 2 HDMI cables from Mediabridge (on Amazon)to hook up my cable box and my future Blu-ray player. I also hooked up my Panasonic DVD recorder. Even my older DVDs look good. You can adjust the picture size to full screen by going into the picture mode, scroll down to picture options, size, and select wide fit. Wow! It's like I'm standing next to my hero Sherlock Holmes (Basil Rathbone of course)! I'm a movie freak, and there's nothing better than being totally immersed in your favorite films. (Make sure you go back to 16:9 size when you go to HD channels).If you have a lot of DVDs, you might want to check out discgear holders to keep them organized and each DVD pops up when you select it. They are so cool (QVC had the best price on them).I bought the 650 model because I wanted the swivel stand. I can now watch TV while I'm at my computer desk in another part of the room. I have an entertainment center with 2 huge black display towers and 2 upper connecting shelves. There is also a stand at the bottom with shelves and glass doors. I was able to move the towers apart so that the TV would fit on the stand and below the upper shelves. I put the cable box and recorder below in the stand and everything worked out perfectly.If you are considering a new HDTV and don't want to break the bank, you must see this one.

The glossy bezel with a touch-of-red is attractive, but also distracting - it reflects too much light; and who wants red on their TV anyway.  I would have prefered a no-gloss black bezelSome other reviewers complained about the sound and the remote control.  Both are fine to me.  I have a 5.1 sound system when better sound is required.I looked at both the new plasma Panasonic 50\" 800U and the Pioneer Kuro 5020.

The \"White Glove\" trucking company movers (2) were professional and located the TV where I requested, recommended I keep the box for 2 weeks (incase I had to return the TV) and noted that if any problem developed requiring return of the unit I should make all arrangements via Amazon.The TV has performed flawlesley from the initial \"plug in\".  My only concerns at this point are the poor quality sound and the picture distortion for some broadcasts.I'm told the sound problem is typical for the small speakers in the TV case and can be corrected by buying a Home Theater set up for an additional $300/$900.The picture distortion is not present for all broadcasts and seems to be  due to the type of input signal from my satalite receiver.  I receive input from a \"DISH\" satalite receiver.  The picture changes height and does not fill the screen for different kinds of signal input.  The signal is completely lost for some stations everytime a cloud goes by to the South of my dish receiver.  The (non HDMI broadcasts) picture seems to be streched to the sides causing the people to appear fat(er).  I can correct the height - fill the screen, using the remote control (P.SIZE) but this is annoying.  Samsung recommends using the 16:9 wide mode but also has a Zoom1, Zoom2 and 4:3 setting none of which are satisfactory for normal viewing.  A \"Wide Fit\" and \"Just Scan\" for viewing with no cut off for HDMI and DTV signals is noted in the Owners Manual but not functional on the Picture Options Menu.

One area that needs improvement however is the annoying time delay switching from channel to channel as a black screen stays in place far too long before the next channel appears. I have accepted the delay as part of the price paid in order to present the best quality picture possible.

The colors are striking and beautiful, the blacks are really deep. My friend has a Pioneer plasma and I was pleasantly surprized to find that this TV outperforms the plasma in some while matching the plasma in all other respects.The speakers are really bad, so you should invest in a home theatre system when you buy this. The remote is OK, but could have been made more attractive - I hate the clumsy jog dial. But the TVs performance more than makes for all these minor shortcomings.The red color on the bezel is lovely - all my friends liked it too :). One minor issue is that the bezel reflects a lot of light - but trust me, once you start watching the TV, you generally will be so enthralled that  you won't notice the bezel's reflection. Truly a masterpiece. Touchwood.The TV does take 3-4 seconds to start - not a big problem. The menu is pretty good.Overall, I rated it as a 5 star because of its superb picture quality.Update: Nov 2009================I've had this TV for 1 year now. No problems to report. The picture quality is beautiful as usual. I had a friend who had bought a SONY 52\" Bravia, 120hz LCD 18 months ago. He regrets his decision after seeing the quality of my TV. Two other friends of mine have a Panasonic plasma 720p which they bought in 2005 and 2007 respectively. These TVs do not even come close to the picture quality of this masterpiece. The only TV that I have seen perform better than this (and that too marginally) is a Pioneer Kuro that one of my friends has.Update Feb 2010: TV shut off automatically and won't turn on now. Will go to service center which is 20 miles from where I live. I dropped the rating to 4 stars because of this.Update March 2010: I do notice some issues with the black level. Picture appears washed out on many channels. Also the TV's optical out sends out only stereo sound, so you cannot connect a HDMI cable from the source to this TV and expect 5.1 surround sound.

I agree and I also used the recommended settings found online at tweaktv.com.  I use it with Vista Media Center and it works very nicely.  I use the screen zoom feature found in VMC to accommodate the various aspect ratios found in broadcast and movie sources and leave the TV set to 16:9.  Make sure to adjust the resolution and any overscan settings (e.g. using the video card settings) so that you get the full benefit of the size and resolution (Nvidia does a great job of providing the proper software for this).  The only big issue I have come across is the excessive interference with the VMC IR receiver.  This TV will flood the room with IR noise when certain settings are being used (I am pretty sure its the energy saver settings).  This IR noise makes the VMC remote virtually useless.  I found some posts regarding these settings and corrected the issue.  Now, I am happily viewing with full control of my systems.  It is an impressive TV and I am happy with it so far.  As for size and weight, I can see how even at 52\", I will eventually be interested in something larger but will likely go to a projector system.  I think this unit weighs perhaps a few lbs less than my 27\" Sony Trinitron (and it is sooo much better)!  I have been viewing analog signals on it at SDTV resolutions...this leaves something to be desired.  Switching to a digital signal and hopefully higher resolutions (for normal broadcast/cable programming) will greatly improve the quality of the image.BTW, the 120Hz settings make a movie look like it was shot on video (very sharp image with little inertial smoothing).

In the end, we opted for the 650 as the best compromise of picture quality and price.  We have not been disappointed in any way (we now have two 52\" Samsungs, and one 46\" A650 as well).  The picture quality is flawless with our DirecTV satellite feed (running at 1080i), the set-up and software are excellent, and I am looking forward to connecting it to our home network to take advantage of its connectivity features, and to a BlueRay DVD player as well.  Stepping up from a 14-year old Sony XBR 53\" rear-projection TV, the improvement in image quality is nothing short of stunning.For what it's worth, the \"Touch of Color\" red bezel is very subtle in our installation, barely noticeable at all and certainly not as eye-grabbing as I feared.Other reviewers have noted that Amazon's \"White Glove\" delivery service is everything promised, and we would have to agree... our TVs were delivered very quickly and with no fuss to our new home (which was still under construction when the units arrived).

Rupert Jr.", "ReviewID": "RAVI0Y9ZED6C2", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I spent about 6 weeks looking at TV's and researching them while saving money to purchase one. This would be my 3rd HDTV so I wanted to make sure it was the best. This is the only TV I could find that had a tremendous amount of people who were just absolutely happy about it on many different forums. Consumer Reports also rated it #1 and CNET.com still lists it as an Editors Choice pick with an \"excellent\" rating.After purchasing the TV, I was shocked at how much better it performed than my previous Toshiba HDTV. I still have that tv but it's now in my bedroom. In summation, I'm just SO happy with this purchase. When watching HDTV and especially Blu-Ray on my PS3, this TV looks so realistic that it appears as if you're looking out a window and watching it live. Also of importance is that my best friend has the LN52A550 and he and I both agree that this TV looks much more realistic looking, almost freakishly realistic. The difference between his TV and this one is mainly the 120hz Auto Motion Plus. I have become a very big fan of the 120hz Auto Motion Plus and very much like that Samsung was thoughtful enough to let the user adust it to \"Off, Low, Medium or High\" to ensure that it can be tuned to the user's preferences.In fact, the only real problem I could find with this TV was that when I played my PS3, XBOX 360 and Wii on it, the timing appeared to be off. It appeared as though there was a signifigant video delay or lag between what was really happening and what appeared on the TV. Below is the solution for this:SOLUTION: I have a LN52A650 and have also noticed that when I play my PS3 and XBOX 360 on this new TV, that there is a signifigant delay as compared to my other two HDTV's. In particular, while playing golf,baseball, Guitar Hero and Rock Band on PS3, I noticed that I have to hit the button much sooner than in the past in order to perfect my 'timing' on these games. As you know, when you have to change your timing, it changes the playability and can even ruin some games. There is deffienetly a delay. I've had this TV for a month now and until last night, was unable to figure out the problem.Here is the solution: Hit the menu button on the remote control to bring up the TV's general menu. Next, scroll down to 'Setup' and hit enter. Then scroll down to 'Entertainment' and hit enter. Finally, you'll see a sub-menu come up that says \"Off, Sports, Cinema, Game.\" Select 'Game' from this menu and the caption will tell you that this option will now provide \"The optimal picture and sound quality for games. This mode accelerates the playing speed when using an external game console connected to the TV.\"After selecting this \"Game\" mode, it completely changed everything. The games are playing better than ever and the timing on games like Rock Band 2, Golf and Baseball are now right on!My problem, like so many others, is that I was looking for this 'game' mode or something similar to it in the \"Picture Options\" menu because there was a video delay problem. I hope this post helps others who have Samsung TV's because they really are the best.I am so, so happy with this TV and am extremely glad I brokedown and finally paid to get it. This TV is FREAKISHLY realistic looking and now that I've discovered this 'game' mode, It really does seem to be perfect.

I will just help with some questions/concerns I have read and been able to look for now.  The Touch of color is not noticable at all.  It isa dark TV, with a dark red, that you really have to stare at the edges to see.  I am about 10 feet from the screen now (until I move furniture back in the room), and I dont even notice the border around the screen, which is really beatiful.  I love the clear border around the perimeter, and I have watched this is bright, medium, and no light, and I have not seen any halo effect at all.Lastly, have a friend help you with it.  It is heavy enough, and awkward enough in the box to not try it on your own.  I had to get it up a flight of stairs, and was too excited to wait for my landlord to get home, so I moved it my self.  When I managed to get about 1' of the boxes corner up on to the landing, and was trying to pull, from the front of the box, the box up onto the landing (with the other 3-4' hanging in mid air above the steps, I thought I was going to lose the box and watch it bounce down the stairs and slam into the wall at the bottom.  I luckily got a secure enough hold on it (thanks to the unbreakable plastic straps that secure the box) and pull it in to the room.Then, it is too big of a screen to place one hand underneath it (near the tv's base/stand) and the othr hand on the top center of the unit and easily lift it (like I would do with ease on my 32\"), so it was a hassle to find a way to lift it, and not strain my back, to get it onto my entertainment stand.

I was installing the TV in a new home which I had a built in made above the fire place for. The mount kit was easy to install and the tv just hangs on the mount.

My only complaint is that I have to go purchase a Blue Ray DVD and I will probably need to upgrade to HD sattellite. Once you see 1080P on this TV you will want nothing less. That being said it does a good job of scaling up standard definition, way better than my friends Sony CRT projection TV that is also 1080P.

The picture quality of hd and sd tv transmissions so far is average and not that impressive. The blacks are not as black but the colors are good. The motion blur is also minimal due to 120 hz refresh rate. The sound quality is subpar from the tv speakers.The usb port on this tv does not support mpeg movies. For that you have to get 'wiselink pro' in 750 or 850 models, as I was told by samsung rep. That was a misinformation in amazon's site. The 'pip' function is totally useless and requires 'rocket sceince' extra cables connections. The 'pip' picture is analog and subpar and not worth wasting your time with difficult connections.This tv does not have 'DLNA' and only higher models have them to recieve contents from your PC. I have comcast cable and very few channels have 1080i resolution. Most have 720p and 480i resolution. None of the channel are 1080p. You might be better off buying lower end lcd tv, 720p, to save money if your cable company does not support 1080p.The plastic frame and stand gather dust easily and can get scratched on wiping if you are not careful. Also the frame reflects light badly as it is made of shiny plastic material. I had no problem with 'touch of red' color in the frame. There are tv function 'touch buttons' on the left side the frame but they are extremely hard to see. They do not light up on touch and I suppose only the later models have this facility.The remote is subpar and for most of the common functions you have to go through menu and submenus. The wheel function on the remote is very touch sensitive and takes some practise to master.The tv supposedly has QAM cable box internally but you still need external cable box to get most of the channels. I did not get this? That was a disappointment. The quality of the over the air hd channels was better on my old ctr tv then on this tv. So you have to fork out extra money to your cable company to get HD box. Also there is only one coaxial input jack at the back of the tv and you have to buy a switch and a splitter to change between the input sources... for over the air channels and cable tv.Overall the tv is only 3 stars out of 5. But supposedly, this is the better option than the other brands of tv's at this price at this time....from 'consumer report' and public reviews. I think this tv is over rated. I would have gone for the samsung's 750 model but there were lot of complains about the frame bleeding color and breaking up. If price is not a factor then pioneer's plasma tvs, would be the best choice.And by the way the amazon's customer service is excellent and I got prompt $99 refund on this tv as the price dropped. I would definately buy from amazon site again. But be careful and make sure that you only buy from amazon on this site as other vendors also sell tv's/items also on amazon and their retrun policy and shipping is not free.Also don't forget to buys hdmi and svga cables at the same time of the TV purchase to connect dvd players and pc. Otherwise you will have to wait for their arrivals. They are extremely cheaply priced at amazon and you will save bundle as compared to retail stores.

The difference is far less than I originally thought and fixable. The 46\" had what I thought was perfect color out of the box but now I think it might be a bit green in the White Balance G-Gain.I found the 52\" color on flesh tones and other things like carrots can be too magenta or green but there is something you can do about it.  The fix is NOT to adjust the Flesh Tones or the Colors Space but instead to adjust the White Balance.  The settings that I found to be the best are the R-Offset 24, R-Gain 23, B-Gain 23, G-Gain 26 (all the rest being default 25).  This took a lot of effort because I was originally adjusting Flesh Tones, Tint, and Color Space until I stumbled onto the idea that just the White Balance was the culprit. I guess it makes sense.  The white balance is the canvas all colors are painted on so it will change them all.  It could also be that the tv is new and the back light bulb hasn't had sufficient burn in time to produce it's expected kelvin color yet?After making the minor color adjustments on the 52\" I will be keeping it over the smaller 46\".One good difference between the two is the 46\" needs to be set to a back  light of 7 (143 watts) to equal the 52\" in brightness set to just 4 (166).  This makes the power difference of just 23 watts which I thinks is pretty good for the size difference.POWER FIGURESOnly thing that matters with power consumption is the back lighting so that's all I am listing.

If the Tivo is connected to HDMI port 1 it works pretty well.  Sometimes the Tivo will suddenly stop responding to the remote and requires the tv to be turned off then back on.  This is not very often and no big deal.  But, if the Tivo box is connected to HDMI port 2, 3, or 4, then the Tivo will not respond to the remote at all once the tv is powered on and starts scanning channels.  It's like the tv starts ouputing some kind of connection signal that blocks the remote signal to the Tivo.  This might also be occurring on cable boxes.  I hope this problem doesn't start occurring more often and it actually makes me a little nervous about owning this and knowing Samsung's service is so bad.Addition:I saw a ln55a950 with the LED back lighting and wasn't all that impressed with the difference.  It made a movie \"Air Force One\" with Harrison Ford look 3-D but not sure if a LN52A650 wouldn't have done the same thing.  Other than that it was over saturating the colors which isn't good, I just mean that the 650 does colors as bright and clear as they need be so adding any more color makes them too saturated.  I'm going to just keep the $2000 difference and wait another 6 years till something dramatically better comes out that blows even the 950 away for far less. Heck, maybe already the '09 leds are way better and cheaper. time march's on and no sense blowing it all on just the current absolute best, there will be better and cheaper in the future.

That was it!So I went shopping on the internet and found the best deal on Amazon Samsung LN52A650 52-Inch 1080p 120 Hz LCD HDTV with Red Touch of Color. They even had \"White Glove Delivery\". (That's a different great experience--highly recommend). When we set up the TV......both of us said, \"WOW!!!!!\" It looks bigger and better than in the store!!  am not kidding! This is absolutely astounding!! Everybody who walks in says, \"WOW!\"I read all the reviews and was concerned about the reflections in the screen and about the color of the bezel. We have no problems with neither. There is nothing we don't like. As a matter of fact, we are moving this weekend and ordered another 52\" of almost the exact same..LN52A750.. its a little cheaper now than what we paid for the 650.We are so excited because we do not have HD, yet. That LN52A650 does such a great job of extrapolation of the satellite picture, everyone thought it was high def. Then we bought a Blu Ray. And we thought the satellite picture was great! These movies look better than real life. How can that be????Needless to say, we're hooked. We just ordered HD for both our TVs with our move to our new house.Samsung has done a fantastic job on this TV. Like I said, we had our LN52A650 for almost a year now, we just ordered the LN52A750.

Very thorough in every detail. Once he left, I played with the system for hours. It is a fairly intuitive television even with its numerous features. I don't know how I could be more pleased with the results. Hi-Def live sports programs are absolutely amazing. The 120Hz Auto Motion Plus and 4ms response time lets you follow the action at any speed very clearly. From a slapshot to a line drive homer, you see it all!! If you are considering a purchase such as this, I say do all the research you want and the process will probably lead you to the Samsung LN52A650 52-Inch 1080p 120 Hz LCD HDTV with Red Touch of Color.", "Date": "May 22, 2009"}, {"Title": "So far so good", "Author": "R.

First of all, the reason I bought it from Best Buy was that they were selling it at $1,899.99 last week.  Moreover, they have an exclusive deal with Samsung, whereby if you return the UPC from the box to NFL.com, along with proof of purchase, then you are eligible for $200 worth of free memorabilia from NFL.com.  Furthermore, thru the end of January, you get $200 off the $250 calibration fee.  So even though I paid tax for this TV and shipping of $70, the calibration (scheduled for mid-March) only cost $50.Anyway, the 52\" TV sits right next to the 52\" Sony Bravia at the Best Buy in Leesburg, VA.  As far as I'm concerned for comparison sake, the USS Samsung blows the USS Sony right out of the water! LOL  This TV is second to none!  Why pay more for the Sony (a lot more, I might add), when the Samsung looks much better, anyway?  Seems like a \"No-Brainer\" to me...The set-up was simple.  A quick set-up guide comes with the TV, but I didn't even use that.  I pretty much just hooked everything up without even using the manual.  I have checked out the manual since I hooked it up, so I could see what some of the options are.  For the most part, you can familiarize yourself with all the functions just by going through the remote control, if you know what you are doing.In any event, there are only a few minor things I don't like about the TV, but that certainly didn't persuade me from buying it...that's for sure!  This is me just being picky:1) The manual buttons on the lower right-hand side of the TV are extremely difficult to see, especially at night if you have the lights off.  Then again, why would you need to use them since you have the remote control (which has a function that lights it up in the dark)?2) The remote control's spinning wheel function may be a liability to some users.  I am going back to Best Buy to get the \"normal\" remote control for that model.  The sales guy that sold me the TV told me he would give me one free, if I wanted one.  The spinning wheel is actually easy to use if you are familiar with an IPod.  Plus, you can just use the up, down, left, or right function, without actually spinning the wheel.3) The remote control is very sleek.  But if you lay it down on your coffee table near the edge, it will slide off, due to the shape of the remote.  No big deal, but just wanted to mention that.Anyway, I am waiting for the Panasonic DMP-BD35K Blu-Ray Disc Player  to come back in stock at Best Buy.  It's sold out at 3 Best Buy stores in my location, and Amazon is charging $400 for it, when Best Buy is only charging $300.  The reviews on that player are better than the Sony's and Samsung's.Buy this TV now!  I watched the Super Bowl yesterday, and the colors and clarity are \"Mind-Boggling\"!  Use the Dynamic function for very bright rooms, Normal function for normal circumstances, and the Movie function during movies.  Then again, there are plenty of options for everyone to use.  Different strokes for different folks!Oh, and by the way, there is absolutely nothing wrong with the audio speaker sound on this awesome TV!  Comparing that sound to a 5.1 or 7.1 surround sound is like comparing...well...the Detroit Lions to the Pittsburgh Steelers.  LOLAnd I have it set up in my family room in a beautiful mahogany entertainment center, so the \"Touch-Of-Red\" bezel looks sweet!  No need to hook up an entertainment system because that would be too much clutter in that room, according to my wife.  :)  So if you want to rely on the speakers from the unit (without a surround sound system hooked up), then you won't be disappointed.  Besides, there are plenty of adjustments on the remote control to enhance/improve the sound coming from the TV.  You just have to know what you are doing.Danny from Leesburg, VArfkrox44@hotmail.com", "Date": "January 25, 2009"}, {"Title": "Samsung 650  LCD TV is Awesome!!!!", "Author": "Timothy Thomas \"The Wireless Doctor\"", "ReviewID": "R1JBLXFTBU6SZN", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Samsung 650  LCD TV is Awesome!!!!

I've always had hand-me-downs or have gotten gifts, but never researched and purchased my very own TV. This 52\" Samsung LCD is replacing a big, heavy, 34\" tube television - good riddance!For years, I've been using the internet to research any big purchase, and for electronics, my search usually begins at CNET. I never expected to spend as much as I did, or get a television as large either. Amazon helped me out a bit, by offering a great price, free shipping, and 2-year interest free financing.This is undoubtedly the best television I have ever owned. OK, that's not saying much at all, but it has the best picture I have ever seen on a television. Nothing else comes close. I watch other people buying no-name LCDs or whatever BJs or CostCo happens to have on sale - they're saving a few bucks now, but they don't know what they're missing. I hope to have this TV for the rest of my life!I read many of the reviews here on Amazon regarding this TV. Some of the bad reviews focused on isolated problems with the actual television, but most of them were due to shipping problems and had nothing to do with the television. Don't let that stop you! I ordered the set on a Friday night, and the TV was delivered early Wednesday morning, less than 5 days later. White-glove delivery was included in the purchase, but I wasn't ready to set it up when it arrived and it was pouring outside, so I had them put it down just inside the house. Because of the cold, I waited a few hours before powering the TV on (condensation can form due to the temp change and can cause a short-circuit). The driver had a form for me to initial saying that I did not open the box and inspect the set, and that I had 30 days in which to do so. They told me to hold onto the box for 30 days in case it needed to be returned.A couple other negative comments were about the speakers. I have to say that the sound is pretty good for built-in speakers. Understand this though - I've never owned a sound system of any kind. I want to get a system of some kind, along with a Blu-Ray player, but I'm in no rush.Out of the box, the picture was pretty amazing. I found some picture setting/adjustment recommendations on CNET and on AVSforums and I've only begun trying to tweak the picture. You can play with it all day, but take notes on what you do & don't like. If it gets all crazy, it only takes a second to reset the picture - nice!Be sure to order a HDMI cable right away. Don't buy a \"monster\" cable for $100. A $2 cable on Amazon is probably enough. I splurged on a $10 cable and it works great! If you wait till the TV arrives, you'll be stuck paying at least $40 from any of the local stores for a basic HDMI cable - a total rip-off!If you don't already have an HD box from your cable provider, get one before the TV arrives. You'll hate yourself if you have to watch \"regular\" television on this beauty! My cable provider sent me a new HD box via FedEx after I saw on their website that they'll ship it directly to me. I used the component cables they included with the set-top-box to hook up my old DVD player - thanks cable guy!", "Date": "January 9, 2009"}, {"Title": "LCD television", "Author": "Rain man \"Seattle Native\"", "ReviewID": "R1I32Y59N8N1JT", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Very satisfied with this television.

However on further analysis, I found that LN52A650 TV was almost equal to Sony in all aspect and is the best value for the money. One option I liked was that this TV has an Optical digital Audio output which I think is really cool when using audio receiver. However the TV outputs 5.1 channel audio only while using  ON-AIR (antenna) signal. If the source is digital (dvd, cable) the out put is just 2 channel stereo.Amazon had the best deals on this TV compared to any other reliable retailers. They shipped the TV the very next day. I was notified that the TV has been shipped via Pilot shipping service.This is where things started changing.I called Pilot after 3 days to check on the package and they informed that they will be delivering it on Monday and they will be sending two guys since it is a white glove service. Even then, I planned to be at home during delivery and that turned out to be a very good decision. Even after confirmation, they sent only one guy for delivery. I had to help him to lift the 109 lb package. Secondly, I saw a huge hole on the box at the bottom right corner and gashes on the sides. My initial thought was that the LCD must have been damaged. There were couple of holes even on the inside cover. However I couldn't notice any damage/scratches on the panel. Since it was cold outside, he suggested me that I  wait for at least 4 hours before switching on the TV.That was the longest four hours I have spent for quiet sometime now. When I finally switched on the TV, I simply couldn't believe the amazing HD pictures. Both I and my wife were blown over by the clarity and the richness of the picture. If you are a fense sitter, I would suggest you buy this TV in a heart beat. Definitely worth the money.However I did notice scratches on the stand and the bezel. I called Amazon (1-866 423-5355) about this and they promptly offered 1) to replace the TV or 2) Discount on the sale price.Even though there were some incidents, I would definitely buy from Amazon. They have a very friendly CSR and they tend to take care of issues very quickly.AddOn: I am planning to buy the 5 yrs extended service warranty from samsung again on Amazon. I think it is better to have such an insurance on such a large investment.

At that time, because of the Consumer Reports rating and the customer reviews in this thread, I had determined that this is the HDTV I wanted. Since I was delayed in my ability to go forward I had planty of time to look at other threads and, more important, to observe the HDTV's in the homes of family and friends.Because of this I ended up deciding that I wanted to look at plasmas. The reviews alerted me to the facts that plasma sets are at a disadvantage in brightly lit stores, since all sets -- LCD's and Plasmas alike -- have to be set in a vivid mode to attract our attention. In other words, the settings have to be \"bigger than life\" to be in the running.Since the very vivid settings on the LCD's is even more vivid than the plasmas, they tend to get all of the attention.The comments in the blogs that swayed me were the ones that referred to the more realistic, life-like pix the better plasmas offerred. As I observed the LCS's of friends, I ended up agreeing with the ones who had written that movies, particularly, played on an LCD had a cartoonish look -- unreal.I became more and more interested in looking into plasmas and ended up focusing on the Panasonic G10. I stumbled on this thread[...]which is now over 200 pages long. I finally found a store that had one that was hooked up to a pretty good program source. I became convinced that this was the one that I wanted. I have now had the 50\" G10 for six weeks or so and I do not believe I have ever seen a TV with better PQ. (The possible exception is the Pioneer Kuro. Since I have not seen them side by side I can not be sure. Certainly both or outstandig. Since the Kuro costs over twice as much I can say without qualification that, unless money is no object at all that the G10 is the definite choice.I bought my set from Amazon Warehouse, where the price fluctuates even more wildly that the regular Amazon listings. I figured that, for around a thousand dollars that, with the 30 day return privilege I had everything to gain and little to lose. The reviews I had stumbled across that were uniformly positive helped make my decision.I was overwhelmed. Everything was so much better than I was led to believe from the Amazon Warehouse listing. The delivery time was about a week, the delivery was white gloves -- perfect in every respect -- with the TV assembled on its base and placed into the armoire that I had prepared for it -- before the delivery man left.The TV was absolutely new. Although it was an \"opened box\" offering, I don't think the set had ever been out of the box. The set still had the protective covering on the bezel. Perfect in every way.This is probably the best thought out best purchse I have ever made. While it will not be right for everyone I can assure you there are a vast number of people who buy another brand or another model who would have been happier with a Panny G10.By the way, the Panny successors -- the V10 and the V15 -- are basically the same, as I understand it. The lesser Pannys -- like the S1 -- are not as good as the G10, G15 and V10.I hope this helps your decision making process.", "Date": "May 4, 2009"}, {"Title": "Too close", "Author": "Randy Rubett \"Rags\"", "ReviewID": "R2VMBLJLGQ4WFB", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Samsung LN52A650 52-Inch 1080p 120 Hz LCD HDTV with Red Touch of Color I am wondering if I am too close.

I'm referring to the so called white glove service.  It seems when it was time for my Samsung to be delivered, absolutely none of the advertising points were followed.  To be more precise, I did not receive an advance notification for the delivery, it just arrived without any prior notice, only a knock on the door (I was in the shower).  Only one individual arrived and then implied that he'd need help moving the package, he originally only wanted to drop it off (in my garage) and leave, he refused to check the TV by plugging it in, saying he was only doing what he was told.  Of course I contacted the original shipper and he indicated that procedure was not followed (Hmmmm . . .I'm wondering who sent one individual?).  Anyway . . .I contacted Amazon and they basically indicated that was not normal and they would pass on my complaint.  I guess that was suppose to appease me.Ok . . . as far as the TV itself.  I received the Samsung before Direct TV installed my HD package.  I have always had an additional over the air antenna which I used for locals in the event of a satellite failure, so I thought I'd try it to see how local HD was.  The HD image that I received was impressive.Another thing I'd like to mention is that Samsung has some features that they advertise as cutting edge, which I really question.  The DNIe which is suppose to be cool appears to be nothing more than the picture turned on to vivid with most features turned to high . . . go figure.  Is it worth the additional bucks . . .probably not.The remote is another story.  It simply sucks.  It has one of those wheels like an ipod and it seemed I was always doing a function more than once.  I have several items attached to my home theatre and when I go to source to change functions the remote invariably starts another function that was not intended due to the wheel sensitivity.  Most of the menu items that you'd use has an extend feature which you have to hit the enter button.  Well, if you inadvertently move the wheel which is extremely sensitive to touch, you wind up either canceling what you were about to do or find yourself in another unrelated feature.  Anyone that is satisfied with this remote has simply never experienced one that works well, such as the MX-500 which is older technology but is still available and can control up to ten devices and has a better range than most remotes.  I transferred the functions to a MX-500 and was a happy camper again.The frame edge and other plastic parts seem to be made of a material which can be scratched by a fly landing harder than normal (ok, an exaggeration).  When dust collects, which it will in time and you make an attempt to dust, it will scratch the surface.  I realize they give you a cloth but it really makes little difference.Bottom line. . . . most people that make this purchase will ohhh and ahhh, however I'm being realistic.  I have no idea if other tv's have these shortcomings because most people wouldn't admit it if they did, instead they like to convince themselves they made a smart purchase.  The television is ok . . .probably better than most but certainly not without faults.  Would I buy the same unit again knowing what I know?  I'll let you know in about 3 years.  By the way, I bought the Samsung 1500 DVD player and it has never worked properly, even though the company sent me two firmware upgrades, which it simply spit out.  Sometimes it works . . . . sometimes not.  Depends on the barometric pressure I guess.  Anyway, I'll be sending it back soon and would suggest that people shy away from this product for a while.

In contrast, the Sony 120Hz model did not flicker so  I got the Sony instead and no headaches.  Sony's vivid picture mode makes the contrast just as good as the Samsung but I also get Sony reliability.  I ordered 2 Samsungs LCDs (different model) and 2 Sonys at work and the Sonys have been flawless for a year and half now whereas one of the Samsung's analog tuner had picture but no audio from day 1 and Samsung tech had to come out and replace the motherboard.  On a different 32\" Samsung LCD, the picture would go off after a second or two of staying on and it turned out that the power supply was bad... part costs $200 and labor costs $200... geez, a new tv costs about $600!Before this, I also bought a Vizio brand LCD tv and hooked it up to my DVD player using HDMI but I got picture and no sound; when I hooked up the DVD player to the SONY, both the picture and sound were fine so the Vizio was not reliable and if you didn't hook up using HDMI you would never know until it's too late to return it.  By the way, Vizio tvs are made by LG.", "Date": "August 21, 2008"}, {"Title": "Scratches on bezel", "Author": "Mary E.

It is all scratched looking.  If you have this tv...DO NOT rub your finger, or anything else for that matter across the bezel.  Not even a micro fiber cloth...because if you do...tiny hair like scratches will appear and you will never get rid of them.  Just a light touch with your finger will create more scratches.  I called Samsung about this and found numerous complaints on the internet.  They will do nothing about it.  I have also heard of some bezels separating from the tv.

I called Samsung; they sent a local tech; he said that I needed a new light engine; the techs at Samsung wouldn't authorize one - they say that it's normal operating procedure to have a white, hourglass shaped blob on the screen while you're watching TV.
