{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Very good TV with typical LCD shortcomings", "Author": "Review Man \"Review Man\"", "ReviewID": "RN4MGEBOAND7D", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Got this, my first HDTV, for $749 total delivered.  Seems like a great deal.  Has the AA01 panel:PROS:  Very good HD picture, which becomes stunning with good source material (after calibrating the picture); excellent SD picture (better than the good CRT TV it replaced); tons of controls for picture calibration; streaming Netflix is great, the Pandora app has become my household's new source for music of all types, either through the TV speakers or piped to the stereo; ethernet makes upgrading firmware and internet apps very easy; lots of connectivity; easy to set up; light; swivel stand works well; power efficient; doesn't get hot; no noise or buzz; no dead or stuck pixels; has analog audio out jack (important for old A/V receivers); functions as an outstanding computer monitor (with DVI-to-HDMI cable); glossy screen helps picture and repels dust; can't even notice the red \"Touch of Color\" design.CONS:  Though black levels are generally very good, when the screen and room are both dark you can see some flashlighting around the corners and some bleedthrough of the backlight; very fast motion on screen will cause brief pixelization and loss of picture clarity (has to be very fast motion -- football and other sports look great); picture quality degrades quickly as you move off-center (though not as much as in some other LCD TVs); requires major picture calibration out of the box (I used settings found in reviews of this TV on the web, tweaked them a bit to preference, and the picture's much better, though it's hard to get it right); most of the current internet apps are useless; the factory preset modes are useless.Overall it's a very good TV, with a picture that can sometimes be mesmerizing.  And I'm glad I paid a bit extra for the C650's internet connectivity and glossy screen.  But my main complaints - backlight bleedthrough, motion pixelization and off-center picture quality - lead me to believe that my next TV might be a plasma.  Sound is adequate, neither a pro or con really.  Four stars.", "Date": "August 4, 2010"}, {"Title": "Excellent TV", "Author": "ZS", "ReviewID": "R35CPF9W0C9R6Z", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I'm not going to focus on picture quality, there are plenty of reviews for the other Samsung TV's in this class (LN**C6/5**)that will give you some idea.  The short of it: Excellent picture quality, and superb build quality. Instead I'm going to focus on the extra \"Internet@TV\" features and it's media playback abilities. After all, that's the only reason to spend an extra hundred or two on this model right?Some of the Internet@TV apps aren't as gimmicky as you might expect.  Sure, there are some really awful games, some of which are trials.  I certainly wouldn't expect to buy any games for this TV.  Graphically, it isn't a capable machine.  They sort of remind me of a set of mediocre 2D-only flash games with really poor framerates. So, game apps are out.  That said, a small collection of the apps are actually very useful.  Netflix works great, and did so right out of the box.  Pandora is excellent, and unlike the online version, has no ads with a free account.  The youtube app also works great, although searching for videos can be a pain using the remote since you have to use some sort of phone-like input method for typing.  It does have T9 and a decent dictionary to speed things up. There are a couple of other video streaming apps that seem polished including Hulu Plus, Vudu, Blockbuster, and CinemaNow.  Hulu Plus is still in beta, but after trying out a few of their samples, it seems well made.  Vudu, Blockbuster, and CinemaNow are too expensive for my tastes, renting movies for 25%-30% of the price to own isn't worth it to me.  And buying a digital copy from either place without also having a physical copy doesn't cut it. Especially if they are the same price.There are twitter and facebook apps, but a lot of the use of those apps comes from communication.  I haven't yet tried either of them, but I can't imagine trying to type out any sort of response using the remote.  There's also a daily motion app, that works well and fits in the youtube category. Google maps is almost useful, but like the rest of the graphically intensive apps, there's a fluidity issue.  Scrolling the map is a little choppy, and typing in addresses to get directions is slow using the remote.  When you throw in the time it takes to load the app, type the addresses,  and get your directions, you might as well have got up from the couch and used the computer.  It's at least a cool toy to show friends.The slideshow apps GettyImages, and Picasa Web Albums sort of fall in the same category.  They both get a bunch of pics from the web, fine art, and photos, and display them as a slideshow on the TV. They work well enough, but could use a little polish; it would have been great if there was a smooth transition between pics, but both just lazily switch from one photo to the next.There is a Napster app, but I don't have a subscription to try it out.  I'd imagine it would work fairly well, and have a similar flow to the Pandora app, which is great.  The AP news ticker app is pretty well done.  Instead of interrupting TV, it puts a small ticker at the bottom of the screen and displays various news bytes.  At any time, you can change the category or call up the news article being displayed to read it in it's entirety complete with pictures.  All without any interruption.The last app of sorts is the Yahoo! app,  although what it amounts to is a gadget bar that runs across the bottom of the screen.  You can call the gadget bar at any time by pressing the Yahoo button on the remote.  There's a bunch of gadgets you can get for it, and a few redundancies with the apps.  In a lot of ways it is more useful.  For example, the Accuweather app is fairly lame and not really worth the time it takes to open it.  But, the Accuweather gadget is quite a bit better - faster to open, doesn't interrupt what you are watching, has a five day forcast, radar, weather alarms, and a bunch of small bits of weather info.  The news and finance gadgets aren't bad either.The other reason you might want this TV over the lesser models it it's media playing capabilities. The TV itself doesn't play a whole host of formats.  It doesn't seem to directly support a lot of fairly common codecs like h264 or AC3;  it's possible that the videos I had in those formats, the TV just didn't like for other reasons like resolution, though.  Your best bet are the older mpeg4 codecs like xvid/divx with simple mp3 audio in an avi container.  This only matters though for videos that are on a device directly connected to a TV, like a flash drive or external hard drive.  If you are using the networking capabilities to stream video from another computer, it can support just about every format and resolution.  It has never failed to play a video from my PC.  And those videos are in just about every format around.  It's played DVD VOB's directly from a folder, mkv and avi containers, h264, xvid/divx, AC3 audio, etc.Here's the key:  You have to install a proper DLNA media streamer on the computer.  Only one free one exists that'll to the job. Pay attention now.  You have to use Serviio if you have any chance of playing all those formats.  Serviio.org has all the details and a great community of Samsung TV users that have had excellent experience using the program.  Some gripes with streaming on the TV though is that you can't fast forward or rewind yet.  I believe Samsung is working on a technique to do it properly, but it's tricky to do from a DLNA protocol standpoint.  Serviio also does a great job of grabbing meta-data (video art, genre, director etc.) from the title of the file.  With Serviio, media streaming is a pleasure.Some other things to note, Samsung does seem to be supporting the platform - every week or so, some apps have updates, the TV itself has had an update or two since I bought it about a month ago.  With it connected to the internet all of this is painless and fast.All in all, it's a great purchase.  For the price I paid, the extra features were worth it.  But it may not be for some others.  If you don't want/need network media streaming capabilities, there isn't any reason to get this TV over it's lower cost brothers.  For me, it was great having exactly two cables connected to the TV: Power and Ethernet.  That's all I need for all my media.", "Date": "August 20, 2010"}, {"Title": "Best picture all around", "Author": "Ricky D", "ReviewID": "R2XCWI3C9RJHJA", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Looked at many LCD TV's and the picture quality on a Samsung is hard to beat.

The TV looks great, and it has scored very well in most picture quality reviews.  I paid the extra money for this model with the internet capabilities but probably shouldn't have.  I've found really no use for most of the Samsung Apps - nobody really is going to check facebook or twitter on their TV anyway.  Netflix is probably the big draw, but I currently am not using Netflix. I've tried some of the movie renting apps and they work fine.  The DLNA works, and is cool for a few days, but I never really have a need for it.  I got the wireless adapter for the TV and it seems to work just fine also.  So I'll focus my review on my experience with what happened when something went wrong with my TV.After three months, the TV stopped working.  The whole screen went dead, I could smell a faint electrical burning smell, and no lights on the TV would work at all. I called Samsung, gave them the information for the TV and they contacted the local repair shop that would come out and fix it.  This part all went smooth.I talked to the local repair shop and described what had happened with the TV, and over the phone he diagnosed it as a power supply issue.  In the past, Samsung has had ongoing problems with their power supplies, specifically the 2008 and 2009 models.  Now, because the power supply went out in my 2010 model it could just mean that I was unlucky, but it could also mean that Samsung hasn't really resolved their power supply issues. It remains to be seen which of these is true.  The main problem that I had was that it took weeks for the necessary part to come in.  I talked with the repair guy about it.  If Samsung has power supply issues why don't they keep samsung power supplies in stock?  He also told me that Panasonic ships parts overnight while samsung does not.  This is a real issue.  We know that a certain amount of LCD TVs will fail within the warranty time frame - it's just the way it is.  Getting these TVs fixed as fast as possible should be a top priority for any company, and I feel that Samsung is lagging behind.  Once the part did come in, it was a 15 min. fix and all is back to normal with the TV.  The repair shop and Samsung handled all the other details of the warranty claim, no hassel for me.  But how long before the new power supply fails?So I guess my recommendation to you is if you're trying to decide between samsung and another TV company the stats say they each have a similar chance of failing within 3 years.  If that happens, which company will try to get your TV fixed the fastest?  Probably not Samsung.  It's a \"what if\", but if everything else is equal I would avoid Samsung just for this reason.", "Date": "December 17, 2010"}, {"Title": "Fantastic picture", "Author": "HF Geek", "ReviewID": "R20IJDX8SMHEU5", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I've only had this TV about two weeks, but am totally blown away by the picture quality.  I was originally planning on getting the 550 series or a similar LG, but when I found the LN40C650 on sale for less than what I had priced the LN40C550, I jumped on it.I have the TV connected to an HD cable converter using the HDMI connection, and the picture is fantastic.  I also have an upconverting 1080p DVD player connected to it and I've never seen images so sharp and crisp.  I had thought I'd need to upgraded to BD, but I can't see how the picture would be that much better.While the Samsung Apps are interesting, I'm not sure if they're really worth the extra money.  I've been using the Amazon Video on Demand through the Yahoo app with no problems.  It was very easy to setup and easy to use.  It's nice to be able to order movies and TV shows directly through the TV without having to turn on the computer.  However, other apps aren't as useful.  The YouTube app only shows you top rated videos and doesn't allow you to search.  Although if you link your YouTube account to the TV you can view your favorites.  You can only use Hulu if you subscribe to Hulu Plus and setting up apps like Facebook are painful as you have to enter your login and password through the TV remote.  (Like typing on a telephone)  Although these issues aren't really Samsung's fault but the fault of the app developer.  (Amazon displays a code that you enter into your computer to link the TV to your Amazon account making set up super easy.)The TV is also able to play media over the network from your computer, however the playback controls for this type of media is more limited and required installing a sharing application from Samsung on the PC.I did find the Auto-Motion Plus 120Hz setting a little annoying.  While it made it easier to read scrolling text, it made action scenes in movies appear jumpy.  Luckily this is easy to turn off.One small feature I really like about this TV is that in addition to the two digital audio outputs it also has an analog audio output that allowed me to connect it to my existing analog stereo system.  The LG that I was looking at only had digital output which would have required me to buy a new stereo.The backlighting on the remote is also a nice feature, it's just too bad that it can't control my cable box.Overall I have no regrets on purchasing this TV.", "Date": "January 3, 2011"}, {"Title": "Beautiful TV with great DLNA support", "Author": "a2poor \"a2poor\"", "ReviewID": "R1WEG9D0RXVTA5", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Got this baby a little cheaper about a month ago -- Amazon's 2 year interest free promo made me jump.I find myself to be a tech geek and this TV filled my needs.  WMP sharing on networked computers works well with the built-in media player the TV has.  As long as it has an avi extension, it will show up (and play).  I watched a 1080p MKV that just needed the mkv extension changed to avi.  Quality was stunning.

The picture is crazy good, sometimes it almost seems too good. Like you're no longer watching a movie, but rather actors on a set. It was a little trippy at first but it was easy to get used to.The first time you turn on the tv it will walk you through a set up routine. I liked this because it got me familiar with the tv and everything got set up right. Using all of the features is really easy. Like navigating through all the menus and features or switching between different components. Speaking of components I just found out that when the tv is off and you turn on your blue ray, the tv will turn itself on all by itself and automatically switch to the blueray input - pretty cool in my book.The reason I picked this TV was because of the great Samsung reviews on CNET and for the ability to play Netflix. I've got to say that Netflix on the TV is awesome.  It's way better than watching movies on your computer, way better.The only issue I have right now isn't really the TV's fault. My streaming from Netflix gets spotty sometimes and the shows I'm watching will stop and re-buffer multiple times. I blame my internet connection and not the TV.One unexpected benefit I've gotten is pulling up the weather on Yahoo!. In the past I would have to turn on my computer to check the weather and this could take a couple of minutes.

I can connect to Netflix and even see my Instant Queue, but the TV freezes when I select a movie to watch. I have to unplug the power to make the TV usable again. Yes, just like a Windows computer.Since I wanted to buy a Blu-Ray player anyway, I now bought an LG-BD550 which is actually able to stream Netflix properly. With the combination of TV and Blu-Ray player I am happy now - except that I have to use 2 remote controls to watch a streamed movie from Netflix.So my advice is... if you want to stream Netflix from this TV, save the extra bucks on the internet feature from Samsung and buy the model without it.", "Date": "June 1, 2010"}, {"Title": "Great TV!

Bongiorno", "ReviewID": "R1NVY9D1WPMSBD", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Summary:Great TV -- clear picture, yadayada blah blah. I am new to HDTV so for me, it all looks great. This review isn't about that. This review is about when they begin to mix software functionality with your TV the results aren't always prettyTo start, to say this TV has usability issues is an understatement. The way all the internet tv functionality works is essentially through a kind of user profile. You create this profile and assign a pin to it. It is in this profile that all user name and passwords for the various services you have are stored. Considering how many that might be, this isn't a half-bad idea. But, now it goes down hill.Entering usernames and passwords is done using the number pad on the remote. This is literally like entering text messages on your cell (T9, repeat press). Except that you can't enter user names like 'r u serious? OMG. Lol' because those won't work. So, yes, you have to enter, for your netflix account 'joe_the_plumber@somethinglong.isp.net' and all those special characters are 5 button presses away -- don't forget the password because this is the best part!Drum roll: you cannot enter the letter 'z'. That's right folks. 'Z' cannot be entered through any means except using your x-powers. When you press the 'wxyz' button to cycle to 'z' it does: 'w,x,y,w,x,y...' and you wonder WTH? Where is 'z'? So, if your password contains a 'z' the game is up. To be fair though most of the software problems are application specific, but they all have one insanely annoying feature in common.Go to log into netflix/pandora or any paid service and you get a little message: \"please go to [...] and enter this number:\" to which you are given a 8 character alpha/numeric code that you must do as they say with. Why does this not do it for me I wonder? Better yet, why do I need this at all? I don't have to register my computer when I watch netflix online. What gives!!!? What gives is some freakish anti-consumer-friendly business agreement between service provider/content provider/tv provider. I am sure it has to do with licensing and IP. I am sure it has to do with lock-in and profits.Finally, since netflix is what I use most, and I have no better place to put it, let me comment on the app itself: It sucks.For this netflix application you have an 'instant' queue. When you watch from your PC you never bother with this feature because you usually just play it on-the-spot. Well, queues are nice when you can only have 3 disks out at a time. But these aren't disks. They aren't anything actually. They are iconic representations of data. But, to play any content on your netflix device you must1) Log into the TV2) Log into netflix.com3) add whatever movie is available/you want to your 'instant queue'4) press the 'internet@' button5) select netflix app6) Log on to netflix app.7) Scan through your queue of 80 movies.8) Press the center button9) press it again10*) if you are watching a series, press it againSide note: fast forward and reverse do not work like on your dvd player. Press FF and it continues to go until your press the play or stop button (which, btw is THE most inaccessible button on the absolute bottom of the remote)But, this service/app combo is so convenient it's narcotic. Need a quick Thomas the tank Engine for an antsy 2 year old? BANG! Done! Need a TV series up in a hurry for an antsy wife? BANG! Done!The YouTube app is equally handicapped but convenient.Seriously, if Apple would work with content providers and stick a dvd drive in their Apply TV the world could be a great place.Oh, did I mention the TV sometimes 'crashes'?", "Date": "April 12, 2010"}, {"Title": "Good tv", "Author": "Sandy", "ReviewID": "R1HNQ9UET6CH4W", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "This is a gret tv with all the features that it has.

I'll break my review down by relevant sections to make it easier to read.Hardware: Very solidly constructed and made of quality glass and metal including the nine + pounds of glass that comprise the swiveling base. The entire frame is made of a lightweight metal instead of plastic which gives it an all around classy look and feel, such as you would expect from a bit higher end set like this. Nothing about it feels chintzy or skimped. The remote isn't going to win awards for design or function but it works well enough and is laid out reasonably well.  It also has a built in back-light which will activate upon most buttons being pressed or with an on/off button.  The included remote is adequate, although cumbersome when trying to enter in alpha characters or symbols.  What makes controlling the TV much easier however, is the fact that you can download a free app for your iTouch or smartphone (I use my iphone 4) and this combination really elevates control to the level of excellent.  (Note the app uses your devices` Wifi to control the set so you will need to have a wifi adapter \"dongle\" attached to your TV if you want to control the set in this way).  Don't recall if it was mentioned under the product description, but the TV has a pretty interesting touch panel integrated at the bottom of the panel bezel which lets you change channels, control sound, turn the set on and off, etc.  Since it is sitting on my computer desk, this is occasional helpful to me, but probably much less so if you are typically sitting half way across a room from it.  A nice little bonus 'touch' though if you ask me. ;)Display: Excellent, after some moderate calibration (which this TV has plenty of advanced options to tweak with) and the black levels are the darkest for any LCD set I've ever owned, approaching those of a quality plasma. SD television looks very good on this set, HD looks superb. Playing Blu Ray discs on this TV look absolutely stunning.  I'm also using my set as a PC monitor (hooked up via an HDMI link) and the text is very crisp and clear. Oddly, I had to use my NVIDIA Control Panel software (software that comes with my PC's video card) to adjust the screen size to fit my Windows 7 desktop which ended up with a resolution of 1080 x 1842 (as opposed to 1080 x 1920.) I suspect it would have been fine via the \"PC In\" VGA port but I wasn't interested in sacrificing picture quality to do that).Sound: The sound, as with virtually every set out there, is lacking quite a bit, sounding somewhat tinny and not much bass to speak of.  But then a majority who buy a TV in this price range and above are going to hook up after-market sound sources to an entertainment device like this anyhow so most people won't really care. I have mine connected to my PC's audio card via an Audioquest fiber optic cable, with some quality 5.1 speakers and everything sounds great.  If you plan on just using it as a secondary TV for say, your bedroom, or are only going to use it for a PC monitor then I'd imagine it would be adequate.Interface: The interface itself is attractive with some animated icons added in that don't look cheesy at all. Most of the layout is pretty intuitive and fairly logically grouped under appropriate labels.Wireless and Internet: The widgets and Internet apps are mostly redundant since I do have it connected to my computer but it's nice to know I always have that option. They are not very well implemented though (interface and selection aren't great) A TV like this is just begging for an OS such as Android (say 3.0 or later when that hits) but it does work well enough to watch things like Hulu+, Netflix, Vudu, Amazon Video On Demand, etc. (all of which I tested and they work well enough). Things like Facebook and Twitter are pretty poorly implemented and I could only envision someone using those for very limited purposes if at all.  You do need to purchase the Wireless \"dongle\" (Wifi adapter) separately and/or connect it via Ethernet. A lot of people [understandably] complain about this and I also agree the adapter should have been either built into the set or included. Mine WAS included by buying the set here at Amazon, but I have no idea how long that particular promotion will be continued for. It runs around $60ish street price if you do end up buying separate or I've heard you can use a Rosewill and perhaps one or two other brands which you can snag for around $20-30ish. Personally I have mine, hardwired via the Ethernet port as well as with the dongle (so that I can use the Wifi iphone remote) but that's me. All and all this is an excellent set and with more firmware updates it will only become better in my opinion.", "Date": "December 29, 2010"}, {"Title": "All-around great TV", "Author": "Shawn Hubbard", "ReviewID": "R2TRKFIW0OUDUT", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I recently received my Samsung LN40C650, and I am very happy with the TV.  We were going back and forth on our decision, considering an LED tv or this one.  We finally chose this one because of the cost/feature comparison.  In my opinion, LED-lit LCD TVs have a little ways to go in terms of price (also technology, light bleeding due to the LED being on the outside edge seems to be an issue on just about every LED tv I've seen), and this model also includes internet connectivity for cheaper than the bottom-rung LED tv.The picture is fantastic, and they give you a bevy of options to adjust the picture quality.  Certain viewing angles seem to be problematic, but I would assume that most people would be viewing their TV straight on, and not off to the side.We also picked up the Samsung WIS09ABGN LinkStick Wireless LAN Adapter in order to connect the TV to our wireless network at home.  It is unfortunate that they didn't include bult in wifi connectivity, and the fact that you have to buy proprietary hardware is a little frustrating.  However, the Link Stick is well worth it, I assure you.  Unless you have a cable modem or router within a few feet of your TV, you will want this.All in all, the experience of internet on TV and the Samsng Apps is better than you would expect.  I find the user interface fairly easy to navigate.  The updates of the applications move pretty slowly upon first activation, but after that, it seems pretty quick.  You do have to excersise a little more patience than normal because the TV doesn't have the most snappy processor around, but it isn't too bad.  The netflix app is great, we've been able to watch certain shows in HD quality.

It was noticeable when viewing straight on, but did get worse if you moved off to the left-side.Backlight bleeding is a common problem with LCDs, but this was definitely not acceptable for a $700 TV.I returned the TV next day without any problems and received my refund in about one week.For any of you who are interested, this TV had the AA01 panel.Here is a link to the photos showing the backlight bleeding: http://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-media/customer-gallery/AOWF9T81XMX2S/ref=cm_aya_bb_lists***UPDATE 2/10***I went to Best Buy a few days ago to see if I could find another TV that caught my eye and found that the next best one was the Sony 40EX500. I made up my mind that this would be my next TV, but upon leaving the store I noticed a c670 near the front door. Out of curiosity, I looked on the back of this TV and noticed that it too had the AA01 panel (and this one was unbelievably awesome).Since I was not as impressed with the Sony, I returned home and decided to try my luck with Samsung again. I placed another order thru Amazon and will post another update with my findings as soon as the TV arrives.What would be the chances in receiving another dud?***UPDATE 2/12***Went to Best Buy with a friend because he was looking to purchase a new TV and had five $100 gift cards. I recommended the c670 and told the sales person to only bring out a TV if it had a SQ02 panel - they had only one with this panel, the rest were A panels.I helped him set up the TV and the everything is near perfect with this one. There is no backlight bleeding, but a very small amount of flashlighting on the bottom corners - probably not noticeable to anyone but a perfectionist.***UPDATE 2/15***Just received my new replacement TV from Amazon and let it warm up a bit before I plugged it into my computer (at the office). This too was an AA01 panel.Initially, I thought this TV was perfect and I played a few photo slide shows and a company video thru my desktop. Everything appeared to be just fine in my office environment.I took the TV home and set everything up and noticed that unlike the S panel, this panel had some backlight bleeding along the entire left side of the screen and in the upper and lower right side of the screen. The bleeding was definitely not as bad as the first TV I received from Amazon, but at this point I am seriously considering sending this one back too. Again, this much backlight bleeding for a $700 TV is not acceptable.I called my friend and asked to borrow his SQ02 panel so I could compare the two side-by-side.***UPDATE 2/17***Compared the c650 and c670 side-by-side last night and the picture quality was just about identical - there really is not much of a difference at all. I will say that the c670 with the S panel does do a better job displaying various patterns and there is little to no flashing - whereas with the c650 with the A panel, the patterns flash like crazy!The c650 with the A panel is cloudier in general and I found that if I turned the backlight down to 7 (vs default of 14) and the brightness to 30 (vs default of 45) the bleeding is slightly reduced when watching cable programming or a DVD.***UPDATE 2/18***I'm going to give the TV more chances over the weekend, but as of now it's going back on Monday.My next purchase will probably be local so I can have some control over what panel I get.This is ridiculous.", "Date": "February 5, 2011"}, {"Title": "Internet Apps need work", "Author": "Arthur Cordaro \"Artco\"", "ReviewID": "R3G8S9FGFII5ID", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I purchased this tv and must say the picture is really clear, However I can not figure out how to get to the 120 hz, when I hit the info button on the remote the tv displays only 1080i and 60 hz, do you need to have a blueray player to see the higher hz? also Netflix does not stream at all, it starts the movie well then restarts, I called Samsung (2) times to find out why I could not download the firmware update and tried several methods.

Ultimately decided on this Samsung model because of it's 'Ultra Clear Panel' which essentially is a glossy screen. You see, most LCD's have a matte screen, which is fantastic if you have a lot of sunlight in the room the TV is placed in, but not so hot if sunlight is not an issue. Matte screens tend to be a bit more dull of a picture compared to glossy screens that you'll find on plasmas, etc.Thankfully Samsung uses it's Ultra Clear Panel on select models. Makes for a fantastic picture. The colors truly pop under a glossy screen. I almost never watch TV during the day in my bedroom, so sunlight is a non issue. If you do have a ton of sunlight hitting your screen, I suggest another LCD model (and not a plasma set). Also not so hot with viewing angels. If you want people to be able to enjoy a TV standing from the sides you might want to look into plasmas. I always watch this set straight on from my bed.Plays nicely with peripherals like a Blu-ray player. The fact that you need to purchase a separate Samsung USB adapter to access Netflix and other apps is really annoying, but I'm guessing this issue is gone in most 2011 models where wifi is already built in (this is a 2010 model).Terrific for sports and movies and HD cable feeds.

Samsung, after not being able to replace the panel, decided to upgrade me to a newer LN40C650. I was initially very pleased with the picture and smoothness of video which seemed to be better than the previous model's.While putting it through its paces, I noticed intermittent 2-3 second audio drop outs while playing Bluray discs. I was told by Samsung to update the firmware of both my TV and BD player to see if that would alleviate the problem.I first updated the TV since my BD (LG BD-390) player was working perfectly with the LN40B650. This did nothing for the sound issue. The sound issue was ultimately resolved by updating the BD player.When putting the BD player and LN40C650 through further testing, I started noticing that I was getting intermittent blinking in the video now. The video does not go black during these occurrences. It is more of a flicker as if a frame is being dropped.The LN40C650 came with firmware version 1032 and was updated to version 1035. The flickering is not severe but does become annoying after a while. I had a Samsung repair tech come out and he replaced the main board (version 1027) in hopes of eliminating the 1035 firmware update and rolling back the TV to a previous firmware version. I am still having the flicker or blink which leads me to believe the update must have changed more than the main board on the TV.Before calling the repair tech, I had swapped out HDMI cables and hooked up other BD players (PS3) to rule them out as the culprits. It seems that once you update your TV using Samsungs firmware, it causes more problems than it solves. I think I'm done with Samsung products for now unless they can come up with adequate firmware that will resolve this video skipping issue. Even the repair tech noticed the skipping after replacing the main board. His recommendation was to turn off Auto-motion Plus. I tried this. When I did the video quality only worsened. The video playback actually began to stutter with Auto-motion Plus off. It's as if you're watching the Bluray with a strobe effect.I finally tried to reset everything through the Plug and Play feature with no success. Just for grins and giggles, I set the TV to Store Demo mode to see what would happen. In this mode, the bottom of the screen displays all the features of the TV as part of the advertisement. One of the features showed that my TV had Clear Motion 240, 60hz X 4 = 240 for a clearer image. The LN40C650 is supposed to be a 60hz TV with 120hz Auto-motion Plus. I'm now scratching my head wondering if I have a 240hz or 120hz TV? I am wondering if the main board on the TV actually matches my panel or if the 1035 firmware update hosed my TV into thinking it is a 240hz TV. When I called back the repair tech to inform him of this, he was totally stumped. He said he would look into it and call me back. I am still waiting for his call. So far I'm very disappointed with Samsung products, although the assistance I've received was excellent via MVP Electronics.

It is TRUE! The 4 corners of the screen have pretty disruptive light bleed and it is very distracting and can take you \"out\" of the movie or show you are viewing. BUT PEOPLE...I have realized after 6 months of viewing that the light bleed DISSIPATES over time! I can barely notice it now but an equally annoying defect has arisen, the TV TURNS OFF sporadically after 10 MINUTES! I have read quite a few reviews about Samsung and their power issues and now believe them 100%! But what I don't believe is the horrible customer service everyone talks about in their reviews because Samsung has been easy to contact as of today. I made a claim online, went through their trouble shooter and they'll be here within 5 days and have called me multiple times to set it up as I was at work and couldn't answer. I will update this review when I have it serviced.Yes, the apps are slow, glitchy and I needed to go online on my PC to find out how to get the Facebook app to let me login (you'll see what I mean when you get the TV/app). Luckily the NETFLIX app works relatively smooth and that's the major reason I wanted a SMART TV although yes, you do have to purchase theSamsung WIS09ABGN LinkStick Wireless LAN Adapter ($60) separately.(READ UPDATE#2 BELOW!!!) Ok, now that I got all that bad stuff out of the way, the TV is extremely clear (yes, you must tinker with the settings but that's why they're there!), aesthetically it looks awesome (style points!) and set up is way easy (so much lighter than my brothers plasma!). I've read where Plasma TV's have about a 200 hour break in period before the quality is where it should be and it got me to wonder if that is also the approximate break in period for this TV and others since that's about how much viewing time I put in when I started to notice the light bleed through started to vanish.So there you have it and I will update this review after I get the TV serviced.I bought this TV New off AMAZON.com through VANN'S for $897 and the Samsung WIS09ABGN LinkStick Wireless LAN Adapter through AMAZON for another $60.UPDATE: Samsung techs actually called me and asked if they could come earlier as their last appointment never answered which was fine with me (was my day off). It literally took the two of them about ten total minutes to unscrew back panel, remove & replace faulty power board/unit, put it back together and test it out! I asked one of them if this was a common problem with this model/line of Samsung TV's to which he kind of just smiled and shrugged his shoulders. Nice techs, great customer service from call center to techs. TV hasn't had any issues for a over a week now.UPDATE#2: Well, I was wrong. The bleed through is still very present at times and I may have just gotten use to it unconsciously.

The picture quality is awesome, local and internet streaming work perfectly, and I was extremely satisfied with this unit, until...About a week after my 1 year warranty expired, I began to have problems with the ethernet adapter on the tv. I called Samsung to see what troubleshooting steps I could take to resolve my issue. The problem was that no matter what cable I used or what port on the router was used, the tv could not connect to my network. (Keep in mind that I am a network technician and understand how networks work, and knew exactly what the problem was.) After relaying that same information to multiple agents when calling Samsung, every time I called they wanted me to go through the same troubleshooting steps. I informed them that the problem was with the ethernet adapter on the television. When the tv was plugged in, the router light would never come on, and it would never get an IP address from my router. To test this, I plugged in a laptop using that same cable, and it immediately worked without any problems. So I knew that the ethernet port was the problem and not my router (which I have two routers, and tried both of them).So, after speaking with multiple reps at Samsung, I finally spoke to an agent who I believed was going to help me. Myself and the agent went through the same troubleshooting steps, but still unable to resolve the issue. So he asked if I had registered my product to be eligible to have my warranty extended for 3 months. I told him that I had registered, and he looked up that information successfully. I even received an email stating that my warranty had been extended for three months. The agent then proceeded to get a work order so that a technician would contact me to setup service. At this point, I am under the impression that I will be covered under the extended 3-months. (To make a long story short) I received a call from the Samsung technician in my area, and stated that Samsung did not inform him that my tv was under warranty and stated that Samsung would have to send documentation that it is still under warranty. So I contacted Samsung, once again, and I was told that since the unit was out of the first year warranty, I would not be able to have my tv repaired, and that I would be responsible for the service if I decided to have it serviced. I even forwarded the email that I received about my extended 3 months of warranty to the Samsung rep, and was told that they could not honor that warranty, and I would be responsible for the service.I am not here to bash Samsung for the way I was treated.

When I described the problem to them, and based on my research thought it needed to be replaced, they ordered the new panel on my say-so and came out to replace. This panel is perfect and now to the actual picture...It's beautiful! I sometimes sit off at an angle (due to a full sofa) and it loses almost nothing. We used to have a hard time hearing movie dialogue, no matter what we tried, but the regular sound on this is great for us (we still use a stereo for movies sometimes, just to hear the music and sound effects better). The blu-ray makes our regular dvds look like blu-rays, how do they do that?  I have to say again how really perfect the picture is. We don't watch more tv, but we do enjoy it more, esp. nature stuff,and movies.Even though we had to have the panel replaced, the customer service was so easy to work with, that it kind of became a plus. I don't know what the future will hold in terms of reliability, but some credit cards will double the manufacturer's warranty, so look into that before you buy, or get an add-on warranty.", "Date": "February 22, 2011"}, {"Title": "GREAT!!!

This 40-inch TV offers several \"bells and whistles\" such as Wifi, PC and Internet connectivity, that I have not accessed.  Based on Internet research, I am confident that these functions work as advertised.  As to price, Amazon repriced the Samsung after I had purchased it, and credited the difference to me.

The first unit installed easily, works perfectly,has easy to use features and provides a great picture.  The second unit failed to connect to the internet despite my familiarity with the device.  Calling the 800 number resulted in the rep telling me that they don't provide service or installation support over the phone, and I should log onto Samsung.com, which I did.  There, a rep told me that if the TV picture worked (which it did), obviously the internet also should work and he therefore could offer no advice or help. He also refused to try to find someone else who might know more about the device than he did.  So I called the 800 number again, related all of the prior information and was told that Samsung employees were not well trained on the internet side of the device.  Whether or not my device had a minor problem, or I was doing something wrong, I'll never know.  When a company sends you from one place to another and then admits they aren't well versed in the device, that's when it's time to send it back!

I expected a more feature packed set but this one is basic and only has the wifi to set it apart from the mundane. I am most disappointed with the lack of screen modes. It only has 4:3, 16:9 and screen fit. The zooms are missing and it ends up with some shows not fillin the screen. When my notebook is connected to the net the image only fills half the screen.
