We have an Apple Smart TV, and can always consider upgrades to this (developing and fairly inexpensive) technology. Our Sony dvd player handles our streaming needs quite well; so, otherwise what we wanted was a quality TV with a beautiful picture, as well as enough inputs/outputs to give us flexibility with our needs.This Toshiba (32L1350U) is truly a beautiful set - especially for the price! (I went ahead and took Amazon's credit card and received the $50 gift certificate - so that came off the price.) This TV has true stereo analog outputs (full size - not a single, mini-\"headphone\" jack, audio output), so you can easily go through a stereo receiver to quality speakers. Otherwise, 3 HDMI jacks (cable box, dvd player, etc.); as well as a PC port, and a USB, if you must use it as a computer monitor.It has absolutely beautiful color definition, a small frame - so a maximum viewing area, and the built-in speakers are really quite good! We were happy that we could still get full analog stereo, output capability and all the features of a current HD television.", "Date": "June 22, 2013"}, {"Title": "58\" Toshiba 240hz Led Tv", "Author": "Brent Doty", "ReviewID": "R1Q36X9CAD02LH", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This 58\" Tv is amazing, so amazing I ordered another one for my parents. I purchased my first \"flat screen\" back in 2007. It was a 42\" Toshiba that was highly recommended in Consumer Reports. I still use it today with only one issue... The battery cover on the remote falls off easily. Everything else still works perfect on it. Im a huge gamer and love to watch sports (football, nascar, hockey, xgames) and this tv worked ok, but was a little blurry. 240hz wasn't available back then. Then a few years down the road I bought a 32\" Toshiba for my bedroom. Again, no issues but I decided a few months ago that I needed to get with the times and update the 42\". So, I gave my uncle my 32\" and he loves it. I researched Tvs on here, bestbuy, new egg, sears, target, walmart, basically anyone that sells TVs. Everyone thinks Samsung is the way to go... I have no problems with Samsung, but they are overpriced. I have a ps3,a ps4, and a labtop that i hook up to my TV's hdmi. I want the best technology but minus the aps on it and the 3D on it. Which I personally believe isn't the greatest thing for your eyes. (Just my opinion) I came across this big guy... Now when I was going to purchase this, it was right around black Friday... Huge fan of ad watching... Everything that was cheap on BF was a cheap brand or not worth the wait. That's when I decided on this and don't regret one bit of it. Im not loaded or well off by any means. Im a veteran and a full time college student. I have been saving up money for a while just to afford a nice tv. For 899.00 (tax free and free shipping) You get a huge almost 60\" tv... 240hz, which is amazing on any sports, movies or fast paced show (almost looks fake cause the clearity is so real)... Now for gamers out there... This TV was rated my numerous gaming magazines as the 3rd best tv for lag response time (the other 2 were over $2,000) However Toshiba has a \"game mode\" which sets everything to the exact setting for you to achieve this quickness without sacrificing image quality. COD GHOSTS LOOKS AMAZING ON PS4!!! GTA V and Gran Turismo 6 on ps3 = AMAZING! I recommend everyone that reads this... DO YOUR RESEARCH... Make sure you know what you want before you buy... I did and don't regret it! After 3 months having it... I cant believe the difference it is compared to my 42\". Any responses with questions, I'll try and answer after this post.

Caradonna", "ReviewID": "R2CS5BI6OEH1R8", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This is a review for the 39\" version.While Samsung is likely over-rated, Toshiba is equally under-rated.  This TV puts out a great picture AND sound.  This is also one of the most efficient TV's on the market.Pro:O  Great Picture.  Although not always 120hz (it depends on the source), the picture is fantastic.  Realistic color representation.  Works great as PC display (I use mine as part of a Home Theater PC setup).  Great viewing angle.  Plenty bright even with natural sunlight coming in the room.O  No \"fancy\" frills.  Forget \"smart tvs\", let TV manufacturer do what they do best: make a TV!  You can buy a dvd player, apple tv, roku, etc that does everything a smart tv can do.  I personally let my HTPC running Windows Media Center do all the heavy lifting.O  Has all the outputs you need.  Lately alot of manufactures are cutting back on outputs, probably keep the displays as thin/light as possible.  This has output for analog audio (goes to my sennheiser wireless headphones) and optical audio (goes to my audio receiver for when I want full theater experience).O  Built in speakers are quite capable.  A worthy sound for a thin tv!O  AWESOME energy efficiency.  Energy star rates this as 49.6Watts, but my killawatt measures it at 36.9Watts.  The Energy Star Sticker estimates $10 per year in power costs, far below the average for comparable sized screens.  And given my measurements, Energy star is overestimating the consumption.O  Clean design, uncomplicated user interface!O  Price is terrific!  This performs as well as much more expensive Samsung models which paying the unnecessary premium.  Toshiba makes great sets and has great reputation for superb engineering in Japan.  I will point out that Samsung is not nearly as popular a brand in Japan, which reinforces my belief that perception about brand and quality is very relative.Cons:O  Base is a bit wobbly for my tastes, but is adequate given the light weight of the TV itself.  I only notice when I turn the TV to face a different room.  (Which I do frequently, and it has been no problem whatsoever)O  Other reviewers have mentioned the low sensitivity of the remote.  I admit it's a bit weak, but it's not so hard to aim it at the TV.  Really the only time I need it is to turn on/off or change volume.  These days most viewing control is done thru media devices anyway (my HTPC in my case), so I'm not bothered, and I suspect neither will most people.  (Who doesn't have a media player of some type these days?  Tivo, Cable box, Roku, DVD player, etc...)O  I wish the TV would auto-power down faster after not detecting a signal, or allow the user to customize this.  I think it takes about 20 minutes.Overall, I am very happy with this TV!  I would absolutely purchase again and recommend this TV.  5 starsPlease feel free to leave a comment/question as I'm happy to reply.Update 4/5/2014:Still very happy with this TV.  Just wanted to add that the TV and the stand stood up very nicely to all the earthquakes we've been having.", "Date": "October 23, 2013"}, {"Title": "AWFUL Customer Service Experience", "Author": "Brandon2063", "ReviewID": "RBZ7OMRLPTJGN", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I purchased two of the 29L1350U LCD monitors to use as in a CCTV application.  Within a few months of installation each of the units displayed instances of random power cycling (the monitors will power off and back on during use).  An internet search of this phenomenon indicates that my monitors are not unique in this behavior.One unit has only performed this random power cycle on three occasions over six months (and though annoying, this will seem acceptable as you read on).  The second TV, however, is unusable, as it power cycles four or more times per hour - in some instances requiring unplugging for several minutes before it will resume function.The defective unit is less than six months old, so after contacting their customer service, I sent it to a Toshiba authorized repair depot.  I was responsible for shipping, which is frustrating, but acceptable.  The unit was allegedly \"repaired\" (a new motherboard was installed) but upon its return it exhibited the same behavior IMMEDIATELY after being reconnected to a power supply.  I was told to send the unit for a second round of service (again at my shipping expense) and that if the unit could not be repaired \"other options\" would be explored.  I have received it back from this second repair and it still does not work. I have spoken to customer service, warranty service , and customer relations personnel, including several \"managers.\" I am told that there is no option to have a replacement TV issued, only to resubmit to the same repair depot, AT MY COST.  The \"other options\" are that they will request that a senior technician inspect the TV (implying that the lower level technician should not have been trusted to complete a successful diagnostic and repair?).If I am to submit the set again, I will have spent $75 on shipping to repair an ongoing problem for a $190 TV.  This experience has taught me that a Toshiba warranty is not worth the paper it is written on.  I intend to file a complaint with my local bureau of consumer protection / the Better Business Bureau, as well as post as many online warnings to would-be-customers as I possibly can.  I used to look at Toshiba as a trusted brand name and a reputable company.  I understand that any manufacturer can have problems with products.  A reputable company cannot guarantee that all of its equipment will be without defect, only that they will help to restore the consumer who was burdened with a defective item.  The issue is not the faulty TV.  The issue is the horrendous run-around that I am being put through in my attempts to resolve the issue.  This is the last Toshiba item that I will ever purchase, PERIOD.", "Date": "March 20, 2014"}, {"Title": "Great gaming tv!!", "Author": "exodus", "ReviewID": "RNNNYJJWC3A11", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I use this tv for gaming 99.9% percent of the time ,and It handles gaming wonderfully.  it took me about two weeks to calibrate a picture that i was very happy with ,but once i did games look great on it. Now let's get down to the most important part of what makes a tv good for gaming tv: the input lag all HDtvs suffer from it to some extent some a lot worse than others ,but this one has no noticeable lag according to a certain website the 39\" version of this tv clocked in around 30ms which is considered great for gaming.  So if you play competitivly online like i do your not put at a disadvantage. especially with fighting games and first person shooters. My only knock against this tv is that it has a slight vertical banding issue only noticable when the screen is one mostly one color. But i am happy to say that this tv has a pretty uniformed screen ,and does not suffer from flashlighting which is another common led tv issue. I paid around six hundred and fifty dollars for this tv and so far very happy with my purchase.", "Date": "July 28, 2013"}, {"Title": "For the price it is ok", "Author": "daedelus7", "ReviewID": "R7Q7COUTC52J3", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "I got this on sale at Best Buy for $350 and for the price I don't think you can really get much better picture in \"120hz\" and 39\". I'll compare build and functionality to my last TV a 2009 samsung 22\"LCD.Cons:-So here is a dirty secret I discovered. The \"clearscan\" 120Hz prominently printed on the box doesn't exist in my settings. So i'm not sure if it is really doing 120 or just 60. Yes, I know what i'm doing, I even downloaded the manual and it has directions directly referring to this exact model, go to advanced picture settings and toggle on/off cinema mode. Regardless of picture mode it's greyed out. A quick google search revealed others with the same problem. I might contact customer service to see what they say and I'll update if I get to it. But from what i've read 120vs60 is not a big deal. The difference between \"game mode\", supposedly reducing input lag is marginal compared to the other modes but I think it is better than say cinema for games. The refresh rate seems improved at least on \"game mode\" compared to my old Samsung and it works well for games and movies my main uses. Saving some money and going to 60hz is something that you might consider. I think my final conclusion is we are getting improved refresh rate from 60hz but it is hard to notice. You don't get the \"soap opera\" effect like with my parents 240hz Panasonic. Where if you put it on high processing it looks really high frame rate.-The remote is very cheaply made compared to my old remote from 2009. You have to go out of your way to aim directly at the IR port. Kinda surprising you could mess up a remote in 2013. Samsung remote works normal point it in the direction of the TV and it works. I think some of the unresponsiveness has to do with the tv taking 3-4 seconds between when you hit power on the remote and turning on.-The stand is very poorly engineered. My model is ever so slightly tipping to the left after installing it correctly and pushing on the tv causes it to wobble around WITH the TV screwed into the stand. I plan to put it on a wall mount so that should solve that problem. Wishing they just copied samsung's no tools or screws required foolproof stand.-I had to exchange the first TV I got because there was a dead pixel. Second TV was fine. The first TV's stand was fine, in terms of being level, albeit wobbly. This dead pixel out of the box on the first TV kind of makes me worry about how long the TV will last. My Samsung from 2009 is still trucking with a little brightness discoloration spots.-Menu user interface is slightly worse/funky compared to my old tv.Pros:-At around $200 cheaper than the comparable Samsung model i'm willing to put up with the Cons to avoid the samsung brand tax.-The picture is all around better than my 2009 TV as you would hope. Only problem is the blacks are really black and I found myself boosting up the gamma +4 out of a max +5 because it was just too dark, abnormally so if you ask me.-3 HDMI ports. Many TVs this size only have 2. I'm going to plug consoles into all of them. Generally lots of output options Samsung seems to just leave off this size of TV bizarrely these days. I would like to plug my TV into speakers thanks.-The TV barely is warm on top after extensive use indicating how much energy the LED technology saves.-The sound is about as good as my Samsung from 2009 probably marginally better and louder.So in the end I think it is a good deal. I'm happy gaming and netflixing on it so far and I'm willing to deal with some quirks for the price.UPDATE 10/15/2013:Support interaction information: Spoke to Jerry, reference number 131007-004922.I called Toshiba customer service to find out two things. How do I upgrade the firmware for the TV. And why is cinema mode greyed out and \"off\" in the menu, when the manual says that I can turn it on. After 30 minutes the CSR told me they needed to have a tier 2 person call me back and there is no firmware update. Problem is, on their own website when I enter the model number on the support page at support.toshiba.com it shows there IS a firmware update. I was told I would get a call back the next day and haven't heard from them 2 weeks later.  So based on my interactions I would say avoid a Toshiba TV because they have poor customer service in the support department. I certainly got the run around when I tried to ask why advertised features were not working.UPDATE 10/17/2013:I was able to update the firmware from some help from another reviewer in the comments of this review. I am now running 1.08 firmware and there has been no change in menu options.", "Date": "August 20, 2013"}, {"Title": "Nice bang for the buck", "Author": "moose_of_many_waters", "ReviewID": "R11TAKBB2E3I8G", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I picked this up for less than 200 bucks on sale.  I'm not much of a TV watcher and I don't even have cable TV.  I just watch PBS and special yearly events like the Oscars and the Rose Parade off my antenna.  Mostly I watch movies off my Blu-Ray player.  This TV was bought to replace my old 26\" LCD Panasonic Viera (about six years old).  The picture quality of this LED TV is definitely superior to what I had and it's nice that I get 31.5\" inches of screen in the same space of my bookcase that used to hold my 26\" TV.  Sound quality is solid, and the digital tuner is also superior to the old one on my Panasonic (I'm getting clear reception on channels that used to be sketchy).  The one thing that is inferior is the time lag in changing channels; it's a bit longer with this TV, but nothing ridiculous in terms of a wait.  This unit also has a glossy screen, and personally I prefer matte screens.  My TV isn't near a window,  so any glare is minor, but if you plan to watch this TV during the day and your house gets lots of light, you might prefer a different model.The remote is fairly intuitive.  The only complaint I have is that this unit didn't come with a hard copy manual.  I had to download one off the internet.  That's being a little too cheap in my opinion.

I thought I had 30 days to return the tv, but Best Buy recently changed their policy and only gave 14 days, so . . . I called Toshiba to activate the warranty. First they said the model number from the back of the tv did not exist. I had to take a picture of it and email it to Toshiba--the makers of the tv--to prove I was giving them the right model number. Okay, no problem. They tell me the tv is covered, call tech support. I call tech support. They try to walk me through all these steps to \"fix\" the picture when it is clearly a screen defect. I've invested about 45 minutes of my life, but okay this must be protocol. They finally say that the tv will need to be taken to a repair facility and fixed under warranty. They give the name and number of a place. The place never answers the phone. I finally get through to the repair place after days of trying and the guy tells me Toshiba should have given me an authorization number. Well, they didn't. Call back tech support. They have no idea what I am talking about. Finally, after being on hold the guy comes back and says, oh yes here is your authorization number. I call back the repair place a few times, finally get them on the line, and the guy tells me to bring the tv in at 4pm. I wait an hour in front of his shop before the repair guy shows up. Beyond frustrated at this point, but at any rate, I leave the tv. Next day the repair guy calls me and says that Toshiba will not cover cost of repairing the tv, they say the screen was damaged by someone hitting it? Yes, I make a habit of smacking around my flat screens. If that wasn't bad enough, this tv is advertised as 120hz, but on the back of the tv it says 60hz. So disgusted with Toshiba.

I wanted a TV primarily for my gaming room, which would be responsible for displaying sporting events, a computer monitor, and an Xbox 360 and a PS4.  The reason I picked this TV was the input lag, a feature not often talked about..  The input lag database clocks this TV at 27ms.  That's really low, and lower is better.  So if you're looking for a gaming TV, you're going to want something like this, and for the money, you're not going to find a better TV this size at a lower price.There are a few things I feel could be improved.  Namely, I wish you could create custom names for the inputs.  Instead, you can leave them as \"HDMI 1\" \"HDMI 2\" or you can pick from a provided list.  But without custom names, instead of \"Verizon FIOS\" \"360\" and \"PS4\" I end up with \"Cable TV\" \"Game\" \"Game\".  Not a huge deal, but my livingroom TV lets me do this and its a small feature I miss.Also, in the bottom-right you'll find a green circle that lights up when the TV is on.  You can push that circle and naturally I thought it was the power button.  It didn't work, and I was able to turn the TV on and off with the remote.  It turns out, that isn't the power button.  The power button is located behind the TV on the left-hand side, along with the channel, volume, and input buttons.  It's just sort of hidden away back there.The stand is a bit boring and there is nothing to make the TV itself stand out aside from the stellar display.  Also, I didn't notice it in the pictures, but there is a gap between the bottom stand and the TV where it's a silver metal instead of the black plastic, which does look a tad bit odd.The display itself is exactly what I wanted.  Sharp images, good blacks, nice contrast.  Viewing angle is okay, and picture isn't too glossy so the brightness of the room isn't critical.  Perfect for gaming, great for sports, and good for movies.  5 out of 5 stars, I'd buy this again.", "Date": "January 20, 2014"}, {"Title": "The right choice", "Author": "Douglas E Businger", "ReviewID": "RNUON3K2VFRB4", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Fairly impressed actually.

The colors are calibrated at the factory and it worked great right out of the box. Its the most bang for the buck, I could find. I am only disappointed about one thing....the base base the tv kinda wobbly,and unstable, but the toshiba use the same base for all their tv's up to 50 inch models. I opted to wall mount it with the Cheetah mounts lcd wall mount bracket, so that took care of that problem! Also the viewing of the picture off side is very good, so you dont have to sit only in front of it to view a great picture. So glad I bought a led tv vs.a lcd, lcd was the forerunner, but with lcd, theres a bulb that periodically needs replacing, its what makes the picture since the display is liquid, its backlit, a bulb costs about $200.00, but with a led tv, theres no backlighiting, its a series of light emitting diodes (led), which should make it more dependable and definately gives the tv its brighter more accurate picture, blacks are pure, whites are clean, gold looks gold and silver is silver.

I wasn't interested in a smart TV, so this Toshiba 50L1350U 50-Inch 1080p 120Hz LED HDTV fit perfectly.The clarity is excellent, with great colors.  Even darker scenes show up clearly.  The Blue-ray DVD's we watched on it were incredibly sharp.  The sound is decent, but not fabulous.  I am somewhat disappointed with the remote.  My couch sits about 12 to 15 feet from the TV.  If I'm sitting on the left side of the screen, the TV does not register the remote.  I have to move to the right until I'm directly in front of the sensor in order for it to register.  Since I primarily watch Netflix through my Blue-ray player, this doesn't really matter until I have to adjust the volume.  I may just look into getting a universal remote to see if that doesn't fix my problem.The stand it comes with is flimsy.  Actually, I think it's the entire setup.  I don't recommend leaving it on the stand for long.  It's not solid.  I wish the TV had one additional set of component video hookups, since the kids still play the older gaming consoles, but they don't complain too much about having to swap out the cables.All-in-all this is a great TV for the price, though I've only had it for a month.  Even after reading the overwhelmingly positive reviews, I was skeptical.  But I have to say I am satisfied.  And that's saying quite a bit since I held off buying a TV for 6 months, waiting for the right TV with the right price to come along.", "Date": "September 12, 2013"}, {"Title": "Good Price for 29in TV - one dead pixel.", "Author": "---->Sam<----", "ReviewID": "R37DN0PO49J1BO", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I did some research before buying this tv and strangely nothing online has the specification for its native resolution or the max resolution of this tv...even on toshiba website it only says this tv is 720p. After i setup my tv to my pc, i found the actual resolution of this tv 1360x768 if you're looking for the specific resolution here you go.As for the TV, $180 price is a very good deal usually only no-name brands offers this price point at this size. I found one dead pixel after setting it up, since it is price cut of $120 and dead pixel is at the corner I'm probably just going to stick with it.Video Quality is fine but my laptop is 1366x768 so switching resolution is a bit annoying.Sound Quality is not bad in my opinion but this is my first(my last TV, a 32in Sceptre only lasted 3 HOURS) tv for my room, so anything its give or take.3 HDMI is nice because LG and Samsung TVs only have 2 HDMI.So far it is working well, hopefully it will last long.Edit 1Connecting to pc issuesSince this tv has a odd resolution of 1360x768, setting the right resolution in your pic settings is very important. My laptop has native 1366x768, part of my screen was cut off due to the extra 6 pixels not being able to display. After setting the right resolution the tv looked crisp and HD from a distance dispite the result ion is a bit lowered.As for the lag issue I've seen people mention, I have no problem playing battlefield 3 on this tv from my laptop. The HDMI cable I have is only $3 I bought from amazon. It is important to turn Vsync on in game setting so the computer will match the 60hz refresh rate with 60fps.Games that I play with this tv:Battlefield 3League of LegendsLeft 4 Dead 2Killing FloorAll have no screen lag problem at 60fps Vsync on.", "Date": "September 2, 2013"}, {"Title": "GREAT", "Author": "Amazon Customer", "ReviewID": "R3I4RDG9U5ZP89", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "The purchase was as advertised.

Only thing is that if the bass and treble are set too high the speakers vibrate which is to be expected (everything has a limit) but it's a little depressing. I plan to get a wireless soundbar at some point in the future, but for tv speakers, they are pretty powerful. Volume at 20 and it's blaring so that's great.

Excellent value for a near 60 in. HDTV!", "Author": "TheNotoriousMAZ", "ReviewID": "R3VISY15149F5Z", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Considering I already had a multitude of \"smart devices\" such as my Xbox and Chromecast to access Netflix, internet etc, I had no need for a smart TV. Having a big screen was a priority, and I wanted at least 120 Hz. The \"dumb TV\" market is certainly dwindling, but it makes sense to save a few bucks and forego the smart features if you can already get them elsewhere.My shopping search brought me to this model Toshiba, and a 60 in. Samsung (UN60FH6003F), both which could be had for less than $1000. I was able to see both models in person; the Toshiba at Paul's TV, and the Samsung at Costco. Both were close in terms of performance, but the 240 Hz and quicker response time for gaming won me over for the Toshiba.After optimizing the screen settings over the past couple weeks, the picture quality now astonishes me everyday. Blacks are deep and colors pop without being too saturated. The only thing I negative thing I can say about picture quality (and deducted a star for in this review) is that there is some backlight bleed in the bottom left corner when the screen is completely dark. This only happens late at night when the TV is the only thing illuminating the room. Otherwise it is unnoticeable.The sound from the built-in speakers is nothing to write home about, but that seems to be the case with most flatscreens. I have a 5.1 system, and pairing that sound quality with this great screen brings a top-notch entertainment experience. If you do not have a sound system, I would highly recommend getting a sound bar at the very least.I was a bit wary when I bought this TV because there were so few first-hand reviews out for it. Some reviews mentioned that the TV stopped working after a few weeks, or even arrived completely dead. That was not the case for me, and I will knock on wood for good longevity. I consider myself lucky finding this Toshiba for only $799 at Sears, and can say with confidence that it is an excellent bargain. If you are searching for great picture quality in a big screen without the added bloat of smart software, look no further. I can recommend this unit with confidence.***This is a copy of my review from Sears, where I purchased this TV.

It was easy to unpack and plug in all the cables.  I did not expect the quality of the picture to be so high; it is real HD and is crisp, bright, and runs cool.  As a monitor, it is nice having the extra desktop space to work on multiple projects.  As a TV, the picture is really gorgeous.  Fallout 3 (2008) looks very good and is definitely more immersive on a wider screen, but I have not hooked up my Nintendo 64 to check the quality.The initial monitor set-up is a little difficult as there are many options.  Correcting the PC input viewable area (without having those black bars on the sides) was the hardest part, but there are many websites which explain how to adjust the picture size while keeping the font readable.I do have a problem with the speakers.  Any volume setting over a \"10\" creates bass reverb; not horrible, but noticeable even after turning the bass all the way down.  As this device is primarily a PC monitor, I sit close and keep the volume at a \"4\" or a \"5\".  I can see the sound being an issue if this device is used as a TV and viewers are sitting at a distance.

I would think anything larger than a 32\" TV would be over kill.  The TV was very easy to assemble and set up.  The picture and sound is everything that all professional reviews say.  In addition, it was very easy to route the sound through my stereo with RCA cords when I wish theater quality sound.  It is also easy to watch shows streaming off my computer and Kindle with simply plugging in HDMI cords from my TV to computer/Kindle.", "Date": "February 8, 2014"}, {"Title": "I LOVE THIS TELEVISION", "Author": "Rozaroni", "ReviewID": "R3MZ9KTQWAJZ9A", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Easy to set up, 1080p HD, 3 HDMI ports, great color, great sound.

Cheap remote control, so I swapped the much nicer one that came with my 20 inch years ago.", "Date": "January 7, 2014"}, {"Title": "Excellent TV for the money!", "Author": "sslami \"sslamster\"", "ReviewID": "RSJSVZKT4APEG", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I initially had a 37\" 720p Toshiba LCD, which I replaced with a 42\" 1080p Toshiba LCD, which was then replaced by this 50\" Toshiba 1080p LED TV.  I still have the 37\" and 42\", they both still work great; they have just been redeployed to the bedrooms.Because I have had such good luck with Toshiba TV's in the past, I decided to continue with the Toshiba brand for my new 50\" TV and I have not been disappointed.  The funny thing is that one of my wants in a new TV was to have RCA audio outputs as I have an old Sony SA-VA analog audio system, and Toshiba was one of the few that still had analog audio outputs in their TV's.I use this set as my main TV and I am very happy with it.  It has 3 HDMI inputs (my 42\" set had 4 HDMI inputs) and I have connected to it my cable STB/DVR, Xbox one, and Toshiba HD-DVD player.  My Xbox one has a built in blu-ray player so I was able to eliminate the need for my PS3.Aesthetically, I really like this TV.  The bezel is much thinner than my old set but not quite as thin as some of the new LED's out right now.  However, this TV is also much less expensive than some of the other newer LED sets.  The base is sort of flimsy and I was worried that, based on previous reviews, the TV would \"droop\" or wobble in response to vibration or someone walking near the TV.  Fortunately, that has not been the case.  Despite the fact that the base could be sturdier, it sits even on my TV stand and does not wobble.  The TV base unfortunately does not swivel like the 42\" set I had, but the wide viewing angle makes up for that.Inputs and outputs are perfect for me.  I needed at least 3 HDMI inputs because I don't have an audio receiver.  My audio system is old and analog, but still works great.  Switching between inputs is very fast, much faster than either of my older Toshiba LCD's.  The menu is also a bit more user friendly.  There are plenty of options for customizing the picture and audio quality.  The built in speakers are surprisingly good.When you feed a high quality source into this TV the results are exceptional.  For example, when I use my Xbox one for gaming or Netflix, the picture is (in my opinion) exceptional.  The same holds true when watching HD-DVD's or DVD's via my HD-DVD player.  When viewing the cable set top box, the quality of picture really depends on the channel.  Some channels are better than others, despite the fact that they are all supposed to be HD channels.  I don't think that this TV does much in terms of video manipulation, so the better the source the better the picture.  However, many of my cable channels through the set top box do look fantastic.  Again, not the fault of the TV.  Coming from an LCD TV, the colors and blacks are more vibrant on this TV.  Not sure if it's due to the LED technology or just the fact that this is a brand new TV.Overall, I am really impressed with this TV.  I was kind of worried that the quality wouldn't be as good as my 42\" Regza LCD based on previous reviews, but I have been pleasantly surprised.  The picture is fantastic, the audio is very good, and the looks are amazing.  I spent quite a bit of time calibrating my 42\" and 37\" Toshiba LCD's with DV Essentials on HD-DVD.  I really didn't need to even do that with this set as it looks pretty good right out of the box.  It is also significantly lighter than my 42\" LCD.  I highly recommend this TV!As always, Amazon was awesome with super fast shipping and delivery.

On images that have no business being grainy, that is all you see. For the price, you get what you pay for:The VGA resolution is severely limited.There are no dedicated Input buttons, just a scrolling menu.When playing media, it will always jump to no signal and display the input label for 10 seconds whenever stopping or starting anything.The enhanced imaging features will create MPEG like artifacts on the most pristine HD content. No other TV I have owned has ever created such garbage from such content.I was very pumped to get this TV, and every step of the way it was truly disappointing.Needless to say, I have returned it and spent $250 more on a Sony Bravia loaded with smart features I don't need - and the panel is BEYOND superior.I was shocked to see what praise it has received in any review I have read, and I am confused as to what people are referencing when looking at this, because it is not good at any price.", "Date": "June 20, 2013"}, {"Title": "Picture is great!", "Author": "Suicune", "ReviewID": "R2YN8GUJN0J0YU", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I just got my tv yesterday and set everything up.

They rattle with bassy sounds when the device volume is pretty low.I did purchase external speakers- I bought this thing with the intent of getting external speakers any way since it had that capability. But I have to turn the volume on the t.v. off, get up, turn on the speakers & manually adjust accordingly.Which, in this time of the \"I want it now\" instant gratification attitude, it can be pretty obnoxious. But typing it now, I'm annoyedwith myself for complaining about it soo yeah. hahaPicture is great, but I'm not really all that picky.

After reading some reviews, I decided on this trying this one due to how great I thought the Toshiba Laptop looked--a LED to see what the picture quality was like although I had always seen better reviews for plasma. Besides, if it wasn't so great, I could always place it in the guest bedroom where the distance isn't really that close and that's exactly where it will go as soon as I receive the updated plasma set.  The reviews said anything around a 50,000 contrast ratio was considered good but that hasn't proved to be true. Closeup, the picture look like it's raining with streaks all down the picture. The black level is like a jigsaw puzzle either closeup or at distance although it's a slight more tolerable at a distance not good but it blends a bit better. While watching football games, there is way too much ghosting and the players/action is always a blurry and out of focus, especially up close or from a side view...the best picture is straight on at a distance.  The picture size and mode options are nice but the picture will zoom in (to get rid of the black marks across the top and bottom of the screen) and part of the picture is off the screen so they don't work very well.

Do like that it has the PC input.Things not so great is the PC input only seems to only allow 1366x768 maximum resolution although native resolution of the TV is 1920x1080.Brighter colors seem to get washed out when viewed at an angle.Using the built in tuner, the picture tends to look fuzzy and reminiscent of watching a CRT. Vizio TV (which it replaced) seemed to pull stations in much cleaner and present a sharp picture. I can't seem to do much of anything to improve the picture or reception on the Toshiba.I'm also baffled by the claim of 120hz 'clear picture'. Think I actually notice more blurring/ghosting on this TV than the Vizio.The remote is probably the worst that I've come across in a long time. If it's not pointed directly at the IR receiver on the TV, it doesn't seem to want to work.Lastly, the build quality seems a bit loose and the stand was crooked.

When I returned, I noted that the bottom of the box was in pretty beat-up shape and the inside styrofoam packaging was broken apart.  I actually had to tape the bottom to keep the TV from falling out.  On December 7, 2013, my audio/visual technician unpacked the TV and informed me that it was apparent that the TV had been repackaged.  That concerned me since my purchase was for a \"NEW\" TV.  In any event, he installed the wall mounting bracket and TV.  When the TV was turned on, we noticed a defect in the picture, an internal smear mark across the resolution of the picture.  I immediately called Paul's TV and was not impressed with the customer service representative although he did follow-through and I received a call back within 48 hours to arrange for a replacement.  I had to incur the expense of removing the TV from the mount and then having it remounted ($90 each service call = $180).  Paul's TV refused to reimburse this amount.  I even offered to take it in Paul's TV credits and they refused.  I even offered to split the cost with them and they refused.  Considering that they represented that the TV was NEW, it evidently was not.  I did not get what I bargained for and the added cost of $180 for their false representation made this a bad deal.  I could have gotten this TV locally and even with the sales tax, it would have still been a savings.  Needless to say, I was disappointed at Paul's TV's lack of good will for advertising a NEW TV and shipping me a repackaged TV.  The replacement TV arrived on December 18, 2013 (27 days after my original purchase) and it works great so I recommend the TV but not the Seller.  Buyers beware.  Although my first experience with Paul's TV was positive and brought me back for another purchase.  After this recent purchase, I will never buy or recommend Paul's TV ever again.", "Date": "December 26, 2013"}, {"Title": "Bought 39 inch, Failed to work with my Wii U", "Author": "neonatal1", "ReviewID": "R21G575M94EWMU", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "Can not play my Wii U on this tv , May be due to refresh Frequency issue.

So I contacted Amazon and they sent me replacement. The shipping took extra long for the replacement.AFTER they sent me the replacement, the company JB HUNT took the broken TV back. After 30 days I got a notice from Amazon saying that they did not receive the TV back and they were going to charge my credit card again. I followed AMAZON's instructions and they are wanting to charge me AGAIN. I will never buy a TV from AMAZON again!!!!! I would not suggest anyone to buy one from them!

I have never been happy with the picture, but 2 days ago, the sound would not work through the HDMI hooked up to an AV receiver.

They claim it's the signal from the satellite not the TV.  I know this is not the case because the other TV works and I also receive no sound from my Roku or the DVD player.  When I told them I was sure it was the TV, the service rep. got huffy with me.  I told him I wanted to speak to a supervisor and he got even more indignant and would not connect me.  I have been unable to find an email address on the website to complain.I have called a local autorized dealer and will take the TV to him for repair.

I was not able to return it because by the time I came home, three months had passed and it was too late to return it.

Gerhardt \"design engineer\"", "ReviewID": "R1D6OH9M3QCOB7", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "This was rated good and it turned out to be a piece of junk. The picture is blurry compare to my lcd Viewsonic that didn't have led. Its supposed to be 1080p and looks like 720p. Hooked up my laptop and it shows the boot up windows screen on the tv when loading then goes blue on the TV showing no signal.Techs from a foreign country couldn't figure it out. The colors remind me of an old color tv that can't be adjusted and some stations have a greenish tint or trees that are bright green when other colors are subdued. The sound is crap compared to the old viewsonic set that had dolby srs tru surround sound. Says built in subwoofer, what a joke. Don't buy this and get a Viewsonic instead. More features , easier to use and menus are much better. Toshiba! Cheap! Cheap! Cheap!UPDATE 1/3/14  I have to send the set into Tosiba because techs think its a hardware problem that fails to connect to my laptop vga cable. Windows shows booting up windows on the TV but says Auto Adjusting in blue and goes to no signal after windows boots up on the set. The remote is also junk. It always goes to 25.1 instead of 25 if you type it on the keypad or 43.1 instead of channel 43 if you type it on the keypad.Sometimes if I am using the down key on the channel arrows when it hits channel 49.1 it flashed 77 channel display and goes to channel 3.1 instead of the next channel lower which is 45. So the remote is weak and a piece of junk also because you cannot use the back button to get a numerical channel becuase it will jump to a .1 channel and you have to down arrow it again. My viewsonic set just displayed the number analog or digital as a single digit and not all the garbage this set puts on to the screen and was faster with no delay lag time like the Toshiba.", "Date": "December 20, 2013"}, {"Title": ":)", "Author": "brandon", "ReviewID": "R1QWWNYW5Q8KGF", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "it is very I am enjoying it very much and I really love it thanks a whole lot appreciate it", "Date": "June 19, 2013"}, {"Title": "29\" Model Picture Failed after 10 weeks", "Author": "T.
