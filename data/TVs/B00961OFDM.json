{"Reviews": [{"Title": "UN60ES7150F", "Author": "RSL1", "ReviewID": "R3H3WC0CWBBHGA", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I bought this tv from Costco, because it had the best picture in the store. The picture is striking! excellent! I love the narrow frame around the picture screen. The frame is less than one inch all the way around. The set has micro dimming to give a darker black and it does. The base is heavy steel with chrome and it can rotate 15 degrees. I have the motion set to clear, which seems the best to me. With the picture set the way I like it, my APC H15 power conditioner indicates the TV is drawing 1.0 amp. That is equal to 120 watts, which is really pretty good for a 60 inch set. The ECO setting is 71 watts, but to dim for my taste. The sound is good but not great. I set the equalizer up to the max, and that sounds the best to me. Ultra thin TV's don't have much room for speakers. I have not used the 3D, so no opinion on that. Have not used the smart internet or skype feature either. The TV comes with a key board and a box of active 3d glasses. Be carefull not to squeeze the screen when lifting the TV. Samsung warns that this can damage a thin screen. They show you how it should be lifted.", "Date": "December 22, 2012"}, {"Title": "Not so smart Smart TV", "Author": "AlbinBr \"albglen\"", "ReviewID": "RIJ80J9NORLMY", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I purchased this TV at Costco at the end of November 2012 mainly because I wanted to watch Internet TV channels and listen to Internet radio stations.  I could not listen to Internet radio stations because plug-ins were missing that could not be downloaded.  I could watch some Internet TV channels, but not others, because required software was missing, like Microsoft Silverlight and Adobe FlashPlayer, neither of which could be downloaded.  I played an exercise video provided by Samsung, but the TV could not play it smoothly -- it played for about 15 seconds, then stopped for buffering, then played another 15 seconds and so on. So not even videos provided by Samsung itself could be played flawlessly on the TV.  Another problem, when moving the curser across a webpage, it would open links by just passing the curser over the name of a link, without clicking on it -- a real annoyance.  I can get better Internet reception on my old Sony TV by connecting my laptop to it.  The TV's picture quality is excellent, but the sound quality is not so good -- I connected the TV to my stereo sound system to produce better sound. Anyway, because of the Internet problems I returned the TV to Costco for a full refund.", "Date": "January 3, 2013"}, {"Title": "Great television", "Author": "uwspphisig", "ReviewID": "R2C5JZYA39MN92", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This is a fantastic television. We have the 60 inch and are very happy. My wife and 3 year old watch 3-D animated movies quite a bit and LOVE the T.V. The color is great (brightness, saturation, etc.) and with a Blue-Ray disk, the picture quality is amazing...UN-believable detail. The picture is responsive and the remote has good size buttons that are easy to manipulate and move around the picture (Once you take the remote and play with it a bit...get the feel of it). The on screen menu's are easy to navigate and easy to read and understand. It's quite easy to get from 2-D TV to 3-D TV in the picture menu and back to 2-D. The 3-D is also amazing. We are using the 3-D glasses that come with it and the 3-D quality is great. Things look like they are right in the room. ALSO...I wear glasses and the standard issue glasses easily fit over my glasses, (they are smaller frame less glasses), with no added weight feel at all. The TV picture (without the 3-D on...haven't tried that yet) is viewable from the sides at quite an angle and you can still see the picture just fine. It's just a great TV and the added on screen Smart Menu items are a great added feature (Netflix, Pandora, etc.). So I hope this review helps. If you do decide to get it...you'll love it...oh yeah, still trying to find out the Samsung Galaxy Tab 2 (10.1) is  compatible or will sync with it...sorry, no review on that  :)", "Date": "March 19, 2013"}, {"Title": "Nice TV", "Author": "Dave \"davefromwash\"", "ReviewID": "R2C1VG3X6XSAM0", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Got this at Costco months ago.  It really has a nice picture and doesn't draw much power.  Our old plasma was 500w, this one is 100w.The down-firing speakers are useless.  Usually, it has the stereo hooked in for sound, but if I'm just watching morning news or something, I use the TV speakers.To make the speakers work, I took two pieces clear plexiglass (about 5\" x 10\" each).  I bent them down the middle at a 45 degree angle.  Now, when I used double-stick tape to stick the plexi to the back of the TV, the sound fires down, hits the 45 degree angle plastic, and is directed forward towards you.  You really can't see the clear plexiglass.  As there isn't an actual border around the TV, they had to put the speakers there, I guess.Anyway, I'm still happy with the TV.", "Date": "March 9, 2013"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "Unavailable", "Features": "Smart TV\nSmart Content with Signature Services\nApps built for TV\nWeb Browser & Search All\nSmart Hub", "Name": "Samsung UN60ES7150 60-Inch 1080p 240Hz 3D Slim LED HDTV", "ImgURL": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41cFbP7wrJL._SY300_.jpg", "ProductID": "B00961OFDM"}}
