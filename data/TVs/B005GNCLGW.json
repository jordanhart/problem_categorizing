It was delivered yesterday 11/28. I love prime shipping!I set the TV up connected to the internet as well as a DirecTV HD receiver. Picture quality is good. At times whites looked a little strong, but I think I can take care of that with some custom color settings. The remote has a Netflix button and a Vudu button on it. Tested Netflix and had no issues. Tested the Pandora Vudu app and it worked fine as well. Remote was not very responsive, but will not need to use it very often.I had read that iSymphony TV's are just rebadged Samsungs. I used a Samsung remote code to pair it with the DirecTV remote, so I guess that is true. Overall for $300 I think it is a great value - only time will tell.", "Date": "November 29, 2011"}, {"Title": "Not a terrible TV", "Author": "mkeiser", "ReviewID": "RTYBO569B7X5I", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "So I got this TV during the lightning sale like everyone else who has reviewed it. It has been about a week now so I feel comfortable enough give my review. While I do agree that it being shipped literally in it's original box and nothing else is kind of stupid. But other than that let's get into the review.The TV is quiet nice and considering my last TV before this was a seven year old 'HD' Box TV I can't complain. There was no damage and everything worked well. Set up was really easy and though the screws were difficult at first it all went well at the end. All the ports work though I wish there was more than one composite, one component, two HDMI, and a PC port. But again these are small complaints when I could just by a switch box.The wireless USB connector worked great with my linksys router. The netflix works great though the interface isn't as good as the console versions. Speaking of consoles I have quiet a few of them hooked in. They look good, not great mind you like some of the higher end TVs but nothing that will make you regret the purchase. Blu-rays are also quiet nice on it.The only real complaint is that the speakers aren't that great. So if you want better sound you should probably get a cheap sound system to correct that. At the 300 dollars I bought it for it's a good TV. Not the best but perfect for what I wanted. You shouldn't pay the full asking price but if it's on sale it's not the worse TV on Amazon.", "Date": "December 8, 2011"}, {"Title": "Solid Bang for Buck 40 inch Internet TV", "Author": "George P. Burdell \"The Baydestrian\"", "ReviewID": "R2S0UN0OX9V7BD", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Before I even get into the pros and cons of this TV, I'd like to note that I didn't get this set on the Lightning sale for $300. I got it when the price dropped down to $369 for 12 hours a couple days after (I still thought it was a great deal). Thus, please keep in mind my review is based on buying this 40 inch TV at a price-point of 450 dollars or less.Pros:- Screen Size: 40 inch screen for the price...enough said- Internet TV: Vudu and Netflix apps (VERY FEW TVs under $500 come with any Internet capabilities. This is arguably the primary reason I purchased this TV.)- Remote: Sturdy buttons- Ease of setup: Contrary to some other reviewers, setup was straight forward and took about 30 minutes.- Number of HDMI ports: 3- Picture quality: Some may say that the display colors are a bit \"warmer\" than other sets, but I really enjoyed the picture quality after tweaking a few picture settings.Cons:- Display Type: TFT instead of LED (an LED display would have helped bring out some stronger contrasts)- Refresh Rate: 60Hz is fine at the price point, but 120Hz would have been even better- Sound: Sound is a bit tinny and isn't as loud as I'd have liked. It's definitely not terrible, but I would say it's average at best. If this is a big issue for you, consider an external home theater or speaker system to plug into the TV- Shipping Method: Thankfully, my set didn't arrive damaged/defective, but I can imagine the box getting damaged during shipping since Amazon just sticks a shipping label on the TV box (there's no additional padding/boxing).Overall, I would recommend this TV for anyone that gets it for $450 or less, as it really is a bargain for an Internet TV. It's not a high-end TV by any means, but it's definitely a value nonetheless without the big brand premium price. I wouldn't recommend using this set as a PRIMARY TV, but if it's for a bedroom, lounge, etc, then it's a great buy.Tip: During setup, my channel scroll buttons didn't work until I auto-scanned for channels. Just something to note before you start freaking out that the remote isn't working.", "Date": "December 9, 2011"}, {"Title": "Do not buy any iSymphony products no warranty", "Author": "Richard", "ReviewID": "R3W42JL2IXE8XC", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "Do not buy any iSymphony products.

This arrived in perfect condition.  We have had it about 2 weeks now and we are very pleased with it for the price we paid.  I felt comfortable going with a \"no name\" brand because I found an inexpensive warranty on Amazon when I purchased it.  The sound could be better, but still giving 5 stars for price and quality otherwise.  A surround sound system will easily remedy the mediocre sound quality.  It still gets loud enough to hear well, just not much bass.  Like I said, nothing a good surround sound system won't fix.  I also love the fact that I didn't have buy another blu ray player (ours broke after only 8 months:( because it has the internet options in it.  You only get Vudu and Netflix options I believe, but we only used the netflix on our blu ray before so it is GREAT for us!", "Date": "December 15, 2011"}, {"Title": "Damaged TV on 1st and then Dead Pixel on 2nd", "Author": "coolTechie", "ReviewID": "R1AAWLR3CK3KM0", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "TV was poorly packaged, may be because of the size.

It came rapidly (although Amazon's delivery estimate was a day early, but a simple 5 minute chat with them resulted in a refund of my 3.99 shipping fee :) ) First things first: The tv came in its actual box with a shipping label slapped on it. Base assembly was easy, even though some have complained about the base screws not fitting. Everything went up easy and looks pretty good right out of the box.Good: Screen looks good when playing HD, although I will be springing for one with 120Hz refresh instead of this one's 60Hz. For normal (especially standard def tv) viewing, this tv is just fine. For gaming or HD sports, you may want to consider a 120Hz or higher. Speakers seem to be good quality, although again, for anything beyond normal tv watching, you're going to want some theater speakers. Other than that, I can only compliment the lightning deals price. I couldn't possibly imagine paying full price.Bad: Completely unable to connect to the internet-based services Vudu and Netflix wirelessly. The tv comes with a USB wireless adapter, which I found to be a bit odd to begin with. Why not just build it in? Either way, I tried 3 different routers from 2 different manufacturers without any type of success. The tech support is near worthless (albeit friendly once you get ahold of them)and couldn't provide any suggestions for me to fix this issue. Basically, it's a new product for them and they don't have anything to tell you as far as fixing any problems goes. The tech told me that it is likely a firmware issue. They also haven't issued any software upgrades (although the TV settings has an option to upgrade when available). I also tried to plug in a set of computer speakers to the headphone jack and was nearly deafened by the feedback and noise. I tested every component with my iPod with no problem, but it appears that the headphone jack on the tv was defective right out of the box.Overall: I will be returning this tv, thanks to Amazon's awesome return policy. The wireless issues and cheap-feeling of the interface and use of the TV makes it worth it to me to spend more on a smaller, but better quality tv. This is a case where the cheaper price comes at a cost. My advice, if you want a big tv with 1080p resolution, and sports and video gaming are not a factor, go for it. If you want reliable service and a better quality product, spend the extra and go with a more reputable brand. Sorry iSymphony, I gotta go with someone else.", "Date": "December 6, 2011"}, {"Title": "What iSymphony customer service?", "Author": "CRockwell", "ReviewID": "R6LZ5QKI47KH9", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "Purchased this on a lightning deal on Nov. 26. Super value for a 1080p TV!I'm a realist - in this day of \"I want it cheap,\" manufacturers simply can't take the same level of care they did 30 years ago when people paid a little more for better workmanship. So, things aren't always perfect and there's a problem with the TV's tuner. The Channel +/-, FAV, EGR buttons on the remote and the manual buttons on the side of the television won't change the channels (I can, however, enter a channel on the remote's number pad, but even that takes 11 seconds for the station to change. Also I can click the last viewed button and it instantly jumps back to the previous channel.)On the chance that I was doing something stupid (hey, it happens), I contacted iSymphony tech support several times throughout the day over several days only to get a busy signal or an answering machine asking me to leave a number or to email. I tried the email twice. No response after five days. Amazon has already agreed to replace the item which is why my family loves Amazon! Incidentally, my daughter bought the exact same TV; her's is perfect and she is very pleased with the value. I just hope I don't have a problem if something goes wrong while it's under warranty.
