Looking at TVs on display in stores, other LCDs didn't have very dark blacks and a lot had those weird pixelly trails when there was fast motion. The 37HL67 doesn't have either of these problems. It has a great picture - bright, good color and contrast. The controls are easy to use. The picture and built in sound are great. I hooked up an old amplified antenna I had and the tuner got almost all of our local HDTV stations. I just ordered an antenna made for HDTV Terk HDTVa Indoor Amplified High-Definition Antenna for Off-Air HDTV Reception and expect that to work even better. In case you came across this in your search, the 37HL17 is the exact same model as this one, it just has a different number as it is usually shipped to a different type of retailer. All in all, I am very happy with this TV and would recommend it highly.The connections on the back:3 HDMI inputscoaxial input for cable/antennacomputer monitor VGA-type input2 sets of component video (3 phono/RCA type plugs)/stereo audio (2 phono plugs) inputs1 analog video (single yellow phono plug)/audio in with s-video option1 optical TOSLINK audio out1 main stereo (red/white phono plug) audio outone stereo audio in (red/white phono plug) for use with either the HDMI or computer monitor inA 2nd analog video/audio in on the side of the TV for a camcorder or whatever", "Date": "August 20, 2007"}, {"Title": "Very good HDTV", "Author": "B.

The color and sharpness are about as good as any others (some being much more expensive) that I have looked at.SD digital picture: 4 stars. No HDTV displays SD extremely well, but the Regza does as good or better than most.SD analog picture: 4 stars. Of course not as impressive as digital, but I would expect that.Sound quality: 5 stars.

We have digital HD satellite, and an outdoor antenna connected, and get a very good picture from both. I have only watched SD DVD's so cannot say much about that, but they are as good as any other SD content. Overall, I am very happy with this television, and cannot come up with any negatives. I would strongly consider buying a Toshiba again.MAY 08, 2008 - After almost 10 months, no problems, and we are still very satisfied with the Regza!

Picture quality is superb, it took no time to set up, and we also have the comfort of owning a quality brand like Toshiba (between the two of us we own 3 other Toshiba TVs and they all look great and have lasted a long time)One thing that really stands out is how well it seems to handle standard def signals from satellite and DVDs, which is a real plus as he does not yet have a high def package.  The picture looks great for an LCD TV, and its easy to mess around with the settings like picture size and so forth to get it the way you like it, though honestly you may not change anything right out of the box.

This is a wonderful set with three HDMI inputs and many other options.  1080i/720p was fine for me since most cable HD is only up to 1080i anyway.Six weeks after delivery, two annoying defects appeared.  First, the TV stopped responding to the remote control after being switched off for a couple of hours or overnight; I can still turn it on using the buttons on the side of the chassis but it's a major PITA.  Mysteriously, the TV starts responding to the remote after warming up for 15-20 minutes.  Second (and even MORE annoying) is the random power cycling that happens during the first few minutes the TV is turned on; it takes about seven to eight seconds for a complete power cycle.  Having my programs interrupted several times in succession like that is NO FUN.Getting the TV repaired is turning into Mission:Impossible!  Toshiba directed me to a local authorized repair shop; they were decent over the phone but couldn't help me at all after a month of back and forth over the phone.  Now they say that their Toshiba FSE (field service engineer) tells them the needed part is NOT AVAILABLE!  I just sent a copy of my purchase receipt to Toshiba TACP and await a response as to whether THEY can either locate a part, or plan to replace my defective TV.I'm delaying any future purchase of Toshiba products until the successful outcome of this episode.

It was manufactured in April, and I bought it in May. It's done everything I'd hoped for and more. Using the digital tuner, it can pick up four of the five local channels in HD without a cable box by doing a cable scan. When I purchased it, I declined the 4(3)-year extended warranty because Consumer Reports said that there are very few repairs needed in the first year or two. There wasn't one mention of dead pixels. My chance to get the extended warranty would expire in 30 days, so when I noticed 2 dead (black) pixels on the 29th day, I went out and got the extra warranty because they (UE) provide better coverage than Toshiba would. The pixels don't bother me that much, but knowing it'll be less of a hassle to get it replaced if any more show up gives me peace of mind, despite it costing a couple hundred extra.", "Date": "June 18, 2007"}, {"Title": "Great TV for the price", "Author": "K.

Here are some PROs and Cons in my opinion:PROS:1. Very good HD image at my normal viewing distance (6ft. or more).2. Excellent SD image.  Better than comparable Sony units - These two items are based on Comcast Cable feed through component cables (they are short on HDMI interface converters here in Houston at this time).3. Rich feature set, many are quite useful.4. Very nice and clean look, doesn't have distracting light or overdone Logos.5. Useful and 'hand-friendly' remote.  Controls Comcast box well enough.6. Very good connectivity options.7. Well-built, feels solid.CONS:1. Sound quality is acceptable thought it could be better - probably constrained by the slim profile of the speaker area.2. Menu system is somewhat chaotic.  Can be better organized.3. Can not customize and save the pre-set picture modes such as 'Sport',  'Standard' and 'Movie' - I can do this on my Sony RPTV easily, and the  'Movie' mode is way too dim.There is no noticeable motion-blur, the video quality feels on a par with Sony or Samsung 720P LCD TV.  Sound is not as good as Sony but acceptable.For a home theater setup I would go with a 50-inch or bigger HDTV to get better visual impact and ease of surround sound setup.  But for HDTV experience, the Toshiba 37HL67 is a great buy.  One probably doesn't get a lot of bragging rights with it, but one sure can brag about having made a most sensible and practical choice while watching this TV.Highly recommended.", "Date": "November 16, 2007"}, {"Title": "Great Set", "Author": "Stephan J.

The picture quality is amazing, certainly the equal of the set's precedessor, a Sceptre Naga 1080P, and, for what it does, a decent second to my main display a Sony SXRD. Sound is fine, especially dialogue; if you're listening to music or special effects obviously you're going to hook the Toshiba up to an external system.I am fortunate to have Verizon FIOS which sends a fine SD picture that looks remarkable on the Toshiba. For sporting events on non-HD channels, like Fox Soccer World or ESPNU, the theatrewide2 zoom fills the screen without noticeable degradation.One reviewer objected to the Film picture setting- try using it on an HD movie- much more cinematic than Standard.Two considerations, one of them obvious. A 2:35 movie- think any spectacle-won't give you the involvement you'll get on a larger screen. But you know that already. The other, probably a minor issue- fixed audio outputs only. You absolutely can't send audio to a power amplifier, and a non-remote integrated amp can't be adjusted from your viewing position unless you've got expandable arms. I make do with the set's speakers for TV and the pause button on my DVD player.

I read many reviews of many manufacturer's brands before choosing the Toshiba. My living room is average to small in size and probably receives more sunlight than average. This unit was an upgrade from a 27\" Sony CRT. I can't find anything I dislike about the TV. The remote is plain, but with cable service, you're pretty much forced to use whatever remote they provide with the cable box. Sound quality seems fine. Angle-viewing is fine. Image brightness seems fine. The colors seem larger-than-life to me, but I haven't yet bothered to tone them down. I haven't seen the motion-blurring or fuzzy pictures of old programming that I've read can be problems. All image qualities in my opinion are improved over the CRT.

The TV itself is fantastic! I went from a 27\" SDTV (using Dish Network) to this model with Dish HD and an up-converting DVD player. I also upgraded our audio receiver at the same time. I compared this set to an LG set (similar size) and went with this set (I thought the picture was better, I have also had very good luck with Toshiba products). The picture quality is excellent for HD and also for SD channels as well. There are plenty of input connections for everything you can think of. I also have my PC running through this set (DVI output on PC to HDMI on TV) and games look great as well. The audio from the TV sounded fine to me until I hooked up the digital audio system; I now use the digital audio receiver (5.1 speaker setup) 99% of the time as the 5.1 channel sound is significantly better than the TV sound output.Some points to note:a) The \"white-glove\" delivery service consisted of bringing the box into the house. The guy grumbled when he was asked to unpack the TV.b)I debated getting my satellite programming upgraded to HD. I am very glad that I did; there are quite a few channels that are unique to HD programming and the quality (picture/sound) is excellent. I didn't see the need for a 1080p TV since the satellite broadcasts are only 720p/1080i, I wasn't planning on getting an HD DVD/Blu-Ray player and the size of the set did not warrant the extra money for 1080p.c)To get the full digital 5.1 audio effect you must have a digital audio receiver PLUS you must connect each digital device (satellite box, DVD player) directly to the audio receiver. This TV only accepts PCM audio input from the HDMI cables. There is a digital out from the TV but it will not pass a digital 5.1 audio signal from the HDMI through (only PCM). The audio receiver I purchased only has digital audio connections (not HDMI connections) so I had to get a digital optical cable for the satellite receiver digital out and a coaxial cable for the DVD player digital out.d)I purchased an up-converting DVD player; I cannot tell the difference (I still have my old DVD player hooked up to the HD set). Maybe for larger sets that are 1080p the up-conversion may be worth it?e)Think about what cables you need and buy them from Amazon. All the retail stores charge high prices for cables which are not worth the extra cost.f)I bought component cables for the Wii, some games do look better at the higher resolution if the higher resolution was supported (only one game looked \"blocky\" but it was a third-party lousy game anyway).", "Date": "December 25, 2007"}, {"Title": "Great value for a good tv!", "Author": "K.

I was anxious about dealing with delivery, but having someone bring it to my house and help unpack it was less stressful than other TVs I've bought where I had to load a big box in my car, haul it in the house, etc.I use mine to watch digital channels with the QAM tuner.  In addition to the great picture (especially on HD channels) it has great channel handling and flips through channels reasonably quickly.

Go thru the specs2) Audio - from a layman's perspective(& I would consider myself slightly up the curve compared to a layman), audio is excellent. Bass is terrific - (pseudo)surround-sound works like magic with TV programs that broadcast in surround sound - it is not tinny to hear. Supports optical digital out which might be downmixed to dolby pro-logic. That should not matter in case you are feeding audio from your sources to your home-theater receiver. IMP NOTE - if you hook-up your AV source to this TV via HDMI, audio is downmixed to 2-ch LPCM. (Note that LPCM is pure uncompressed, better than compressed formats like dolby digital or DTS, channel for channel - of course, this is 2-ch so again recommendation is to connect your AV source to your home theater receiver).3) Video - this is spectacular. This TV is billed as a 1080i but make no mistake it accepts full 1080p inputs. The result (my viewing distance is around 8 ft) is indistinguishable from an equivalent 1080p (I spent tons of hours in research and comparison). Colors, detail & sharpness are ourstanding when watching BD movies from my PS3 hooked up via HDMI. Absolutely no complaints.IMP NOTE - it is essential that you spend time calibrating all the myriad pic options to suit you best. I found that if I started by setting all options \"dead center or middle\" and then tweaking each one as high as my eye found pleasing, with final fine-tuning touches by using calibration DVDs, results were spectacular. Spend time on these calibrations and your labors will be rewarded.I DO NOT have HD TV transmission - have regular DirecTV but the results are still VERY GOOD. Yes, there is a slight smudginess etc(will be there when you watch regular transmission on ANY HDTV) but this one likely deals with it in the best possible way. The results are as if you are watching the best quality VHS tape and oh yes - the south asian channels that I get - for some reason look almost HD-like on this TV.I got it on sale for 839/- and in its size-class this is probably the best one for the price, still!!!!

Well, if I knew of all the problems that it would create beforehand, I would have forked over the extra $200-300 and purchase this in a store.First of all, Amazon ships this TV via Eagle which is probably the worst shipping provider out there.  They are unbelievably unprofessional over the phone and they didn't even provide the white glove service that was supposed to be included.  I guess this was my mistake for overseeing this part, but they still should have offered.  Anyways, I unpacked the TV (which is beautiful by the way) only to find out that the screen didn't even produce any picture!  I heard the audio just fine, but other than that, I got a TV that just didn't work.  I even had a repair man open it up to diagnose it and I was stunned when he told me that the entire circuit board was corrupt and that he would need to replace the entire thing.  I decided to just return it instead of replacing it since it was such a headache to deal with (I had to talk to Amazon almost 6 times just to get this completed).  I ended up buying another TV brand at the store and am more than happy with my decision.Maybe I got a lemon of the bunch or Eagle just didn't pay attention to the \"fragile\" note on the box when they were delivering it.

TV set was put in service in July 2007 and performed perfectly with beautiful picture and decent sound. About 2 months ago it started losing the video when changing channels using the cable converter. Power plug to TV had to be unplugged and plugged in to get picture back. This is happening with increasing frequency and soon expect the set to fail for good. Not a recommended product, in spite of it's still excellent picture and sound quality. R.E.W.UPDATE: March 14, 2012. This Toshiba TV started to lose the video almost daily with every back and forth change from HD to SD channels. Seeing that it was only doing this on channel changes with the cable box, which had been recently replaced with a newer model, I discussed it with a Comcast tech and he advised changing my cable input on the TV from HDMI to Component. This is labeled, \"ColorStream HD-1\" (or 2) on this particular set.It may have been that the changes to the incoming signal from the cable box was triggering a shut down safety circuit that protected the screen. All I know is, it has been 3 or 4 days now of intentional switching back and forth between HD & SD channels to torture test the different connection used, and there has not been one \"blackout\" yet.  Will I change my 2 star rating for this set? No. This problem should not have occurred with so many different sets. Had it been trouble free, I would rate it at 4 to 5 stars for picture and sound quality.As far as Toshiba products in general go, I have a Toshiba DVD/VHS player - recorder and a Toshiba laptop computer and have been satisfied with them all, so far. I am looking forward to a few more years of trouble-free service from this TV, also. If this update does not get another \"update\" then consider the problem solved, at least for this particular set. I have no way of determining whether the \"problem\" lies with the HDMI output of the cable box or the input of my TV set. As it stands now, \"If It Aint Broke,Don't Fix It\" sounds like my motto for the time being.  R.E.W.UPDATE - September 3, 2012 :  So far, so good. The old Toshiba TV is still working OK since changing the hook-up. Other than this \"problem\", I would have probably given this set 4 or 5 stars. Excellent picture and very good sound.

They've used it daily ever since.Before purchasing this model I found a professional review that stated that the HD quality was more than acceptable for this model (keep in mind it's 720p), but that non-HD digital and analog signals were some of the worst you'll find in this price range.  I know, you buy a TV like this for watching HD.  Problem is, you don't always receive HD.Before I bought my parents an upcoverting DVD player they used the regular player for this TV and it was just horrible.  The picture was worse than what they had with the older analog set.  Rushed out and bought the new DVD player.  That problem was fixed.They receive their digital TV over antenna.  Keep in mind that on antenna you can get three signals - analog (which disappears in 2009), digital (regular signal for lack of another term) and HD.  Since analog is going the way of the dodo there's no need to address that.  However, there are plenty of times that the digital signal is not in HD.  When that happens, this TV's picture is kind of disappointing.  Not horrible, no, but if you're stuck without an HD signal long enough it will make you wonder why you spent so much money.Keep in mind that there are digital TVs that do handle non-HD signals quite well - but you have to find the professional technical reviews out there to find out which ones they are.This might sound like I'm bashing this TV, but I don't intend to.

I spent 3 months researching TV's before settling on this one.  This set has excellent contrast with good black levels.  A lot of the cheaper, or even similar priced, LCD's have very gray blacks.  Be prepared to spend some time tweaking the picture settings for each input to get exactly what you want.The glossy black bezel looks really nice in my living room, but keep your kids away from it or you'll be wiping off smudges all the time.  The remote could probably be a little better, but I'm going to get a universal remote soon anyway.

After two and a half years I had trouble with a cold start.  Then it would not start unless I plugged and unplugged it multiple times.  I found people on the internet with the same issue and they said to take if the power saving setting and always keep it plugged in.  Well this worked until I need to move it.  When I plugged it in I spend a couple of hours trying to start it, no luck.  There is a yellow light on the front that just keeps blinking 3 times in sequence.  Found out this is a common problem and requires that the power board mostly needs to be replaced.  Of course Toshiba knows of no problem with this model.  This is the first tv I have ever had that stopped working.  Goggle this model for problems.  KEEP AWAY, DO NOT BUY ANY TOSHIBA PRODUCTS.I finally took it to a repair person and he just updated some firm ware in the TV.  Cost just $50.00.  I was going to throw it a way.

Here's the one you NEED to read from an owner of 2.5 years. It is not a matter of IF the LCD screen will go out, just a matter of WHEN. When being most likely within 1-3 years max. Toshiba KNEW when they sourced the LCD screens for this TV that they were faulty and had serious issues. Sony has a class action suit against them right now for doing the same thing. They went ahead and bought them in bulk for a song and installed them anyway to save money and increase profits while staying competitive in price. Not only does the TV blow up before dust can comfortably settle on it, any deep bass sound rattles the housing with a loud buzz. The picture is not all that terrific compared to decent, reliable brands (Hitachi, Samsung). All in all, you would be better advised to pile your money up in your driveway and burn it than buy this piece of inferior crap. Oh, the best part? When the TV guy comes and hauls it in to diagnose what I just told you is going to happen...the cost of the LCD screen replacement 1s over $1000 alone! That's right...not only do the low life SOBs at Toshiba continue to sell the inferior displays, they price the replacement parts higher than the original cost of the whole set! Add $250 into that for labor and you have a potential $1250 pile of Japanese garbage (plus original cost) sitting on a workbench in a TV shop on it's way to polluting a landfill somewhere.I have no axe to grind against Toshiba...you simply buy any of their products including the highly touted Regza line at your own risk. They are absolute 100% TRASH and guaranteed NOT to last 1/4 the time of other brands.
