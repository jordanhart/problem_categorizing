Still works great.I just hooked up this TV to satellite with HD service.  HD picture is outstanding, and SD is very good.  DVD player is excellent.  Good sound. I wanted a built in DVD, so my grandson can watch his DVDs in the kitchen, rather than the big TV.Only a 90 day labor warranty, so consider an extended warranty.  My only complaint is that I can't get my Direct TV remote to turn the TV on/off.  Otherwise, controls the TV and DVD.  I'm thinking the DVD feature is confusing the remote.  The TV off switch defaults to DVD.  Easy to push the on/off button on the tv, so the problem is very minor.  Since I can control volume, I know I have the right code.This is my second HDTV.  Have Direct TV DVRs hooked on both, Both are 720 P.  Both have outstanding pictures.  A+++ on this TV.", "Date": "November 29, 2008"}, {"Title": "Great TV, Excellent Tuner", "Author": "R. Urchyk", "ReviewID": "R3LW0CR6U48X3A", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This is my 5th attempt at HDTV. Every other one I tried received few of the digital transmissions available in my area. This RCA not only receives all local channels, but also digital channels from 60+ miles away as well. DVD is quiet and fast to load. Only complaint is the channel scan took quite a while to complete, maybe because I get so many channels. You won't regret this purchase.", "Date": "August 26, 2008"}, {"Title": "Good picture but lousy tuner", "Author": "bonot1 \"bonot1\"", "ReviewID": "RPYDFA8O2X5QD", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "We bought this for $400.  It has some good qualities (DVDs work well) but the digital tuner is poor, or perhaps more accurately, hyper-sensitive.  If you're cheapskates like us and use an exterior antenna, I would skip this one.  It's on the same antenna feed as all of our other TVs and DTV Converter boxes, but this TV can maintain a digital signal on only 2 stations at our location.", "Date": "June 6, 2009"}, {"Title": "Just what I needed and wanted!", "Author": "Minnesnowta", "ReviewID": "R3QOREBF940BBY", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "We live in a small apartment and regardless, the television will not be the focal point of our space.
