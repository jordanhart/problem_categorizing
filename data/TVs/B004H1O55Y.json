Their website was not funtioning properly, which they admitted.  Their advice to me was to email their webmaster. Keeping their website shouldn't be the customers resposiblity.  Now they left me with an entire weekend without full use of the TV.This is an internet ready TV and the Qwerty keyboard remote does not come in the box.  When I went on line to get it, I found out the wait was three months.  Using this TV for internet access is nearly impossible with the TV remote that comes with it.", "Date": "June 4, 2011"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "Unavailable", "Features": "1080p display\n4 HDMI inputs\nPC video input\nBuilt-in Ethernet port, 2 USB 2.0 ports\nInternet Connectable for access to Instant Content", "Name": "Samsung UN46C6900 46\" Class / 1080p / 120Hz / LED-LCD HDTV", "ImgURL": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41soV2Z0gDL._SY300_.jpg", "ProductID": "B004H1O55Y"}}
