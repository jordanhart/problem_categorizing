The television far exceeds all of my personal expectations.  The picture is very clear and vivid, on the preset factory settings and was also set to energy savings.  It has a $11.00 yearly energy electric estimate based on 5 hours of everyday usage and 11 cents per kilo watt hour.  In addition it is PC Connection compatible. Page 25 of the Owners Manual (or refer to [...] to the 26\" LCD TV Model LC260EM2) , \" This unit can be connected to your PC that has a DVI terminal.  Use a HDM1-DVI conversion cable for this connection an it requires stereo mini plug conversion cables as well.  If you connect this unit to your PC, you can use this unit as a PC monitor.\"  A diagram is included to show how to make the connections. Their is also a 26\" Emerson that includes a built in DVD Player.  I have Time Warner Cable and have noticed an overall improvement in picture quality.", "Date": "October 18, 2012"}, {"Title": "great TV", "Author": "noname", "ReviewID": "R19ZUEQVHUE42U", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Easy to set-up, nice picture - DVD was a bonus to me as I did not realize I ordered the one with the DVD.

It has all the basics, 2 HDMI ports, great picture and sound. I love it.However, after 8 months of use it just shut off. I tried to reset it according to the instructions, and it turned on and then cut off again after 5 minutes. After that, nothing I did could get it to turn back on. Luckily, I purchased this from Walmart with a protection plan, and filed a claim and got it fixed for free. After a quick google search, power board issues are very common among some of the Emerson TVs. I don't know what the Amazon warranty covers and what the price is, but I would definitely get some kind of protection plan with this TV so you don't end up paying out of pocket for  a manufacturer's defect.", "Date": "August 19, 2013"}, {"Title": "Don't bother.

The picture is fair but not great. The sound is awful. My clock radio has better sound. I am not buying the extra protection. When this goes out it's going in the garbage!
