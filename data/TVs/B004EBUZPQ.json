Bouley", "ReviewID": "R105508M04NKPL", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I bought the Coby LEDTV2326 after researching affordable tvs to replace a failing Audiovox LCD TV/DVD combo I've had in my kitchen for six years.  It gets a lot of use, as the kitchen is the hub of our house.  I decided to forego the built-in DVD player, as convenient as it has been, because I wanted to keep the price down, and I have two extra DVD players just collecting dust in the basement.  One sits atop the fridge now.Upon unboxing, I was impressed with the thin, sleek build of the Coby.  Five minutes later it was hooked up and searching for channels...it's that easy.  I have it connected to standard cable, so it found the expected 58 or so SD channels.  I was surprised to see that it also found 45 HD channels...I expected some, thanks to its QAM tuner, but not nearly that many.  Bonus.HD picture quality is beautiful.  I can't say anything more.SD picture quality is sub-par when compared to other HDTVs I own, and others I've seen.  It's not great...but its watchable.DVD quality (480p) is quite good.  Not HD, but very crisp.  Blows SD cable away.One more thing to note about the picture - I can definitely see bright spotting around the perimeter when the screen is totally black...this indicates poor back (edge) lighting.  Were it my main tv, it would go back for this.  It's a kitchen tv.  No big deal.Now for the sound...I've never heard worse sound quality from any tv in my life...and I'm a videophile, so I've experienced a lot of tvs.  It sounds like you're trying to listen via a pair of crappy headphones sitting on the table in front of you.  It's literally unbearable.  Thank God they included a headphone jack.  I bought a $25 pair of decent computer speakers to solve the problem.  It sounds great now.Overall, if you're looking for a good display for mainly HD or DVD duty, and you're willing to augment (replace) the included sound with a cheap pair of computer speakers, buy this tv.  It's definitely worth two bills.  If, however, you don't like the idea of separate speakers and just want a plug-and-play tv, buy something else...one with forward-facing speakers (hard to find, but obvious due to the perforated grilles you'll see under the screen).  Any display this size with down-facing speakers (the majority) is going to sound like crap.11/14/11 UPDATE - after five short months of use, the LED edgelight is failing.  It will start to flicker, then go completely black.  If you look closely, you can see that the LCD screen is still producing an image, but there is no backlight.  With the piddly 90 day warranty, I'm out $200.  Stick to the major brands.  Don't buy this.", "Date": "June 2, 2011"}, {"Title": "Decent TV at a great price; Perfect for saving money.", "Author": "Glenn", "ReviewID": "R2GFU2OCGF9QC5", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Knowing that the difference in quality of small television sets is marginal, I was willing to try an off-brand set. I picked up the Coby LEDTV1526 from a local electronic store chain for $88. The TV was a bargain for what I paid, despite its shortcomings. I bought it primarily to use as a monitor (which it does fine through the HDMI input but with some problems with the VGA input), but it works fine as a TV as well. In general, the picture is just as good as that of my 32\" Vizio, and the sound is loud enough for any SMALL room. The small size and low weight of this set make it ultra-portable too. The remote works fine, and I like its build quality and large buttons. The energy use of this set is incredibly low; According to the energy guide label, you can expect to use three dollars of energy in a YEAR if you use the set five hours a day. The set has a few problems that can definitely be overlooked for the price, but I feel should be known:1. The viewing angle is awful. You need to look at it dead-on, or colors start to go. Not a problem from close distances or if you can position it so that it will be watched dead-on.2. The TV angles slightly upward (I think < 5 Degrees), but I'm not sure exactly how much. I may have set it up wrong, but I wouldn't know that because it doesn't come with instructions on how to attach the base. I know Coby is a cheap brand, but come on!3. My unit had a glaringly obvious, bright green dead pixel, and the store I bought it from had a \"no returns\" policy. It isn't worth paying $50 to ship to and from Coby for a replacement, though. Obviously not a problem if purchased from Amazon, though it speaks somewhat of Coby's hit-or-miss quality control.4. Only 1 HDMI input (common problem for TVs this size). Excellent selection of other inputs for a TV this size though (1 AV, 1 Component, among others).5. The rear VGA port is hard to use. You need to angle in a VGA cord and screw in a single side first before the other can be screwed in. The TV is recognized as a 24\", Coby-made set by default, and depending on how you're using the VGA port, you may not be able to get the correct resolution (1366x768; For a monitor of a computer running Ubuntu, a Linux-based OS, the best I could get was 1360x768).6. The TV produces different picture quality depending on the ports you use, and not in the way most would think. When using a 1080i source through the antenna/cable input, pictures appear a little painting-like. When using HDMI, they appear more natural.7. Weak speakers, but it is a 15\" set and with so little room to put speakers in, that is expected. After adjusting to the sound, it is sounds surprisingly good.8. The power cord comes loose VERY easily. It won't fall out if you're keeping it in one place or just moving it slightly, but it sure isn't a tight fit.9. This is the big one. From everything I've heard, Coby itself more or less abandons you after the 3 months labor warranty is up (their 12 months parts warranty is meaningless). Because the set is so cheap, I don't think an extended warranty for more than 1-2 years is worth it though.10. The over-the-air and other TV tuners work well. You have to rescan completely if you want to find new channels (there is no option just to find new ones which is a bit disappointing), a disappointment as an antenna user. The worst problem if you use an antenna is that to see signal strength, you have to dig deep into the menus of the television.11. The black levels on this set are very unimpressive (this is a 15\" set, and this was expected). Other colors are vibrant, though the set has trouble with some of them (especially reds and browns), producing a blocky appearance. It's tough to describe, but you'll notice it up close.12. The TV always has a blue light on at night. Oddly, you have the option to turn the light off from the remote when the TV is on, but not off.", "Date": "July 22, 2011"}, {"Title": "LED Critique", "Author": "William Moberg", "ReviewID": "R39NGGK4EZBP1I", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I purchased this TV to replace a 10 inch analog TV mounted under a cabinet in our kitchen. I have it mounted instead from the wall behind,using an articulating wall mount. I am generally pleased with the TV. On the positive side I am able to connect directly to my cable without a cable box since it has a QAM tuner. On the negative side the picture is not as good as other LCD TV's that I have looked at. In particular, the analog stations are much poorer in quality than my old analog TV produced. The HD channels are much better but still lack the black contrast of other sets.  Interestingly, my cable channel is not available in HD without purchasing an upgrade package. I have only the basic cable service but the network channels are digital. The response to the color adjustment and audio controls is dismal. Almost no effect. The sound is 'tinney' and no amount of adjustment corrects this. As for other common limitations of LCD TVs, the viewing angle is critical. The screen arrived tilted downwards approximately 5 degrees from vertical which is noticeable with this effect. It appears to have a tilt, but when I called the factory they reported that there is no adjustment for tilt ?? Since I am using a wall mount this is not an issue for me, since there is provision for tilt in the mount. I plan to keep this set, but wish that I had been able to 'kick the tires' in a local retail outlet before purchasing. It is not available locally in any of the big name stores. There is precious little available in screen sizes less than 19 inches.", "Date": "October 23, 2010"}, {"Title": "very disappointing experience", "Author": "Dewey Hylton", "ReviewID": "RNZNJVDIG5EOR", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "i already knew the sound wasn't going to be stellar based on previous reviews. but i wasn't expecting the product to cost more than advertised. ADORAMA sold me the tv via amazon, and it arrived without obvious damage. plugging it in, however, produced lots of colorfully lit pixels all over the screen - with no input. the display is simply broken, and supplying an image doesn't change the faulty pixels. i'm estimating 15-20% of the pixels are faulty. okay, so that's the unit itself.i clicked away on amazon's forms to generate a return request. 2 days later, adorama writes to say that they won't work with me because i accepted the package that was delivered. they point me to COBY, the manufacturer.so i hit up coby, just to find that not only do i have to ship the unit to them - i also have to pay for them to ship me a replacement. this unit just became $50 more than advertised, meaning i could have purchased a better unit from a more reputable company in the first place. meh.my recommendation: don't bother with either ADORAMA or COBY. just save yourself the headache, and possibly some money in the end.picture of the factory-fresh unit in all of its brokenness: [[...]]", "Date": "November 10, 2011"}, {"Title": "Incredible buy for 99.99", "Author": "happy", "ReviewID": "R2B81NJ26YUBC9", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "what and incredible TV for 99.99$ I dont know what everyone is complaining about but this tv is awsome...The picture quality in highdef is incredible..If you want big sound buy a big TV ...the sound for this tv is fine and quality is great...dont ever hesitate to buy this tv for kitchen or bedroom you will be very happy....thanks amazon", "Date": "December 2, 2011"}, {"Title": "waste of money", "Author": "Amazonian", "ReviewID": "R13PIZVHL7AJN5", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I bought this TV in January 2012 and thought it was a good deal at the time.

It looks nice and seems to be well made. The full size remote is better than most, it looks nice and is easy to use. If you want to go to a channel and punch in 8, for instance, it know to go to 8.2 which saves a lot of button pressing. The program guide shows information about the current program and upcoming programs also which other sets such as Emersons can't do. The tuner is more sensitive than most and can pull in even the weakest low power stations. I was able to get all the stations from Phoenix and Tucson with my roof top antenna, approximately 65 channels.  The picture is bright and sharp with bright colors and very, very bright whites. The picture is so white that it takes some getting used to because it makes blues look almost too blue. The tint control can be adjusted for only red or green, there's no way to tone down the blue. The display has that shiny, clear coating that is all the rage now instead of having a coating that eliminates reflections. The case is also very shiny so it's best to use this set in a darkened room without any light sources behind you or you will have a lot of reflections from the screen.  The Color intensity is turned up way too high by default and needs to be backed off a lot to keep skin tones from looking much too red. While the resolution is only 1366X768 that is fine for a display of this size. The biggest problem however is the 6 bit color that can only display 262k colors instead of 16.7 million colors like other sets. That means it will lose a lot of small detail in the picture because color gradients can't flow smoothly and you will get strips of different solid colors instead. It looks OK from a distance but if you check up close everything looks more like a painting than a photo, kind of like that ad for the stock broker Charles Schwab where everyone's face is painted in.The field of view is narrow from left to right and up and down also. You get a great view straight on, which is fine for one person, but move a little off to the side or up and down and you don't see anything much. If you put the TV on a night stand by the bed and adjust it to watch while sitting up you won't see much if you lie down. It does tilt a little but might need a book underneath the base to tilt it for best viewing angle. There are mounting holes on the back for a stand with better movement however. The manual says the set has 6 Watt amplifiers and built in Dolby digital decoder for Superior Sound but that's a joke. The speakers in the bottom of the case can't be any bigger than 1\" diameter and sound worse than listening to a pocket size transistor radio. There's nothing but mid range audio, sort of like a tin can on a string. It sounds so bad that it's not even suitable for casual viewing unless you use headphones or get a good pair of 2.1 powered speakers but they are cheap at Goodwill.My biggest concern is with the LED backlights. White LEDs don't last very long and there's no information about replacing them or even if they are replaceable when they start to get dim. While people are used to red or green LEDs lasting a long time there is no such thing as a white LED because they only produce one single color. White is produced by taking a blue LED that is coated with yellow phosphor, like the kind on the front of a TV picture tube, that glows when the LED activates it so the combined result of yellow and blue looks white. The life of a white LED depends on the quality of the phosphor and can very from a couple of weeks to 2-3 years depending on how expensive it was so the life of this set remains to be seen.Also, the set really does turn on by itself like others have said.

I needed something small with an HDMI input.  This 15\" TV from COBY was the smallest one I could find.  Unfortunately, the HDMI input didn't make the picture as perfect as it is on my SONY TV's.  While the picture is sharp and ghost-free, when I look at the image up close, I see solid blocks of color, no gradient shading.  It looks like a paint by numbers picture.  But, from a distance the picture is acceptable.My biggest complaint is the viewing angle is very narrow.  There is almost no 'sweet spot' for viewing.  It seems worse than looking at the worst laptop screen.  If the middle of the screen is good, then the top or bottom of the screen is faded, with washed out black tones.  The same goes for the left to right viewing angle.  So, even though the manufacturer's site says the contrast ratio is an impressive 3,000:1, most of the screen does not benefit from that rating.When I tried to adjust the brightness and contrast in hopes of helping the situation, the range of adjustments is barely visible.  It is so difficult to see the adjustments, because part of the screen is washed out due to the narrow vertical and horizontal viewing angles.My second biggest complaint is the quality of the sound.  It's really tinny.  I have to turn the Treble all the way down and the Bass almost all the way up.  I'd rather listen to the sound through my A/V system instead.  My MacBook Pro has better sound.I have HD DirecTV and the remote is supposed to be able to control the volume on any TV.

I wish some of the big manufacturers like SONY, Panasonic, Samsung & Sharp would come up with a small, HDMI connected, LCD/LED TV.  Fortunately, this TV cost me less than $110 from ABT Electronics.

SD via Coaxial cable looks good, not as sharp as HDTV, but not as mushy and blurry as on some other value TVs.  Other reviews have mentioned the LED brightness bleeding into the black picture.  It is annoying when the screen is black, but nearly imperceptible when video is playing.  As another reviewer noted, this is acceptable in a spare TV, but it does keep this set from being a good choice for your primary TV.  This TV also works well as a computer monitor.  The screen resolution from the VGA connection is sharp and clear, making this an excellent computer monitor.  Sound is adequate, not great.  This has been noted in many reviews.  Keep in mind that this TV is very thin, as are most LED TVs.  Therefore, the speakers are also very thin.  Thin speakers are not typically the kind to produce room-filling, robust sound.

So unless thats been fixed, make sure you are home when it comes.Update: lowered from 5 stars to 4; Why? it randomly turns itself on. whether you are in the room or not, it will just randomly turn on for no reason AT ALL. so if you get one, check on it every so often to see if it turned itself on.

Swope", "ReviewID": "R8UFI5FF0Y2JX", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I was honestly surprised by how nice the picture is on this TV, very crisp and vivid but the colors warmer than many.  I like it!  After much searching and comparing we bought a Panasonic TV some months back and while the picture is very crisp, the colors are not as warm or realistic as on this TV. The picture also compares favorably to our large screen Toshiba, but that has a lower resolution. This set is capable of 1080p (though several other options are available in the settings menu).  The sound, while not great, is not that bad.  It's about average for small TV speakers.  The volume however, is not great.  While I could see the picture well at a distance of 20 feet, the sound was barely audible.  If this is going to be used in a large room, separate speakers are necessary (or highly recommended).  The remote is also pretty picky.  You need to be close and have it pointed directly at the receiver or it won't work.  One  of the things I like best about this set is the number of connections it offers.  There are component and composite connectors as well as HDMI. As one who struggled for a long time with an older set which was difficult to connect anything to, I really appreciate this.  This set can use both our old equipment (e.g. VHS player) and new.  It also has a VGA plug so it can be used as a monitor (which is what I had originally intended) however, this is an area where I feel it falls a bit short (and why I gave it 4 rather than 5 stars).  The stand is not adjustable/ flexible.  It doesn't swivel.  The angle can not be adjusted, nor the height.  As a  TV that is fine.  It is thin and light enough to easily mount on a wall, but I doubt I could get the viewing angle I like on a desk.  With a wall mount, all that can be adjusted in the frame.In sum, the set has a great picture, but falls a little short on sound.  It is very flexible because of the number of connections.  The weakest points are the lack of adjustability in the base/ stand, and the sound is a bit weak.It is great as a wall mount set in a small room.This is another brand which I discovered through my kids.  My son bought a portable DVD player with his birthday money a few years back.  Because it was a big purchase (for a kid) he shopped very carefully. He bought a Coby tablet.  While I had never heard of the brand, I was impressed with the solid build.  It still travels with us and works as it did when new.  I hope this set holds up as well.

Like I said, the tv is pretty simple and the remote is nothing fancy.  It is very light and the quality of it is not the greatest.  This tv did free up a lot of room on the kitchen counter compared to the old analog tv, so this is definitely a huge plus.  The viewing angle is not the greatest and the screen is angled upwards.  The screen angle cannot be adjusted.  What is really weird is that several times the tv turned on by itself.  Each time the remote was facing the tv, so maybe there was some sort of a glitch in the remote that turned it on?  Or maybe I have ghosts in my house... i don't know.

I had read the reviews about the poor viewing angle (they aren't kidding) but I bought it for my wife who watches the TV from the side of the bed, so that is a non-issue.However, I am disappointed that we currently cannot view HD (720P or 1080i) content from Comcast.  When I bought the TV, one of the main reasons was the ability to hook the cable directly to the TV rather than going through the free Comcast digital to analog converter box we had hooked up to the old TV.  What I found is the QAM digital tuner in this TV works as advertised but it doesn't pickup all the channels that came through the converter box.When we had the Comcast converter (model DC50x) hooked to the old TV, we received about 114 channels; all standard def. due to the fact that the converter only passes SD via channel 3 or 4 on the output side.  When I hooked the cable directly to the Coby TV, it picked up only 67 channels (all digital as Comcast has switched to all digital in my area).  The HD channels it picked up (720P and 1080i) looked great; unfortunately most of my wife's favorite channels are not available.  So I had to put the converter box back in-line with the cable and have the TV tuned to SD channel 4.What a disappointment.  I told my wife the new TV would let her view her shows in HD, eliminate the converter box and thick cable that sits on top of the night stand, and she would only need one remote control. Now the only way for her to view HD channels is to rent another HD converter box (much larger box) and to increase our monthly Comcast bill by $10/month.So beware Comcast customers, this TVs digital turner only passes the basic channel set; and a number of the 67 channels are broadcast both in SD and HD so there are effectively <50 channels.", "Date": "January 3, 2012"}, {"Title": "Unbelievable value!", "Author": "S.

Under settings, click \"computer settings and lower the phase( the phase is the tvs refresh rate.

High hopes, low expectations, and rightfully so.The blacks on this panel are atrocious. The blacklight bleeds on the edges, which is fine, to a certain extent, but noticeable in darker environments. I could live with this.There seems to be a handshake issue between my laptop and the monitor. For the first two days, the monitor worked well. Sound and video were plug and play transplanted onto the monitor. But starting yesterday (this is about three days into ownership), everytime I default video solely to the monitor, it begins to quickly flicker. This does not stop until I select the option where the laptop screen is mirrored on the monitor, instead of the monitor being the primary screen. I'm sure I could find a fix for this. Aggravating? Sure.The TV is marketed as a 1080p set. Which is not a false claim. However, the default resolution is 720p. I didn't know that. Still, it works at 1080p.The reason I'm sending this back is because of the atrocious text reproduction. No matter what I do, the text looks horrible. Super pixelated and choppy. This is unacceptable.On top of that, pictures and videos looked artificial. Colors were not reproduced accurately and at time made it look like I was watching something else when I'd compare the feed to the laptop.Never had a chance to hook up an antenna to use the TV feature.It is thin though.

He is technologically challenged, so he left it in the box until I arrived to visit last week. I opened the box and connected the TV. Immediately I noticed the color/tint was intermittently fading in the picture. Poor quality picture. Once the TV was on for a period of about an hour, the TV began to show lines, rectangles and other crazy flashes and was impossible to watch. I contacted AMAZON and they basically told me that because it was over a month since I had purchased it they couldn't do anything. They referred me to the manufacturer.I called Coby and spoke with a gentleman (Paul) who stated that I was in luck since there is a 3 month guarantee on the TV from them. I will ship the TV back tomorrow (at my expense + an additional charge of $20-$30 for service fees). I am not sure I even want another one of these TV's, but for $40 bucks I figure I will give them one chance to show me it was just an isolated incident.Lessons learned here: When you are buying a low cost electronic item from AMAZON, make sure you (or someone else) can open it immediately and test it to make sure it isn't a lemon. So far I have to admit the customer service at Coby was very satisfactory. The rest of the story remains to be seen.

Yes, it's bad, but that wasn't a deal-breaker for me. Had this been the only problem, I would have kept the TV. However, the sounds is very tinny and annoying, even in my small bedroom.2) The power issue - I have done a little research and this seems to be a problem that other's have had. The TV turned itself on on at least two occasions. This was a dealbreaker. On one occasion it turned itself on after we had gone to sleep.If it hadn't been for these two issues, the TV itself is nice. The picture is okay, the TV is lightweight and easy to set-up, etc. The box was pretty banged up when I received it, but I'll blame that on the shipping process.Unfortunately, it was my concern that this TV would eventually break down within a short period of time that led me to return it.

I was ok with the TV not being perfect such as the TV's angle, they way it sounds, not the perfect color. I mean, you get what you pay for. Anyway, the inside of the screen was cracked. Meaning, when you turned on the TV, the screen looked liked someone stuck thier fingers in blue and black paint, and flicked thier fingers and made splatter marks therfore leaving a cracked apperance.

Is it really worth the aggervation? I can handle a broken TV. However the unprofessionalsim, and not wanting to accept the responability for anything. They were RUDE RUDE RUDE RUDE...so I can send the TV back for 50.00 bucks wait 6-8 weeks to fix then they will send it back. Amazom is great. I have no problem with them, when I have had, very little, minor problems, Amazom is nice, extremly professional and resolves the problem and is not rude..I would never buy or reccomend buying a prodcut from this company ever again.

But the picture is above average when comparing to my 37\" Dynex LCD.  So I'm pleased about that.Audio:  I love good sound, and this is far from good sound.  You can listen to it and understand it, but if you think you can get good sound out of speakers that are less than half an inch thick you are mistaken.  As a secondary TV and at the price point it's no better or worse than anything else you will get.Connections:  This is the reason I dinged this TV, all the connections are directly on the back of the TV with the power cable plugging in at a 90 degree angle to the TV screen.  The biggest issue I have with this is that it forces the TV away from the wall by more than an inch.  I was hoping to have the ability to snuggly push it against the wall (with a very thin wall mount) but that's just not possible with this unit.  If you are simply going to use the stand none of this is a concern.Overall I would recommend this TV if you can get it for under $100.

You may, however, not think so because of how tight the tilt grip is. Also the Coby TV is so thin that I was a afraid of breaking it when tilting the TV. I also fear for it falling over because the base does not seem to be able to hold the shift weight properly. If there was a mild earthquake I think this TV would fall off the entertainment stand.

Well, I'm here to tell you that you should make space for the 19\" because there are no good 15\" brands out there.  This brand has such a small viewing angle that it always looked gray, and the sound is really abomidable, like an old am/fm radio.

He had just bought a TV so we held on to this one, opened it last night, and tried to use it. Turned it on and it turned itself off immediately. Did this repeatedly until it stayed on long enough to search for channels. We had this hooked to a rabbit ears antenna because we were going to use it for DVD only. Some of the channels came in, some didn't. I hooked up the DVD player, put in a DVD, and the video did not work at all, sound came and went in 2 or 3 second intervals. Tried another DVD player with the same results. TV shut itself off again. We has purchased this product from HHGregg in November and they only let you return items for 10 days (and now I know why) so I called COBY Tech help. They told me I had to pay for shipping the product to them as well as sending them a $25 check to ship the product back to me. So I have to pay $50 in shipping costs for a $100 TV that did not work fresh out of the box. Do not waste your time with this company who will not even stand behind their product for the cost of shipping the product back to you at their own expense.
