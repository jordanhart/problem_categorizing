It has only 2 HDMI inputs, just enough for a set top box and a DVD player.Although it has none of the latest frills such as 3D, smart TV, etc., it is more than a basic TV, with edge LED back light and 120 Hz display.The screen is beautiful and bright.  Being LED lit, it consumes less power and stays cool.  LG is the world's largest LCD panel maker, supplying panels to other TV makers.It comes with a table top stand.  Putting it together is relatively easy.  Due to its large size, it is a two person job.  The wall mount adapter is optional.I did not test any of its analog inputs.  It also has a USB input, presumably for displaying photos or video from a flash or disk drive.  However, its location on the back is very inconvenient for thumb drives.Why 5 stars?

I was impressed by the price and specs but was skeptical about the two HDMI ports for practical use but that shouldn't stop anyone from purchasing this TV. (I bought the Ultra High Performance HDMI Switcher 3-1 on Amazon) Problem Solved!Sound is great for an LED TV not trebly, but if you are looking for a TV for your entertainment system don't rely on just the TV speakers, definitely pair it with surround sound or a speaker bar.If the TV had Web Apps built in, it would have added more bang for the buck. However this shouldn't discourage a buyer, especially if you have an Apple TV, Roku or a Gaming System which now have web apps. (Or use the large sum of money you savee buying this, and put a bit towards one of the systems above)For the price and specs this should be a no brainer for anyone.Right out of the box, I did not have to tinker with any settings, looked great and no dead pixels.

Uselman \"whitetigergrowl\"", "ReviewID": "R1EO7GUQ0CHHA2", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I bought this at another retailer.The picture itself is fine. HOWEVER the 120HZ Trumotion that LG claims it as is misleading.First off. Look at the reviews elsewhere on the web for this. While many claim the picture is good, which it is, the claimed refresh is a blatant lie.First LG's own website. The first thing many have noticed is that for a 120HZ Trumotion TV, the blur reduction is almost non-existent. On top of that, there is no option to toggle TruMotion in this TV's menu, unlike on other Trumotion TV's. When others have asked this on LG's own website, LG's official response has been mixed. Sometimes it claims Trumotion is set on low at the factory by default, other times they say it's on Automatic. In other words, not even LG knows or can give an official response. Let alone why Trumotion seems to be almost non-existent on this TV even though it's claimed. I see almost as much blur on this 120HZ TruMotion TV as I do many regular 60HZ TV's. So something is horribly wrong in paradise. Currently, there is no firmware update that resolves the TruMotion issue with no sign from LG one is coming anytime soon.Like I said before, the picture itself is very good. And the sound is passable, although a good sound bar is recommended.I want to like this TV. I really do. The picture is good. But there is zero doubt that not even LG knows what is going on with this TV. Why it says TruMotion on the box...if it's even on, on automatic, or set on low by default with no way of adjusting any of it regardless.So if you want the TV for the 120HZ TruMotion be warned at this time it certainly is not the best option out there even for the price.There is NO Soap Opera effect with this TV. NONE at all. Which is a sign that TruMotion is not necessarily working as intended. And blur reduction is barely much better than a 60HZ TV which is disappointing.So all in all while the picture itself looks good, the advertised 120HZ and TruMotion have a minimal to no effect with no way of adjusting or fixing that. One which LG seems to have little interest in resolving.So get this TV if you want a basic LED. But DO NOT buy it if you are interested in the TruMotion or 120HZ. At least not unless LG comes out with a firmware update that resolves these issues and makes TruMotion selectable and adjustable.", "Date": "December 28, 2012"}, {"Title": "Great TV for what it is...", "Author": "Erik G.", "ReviewID": "R2ET22ZYHXD9DM", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "If you are looking for a Smart TV, go spend some more money. If you are a Smart person looking for a great TV, get this one! It is simple, clear, sharp and huge (for 47 inches). I shopped around alot, in the 50inch neighborhood. Ultimately ended up deciding to budget a little and get a sound bar with the $$ I saved from not going all out on a 50 incher. 2 HDMI inputs are all you'll get, but that is  really enough unless you are going HAM on peripheral devices. The blacks are actually really decent on this. Watched Prometheus on Bluray from the PS3 last night and felt like I was at the movies. The built in speakers will max out and distort a little above 25 on the volume, (cant wait for my sound bar to ship). It was fulfilled through Tiger Direct, which is a good 3rd party seller on Amazon... Was kinda weird that they did not make me sign for the shipment although TD states on their website that \"every order requires signature service\".. It was ok, cause I was home and peeking out the door all evening once the tracking said \"out for delivery\"Pros: motion is excellent, not overboard with the SOE, seems like they dialed down from some of the Samsungs I have seen. Great use of space and thin.. very thin. Can be very bright with Energy save adjustments.

Also You might wanna mess with the setting ( AND ADVANCED SETTING) to get the deep black pop out color and rich contrast ratio.Let me know if you want the setting I had in mine.. Make sure you have your brightness set to the 40 and constrast all the way to 100%, color to 70,backlit setting to 70-80, and color temperature to c10 (10 past 0).In Advanced setting make sure you have it this way, High, medium , High, High OR high Medium High Medium.. The rest after the 4 settings you can leave default if you want. After these settings watch it come to live. Huge difference.I barely write reviews , and for me to actually take the time to review this is being the fact that this TV is cheap for what it is.. and you can get more than other expensive similar TV.I care not about smart apps, wifi, 3D.. I got so many systems who has things like that (except for 3D which I really don't care about at the moment).My Xbox360, and WiiU looks absolutely gorgeous after these settings.. It's worth it.

Blu-ray players have them, my xbox has them, ps3's have them, and you can get a used roku for $30-$50 which does the same thing.

My Sony is a 40\" and this is 47\", not a lot bigger, but what a difference in picture. I had to reset my Sony Blue ray to play in 1080p because it was set for the old TV.

Lots of options for fine tuning.  But out of the box setting are very good. This is the lowest price I found on an LED with a picture this clear. Actors appear to be almost 3D at times.2 HDMI in ports, 1 Component (red green, blue) video in port, 1 Coaxial in.  It does NOT have Composite video (red, white, yellow) in, so if you have a recent vintage VCR like I do, you are stuck.  I am going to try to solve this today with a RF Modulator (Audiovox $9 on Amazon) that goes from the red, white, yellow on the VCR into the Coaxial in on the TV.I really like that this TV has no Internet.  I use AppleTV for all Internet services like iTunes, Netflix, etc.  My other LG TV has wifi and the Internet navigation is so clunky that I never use it.  Better to leave that to the geniuses at Apple.  So I feel like I did not wast $ on clunky  functionality I would never use.Sound is pretty good even without a soundbar.  Clear voice seems to boost dialogue sound above music levels.  I may add a soundbar. The only audio out option on this TV is Digital Optical Audio (skinny cable with a light on the end).  That seems standard for all new soundbars.  But you cannot just jack out an old pair of computer speakers like I was planning.  The TV has no mini headphone out jack.TV looks good.  Has a thin black frame.  Not as slick looking as my LG Infinia TV, which has a solid glass panel covering the entire front, giving it a frameless look.  But this LG TV is not ugly by any means.

Since you are already considering this monitor (instead of a professional grade $3,000 one), you won't be disappointed.It took quite a while for me to figure out how to get the display set up to use as a monitor. When I first attached it to my computer's graphics card (DVI to the HDMI on the monitor), everything was chunky and it was easy to see some major distortion was going on. I finally decided to check my graphics card utility, which I discovered was scaling the display. Setting that to 100% or no scaling helped, but still didn't entirely fix the problem. Then I found out that this display also overscales by default. It has a PC setting in the display menu, or I think you can set the scan option to get similar results. The manual doesn't mention one word about any of this, but if you do reading online you will find you need it to scan at 1:1 or 100%. Do this and everything will be perfect!

I wasn't interested in a smart TV since my Sony BD-590 has all of the \"smart\" features (and then some) at a fraction of the cost.  One of my concerns is the amount of radiant heat my Sharp LCD puts out (its about 5 years old, but works great).  My bedroom is smallish and during the summertime the Sharp puts out enough radiant heat to burden the window air conditioner.  The LG puts out zero radiant heat (at a substantial energy savings), but the heat was my primary concern.  I share the frustration at the limited HDMI outputs, but the picture is great and I only have the cable box and bluray player hooked up anyway.  In shopping for an LED, I was amazed at the range of energy use (and radiant heat) in the various brands and models.  I have been walking by TV displays checking the heat output with my hand.  I have a laser sight temperature gauge and the LG's picture has the same heat output as the drywall next to it. I have a Sony CT-260 soundbar attached to compensate for the speakers.  I didn't really believe the hype that the soundbar could replicate surround sound, but watching the Hobbit, on bluray, convinced me otherwise.  I had to pause the player just to confirm that it really wasn't raining outsideThe Sharp TV is still working great, and is being semi retired to a guest room.  Frankly, I had no idea the importance (at least to me) of having a TV that runs cool.  I thought that all of the LED TV's would have the same heat output.

The blacks on this set is nothing short of amazing. The dark scenes are brilliant and the light scenes are bright with popping colors. I'm so glad my friend talked me into LG instead of Samsung, which until now was my favorite brand. Has basic connections with 2 HDMI, 1 component and digital audio. Plenty for those who aren't planning or already have a home theater system. Ultra thin design is beautiful. Sound for such a slim tv is very good. Hanging on the wall, the speakers give true surround sound quality. My room is 10ft by 26ft with a raised ceiling and I haven't turned the volume up over 20. For those who can't afford a smart or 3D tv, this is an amazingly great deal. My video games look amazing on it.

Wood \"Media Engineer\"", "ReviewID": "R2R1KEIZDIXPUA", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "Note, this TV is dated and I purchased elsewhere. Pricing can be volatile on this set and there are far better values now. Unless you can get this set for under $450 and intend to use it as a monitor or with a very limited amount of devices, move on.I bought this initially to function as a big monitor. Sharp text, 120HZ, Full HD rocks on a decent video mid-level video card from a computer. In this installation I was using the TV antenna input for digital over the air reception.- In this use this is almost a FOUR STAR television. The massive design defect that keeps it at four stars is the input pack which drops this television down further IF you intend to use it strictly as a television. I have rated this as a THREE STAR because most will not use this strictly as a monitor.1. Other than the TV and USB input, this television has 2 HDMI and 1 Component it along with a optical digital OUT. In a real world that means only two HD inputs.2, NO ANALOG AUDIO OUT, including NO HEADPHONE JACK3. The Component Output will allow for Composite Connections.4. Be wary of using certain slim wall mounts as you will likely need a Right Angle HDMI adaptor given the thinness of the television and the location of the HDMI inputs.Like I said, a pretty good picture and highly functional as a massive FULL HD monitor for a computer. I have used two video cards, a Radeon 1GB 46XX and a 2GB Radeon 67XX to get outstanding extended desktop performance from this screen. (Running two monitors on one card it actually worked better with the older 46xx card)The problem most will run into is a gross lack of inputs. You are limited to one cable/sat input and one game console if those devices only have HDMI outputs.On the other hand, if your A/V system has multiple HDMI inputs that PASS AUDIO, you are good to go and can use this as an A/V monitor slaved to a receiver than has more HDMI inputs that pass audio.Where LG BLEW IT on this television is no conventional audio output. There is also NO HEADPHONE jack which could have been an ugly, but functional workaround of no analog output.If you have no plans to update your A/V receiver understand you are stuck at TWO HD devices even if you get a the run of the mill HDMI switcher (no audio pass through).", "Date": "January 2, 2014"}, {"Title": "Good entry-level LED LCD HDTV from LG!", "Author": "Gil \"musique_classique\"", "ReviewID": "R1PP5ZB1A6MXTM", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Entry level LG TV which has good picture quality and quite reasonable default settings.

Bit disappointed in the limited picture adjustments and controls.  You are locked out of the backlight feature and forced to use the one for whatever \"style\" you choose.  Standard worked best for us, but we noticed picture is best with at least moderate room lighting.  Very low lighting results in a rather dark picture that can fluctuate a bit during viewing which we found annoying.  Just turning on a table lamp for moderate lighting did away with the fluctuations and made for much more enjoyable viewing.  Tried using one of the options with a high backlight setting and adjusting the contrast and brightness, but this resulted in a rather washed out picture no matter what we did.  The 70% on standard is about right and you can bump the other settings slightly, but not too much or things get washed out or harsh.  Limited connections, but that seems standard for all TV's nowadays which is disappointing.  Used optical connection too hook up our older surround sound.  Not as good as previous Sony which had tons of connections and better sound both from the TV and surround.  Acceptable, but far from great sound or connection options.
