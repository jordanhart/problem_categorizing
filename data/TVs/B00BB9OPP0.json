Berry", "ReviewID": "R1UIK8AIJT0U08", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Pros:120Hz (This can be a con as well, see below) - There is a review stating this is not a 120Hz panel, it is.IPS Pannel - This is the type of LCD it is and IPS delivers better, truer color.Excellent viewing angel - Someone stated it has a poor viewing angle. I don't know what that person was looking at but this is not true for this LCD.Inexpensive - This is a very good bang for the buck TV.Great for bright room. There is a review that states this is TV is poor in bright rooms.Great for gaming - There is a review stating this panel is poor for gaming. Actually this TV has very low latency and as such there is little lag in the TV responding to movement in games.Cons:120Hz can't be turned off. This can make movies seem too real, what is known as the soap opera effect. It bothers most people and with most 120Hz TVs this can be turned off. With this TV it can not. LG could release a firmware that has the option to turn this off, but don't bet on it. This effect is not negative in most TV shows (except dramas), sports and games.Poor for dark rooms. I think this is due to the 120Hz and strong contrast. Again I think this is just for things that are affected by the soap opera effect. It becomes worse in the dark.Neutral:Only 2 HDMI ports - If you need more than 2 you may want to think about getting yourself a receiver or Home Theater in a BoxSound - If you need better sound you may want to think about getting a receiver or Home Theater in a BoxNot a Smart TV - If this is important to you look elsewhere.Overall most will be happy with this TV. If you are sensitive to the soap opera effect then look elsewhere.Soap opera effect: [...]Professional Review: [...]Another good review: [...]Optimal Settings: [...]", "Date": "September 14, 2013"}, {"Title": "Spent few more dollars on LN5700.  You will not regret it.", "Author": "Meng Qi", "ReviewID": "R3ANPDUBIZMUUJ", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "This TV would be a solid value if there were no LN5700:(1) IPS screen, which provides great color saturation and viewing angles (but sacrifices some black level).(2) Direct-lit screen, which eliminates backlight bleeds that are a common problem for edge-lit TVs.But given that the LN5700 is only 4-5% more expensive, the 5400 is a poor value.  I returned my 50LN5400 and bought a 55LN5700, and could not be happier:(1) LN5700 has no uneven backlighting.  LN5400 has slightly uneven backlights.  On an all-white screen, you can see dark patches.(2) LN5700 has a much faster processor; LG says the CPU is 120% faster and the GPU is 300% faster.  5400 has an old processor from 2011-2012.  Picture quality seems better on 5700.  My TV is hooked up to my HTPC.  5400 had difficulties rendering the sharpness of texts.  Texts either looked too edgy or too blurry.  But they look fantastic on 5700.  5400 has a very different menu.  I think it must have an old operating system, because the new OS probably cannot run on an old processor.(3) LN5700 has wifi and can update firmware, LN5400 cannot.  In some cases, updated firmware brings massive performance increases.  I had a Panasonic DT50 before.  The colors were off a lot, but after a firmware update the colors looked great.I suspect that 5400 is a 2012/2011 model rebadged as a 2013 model.  Given the tiny price difference between 5400 and 5700, there is absolutely no reason to buy a 5400, but I highly, highly recommend 5700.", "Date": "April 18, 2013"}, {"Title": "Honest review (from a gamer perspective)", "Author": "gamer_mike", "ReviewID": "R326CKEWQHD15J", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "LG Electronics 42LN5400 42-Inch 1080p 120Hz LED-LCD HDTVDesign - Plastic stand and cabinet material. Nothing special compared to most models but does the job. The thin bezels helps the look of the TV.Sound - TV provides plenty of volume and the software features help overall sound quality. On the downside, it sounds like mono rather than stereo. I recommend getting a sound system for it.Backlighting - The direct LED backlighting makes this TV very bright and looks pretty good in well lit rooms. However, the deep blacks are not dark enough for low lit rooms. Also, the backlight is slightly uneven but but that's normal for LED TV's. If this is a concern, I recommend buying a plasma display.Viewing angles - It has wide viewing angles. After 40 degrees, picture gets dimmer. That's pretty good for a LED TV.Refresh rate - This is a tough one. Despite what other reviewers said, this TV is 120hz. However, the motion interpolation (TruMotion) is set to low at the factory and the menu will not give you an option to turn it off or make the settings go higher. This is a good thing because it minimizes the \"soap opera effect\" when watching film base movies and drama shows. There's still some motion blurring on content that run below 30FPS but any video or games running 48FPS or faster look really good.Connections - 2 HDMI 1.4 inputs will get you by. The 1 USB port is a plus but it's only good for photos and music, not video or software updates. Good internal digital antenna too.Input lag - This TV is one of the best TV's for gaming due to its low input lag. I read somewhere that it measures at 8.3 ms. That is pretty quick even compared to higher-end models.Extra features - The TV is pretty basic. Not a Smart TV so don't expect more than basic video and audio controls. Not a 3D TV too.In conclusion, the 42ln5400 model is a very good buy for $430 or less (as of November 2013). I highly recommend it if you are on a budget looking for a 42 inch LED. As a gamer, this TV is perfectly priced and well suited for the new PS4 and XBOX1 consoles. I would give it 5 stars if LG gave the option to control the TruMotion settings.", "Date": "November 11, 2013"}, {"Title": "Just a high-quality display with no frills", "Author": "stabbim", "ReviewID": "R1EWDO9NAA3MID", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "First, my use case, which may not match everyone:1. I wanted a quality display. This meant 1080p and direct LED backlighting, not edgelit.2. Ideally I needed low latency, as this TV will primarily be used for gaming. In particular, Forza Motorsport, a game in which I already know input lag causes problems for me - I recently tried to play using a wireless controller after having used a wired one for years, and that caused me to drive like someone who'd never played before. So this quality in particular was critical. Needed a game mode or some way to disable image processing.3. I couldn't care less about smart TV features. I have several game consoles, a Chromecast, and if needed can hook up a PC easily. I have no need for the TV itself to do anything other than be a display. I don't even really need speakers, as everything goes through the surround receiver.4. Again due to the receiver, I don't have any need for lots of inputs. One HDMI port is enough.So, how did it stack up?1. Excellent. Now that everything's calibrated, I can honestly say this is the best looking display that I personally have ever used. The difference in contrast between this and an edgelit LED display is surprisingly noticeable.2. Again, excellent. The first thing I did once the TV was up and running was play some Forza Motorsport 4. With game mode turned on, there is no discernable difference between playing on this vs. my PC monitor (which is a good reference because it does no image processing whatsoever).3. None of that Smart TV crap here. You might be wondering why not having features is a good thing, regardless of whether I use them. Answer: price. I have no doubt this lack of features is the reason a display this good costs so little.4. Again, it fits my needs. 2 HDMI inputs, one componenet, and one composite. Not outstanding by most standards, but again I don't need more than that. So, if LG wants to save costs in this way it's ok by me.In short, I needed a dumb display. Just a panel to show a picture on, but a high-quality picture. It's perfect for that scenario.Other thoughts:This set has the best remote of any TV I've used. If, like me, you're a semi-enthusiast who changes picture modes for different source material and rages when the aspect ratio is wrong, you'll like it too. There are direct hotkeys for changing inputs, aspect ratio, picture mode, etc. No digging through the menus is required for those items, which is a joy.On that same note, the user interface in general is very intuitive and easy to navigate.No dead pixels for me. I'm not saying it can't happen, just mentioning my particular experience in hopes that a prospective buyer can get an accurate picture of how often it happens.I hadn't noticed it in the pictures before buying, but the bezel is really very thin. It was kind of funny to compare it side-by-side with the old set, a 40-inch 720p/1080i Samsung (which was very good in its day). The overall dimensions of the frame on both sets is nearly identical, yet the screen on this one is nearly 7 inches bigger.", "Date": "November 24, 2013"}, {"Title": "so far so good", "Author": "mld", "ReviewID": "R2CI7LJ6WL3MIT", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Just got this last week in the 47 in size to replace an LG 42 720p plasma that was around 6-7 years old. It's pretty good so far but there are few things that I dislike. It has a great picture quality in HD, but the picture looks worse than the 720p plasma when it is just standard definition. The older plasmas from LG had a very sturdy stand but this new one looks like a bobble head when you touch it a little bit. Another thing that I'm not quite used to is the screen size looks smaller than the older plasmas because the older ones had speakers on the side which made it appear larger (even though it is not). Another issue with the new TV is that is does not have inputs for your computer to make it a large monitor. This was a huge disappointment for me because I used our other TV to watch movies from other sources then just the popular Smart TV apps like netflix and you-tube. I guess I will have to go and buy an adapter for this purpose! ON the upside, LEDs do run a lot cooler than plasma tv's and they also use less power to turn on which is why my plasma broke after only 6-7 years of faithful service.", "Date": "September 19, 2013"}, {"Title": "Great TV for the money", "Author": "BILL FARMWALD", "ReviewID": "RAN2FF50SBSQG", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "We replaced our 35\" Toshiba Tube T.V. with this.Wonderful replacement.We don't play games or connect to Netflix, etc...so the sound is great and we have not felt a need to buy a speaker bar yet.The picture quality is great.I did need to work with the settings to get the picture we need for the lighting in our living room.I would highly recommend this product.", "Date": "June 7, 2013"}, {"Title": "Extremely satisfied.

I didn't want 3D.  It didn't need to be SMART (or what they call SMART - but that's another review).  I just needed the screen and it couldn't be too big.  The spot would only take a 42\", maybe 46\" set..  If you've looked at HD screens, you'll know there's a \"transition point\" around that size where most companies stop offering 720p and start offering 1080p resolution.  Price usually goes up at the same time.  When I first found this set and saw the price, I figured it was a 720p set.  Then I saw that not only was it 1080p but had a 120Hz refresh rate instead of 60 Hz and was a name brand set.  So I ordered it.The set has a low power consumption, is fairly light weight and has a pretty good picture. It's not plasma-quality,but the spot where I put it is too bright for a plasma anyway.  The controls/remote is fairly straightforward and easy to navigate the on-screen menu.The only real drawback is the input ports. It's a weird mix of coaxial, RCA, components, and HDMI - with not enough of the ones I really need.If you're a video-phile, a gamer or you just have to have high end tech - you'll find something to complain about with this set.  But if you want a good picture to watch and money left in you pocket to pay for the snacks and the cable bill; this is a good, inexpensive (not cheap) choice.", "Date": "March 23, 2014"}, {"Title": "great all-around TV for a relatively cheap price", "Author": "PuffaTree", "ReviewID": "R1GCTAC9L5CHDL", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Great size, great picture, standard sound is good.

The 47\" LG has the same footprint with a much narrower border.  We already have amazon and netflex streaming wireless thru our playstation, with home theater for sound, so didn't need the more expensive version with all that built in wireless streaming and didn't care that the t.v. speakers face the rear as we never use those anyway... I noted some complaints and solutions about the so called soap opera effect, where things seem almost too real for comfortable viewing. Rather than fiddle with my own custom settings, I followed another viewers suggestion that the game picture mode apparently turns off the variable back light system resulting in a more comfortable viewing for most people. I tried it on the same 10 minutes of Transformers with other settings and in fact found the game setting to be the most natural and pleasing factory setting.  So far, guests and family members have commented that they've never seen (nor heard) a better home system. In contrast to our beloved plasma, this more than holds it's own and has an expected energy consumption of only $10 per year. It's lighter, much cooler, occupies the same footprint on the console. I am very happy with it and have no problem recommending it. I also noted some complaints about the stand being wobbly and leaving the monitor tiltling a little forward. The instructions advise you to tighten the total seven screws securly to avoid this and voila, no problems on our end. Our t.v. is not center stage in our lives but it's nice to have it there ready to go when we're in the mood. That said, we knew it  would have an uncluttered appearance with clean lines and several guests have commented that it's an attractive t.v. It sits on a console at an angle in a corner of our family room and compliments the computer work station, fireplace, aquarium and furnishings without shouting look at me, I'm the focal point of the room.

As you click forward to the next channel you can only see the channels on that tuner (eg. DTV) so it will skip from channel 10 to 55, although you know there are many channels in between this. Once it has exhausted the DTV channels, it will switch tuners to the CADTV channels and allow you to cycle through those channels.

The first thing I noticed was that the stand would not swivel. The overview on this TV listed a swivel stand but the one that came with it was a stationary stand. I contacted LG and confirmed that it should swivel, after about 30 minutes and several readings of the part numbers they came to the conclusion that the wrong stand was packed in the box. They asked if the box had been opened prior to the purchase, it had not. My part number began with ABS and it should have started with ABA, the correct stand would be shipped no charge. I received the stand and it was the exact same as the one I already had. The part number on their packing list listed the part number as ABA but the stand I got began with ABS....again. Another phone call and another 30 minutes I finally got them to admit the wrong stand was shipped. I told them it must be an internal problem with the part numbers being pulled from a wrong location....or something to that effect. They promised to send the correct part and have it double checked before shipping. A week later no part, I called again and they don't even have a record of it shipping and I had to go through the whole part number, model number all over again even though I had their ticket numbers that detailed the exact problem.  Again tried to tell me I received the correct part the first time even though the numbers don't match. It doesn't help that I'm talking to someone outside of the US and there seems to be a really bad communication problem. As far as the picture goes, it is great unless you are watching sports or fast action movies. There is still motion blur even though it is advertised with \"virtually no motion blur\".

I was very happy with our old LG, but I was ready for a bigger size and wanted the cost savings of LED back-lighting.The most important thing to me in choosing an LG TV is the IPS panel. When I was shopping for our old TV I initially got an LG without the IPS (panel lottery). It looked great from straight on, but I could literally see the image quality change as I shifted my position on the couch. It was very disappointing and drove me nuts. I returned that TV to the online seller and went to the local big box outlet so I could hand choose a model with the IPS panel (as indicated by codes in the extended product number).  So for purchasing this new TV I went straight to the big box store and hand picked an IPS panel version of the 42LN5400 (they had both IPS and non-IPS there).  I love shopping off Amazon, but the panel lottery nonsense just isn't worth the risk of buying online.This 42LN5400 is great for my needs.  I run it as a monitor for my  HTPC.  Sound goes through a stereo receiver so I don't have anything to say about the built in sound. The size is perfect for my living room (it fit in my entertainment center with just millimeters to spare) and the viewing angles and color representation are superb.But that brings me to my one disappointment.  This TV has glossy finish on the screen. It seems all TV's these days have a glossy finish, and it is completely baffling to me as it does nothing but degrade the image quality. When the image is black, the TV turns into a (very dim) mirror. Instead of seeing nothing (black), I see reflections of myself, or the window behind me. Under certain lighting conditions the effect is diminished, but sometimes it is quite distracting. In the worst case, at a certain angle the reflection of the kitchen light  on the TV glass created a rainbow diffraction all over the image. Our old LG had a nice matte finish to the screen and reflections were never an issue. As I said, I am completely baffled why manufacturers do this.Despite the glossy finish, I am happy with the TV. The benefits of the IPS panel make this the best TV for me, and the reflection issue is manageable with lighting.", "Date": "May 29, 2014"}, {"Title": "odd \"please wait\" message", "Author": "James P \"james\"", "ReviewID": "RJIEZCMQYZ2BU", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "I have had this TV for less than a year (10 months), and for the past 5 months I get a \"please wait\" message on the screen.

However, be aware that the photos of the back of this TV posted on Amazon at the time of my purchase for the \"inputs\" look exactly like the inputs on an older model LG I already have; and that was the main reason I went with this TV.  The photos show (or showed at the time, they could have been updated since then) 8 RCA jack inputs.  All the descriptions on Amazon and at the LG website (at the time) stated it had 1 \"Component\" input and 1 \"A/V\" input.  This is not the case.  There are only 5 RCA jacks on the back of this unit.  So it has 1 true input for either \"AV\" or \"Component,\" but not both.To be fair, I was unable to find any other, contemporary TVs that now have the option of hooking up both; but the other manufacturers make this clear by stating clearly in writing that it's \"either/or,\" but not both, and/or by showing in a photo that there are only 5 RCA jack inputs.  So I had to purchase a switch and do some rewiring to keep both sources, the \"Component\" (3 wires for picture and 2 for sound) is dumbed down to the older \"A/V\" signal using only one wire for video.  Many of us still do have old VCRs and collections of Tapes we aren't necessarily eager to replace with DVDs and Blue Ray disks.It could be that LG simply thinks most people are too uninformed to know the difference or won't need both types of inputs; but it annoyed me that I purchased something thinking this product alone would give me a feature I didn't get, ultimately.  Maybe they were just in too big a rush to get the newer products out there and nobody out of too few people trying to do too much at the same time caught the discrepancy.

He told LG that LG USA site still says this is TruMotion 120Hz. LG said that they will update the info on their USA site.So when LG (or maybe other manufacturers, too) says 120Hz, this may be not refresh rate, but some other technically complicated value.

I wanted a 120hz for watching sports and fast action movies.After setting up the 42LN5400 and going through the menu's, they are identical in every way to the 42LN5300, and nowhere in the menu is an option for TruMotion (apparently there is on some models). In fact the entire TV is identical in appearance ecxept for the model number. It makes me wonder if there is any difference between the two TV's whatsoever, or is LG playing games? I cannot say for sure if the picture is clearer for sports, both TV's were actually quite good for fast motion and I haven't seen them side by side. Also when I press info button, both TV's displayed \"1080i 60hz\" however I do realize that virtually all television broadcasts are 60hz, and maybe that's what it is displaying, I really don't know, maybe if someone has a 120hz source, they could see what it says then and comment, that would be interesting to me.Side note: at least one other reviewer commented that on the back of the panel, it says (120-240v) 50/60hz.  I can tell you that this has nothing to do with the refresh rate of the panel, but rather the AC voltage and hz requirements for powering the unit.I think at the very least, LG owes us a complete explanation of what's going on here.

Tru-motion was never mentioned on the packaging or even in the manual. In fact, the only places it was ever mentioned were on LG's website and this amazon description. Anyone who has actually seen 120hz in action can tell the difference. I used several sources from blu-ray to x-box and there was no 'soap opera' effect, no 'too real' sensation and there was nothing 'kicking on'.

Thanks for sharing your thought.I felt sorry for having to write it for the product, as I don't have a problem yet with it. The reason is because due to delivery I have not seen my orders, they are in my neighbors' apartment.The review is all about delivery which makes me very unhappy.First, they are two days late for a two-day delivery. Meaning they are 100% late or take 200% of the time to deliver my order.Second, they delivered the package to my neighbor.  I understand that this is intended but I wanted to say is that this leads to a situation that I cannot have the package when I want it.  It was so late already.The name of the company is ONTRAC. I would personally avoid any amazon purchase if I sense ONTRAC could be involved. Also I would recommend people avoid this delivery service, especially for large purchases.", "Date": "December 4, 2013"}, {"Title": "Great picture", "Author": "dolle", "ReviewID": "RYRDEOTX5NQ03", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Like the television but can't beat the sound quality of the old Hugh analog analog television.

Very disappointed ! This falls advertising  all over on internet and in  all stores. Be aware!Update: I bought Samsung 60Hz(!) TV, put them next to each other and was watching for 3 days :))  I have to say it- Samsung 60Hz shows much better picture than LG 120Hz!!! The picture on LG TV is a bit lighter on standard setting  than Samsung on its lightest, the colors a little different(specially faces), but the quality of the picture is definatly more clear on SamsungP.S. It would not say anything on LG box how many Hz TV is, however on Samsung box it would say 120  CLEAR MOTION RATE which means 60Hz.
