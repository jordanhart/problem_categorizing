The colors are true to life, the HiDef is great and the overall picture quality is wonderful.  This was our first major Amazon online purchase and we were cautiously optomistic about buying our new TV online; however, we priced the same TV at local dealers and big box stores and as we saved $1000 over the cheapest local store we decided to buy using Amazon since no matter who we bought from the TV would have to be shipped here so why not try Amazon.  Delivery was faster than expected and came off without a problem at all.  It was all in all a very smooth, pain free experience; the way things should be.  The vendor the TV came from was extremely friendly, cooperative and answered all of my questions.  They shipped it to us at no additional charge, and the TV was packaged and crated extremely well.", "Date": "August 9, 2008"}, {"Title": "Great product great price great delivery time", "Author": "Ken Felderstein", "ReviewID": "R2M7F6WJJZB8OZ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Great product great price great delivery time. As a matter of fact, I was shocked that the product was sent by FedEX at no additional charge. I received the TV in three days.One note: FedEX policy does not allow the delivery people to go up steps. Therefore, if you are in a home/appartment with steps better get two strong people to help you (the TV is 150 pounds).Considering the TV is 65\" I believe the picture quality is outstanding especially in Blu Ray.", "Date": "August 18, 2008"}, {"Title": "Awesome!", "Author": "Cynthia J. Newman \"Cindy\"", "ReviewID": "RW9F5ZS12MN4U", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "We absolutely love our new tv.  We can't believe we haven't had an HD tv before this, let alone this huge tv with such a clear sreen.  The room that we have this in has windows surrounding it and for the first time we can actually watch tv (and see it clearly!) during the day.  Plus we saved over $1300 from the best sale prices we saw in stores by buying on Amazon.  Same warranty and consumer safety as well!", "Date": "November 24, 2008"}, {"Title": "worth waiting for", "Author": "toone", "ReviewID": "R236TVMO1W6C6A", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I saved and scrimped but it was worth it.Very nice tv but as with any tv of this type you NEED a sound system.", "Date": "April 10, 2009"}, {"Title": "Great TV!", "Author": "Ambrose Uba-chukwueke \"bruceuba\"", "ReviewID": "R1KOYMIZKK8Q4O", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I have waited 2 years to buy this TV.
