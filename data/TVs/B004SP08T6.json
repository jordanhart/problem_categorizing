No glare from floor lamps on the screen.  Had to get a better router though (not the tv's fault).  Great picture - enough adjustments unless you're a total videophile twiddler. Certainly looked better than the others in the store that day.  Nice and bright, only cost me $899 - what's not to like?", "Date": "January 9, 2012"}, {"Title": "Great Item!!", "Author": "Mark", "ReviewID": "RMZA2VOYMWSRS", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I recently got this TV through amazon and absolutely love it!! It has a great clear picture, and it's functions are amazing. I have only 2 complaints. The TV only does Media Direct to PC computers, and I own a Mac. Also the product was shipped through Home Direct, whom I do not really care for. But half way through shipping I had it changed to FedEx and had a great experience. The TV is fabulous!!", "Date": "March 9, 2012"}, {"Title": "good as advertised Philips bought on Amazon", "Author": "barkat", "ReviewID": "RZGX9U7O84CFC", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Had little trouble hooking up the laptop computer to the TV with and HDMI cable, and then configuring it...worked on the first try.

Can use as a computer monitor wirelessly also which is AMAZING! It would be GREAT if Apps could be added like Skype, or ebay, etc etc. Love Youtube  and Pandora  , Netflix is ok, would be better if they had an easier search method. Remote control would be better if I could program it to work the entire tv rather than having to use the old one for changing channels and this one for sound.Perhaps I should mention what for me is the most important and also the best feature of this TV, Phillips has the best support team I have ever experienced. They answer the phone and guide me through setup and any issues I had were immediately resolved! I give them a 10 .", "Date": "August 11, 2012"}, {"Title": "Awesome", "Author": "deb", "ReviewID": "R325DRCX1BHHFN", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Product delivered on time and was in great condition.  Initially had problems getting enough bars for the internet.  Contacted Phillips support and received excellent service.  They advised on the maximum range the TV had to be from the router, since mine was futher than recommended, they suggested I purchase a wi-fi extender.  Did so and have excellent service.  Love the built in apps and sleek look of the units.  Great Buy", "Date": "July 26, 2012"}, {"Title": "Decent Picture, TERRIBLE user interface, and inflated feature set...", "Author": "P.

It require patience to do the simplest of things.The biggest peeve Ive discovered with it is that the DLNA feature printed on the box is a bunch of {words that amazon would have probably censored out).  You have to download this exe written by a company other than philips onto a PC on your network to broadcast to the tv-  oh, and it doesnt even work for me, so who knows if it will work for you.Everytime I have to use the UI on this TV I regret buying it, but if you just want a simple 55\" TV it's great.If you buy this TV, buy it with a Logitech revue or something so you never have to use the UI.", "Date": "July 11, 2012"}, {"Title": "Great TV for the price", "Author": "Fletch", "ReviewID": "R3O3SI14N5O4BR", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I purchased this TV for 528.00 at Target and while the picture is not as clear, bright and sharp as my other sets, it is a good picture. My only complaint is the remote is weak. Using another remote solved that issue.  The wireless media connect is fussy about the PC connectivity, but I have had no issues with the built in Netflix,  Pandora or other services.

Not even a year later it won't turn on-- it just keeps restarting itself over and over. The splash screen comes up and as soon as that would normally go away, it turns off then back on, and repeats. I've left it running for hours and it keeps doing this cycle.I contacted Costco and we did some basic troubleshooting. I also did some on my own (checked A/C voltage, etc). Costco contacted the manufacturer and I was told I'd be given a call back from a local repair company that will come and check it out... but that was a week ago. I imagine when I actually DO get the call, it will be another week or two from there. Then if they can't repair it, another week or two before I'd get a replacement.When this TV works it looks pretty good. But now I'm worried this piece of crap is going to just be going out every year until the warranties are out. This seems to be a recurring problem for this model.Avoid buying this unless you want an unserviceable brick in a couple years. I had a feeling I should have gone with Samsung or Toshiba. Anyone else bothered that Philips also makes medical equipment?Update on Feb 9th, 2013: Still no contact from Philips or Costco, or any repair companies about having it repaired or replaced under warranty. I was given an issue number on it more than a month ago when I contacted them. No one is able to provide additional information at this time. This TV is garbage, and Philips is clearly not standing behind their manufacturer warranty.", "Date": "January 20, 2013"}, {"Title": "Bad television", "Author": "Holly", "ReviewID": "R2FHE8A7CMO3HS", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "Bought this television in the middle of November 2012, on January 13th the television would not turn on.I took it back to SAM's with the receipt.

It has twice failed with a power suppply issue. The first time (May 2012) it kept power cycling, i.e. on then off then on then off. Under warantee it took four weeks to get it fixed. It has just died again, July 2012, won't power on again. It has been eleven days and Philips just assigned a service provider to even come look at it. The service provider they contract with says they can't come to my house for another nine days. And, this doesn't mean they'll bring or have the right parts on hand. The bottom line is that in five and a half months, the TV has worked for three and a half.

I already own a 47\" HD TV, but I wanted a bigger one in the living room, but I also needed to find the best deal I could.  When I came across the Toshiba 55\" LED, LCD, HD, 3D, Wireless Internet connection Television at the price I found it for, I knew I had finally found what I was looking for, but I still had my doubts as to what the quality would actually be as I have never owned a Toshiba television before (I have owned several of their computers however), so I took a little time to think about it before I actually purchased it and I read the reviews, most were quite positive so I decided to give it a chance.  Boy am I ever glad I did, I thought my last HD had an excellant picture, in fact people use to comment on how good the picture was until I got this one, the picture is so clear and so detailed you feel as if you are actually there.  I think it is safe to say that I love this television.  The set-up was so easy, and connecting to the Internet was effortless I just told it to look for my home network and it found it, now I don't have to go through my game counsel to watch Netfix, and I love all the free widgets and Vudu and everything else you can get to online through this television.  It has to be one of the best purchases I have ever made.  The sound is good also, but I have my TV hooked up to my stereo system, it always makes the sound so much better when you hear it though an actual sound system.
