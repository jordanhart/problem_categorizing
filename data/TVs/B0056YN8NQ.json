I watched some 2D and was impressed with the picture, and then found the 3D channels on DirectTV and was impressed with the 3D rendition that the TV gave.During the 20 minutes or so that I watched 3D, before tearing myself away to go to bed, I didn't encounter any of the encoding errors that cause the momentary glitches that I have seen in movie theaters showing digital 3D, but I don't know if that is due to the TV, or DirectTV's delivery.I did check everywhere that I could, and the only reference to dynamic contrast was in the manual and it stated 5,000,000 to 1.  I wish that I could track down where the 1,000,000 to 1 contrast ratio referred to by other reviewers came from.The great service came because Amazon lowered the price by about $50 the day after I ordered the TV.  I called customer service and mentioned the \"TV Low Price Guarantee\" and they credited my credit card immediately.Great job Amazon.", "Date": "November 18, 2011"}, {"Title": "46\" Class Theater 3D(tm) Edge Lit Razor LED(tm) LCD HDTV with VIZIO Internet Apps\u00ae", "Author": "Bitzan", "ReviewID": "R1WUYLJPMR8N6L", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "First of all, Class Theater 3D(tm) is the newest version of Vizio's 3D, This product was released Late October 2011[you currently see the ads for this TV running on College football], I don't know how people made reviews before the product was released.Note:This is a LED LCD TV with a 240 refresh rate.You get 4 free pair of glasses (no battery required)This TV looks nice, its has a good slim design and is light weight (35LBS)3D:I have only plugged in my PS3 with COD MW2 and it was 3D, The game doesn't have anything coming out at It was crazy playing in 3D, you will need to get used to it but it was cool.I can't say I have tested the 3D yet nor what my feelings are for the 3D are, I will buy a 3D moving sometime soon and see how it is and then update my review.I am unable to get my Direct TV 3D channles to work, but I might need to see what I have to do and need to call Direct TV and see if I have to do something.2D:This is my first HDTV that I have owned, at first the wife was like \"the picture just looks different\", and I was like yes honey its because you can see everything now. the picture on this TV ranks up there with the best that I have seen at the store. I was unable to compare this TV to others at the store since it was not in stock, however I found it on Amazons website and got it and I have been super impressed since. I have it hooked up to my Direct TV and the picture is clear. Watching Blue-ray are..Amazing.Sound: The Sound on the TV is one of the best, if you want bass then you need to hookup your own speakers, but the sound quality out of the TV is good.Internet Apps: They work and nice to have instead of spending more money on devices that stream.. this one does it for you :)At first I was scare of getting a Vizio TV with Internet apps because of all of the reviews of the past models with them shutting down, before I got this TV I called them up and asked them if they have fixed that problem and they said \"we are in the works of making and pushing out the firmware fix for it, but shouldn't be a problem with the new TV's\"I haven't had any problems.", "Date": "November 8, 2011"}, {"Title": "Buzzing Noise", "Author": "J. Maehl", "ReviewID": "RL3BNNYV8T9FE", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I bought this tv last week from costco for $850.Straight out of the box it has this buzzing noise. It's not from the speakers, but from the back of the tv.I've read around the internet and it might be a problem with the power supply board and a faulty ground in the original pc board.The buzzing doesn't stop when the tv is muted. If you have the tv volume and level 15 you don't hear the buzz until the silence between commercials. The buzz is just too much and I'm going to be returning it to costco. Hopefully all of them their aren't like that due to a bad batch.Cons: Annoying unavoidable buzzPros: The channels looked great via my small indoor hd antenna. Much better then they ever did via the converter box on a non-hd tv.The wifi hooked up with no problem. The apps seemed to worked well and was really part of the reason for buying the tv.Besides the buzzing from the back of the tv the speakers sounded good and I'm a bit of an audiophile.-----------------------------------------------12/16/11 --Update--I went back to costco and got a second tv.  I lucked out and got one without the defective buzzing. There is a very slight noise, but it's not the same noise and it's not loud enough to be annoying. Costco covers their tvs for parts for 2 years.  After having dealt with the buzzing issue I bought the extended warranty.  I'm the guy that never ever buys those things, but being that it is a Vizio and not a Sony, Panasonic, or Toshiba I felt it necessary. With costco their extra warranty is through Squaretrade and only $20/yr for an additional 3 years so 5 years total.So now I just need to test out the 3d more as I wasn't able to see any 3d at all when I tried avatar last night. I was also bummed to see that in the apps that youtube is missing. I want to revise my review to a 4 star, but since I did have that initial defective tv, I'm only going to up it to a 3 star from the initial 2.-----------------------------------------------12/17/11 --Update--It took a while to figure out how to play a 3d blu-ray, but I finally got it. You have to change the settings in several places it seems. The it's hooked up with a panasonic 3d blu-ray player via a 1.4 hdmi cord. To be honest, I was blown away with the 3d in avatar on this tv. It felt as good or better then when I saw it in the theater.", "Date": "December 15, 2011"}, {"Title": "TERRIBLE COMPANY AND TV", "Author": "Justin", "ReviewID": "R4MK2U6ND1KMK", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I bought this TV at the end of December - the unit was shipped to the retailer December 14th and I picked it up on December 29th. The picture is fantastic, Vizio apps were a nice added touch, the internet hooked right up . . . and then I hooked my HDMI cable box up to it.Any HDMI cables broadcasting a signal to the TV create a high frequency squealing noise. If you're over 35-40 or don't have sensitive hearing and don't mind just turning the volume up a couple clicks its no big deal. For me at 28, it's maddening.I called Vizio and they were very prompt in having a repair technician come out to the house. They sent him out with a new main board, power board, and bluetooth module for my TV, as well as his own blu-ray and HDMI cables to test it. He tested and confirmed hearing the issue, much louder now that the case of the TV was off. He replaced the parts one by one, testing each time to see if it helped the problem and each time the problem was identical. After this Vizio escalated my issues and said they were sending me out a new TV. This is where things got ugly.The shipping company was so inconsiderate and incompetent that taking a half day off work wasn't enough, they completely missed their 4 hour delivery window by more than 2 hours and had to make me take a second half day to deliver the TV. When the TV finally arrived it was a refurbished unit with paint chipped off the stand mounting brackets and clear signs of wear and tear, I guess a new case was just too much money for Vizio to spend on a replacement unit for a TV that had left their factory less than 11 weeks ago. Icing on the cake, exact same identical issue as verified by their repair technician weeks prior.I refused delivery and called Vizio back. I got snotty service from their Utah CSR and the call center supervisor. It took threatening small claims to recoup a days lost wages and the full cost of the TV to get the issue escalated to their corporate office. When I got a call from Irvine the next day the CSR read the same script with the same 'I don't care' attitude and was more concerned with regurgitating the same 3 sentence replacement policy rather than using their head and getting someone involved who could help. I've since gone to a few retailers and verified that floor models of the TV are making the same high frequency squeal, audible as far away as 15-20 feet to my ears.I come from an engineering background, and told them on the phone from the start (as did their on site technician) that its a design issue with the electrical on the main board. Here I am two months later and countless hours wasted on the phone all trying to help a company out. It's so bloated and incompetent that each person I talked to refuses to even acknowledge there could be a problem with the TV design or involve someone that can speak to it.Two months ago I was excited about a US based electronics company and wanted to help them fix an issue and avoid a larger recall or worse - as with the Samsung LNT line - a massive class action lawsuit that would cost them millions. Instead, I'm now taking my TV back to the retailer for a full refund and there's no chance I'll ever own a Vizio product for the rest of my life.  Check out AVS forums, all the models have the same problem; 42, 46 and 55 inch, yet Vizio pretends it doesn't exist and they've never heard of it when there's hundreds of open support tickets for it published online.", "Date": "March 2, 2012"}, {"Title": "Ummm...why do I have a black screen", "Author": "jonesy's wife", "ReviewID": "R8UHNZ2YMODL5", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "My husband and I purchased this TV in mid Dec. 2011 from Sam's club. Within a couple of weeks, the screen studdenly went black but the audio was still on. Thinking it was user error we gave it a couple of days. It become obivous this was occuring once the TV warmed up. I also noticed the picture would start flickering prior to the screen going black. 16 days after we purchased it, I called Vizio and they thought it might have been some kind of communication error between the TV and satelittle receiver. They wanted me to try another device. So, the next day I connected our Playstation and watched the Thor DVD for about 15-20 minutes before the screen went black. I called Vizio and it was determine that there was a problem with the backlight and that it was NOT repairable. Vizio agreed to shipped a new TV to us but that was only because they got to hear my fustration about the whole thing. So, 9 days after that determination, we are still waiting on the replacement. I am only hoping this replacement will work the way a TV is supposed to.I wrote this review only beacuse I have read other reviews that older Vizio TVs had this problem (flickering and a black screen) and that this newer model should have corrected that problem. THAT IS NOT THE CASE.1/21/12 update: When Vizio placed the replacement order, we were told it would take 8-13 business days. On business day 13, I called Vizio to check on the status of the order b/c the website wasn't giving me any information. I was informed that they had some bad news and some good news. The bad news: the warehouse has no \"REMAKES\" in stock. The good news: they have some new TVs in the warehouse. My response was when I ordered the replacement I spefically asked for a new TV since the one I bought was just a few weeks ago was new. Vizio agreed that I should have had a new ordered from and then I got disconnected for like the 15th time. By then, I was just fed up b/c now I would have to wait another 8-13 business days. I called our local Sam's Club exactly on month to the day of purchase and explained our situation. He checked the stock and they had three. My husband and I went to Sam's Club that night and exchanged the TV, which is probably something we should have done in the first place.

I don't have a surround sound system, and I am very impressed with the great sound quality from the two speakers. The picture is awesome. All the features, internet connectivity, apps work great and setup was extremely easy. It even walked me through the step of setting up the remote to work with my blueray player. However, I am having the same high pitch ringing described in other reviews. Called Vizio and they gave me the option to return or wait a week for them to repair. I'm going to exchange this at Sams Club. I hope a new TV doesn't have the same issue. I will update when I hang the new TV.(Update)...new TV has same high pitch problem. Called Vizio support, did \"the dance\" of pushing buttons, unplugging everything, etc, etc...finally they agreed to send a repair team to my house. I guess there is a manufacturing defect, because I am now finding other online reviews that mention this same problem.  The fix, a repair man replace the power supply. I hope this works for me too, else I'm returning this TV for good.------2/3/3012 update-------------Repair man came out and replaced the powerboard.  Same high pitch humming/buzzing.  I called Vizio, they didn't hesitate, they are sending me a new TV.  So far I've gone thru 2 TVs and 3 powerboards, with same problem...my hopes are not that a new TV will solve this issue.

Not only do I love the picture and 3D, I love how I got the remote to work with all my connected devices. I have my Panasonic Receiver, Direct TV, Toshiba DVD/VHS, and best of all my PS3 all working with this remote. I like the idea of the internet apps, but I just wish they had more apps to choose from and plus Vizio gives you the opportunity to add your own app,, that's too cool.

Just wanted to echo the positive reviews and give it the great rating that it deserves.I purchased the set in late September, so I've had some time to evaluate most aspects of its performance. My sources are 85% HD cable (sports, documentaries, music...) and 15% Vudu streaming movies and music doc's (more on this later). I did purchase a Bluray player but haven't had a chance to pick up any discs yet! Have played conventional DVD's but this wasn't really a tough test for the TV. They look fine...- Directions and Connections: Fast and self-evident. Clear, thorough directions for set-up. I could use a bit more detail on some of the picture and effects setting definitions as there is some proprietary jargon, but I was able to work through what the setting means by just trying it...- Picture Clarity and Color: Fantastic with all sources. As other reviewers have stated, it's good out of the box, but I spent a few sessions playing with all of the settings, and the picture benefited greatly. The fine tuning is really worth it (I found this to be true with my old CRT set as well). Had relatives around over Thanksgiving and they were very impressed. Kept commenting on how great it looked. Blacks are very black, and color is natural and highly adjustable.- Smoothness/Refresh: Overall, very good. A bit of judder(?) on live sports but I am chalking this up to the cable speed (I needed a signal booster, so my source signal probably isn't ideal). Seeing none of this on dvd's or Vudu streaming. Just perfectly smooth and natural movement on the screen.- 3D: Wow. I love that the glasses are analog, not battery powered. I would not have purchased a set that used the expensive shutter glasses. We have spent a fair amount of time watching Vudu trailers, ESPN3D, and the Comcast 3D channel, and I am really surprised how much this enhances the viewing experience. I saw 3D as kind of a side-benefit that I might not use very much, but I have found myself, to the amusement of my family, watching live college basketball and football, glasses on looking like Buddy Holly, and really enjoying it. X-Games highlights are great, and full 1080i streaming in Vudu is kind of a revelation. I love 3D in theaters and wasn't sure that it would translate to the living room, but my fears were unwarranted. I really hope more 3D programming pops up on cable, especially sports. Love it.- Sound: Ok. If I could have given the set 4.5 stars, the -.5 would be due to the sound. It's adequate, but I didn't expect it to sound like my nice audio rig or a theater. I didn't really realize how, well, ok it sounded, though, until I picked up a Panasonic sound bar with a subwoofer. Wow. This set deserves better sound and even the modest sound bar greatly enhances the overall viewing experience. I would say that some kind of after-market sound system is essential for all viewing content. If you're going to put a big TV in your house, it should sound like a big TV.- Wireless Steaming, VIA: This is actually one of the features that I was looking forward to with this set and I have not been disappointed. As another review said, the set didn't pick up a full signal from my little Apple wireless set-up. Moving the unit to a more exposed location (it was under my desk) solved this right away and it's coming through loud and clear now. This really only affected Vudu 1080i content. Speaking of Vudu (I promise that I have no connection to this company! I just really like using it), since we dropped Netflix a while ago, most of our home movie viewing has been with cable on-demand, and it is fine. It comes through in 720i HD and looks really good. But then I hit the play button on a full HD Vudu clip and really saw what this set could do. Wow. We've been watching movies and music documentaries (the Classic Albums series is fantastic...) and the selection, interface, and quality is amazing. Honestly, I haven't felt the need to sign up for or use many of the other app's (I did connect to Pandora just for fun). Streaming definitely seems to be the way content delivery is going, and I am sold.Miscellaneous: Remote is really nice. Overall appearance of the set is fine. The black color blends into the background in the room. It doesn't have that very slick Samsung clear bezel look, but it seems like the effort and R&D; was put into the functionality of the set and not it's exterior design. It looks good hanging up in a very prominent location in our living room.Overall: I would be happy with this set if I had paid more money for it. For about $1000, I have a hard time believing that there is a better value out there for the kind of picture, 3D, and overall viewing experience than this Vizio (and the price is lower now than when it came out!).

Feeding Dish HD, Blu-Ray 3D, and AppleTV sources into it, all using HDMI connections.  While I've been impressed with the 3D performance (Avengers ROCKS!), my family will call me a TV picture fanatic in that I'm VERY picky about the quality of the image (I don't like inaccurate colors, modeling of faces, images which are too dark, and blurring of fast moving scenes).  I've owned HD TVs since they first came out in 720P form a dozen years ago, so I understand the technology and can see the differences in the images they produce (which is why I purchase them first based on what I SEE, second based on included technology and features).  Unfortunately I took a risk and bought this one online without actually seeing a demo.  Of the three TVs I currently have (this one, a 32\" Vizio, and a 55\" Samsung LCD 240Hz), it has the least pleasing image by far.  The Samsung...which is 4 years old...easily blows it away picture wise.  I've tried adjusting the image settings multiple times -- reverting back to the factory setting each time to start over.  Just can't ever get it to look as good as it should for how much this set cost.  Faces look modeled (shiny smearing), colors are OK but not great, scene dynamics just done \"pop\" like they do on my other two TVs, and worst of all this set has HORRIBLE purple fringing on fast moving scenes.  If you've never experienced it, you might not care (my wife thinks I'm crazy), but every time you have a chase scene or sports scene where people or objects move across the screen in rapid transit you'll see their outlines highlighted in purple - drives me nuts as you can tell.I rarely do not recommend the products I purchase because I do so much homework ahead of time that I'm normally very pleased with what I get.  This one is the exception -- I wouldn't buy it again, and I wouldn't recommend you do either.

I've had a Sony WEGA 800lb CRT gorilla for the past 6 or so years. I could tell you anything you want to know about most any computer device made in the last 15 years, but I know very little about HDTV arcana.2nd disclaimer: I have not used the built in tuner. This TV is hooked up to my HTPC and Xbox via HDMI. I cannot comment on anything tuner related as those tasks are handled by my HTPC.I've had this TV for a little more than 24 hours. Here are my first impressions:The Picture: incredible beyond words.  I know this is not a reference design television, but I have tweaked nothing on the display settings and with full factory defaults I have not one complaint. The contrast ratio (stated as 5,000,000:1 on the box) and 240 Hz refresh rate really play a major role in my layman's opinion. We watch a lot of Mickey Mouse Clubhouse around here and Mickey's ears and head are a deep solid black like pitch. There is no tearing evident at all. The color seems well balanced; again, I have not felt compelled to change anything. I'm sure a color calibration could help, but I'm not yet motivated to seek one out.The Sound: it's not that bad. I have a better HTPC sound system, but for a television, the sound is acceptable.The WiFi: I don't know if it's in a bad spot or if the antenna is bad, but it doesn't pick up my router as well as my other wireless devices in the same roomThe Remote: +1 for cool design. If you have fat fingers, the keyboard keys will seem tiny. My wife, however, could probably blog using the keyboard. I also like this it is a Bluetooth device which is less susceptible to interference and snooping than RF.

I initially purchased it because of all the great features and it was on sale.  I mounted it on a wall-mount in my bedroom and was initially pleased.  The picture quality (PQ) was crisp, bright and generally great.  I spent some time adjusting the PQ and obtained great results.  I connected a LG LSB316 soundbar using an optical cable to the TV audio out toslink connection.  Then the disappointment started.First, the soundbar sound would experience momentary drops from time to time.  The audio drop-outs would occur randomly.  At first I thought it was the satellite receiver but some testing proved the problem was the Vizio TV.  Then I started hearing a very low-volume, high-pitched whining sound.  This high-pitch whining emanated from the back of the TV, not from the speakers.  At times, I could hear the whine from accross the room.  At first, the high-pitched whine was low enough that I thought I could live with it.  But more and more often I was hearing the whine during all the quiet scenes.

This is one of the two.  It has all of the great features of my old Vizio (wifi, apps, and bluetooth remote) with the added bonus of 3D!  The 3D works almost flawlessly (almost because in order to get my TV to recognize my XBox as a 3D device I have to force the Xbox into 1080i although the Xbox and my tv are both capable of 1080p.  Not a major issue because Xbox games are not in 1080p when using 3D on any tv, however its a nuisance because I have to remember to change the setting back if I'm using my Xbox for non-3D content.*UPDATE* I received a replacement tv and teh issue is gone I can keep in 1080 now and it switches automatically to teh appropriate resolution when playing 3D gaming now *UPDATE END*  It displays a beautiful 3D image whether gaming or watching TV.  I'm dying to see what 3D movies look like in all their high definition potential with a bluray 3D player - maybe for Xmas.  I'm thoroughly impressed by the lower definition 3D formats so I can imagine it only gets better.  Bright colors, the glasses are light, and no ghosting at all on my set.  However, I haven't watched it from a side angle yet.  I suspect they lose a little based on my impressions of the set from side angles when watching 2D content - good thing its my house! ;)Now most of your viewing will not be in 3D, so 2D image is highly important.  That is where my last Vizio (which I returned) failed.  On this set, the 2D picture is really sweet.  The colors aren't as deep and rich as my other Vizio but I think that's because I have not color calibrated the new set (will update review after calibration).*UPDATE START*It turns out that the issue wasn't with calibration.  Some of these 5,000,000:1 models are actually 1,000,000:1.  Extremely deceptive to market your product as one thing and deliver as something completely different.  The customer service experience was unbelievably negative.  When I discovered that I was sent the wrong set it was 14 days from my purchase date (I should've returned to Amazon.com immediately) however, I gave Vizio the benefit of the doubt and contacted their customer service line instead.  BAD NEWS.  First I got a rep who cared nothing of my issue and blew me off.  Told me to send pics of the box I received and she would respond.  To this day no word from this \"customer service\" rep.  So I follow up and get a new rep.  They then ask me to send pics again, I send the pics, send more pics, I send more pics (I even emailed a video of the box showing that I received the wrong product).  They NEVER proactively called me, I always had to follow up to find out the status even though the rep told me normally it is only 1-2 days for a response.  They strung me along until this morning and then they told me that they don't believe there was an error and I have to keep the tv (\"its  a typo on teh box\").  Guess what today was - 2 days beyond my ability to return to Amazon.  That is really crummy to string someone along claiming you are helping them, just to get them past their right as a consumer to return your product.  So here I am stuck with a 1,000,000;1 tv when I paid for a 5,000,000:1 set.  It really disgusts me.  So sad I ever gave Vizio the benefit of the doubt.  This issue lessens the value of my tv as I'll never be able to correct the image quality as I expected.  It has been calibrated by a professional but this tv simply doesn't have the performance it is advertised as having or I was given the incorrect television and the company won't fix their mistake.  If I can upload pics to my review I'll upload shots of box of the 1,000,000:1 set I was sold under false pretenses. SAD!  Poor rating largely due to this issue.*UPDATE END**2nd UPDATE START*So after weeks of calls to customer service I reached my limit and called Vizio's local Better Business Beauru.  The problem was resolved the same day.  They suddenly found my complaint reasonable and offered to ammend the situation.  They still insited that it was a typo and offered me teh choice of a replacemnet TV or a free 3D Blu Ray player.  I opted for a tv replacemnet - I need the sound of mind of knowing I received what I paid for.  It took a bit to actually get the replacement processed - they dont have the most efficient systems.  However, I now have a replacemnet tv in my home.  I honestly dont believe it was a typo because my 2D picture looks significantly better - I can say the same for the 3D picture but it already looked marvelous.  Although I had to go to the ends of the earth I'm glad Vizio finally resolved my issue and gave me what I paid for and the tv looks great all around now.  I will now raise the score back up approriately.*2nd Update END*With my other Vizio, I was lucky enough to get a set that was so beautiful out the box that I didn't dare touch the settings.  Despite that, it is a sweet picture and I'm very satisfied.  I did observe the 2D pic from side angles and it tends to lose a little.  Colors change slightly and overall the picture is pretty flat.  Not the greatest for superbowl parties where guests may occupy all corners of the room but wonderful for a selfish jerk like me who doesn't really care as long as my seat is awsome.Features are pretty standard if you have an internet tv, Net Flix, Vimeo, and a few other good ones with a laundry list of filler and throw away apps.  However, the good ones are so slick you don't care about the filler garbage.  It recognizes devices just by plugging in the HDMI cord.  I plugged in my bluray and it knew the brand and model number instantly.  Also, if I'm watching cable tv and I simply press play on my bluray remote - my Vizio knows to change to the Bluray input and display my bluray movie.  Great little features like this make this one classy tv and with a little help form teh BBB an orginization that fixes their errors.", "Date": "September 23, 2011"}, {"Title": "NEVER! NEVER!

Trust me, if you plan on buying this tv online or at a store, check out costco's website review of the tv  . For all the 42, 46 & the 55\" has this problem.

I went through 5!! Tvs within a whole year and spent over $200 to replace my receptacle/ wiring, calling the technicians to check the our transformer . Finally! Vizio decides to refund my money 6 weeks ago and I'm still in the process of waiting for my refund (Estimate 4-8 weeks)  A type of blue Ghosting when the screen is in motion (up, down, left, right). If you can live with it then go ahead and buy it but your most likely to return the tv. So I'm telling you look at a different Model of Vizio (E-Series is pretty good and the 42,47 or 55 M3D*0KD)or just go with another brand. I'm not going to make that mistake again of not doing my research before I buy.

And, it is hard to tell whether it is powering up or just not on yet so you have to wait 30 seconds or so and then if it does not come on, click the remote's power button again which will either turn it on or perhaps turn it off and you have to start over.  Very frustrating.Second,  the blue tooth function has gone away on occasion on the remote and even when the blue tooth is working some functions work and some don't.Third, I have lost the internet connection on my \"smart tv\" and I have gone through the trouble shooting tips and can not restore it.

I only discovered that it's a pretty common issue for this model and it's 42\" counterpart. If you crawl on other forums you will see that many people complain about this problem. All of them contacted Vizio and were sent a TV repairman. The Humming comes from one of the transistors so it is a production fault and it is just a matter of luck if you get a TV that doesn't have the humming. The mechanic changes one or two boards and the people report that the humming diminishes, but doesn't really go away. I called Vizio and when I heard the same advice I said that there is no reason for them to send a repairman because I don't think that a one day old TV should have any problems and if it does, back to the store it goes.I have to note that it's Humming from the board on the back of the TV and not the speakers, the TV was connected through an amplifier and the humming just drove me crazy!2)Ghosting while watching 3D. There was extreme Ghosting while watching 3D content from Verizon and my PS3, both with the 240hz and 120hz, I changed the smooth motion on and off and no help, and as you know, once you've seen it it can't be unseen!I do have a 55\" XVT model in the house and never had problems with it (have it for 2+ years) and I do think that Vizio is a great company that gives an excellent alternative to companies like Samsung and Sony but this particular line has its problems.I eventually returned it and bought an LG LW6500 that has the same specs as the Vizio but is only $1099 and has no reported problems online so I have my fingers crossed till I get it.", "Date": "January 11, 2012"}, {"Title": "Pop sound and smoke", "Author": "Bob", "ReviewID": "R1NYAVLJ5QJT8L", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I bought this tv at sams club.

I get the Netflix app on the TV thru my bluray player so no problem. My set was advertised as 120 HZ so I assume it is. I picked this TV after a lot of research into why this TV was so inexpensive compared to other TVs of the same size, it is the refresh rate. The higher the refresh rate the more hardware they have to pack into the TV to control flicker and bleed, I have neither.

Undoubtedly, everybody giving these reviews has never seen a Samsung LED picture. Took this back and exchanged for another Samsung and BOOM> great picture again, and vibrant colors.

Seemed to go pretty smoothly, although I noticed some buttons on the remote did not completely work when pressed. I ignored this and proceeded to hook up my computer to watch a SBS of Avatar. I have to say.... I was somewhat disappointed. The 3D effect was not nearly as detailed as I remember it being in Theaters. Something was definitely missing in comparison. Also tried SBS of Despicable Me, which seemed to look a little bit better. Maybe it would be better if I had a 3D bluray player? I am going to try going to best buy on Saturday and seeing if I can test out my version of Avatar on their LG passive TVs display just to compare it to the Vizio. I know some people at the store so hopefully they will allow me to do this. That seemed to be my only complaint about the TV; until tonight. This is what prompted me to write the review. I tried playing with some of the Vizio apps (one of my main reasons for getting this TV aside from the 3D) and the TV just randomly turned off. Now every time I try to go to the Vizio apps it turns off. The remote also functions infrequently. Thankfully amazon has 30 day free return as I believe I will be forced to return this TV, as much as I wanted to like it. I believe Vizio may still have a few bugs they need to work out......... Will update whether 3D is better on this TV or the LG sometime Saturday or Sunday this weekend.Mind you the 2D picture on this is excellent and it is a BEAUTIFUL looking TV.
