My only requirements were that it be reasonably priced, at least 32\", and interface with my older DVD player with component connections, and my older VCR with composite connections (yes, my kids still watch the occasional VHS movie).  Frankly I didn't care if it was internet connectable for Netflix, or had a specific refresh rate.  After viewing a bunch of TVs and brands side by side at my local \"Good Purchase\" store, including generic knock-off brands, it was clear this model of Panasonic simply had the best picture for the price.  The contrast, colors, and view-ability of the IPS panel really stood out against other TVs in this price range. After checking Amazon, Amazon had the lowest price anywhere.  The box came with a hole in the side, but I guess that is not necessarily the fault of Amazon.  Still the TV is not double-boxed when shipped, so fortunately whatever made the hole did not get through far enough to damage the TV.  The TV was easy to affix to the stand (8 screws total) and the setup of the channels is VERY easy. The TV displays instructions for each step of the way so you always know what is going to happen or what to do if you want to exit a menu area. Of course at 32\" it does seem a bit smallish compared to my awesome Sharp 46\" TV in our main family room, but it will suffice for the amount it will get used.  Of course it would be nice to have double the connections on the back, so I guess realistically I would give it 4.5 stars out of 5, but it does come with 2 HDMI, 1 Component, and 1 Composite. For the price of this TV it is what I would expect.  I would rather have  fewer connections and a quality picture than a sub-par picture with twice the connections. This would also make an excellent TV for a bedroom and for that you would likely not need that many connections anyway. Panasonic has a sleeper with this gem with its quality picture, IPS panel and at a very competitive price $three-twenty-nine with free shipping!", "Date": "May 24, 2011"}, {"Title": "Very nice budget HDTV", "Author": "Christopher Joseph", "ReviewID": "R32L3OYZK8GYN6", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Just received mine today. Was quite easy to set up once I figured out the stand slides into a panel at the bottom of the TV. I own a Panasonic 42\" and set this one to the same settings since there are no real calibrations posted online yet since it's a newer model. It looks very good and comparable to the 42\". Black/night scenes seem a little soft but it's nothing to really complain about.Pros:Price ($343 1 day shipping)Sound Quality - I was replacing a 2007 Sony LCD and this sound blows the other away. I did hook it up to external speakers but the sound out of the box is not bad at all.Picture Quality - If 720p is fine for you you should have no problems with this TV. Non-HD channels are average quality and the HD ones are nice.Weight - It was surprisingly light, only 22 pounds with stand and 19 withoutCons:Only 2 HDMI portsI was not able to program my cable remote using the codes provided for Panasonic.

Did not want to change the size due to the smallish room that i currently have the TV fixed, and decided against FullHD, as most of the contents i watch are not even 720p, hence a waste of cash. Checked out several products including products from Sony (BX300 and BX320), Samsung (C350 and 450), Sharp, Philips, LG, etc.Found the Samsung, Sony and Panasonic were among the better panels with richer colors in the budget 32\" market. Samsung had the advantage on features, Sony on features, with Panasonic playing middle ground.  However the Sony BX320 had some issues with tearing when playing videos (I did not notice, but seen on several forums) and decided against it though i liked the built in FM tuner (takes away the need for a radio in the room).  The Samsung had very little to fault, and also provided the most features with its built in USB media play back capable of playing all formats, including NTFS drives, however the habit of Samsung using different panels made me look around.The Panasonic C3 just appeared into the market as the 2011 model, and has panel that seems to be much better than the the Samsung and Sony to my eyes, and this was my key decision maker.  The Panasonic also had good viewing angles and a good feature set.I tried several file formats using a USB drive (FLV, MKV, XVid, Divx) and they played with no issues.  The colors as vibrant, and i reduced the back lighting from the default 100, as i did not need that so much.  The asian model features both an USB and SD card, while the US version only has SD card.Some areas that i felt could improveAvoid setting the picture mode to Dynamic, as the software tries to optimize based on the content, and the algorithm is still not that great.Audio from the built speakers are decent and loud, but muted when playing files from the built-in video player.

We ordered this June 27, and by mid-September it's broken.  We'd have it on a few hours a night, usually weeknights only, so it wasn't really heavy use.The worst part about it is how bad Panasonic's customer service is.  This TV only qualifies for warranty repair where you have to bring it to the repair shop (not in-home).  Ok, fine, it's a cheap one, I understand.  I live in NJ, right across from NYC.  The only way the customer rep could search for repair centers was by zip code.  All of them in or through NYC.  I don't think they have any idea how ridiculous it would be to try to get a 32\" TV through the city to get to a repair shop.  It's not just a \"hop in the car and take a quick trip down the road\" kind of affair, much less getting a TV anywhere on a bus or train.  After an hour later and having to get a supervisor involved (who had the same problem even though I kept repeating I need a place in NJ), the supervisor was able to \"find\" a service center a few miles away (and a few hours travel-time closer).  It was ridiculous.  You can't search for service centers by city and state?  They even referred me to finding service centers myself online.  Which brings up a page saying to call the help line I was already on for Viera \"Concierge\" service.  It's a joke.  Then I feel like the ahole at the end of the call by the sound in their voice.We still can't believe we have to go through this crap with a TV less than 3 months old.  I did not try to contact the seller, because the return period is up and it's really not their fault--the TV worked great up until it died.  And go figure, we have a bigger Panasonic Viera in our living room that's been going strong for 3 years now.  Bad luck I guess.

It finally started messing up on me so I looked for something new.  My first TV had been a lower tier brand but a higher end model for that company.  It performed very well and I was sad to see it go.So fast forward to 2012.  The 32\" TVs can be found for much less and I thought that there would be an increase in quality just from a technological stand point.  I thought I would save myself a little money a go with a lower tier brand again.Well I was very wrong about that.  I picked up a store's house brand 32\" LED TV that seemed to look decent in the store.  I had all the features I needed and then some.  When I got it home, it was a whole different story.  The picture was pretty bad as far as colors go.  It required constant menu adjustments for almost every single show that I watched.  That's unacceptable!Most of these TVs look good with HD source. That is their selling point after all.  However many of us still watch a large amount of SD sources.  We have tons of DVDs, broadcast TV, older videogame systems, and such.  Finding an HD TV that can give acceptable SD performance can be a bit of a pain.  That said, standard definition was an absolute terror on this TV.  Images were splotchy and blurred.  Text was jagged and unreadable.Enough was enough.  I returned it the store and traded up for this Panasonic TV.  What a difference a brand makes!  I paid $50 more for this TV than the house brand.  So let me just go ahead and get this out of the way... \"Don't buy the house brand!  Stick with the top tier brands!\"This TV has been a joy.  I turned it on and was immediately welcomed with rich color, accurate blacks and wonderful contrast.  Even the low energy mode, which is what I use the most, looks pretty great.  Standard definition, the real barometer for me, is also excellent.  Everything is pleasantly clear.  Text is legible and there are no jagged lines to worry about.I already knew that HD performance should be great.  It was good on all the TVs I have tried.  The Panasonic did not disappoint.  I have couple it with a Blu Ray player and Xbox 360, both connected by HDMI.  The picture looks outstanding with these sources.  There are countless ways to modify the picture, but I find that I don't have to make too many changes.  Other TVs made me have to tinker with the picture settings quite often.  I think it's a compliment to this TV that I didn't have to make too many adjustments.Now there is of course a widely held belief that you need a professional to come set up or \"calibrate\" your TV for you.  They are supposed to be able to give you the best picture your TV can provide.  Well that's fine and well for those who can afford it.  Most of us are already done after what we had to fork over for our TV.  The thought of adding another hundred dollars or so to have someone adjust the settings can be a little off putting.  I don't plan on doing it.  The fact that I have been happy with this TV without making too many changes means that I expect to remain fully satisfied like I am now.I really have no complaints about the TV.  I can be found on sale for under $300 frequently.  It's a good buy.  Everything I put on it looks good.  Video games give me no noticeable lag.  It has a sleek and well made look to it.Let me add that people should stop expecting any kind of fantastic sound from these slim TVs.  My first gen HDTV had front mounted speakers but was considerable deeper than TVs of today.  It had the best sound of any I've owned.  This TV sounds good enough, but most people would want to run the TV through a surround sound system or at least a stereo setup to get a good sound.  That goes for any of these slim TVs.  People make countless complaints about that one factor, even giving the TV a bad overall review even if the picture was great.I'm just putting that out there so people will know what to expect these days.For my money I have found that staying with LCD is the best bet.  LED TVs seem to look worse than LCD until you go up to a higher cost range.  Plasma TVs are still looked upon as being the best slim format TVs that you can buy.  I would have gone that route if I could afford it.  I couldn't afford it, so I stuck with LCD.  As far as the 60HZ refresh rate goes, I don't have much problem with it.  Even my first HDTV didn't give me too much trouble.  I have never had any prolbems when watching fast moving images.  For some reason it's only when a camera does a rapid pan that I get the harsh artifacts of a 60HZ response.  Still the artifacts are brief and this mostly happens only when watching something live like a football game.  Movies and videogames give me little to no problems in this area.I should also mention that I still subscribe to standard definition cable but I get a lot of free over the air HD channels on this TV and they look great.  One of the house brand TVs I tried, couldn't even find the over the air channels.  I'm very happy with this TV and I hope this review has been helpful.PS: Why 4 stars out of a possible 5?

This set appears to have no deal-breaker problems.While this is not the best 32\" television out there, for the money, it cannot be beat. Keep in mind this is a 720p set versus 1080p, however, the quality of the picture is very impressive and it is bigger bang for the buck compared to expensive models. While not as good as a 1080p set, those cost nearly double and are only slightly better than this. Please note, the features are pretty basic, but there is still a lot of TV here. Set-up takes only minutes, adjustments are simple and effective, the sound is not remarkable but is acceptable, and picture is simply magnificent for 720p... far, far better than expected... clean, sharp and bright.

If you want a great TV in this price range, and know that 1080p and a billion ports isn't that important for a TV this size, then I suggest this TV.One more thing I want to touch on is the sound quality because a lot of fine TV's get bad reviews based on speakers alone; you don't have to worry with this TV.  The speakers sound great and a lot better than a lot of TV's I've listened to, based on the space the TV is in.

I researched the options pretty thoroughly, and I was most influenced by one person who was a bulk buyer of TVs for installation in hospitals and nursing homes. He has, he said, seen pretty much every 32\" in this price range, and he thought this one was far-and-away the best. So I had Amazon ship me one overnight for just a hair over $300.Physically the set is simple, attractive, and unassuming. Another family member just bought the Sony Bravia KDL-32BX310, a very similarly-spec'd set (without IPS however), which has a very slim and good-looking profile, trimmed in white on the back. While the TC-L32C3 is almost identical from the front, it is probably twice as thick and not very attractive from the back (ventilation grating, etc.). This is irrelevant to me, but I thought it was an interesting difference. (Maybe the IPS requires the box to be thicker?)As for picture quality, I really can't imagine how an image could look sharper. If the 1080p version of this set (the U, E, & D series) is higher resolution, I doubt my eyes could discern it. The image is pixel-perfect to my eyes, with excellent viewing angles and a wide variety of customization options (with configurable presets). Audio quality, and especially volume, is also very good. I am not a TV-watcher (movies and Apple TV/iTunes streaming only, really) but I find myself making excuses to watch more things just so I can look at this display.I personally don't like the super high-res, high frame rate style of video (that I call \"Soap Opera Video\") that you see sometimes on commercials and such. I prefer cinema-style video, if you know what I mean. So maybe that biases me against 1080p, 120Hz displays etc., but as far as I'm concerned paying more (often WAY more) for video that looks marginally better, at most - or just different, at least - doesn't make much sense.

If we'd bought a 1080p TV I doubt we'd notice the higher resolution.Major advantages for this TV are the light weight (it can be easily moved by one person), energy efficiency, image quality, and sound quality.  It's Energy Star rated, and the federal Energy Guide sticker that came with our TV estimated its yearly energy cost at only $9 even if it was used 5 hours every day for a year.  Most comparable models range from $11 to $25 per year in energy costs, so this is an extremely efficient TV (good for the environment and your electric bill).  The image quality is what makes this TV really stand out.  It has good color reproduction, very dark blacks, and an extremely wide range of viewing angles.  It uses IPS technology (the type of LCD panel found in the iPad and iPhone 4), which results in better colors and much better viewing angles than TVs that use older, cheaper TFT technology.  The sound quality is also surprisingly good.  In general, the speakers that come included with TVs are very poor quality.  We were somewhat surprised to find that the speakers on this Panasonic work quite well -- better than the speakers on some expensive 50\" and 60\" TVs that I've seen.  We had a set of external speakers that we were planning to connect, but ended up sticking with the included speakers because we were perfectly satisfied with them.One more thing that we liked about this TV is that it has a nice, simple, understated black exterior -- no silly, distracting \"Touch of Color\" strip like the Samsung LN32D450 that we also considered.  The emphasis is all on the actual display.", "Date": "September 21, 2011"}, {"Title": "Yes, it is an IPS Panel (Fantastic!)", "Author": "James E. Ranshaw", "ReviewID": "R61L6A80GELMW", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "The product description was a bit confusing, first saying it was an IPS panel, and then amazon's chart says its just LCD. It is in fact an IPS panel, which means the colors are consistent at all viewing angles, and they look great. I have another 42\" Panasonic with IPS, and it looks just as good.My only complaint was the same as another reviewer, and that is this TV does not fit well with low profile wall mounts. The connectors in back point to the rear, instead of downward, so you need about 2\" at least to get it to fit without interference. My wall mount was probably 1/2\", so I had to add spacers between the wall and the mount. Also, the four holes on the rear of the TV were inconsistently deep.. meaning the top two work fine with my previous screws, but the lower two holes were shallower and the screw required either trimming or a spacer (I used a spacer). So, it wasn't the 2 minute job I expected when swapping out this TV with my old Vizio that burnt out, but it worked eventually. If you have a wall mount that is a bit off the wall, there shouldnt be an issue.TV is awesome though.

I must say I am disappointed at the picture quality.  The unit arrived promptly, was well packed, and easy to set up.  It took several minutes for it to find all our digital and analog channels.  The remote worked well and the adjustment functions were logical and easy.  First of all, I noticed that this was not a thin screen like the LCD units I had seen in the local stores.  This set is as thick as a plasma, at about 3.5 inches.  Second, it is heavy at over 20 pounds, and probably not something to hang unless you purchase a bracket that would hold this unit.  Our biggest problem was the picture.  It was very dark with standard settings, and not sharp.  We have cable and expected a picture at least equal to the old-fashioned tube set this unit replaces.  Not to be.  We have jacked up brightness and backlighting to 90% and played with color and tint.  To me the picture is still dark and disappointing.  We will continue to fiddle with this but I was expecting a great picture right out of the box.  Maybe the LCD does save on power, but like most people we are most interested in a good picture.

A smaller TV just would not have the features available at the 32\" level, and a larger TV would not fit on the table top we had available.  We selected the Viera because its sound system is superior to that of other TVs in the 32\" class.  And the picture is excellent, and it can be adjusted so many ways (including aspect ratio) that anyone can have it the way they want.  The inputs and outputs solved many of our problems.  For example, I am hard of hearing and my wife is not.  But the use of a digital optical audio cable allows me to channel TV sound into my hi-fi amplifier for custom treatment and output to my earphones.  Really neat!

SDTV settings are OK at basic levels, with contrast and backlight as high as you can stand, which will probably be the maximum. Everything else can remain at 50, and any tweaking for SD picture will be minimal.For HDTV, none of the default presets are anywhere near what they should be. Here's a rundown of the crucial settings that need tweaking:SAMPLE FILMS TESTED: Transformers 3 (bright colors, heavy detail), Se7en (pitch-black darks, \"horror\" look), Alien Vs. Predator: Requiem (A film with a notoriously bad picture to begin with, having ultra-heavy darks that make the film practically impossible to see and horrible over-saturation from the source film--an example of how well the TV handles what was originally a bad picture in theaters), No Country For Old Men (variety), and The Shining (older film on Blu-ray).Contrast/Backlight: 100Brightness: Greatly dependent on the source, but has the best quality at zero--for some extra-dark scenes in films, though, this isn't feasible.Sharpness: ZeroColor Temperature: CoolAI Picture: OnEverything else can be set at 50 or normal.All static reducers disabled, as they will have the opposite effect on an HD signal.Brightness and sharpness at *zero*? Yep, that's what ultimately gave me the best picture, and they're both very important changes. Basically, this particular TV gives little room for customization, and the sliders generally do not have a particularly strong impact on the picture. Because all Blu-ray movies are necessarily 1080p, the 720p down-conversion is going to be a serious pain, and everyone should know that. But that's why a larger and much clearer 1080p TV costs so much more. Don't expect the same from both.Having said that, even at zero, the brightness and sharpness placed at zero are not nearly as extreme as a larger 55\" Viera using an LED backlight, in which its base settings are actually ideal for most films. The difference in tweaking, though, is huge. With brightness at 50 on this TV, blacks tend to look a little too bright, and of course any higher than that and it looks horribly washed-out. Depending on the film, you might be forced to bring this slider as high as 50. Transformers 3, which is almost always using bright and vibrant colors, looks gorgeous when its deep colors can come out while they're not restricted by the brightness setting. However, certain scenes from AvP and Se7en are nearly pitch-black, completely masking any character's face, which means you can't expect to watch films with that kind of color scheme. But if the film can cooperate with it, a setting of zero provides the clearest picture while maintaining key bright areas. This can probably be chalked up to the AI Picture setting, which boosts bright areas of the screen so as to make them stand up to the setting and maintain an absolutely gorgeous picture, especially for a down-conversion. You can *almost* get the \"wow\" factor this way as you would a very large LED TV. In fact, you probably would be able to get that if smaller TVs such as this one supported motion enhancing. Unfortunately, this one, at 32\", definitely does not qualify for that selling point.The sharpness is very odd on this television in that it seems to be far too jagged even at 50. It's so bad, in fact, that a setting of zero provides what looks like a normal \"50\" setting on most other TVs. Even at a dead zero, the picture does not look at all washed-out, blurred, or in any way hindered. It does help significantly with the jagged edges due to the 720p conversion, though. This does not appear to be strongly affected by the source, so it can remain at that setting safely. I have yet to watch a Blu-ray or play a Playstation 3 game in which the sharpness, being at zero, is a bad thing, and only looks worse if it's turned up.Note that it's important on an HD signal to turn off static reducers meant for SD, as they will have the exact opposite effect, increasing static. Unlike larger Panasonic Vieras, there is no \"Auto\" option that detects when you're watching SD versus HD, meaning this is something you would have to change manually every time you switched from one resolution to the other. But you will notice a significant increase in the level of graininess if these are turned on when an HD picture is being projected, so definitely keep them off for anything other than SD. This includes DVDs being upscaled.The color temperature set at \"Cool\" instead of the neutral setting removes a lot of the excess red from the screen that is there if you just take it out of the box. \"Neutral\" is actually too warm for this particular set, so setting it to cool is something you will probably set once and keep it that way. In every film I've tested, \"Cool\" definitely provides the best color, while anything higher saturates the picture tone with excessive reds.As with all TVs, this TV has its own unique configuration that works only for itself. In this case, drastically changing several picture options actually improves the quality very significantly. However, as I've found out, this does not at all apply to a 55\" LED Viera, which requires far higher brightness and sharpness settings to look its best. I tried similar settings on one and in return got an extremely dark and unwatchable picture and a slightly washed image. Part of that is because of 1080p versus 720p and also LCD versus LED backlighting.Finally, just to reiterate the one confusing \"feature\" here, \"Game Mode\" does absolutely nothing noticeable on this set, but it's clear that Panasonic included it because it's also included on the Plasma models where it actually serves a purpose of preventing burn-in. The only thing Game Mode does is turn off all the options that would cause burn-in on a plasma set if they were turned on. On anything other than their Plasma sets, though, this setting is useless, and serves no purpose at all. There is no change in the picture as far as I can tell, and despite that the advertising claims that this improves motion, this does not appear to be true, and I noticed no change in fluidity whatsoever. There's really no reason to use this mode on an LCD screen, and is very likely on there because Panasonic didn't want to simply take out a supposed \"feature\" that existed on its earlier Plasma models, using it as nothing more than a selling point. In reality, though, this setting does nothing at all on this set besides purposelessly disabling a couple of display options.In any case, this is an excellent midrange TV to be used as a spare. You obviously can't expect anything a larger 1080p would do, but for comparable sets, this is very likely one of the best LCD choices there is. Just make sure you have custom settings for both SD and HD sources, as the presets included are all worthless.", "Date": "May 31, 2012"}, {"Title": "good buy", "Author": "jozz", "ReviewID": "R12VBQURSYYJGK", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "this tv is a good TV it works well, and nice looking .I never had anyproblem.

However, in the future I will adjust my comments if necessary.I originally purchased the Vizio e-series LCD 32in 3D tv (twice) and returned it.  The Vizio had a loud hum or buzz that would happen when the brightness was NOT at 100.  I didn't want the brightness to be up at 100 all the time so I gave up on that tv and brand.  So I narrowed down the problem to be a bad power supply after constant researching.  I did more research and found either the panasonic 32in 720p LCD or LG LED 32in 720p.  I wanted a sharper image and the LG offered that but had one major drawback, which turned out to be the sound.  After reading the comments of some people not being able to stand the quality even though they were not expecting much was a major change in my selection.  Supposedly the speakers were 5 watts (not verified) and no bass.  I decided against the LG and purchased this Panasonic.+ Picture quality is very good on this TV for being a 720p LCD.+ Sound quality in my personal opinion is excellent when compared to other sets.+ Stand for the TV is higher quality (sturdy) compared to the Vizio plastic junk.+ Setup was simple+ Excellent for a bedroom+ Gets the job done- Would like to have more hdmi ports- Packaging was OK but Vizio had it better.  Vizio also included a screw driver Panasonic did not..- No other negatives at this timeIf you are on the edge about getting this television I would say go for it.  I would have to say you would enjoy it and the ratings for it show this is a quality tv.UPDATE MARCH 3, 2012I am giving an update on the panasonic after using it for a few months.  I stand by my original comments.  This TV for the price is amazing.  I would say the two biggest things that stand out the most today is sound and picture quality.  I have been using the TV regularly and notice that it takes maybe at most 5 seconds to turn on and have picture quality - pretty decent.  Menu to adjust settings is simple and I especially like how easy it is to sleep time the TV.  Simple to change the inputs from cable to HDMI - good response.  Hooked my PS3 up to the TV and and everything works great together.  I think Panasonic made a quality product and I would recommend this TV to anyone.UPDATE JULY 14, 2013I know most people may not review the product after the first week, month or year but I wanted to continue my updates on the Panasonic.  I received the TV back in December 2011 and would say it gets a fair amount of use.  The picture quality on the product is still great and the sound is still rockin.  I have noticed on minor issue with the TV..  When the volume on the TV hasn't been turned up or down in some time using the remote it will seem to respond extremely slow.  For example, I turn the TV volume up from the remote and receive a slight delay in the screen showing volume going from 5 up to 6.  I know this is not a major issue but one that I have noticed over time.  I still would recommend this if you find one at a low price.", "Date": "December 28, 2011"}, {"Title": "Panasonic TV", "Author": "Suzanne Strohm", "ReviewID": "R2R3PZW91NJRWJ", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "For the price it is a very good second TV.

BUYER BEWARE!-----------As for the TV: I am still getting used to the menus and learning about the TV itself.  At this size, 720P seems the same as 1080i, so that is not an issue.  As a matter of fact, I can see a difference on my 60\" between 720p and 1080i.I scanned my cable system feed directly into the Antenna connector to bypass the cable box since this cable box is not HD, but direct on cable is.  To watch HD I use the TV input, Video 4 for the rest of cable channels.One feature some TVs have is when manually storing channels, it displays the channel while stepping through to save or erase.  This set does not.  A little annoying while programming, but will not matter when done.Like I said, the cable box is not HD and found that this set does not have an S-Video input.

Unfortunately, receiving it coincided with me being newly released from the hospital and still sick.  I noticed the issue with the color pretty fast, but didn't return it out of pure exhaustion.  So that part is my fault.As for the sharpness of the picture, it's fine.  I don't know that it's as good as the five star reviews, but I don't have a lot to compare it to.  This is my first LCD TV -- I've managed to get along with my old, pre-flatscreen TVs up 'til now.  I don't see a ton of difference between the regular TV/cable stations & HDTV.  Again, I've never had an HDTV before and don't know what I should be seeing -- my impression had been that there's a significant difference.  I have the equivalent of HDTV on my computer (or I have HDTV -- I don't know) and watched the entire HDTV version of \"The Tudors\" series on my computer through Amazon Prime instant videos.  I was amazed at how vibrant & crisp the video was -- there was a very noticeable difference between what I normally see on TV (including this TV on HDTV stations) and what I saw on my computer.  (I do have HDTV through my cable company -- it's included in my package for premium stations.)The sound issue is mostly pertinent to those of us with hearing challenges, which includes me.  I find the sound to be weaker than expected given the reviews here.  Now, I've read a ton of reviews of LED/LCD and other flatscreen TV types.  Sound appears to frequently be an issue.  Given the reviews here, I was encouraged that this TV might be an exception.  As for as I'm concerned, the sound is pretty pathetic.  Whereas I'd turn the volume up on my old Sony to maybe 1/4 of its sound capacity to hear it clearly, I find myself turning this TV up to 80%+ of its sound capacity.  Once or twice I've had to turn it up to the maximum 100!  The maximum sound figure is 100 -- on many movies/shows, I have the sound set at 80 or above.  The same comparison holds for the older Panasonic TV I have in the bedroom.  When I turn it up so that all dialogue is clear in the maximum setting I've needed, it's also at about 1/4 of the TV's sound capacity.Finally, the color.  I have to adjust the color on most programs I watch.  The default color is awful.  White skin is FAR redder than it actually is.  I almost inevitably have to adjust both the tint to make skin a more realistic tone and color to adjust the intensity of the color, which is too high in the default setting, contributing to part of the intense redness of skin tone in the defaults.  Now, this wouldn't be a big issue if I only had to do it once and it held for all programs/movies.  Sadly, I have to do it for every program/movie I watch.  The color & tint as I've set them don't hold across programs.  A setting for one movie/show ends up being completely wrong for another.  White skin tone pretty close to reality becomes orange or reddish in another, necessitating another adjustment.  Heck, it doesn't even hold within the same show/movie.  WIth lighting changes come sometimes pretty drastic skin tone changes.  At that point I say the hell with it and watch it at the current setting.Now, it's possible I got a lemon.  I don't know.  But I wanted to add my review to the grouping here to help people make their decisions about which TV to buy.  I know that reviews help me make decisions, and I appreciate being able to read both the good and bad.  I think this is only my first or second one star rating.  I'm not terribly picky most of the time.  This TV, in my view, has definitely earned its one star.", "Date": "February 22, 2012"}, {"Title": "Not great for use with a PC", "Author": "Michael in NY", "ReviewID": "R26VTQ7CTCJ0L8", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "Had problems using the TV as a monitor. The actual resolution of the TV is 1366x768.1280x1024 is OK but a bit fuzzy as you would expect as there are only 768 vertical pixels, forcing the TV to throw some away.1024x600 from a Netbook computer looked fine but with black stripes above and below the windows desktop.1024x768 looked fine, but it is, as expected, stretched horizontally when viewed full screen and thus looks strange, clear, but strange.800x600 is OK but really a waste of a higher definition panel.But the only resolution I care about is 1280x768 which should work just fine. All the TV has to do is use all its vertical pixels and ignore a few horizontal pixels on the sides. But, the TV looks miserable at this resolution, far far worse than any of the above. Not only is text fuzzy, the picture is not centered and data on the left side of the screen is chopped off. And, there is a shimmy across the bottom of the screen. Completely unusable.I tried four different Windows laptops (Windows XP and 7) and two different VGA cables and all the results have been the same. Two of the laptop computers used Intel video hardware, one used ATI and one used NVidia, yet the TV was consistently unusable at 1280x768.This is a supported resolution. All computers were using 60 Hertz as the manual says they should. I'm feeding analog output from the laptops to the VGA analog input on the TV.Not sure if its a bad TV or some other problem.The VGA input port on the TV is also poorly positioned - the VGA plug sticks out from the back of the TV. These plugs tend to be big and heavy. A much better position would allow for the VGA plug to run vertically rather than horizontally.UPDATE 1: I finally got the 1280x768 resolution to look reasonably OK with some tweaking of the TV picture settings. Strange how this was not required with any of the other resolutions. It sill does not look great, but some more tweaking may be needed. Sadly, some of the PC adjustments such as Dot Clock and Clock Phase are not explained in the manual.UPDATE 2: I tried another computer, also analog VGA input, but with a resolution of 1360x768. You would think the monitor would display the 1360 horizontal pixels and ignore 3 pixels on each end. If that's what its doing, the picture was still a bit fuzzy. And, I finally rounded up a computer that was capable of the full native resolution: 1366x768 and the picture was again disappointing, by which I mean that all the text was not sharp and clear. Some was, most was, but not all.Conclusion: don't plan on using this TV as a computer monitor with analog VGA input.

It did not matter that the product was still in warranty when it FAILED. I had a Confirmation from panasonic dated 3/12/12 as the date reported.  So with this be very carefull when buying a panasonic.  1. The item WILL fail and when it does, do not wait to get panasonic to stand behind their product.  2. Panasonic will find a way to get OUT of having to fix their junk.  Panasonic never again.SincerelyRob DTexas", "Date": "August 27, 2012"}, {"Title": "wish i would have got the LG", "Author": "UBETURAZ", "ReviewID": "RBOWNWWNN9KHY", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "i wish i would have viewed TV's side by side before i bought one online without comparing.the picture quality is not as clear as i have seen in other brands. it's just average.", "Date": "May 2, 2012"}, {"Title": "CJ", "Author": "CJFLYNN", "ReviewID": "R29WMXTECRVIWR", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "THE BEST TV MONEY CAN BUY.

The manual said this was the TV's way of protecting itself against power surges.  So I tried plugging in the TV through a surge strip and then on a dedicated circuit.  Same problems.  So I called Panasonic's help number.  Clearly the woman wasn't interested in diagnosing the problem because she said it must be the firmware and she would send me a chip in the mail to upgrade it.  Now, if it WAS the firmware then every television with that version of the firmware on it would have had problems (which doesn't seem to have been the case).  She said I would get the chip in 1-2 weeks.  WEEKS!  I could get a new TV to me the next day for $4 with Amazon Prime.  So I did.  Wasn't the Panasonic though.

This may seem like a silly thing, but this is my bedroom TV, and I access the sleep timer 7 nights a week from bed. Funny thing is Panasonic found room on the remote for a dedicated Closed Caption button, and also a Secondary Audio Program (SAP) button, but the sleep timer is buried in the menus on the non-illuminated remote.Even considering that though, this TV has great video and audio.

The picture/sound quality are a little better than I expected for a $300 TV.  Why one star?  This TV was purchased for a child moving to college.  It was delivered in a new, sealed, undamaged box.  Rather than inspecting the contents, I loaded the boxed TV with her other belongings, and we moved her into the dorm, several hours from home...  I've set up many LCD TVs in the past, so don't normally need to read instructions -- but on this model, I couldn't figure it out -- there was a revised set of instructions for installing the stand (that just said \"old\" and \"revised,\" other than that was just pictures), but the package lacked the screws indicated in either set of instructions..  Screws included didn't fit.  Now, I find myself several hours from home, with a TV that I can't set up, and a kid who would likely hurt herself with a screwdriver if she had to install it later (great student, not so handy).I called the toll-free number for Panasonic, and this is where it got fun...  I was hoping that maybe the missing screws were for some reason already in part of the TV, and maybe I was just missing them.  I got through right away, explained my situation (that sending me new parts wouldn't resolve the issue), asking if it was possible that the screws were somewhere else...  He explained that he would need to put me on hold.  After about 5 mins on hold, I went down to my car, and started to drive to the nearest hardware store.  After about 10 mins on hold, I hung up.  The local ACE Hardware was great -- helped me find the right screws, charged me a whopping $1.08.  When I got back to the car, I had a voicemail from Mr. ForeverHold at Panasonic, who advised that all I would need to do is fax my receipt and the page from the manual that indicated the missing parts, and they would gladly REVIEW, then mail the missing parts to me...  You want a faxed receipt for 4 screws that cost a total of $1 at retail? I wish I had been in a position to simply return the TV.  Being out of town, just trying to get the kid setup then get out of her way, this wasn't an option.  As I said in my first sentence, I think the TV is fine, but manufacturers need to be accountable for including products in their boxes.  Mistakes can happen, as they did, but SERVICE comes when you resolve your mistake by exceeding your customer expectations.  In this case Panasonic didn't come close to meeting my needs.  Obviously, as I explained, mailing them to me, even if they didn't decide I should fax them some documents, wouldn't work.  Sending a small check for my inconvenience?  Would that have been too much for them to offer?  I guess so.I can't do much, other than write to Panasonic to whine, and resolve to never buy from Panasonic again.  My only fun option is to write this to try to get one person to avoid purchasing a Panasonic product.  Hope it works.
