Black levels, color saturation, are all excellent, this HDTV even has a wireless link connection (must be purchased separately)!  This is my first HDTV but not my first Samsung TV and I must say that in keeping with the tradition of high quality TV sets, this is another fine entry in Samsung's catalog!", "Date": "July 14, 2010"}, {"Title": "Samsung 46\" LCD TV - runs in the middle of the pack", "Author": "WPB Consulting", "ReviewID": "RDRC678TVVVTF", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "This is my second LN46C550.  The first arrived with a strange audio problem where the sound would have interference for a brief second several times a minute.  Kudos however to Amazon who quickly sent a replacement that is working fine.I purchased this TV for the bedroom, and can compare it to the Samsung UN55B7000 55-Inch 1080p 120 Hz LED HDTV I have as our primary TV.  The UN55B7000 was last years 120 Hz edge-lit LED model that is really a great TV except for the poor flashlighting produced by the edge-lit design, and its poor DLNA support.  With all the frustration I had with that, I almost swore off Samsung for good.So how does this LN46C550 compare to a TV that cost more than twice as much?  Actually, pretty well.  I have this connected to a Samsung BD-C6500 1080p Blu-ray Disc Player and the HD 1080p is rendered pretty well, however, this being a tube backlit LCD at 60 Hz, there are most definitely some differences in picture quality between the two.VIDEO:The fit and finish of the TV with its Touch of Color design (matches the UN55B7000) is nicely done.  The firmware for this years TVs (the C series) is much better than last years.  There is a plethora of configuration options for tuning  display parameters.  While the set comes with 4 preset picture modes, they are woefully over-saturated and inaccurate.  Many of the dynamic adjustments are noticeable and intrusive, making them more bother than they are worth.  Spending an evening with the Spears & Munsil High-Definition Benchmark Blu-ray Disc Edition [Blu-ray] is well worth the effort.  The display can be tuned to a respectable level of accuracy for all but the most critical viewer.AUDIO:Yeah.  10 Watts x 2.  Basically, two little downward-firing tin cans.  While it has some sophisticated audio signal processing, and preset sound modes like voice enhancement (very handy) and Virtual Surround, no DSP magic is going to trick you into believing you aren't listening to two very cheap, underpowered speakers.  Luckily this does have a digital audio out connector.FEATURES:The TV has a wide variety of features and connectivity options.  I specifically chose a TV that has DLNA capability.  This years models are a little better in supporting it than last years.  I currently use a wired connection to my network, and a PC with Twonky and Mezzmo to stream recorded TV shows.  Samsung hasn't figured out how to support Windows Media streaming.  However, I must say that the Windows 7 \"Play To\" feature now works with the C series sets in a limited fashion, no FF or RW.The remote is functional, but nothing to write home about.  The TV supports AnyNet+, so you can use the remote to control other Samsung connected stuff.Another neat feature is the On/Off timers, which allow you to use the TV like an alarm clock if you wish.SUMMARY:All-in-all, a lot of features for the money.  While it's not going to knock the socks off the vipheophile in the family, the extra features overcome its average picture and audio quality  Samsung does have some quality control issues, but so far, offer a decent buying experience.  Would I buy it again.  Yes.", "Date": "November 15, 2010"}, {"Title": "Review for non-technophile", "Author": "Uncle P", "ReviewID": "R127OD1HF08ADI", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I bought this TV from an Amazon Marketplace seller a couple of months ago. So I have had some time to experience it. I use this TV for watching a lot of sports (Hockey, Baseball, Basketball and Football) some programming - like House and The Simpsons (and sometimes Spongebob)- and some cable fare on Discovery, Science Channel, HGTV, TBS-TNT and so on. I find the picture to be absolutely perfect for sports. Bright, sharp, and clean. I don't have any blurring or \"pixelating\" or whatever it's called when I watch sports. So no, if you ask me, you don't need 120Hz or more to watch sports. Sometimes on non-sports cable programming I get some blurs and pixelation but as far as I can tell it's mostly when I am watching movies that weren't formatted for HDTV. For example, I saw periodic but noticeable pixelation when I watched the 1st Bourne movie, Terminator 2, and (I am embarrassed to admit) Speed on TNT. I also find some of the Discovery programs to sometimes get a little smudgy - very little and only periodically. I think that's weird because those programs are allegedly in HD. I am not sure they are. The channel might be in bonafide HD but maybe they record the programs using some other format and lose something in the conversion. I have no such problems on Fox, NBC or ABC either. And the last time I watched CBS for something other than sports I was still living with my parents - so no comment there. Heck, even Spongebob looks great on NickHD. Anyway, that is one the weird thing I don't like about the picture but I'm thinking it's a problem with the service and not the TV. One thing: after I got my Sony I thought that the Samsung picture looked less than great. That Sony Bravia picture is awesome (as long as you are watching from straight on and not from any angle). But then I saw some internet advice that told be to calibrate the picture using a DVD with a \"THX optimizer\" feature. Most Disney movies have that. I broke out Finding Nemo and tweaked the picture settings and now it looks about the same as the Sony. And I want to point out about the Sony that although the picture is phenomenal it is only that way from dead center viewing. If you get off center by even a little bit the colors start to fade out. On the Samsung I can watch from almost any angle and the colors hold true. That makes the Sammy better for the living room and the Sony fine for the bedroom.For sound, I know there are some complaints but ignore them. The sounds is perfect. It's pretty full for a TV and the stereo effect works good as well. I rarely crank it up past 10 on the dial and I think it goes up to 40 or something. Really - ignore the sound complaints. Audiophiles are never satisfied.For features, it has a lot and I rarely use them because I'm not that kind of TV consumer. But you can do all kinds of stuff with your computer and flash drives and cameras and MP3 players and so on. I never bothered with the internet set up because the 32\" Sony Bravia I have has that feature and it's lame. I'm not plunking down $60-$80 for a wireless USB stick to watch reruns of Good Times and Sanford and Son. Here is the thing about the internet feature: if you have a cable provider or satellite feed you probably don't need it. You can get your movies streamed over those cable services for the same price (or better). You also get the bonus features like channel guides over the cable service. But I guess if you don't have cable or satellite provider then the internet service would be a good feature for you. There are some free services and movies but they really are pretty lame. The rest you pay for on an ad-hoc basis. The only thing I use internet for on the Sony intenet is to catch You-Tube replays of some horse races that I missed. (I told you I like sports). But that isn't worth extra money. The Sony TV came with the USB Wireless stick thrown in, by the way.Overall, this is a great TV. And if you are making the move from a tube TV or other non-HD set then this set will probably blow your mind.", "Date": "March 25, 2011"}, {"Title": "MAC-a-riffically Simple!", "Author": "Rhett Johnson", "ReviewID": "R279SZFV5VOL0R", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I had it set up on the stand and running in less than 15 minutes.

You have been warned.", "Author": "tk_atlanta", "ReviewID": "R234B1VD2HYIWS", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "We purchased our tv in early December of 2010 after reading several reviews, researching online, and going to local electronics stores to see them for ourselves. The Samsung picture quality is very good when compared with others side by side. We also have purchased a Samsung Bluray and have been happy with the quality of both; until a few weeks ago. And as you can guess, the troubles started one month after the warranty expired. The basics of the problem are that the tv automatically changes the volume, changes the source mode (cable, bluray, pc, etc.) and powers on and off. We went thru a few days of troubleshooting with online chat reps and technical reps on the phone. After all that, they had no solutions other than having a service tech come out to look at it. That's $89 just to have them come out, and then they can give us the estimate to fix it. Search this issue online and on the Samsung support website and you will find multitudes of others having this exact problem; the solution from Samsung - \"I'm sorry you are having an issue with your device. With the information you have provided, it would be best if you navigate to the Samsung Support Page and either click on the link to speak with a Live Rep directly under the \"Contact Support\" section in the middle of the page or request service for your device under the \"Schedule a Repair\" section.\" This is the answer they give in chat, online and when you call to everything you ask when they finally run out of things to try. This IS NOT a random issue that we were just unlucky enough to run into. Do your research, read ALL the reviews online, and buy another tv in this price range as so many others offer similar LCD's. If you still think you should buy this tv, make sure to purchase an extended warranty.

The LN46C550's image is bright and sharp, with excellent adjustability via a very intuitive settings menu.  What's more, the built-in electronics are very high-quality compared to some other inexpensive/midrange TVs -- the upscaling/interpolation and sharpening of non-HD sources is absolutely first-rate.  I've watched video from a wide variety of sources using analog and digital inputs on this set and I find the image often looks better than it has any right to.  The backlighting is even despite the lack of LED lighting (though it has developed a slight irregularity over a few years of use, a flaw that newer models should correct).  Burn-in is nonexistent.  In short, this is a very high-quality LCD display indeed, especially considering the non-astronomical midrange price It was sold at; Samsung seems like a great deal all around and I'll be considering another one next time I purchase an LCD TV.", "Date": "August 10, 2012"}, {"Title": "Only lasted one year.", "Author": "Serge Kavetsky \"Mr. Fix-it\"", "ReviewID": "R1GFF6X21IBUX4", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I had the LN46C610 model for exactly one year.

It was my first HDTV and was a wise purchase. The picture quality is excellent, and the sound is good enough for me. Someone complained the sound, but I haven't found anything wrong with it. A real audiophile could always hook up a sound system. It has lots of input jacks and is very attractive looking...you can tell that this is a quality-built set. There are a multitude of picture adjustments, backlight settings, and tons of others...just about everything is customizable.I was a little worried about the 60hz thing, but after many hours of gaming, TV, and movies, I haven't noticed anything \"bad\".The built-in LAN (and optional wireless adapter) really isn't worth it. I had it linked to my computer, but you cannot rewind or fast forward videos using the Samsung remote, and the formats you can play is pretty limited. I bought a PS3 after I bought the TV and it does a much better job.It would have been nice if the control buttons on the TV itself would light up when you pressed near them.

Amazon has a tendency to delete prices in reviews, so I'll just say this: look at the crossed out suggested list price and divide it by two.  That's what I paid, including free shipping and setup by Pilot Freight.  It was delivered on-time and in perfect new condition.I couldn't pass it up at that price.  The picture is good, especially with HD sources.  My PS3 games and Blu-Ray look excellent.  The sound is decent, but not spectacular.  It gets the job done, but you won't mistake it for home theater.  No surprise there.To my eyes the picture quality of this set is on par with many of the more expensive Samsung models.  I think the lower price is just due to having fewer features.  I didn't care about 240Hz, or built in Netflix, or any of that.  I just wanted a basic TV with good picture quality and I had a limited budget.  If you're in the same boat, then you should put this TV, or some of the similar Samsung models, on your short list.For the price that Amazon is asking, this is still a decent deal for a high quality set.
