{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Turned out to be a european product`", "Author": "cheyenne guillois", "ReviewID": "R2NYGTCBSH7R1B", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "Do not order the EW version as it is a European product and will not work out of the box with a US coax in. It does not have a coax in connection and in fact has the European antenna plug.  Even after buying an adapter it still work not work directly with a coax connection.  Works fine with a cable box and an HDMI in.  But even the menu does not allow one to select USA as the location.  I also had to order a USA power cable as it came with a European power cable.  I do not think Amazon should be selling European electronics on an American web site.  I would say just buy a USA model if you are looking for this kind of product.", "Date": "July 10, 2013"}, {"Title": "Geezer Review", "Author": "Abe Baldwin \"Abe\"", "ReviewID": "R3NBLHEKU8XXYR", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Absolutely excellent product.
