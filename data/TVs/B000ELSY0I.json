Though I had initial problems like delayed delivery and bad order processing  between Amazon and Jr.com but i am glad that they got it delivered finally:). I was looking to buy either Sony Bravia or LNS3251D but after doing extensive research and visiting bestbuy/circuitCity etc., I and my wife decided to buy this TV.Here are some pros and cons,Pros:-Good picture quality-Good contrast ratio/resolution..better than Sony-Black Colour-Blazing Fast ~8ms response time which is what even sony has.-2 HDMI connections, though they support only version 1.0 and currently HDMI specs version 1.2a are out in the market-Lots other useful connections like 2 composite A/V (1 side), 2 S-Video (1 side), 1 component (Y/Pb/Pr), 2 HDMI, 2 RF, 1 USB, 1 RS232-PIPCons:- Till now i only found one i.e. its HDMI connections still support version 1.0 and I cannot connect my Toshiba DVD player which supports Ver1.1 HDMI specs.This is what I liked/disliked till now.. I will update this review, if required, after playing a little bit more with its functions/features.", "Date": "June 7, 2006"}, {"Title": "Samsung does it again!", "Author": "Harwood", "ReviewID": "R15TLV81OI92UL", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "If you are in the market for a 32 inch LCD, this set is for you.  I bought my set at Best Buy the first week it was out.  The main differences with this generation set is the built in HD tuner, an amazing 4000 to 1 contrast ratio, dual HDMI connections which means you can enjoy best quality video from two sources. It also has an optical connection so you can transfer audio from the TV to your Home theatre. At the store I compared this set to 4-5 other similar sets, all by major manufacturers and found the color and quality to be superior than most and as good as the Sony XBR Bravia that retails for $900 more.  At home I have it installed with an HDMI coming out of my Scientific Atlanta and Time Warner DVR with their HD service and a Samsung upconvert DVD with HDMI connection capability... The Samsung TV and remote is very easy intuitive and user friendly to set-up.  I like that it comes with 3 different preset modes for picture quality depending on viewing habits and allows for a fouth that you can customize to your own preferences.  All of the settings  including the preset modes can be easily adjusted and if necessary brought back to default settings.  The HD picture from cable is awesomeas is the DVD quality...even with a non-progressive unit which I switched out with the Samsung up convert unit. Utilizing the remote its easy to stretch the picture to fit the screen.  The black laquor cabinet is great looking, but can be a bit distracting as it reflects when light sources hit it.  Samsung also does things a bit different, when the set is on there is virtually no tell-tale sign  like on other sets where you may see a small blue light or redlight to indicate the set is on..instead Samsung utilizes  a red light in the middle of their symbol to indicate the set is off or on standby, and when turned on or off their is a unique audible chirp... on another LCD I had I found the little blue light distracting during viewing.Of note Samsung also came out this year with a second integrated model that costs about $200 less.  The cabinet is done in a flat black, the contrast ratio is only 3000 to 1, the speakers are mounted on the side instead of hidden along the bottom on this model and the stand does not swivel... outside of that the unit is pretty comprable in features and should be considered by those looking for an even better bargain.", "Date": "March 28, 2006"}, {"Title": "amazing", "Author": "N. Nguyen", "ReviewID": "R1CT55KHQ7FYED", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I agree with the other positive reviews for this TV.  I've had it for about 3 weeks now and just about everything looks good.  DVD video looks great, especially Superbit or other DVDs where the extra features are on different DVD.  XBOX360 games look amazing in well lit scenes and there is a bit of trouble seeing things in dark scenes in the default settings.  I don't notice much blurring with games or movies.  I do not have HD cable and regular cable feels like it looks worse than an old SD Sony CRT for 16:9 and 4:3 mode but I have played HD content using the VGA connection and my XBOX and those look great too.  The only thing that I do not like about this TV is the speakers.  They are hidden which is a good thing but they do not sound very good (and understandable for a small/thin LCD).  Do not run this without a proper stereo system.VS Vizio L32.  Both have the same resolution and pictures in well lit scenes look great in both.  The Samsung blows the Vizio away in DVD playback from the XBOX360.  Dark scenes are impossible to see on the Vizio but look good on the Samsung.  Of course, the Samsung cost 800 or so dollars more but the Vizio is the only other LCD I've owned for comparison.Cliffs: Great looking and performing TV where my only complaint is the speakers which leave much to be desired.", "Date": "June 16, 2006"}, {"Title": "Dead Pixels and Amazon/Samsung Won't Rectify", "Author": "JAC \"jjaacc\"", "ReviewID": "RM5Y40SG3T9RK", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I knew that once I opened the box and signed off on delivery the Samsung LNS3251D would be mine and I wouldn't be able to return it, but I didn't expect that Samsung would not assist in having my set's dead pixel issue resolved. Although there are only a few dead pixels in a cluster, they are in the viewing area of the screen. What is strange to me is that I viewed at least 10 display models and none had any dead pixels.

I am very anal when it comes to buying high-priced electronics.  I want to know I am getting the best value for my dollar.That said, I will just say that if you are looking for a 32\" LCD HDTV then this is the one for you.  The 4000:1 contrast ratio is superb and the two HDMI hookups are very useful.  I play some video games, so that part was important.  They look great with so much detail I never noticed on other TV sets.  I will warn you that analog signals do not look very good on this TV, but I don't think they look good on any LCD/Plasma.  If you have DirectTv or some other all digital signal then you will be impressed.  Especially HD.  I can't stop watching ESPN in HD.  It is amazing.I am so spoiled and will never be able to go back to regular TV again.  BUY THIS TELEVISION!!!", "Date": "August 31, 2006"}, {"Title": "Picture Perfect", "Author": "W.

But I was very suspect about shipping methods after reading/hearing horror stories about on-line stores--problems with shipping damage, returns, and customer service.  Convinced myself to trust Amazon, and I'm thrilled.  While the vendor never sent shipping info, Amazon's on-line tracking did.  TV arrived UPS without incident BEFORE the date promised on Amazon and on the exact date UPS projected.  Set-up was a breeze, and within 10 minutes I'm watching HD-TV with the most amazing picture.  The savings you'll get from Amazon are well worth the [now unnecessary] anxiety you might feel about on-line ordering with such a large dollar investment.

All the different functions and connectivity features make it easy to utilize with other equipment.One thing that makes a huge difference in picture quality is the contrast ratio, which on this TV is 4000:1.  When watching my first HD programming, it seemed like the people on TV were sharper than reality.  It is absolutely amazing.The only draw-back of this TV is that it has one tuner, which means the PIP function is available only when used between certain connections.  I couldn't, for example watch one cable program and have another channel on in the PIP.  But I can use it as a PC screen and watch cable in the PIP, which I find very cool.This was definitely a great choice for me, especially with Amazon's amazing price - about $400 cheaper than anywhere else.", "Date": "July 8, 2006"}, {"Title": "We love our Samsung TV!", "Author": "design maven", "ReviewID": "R214CYTZTLXX0I", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I rely heavily on word-of-mouth and Amazon's customer reviews are a great place to find out the real deal about a product.

I also kept in mind the many reviews here. The black on the TV is sharp. The colors are great. And the setup was a breeze.Now comes the shipping part. Eagle is a terrible shipper and if you get them, you might have to wait 2-3 weeks to get your TV. We were so fed up that we drove 15 miles to their facility and picked up the TV.

I just got my Monster Ultra800 HDMI cable yesterday and even though I'm a Monster skeptic, I got a great deal and the picture is a little better than the components I had hooked up.  Whites are awesome, blacks are stunning and the best I've seen...the 4000:1 contrast ratio is one the of the best out there.  SD is surprisingly good and HD is as close to perfect as you're gonna get, to the point where I find myself watching random shows on HD such as \"Carribean Escapes\" because the picture is so amazing.  I have seen the Sony XBR's and I have to say that I can't notice any difference...the Samsung is just as good for much less $$.  I can't comment on DVD or XBOX because I haven't used either with this TV yet....but this is one of the best LCD sets I have ever seen.  I bought the lns3241d at Circuit City initially then saw the top of the line version lns3251d for less $$ so I took it back and exchanged it for the 51.  If you do buy from a Circuit City, Best Buy, etc. make sure you talk them down.  This was selling for 1700 at CC and when I took my first set back they didn't want to lose my business and gave me the better one for around 1350-at cost (supposedly).  Take in some comparison prices from Amazon and Pricegrabber and save yourself $400 or so...although the price right now on Amazon is unbeatable.", "Date": "July 14, 2006"}, {"Title": "Stunning", "Author": "David A.

Its well priced, simple to set up and in almost every way perfect.  Better speakers would have been nice, but it is a LCD so what can you expect.

I bought it over the Sony and LG because of all the positive reviews I have read and the fact that the TV looks great. Buying from Amazon was a breeze and it shipped fast. The picture is great and I like the 16:9. I had been using a 20 inch for the past 10 years and this was a major upgrade.But in my opinion the sound quality is horrible. There is so much background noise it is unbelieveable. If you don't believe me, hit mute on your cable box but not on the TV. You will still hear all of the noise that the TV generates. I have tried playing around with the equalizer which has helped a little but now I need to listen to shows in a very high pitch.I'm sorry for spoiling the five-star party, but I am not in love with this TV as much as I hoped.

I read the reviews of the Samsung on line, so I went to look at it in the store. I was impressed with the crispness of the picture and the vividness of the colors. I decided to order it from Amazon, because the price was three hundred dollars less than the brick and mortar store I checked it out at. Six days latter, the set was at my house, and I broke open the box and set it up. It set up fairly easily, with only two looks at the manual. I didn't have the HD service from Directv installed yet, so I was initially a bit disappointed with the picture. I got hooked up the next day, however, and was blown away by the clarity and color-- even in shows that weren't broadcast in HD. As for the HD shows-- WOW!!

I also received a message with a projected delivery date of almost 4 weeks. However, the tv actually arrived in the area on 7 Oct. From there, it took a few days to play phone tag and actually set the specific delivery date, but, regardless, it was much sooner than originally projected. I also live about 20min outside a major metropolitan area, so I think that helped, too.All is not well that ends well, however. The delivery man was prompt in bringing my tv, but after about 10 minutes of unsuccessfully trying to get a clear picture on the set, he declared that he had to go and insisted that it was not his job to make sure that the tv was working properly. I have read many horror stories of unaccepted returns, and so I specifically clarified with the dispatcher (prior to the dely) that the delivery man *is* supposed to wait until you can verify that the set is working. In fact, while he was there in my apt, I called the dispatcher and *again* clarified the above, but Mr.Stubborn still refused to wait any longer. [Nonetheless, he spent another 10-15 minutes arguing with me and the dispatcher about it -- during which he refused to give me his full name and refused to give me a copy of the invoice.] So I ended up not accepting the shipment and filing a complaint with Eagle (the delivery subcontractor). I have since talked with Amazon, and they tell me I have to wait until Eagle ships the set back to them (so they can verify the return), at which time they will send a replacement. God only knows how long this will take.Chances are that there was nothing wrong with the set anyway -- I just needed a few more minutes to make sure.  I asked if they could just re-send the same set (hopefully with a different delivery person), but apparently they can't do that.So that's my experience.

Beautiful image.The only drawbacks are the downward facing speakers and the complicated menu system. The sound is uneven at times with some frequencies coming thru much louder. The menu hides some functions that you might want quicker accesss to.I have discovered one quirk. If you use it as a computer monitor (which it does really well), leave a DVI to VGA adapter attached to the VGA port and turn the monitor off something strange happens.

I love watching Jay Leno at 1080i...the picture is so sharp and vivid it's almost like 3d.I also like the picture from my Samsung HD960 upscaling DVD player at 1080i. This TV doesn't work with this player at 1080p which I thought it would, but nonetheless, some of the IMAX DVD's I have at 1080i using the hdmi input are no less than spectacular.This TV does a very good job with motion. There are no artificts or pixelation like you see on a lot of LCD's. (not that I can see anyway). That combined with the super duper contrast ratio give an amazing picture. Bright vivid colors and black blacks...no noise, no artifacts. It is very, very good compared to anything else I've ever seen.This TV also has a vga analog computer input....if you've never seen your computer at 32 inches you're in for a treat. It works great attached to a computer and the color and contrast is excellent.The remote, menu system is so so. It seems like I always want to grab the remote upside down. There's nothing really bad about the remote control, it's just average.Sound wise, it could be better. If you are using a surround sound system that's not an issue but I bought this as a bedroom TV mounted at 45 degrees off the ceiling (awesome). I view from a distance of about 7 feet and I think that's just about optimum for this screen size.

I contacted Amazon by Email and they shipped a replacement TV to me immediately as well as arrange for a carrier to pick up the deffective one.  At this point, I was bummed since I had spent $1000 on a TV and had nothing to show for it as well as envisioning a long wait for a replacement.  However, the replacement also arrived in just a few days and it worked perfectly.  I have this TV in my bedroom on a standard (not HD) Dish receiver and off-air HD antenna.  The off-air 720p picture is better than my larger, more expenzive Mitsubishi 1080p picture, and the regular digital Dish picture on the Samsung rivals the HD receiver Dish 1080p picture on the Mitsubishi.  The tuner circuitry in the Samsung also is much more sensitive (stronger off-air HD signal) than the more expensive Mitsubishi.  On the negative side, the remote power on function is VERY slow in response and a bit irritating.  The standard and HD formats also switch back and forth on the Samsung as program, commercial, etc. formats change.  With the Mitsubishi I can set the wide HD format and it will automatically adjust the changes rather than display them in the  different formats.  If the Samsung has this feature, I haven't been able to find it yet.  Overall, this is a great bedroom TV (I was constrained to a 32\" built-in space).  I shopped around a lot before I purchased this set.  Owning a 1080p set, I was concerned that since 32\" sets were only available in 720p that I might be disappointed with the picture quality.  Not to worry-- The picture quality is awesome-- better than many 1080p sets!

I called Samsung and talked to a very knowledgeable CSR who finally was able to determine that my cable company was not delivering an HD signal.

However, if you're on the fence, here are my nitpicks about the unit.- limited zoom options.  Your only choices are 16:9, 4:3, Zoom1 (enlarges a 16:9 program that's been letterboxed into 4:3, so that the program fills the screen), and Zoom2(more zoom than Zoom1).  It would have been nice to have a few more Zoom steps.- slow powerup.  It takes 3-5 seconds after pressing the power button before the TV lights up.  The only indication that you actually pressed power is that the LED blinks.  The first few times, I thought the button was broken.- no way to directly change to a given input source.  If you have several inputs connected to the TV (like DVD, cable box, av receiver), you cannot get the TV to change directly to the source you want.  Instead, you have to press the source button repeatedly until you get to the one you want, or navigate the Menu user interface.  This may not seem like a big deal, but it gets in the way of remote control macros, and it takes a few seconds to change from one source to another.- It has two S-Video inputs, and two RCA-video inputs but each S-Video input shares its RCA-audio inputs with an RCA-video input.  This may be a problem if you're routing audio through your TV.Other than these very minor points, this is a great unit.", "Date": "August 23, 2006"}, {"Title": "Ahead of its time!!!", "Author": "GO BIG ORANGE! \"Home of the VOLS!\"", "ReviewID": "R6RBU5EXDCHVN", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I did painstaking research for months to find the right tv for our living room.  I had narrowed it down to this one and a Toshiba in the same size.  I liked this one due to the 4000:1 contrast and its sleek design.  The picture quality of this tv is amazing, let me say that again... amazing.  The HD channels that I receive is truly sharp and crystal clear.  But and I do mean but this tv is ahead of its time.  Congress passed a new law that all television programing must be digital by February 2009.  Currently the majority of tv is viewed in an analog signal.  So on a tv that is so sharp and so crystal clear it actually makes the picture of an analog signal seem at times blurry or less than even a tube tv.  This is due to the signal attempting to upconvert to the performance of the tv.  This is regardless of how it is hooked up.  I use the composite, component and the S-video and it seems like the S-video at this time is better.  That of course will change when all programming is digitalized.  It is like taking a digital photo with a 2 MP camera and then trying to enlarge the image on your computer, it can become a bit distorted but then taking that same image with a 10 MP camera the image is much clearer, much sharper and all around a better quality.  That is what will happen when all programming is made digital.  This will occur slowly over the next two years but it will happen.  Watching a dvd is amazing on this tv, watching HD is amazing on this tv, watching other channels not so good but that is going to be for any tv that has such a high contrast and the price is great as well.  I bought this for just under $1100 and then noticed that it was even cheaper now, after calling amazon they credited me the difference so everybody won.

I was a little skeptical about ordering such an expensive piece of equipment through the mail, but with the Amazon price being so much lower than the big box stores and having heard testimonials from others, I decided to chance it.  Not only did the TV arrive in one piece with no defects, it arrived a week sooner than anticipated.  The shipping company even called me at work to schedule all the details of the delivery!  On to the TV itself.  I did quite a bit of research before purchasing the Samsung LNS3251D, including stops at several stores to compare the various models.  I also spent many hours reading reviews on the Web.  There are LCDs that are much cheaper (and few that are more expensive), but I was immediately drawn to the Samsung because of its overall aesthetics.  Yes, the picture quality was great, but let's be honest: to a casual observer like me, there's not really a noticeable difference between the Samsung and its higher-end competitors (e.g. Sony).  For someone coming from a lifetime of standard def, they all looked amazing.  So you really have to make your decision on the way the TV makes you feel.  Remember, your new TV is going to sit (or hang) in your living room or bedroom for many years to come.  You wouldn't want to buy an expensive painting and then hang it in a cheap frame, would you?  The Samsung was by far the most visually appealing to my eyes.  I currently have mine on a TV stand, but it would look equally good mounted on the wall.  It really is like a work of art.  Now, I don't play video games and I am not a huge movie buff, so I'll leave the discussion of the pros and cons of the Samsung's features in that regard to the other reviewers.  I bought my TV primarily for watching sports, and I have not been disappointed (football, baseball, golf, basketball, hockey -- they're all amazing to watch in high def).  Some of the night games look a little dark and grainy on the TV, but if you play around with the brightness feature on the remote you can usually make it look pretty good.  There is no ghost effect.  The sound is nothing special but perfectly adequate for my needs.  As others have noted, the TV takes a few seconds to turn off an on, but that's such a minor annoyance its almost not even worth mentioning.

I had no problems with the order or the delivery. The TV showed up in perfect condition, no dead pixels or anything like that.I've been using it now for several months, and am still quite pleased with it.Pros:1. The picture quality is great. The colors are really nice and rich, and blacks are pretty good.2. The viewing angle is tremendous. I have it in my living room, and I don't think there is anywhere you can stand and not see the picture.3. There are enough hookups for everything. I only use one HDMI jack at the moment for a DirecTV HD box, I use the component connection with a progressive scan DVD player which looks sensational, and I have my old DirecTivo hooked up to the S-Video. So I've actually got quite a few left over. I have yet to try the VGA port; but I did hook my Mac up via DVI->HDMI and got decent results.4. It does a good job of scaling picture sizes. Each input can have its preferred format remembered. So the HD box and DVD player stay on 16:9 while the Tivo stays on 4:3, and all look fine. If you are watching a non-anamorphic widescreen program, you can zoom it to full screen which looks pretty good as well.5. I for one quite like the shiny black \"grand piano\" finish; and the TV is generally attractive and fits in well in most rooms.Cons:These are mostly minor quibbles;1. My main complaint is that it is a bit slow to change between sources using the \"Source\" button. Its a little quicker if you use the menu, but I prefer not too.2. There is sometimes some ghosting on screen if a scene goes from fully colored to mostly black quite quickly. The artifacting can stay on the screen until more color comes to replace it. This isn't really that noticeable, and only happens in programs with fully dark screens.3. In retrospect, I probably could have stood a 40 inch, although this does work pretty well for the size of my living room.Overall, it is a great TV with a really good picture, top notch inputs, and a decent price tag.

There is one thing I just hate in this TV.1) At this point in time, programming that you can get will be a mix of HD (720p and above) and SD/ED (480i and 480p). HD aspect ratio is 16:9 while SD/ED would be 4:3. Simply put, a HD program would *naturally* fill up the complete screen as this TV also has a 16:9 screen. On the other hand, SD programs would appear *naturally*  like a square within the screen with black side bars. Problem is, this TV does not remember the aspect ratio *per channel*, instead it has a system wide aspect ratio. So if you were flipping channels, and you went from an HD to SD chennel, the SD picture will be streched as the TV scales a 4:3 SD program to 16:9, and you have to change the TV's aspect ratio to 4:3. Again when you went back to HD from SD the image appears squished (16:9 to 4:3) , and you have to change the aspect ratio back to 16:9. You end up pressing the pic size button on the remote every time to match the channel's native aspect ratio. EXTREMELY ANNOYING.Since what's annoying for me may not be as bad for someone else, I still give this set a 5 star. Everything else is just fabulous. Eagle delivered, very courteous, very professional.The HD picture is stunning, but SD is nothing I look forward to watching.

There seems to be issues reported by several customers with EGL,  but having had previous experience with them on a few other orders, I was aware of how they do business.  Basically to get your TV as quickly as possible, track your package on-line, and once you see it hit your local EGL depot, give them a call to set up a delivery date.  If you wait for them to call, it could add several days.  They were very helpful, and delivered the TV on the day and timeframe I gave to them.  What more can you ask for.  It's not UPS .... but what do you expect for free!!!Back to the TV.  The only shortcoming of this set is only having one YPbPr port, but I knew this ahead of time, so I went out and bought a newHDMI DVD player .... I needed a new one anyway!  Now the YPbPr port is free for XBox 360.  Having 2 HDMI's is very nice.  This is the interface of the future.  The TV also has  Optical Audio Out, which is a very nice feature as I have this hooked to my 5.1 Receiver making the sound much better than the built in speakers.

Some say they set the TV up, my guys didn't even unpackage it before they left.  I tested it quickly myself, but this is something to watch out for.  Their orders are to open it and take the trash at least.As for the TV, it is an excellent TV and used in our bedroom.  Picture quality with everything is great...we have a larger Sony LCD rear projection downstairs and is very similar (good TV reception, great DVD and awesome HDTV).  Don't expect the TV to make poor cable or even digital cable singals any better than they are.Only downsides to the TV is one set of component inputs (if you have a DVD player using that you couldn't use a game system or cable box) but two HDMIs is nice.  Only has one tuner so picture in picture only works for a few combinations of inputs not two channels on the TV.I wouldn't pick any other TV for the price right now and a free tilt wall mount from Mustang works excellent.", "Date": "December 19, 2006"}, {"Title": "Great TV", "Author": "R.

Krenz", "ReviewID": "RNXGG7QPRJ9NM", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I bought the Samsung at Best Buy 2 weeks after I bought the LG from Ultimate Electronics. I bought the samsung because I was impatient and didn't want to start into the third week of waiting for the LG to arrive at the store. Ultimate jerked me around by saying it will be in _____. I called each time they said it would be in and it wasn't in.On to the review. I run analog cable in the apt. So my main viewing is at 4:3. About 26\" picture. When I first turned on the samsung I thought the sound was fantastic. I took a pretty big step from a mono 13\" tube tv though. When I turned on the LG I thought the samsung sound quality was crap. I'm new to surround sound and all that fancy sound stuff. By using the TV audio outputs, though, the sound is better than what I got from the LG audio out with a cable and DVD. One annoying thing about having both tv's going at the same time was the echo. You're probably thinking, echo? Wait a minute. There shouldn't be an echo. There was. Even hooked up straight to the wall separately the LG's audio is noticably behind the movements of people's mouths. I would say just miliseconds but definately annoying. Either that or the samsung was ahead ever so slightly. I vote the LG was behind though.The picture is tough to compare. I spent a bunch of time switching settings to get them to have similar contrast, brightness, color. The samsung, unfortunately has a lower refresh rate than the LG. The LG's refresh looked flawless whereas the samsung has some, artifacting, I believe was the word used. Blurring of movement. Noticable but not overly annoying.The LG had a problem with where the 4:3 picture met the black side bars. There was sort of a white strip about a pixel wide separation. Samsung is flawless all the way to the edge. Also the black side bar is less noticable because it's blacker.(with comparable screen settings)As far as overall sharpness(again with comparable settings) the samsung pulls ahead. The color is a bit more robust in the samsung.HDMI. Well. I didn't know this existed until just recently. I've always used separate audio/video cables to hook up a vcr. I'm new to DVD players too. PC's are my friend. I have a decent sony DVD player pushing signals out the HDMI. HDMI is like when you turn the sharpness up to much on a photo in photoshop. S-video is like dropping the sharpness. Both TV looked the same as far as quality from HDMI and s-video. I expected the LG to look better with all the fancy quality step-up/enhancement features. I bet samsung has similar features but they just don't market it as hard as LG.Since I'm more of a PC user than a DVD watcher I liked that they both offered a PC hookup. They both looked fantastic when the resolution was set properly. I'll hand it over to the samsung though for a more robust image(with similar settings).The remotes and menus are different but just as easy to learn with a little bit of messing around. The LG remote is heavier but the buttons offer a more positive press and a softer feel.The samsung is much much lighter and wouldn't think twice if I wanted to anchor it to drywall. The LG, however, is heavy and I would be leary about hanging it on the wall unless I hit a stud with both mount points.The feature of being able to pause the tv is pretty neat. The LG offers a more crisp still. Not like it matters though. It's like a picture on a phone. for both of them.I went with the samsung. A bit more expensive. I wanted to save a boatload by purchasing from amazon but with all the bad reviews on their chosen shipper I decided to talk best buy down a bit on the price. Please if you buy from a retailer and get the service plan, ask them to knock money off the TV to drop the price since they usually cannot drop the price of the service plan. Yes they have to make money too but it's not hard to figure out that the markups on TV's are ridiculous.Had I got the LG right away when I bought it and didn't go crazy doing research on other TV's while I waited for two weeks I probably whould have been satisfied with it despite the minor annoyances. Would I have even noticed them if I didn't have the samsung side by side? Probably not. Would I have noticed anything negative about the samsung without the LG side by side? Probably not.

Only a more expensive Sony could possibly best this television.If you're looking for a leading-edge, top of the line TV, this is the one to get. You don't need increased contrast like the higher end Samsungs; this one is deep and dark enough to please even the most critical eyes. Keep in mind that besides adjusting contrast and brightness, this set has an \"E Saving\" mode which will dim the back light considerably. This enhances contrast a GREAT deal. And with the two HDMI inputs, you're set for cable/sat. box with HDMI connectivity and a high-definition DVD player when they're affordable.I used to sell televisions (up to about a year and a half ago) and on my way out I noticed how amazing the Samsung LCDs were becoming. Now, with these current models, they really go toe-to-toe with the Sony Bravia XBR models. And you can't beat that, I'm pretty sure of that. The Samsung is not only the most physically attractive TV but it simply provides the best picture for the size and price point. The piano black is beautiful, the connectivity is perfect, the remote is user-friendly, and the settings are diverse enough to get the picture just the way you'd like it.Amazon also seems to continually have the lowest price on this TV and shipping from Eagle is great. They make sure the screen is not damaged before leaving and they're very polite. That's saying a LOT for any delivery team. I do recommend CALLING them as soon as you track the item as being in your state. You can probably set up delivery for 1-3 days from that point, but if you wait for them to deliver on their own, it will take longer. They seem to prioritize the deliveries setup over the phone.So again, if you're still deciding on a TV, this is the ONE to get. Keep in mind that out of the box, any LCD tv needs some proper adjusting. I've dimmed the back light to the \"medium\" setting and played with the brightness/contrast/color to the point where the pictures look perfect and represent colors properly. You can pick yourself up (or even rent) a calibration DVD to simplify this task.ONE con about this TV is the sound, as many others have mentioned. It is poor. Very poor. I have it hooked up to a surround sound system in my bedroom anyway, so if you're planning on using the TV's speakers, don't be surprised by the muffled sound.

Mostly based on the fact that when viewing all the different ones that friends have purchased, they all seemed to vary quite a bit in terms of picture quality.

I then decided to view it and compare it with some other highly rated ones at a local store. I was just blown away by the picture quality.That being said, I came back here and picked one. Hooked it up when I got home and I've been 100% satisfied for well over a month now. Oddly enough, when I head over to those friends' houses now and see their HD's, I find myself saying in my head, \"wow, I'm glad I bought what I did\".The only thing stopping it from becoming the 'perfect' TV in my opinoin, is that I'd have like to see it come with 1 extra component connection.

All the local stores had list prices that were several hundred dollars more and Amazon had free shipping and no tax. It was a fantastic deal via Amazon. The TV set is absolutely fantastic. That 4000 to 1 contrast ratio really make the difference between a super picture and a so-so picture. So....folks...when you buy a LCDTV make SURE the contrast ratio is at least 3000 to 1 or better.. This is one of the most important specifications to check when deciding on your HD TV purchase. A low contrast ratio gives you a \"washed out\" picture. Go check a 32\" LCD HDTV (that sell for $600 to $700) and you will see the difference because of the low contrast ratio.Lecture is over :-]I should mention however that I did have some trouble with Amazon's shipper. They were several weeks late getting it to me because, somehow, they had an old, obsolete area code for my telephone number and couldn't get in touch me to set up a shipping time delivery window.

To replace it, I knew I wanted an LCD and my imagination turned to Samsung, as I have always liked their PC monitors in the past.When I spotted this beauty, I knew that Samsung quality and the 4000:1 contrast ratio would result in an awesome TV.  And I was right!The TV was pretty easy to set up.  The remote is probably one of the most intuitive I've used in quite a while.The real story is the picture quality.  The dark blacks of the TV are awesome.  We watched \"Reservoir Dogs\", which is a fairly darkly lit \"mood\" film, and the Samsung really did a nice job of the picture.I usually run the LCD on a \"cool\" setting so that the colors are not too halloween like.  Definitely the color is on the cool side, however the color is so unobtrusive, it really does the job.If I was at all picky, I would question that the speakers are just \"adequate\".  But anyone who is buying a TV oif this quality is probably going to run the sound through a separate sound system.All in all you won't be disappointed with the classy quality and picture quality of this TV.If you're looking for an \"upscale\" or dare I say \"best of breed\" 32 inch flat LCD, look no farther than the Samsung LNS3251D.", "Date": "January 17, 2007"}, {"Title": "Very satisfied", "Author": "TK426", "ReviewID": "R13VGSGKLIQDB9", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I purchased this set on black friday for $1079.99. No complaints about the shipping service. This is my first HDTV and I have to say that i'm impressed overall. The quality of the picture is fantastic. It's crystal clear. Standard definition looks pretty good too. I've been using this with my X-Box 360. In fact, I bought this set for that purpose. 360 games looks awesome on this set. Many of the 360 Kiosk in the stores use Samsung HDTV's. I also downloaded a couple of HD shows from X-Box live. The quality of the images is unbelievable. Now I'm tempted to get the HD-DVD drive for the 360. Another feature that I like is the 3241d ability to remember settings for each input. Example. You can have your brightness setting set to 65 for S-video1 input, and Brightness set to 50 for component input. Don't have to play around with those settings once it's set.The only complaint that I have so far is the sound, which is why I gave four stars instead of 5. It just isn't impressive to me. I'm going to fix that problem with my set of Klipsch RSX 4 speakers. As far as the 5 second start up goes, it not a problem. What's 5 seconds?

The picture is bright, sharp, and colorful.  HD DVD and Blu-Ray discs look excellent on this set, and it is really the best way to use this set.  Standard DVDs look very good, but would probably be better with a DVD player that up-converts standard DVDs to HD quality.  Standard cable TV looks good, but not as good as on a conventional tube TV.  The menus are easy to navigate.Energy consumption: First, this TV puts off some heat.  Not as bad as a plasma, but I definitely feel the heat on my hand within 4 to 5 inches of the screen.  The screen gets very warm to the touch, but not hot.  The set has an energy saving feature that can be controlled from the remote.  The energy saving feature has four settings (Off, Low, Med, and High).  The 'off' setting gives you the brightest and most colorful picture.  I only use this setting for watching movies, or if the room lighting is very bright.  The 'high' setting reduces the brightness of the screen, and considerably cuts down on the heat output.  Personally, I use the 'medium' and 'high' settings for most of my regular TV viewing.My only real complaint of this set is the remote.  It has a poor layout, with the number buttons near the top and the 'Enter' button on the lower part of the remote.  If you enter channel selections directly, you have to awkwardly shift your hand to hit the enter button.  The most annoying thing about the remote is the fact that you have to point it directly at the TV for it to work (no bouncing signals off the walls like most remotes).  If you are pointing the remote off center of the TV by just a few degrees, it won't work.  I don't know if it a design problem with the remote or the sensor in the TV, but it sucks.  Whoever designed it that way should be taken out back and flogged!Overall, a great TV that I highly recommend.  I took one star away because of the design of the remote.

After some issues with the payment methods, I received the TV on the 18th (the earliest estimated shipment day).  Since then, I have nothing but good things to say about this Television.I didn't realize that HD channels come through right over the air.  With the built in HD tuner, I have been able to watch HD shows on this TV, and I don't even have cable or satellite TV.  I love being able to watch my favorite shows like Heroes, CSI, Prison Break, Medium, and even late night shows like Leno and Letterman all in HD!  The colors are striking, and I love having tons of sub-channels like 58-1, 58-2, 10-1, 10-2, 10-3, and more while still being able to watch the regular channel 58 and 10 if I choose to.I've heard some people on here complaining about how you can't stretch channels that already come through in HD (I've noted that channels that are digital such as 720p and 1080i can't be stretched), but I think that has more to do with the channel transmitting the image in 4:3 rather than 16:9.  I can't wait until every channel has to transmit in HD and in 16:9.  I've already noticed a few commercials that are in wide screen without needing to stretch them.  Just wait for it boys and girls.  It'll happen, and you'll have no reason to complain about such things after that.I heard that the TV has only HDMI 1.0.  Let me tell you my experience.I've hooked up my PS3 to this TV using only a generic HDMI cable (not name brand or anything).  The video and audio come through just fine.  The TV only goes to 1080i, but I'm not complaining.  Gaming has gone to a whole new level due to the clarity of this TV.  I never noticed some of the detail of Genji: Days of the Blade until I played it on this TV.I've got a DVD player, a VCR, a Game Cube, and a PS3 hooked up to this puppy, and I still have room to hook up more stuff.  I'm in heaven, and I haven't even hooked up my computer to it yet!Lastly, I want to note how clear the viewing of movies is.  Using my PS3 to play BD movies (Blue-ray Disk) has helped me truly appreciate the quality that the BDs have.I can't wait to have a surround sound system to hook up to this puppy and bring things to yet another level of greatness.The one drawback that I've seen in this TV is that everyone at my house wants to crowd around it to watch their favorite program.  Sorry Mom, but you'll have to watch 24 and Jack Bower in Standard Definition on the TV upstairs.  :DI definitely say it's worth the money to buy this TV.  Whether it's just to watch DVDs and BDs, watch TV in HD, or play games in high quality, I think you'll get what pay for and more.  I'm sure that newer technology probably looks even better than this does, but if you're looking for a great deal, I definitely recommend this TV.---Short summery of this review----HD sub-channels are a wonderful surprise even without the dish or cable-The channel stretching issue will resolve itself in time-HDMI 1.0 is no issue for PS3 audio and video (and am assuming the 360 too)-Wonderful connectivity to multiple media devices-DVD and BD movies are beautifully presented-Definitely recommended for your cost efficient purchase", "Date": "February 2, 2007"}, {"Title": "Rivals the picture quality of my 50\" Pioneer Plasma", "Author": "abellofi \"AB\"", "ReviewID": "R12Q5UFISTOT0P", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I've owned plasma TV's for two years now.  My latest plasma, the Pioneer 5070, has just about the best pictures available in the industry.  I recently picked up the Samsung LN-S3251D for my living room and can honestly say that its picture rivals that of my cherished Pioneer.Pros:* This set has discrete IR codes for all its available input sources; perfect for a universal remote control (they are in the Harmony remote database).* Excellent picture quality (black levels, contrast).  Some reviewers had me worried about DNIe mode artifacts but they are NOT noticeable to me and I am very picky.* Sound quality is good for internal speakers. If you want bass, use a home stereo system (this is the case with any set however).  Turning on \"surround\" mode makes vocals slightly muffled; I tend to leave it off and the sound is very clear.* This set maintains different picture modes for each input (ie. Standard, movie, etc).Possible Cons (at least for some other users):* No QAM tuner. Not a deal breaker for me because I have an HD DVR.  You can use the ATSC tuner with a mini HD antenna to pick up all your local HD broadcasts if you need to.* The supplied remote is very directional; that is, you need to aim it directly at the TV - a few degrees off center and no luck.  I do NOT have this issue when using my Harmony 880 with this set.* No non-linear 16:9 stretch mode.  Some sets have a mode where 4:3 contents is stretched to fit the full 16:9 screen by stretching the edges more than the center where you usually direct your attention.  I, however, usually find this mode distracting because I perceive it like looking through a fish bowl.  So, if you're like me and just get used to and like everything stretched linearly then this won't be an issue for you.FYI's:* Supported aspect ratios are \"16:9\", \"4:3\", \"Zoom 1\" and \"Zoom 2\".  If you are using HDMI/DVI, are set to \"16:9\", and are displaying 4:3 content, this set WILL NOT stretch the 4:3 content to fill the screen.  You must rely on your player or Set-top box to do this for you.  However, when using any other source (S-video, Component, Composite, etc) in \"16:9\" to display 4:3, the picture WILL be stretched to fill the screen.  I don't use \"Zoom 1\" or \"Zoom 2\".* Power Saving mode is best set to \"Medium\" as other users have mentioned.* Register with Samsung within 10 days of purchase and get an extra three months added to your warranty period.Amazon pricing and shipping was excellent as always.", "Date": "January 28, 2007"}, {"Title": "Great TV", "Author": "Videophile 19", "ReviewID": "R15LY18PIDEFMK", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I've had this TV for about a month and a half and I still can't believe how amazing it is!

All that being said, I will now say that if you are looking for a 32\" LCD HDTV then this is the one for you! The 4000:1 contrast ratio is eye-popping and the two HDMI hookups make all digital hook ups a breeze. I play my XBOX 360 on this and it makes it so much more enjoyable. It looks so good with so much detail I never noticed on other TV sets. I want to also say that analog signals do not look very good on this TV, but then again I don't think they look good on any LCD/Plasma. If you have Dish Network like I do or some other all digital HD signal then you are in for a real treat. I can not stop watching the Dish Network broadcasts in HD. It is truly amazing.

My review would be similar to most of the reviews here: great picture but audio could be better. Overall, it is a great TV for the price.CON: This TV generates quite a bit of heat for a LCD TV. On a side note, I bought a 40\" Sony LCD TV 6 months ago. At that time, I really liked the Samsung 42\" plasma but it generated too much heat. I could not place my hand on its screen for more than a few seconds. It was that hot. TV's from other brands did not feel that hot compared to the Samsung. That's why I decided to buy a LCD instead of a plasma at that time.

I wondered what size would be best for my family room and now wish that I had purchased a larger model. The 32 inch widescreen actually becomes a 27 inch size for programs that are not in high definition format. Until all programming is in high definition, it is going to feel a little small. I believe the 40 inch model would have been about the right size for my average-sized family room. With that said, I am very satisfied with the picture quality, variety of inputs, and the appearance of the television. The speakers do not deliver the same quality experience, and I highly recommend running the audio through a surround sound system with an optical cable.

OK, 3 days to process it.Here's the issue, The scheduled delivery date is now 10/2 from Eagle Truckers. I have not talked to the shipper yet, but will tomorrow. If I had known that it would take close to a month to get the TV, I may not have ordered it from them. Prices are falling fast and I am not sure that it will be such a good deal by the time I get it.I will update this post as things change.Update.I talked to the shipper and now I am scheduled for delivery on 9/19, so maybe all is OK. I guess you can't go by the delivery dates quoted.Will update again when recieved.Update: 9/22/06Received TV on 9/19. No dead pixels. There is always a chance of buying something online and dealing with the return poilicy on over 27\" TV's. Fortunately I have not had an issue yet. Don't look forward with having to deal with Samsung for service. I saved about $220 plus the sales tax from buying retail. So if your really price conscious, then you should take the chance. I know that if I had a problem with dead pixels or speakers not working, then I would have just took it back to the store.As far as what I ahve seen on the TV itself...It has excellent HDTV and DVD quality. I am hook up to HD cable box and get anywhere from 720p to 1080i on HD channels..amazing picture.Do not expect analog signals to look as good as a tube TV. Digital channels are just average. So it depends or your source input.I am having trouble using HDMI input, it can't find the signal. At this point I don't know if its my cable box, the HDMI cable or the TV. From what I have seen, there isn't much difference in quality vs component input anyway. The HDMI will be useful for the DVD upconverter I will be getting.Another reason I bought this was for PC input via VGA. It displays 1366 x 768, 1024 x 768 and 800 x 600. Only the highest resouliton keeps the aspect ratio correct, so make sure your graphics card does. I have a good card so mine does and I watch a DVD from the PC and it was beautiful.I am also using it as a monitor for the PC when siitng on a couch 10 feet away, with wireless keyboard and mouse. It a little strain on my eyesite, but I need glasses. For normal vision it is not an issue. You cannot use PIP between PC and component or HDMI inputs.Overall I am please with this purchase, but I have not has the issues that are mentioned elsewhere.Hope this helps.", "Date": "September 12, 2006"}, {"Title": "If it doesn't ship UPS, buy elsewhere", "Author": "Thomas Gessner", "ReviewID": "R2JH1W8H7R1QA", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "Picture is very similar to my old Sony.
