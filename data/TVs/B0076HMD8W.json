{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Excellent For My Needs", "Author": "Hallucious", "ReviewID": "R17QC697XRYDDT", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I bought this tv in July 2012. I don't really watch tv but I play a lot of video games. I also don't use my tv for any type of internet purposes. I spent around $330 for this and a 3 year warranty from Squaretrade. If you're looking for a good bedroom tv without all the crazy Smart-tv features than this is a good buy. Magnavox has been around for ages and I trust the brand. The picture is good but what really stands out is the audio. Tv speakers are only gonna be so good on any tv but this one has SRS TruSurround. I've seen a few other brands like Samsung that has SRS. SRS Technology makes the sound much better. You have different meters you can adjust to get the sound exactly how you want it. The difference with SRS on is noticeably different than when you turn it off. It allows you to not turn the volume up much and still hear everything clearly. The remote and menus are real easy to use. Overall, this tv is excellent for those who don't need all the Smart-tv features.", "Date": "September 2, 2012"}, {"Title": "Magnavox - Great Flatscreen TV", "Author": "Barbara Tacinelli", "ReviewID": "R6D4GU77TWZ7G", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "When my old tube TV broke last year, I quickly wanted to buy a replacement.  I searched the internet and came across a 19\" Magnavox TV.  I remembered that Magnavox was the brand of my first TV many years ago and having been satisfied then, I decided to buy it.  The picture and sound were excellent and I had no problems with it.  So when I wanted a larger size TV, I decided to buy a Magnavox again.  When I saw this 26\" Magnavox, it had the features that I was looking for--LED/LCD, three HDMI ports, and Energy Saver.  Again, I am very pleased with this purchase and would highly recommend buying a Magnavox.", "Date": "December 6, 2012"}, {"Title": "Great T.V.", "Author": "DR", "ReviewID": "R1BLPANY9HWKK0", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I use things until they wear out, so I bought this T.V. to replace a 20\" analog T.V. that finally died.  The quality of the picture is great; so clear and bright.  I also love that you have the option to view your photos and videos on the T.V.  The T.V. is not heavy at all, so it's very easy to move around.  Some reviewers commented on the sound, but I haven't found that to be a problem.  I have no complaints; I'm very happy with my purchase.", "Date": "June 5, 2013"}, {"Title": "Smaller, but just fine", "Author": "Mark A  Fox", "ReviewID": "R3VRYZMHJ9RIZW", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "It's a big upgrade from our picture tube TV.

When a network newscast (for instance) switches from the studio anchor to a remote reporter, the sound sometimes suddenly changes to the point where I need to manually adjust it. This happens regardless of the settings the TV provides for automatic volume matching and so forth.I contacted Magnavox support. I told them everything I tried, including having another TV in the same room for comparison, and the rep said it was likely a fault with their automatic sound adjustment circuitry [even though that was turned off]. (It sounded to me as if this might be a known problem, but he didn't explicitly say that).He offered to send me return shipping labels and said that they would process a replacement within FOUR WEEKS of their receipt of the returned unit. And, of course, I would pay for shipping.In short, this should send a message about how Magnavox sits (not stands) behind their products. I can't imagine dealing with them in the future, and certainly can't recommend them or this product unless you tend to watch TV with the sound turned off and use only closed captioning.", "Date": "July 18, 2013"}, {"Title": "As Seen On TV", "Author": "Novakat", "ReviewID": "REP2KGAGMRYCD", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "The tv was in perfect condition, shipped quickly and the picture, sound and options are exactly what was advertised.
