{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Absolutely great plasma TV", "Author": "Michele Monroe", "ReviewID": "R2WUJB4B8EOXM0", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I purchased this TV a couple of weeks ago and absolutely love it.  We put it on our fireplace mantel, but we were a little concerned that it would be too high to see the picture.  Amazingly, the picture looks great, not only while sitting on the couch, but from any angle in the living room.  The picture never looks too dark either.  I watched The Matrix on it this morning and the picture was beautiful and I could see everything perfectly.The reason I didn't give this TV 5 stars, is because of the few things that are not included with the TV purchase:* TV does not come with a stand.  You are expected to either mount it on a wall or pay $180+ for the optional stand (which I did).* TV does not come with cables of any kind.  If you think you'll be able to twist in the cable TV cord into the back of the TV like on a regular TV, you can't.  On a basic cable box (which does not receive HD channels) you can connect using an S-video connection.  If you have an HD cable box, you can use the component video connection.  I did not feel like waiting for the cable company to bring out a new HD box, so I connected mine to the TV with the S-video and used the component video for my DVD player.* TV does not come with speakers.  You have to either purchase the optional speakers or you can use speakers you already have and connect them in the connections for the speaker wire.Nonetheless, it is a fantastic TV and I am very happy with my purchase.", "Date": "December 4, 2004"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "Unavailable", "Features": "852 x 480 display resolution, 1.08 mm dot pitch\n4,000:1 contrast ratio, 16:9 aspect ratio\nWide 160-degree horizontal and vertical viewing angles\nCan be stacked and tiled, ideal for large venues\nAccepts PC, composite, component RGB, S-video inputs", "Name": "Panasonic TH-42PWD6UY Widescreen Professional 42\" Plasma Display", "ImgURL": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/4119IWqUXEL._SX300_.jpg", "ProductID": "B0002J1IZ0"}}
