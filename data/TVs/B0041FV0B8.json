{"Reviews": [{"Title": "New Sony 3D KDL-55NX810, Excellence", "Author": "D. Mcdermott", "ReviewID": "R2ATYSQY03IJ2X", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Just received this new Sony and it is everything Sony claims it to be.  Absolutely the best picture I have seen in a LCD TV and better than my 3 yr old 46XBR4 that had the fluorescent backlighting.  This NX has a dynamic(local dimming) edge lit LED, and the contrast and blacks are excellent.  The 3D is stunning with little ghosting, even with 3D set for max effect.  I coupled this NX810 with Sony's new Blu-RAy S770, and the picture is stunning, as good or better than any theater, and better than my previous LCD TV combo.  I have noticed that the NX810 could be brighter.  I find myself using the 'vivid\" picture setting during the day as the TV display was darker than desired when using standard or custom and lacked bright colors.  As such, I can not use the cinema scene setting or theater mode during daylight and some DVDs with lots of 'dark scenes' do not show well with simulated 3D during daylight periodsMy one complaint is that the sound is not what you would expect from a $3K new Sony.  The sound is a cheap sound(tinny),and did not meet by expectations since it has 3 speakers built-in.  I ended up adding on the $359 NX810 optional stand (Bushin)(SU-B550S) that includes a better 2.1 sound system to compensate.  This one option proved to be worth every penny as the audio is now full and deep.I am still playing with the video settings, but I have noticed that imperfections of the incoming signal are much easier to discern than my previous LCD.  In fact on the same broadcast, a bad shimmer in the background, will go away and a brilliant fine detail picture comes on when they shift cameras like in a news broadcastThis NX has wired Ethernet and wireless connectivity, and the streamed HD video from Amazon is excellent.  In order for you to stream Dolby 5.1 audio, you must select 'audio system' on speakers to output 5.1 to your surround sound amp or you will only get PCM.  The NX has LED edge lighting but with local dimming and it results is great contrast.  Not sure if the HX909 full LED array backlighting would result in a much better picture.I also am very happy with the 3D effects.  Playing a movie made for 3D, gives you great 3D depth effect, almost as good as the theater.  Using simulated 3D on my Avatar Blu-Ray disk resulted in good 3D but the depth was not as good as the movie theater.  Trying simulated 3D on sports also added depth to many scenes, especially the football if the camera angle was right.You can buy this TV with a free bundle (various vendors offer the free bundle) that includes everything you need for 3D (transmitter + 2 glasses), plus the bundle gives you a 3D Alice + HDMI cable.  So, with the bundle you get everything the LX900 has AND with better picture since the LX is only edge LED with  no local dimming.Overall very happy with this purchase.  My only complaint is the \"tinny\" sound-probably because the speakers are on the backside of the TV and directed either backwards or down as compared to my old XBR4 which had great audio quality and had speakers on either side", "Date": "October 13, 2010"}, {"Title": "Gorgeous Television", "Author": "BeccaM \"Technowitch\"", "ReviewID": "R2MFBL9MSHI2M5", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "We bought this Sony Bravia NX810 to replace an older Hitachi 1080i HD-DVI projection TV, one which never failed to dominate and totally overpower any room in which we put it, because the cabinet was so huge.  Even moving it from one house to another required partial disassembly, and both pieces were mega-heavy.  Three factors went into our decision to shop for a new set:  We didn't want to move the old one again, save to load it onto a donation truck.  Second, although still functional, we were noticing some loss of contrast and fuzziness that no amount of convergence adjustment or cleaning could fix.Finally, Amazon's holiday 'Cyber-Week' discount pricing and combination bundle deals (3D accessory kit w/Alice 3D AND a 160GB 3D-capable PS3, both free) were way too good to pass up.So in my usual meticulous way I checked out all the offers of comparably-sized sets on Amazon, as well as reviews online, and I even made a trip to our local Costco to check out their display sets, so I could see for myself the difference between regular LCD, edge-lit LED LCD, plasma, and DLP televisions.  Of all of them, it seemed to me the Sony KDL-55NX810 blew the rest away, with only a few of the plasma models coming even close.  Between the Samsung and the Sony 3D set-ups there in the store, I felt the latter had the superior 3D effects and shutter glasses, plus overall the Sony looked to be the better quality.Unlike some folks who bought through Amazon, we had no problem with the Pilot freight shipping.  They arrived right within the scheduled time, unboxed the TV, attached it to its base and put it on the cabinet we already had set and ready for it.  I had done some prep work, and have a highly customized home theater set-up, so for testing I just took our older Sony blu-ray player and hooked it directly into the TV with an HDMI cable.  Having read here about some of the problems of dead sets on arrival or display issues, I'd decided it was only prudent to ensure proper functioning BEFORE the installers left.  There were no problems or issues in the TV itself; later I'd find some oddities with the HDMI connections which I now suspect were either cable and/or hand-shaking issues.Pros:- Beautiful, sharp, bright picture, with a high degree of customization possible for personal preference, room conditions, and even decent automatic adjustments based on what the TV thinks you're watching- 3D was even better than what I sampled in the store, although it does take a little getting used to.  Very nice with video games, and good with movies.  (We don't have DirecTV, so I can't comment on their 3D programming.)- Surprisingly wide viewing angles without any distortion or drop-off.- Integration with other Sony equipment is seamless, so much so that I sometimes have to check to remember whether I'm controlling the TV, or the PS3, or our older no-feature Sony blu-ray player.  The TV can even turn on/off and control the volume of our home theater receiver through the HDMI line.- No problem getting the TV to connect to our home wireless-N network, and the signal is strong enough to stream Netflix without interruption or quality down-stepping.  Nice feature about the NX810 is it has wireless and wired Ethernet built right in.- The provided Sony remote control is pretty nice and well laid out, but has no learning capabilities.  (I suspect my spouse is getting me a new universal remote for Christmas...).Cons:- Some HDMI set-up issues for us.  Our Denon receiver is supposed to be able to route full HDMI signals to the TV, and to support the latest HDMI standards (including 3D), but it doesn't -- TV says there's no signal.  So I connected all our equipment directly to the TV instead, and that helped, and I can get the receiver to work, but reliably only after I added an optical cable to serve as audio return -- which isn't supposed to be necessary either.  I've ordered a better/newer HDMI cable to see if this helps.  Meanwhile though, the TV does manage to control volume and power on/off for the receiver through the HDMI connection.  So I'm still puzzling this one out; if folks have any suggestions, I'd love to hear them.- Didn't like the motion-flow default settings.  As other reviewers mentioned, while it might appeal to some, it tended to make TV shows and movies look weird and soap opera-ish.  No other way to describe it, just that it didn't seem natural.- As other reviewers have noted, the built-in speakers are rather weak, tinny, with little bass.  You can get better sound out of even a hundred dollar 2.1 computer speaker set.  Really Sony?  Why not include an inexpensive passive sub-woofer with the TV, and beef-up the built-in audio power and speakers just a little?  It's worth noting however that none of the thin-screen TVs I checked out had what I'd consider home-theater quality sound.- Internet video streaming does require a high-speed broadband connection.- There just aren't that many 3D movies out there yet, and a few of the high-demand ones are locked into ridiculously long exclusivity deals. (I'm looking at you Panasonic: Your reportedly year-long \"Avatar\" lock-in actually made me -less- likely to buy your product, not more, because I found the exclusion deal personally offensive, even though I really want to see that film in 3D again.)- The 3D glasses are somewhat on the heavy side, but this is the case with any shutter glasses.  When watching 3D movies, you might want to take breaks, at least until you get used to wearing them for extended periods.Recommendations:- Do have the location ready for when the installers arrive, that way you can have them set up the TV and you can really check to make sure the TV is working right.  Don't let them leave until you're certain you're satisfied with the TV.  Fact is though, no matter where you buy it, there can be problems during shipping and/or delivery.- Try to buy big-ticket items like this from stores and vendors with a no-hassle returns policy.  Amazon's is great, with 30 days to decide whether you like the TV or not, or to uncover product defects.- If you don't have an existing home theater audio set-up, I do recommend getting one of those powered TV speaker cabinet-stands they sell, or else a nice 2.1 Harmon-Kardin (or comparable) computer speaker set and hook those up to the TV, either through the audio out in the back or use the headphone jack.- If you have kids or rambunctious pets, absolutely do ensure the TV is either attached to the wall using a VESA-standard mount, or that the table-top mount is fastened/screwed to the supporting cabinet.  It's an important safety measure.- Check your HDMI cables.  Although older cables will usually work, there can be performance and feature issues with old or low speed ones.  It's essential to use a high speed cable between your 3D blu-ray player and the TV.  (Hint: Use the cable that comes with the 3D accessory kit for the 3D blu-ray to TV connection. It's guaranteed to work.)- Make sure to go through all the papers and fliers that come with the TV -- we discovered among them a number of unadvertised special promotion items, including several free PS3 3D games (free for download, enter a scratch-off code) and two bonus 3D blu-ray discs (Bolt (yay!) and Michael Jackson (meh)) just for registering our set online with Sony, plus subscription offers for Netflix, Hulu Plus, and more.Would we recommend this TV to a friend?  Yes, definitely.On edit, August 18 2011: Well, we've had the set for eight months now, and continue to be very happy with it. Nearly all of the audio problems I reported before were apparently HDMI cable-related, but here's the thing: I was always using the correctly rated cables. It's just that some work between one device and another, but move them to a different device and they don't. Or just never properly at all. Anyway, if you get audio cut-out problems or failure for devices to be recognized, my recommendation now is always \"get another HDMI cable.\"", "Date": "December 13, 2010"}, {"Title": "Disappointing Initial Experience", "Author": "G. de Simone", "ReviewID": "RR1TSQKB4A1WI", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I'm writing a review for the second unit that I've received from Amazon, since the first one was damaged on arrival. Before getting into the details of the TV itself, the first nasty experience I can report is with Pilot, the company that Amazon contracted for the delivery. They seem to handle products in a rough manner, and Sony certainly didn't package the TV to handle that kind of abuse. The glass surface that covers the display is pretty but very thin, and as such it shattered easily when the box was mishandled. I would recommend against buying this set unless you can get a different shipping company to deliver it to your home.Moving on to the actual unit, here's the Pros:- Stunning design. It is easily the prettiest TV in its price range. It doesn't have ugly, useless, transparent borders or colored bezels that glow or simply waste space. It is also reasonably thin, but nowhere near the paper-thin stuff you see from Samsung.- Great menu navigation. This TV uses the standard cross-bar navigation I have first seen on the PS3, but somehow it works a lot better than on the console, perhaps because there are fewer items to scroll through, and they are easier to understand.- Great image quality (minus one nasty problem I'll discuss later). It doesn't look any better (or worse) than a comparable set by Samsung or LG, but Sony's implementation of motion-blur reduction (\"motionflow\") appears to be much better than what I've seen on Samsung TVs. On other sets, people normally turn this feature off, and it gained the dubious nickname of \"soap-opera effect\". On this TV, the feature seems to work as advertised, and it doesn't get too much in the way (and, it can always be turned off)....and here's the more disappointing aspects of this set:- When the TV is on, it shows two dark spots (more like black clouds 1 inch in diameter). The black spots show only over bright images, and you would not notice them over a dark background. This is a defect that seems to be common for this particular model. It's very disappointing because it appears to be caused by a design problem in the TV itself, and shows poor product design. There are two round \"objects\" inside the TV (pegs/screws/whatever) that are dangerously close to the panel. The constant vibration that happens when TV is shipped cross-country causes these objects to poke the screen from the back, damaging it. The black spots caused by them have an irregular shape, but are always at the same locations: roughly mid-left and mid-right. In my own unit, you can gently tap the TV from the back to see these two round shapes pressing against the display (no other area of the TV shows any feedback when tapped so delicately). Needless to say, Sony will have to send a repairman to fix it, but one worrisome aspect of this design flaw is that it may be a problem that can be triggered rather easily. If you end up buying this TV as I did, I would recommend to keep the original box and not to stuff it inside your average moving truck on your next move. I would also recommend *against* laying the TV down flat during transportation. Unless one knows exactly how the TV looks like on the inside (and I'm not about to break mine just to find out) it would be hard to guess how easily those two round pegs can shake up and down and damage your display.- There is practically no bass coming out of its speakers. If you're listening to speech, the quality is great but you'll miss out on movie soundtracks, explosions, etc. Given that the TV is not as thin as many comparable sets by Samsung and LG, I was really hoping Sony was using the extra space to cram a bit more power in the built-in speakers. If you plan to hang your TV on the wall (after all, it looks stunning) you will probably be disappointed unless you hook it up to more powerful speakers, and none of those look quite as good as the TV itself.[UPDATE BELOW]I'm finally able to update my review, since the repair guy working on behalf of Sony finally fixed the TV. In the process, I got a chance to look at innards of the TV in great detail, which had some surprises. Here's some useful information:- The speakers included with the TV are indeed extremely small, but I was told by the repairman that they are fairly standard for a TV this size. The obvious design tradeoff of making TVs thinner is that there just isn't any room left for audio components.- The built-in WiFi connectivity is given by a tiny device that looks very similar to those installed in desktop PCs. The antennas are placed at the bottom of the bezel, one in the middle of the TV and one towards the bottom-right edge.- In what seems like a very silly move, the replacement panel sent by Sony is really not just the panel itself. It is 90% of the TV. The replacement includes the whole front glass (which is not detachable from the panel itself) as well as a logic board. The \"repair\" involves ripping out components from your old TV and the plastic cover in the back, and slapping them onto the new panel.- The repair was \"interesting\" because the new panel came with its own T-Con board, but this board refused to communicate with the logic boards ripped out of my first set. The repair guy had to swap these T-Con boards too, and I'm not sure if there is a quality difference in the output of the TV using one board design with a display that is different than the one originally installed at the factory.- The replacement panel was manufactured by the same company, but it did not have the same product code. No big-name brand was recognizable on the back, but this discrepancy might explain why the included \"T-Con\" board wasn't happy and required swapping.- It seems pretty silly that Sony chooses to incur labor and bureaucracy costs rather than simply replacing the TV. Keep in mind that the repairmen aren't Sony employees: they come from a local company that fulfills these support requests on behalf of Sony. The company that was sent to me was called Stereo Component Services (from Boston) and did an excellent job.- Finally, the image generated by the replacement panel looks comparable to the first one, sans the nasty black spots. If you end up buying this set I sincerely hope yours will just come in perfect working condition. My TV, after all the work performed on it, is really not the same on the inside as one that is factory assembled, and who's to say after that \"T-Con\" board swap that things are working exactly as they should.Having played with the TV in working condition for the first time, I have now upgraded my rating from 3 to 4 stars. The reason is that with a display quality comparable to other brands (LGs and Samsung, specifically), the Sony menu system in my opinion beats them hands down. I compared it closely with a new set from LG (which is a great set by all other means) and I came away appreciating the less-cluttered, down-to-the-point approach of the Sony. The LG had giant tacky icons and a slower input selection method, and it was organized in a less logical manner.", "Date": "December 9, 2010"}, {"Title": "Picture is sensitive to viewing angle, very

another TV so I could move that one to another room.  I wanted to get one that was bigger and was actually looking to get another Samsung, but then I found the Sony with a $1000 online coupon.  When I saw that it was Sony's top 55\" model and all of the spectacular reviews on Amazon, I thought I had found a major steal.  However, when I set it up and turned it on, I was highly disappointed when I noticed how badly the colors change when I change my viewing angle. Depending on which side I am sitting, the colors on the opposite side become washed out.  I watch a lot of basketball, and the colors on the court are uneven with the colors on the far side being significantly lighter.  At one point, I paused it on the starting lineups using my TiVo, and it showed colors below the players that was supposed to be uniform.  However, the colors were clearly showing up in different shades.  If I moved from one side of the TV to the other, the effect was reversed.  I am not sitting at a steep angle either, just on opposite ends of my sofa.  If I view from the center, both sides are more washed out than the center, although not quite as badly.  I am not certain if this problem is just inherent of a TV this size or if mine is defective somehow.  I don't see how the effect could be this pronounced, but nobody else has a problem with it or at least mentioned it.  For a TV this expensive, I definitely would not expect it to have this problem, especially considering my cheaper two year old TV does not.", "Date": "December 23, 2010"}, {"Title": "Excellent", "Author": "Chad", "ReviewID": "R3CRM0FQ3J0ZBK", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Received this set yesterday.  Exceeds all expectations upgrading from a still very nice 2 year old touch of color 52 inch Samsung.Image is wonderful, deep blacks and smooth refresh rates.  Haven't had the chance to play with the 2d-3d conversion or any proper 3d at all.User interface is brilliant compared to the Samsung set i've been using. Very responsive and quick menus.Pictures do not do this tv justice.  You really have to see it in your living room to appreciate how beautiful the design aethetics are.  Full glass front, no plastic bezel. Solid feeling in every aspect.  Easy to put together.Not currently mounted but it looks to be easy enough if needed.", "Date": "November 24, 2010"}, {"Title": "Great", "Author": "Adam", "ReviewID": "R3H6PNQ4LD6UVV", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I love this tv,  I also have a Pioneer Elite plasma, and a Samsung B630 lcd and this blows both of them away.  Black levels are amazing especially in dark lighting.  I didn't buy it for the 3D, but I am really happy I got the 3D starter kit for it.  3D video games look amazing on it.  3D works well up to 18 feet away(haven't tried further).The 240hz is great for video/movies, and can easily be bypassed and programmed off on video games.  No lag whatsoever with fast pace games.  I always thought 240 was kind of BS but the tv is infact way smoother with blurays and streaming video than my 120hz Samsung.  I see no motion differences with my plasma in all frame rates (24,30,60)The internet is kinda lame, yeah it has Netflix but what doesn't.  Most of the widgets are slow and redundant.  Get a PS3 or a bluray player and get 1000x better online experience.The onscreen menu is perfect, and easy to navigate quickly.  Same crossbar sony has been doing for a while but seems way more responsive and quicker than my sony receiver, and bluray player.  My only disappointment with the menu is the lack of control you have with picture settings.  Most of the modes and features only offer 2-3 settings like high or off, or low, or high, or off.  I would like to change the dynamic lighting, contrast, and red balance more than available. The red's are overwhelming, I can't seem to tone the reds down without dulling every other color too much.  I really shouldn't say overwhelming, but I notice overly red scenes often and it is the only drawback with the picture quality.  I'm no calibrating expert, but I find myself messing with the pic settings constantly because of overly red skin tones etc.Contrast is it's strong point.  The brightness can being literally blinding, while the darks blend as black as the glass black bezel.  I have never seen a TV able to to that, my plasma doesn't get bright enough, and my lcds look more like a dark dark gray.  The tv runs ice cold too, hardly any heat comes off of it, even after 5-6 hours straight use.My only dislikes with the set are minor.  The remote is horrible, it lights up but in a way that you only see outlines of the buttons and not what the buttons are labeled.  The blue lighting is cool, but turns off after a couple seconds and serves no practical purpose.  After a month, I still can't memorize half of the obscure function buttons and constantly find myself holding my cellphone light up to it when in the dark.  The 10degree tilt of the pedestal makes it look kinda ghetto from the side.  This is the first tv I have had the desire to hang on the wall and that is solely because of the broken looking lean the pedestal has towards the front.I rate this tv a 92/100, a better remote and a better pedestal would have bumped it to a 97.  Three points off because there isn't quite enough picture settings to make this a perfect picture.You can't go wrong with this set", "Date": "December 9, 2010"}, {"Title": "Critical buyers read this.", "Author": "J. Rose", "ReviewID": "RJ11TYWM2R8EI", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I have a 2 year old Sony 52\" LCD that is absolutely fantastic so I must say that I am a fan of Sony. HOWEVER, when going to get this TV (3D) I scrutinized all the TVs on the market. Panasonic has a good 3d tv. I can't knock it too much other than to say that the new Sony Monolithic design is a little nicer looking and the menus are much easier to use. As for picture quality I would say they are equal, however you should look at both before you buy.Now, in regards to the Sony models available, this is by far the best they have for the price. The LX and HX series TVs are almost identical with the exception of some motion sensor that turns off the tv when you are not in the room. That is definiely not worth the $600 more.The GREATs are :-Design-monolithic design is nice and clean looking. Solid flat glass front is slick.Would look extremely nice on a wall.-Size. Overall this TV is very thin. Maybe an inch to inch 1/4. Inputs are recessed and side facing so you could literally hang this flat on a wall.-Internet widgets and Streaming TV. These types of TV services (like netflix and Amazon Video on demand) are going to change the way you watch TV and with their access built right into this TV, it is going to take your movie watching experience to a whole new level of ease. I rented one movie already from Amazon and the picture was incredible. You would think that streamed movies would be low quality however this is not the case. HD movie was superb blu-ray quality.3D Quality- I have never been a big lover of 3D until now. This new 3d they have is really cool. Kids love it too. For me the glasses are difficult to wear for a whole movie, but not impossible. If you are watching a good movie you will forget you have them on. If you are watching something boring (see my review on Dinosaurs Alive) then you will be itching to take them off.The NOT SO greats are :-Sound. Other people have mentioned it and it is true. The sound is a little tingy. Not outrageously so, but if you have a TV with better speakers you will notice a slight difference. I believe part of the issue is that the speakers are on the bottom of the TV (for the monolithic design to work). Is this a deal breaker? No. But something to be aware of if you are highly critical. (UPDATE) I have had the TV for a month now and will definitely get a sound system. Speakers on TV are just not cutting it)-Input/Outputs. This is just a fact of new TVs I have found, but Sony has reduced the number of \"older\" style inputs on all their new TVs. Not an issue if you are going all HDMI, however if you still have some older equipment that uses component or composite inputs there is only ONE of each of these and get a load of this..... NO S-Video. I was kinda shocked at that. So if you are using an older device, you will have to use the composite video instead of S-video which will not look as great. This could almost be a deal breaker because this limits what you can use with your TV and really it is a little too soon to start phasing these inputs out already. I know all new Sonys are like this however did not check that feature out on the Panasonics.-Brightness. Others have mentioned this too and it is true that the TV appears to be \"less bright\" than older LCDs, however I think this may be a energy conservation thing. You can fiddle with the settings to get a brighter picture and when I say less bright I am comparing to my older LCD TV. This does not mean this Tv is dim. It is not dim. Just less bright than my older LCD.-3D Glasses- these are outrageously expensive. They list for $149 EACH. I searched the interent and found a one day sale for $99 which is still too much. Cant find them now for under $125.Overall this is an excellent TV. I would buy this again. I lucked out and got the starter package which included 2 pairs of glasses and the 3d sync for free so this was a good investment for my family.

I knew I wanted a bigger screen, 3D and wanted something that felt like an upgrade. This TV did not disappoint.I considered buying the Samsung 55UNC8000 but after the overwhelming issues with the processing and power cycle, I kept away. I also looked at the LG LX9500 but heard of spotty quality control issues with LG. Not to mention that my current 2010 LG, has been a massive pain with its random power issues (blinking red light and TV shutoff common with LG's. Just Google \"LG blinking red light\".) Then when the Toshiba 55WX800 came out with its rock bottom pricing of $1600, I jumped all over it only to be sorely disappointed in the quality. It felt like an entry level model and I was really looking for an upgrade. A lot of people seem to like the TV enough, so maybe I just got a severely bum model? In any case, watching the 2010 HDTV Shootout really sealed the deal for me on this. Sony's NX810 rivaled LG's LX9500 (both also trumped Sharp's offering and the Samsung 55UNC800) for the top set in picture quality, colors and black levels. What put Sony over the edge is the far superior 3D experience.I paid $2,249.00 for this TV from Amazon.com and it included the 3D starter kit and a free Playstation 3. It also came with 3 3D blu-ray movies (Alice in Wonderland 3D, Bolt 3D and Michael Jackson's This is It 3D. The later two are in the form of vouchers in the box.) and 4 download'able 3D PS3 games. Since I am selling my PS3, this TV ends up costing me around 2K which is a stellar value. The Toshiba seemed like a steal at $1600 and I'd happily pay an extra $400 for this model any day.A note about delivery from CEVA. I ordered this from Amazon on Friday and CEVA delivered it the following Monday at lunchtime with a smile. One business-day later with no issues or damage is a nearly flawless delivery process if you ask me. :)Here are my pros/cons for the 55NX810:Pros- Design. The monolithic design is without question the best look LCD available. It's no wonder Sony is moving all their new 2011 models to this new standard \"look\". It's sleek, modern and very minimalistic.- Black Levels. Some of the deepest I've ever seen (including plasma.) Panasonic's VT25 series is no doubt the best for black levels, you you'd be hard pressed to find an LCD or other plasma with better blacks.- Motion processing. It's a Sony. Enough said, you get the world renowned Bravia PRO engine . It really makes viewing feel like a completely new experience.- 3D. Best 3D image available on the market today. Also does regular 2D to 3D TV conversion which is okay. You really just want to watch 3D content in 3D anyway.- Absolutely NO clouding/flashlighting whatsoever! The dynamic local dimming works like a charm! I was VERY worried about this because everyone kept telling me that \"every LED has this issue\". Well let me tell you, they're wrong. I am as picky as they come and I looked and looked and looked for this and couldn't find any of it whatsoever.Cons- Stand feels wobbly. I know I listed that in my Toshiba review, but I'm afraid to say this one feels very unstable as well. Likely a bi-product of the slim, minimal design and slim pedestal.- Price. Although I got a stellar deal from Amazon, the MSRP's on Sony TV's are still a hefty premium. But if you have the money, you might as well buy the best.Since people always comment on picture quality (aka: POQ) of high-end displays and never publish their actual settings, I've included mine below. Personally, this annoys me because many of these people never say that they're looking at (for example) VIVID picture setting or something. So NO WONDER it looks so saturated and like a box of melted Crayola's! Anyway, these settings are a modified version of professionally calibrated THX settings for the Sony 55NX810. I also used the Blu-ray WOW and Blu-ray DVE disks and tweaked a couple things to help the black level, colors, dimming and motion control suit my personal taste, but otherwise they're pretty close to the THX rep's final settings. THX calibrations generally mean minimal video processing and everything set to \"off\". Personally, I find the \"low\" settings to be much better looking and seem to fair better in the WOW/DVE calibrations.Mode: CustomBacklight: 4 (THX says 3, but this is largely personal preference)Picture: 77 (THX says 76)Brightness: 48 (THX says 50)Color: 54 (THX says 52)Hue: 0Color Temp: Warm 1 (THX says Warm 2)Sharpness: 2 (THX says 0)Motionflow: Standard (THX says off)CineMotion: Auto 2 (THX says off)Advanced SettingsBlack Corrector: Low (THX says off)Adv.

I thought I might be \"settling\" when I got my refund from Samsung and went with the 55nx810 as it is a bit smaller, but it turned out that it is everything I hoped the Samsung would be and more.The blacks are incredible on this set, and rival the best plasmas out there, IMO.  While maybe not the finest set of adjustments you can make to the picture relative to some competitors, the end result after calibration is absolutely incredible in both 2D and 3D alike and shows maybe major adjustments just were not needed here.Sound, as many have already noted is poor, but I don't use internal tv speakers anyway, so it is irrelevant to me.  The widgets and apps are pretty extensive although I use my blu-ray player for that, so again, not much use to me.One thing I would be remiss to not mention is the set looks absolutely incredible!  The glass screen was a major concern for me as my eyes are particularly sensitive to glare (and that was a major issue with the first Samsung for the 45 minutes it worked before dying - the other 2 never worked), but Sony has done a great job of eliminating it and my eyes have no problem with it at all.Motion blur is also nonexistent on this set and colors are spot on accurate after easy calibration.  I did notice some clouding on the black background when in 3D mode, but it seems this only happens when the backlight is turned all the way up to max for 3D (to accommodate the darkness of the glasses), and is absent when watching 2D material when dynamic LED control is set to standard and the backlight is turned down for normal viewing.Bottom line is Sony has a winner here, and I am very happy that in the end I wound up with what I feel is the better set after all the Samsung problems.Edit 3/8/11: For reference, here are my revised settings for both 2D and 3D after further evaluation (and help from an AVS discussion board member)For 2D/3D TV and BlurayEco Settings: Ambient Light Sensor = OFFScene = GeneralMode = CustomBacklight 3 (automatically set to Max for 3D) *Please note this backlight setting is for a semi-dark to dark room.Picture 76Brightness 50Color 52Hue 0Color Temp Warm2Sharpness MinNoise Reduction OffMPEG Noise Reduction OffMotion flow OffCineMotion Auto2 for Blu-ray and set to off for HDTV/CableAdvanced SettingsBlack Corrector OffAdv.

For me, that means you don't have to clean the dust out from those tiny little corners!- While SONY has a very intuitive INITIAL SETUP sequence to make set up as simple as possible, there's a plethora of other system/video/audio settings beyond the initial set up that people should look at before talking about bad the sound and other things are before they have properly configured their set.  This is a very advanced TV.- USB supports 2.0. and video playback of AVCHD/MP4 files using the H.264 video codec only.  AVI/MKV/WMV, etc - not suppoted.  Not yet, anyway.- DLNA supported, for sharing pictures, movies, music, and other digital content.- The SONY logo lights up!  It can be turned off.  The light is soft and won't affect TV viewing for most people.PICTURE QUALITY- All you need to know is that the picture quality is amazing.- Full range of adjustments from color temperature, sharpness, LED intensity - the videophiles will be pleased.- The only problem you might experience is when using the Light Sensor technology with the TV inside a cabinet at night.  I experienced some flickering caused by the Light Sensor technology trying to compensate for the brightness of the room, but in fact, it was detecting the light coming from the TV itself and everytime a bright scene appeared on the TV, the Light Sensor mode would reduce the brightness of the TV until a dark scene and then raise the brightness again - very annoying.- 3D still presents a little ghosting here and there, but that's mostly due to Sony's glasses.  I would recommend purchasing the universal glasses from XPAND.  Sony glasses serve their purpose, but XPAND glasses will greatly improve your 3D experience.SOUND and SPEAKERS- Not the greatest, but not as bad as other reviewers make it out to be, either.  With a few simple changes in the audio settings, it sounds like a normal TV speaker.  99% of people who buy a flat panel of this size are going to hook it up to a sound system anyway.- Built-in EQUALIZER and audio enhancement modes.  I thank SONY for adding this feature because you can tailor the sound to your ears' desires.- AUDIO RETURN CHANNEL (ARC).  You can set the TV to use the same cable that outputs your signal from the receiver to the TV for sending audio back to the receiver when you are watching broadcast TV.  Make sure you buy an HDMI cable that is specifically designed for audio return channel if you intend to use this feature.INTERNET CONNECTIVITY and APPS- Built-in wireless adapter = no need for an Ethernet cable!- Very easy to set up.  The TV walks you through it.  I connected on the first try.- Apps are excellent.  Streaming movies works great.  Widgets are another story - slow, but most owners probably won't use them anyway because you can get all your updates easier via iPhone/Droid/Galaxy or personal computer.  If you do choose to use them, they are very customizable and you have a wide range to choose from.  You can even set them to appear in any area of the screen you choose.- SONY starts you off with free online movies from CRACKLE.  I've watched dozens for free already!  Or set up your own AMAZON VOD/NETFLIX/HULU PLUS accounts.FINAL WORDS- This is my very first flat panel.  I waited and passed up much of this technology until I knew I had found a good product that was worth my hard-earned money, and this is it, folks.  I am very pleased with my purchase. 5 stars.- Everyone that has seen it loves it.- The little ones keep asking for more 3D.", "Date": "January 1, 2011"}, {"Title": "flawed USB, netflix, firmware", "Author": "Robert C. Gobeille", "ReviewID": "R17I0650L4JLZH", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "The NX810 works pretty well overall,  you can read other reviews for what's nice.  There is one thing about the TV that ticks me off, and was totally unexpected.  I went though Sony support, to verify this.  The problem is the USB port only works with Sony USB sticks:[...]I tried 4 different non-Sony USB sticks that ranged from 256MB - 2GB and the TV refused them all.  All were formatted as FAT32 as required by the TV.  All work in EVERY other USB device I own.  Personally, I think to advertise USB compatibility and then lock you into their own brand is fraudulent.  For the price of this TV you would think they would at least include one of their USB sticks.The funny thing is that I was trying to use USB to update the sony firmware, which was came outdated right out of the box.  I understand why that happens so it didn't bother me too much.  Sony has good, and simple, instructions on updating the firmware:[...I don't normally go looking for firmware updates on a brand new product, but I was forced to do so because the TV told me I needed the update to access NetFlix.  I guess I was naive when the product said it was ready for netflix, but actually wasn't.  Anyway, I looked for a setting that said \"Update Firmware\" on the TV, but it doesn't work that way.  There is no \"Update now\" functioin.  You either have to set the TV to update automatically, or to use the USB method above.  I left the TV on standby overnight to auto update.  But according to Sony, this takes 24-36 hours, so I still don't have it.One thing I like about this tv is the OFF switch on the side.  This allows you to really turn the TV off.  In case you don't know, most TV's (and many other devices) consume power even when \"off\".  This switch is a real off switch and I applaud Sony for it.  I don't know how common these switches are but this is the first I've seen.Speaking of the OFF switch, remember not to use that power saving feature if you want to do the auto update.  The TV needs to be left in standby for auto update to work.  This is pretty obvious, but just be aware that you can't auto update and save power at the same time.  The TV will warn you if you try to do it.  I wish Sony would have included an \"Update Firmware Now\" setting so I didn't have to leave it on standby, and then keep checking to see if it did it.", "Date": "December 16, 2010"}, {"Title": "Amazon service great - Bad initial Delivery Service", "Author": "kenchi", "ReviewID": "R3MEYNTKVNUYKN", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Got my Sony 55NX810 from Amazon.com which was delivered by Pilot Freight Services.I STRONGLY urge people to have the deliverer check the display before they leave (same outcome though).

For some reason my PS3 didn't recognize the 3D input initially, so I was watching movies in \"Simulated 3D\" which I was not impressed with, only to find out that the PS3 didn't recognize it (until I rebooted)... then WOW!YouTube and other iTV functions worked well, with decent watchable resolution on full screen.I agree with Yahoo Widgets take forever to load, and is laggy.  I couldn't even get my weather to show up because the Widget couldn't connect to their server.

At first I was convinced I wanted plasma due to the best picture quality, so that is the kind of TV I focused on.  Now don't get me wrong, I love plasma, especially the higher end Panasonic lines, but when I saw this TV in the store I was blown away.  Once I found the great price on Amazon, I started to sway, and eventually bit.I am not disappointed.  I don't really care that the TV is LED and very thin opposed to a standard LCD with the CFL back-lighting.  It's nice, it's thin, LED is fine.  I also don't care much about 3D, and I do not have the glasses so I can not comment on that aspect of the TV.  The two things that really get me are the picture quality and the appearance of the TV.  The PQ is wonderful!  This TV replaced a top Sony LCD line from about 5 years ago, and the black levels and details in dark scenes just blow my old TV out of the water.  In some rare cases I do see SLIGHT clouding (another plus for plasma vs LCD), but in other cases the TV screen looks pitch black.  As good of black levels as a plasma?  Probably not, but I don't know that I could tell the difference.  I searched around the internet for settings that people use, and adjusted to one that I found (supposedly professionally calibrated), and it does look better than the normal mode, but it is still pretty good right out of the box.  Just be careful because from playing around with the settings a lot, there are some that make the TV look terrible (\"soap opera\" effect) and I am not even sure why they are an option.  Stick with normal and use movie mode when appropriate, or tweak some settings in custom to your liking and go with that.  Blue Ray and HD TV look great, non-HD programming looks better than expected.  Internet feature is nice, wireless built in is great.  I have played around with amazon video a bit and it does what it says and is fairly fast.  Haven't played around with much else of the internet features yet, but if you are familiar with a PS3 then navigating the features of the internet menu will look familiar.  I can not comment on the sound, but I would also never recommend using the internal speakers on a TV.  Hopefully you at least have an AVR and some external stereo speakers.  Otherwise don't expect much from the sound.The appearance of the TV is gorgeous.  I love the all glass panel, it looks like it doesn't even have boarders when the TV is off.  I have this TV in a fairly bright room with five windows and glare is not an issue.  Viewing angles are good; it is best to view from straight on but all LCD's \"lighten up\" a bit as you move to the sides.  Again, a plus for plasma is they don't have that issue at all.Almost forgot, the stand is a little less sturdy/stable than I would like, but the stand does swivel to about 30 degrees or so (just eyeballing it), which I find to be very nice.  So if you are not hanging the TV on the wall, that is a nice plus.Overall I am sure I would be happy with the great picture quality of a plasma, but when I weighed all the pros and cons, this was the TV for me, and I am very happy with the choice of the Sony 55NX810.", "Date": "March 5, 2011"}, {"Title": "Sony Bravia KDL55NX810 55IN 3D", "Author": "Cds", "ReviewID": "R5N4M3O2Q8RH3", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "The picture is great.

I am glad I did not give up on this set after the defect the first one had. The picture is in a word stunning. This is my 5th HD set and its by far the best picture of any of them. The black levels on this set are really great, so dark its as if the set was turned off. I also have Samsung, LG and previously Sharp sets but the picture on the NX810 is noticeably better. Styling wise nothing compares to this set on the market. The LG 850/950 comes close but has reflective issues with the screen. The Sony screen does a nice job not reflecting every light source in the room. I have the set hooked up to a surround sound system so never listened to the speakers and really only cared about the picture and styling of the tv. I checked out the 3D aspect in the store and its pretty cool but not a priority for me. Note you will need not only glasses and an adapter but a 3D blue ray player as well so unless you get it in a bundle thats some extra change to pay. I opted to skip the thrown in playstation that plays 3D blurays to get a lower price on the set. Sub 2k. Also this connected to my wireless network first try and could not have been easier. I have watched regular shows, sports and blu-ray already on the set and all have been excellent. I never watch any non-HD content so can't comment on what that looks like.There are plenty of cheaper 55 inch sets out there but I feel this one is worth the slight premium over the other sets for the incredible picture quality, connectivity along with the best styling out there. The only style the I have seen that will top this is the LG Nano panels but they are not sold yet in the U.S. and who knows what they will cost when they come over here (less than .5\" thick, search on LG Nano and view images and you will see what I mean.I originally had this set at 2 stars because of the issue with the first set but after some thought and seeing how the second set was packaged I think the first one was a refurbished set or was mishandled by the shipper. I also purchased the first one from a place with the initials t.d. and would not make any large purchase from them again. Its worth a little more to go with Amazon or a reputable B&M; store and have peace of mind that if there is an issue you will not be jumping through hoops.Original Post:As a previous reviewer di Simone mentioned I also had the same issue. Dark spots about 1\" in diameter on the top right and left quadrants of the screen. Easily noticed on light scenes and at first you think the screen needs to be cleaned but its not the case. Slight tapping on the set results in the spots changing shape. These sets clearly need to be shipped with extreme care to reduce the risk of this defect. Other than the dark spots the picture is very nice but for a high end set its not acceptable. Apparently the only fix is panel replacement which is not what you want with a brand new set warranty or not.", "Date": "December 16, 2010"}, {"Title": "so far so good...", "Author": "MayBee \"MayBee\"", "ReviewID": "R2HR2JHSA3RVWD", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This new 55NX810 is an upgrade from a 46 LCD Sharp Aquos.

P.", "ReviewID": "R1ZHH7H3M3IXGT", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I am writing this review because I always use user reviews as a tool when researching large purchases and want to give back. I was forced to purchase from another online retailer because Amazon was out of stock. Everything went smoothly and I have had this TV for over a month now. It's awesome. I am no fan of Sony but this TV is excellent.I researched for a while and this was always at the top of my list (see 2010 HDTV shootout on youtube). In December, I wrongly believed the very positive reviews of the Toshiba WX800 on Amazon and jumped on what I though was a good deal.  What a mistake. Luckily I have corrected my error and picked up a great TV.Design:Sony's Monolithic Design is beautiful. Thin and well built. Nothing feels of looks cheap. The screen is glossy but the Opticontrast panel does an excellent job of muting reflection. This TV can be used in a bright room without fear.Internet:This set has WiFi built in as well as an ethernet port (100mps). I have had no problem using either one. This set is DLNA compliant but your milage will vary on streaming your own video files to it. Picture and music do work flawlessly. There are plenty of internet streaming options (netfilx, qriocity, hulu plus, pandora, etc...) plus yahoo widgets.  The internet streaming options overall work well. The Yahoo widgets I do not use often but when I have their performance has been spotty at best.Picture:This set can achieve really great blacks with shadow details still being visible. Better than any edge-lit LED/LCD I have seen. The key to this is to enable the Dynamic LED setting. It has two options low/standard and both make excellent blacks without degrading the picture in other areas. This feature also eliminates any clouding or flashlighting inherent with LED tech. The colors with a little bit of tweaking are really accurate with no bleeding or oversaturation of any kind. I find this TV is not a bright as other LED/LCD I have seen. I consider this a good thing. It is certainly able to output plenty of light but seems a little bit easier on the eyes than others. The only real minus I have for this TV is the view angles are not great. Blacks and color lighten up quickly when moving maybe 25 or 30 degress of center. This would be my biggest gripe and it is not that major in my viewing environment.Tweaking:There are a bunch of Sony calibrated options called Scene Select avaiable. They include modes such as Game, Text, Sports, Cinema, and Music (for music Videos), assignable to inputs. Additionally, there is General and Auto. Auto should not be used as it sometimes changes your setting. All other can be tweaked to tastes. I found Cinema and General to be the best for a starting point. There are alot of tweaking option avaiable but not near as many as other manufacturers. I wish it had more but you can still achieve a great picture without them.Motion:Sony's Bravia 3 engine does not suffer from the Soap Opera Effect (MotionFlow Set to Clear 1/2) that many other manufactures have. The 240hz panel handles motion really well with no visible artifacting. It should be noted that the Clear 2 setting simulates a 480hz effect but greatly reduces the brightness of the picture.Sound:This is by far the weakest aspect of this TV. It does not sound good out of the box. With alot of playing around in the sound menu I achieved something I can live with but it's still not good. I think a good surround sound system or sound bar is a good investment.3D:You must purchase a external emitter and active shutter glasses to enable 3D. The emitter plugs in to a connector on the back of the TV. I have only watched maybe an hour of 3D. What I watched looked fine. There was some ghosting on background images but nothing to bad. The image was bright and colorful. I didn't really notice a big drop in brightness when using the glasses. The glasses are a little heavy and not really that comfortable. Hopefully over time they improve (Sony or 3rd party). My biggest complaint with 3D is it disables the Dynamic LED setting and brings flashlighting and clouding into play. This set also features a 2D to 3D conversion option. It works best on HD Sports, Video Games and Blurays but it is nothing like true 3D content. It's nice to have but not a must have.Overall if you are buying a 2010 model LCD television look no further than the NX810.

They denied ever getting a pickup request from Amazon and refused to pick up the screen.  I now have two flat panels sitting in my living room as awesome cat perches.  The second screen had the same shadow problem that others have described in detail--about a 2 inch circle located on the top half in the center left and right that looks like a shadow or smudge.  Tapping on the back makes it pop out.  The visual quality is excellent and I liked the menus a lot, but I won't tolerate a defect like this when I paid this much money for it.  I know some people have called Sony to reapir the screen, but I don't want to be stuck with a partially repaired screen.I will add to the prior reviews and say when your delivery comes insist on having them unpack the box.  Also have some hdmi or component cables on hand.  The TV will default to static when you first turn it on and the shadow defects aren't easy to see.  If you have cables plugged in but nothing connected, a light blue screen will show up and make it easy to see the defect.  I notice a brown background is also a good time to see the shadowing.  Unfortunately, Amazon declines to send me a third TV and I now have to send back the parts of the bundle and have nothing to show for my time and effort.  I know this is not so much a review of the picture quality and relevant stuff, but people should be aware that the packaging, shippers, or TV itself is not suited to being sent hundreds of miles and still arrive undamaged.

The Sony KDL55NX810 is a terrific up grade with stunning picture clarity and very black, blacks which matches another of the plasma TV attributes.

First off right out of the box the picture looked great, and with a few tweaks looked amazing. I don't watch standard def these days so I can't comment on that, but the HD from both my cable box (1080i) and Blu-Ray player (1080p) look fantastic, miles better than my 4 year old Sony SXRD.

I drooled at the prospect of being able to see the same at home! Once the 3D sets started trickling out I decided to wait to see if the technology took hold and to see if the content developed. Initially there was very little content, but now it's finally gotten to the point that I decided it was time to take the plunge.I've had a 52\" Bravia for quite some time, it's an older 60Hz set but it's been rock-solid reliable and has a fantastic image. I decided early on that I would stick with a Bravia to replace it. After looking at the various models I settled on the 55\" NX810, mainly because of the built-in Wireless N capabilities and Internet capabilities over the HX800. It's also much cheaper than the LX series with basically the same spec's.I've only had the NX810 set up for a few days, but so far I love it. I honestly can't tell much difference in the 2D images over our older Bravia (that is to say, both display outstanding 2D), but 3D is why I bought it and that is where it really shines. I'm really amazed at the 3D movies, the images are crisp and detailed, color is great (I'm using the out-of-the-box settings) and the 3D depth is excellent. The movies I've watched so far look just as good as they did at the theater, maybe even better due to the smaller image looking so much more detailed than on the big screen. I've also played Wipeout HD in 3D (free download with the set purchase) and it's really incredible, I'm a Wipeout fan from the old days and 3D totally transforms the experience. I'm looking forward to more 3D games in the future (here's hoping the developers get on board!)Despite the bigger screen size, the set is a bit smaller and lighter than our older Bravia. The \"frame\" around the screen is smaller and since the speakers are on the rear it doesn't have the \"speaker bar\" below the screen like the older set. It's also MUCH thinner than the old set. The glass screen is a lot easier to clean too.There have been a lot of complaints about the speakers here on Amazon, but I have mine hooked up to a Bravia surround sound system that automatically boots up when the set is turned on, so I don't really care about the quality of the built-in speakers. Speaking of the surround sound, another nice feature is the TV remote also controls not only the TV but also the surround sound system and its built-in DVD player and also the PS3 (I think this feature only works with Sony equipment). So if I'm playing a blu ray in the PS3 or a DVD in the surround sound player, I can fully control playback using the TV remote.A couple of small complaints I have- for some reason I cannot get the set to stream video off the hard drive attached to my high-end router. I can stream video from the hard drive to the TV via my PS3, but our home videos are high def and sometimes stutter through the PS3 due to it being Wireless G. I was hoping to stream straight to the new TV at the higher \"N\" speed, but so far I can't get it to work. The set \"sees\" the files, but won't play them.

Gerstorff \"Jason G\"", "ReviewID": "R2XWQKT1VZ0RM4", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I did not purchase this from amazon, but have owned it for several weeks now. There are some pretty good reviews so I just want to make a couple of points for anyone considering a purchase.First, this TV is a pretty good deal if you can get half off MSRP. There is NO WAY I could recommend paying anywhere near close to retail. You just can get something for much cheaper than that with equal or better picture quality. I bought this TV to replace a Panasonic 58\" plasma, primarily because I need to mount my television and the plasma weighed 150lbs and this weighed only 60lbs. I thought i would go ahead and upgrade to the 3D and the low energy LED since it will be my last tv for a while.The picture on my Panasonic was STUNNING. The picture on this Sony is excellent, but i feel like its just not quite up to par with the plasma as far as the color and the clarity. The black levels seem better though actually. Now, I have not had this professionally calibrated so maybe that would help. I did make an effort to calibrate it myself using the Disney WOW blu ray, but perhaps I haven't gotten it tweaked as well as i did the plasma. If you are just now moving up to this size/quality of TV, it is doubtful you would be able to find any deficiency in the picture quality. I was just spoiled I guess.Now, about the 3D. The only 3D i have had a chance to experience is through DirectTV, no 3D blu ray or gaming. In general the effect is very cool, but i find that through directv anyway, there is a lot of ghosting which will wear your eyes out VERY quickly. It tends to be that one scene will look completely awesome, and the next will be blurry and cause your eyes to try and focus which ruins the whole experience. The ghosting may not be near as bad with blu ray, I really don't know. But its definitely not ready for primetime through satellite tv. Also, the glasses are poorly designed in my opinion. They should have a much large field of view similar to aviators. Furthermore they are somewhat constricting on the head. You certainly don't forget your are wearing them is my point, and that is a pretty major drawback.So, overall i would recommend this TV if you are an early adopter.

I'm 26 with every one of my electronics being manufactured by Sony and I have yet to buy an electronic made by them that has let me down.This TV didn't let me down, in fact it is far from a let down.  I bought my first flat-screen in 2007/8-ish, a sony 52w4100.  I am in love with it, even to this day.  I moved it to my bedroom and now have it hanging above my dresser.  It feels 10x bigger in a small bedroom than it did in the living room, so that is a plus.  The picture is just as good as the day I bought it.  When I bought it, I knew the PQ was rated pretty high, but the SQ very low.  I knew this going in.  To my pleasant surprise, I got it home and was pleasantly surprised by the SQ.  However, this isn't a review of the 'w'.  This is just my way to show my experience with Sony TV's before I review the 55nx810.Now onto the 55nx810:I bought this knowing the issue surrounding the speakers.  They supposedly stunk.  I knew this, but I knew this about the 52w4100 also.  I was not so lucky with the nx810.  I received the TV, set it up and had it running in no time.  I was thrilled with the PQ, the look of the TV both powered on and off.  This is a great looking TV.  However, as soon as the sound resonates from the speakers, I see it's flaw.Sony spent all their R&D; money on PQ and design, they must have forgotten about the speakers until the day before they boxed the TV to send to me.  The speakers built into the TV sound worse than the 20$ 'portable' speakers you used to buy for a Walkman, the ones that were the size of the Walkman themselves.  In fact, those portable Walkman speakers sounded a bit better, and had more range.  That's bad.  This TV had a $3800 MSRP when it came out.  The Walkman speakers had a $20 MSRP.  Come on Sony.I bought into Sony's plan though, I remedied the crappy speakers with a Sony CT350 soundbar(which sounds great btw).  The TV paired with a nice action packed Blu-ray and the CT350 cranked up, make for one kick @$$ home theater.The only other minor quirk I have is the color was hard to really pin down.  I had to turn the energy saving features off because they really washed out the PQ, then I had to constantly adjust to get a hint of a green or red hue out of the picture.  I understand there is a setting for R and G, but that didn't fix it.  It may be a source issue more than a TV, but it took a while to really pin down the perfect setting. However, now, PQ is exponentially better than my 52w4100.  That says a lot, because when I goto bed and watch the 'W', I am still impressed by that PQ as well.I do recommend this TV, however I want to emphasize how bad the speakers are, and be prepared to hook this into a home theater.  The speakers are the only reason i did not give this 5 stars.", "Date": "March 17, 2011"}, {"Title": "Great TV but Bad Seller", "Author": "MGH", "ReviewID": "R5IXA6L2Q8A2W", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "This is a great TV with excellent picture quality and easy set up.

Please keep in mind that you have to calibrate the picture.  The default setting is too bright and accuracy is not as good as it can be.  The picture is very nice indeed.  The 240HZ won't benefit you much except for use with the 3D.  What people like the most is the anti-judder feature, which Sony calls Motionflow.  High-definition movies will initially impress you like you're looking-outside-a-window type of realism.  Unfortunately, Motionflow does introduce imperfections.  From time to time, I have to turn it off.  I suggest you turn it off for gaming.  The black levels are not quite plasma-black as it has a bluish tint but very good and better than most LCD/LED TV.  Overall the picture is very good.  The built-in WiFi is nice.  The manual power button is a neat touch.  The one-piece front solid glass panel is beautiful.  Though people complain that glass is reflective, glass is better for the light to shine through and won't fade and turn opaque like plastic will.  Having 4 HDMI inputs is very good as well.  The remote control looks good and works decently enough, though the buttons aren't as intuitive in the dark as you'd like.  It's a good thing that the remote has a light button.  The XMB menu is annoying.  It's a pain to use and is still lacking despite being so complicated.  There's no option to skip inputs, rename inputs, rename channels, or update the software manually, to name a few.  The standard stand is flimsy and the TV wobbles.  The built-in speakers are horrible.  People suggested connecting it to a stereo or receiver but that is impractical when wall-mounting it and also defeating the purpose of being an energy saving TV.  For this kind of money, it should come with a built-in 3D emitter.  Overall I like the TV despite some disappointments.  Why 3 stars?  Simple, it's too expensive for what you get.Update: A few months ago Sony sent me a survey and I game them my opinion on what they can improve.  After several updates, they seemed to have listed to my input.  The XMB menu has been upgraded with some options that weren't there before.  Now I can name channels and inputs that I couldn't do before.  There are other enhancements have made the XMB more convenient.  I would prefer a standard menu still but Sony deserves credit for listening to their customers.  I changed my rating from 3 to 4 stars.  The sound quality is still very lacking.  I've owned it 7 months now.

I spent a month or so resarching online and window shopping at Best Buy etc before deciding on the Sony KDL55NX810. Amazon's price wasn't the best I could find but was not familiar with the other vendor and their \"reviews\" on service and delivery weren't stellar. I am  Prime member and have always been a loyal Amazon shopper, however their service on this purchase and several others recently have me rethinking this and in retrospect I should have purchased from the other dealer, as (ironically) I didn't get the peace of mind on service and delivery I was expecting from Amazon.Anyway, the TV......it is fantastic. Looks great, picture out of the box is unbelievable. I haven't taken the time to tweak any of the settings yet as I have been too busy watching it!. The 3D is fantastic, I bought glasses for all 5 of us in my family and everyone thinks it is amazing. My 5 year old will watch entire movies and doesn't complain about the glasses at all.

I haven,t used all aspects of the Sony KDL-55NX810 yet but it may take some time as there are many things it can do.

On January 20th around 10AM, the carrier, Pilot Freight Services called and told me the TV would not be delivered as they do not know where it is..  I was baffled that the courier did not know where a package was, so I called (contacted customer service and they called me) Amazon around Noon and they then contacted Pilot while I was on hold.  They said the truck had not arrived in San Francisco yet, but should arrive in the afternoon between 3-4PM PST.  They said if it got in early enough they could deliver on the guaranteed delivery date.  So now, I am feeling good.  The Amazon rep was friendly and gave me the phone number to directly call Pilot.  They also refunded the shipping cost ($52-) that it would have cost me had I paid for is (Amazon gave me free shipping).  Anyhow, I decide to call Pilot around 5PM to see if they had gotten the TV.  Their website hadn't been updated so I didn't trust that.  I talked to a lady who was not the friendliest and asked if my package arrived with them, she checked and said it was running behind but its last stop was in Ohio and it was in route.  She gave me an estimated time of 8-9PM and said someone would call the next day to reschedule.  I accepted that the TV would be a day late, and accepted her \"sorry\".  I wake up and check online to see if the TV had arrived yet.  Nope, nothing.  Site is exactly the same.  Tells me Scheduled appointment time is January 20th.  I am not very frustrated, so I call up Pilot and ask them where my TV is.  This time I speak to a real a-hole customer service rep.  He tells me that, \"nope, TV's not in San Francisco, and its stuck in Pennsylvania\".  He was very nonchalant about this.  He said, \"look, the weather is bad in the East coast, you have to wait.  Might be in San Francisco by January 24th\".  I asked him why was I told it was in route from Ohio, and he said he didn't know.  He again drilled in that it was still at the warehouse in PA and there was nothing they could do.  I was pretty upset by this, as It was becoming a waiting game.  I'll be honest, I'm pretty impatient and having to wait on a new toy, is never fun.  I started a chat with amazon's customer service who said they would transfer the case to their bulk items team.  I had opened some requests in the past and never heard back.  I told the customer service person my concern over IM, and he assured me he would personally contact me via e-mail in the next 24 hours.  Result, nothing ever came of it.  No e-mails, or phone calls from amazon.  I am pretty disappointed in this too, as I figure when a customer is spending thousands on an item, they might care a little bit more.  But, they dismissed me (again)..-- Summary: --- January 13th - Order Placed, scheduled Delivery for January 20th.- January 20th, 10AM - Pilot Freight Services calls me and tells me they cannot deliver, as they don;t know where the TV is.- January 20th, 12PM - I call amazon.com, they talked to Pilot and said TV would be in around 3-4PM and that I would have TV next day.- January 20th, 5PM - I call Pilot and ask them if they had received TV yet, they said it was in route from Ohio, and would be in around 8-9PM, they would call me the next day to reschedule delivery.- January 21st - I call Pilot and they tell me TV has not yet arrived.  They tell me that the TV is in Pennsylvania and was delayed due to snow. Might arrive January 24th?- January 24th - I call Pilot and they tell me TV has arrived, tried to schedule for the 25th, but made exception to deliver today.  Send two sketchy delivery men with thick accidents.  I decline white glove setup and unpacking and send them on their way.  So yes, I have only had the TV for 24 hours so far, but here are my 2 cents.  I'll update this if I notice anything I don't like.  As far as the TV goes.  It is beautiful!  It is very thin and not as heavy as the 40\" Bravia I replaced this with.  The unpacking was easy (I chose to do this myself, and not use the sketchy \"white glove\" delivery people).  Setting it up was pretty simple too.  It took about 10 minutes and walked me through everything.  I am pretty tech savvy so this was a simple install.  The first thing I did after the initial setup was boot up the PS3.  My first thoughts were, \"Damn!, this TV is huge\".  The picture quality is amazing.  The blacks are much darker due to the edge lit LED technology.  I popped in a game and took it for a quick spin.  Everything was crisp and very responsive.  I then launched my Apple TV, again, beautiful.  Even though it runs (Apple TV) in 720P, its still gorgeous.  I then switched over to my Tivo, and took that for a spin.  TV shows looked great on the new set, my only complaint was that Tivo HD is only 1080i.  The menu interface is kind of pixelated.  I am sure I'll get used to that, and in no way is it Sony's fault.  Getting the 3D to work with the PS3 was a bit tricky, but I found some good video's online to help me out. Check out the link below if you are having issues.  But I popped in Alice in Wonderland and thew on the bulky 3D glasses.  After playing with the sensor bar, 3D was in full effect.  I skipped through the movie to different scenes and was very pleased at the depth of 3D technology and how well Sony implemented it.  I also launched a few 3D games (Motorstorm: Pacific Rift and Pain) and was pleased with the 3D gaming.[...]  Overall, if you can shell out the money for this TV, I'd say do it.  Especially with the current promotion (Free PS3 and 3D Starter Kit).Pro's:- Great Design- Thin and sexy- 3D Capable LED Lit LCD HDTV (Great for gaming)- Feature rich with Sony x-bar (DLNA, Wi-Fi, Netflix, Pandora, etc..)- Has good power savings features (green TV)Con's:- 3D requires an external sensor bar.  Its not ugly, but it should have been built in.- Ginormous remote, come on, who doesn't use an all in one these days (thank you Logitech Harmony)- Glasses required for 3D  One last note... If you decide to buy this, DO NOT use Pilot as your courier.  They are horrible!", "Date": "January 25, 2011"}, {"Title": "Very nicely priced with the playstation 3 and the 3D glasses", "Author": "S.

This I must add is on top of the fact that this unit was already a replacement for the grand wega I owned - that the optical block failed on (in less than 5 years). This saga has been going on since Valentines Day and it already 8th of March and I might see my new TV by Monday. Hence, I'm done with Sony for while.

I have also gotten panasonic plasma sets for my parents.  I'm definitely not a professional TV reviewer, but I try to get get a balanced picture for my family needs, which is mostly TV, some movies, a little computer/picture viewing, and maybe some PS3 when I get it hooked up.One of the big reasons I bought this TV besides the pretty good reviews from others, was the physical styling of the set.  It is one of the best looking TV's out there.  And I wanted a TV that physically looked cool/sleek to complement the TV.  Before I strictly bought TV's soley on price and picture quality.  This time, I took family room decor into consideration, and this TV has amazing styling.But, the down side is it's taking me a lot of work to get the picture to look good on this set.  I feel confident that it can and will be done, but I will have to go through a lot of menu settings to tweak it just right.  This part, I was dissappointed in since my previous SONY 52V5100 took minimal adjustments - actually, it looked great right out of the box.  This TV suprised me with super reds that need to get toned down without getting greenish skin.  Also, I will need to figure out how to get the white levels to match well.  I will say that the black levels on this TV, a big player in the picture quality, are fantastic.As with other other LED TV's this TV is very thin and begs to be wall mounted to get the full WOW effect from it's styling.  But I personally like to leave it on a TV stand for easy access to the input jacks and to facilitate TV upgrades.  Now, while stable when left alone, it does feel somewhat wobbly/fragile on the included stand when you turn the TV.  Furthermore, some people have commented on AVSForums about the TV sitting slightly crooked on the stand.  Just make sure that the pins are aligned correctly when set up and hopefully your TV will be straight standing.The menu system is fairly easy to use with the remote.  Actually, it's very similar to to the PS3's menu.  My biggest qualm is the lag time it takes to \"zoom\" the picture.  After you press the \"wide\" button, the TV has. To think about 1-2 seconds before letting you choose the zoom.  This can be slightly annoying when you have to adjust this often.While WIFI is built in, and speedy, the 3D motion sensor for the glasses is a little bar, kinda like the Wii, that you plug in.  Other brands often have the glasses sensor built into the TV.  This detracts from the styling, but does give you an advantage of being able to place the bar in an optimum and height configuration.The glass front is very reflective when the TV is off, much like a mirror.  When on, I don't really notice any reflection unless there is a scene with a uniform image (like a cream color wall).  My TV sits close to a rather large window, which is one reason why I went with LCD.  It's a good thing I have shades if I really want to block the light/reflection.  The V5100 had a matte screen, but I don't really see much difference with light reflection between the two TV's for normal viewing enjoyment.I'm still evaluating the 3D part, so maybe I'll update that part later.

The red standby light no longer shows up on the bottom left corner of the frame when the TV is off, but plugged in. I have a fairly expensive 1500VA APC uninterruptable power supply unit (battery backup) that protects my entire entertainment center from over and under voltage as well as cleans up the sine wave when needed; utility power can be ugly. I'm almost 100 percent certain that this issue stems from a manufacturer defect and not due providing the TV with a low quality power source, as Sony claims. Repair techs want $500 to fix it. Not happening. Maybe I'll hang onto this broken TV and wait for the next round of class action lawsuits.Do some research and you'll find a growing number of complaints from individuals whose Sony LED TVs no longer work after approximately 1.5 years or 1,000 hours of usage.I will be going with Samsung D series for my next TV.

I ordered this TV from TD. it came 4 days earlier than the expected delivery date, and service was great.  I bought this TV without actually seeing it.  No B&M; near me carries this in the store not even my local best buy. The TV is absolutely beautiful.  My girlfriend used the word Sexy, and she could usually care less about electronics. The picture is very nice.  I noticed no flashlighting or clouding.  The major reason I chose this TV over LG 55lx9500 or samsung 55c7000 was the Bravia engine, and the antireflective screen.  I usually don't care for sony TV's.  i think they usually look a little cheaper.  they seem to use plastic where there competitors use metal.  i.e the entire rear panel.  But one thing sony does well is there video processing. The motion is fantastic.  it can be adjusted to you liking and get a nice smooth picture without the soap opera effect.  I really like the LG. and its color accuracy is actually one of the best in the industry. Probably thanks to its work with THX.  But The screen is too reflective.  It also seems to cast a smoky tint over the picture.  The big reason i chose the sony is you get that nice glassy look on the screen like a plasma, but because sony puts that layer of resin in between the panels, you don't get they terrible reflections.  don't get me wrong, there is still a reflection, but it exceeded my expectations of reducing glare.  I have the tv directly facing a huge window and still very watchable.  Now for the But......I read the reviews before buying and noticed a few people (2) that i saw, had issues with a dark spot mid upper right and left quadrant of the TV.  Well I have one too.  just upper right.  at first I thought it was a smudge, its about the size of a fingerprint.  But if you lightly press on the rear of the tv you can see the dot sort of shift shapes.  like when you poke the front of an LCD screen. It is only visible during light sceens. but it is extremely annoying when the camera pans. unacceptable!! As others have stated this is due to an object inside the tv poking the screen from the inside.  I spoke with TD and they will excange it free of charge.  so hopefully I am luckier the next time.  however, if the next tv is good.  I am afraid if I ever move it again that I could damage it.
