It has nice contrast, color and brightness combinations. Movie and dynamic modes will meet most peoples viewing criteria. Sound is also good enough and can be used in bed room without any home theater system or external speakers. Remote control has back lit feature to be use in dark room. Thickness as you see in pics is not bothering as it can hardly be seen from front and gives you the impression of slim TV. While connecting it to laptop you will require to adjust the screen resolution of your laptop to accommodate the complete picture on TV screen. It does not have VGA port which is merely require as most of the laptops sold in last 3-4 years does have HDMI port which can be used for laptop connection (I used amazon brand hdmi cable 5-6 dollar cost which is best in its class). Personally if you are looking something for your living room then you should go with at least 40 inch tv but for bed room this 32 inch size is perfect pick. Black contrast is good enough when you set the level at low. Gamma settings can be changed and cool/warm settings are also present to increase/decrease the amount of blue/red shade. After using it for few days i realized that 1080P TV is not at all required for that extra money as you will hardly be able to recognize any difference between full definition Vs 720p definition. Completely satisfied with my purchase and didn't have any complaint about it. I got what i was expecting in 350 bucks backed by amazon's trust of new unopened product. it would be nice if amazon can sell any low budget TV stand also so that people can buy them together (in range of 20-30 bucks) as you wont prefer spending 100 bucks just on stand for the TV worth cost of 350$. Highly recommended, go for it, you wont regret on your purchase. Also its very light weight to pick easily from one room to another whenever you want to shift it to other place (of course this is not daily moving item)Pros:satisfied with picture qualityNice set of features in low budget tvlook wise it is same as other costly slim TVsBack lit remote is usefullightweightUSB port to play images, mp3 and movies (most of the formats are supported as per samsung website manual)easy firmware upgrade via USB flash driveCons:Missing VGA portLittle thick in the back but hardly mattersUniversal remote feature is missing to control all other appliances related to TVShould have been sold with TV stand as bundle packageWill definitely recommend to friends and family-Shikha", "Date": "April 20, 2012"}, {"Title": "Good picture, a little thick", "Author": "DDD", "ReviewID": "R2VIGV8B41D8B7", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I bought the Samsung UN26EH4000 and the Sharp LC26SV490 at the same to compare the pictures.

Absolutely a breeze to set up. A few screws to put the stand together, connect the cable, plug it in and you're ready to go.I had read that the sound quality was very poor but that didn't turn out to be true.

The picture, now that I have it set right, is excellent (especially for HD signals, but also decent for standard TV) and the sound is surprisingly good as well.  As other reviewers have said, it has a lot of configuration options for a \"low end\" LED TV as well.Hook upI have it connected to the (Comcast) Cable with a splitter. One side of the splitter goes into the TV Antenna input and I used this side to be able to watch \"local\" channels in the clear as HD.  Here I am able to get network, PBS and a few other channels (maybe 30 or so).  The rest are scrambled, so not usable on this leg.  The other leg off the splitter is fed into a DTV box and then into a Panasonic DVR that I am really just using as a switch.  I run component cables out of this side into the component connections on the TV and on this side I can see all the \"standard\" channels, but not HD, standard (4x3) signal.  I tried it first with Composite connections (Component has 3 cables for video, Composite only has 1) and the picture is better with the Component cable connection.Given that setup, I use the Source button on the remote to flip it back and forth (I watch network on HD, everything else on the Std side).The TV tuner, obviously, is able to receive and decode the local channels from Comcast \"in the clear\", including HD.This configuration irritates my wife (two remotes!), but I really like being able to watch sports, etc, in HD without having the more expensive DVR from Comcast to decode HBO, etc (we have that downstairs on our main TV).If the TV had two Antenna inputs I could have skipped the DVR I am using as a switch, that would have been easier.Video SettingsIt took me a while to get the settings the way I like them (Marvin's post helped a lot), but here is how I have the video set which, for me, looks great:Mode:  StandardBacklight: 20Contrast: 95Brightness: 45Sharpness: 40Color:  53Tint:  50/50Advanced Settings:Color Space: NativeWhite Balance:Gamma:  0Dynamic Contrast: MediumBlack Tone: DarkerFlesh Tone: 0Motion Lighting: OffPicture Options:Color Tone: Warm1Size:  Screen Fit/Zoom1 (HD/Std)Digital Noise Filter: AutoHDMI Black Level: n/aFilm Mode: AutoLED Motion Plus: OffAudio Settings:Mode: Standard (must be Std to have access to Equalizer)Equalizer:  Balance:  0  100hz: +2  300hz:  +5  1Khz:  0  3Khz:  +1  10Khz:  +2SRS TruSurround HD: OnAuto Volume:  OnI had some trouble deciding what \"size\" setting I liked best for the std (4x3) signal.  The 4x3 setting is the most clear, but the picture does not fill the screen (you have black borders at least on the side, and maybe on top depending on what perspective is being used for the broadcast).  16x9 fills the screen nicely, but the people gain a few lbs as they get wider.  Zoom1 does the best job of filling the screen without changing the perspective, but the top and bottom get chopped off a bit.  I am using Zoom 1 (and I move it a bit if I am missing something due to it being chopped at the bottom, e.g. a news crawler).  For HD, Screen Fit is definitely best.One final note, I tried the LED motion out with sports, but the picture looks a lot \"duller\" to me with that on and I don't see any problem with sports, etc, with it off.A second final note (is that allowed?), I was worried about 720P vs 1080P, but I think the picture (especially HD) is great, I don't see how it really could be improved much with 1080P (would probably make more of a difference on a larger TV).", "Date": "October 10, 2012"}, {"Title": "Love is TV", "Author": "GranJan \"Bargain Hunter\"", "ReviewID": "R12IH8LYRVAKLW", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This is a great TV at a great price.

For that, I shelled out big bucks a couple years ago sold over by the internal Blu-Ray player and Wi-Fi connectivity only to have it finally die on me last week. All those fancy-smancy Sony adds and paying pretty much top dollar for a 32\", and I figured I'd at least get 5 years out of it. Nope. Blu Ray dies ~5 months ago. OK, I can live with that. Just buy an external one. This week, the channel and sound are not able to be changed unless I rebooted (i.e., unplugged and plugged) the TV. So I decide to give Samsung a try knowing how much I've always thought their computer monitors always struck me as better than others. After all, I'm just looking for a good image. I can live without all the other bells & whistles. Boy, if this thing can stand the test of time I won't go back. The picture quality is fantastic. It's got a Dynamic, Movie, and Standard Mode. The modes actually seem to work for what they imply (unlike my Sony piece of junk). The sound is very good too. It's got Standard, Movie, Clear Voice, and Music. Those too actually work like the names imply (unlike my Sony piece of junk). The features are enough to live with. You can stick a USB in it and watch pics and movies. There's no built in wi-fi, but who needs it with most Blu-Ray players? With Blu-Ray players providing the connectivity and online features (e.g., Netflix, Amazon Video, etc.), I figured why bother spending the extra for the same stuff. The 720p clarity is perfect on a TV this size. I see no difference between it and 1080p, but that's just me. The price was right for an LED.

The black level is just as good as an older plasma TV.  It is probably the best display quality that you can get in an inexpensive 26 inch TV.I deducted one star because:* The joystick is awkward and flimsy. This TV does not have power or volume buttons, which is a design mistake.* The TV is very deep and has internal space for better speakers, but the sound quality is just as bad as any other small TV.* The side recess for the two HDMI ports is not deep enough, so the cables stick out unless you tie them back.This TV has some nice features that are worth noting:* The built-in speakers are super loud. You could put this TV in a noisy place like a bar or cafeteria and still hear it.* The AVI and MKV video support is actually compatible with standard \"scene\" releases. (eg: Handbrake.fr files.)* The built-in video player has a setting to automatically repeat a USB playlist, so you could use this TV as a cheap \"barker\" in a waiting room or retail space.* It is super light weight. I can easily lift it with one hand. Any VESA mount would be strong enough to hold this TV.* The ATSC decoder can play audio-only OTA channels.I got this TV from Amazon with the 1011 firmware.

It seem that it was brighter and softer than the other brands. I have a larger Samsung in the living room and it's great! I feel like Samsung is where Sony use to be.  I also have some other Samsung products. The only knock I can give this tv is that Samsung's manual is really BAD.  It is on one large piece of paper folded into sections. I went to the website and downloaded the manual. Much easier to read. One knock was about the stand. Yes, it's plastic. You MUST install six (6) screws in order for it to be secure. The assembly instructions are a bit weak. Make sure you put the two screws on the bottom of the base. This tv is great when the boss wants to watch Lifetime and you want to watch ESPN!!!

Colascione", "ReviewID": "R1KXOKAWSA2RO5", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Just received this 32\" Samsung TV the other day and after setting it up we are very happy with it. This replaced a wall mounted 19\"CRT that was purchased back in 2003 so this is our first flat screen model. This has proven to be a perfect size for our 12 by 26 foot master bedroom  and it is wall mounted as well. I read in some previous reviews that the TV stand was unstable but I have not found that to be a problem, There are 8 screws that have to be attached in all and once they are the TV is stable, Also some have said that the sound was a little on the poor side, Again not so,  Plenty of volume and we have a large bedroom. I would say that the instructions were not bad but they were printed on a fold out piece of paper with small print and a booklet would have been better but no big deal. In setting this TV up there are a number of different options for you to choose from to tailor it to your liking.  The remote has many buttons but once you see where the main ones are it's fine. The picture is bright and clear and I like the small frame around the screen. On the bottom right side under the screen there is a button that you can control the TV functions if you misplace the remote control, (it's sort of like a joy stick button) where you hold it different ways to commend different functions like channel up & down main menu or on and off of TV. The TV's that you see on the showroom floor are set to (Showroom View) That means that they set at a brighter setting because of all the lighting in the store but when first setting up this TV in your home it will ask you if you want to set it at showroom settings or home setting and I would suggest you set it to the home setting because it will use less energy and the TV will last longer. All in all, were very happy with our purchase of this TV and we got a good price from Amazon with no sales tax and free delivery, What more could we ask for.  PS, I did a lot of reviewing of TV's on line and this proved to be the best in my opinion.", "Date": "August 25, 2012"}, {"Title": "Great bedroom tv!

This is my 3rd led tv from Amazon some much larger and has always been a good experience. (With the larger ones they even them brought them in and set them up.)Took some fiddling around with the adjustments, but pic is very good on most channels and excellent on many- that with no HD box, just cable upstairs.  To my joy it picks up 11 \"air\" channels !!!  So if the cable goes out I'm good. \"TIP\"  during set-up put the scan for channels on \"auto\" and it will include the free over the air ones & it keeps them separate from the cable channels. Sound: In standard mode you can choose surround sound and there is an equalizer to tweek- that vastly improves the sound. The quick \"Tools\" button on the remote is to great to access menu items you use frequently.And even tho my upstairs cable did not pull in HD with the 32\" lcd (Panasonic)- this tv pulls in many HD channels with Dolby.  Very light- 9-10 lbs.  I like the HDMI ports on the right side - easy access if using for games. Would have liked a 3rd hdmi port.  Good TV.-------------After having this TV a while I like it even better- great TV.  And even tho I have a 40\" in the LR- love watching this 26\" in the BR- Great picture.

No need for a sound bar like many of the thin models I examined prior to my decision to get this one.  All in all, this is just what I needed to fit my 30\" wide cabinet in the motor home.

Second, out of the whole manual, tons of googl'ing, there was no real info on audio out non optical. There was a picture in the manual that showed there was a way to audio out to RCA plugs to a \"older\" home stereo. So I tried a few things and here is the answer!! YES there is audio out, one optical, and the other jack look like a weird cable jack from another planet with a hole. Well that hole is all you need. That is a standard ipod size stereo jack (it does not look like it). I bought a cable that had one side a stereo 3.5mm jack (standard ipod ear bud connector), and the other side your standard RCA male plug. Boom it works! The only downside is when you change the volume on the TV it does not lower/raise your external audio. I guess the theory is, you turn off your internal speakers (there is an option for that), and use your stereo. I use both for movies. I hope this solves a few mysteries out there as there was NO data for this.

It's not too large sitting next to my Dell monitor and it's the perfect addition to relax after a long day with some TV.

The picture quality is better than just about all other sets in this price range. Colors are accurate and bright, and the most impressive thing to me would have be the deep black levels. I am an avid sports fan, and I haven't had any motion issues at all. So if you are a sports fan and were concerned about 60hz, it isn't a problem. The sound quality is OK to above average which is fine. I wasn't expecting state of the art sound from a small TV. Voices are clear, and the volume is more than plentiful and can get quite loud if you wish. That's all that matters to most of us. Another selling point for me was the ample amount of inputs for the price. Two HDMI most of all. Component/Composite Video, Digital Audio Out, USB and the 3.5mm Headphone/External speaker Audio Output. I couldn't ask for more than that when we're talking about a set that isn't meant to be your main TV. I would like to mention, if you're connecting headphones to the Audio Out, they're not controlled by the TV volume. It's decent sound nothing great. I also ordered Mediabridge Ultra Series HDMI Cable to hook up my HD cable box. I Highly recommend Mediabridge cables if you're looking for a great price and build quality. Lastly, I would like to comment on the design. This doesn't look like it is under 300 dollars. It is very modern looking and the bezel is thin so it's all screen. The stand is very basic and nothing special, but again, for what it is, it gets the job done and looks good. The backlit remote is a nice touch and is helpful when you're watching some TV before you sleep. It is rather dim unless you're in total darkness, tho. I've seen a few complaining about thickness. Not an issue for me, but I don't have it wall mounted. So I can't comment on that. In closing, you get what you pay for. I couldn't be happier choosing Samsung and LED.A few folks have been sharing calibration settings, so I figured it wouldn't hurt to post some myself. After all, if we don't like them, all we have to do is hit the rest button. I do recommend these tho to get the most out of your new TV. Nothing looks oversaturated or artificial, and you don't have to be bothered by halos from oversharpening. Night and day difference.

Well, after seeing this Samsung, I'm wondering if Samsung isn't going downhill? That, or they just don't put the same quality into their smaller TVs as they do in the larger ones (Unfortunately, my mother didn't want a large TV)- This seems more like something you'd get in Wallyworld for a hundred and thirty-five clams. The pedestal is cheap and rather flimsy; The picture is no better than what you'd find on a much cheaper 26\" [No, I'm not comparing it to my 43\" plasma TV- which is spectacular.]; The sound is rather poor; and the viewing options/adjustments are rather limited. My mother is quite happy with it; and hopefully it will last much longer than a TV from Wallyworld.....but had I seen this TV before purchasing it, I would not have bought it- I would have just taken my chances with a cheaper one, because this set doesn't seem to offer anything that they don't- except, perhaps longevity....hopefully.On the positive side: I do like the fact that there is an actual tactile on/off switch on the set itself (My 43 incher doesn't even have that); and the remote works nice, and is shaped better than older incarnations of the same, which were shaped in such a way that they'd slide off of a perfectly horizontal surface!And as other reviewers have noticed, this appears to be an LCD TV, not an LED, as it is advertised to be.

I'm trying to find a setting giving me better texture and color accuracy.  Note that if you are after a bright look and can't raise \"brightness\" more without ruining the look you are after, consider raising Contrast up and choosing Dynamic for picture mode.- VIEWING ANGLE:  While there are color issues as you move further off-center the picture doesn't fall apart and become unviewable, you can still see the picture, which isn't always the case with smaller TVs.- NO HEADPHONE JACK: No headphone jack (where you plug headphone in and the sound only comes out through headphones).  The line out doesn't take headphone line jack.  Can't imagine why a smaller TV like this wouldn't come with a headphone jack.- SOUND:  Compared to many others I've tested at stores the built-in audio is okay, however if quality sound is important expect to get an external speaker set of some kind (sound bar, ZVOX 220, Bose Solo, etc).- IN:  Has 2 HDMI, 1 Component (Y/G/B/R/W), 1 RF Cable/Antennae- CONTROLS:  Once you learn to operate the single joystick button under the TV you're fine, some folks might take some time getting used to the lack of explicit buttons.  For example holding the button in gets rid of the control overlay on the screen.

It wasn't planned that way, but after buying the 32 inch version of this one to replace our old 30 inch CRT that was still working the 27 inch CRT in our bedroom went black a few weeks later!  I could have moved the old 30 inch into the bedroom, but if you remember those old style TVs were HEAVY!!!  Not sure of the exact weight, but I'm guessing at least 100 pounds.  Anyways, it's sitting in our garage waiting for garage-sale season.On to the Samsung 26 inch.  It is lightweight(maybe 15 pounds?), affordable(I paid $227), and energy-efficient(about $5 a year - LED technology).  It's the perfect size for a bedroom TV and I've decided that once the tiny 15 inch CRT in the kitchen goes out we will move it into there and move the 32 inch into the bedroom.  This will give me an excuse to buy something a little bigger for the living room!  In case you're thinking about using this as a kitchen TV make sure you measure the height of your cabinets from the counter before purchasing.  I have about a half-inch extra room and it's big enough that I won't strain my eyes watching while sitting at the dining table.The only complaint I have is the complicated remote.  Way too many buttons for what I consider is a simple TV!  I do, however, like the illumination button which my 32 inch does not have despite being a 4000 series TV of the same model year.  This feature has come in very handy while watching TV in bed with the lights off.  Also, it is NOT a skinny TV!  I'm guessing 3 1/2 inches thick in the back, but this allows it to have decent sound(something those ultra-thin TVs have a hard time accomplishing) so it's not really a complaint for me.  Wall-mounters should know this, however.Not the cheapest TV in this size out there, but I think for what you get it is a good deal and I'm sure will last for many years.

It doesn't have some of the advanced features available in more expensive TVs (like the ability to connect to the internet) but I'm not looking for a TV to do many different things....I just want a TV to watch TV shows and movies on and this does just that with excellent picture quality. I don't know too much about the sound quality as I watch my stuff with headphones.The only main issues I have is that this TV doesn't come with a headphone jack....it only has an AUDIO OUT jack. The audio out jack is similar to a headphone jack in that you CAN attach a headphone to it...BUT, you cannot control the volume of your headphones using the TV volume. If you select External Speakers, the TV sound is turned off and you cannot even access volume control on the TV. So what you need is either external speakers of some sort, a receiver, an amplifier for your headphones of some sort, or headphones with a built in volume control on the headphone wire (which, thankfully, I have).  Also, the TV on the stand tends to tilt to the side. No problem for me since I can place something under the TV at the side to straighten it up. But the TV stand does not tilt up or down at all....it is stuck in one place keeping the TV at an angle which isn't a big problem at all but it would have been nice to have the ability to put the TV at an angle I want depending on if I am laying down or sitting up.CALIBRATION SETTINGSThese are the settings I use for the video settings. I did these settings on a LG Blu-Ray player using the Spears and Munsil HD Benchmark Calibration Blu-Ray Disc in a dark room. Keep in mind I am no expert and did these to the best of my ability so they are not perfect.MODE: MovieBacklight: 14-20 (depending on the darkness of the room and what my eyes can handle at the time)Contrast: 76Brightness: 43Sharpness: 0-14 (see note at bottom)Color: 57Tint- 50-50Picture Options/AdvancedColor Tone: Warm 1Black Tone: Darkest (Optional- see notes at bottom)Note 1- Sharpness: I originally had this at 0. I just watched Titanic and noticed that the picture had a smoothness to it and the picture stood out as great but not excellent. I upped the sharpness to 11-14 and settled on 12 and now the picture on Titanic is excellent and right near Avatar. I have to see more movies at 12 sharpness to see what works best. A lot of video experts will say to keep sharpness at 0 or near 0 but not every TV is the same so in some cases it may not be the best. Of course, in the end it comes down to personal preference....it's not about what I think looks best it's about what YOU think looks best. I recommend trying 0 sharpness all the way up to 20 while your watching a movie to see what setting you like the best (although, don't go overboard as eventually you will see artifacts which ruins the picture).Note 2- Dark Tone: This setting is supposed to make blacks look more black. This is just a preference of mine but I like Darkest the best. Blacks do look more black on Darkest. I don't know what else it does to the picture or if there is any loss of detail with it on but I have to say I like Darkest on. I turned it off and on while watching a movie and didn't notice it doing anything bad to the picture other than making blacks look more black. Of course, as I said before, it is about what you think looks best so try it off and then on and see what you like.For the price, this TV is amazing and I recommend it.", "Date": "September 19, 2012"}, {"Title": "Samsung tv", "Author": "Stan", "ReviewID": "R2IS72YDO37MJB", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I am very pleased with this tv.

Ruddygore \"Ruddy\"", "ReviewID": "R29QKABXT649S3", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Bought this model after being very happy with the purchase of the Samsung un55d6000. The un55 is and edge lit, while this model is smaller and is a fully LED backlit TV, which means some of the \"spotlighting\" and \"clouding\" apparent on the un55 are absent from this model. The TV was easy to set up. As mentioned in other reviews, there are only a couple of HDMI ports, 1 USB port, and come with component jacks. The TV looks terrific, as I have come to expect from Samsung. Here are a few points I found that differed from reviews I've read:- First, my stand connected without issue, however mine had 8 screws - 4 to connect to TV and 4 to connect TV portion to the rest of the stand. I had no problems with the installation and the TV is level.- I didn't see a huge difference is picture quality when viewing from different angles. However this is in my bedroom, which is one of the darker rooms in the house.- USB will play movies, music, and pictures; however it appears that the device needs to be a thumb/flash drive. I tried connecting my external hard drive and the TV would not recognize it. However this shouldn't be counted against the TV, as the box clearly states that it will play movies from a flash drive. The external hard drive was only a hope on my part.So far I'm extremely pleased with my Samsung TV purchases this year. Just hope they hold up with time and continue to provide a quality viewing experience.", "Date": "September 6, 2012"}, {"Title": "Great tv for the value and price paid", "Author": "k_dub", "ReviewID": "RNNCY07BWPTHM", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I didn't buy this product from amazon, but I felt I should comment here because I used a lot of these reviews, as well as those on cnet.com to make my decision, so hopefully this will help others as well. This is my first flat screen tv purchase, and I am very pleased with it. I am using it as a replacement for a 20-inch GE tube tv that I've had since 1997. Nothing is wrong w/the 20-inch; I just wanted to splurge on myself and I'm glad I did.This tv is in my bedroom and like the cnet.com review for this tv said, I would also recommend nothing smaller than a 32-inch for a bedroom. Like other reviewers have stated, the picture is very clear, crisp, and colorful (and I don't subscribe to HD cable) and the design is very sleek although, as some reviewers have pointed out, it is a bit thick. Not a deal-breaker for me. What's interesting is that I'm able to receive some HD channels w/this tv w/o the use of a cable box. I have a cable box hooked up to a 27-inch tube tv in the living room, but I'm unable to receive any HD channels on the 27-inch tv.I also agree with some reviewers regarding the remote control. It does seem like the buttons are a bit too close together, some are in strange places, and its shape is a bit uncomfortable for your hand; a remote control design that would have some curves in it - and maybe just a bit wider - would be ideal. Using the remote to navigate the on-screen menus was a bit cumbersome. For example, the main arrow controls are at the bottom of the remote, so you're only holding on to a small portion of the remote when you set-up the tv. I felt that I had to keep looking at the remote to make sure I was hitting the correct buttons. Placing the arrow keys at the top of the remote would feel more comfortable. Overall placement/layout of the buttons, in my opinion, is not very ergonomic.I like that you can auto-program channels; however, you can only edit analog channels. When I went through the auto-program process, it downloaded digital channels that I subscribe to, but they do not match up w/the channel names on the channel list from my cable service provider. For example, channel 902 on the channel list comes out as 91-902 after the auto-program; channel 710 comes out as 100-710. So instead of entering 902 or 710, you have to enter the additional numbers. This is a minor annoyance which will take some getting used to.Some mentioned the joy stick controller on the tv. I've used it a few times already and have not had a problem it. I guess if you have difficulty w/fine motor skills, it could be problematic.Regarding the stand, based on my assembly, it's not the stand itself that's wobbly: It's the piece that connects the tv to the actual stand. No matter how hard I tightened the screws (and you have to be careful when you tighten screws in plastic), it's still loose. For those reviewers who mentioned the stand going on crooked to where the tv is angled/tilted: The manual clearly shows that you have to basically slide the stand into the tv. If you angle the stand at all, it will come out angled.So far, I'm extremely pleased with this tv as my first venture into the flat screen realm. Sure, it doesn't have a lot of the bells and whistles that some may want, but for use in my bedroom just to watch tv, it's perfect.  I would give it 5 stars but because of the remote and stand, I think 4 is accurate. I think it's an excellent value for the price paid, and I plan to get a lot of use out of it.", "Date": "September 5, 2012"}, {"Title": "Very nice - great picture and sound!", "Author": "Sam Courtney", "ReviewID": "RTHC3G5FEXKM7", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "We shopped for several months and found this TV to be the best option for features and price.

I needed to do little more than mount the base, which comes in 2 pieces and requires 8 screws, and plug in the cable and power cords.  I didn't even bother to read the instruction manual because it just wasn't necessary.  Everything is clearly marked and self-explanatory.  The fit and finish is a beautiful black gloss that would really enhance the look of any room you put it in.  Very modern and stylish.The picture is clear, sharp, and vibrant and the sound projection is quite good.  There are many different settings to scroll through in the very easy to use on-screen menu which means you have a lot of flexibility to get this set to function to your liking.  Of particular note, the BackLight feature is very useful and makes a dramatic difference.  My living room takes in a lot of natural sunlight and I have no trouble viewing the picture.The remote controller functions very well, is no larger than it needs to be, and does everything you need it to do.I really cannot find a single flaw in the Samsung UN26EH4000.

Hull \"sci-fi fan\"", "ReviewID": "R3BV2V9OSYYGLD", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Wanted to take advantage of the time of year with heavy discounts on tv's so decided to replace a 26 inch CRT set (about 15 years old but still looked great!) with the slimmer flat screen and the 16x9 screen ratio.  We do not have HD so can not comment on that nor do we use this with a computer or network, so again, no comment.  It's just a TV for us and we have it in the bedroom and it is all that Samsung always is....perfect picture, plenty of volume, easy controls, quick setup, and fantastic color.  Wish it had a tilting stand as it surprised us that it leans backwards when mounted.  Unless you have this on a low table, that is the wrong direction.  Double checked the instructions, it appears I did it properly.  As this sits up higher than the floor, ended up tipping it forward with a block of wood.  We have cable with a cable box and connecting was no fuss.  Finding the proper code for cable box to TV was quick and easy on the internet.  No problems and recommend this set for those with a smaller space.  A side note: I was curious if the picture height (when not in letter box comfig) would match the old 26 CRT screen at about 12 inches high and it does.  The CRT set has a new life in my wifes sewing room so nothing went to the land fill.  Another little hint, if you use the 120vac outlet on the back of a comcast cable box, the tv may not turn on when you press the all-on button.  The tv powers up to a standby mode but does not turn on.  On older boxes you could set the operation of the outlet and correct this but newer boxes you can not.  The only cure is to plug the tv in to a hot outlet so it is in standby all the time.  Using the cable remote when then turn box and tv on together.", "Date": "December 23, 2012"}, {"Title": "HDTV", "Author": "T.

It has a 20 total watt virtual surround sound speaker system, built into the TV. You can change it to standard, music, or movie modes. The music mode is amazing when listening to TV shows or concerts with music or singing. When you are watching a DVD, the explosive scenes in movie mode sucks you right into the action.

Simply by hooking this display up to a PC and running the ghosting tests in PixPerAn immediately shows the ghosting issues with dark colors - primarily blacks and grays. This is present on any content, regardless of the framerate - 24, 30, 60, or 100+ - the ghosting is present and makes most games essentially unplayable, since most the scene smears half way across the screen when you move the camera around in-game.Yes, I made sure game mode was on and all the other settings were calibrated for gaming purposes, none of which had any effect what so ever on the black ghosting. Honestly, I could not recommend this monitor to anyone for any reason, since you will be hard pressed to view much media completely devoid of blacks and grays, it is quite humorous how this television is so highly rated, I challenge anyone to run the PixPerAn tests, it is not a faulty panel, they are all like this.This is not just present in games either, it also affects general TV use and watching movies, trying to watch The Dark Knight is akin to viewing water colors on canvas.", "Date": "January 15, 2013"}, {"Title": "PIXEL PROBLEMS IN 90 DAYS OR LESS.........", "Author": "Ms. Margaret V.

The flashing is due to a mistake in the wiring system which Samsung is fully aware of!Unfortunately, because the problem didn't occur until AFTER my warranty had expired, I would have to pay about $200 for the repair. The repair person suggested calling Samsung Executive Customer Relations to see if they would cover the repair since it is a product that has a KNOWN failure and nothing that was my fault. Also, it was nothing I could have known about when I bought the television.  I called and after many empty apologies on their part, they refused to help us out with our repair expenses because we were a year out of warranty.  Nothing could change their minds.This was a terrible experience for us and one that I wouldn't want anyone else to have.  A company that sells products with faulty wiring or any other KNOWN problem - and then refuses to cover the repair expense - is not a company that I would do business with again.
