{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Great TV for Price!", "Author": "A. Payne", "ReviewID": "R3VZBROKORTR8Y", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "If you want the short version just skip to the 2nd paragraph.Alright this is my first review on something so here goes.  I spent months, yes months trying to find the best TV for my money. I read all the review on all the different tv's.  Heard all the rumors about \"shadowing\" on the LCD's and short life span on the plasmas.  I went to all the different stores to check them out.  The size of tv I was shopping for was around 50\".  I wanted the Pioneer plasma but too much $$$. So it was between Sony Bravia (120hz), Panasonic Plasma, or mitsubishi. When i was at the store i really couldn't tell a diffence between the Sony and the Mitsubishi (Diamond).  Both looked like great TV's, both about the same price, within $100 of each other.  Well i saw this mitsubish 144 Series that was much cheaper than the Mitsubish 244 (diamond) series.  I went to their website to see the difference.  There were a few things different such as; weight, speakers, tint adjuster. Nothing that seemed worth the $700-$800 difference.  So i decided to make the purchase.  There were no reviews on this specific tv yet so i took a gamble on it. I didnt think it was much of a gamble since its about the same as the diamond. The shipping took a little longer than i wanted,  2 weeks, although it was shipped from east coast (PA) to west coast, then to UT (normal shipping route).Got the TV set it up to my DTV (NOT HD).  The picture was pretty bad, but i figured it was because it was not HD.  Played a dvd, (480i, Not upconverter) pretty bad still. so i went and bought an upconverter, the picture was much better, but not as i would like.  So i called amazon and asked them how big of a hassel would it be to return tv, they said non at all.  But before returning it i was going to do one more test.  My friend has dtv HD and an xbox 360 1080P.  So the wife helped me load it up in the truck (GIT-R-DUN) for one final test.  I first tested it out on the XBOX and it was amazing, even standing close.  I was still a little skeptical so we tried the DTV HD, my friend said some channels are better than others with the HD picture so he turned it to the discovery channel and it was awesome.  So conclusion, Its a great TV. You do have to tweek the brightness and contrast a little but its an awesome picture!  BUT.... yes the speakers on the tv are terrible, it sounds like its being projected through a tin can. I'm sure some LCD tv are better than others when it comes to speakers but i think for the most part its due to the fact that they try to hide the speakers on the tv. Its not a big deal though, i planned on using my home speakers anyways. I would have given it a 4.5 stars due to the speakers but for the money this is a 5 star value.", "Date": "March 12, 2008"}, {"Title": "Mitsubisui 52\" LCD", "Author": "John Hanlon", "ReviewID": "R5Z8I4LYZ9IH9", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "Before buying the Mitsubishi I went to a couple of local stores to see what kind of picture it had. I was impressed by what I saw. However, what I saw was the television with a 1080i broadcast. When I got it home and put it on to the cable box the 1080i shows were very good, but anything less then that has a severe pixel breakup on the edges of any moving object. This is more visable the closer to the screen you are. Get back 10' and it is not as bad. Out of the box it is set up with the color set to a very bright level. You will have to do a bit of tweeking to get the picture to be as good as it can be. Once it is set up, and you get back a few feet, it is a good looking TV.", "Date": "March 4, 2008"}, {"Title": "This TV is great and ahead of its time.", "Author": "T. Cruz", "ReviewID": "R13E4HZMU6MSUK", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Great TV. The Non-Glossy screen while not as pretty as the Samsung's functions excellent in a room with a lot of windows. The picture is great particularly when watching CARS in 1080i; although the Miss USA pageant was never so enjoyable as it is in HD. When it gets a good signal (non-broadcast 1080) I never see any pixelation or blurring in really fast motion otherwise the picture is always perfect (Broadcast and On Demand (the latter usually having the best quality)).What is particularly important is until Comcast gets more channels in HD, this TV makes SD (480) look great too. An added bonus is while a tad deeper than most flat screens at nearly 6 inches, you can get a lot of screen when more limited by width and height; and if you are going 1080, you are probably going to want the screen closer to you any way so an inch more depth is no problem (Most 52\" TVs are nearly 54\" wide while this one is only 48\")Only complaints are: 1) the HDMI ports on the back are hard to access if you are using thick monster cable. If you get a less thick cable, no problem. 2) The screen doesn't tilt forward and back on its base (but does swivel to face more left or right); if you are wall mounting I suppose that doesn't matter.Great TV and amazing for the current price.", "Date": "April 16, 2008"}, {"Title": "Going to get this in two weeks", "Author": "BruceK", "ReviewID": "R28G7XDOQFTU0L", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "There are 3 levels of Mitsubishi 50+\" LCD monitors.  This one pertains to the Diamond version.I have been looking at LCDs for over a year trying to decide what to get.  The main objections I have are the pixelation ... boxing ... whatever you want to call it, and the heat.Mostly I have looked at the Samsung, Sony, Panasonic, Mitsubishi.I like the Sony and Mitsubishi the best, but most of my Mitsubishi purchaces have always been the best - I like the company and they do a better job with things than Sony I think.,Looking at these monitors together they are both very very good.  They are both fast, and bright.  The Mitsubishi to me seems to have both darker blacks, and the best and brightest reds, oranges and yellows.  There is something dingy and brownish about the other TVs that I just see the Mitusbishi as the best picture.I was told that this is due to the extra color, and color adjustments that Mitsubishi has, and some pixel interpolation electronics.  This also has a faster processor and works at 120hz.  Since it is basically the same price as the Sony I am going to go with the Mitsubishi, because also it has a thinner frame around it as well.If you have experience with this model, good or bad, please make a comment and let me know.  Most of the reviews here are not so hot, but when I see this in the showroom, it is by far the best, and most of my other Mitsubishi products has exceeded expectations.", "Date": "March 30, 2008"}, {"Title": "Customer Service - I don't think so!", "Author": "Hulhubber", "ReviewID": "R3DTIAQ99D6O4R", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "Bought the Mitsu after seeing it in one of the larger video stores and took it home that day. Nice picture and seemed to be a good value.  After 10 days, a very annoying electrical hum started and the brighter the picture got, the louder the hum.  And this was not adjusting the picture, just a normal image, so if you are watching news and the screen is bright (as it normally would be) the hum is there.Well.. the repair service has had the set for 2 weeks.  No indication of when it will be back (as if I even want it now) and just try to talk to a human at Mitsubishi.  I dare you!.  When I finally got to a person I was told the hum was \"normal\" and when I asked to speak to a supervisor, I was at first refused and later told that I would have to make an appointment and they would call me back.  I am still waiting for the call..Follow up.. After another week, the set was returned, with the problem and the case was now damaged. The autorized repair service would not take the set back and just drove away.  Mitsubishi called and said it's not their problem.  What a nightmare!  4 weeks and counting.Decide for yourself if this is the sort of customer experience you want to have for your money.", "Date": "March 26, 2008"}, {"Title": "Disappointed", "Author": "Alexander Razdolski \"Alex R.\"", "ReviewID": "RBX5Y4PYRFTDL", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I bought Mitsubishi LT 52144 in July 2008. What a disappointment!The set looks good, simple clean design with a very thin frame, no annoying glossy panels, displays a decent HD picture, and has all the \"right\" technical specs, but every time I watch it, I feel that I made a costly mistake. Avoid this model.Pros:1. Looks good.2. High Definition picture is decent.Cons:1. Very slow switching between inputs.2. Poor image quality in low definition channels.3. Poor sound quality.4. Poorly designed remote. For a $3,000 set it has to be better than remote that comes with a bargain basement 20 inch unit.5. \"Format\" function has only two modes (\"normal\" and \"wide\") as opposed to  four (\"normal\", \"wide\", \"wide zoom\", \"zoom\") in other 16:9 TV sets.6. No picture-in-picture mode. You can watch exactly one input at a time. Considering really slow switching between inputs it is very inconvenient.7.

Page", "ReviewID": "RLHWEGH8M9Z2E", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "I purchased the Mitsubishi 52\" LCD [Model LT 52144] In December of 2007.  Within 1-2 months, vertical lines appeared on the screen.  I delt with Mitsubishi and the retailer for about a month, then the retailer just replaced it because the manufacturer was taking too long to handle the issue.  By summer of 2008, the new tv experienced vertical lines.  Mitsubishi replaced the panel under warranty [the repair cost more than the original purchase price].  Then in October, 2009, the repaired panel started getting vertical lines.  I have been in contact with Mitsubishi, they have actually extended their 1 yr manufacturer's warranty to 2 years, and have offered to replace this defective TV with a new TV [model LT 52151]. I have yet to find reviews for the new model, and am concerned about the quality of that particular TV.Long story short: overall, we would have been pleased with this tv had we not experienced the vertical line issues. Obviously, there is a problem with this particular model LT 52144, since we have experienced it with two new tvs and a replacement panel within 22 months.", "Date": "November 6, 2009"}, {"Title": "Exceptional LCD & Price", "Author": "Duke of Earl \"boldknight\"", "ReviewID": "R2B86XFDGX4QYX", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I just took delivery yesterday from Amazon.  The pricing is the lowest on the net and comes with free \"White Glove\" service (The delivery is inside your house and set up). The set-up is very simple and we were up and running in 15 mins.The picture is exceptional and the HD is terrific!  I would rate this set as a 5 star, but as one other reviewer said, the sound system is horrible. The sound is \"Tiney\" if that is a word? Tried all the sound settings and nothing helps. Perhaps it is the small speakers with this set?  I would recommend to anyone considering this set to also purchase a good sound system to go with it.  I am!Other than the sound being so terrible, the set is the best I have seen.  I have checked the net and sen all the sets at COSTCO, SAMS and Best Buy, and this picture is the best and so very awesome.  Perhaps the 120hz helps, but I would not hesitate to recommend this set, but to also recommend an external sound system.  As two of us here have mentioned it, you should be aware of the failings of these poor quality speakers that come with this set.

So we thought we were buying a top-of-the-line brand and quality HDTV. The picture is beautiful/awesome. Unfortunately, the quality is not. We purchased this HDTV new on December 15, 2007. It now has vertical streaks on the right side of the LCD that we will need to get repiared.  The TV is less than 2 years old as of August 2009. Thank goodness we bought an extended warranty on the unit or we would have been out [...]. By the way, we also have a second Mitusbishi 46\" HDTV (LT-46144) in our house that we bought in April 2008 and it also had the same problem of vertical streaks down the ride side of the LCD (twice we had to have it repaired for that problem). So based on my two purchases, it appears that Mitsuibishi's LCDs for their HDTVs seems to have a quality issue. If it were not for the LCD quality problems, I would have rated this HDTV a 4-star (not 5-star) because the TV itself is great (4 star) but because it was much more expensive than other HDTVs in the same size, I don't think it was the best value (and hence, I would not rate it a 5-star). But because of the quality problems, I'm rating it a 1-star. I would strongly recommend that you purchase an extended in-home warranty if you purchase this model. But frankly, I would recommend that you avoid purchasing Mitsubishi because of their LCD quality issues.", "Date": "August 19, 2009"}, {"Title": "Quality Product", "Author": "K.

I own a LT-46133 as well and have had that set for about 3 years now. Both sets work great. Picture is outstanding. For those of you complaining about sound quality, shame on you, why are you going to judge a TV on sound quality alone and give it only one star? If you are going to truely take advantage of HIGH DEFINITION, it is both sound and picture. So please think about that before you go posting bad reviews. If you cant afford a sound system, dont buy HD equipment yet.Back to the TV. Picture is great, blacks are the best on LCD i have seen. With both TVs i have purchased i shopped around for months before deciding on the set. I have been in several stores and have seen many TVs.
