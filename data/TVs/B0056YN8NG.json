This is the second Vizio that I have bought. Was very pleased with the picture and sound of this tv. I originally was going to buy a soundbar to go with this but found out that it didnt need it at all. I looked at many different tvs before finally making my choice with this one. I am using it on a wall mount. This is the wall mount that I purchased on Amazon and works great. VideoSecu LCD LED TV Wall Mount Full Motion with Swivel Articulating Arm for 23-37, up to 42 in TV Flat Panel Screen With VESA 200 100, 20 in extension and Post-installation Leveling System A35The setup with this tv is like with all Vizios is simple. This tv would make a great bedroom tv as well but I am using it in my kitchen for the kids to watch while eating breakfast and for the wife when she cooks dinner and watches her cooking shows. The only flaw like almost all other Vizios is the remote. It is just not fitted to the had and overall just looks and feels cheap otherwise buy this tv knowing that the price and function are great.", "Date": "July 3, 2012"}, {"Title": "VIZIO 32- inch E320VT RAZOR LCD HDTV  Black.", "Author": "Tomahawk", "ReviewID": "R3SO2UC53A7NZ2", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "The VIZIO 32 inch HDTV is wonderfull,great picture sound easy to set up.
