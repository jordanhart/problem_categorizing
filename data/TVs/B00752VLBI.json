Important Setup Info to ensure you don't ruin the screen, picture calibration (default is for energy savings, not good pic), $19 Active 3D glasses, $30 wall mounts, removing ads & youtube settings.Hey all, if you are reading this, means you already want this plasma, or started off like I did, confident that you were looking for a new edge-lit LED tv, but after days of research shocked to see yourself purchasing a plasma! The better picture, for 1/2 the cost, with plasma-ish issues (heat, burn-in, etc) now mostly a thing of the past, makes you wonder why people are snapping up LED's (I got this for $699 at a local box shop, would've done Amazon at same price but didn't want to wait).Note: *3D GLASSES* You do NOT need to spend $50 each on glasses. Last year the major brands agreed on a universal active 3d standard via bluetooth. You can buy the new $19 Samsung SSG-4100GB glasses here on Amazon(Samsung SSG-4100GB 3D Active Glasses 2012 Models - Black), and they work great on this TV (I have 2 pairs). If you don't believe this, google \"3D active glasses CNET\" and find their article confirming this. I'm sure other active glasses will soon be available as well. CNET has a good article on the difference between Active & Passive pros & cons as well if you're still on the fence; IMO, the 3D on this TV with the $20 Samsung's is awesome.Anyways, you know the pros/cons already of this TV (if not, I put my PROS/CONS as a comment/reply below); this article is to save you 10 hours of reading on how to set it up and enjoy it. The following suggestions should apply to any UT50 or Panny Viera plasma (except the calibrations are only for the 50\" I would assume).1. BREAK-IN PERIOD: Even though this is mostly a thing of the past with newer plamas, you'll see everyone with an opinion on this topic, yet its clear that plasmas are still *NOT* yet IDIOT PROOF (just use easy rules below & you'll be fine). You'll see the plasma gurus of years past insist that you need to run a video file of \"slides\" repeatedly for 100 hours minimum to evenly break-in the screen, or you'll end up with \"IR\" (image retention) & \"burn in\" images on your display. Even though newer plasma tech is now much more forgiving, for the first couple weeks (100 hours) you should *not* play the same video game (fixed icons/menu), or watch TV in a 4:3 format (that has black bars on the side) or wide-screen(black bars on top) or the same TV station (NBC with their logo on the bottom right). There's a pretty good chance you'll end up with something burned into the screen, and you won't be happy, and your dog or wife will hate you. You'll hate yourself. Google \"Cnet Do I Need to Break In New Plasma\" for a more informed article on this, but basically, stick to 16:9 video (fills the entire screen), if it doesn't, hit the \"FORMAT\" button on the remote to FILL the screen so you don't have black bars, and don't stick on channels with static logos (ESPN with the news ticker! NG with their logo, etc) for hours on end. ALSO, apparently a good idea to keep your CONTRAST settings below 100% for the first 100 hours or so (80 or below is the word, I'm a risk taker, think I'm at 85). Just watch full-screen content without stationary logos during the break-in period as much as possible, or don't stay stuck on any one channel/logo/ticker. Me, I just put a DVD/on-demand movie on repeatedly when I was doing other stuff around the house (find the longest movie you've got). If you are reading this after the fact & already hate yourself, go to Youtube and google \"fix plasma\" etc there are some videos that may be able to burn it out, or apparently Disney made some \"WOW CD\" that is a plasma staple, google it, lots of people useit, I can't comment on it not having used it.2. BREAK-IN PERIOD (2nd): There is a built in \"Anti-Image Retention\" scrolling bar (under Menu>>Setup>>Anti Image Retention). I run this after watching a movie or say at halftime & afterwards of watching an NFL game (just being paranoid probably, but its easy so why not). At least initially...if you go onto Youtube there is a 5 minute video clip called \"Plasma HDTV Burn-In Clip\" (starts with pink spirals). There's a link on that page you can download the video & put it on a USB stick and then tell your TV to run it in a loop overnight for a few nights (if you were motivated) as others suggest, I decided I'd just run the scrolling bars in between viewings, from what I've read the new plasma tech is forgiving enough as long as you don't push it too far.3. CALIBRATION: I would put this 1st, but figure its more important not to screw up the screen. The TV comes in an \"Eco\" friendly setting so they can get that $21/year energy cost sticker. This is a garbage picture. You'll end up spending $46/year or so according to CNET in reality once you adjust the TV for a good picture (and I'm assuming your getting the plasma for a good picture, not to save $25/year on electricity). You can google \"CNET TC-P50UT50 CALIBRATION\" and find their suggested calibration settings, or if you really want to get into it, google \"AVSFORUM TC-P50UT50 CALIBRATION\" and there's a 20 page thread titled \"The Official Panasonic UT50 Settings/Issues Thread\", and the 2 main contributors (PathofNeo & anikun07) suggest similar but slightly different settings than CNET. If you jump to Page 9 (post 250) of that thread, you'll find anikun07's settings for both CINEMA mode and also 3D MODE. If you want to know \"why\" these settings are best (including why you should use CINEMA mode, not CUSTOM mode for better blacks), read the first 9 pages. I'll cheat & post anikun07's current settings below for you, but if he changes them in the future I wouldn't know, you'd have to check the thread. I didn't bother getting into the custom RGB color settings, just the main easy-access settings.4. REMOVE ADVERTISEMENTS / DISABLE ADS (seen on startup & in the Internet menu): For the ads displayed on startup, go to MENU>>SETUP>>ADVANCED SETTINGS>>VIERA CONNECT BANNER (and set to OFF). For the ads displayed as one of the apps, just unselect that app from being displayed in the app/store settings (uncheck it). If you are confused how to move an app from the 1st screen to the 3rd, there's a FAQ on Panasonic's site for this TV that explains the steps in detail.5. YOUTUBE: The app allows you to link your phone or tablet to your TV (so you don't have to painfully type in search terms using that remote from the 90's). It gives you a PIN to enter into your device, then whatever you type into the device & hit play, ends up playing on your TV, pretty neat.6. VIDEO SETTINGS FOR 3D, NORMAL TV & INTERNET APPS (NETFLIX ETC) ARE ALL SEPARATE: These are all controlled separately, so once you find the right settings for your cinema mode, you have to play a 3D movie, then open up the picture menu again and make the settings per below, and same for Internet Apps, go into youtube or netflix & edit the picture settings there as well (I used same settings for both TV & internet apps). I guess each input has its own setting, so HDMI1 & HDMI2 you have to make the different picture settings (see comments below page 3)7. MOTION SMOOTHER (Soap Opera Effect): Everyone will tell you the first thing you need to do is disable the digital manipulation of the video, turn off the \"Motion Smoother\" (see full settings below). Basically, you'll turn off all digital manipulation, as they (according to the experts) just bog down the picture quality. This is confusing to me; why would *all* of the TV manufacturers spend money adding digital manipulations of the picture that no experts want? Perhaps the features fluff up some settings/images, while ruining others, I don't know enough to speculate, however even on LED's everyone says to turn off these digital \"enhancements\" as well.8. WALL MOUNTS: You do *not* need to spend $100-200 for a wall mount! Only $28! Check out \"Cheetah Mounts APTMM2B Flush Tilt Dual Hook (1.3\" from wall) Flat Screen TV Wall Mount Bracket for 32-65 inch Plasma, LED, and LCD TVs Up To VESA 700x400 and 165lbs, Including 10' Braided High Speed with Ethernet HDMI Cable and 3-Axis Magnetic Bubble Level\" here on Amazon, $27.99 (Prime) and its 1.5\" from the wall & includes tilt (my old mount had swivel but I never used it). Holds up to 165lbs, nearly 5 stars from 2,000+ reviews, nice (remember to drill into a stud!). Also, if you tilt the TV downwards a smidgen, then the overhead room light doesn't reflect on the screen when you are sitting down, if glare's an issue at night, cheap fix.1/21/13 Updates:9. Android App: There is a Viera droid app in the Play store (can't comment on Apple IOS), works on tablets & phones. However, as of 1/21/13 its pretty annoying that you can't use the app to \"type\" into the search bars on Netflix or Hulu (why else would I use the app over the remote?). Youtube's sync let's you type in the search bar, hopefully they fix this bug. I note that there are bluetooth mini-keyboards that you can buy for ~$40, I haven't looked into this yet though. For now I'll probably make due with the clunky non-qwerty remote.10. I really wish the remote could be programmed to control my cable box as well; I'm not sure I want to spend $100 for a Harmony remote, and I'm not sure if a Harmony remote would handle all the custom internet functions anyways (navigating the Viera Netflix & Hulu apps etc), looks like I might be stuck with a few remotes for now at least; the Android app & non-programmable remote are really my only (minor) complaints on this TV, which is still a 5-star bargain at the price I got it at though.1/23/13 Update:11. Wireless Dongle: if you don't have an ethernet cable nearby, instead of buying the Panny wireless adapter Panasonic TY-WL20U Wireless Adapter for Panasonic 2012 Internet Ready TVs, something to consider instead would be one of these \"Powerline\" adapters that are slightly less in cost, but something you could use for other purposes later on, and/or be able to add other adapters to your house for other internet devices (I did a very QUICK search, these ZyXEL adapters seemed the best bang for the buck (Logitech's HD Powerline 200a is $105), there could be a better brand/price you'd have to check but these are $43 on Prime currentlyZyXEL PLA401v3  HomePlug AV 200 Mbps Powerline Wall-plug Adapter (Starter Kit - 2 units):Here are Anikun07's 2D & 3D calibration settings from the AVSforum thread I mentioned above (apparently these settings target a neutral D65 coloring, you may find you like TV's with unnatural heavy red hues, to each their own?):***2D CINEMA MODE*** (not custom, not vivid, not standard)______________Contrast: +90Brightness: +49Color: +48Tint: 0Sharpness: 0Color Temp: Warm 2Color Mgmt.: OffC.A.T.S.: OffVideo NR: Off______________Aspect AdjustmentsScreen Format: FullHD Size: Size 2H Size: Size 1______________HDMI Settings (*edit, CNET says the following, which is what I did as well: -- HDMI settings: [no change from default].

The plasma picture quality is FAR better than LED or LCD in this price range; the only problem is the screen glare in bright rooms (you will see refections if you are viewing during the day if the curtains are not closed). In my opinion the picture quality is well worth the trouble of getting off the couch and closing the curtains.I read previous reviews of the screen being dim. For one thing, the worst thing you can do while shopping for TV is to look at multiple display TVs. The reason behind this being, most TVs that are on display are in something tech geeks call 'Torch Mode' (basically the brightest and prettiest TV gets the most attention). This is deceptive because when you view the TV in your home you will not have another TV in the room to compare the picture to. But if the picture on this TV is not bright enough for you, go to settings and simply change the picture mode to 'Vivid' or 'Custom'.One more thing you MUST do to get the best picture out of this TV is: go to advance settings and find 'Motion Smoother'. When you've found it, turn it OFF! This feature makes the picture look fast and as if it were filmed by a cheap camera. To get the full cinema experience it is imperative to turn this OFF.Overall, this TV is the flagship in its class for picture quality and is an extremely good deal.", "Date": "April 10, 2012"}, {"Title": "Very nice, for my first HD/Plasma, but....", "Author": "NscaleMike", "ReviewID": "R1PQB0Z1GA3WF9", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Purchased this in May of 2012, after reading numerous reviews, mostly here on Amazon from fellow consumers and a few from CNet.com . It's been a really nice TV...best one I've ever owned, wonderful colors and sharp images. Watching Blu-ray movies has been a real treat, using a Sony PS-3. The built in sound from the TV is perfect for the size of our living room. I will probably upgrade at some point to a better sound system such as a soundbar or similar. We use the preloaded Netflix all the time, great feature. I still don't know why Panasonic did not build in a wireless(WiFi) feature to this TV...most other brands like LG do....I had to purchase one separately from an online retailer in NY, they were extremely fast and cheap too. The \"White Glove service\" provided that delivered the TV was great...they'd call the day before the scheduled delivery date. They set it up and removed all the packing material.Now the \"but\"....After almost of 5 months of watching...roughly 6-8hrs a day, Sunday night during the fourth quarter of the Packers Saints game the TV stopped working....The red LED in the front of the TV started to blink...so I unplugged the TV...waited a few mins...plugged it back in...Nothing but more blinking....in this case it blinks 8 times, pauses, then blinks 8 times, pauses..etc etc...Looked this up online..and apparently this is a problem that has occurred before...other have noted such online. Panasonic was closed on Sunday...I did purchase an extended warranty through Canopy, but they said to contact Panasonic first. I did Monday the 1st of October...they seemed helpful and understanding...but It won't be until Friday the 5th before someone locally here in Vegas could fix it.S I G H...I will update as necessary...***Update....Ok the TV went out on Sunday night the 30th of September. Monday the 1st, 6 a.m., I contacted Panasonic customer service, I spoke with a Technician, who gave me a case# and arranged to have a local (Las Vegas)TV repair place come out and fix it on Friday the 5th. I called the repair place on Thursday to confirm they were coming out as scheduled, they said they weren't, because on the 1st, Monday, after I called Panasonic, they notified the local repair shop of the repair order, but the needed part was on a \"3 week\" back-order!! My blood pressure started to get a bit higher at this point. I called Panasonic right away, trying to find out why wasn't I notified of this delay. I got the usual \"We're sorry\"...\"I apologize\" etc etc...Inserted within the owners manual for the TV is a welcome letter, welcoming the new customer to the \"VIERA Concierge\" program. It's for owners of 46\" and larger flat panel tv's....\"As a Panasonic flat panel TV owner you are now entitled to a variety of free privileges that will make owning our new television even more of a pleasure. It's our way to give you the experience and peace of mind you expect from Panasonic.

In-home priority service scheduling and follow-up if your television needs to be serviced (Usually fixed in about two days). COMPLIMENTARY LOANER TVs AVAILABLE FOR IN-WARRANTY REPAIRS BY CONTACTING PANASONIC\"That last line I put in caps to emphasize my frustrations with these folks. So after several calls....so I could get a clear answer on when my tv will be repaired I started asking for a complimentary TV, since my TV was apparently going to be out of service for at least 3 weeks more....they told me to contact my local tv repair office for one, I said why? They said they will provide one...I called the repair shop, they started to laugh a bit...and said they only repair tv's and don't provide loaners. Called back Panasonic, they stated they didn't have any TV's to loan...I re-read them , word for word the VIERA Concierge program...I expressed to them my extreme dissatisfaction with their department. Once again...I heard how apologetic they were. I told them, I didn't want any more apologies... I just needed to speak to someone here in the USA, who can actually make a decision and either get my TV fixed or a loaner ASAP!....After being on hold for another 10 mins...they finally give me a number to an office in New Jersey. (201) 348-7755...I was able to speak with a \"Bill\" in their Executive Department. He seemed sincerely concerned about my case. Upgraded it to a Field Service Technician level, and said Panasonic really tries to fix their TV's within the time frame stated in the Concierge letter. They don't always have loaners available, but would have one sent to me by early next week, if the replacement part didn't come in first. I told him, the Customer service center should have got the ball rolling once they discovered the replacement part was on a 3 week back order, they should have called me, gave me an update, got the process in motion to get me a loaner. I contacted my the local repair shop, on Friday the 5th...the manager there said...\"I don't know what you said or who you spoke to...but they're overnighting the replacement part\". Monday was a holiday, So they came out Tuesday promptly, installed a new \"SS Board\" as well as replaced several screws with upgraded ones for their boards. The new screws appeared almost identical, but the washers are spring loaded, compared to the factory installed ones.The TV works just great now....It's a shame my blood pressure had to boil a bit...and I had to make so many calls to their CS department and finally a corporate office here in the US.

I had a 4 year old Samsung 50\" HT-P5064 and it's like night & day. This Panasonic is absolutely amazing for under $1000! I was really itching on going for the ST50 series but considering that I can control the lighting in my setup, I really didn't see spending the extra $300 was worth it to me. I've calibrated this set as best as I could and I'm breaking it in slowing but will eventually purchase the Spears & Munsil Blu-Ray calibration disc to get the colors & contrast as best as possible. The picture quality is second to none. Deep, inky black levels, jaw dropping colors & fantastic contrast ratios with pretty intuitive picture control settings, Panasonic really knows how to make plasma's. As much as I love the looks of those new LED TV's on the market, I just can't see myself purchasing one. The natural fluid motion picture feel of Panasonic plasma just can't be beat! Netflix streaming, Amazon Prime Instant Video & DLNA (big plus!) is great on this set. They have a nifty mobile device app you can get for iPhone/Android to control the TV but I haven't really got into playing with it.

I was super excited about the relatively low price and vast features. My only concern was with burn in. After asking the store associate about this, he quickly told me that burn in is not a problem in modern plasma TVs. Taking his advice, I ponied up the thousand bucks for this new living room centerpiece.I use a HTPC (Home Theater PC) for most of my entertainment at home. I use Pandora a lot for just listening to music. Well, after playing quite a bit of Pandora early after purchasing this TV, I one day noticed a ghost image of the Pandora page whenever I was looking at a lightly colored screen.After doing a LOT more research, I have learned that plasma TVs are more susceptible to burn in, or image retention, early in their lifespan. Lots of sites advocate a 100-hour break in period with plasma TVs. I knew nothing of this, and I simply went off the word of the TV salesman.It has been over a month now, and I can still see the ghost of Pandora any time a light image is displayed on this TV. Granted, this is probably my fault, but I was an unwitting consumer taking the word of someone I assumed knew better than I. I have read tons of forums about burn-in and image retention. I am unsure which I have, as burn-in is permanent, while IR is not. Some say that my ghost may go away with time, but so far, it has not. I am so bummed to have shelled out a lot of money and left with a problem that irks me every time I watch TV. Again, this was my fault. But I hope that my warning can spare someone else my regret. If you are going to have a lot of static images on this TV, you may want to reconsider.I also want to add that I have never managed to get any of the Smart TV apps to work via ethernet.

Even though Jan/Feb is the prime time for prices, I got it from Amazon at a very competitive price and everything went as expected - order, delivery and even price match when the price dropped $70 a couple days later.  This may not be the TV for everyone, but as someone who wants quality under $1000, is tech-savvy but not obsessed and looking for something that will last 5+ years - it was the perfect TV for me.What would have saved me some time before I purchased was 2 tips - read posts at avs forum and, most importantly, go somewhere to see LED/LCD/Plasma IN PERSON.  The salesperson gave me the remote and I was able to get a much better idea in 15 minutes than 2 hours of reviews.P50UT50 has 3D capability and a little more control over the image than the U50, which turned out to be useful and still more than a couple hundred less than the ST50.  At my house I was using the calibration resources online as a starting point and then minor adjustments for gaming, cable and movies.  A nice feature I didnt know is that the screen controls (Standard, Vivid, Cinema, Custom) of every input can be customized and saved individually (up to 4 inputs, each having 4 different settings).A lot of discussion goes into viewing Blu-ray and HD format but I use it just as much for regular cable (coaxial) and streaming.  I prefer wired connection so I got it hooked up to my router and updated the firmware.  I did not care about Smart TV but after a week I realise it was worth the upgrade from the U50 and I can make a lot of use of streaming services directly via the TV.  I am still hoping to find out there will be a web-browser app available later on.  It does suck watching standard definition video now, but that's the case for all HDTV I guess.Since I was using an old tube TV, I already had a spot in my living room that avoids light glare.  The only way I can put it differently than other reviews is that seeing it in person is the best way to make that decision not reading stuff online.  I have a lamp right next to the TV stand but the angle doesnt reflect from where we're sitting, you definitely dont have to watch in the dark to enjoy.The UT50 has really impressed me with the picture quality - give yourself a few days to get the settings right.

About on par with Cinema mode, but with Custom mode gamma looks better (more \"pop\" as some say). That being said, as long as Panasonic uses the same calibration settings in Cinema mode on the UT50 as the ST50, according to reviews Cinema mode gives ~2.13 gamma, which is quite good. To my eye Custom/Graphics seems to give a more attractive image without crushing black detail. However Custom without Graphics HDMI content type set gives horrendous color reproduction.

Panasonic refused to replace the tv since it cannot be repaired at this time.  Their customer service is very uncaring and unapologetic.  Panasonic plasmas are not what they used to be, they are filling these tv's with junk components that will eventually go out on you.

Christmas day 2012 my less then year old TV stopped working and had a power issue. Panasonic provided me with a 3rd party authorized repair center. The TV was repaired outside a normal time range because the appropriate parts for repair were unavailable at the time. After repair the television appeared to work.Today, while watching television the TV again stopped working. I chatted with a panasonic customer service representative for a few minutes who explained there was not anything they could do for me because i was out for warranty. She gave me the option of filing a complaint or speaking to a phone representative. I chose to speak to a phone representative.I explained to the phone rep., that while watching tv, i heard a loud \"pop\", noticed the tv would not turn on, and then noticed the screen was cracked from the inside (i could feel the surface of the screen to be smooth). To which the service rep named Akash explained he could do nothing but refer me to a a company that i would have to pay to evaluate the cause of the issue. He explained that after this he would be able to take the next step, which might include covering a portion of the repair. I asked to speak to his supervisor.His supervisor named Ramos explained the same. This being the second time i repair one of their flagship Plasma models in less then 2 years, i asked if their tv's life span is less then 2 years. He redirected my question and would no answer. Ramos initially explained that any person i spoke to would explain the same, and after much questioning finally redirected me to his Manager at my request.I subsequently spoke with Otis who would not provide me with a way to contact him going forward. He explained i could only reference him on case# 30023160. I asked what they could do for me, this had become a tremendous inconvenience during the holiday season. Otis explained that there would be nothing he could do for me outside helping me pick out a new TV. Otis explained that i could look at his TV's online and he would sell me one. I explained that my TV was factory defunct (twice at this point) and i wanted them to support their product. I asked Otis if he had someone else i could speak to (his boss). Otis explained that He/She was possibly unavailable and i could not speak to them. I asked Otis if Panasonic TV sets are as a standard only made to last under two years, to which he would not reply and avoided the question.I asked if i could have an email address or phone number, or request a call back. To which he said no. I asked Otis if there was a way i could identify him during a complaint, and he said he was not going to give me his full name or contact information. I asked Otis when was the best time to call back and contact his boss, to which he said 9-5. It was 2:30 in the afternoon eastern time and this did not hold logic. I asked Otis if i could quote the fact that he expressed there was nothing he could do for me but offer me to purchase a new TV set. He explained that i could not record to conversation. I explained that i wanted a verbal quote. He said that there was nothing he was willing to do for me but help me purchase a new TV.I think Panasonic's lack of customer service support of defunct products is atrocious and criminal.

Colors are well saturated, clarity is on point for plasma, and HD programming/blueray is awesome.  Spent a lot of time researching before getting this.  Glad I made the purchase.  Look on the AVS forums for reviews and experience of other buyers.  Also, you can find settings to fine tune image quality.  I purchased the Disney WOW disk to dial in colors to my liking.  Give the set about 2 weeks to \"settle\" in.  I find that the T.V. gets better with a little time on it after about a 100 hrs. of use on it.  Stay away from static images(channel logo's, espn, fox) to prevent IR for the first 50-100 hrs.  Fine tune your display settings again after this and you'll be set.  The reason I didn't go for the ST50 was because of that aggressive anti-glare filter that's on it (louver filter).  The UT50 has more pop, feels like it has more brightness than it does, is actually sharper, and overall very solid on all fronts and it's all due to the fact that it's using 2012 Panasonic tech and doesn't include that all-miraculous filter.  Advanced color menu, filter, and speakers, didn't justify the additional $400 for the ST50 for me.

It was shipped appropriately with no damage and the delivery person helped to install the TV.The initial setup of the TV was uneventful and easy to perform.  I have no problems or concerns regarding the quality of the picture as the image is clear, especially in HD and the picture quality remains excellent when viewed from every angle in the room.  My concern is that I noticed a mild \"buzz\" or \"hum\" when the volume is turned down completely.  The buzz becomes louder when there is a brighter image on the screen.  I've researched this issue and found that most plasma TV's apparently have this issue, especially when the contrast of the TV is turned up too high.  I attempted to reduce the contrast, and while the buzzing sound diminished, the picture quality was too dark to be enjoyed.  However, as long as the volume is turned up to normal levels, the buzz is not audible, but if there is a \"quiet moment\" while watching a movie it may become noticeable.My only other complaint with the TV was that while it states it is \"internet ready\" you have to purchase additional equipment (a wireless adapter) to get it connected to the internet.  The problem is that not ANY wireless adaptor will work, but you must buy one specifically designed for the TV and the part costs way too much (at least in my opinion).  I personally feel the adaptor should already be installed with the TV during the build or that the cost should be reduced...Panasonic is simply attempting to squeeze out a few extra dollars from you.  I tried 3 other cheaper adaptors and none of them worked with the TV, however when I purchased the correct one, it worked as expected when plugged into the TV and I was able to connect to Netflix online and begin viewing movies (not in HD, though).I have given the TV 4 stars because I reduced one star due to the slightly annoying buzz noted when the volume is low, especially when there is a bright image on the screen and the fact that the TV isn't truly internet ready, but you have to purchase a pricey wireless adaptor.

I gotta say, this is the best $755 I have spend in a LONG time. Was also able to get a 5 year square trade warranty through Costco for less than anywhere I have seen, including Amazon. I had been reading reviews for months trying to determine what TV I wanted, and I had settled on the Panasonic ST50 series, but the price point was just a little to high and it never dropped into my range. According to CNET, the UT50 series almost matched the picture quality of the ST50, but with dulled down features. I thought, what the heck, lets go for it. With the UT50, you're still getting 3D and Internet connectivity (although it comes standard with a RJ-45 jack in the back for a wired connection. if you want wireless, you'll need to purchase and adapter), and you're getting AMAZING picture quality.PictureCNET mentioned that it washes out a bit in a well-lit room, but I have not noticed it at all. Not to mention that you will never have household lighting as bright as you'll see in the stores. Plus, if you mount it on the wall with a slight angle, it will decrease the impact of any lighting you may have coming from above. As a note, the default picture setting is \"STANDARD\", this looks like junk. Set it to cinema and then move the contrast down to 75 or so, watch it at this setting for about a week and then use a video calibration disc like Disney's WOW to get the picture just right. You could also use CNET's calibration settings, they were almost identical to what my settings ended up being. Keep in mind that for each input has it's own picture setting. So, if you change the setting for HDMI 1, the settings for HDMI 2 will not change. This goes for Netflix as well.SoundSounds quality is good. Better than the LG's and Samsung's I have seen. But, as with all flat-panel TV's, they can only fit speakers that are relatively small in size, so you'll never get the best sounds quality anyway. I have to say though, that for their size, they put out good sounds and a fair amount of bass. If you're sitting 6 - 10 feet from the TV, you'll have no problem. Any further back and I would recommend a sound system of some sort. Monoprice.com has a fanastic set of surround sound speakers for $250 and a cheaper set for $85. Best you can get for the money, guaranteed.FeaturesInternet stuff - I have not had too much of a chance to use all the internet apps, mainly just Netflix. I gotta say thought that it's really nice that there is a Netflix button right on the remote. I ran some Cat-6 under my house to a 8-port switch a while ago. I prefer wired connections over wireless for gaming and netflix. This made hooking the TV up to the internet very easy and cheap.

One of the bigger changes year on year I've seen from Panasonic.  However, the UT50 (60\") was plagued with the same issue, though not as bad, as my ST30.  Buzzing!  Some people don't notice this.  And don't get me wrong, ALL plasma TVs buzz some, it's just the nature of the technology.  Anyway, both my Blu-ray player menu screen, and the Wii when it is loading a game show a solid white background with no sound and I could hear the buzzing from about 10 ft.  It's not bad, and some people might not care but because this is a living room TV and I like to have family slides going etc with no sound, this was not acceptable.  (the buzzing increase with how bright the image is. White [all colors] being the worst)  Also, when using the Pandora app I couldn't play piano music or classical because I would hear the buzzing whenever the music was quiet.  Drove me crazy.Anyway, read reviews that the VT series was much better about buzzing.  It was hard to give up the 5\" and go with the 55\" but now that I have it, I'm very happy. the buzzing is so faint with the VT it is now a non-issue.  Much quieter than the UT/ST series.  I did feel like the picture has a bit more pop on the UT though, I think it is the lack of the louver filter.

I've had this TV for two weeks: the first week was spent breaking it in as described extensively on avsforum, followed by using the settings that can be found there; the second week has been spent watching a variety of content. Reviews of this TV have brought up several issues that are important when considering Panasonic plasmas and they are addressed below.\u2022 Delivery: excellent from Amazon. It was unboxed and assembled then plugged in to be sure it worked OK. The delivery guy said that the Panasonics seldom had any problems requiring them to be sent back compared to other makes.\u2022 Buzzing: Absolutely not a problem with the set I received. Detectable (barely) only if you're within about a foot of the set.\u2022 Audio quality of speakers: completely acceptable. But for great sound I run everything through an external amp and speaker system.\u2022 The TV base: it is solid enough, but it doesn't rotate. However, the viewing angle of a plasma is far superior compared to that of an LCD (or \"LED\" LCD) so you can watch without sitting directly in front. Moreover I have a TV stand that has a swiveling stand so I can still swivel the set if I want.\u2022 3D quality: not yet evaluated. I tried the 2D to 3D conversion on a few 2D things. It works but I found it more disconcerting than anything as sometimes body parts wind up hanging in space. This would not be a problem with real 3D content. As for glasses, I used the Samsung SSG-4100GB 3D Active Glasses 2012 Models - they are far cheaper than the Panasonic ones (although flimsier) but work fine.\u2022 Screen glare: potentially problematic, but depends on your room. The screen is very reflective. If you're watching in a bright room ie windows and/or brightly lit lamps behind you, then you will see these reflections. In a dark room there is absolutely no problem. In fact, with this set black is black (unlike the LCD set being replaced). The next model up, the ST50, has a filter that seeks to mitigate any problem with reflections in bright rooms. Myself, I turn off the lights.I do like this TV. A lot. Absolutely no regrets. One last comment.

Pandora, if you didn't know, is meant to be used for hours while it plays songs that you \"like\" or \"dislike\" to build a station of songs for you. Its a great program. However, it destroys the image of the TV in startlingly short order. I have had my TV a year. I use it once every few days to play a DVD, something on Netflix or Pandora. In that time, it has now permanently burned the Pandora menu and titles into its screen. Panasonic sold a unit with a program on it that destroys the image after normal use for that program. The web is, I found out after purchase, overflowing with complaints of people who, after playing video games, watching sports, the news or somethiing else with a HUD, menu, or graphic, have ruined TVs within a few months of purchase. These plasmas are horrible. This is not like CRT or LCD image burning. Image burn occurs MUCH, MUCH faster on plasmas and this TV is no exception. Sure, the manual says to not leave an image on screen for too long. However, since Pandora was on the TV when I bought it, I expected that normal use of that program wouldn't ruin it. That's like selling a monitor with a computer with XP on it and saying \"don't leave images on screen too long\". The taskbar and icons are on screen practically non-stop. The issue is not in normal use, its in the poor hardware that can't take normal use of the software installed! I called Panasonic and they said that there was nothing they could do for me and that design flaws weren't within the pervue of the warranty. Save yourself a lot of remorse. Buy a LCD or, if you have the space and money, a CRT of this size. This is built to fail. This is not my only complain with this TV. There are others. Some include (it has ads on the menu screen, there is no power/eco/image save mode to allow sound with no image [sony offers this], it has insufficient connections, the remote has real weak range, etc.). On the plus side, it communicates well with SD cards and Panasonic cameras, is pretty easy to setup, and is easy to assemble. On the whole, though, it fails for having pre-installed software (that it sells itself on), which destroys the hardware.

Yes, it is true, however it is blown WAY out of proportion. Some of the reviews are so harsh on it, they make you feel like if you have more than one lamp on in the room, the tv will look terrible.I'm in a parlor floor brownstone apartment with massive (8+ft tall) bay windows in my living room, the kitchen window also shines into the living room. I have black curtains (doubled with sheer and blackout) on all the windows, alit of times I draw back the blackouts and let the sunlight shine through the sheer panels, and it performs much much better than I thought it would with the natural light that enters. Granted my windows are on the side of the room, and the TV is in the middle of the room.I like the dark. I don't use bright lights. I do not have many lightbulbs over 25 watts, and I use alot of candles. Basically all \"mood lighting\".. If you are like me, and looking for a 50/55/60\" tv on a budget, this is the one to get.Just wanted to address that first...... Onto the review.I've had it for about 6 weeks now. Viewing the 55\" model. The TV it replaced was a Samsung LCD and the difference in every aspect is like night and day...The TV is very handsome, unlike older Panasonics. It's eye candy even when the power is off. The stand receives a lot of criticism in appearance, but I don't think it's that bad... Yes it is plastic, but it is gloss plastic and looks nice imho. No swivel, this is a small disappointment... given the price point of the set it is understandable.2 HDMI is an issue, but can easily be fixed with a splitter. An optical audio output and the 2nd HDMI port provides ARC, so the audio outputs are adequate. The internal speakers are not terrible, but they leave alot to be desired. Bass response is absolutely terrible. External speakers are a must...... but again, given the pricepoint and pq, this is a trivial issue and easily remedied.The picture quality is EXCELLENT with everything I've thrown at it. Running a 2012 Panasonic \"home theatre in a box\" system, which also takes care of the stock audio issues. The system works very nicely with the Viera Link. Bluray obviously looks fantastic, DVDs look good. I run my MacBook Pro into the first HDMI. I don't know if its the mac or the tv, but even playing compressed movie files (7-800mb per 90mins) they look fantastic on the TV, I was very surprised about this. Works and streams files very good from my WD external HDD plugged directly into USB as well.The picture quality is excellent as I've said. It provides basic controls to calibrate it, though it would have been nice to have more calibration control available in the menus. Given what there is to work with, a good picture can be achieved for any setting needed.The TV does not have wifi built in. This is the biggest con IMO. But it does have an ethernet port so that you can run a wire from the router and not waste a USB port with a USB>Wifi adapter.The Viera Connect is a nice feature. The main interface is a little bit slow, a little bit dated looking, but it gets the job done. Netflix app is good and it streams in excellent quality. The Youtube app has a fantastic and attractive interface, this also streams in good quality. Includes Tunein and Pandora for audio and various other apps.The remote is basic and comfortable. The menus arent the easiest to navigate but Ive seen much worse. DLNA and all the wifi>tv streaming apps work well and display images in excellent quality.I have zero desire to watch 3DTV so I can not comment on it.Overall, this is a n excellent TV at an excellent price point. It has features that make for a very satisfying A/V experience. It has exceeded all of my expectations. I'm so impressed with panasomnic that I will eventually be moving this into the bedroom and saving up for a VT50 or VT60 for the living room.It really is a shame that plasma is on its way out.... LED and LCD displays just do not compare....

This is Panasonic's entry level Plasma Smart TV. As such, it lacks a few things. I would recommend to myself in the future, and to others: If a great TV is very important to you, you will have to pay the price. The extra $300 or so would be worth it to make you very happy down the road. But.....for the price and quality of picture, this one is VERY tempting, and an overall great bargain. So here it goes.PROS:*Awesome video quality. I am not so sure I have seen a TV display that comes in any better. Maybe some that are just as good, but certainly not better.*I did not find the sound to be all that bad, either. You certainly won't get room filling home theater sound from this unit on it's own, but it sounds pretty good anyways.*Easy to set up and figure out. Definitely be sure to attach the Ferrite cores, which are supplied, to the HDMI & USB cables, or the electronic buzzing won't be pleasant. (I found that out by skipping that step during initial set up).*Nice, easy to use smart tv menu. Also offers 3-D capability, but you will have to buy the glasses that work with this TV separately. And the ones they recommend (Panasonic, of course) are very expensive. So I have not tried the 3-D feature yet. I recently ordered a set of more reasonably priced Samsung SSG-4100GB 3-D Active Glasses, which are said to work well with this TV, and at less than half the price of the Panasonic glasses. When they arrive, and I try them out, I will update this review.*Remote control works well, even if it does seem like a relic from the days when Windows 98 was popular.CONS:*If you set this up in a well lit room or with plenty of sunlight coming in, the reflections could potentially be a real problem for you. Curtains, shades, or night time viewing will be necessary.*The cost cutting measures to get this TV at its attractive price point become obvious and annoying as time goes on. Among the missing: No built in Wi-Fi, no Web browser, no 3-D glasses included, no HDMI/USB cables supplied. There are only two HDMI ports, two USB ports, and no PC port. If you want to hook this up to your Computer, you will have to use one of the precious two HDMI ports. I would suggest asking yourself if you can live with such limited connect ability.*The price of this TV is great, but quickly, at least in my case, I realized I should have spent more. I can predict this becoming my bed room TV, and springing for a larger, more expensive Panasonic at some point. But if around $700 is all you have to work with, don't get me wrong. This is a fine TV.Bottom Line: The high quality Plasma display that Panasonic is famous for is certainly here. Add to that the fact it is a Smart TV, 3-D ready, and won't kill your budget, it's hard not to recommend this thing. Given the choice of a larger, off brand TV with more features, at around the same price, I personally would stick with this Panasonic. Just ask yourself if spending an extra few hundred or so on a larger, more top of the line Panasonic would be worth the initial financial pain.

I had only two faint band (1\" Wide) during first 2-3 weeks and no issues while watching normal content (Only shows during Grey & Green Background). But after 4 weeks, there were multiple vertical bands and looked like Screen Uniformity issue & visible during watching football. I emailed & called Panasonic but no satisfactory answer, Panasonic rep told that they are aware of this issue and looking into that. But I called Amazon for replacement instead of waiting for Panasonic response.I returned that & got an replacement 50UT50 & guess this set behaves very horrible, there are multiple visible bands including two 2\"-3\" wide visible in solid color background and moving slides(Mainly visible in dark Grey & Red background) but not visible during normal content. I really like the Picture Quality & Black level on this plasma & don't want to get another replacement or any other Sammy plasma. I am again going to contact Panasonic about this issue & see if can get any update. Meanwhile I'll wait for couple of weeks & if no issues while normal watching I am going to keep this.These banding/DSE issue is present on most of 2012 Panasonic Plasma including ST50 & also UT50 owners. Surprisingly Samsung doesn't have such issue (Their 2012 Plasma have great screen uniformity, Samsung still suffers from Flickring Brightness Issue), moreover Black Levels are best on Panasonic.

I had to send an off-Brand back to Amazon and get teh Panasonic glasses.This was out first exposure to home 3d TV, and my wife and I were suitably impressed.  Upgrading from 2D->3D is not bad.  Pictures on a home network media server can be upgraded to 3d, and while a few have some unusual effects, overall it is remarkable.  True 3D movies and programs from DirectTv are excellent.  I bought a copy of a movie we saw in the theater in 3D, and it was as good as watching the movie at the theater.  Of course, a 60\" screen does not compete with a full sized theater screen, but the overall effect is close enough to keep me from bothering to go to the theater to see a new release.The internet access is excellent as well.  I already used Roku and Amazon videos on demand, so I was familiar with internet Movie Options.  I have not explored a wireless keyboard yet, but there is a way to do general web browsing with this TV, and in time I may do that instead of using my Dell XPS laptop.There is also a Skype capability that is worth checking out.

The LEDs can't hold a candle to these plasmas.Plasmas do have a strange, blocky effect when displaying certain types of images where the color grades from light to dark, but I knew that going in. If you read the other reviews they will make you aware of the issue. If it's a problem for you, then you should get an LED.I haven't had any problems with the TV at all, but it took me a moment or two to realize why the picture looked wrong after setting it up. It turns out that you have to individually set up each input. Once you set up the picture on hdmi one, you have to go do it again on hdmi two and so forth. And you can have different settings for 3D than for 2D. At first it seems like a pain in the ass, but it's cool that you have so much control over how content looks. I found the best setting by looking around at other reviews.Oh, I just remembered there was an issues I have with the youtube app. It would stutter and pause HD content really bad sometimes.

Fast Forward to 2013 and here i was desperately looking for a nice Panasonic Plasma set that would at least match my 2009 G10 Plasma but at a much lower price and after tons of hours researching i found this gem of a TV from the 2012 lineup of Panasonic Plasma Smart 3D HDTV's.Make no mistake about it - the Panasonic VIERA TC-P55UT50 bests my older higher end model from 2009 (the Panasonic G10 Model) by a fairly high margin for a multiple of reasons. First being my new Panasonic VIERA TC-P55UT50 is simply newer tech compared to my older higher end G10 Panny. It has a much higher contrast ratio,Wi-Fi Capability, 600Hz Sub-field Drive 3D, 96Hz Playback of 24p, 2D to 3D converstion and a MUCH better a more experienced technology behind the panel in the Panasonic VIERA TC-P55UT50 that is by far the best bang for the buck even when compared to mid range Panasonic 2013's models.Panasonic VIERA TC-P55UT50 has two VERY IMPORTANT things going for it over its lower end siblings1. Most important, the Panasonic VIERA TC-P55UT50 sports a VERY IMPRESSIVE panel which is the  Neo Plasma Black 2500 FDD (Focused Field Drive) that delivers very INK'Y Blacks along with Colors that will make you stare in total awe once you get the picture settings calibrated!! The lower end models from 2012 do NOT come with this panel, only the higher end models have it! So the Panasonic VIERA TC-P55UT50 has this main factor going for it that gives it the best bang for the buck.2. The Panasonic VIERA TC-P55UT50 also is a fully featured 3D HDTV along with being a SMART TV with all the apps, netflicks, etc to navigate for it along with WiFi available via its USB ports.Simply put..if you can still find this 2012 Panasonic VIERA TC-P55UT50 ....go for it, Do your homework and you will see that this model from 2012 is what i call i some what freak-ish model that delivers the goods that match its higher end cousins of 2012 models and even including the 2013 models.The only thing lacking is more HDMI ports. This set comes with two hdmi outputs so if you have more then two devices that use HDMI ..you may need to re-consider or simply by a 15 dollar HDMI switch that will convert one of the TV's HDMI ports into 3 or 4 extra HDMI ports with a remote to switch inputs.I picked up this HDTV from a Amazon company called \"BLINQ\" as a \"Refurbished\" model in which i was hesitant in buying for being a refurbished model but i paid only 600 dollars which included shipping and this TV came in MINT condition. I checked the hours used on this TV and it was only 100 hours used and the TV came in original box with everything included ..simply put i got this MINT CONDITION HDTV from BlinQ for 600 dollars and it retails RIGHT NOW for 1400.00 dollars!! I paid less than half for this open box/refurbished HDTV which was a KILLER DEAL!! I cannot believe how MINT this tv was..no a single scratch and the TV is a high end performing HDTV for half the cost of what the higher end models..", "Date": "September 25, 2013"}, {"Title": "Great TV with a couple of minor inconveniences", "Author": "Joyce Gholson", "ReviewID": "R3FBJ6460UT1WJ", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "We've had this TV since March of 2012, and it's served us very well.  The picture quality is great, and we love having the apps in an easy to use format provided by Viera.  It also has a good selection of apps.  We've never used the 3D feature, so I can't comment on that aspect.The few quirks we've found with this TV include:- When watching Netflix, it won't let you use Dolby surround sound.  Changing the audio setting to Stereo Sound is the only way audio will play for Netflix.  We haven't found a way to fix this problem.  Maybe there is one, but after troubleshooting it with Netflix and extensively searching for solutions on the internet, we still haven't been able fix it.  It's just frustrating to not be able to use our surround sound system for Netflix.- Burn in image is a big risk.  We're actually getting it replaced by the Geek Squad at Best Buy because of that issue.  We bought the Geek Squad Protection Plan because of the risk of something going wrong with the TV since it's Plasma.  After having a screen saver on our DVR not cover the whole screen, we ended up with a nice big burn in image, so definitely be careful if you tend to leave your DVR paused for extended periods of time.  Make sure your screen saver will cover the whole screen if you do this on a regular basis!- Only 2 HDMI ports.  This isn't a big issue for some people, but we would like to have an easier time switching from DVR to PS3 or other devices that use HDMI without having to bend around to the back of the TV.  We use one port for the DVR and one for the surround sound system at all times, so it's a hassle when we want to hook up something different.  I wish there was at least one port on the side of the TV that would make this easier, but they are both located on the back.- You have to get a wireless adapter to put on the TV if an ethernet cord won't reach your TV.  In the age of everything being Wifi enabled, this seems weird.  Just know that it takes that extra step (and money) to make the TV internet ready.- The screen is really reflective.  I wasn't with my family members when they picked this TV out, so I would have definitely discouraged them from getting a TV that is reflective rather than matte.  It will reflect any light whatsoever.  That might not bother some people, but I can't stand it.Overall, these are the only problems we've found with this TV.

Picture is great, the features are great and overall really pleased.What I would like to note in this review is Amazon customer service.  They stepped up big and made me a lifetime customer.  Originally, I purchased the Panasonic one model down from this one.  When it came, the screen was completely shattered, which we did not discover until after the shippers left (always check before they leave, which later I learned they are supposed to do automatically anyway).  I called Amazon in a big huff and eventually spoke to a higher up who could make decisions.  The problem was, they were sold out of the same model TV I had purchased and could not send out a replacement.  Their solution was to just refund the money.  I was really set on this TV after all the research I had done and told them that was not an acceptable solution for me.  I wanted the same TV and if they could not offer the same, I would like the next model up at the same price, which they did have in stock.  About a week later, they picked up the shattered TV and I was watching my new Panasonic P55UT50.  They stayed in touch with me throughout to make sure everything went smooth and that I was happy with the outcome.  I would have been happiest if the first TV came without a problem, but sometimes problems do occur and Amazon handled it very well.", "Date": "April 15, 2013"}, {"Title": "Panasonic Viera", "Author": "Jonick", "ReviewID": "R29SB8T3D0EKCC", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I bought my new Plasma TV about two months ago. To say I am pleased would be a gross understatement. It is far more in every way than what I could have expected. The quality of the picture is better than any thing I have seen before. The skin tones are real, the picture is great even at edges of the screen. Its so clear in HD that the nature shows provide every thing but the smell of the great out doors. I said how good can the three D be well it matches up to the rest of the unit. Movie quality in 3D is now in my home, objects in the video are between me and the picture. I am in awe and very glad I bought the set. When I watch a program I often say Wow. Do your self a favor hop on....Panasonic you hit a homer...Well I have it over four months and I am still saying wow a lot. I bought a warranty from Square Deal, after 14 months I had a problem with the picture. I put a claim three weeks ago, today I was told that Square Deal will not be able to get it fixed, I will get a reimbursement for the cost of the TV.

It is still under warranty (I think); but I would say if you want to roll the dice here make sure you have an extended warranty either through purchase or through your credit card (check the literature that came with your card - you may already have an extended warranty plan and not even know it).Assuming it is properly and timely repaired, I will still be holding my breath since others report multiple failures even after repair. I am a bit surprised to hear this about a Panasonic TV since they have such a great reputation, but maybe they are slipping lately. Be warned.[EDIT: Set was repaired in two visits by a local tech. He came by and replaced one part, tested another and said it would take a couple of weeks to get the required circuit board. Two weeks later, the part arrived, he replaced it and everything works.

I have received several compliments on the picture quality from friends and family with similar TV's, and being that it is plasma, the refresh rate is a fantastic 600hz. While the color contrast and the absolute blacks definitely stand out better in dimly lit rooms, the TV is bright enough and picture quality is still great even in a fully lit room.It comes loaded with pretty much all the apps i would need, including youtube, netflix, amazon, cinemanow, and skype, though there is a built in app store that contains thousands more. Using these features is very easy and responsive as well.The 3D is great, though i dont use it that much.

The picture is really great.  The remote is easy to use.  I do have several small gripes though.  One was mentioned by another reviewer and that is that the screen doesn't have an anti-reflective surface so the reflections are strong during the day.  So you will have to get up and lower the shades.  You can buy an anti-glare film or cover that is supposed to lessen the glare.  I have seen them on line for under $200.00 for this size set but it's cheaper to lower the shades.  The two other things are that the set does not have auto volume leveling, meaning it doesn't lower the volume when loud commercials come on.  The third thing is that the set only has on-screen instructions though they are good, I would prefer to have a written instruction manual.  I have tried to find a phone number to ask Panasonic if they have a written manual but have not as of yet found a customer service number and I don't like that.  The Samsung I had had a toll free number in large letters on the front page of the instructions and they answered any questions and would help with set-up.

I have a 7 year old pioneer plasma pdp 43hd60 and 2 year old LG LCD. A year ago I was looking for LED TV for its slimness and low weight.  Most recently the plasma is in favor again because of  the new generation plasma has significantly reduce its weight and lower power consumption. I am fond of plasma for  its  crispy  and sharpness. I narrowed down two choices: Panasonic P50UT50 or Samsung D550. I finally go with Panasonic because of style and  complaints about Samsung noise. I bought this TV (Panasonic P50 UT50) a month ago from Amazon and it was on sale for $799I  I had TV for a month now and here is my 1st assessment:* Initial  Setup: I hooked up cable box with  HDMI cable the picture comes up right way after go through quick set process. The only glitch is the component video/composite video set up took me a while because of the jack is shared, the default is composite (video). I have to change to (comp.) for component. It took me a while to get my DVD picture in color.* Picture quality: the \"standard\" setting is on the dark side. I have to customize to get the contrast to \"100\". The viewing  is not as bright as my Pioneer. Color wise not as rich as LG LCD. Overall it is good, but not super.* Internet setup: The \"automatic\" setting does not work and I have to call Panasonic support to manually set up my ip address.  I have Verizon fios with wired connection so  I tested youtube and amazon instant video, the picture quality is nowhere near cable or blu-ray. Forget about this function,  the Internet video streaming is years behind.* Media player  through USB connection: I tried to connect my 300GB HDD and got error message \"USB port power overload\". I called Panasonic and I was told the TV could only handle USB flash drive smaller 64GB and in FAT32 format. Further the internal media player could only handle \"mp4\" and \"mkv\" video format (no avi, wmv). The \"DTS\" audio is not recognizable. Limited subtitle function.

I have owned for 15 months.  This is the second Panasonic Plasma I have purchased over last 4 years.  I thought of them as a company that would back their product quality even if something went wrong after warranty expired.  My first Panasonic had a problem where the TV would shut off automatically.  There was some hardware piece that needed replacing.  They sent a technician to replace the part and it cost me nothing.  This was 3 years ago.Fast forward to now.  My new 50 inch Plasma is making a horribly buzzing sound.  Almost unwatchable due to noise.  I called to report it and because my TV is older than 12 months, they would not fix it.  I went online and found that this problem is not unique and is happening quite a bit to other owners.  It seems like a flaw in the design that eventually causes the TV power supply to buzz.I haven't gotten a technician out here to fix yet as I am hoping Panasonic might still come thru.

Everything I read said it was the best picture around and overall the best bang for my buck. For a while, I'd say it was. But a month or 2 ago I started seeing these shadowy looking lines across the screen when I would see text or thin lines.Here's a good example:  [...]I called Panasonic about the issue they referred me to their local repair guys.  Their engineer says this is normal operation.  I'm like \"What?!  How is this distorted picture called normal??\"  So they say there's nothing they can change that will fix it.I called Panasonic back and they reiterated the same thing - it's normal operation.At this point I was angry, because I spent $1000 (that it took the better part of a year to save) on this TV expecting no such problems to occur - not to mention the fact that I researched this TV before I bought it (apparently not well enough)!So I did a little more digging and found out the issue I'm referring to is known as \"line bleed\" and it's common among plasma TV's.  Many folks don't see it often enough, so I guess it's overlooked by most reviewers as a problem.I argued back and forth with one of the managers, for a while because no one told me about this problem before I bought it, and frankly I feel cheated.  They referred me to another one of their \"specialized repair centers.\"  I'm pretty sure that will do me no good, but I'll call them anyways just to say I did it.

Nice picture but the bleed through on dark scenes was just awful - I think the panel was defective, so I returned it and purchased this TV instead.  Great decision and it was only $799 from a local warehouse store.  I have an older, 7th gen Panasonic 720p 50 inch plasma set from 2006 and it is STILL stunning by today's standards.  Plasma panels have much better longevity than the LED (LCD) sets and their colors are generally more accurate but that is debatable. In terms of picture quality there is no substitute for plasma.Out of the box the picture is quite dark and colors are not accurate at all.  Yes you will have to fiddle around and find the calibrations that work for your viewing pleasure.  CNET offers their calibration settings and they work well for me.  [...]  I'm no videophile but I do have a keen eye for what looks good and what doesn't.  The blacks are very black and there are no issues with dimming or bleed through since plasma sets don't suffer from those!The apps work well and the menu is simple enough for nearly anyone to understand.  I have not tried the 3D settings of the set however I'm not interested in 3D anyway so this was not a factor in my decision to purchase.  Bottom line is for the price this set cannot be beat.  Panasonic has been putting out plasma's for many years and this is yet another great example of why I'll always choose plasma over LED/LCD any day.
