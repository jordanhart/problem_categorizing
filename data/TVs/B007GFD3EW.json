The stand was easy to affix.  The tuner worked flawlessly on the first try.  The picture quality was everything that was advertised.  The sound is adequate and there many ways to upgrade.  I haven't tried any of the advanced features but for the price that I paid....I am ever so pleased!  The seller packaged this item remarkably well and it was delivered when promised!", "Date": "August 24, 2012"}, {"Title": "Did Not Include 12 Volt DC Power Adapter in Box!", "Author": "Rusty \"HeyVee\"", "ReviewID": "RL62XKOV2XFKF", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "This Supersonic 24 inch TV is the second \"off brand\" hi-def 12 volt television I've purchased.  Like other reviewers, this flat panel TV replaces a \"tube\" type in an RV travel trailer.  The sound, as noted by others, is very crappy and met that expectation 100%.  I also replaced the trailer's stereo with one designed for automobiles.  It has an AUX input which I connected to the Headphone output on the TV.  The picture quality is great and having a built in DVD player minimizes complexities.  The car stereo receiver produces great sound.I almost never write negative reviews; I prefer to either return the item or shop elsewhere next time.  In this instance, I feel compelled to share the downside of this transaction.  I mentioned to the Amazon folks that I'd prefer not having to write this review and that it would be reasonable for the Supersonic distributor to make good on the 12 volt functionality promised in the ad.The Supersonic TV is advertised as being a 12 volt unit, and so it is.  However, they DID NOT include a 12 volt DC connector cable;  included was an adapter that stepped household 110 AC down to 12 DC.  So, if you have shore power on your RV, you simply use the 110 plug already on the television.  If you're without a 110 AC power, you cannot use the 12 volt adapter.  This makes no sense at all.  Both connections require 110 AC.  You cannot use the typical 12 volt \"cigarette lighter\" plug to power the TV.  You have to buy one somewhere else.  No problem, I thought, I'll search Amazon and other sites.If you try search terms like \"12 volt replacement connector\" or similar terms, you'll not find the correct piece.  I contacted Amazon, and the fellow I spoke with also couldn't locate the correct connector.  Several times during our conversation, I suggested that it would be worth calling the supplier to find the proper piece.  For whatever reason, even though he seemed to have the best intentions, he diplomatically avoided that option.  A few hours later, he Emailed a link to the correct item for Supersonic TVs.  With shipping, it came to over $25.You wouldn't be a viable business if you tried selling a car without tires; a blender without a blade; a coffee brewer with a carafe; or any product missing a component needed to meet a functional requirement promised to the customer.  This 12 volt connector represents a 10% premium over the advertised price.  It would have changed my purchase decision had they revealed the absence of a proper connector.  Whats really irrational is that the 110 to 12 volt adapter in the box likely cost way more than the simple \"cigarette lighter\" style plug I needed.  I was also disappointed by Amazon's inability to contact the supplier, as one would do on E Bay, to make it right.Overall, the TV is acceptable as is, but, if you're price conscious, factor in extra expenses simple to operate it on 12 volt DC power.", "Date": "November 6, 2013"}, {"Title": "Works Great would purchase again", "Author": "h20houston", "ReviewID": "R18P6HXRNHIZB7", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "We purchased the TV to use in our RV.

I bought this for my RV.  Just remove the screw from the base, snap the base on and rotate and put the screw back in.  Plug in the power and hook it up and away you go.  The initial screen has you select your input (over the air) or cable, etc.  You just pick and it learns the channels and you are ready to go.  I haven't used the DVD yet.  Since I haven't wall mounted it, I kept all the packing to safely pack it back up and put it under the bench seat in the RV for travel.  Easy as pie.  Just don't bother tightening the screw beyond hand tight if you plan to pack and unpack it regularly.

Thought the 12 volt would allow us to use it without running the generator. It worked fine until it didn't (about 9 months). Called Supersonic and was told it was out of warranty. Warranty is 90 days. They must be real proud of it. Took it to a local TV repair shop and was told it was the main board, which is only available from Supersonic. They said it would cost more to repair than it was worth. Called Supersonic and asked if they would send the main board to the repair shop and I would pay them to install it. Was told no, Supersonic would have to do the repair. They offered to repair it foe $45 if I sent it to them. I figured a new box (I had recycled the original) plus shipping both ways I would have another $100+ in it and no assurance it would last more than 90 days again. The only way I am aware of to find the length of the warranty is to try to get it repaired. I assumed it would be 1 year as almost all others are.
