McRae", "ReviewID": "R3O16Z3ELSQDJF", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Though considered inferior to 1080 46\" models, being only a 720, after viewing this gem's picture quality in a major department store I was sold. Now becoming harder to find I acted timely and am now enjoying HD programming in total satisfaction. Some standard channels will take a little adjusting, but the picture quality seems to be constantly improving day-after-day. And according to test results in recent issues of Consumer Reports, there isn't much difference in 720 and 1080 picture quality amongst the better brands under 50\"s.You'll see the HD superiority after subscribing to it from your cable or satellite provider. And even without an upgrade in DVD players, your movies will still look noticeably sharper. A real bargain purchase.", "Date": "November 29, 2007"}, {"Title": "Sharp D43U", "Author": "princeofprop", "ReviewID": "R1VG6MJ4BIDYUK", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I have the d43u lcd by sharp.

Picture is good, but sound is not as other reviews have stated.  Sometimes you can have the sound up all the way and have trouble hearing people speak unless the room is quiet.  For better audio you will need a sound system which I have since purchased.  The picture is great though and the TV works great and is easy to use.  My only other issue was that if you connect a DVD or BluRay player to HDMI and you connect the Digital Audio Output to a receiver, you will only get 2 channel stereo because the HDMI ports don't support passing Dolby 5 channel surround sound.  What this means is that the player's audio must go directly to the receiver.  But I've been told that most TVs don't support this anyway.PROS:  great picture, easy to use, good priceCONS:  only 720p, sound quality", "Date": "October 17, 2008"}, {"Title": "question.....", "Author": "Byder \"byder_58\"", "ReviewID": "R3DPG860MF7Q0Q", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I'm noticing while brighter background colors are displayed, and the subject is darker I'm receiving faint gray horizontal lines on the brighter background.  It doesn't matter what device the image is coming from, upconvert dvd player, cable reciever, or xbox 360.  Its less noticeable on the HD cable signals.
