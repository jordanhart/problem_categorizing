{"Reviews": [{"Title": "I Luv this Great TV", "Author": "R. McLaughlin \"Stinkyonion\"", "ReviewID": "R2ZO1CNT7O451W", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I bought this a few weeks ago from the local big box (Amazon didnt offer it for sale yet).  Did extensive comparisons with the Panasonic 3d TV but bought this one because it is thinner and I might want to eventually mount on a wall.  I did notice that Aliens vs. Monsters does have some halo effect where sometime when something very light is next to something very dark it is like there is a smudge around the item (in the movie it most often occurs with the bleach blonde hair of Susan when she is in front of dark background, or around the moon at the beginning).  This really bugged me.  However, there is no other 3d source material to watch yet, and you cant even use the panasonic 3d demo as it wont work with the samsung tv, so I cant otherwise comment on this rare effect.  It does not occur in 2d to 3d conversion or in 2d ever.The screen has some glare when viewing dark material in daylight, but otherwise the TruBlack does a great job  of reducing glare, and 3D glasses reduce glare by 50% as well.  I rarely notice glare at all, which is surprising for a plasma.Other than the rare halo artifact (which is not visible on the Panasonic demo, but I havent seen Monsters vs. Aliens on the Panasonic tv) the tv is virtually flawless.  Put in a quality blueray source and the picture is a knockout.  Try King Kong, or Pirates of Caribean.  Wow.  I gaurantee you have never seen such a quality picture ever before.  Then, as there isnt currrently any significant 3d source material, try the 2d to 3d conversion (not available on the Panasonic).  Wow.  It does not have quite as much depth as made in 3d, and sometimes the 3d is not absolutely perfect, but it is amazing.  I just watch 2d to 3d all the time and cannot figure out how they do it.  The only thing that is annoying with the 2d to 3d is when multiple lines of text are on the screen, each line of text will be given a different depth apparently randomly which is a little wierd, especially because usually it should all be in the same plane.  People, scenery, sports, playstation games, etc. all look great--it just does a superb job of extrapolating the 2d into 3d.  Love Call of Duty in 2d to 3d.  It is like you are there.I do think that when viewing in 3d you want to be closer to the tv than you would be ordinarily (and many others feel the same).  You will also want a bigger screen than you would ordinarily want for 2d.  Otherwise, it is like you are looking through a window at a 3d world.  I have a home theater room with 100 inch screen and cant wait to get a 3d projector (not available yet in 1080p), but would recommend the largest 3d tv that you can afford, and 63 inches to me is only a half as large as I think is optimum.Sony and LG are supposed to come out with 3d tvs this June in time for the ESPN 3D launch for World Cup Soccer.  As they are LCD based systems they are inferior to the plasmas of Panasonic and Samsung because of the much lower refresh rates.  The professional reviewers who saw them at the consumer electronics show in Las Vegas commented that they were not as good as the Panasonic and Samsung.Only things I dont like about the tv besides the occasional halo effect:  The stylish remote will only control samsung components, and it annoyingly does that.  For example, each time I turn on TV it turns on the samsung blueray player as well which automatically starts playing.  I only wanted to watch TV.  Rubbish.  Plop down a few hundred extra dollars and get the Harmony One remote (but the other harmonies are all crap).  Youll be glad you did.Also avoid the Samsung receiver, it is known to have a lot of problems.  Pioneer carries the only other HDMI 1.4 receivers at this time that I am aware of and it works fine for me, although not truly necessary unless you want to pipe the HDMI through the receiver on the way to the TV.Overall this TV rocks.  The 2d and 3d pictures are stunning.  The glasses are more comfortable than the Panasonic's.  The TV is only an inch thick compared to 4 inches for the panasonic which makes it look like it is from yesteryear.  If you are going to wall mount for this reason alone get the Samsung.  The LED tvs all suck compared to the plasmas for 3D (although the LEDs are reportedly a little lighter, brighter, lower energy, and better ambient light control all these advantages are slight and the difference in 3d picture quality is large).Get this TV, you will be glad you did as it is the best of the currently available choices, unless you can wait a year for 3d 1080p projectors and have a dedicated dark room for the projector.Yes, there is almost no 3d source material currently, but the 2D to 3D conversion alone makes it worth it.One more note about the 3 channels coming for 3d (ESPN 3D, Discovery 3D, and the third I forget).  All cable boxes currently in existance have HDMI 1.3.  This wont carry enuf bandwith for 3D, so you can only view 720P picture in 3D as I understand it.  I will update post in mid June when view these 720P 3D on ESPN 3D.  So far, DishTV and Comcast have contracted to become carriers for ESPN 3D but noone else.  Hopefully, 3D TIVO and cable boxes will come soon, as well as more movies besides just Monsters vs. Aliens.  Mid summer is release of playstation 3D upgrade, and 3d games should shortly follow, but because of the HDMI 1.3 jack on PS3 these also in 720P only.6/15/10  Update:I still love the TV.  World Cup Soccer on ESPN  3D is very nice in 3D, (but had to get new cable box from Comcast (have to have one that works with HDMI output, not coaxial output).  Shows shot in 3d definately have more depth than 2d to 3d conversion.  The 2d to 3d conversion has occasional problems, like in hockey it couldnt understand the ice and makes the ice as a backdrop with the players flying through the air.  Works great most of the time, but frankly becomes a novelty after a while.Almost all brands of receivers now out with HDMI 1.4.", "Date": "May 20, 2010"}, {"Title": "Buzzing ruins an otherwise excellent TV", "Author": "skooba", "ReviewID": "R17IDAQHM2BN3Q", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I've had this TV for 3 days now.  I'm not going to go into great detail on the picture quality, because other reviews have commented on how good it is.  The purpose of this review is to be a data point for a buzzing set.  I have the latest firmware, the ferrite cores installed around the power cord, and the tv is sitting away from the wall.  It BUZZES, plain and simple.  If you're anywhere in front of the TV itself, it can be heard.  If you move your head beyond the bezel of the TV, the buzzing goes away almost 100%.  I sit 15 feet away and can clearly hear it during low volume.  I'm trying to keep the volume loud enough to drown it out, but during quiet scenes I hear it.  It's a very high pitched frequency.  My parents cannot hear it (56 years old), but I clearly can (27 years old).  My girlfriend can hear it but she says it doesn't bother her.  It bothers me, to the point where I am not enjoying the TV.I contacted ABT (one of the sellers listed here on Amazon) and they simply state \"all plasmas buzz.\"  While that is true to an extent, they don't buzz like this model.  Both of my brother's have plasmas.  One is a 58b550 that doesn't buzz like this, the other is a 60\" Pioneer Kuro that doesn't buzz like this.  I have a Samsung tech coming out soon, but I'm fairly confident on what will be said, either a) it's a normal sound or b) I'll need a complete new panel.  I don't want either.  I want to return the set and exchange it for the same model with hopefully a newer build date to see if the issue has been addressed.  If not I'll move on to a different TV.If you aren't able to hear extremely high frequency sounds, then you'll fall in love with this TV.  If you can hear it, and you have the TV positioned so you sit in front of it at eye level, it will bother you.  If you mount it above eye level so that the bottom of the bezel is above your eyes, you will not hear it.I really wish this set didn't buzz.  It's an awesome TV aside from the horrendous noise it emits.  It's sleek, attractive, runs cool in comparison to other plasmas, decent black levels, excellent color reproduction, great video processing, but oh man, the buzzing.I hope this review helps others to make sure beforehand that they can/can't hear this type of buzzing.  Hopefully it will save you the headache that I am currently going through.", "Date": "June 13, 2010"}, {"Title": "Best TV I have ever had", "Author": "K. Burke", "ReviewID": "R1IRNZK3GA6P2V", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I bought this tv to replace my Sony 52\" XBR4 (Which was great when it first came out) becuase I wanted the new 3D technology as well as well as a good HD TV. This is my first Plasma TV. I have 4 other LCD TVs that work great but I was really impressed witht he picture of the Plasma. The black are definately blacker than my LCDs. For a general HD TV it has the best picture out of all my TVs and it is also one of the best I have seen on the market. The internet on the TV is pretty good. It was easy to set up. I am using it directly connected to my router so it is wired. I did not fell like paying $80 extra dollars for the wireless adapter plus I had a Gigaswitch located in my rack that was easy to run a cable. The apps for the internet were quite responsice to my surprise. I though there would be a long lag time but that was not so. You have access to sports scores, weather, YouTube and Netflix just to name a few. I did notice a buzzing noise at first as mentioned in other reviews but it was only there when I initially installed it and now it its no longer there.Now onto the 3D. I demoed it at the store and I was pretty impressed. It was on a 47\" or 52\" LCD I think. It was not until I got the 63\" in my house that I was blown away. The 3D on the plasma was so much better. The picture just looked like it was going to pop right off the screen. I was really impressed with the 2D to 3D function of this tv. It actually works. It may not be the best but it works quite well. Yes you do look silly wearing the glasses but they felt really comfortable. I wear glasses and the 3D glasses fit right over them nicely. I did not get dizzy or get any headaches.I wanted to clarify some information about setting up a 3D system. when going to some stores i was given some wrong information. I was told that I would need to buy all the same brands for all the equipment needed. So I would need to buy the Samsung TV, Glasses and Blu-ray player. I knew that I need the TV and the Glasses to be the same but the Blu-ray player does not. I wanted to purchase the Panasonic Blu-ray player becuase it had the duel HDMI ports on it so that I would not have to upgrade to a receiver that has HDMI 1.4 to get the HD audio. I did purchase the Panasonic blu-ray and it works just fine. This is the way to go if you have an older Reciever with HDMI Switching and you want to get Dolby Digital HD and DTS Master Audio HD from your Blu-ray player.I would definately recommend it to anyone.", "Date": "May 20, 2010"}, {"Title": "Happy owner", "Author": "K. Arsala", "ReviewID": "R39JGVW5BGEKVG", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I researched for about 1 month before deciding on this TV.  Initially I thought I would buy a Sony but I started leaning towards the Samsung 55 inch LED.  However after demoing this TV and reading about it extensively, I decided to go for it.  I made the right decision.  If you are thinking about getting the Samsung LED over this, I would strongly suggest this Plasma.  Infact I think its the best TV available other than the Samsung 9000 series LED which costs more than twice as much and is smaller.Pros: Outstanding Black level, I didn't realize how important black level was to the overall picture quality.  Outstanding color reproduction, I am seeing shades that I didn't know existed.  Good color vibrancy: Bright and outstanding in low lit rooms.  Ok in bright rooms, there is some reflection. and not as bright as the LED, but viewing LED at angles is absolutely horrible.  This TV is great when watching from any angle.Cons: Does buzz a bit, but its just at the borderline of being annoying.  So far I only hear it when listening at very low volume when the kids are sleeping.  But not too noticeable.  It does get a little louder when switching to 3D.  If it gets any louder i would have a problem with it, but not now.Also this set generates alot of heat, i was surprised, but read elsewhere its normal.  I mean it is a very big screen so its understandable.Other thoughts:Only get this TV if you don't watch much standard definition TV, its too big and just magnifies the defects of SD, get 46 inch or smaller.  If you watch alot of HD, then you'll be happy.I was not impressed with the 2D to 3D conversion.  Maybe i'm not watching good source material, but it didn't seem to add much depth and instead made the picture darker.Watching my home movie which is recorded in my HD Camcorder is amazing! Its like watching HD TV.Can't wait for the PS3 upgrade to be able to play 3D videos and games.  I'm sure watching a 3D source will be worth the wait.This TV's picture quality is so good that you notice the slightest defects in the picture itself when for example the camera is trying to focus, you can see the slightest shifts in focus, light changes and camera movements.  I was thinking that the picture is so good and large that it amplifies the defects of the recording itself.All in all, this is a fantastic TV.UPDATE After 1 Month of Ownership:There were many factors that made me choose this TV over the LED. For the same price, the size--going from 55 to 63 inches is a big difference, you are increasing viewing area by about 25%. 600 HZ refresh is also very important, I hate to have pixilation or picture jutter, when demoing the LED I noticed it more..... I only get it very rarely on this TV, usually when the entire camera pans up/down, not so much side to side. Also the picture brightness is almost equal to the LED, the LED has an edge in this area, but it also makes the picture appear a bit artificial, almost too much vibrancy that does not seem natural. The Black level is superior but 3D is alot better than the LED. Plasmas reproduce better 3D. Also, viewing angle was important to me since my viewing position would not be head on in my living room. LEDs are not good when viewed from angles. It has been one month now since I've purchased this TV and am very sure I made the right decision. I would strongly urge getting this over the LED.", "Date": "June 15, 2010"}, {"Title": "Great choice for a large format plasma TV - Four and a half stars", "Author": "Adam", "ReviewID": "RCD7D2HJSYB09", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I recently decided to replace my 5 year old Sony LCOS/SXRD 50\" TV.  The Sony has served me well and to this day has an outstanding picture quality, but I wanted to upgrade to a larger size and a flat panel due to buying a new house with a larger TV room.  The front of my couch is about 15' away from my TV, so I wanted a large screen.When looking for a new TV, my #1 concern was and is 2D picture quality in a large sized flat panel screen.  I could care less about 3D - I think 3D is a stupid gimmick, but because most of the top end TVs with the best 2D quality have it, I was stuck looking mostly at 3D capable TVs.  For this reason, I'm actually happy the Samsung doesn't come with 3D glasses as that would add another $100 or so to the price.  I also wanted true 1080p/24 capability, and to my surprise only a handful of TVs offer this, which was surprising given Blu-ray has been available for awhile now.  When I started my search, I was absolutely certain that I wanted an LED LCD TV, but after doing some research and looking at TVs in stores, I was surprised to learn that Plasma isn't dead yet, in fact IMO it's the best choice for large screens (over 50\").  Five years ago when I bought my sony I was turned off to plasma due to 1) risk of burn in and 2) the high gloss screens didn't do well in light or bright environments.  In my opinion, both of these issues have been put to bed and Plasma deserves a very close look.I read the CNET reviews (both editor and user) as well as many Amazon and other reviews as I could.  I also went to Best Buy and looked at the competing models/technologies, though honestly I think going to such stores is not very helpful because you never know about the connection and the terrible overhead flourescent lighting does a poor job of represented how the TV will look in your house.  Suffice to say, based on this research (and the in store look) I determined that Plasma TVs in general (and this Samsung in particular) would offer the best choice based on my viewing needs - mostly movies, HD TV, some gaming.  I don't watch a lot of sports, but wanted the capability for when I do (and Plasma seems to handle the motion better than LED/LCD).  The room my TV is in does have some ambient light although it does have good blinds, I wanted a TV that would look ok with some ambient light.I've had this TV up and running since this morning, and have a few observations:1) As expected (confirming my in store look as well as other reviews), picture quality is excellent.  I'm very happy.  The color was a bit off out of the box, but I went to CNET.com and printed off their recommended calibration settings - it look me about 10 minutes to complete the calibration and I'm happy with the results, though I'm sure I'll continue to tweak them over time.  If you print off the CNET recommended settings (just go to their review of the TV and click the link), the calibration is very easy to complete even for the technology challenged.  Picture from the HD cable box looks very good, picture for a blu-ray through my PS3 looks out of this world.  After calibrating, I watched some Top Gear on BBC America HD and the picture quality was very good.  Then I popped a Blu Ray of Revolver on my PS3 and was blown away - in particular there were several scenes in the film with old black cadillacs, and the black paint on the Caddys looked spectacular - deep black, clean, and glossy.2) It does very well with some ambient light.  This was one of the strengths of this TV highlighted in the CNET and other reviews, and I'm very happy with the performance of the Samsung in this regard.3) It's huge - but I'm glad I went with the 63\".  I have mine in a 15x20 room (oriented with the TV against one of the shorter 15' walls).  If you're on the fence, don't be afraid to go with the bigger size.4) Many reviews commented that the TVs internal speakers are a weak point.  My old Sony had excellent speakers, so I was a bit worried about this.  In my opinion, these speakers are just fine for normal TV viewing, though a bit weak for movies.  I do plan to purchase a home theater system.  (edit: I ended up purchasing a Marantz SR5005 Audio Video Receiver (Black) receiver and a 5.1 speaker system from Aperion Audio ... I do recommend if you buy this TV you at least upgrade to a soundbar if not a home theater system).5) It looks great and as noted it is very thin - very nice for a plasma screen of this size.6) It's packed with features.  Netflix streaming is a cool feature although I already had the capability on my PS3.  It's got plenty of inputs - and a great feature is the inputs are oriented parallel to the TV, which is a great convenience (almost a necessity) if you want to mount your TV close to the wall.7) Finally, the infamous BUZZING:  Does it buzz?  Well, mine does have a slight buzz.  Emphasis on slight.  In my opinion, it's not unusually loud compared to other household electronics/appliances that may buzz or have fans or otherwise make noise.  Guys, electronic things sometimes buzz or hum.  Take my house for example - my refrigerator hums, my small beer fridge hums, my wine cooler hums, my overhead fan hums, my HV/AC constantly cycling on and off hums - IMO having one more electronic gadget that makes a slight noise is a negligible change.  I think this issue has gotten more attention than it warrants, it was something I was a bit worried about when I ordered (only because it was mentioned in so many reviews) but now that I have the TV up I think it's a non issue.  It's not really noticeable with the volume on, and it's one of those constant noises (like a fan) that you just sort of get used to.  Importantly, I'd note that of all the mentioned appliances/electronics in my house that make a noise, the ONLY one that bothers me is my XBOX 360 - I'd say the buzz on the Samsung is about one tenth of the XBOX.  So for those of you who already live with an XBOX and the \"buzzing\" reports about the Samsung are conjuring up similar mental images, I wouldn't worry about the TV as it's nowhere near as loud as the 360.  Bottom line - if you're worried about the buzzing, don't, simply buy the TV from Amazon and if the buzzing bothers you, return it.  I have a feeling a lot of people who otherwise never would have noticed or been bothered by the buzzing have read about it in reviews and got themselves so worked up that they get the TV and are bothered by this non-issue.  I'm sorry I wasted so much of this review talking about buzzing but I think it had to be addressed.After doing my research and knowing what I was looking for in this size and picture quality range, I ultimately narrowed my choice down to this Samsung line as well as the Panasonic VT25 line Panasonic TC-P65VT25 65-inch 3D Ready 1080p VIERA Plasma HDTV and I chose the Samsung.  While I'm not always a huge fan of direct comparisons, I'm sure a lot of people reading these reviews have narrowed it down to the same two choices.  For that reason, I will outline why I think, at least for my needs, the Samsung is the better choice:1) The biggest positive mentioned about the Panasonic TV is its outstanding black levels.  While this is true, I'd highlight the following: The samsung's black levels, while not quite as good as the Panny, are still very very good.  Also, the Panasonic black levels deteriorate over time - this is a documented fact regarding prior year panasonic plasmas and it was confirmed by CNET for this new model.  True, apparently even after they deteriorate the black levels are still excellent, but I'm not sure I'm willing to gamble with the unknown of what's going to happen after a number of years, especially when it seems the excellent black levels are the #1 reason for recommending the Panasonic.  Also, I'd highlight that black levels are just one aspect of picture quality - on every other measure of picture quality, the Samsung stacks up very well against and often better than the Panasonic.  Bottom line - they both have excellent picture quality, I wouldn't get too hung up on minute black level differences.2) The Samsung is significantly cheaper.3) This was a big one for me - the Samsung is significantly thinner and lighter than the Panasonic.  This is important if you plan to mount the TV on the wall.  According to Panasonics website, the TC-P65VT25 has a depth of 3.6 inches.  The Samsung has a depth of only 1.4 inches.  That's an enormous difference.  On top of this, as I mentioned earlier the Samsung has most of it's inputs oriented parallel to the TV (so the cords come in sideways).  The Panny has most of its inputs oriented perpendicular to the TV (so the cords face into the TV) - this will be an issue if you want to mount the TV snug to the wall.  Buying a bunch of 90 degree angle adapters will help the problem, but it still won't be as tight as if the inputs were oriented parallel.  I was able to mount my Samsung very flush to the wall, such that the front of the bezel is only about 2\" from the wall.  While I'm sure it's possible to mount the Panasonic to a wall, it will be more difficult and you won't be able to achieve nearly as clean a result - the front of the TV will be 4-5\" from the wall by the time it's all said and done.  If you're interested, I mounted mine using the Sanus Systems LL11-B1 37-Inch to 65-Inch Ultra-Thin Flat Panel Mount which is well built and very low profile, but to be honest I'm not thrilled with it - it might be a little too low profile and I'm having a hard time getting the mount to lock in correctly (even with a slightly less low profile mount the front of the panel will still be only about 2\" from the wall).4) The Samsung has excellent performance in rooms with any ambient lighting (i.e. if you have a window in your TV room).  If there's much ambient lighting present, the black level advantage of the Panasonic will be negated by the Samsung's superior bright room performance.Bottom line - large size, thin and sleek design, great 2D picture quality (3D is also supposedly at or near best in class, but as noted I don't care about this and haven't tested the 3D or 2D to 3D conversion capability).  In my opinion the Samsung PN63C8000 is a great choice for a large screen flat panel TV.", "Date": "December 23, 2010"}, {"Title": "Like sitting under a power line!", "Author": "Moviefiend \"Andy\"", "ReviewID": "R3JM91OQU9QTRR", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "Like others who have purchased this television, I was just amazed by the picture quality.  Absolutely beautiful. In fact, I was really impressed by the overall appearance of the television itself.  What I could not tolerate was the buzzing!  Upon receiving my second Samsung C8000 plasma (the first had to be refused b/c of an end to end crack in the screen), I was incredibly excited.  I hired the Geek Squad to mount the television and set-up my Onkyo surround sound.  As the technician was showing me how to use the various components, he and his assistant stopped and asked \"what is that buzzing.\"  Uninitiated by myself, he went through and double checked the various components to ensure that it indeed was the television making the buzzing noise. After deciding that it was, he stated that in five years of setting up home theater systems he had never heard such a loud buzzing sound from a television! He said this had to be damaged and when he returned to BB, he would place an order for a new television. Now, he did say that he had set-up one other c8000, a 58\" version, and had not heard such a loud buzzing, so it is possible that non-buzzers exist (or at least televisions with a more subtle buzzing noise).  And I should also state that all three of us in the room (and later a fourth person who double checked on it) were all men under the age of 30.  And I am at a fairly high elevation (around 5200 ft). Variables that others have cited as potentially leading to a more intense buzzing experience.Anyways, I had the television for a week and bzzzzzz. Intolerable. I mean just horrible. What is the point of a high end television and high end surround system if I need to sit to the side to drown it out(as others have said) or crank the receiver volume up. I mean, I literally felt as though I was sitting under a power line.So the second television arrives a week later and it is the exact same experience.  I sat there staring at it for 4 hrs trying to decide what to do with it, but could not justify spending so much money in order to try and live with the television.  Soooo, my Panasonic 65VT25 should be here by next weekend.I am not sure why some people have not had major issues with this.  I mean I have high end monster cables, had this thing professionally installed and EVERYBODY heard the bzzzzz. For me at least, it was not subtle. If I can hear it, it is too loud. I just cannot understand why people are considering keeping a $3300 television that buzzes, when you can pay a $1000 more for a panasonic that has fixed the black level issues. Or even purchase a smaller version of a pansonic at the same price point or switch to led/lcd.  If you do not have the buzz, than you are very lucky and got yourself one heck of a television. If you do and it bothers you, don't settle.Moral of the story. Purchase the television from Amazon, Best Buy or some other store with a GREAT return policy.  Samsung costumer service will likely say the buzzing is normal and I would have been one unhappy camper if I had had to keep this television.Good luck with your shopping!ps. This television seems particularly fragile, even for a plasma. If you order from a store with a poor return policy, make sure you go over it with a fine tooth comb before accepting delivery.", "Date": "November 14, 2010"}, {"Title": "Just what I was after...", "Author": "Howdydooit", "ReviewID": "R347CR1I7RHKQ0", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I have been waiting a while to get a decent high end TV, and have browsed for a good while to select this one. It goes in a room with a fair degree of ambient light, and I thought a TV design that pays the most attention to decent blacks would be a good way to go.This was a bundle at a special price (BD player, glasses, 3D movie, and TV). The first one arrived with a cracked screen after waiting 6 weeks. Amazon customer service was all over it, but a new set was going to take 4 more weeks. It ended up coming little sooner. They offered me many other deals - substituting a 7000, etc., but I held out for what I originally ordered, and it was worth it. The set arrived in early October, and it was manufactured in September.So, under those limited conditions, these are my thoughts.Picture:The settings out of the box seem fine to me. At some point I might play with it, but outside of having it calibrated, I am quite satisfied with how it looks. Details in shadow is good. Color is rich, and not over bright like in a store. I'm in the process of getting the cable hooked back up, so our watching has been via antenna, WiFi, and the bundle included DVD player (BD6800).Live HD TV looks awesome, and digital SD TV looks way better than I expected. colors are rich, detail is crisp.  Complex patterns on things like sweaters or telephone lines do not moire (although depending upon the signal, can have a few issues if you watch for it). One anecdote: watching an old Seinfeld episode (the 1990s were before HD), there was one character who required a makeup appliance to their face for part of the story (a large nose). The station was transmitting in HD, via antenna. Closeups on this person were practically unwatchable, as the makeup was woefully bad. I'm sure this was not an issue on SD analog broadcasts, so they probably didn't even worry about it, but it was shockingly bad when we saw it. I guess old shows that were filmed (as opposed to video taped) convert well to HD, because this makeup job was hideous.The picture just blows everyone who sees it away. It's so much better than I'm used to, so I'm probably too biased, but I thought it was noticeably better than everything in the store when I auditioned it except the new Panasonic 3D 65\" (TC-P65VT25). It's hard to tell, because brightness is so over driven in stores.Tuner:This tuner is more sensitive than a 2 year old Sharp Aquos 32\" TV we had in the same spot (using an amplified Radio Shack loop and rabbit ears). We are in a decent signal area between two cities, and get a fair amount of signals. On a weaker signal just above the threshold for pixelization, artifacts pop in every so often, but are not distracting.On Line Content:I have not tested the on line content direct from the TV because I don't have the proprietary WiFi accessory nor a CAT 5 connection, so I have been using Samsung's on line content via the BD player, which has WiFi built in. Why they didn't do this with the TV I don't know.On line content (assuming it the same as the TV offers when connected directly) leaves something to be desired. Haven't spent much time on the games. They provide some mild amusement, but we're not video gamers. I would suspect if you are, these won't satisfy much. Connecting to the network only took a minute or two, including my WEP key (other encryption also supported), but my initial firmware update (on the player) just would not execute. Samsung support suggested I use a flash drive from a PC to download the file, unzip it, and then plug the flash drive into the player. That worked like a charm, and subsequent firmware updates have not required that process.We haven't used the trial for VOD via NetFlix or Blockbuster yet, so can't comment on that. Standard internet content (Youtube)is interesting, but resolution is low, so the experience is more for convenience. Google maps: It's a little eerie to be looking at your house from space on your TV. On a computer it's something you take for granted. On a large screen TV from your family room, it \"feels\" a little intrusive. You can also watch media from a USB flash drive or the network, and you can even play music via the same.Any on line content requiring alpha numeric text to navigate can be somewhat maddening. As great as the remote is, the interface is not always intuitive. I say always, because while trying to do alpha numeric on a Google map search we could not figure out how to navigate the Samsung on screen interface, but on youtube it was less complicated, just slow to maneuver. It didn't make sense to me that the options on screen for selecting text were different for one than the other. I tend to avoid those features for that reason. Maybe a wireless keyboard would solve that issue. At least the response time is fast (not quite immediate), unlike a FiOS cable box, where the lag can drive you crazy.Remote & GUI:The remote is simple to use and not busy with a zillion nonesensical buttons. It's layed out extremely well, and clearly marked with large, square buttons, so my wife actually doesn't keep calling me into the room to help her navigate back to where she wants to be, and it's also very attractive (bright silver metal housing), and backlit.Menus, channel changes, etc. are instantaneous.  The GUI is very clean, transparent, and easy to navigate.  It doesn't take long to learn it and get good at using it.  Most tasks can be accomplished fairly quickly and without drilling too deep, and it's quick to exit.Audio:The sound is fairly anemic with built in speakers - adequate for a large open space we have it in, but nothing to look forward to. Hooking up my theater will solve that.3D:Going from 2D to 3D is extremely easy (taking a 2D source and simulating 3D), but I don't think anyone is going to really want to do that much. It's an \"interesting effect\" but not consistent, and frankly the picture is so stunning, not necessary. Watching 2D NCAA/NFL football in 3D, the graphics float in the foreground (pretty interesting), and the game action has a subtle 3D effect, but it doesn't buy you much.Watching 3D content is kind of cool. The bundle came with a 3D animated feature (Monsters vs Aliens) which was fun, and you can easily switch to 2D on any 3D content if your glasses aren't handy. Watching the World Cup in 3D in a store was pretty wild. At one point there was a guy standing in front of me who was not in the room!If you're going to watch 3D, it's best in a dark room, and especially where it's dark behind you. My TV is in an open floor plan, where lights from other rooms are behind me. I've noticed it gets distracting to watch 3D when there is light reflecting off the glasses from behind, but the program is much enhanced when that is not the case. At first I thought the 3D was very underwhelming. It's not perfect, but subtle glare from behind has a subliminal effect that really subtracts from the experience, so 3D content is more fun than I originally experienced once I eliminated that.Other notes:Aesthetically, the set is gorgeous. It's also razor thin. I should also add I don't get the electrical hum people complain about on earlier large screen Samsung sets.The BD player has been excellent. Fast to load SD and starts up really quickly.

I thought it was just a bad set but the display model at two other stores had the same problem.  Traded the LED in for this beautiful plasma set, and I couldn't be happier.  This television has a nearly identical form factor, but the picture is better in every way than the LED.  Much deeper blacks, richer colors overall, better with fast motion (football), and more life-like images.  Don't notice any buzz at all.  I haven't checked out 3D yet, as I was buying this for the 2D picture, but having 3D for the future is just an added bonus.  Better yet, this plasma is still cheaper than the 65\" LED.  You will not be disappointed, this is the best Samsung TV that I've ever seen.UPDATE!!!  The television began having problems right after the warranty expired.  There are pinkish purple dots that appear along the edges of the screen whenever there is a white background or a light colored background as is common with children's shows.

This version uses bluetooth synch to keep the LCD glasses on/off shutters aligned with the TV 3D display signal. The 1.0 version in all the 2010 and 1H'11 Samsung LCD and Plasma uses an IR signal, similar to your TV remote control. The 1.0 version initial reports are that the IR signal can see interference and is sensitive to viewing angle and location in the room, leading to loss of synch and double images which ruin the 3D effect. The new 2.0 glasses will use blue tooth RF signal to fix this issue. Initial reports thought this should be an easy backwards compatibility issue, since Samsung can use existing bluetooth dongles to link to the new 2.0 glasses with a simple firmware update. This way the 2010 and 1H'11 loyal customers can use the new improved glasses. Now we are hearing that Samsung would like to deny any backwards compatibility to punish early adopters and try to force an upgrade to the newer TVs. I could deal if they charged me a few hundred bucks for the BT dongle, for the firmware update and another several hundred for all new glasses, but to be so greedy as to want me to have to get a whole new TV? That seems to show a lack of respect for early adopters.That said, I believe most bought the TV for the marvelous 2D picture.So be warned, the 3D is obsolete before you purchase and Samsung, so far, does not seem like they will have the integrity or concern to allow backwards compatibility. Clearly the 3D needs fixing, based on the synch problems. Rather than fix it for existing customers, they will fix it for only new customers. Existing customer must live with the defective product or return it.UPDATE:The TV had significant buzzing that could be heard from over 10' away at low volume. The manufacture date was Dec'10.

Amazon's service, the delivery, the professional installation (we found the local installer through Amazon, as well), all were topnotch and had I written this review at that time, I would have given it 5+ stars.  We were so happy.  Picture quality was tremendous.  While we didn't watch 3D as much as we expected to, the 3D effects were awesome.  All in all, we thought we had the mother of all TVs.  My husband, a huge sports fan, was in Sports Heaven.  We often marveled at the unbelievable picture quality.  We had none of those buzzing sounds mentioned by some of the other reviewers here.  We had no issues whatsoever.  It was by far the best TV either of us had ever owned and we've owned a few in our lifetime.But then, last Sunday, while watching football, the TV all of a sudden simply turned itself off.  In the middle of the game!  Just like that.  No warning, nothing.  We never had any issues that would let us know that something was up with our set.  It was a beautiful day, so there was no lightning anywhere near.  No power surge.  No reason whatsoever why it would turn itself off and it simply wouldn't come back on.  When you clicked it back on, it would make that sound it makes right before you see the screen come to live, but nothing would appear on the screen, and then it would turn itself off again.Since the TV had been perfect up to this very second, we figured it had to be something minor.  After all, it's only a little over a year old.  Surely this was nothing major!We had three different TV repair experts come to our house to take a look.  At one time, after carefully testing all the boards, it looked like the problem might be with one of those boards, so a new one was ordered and installed a couple of days later.  But that did not work.  Additional careful testing finally indicated that the problem was with the whole system.  Apparently, they have seen a lot of these same issues pop up lately... and they were all Samsung Plasma TVs like ours, bought within the last couple of years!!  In fact, one of the repairmen informed us that we were his THIRD customer this week alone who had to be told that their less than two-year-old Samsung Plasma TV was now a piece of junk and would have to be tossed, as repairing it would cost more than buying a new one!We didn't buy an additional warranty and Amazon pretty much told us, \"Sorry, but there is nothing we can do about this.\"  It's out of warranty.  Amazon suggested we contact Samsung anyway, and that if we didn't get anywhere with their Customer Service people, to report back and let us know what they said.  Yes, we will call Samsung tomorrow, but I have a feeling their response will be much the same, \"So sorry.  It's out of warranty, so there's nothing we can offer.\"  If they do replace the set anyway or fix it at their cost, I will definitely report back and let you know!!  Not holding my breath though.So, if you decide that you want this mother of all TVs, be sure you get the extra warranty, because chances are great that you will need it!  If you're one of those people who replace their TV every year anyway, this one should (hopefully) last you a year.UPDATE Feb 12, 2012:  After three different technicians informed us that our TV was \"toast\" and that it would be too costly to repair (as warranty had recently expired), and before taking it to the trash, my husband decided to give Samsung a call.  He talked to several people and insisted that he be transferred to the top person in charge of customer relations.  After explaining what had happened and mentioning that I'd done some research and found a class-action suit against Samsung in California for their faulty boards, and that Samsung obviously knew that they were having problems with their boards, they finally agreed to fix ours free of charge (even though it was out of warranty).  Samsung handled our problem in an extremely professional and courteous fashion.  We just hung the repaired plasma back up on the wall and it's working again beautifully and the picture quality is perfect.  In light of this development and Samsung's great customer service, I've upgraded my rating to three stars.  It's a great TV, but it really should have lasted longer.  If my husband hadn't been so persistent, it would now be sitting in some \"Plasma TV Recycling\" bin somewhere.  I'm sure there are lots of customers who would have given up when told that since the TV is out a warranty, there's nothing that can be done.  Apparently, Samsung has redesigned its boards a couple of times since we bought our TV in September of 2010 and so hopefully the sets delivered today come with the newly redesigned, better boards and will last longer than ours did.

After reviewing the picture quality at best buy displays over a few months, I concluded that Samsung has far superior picture quality and color accuracy. Even the CNET review says that everything else is better in Samsung except black levels. A more accurate review is available on plasmatvbuyingguide.com. Anyways, here are a few other things that could help someone in making a choice:- My tv has a manufacturing date of January 2011 and has no buzzing whatsoever !! I bought it from onecall.- The tv is easy to unpack and install. If you are somewhat strong and just need to put the tv on a stand, you do not really need a second person. I did it myself with very little help from my wife. The carton has four tabs at the bottom (two on each side). If you pull the tabs out, the top portion of the box detaches itself from the bottom. Then all that is required is a bit of lifting. The stand is already installed so no worries there.- The TV looks more beautiful in my living room than it did in the store. I am in love with it.

Had a buddy over that bought the Panasonic from Best Buy (I guess he likes paying more for stuff?) and his comment was that he actually liked my picture better not to mention the slim design.I ended up buying the bundle deal with 4 Shrek 3d movies, 2 adult glasses and the blue ray player. The player is basic 3d and I don't mind because I use the new apple tv to stream netflix not to mention you can do it via the TV itself so upgrading the blu ray player would be a waste. There is talk about the software upgrade out there. It was a snap as I have the TV hard wired to my router.

I did hunt around on the web and found it for [...] but I was worried that I might get scammed since it was so much cheaper than most places. I received it and I have had NO problems with it at all. I have been researching large screen high def TVs for years wanting to replace my still great but VERY large 61\" Hitachi Widescreen 1080i first generation high def TV over 10 years old. Just wanted a smaller less obtrusive TV without sacrificing screen size. Once you go big, you can't go back. I am glad I waited long enough for 3D to be an option it. I was looking and comparing reviews between Panasonic VIERA models, Pioneer, and this unit. In the end I chose this unit due to the supposed ability to upconvert standard content to 3D. I figured why pay all this money for a 3D tv knowing that the volume of content available for 3d is so limited currently. But if you upconvert standard signals and get a decent 3d effect then it makes this lack of content less of an issue and the decision to go 3d more sensible. To be honest i wasn't expecting much from this upconversion when I got it even though the reviews were mostly positive but I was pleasantly surprised. The upconversion works. It is of course not nearly as awesome as the true 3d effect you get when watching material recorded to be native 3d but it does indeed work. Even commercials are 3d. The graphic overlays often pop out at you in the foreground while the images are in the background. Not cool enough to make me scan looking for all nigh infomercial channels, though lol. I watched Aliens in upconvert to 3d mode and it added depth and oddly enough even clarity? to many scenes in the movie. I was pretty impressed. I bought Grand Canyon IMAX 3D blu ray disc and played it on the Samsung BDC7000 3d blu ray player I got through Amazon and although the 3D was visible it was nothing earth shattering so I was at first a little bummed thinking that the 3D output of these TVs would not compare to what you see in the theatres. BUT.... then I had some friends over a week later and we put in a 3D movie disc that had 3 different movies on it. IMAX ocean scenes, mummies of Egypt, and Galapagos something or other (still havent watched that one yet). We decided to watch the ocean one first and HOLY COW!!!! I had ocean kelp tickling my nose! The see floor was so crazy seeing every little sea anemone waiving with depth of field and watching schools of fish swim by with fish popping out at you while others further away were slipping into the background. The colors, the depth, the motion had my eyes scanning all over the screen just feeding on it all like a kid in a candy store. The room was filled with \"oh hey look at that thing....and WOW check that out.... hey that's so COOL\" lol. It was like listening to a bunch of kids and we are all over 40. If you want to impress your friends and turn them into 3d converts buy this TV and that specific bluray 3d DVD. I know when my friends left they had screen envy because they asked when they could come back for the next showing, lol. I have it hooked to my Yamaha receiver with the TV speakers completely off so I muted the Yamaha and left the tv running for hours to see if I could hear any weird buzzing noise that I have seen people complain about but it is dead quiet. No buzzing at all, heck you wouldn't even know it was on if you weren't looking at the screen. The thinness of it is great too. The room I have it in is an older home when rooms weren't designed for home theatres and it is only about 20 feet across so by the time you put your chairs in it and set the tv on your tv stand you have about 12 to 15 feet of viewing distance between it and you. The old 61 Hitachi monster just crowded you and made the room seem like a sardine can. This new flat panel at less than 1.5 inches thick sitting on a tv stand opens the room up and it feels twice the size it did before even though its the same room. I play video games on it and LOVE watching movies too. The recommendation for gamers is to buy LCD and movie goers to buy Plasma. I have a 32\" LCD but was never all that impressed with the picture when watching TV so in the end since I watch more tv and movies than play games I chose this plasma unit. I expected my games to suffer but No Way they have NOT. I see no \"ghosting\" or \"articles\" but in certain scenes on Call of Duty Black Ops you see some pixelation during high motion action scenarios. You really have to focus on it though to see it and since you can't or you are dead, it's no issue. I would take this trade off all day long to have the beautiful picture with the rich colors and dark blacks of the movies I watch. This screen truly provides the movie experience I was looking for and I have no complaints at all. I have owned it for about 3 weeks and have tried to play games and watch movies as well as standard TV content equally to get through the \"burn in\" period recommended for plasma tvs that I have heard so much about to prevent ghost images, etc. I am past the 150 hours or so of viewing recommended and have never seen any even temporary ghost images appear that so many worry about. At one point I even had a static screen image that the Yamaha put up (photo of a wooded forest area) when you are on an input not connected to anything for several hours. When I remembered the whole screen burn issue, i freaked out and immediately turned the tv off so I could inspect it. then turned it on and went through channels till i found a music channel that the background was primarily white so I could stand a foot from the tv and stare at the white space trying to see if I could see the outlines of trees in the white that would denote the screen burn...but NOPE. Even after several hours of a static image, i had no ill effects even temporary. This gives me piece of mind that screen burn with this t.v. would really require almost a total act of idiocy or malicious intent to create. Accidental screen burn is obviously not likely so kudos to Samsung for rectifying that with new generation plasmas. Well, what else can I tell you at this point except BUY ONE. I am not a rep for Samsung nor a T.V. afficionado that casts around tech terms denoting minute differences between this and that, just a regular guy that loves movies and wants a great picture that this T.V. totally delivers. I did my homework to make sure I got the best deal on a tv that does what I wanted it to and this one won for the reason stated earlier and all the postive reviews read. I have not messed with tweaking the tv controls yet since the picture out of the box is simply awesome. Since I dont use the tv speakers I cant tell you much about them except they work. I havent used tv speakers in 15 years since I have always hooked it up to a receiver. I guess to sum it up I would say that it was [...] well spent and it took me years to have that much extra money to spend on something purley discretionary so to be this happy after dropping the dime means something. Final note...at or near 100 pounds you can move it yourself if your a beefy guy but even so it is weighted in such a way that makes brute force a dangerous operation for the tv and your back if you try to move it around on your own. I had a hard time on my own moving it to its final resting place atop my center channel speaker box so I recommend you have a friend to take one end so you can set it up easily as the weight is less of an issue than the awkward nature of such a large heavy square with no handles on it :)", "Date": "December 11, 2010"}, {"Title": "Very Impressive...", "Author": "Douglas", "ReviewID": "R3B8SPFV95564Y", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This was my first large Amazon purchase and I must say I was very leary about how this whole process would go with a major item like a 63\" Plasma TV.

I did try to see if they would match the Amazon deal and although the sales associate worked his tail off trying to get his manager to agree, in the end, the manager (who made me log onto Amazon and show him how to get the price quote I had in my hand) said they would not match that price or even reduce at all from their advertised price.  That gave me my first hint that this was a very good deal.So that  night I pushed the button and made the order. I was impressed with the level of information that Amazon provides as to shipping dates and arrival dates.  All the miscellaneous items (cables, 3D blueray player) arrived in about 4 days max.  The Plasma did not ship until about 3 days after the rest of the items shipped and it arrived in about 5 days after shipping.  The local delivery was done by \"homedirect USA\" here in the DFW area and it was exceptional.  They called two days before delivery to set up the 4 hour window for delivery.  They called exactly at the earliest time we had scheduled for the delivery and said they would arrive in 25 minutes.  They arrived, parked at the street, unloaded the set onto a rolling dolly cart. Carried the boxed set into my TV room where we inspected the packaging and it looked fine.  They unpacked it and asked me where I wanted it set (I was suprised) When it was set we inspected the set closely and it was perfect.  They plugged it in and it powered right up to the setup screen without a hitch. They told me to save my packing box until I am sure I don't want to send it back.  I have until January 31, 2011 to send it back for any reason, with Amazon paying the return shipping which is quite unbelievable to me.  I offered to buy lunch for the delivery guys  if they would carry my old 60\"LCD to my shop until Goodwill comes.  They  jumped at the chance and I paid them with Lunch cash and they were thrilled (as was I)So as far as the price, order process, shipping, delivery, and return process if I need it, it was all exceptional.  I was truely amazed.The setup was simpler than I thought it would be.  I have an 18 month old Bose Lifestyle 30 system that all my components run through so I was thinking this would not be fun to set up.  I got quotes for installation from the Big Box store of $279 to install it and another quote for $200 so I decided I would try it myself first.  I am glad I did.  My old TV did not have HDMI so this install with HDMI was a snap.  The only mistake I  made was ordering (4) 3 meter HDMI cables and yesterday realizing that my new 3D Blueray, PS3, and Directv box all needed short HDMI cables to go to the Bose and then I used one of the 3 meter HDMI cables to go from the Bose output to the HDMI with ARC plug on the Plasma. I also had installed a new TRENDnet 300N router which I located in my entertainment center and I ran a cable from the router to the TV to connect the internet without using a wireless connection.  Again I must say the HDMI highspeed ethernet cables make things so easy.  No big 3 or 5 wire Component cables to horse around and try to hide. So in an hour I was done with all the rewireing needed and ready to fire that baby up.When I turned on the set and cable box I was pleased to see the audio was working fine I just had to change the input to the HDMI that I was plugged into and BANG!! One spectacular picture.  I have to say I sat there for about 5 minutes in awe..I went through all the setup items and everything was so simple.  Didn't really need to set much other than the time up as everything was pretty much where you need it.  I went through all the menues just to see what was available.  The level of control of the picture was very impressive.  Not that I changed anything because I didn't.  During the day time our TV room is pretty sun lit so I changed the picture from normal to vivid and ended up changing it back as it was just too brilliant for even the sunlit room I was in.  So much for the criticism of Plasma being bad in high light environments.  This set will do just fine in higher light rooms with the vivid setting.The internet setup was fast and easy. I set it up to automatically detect and it tested out just fine.  I then had the set look for new fimware and it found newer fimware and it took about 11 minutes to download and install the new firmware.  If I don't use the internet for anything else the ability to download firmware updates makes it very worthwhile.  The rest of the internet services setup ran automatically in about 5 minutes setting up about 15 \"Apps\" very similar to the iPhone apps.  News, weather, facebook, yahoo, google maps, InternetTv etc, etc,.  There is a Samsun Apps page that shows what is available now. Nothing like the number available for iPhone but a nice start.  Netflix and Blockbuster both to download movies rather than wait for them to be sent to your mail box.We watched about 5 hours last night and both my wife and I are still in awe.  The 2D picture is so vivid it is hard to describe.  I ended up rewatching the last \"Transformers\" movie on HBO and between the BOSE sound (which I swear is better now using the HDMI) and the picture I was astounded. I can hardly wait for the arrival of my Starter Kit with 3d glasses to try out the 3D function. It was spectacular in the store when I demoed it.So far this set is all that is cracked up to be and I can find absolutely no faults.  As for the often mentioned \"buzzing\" I could not detect anything.  And believe me I was worried about this.  I even tried my best to detect any residual sound at even the lowest volume levels and I could not hear ANYTHING  but the soundtrack of the program I was watching.In summary:Amazon Experince:  5 STARSHome Delivery:  5 STARSWiring & Setup:  5 STARS2D Picture Quality:  5 STARS3D Picture Quality:  5 STARSSound Quality:  5 STARSComplete experience overall: 5 STARSYou will not be disappointed with this Samsung Plasma and the Amazon process.UPDATE on 3D performance:Another perfect performance by Amazon in that my 3D starter kit with Glasses arrived on December 21 which was the day before they were promised by Amazon.  The glasses were easy to use with a simple battery install and you are ready to go.Proper connections to get 3D programming was required.  Previously I had all my components (3D Blueray, DirecTV box, and PS3) plugged into my Bose Lifestyle V30 with Highspeed HDMI and then ran Highspeed HDMI output to the HDMI 2 with ARC port on the Samsung.  After reading several forums on the DirecTV and AV forum site I found that The Bose unit will not pass through 3D content and it appears that a lot of other AV components will not either.  The solution was simple. I ran HDMI directly from the DirecTV box, 3D Blueray player, to the HDMI inputs on the TV.  Specifically I ran DirecTV to HDMI 3 and Blueray to HDMI 4 and left the Bose audio plugged into the HDMI 2 with ARC.  I also then used optical cables to connect both the DirecTV and Blueray players to the Bose.  Everything then worked prefectly with all the 3D content from DirecTV as well as the 3D Blueray.  The only hiccup was that audio was being delivered from both the TV and the Bose and it created a funny echo effect.  The simple solution was to lower the volume on the Samsung to \"0\" and everyting was just fine.3D PICTURE QUALITY: Both my wife and I were astounded.  We watched several hours of \"Trailers\" on n3D on DirecTV and there were spectacular.  One underwater scene of an Octopus actually made my wife \"scream\" as the tenticle came right out of the TV to our noses...  I understand the technical theory behind it, but it still astounds me with how they can do that.  We also watched several regular 2D programs using the convert to 3D and after increasing the 3D effect a little It was a very nice imporvement to the 2D viewing. Not as vivid of 3D effect but still very apparant.  Overall the 3D content quality is exceptional and I continue to be very happy with my purchase and with the whole Amazon experience.", "Date": "December 10, 2010"}, {"Title": "Don't buy!", "Author": "Jonathan A.

I've owned Plasma TV's for the past 10 years (since they first came out).  I've had every size from 42\" up to a 71\" LG plasma which I still have in my bedroom.  I also own a couple of smaller LCD flat screen TV's.  Nothing I've seen so far can even compare to the phenemonal picture quality on the Samsung 63\" that I've owned now for about 3 weeks.  Stunning is the closest adjective I can think of.  Awe-inspiring.  Life-like.  The picture is like looking thru a window (when watching Hi Def content).  It takes my breath away, and everyone who has seen this TV is floored by the picture.I really haven't tried out the 3D feature very much, but it does work and is very cool.  It also has Netflix (and a few other internet streaming sources) built into it, so I now can stream Netflix movies directly to the TV, with amazing picture quality!  I know that others complain about the \"buzzing\" noise these sets produce.  I am a 45 year old male, and yes, I can hear a high-pitched sound coming from this set during quiet passages.  I notice this same \"noise\" from other brands of Plasma TV's, and I don't find it objectionable.  I personally think the picture quality is far better on Plasma TV's than on LCD's I've seen.  To summarize, I LOVE this TV, and wouldn't part with it.  If a little high-frequency buzzing noise is a big concern for you, maybe you should stick with an LCD/LED TV.

I upgraded from a Toshiba 62\" DLP unit that I had owned for about six years (Tired of buying lamps every 6 months).  I always liked the picture on the old TV, but it doesn't even come close to the quality of this Samsung.The form factor of the TV is terrific, less than 1.5\" thin and looks great mounted on the wall.  Motion is not a problem for this plasma; football, action movies, and other fast paced events look great with no blur or ghosting.I also like the fact that my Samsung 3D BD player and the TV are in sync, and that the TV will select the best settings for a given media through BD Wise.Calibrating the TV was reasonably easy, Samsung gives you a plethora of options related to white balance, colors, and cell brightness.  Achieving the perfect picture for the given environment wasn't difficult.As a bonus, I can control my TV via my iPhone with the new Samsung remote app.  The app controls most of the various functions of the TV, and has worked well for me so far, particularly when it comes to entering search keywords into one of the included internet connected apps.  The app selection so far is pretty good, I expect it will grow in time.  I like having the ability to use Yahoo widgets and search for YouTube videos directly on my TV and plan on utilizing the various on demand services soon (Hulu Plus, Amazon VOD, Netflix).Minor gripes I have...I do wish I could turn off the extra inputs so I would not have to go through the excess ones when selecting certain connections.  There may be a way to do this, I just have not been able to find the right method as of yet.

I love electronics and high tech toys and Ive owned many TVs in my lifetime and Ive never been as satisfied or excited to get home and turn on the tv as with this set. I am very happy I decided to go with the 8000 as opposed to the 7000 because I was looking at both and, due to the excessive glare in my living room, the 7000 would have been the wrong move. I looked at both side by side with the same movie playing and in dark rooms there is hardly any difference but when we shined a led flashlight on the 7000 you couldnt see the picture hardly at all. You couldnt even tell the flashlight was on with the 8000. The 2D picture is the best I've ever seen on any television anyware and everyone who sees it says the same. It seriously looks unreal. There are several different modes and settings on this tv as well. Many of them I do not use on a regular basis but you can set this thing up to your liking with a few hours  of tinkering around with the settings. I do frequently use the Game Mode feature on this tv. I play a lot of video games and the game mode gives you a big advantage in competitive play. Most new tvs have this feature and my last one did but it didnt impact my gameplay like this one. The 3D feature is amazing as well. Ive seen many 3D movies and this sets a new standard for 3D. I cant wait for more content to be released. I have about 7 video games and 3 3D Blu rays that work in stereoscopic 3D that will blow your mind. Im ordering a smaller set for my bedroom because im so happy with this purchase. A few things to watch for are:  Be Very Careful With This TV... It is very fragile. I ordered this TV originally online and had it shipped to me. When it arrived all looked good but I got it out of the box and packaging and the screen was cracked. If you tip it on its side IT WILL BREAK. The shipping company wasnt aware of this I guess. Also dont play video games or watch tv channels or movies with stationary HUD or menu displays for extended periods of time. This is a plasma tv and doing this can cause \"burn in\". I was playing Borderlands for several hours and the stationary in game HUD menu did cause minor burn in. It seems to be gradually going away but is slightly visible. You may also want to buy an addition 3d emitter because the signal generated by the tv is not that strong. It works well up to about 10-12 feet away. If someone or something is blocking it (the signal) it will not work. Finally buy the rechargeable glasses. Ive had two sets of the battery powered ones go bad on me. The rechargeable ones are more comfortable, function better, and dont require replaceable batteries. They seem to make the 3D picture look better also because the frame at the bottom of the lens goes all the way around.

Not the best, but one of the best. It has the best picture for the price. You have to spend more to get better (say Panasonic).-I was never a big fan of plasma TVs. I always thought the pictures were milky and creamy looking with too much green tinge.  This TV has none of those properties of the older plasmas.  The picture is bright, colorful and vibrant.-Some claim that the plasmas (Samsung, Pioneer, etc.) have better pictures than the LCD/LEDs.  I do not think that is completely true.  They do have deeper blacks (see my next item), and they don't have the fast motion issues.  They are usually a better deal for the money.  And, they probably have better 3D performance (although it will be interesting to see what the new Vizio is like that uses normal, cheap 3D glasses instead of the powered 3D glasses that cost $150 to $200). But, I stil like the vibrant colors and bright lighting in the LCD/LED TVs.-People rave about the black level on this TV, which is true.  But, I don't know why reveiwers think it is so important.  The problem is that the black level is so good, everything looks black.  You get a bunch of people in black suits at night and you can't distinquish anything.  In the default settings, it is hard to make out what is going on in a dark scene.  Of course, you can mess with the settings to fix this.-Glare and reflections...this was one of the most important things for me as I have it in a bright family room facing a kitchen with overhead lights.  You do get some reflections off of sunlit windows and overhead lights.  A flourscent light gives a light bluish color that is hard to notice.  Incadescent bulbs give kind of a rainbow affect.  -This TV is much better for glare than any of the LCD/LED TVs with glass screens and all current 3D LCD/LED TVs have glass screens (Vizio is coming out with a 65\" LED 3D TV, but I don't know if it is a matte screen like all of the other Vizios).  -This TV is much better for glare than most plasma TVs.  I have seen reports that the Panasonic and Pioneer (which they dont' make anymore) have less glare.  -The cheaper version of this TV, the PN63C7000, is supposed to be a little better with reflections and glare thatn the PN63C8000.  I think that is because the PN63C7000 does not have as good of black levels and does not correct as well for colors in a brightly lit room.  So, you give up a little in the picture to get less glare and reflection.  -The best for glare and reflections are the LCD/LED TVs with matte screens.  You can tell if an LCD/LED TV has a matte screen as the screen is sunken into the bezel, while TVs with glass screens are flat all the way across. There are very few LCD/LED TVs over 60\" with matte screens.  There is the Sony 2D (the 3D has a glass screen), the older Sharp TVs (I think the newer ones, with much better pictures have glass screens) and Nuvision, which costs $10,000.-This TV has Internet connectivity and is WiFi \"ready\".  This is a waste:  -It is WiFi \"ready\" which means you have to buy a WiFi dongal for about $80 in order to use the WiFi.  And it has to be a Samsung dongal.  You can't use one of those old external WiFi USB adapters that you may have lying around.  -Many Blueray DVD players, for as low as $120, have the Internet connectivity, so why do you also need it on a TV.  -Most Blueray DVD players with internet connectiviy have built in WiFi that don't require an extra external dongal.  That means for about $120 to $180, you can get a Blueray player with WiFi compared to having to pay $80 just to get the WiFi dongal.  -This TV is usually sold in a bundle that includes a built in WiFi internet Blueray player.-You do not need to buy expensive HDMI cables.  All you need is a cable that supports 10.2 Gbps.  Most cables do that (but will say so on the package).-Sound system sucks (well doesn't quite suck, but isn't great).  But, you would expect anyone who buys a 63\" TV would also have a separate home theater audio system.-Most older receivers will not pass the 3D signal, so you can't run your 3D Blueray player through it.  To explain:  If you have a high end surround sound system, you will have a receiver/amplifier.  It will have HDMI inputs and an HDMI output for your TV.  You can plug all your equipment into the receiver and plug the receiver into the TV.  But, if you plug your 3D Blueray player into the receiver, the 3D will not work.  I have a 5 year old Pioneer Elite receiver, and it does not work.  So, you need to connect the Blueray player directly to the TV.  But, then how do you get the audio to your receiver?  Well, you can use an audio optical cable, but that does not pass the newer Dolby and DTS signals.  Optical audio does not have as high of a bandwidth as the audio componenet of the HDMI cable.  So, if you have an older receiver, what you really need is a Blueray player with 2 HDMI outputs like the Samsung 7900.-The Samsung TV and Blueray players have an annoying \"Anynet\" feature.  If you have TV on and are watching something, and turn on the power to the Blueray player, the TV input automatically switches to HDMI 2 input.  So, you probaly want to plug your Blueray player into HDMI 2 input on the TV.  It doesn't warn you about this in the manual.  If you switch your TV back to the HDMI 1 input, the Blueray player becomes partially disabled.  If you are watching a cable box through HDMI 1, you turn on the Blueray player, the TV swicthes to HDMI 2 and then when you shut off the Blueray player, the TV switches to the TV antenna input (not back to HDMI 1).  There is probably a way to defeat this whole thing, but I haven't figured it out yet.-This TV has a nice swivel stand (most other brands do not).  This good for slightly turing the screen for glare issues.-The remote control sucks.  It does not have raised buttons and is very hard to use.  You have to look at the face of the remote control before pushing anything, or you push the wrong buttons.  The PN63C7000 remote is fine.NEW ITEM:  The remote is not universal.  It can only control other Samsung devices.  This is shocking for a $3000 TV.-Some people reported a buzzing noise around the bezel.  My TV does not have it, and the TV in stores do not.  This is probably something that got fixed on later models after complaints from the earlier buyers.UPDATE:  About 3 weeks after buying the TV, my developed the buzz.  I can't hear it from far away or when I when I have the TV on at normal volume.  But if you are close and playing the TV at low volumes you will notice a buzz.-I had a 63\" 4:3 TV.  Watching widescreen pictures, that is equivelant to a 55\" 16:9 aspect ratio.  The height of the screen is about 32\", while the 63\" 4:3 had a picture height of 36\".-I am writing this in January.  This model year is coming to a close and the new models will be out sometime in late winter/early spring.  Now is the time to look for good deals and good bundles.  You may be able to negotiate.  But, if you see a good deal, you might want to snap it up.  You don't know if they will run out of TVs.-Should you wait for next year's model?  I don't know.  From what I heard, the only upgrade next year will be built in WiFi.  Don't know if any of that is true.NEW ITEM:  The signal from the TV to the 3D glasses is IR (to work, you must have a straight shot from the TV to the glasses and you can't have anything in the way).  Rumor has it that the new models will use Blue Tooth so you don't have to worry about obstacles.  This would be a stupid upgrade.  To watch 3D you have to sit directly in front of the TV anyway, so obstacles are not an issue.  Blue Tooth buys you nothing and there are always the problems of interference from other sources.", "Date": "January 23, 2011"}, {"Title": "Motion Jitter option should be set to off.", "Author": "Terry Nagy", "ReviewID": "R32DV03YJZBDMP", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Bought this item on 1-1-11, and once delivered with the 3D Blu-ray player with WiFi, I had to try it out.  I put in a Blu-ray video of the Steelers Superbowl 43 championship run, and right out of the gate I noticed what appeared to be blurry pixelation around the outer edge of the main people on camera when there was a lot of back ground parallaxing happening.  I called Samsung tech support, and they told me to turn off the Motion Jitter/Jutter to off.  Unfortunately that didn't resolve the issue, so they sent a tech out to fix it.  When the tech came to the house he said that the entire panel would have to be replaced.  I told him that I would rather do an exchange with the retailer.  Well when the new unit came in (today) 1-24-11, same thing, right out of the box, however, when I turned off the Motion Jitter the problem was fixed.  Frustrating to have a brand new unit broken right out of the box even if it was a menu option item (first unit).  Also frustrating for Samsung to think that their Motion Jitter is a good option and the default is set to on.  Over all picture with the motion blur gone is excellent with all sources now.  3D...well not a huge fan of it since only certain sections of a movie are in 3D, unlike the 3D world we live in, so for me watching a movie in \"not all 3D\" isn't enjoyable, not to mention wearing the glasses the whole time, and if you have more people watching having to buy glasses for them blows too.I've read a lot of complaints about speaker buzz.  Well I've had two of these units, and there simply isn't any buzz. In fact I hear more ringing in my ears than buzz from the TV, which should indicate that there is no buzz. I use the built in speakers to watch late night TV since it is perfect for not waking the whole house up with a THX sound system being on.  For movies, I simply run an optical line to the receiver and boom the movie sound is loud and proud.The only two complaints I have is:1). The fact that multiple remotes is required.  I got a Samsung 3D Blu-ray player with the TV, and still there are options on the BD units remote that are not on the TV remote that are needed for internet browsing/streaming, not to mention DirecTV. :(2). Automatic switching of sources doesn't happen for all devices.  This is frustrating, and also ties in with my #1 complaint.

I knew that but the adapter they offer to sell you is a must to enjoy this tv to it's fullest.Local cable company doesn't support 3d yet.Also, the tv comes with an owners manual and gives info on each of it's details but doesn't suggest the best choices for the best appearance.For example, if it reads the cell light ranges from a to z .I see that but what is the best option from a to z... F? x? a? hmm all the features same way.I hope this makes sence.It gave me options but I am not a computer programmer and I don't know  what's best,so I have just been experimenting here and there.Finally do not buy a 3d blue ray player that is not the same brand as your tv...very bad ideal..I don't care what anybody says,don't do it!Lots of lots of stuff to enjoy.The 3d viewing is nothing but awesome! and the high definition definetly keeps your attention,the array of vivid colors and no issues with light in the room or not,maybe a 1 percent difference??It works for me.Just make sure you check it when they deliver it ,take it out of that big box and all before the delivery guy leaves because I would be shocked to find something wrong with this tv unless something happened during the transport.Buy what is suggested and it all will be a no brainer.Thanks for reading. xoxo", "Date": "January 8, 2011"}, {"Title": "Exceptional Picture Quality With 3D As An Added Bonus", "Author": "Anthony Caoyonan", "ReviewID": "R3BMM6EOKOCR5A", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "If you're looking for great picture quality, value and aesthetic looks, this is the tv to buy.

This effect looks great on Pixar films.  It also has picture-in-picture, in which the Pannies do not.  As far as price, this Samsung is actually hundreds of dollars cheaper than the Pannies of similar features and size.As far buzzing, I didn't notice any.

The picture is crisp and beautiful, and I have it wall mounted in my living room.It's very stylish and is the focal point of the room.  In terms of 3D performance, it looks like a solid performer. I did notice some ghosting in certain scenes, but most of the time the 3d imagery looked very good. I'm not sure if there can be adjustments made to correct this (as of yet, the TV has not been calibrated by a professional).I noticed that a major complaint from owners of this TV was a buzzing sound that was ruining the home theater experience for them. I have personally not encountered this problem, as the set seems fairly quiet.I compared this television to the 65 inch Panasonic 3D Plasma, but decided to go with the Samsung due to it's more economical pricetag, and also because I didn't notice a drastic performance difference between the two sets to warrant spending the $1,000 more.Also, since I wanted a close wall mount, the Samsung was the better choice at just an inch and a half thick.  The Panasonic was about twice as thick, and decidedly less sexy in the looks department.If you're looking for an entry level 3D plasma that performs well on all fronts, I would suggest going with this model.  Keep in mind that if 3D is something you want to partake in, the bigger the television screen, the better.I see people purchasing 45 inch 3D sets, and that doesn't make too much sense to me.  You would nearly need to snuggle up with your set to benefit from the 3D effect.  For this set the optimal viewing distance for 3D is said to be between 8-11 feet.  I'm sitting about 10 feet away, and the effect is about right. With a smaller set, you are fairly limited with distance.As a 2D performer, this is one of the best televisions out there, bar none.  I have Directv, and the 3D content is pretty weak at the moment. Hopefully it will pick up, but even then, the real beauty in this set is what it does in 2D.

While I agree with the vast majority of positive reviews about the television itself, it is clear to me that there is a problem with the new Internet capability on many Samsung televisions.  If you've focused on this or other Samsung televisions because of their ability to download Internet content, please know that there is a big problem with this feature for many consumers.  In many cases, the TV is unable to access the Internet as it should via both wired and wireless connections.  Most of the time I get a \"Gateway PING\" error message that neither Samsung or Cox Cable is able to rectify.  When the TV does log on to our home Network, download speeds are painfully slow and quickly cause the system to crash.  If you Google \"Samsung Gateway PING error\"  you can see a more detailed description of the problem.  This technology is clearly not ready for prime time.  Samsung 'Level 2' techs were poorly equipped to assist and it seems obvious they haven't rectified the issue yet.  Cox TV techs want nothing to do with the issue and say that they are seeing this problem on these 'new sets'.In hindsight, I wish I'd ordered the Samsung non-Internet ready model (for 1k less) without 3D, which has very limited programming.  In short, great TV with poorly designed/executed software add ons.Update 12/5/10I've spoken further with Samsung 'Level 2' techs who say they are aware of the problem but have no fix.  The local tech subcontracted by Samsung to repair the problem never showed and I've had no follow up from Samsung.

Galdi", "ReviewID": "R9X515X7P64E4", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "UPDATE: While this TV is still fantastic, Samsung introduced the PN64D8000 and D7000 at CES this month. It decreases the bezel width and in doing so adds an extra inch to the screen size. Many of the picture quality features are the same, however it was noted that the buzzing has been improved as well as the 3D processing. They have also now switched to bluetooth 3D glasses and a more feature rich online app server. The main difference between the D7000 and the D8000 is a full web browser and a touch screen remote on the D8000. This means that if those features aren't important to you, then you can opt for the D7000 and save some money.When I set about making my TV purchase I had to factor in all the different options and requirements. It definitely had to have 1080p which is pretty much a given these days, and I wanted it to be future proof enough to not be out of date after at least a few years. Also I wanted it to be BIG! The last category limits the options quite a bit. There aren't many flat panels above 60 and that's where there were some big differentiations that led me to the Samsung plasma. Pretty much all of the tvs in this size came with 3D, I don't really care about 3D but if it's gonna be on my TV I at least want it to work well.... the plasma is much better for 3D than LCD because it's refresh rate is so much higher that there's less cross-talk in the image (that annoying 2-image appearance that makes you think your'e drunk). Also, for the size the price of LCDs were much higher than the plasma, and most didn't produce as deep of blacks as the plasma. Most of the new LED blacklights are now edge lit which means they don't have the benefits of local dimming as the rear-LED lit tvs do so the contrast wasn't as high. So after all these factors it was definitely decided plasma was the way to go, and Samsung was it!And am I happy I decided so. I LOVE this TV!! the picture is fantastic, the interface and menu options and nice and deep giving good options for adjustment. The internet apps are a nice addition (especially for streaming netflix) and the 3D is actually pretty cool! (make sure to take advantage of the promotion for free 3D glasses and bluray player!). As for what some people have said about lack of inputs.. i found the opposite (although i did end up using a receiver anyway). This thing has more hdmi ports than I'd know what to do with, and HDMI cables are so cheap online (NEVER BUY AN HDMI CABLE IN THE STORE!!) that why anyone wouldn't use hdmi is beyond me.There is a slight humming noise and apparently this is typical of all plasmas, I'm pretty sensitive to high-pitched noises and it doesn't really bother me that much. With no sound it's noticeable but not that annoying and with sound you can't hear it at all.Overall it's a FANTASTIC TV that I would recommend to anyone (in fact I just had my mom replace her old TV with one).

Beautiful picture and good sound.  I WAS happy with it.Just before the picture went black I heard a \"click\" sound and pop - no picture.  I called Samsung tech support and the guy I talked to told me to unplug the TV, wait 30 seconds, and plug it back in.  Tried it - didn't work.Samsung set up a local repair shop to fix it.  I received a phone call from the repair shop and the guy scheduled a next day visit.  He told me that I would need to have the TV go to the shop.  I was not ready to hear this.  The shop kept insisting up until the repair guy got here.  I told him the TV isn't going anywhere.  I didn't want it laying in some corner forgotten about.  After all the TV was over $3000.00 and it's only 3 months old.The shop finally agreed to making however many trips it might take to repair the TV.  Seems the TV has 5 boards inside and Samsung will only ship one board at a time.  At first they thought it was the power board or whatever it's called.  They came back a couple days later with a replacement - that wasn't the problem.  They also had 2 other boards (the repair guy said they got lucky and Samsung sent 3 parts.  Of course, those two boards weren't the problem either.So he said next they will get another board and if that doesn't fix it, one more board.  He told me he didn't think the other 2 boards will fix it either but they have to go through this process.  He told me thinks it's the flat panel (the screen) itself that's no good.  I was in disbelief.  If that turns out to be the case, then just about every part has been replaced.I asked him why would this happen to a relatively new TV since I've never had a TV go bad this quickly - in fact quite the opposite as most TV's have lasted me many years.  He told me they make these newer plasmas and LCDs/LEDs so cheaply they are not made to last long.  They work great for a short time and then the buyer is out of luck after the warranty is up.If I knew this I would never have bought this TV.  I'm currently using a small Toshiba (20 inches) I've had for 7 years.  I bought a bunch of Christmas blu-rays to watch for the holidays but honestly the Toshiba is too small to enjoy watching anything.I cannot recommend this TV to anyone.  And from what I was told, I don't think I'd trust any other brand of this type either.  These TVs are new technology so they haven't been around long enough to test their durability.Over $3000.00 for a TV that lasted 3 months is what it comes down to.  And that's just the cost of the TV.  Figure in a 3-D blu-ray player, a 1.4 HDMI receiver, 1.4 HDMI cables, and 3-D blu-ray movies and it's closer to $5000.00.Even with an extended warranty the time you're without the TV for repairs makes this a very bad purchase.---------------------------------------------------------------------------UPDATE: (February 4, 2011)Samsung was SUPPOSED to ship a replacement TV of same model over a month ago.  They didn't.  They said they forgot to order it.So, about 2 weeks or more ago, they \"said\" they would refund me the purchase price.  I e-mailed them the invoice from Amazon.  They received it and I was contacted by a lady by the name of Trisha (X 5613) who told me the refund was approved and I should have a check in 2 weeks.  It was odd that she never mentioned anything about having the original TV picked up (it's been sitting in the middle of my living room since before Christmas).Today I called Samsung 4 times.  I spoke Juliana (X 5610), Wendy (800-Samsung) and on the phone presently with someone else.  The original person who approved the refund (Trisha) would not call me back after I've tried calling her every other day for the last week.  Someone did call me back and left a message that was mostly impossible to make out clearly what she was saying.  But I did hear her say my refund was refused.  This is why I'm on the phone once again with Samsung.I've been lied to over and over again by Samsung and I have become extremely wary of any promises they make.  And from what the lady I'm currently talking to has told me is that refund was rejected but it could be because whoever filled out the forms had misspelled some words or numbers.  I was told to call back next Wednesday or Thursday to find out the the status as the refund had to be resubmitted today.So I will update this once again next week and if this is prolonged even further (which I think it will be) I'll continue to update for anyone even considering purchasing a TV by Samsung.", "Date": "December 17, 2010"}, {"Title": "WARNING: DO NOT BUY THIS TV - WILL DIE in 1 to 3 MONTHS", "Author": "Classic Films on Blu-ray \"Hi-Def Enthusiast\"", "ReviewID": "R3J4L5X56VDG3D", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I bought this TV at my local BestBuy and it lasted for just over a month and then the plasma picture display died.

According to Best Buy this TV has been problematic with every one sold being returned to them.  So the problem is across the board.  The real problem comes in if the TV decides to die after the first 30 days as Best Buy will not refund you.  You will have to go through the \"repair process\" where they send a \"repairman\"(?) to fix your tv.  Good luck with that!  These \"repairmen\" don't seem to know what they are doing.  Anywho, after replacing every circuit board in the TV, it's still dead.  So what's next I have no clue.  All I know is I got ripped off buying this TV.  Never again will I buy a tv made by Samsung and never again will I trust a plasma display by any manufacturer.  Everyone's told me to spend the extra it will cost to get an LED LCD as they are supposed to last at least a couple of years.Honestly even with that, I don't feel it's a good investment to spend $4000 to $5000 on a 2 year working TV.  I've heard so much good things about DLP's by Mitsubishi.  The picture quality may not be as good as an LED-LCD tv but I've heard they last a real long time with only requiring a replacement bulb every 1 to 2 years ($100 or less for a bulb).  So I think the next TV I get will be a DLP by Mitsubishi.  Even then I'm going to do a lot of research first and I won't be one of those who is one of the first buyers.

I enjoy the tv very much except I sometimes notice wavy lines around people or objects when they move across the screen. I don't know much about the new tv technology so I can't say if it's because of the tv, the blu ray player or maybe it's on the actual blu ray discs. I tried the different judder settings but it made no difference...not even sure what the judder settings are for as I haven't read thru the manual yet. It bothered me alot for awhile but not as much anymore because once you accept a flaw you can relax more and enjoy the otherwise great picture. Anyway, I enjoy watching blu ray movies on this big screen tv and also enjoy watching tv shows in hd. Although the hd tv picture isn't as good as blu ray it's still great. I usually just watch the tv in bed at night before I fall asleep. It kind of feels like I've got my comfy bed in a movie theatre. Also the 3 wake up timer settings are great as well. I have all 3 set so I'm sure to wake up in time. If I had the tv a year ago the wake up timer settings would have paid for the tv by now, since I often couldn't wake up in time to get downstairs intime to start trading stocks when the market opened so I lost a lot of money because of it. I tried the clock radio but even putting it across the room so I had to get up to turn it off couldn't keep me up as I was often very tired from only getting a few hours sleep for days at a time. Now I have the tv turn on 3 times between 6 am and 6:20 am to wake me up and I set it to a high brightness and there is a setting to have the volume at whatever level you like. Regarding brightness, another feature I like is the picture can be set differently for when watching a blu ray movie or from the cable pvr box or from the built in tv tuner. So even though the tv comes on bright to wake me up, the picture settings for watching a blu ray movie are not affected, which for me is a nice convenient feature so I don't have to change the picture settings when I watch a blu ray movie or when watching shows from the pvr box. While on the subject, at first I was actually dissapointed in the tv because I found it too bright to watch but now that I have the brightness, contrast and colour turned down a lot I find it a lot nicer and easy on the eyes. I guess that might be because I watch it it a dark or dimly lit room. Also at first when I watched the 3d monsters and aliens movie I thought it was enjoyable but nothing great...however when my sister came over and watched it she liked the 3d alot and I guess her enthusiasm kind of rubbed off on me so I guess I'll get a few more 3d movies. Also I'm probably going to buy a lot more blu ray movies as I'd like to watch even some of the older movies on blu ray like for example north by northwest is an old favorite I'd like to see on the \"big screen\". Before I had the tv I'd feel kind of depressed a bit near the end of the day, since another day was over and there was nothing left to do but get into bed and try to fall asleep.
