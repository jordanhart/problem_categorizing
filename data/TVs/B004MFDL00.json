Shaffer", "ReviewID": "R1L2WY1UD6N6B8", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Bought this TV for use in the bedroom for Netflix streaming only (don't actually have it hooked up to cable).  So far it has met my expectations and works great.  My house is wired with Cat6 Ethernet, so I literally had to plug the power cord and a network cable into the wall outlets and I was good to go.Netflix setup was a breeze, was watching movies within a few minutes of first turning the TV on.  The built-in Netflix app seems to have everything you would want (I could pick up right where I left off on a movie I had been watching on my tablet).I only noticed a few glitches in the streaming and only once did it display a \"rebuffering\" screen.  No complaints about the picture quality of the TV at all (I knew this wasn't going to be a fantastic 1080p 120Hz experience, but given what I'm using it for, there was no need to spend another $500 or more for that).Overall, I'm very very happy with my purchase.  Amazon had it shipped to me for free within 2 days, certainly can't complain about that!", "Date": "November 17, 2011"}, {"Title": "Pass", "Author": "R. E.

But the Audio is horrible.  The net applications are minimal, no browser.  Netflix items take an inordinate time to load, but I have not tried it with the Set hardwired, that may make a big difference.  The DLNA streaming works well, much better than my hardwired Samsung.But as for the low rating; this is the forth LCD TV of approximately this size that I have owned, one other Toshiba, an Akai, and a Samsung.  The audio in the others is fine, even in the other Toshiba.  The sound seems to becoming out of a tin can with this one.  Even after manipulating all the settings, something I have much experience with, it got no better.  And quite often the sound crackles during transitions in audio level. Rather than return the TV I purchased a sound bar.  The sound is so bad I wonder if I received a defective set.", "Date": "November 25, 2011"}, {"Title": "Broken Already", "Author": "Anon", "ReviewID": "R3JTBSPAK5IY39", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "This TV only worked for a month and then just refused to turn on!

I have scanned for the available channels on my Comcast cable and I have set the TV networking up for a wireless connection. I plan on running a hardwired ethernet connection within the week.Inside the box - TV & stand, 2AA batteries, a few adverts for internet video companies & a ridiculous simplistic manual.Set up is very easy. The TV prompts you to scan for channels 1st thing. The TV did find every channel that I am aware of on my cable system, both SD & HD. Next, I choose to remove all SD channels. In my manual, it does not explain how to do this. I figured it out by playing in the menu. Under the setup menu, you have to select manual program, then you check the channels that you do NOT want. I really do not understand what that little thingie above the checkspot means. It looks like a little period with a curving arrow over the top of it. Must be a Japanese symbol. Anyways, click & forget it.Next I set up my wireless connection. I used all 3 options to set up the TV. The one I preferred is the assisted scan. It detects my wireless network & I only had to input my login security key. The TV connected with b/g compatibility instead of using n. Netflix looked great; I have not tried an other internet services yet.After all that, the TV prompted me to update its firmware. I did it wirelessly and noticed no problems. It only took a few minutes to complete.Picture quality leaves some things to be desired. I have not had time to set the parameters to my liking so it may improve.One glaring omission on the TV is the lack of a clock. Since this TV is really just one big flat computer, that is unacceptable. I am debating sending the TV back for just that reason. I would prefer Toshiba write it into firmware on the next update but I may not wait to see if that happens.I did test the DLNA video streaming. Like most other electronics that have the ability, it is a joke. I have several different shares across multiple windows 7 pcs and the TV could not see any of them. I checked some of my network media players and they saw the shares just fine. DLNA is not reliable so do not depend on this TV as your player. I plan on attaching a network media player to the TV so this does not affect my opinion of the TV.I may or may not update this review after I get the TV hardwired into my gigabit network. If my opinion changes considerably, I will update it.------2nd impressionsThe remote is cluttered with too many buttons. I do not really know what they are all for. Toshiba could have programmed multiple functions into the buttons depending on what area of the TV you were in.My dvd player is a Toshiba and it has a conflicting button with the TV. The TV remote button Channel Return conflicts with the Play button on the dvd player remote. This is aggravating and probably enough to return the TV for. IF Toshiba is reading the reviews, please update the firmware and change the code for that one button.The HDMI connections are extremely sensitive. If is does not like a hdmi wire, the picture will blink every few seconds. I used several different cables and it will only accept a few. I know that all of the cables are good too, I use them on other HD tvs.One other aggravating thing about the TV is that it forgets the network password occasionally. While I do intend on using a hardwired connection, this makes me wonder.", "Date": "October 20, 2011"}, {"Title": "Excellent all-rounder TV", "Author": "DrAmar", "ReviewID": "R23IMEPEONB2XP", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I purchased this TV for $330 on Amazon and it was promptly shipped in 2 days flat for free!Pros :1) Amazing Picture Clarity - LED definitely better than just LCD2) Superb Remote - The best I had so far.

It randomly powers off and on, becomes unresponsive, etc. when it is connected to the WiFi.  I have tried it on several wireless routers and modems, as well as with nothing else on the network.  I have also tried it in multiple other homes.Toshiba has sent techs to my home 4 times.  4 times I have been asked to take time off work to meet a tech.  The nearest tech to me comes from 100 miles away and Toshiba pays them mileage and wages to come \"fix\" the tv.  Each time has failed to resolve the issue, and I can confirm, without a doubt, that the WiFi is the issue.Toshiba is now refusing product replacement, instead wanting to replace the power/main boards, AGAIN.  They are doing this because now if it solves the problem for 30 days, the warranty is up.  I cannot believe that they would not just replace the TV instead of investing thousands into it - it only cost $380 NEW.I haven't been able to use the TV's smart features since October (it is not Feb.), and most of that time was spent figuring out what was wrong with it - no thanks to the techs or customer support.

I've had the TV for a few weeks and I'm very happy with it so far.Pros:-The picture is very good in my opinion.-The TV is extremely thin and has an attractive form factor. It would be great for wall mounting although I haven't done this.-The wifi connection is great and the integrated Netflix works very well; I have yet to try the other internet features. The remote has a Netflix button that sends you directly to Netflix.  Very user friendly. Also, while this isn't a Netflix review, I just renewed my account after a few years and it seems like the online content has increased dramatically and is a great value for $8/month.-The TV has plenty of HDMI connections.-The TV is a great value at the price I paid ($369 on Amazon in December of 2011).Cons:-The sound quality is poor; however, after reading a lot of reviews of LED TVs I think this is par for the course. With the TVs being so thin, there just isn't room for large speakers. I use the TV in a bedroom and the sound is adequate but it could be an issue for a larger room.-The wifi connection takes a few minutes to connect; if you start Netflix immediately after turning the TV on, it will give you an error saying there is no connection.  I've learned that this is just due to a delay in establishing a wifi connection.-The TV doesn't currently offer access to Amazon's online videos (sorry Amazon). In theory, this could be changed via a software update but who knows when or if this will come.
