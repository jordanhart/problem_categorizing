{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Excellent LCD with overall ease of use", "Author": "M. Moreno \"IpodL\"", "ReviewID": "R29HHS52PR3MAG", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I bought this TV in June 2008 and have found it to be an absolutely great buy. I bought my at RC Willey. Yes, I read the CNET review and the reviewer marked down the TV because of the dark shades changing. I looked at this in the store for several minutes and have lived with it for a month and have not noticed that problem at ALL! Personally I think they guy shot down the SONY because Samsung is running TV advertisements on CNET. This is a super sharp TV with excellent colors and deep deep blacks. This TV is much better than the old 2007 W. Here is why I bought this TV...It is super clear in digital broadcast and does a much better job in Analog/420p SD (old) transmitions than any other TV I have seen (no jaggies..thanks to Sony noise reduction/DSP). Sony knows Bluray- they invented it, they know what skin tones should look like like (they own a movie studio), thier menus are really easy/simple to use (vs. Samsung 650), it has a built in TV guide (You can get rid of that Monthly cable box fee) and it has future expansion capability. On pure picture quality vs. Samsung 650: * Picture: It is pretty darn close in digital broadcast. I looked at both side by side. Samsung has a slight edge on clarity in analog broadcast. Samsungs have more glare, Sony is a matte screen but blacks on samsung are pretty darn good because of the glossy screen. When viewing a BluRay DVD though, the Sony slightly more details. No fade from bright to black issues on sony as noted by CNET (he must have had a protype system). Colors are nice a bright and bravia 2 engine is even better than XBR4 or near it. I have heard the Z series may be better but they don't make it in 52'' yet. * Menus: Samsungs menus are made for Engineers (lots of tweeks, but really confusing for average user).  If you doubt it, download the user manual to the A650 and KDL524100 and see for yourself. If you and your family are highly technical, go for the Samsung. If you don't want to fiddle (aka get lost in menus), but get an excellent picture, go with the Sony. Sony's are really simple and easy to use, plus it automatically find digital channels and is somehow able to display all the channel icons (it is like I have a built in cable box).* Features: The Sony may not have the Ethernet and built in weather/news of the 650 Samsung, but it does have the built in TV guide and future expansion. Realistically, if you want Internet in your TV, you are better off connecting an external device (Playstation, Apple TV, etc). The TV guide feature in the sony is great and the Bravia Sync is a big plus (especially when you use a Sony DVD upconverter 1080p (nice one at costco)- why?...TV remote controls it all. Sony Picture n' Picture is nice as well allowing you to view pictures/video from HDMI while at the same time viewing cable TV (regardless if it is SD or HD signal)* Asthetics: My favorite feature on the sony is that the power buttons on on the top of the TV... helps with preventing kids from turning tV on/off. I believe Samsungs are too low. I personally didn't like the Red on the Samsung and the glossy screen.  The remote on the Sony is really easy to find/use vs. the Samsung. But the Samsung's remote lit up at night...which the Sony's does not.Bottom line: if you are a videophile and your family (wife) can deal with the techno menus (plus you want to upgrade the firmware to fix the Samsung A650 on/off bug), get the Samsung. If you want the a super clear  Picture (videophile made easy), easiest to use LCD with features that make every day TV viewing smooth and easy... The sony is excellent- Plus it is future expandible.Recommended Evaluation settings: Picture mode custom, backlight 7, Picture 95, Brightness 45, Color 50, Hue 0, Color temp Neutral, Sharpness 4, Noise Red. off, MPEG Noise red. off, Advanced settings-> Black corrector: med, Advance C.E Med, Gamma off, clear white low.", "Date": "July 1, 2008"}, {"Title": "Best 52\" LCD HD-TV for the money", "Author": "Ali S. \"review_monster\"", "ReviewID": "R3DMW06IXKYCGF", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I did a lot of research when I decided to buy a 52\" TV. I'm a student and a part-time salesman at a fortune 100 company in consumer electronics. After weeks or perhaps months of preparation and research I narrowed down my options to the Samsung A750 and the Sony bravia w4100. Now I did have a Samsung A550 and a Sony Trinitron High Def CRT at home and they were both pretty impressive but I figured that Sony does a better job in 52\" or larger category after observing the w4100 and a750 for several days at work.First off lets talk about the screen. The 50'000:1 contrast of the Samsung vs. 30'000:1 contrast ratio of the Sony. The way Samsung measures its contrast ratio is radically different from Sony, that is why Samsung never discloses its \"TRUE CONTRAST RATIO\", but Sony does. In this case sony's true contrast is 3,000:1. Whatever the true contrast ratio of Samsung, it is not superior to that of Sony's. This is something that most experts  agree on. It is easy to blast your dynamic contrast ratio but not your true contrast. Some claim that the Samsung produces deeper blacks but my answer is that this is due to Samsung's glossy mirrored screen and it has nothing to do with performance. The mate screen of sony absorbse white light coming from backlight or any ambient lighting from the room. This causes the blacks not to appear as deep or fake as the samsungs. Plus, Samsung manufactures all of Sony LCD screens so in terms of screen capability they are equal. If you have a bright  room go for the sony, the screen is slightly brighter and not reflective like the Samy. The backlight for Sony seems to work brighter but its not as evenly distributed as the Samy, this is clear in the dark.Second factor I checked for was the TV engine. We have the Samsung's Dnie Pro vs. Bravia 2. Well there is no question that bravia 2 is the clear winner here, being utilized by Sony XBR6 and XBR7 which go for about $4000 dollars while the Samsung's DNIE pro is built to compete with the lower end Sony Bravia Engine Pro. Sony's Standard TV quality is excellent and the Samy is just as good but i noticed that Sony's colour was more natural ie. colour of grass in baseball. Also sony covers  over %90 of colour Gamut while Samsung covers only %70, this maybe why skin tones and greens look more natural on the Sony.Next up was refresh rate and here both run at 120 Hz and here Sony has dramatically improved over the XBR4 series in motionflow. Samsung also does really well in 120 Hz category so I say they are both a tie here.Sound is another important factor for my decision, i blasted the 7 series at work and noticed poor sound quality in extreme volumes while the Sony better retained its quality. However the Samsung was capable of delivering deeper Bass probably due to its built in Subwoofer. Sony allows you to adjust voice volume and enable steady sound to prevent commercials from freaking you out in the middle of your favourite tv shows. But be aware this may cause low volume in sudden loud scenes in movies.Finally last thing I looked for was design. Samsung 7 series looks fabulous with its glass like frame and a touch of red, but that is the problem for me, \"red\". I don't fancy a red TV and I think it's one of those fashion trends that would soon be \"old fashioned\". Sony however retains a more masculin design with fine glossy black frame and metal speakers at the bottom.Its a pretty close call but having used both Sony and Samsung (sony for longer) i feel that sony is more capable of delivering quality products as most Japanese manufacteres do. Also sony has great customer service vs Samsung i have had a sony TV break once and there was a repair man at my door step in less than 12 hours servicing my TV at home (bulb replacement in a old projection tv). Sony is the innovator here while Samsung is the follower, that's one reason why i chose the sony. Biggest factor for me was the superior Sony TV engine and better design. Oh and by the way sony is slightly thinner.Sony is the best your money can buy for a TV overall, as it always has been since the day of Trinitron.

This set produces excellent picture quality, amazing black levels and vibrant colors. The new Bravia Engine 2 also improves with 120Hz motion processing from Sony XBR4 line. My TV is located in a well lit room so the semi-matte display was a must. This TV delivers many useful settings to let you have the full freedom of making this TV truly yours. The PQ on 1080p material such as blu-ray movies or games is phenomenal. Broadcasted 1080i/720p HD sources look very good too - all depending on your provider and signal strength. SD quality is good but again it varies from channel to channel.For everyday use, this TV will get some immediate props for its' picture delivery from any viewer. If you like sports, you can expect unrivaled video processing of fast action. If you enjoy movies, this Sony offers a combination of settings to complement the true 24p cinematic picture.Since blu-ray movies are still expensive I have done a lot of testing by watching normal DVD's on my PS3 - and I have to tell you, those DVDs look better that HD broadcasts from Comcast. It feels almost unreal when you get to watch older movies with such clarity as if they were shot just a few years ago.If you need some starter settings to get more accurate reproduction of colors and detail, feel free to use my settings (post update v.202):Picture AdjustmentsPicture mode: CustomBack Light: MinPicture: 94Brightness: 52Color: 45Hue: 0Color Temperature: NeutralSharpness: 5Noise Reduction: MediumMPEG Noise Reduction: OffAdvanced SettingsBlack Corrector: OffAdvanced C.E.: OffGamma: OffClear White: OffLive Color: OffWhite BalanceR-Gain: -1G-Gain: -1B-Gain: -4R-Bias: -3G-Bias: 3B-Bias: -2Motion Enhancer: StandardCineMotion: Auto1Screen MenuWide Mode: FullAuto Wide: On4:3 Default: OffDisplay Area: Full PixelKeep in mind that sets and environments vary - so you don't have to use these settings verbatim. But it should give you a good start without a professional calibration. Just make sure not to leave the setting at the default given Vivid - since companies set most TVs at the brightest picture setting to compete against other sets in the bright store rooms. Otherwise you may be get a second hand tan from the picture =)Sound quality is excellent if you are not planning on using a more powerful sound system. The TV offers plenty of ports - so you can easily connect to many devices at once.I hope you love this TV as much as I do.

Chan \"Wilchan.com\"", "ReviewID": "R3FCEZU9Y646XP", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This is my first HDTV and this one fits my budgets. Both picture and sound quality are great.I was comparing this one with Samsung 650 and Sony XBR4.  XBR4 is very nice, but with $800 more it is way over my budget. I like the contrast on W4100 better.  I believe XBR6 will have same contrast ratio or even higher, but price will be definitely much higher too.  Samsung 650 definitely has better color on HD content, due to its 10bit panel maybe, but the glossy screen will produce too much glare in my family room where it has windows all around.  I was debating if 10bits panel really matters during the shopping process. But now, the TV is setup in my room and I feel very happy with the color (as I won't remember how 10bit panel on Samsung's looks like in Frys or Circuit City :) ).The PQ on HD content is very good in local cable 1080i and 720p HD broadcast.  SD content PQ is decent if you keep the Wide mode at Full mode.  If you skretch to zoom to take up the full screen, the result is not good at all.The sound quality is good too out of the box.  I don't have home theater system, therefore, built-in sound is important.So far, I enjoy this HDTV set a lot.Amazon white glove service is nice too.  They call before delivery and they unpack and setup the TV set for you.  I got this set for $2399 from Amazon a week ago and the TV arrives within a week.  Excellent.", "Date": "July 27, 2008"}, {"Title": "Excellent - but with a couple quirks", "Author": "Eric Persson", "ReviewID": "RBG1HU74MIMBD", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Bought this from Amazon, best price by $400+ from local stores and lower then other sites, and the Amazon reputation!!! White Glove delivery was 4 days earlier then anticipated and was flawless. They brought it in and set it up, turned it on and left...Over all I LOVE this television. My 'quirks' later are minor compared to the overall excellence of this.Picture is sharp, bright, and clear, even with sporting events. Sound is excellent, glare (I have two large windows in the room) is low compared to a glossy TV.I have played one DVD and watched cable television from it. The cable sourced unencrypted 720 and 1080 HD broadcasts that fill the screen are AWSOME! The others are better then my old 37\" as they equate to about a 42\" but I feel cheated because they don't fill the screen without losing the edges of the picture. This is a transmission issue not a TV issue.I bought a Bravia audio system at the same time and while it took me a little while to find all the settings in both devices once you do it works well. When you switch between functions (TV or Video) the TV and Audio system decide who's speakers to use and switch between them. You can override that but the initial setting work.Now the quirks....- I did a full auto search then digital channels only, some digital channels that I can direct access do not get enabled in the search. I can access them if I enter them in the TV Guide (which works well) but if I manually scan up or down it skips them.- Then I noticed that some channels that were locked out arbitrarily come back to live. When I go to them I get no signal. Occasionally \"can't decode signal\" which is an active encrypted channel, but I locked these out manually.- The PIP is frustratingly limited as you can only use it with the PC input. I often used PIP when watching sporting events and another show.- The PAP (picture and picture) is also arbitrarily limited as you can only use the TV input as the sub screen, then another input as the main screen. You can switch back and forth between them and get audio from the live one but not maximize then switch. I had an older tube TV that allowed PIP and then another that allowed 4x PIP and you could switch between andy of them.- The buttons to get the PIP and PAP are convoluted. There is not a single key to get them, takes about 3 to 4 key strokes.- The remote is out of ergonomic balance. The control buttons in the middle do nothing during normal TV operation and the channel and volume are all the way down the bottom putting it off balance when using it. They could have se the control buttons at the top to mimic the volume and channel.- Manual is good at best. Some of the steps to reach a goal are missing so the last step like `and push the control button' are there but how to get to that control button is left to the user to figure out.- No Coaxial audio out, there is Optical and HDMI.- TV Guide is very good. It also takes a litte 'smarts' to set up. One thing missing I had with my old Guide + Gold was the ability to schedule shows so the channel changed automatically or if you had shut it off, the TV would turn back on when the show started. The ability to schedule would have been nice.", "Date": "August 28, 2008"}, {"Title": "Took my time selecting a TV, glad I did.

Without mentioning a word most everyone that watches the TV comments on how great the picture is.  Almost hard to believe.  I have another relatively new LCD (Samsung and Samsung DLP) and a Plasma (Panasonic) set.  HD programming on this set makes HD on the others look like Standard Def.The way the set displays motion is unlike any other TV I have seen or owned, very cool experience to watch a scene pan left or right.  It doesn't look like TV, it looks like HD film.Intuitive menus and remote, easy to plug and play with most any hook up and source.  I have a PS3, Cable Box, Pre-Amp and Apple Computer all hooked up, it took minutes and everything worked right away.  You can even use the interactive TV menu to label each port.  Could not be easier to use this, very natural and simple system.  When switching sources they are listed by both port AND source, for example \"HDMI1 Cable, HDMI2, Game, HDMI3 PC etc\".Blows Samsung setup and menus away, Sony makes the Samsung interface seem complicated, clumsy and unattractive. I have had 2 Samsungs and am very happy to have purchased a Sony this time. Obviously the picture takes priority over the setup and interface, again the Sony picture is preferred as is the no glare screen. I also think the remote design is terrific, good size and layout.The design of the TV is stunning, beautiful work all around.

This Sony Bravia's 1080p, 120 Hz, high contrast specs result in a huge, crisp, vibrant picture that will have you standing there for several moments, dumbfounded that the images are actually inside your house.  You know then that those specifications were worth every penny.Like many, my final decision came down to the Samsung LN52A650 52-Inch 1080p 120Hz LCD HDTV with Red Touch of Color and this Sony.  Side by side in the stores, I judged the Samsung a better, crisper picture except when letters stayed on the screen (as in a film title or advertisement), and then the Samsung had ghosting where the Sony stayed steady.  Both performed better than other brands when viewing the picture from a slight angle, important if you plan to have several people in the room watching at once.  I chose the Sony, however, for two reasons:  one, our family room has a lot of windows and therefore, glare; and two, the price and promotions offered at the time of purchase.  The Sony screen is not as glossy as the Samsung's, and I thought it would deal better with the light conditions in my home.  The Sony blacks are deep, but more matte, one reason I think the Samsungs look better in the showroom but might be more difficult to view in a home.The set-up menu is intuitive except for the TV Guide feature, which cannot be used if you need a cable box to unscramble the signal, as is the case with most cable HD content.  The remote is easy to read without being bulky.  You can change the screen fill (wide zoom, normal, full, zoom) with a touch of a button without accessing the set-up feature as well as control a compatible Sony Blu-Ray player (ex. Sony BDP-S350 1080p Blu-ray Disc Player or Sony BDP-S550 1080p Blu-ray Player) through the Bravia Sync feature.  With 4 HMDI, one PC, and 2 HD component inputs, the set can handle a variety of hook-ups.  There are also some esoteric features such as DMeX compatibility (to connect a special Sony DVD to the television on the back/side), and voice zoom.  The 120 Hz Motion Flow keeps blurring to a minimum during fast action, historically a problem with LCD technology that is only rarely evident on this Sony.  If you are buying an LCD to watch sports, you will definitely want a 120 Hz refresh-rate set like this.Unless you have HD satellite or cable, don't waste your money on this set.  The enormous screen enlarges standard digital content that looks acceptable on a smaller (say, 42 inch) set into imprecise images.  Once you watch a DVD or Blu-Ray on this set, you'll know how lousy standard digital signals are in comparison.  I suggest a smaller LCD set for people who want standard signals but high-quality images during DVD playback.WHITE GLOVE DELIVERY REVIEW:  When you check out, at first you'll see that the television is not eligible for Free Super Saving shipping.  As long as you see the free White Glove Delivery box on the product page, don't worry.  (Note: White Glove Delivery was free when I ordered; it may not be when you read this.)  When you finish the process, you'll see that the shipping has been deducted.  We received a phone call from the delivery company as soon as Amazon shipped, then again two days after they received it.  We didn't get much notice:  they called Friday afternoon to say that they wanted to deliver it Saturday afternoon.  From ordering to delivery, it took a week.  The White Glove Delivery can be deceptive, however, since only one man arrived, and then he asked my husband to help him carry the television over the threshold and to the room where we wanted it set up.  If you are disabled or unable to help carry it in, or if you want it carried to an upper floor, make sure you tell the delivery company this when they call to arrange delivery.  While LCD screens are light compared to the old projection televisions of comparable size, the shipping weight is listed at 99 pounds (I think it's lighter than that -- more like 70.)  The service will lift the television out of its box and set it on the stand.  If you want, the delivery person will remove the packing material.  He will plug it in and (possibly) connect to your cable/satellite provided you already have the connection accessible.  Do not expect the service to hook-up all your devices to the set.  It is merely a subcontracted one-man delivery service.-- Debbie Lee Wesselmann", "Date": "January 7, 2009"}, {"Title": "Perfect!", "Author": "David", "ReviewID": "R30W8Q8AZ2H4LA", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Like most big screen shoppers, I did a ton of research and ended up with the 52W4100.

Just wrote a review for my Sharp I like to but this one has a digital picture of HD quality and even my DVDs Look SO much better it is truly UNREAL. I love Amazon but didnt purchase either thru here.BUY THE EXTENDED WARANTY!!!Let me give you a little background on my TVs Ive had 5 brands of TV, in the last 4 years all HD. First was a off brand big tube very heavy TV I think the brand was Dish. It blew up in 3 months. Then I got a 52\" JVC rear projection that was ok but had to replace the bulb in a little over a year, then a loose connection cousing 3 service calls and finally a replacement, it lasted 3 years. Was a good TV but the picture was fading cant say I wasnt a little happy it got replaced. While we had the JVC we got a 52\" Panasonic Plasma again picture was ok, but it ran very very HOT,it was like having the oven on in the bedroom, It went out in about 6 months and after the service tech couldnt repair it We got the 46\" LCD Sharp, even this one developed a line in the picture after about 3 months, contacted Sharp and after Emailing a Picture of the line in the picture they immediately sent out another TV and picked up the old one they were very nice and very easy to deal with, and the replacement has worked great for almost 2 years now. For a less $$$ amount I would recommend the Sharp Aquos LCD, It was the best till I got my Sony. But my best recommendation is always buy the extended warrantys there worth it.I dont do gaming or hook up my computer ect to my TV just my satelite and DVD, however it has 4 HD connections, monitor connection, in and out you know the rest, pretty much everything if your in to that you know what to look for.All I can say again and again the picture quality is far beyond any TV Ive owned, it runs nice and cool, very light for its size and HIGHLY RECOMMEND IT.One more thing I will never buy Rear projection or Plasma again.

They originally said they had the television in stock and it was ready to ship, however, I called them up a few days later and they said they were awaiting restocking of this television from their warehouse and then they would ship it. I contacted Electronics Expo a few days later after that and they informed me my television had been shipped and they gave me a tracking number and a phone number to call the shipping company. I arranged for the shipping company to deliver the television the next day. Surprisingly, there was only one delivery guy, so, I had to assist him carry the television downstairs, which was not a problem, however, there should probably be two delivery guys.Now, regarding the television itself. Last March, I purchased a Sony KDL-V3000 40\" LCD (2007 Model), which I am very satisfied with. So, please keep in mind that I am sort of comparing this older model to this newer television, since my eyes are so use to the older model. Essentially, for some reason, Sony downgraded this years W series to a 8-bit display from a 10-bit display last year. My V series from last year has a 10-bit display as well and this was sort of my benchmark when comparing and contrasting my new television to my older one. Though probably only noticeable to someone in my situation, that is, someone who is so use to a 10-bit display, the difference of quality of the color and vividness is noticeable (though marginally) of a 10-bit display vs. an 8-bit display. It's hard to explain. The colors are just more deeply detailed and more vivid on my older 10-bit display. So, if extremely vivid, jump at you color is your primary concern, you should probably consider an XBR television or even last years 10-bit display LCD's. I'm not sure why Sony downgraded their non-XBR series this year to 8-bit displays, whether it be economically, maybe cutting back on input costs to increase their profits or maybe they're seeking to entice consumers to spend that extra cash and go for the XBR series. Again, let me reiterate, you would probably only notice this marginal difference if your eyes had been so already accustomed to the 10-bit display, like mine.All in all, I'd say this Sony is a solid television. For a 52\", the television is pretty light and it only took two people to mount it to one of those mounting stands, which, you remove the base and screw the television onto the mounting stand. The picture quality is above average and the frame of the television is aesthetically pleasing. As always with a Sony, the layout of the settings are intuitive and well designed. The 120hz setting has improved the motion flow of the picture, however, the picture can look too video-like if put on high setting. The illumination of the Sony emblem is neat, though, it can be distracting while viewing, thus, I keep it off. Though, I do miss the vivid detail of a 10-bit display, you can't go wrong with a Sony.", "Date": "November 21, 2008"}, {"Title": "No TV is perfect, but this is close, great value for 120hz refresh", "Author": "JM5", "ReviewID": "R3BRHFPFLVEVEI", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I debated long and hard on the Samsung 750 vs the Sony.

I've had 5 Sony TV's, including 2 XBRs, and have NEVER had a problem. Never.  They are predictably great at rendering a great image...The one thing about the Sony is that it is SO good, it makes some non-blu ray movies played through a Blu-Ray device (PS3 in my case) that they look like a video.

What I did know is I wanted a larger HDTV so I found myself reading a lot of them. I like many of you reading these reviews, was searching for the best LCD HDTV for the best value. I mean these things are expensive right? So why I am writing a review you might ask? Because I hope that half of them ones that I read were an honest opinion, not a paid employee writing a review. This is my honest story: I knew I wanted a new HDTV and I had narrowed my search between the Sony W or X series and the Samsung 850 or 950 series. I already own a 32\" sammy, and am very pleased with it, so my heart was already with the Samsung. Then I saw a 52\" Samsung 850 at a local electronics store and OMG, man what a beautiful picture. I went back 3 nights in a row before I took my wife to show her. But this store only had an V series Sony to compare with, not a W or an X series. At the time, I didn't know there was very little between the the V and W series (very little) and they had neither the newest Sony or Samsung. Knowing I wanted to by a larger HDTV, I drove 150 miles to another city where I could view the TV I wanted side by side. I wasn't disappointed. The store we chose had all of the brands sectioned by TV size. Each size playing their own movie, a great concept in my opinion. We looked at all of the 52\" TV's and I thought, yes the new sammy is slimmer than the Sony, but is that worth the higher price? Yes the sammy has a very slight edge in picture quality, but I have a skylight in my family room and it would have a higher glare in bright light, is that worth the higher price? I read the reviews, I went to another store in a different city and viewed Sony V, W and Samsung 850 side by side, I worked both remotes and I definately felt the Sony was the best value. As viewed in the showroom, I really wanted the 850 Samsung, but in my opinion, it wasn't $500 dollars higher picture or function quality. I chose the Sony W series. The remote was easier to use and I knew I would be very happy with it once it was in my family room. I have had it for a month now and I am VERY please with the picture quality of my Sony and even more pleased with the ease of the remote. Did I mention I am already an owner of a 32\" Samsung? Do the remotes have the same options?..... basically yes but the ease of use goes to the Sony. In my opinion the Samsung 850 was not worth $500 more than the W series Sony, a little bit more...($100)...maybe, but in these hard economic times, not that much more bang for the buck. If you buy the Sony W series, you will not be disappointed. It has an awesome picture and you would only notice a slight difference if it were right next to an 850 Samsung.

I was originally set to buy the Samsung 650, primarily because of the bells and whistles and Consumer Reports' review. However, there seemed to be a lot of on-line comments regarding glare, and that kept me from rushing to hit the \"Buy\" button. And like everyone else, the size of the purchase in an on-line transaction was making me nervous.A few people at Amazon had lucked out buying from Amazon's Warehouse, and I had been checking that site every now and then. Then. . . there it was. . . the 52-inch Bravia -- the only thing \"wrong\" was a damaged box. Other reviewers had made Warehouse purchases with slight damage to the product, and that damage was generally nothing more than where sticker glue remained! So, now I had the opportunity to buy a \"mint\" Sony TV, which had better sound than the Samsung (the poor sound was a common complaint that was mentioned among Samsung purchasers). I had owned a couple of Sony sets in the past, and they had given me years of good service, so I knew that Sony had a solid track record -- something that couldn't be said about Samsung. Personally, I hadn't always found Consumer Reports' reviews to hold up (I'm the only person I know who bought a Honda Accord that turned out to be a lemon). True, there weren't some of the bells and whistles that the Samsung had, but I got to thinking about how many times I've fallen hook, line, and sinker for the bells and whistles on other products (think \"computer\"), and then I never used them. If I bought through the Warehouse, I'd end up paying about $600 less than for the Samsung that I wanted and about $300 less for this Sony than if I bought it directly through Amazon.com. Hey, what the heck! I bought it!Delivery took a little over a week. I didn't realize it, but even with the Warehouse, the delivery was \"white glove,\" so the set was carried into the house, pulled out of the box, and plugged into to ensure that it worked. I've yet to find the \"damage\" on the box! Everything was perfect!I've had the set for about a month now, and I'm VERY happy that I made the purchase. Other reviewers have commented that the colors aren't as bright on the Sony as on the Samsung. Honestly, if they were any brighter, they'd blind me. The picture is fantastic. I finally traded in my regular Time-Warner cable box for one that allowed me to hook up the HDMI cable that I also bought through one of Amazon's retailers (I think I paid about $6; I got the cable with the gold), and I can tell you that as far as the reception goes in the Saratoga, NY, region, that cable is an absolute necessity for SD. Without the cable, the SD reception is somewhat fuzzy, and reading anything on the screen is difficult. With the HDMI cable, the SD reception is nearly as good as HD. When you change boxes, you need to set up the TV again, though. Another advantage to the HDMI cable -- you can get rid of all those other cables, although the person at Time-Warner told me that I would still need them. It takes some time for the cable box to start working with the TV, so you might think differently, but believe me, within 15 minutes, everything starts to work.Although the menu set-up for other features is not as obvious as it could be, after a couple of tries, you can figure it out, so that's not a big deal. And, after all, how many times do you really need to change your settings? The menu needs to be controlled from the Sony remote, but controlling the regular functions (e.g., volume, channel-changing) can work with your cable's remote. I really like the fact that I can change the sound to adjust it so that voices are clearer. Sometimes movie-sound is very muffled, and it's hard to hear what's being said; this has made it much more pleasurable to watch movies, as I can hear a lot of those things where I used to say, \"What did he say?\"I don't have a sound system, DVD player, games, or anything else hooked up to this TV, so I can't comment on how those items work with it. We're hooked up to dozens of movie channels, so we're content to use it as a television. I'm re-watching nature shows (e.g., Planet Earth) and other movies I've seen, and it's a whole new experience. I love old B&W; movies, and they are an absolute delight to watch. Everything looks like it is in high def. One need not be into high-tech gadgets and color to thoroughly enjoy what this set brings all on its own.I very highly recommend this TV -- and suggest that you keep an eye on the Warehouse if you're not in a rush. Hey, you never know!It has been FOUR -- yes, FOUR -- years since I bought this set, and I still love it. Nothing has gone wrong, the picture is still perfect, and I still endorse Sony full-heartedly. Prices have gone WAAAAY down since I bought this TV, so it's probably a steal now.Because technology has advanced from where it was when I bought this set, if I were going to buy another large Sony TV, I would look for one that has apps installed on it so that you don't have to go through several steps to access something like Netflix or Amazon.

I received the Blu Ray on the 28th and the tv today about 4:00 PM, much sooner than expected.The Amazon site when I placed the order didn't show White Glove delivery but the shipper's site did.  The one delivery guy and I moved the TV off the truck, carried it across my yard and brought it into my living room; together we hooked it up - one HDMI cable from the cable box so that part was not too tough!  It would have been, however, very difficult for one person (either the delivery guy or me) to have moved this tv into my house alone.It would be handy if Amazon's site had showed a rear view of the set.

The V and W Series for 2007 (designated as 3000 models to distinguish them from the 2008 models, listed as 4100) replaced their 10-bit processors and color panels with a more common 8-bit configuration.  The change represented a cost savings to Sony, which in turn was passed on to the consumer, who previously had practically been \"conditioned\" to expect to pay premium prices on all Sony models.  But the consequence was also \"aesthetic\": the new processors are capable of representing 256 color hues compared to the 1024 gradations of the previous V and W models.The difference is perhaps not as great as the statistics would make it seem.  The Sony W Series presents a sharp, stable, vivid and dramatic picture (including the \"deep blacks\" that Samsung once made such an issue of) that's capable of not only holding its own but standing out from the crowd.  It's only after studying a current V or W model for an extended period of time and alongside a current Z model that you become conscious of greater complexity, richness, and \"lifelikeness\" in the 10-bit color picture of the Z model (indeed the W picture may even seem a bit more dramatic and vivid than the Z picture, but there is undeniably some noticeable \"banding\" marking the edges of various color shades and hues).Bottom line: unless you're a serious photographer planning on using your flat-screen TV with your hobby or a cinematic connoisseur determined to get the most from a blu-ray player (presently the only sure way to enjoy a full 1080p rather than 1080i picture), this Bravia W is currently the best all-around value in larger-sized HDTV sets on Amazon.  But if you wish to experience state-of-the-art color reproduction, it will be necessary to look at a Z-series or the pricey XBR line of Sony sets.  Or, you might check Amazon's Warehouse Deals store for a 2007 model in the V or W series (designated 3000), but sacrificing such niceties as a 120Hz refresh rate.My old Sylvania 27\" CRT set lasted me almost 30 years.  Unless you plan to switch sets every other year, be willing to pay a couple hundred more for a set you'll have no 2nd thoughts about.  (Personally, I'd go for the 46\" Z set or, if money is tight, the 40\"V3000 for around $800!  The 120 Hz (and next year 240) refresh rates add even more artifice to the film-viewing experience, at times making you feel like you're watching an action event on quaaludes.)", "Date": "March 3, 2009"}, {"Title": "STOP WAIVERING AND JUST GET IT.

All customer service/tech reps were not located in this country and were quite hard to understand.

That and i wanted to keep every electronic in my home theater one brand. Sony Ps3, Sony LCD, Sony Floorstand Speakers.Only one Flaw  that i come up with is the remote really does need a glow or backlight.The Tv Guide feature is amazing for me a person who has cable without a cable box it helps when tv guiding.

I went to Best Buy, Cuircuit City, and a few others to see for myself, several times.  My wife was sick of it!  Just pick one, she said.  So one day we went in to Best Buy, we both saw the XBR6 and w4100 52 inch, and we actually preferred the picture and color of the w4100.  I bought it for ~ 2300, if i could go back I would buy it thru Amazon for ~1900 and save the tax, live and learn.  But here are a few of my impressions, hope they help:1)  The picture is great, I can't imagine it better.  I read a review that said the XBR had more vivid color.  When you get the w4100, under the picture menu, you can set it to vivid or cinema or standard or custom (make your own).  I like mine on vivid, the colors are amazing.  And you can really tell the diff between settings.2)  Glare really is important.  My TV sits in our living room, a skylight and reflections from the front door ruled out Samsung and Pioneer.  REALLY glad I went with Sony's matte like surface.  Yes, when the screen is completely black, you can barely notice some areas not as dark as others.  But no glare is fantastic.3)  I made my final decision irreguardless of price.  I figure I am going to be living with this tv a long time.  Narrowed it down to Pioneer plasma kuro- the picture is just not bright enough plus glare issue, and the Samsung models, all with too much glare, even with limited light.  I really wanted to buy the latest Samsung 8 0r 9 model with the backlight for the 55 inches it has, but that glare was too, much.4)  52 inches is plenty big.  I had reservations going from a 10 year old 60 in bohemoth projection tv, but after you experience true 1080p HD, you dont even notice the diff.  you just enjoy tv more.5)  GET A Sony PS3.  Blue-ray is the best (TV prof reviewers use it as the gold standard), plus you can put your photos and videos on it with ease thru a usb cable.  Friends come over and i show them the latest pictures of trips, etc, on my beautiful tv, they love it.  More features on PS3 than I thought, plus my kid loves Little Big Planet, phenomenal vid game. (don't bother with 25$ remote, the vid game controller is much easier to use, mine just sits there)6)  Mount it on the wall, if you can, it just looks better than I thought, tried it both ways.7)  I have cable tv with a few hd channels, huge diff in picture quality.8)  Anywhere you buy it, it will be shipped to the store, no one has it on hand, might as well get it from amazon shipped to you and save a bundle, (Again, no tax)9)  HD TV is phenomenal, step up, you'll love it.10)  Sound from tv is good,  good enough for my wife, definitly loud enough.

After proper calibration, the blacks are very deep while retaining the bright white. The colors are also vibrant, especially on Blu-Rays and on my PS3.I use this TV for normal cable television viewing and for Blu-Rays and video games on my PS3. Through HDMI 1080p the picture is so detailed and clear compared to our last TV. The 24p playback along with 120hz give movies a much smoother feel. I know some people don't necessarily like this, but I to me it makes the TV all the better.Another thing I really liked was the fact that this TV passes 5.1 surround sound through the optical output, while some TV's downscale the 5.1 signal to a stereo signal. This allows me to have my PS3 on and at the same time get sound from cable television.Cons:The remote is a bit ugly, but its functional. I use a universal remote, so no worries there. Also the clear band of glass underneath the screen makes the TV look much better, but if you don't use the provided strap to put cables into, you can see them through the glass. The glossy exterior of the TV is a semi-dust magnet, but not as much as my PS3. Just use a micro fiber cloth and try not to leave fingerprints.

It will take a week or so to get them, and then they have to turn my living room into a TV repair shop. At this point I say to myself..NO WAY..not gonna happen..so I call Amazon..just start to tell my story to the lady who gets my call...after one minute, she says \"SIR, STOP!!!

This is not even to mention that Amazon's price was at least $300 below the local big electronics retailer (that's not even including the tax I would have had to pay).Set up was brilliantly simple (which is good, b/c I'm a moron when it comes to electronics).  My parents don't speak English, so I was pleased to see that once setup was complete, the TV pretty much worked itself.  I set the TV up with the new Sony bluray player we got using an HDMI cable (Amazon's prices, again, the best for those cables); hooked up our very old vcr with the old analog (3 pronged, red, yellow, and white) cable; hooked up the old rabbit-ear antenna (relieved I didn't need to buy a new one); plugged all these pieces into a surge protector and ta-da! It worked!  I also love love love how the TV instantly detects the external components, so you can put in a videotape, DVD, or bluray disc and push play, and the TV will automatically go to your external device.  (This is good, again, for the electronically challenged among us.)  I should add that there are 4 HDMI outlets on this TV, a PC outlet, and room for at least 4 analog components.Lots of features on this guy:  auto-sensor for ambient light; excellent speakers; Bravia sync which synchronized the TV to our bluray player so they turned on/off in unison; free TV guide programming; power saving options; etc. etc. etc.  Unlike another reviewer, I actually really like the remote control.  It's incredibly user-friendly.  The only thing I would change is that the home button and circular trackpad be moved to the bottom and the channel & volume buttons be moved to the middle.The picture is good.  I think, though, that I was expecting a lot better.  There is still some evidence (or more evidence than I'd prefer) of pixelation despite all the fanfare regarding the 120Hz and digital signal.  Potential buyers should take care in picking the appropriate sized TV for their room, as this will only emphasize the pixelation if you get a TV too large for your space.I don't know if this is something that will get ironed out in the future, but the letterboxing (i.e. the black bars on the sides or on top & bottom of the program being viewed) is kinda annoying.  You can switch from channel to channel or even (when on the same channel) from program to program and you'll see different variations on the letter boxing.  I was watching the local news which had no letter-boxing, then they'd run a commercial that had letterboxing on the sides of the screen, then the next commercial would have letterboxing on both sides AND on the top and bottom of the screen, etc. etc.  Sony made it easier to deal with this with the simple touch of the \"Wide\" button on the remote, but you have to adjust it with every single program and/or channel.  It would be nice if there were some way that this was fixed universally or if Sony could have automatically adjusted the picture to the perfect zoom.  (Sigh, maybe I ask too much.)  As I said, perhaps this will be ironed out once the networks adjust to only digital signals.Very happy with the purchase and I think you definitely get your money's value with this tv.", "Date": "January 3, 2009"}, {"Title": "White Glove, Waste of Time, Great TV.", "Author": "M.

The picture was beautiful for four days, then these lines appeared and would not go away. In the menu, there is a customer support number, I figured I would need to just reset the tv to make the lines go away. The lady walked me through it and nothing happened.  She said a service technician would have to come out and look at it. The service guy came out the next day and determined the panel was bad and needed to be replaced. I contacted the store I bought it at and they informed me they do not have any and wont be receiving any more of the 52w4100's.  They offered me a store credit, but I would still have to come up with $600 to get the xbr.  My friend works at a service center and he reassured me that it would be like brand new if they changed the panel. I felt comfortable about having it changed. It took another two weeks for the service man to get the parts in and an available service time for him to come fix it.  He arrived, changed the parts and nothing happened. Sony sent bad parts. Before, there were lines in the tv, but it could still be watched. Now, I cant even watch it.  He called sony right away and they told him they would call me in two days to inform me of the exchange policy.  Two days later they called and first offered to upgrade me for $400 to a tv that is $200 less than mine on their own site.  Then they told me they could only send me a refurbished one, that they didnt have any new ones and it will take 19 days for it to get to me.  That was very upsetting. I called customer service back and asked them why it would take so long and that they have new ones in stock on their site that ship the next day. The picture was beautiful for 4 days.

The White Glove delivery through Amazon was very good.  We elected to keep all the packing and box just in case the set had an issue.  So far, no problems.  The set came with the stand already assembled.We had previously prepped the wall over the fireplace to mount this unit.  We did, by the way, purchase a Cheetah Mount for $35.00 and change with $10.00 shipping.  Those in store (Circuit City, Best Buy, ABC mounts for $200 + dollars are just way to expensive (read this overpriced!) in my book.  We were very impressed with the construction and design of this wall mount which is rated up to 180 lbs.  This new set comes in at 71 lbs.DO purchase your cable connections as well as wall mounts through the internet.  Just a ton of money to save and very quick delivery.  E.G. 2 HDMI gold tipped 10 foot cables for $3.99! + shipping.But, I digress.  We came from a 46 inch Analog rear projection Hitachi.  Purchased it brand new in 1997 and spent, cough...$2,200!!  That set has performed flawlessly and is presently in our sons and his familys great room.  This state of the art flat screen just jumps at you, almost 3d ish.  Im sure you folks out there who have migrated to this flat screen technolosy in the last few years would not be as impressed as we are (going from an LCD from 3 years ago to this unit today).I did a lot of research on these flat screens and had narrowed it to the SAMSUNG equivalent and this unit.  The reviews for this unit on the AMAZON web set were very helpful and is one of the reasons I wanted to post our impressions.  We lucked out on the money saved by watching for promotional codes in electronics on AMAZONs site.  Our total cost for this set, with NO shipping or sales tax, was $1,599.99!A site we found very helpful had to do with CALIBRATION of this set by users like you and I.  Here it is[...]Be sure to read through this whole calibration topic as other users have provided their settings.  To some degree this is subjective as the sets environment will affect your ultimate viewing pleasure.After letting our set run with its factory default settings for the last 5 days, I felt that I needed to tweak the blacks on our set.  My son thought that the blacks (night scenes) lacked definition.  So, I adjusted the settings to mirror what OFF_ONLINE posted at the above web site.  The only change to his settings I made was to increase the backlight from 50 to 70.  Im leaving these settings in place for a while to see how the set reacts to daylight running and in 480i mode as well.We DO like the matte finish of the screen.  The set is mounted in an unlit area over the mantle that faces out towards a row of 3 sets of windowed french doors.  As you can imagine there is a lot of natural light that flows directly at this set.  That matte finish just mutes the glare.  A big plus for this set.All in all, this 1st impression of 5 days ownership, is a big PLUS!Jim & Mary", "Date": "January 14, 2009"}, {"Title": "Sony 52\" LCD - Excellent", "Author": "J.

I was very close to purchasing it b/c it was $200 cheaper.  However, when I compared the volume, I discovered the speakers on the samsung pointed down, and it did not sound very loud at the maximum level.

I find that you have to readjust the picture, as it is set for a store with lots of light, where at home usually this is not the case.

It is a tiny piece of plastic about the size of a large rubber band. Clearly this part is fragile at best, but it came apart into 3 separate pieces when I first touched it. It was clearly defective.I contacted Sony customer service on their \"Customer Service\" hotline (1-239-768-7547) and after being on the phone for over 30 minutes I was told that Sony would not replace the part, but I could have the privilege of paying $2.25 for the part and another $6 for shipping via UPS.They even had the audacity to try and blame the white-glove shipping company that Amazon.com used for breaking the part.So if you are counting that's $8.25 for a tiny piece of plastic (which probably cost 10c to manufacture), that was defective when I received it, on a television worth over $1,800 when I bought it.Poor form Sony, you just lost a customer who owns 2 previous Televisions, a Camcorder and a DVD player of yours.So my recommendation is to not purchase anything from Sony unless you are OK receiving this kind of customer service.", "Date": "April 6, 2009"}, {"Title": "Who Pays for Amazon's Pricing Mistake...the Customer of Course!", "Author": "Steelers Fan", "ReviewID": "R115MCGTX51RYA", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I have always been pleased with my shopping experiences at Amazon until today.  Yesterday, I purchased this television at what I thought was a good price, considering it will soon be replaced by a newer model.  This morning I received an e-mail (see contents below) indicating that my order has been cancelled due to an incorrect price.  I had an order confirmation for a price of $1431.20.  The currently posted price is now $1649.98.  That's over $215 difference.  Needless to say, I called customer service and ended up talking to the clueless, brainless robot Izhe C.  All she did was recite the contents of the e-mail, and even after admitting Amazon made a mistake, said there was nothing she could do about it.  She went so far as to mute the phone and not even listen to what I had to say.  Normally, you pay when you make a mistake, but not when you're Amazon.  They think it's a great way to cover their a** by cancelling orders and making the customer pay for their alledged pricing mistakes.  I wonder what would have happened if I ordered the TV, then called the next day and said \"I made a mistake, I don't have as much money in my bank account as I thought\".  Would they allow me to cancel my order with no penalty?  If this is the way they choose to treat their customers, then not only have they cancelled this order, but any future orders from me as well.E-Mail Contents===============Greetings from Amazon.com.We regret to inform you that an error caused the following item(s) tobe displayed at an incorrect price:Sony Bravia W-Series KDL-52W4100 52-Inch 1080p 120Hz LCD HDTVIn accordance with our posted policies on pricing, we are unable to offer this item for the incorrectly posted price.

Maybe it's because I don't have high def...?  For over the air analog broadcasts the picture is actually worse.  Yes, I know we'll not have those in a few more months.  The digital picture seems \"jerky\" to me and the remote must have been designed by someone that never uses a remote.  The volume and channel buttons are at the very bottom of the remote instead of being in the middle.  It's not comfortable to use since the remote is not balanced in your hand.  Also it ONLY controls the TV.  You'd have thought with a $3000 TV, they'd supply a universal remote... sorry.  If you have satellite, you will have to use your satellite remote to turn on the satellite box and change channels and your TV remote to use the TV.  It's like going back in time.  If you have high def. cable, you'll have to use your high def. cable remote to control your cable box and the TV remote for the TV.  I did get the satellite remote programmed to work some parts of the TV, such as volume, channels and input, but that's all it will do and you must still keep the TV remote to do anything else.  I thought maybe I was not seeing how to program the remote for other devices so I checked with Sony and they said that I was correct that the remote only works the TV.
