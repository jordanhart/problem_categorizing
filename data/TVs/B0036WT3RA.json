{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Fantastic Image Display", "Author": "tbone", "ReviewID": "RV4T2EQNR3SO9", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "The picture on this TV was stunning right out of the box. After a few minor adjustments it was as close to perfect as I could imagine. It came with the SQ01 panel and it would be hard to differentiate the color depth and quality from some of the plasma sets I looked at. The TV is in a very bright room and the matte screen cuts out glare with no picture degradation. The viewing angle is very good, though we are never more than 25 to 30 degrees off center. The picture is very stable from channel to channel with no change in the back lighting that I can see, and the standard definition picture is almost HD quality when using the 16:9 picture format. It has separate settings for processing speed and anti-judder for motion blur when using the Custom view mode, unlike the majority of sets that combine both settings into one. I watch a lot of sports and really don't notice motion blur at 60hz so its certainly not an issue at 120hz. I'm not a gamer, so for my viewing habits I see no need to spend more for a 240hz option. The sound is very good for normal TV viewing. It can be connected to a home network and I have also hooked it up to my laptop using the VGA connection to watch Netflix and even that produces an acceptable SD picture. There are multiple picture settings you can use to suit just about any programming source, including watching at 120hz without the \"soap opera\" effect that some people find so annoying. There are 4 HDMI and 2 USB connections, plus one for headphones. There is no S video so you may need cables to hook up older external equipment. UVerse is the programming source.One thing about settings. The first evening the picture suddenly got much darker and even though I would reset the brightness, it would get dark again once I left the menu. I spoke with Samsung and they had no idea why this was happening. It turns out this set automatically adjusts the picture to your room brightness in the Standard viewing mode, which is the factory default. You can change this in the Eco portion of the picture menu to never go below a certain brightness level or you can turn it off completely. This is not an issue when using any other viewing mode.The last time I bought a LCD I continued to look around in case I found something better. That will not be the case this time as I am completely satisfied. Pilot shipping through Amazon was great. They delivered on time, set up the TV and swivel stand, and had everything working in 5-10 minutes.Added note on Warranty: If you purchase an item with your Amazon Visa, or pretty much any credit card from a major bank, it extends the manufacturer's warranty 100% over the original duration (one year to two, etc.) at no cost. Amazon verified this but check with your bank if you use a non-Amazon card.", "Date": "March 30, 2010"}, {"Title": "A Home Theater Centerpiece", "Author": "J. Hopkins \"hopjohn\"", "ReviewID": "R1NJBXYDOLWSDW", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Firstly, it's important to point out that I was shopping strictly for a high quality 1080p display. I have a home theater with external speakers and an advanced learning remote so the TV's audio quality and stock remote played an insignificant role in my decision to purchase this model. Now then, the LN46C630 was the best 46\" 1080p display I could find that had all the features I was looking for. My criteria were for a model with 120hz, an adequate amount of HDMI inputs (4), a pc input, largely tweakable picture controls, excellent black levels, an absence of motion blur, and a cost of under $1000. This TV possesses all of those things, and beat out the competition of similar LG and Sony models because of what I deemed to be the cleanest, most well defined image, along with superior black levels. The only thing I felt lacking on this TV was the screen texture which is more prone to glare. Though, because my room is quite dark that was of no real concern either, but could be to others with more ambient light in there viewing room.Here are a couple features I learned about only after I had the set that may be useful in making a decision.:-The TV has Eco Sensor which will automatically adjust the brightness of the TV based on the ambient light of the room. No worries, this CAN easily be turned off, and is definitely something to be aware of.-In the Advanced settings menu there are 2 expert patterns that you can use to dial in your picture settings. One is a contrast / brightness pattern, the other a color pattern.-If you'll be using the TV's speakers there is volume equalization which adjusts the volume automatically as you switch channel to channel.-You can stream media to this TV through your wired LAN or from an external USB storage device. if you want to do wireless, you'll need Samsung's optional wireless adapter.-The stock remote has a very narrow IR stream. You'll want to point it not at the center of the screen as most people do, but at the bottom right corner. It works fantastic once you learn to do that.Some other important notes I'd mention to those that purchase this model:-At default levels the contrast is maxed out to 100 for every input. I and many others refer to this as \"torch mode\". That setting will shorten the life of your TV immensely and it needs to be adjusted first thing for each input. While properly calibrating your TV is more than I care to get into here (and pointless since every display is different as well as every input), a setting of 50 contrast and 50 brightness is good place to start for those that don't have any other means of calibrating it more precisely. I also lowered the back light from a default 14 to 10.-Under the picture options there is a setting called Auto Motion Plus. This is what controls motion blur. Familiarize yourself with the effects of this control. If you are like me it's going be disturbing to have this control on \"Standard' to view bluray movies because it removes the natural blur of the camera moving and panning which to me is an annoyance. I use the \"Clear\" mode or just turn it off for movies.-Also the effects of the sharpness control only add noise to your image, use the sharpness control very judiciously. I have mine all the way down to a setting of 9.All in all this is a fantastic set for the price. The very minor issues it has are far outweighed by the price, the amazing picture quality, and the tremendous control you have over adjusting the image to your liking.", "Date": "May 8, 2010"}, {"Title": "It has great potential", "Author": "rainmakr", "ReviewID": "R1IEU2MHRWOSTD", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I first ordered this set in early August and I really wanted to like this television.  It is easy to set up, it has a good remote, and the built-in speakers are acceptable.  At first glance, the picture is very good (once taken out of \"torch mode\" and the \"soap opera effect\" has been minimized by turning off (or minimizing) the Auto Motion Plus feature.  The backlit remote is nice, but not *all* of the buttons are lit.  I'm not sure why, and there were times when I needed the unlit ones.  And, being unfamiliar with the remote, had to turn on/up the room lights to see what I was doing.  But, the main problem I encountered with this set was the color uniformity.After having watched for a week and having some time to get past my initial awe at how good this set seemed to be, I noticed a flaw in the left side of the picture.  When panning a football field, I saw that the left 6\" or so of the screen was lighter than the rest.  And when viewing scenes that had a lot of red in them, the left 6\" of the screen was significantly lighter than the rest of the screen.  Note that I was sitting about 8' away, dead center -- off-axis viewing was not the issue.I tried to ignore it, but finally created some solid color slides and viewed them using the television's built-in slide-show feature.  What I found was that the left side was significantly lighter than the rest of the screen.  It wasn't very noticeable on blue slides, but was very prominent on red and green slides, though bright reds & greens were less of an issue.  I kept the TV second week, trying to get past it, but the problem was distracting when watching football.  And, when watching interviews with \"America's Got Talent\" judges, their skin tone and the red backdrop was frequently discolored (interviews were usually framed with the face on the left side of the screen).I asked Amazon for a replacement, which they sent without a problem and at their expense (as was the return shipping).  The replacement set I received was better.  But, again about a week after having the set, I noticed the same problem (though not as pronounced).  Again, I tried to get past it -- not only did I not want to deal with a return, but didn't want to deal with researching a replacement make and model. Just when I thought I could live with it, I noticed a 2\" (approx.) vertical stripe on the left side of the screen.  The stripe was a section of panel that was brighter than the rest of the panel.  It had hard edges, indicating to me that it was a panel problem.  During most shows I didn't notice it; but, it was very prominent during a few dark scenes of Up, Star Trek, and a few others.Again, I loaded the color slides I had made, which revealed light leakage (or clouding, whatever it's called), similar to the first set.  It also revealed the stripe in quite a few of the slides.  Considering the price of this television, I called Amazon and asked to return it.  I was offered a replacement, which I considered, but ultimately decided to return it and get something else (Panasonic TC-P46G25).For those wondering, labels on both sets (and the boxes they came in) indicated an AA02 panel.Summary:-------PROS:- adequate sound quality from built-in speakers- decent remote- picture mode button on remote (Vivid, movie, etc)- Sleep button on remote- backlit remote- back of television has a kensington lock slot- non-glare screen is very good in rooms with a lot of windows & ambient lightCONS:- not all buttons on remote are backlit- default Auto Motion Plus (AMP) setting results in a horrible \"soap opera\" effect- color/picture uniformityNotes about the \"Amazon experience\":- I had no problems with the local delivery company, which was CEVA for me- Amazon paid all shipping costs, both ways- Amazon did not give me any hassle at any time", "Date": "October 13, 2010"}, {"Title": "CAN YOU SAY \"WOW\"?", "Author": "J.

I've been looking in store and on-line for over 2 years, LCD, LED, Refurbished, Consumer Reports, etc...  By reading the reports and reviews from different web-sites and from personal viewing in store the Samsung seemed (to me any-ways) to out shine the others.  The picture is just breath taking out of the box. With the different viewing modes and the 120 Hz auto-motion watching a HD Television program or especially a Blue ray video is quite amazing.  Yes... I've read in other reviews the speakers don't sound as good as my 20 year old Color Console did... but I didn't buy it for the speakers....  Yes the remote is a little difficult at first, but once it's set I use the Cable Box remote controller more than anything.  I really did get a kick out of being able to plug in my External Hard Drive into the USB Port on the back of the set, having the set automatically find the drive then display the directory of movies that I have downloaded from Netflix on it, and then with the push of a button play them.... Well I think I have a very good base to start with, next comes a external sound set up, and then an internet ready Blue ray player. I bought the Square Trade 3 year policy with it, what ever you do buy a policy with any set you are planing to buy.  With the 1 year Samsung warranty, the Amazon return policy, and the Square Trade coverage I think I have all the bases covered... For the price and the performance I don't think you can go wrong with this one... I'll add to this review later on if anything should come up.*********************************************************** 5-03-2011Well he I am 1 year after my purchase...The HDTV is still going strong... at least 4 to 5 hours a day, and I was just exclaiming too my Mrs. while watching the Royal Wedding on BBC America in HD what a breathtaking picture this set still has, I feel that the display is as good today as it was a year ago when it came out of the box.  Yep I added an external sound system to it, and a desktop computer also. It now has theater quality sound and HD video streaming when I want, and can I surf my Facebook page from my Lazy-Boy when I wish using my  wireless hand held keyboard.Just one thing to say.....

I connected a Playstaion and Wii using component cables and put the tv in game mode - wow! I also have an upconverting dvd player connected thru hdmi cable and some scenes look almost three dimensional. The matte screen is great for cutting down on glare. I am an avid sports fan now enjoying high def cable and the trumotion 120hz really helps for the fast movements on the screen.

That was dissapointing. I wish I had spend a couple of hundered dollars more and got a model with Internet@TV feature.But, you can still hook up this TV to your wireless router at home and stream videos and pictures from your PC/Laptop wirelessly.I am planning to buy the Samsung Blue-Ray 5.1 channel home theatre system with the Internet@TV feature, and that would take care of everything that is lacking in this TV that I would like to have.If you are not looking for advanced features, but a very good reliable TV with great picture quality, this is a very good buy for the money.", "Date": "May 14, 2010"}, {"Title": "LED vs LCD and a Note for Gamers.", "Author": "Amazon Customer", "ReviewID": "R1EBZKTFUGA2IC", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Gamers, see the bottom of this review!We have been shopping for a TV for a while and at first we were going to go with the Vizio LCD that is 47\" and 120hz, but the picture quality on the Samsung was just too good. The Vizio looked washed out and sad compared to it, so we decided to go with the Samsung 46\" LCD. We ended up with the wrong TV (not through Amazon). We were given the LED version and decided that we would just keep it, even though it cost more.Well, we ended up returning the LED and getting the original Samsung LCD that we wanted. In our opinion the LED is not worth the extra money. The only thing I liked better was that the TV itself was a slim design, but the difference was negligible.We went to Wal-Mart and Best Buy before deciding to return the TV and carefully studied the differences between the Samsung LED and the Saumsung LCD and I understand that there is a lot of personal preference involved here, I preferred the picture on the LCD. As soon as I got the LCD home I knew we had made the right choice. Some people prefer the LED; to me it was actually too bright and I didn't notice a substantial change in quality. If any change, to be honest. The only difference I noticed was in the brightness.If you are the type of person who needs to have the latest and greatest thing, the LED will probably be what you want, but if you want a good TV that looks nice and will probably save you a few dollars, go with the LCD. And I would recommend avoiding trying to save money by going with the 60hz LED over the 120hz LCD. The only time I would recommend a 60hz is for straight gaming. See below.To my fellow gamers out there! I hooked my Xbox360 via HDMI cable to this TV as soon as I got it unpacked and the quality is amazing. I played several games to test it out for about two hours and never noticed any any problems and I was really looking for one. If I had had even the slightest hick-up I would be writing about it.If you are going to be using your TV for gaming only, go ahead and save some money by getting the 60hz, either LED or LCD. 60hz is ideal for gaming and, in fact, when you put your TV in \"gaming\" mode it's just going down from 120hz to 60hz. This TV, from what I have noticed, actually somehow puts itself in gaming mode when you turn on the Xbox. I have noticed that everytime I switch it to Xbox the screen says something about switching to 60hz.If you are going to be watching TV or DVDs and playing games, I would strongly suggest that you invest in a 120hz, but if you will only be gaming 60 is great.", "Date": "November 23, 2010"}, {"Title": "What a awesome TV especially for the price", "Author": "eric \"eric\"", "ReviewID": "R1EVE30UFOD6II", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I picked this TV up this weekend and all I can say is WOW.

In the mean time I starting reading that the Samsung 2010 models were about to hit the market.  When I saw that the price was lower than last year's model, I decided to buy.  I haven't been disappointed since then.I read many great reviews about last year's model (LN46B630) which helped in my decision.  That, combined with a lower price, a better contrast ratio  (120000:1 vs. 80000:1), and the 2010's picture displaying 100% of the NTSC Color Standard, helped to seal the deal.

I got it for $900, and it out performs or equals most edge-lit LED/LCD units that are hundreds of dollars more. I think what impresses me most is the picture clarity, as well as a plethora of picture options and intuitive features that are overlooked by other manufacturers. Being a gamer, I constantly tweak picture settings, and the presets provided are extremely helpful when switching between various types of media and inputs. Because the 120hz refresh rate can be jarring for things like movies, tv shows shot in video, and downloaded .avi files, I generally lower the smoothness for them. I have a PS3 connected via HDMI and the picture is staggeringly good. When gaming, I use the smooth setting on AMP(automotionplus), and the dynamic color mode, which gives you a huge advantage by making poorly lit areas clearly visible. The ability to adjust the dejudder and the blur reduction independently is awesome, and you need to play around with it a lot to get the best picture out of any media that is 720p, or if you have a game with odd frame rate issues it could resolve them or reduce their severity. SD looks really good on this tv, even better then most CRT's, especially if you concede to using the 4:3 aspect ratio. Sports look incredible on this TV, especially with the 120hz set to smooth. It should be noted, that this TV has an endless viewing angle, thanks to its matte finish. I use a Sanus full-motion wall mount and love it! The menus are quick and snappy, as well as laid out clearly. Something that has always bothered me with big-screens is the irritating lag between menu screens, and this unit does not have that problem. The media player works great for .avi files but did lock up once when connected to my external hard drive. This is most likely due to an issue with the hard drive, as I haven't had any other issues with the media player.

I finally decided on this 46\" Samsung LCD, both because it was a recommended best buy on CR and because of multiple glowing testimonials from friends.  Overall, I have to say that I am very, very pleased with this TV, with a few caveats, which I will describe below.  The short answer, however, is that this is a high quality, versatile TV that just about anyone will be happy with.Right now I am using an Xbox 360 for games, Netflix streaming, and DVDs while I await a Blu-Ray upgrade.  Games could not be more sublime.  Pictures are crisp, colorfol, and input response time is very good (only a few \"twitch\" games revealed any minor delays at all, and they were nominal).  Street Fighter IV and Pac-Man CE DX, two timing-dependent games, play very well.When streaming a movie or show in HD, the picture is phenomenal.  Couldn't be more pleased.  DVDs are pretty good too, though it depends greatly on the quality of the DVD itself.  An educated guess would be that Blu-Rays would be as good or better than the HD streaming.  This model has the auto-smooth 120hZ refresh rate, which doubles the normal framerate of shows and games, but honestly, I just leave it off.  It makes movies and shows TOO smooth, everything appears to be shot using a camcorder, and the effect is distracting.  I'm sure that for HD sports it is a worthwhile feature, though, to prevent any screen tear (though I never notice any in fast-moving films using the 60hZ setting).The Standard Def image using my cable box is fine...but by no means great.  Clarity is slightly worse than on my old CRT television.  I haven't upgraded to the HD cable yet.  Again, my educated guess is that it will be on par with the HD streaming from the Xbox, which is to say, quite good.Many people on here have complained bitterly about the sound quality from the TV speakers, but this seems to be a gripe from audiophiles who now expect everything to be in 5.1 or 7.1 surround sound.  The speakers are, for built in speakers, very serviceable.  Switching the EQ to the Movie Setting will give you a tremendous improvement over the default setting, increasing the bass and overall depth of the sound.  They are still obviously not as good as a home theater system, which would improve the clarity of dialogue and overall richness, but as stated already for built-in speakers they are just fine.  A note, however, if you plan to mount the TV on the wall: the speakers are on the back.  This is probably to help bounce sound to create a faux surround sound, but if mounted to a flat surface it could adversely affect the sound output.In the interest of full disclosure I should say that I am awaiting a replacement to the original LN46C630 that I ordered, due to an unfortunate amount of \"light bleed\" coming from the right hand side of the screen.  For 90% of content this is not noticeable at all, but for extremely dark scenes (esp. when watching in the dark) there is a swath on the right that is noticeably brighter than the rest of the screen.  This has to do with how the frame is bonded together (light is leaking from around the edges of the screen) and is just a fact of life with LCD screens.  Hopefully the replacement will be better, because it is my only true gripe with this set, and only then because I am a stickler for image clarity (and let's face it, I watch a lot of movies set in space, which tend to be dark :) )***EDIT - The replacement set has come in and the picture is significantly better, with much truer darks and no discernible light bleed whatsoever.  Speakers do not sound quite as crisp but some testing leads me to believe this has more to do with the external device than the set, as using external speakers for the same content produces the same result - END EDIT***The set itself is beautiful, with a very sturdy stand if you choose not to mount it, and the remote is well laid out and backlit, making it easy to use in the dark.  Overall, if the replacement is free of the light bleed issue, I will have been tremendously pleased with this purchase.  It was a significantly cheaper set than many of the others in its quality range, and issues like light bleed could hit any unfortunate LCD, it is not an issue with just this set.  It should also be noted that the return policy Amazon has is phenomenal.  They are bringing the replacement and picking up the old set within the space of one week, completely free of charge, and all it took was a 5 minute phone call to set it up.  I will come back for my future electronic purchases.Hopefully this review is helpful to anyone that, like me, was skittish about diving into such a large purchase.  Overall I would have to say that LCD is the way to go over plasma (more reliable and uses far less energy) and that Samsung is a high quality brand at an affordable price.

Additionally the people that were to fix it never put into the system that my TV was even seen for repair, which means I can't get a different TV to replace this one.

It was between this one and an LG comparative. So I went to best buy for some visual comparison and ended up buying this one one through Amazon and couldn't be happier.I was really focused on picture quality, reliability, and ease of use with my new TV as I wanted to spend less than 1000 bucks but still buy quailty. I know usually the two have a hard time working together.....Samsung has always had great reviews in way of reliability, and my personal experience has been pretty good with customer service. This tv rated quite high on consumer reports and cnet. Please also realize all HD tv companys now suffer around a 3% failure rate. So far after 3 weeks I have no issues, all samsungs are known for having a slow start up time, I knew this going in, so the 5-10 seconds or so it takes to say \"Hi\" to me isn't bothersome.When comparing this tv to some of the newer edge lit LEDs I found this TV to have not only better picture clarity, but also truer blacks, greens and browns, very comparative to a panasonic S2 and g25 plasma I was looking at. In fact, of all the LCD's I looked at this one captured the true colors the best. All the led tv's, although vibrant, tended to wash out the lighter browns and greens to the point of making everything look cartoony.As far as the dreaded LCD image blur, well it is there, but you have to look for it. I do not see it while watching football, basketball, or normal hd telvision--where I notice it the most is while watching hockey. The contrast of the fast speed, and dark uniforms against white ice presents a slight edge blur when looked for. However as said you have to loook for it and hockey has never looked so good in my house! You will litterally see every slice in the ice, and every scratch on thier helmets. As for The tru motion thing/soap opera---shut it off its awful and I have found no good use for it.With HD programming this tv is utterly amazing, I find myself watching the travel channel, discovery channel, nat geo and most of all palladia to watch concerts in HD with utter aww. You litterally feel like you are in the crowd. Streamed netflix looks incredible as well.As for setup the tv sets very easily on its quite beautiful glass stand. I used the AmazonBasics High Speed HDMI Cable (6.5 Feet / 2.0 Meters) - Supports Ethernet, 3D, and Audio Return [NEW MODEL] X 2  for my FIOS DVR box and PS3 and have found everything to be plug and play with no issues what so ever. I have my TV setting on a oak stand/cabinet that is in the corner of the room and it is a wonderful presence. The TV has a wonderful built in menu system to adjust everything to your liking, and although the remote is a simple candy bar, it is quite funtional, balances in the hand well, and will fine tune your tv into and littleral mesmerizing experiance.Sound: I researched my tail off settling on that I was going to have to buy a Sony HT-CT150 3D Sound Bar System,as according to everything I read flat screen sound is awful, however I am glad I didn't. The sound on this tv is very very good, I rarely have to raise my volume to anything more than 15. It is clear, because of its location in the corner of my room and the back projected sound you even get some surround sound effect from it. Voice clarity is perfect, bass although not outsatnding, is quite acceptable for built in speakers.My wife surprised me with a PlayStation 3 320GB System with PlayStation Move Bundle, this past week and I am truly amazed at the image quality on this tv, and the tv's game mode sharpens it even more! Using the ps3 has allowed as said before net flix and internet capability. allowing me to not have to spend more on a tv to get those features that quite frankly would clutter this wonderful tv's simple pure, fantastic image producing quality.Because it was in the stars review I will say the only thing I didn't like about my Amazon/TV experience was the delivery. Yes they were on time, however they came on the wrong day(they did call the night before which allowed me to rearrange my sched), they did not wipe their feet before stepping on my light tan carpet(its winter here), and they simplay dropped the tv off. Althought I undertsand this is all that is required, pilot shipping un packed, and verified my good friends plasma tv working ability for him before they left his home. I could have opened the box to find a shattered screen. Like I said I know this is not a requirement, but it would have been nice to not have that uneasy feeling as I opened the box, knowing that I may have a big hassle on my hands, rather than just not signing for something and have them take it from my home. However this is not worth removing a star from this tv, as it is the shipper not the tv.Overall, if your looking for simple, pure, beautiful, picture with adequate sound, for a good price this is your tv.", "Date": "March 1, 2011"}, {"Title": "One year and 5 months", "Author": "Thomas M.

LCD screen looks very uniform, and colors come off very sharp. Fairly good picture even at an angle, though not quite as clear as looking from dead center. The picture is NOT very good out of the box, however, and you'll definitely need to adjust some things (too much brightness, skin tones too pink, etc). Luckily, the TV gives you a LOT of customization of the picture, much more than any other comparable model I've looked at. I'm using the following settings, and think they are a noticeable improvement over the default settings:Picture Mode: MovieColor Temp: NormalBrightness: 47Contrast: 95Color:  49Tint:  G49/R51Sharpness: 0Backlight: 7Red - Offset 28Green - Offset 25Blue - Offset 16Red - Gain 17Green - Gain 25Blue - Gain 21This TV also includes a setting called AutoMotion Plus, which greatly smooths out the picture. On the downside, when this feature is enabled, it makes everything look like it's filmed with a home camcorder. This is what some people refer to as the \"soap opera effect\". Movies look like behind-the-scenes footage, etc. I find this feature to be absolutely worthless, since it ruins immersion and is very distracting. In most cases, it's nothing more than a fun gimmick, although people who watch sports or reality television shows might enjoy it because it doesn't change the look of the visual presentation (from film to home video) and simply smooths out the existing picture. In rare cases, I've seen quick stutter every 5 seconds when this feature is enabled, as if the TV isn't quite powerful enough to handle this level of picture processing. Note that this setting is enabled BY DEFAULT, and if you don't like it as much as me, you will need to turn it off for every one of your inputs since picture settings are not global.The audio speakers are about equal to any built-in TV speakers you've ever heard. The bass is very limited (no subwoofer, obviously), but stereo effect is much more pronounced than what I'm used to, which I like a lot. TV has several options to enhance sound, including several simulated \"surround sound\" settings. These can be used to greatly enhance bass levels, but I've noticed that it makes dialogue in movies sound less natural and more synthetic, since these settings seem to basically be equalizer presets and change how sound sounds at various frequencies. I find myself generally keeping all the surround sound settings disabled and think that default sound is very good on its own.I use Comcast's service for my television feed, with their Cisco cable box connected through HDMI. In general, their picture looks very good on this screen, though the HD channels looks somewhat more murky than even 720p resolution, despite the fact that the TV is reporting that the cable box is sending it's signal at 1080i. Comcast just doesn't have enough bandwidth to deliver quality HD picture, so this is not the TV's fault. If you want to experience the full power of this TV, the only way to go is with Blu-Ray or gaming consoles.Besides television, I connected an Xbox 360 to the TV via the Xbox 360 VGA HD AV Cable. This cable plugs into the TV's PC video and audio inputs, and offers 1080p resolution (1920x1080) with 0 controller lag. A benefit of this cable is that it upscales regular DVD the way expensive DVD players do, giving very crisp picture on this TV fairly close to Blu-Ray quality, though not as detailed. If you connect game consoles with HDMI or component cable, you might experience some controller lag, but this TV includes \"Game Mode\" which removes some of the advanced picture processing (AutoMotion Plus, etc) in order to reduce that lag.This TV can connect to your home network with an ethernet cable (WiFi dongle sold separately) to stream media from your computer, but does not get online to connect to internet services like Netflix or YouTube. If this matters to you, you can buy one of dozens of Blu-Ray players that have extensive Internet features and just use that, or use a PS3 or Xbox 360 for Netflix, etc. I personally don't care that the TV itself can't access those online services on its own.Overall, every feature of the TV I didn't like is optional (though, oddly, AutoMotion Plus was enabled by default out of the box). I can't force myself to complain about these extraneous gimmicks too much when some TVs don't even offer them, and others offer the same exact bonus features that don't work any better. And don't kid yourself, the majority of these features ARE gimmicks. But as far as what actually matters, the TV offers amazing picture (given a good source) and very good sound for the price.As far as delivery, I chose the \"free\" option rather than expedited service. The estimate given by Amazon was 9 days. Delivery was handled by third party shippers, who called me on day 8 to let me know that they'll be deliver the TV 13 days after I placed my order. The day before delivery, they called again to give me a 4-hour window to be at home, and arrived on time, 13 days after my order was placed. They took TV to the room I specified, took it out of the box to show me it was not damaged, but did not attach it to the swivel stand. I knew to expect that, but just giving people details of what they get with Amazon TV delivery. Overall, I was not very happy that it took this long to deliver, but it did arrive in one piece and I saved a lot of money with free shipping and no sales tax, so that balances it out.", "Date": "March 5, 2011"}, {"Title": "LOVE my first HDTV", "Author": "Jason Brinkle", "ReviewID": "R3S5RCZX6QQ8K7", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Like many others here, I did a LOT of homework and pricing before deciding to get this particular TV.

The remote is not the greatest looking thing in the world, but it is very easy to use and the button layout is extremely comfortable and functional.

The second has the same problem the first one did, and we were offered a refund and declined.  This TV (others in forums beg for help with the problem) is not good for OTA users.  When a weak channel gets pixelated and the signal drops, the tuner locks out all channels.  The only way to get reception is then to turn it off (which at this stage takes 3 times longer than normal) and back on.  Samsung does not appear to log in this problem yet, because they told me they had no record of it being a problem.  However, the service company coming to repair it says they'll have to order a new tuner before they can come.  I've had this second one 2 weeks.  Last night I had to turn it off 25 times in 2 hours.  If all your channels are strong, it might not ever be a problem.  If you have marginal signal strength on some you watch, I'd think twice about buying this--UNLESS THEY FIND THE PROBLEM.

I also had recently moved into a new house with a much larger living room, so I wanted to upgrade in screen size.My primary interest in the TV purchase was to have a TV that would work great for video games. I have an Xbox 360, PS3, and Wii all plugged into this TV. Due to the fact that I have 3 video game systems hooked up to the TV and that I have FiOS cable, I couldn't care less about the TV having internet connectivity, widgets, or any of that stuff.I also was crossing shopping this TV with the 46\" offerings from Sony and LG, as well as the Panasonic plasmas. After evaluating reviews and going with what I thought was the best picture I chose this Samsung.I could not be happier. The picture and features on this TV blow me away. Auto Motion Plus seems to work great for gaming and sports, be it football, basketball, or hockey, but Auto Motion Plus does make normal TV shows look amusingly awkward. This feature can easily be toggled on and off when necessary though.In terms of gaming, its great. I think that Red Dead Redemption is one of the prettiest games out there right now - and this TV makes the game look positively stunning. Halo Reach, Uncharted 2 - it doesn't matter what you play, you will be happy with this TV.This Samsung even makes the decidedly average Wii graphics look good. Wii Sports Resort looks nice, Metroid Other M is decent, and Red Steel 2 is very impressive. With this TV, Red Steel 2 could even be mistaken for a 360 or PS3 game in terms of graphical quality.Obviously Blu-Ray looks great too.There is a lot of talk between LED and CCFL backlighting. I personally think that this TV blows away the side-lit LEDs in terms of picture quality and brightness/black levels. The \"good\" LED TVs are in a different price bracket, so I won't bother comparing them.I also have this TV in a reasonably bright room, and I have no issue with seeing the screen due to ambient lighting conditions.In terms of problems with this TV, I can only see one issue: the speakers. They're terrible. Don't even bother thinking that you can deal with them. You are doing yourself and your $1k TV investment a disservice.I bought the Sony HTCT150 soundbar. It has great sound, and matches the quality of the TV.On the plus side in terms of sound, this Samsung has an optical out jack in the back - so if you have a sound system, you just plug in an optical audio cable and you are good to go.I have my cable box, PS3, and 360 all plugged into the rear HDMI ports, and the Wii plugged into one of the rear Component ports.

I haven't found myself wanting other apps yet, but if I do, I'll just get an internet capable blu ray, since many of the better quality ones have that capability.In summary: don't waste your money on an internet capable TV, unless it is a built-in capability packaged with something that you really want (e.g. 3D, if you're into that) or it doesn't cost you much.

The price was good (it has not gone down much since then, though, which is surprising), and overall, I was fairly satisfied with the TV in the first year of ownership.  I was not blown away with the quality.  Of note, the picture, even for sports which is my primary viewing interest, was what I would characterize as good to very good.  The audio (not enhanced with separate speakers etc) was somewhat underwhelming, but I am not that concerned with a home theater experience.The reason I am writing a review (I am normally a free-rider who is keen to peruse other reviews but I do not usually comment whether satisfied or not) is to warn people about durability concerns.  This TV only lasted slightly less than 18 months.  When my partner contacted the folks at Samsung, she was informed it was out of warranty.  The problem has grown progressively worse, and the cost of a site visit (just to diagnose any problem) is $150 and the repair could cost more.  I have tried a progressive series of troubleshooting measures, per the Samsung directions, but no measures fix the TV.  It continues to flicker and dim (rendering it unwatchable).  When I spoke with someone in Samsungs' \"executive services\" (not sure what that refers to since I am not an executive but merely a dissatisfied consumer), I was fed the same line my wife was regarding the warranty only being good for one year.  I asked the representative if that is typical for a Samsung product because I don't expect a big screen TV purchase to fall into the annual purchases category of running shoes and britta filters and the only response was an apology, but not a defense of their product.There are online fixes suggested (basically taking apart components and cutting cables that according to the online fixes should have been disconnected at manufacture), and I will give this a try.  Even if these consumer-made fixes work, that does not excuse Samsung from unleashing a faulty product and not standing by it.

Consumer reports ranked this one as the highest non-LED TV, however, so I thought I'd check it out.In the store, I couldn't discern much of a difference between this model and the much more expensive LED backlit one next to it, also by Samsung. I must have stood there and looked at them for 20 minutes or more. Both were on sale, but this one was significantly less expensive and I decided it would meet my needs.The picture is awesome. Menus are fairly easy to use, though it takes some tinkering to figure out which options you want (see technical note below). The blacks fade slightly to grey when you view the TV at a wide angle, but this is a minor concern to me. Travel BD disks like Over Ireland [Blu-ray] are amazing and movies are so good that I'm addicting to buying blu-ray disks now. Though I'm not much of a football fan, I've been watching bits and pieces of the games because it feels like you're right on the field with the players.Sound quality is mediocre. It is better than our 37\" Samsung, but we owned a 37\" Panasonic that sounded as if it had a soundbar in it. For regular TV watching it is satisfactory. We have a Samsung HW-C450 Soundbar Speaker home theater system, so if we're watching a movie we have the option to create a true home theatre sound and visual experience.I'm satisfied with all of the features. Our Samsung BD-C5500 1080p Blu-ray Disc Player connects to the internet, so I didn't need the internet connectivity on the TV. I was surprised to find that the TV would detect computers through the home network and play music or pictures on those machines just like the BD player can.TECHNICAL NOTE: One thing that impressed me about these TVs was the motion-smoothing feature. I thought it looked good in the store, and made that a required feature for my TV purchase. When I got the TV home and started to tried it out, I found that everything, even the Empire Strikes Back, looked like a cheap 1970s video production. After researching this problem on the internet, I learned about the \"Soap Opera Effect\", which is neutralized by turning OFF the motion smoothing feature. There are two levels of motion-smoothing on the TV (and I believe the lower level is the default setting), so if the picture is disappointing you try adjusting this feature to see if the picture improves.I've had this TV for just over a month.

I did a fair amount of research and determined that this particular model was the best value for our money.  This is not the most current technology (i.e. not LED or 3D).  This is in fact an advantage of this set in that the prices for LCD-only TVs have come down with the introduction of LED and 3D TVs.

The one I like the best is the ECO setting which, when enabled, automatically brightens/dims the backlight according to the ambient light in the room.  This means that we can see the picture full daylight and not be blinded by it at night, all without having to actively manage the brightness setting ourselves.  I'm not so far a big fan of the Motion Flow feature and have, for now, disabled it.  For the most part it has little obvious (positive) effect on general programming.The sound of the set is a little \"tinny\", even after playing around with the numerous audio controls.  In the end I connected the audio output of the television to our home theater system, and the sound quality is no longer an issue.  However one thing that I do find annoying is that the audio output is unamplified and does not mute when the main TV speakers are muted.  This is a minor issue.Though I have not yet played with the network connectivity features, I have played several videos of the kids' concerts generated from Windows Movie Maker program  The video playback from a USB stick, is perfect with no delay or stuttering.  In addition the slideshow feature works great to show photos.  I look forward to adding a Wifi bridge so that we can view all of our digital media from our computer network.We have had this set for about three weeks now, and so far it has met all of our expectations.

It can produce a pretty bright screen and the picture was almost flawless right out the box!

Delivery was fast and within the provided time window.  Rated 4 stars just because I haven't had it that long, and I'm unfamiliar with other models.  The set meets or exceeds all of my expectations.  I got an \"S\" panel.Pros:  The picture is very crisp even in standard definition and lower frequencies.  The HD sometimes has an almost 3D effect.  I've never had HD before so it's like a whole new world.  I'm no audiophile, so the stock speakers/sound is sufficient.  Even at relatively low sound levels (ie 10-15, which is maybe 25% of the max volume), it's loud and clear.  Plenty of inputs (3 or 4 HDMI, component, RCA, USB, VGA, etc), and the panel is set up so all are easily accessible.  Didn't notice much of an upgrade w/ my Xbox 360 when plugged into componenet, but on HDMI it brought out so much detail and color (note: may not have anything to do with the TV, I don't know).  The menus are relatively straight forward.  The finish and look is nice as well.  I got a clear base stand which looks good, almost like the set floats over the base.  It's light enough for a 1-man carry.Cons: The remote is quite bulky and slightly confusing, imo.  I won't use it much anyway.  The power input could be lower and more centralized, the port is situated far to one side, so you may need a longer cord for your situation.  For whatever reason, the string/screw that tethers the set from falling forward simply doesn't fit (have tried all the holes).  That's really it thus far.Other:  Don't be afraid to tighten the screws down hard with the plastic base.  I was worried about cracking the plastic, and the result was the set wobbled left and right.  Had to take it apart again and tighten them down more.  I do wish the tether worked, but that's very minor.

Then after about 20 months it would occasionally flicker (more like a strobe light). It got progressively worse and worse until it flickered constantly and therefore was unwatchable.If you google the model number of this TV the first thing that comes up is lots of reports of flickering - it is a very widespread problem.Fortunately I had an extended warranty through Square Trade and it was fixed under warranty (Square Trade was great, by the way). The technician replaced the power supply board. I wonder if the replacement board is the same as the original and will fail in another 2 years?The takeaways for me are: (a) Samsung TV quality is questionable (a nearly $1000 TV fails in less than 2 years???), and (b) I'd recommend anyone purchasing a Samsung TV also purchase an extended warranty and just consider that part of the cost of the TV.--NOTE: There are lots of reports on the web of folks cutting a jumper on the power supply board and stopping the flickering. Allegedly there is an \"official\" Samsung service bulletin about this, but I can find noone who's actually produced a copy of this and my technician hadn't heard of it, and Samsung is mum on the issue. So I remain skeptical of that fix. Maybe it fixes the problem, but why is the jumper there in the first place if it can be cut? What does it do? Does cutting it lead to other problems or shorten then life of other components?. Since my TV was under warranty I went to a technician for a proper repair.

Based on all of the consumer complaints for problems on multiple different Samsung TV models and model years, it seems as if Samsung designs, tests, and selects the components for their TVs to last until just after the warranty period.

I looked hard at LED edge-lit and back-lit models. Edge-lit LED screens seem to have a risk of developing edge blooming although most people appear to be happy with them. Back-lit LED screens with intelligent brightness control can provide outstanding contrast ratios on paper but not so much in practice. This TV uses traditional cold-cathode flourescent tubes for backlighting.  They're not as efficient as LEDs but I think they have better spectral output and uniformity. The difference in efficiency is not huge.I seriously considered all brands but after looking at many reviews this Samsung appeared to have significantly fewer instances of Dead-On-Arrival sets, or sets developing problems shortly after arrival. I own two other Samsung LCD TVs. They are working as well now as when I purchased them about 3 years ago. My LNT3253H has been turned on almost every day for about 6 hours. No dead pixels or other problems yet.This new model looked great in a local retail store but Amazon had the better price and delivery was included. The delivery was handled by a professional and courteous crew, arriving 3 business days after I ordered the TV. They were happy to put it where I wanted it although I didn't ask them to negotiate any flights of stairs or deal with any animals.The TV was easy to set up on a flat surface. The included stand does not swivel.  The rectangular base has a footprint of 11 x 22 inches.  The quick-start instructions are clear and easy to follow.  Out of the box the picture wasn't great but a few minutes of adjustment did the trick.  The picture settings are different for over-the-air digital signals verses the analog signal I get from my low-def satellite box. They must be adjusted separately (a good thing).The default motion-smoothing mode (Auto Motion Plus in the Picture menu) did not work well for my analog satellite signals. It actually made things very jerky. I turned it off. The analog picture was fine after that. I left Auto Motion on for digital TV signals. It seems to help there.Sound and picture qualities are reasonably good compared to everything else out there.

I have owned this TV for only a month now, so this review will be made in the context of an initial impression.When I was considering making a purchase of this kind on Amazon, I was apprehensive about having such a large and expensive item shipped to my home, particularly after reading some of the less than stellar reviews about the CEVA freight service that Amazon uses to ship large items.  Not only did the TV arrive as scheduled, but the delivery driver took the time to bring it into the house and upstairs to the room where it was going to be used.  He was very friendly while he unpacked the TV, set it up and ensured it was working properly before he left.  I was very pleased with this level of service, which is supposed to be included on TVs that are larger than a certain size.The TV was extremely easy to set up.  I had it up and running within 10 minutes of connecting the power.  The interface and remote are intuitive and easy to figure out.  There are a number of adjustable picture settings that make this TV very customizable to your personal preferences.Since I have had it, I have connected a High Def cable box and XBOX 360 to it and have had the opportunity to view the picture through both sources.  I must say that the picture on this set is incredible.  I currently own 3 other LCD sets (made by Vizio and Dynex) and compared several 46\" TVs by different manufacturers prior to buying this set, and the picture quality and vividness of the colors on this Samsung leave all the others that I have seen in the dust.Before buying this TV on Amazon, I searched local big box stores to see if I could find it at a comparable price and avoid the shipping, but Amazon had the lowest price I could find beat by almost $150.  Add that to the fact that you don't have to pay sales tax and it ships for free and this purchase was a no-brainer for me.If you are condsidering buying a 46\" LCD TV, choose this one.

Black", "ReviewID": "RHT92Z9U0CN9Y", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "After years of standing around the showroom, staring at these amazing televisions, I finally bought one. I bought it through Amazon's Warehouse Deals as a Used - Good condition. I cannot find anything to suggest that it was \"used\", besides the price which was about $200 less than Amazon's. It was shipped through Pilot delivery service, which I had never heard of before but was just fine. I set up the delivery date on checkout and they came on time, with a call beforehand. The delivery guy even helped me get the TV into my living room.-PC:The first thing I did was connect my PC (9800GT video cards) to the TV, via a 1080p-capable DVI to HDMI cable. Last time I hooked up my PC to an HDTV, I had to manually resize the resolution because the image was cut off even though I had been using a 1920x1080 monitor (also made by Samsung). However, with this TV, there was an automatic resize option in the menu, and I only had to press one button. This was the first thing that impressed me about the user-friendliness of this TV. My computer looked amazing! My desktop wallpapers popped right out and came to life in full beautiful color.-Xbox 360:The next thing I attached was my Xbox 360, via the optional VGA cable, into the PC (VGA) input. The sound wasn't working immediately but that was my fault. The game (Red Dead Redemption) looked awesome too! However, I know there are some settings that need to be changed to make it look perfect, mostly on the Xbox itself. I'll update this review once I get the Xbox attached with an HDMI cable instead of VGA. It's mostly because of the refresh rate - this TV is 120Hz capable and I'm pretty sure the Xbox is only doing 60Hz. But with the image smoothing turned on, it was looking way better than on my 23\" monitor.-USB:One of the main reasons why I purchased this TV is for the USB input. It was hard to find an accurate description of what this can do, exactly, so I will describe it. My first experiment with this was with a USB drive. I wanted to put a 1080p movie on it, but the flash drive was only 4GB so none would fit. Instead, I put an episode of BBC Life on it (720p Blu-Ray in .mkv format). Playing from the USB is really easy - it plugs into the side, and then you just change the input with the remote to \"Media Drive\" or something similar. Samsung sorts all the files by type - video, music and pictures. In the video folder, my show was right there, and I just pressed Play.It looked SO GOOD. I felt like I was in the showroom again. It was so completely amazing that I felt like I didn't deserve this TV, because you can't enjoy something with such a powerful materialistic lust without being an evil person. Well if this is wrong I don't want to be right. The color is crisp and beautiful (hello, 120,000:1 dynamic contrast ratio), so bright and lovely that the plants and animals of BBC Life were almost *too* real. I think that I could travel around the whole world and not see things as beautiful as they appear on this TV. And it was only in 720p! I'll update my review once my large USB drive gets here and I can try a 1080p video. I think USB is the best way to watch media on this TV, as you don't need to buy any expensive DVD players or configure any options. I could watch things right from my computer with HDMI, but you can't output from the PC in 120Hz. Plus they are re-writable and can store any type of media.As far as the sound goes, it's pretty much as good as you can expect for built in speakers. It's \"surround sound\" but I didn't really feel surrounded like I do with 5.1 speakers. However, the bass is exceptional for not having a sub-woofer. Once I get my surround sound speakers wall-mounted I will probably use those instead.I'm sold on Samsung products. You really can't find better quality. My phone, monitor, and 2TB hard drive are all made by Samsung and now my TV is too. They are the best. Compare them side-by-side and it's plain to see how much better Samsung is than Sony, LG, Sharp, and all those other brands. This TV is very user-friendly, with easy configuration of settings. The remote is good too - functional. Some TVs have flimsy stands but this one seems very sturdy. I read complaints about difficulty putting the stand on, but mine came already on so I can't say anything about that.Anyway, these are the only things I've tried with this TV so far. I'm going to try connection over CAT5 cable, as well as attaching an external hard drive via USB. I'll update this when I do.The only thing I'm worried about is the energy cost of running it, even though I'm not using it 24/7 or as my main computer display. It's Energy-Star certified but who knows what that means. They say these TVs crap out in 2 years... well I bought the 4 year SquareTrade warranty so hopefully it's never an issue!", "Date": "June 25, 2010"}, {"Title": "Very good product, nothing to complain", "Author": "Sumin Song", "ReviewID": "R29ZQLU8GA74LC", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "We already have one Samsung lcd tv 40' (forget the model, might be LN40B550 something) and we like it.

As I indicated earlier, when it does work for a brief period, the picture is absolutely amazing on blu-ray (via PS3) and HD cable.Samsung's customer service has been very pleasant and responsive thus far. Will follow-up after repairs.**Addition:After having the TV replaced, the set works perfect. Its been a few months now. The picture is beautiful and even standard DVD looks amazing. I still have some \"clouding\" in the bottom corners (small white patches) and a audio syncing issue. The audio is a fraction of a second delayed behind the picture. I've tried a few fixes and nothing has worked yet. Other than that I am very pleased with the TV and the quality. It is a great TV for the price. Nothing I've looked at comes close. My next purchase will be a 240 HZ set.

I had initially bought a plasma TV at a brick and mortar store only to return it a week later because of it's loud buzzing sound that seems to be an epidemic among plasma's. But I had bought that plasma because I wanted deep black levels and a fast refresh rate. So after hours of research, I had narrowed my selection down to a few models (mostly Samsung, but a couple others too.) This TV - the LN46C630 - was my top choice. It had excellent black levels for a LCD, and it's anti-judder and refresh rate were highly recommended by two trusted online sources (I don't know if it's appropriate to mention them here). The TV did not disappoint!!! The picture on this set is BETTER than the plasma I had just returned and the features and ease of use are outstanding - absolutely outstanding! I have yet to see any evidence of judder or problems with refresh rates and after hours of purposely searching for anything I could complain about, I've come up empty. I love it. My 9-year-old son loves it. My new girlfriend likes it more than she likes me! Actually, I'm pretty sure she just comes over to watch the TV :) LOL. Seriously though, I couldn't be happier and that says something because I am quite hard to please. The sound on this thing is fantastic - I have to admit I'm a bit reluctant to turn it up all the way, but it sounds great at louder than reasonable levels, although a little bit deeper base would be appreciated. Still, it's not a stereo - it's a TV and it sounds better than any stereo I've had before. The XBOX 360 looks better than real life and this HD nature sunrise show I watch every morning makes me forget I'm living in an urban apartment because I'm mentally transported to the scene. Sure, most HDTVs can do this, but to this degree?Another note ... I bought this through Amazon's Warehouse deals and found practically nothing wrong whatsoever. It had stated that small scratches were located on the bezel and back of the unit, but I found none. It was packaged as if it was brand new. It contained everything the manual said it should and with the exception of a couple model numbers being handwritten on the back of the manual, it was in perfect condition. The delivery guys were professional and allowed me to open it up and inspect it before i signed for it. I set it up quickly and have been happy ever since. Now if I could just get that hot new girlfriend to look at me the way she looks at my TV ... I guess I don't mind being used for my electronics ;) Have fun with your new set!

And I have done research on the different types of TVs for a while so I thought I knew what I wanted.  And I like this TV overall but there are some quirks that unfortunately come with LCD's.  One is the viewing angle, while the picture never becomes unwatchable it does become washed out the more off center you view the TV.  Now if you never watch TV off center then you're probably ok but for me I watch it from different angles and I can notice the change in picture quality.  The other issue which is a little more of an annoyance for me is the motion blur that again comes from the fact that it's an LCD.  All my friends own LCDs and I've never heard them complain about it even though I knew it to exist with these kinds of TVs so I thought I wouldn't be disappointed.  Well...it does bug me from time to time now.  When the picture is standing still then it's crisp and vibrant, but as soon as the camera pans or someone runs across the screen it blurs.  I'm trying to just accept it and move on, which I have for the most part.  But it does make me wish I had tried a plasma instead.  I also wonder if getting a smaller screen like the 40\" would've decreased the blur issue.  I watch HD television, blu-ray movies and play xbox on this TV and the games can be the worse to notice the blurring so I wouldn't recommend this TV for games.  IF you choose to play games on it anyways then you need to use the \"game mode\" because that cuts out lag you will notice in the regular mode.  Also be prepared to have you TV calibrated by a professional or you can do what I did and buy a colorimeter for $150 and be able to do all your inputs and be able to do any future TV.  The colors our of the box just seem too blue and self calibration isn't too hard especially with the free guides out there on the internet.  So that's my two cents, it's a good TV but not a great TV so hopefully this will help you with your decision.", "Date": "November 21, 2010"}, {"Title": "Great  TV.

The picture quality was sweet, right out of the box.  BluRay disk playback was absolutely gorgeous; my wife and I were simply \"wowed!\"Now the negative and why it was returned:  Like a growing number of consumers (albeit a minority), my primary entertainment source is (streaming) Netflix along with OTA (antenna) programming - mostly for news and weather plus some network programming.On the day I received the set, it was rather stormy, so (antenna) signal strenths were challenged.  After the set-up was complete, including the initial channel scan, I began viewing my normal favorites.  Whenever the signal would grow weak, the set would become \"disoriented\" and unresponsive.  If I tried to go back to a PREViously strong channel, no dice, it would not lock-on.  The only solution was to cycle the set \"off,\" then \"on\" again.  Once again, however, the same thing would occur - no recovery.  By comparison, my three-year-old Sony Bravia, under the same circumstances will recover without intervention.Thank goodness I purchased the set directly from Amazon and was able to return it without hastle and with a full refund.  Return shipping was \"on their nickel.\"In conclusion, this phenomenon has been documented previously, on this thread, via. a review posted around Feb. 4th (I believe).  In addition a similar problem was reported on [...] regarding a different Samsung set.  If you are a cable or dish subscriber, this problem will not be an issue for you and I'm certain that you will be pleased with the performance of this set.BTW, I tried to contact Samsung by e-mail seeking a resolution with absolutely no response.

Picture is amazing on this set and I did a lot of comparing for weeks, maybe months. I wanted to go big intially (55\" and up) but ended up sticking to my original pricing of under 1000 dollars, which kudos to me as that is hard for me to do, lo1! Back to the picture for a few. Out of the box by default they had the \"torch\" effect going on and wow it was way off IMO. I spent a good 20 minuets setting it up to my liking and feel I have it where I need it. I have a PS3 for my BR playing and wow does it ever look amazing! First movie I went out and rented (Dont buy no more...) was Dispeciable me and my god the clarity, the colors, the blacks.....just unreal!(My 15 month son kept jumping at screen to try and touch the minons.) Almost looks 3D without glasses on...most would say that is bad, not in my case. You do need to adjust some stuff with the auto motion as when set to smooth and some others it gives you that soap opera effect, which drives me nuts! I shut it off on movies and turn it on for live sports, seems to work pretty well. Also if you game a lot, you will love this TV! I have never been more in love with my PS3! Like a lost love I havent saw in a long time....and yes I started getting bored with my PS3 as my Westinghouse HD el cheapo (Actually paid more for this set 5 years ago! :() LCD wasnt doing me any justice. Trust me, you will love this TV for gaming...Love the design, classy looking, not to skinny or fat, just perfect! Bezel is a nice gloss black and of course catches every onece of dust and this set does through off some glare. Most I have saw on any LCD unit, but my apartment doesnt have a lot of light, so that is okay....be aware though if you have a big lit room or windows with a lot of sun coming through might need to weigh some options. Thats what they make blinds for though...and lights can be turned off or some even dimmed. Remote is nice seems a lot of people harp on the remote, I actually think it is pretty neat! Has that feature where you can link it to control PS3, DVD player and supposedly cable box, but cant seem to get it to work on cable box. Like I said, still learning.As far as sound goes I have a good HT setup consisting of JBL/Polk 5.1 suround sound and Onkyo Dolby digital 1000 watt receiver and 10\" FI Q sub and honestly I am really impressed with the sound built into the TV. The speakers are on the back, so they reflect sound off the wall to give you the feel of surround sound and dont do a bad job considering. (I still use my 5.1 SS majority though...) but for people that dont want to spend more on a cheap or expensive SS setup, I believe most would be happy. I dont suggest wall mounting it though unless having a SS setup as I believe speakers wouldnt get ample space and may sound muffled.Only downside I have really noticed is I do sometimes get that light effect to where it dims then brightens again and no I am not talking about the ECO system to where it is supposed to do that. I have it shut off. Some reviews talk about bad capacitors going on these units and maybe it is just in my head, but I swear I notice it and only 3 weeks in. No worries as I bought this at Sam's Club and I have the one year manufracturing warraty and added Sam's 4 year to it for 79 smacks! So in good hands me thinks. Just the packing of it up and sending off....pain in whazoo!Overall, great experience thus far and so glad I finally decided on a better name brand than my Westinghouse. Night and day difference in picture and build quality, thus far...time tells all. My Westinghouse has lasted 5 years and still enjoy it as it is our bedroom TV now.Happy shopping friends, hope this helped someone.

I have the say both the TV and sound bar are awesome.  The only issue I've had is with interference with iR remotes and the power saving stuff on the TV.  Unless I have the TV's brightness set to normal and the energy conservation stuff off, my remotes barely function and when they do, often send the wrong signal.

The Samsung input button displays a menu and you have to navigate with the arrow buttons then select an input, it takes 4-6 button presses to change inputs (there are over a dozen inputs listed - fortunately the ones you use are near the top).Input DisplayI'm not sure when this displays but it seems like every time I change channels the TV displays information in the upper left corner for about 3-4 seconds. It displays the input (such as HDMI2), the input name, and the resolution of the input. I don't know how to turn it off.AnynetI don't know if it works with just Sumsung devices or all devices. I have a Samsung blueray player and when you turn it on the TV automatically switches to it. At first I thought this was a cool feature. But I don't always want to switch to the player when I turn it on, sometimes I like to let a disc run through the numerous previews before I want to watch so you have to go through the selecting an input process and if you are a little slow it switches back to the player and you have to start over. When you are done and turn the player off the TV doesn't go back to the last input - you have to go through the input selection process.

These are GREAT TVs while they work but they seem to only work for a year or two..... I was about to buy numerous more Samsung TVs (for a new home) but upon learning of this issue I absolutely will not and I cannot understand why anyone else would.This review is not about this specific TV - I want to be very clear upfront. However it is about a Samsung tv I purchased in June 2008 for $2,500. At the time that was what LN52A650 was priced. Today May 12, 2011 the TV started to experience a very common problem which many (if not all) Samsung TVs are experiencing no matter what model - the unit would click on and off rapidly and there was no way to stop it but to unplug it. Last night my tv was fine and this am it would just click on and off rapidly - so the tv is totally useless.Luckily and unusually for me, I happened to have purchased a 5 year extended warranty when I purchased the unit so I wasn't too upset - I am lucky my unit will be fixed for free but if I didn't purchase that warranty (which is usually a huge waste of money) I would be stuck with a repair bill between $200 and $500 (assuming I didn't want to try and fix it myself). The good news seems to be that the issue can be repaired and if you do it yourself it will cost under $40, but you have to risk messing up your tv. For TVs that now cost $1,500 (55\"-52\") no one should have to worry about the unit breaking in a year or two and then having to do a self repair versus paying a few hundred dollars.The reason I am writing this review is because I was about to purchase LN46C630 to view until my unit was fixed, and in addition because I need to purchase about 4 new tvs for a recent new home. I was actually EXCITED about purchasing Samsung units - well until today at least. Since I would be purchasing TVs in the next few months I figured why stress about the repair - I could get the 46\" set and use it until the repair is completed. This morning I had no idea the defect was so common and felt my TV would be out of business for a month or so - now that I know the issue is common I hope that won't be the case. Even though I absolutely love the picture quality of this TV I can in no way purchase another Samsung knowing they have this issue and it appears Samsung knows their TVs have this problem.If anyone can recommend a TV with picture quality like the Samsung I would appreciate it - I am really bummed I cannot buy Samsung anymore but why would someone want to hassle with this issue in a year or two?

After calling Samsung, a service appointment fixed the problem by replacing a board but not without paying $300 dollars. Samsung was unwilling to pay for the repair after just a year, largely because it was 4 months out of warranty. Last week, the TV started cycling on & off after about an hour of use. After doing my research on the issue, I found that the power cycle is apparently a known issue with Samsung TV's so I once again called Samsung and was told that more than likely I need to replace the inverter board which controls the power. I asked for a service discount based on the second hardware problem with the same TV but was told that because the service calls are managed independently, there is nothing they can do. I get the distinct sense that Samsung doesn't stand behind their quality product for very long.  Unfortunately, it just so happens that the nearest official Samsung repair center is 2 hours away so I end up paying for their service drive plus repair.Long story short, the Samsung TV's are a mixed bag.

You may end up with a panel that is viewable out of the box, but if you want a great picture it will take a long time (or a professional) to get it right. However, a lot of people own this TV and you can find some very good recommended settings on various forums that will give you a great picture.- Sound is very good but not exceptional. You can play with the sound presets to get decent audio but you're better off with external speakers. That said, in my opinion it does not underperform comparable TVs as far as sound goes.- There is a bit of a lag when accessing the menu to change picture settings, input, etc. This is not uncommon in TVs but it might be annoying for some people out there.- The DLNA is slow and crashes frequently. I can use it to watch movies no problem, but when I'm scrolling through pictures or trying to find that song, it is very slow and randomly crashes. This may have to do with the software I'm using on my computer, but I've tried a few different ones with similar results. Also, last I checked Samsung does not make their DLNA software for Mac (although there are OSX alternatives out there).PROS:- Excellent picture, especially in HD.- Beautiful hardware. Obviously not as sleek as the LCD Samsungs but also not nearly as expensive.- Makes that wonderful little Samsung jingle when you switch it on and off (unless the volume down to zero).- Excellent viewing angle, at least in my experience.I definitely recommend this TV.", "Date": "July 21, 2011"}, {"Title": "Pleased with purchase", "Author": "kennyg", "ReviewID": "R2LD9XG71MS66U", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I purchased this TV from Amazon in May, 2011.  I was looking for a 1080p TV that could fit into a limited wall-space; I selected this TV partially based on its slim bezel to maximize the screen space.Delivery was up to normal excellent Amazon standards.Setup was easy (standard wall-mount) and the inputs were easily accessible.  Turn-on time is limited to a few seconds and no silly title screen pops up prior to displaying input.  The menu system was logical (I've owned a few other Samsung TV's) although the amount of button pushing to advance to the final desired menu seems a bit redundant at times.The screen performance is very satisfactory. I was lucky and received an SQ panel.  Turned off the motion-flow except for PS3 input (where my Blu-rays are played) which I set to \"clear\" and am quite pleased with the results - excellent clarity and smooth transitions.  The TV is in a bright room and I don't have any complaints about light reflection (although my viewing is almost always limited to 90 degrees +/- 20 degrees).  The contrast level is good, although my brother-in-law (who has only owned plasma screens) thinks that it's noticeably less than his sets.  Haven't had any problems with uneven colors although I haven't put it through a color slide computer test -- I have watched a lot of sports and the green fields look even to me upon close inspection.I thought that the \"volume\" icon in the corner was strange at first, but now am quite pleased that it doesn't obstruct subtitles/sports scores/ticker tape news updates with its position.  I know that volume icons can be made semi-transparent, but I am a fan of the positioning in the left-hand corner where there is rarely anything significant displayed on screen.Sound is your typically \"adequate but not great\" standard.  Overall volume can be set quite loud, but conversational audio is oftentimes quite muted.  I have to place volume at \"25\" to really hear all conversations on a sit-com while I play video games at \"15\" with completely adequate sound effects.  My TV is stationed in a wall alcove, so maybe this is part of the problem.  Regardless, I use a receiver with 5 speakers so it's not much of a hindrance for me (although my wife does not like to turn on a separate receiver set to watch TV, so she just turns the TV volume up to 35 so that I get a heart attack the next time I return to play the PS3).I don't use the remote so can't comment too much about it other than it seems functional for the brief time I used it.Overall I'm very pleased with the TV; I think its display is rock-solid and its minimalist visual appeal is exactly what I wanted.  For this price range I personally think that one should get a great LCD screen instead of a average LED screen (not that I'm claiming to be an LED expert).", "Date": "July 18, 2011"}, {"Title": "Great TV!!!", "Author": "Ty Vernon", "ReviewID": "R2O8TOWGFTYQE9", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "So after some extensive research, I decided to go with the TV you are currently reading about.  I can happily say that I am very pleased with my decision.  I watch a lot of movies and TV's, so this purchase was not something I took lightly.  As it was my first foray into the flat panel market, I wanted to make sure I got a good one.  My previous/other TV is also a Sammy that I'm very pleased with, but it's a 56\" DLP rear projection.  The clarity and color of this TV is amazing.  I went to local retailers before purchasing this and compared it with many other TV's keeping in mind that the settings they had may not have been optimal.  There were other TV's that looked pretty good that may have been a little cheaper, but no matter which store I checked out, the Samsungs always looked great so I ultimately decided to go with this one.  To top it off, I was able to get a returned one from Amazon Warehouse details that said the back had minor surface damage.  I got this several months ago and I honestly don't even remember where the imperfection was supposed to be so this turned out to be a great deal for me.  I still haven't hooked it up to my surround system, so I've been watching it with the TV's speakers which get the job done.  It has plenty of connectivity, the menu is pretty easy to navigate, and I honestly haven't used the remote too much after I initially set everything up.  The viewing angle is pretty much a non-factor, the blacks are deep and the whites are bright.  In comparison to another brand at my parents' house, the image is much better in my opinion as the picture seems true to the film and color.  With the one at my parents' house, it is very clear, but something is a little off making it appear to be almost home-video like or even a little 3d whereas with this Samsung I get crystal clear HD and it feels like I'm watching what I'm supposed to be watching, i.e. a movie or TV.  (That may not make sense unless you've experienced what I'm describing.)  Finally, I've used it for a little bit of gaming and all of the above picture quality holds true there as well.Bottom Line: It costs a tad more than some other brands, but you're getting a product with a much higher guarantee of quality in my opinion.

In my opinion, this set hits the sweet spot of the HDTV technology without venturing too far into things like the 3D gimmick that some worry will fade with time. The picture settings will need to be tweaked out of the box for the best image, but a quick search online will give you some suggested settings that generate a near perfect result.So...why 4 stars? The Auto Motion Plus Stutter.I am not a user who will complain about the \"Soap Opera Effect,\" if anything, I actually like the feature and it was a factor in purchasing the TV. However, consumers should note that some TV's being delivered are experiencing a \"stutter\" or dropped frames when using the Auto Motion Plus feature. My TV happens to be one of those with this issue. The only time I don't see this issue is when using AMP with my blu-ray player (I have 3 sources that produce a stutter ---> Game Console, Cable TV, and Computer HDMI out). What I have been told by some is that the stutter occurs because some sources are \"compressed\" or are not strong enough for the AMP chip to process. To me, this would be OK if Samsung acknowledged the issue up front. But what makes the whole thing questionable is that many users are not having a problem with their TV. Cable? Smooth. Game Console? Smooth. Computer HDMI? Smooth. To me this discrepancy among models indicates an error with the TV and not the source. Some even claim the stutter only started AFTER updating the firmware on the TV. Sketchy much? I hope to do some more testing in a week when I receive my HD-DVR.If you Google \"auto motion plus stutter\" you will find countless threads and reports of various models having the issue. If you try to contact Samsung, like I did, you will get the run-around.\"It must be the source.\"\"Try turning the feature off and see if stutters\" (which of course it won't, but the point is I want the feature on).\"Auto Motion Plus is recommended for 24hrz and not 60hrz\" (where do they advertise this?)This is a known issue for Samsung, and they have refused to acknowledge it for all of the owners of 2008-2010 TV's. Unfortunately as warranties expire, the company will ultimately move on and fail to address the issue for those unlucky enough to be caught with one of these defective sets. Right now it appears no fix is in the works and won't be.So now... after all that complaining...why 4 stars and not 1? Because, the TV is still amazing. As a matter of fact, most people don't even like the AMP feature because of it's over-smooth movement. Though I am upset the feature doesn't work properly on mine, it is not a deal breaker by any means.

This specific model is satisfactory for me, though some things could be improved. The owner instructions manual wasn't very good.Sound is fine, but if you're looking for the best quality sound, you would need to buy a good surround sound system (this is especially relevant when you're watching a movie and want to get a movie-theater feel).The standard definition image isn't that great. The picture quality isn't better than a lower cost Samsung model, such as 720p. The picture quality is nice with an HD signal.While the design is modern, I would have preferred a lighter color than charcoal--like gray or silver for instance. i prefer to use the remote control, since the touch screen button on the bottom front panel could have been done better. It's hard to see, and is not as comfortable to use when I'm turning the TV on or adjusting the volume for instance.Whenever I change the contrast settings, the TV tends to later return to its default level 100 max. In other words, my changes aren't saved and I have to re-set the contrast again later. It must also be noted that the menu itself is a little bit complex.When I switch the source of signal from my dvd player to the TV, using the menu, it tends to take a little longer--something like thirty seconds to a minute.I like to use the PIP function, but it's not on the remote control and is only included on the menu.The picture quality is great when you're viewing the Tv from a straight angle, but isn't as good when you're watching the TV from an angular angle--like 20 or 25 degrees angles. the picture tends to become dim.Some of the pros:Modern designPicture and sound qualityECO sensorBacklit RemoteSwivel stand includedPlenty of inputSome of the cons (could be improved):Sound is good, but isn't the bestPicture is nice only with HD signal and max contrast settingsNot all buttons light up on the backlit remotethe Input/output is not for all older devicesSwivel stand is not stableMenu is a bit complicated to navigateNot full PIP functionDespite everything, I would feel comfortable recommending this TV to others, who are looking for a big flat screen TV.", "Date": "March 20, 2011"}, {"Title": "Awesome", "Author": "Eric", "ReviewID": "R26875H72XJHS", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Great value.

It's unusable at this point for over-the-air TV, so I'm going to have to try a new antenna. When I change channels it is very slow. I don't know if this is because of the bad signal from the antenna or if it's just slow all the time.My other complaint is that the sound is quite bad. After adjusting the sound settings, it is better than when I initially turned it on, but it's still not good.

Before purchasing, google \"Samsung flicker\" or \"Samsung capacitors\" (in each case, without the quotes). There is a lot of information on the Internet indicating that Samsung's off-shore manufacturers have used faulty capacitors in their unit power supply--apparently this problem affects both Samsung TV's and monitors. When this happens, you will not notice anything wrong at first, as it takes the capacitors time to fail (google \"capacitor plague\") but when they start failing you will experience flickering and dimness at first and can expect this to get worse over time and for the unit to finally completely fail.If you are lucky, you will have problems while the unit is still under warranty. However, the replacement unit you receive may have the same problems, and when it fails will almost certainly be out of warranty.My experience: Samsung replaced my unit on warranty, but the replacement unit they sent me failed (with the issues described) shortly afterwards and was \"out of warranty.\" While I didn't expect much I did call Samsung customer service to see if they had any program to address this. They do not. Once the warranty is over, you're on your own. At the price they quoted it really isn't worth fixing it, so it looks like I'm stuck with a very expensive paperweight.

I am very grateful that the 46\" C630 series comes with a matte screen.Some niggles would be that the screen bezel could be thinner, wished it came with built-in internet and have noticed some audio syncing issues, but hey, again, what you get for the price you pay can't be beat.Looks wise, the unit is very elegant. The C630 does have TouchofColor, but it is a very subtle charcoal gray (I can't stand the red/blue lights or the copper strip on this year's model, the D630)For gaming, I haven't really noticed any lag. Connected my PS3, change the HDMI output to Game mode and have been gaming lag free.DVD's look sharp and Blu-rays look amazing - make sure you have the unit set to do 1080p/24.Lastly, I have hooked my desktop PC to act as a HTPC. To connect, you must use either the 15 pin D-sub VGA or the DVI that is on HDMI 1. I used the amazon cable AmazonBasics HDMI to DVI  Adapter Cable (9.8 Feet / 3.0 Meters) to hook it up. As DVI-D does not carry the audio signal, you must use a 3.5mm audio cable and connect the cable into the Audio input on the back of the TV from the PC. From there, select DVI PC on the HDMI 1 info tab on the TV and you are good to go! Be fore warned - using the resolution of 1920 x 1080 on your desktop will make things very small and hard to read.

I believe the 55\" would have been too much and would have dominated the space.However, the delivery service from Pilot etal left much to be desired. I ordered the LN46C630 on 11/26/10 and was given an estimated delivery date of 12/6/10 to be delivered by Pilot.  After not hearing even so much as a peep out of the delivery service by 12/7/10, I decided to initiate a call to check the status.  The customer service representitive was very polite, but all she wanted to do was pass me off to a secondary delivery agent.  I contacted the secondary delivery agent (out of Kansas City) whom informed me that they had received the TV on Friday, December 3rd, but they claimed it was too late in the day to get the TV on the truck that for the next Monday's deliveries to Wichita.  I asked what kind of service to expect, and they stated the deilvery persons would bring the TV into the house, unbox it, plug it in to test it to make sure it worked.  Needless to say since the TV didn't make it on the truck or deliveries to Wichita for the week of December 6th, it didn't get delivered that week.  The secondary delivery agent stated they only send one truck per week to my location and it would be another week before I would receive delivery. On Monday, December 13th, I finally got a call from the secondary delivery agent...AT 9pm AT NIGHT.  They wanted to deliver the TV that night.  I said no way that they would have to deliver in the morning, but couldn't tell me when.  They called back even later that night at stated they would deliver at 7am in the morning on Tuesday, December 14th.  I agreed, but the next morning I got a call from the delivery guy at 7am and he stated he was across town and would be there in about a half hour.  So, I finally received delivery on Tuesday, December 14th at 7:30am...or 8 days after my delivery date.  However, when they delivered it they just brought it in the door and literally set it down 2 feet in inside the door.  Then they expected me to sign for it in two places...one place stated that I recieved it and another signature stipulated that it was delivered undamaged.  I told them I wasn't going to sign that is was delivered undamaged unless they unboxed it and proved to me that is wasn't cracked or damaged in any way.  They didn't even offer to unbox it.  I had to unbox it myself while they stood there.  I lifted the TV out of the box and looked it over then begrudingly signed that I received it undamaged.  Then I told the delivery guys that their customer service representitive stated that they would plug it in and make sure that it worked.  However, the delivery guy stated that the TV was on a freezing cold truck all night and that it should NOT be plugged in and turned on until the TV had a chance to warm up to room temperature.  After all of the delays and poor delivery service, I have begun to question if Amazaon is properly vetting the delivery companies or if they are just going for the cheapest to deliver agents.", "Date": "December 16, 2010"}, {"Title": "good buy for under $850", "Author": "daemon \"DMen\"", "ReviewID": "R2W12L0JGT2HZC", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Others have commented on features, however didn't see much on playing videos hosted on a PC to TV over a LAN.

Because let's be honest, there's alot of people out there that give reviews, but have no clue what they are talking about.There is a problem with certain models that Samsung has put out, and this is one of them.The problem that happens, is that if your Samsung TV seems like it's \"blurry\" or the picture seems like it's \"stuttering\" like it cannot catch up or it \"flickers\" simliar to what a candle does, it's NOT your eyes deceiving you.It's NOT - your video sourceIt's NOT - your HDMI cablesIt's NOT - your equipment you useIt's the TV.....plain and simple.Vary rarely should any TV do this unless, it is those items mentioned above.The Samsung company will not acknowledge the fact that there is something faulty with their TVs when it does this, and that is why there is a huge class action lawsuit against them.I personally have a four year old 46 inch samsung that I bought and that I love.  In year three of having the TV, the capacitors went bad and I started having purple dots on my screen and it would take forever to start up.  I called up samsung and they sent a tech out and replaced the capacitors for free.  It was so fast, that it took the tech longer to unscrew all the bolts from the back of the TV than it was to replace the capacitors.My only guess, it that with certain models of Samsung TVs, there's some kind of \"chip\" or \"video processing\" problems associated with the boards they use inside certain TVs they produce.Do I hate Samsung - NOI wanted to keep the TV, but I couldn't because of all those issues stated above.A long time eletronics store salesman told me \"When buying samsung TVs, it's either hit or miss.  Some customers never have problems with them, other have problems one-by-one, like a waterfall effect\".So.....GO AHEAD....buy it!!!!Your getting a \"Great Deal\"......and then when you start experiecing problems down the road with it, remember.....You've been warned.Good Luck!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!", "Date": "May 27, 2011"}, {"Title": "Beter than expected", "Author": "John R.

The sound is horrendous. Very dificult to understand-sounds like its coming from a tin can. I can't fathom why a so called premium HDTV can have such horrible sound. We turn on the sound from our $99 13 inch no name Tv and turn off the sound of the Samsung. I not only paid a lot more for this supposedly premium TV, but now I have to also purchase a sound system the costs almost as much as the TV. Had I known this I would have purchased a lower cost HDTV and put the money saved into a sound system. Samsung you should be ashamed to put your name on this junk.", "Date": "January 13, 2011"}, {"Title": "Very Happy!", "Author": "Craig Heuerman", "ReviewID": "R28SVZ9ZDPBA3A", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Amazes me that the delivery company would deliver, or try to deliver a damaged product.Purchased this TV after reading the reviews. Waited over a week and thankfully I had it opened with the delivery guys still here. The screen was destroyed, looked like someone put a forklift arm thru it. If you order and use the Amazon set up make sure they open it before they go. I would have reorderd from Amazon but after waiting 10 days then the damaged set arrives they made no effort to get me another one any faster then another 10 days. Still have not seen my refund....I found the TV locally which made the family happySo for the TV, it is everything that all the other people have stated who rated it 5 STARS. The picture is fantastic. I had a Samsung DLP for 9 yrs and loved it, but this is hands down a better picture. In fact some shows and movies almost look fake because the picture on the set is so good. Not sure if that makes sense but that's the only way I can think to describe it.Tons of picture adujustment so I have a lot to work with but out of the box it's fantastic. No issue with glare as some have mentioned but the room it is in does not get direct sun. The sound seems decent but I only listened for a short time before I hooked up to my sound system. All in all I am totally happy with my choice..", "Date": "July 23, 2010"}, {"Title": "Picture sometimes looks fake", "Author": "JGrath \"JGrath\"", "ReviewID": "RFK7XD7W18CSE", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "I think the 120 Hz technology is at fault as to why I don't like the tv.  Particularly movies that are on tv channels looked very fake on this tv.  It looked more like you are watching actors on a stage than a movie.  It's hard to explain but once I got the tv and noticed the problem I googled the fakeness of the picture and found a lot of other people complaining.  I talked to a guy at Best Buy and he agreed that he had a 120Hz tv and he turns that feature off because he doesn't like it either.  So why buy the \"newer technology\" if you are just going to disable it.  Save yourself some money and get a 60 Hz tv.  I'm returning this one and getting a 60 Hz.", "Date": "May 7, 2010"}, {"Title": "Nice", "Author": "C.

After talking with a customer service rep, the company is investigating why this is so, but gave no explanation. Also, most HDMI cables are only rated for 60 HZ so it must transform the signal into 120 HZ which causes changes in the picture.

The problem with the piece was that the LCD screen remained blank after switching the TV on. I called Samsung Support, who registered the complaint and confirmed that someone from technical support will call and set up an appointment. But their tech support never called back. I then called up Amazon and requested a replacement. Amazon support confirmed that this product can be replaced for no charge but due to a bug in their system they are unable to order a replacement. I then asked them to cancel the order. The shipping agency is a little inflexible in terms of pickup timing. They work 5 days a week and I had to stay home on the day of pickup.

The sound is really poor, using built-in speakers.  I called Samsung complaining about poor sound, they didn't like hearing it. Poor AVC...audio volume goes weak then strong and never the same strength when changing channels.  One reason for poor sound, Samsung says, is internal speakers face backward, so if you have TV up against wall, sound hits wall. If they know this, why don't they mount them forward...?  Owners instruction manual is absurdly poor.  Written on cheap paper, small draft-quality text, poor descriptions, and ridiculously inferior setup information.  Shame on Samsung.  (This set is made in Mexico.....that explains a lot ! ).  If you want good owner manuals, look to Panasonic, Visio, Toshiba, etc...but not Samsung...!  The Samsung remote control is cramped & limited...! One good feature is picture quality and color tone when you use the 'Natural' setting....which is the closest thing to natural skin tone I've seen on any TV...and the sharpness is excellent....sharp, crisp, clear picture....just beautiful when watching the nature programs...!", "Date": "April 27, 2010"}, {"Title": "Full-screen display problem", "Author": "Jingjing Qiu \"JQ\"", "ReviewID": "RGBG5TT5Q6KYR", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "Sound and picture quality looks great, but the picture is not in full-screen! there are two black strips on the top and bottom sides,and the display area of screen looks like a narrow band!", "Date": "April 13, 2010"}, {"Title": "Price in cart no not till you click PLACE ORDER", "Author": "dlb \"blue\"", "ReviewID": "R2P49PB8ZXR2CV", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "How UNCOOL and not likely this TV is to be sold when you are not allowed to see the PRICE UNTILL YOU CLICK PLACE ORDER..
