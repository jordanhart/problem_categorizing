{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Every bit as good as I expected", "Author": "Jamie", "ReviewID": "R1XHSILHZ397DF", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This review is a little long winded.  Skip to the bottom for just the pros and cons.  Or, keep reading to waste 10 minutes of your life.Over the last 5 years, I have been using a 58\" Panasonic Plasma TV.  Not a bad TV, but not the greatest either.  It was only 1080i, it got hot pretty fast (which made the room hot and the air condition kick on too often), and the dimensions were weird (I looked at entertainment centers that should fit a 60\" TV, but the TV still wouldn't fit.).  I felt an upgrade was in order.I'll have to admit, shopping for a TV was pretty fun.  A lot of work though.  The research was overwhelming at times.  Websites upon websites, magazines, books, different people's inputs, salesmen trying to sell you different things depending on which store you went to, etc.  I narrowed it down to one of many Sony HDTVs or a Samsung C or D series.  After narrowing it down to those 2 brands, it was a little easier.  I went to about 4 different Fry's Electronics and 7 different Best Buys to check it out in different situations.  After that, it came down to the UN55D8000 (boy, did I memorize those numbers).  To make the decision easier, I was looking on Amazon, and to my amazement, they had it for $500 less that everyone else, plus free shipping.  Score!With the free shipping, it usually takes a little longer.  I would say, from the time the order was placed, until it got to my front door, it took about 1.5 weeks.  It came delivered from Home Direct, USA and had no issues with delivery.  They were going to set up the TV, but I told them not to, since my entertainment center hadn't come in yet.  I opened up the box, put the TV on a soft cloth (our bed's comforter) and installed the stand.  Eight screws, piece of cake.  I connected the Directv receiver and a PS3.  There are a few settings you will set in the beginning when the TV turns on.  Takes about 2 minutes, literally.  After that, the fun begins!  Going from 1080i to 1080p is a huge difference!  I had a recording of Chuck on the DVR and it almost looked live.  I also watched some regular satellite programming and even the non-HD channels looked amazing.After wiping the drool off the floor, I wanted to check out the 3D part of the TV.  I popped in the free copy of Shrek the 3rd  in the PS3, put on the glasses and waited to be amazed.  Aside from the amazing colors, it looked exactly like 2D!  WTH?!  Then, I remember reading somewhere that the PS3 does indeed play 3D movies, BUT with an upgrade.  I waited about 30 minutes for the upgrade to finish.  After that, loaded up the dvd again, and there was the movie with that funky 3D image.  Hey wait, I have 3D glasses on, how come I see that.  Oh, oops.  Batteries need to be installed in the glasses.  Finally!  The 3D image was awesome!  Seriously, watching TV in 3D is amazing.  I can't wait `til there's more media in 3D.  As it stands right now, the only real movies in 3D are either documentaries or cartoons, with the exception of a few regular movies (i.e. Resident Evil, Step Up 3, etc.)I just set it up last night, so I can't give you a whole lot more information.  But, even if I did have more time, I don't think I can give you the detailed specs that you might be looking for.  I'm not an expert on home theater.  Here's an overview of pros and cons:PROS:* The lack of a bigger bezel really does make a difference.  Not only aesthetically, but in terms of functionality, too (better 3D viewing.  It looks like you're looking thru a window.).* Images are spectacular.  Whether it be regular programming, HDTV programming, or Blu-Ray.* Price on Amazon was very good!* Delivery was pain-free.* A lot of settings options, so you can set up the TV to your preference and the viewing scenario (i.e. movie, standard, etc.)* 3D movie watching is stunning!  I just wish Panasonic didn't have exclusive rights on Avatar.CONS:* SmartTV is a cool feature.  But, not a necessity.  I really doubt that I'll Facebook or Tweet from the TV.* Audio isn't great, but it's adequate.  I wasn't really expecting much from a flat screen TV.* Did not come with the touch-screen remote as was supposed to be the case in the beginning of the year.* Have to mail in the vouchers (or register online) in order to get the 3D glasses.  True, you do get a 3D starter kit with this TV, which has the glasses, but those glasses are a little different and use batteries.  Also, you have to send out to get the free copy of Shrek Forever and Megamind.  I really shouldn't complain, though, since these are free.* Needs a more detailed manual on how to use most of the features.  The manual it comes with is thick, but it's just because it's the same thing in different languages.Sorry for the long review.  Us Yelpers write a lot of gibberish, don't we?UPDATE:  After playing around with the TV a little more this weekend, I noticed that the top of the screen had some light flickering (around where the bezel meets the screen and it was about 1/16\" tall and went almost across the whole TV.  I'm hoping it's not the \"edge lighting.\")  It only did this on some channels on Directv.  Most channels were fine and Blu-Ray was fine.  I'm thinking it's either the receiver or possibly the cheap HDMI cable.  I have a Monster M1000 series cable coming in later this week, so I'll switch it out and update.Also, there has been talk all over online about people having problems pairing the remote.  I had zero problem and did it about 5 feet away from the TV.One last thing, one of the glasses in the free 3D kit didn't seem to work.  I changed out batteries and nothing.  Then, the next morning, I tried it again, but this time turning off the bluetooth in my phone, and it worked.  Whether this had an effect on it, I don't know.  But, just thought I'd throw that out there.BTW, this weekend, I watched Tangled in 3D and played MLB2K11 on the PS3...... WOW!  I'll have to admit, I liked 3D, but I thought it was just a novelty.  No way.  3D is much different now than when we had those blue and red glasses.  It changes the whole experience.UPDATE #2:  Didn't have to do anything to get the line gone.  It just went away one day.Also, I finally got the 3D glasses from the voucher that's in the TV.  Unfortunately, they are the 3300s and not the 3700s that I kept seeing from people at CES.  I won't knock the rating down, but I am a little disappointed that the glasses and the remote that were advertised earlier in the year didn't come with the unit, nor even thru mail.  Also, the charger for the glasses is $199!  No, thanks.  I'll just charge it using the USB cable.", "Date": "April 2, 2011"}, {"Title": "It was a great TV until notice the screen uniformity issue", "Author": "Josetron", "ReviewID": "R11ZO0F50XTZO", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I have been playing with this TV for one week, the image a color accuracy was great until I notice there is a white halo in the left and right side of the TV. After reading other users and expert reviews, seems like the screen uniformity problem is persistent.I chat with Samsung representative and this is what they told me: Please wait for a Samsung Agent to respond. You are now chatting with 'Dennis'. There will be a brief survey at the end of our chat to share feedback on my performance today. Your Issue ID for this chat is LTK4380954317XDennis: Hi, thanks for reaching out to Samsung tech support. How can I help you today?Visitor: Yes I bought a UN55D8000 TV,Dennis: Okay.Visitor: have a problem with the image, there is a white halo when watching dark scenesDennis: Where is this located on the screen?Visitor: left side (more intense) and right side (less intense), middle (center) looks fineDennis: Is it on the corners that you can notice this?Visitor: no, more like a vertical line from top to bottomVisitor: but is not exactly a line, it's a haloDennis: Please set the TV to Standard or Movie picture mode and lower the backlight to 7.Dennis: Use the TV with this setting for 3 weeks.Dennis: This should go away.Visitor: tell me more why?Dennis: This occurs when the LED screen emits more light.Visitor: are the LED supposed to emit less light after three weeks?Dennis: Using the TV with these settings will eliminate the excess light.Visitor: yes, but it doesn't look good since doesn't have enough lightDennis: Please change the settings and try this for at least 2 weeks.Visitor: can't understand why 2-3 weeks? what happen after? can I go back and use whatever setting I want?Dennis: Yes, you can change the settings after two to three weeks.Visitor: Ok, just to let you know, I will post this in Amazon ratings, if this is not a fix I will say so... Samsung doesn't say this to customer when sell the TV and this seems to be a problem with the design of the TV itself...Dennis: These are the troubleshooting steps that we can try for this issue.Dennis: We are not suggesting you to use the TV with these settings for ever.Visitor: Ok, I will try...thanks.I will try and let you know, although I'm considering returning it given this is a very pricey TV...UPDATE: Here is an update on the troubleshooting suggested by Samsung on screen uniformity...I don't see material improvement using the setting that Samsung's representative suggested, and honestly don't think it will make any difference (or at least I do not understand why would be better just changing the setting temporarily). I could wait another week but don't have more time to wait before having my window to return... so I have finally decided to return it since the white halo doesn't go away and this TV is just too expensive to have this type of problem... if this TV would be $1500 or less, I would keep it for sure.To be very balance in my review, still think the colors are great and the exterior design of the TV is the best I have ever seen, but it seems like this great exterior design is the one creating the screen uniformity due to the thin bezel...I have also notice two additional minor issues with this TV, motion blur issues on fast pace scenes and the remote control range which is relatively short (8 feet or so).So I'm switching to a recently announced Samsung PND8000 which is supposed to be top rated plasma... same interface and remote control than the UND8000, I will write a review once I get the chance to play with it...", "Date": "June 8, 2011"}, {"Title": "Not quite ready for prime time, in some respects", "Author": "Phil in MIdland", "ReviewID": "RU8QP16M17IUE", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I wanted to give this TV a glowing review; after all, it has some of the latest LED technology, and the style is trend setting. After a week with this TV, I am less than satisfied with the 'Samsung Experience'. Let me get this off my chest first. Did you ever go to an event, like a county fair, early, when not all the rides and attractions were open? You're excited because it looks like it can be a lot of fun, but it's just a bit too early for the full experience. Well, that's the way I feel about this TV. First of all, the 3d glasses that are supposed to ship with this TV were not in the box. Instead, there is a voucher you may mail in, or go online to order (which I did). After a week and no response, I called to find out why the delay. I was told to read the voucher's fine print, which said there was a 10-12 week wait for the glasses. Not good. Secondly, I found an issue with the remote control unit, which is not a fun thing to have in your hand. It is sort of short and stubby, with two sides. One side has a QWERTY keyboard for text entry, and a touch-sensitive pointer. I find that the up, down, right, left controls do not work correctly with my unit, and called support to report this. They seemed very interested in the matter and told me they would call back in 45 minutes (after they set up a testing unit) for further info. There was no call back. Another reviewer mentioned the difficulty in pairing the remote with the TV, via Bluetooth. I also found this to be a problem and not consistently easy to do.Samsung has incorporated a feature called Smart Hub into their 'Smart TV'. This is a portal that has Netflix, Vimeo, YouTube, Facebook, Pandora, a web browser, and several games and applications that are either free or paid for. The feature is nice and I look forward to seeing it develop. You need to register your TV and create an account, similar to an Apple ID, before you can purchase any of the apps. You would think you could do this from the TV, but you can't; you need to go online to do this. Not a big deal, but it was confusing. The Samsung website is not ready for prime time either. The discussion board is not yet running. One nice thing is the Live Help, which works VERY well. However, I was not able to get the level of help I needed.Okay, enough with the gripes. This is one fine TV. It is very light, has a narrow profile and includes a nice, chrome-plated stand that lets you to rotate the TV about 30 degrees in either direction. A big factor for me was the thin bezel, which allowed me to fit a 46\" set into my 43\" wide cabinet. The TV has plenty of inputs, including some strange connectors that let you to connect component and composite video. I do have a non-HDMI DVD that uses the component connectors, and it worked well. The setup of the TV is not difficult if you have some experience with hookups, and I was able to get all the components and my receiver working in short order. As I mentioned above, I am not a big fan of the shape of the remote, and I am trying to duplicate most of the functionality in my Harmony universal remote.One thing I did was hook up my TV to my iMac to show photos to my photo club. I was not expecting the quality to be better than my 27\" iMac, but it was FAR better. The color was most natural in Movie mode, Warm 1 setting. The sharpness was uncanny. I saw no obtrusive artifacts on the screen and was pleased as punch at the jaw-dropping quality of my photo images (and so were the club members). The TV is connected to our UVERSE system, and the HD quality is very good. I have no measurement or calibration tools, but I have a fine eye for photography. The color balance, contrast, and sharpness are excellent. The only thing I need to get a handle on is the 'Film mode', which can turn watching Modern Family into a strange experience; it almost makes some programs look like they were videotaped like a soap opera. I leave this feature 'off' for the time being. Tonite we watched the 10 Commandments (1956), and the quality was incredible! I have yet to see any Blue Ray DVDs, as I haven't purchased a player yet. And, of course, I don't have the glasses for 3D. I do plan to update my review as these things change.This TV merits at least a 4-star rating. I may add another depending on how things develop.Update 6/8/2011Finally received my 3d glasses from the 'Samsung Fulfillment Center'. They are active-shutter type glasses and come with standard USB cords to charge them. You can plug the cords into the back of the set and the glasses will recharge when the set is ON. We watched our first 3D movie together last night. The 3d effect was excellent and I could see no artifacts. The glasses fit over my lenses and were comfortable. They turn on automatically when they sense a 3d broadcast, which is nice.The chunky remote usually just sits waiting to be used, as I have programmed a Harmony Universal remote to allow me to use SmartHub and control most of the functions. SmartHub is still evolving and there are many update messages that indicate it is constantly upgraded. I do enjoy the Vimeo and Vudu sites, as well as Netflix. The gamed, browser and other 'apps' are not appealing to me yet.I continue to laud the picture quality on this set. I can't say it is better than a Sony or Panasonic or other brand, but I have no reason to look further. I can only describe the HD quality as 'rich' and brimming with tonality. The shadow detail amazes me, and the blacks are truly black. I never find the the picture to be overly contrasty or saturated. I also find no reason to fiddle with the controls, once they are set. After over a month of viewing, I still find myself saying 'that's remarkable' when I watch high quality broadcasts. Again, I use ATT Uverse as my cable provider, and our signal quality is very good. I don't expect to buy another TV of this caliber for a good long time, and feel confident that this Samsung will grow with us for years to come.Update 11/18/11After months of use, I still like this TV. Samsung, it appears, is trying to be like Apple and even sent me a survey ploying me with questions about why I liked Apple computers, iPads, iPods, etc. I can see they are trying to formulate a strategy. Let me say that SmartHub is their way of giving TV users an 'app' experience. It has fallen short IMHO. The apps they have are rather cheesy and I'd rather use an iPad while watching TV, than switch to Smarthub and turn off the programming. Another failing, they don't give you access to Amazon streaming for movies (they used to, but not in the 2011 TVs). Why? AppleTV is a good accessory for Netflix, Youtube, and many other features and it has a far better interface. The only thing I like about SmartHub is the 'Explore 3D' feature that has several creative 3D features on it. With the current dearth of 3D source material on DVD, it's nice to have a handy place to experience it and show it to friends. You should really check that out.One negative on this TV, the viewing angle. If you are off-axis, the picture washes out and you lose the experience of seeing really deep blacks.", "Date": "April 23, 2011"}, {"Title": "Great LED TV", "Author": "M. Lo", "ReviewID": "R2Z7IQFKSH537R", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "So back to my bread and butter for reviewing - TV's!So I purchased the UN55D8000 even after hearing numerous complaints of screen uniformity issues. Why? I was looking for a TV that was about 4' wide and light enough I could mount it myself. Mind you it didn't hurt that this TV had the aesthetics of a modern art masterpiece. Ok so on to the review...Having had the TV for over 2 weeks - Here are some observations. Picture Quality is great, colors are vibrant, blacks are really deep.I've tested the 3D on here as well as the blacks using Tron Legacy 3D.Tested Gaming with my Xbox and Gears of War 3.Tested HD movie viewing with various movies, most recently the Bluray release of Star Wars complete Saga.So what can I say about the TV?Overall I am amazed with the picture sharpness, vibrant colors, and deep blacks.I do have some complaints, most notably the price... I was fortunate enough to find this on sale at Bestbuy (aka Worst Buy) for $1979 with free 3D Bluray player and 3D starter kit. The Tv comes with 2 glasses in the box so having spent under $2K pretax for the TV, 4 glasses, bluray player, and Megamind + Shreks 1-4 was a good deal. As of the writing of this review I noticed the price jump back up to $2079 (no freebies) here at Amazon and at Worst Buy. Sorry for the aside...Other things I noticed - Sound - Though vastly improved from prior LED's and LCD's the sound is something that suffers due to the design. You just can't get quality sound in such a svelte package.Last item to note 3D performance. I have the PN58C8000 (Last year's Samsung Plasma high end) which had good 3D picture. When I compare the C8000 to this TV - it appears last years Plasma (C8000) is still superior to this TV in terms of 3D performance. I noticed more flicker and image \"ghosting\" when off angle. Meaning that only the person at dead center or persons near dead-center will enjoy the 3D on this unit. Now I must admit, I am not sure if its the TV or the change in 3D technology. Last year Samsung used an IR (infrared transmitter); This year Samsung is using bluetooth. So I can't say its a true apples to apples comparison.Other thoughts...Smart Features - Wow is everything \"smart\" these days? Well I used the apps - they are fairly slow and a pain to use as a result. If you want a video streaming service (use a separate item like AppleTV, Xbox, PS3, Roku). I also seemed to have problems using other DLNA compliant items (Read Windows Home Server) to play video on the TV over the network - appears this TV is very picky on the movie formats it will play over DLNA (like the PS3).So performance - Out of the box the Picture Quality (PQ) is very good. Once I calibrate it I will share in an update.Setup - If you've set up a computer recently its pretty straightforward - appreciate the built in WiFi for network connectivity.SUMMARY:Overall 4/5 starsPros:*Picture Quality - sharp image, vibrant colors, deep black level*Design - Samsung's \"One\" Design is stunning. I must say its the most visually stunning design and minimalistic*Smart Features - If you dont have another box, you can stream video using many popular online streaming servicesCons:*Price - The plasma at a larger size is actually less costly I usually go bang for the buck, in this case due to the numerous picture uniformity issues I have been hearing about I must note that, I must admit I only saw it while watching Thor (and I am looking for it)*Sound - Well this goes without saying most TV's these days don't have the rich sound they once had.*3D viewing - If you buy this to primarily watch 3D you will have \"ghosting\" at off center viewing angles.**Update**All credit to CNET - I will do my own THX calibration when I get a chance.[...]Found the calibration settings - NOT on AVSforums, but CNET per their review--Picture menuMode: MovieBacklight: 10Contrast: 96Brightness: 51Sharpness: 0Color: 47Tint: G50/R50Screen adjustment submenu:Picture Size: Screen FitPosition: [no change]Auto Adjustment submenu: [Grayed out]Advanced settings submenu:Black tone: OffDynamic contrast: OffGamma: -1Expert Pattern: OffRGB Only Mode: OffColor space: CustomWhite Balance: [see below]10p White Balance: OnFlesh tone: 0Edge enhancement: OffMotion Lighting: OffxvYCC: OffLED Motion Plus: CinemaColor Space submenu:Red: Red 59, Green 0, Blue 0Green: Red 10, Green 55, Blue 10Blue: Red 0, Green 6, Blue 61Yellow: Red 53, Green 50, Blue 0Cyan: Red 4, Green 49, Blue 50Magenta: Red 37, Green 4, Blue 41White balance submenu:R-Offset: 19G-Offset: 18B-Offset: 20R-Gain: 31G-Gain: 29B-Gain: 2410p White Balance submenu:Interval 1: Red 2, Green 2, Blue 2Interval 2: Red -1, Green -1, Blue -1Interval 3: Red 1, Green 1, Blue 0Interval 4: Red 3, Green 3, Blue 2Interval 5: Red 6, Green 4, Blue 3Interval 6: Red 7, Green 6, Blue 4Interval 7: Red 5, Green 6, Blue 4Interval 8: Red 3, Green 3, Blue 2Interval 9: Red 1, Green 1, Blue 0Interval 10: Red -2, Green 0, Blue -1Picture options submenuColor tone: Warm2Digital Noise Filter: OffMPEG Noise Filter: OffHDMI black level: Normal [grayed out]Film mode: Off [grayed out]Auto motion plus: Custom-- Custom settings:Blur reduction: 10Judder reduction: 0Smart LED: StandardCinema Black: On", "Date": "September 25, 2011"}, {"Title": "SmartHub does not support 5.1 surround sound", "Author": "Lee A.

But here's what they don't tell you  -- Samsung SmartTVs don't support 5.1 surround sound from any video or audio sources that originate through their SmartHub. You only get two channel stereo.In other words, audio from the above sources is sent from the TV back to your home theatre system via either the HMDI 2 connection which has an Audio Return Channel (ARC) or from the Optical Digital Audio Output connection if your AV receiver doesn't support ARC.Either way, the TV only sends two channel stereo to your AV receiver for any content that you stream from the internet or any of your network devices using SmartHub or content that you connect to this TV via a USB device.I confirmed all of this with Samsung Tech Support on 9/21/2011.This is a real disappoint.

They were misled by Amazon's picture and possibly the CES information that had shown a smaller bezel. Apparently, from what I've found, Samsung decided the smaller frame couldn't support the size and went with an almost 2\" brushed metal-looking frame. I have a \"fleckstoned\" gray wall and it disappears when the lights go down. Honestly, once past the cool factor of the small bezel is put aside, the TV really shines, in my humble opinion.THE QUICK GOODS:1. Awesome looking picture. Not too hard to get settings online to home calibrate it nicely.2. Good 3D picture. Megamind is awesome on this. Also watched Sanctum, Tron, and Avatar. All good. The 2D to 3D is kinda cool too. Its not the pop-out you get with a 3D movie, but it does a nice job on the fly.3. The Smart Hub is intriguing. There is a lot there. Other than Netflix, I haven't gotten too involved in it, but I can see potential.4. The QWERTY keyboard on the backside is handy for trying to insert passwords and when using the net.5. Multiple inputs are great.THE QUICK BADS:1. Flashlighting. The TV has it. It is apparent when the screen is all black. Fortunately, that is rare and 95% of the time, you don't detect it at all. I think this is overblown in some write-ups.2. The web browser. It seems really slow- and I have it hooked up through a wired connection (faster than wireless). I can get to websites fairly quickly, but getting video to roll is another thing.3. Soap opera look. Many had commented on this and I had no idea what it was. It is that video-like image that is almost too clear out of the box. I used some calibration settings I found at Cnet to get some better settings.4. NO PAPER MANUAL. You pay this kind of money and you have to get the info through the TV or online? That is a bunch of BS.5. The price itself. Man, I love the TV, but I just am not sure if it is $1500.00 better than the mid=priced sets.  Overall, I can clearly say this was a monster step up from the 55\" Hitachi I had before. HD channels and especially Blu-ray look just stunning on the TV. Everything just pops. I feel many of the reviews here are focusing on the \"bait and switch\" they think happened because of the bezel. Fortunately, I did my research first and knew what I was getting.  There are plenty of ports in back and you should have plenty to get all of your stuff connected. If you really want to do it right, just run everything through a receiver and run one hdmi cable to the tv. If you choose to run multiple cables, you can even have different settings for each port. If you like your TV to pop, but want your movies to look more cinema-like, you can do that too.  Hanging the d8000 on the wall wasn't too hard. I did it myself, but I'd suggest a partner. I used a slim wall mount that tilts and it looks great.EDIT UPDATE: Just am FYI, the flashlighting issue is becoming easier to recognize as time rolls on.

Upon having the television mounted and installed (after testing that it worked), I watched it for about an hour. At some point in that time, the entire left half of the screen turned purple. I spoke with Samsung directly, as the item had a warranty. I called them at least 4 times, twice having it escalated, to no avail. Every time I received the same answer, \"We have recorded your issue, and will have a partnering repair company contact you\". Days go by, no call; over and over. Then finally I decide to contact their partnering repair company myself. But only after having them repair the television, return it, and having it not work again, did I get the explanation from the repair company of the procedure. Here it is: Basically the repair company has to call Samsung with the diagnosis, and Samsung determines what parts they are to use to repair it, and then they send them. Sounds fine, only that Samsung is trying to complete this warranty repair in the cheapest possible way. So, as much time as it takes going back and forth with repairs is what they are going to do.

I was allowed to enter the calibration settings found on AVS forums which seemed to improve things a bit.Some notes about my viewing experience:2d looked very good. But I am buying this for 3d.Fast moving 3d exhibited ghosting, I confirmed the image was coming off a 3d blu-ray player, I felt like my eyesight was blurring when trying to follow the action.There was terrible vertical banding about every 15% of the screen. About 5 vertical bands across the whole screen, mostly visible during brighter scenes. WTH?I will try going to another best buy, but honestly too many reviews on-line are saying the same thing about this whole D8000 line.Ugg, I wanted to get this amazing TV with thin bezel into my house.  Very sad indeed.-------------------UPDATE:::So I went to another Bestbuy about 50 miles away.  They also had this 55 inch unit so I asked to get a 3d movie playing and was able to calibrate it OK. I was there about 1 hour also.On this unit, the vertical banding was not as bad as on the 1st unit above, but I could definitely see small DOTS on the top of the screen, which appeared to be the light diffusion layer cut off points. I pointed this out to the sales floor manager and he had not noticed this until I mentioned it. He agreed it did not look good.I also was able to watch more 3d content from different demo discs on the show floor; one from Panasonic and one from Samsung. My honest experience was that I could not watch more than about 5 minutes of the 3d without feeling like something wasn't natural about the whole experience.I think movies may look better since they have controlled panning, but many fast action demos, like surfing and underwater fish swarms were not pleasing to the eye for more than a few minutes. Of course, the wow factor is there and that pulls you in to want to see more.I go to CES every year and the only demos all over the CES show floor have mainly been of slow moving flowers and trains pulling into stations, and similar. Nothing fast paced like in the demos I was watching.At this stage I am again saddened by Samsung's quality control and the overall 3d experience. I really wanted to love this and upgrade my 46 Samsung with this 55 inch model.------------------------------ANOTHER UPDATE:Went to a third best buy, against my better judgment.Saw another 55 D8000 and did the same setup the color settings. 2d was looking very nice, no problems here.Picture was great, 3d was much better now, no ghosting, since I was actually allowed to load a real 3d movie and not some lame 3d demo disc meant for impulse shoppers. We watched \"Despicable Me\" in 3D for about 10 minutes, which I had seen last week in 2d so I knew what to expect.I proceeded to put on the 3d specs, they had two pairs of the expensive rechargeable units, so my wife could watch along side me; [note: the cheaper button-battery specs seem better since they block the side light out]After a few minutes of the opening titles, uhh-oohh... My wife and I could clearly see 2 verticle lines about 1.5 inches thick running down the 33% and 66% positions of the screen. The manager thought I was nuts until he put on the specs. We paused the video and even tried another disc.  He said this was odd. He had never seen this issue since he had never tried on the 3d specs to this specific TV after it was installed. Just to be clear again, the 2d looked flawless.In summary, I am done with this TV. It cannot possibly be a good sign that three different 'store display' 55's and also a 65' D8000's have similar issues, within a 150 mile radius. To anyone who is skeptical, I got other employees to confirm each event, just to make sure I was not seeing some reflection or otherwise; we all confirmed these were indeed display problems each time.Again, love the thin bezel and the 2d, but the 3-D brought out a similar [back light ?] defects seen now on 3 55d8000s, I even tried a 65 D8000, it was worse on that set. I love Samsung, but geez..I'll be waiting on the next line from Samsung [E8000 ?], I think they need to drop this edge-lit stuff or something.  AVSforums is having a field day with these defects as well, it's not just me.If you don't believe me, ask me what Best Buys I went too and I will gladly reply to you with the city names in California and the employee I spoke too.Funny note: The 1st store where we saw the verticle light banding on their 65 last week, mostly visible through 3d, had the TV removed from the direct 3d blu-ray feed and is now moved to another wall on the 2d multiplex TV feed; perhaps to not show the TV's defects to perspective buyers.Buyer beware.F.", "Date": "July 31, 2011"}, {"Title": "Inconsistent picture forced me to return set", "Author": "somagish", "ReviewID": "RS0H9VHD6Q4NE", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "After one week of trying to watch this TV I had to return the product.

While there I saw last years model of this TV. While very nice i have an all black metal stand for my tv, so i though the thick silver bezel would stand out. I talked to an associate and they told me about the new 2011 model. Once i saw it i knew it was the TV i wanted. I did some shopping around and found Amazon had the best price overall. i was a bit skeptical about making such a large purchase and ordering online.I have heard some complaints about the companies used to ship the TVs. I have to say i had a good experience. The delivery was made in the first hour of my delivery appointment window. The box of the tv was a little damaged in the bottom corner but nothing to worry about.my TV was brought inside and I inspected it and wow is this thing a work of art. even the delivery guys were impressed, they hadn't seen the new model yet. The tv was a little cold from being stored in the warehouse and on the truck so i assembled everything and hooked up all my extras (home theater, xbox 360, ps3, cable box etc) but i didn't plug the power in for about 2 hours to let the TV warm up and avoid damage to it. Once i turned it on i was greeted with an easy and simple to follow setup of the tv and wireless network.I have read one poor review of this tv stating the led backlight was visible fromt the edges and i have to disagree. i cannot see the backlight source at all. this is by far the best looking tv on the market. I do however wish it had full array led backlighting rather than the dynamic edge.my only complaint (if you can even call it that) is the remote. it is a bit chunky because of the full qwerty on the back and i havent been able to get the qwerty side to sync with my tv yet it keeps saying failure.. i would have liked to see the touch screen remote that was included with the 9000 series before. however on the grand scale this is minor.

Noticed a flashlight-like spray of light coming up and to the left, from the bottom center of the screen. Also, some minor light-clouding around the rest of the border was visible. These annoying light effects were only visible when dark screen was shown. Used it for 8 days with no change in the abnormality. I called Samsung and their tech dept told me that, 'it is normal and it should dissipate and dissapear withing 2-3 weeks. After that, if it is still there, I can call back and they will send out a repair technition to repair free of charge.' I was suspicious of this diagnosis, as it seemed like BS.It was enough of an annoyance that I returned the tv and exchanged it for a new one within my 2-weeks of purchase from the electronics store. I have had experiences before where a 'technician' or low-paid guy-with-a-logoed-polo-shirt comes to fix the device and you end up with more problems than when you started.*The new TV also has flashlighting - but with less than before. Now, there is a small, brighter cloud in the center, midway up the screen. (again, only visible with homogenous, dark backgrounds).From what I saw and heard, the Sony high-end (full-backlit) is better, but will cost a lot more and they might not have the large version out yet. This Samsung unit is a decent compromise.Pro's:- Fantastic resolution and brightness - we tone down the color, saturation, brightness, and edge-lighting so our eyes don't get sun-burnt.- Smooth subject movement when respective features are selected.- Beautiful Frame/Bezel, it is understandable that such a large tv would have a larger support frame to avoid warpage.- Lots of inputs and adjustments possible. Easy to hook up and view external photo and video devices.- Quick powers up and syncs with other Samsung devices nicely.Con's:- Flashlighting and clouding on dark backgrounds.- Screen adjustment features are thrown around in a few spots within the menu hierarchy and are confusing to choose between.- 'Soap-Opera effect', looks like you are watching reality TV when its a blockbuster movie. This could be something people new to HD have to get used to, not sure.- Price (ouch).- Haven't figured out how to auto-swivel the tv on the stand yet, maybe it's only manual?- Detail in some very dark images is lost..", "Date": "October 5, 2011"}, {"Title": "Best TV", "Author": "Geek guy", "ReviewID": "R2N6CPE0U55GBQ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I saw this TV come available from one of my tech sites,  I bought it the same day.The TV came in and Wow is all I can say..

The 3D effects are so cool and yes this is my first 3D TV,  I have seen 3D in movie theaters but its so much better being at home.  The added applications are cool and the added NAS support is wonderful.  I have a Synology NAS and once I plugged it in to the network the TV detected my NAS and listed it as Synology. Only draw back with the DLNA is that there is no graphic art or pictures of the Movies but the titles show and thats fine. (There might be hack for this and will research)Of course Amazon delivered the TV with in the hours as I requested and the box was in great shape.

Hirsch \"poetsteve\"", "ReviewID": "R2KYV3SYDX3YSS", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "The picture quality, colors, contrast and clarity of this television is nothing short of jaw dropping; just amazing really, especially since we upgraded from a 15 year old CRT-TV. It took us a while to get the thing set up, entering account info and registering for the various services but connecting to my wireless network was relatively simple and the TV downloaded an important update right after initial connection was made. Pairing the remote required that I hold the remote pretty close to the hot spot on the lower right corner of the TV but once paired, it worked flawlessly. My Time Warner cable remote however, still is not properly synched and connected to my new Samsung components so I may need to call Time Warner on this; the synch codes I used and the auto synch process did not fully work.Netflix is not what it used to be; the service seems to have only older movies and not the 'just released' films. This, along with nearly intolerable rebuffering pauses and an annoying black flash blip which happens every 3 mins or so makes me wonder if Netflix is really worth the subscription fee anymore. I ordered a new Apple Airport Extreme to upgrade to the new dual band technology so I am hoping that this fixes this rebuffering and drop out problems otherwise it is not likely that I will go past the free trial of Netflix. Blu-rays and DVDs look fantastic on this TV played on my new Samsung BD-D5500. The TV automatically connects to the Blu-Ray and switches ports when you turn it on. Cool.You need to play with the settings on the TV before you know what you like in terms of picture and sound. I was very impressed with the built-in sound of this TV, clearly upgraded over previous models, but I picked up an audio Y-cable and connected the TV directly to my stereo receiver's tape deck 'in' port and now when I activate the receiver's 'Tape' button, I get crystal clear stereo sound to go with my amazing picture. Even though this system supports surround sound 5.1 I am not missing it. The 3D features of this TV are mind-blowing but it does give you a headache after a while; you can sense the flicker of the battery powered glasses. Not all 3D discs are equal, some are a let-down and despite the hype, you likely won't end up watching 3D programming very often. The 3D starter kit comes with 2 pair of glasses and there's a coupon to get two more pair for free by mail so at least it's not too expensive for everyone to get the taste of 3D when they want it. The 2D picture though is beyond incredible. The bezel is unbelievably thin and the TV itself is very very thin and relatively lightweight. Stand is heavy and stable; ports are clearly marked but there is very little room to plug in the HDMI cables at back, especially since the pro cable I got for the Blu-Ray has a magnetic shield barrel on the cable and this presses against the back of the TV and seems to slightly bend the port so it is better to use HDMI cables that lay flat.The Samsung apps work pretty well but they are clearly still young and need development. I spent nearly two years researching TVs and am very happy I got this Smart-TV model. Dynamic LED backlighting was a key feature for me, there is absolutely no flashlighting or ghosting, blacks are deep and solid.

After having the TV for a few days now, I must say I am very disappointed.Here are the issues I have found with the TV so far:-1> Vertical Banding - The TV has big white vertical bands in the horizontal corners. Basically, its non-uniformity across the panel. Each vertical band is about 5-6 inches thick and is present on both corners. This is very visible on a grey background. I can see the vertical bands easily whenever I open netflix in smarthub or have my PS3 download the latest updates. You can see this vertical bands even in light black backgrounds. But is clearly visible in solid grey backgrounds.2> Flash Lighting - This is visible in dark room. I saw this while watching dark knight movie. The black bands in upper and topper levels clearly show the flash lighting in the four corners of the screen.3> Clouding - I initially didn't observe this. But whenever there are black screens in between movies, you can see cloud like formations all over the screen.4> QWERTY Remote not included - The D8000 Amazon website says that the new remote is included with the TV. But instead you get a voucher which you need to redeem online. Not a big deal but still a hassle. Should have mentioned in the website clearly.5> 3D glasses not included - Same thing as the QWERTY remote. Have to order through online by redeeming a voucher. When I buy a $2100+ TV, I expect them to take care of all these before shipping. Again, should mention these facts clearly in the Amazon web-page.6> Browser is slow - The browser included is no where close to the one you see in computers. If you are buying this TV for a browser, then you should know this. The browser is pretty slow and tough to navigate. Also, the advertisements and other flash videos make it cumbersome. This is not a major concern for me..but its still an issue.7> Smart Hub contents are mostly paid - Most of the features in the smart hub...you have to pay for it or have subscription. Nothing is free. Then again, I knew this before I bought it. But people need to be aware of this.8> Wireless connection not consistently maintained - When I was watching movies from netflix, I was seeing that I was getting disconnected several times. The connection is not maintained throughout. Even the CNET people who reviewed this TV saw this issue. If you are using a wired internet connection, this might not be an issue.For me personally, issues 1,2 and 3 are major problems. The rest (4,5,6,7 and 8) are minor issues and I can live with that.

It is definitely top notch! The only thing that is really hard to get past is what many call the \"Soap Opera Effect\". This is most noticeable when you're watching movies. The TV is so powerful that it makes the movie look life-like. Not like you're in the movie but like you're on the set of the movie while it is being filmed. The on-set lighting and shaky camera becomes a little much and resembles a cheap day time soap opera.How to fix this? Go into the Picture Options and change the Motion Plus setting from Standard to Clear. This will make the movie look normal and less like a home movie or Days of Our Lives.When you watch sports or live broadcasts, it's not required but you can put the Motion Plus setting back to Standard as live shows are better suited for the Motion Plus feature.That's all!

The picture is excellent and everything is great.  The second one was for my in-laws.  They saw my tv and wanted one just like it.  Upon opening the tv, my wife began putting together accessories while I was putting together the wall mount and she immediately noticed that the remote control was missing the battery cartridge. (The remote has a cartridge that pops out, you put your four AAA batteries in and slide the cartridge back in and you are good to go.)  We figured that this was an anomaly that could be taken care of by contacting Amazon, and even though it makes setting up the tv a great deal more tedious, mostly you just turn the tv on and off and use the cable box remote to change channels and the surround sound remote to adjust volume.  So we figured that we would be ok until a replacement could be sent.  She even noted to me that there was a quality inspection sticker that said \"passed\" in the wrapper with the remote.  Ha!Then, upon mounting the tv and turning it on, it began emitting a high pitched whine and as soon as the Smart TV screen came up, the tv obviously had horizontal lines streaking through the picture.  This was before any inputs had been selected or any components were turned on.  I went ahead and went through the setup skipping network setup and just got to the point where I could try the HDTV cable box or the Blu-ray player, and both of them also exhibited the horizontal lines while the tv was whining away at a high pitch.So, either Samsung was able so send out a tv that was missing the battery cartridge in the remote AND was defective, OR this tv was a return/repair/refurb that was not properly vetted and then sold as new.  Either of those two scenarios doesn't bode well for Samsung.For those of you who get a new/working tv, this is a nice tv with a great picture.  But Samsung worries me.  I have a 52 inch Samsung that has the capacitor problem that you can do a simple search on google and learn about.  The short version is that right at the two year mark, the tvs would take longer and longer to turn on while clicking over and over again. Eventually they wouldn't turn on at all.  At first Samsung denied the problem and would do nothing, but eventually the internet caught up with them and everyone was publishing the fix (about a half-dozen cheap capacitors on the power supply board that cost about $10 total to replace) and people even began selling kits to solder them in yourself and finally Samsung admitted there was a problem and started fixing the tvs.  That was 5+ years ago and I figured that they had gotten their act together since then, but now I'm not so sure.Samsung, without a doubt, makes one of the best looking LCD screens out there.  They look GREAT.  But they seem to have serious issues with quality control and cutting corners on part suppliers that make their tvs a gamble to buy.  I am waiting now to see how Amazon is going to handle this.  I will report back when I hear from them and follow up on how this is handled.Right now I have in-laws, with family coming to town this weekend (This is a Tuesday night) and they have a dead TV hanging on the wall and they are very disappointed.

Unless you are going to plug your coaxial cable directly into the tv, PiP is useless.  It's the only source that you can use.  Everyone I know is using a DVR from their cable company and hooking up via HDMI.  If that's your setup, you won't ever use PiP.  To me, this is a let down.Sound - I don't know if this is just my setup (haven't really looked into it), but the sound periodically cuts out for just a second.  This is especially noticable when playing media from hard drives.All Share - This is the reason for the mark down.  This is Samsung's media sharing software you put on your computer.  It's garbage.  I had nothing but problems with it.  It wasn't until I uninstalled it that I realized you don't even need it to begin with.  My WMP media hub showed up after I plugged some hard drives directly to the tv.  Go figure....Some additional thoughts...Don't go wireless if you plan to stream high quality stuff.  This is just me though.  I had the tv and laptop wireless, and movie playback was skipping.  Switch to wired and all was good.The QWERTY remote doesn't fully control other Samsung devices.  I still have to use four remotes in total.  Something to keep in mind.Not all settings work well for every single movie, especially with the 'Auto Motion'.  Depending on the movie, you may find yourself playing around with this setting often.The settings you setup are not across the board for each source.  You have to manually update your tv settings for each source.  This actually works out great in the long run though depending on the sources you plug into the tv.Pairing the QWERTY remote and 3D glasses took all about 5 seconds each.  The manual said to be right at the tv, and I was.I received my QWERTY remote, two pairs of 3D glasses, MegaMind, and Shrek 4 about a week after I did the vouchers online.  I had bought the Starter Kit along with the tv.  Samsung actually messed up and sent two copies of Shrek 4 just in different packages.That's all I got.", "Date": "June 24, 2011"}, {"Title": "Pretty Amazing", "Author": "4labs \"Power Buyer\"", "ReviewID": "R2WEL3JD5D61U3", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I made the choice for the Samsung over the Sony for two reasons.  Minimal picture difference (I couldn't tell a difference watching both of them at Sears for hours) and price (Samsung was around $800.00 cheaper against the top of the line Sony 46 inch).2-D Picture Quality (HD DirectTV)Amazing picture quality.  My HD signal looks like BluRay on this tv.  If I had to say something negative it would be that you almost have too much detail.  You can actually see the pits in a male actor's face and you can see the caked on makeup of the weather lady.  I watched a movie the other night and I found myself looking at the props to gather any details that a producer originally wouldn't want me to see as they would break the suspension of disbelief.  I could have sworn I saw a movie script on the desk of the vatican.  I remember when HD 1080 i and p first came out.  I had to adjust to the overwhelming realism.  You'll have to adjust again for these new TV's that operate at 240hz and have amazing color and motion flow.SoundSuprisingly good.  On par with my previous Sony TV.WeightAwesome!  No need to team carry this TV.  Don't have to worry about the studs supporting too much weight.StandA little on the cheap side (material wise) but given how light the TV is I guess they didn't need to use metal.ControlWell, I use a Logitech controller.  The original controller is pretty funny.  I has the basic remote controls on one side and a full keyboard on the other.  I'm sure the kids will take advantage of the internet capability but I have my IPAD2 for that.  Internet on a TV which sits across the room might be a little strange for me.SmartHubHaven't used.  I used my 3-D dvd player3-D Picture Quality (Direct TV 3D downloads and stations)Amazing.  On par with Regal and AMC 3-D movies.  My wife yells at me for watching the downloadable nature shows that DirectTV offers in 3-D.  If you don't have DirectTV you may find yourself with a lack of 3-D content until more movies are available for puchase in 3-D.  I know the coax companies in my area don't offer 3-D.  However, I think this TV will satisfy for the next 5 years until 3-D glasses free is ready and affordable.SummaryPositiveAmazing picture quality.  Color reproduction is great.  Black and shadow areas are superb.NegativeAlmost too real.  My son actually reaches to the TV to play with the Cars while watching Cars.  Hollywood movies are not shot with TV's like this in mind.  You may find yourself seeing too much of the movie set or seeing every single action of the actor.  This will take some getting used to.  As these TV's become more main stream you'll see movies pay greater attention to make-up, props and actor motions (or inconsistent motions).", "Date": "June 20, 2011"}, {"Title": "Quality Control!!", "Author": "don ventre", "ReviewID": "R2389VYQZ8D8U7", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "This is the first review I'm writing on Amazon, but thought I should share my experiences with this television. I originally decided on this this TV because my previous TV was a Samsung and I loved it. I thought I would treat myself to an upgrade so I picked this model as it was the top of the line Samsung model and it was well reviewed on Amazon. I'm not writing this review to disparage those who have had a positive experience with this TV (I wish I had the same experience), but to tell you what I've been through trying to get a TV that didn't have any defects. I went through 4 exchanges with this set before I finally gave up.1st Set - Initially looked pretty good, colors were great and blacks were the best I'd seen on a LED TV. After watching for a little while I noticed these horizontal bands of slight discoloration that were very distracting whenever the camera would pan up or down while watching programing. So, I decided to call Amazon and setup an exchange.2nd Set - This set was a disaster. Not only did this set have the horizontal bands of discoloration but also had these dark streaks coming down from the top that looked like dirty drips of water from behind the glass and the colors look very washed out. I called Amazon and decide to exchange again. After seeing all the good reviews for this set I thought I must have just gotten really unlucky and the third one would be the charm.3rd Set - With this set I finally saw why this TV is so well reviewed. This one had a clear screen and the colors were perfect. The picture was absolutely stunning at times. It was only after watching for a little while did I notice these light spots emanating form 3 of the corners during dark scenes. I kept this set for a couple of weeks hoping the would go away, but the never did. I decided I couldn't live with the light spots and with some regret decided to return it. I choose an exchange one more time as I was hooked on the stunning picture and hoped the next one would be perfect.4th Set - I didn't take long at all after turning on this set that I notice a small group of Pixels stuck on green! Finally I decided to give up all together on this model.  My experiences with this TV have made me lose confidence in the Samsung brand. While Samsung did a great job designing this model, I found their Quality Control to be shameful. After doing some research online I found I was not the only one with a bad experience with this TV.  While a gave this TV 1 star, I'd give Amazon Customer Service 5 Stars for being very easy to deal with during this whole ordeal.", "Date": "February 2, 2012"}, {"Title": "Great TV", "Author": "Voirdire", "ReviewID": "RQL8YTY56LWWT", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I've never owned an LED TV before so I did quite a bit of research and determined Amazon.com was the cheapest I would find. I read that Samsung was currently the best on the market so I searched only for Samsung TVs. After reading the reviews, I finally decided that the Samsung UN55D8000 55-Inch 1080p 240Hz 3D LED HDTV (this TV) was going to be the TV I was going to purchase. A couple days after ordering the TV from amazon.com, I received a phone call from I believe it was a company called Home Direct Shipping (or something like that) to schedule a delivery. Other reviewers mentioned that Amazon.com didn't mention that. I only knew that another company was going to deliver it because of other reviews. The delivery guys (was 2 of them) were nice and I had no issues. They offered to unpack it but since I didn't have an entertainment stand at the time, I declined.Once my stand arrived (also purchased on amazon.com), I started to setup the TV. As soon as you put the batteries, turn on the TV. Flip the remote over to the keyboard side and it will tell you that you need to pair the remote. You want to do this right away to avoid any issues. I had a bunch of issues pairing the remote but after reading the reviews on here, specifically the person who posted a way to reset the remote (thank you for that!), I finally figured it out. You will want to get about 6 inches away from the bottom RIGHT corner of the TV. Making sure the TV is ON and 6 inches away from the bottom RIGHT corner of the TV, press and hold TAB+SYM for about 2 seconds. The screen on the remote will say \"Pairing\" and should take just a few seconds to pair. Do it any further than 6 inches away and you may run into some issues.Once you have paired the remote, connect your TV to the internet by using the option in the Menu. I have a wireless router so the TV picked up my internet and connected with no problem. As soon as you are connected to the internet, immediately update your TVs software. If you don't, you may run into some problems. Netflix kept saying it couldn't connect to the internet but yet I checked the Network status through the TV and it said I was connected (I could also connect to other apps that used the internet). As soon as I updated the software on the TV, it worked perfectly. The picture looks great, although I just noticed a few minutes ago a white dot looking thing on the bottom right corner. I'm not quite sure what that is since I'm a complete n00b when it comes to that kind of stuff (bleeding, clouding, etc. I know nothing about that). I'll have to look into it.Other reviews talked about needing to mail in vouchers from the 3D kit. I received my kit and it included the two 3D glasses, Shrek 1-4, and Megamind 3D. There was no voucher for Shrek or anything, everything was in the box. I have watched Shrek 1-2 (3D) and Megamind 3D so far and the 3D was pretty cool. It's not like on the big screens where it pops up at you but it's still a cool thing to show. There is definitely great potential though. Assuming they still do further research (and gain better technology), give the 3D technology a few years and it will be awesome. The TV also comes with two 3D glasses. I haven't checked them out yet but it appears it is rechargeable through USB.Pros:Great PictureHas different apps, such as Netflix (which I thought was really cool)Price - Amazon was the cheapest that I found (who can beat free shipping and no tax)Features - Many to play with (While time consuming, I like messing around with different features)Edgeless screen - I thought this was really cool.Cons:Audio - Isn't great but what can you really expect from a flatscreenManual - Could be a little more informational. It does not explain the process of pairing as well as it should.Screen - Is glossy and gets dirty with fingerprints (while setting the TV up, I put a few of my fingerprints on the TV from holding it). Since it is glossy, the TV may not look that great if you have light hitting the TV. My living room is dark because I like my batcave to be dark so I don't have any light issues.Remote - There is a bit of lag time but it wasn't that noticeable to me.

The shipping company called several days after the order was placed to schedule a time and date for delivery. So far so good.The TV came in about a week. They bring it in for you and plug it in to see if it works, but don't hook up any video source.I came home just when they were leaving as it only took several minutes for them to remove it from the packing and plug it in.I had it up on the wall within 15 minutes, only having to install the bracket on the back. The screws that came with the bracket were a little too long or too short, but I had some 8mm x 25mm screws that were perfect.After watching it and playing around with the Smart TV Web functions for several days, we noticed that most of the TV shows looked like it was (live) or that you were behind the camera watching. It was that clear, or as if you were in the same room when they were filming, and this was from cable TV, just regular shows we watch everyday.OK, so getting to the 3D part. I removed the glasses from the package, trying to be very careful (my nature) and removing the protective film from each lens, I noticed one lens was shattered! My heart just dropped. What the heck!I didn't notice it was broken when I removed it from the package, so did it happen during or after, I really don't know.I got on the computer and found the return policy from Amazon, as I have never returned anything in my life, well maybe one or two things but found it was very easy as they send UPS to the house with a label and picked up the package, after I repacked it and put the required info inside. I left it on the porch with a note (take me!)Amazon sent out another Shrek/Megamind BD/3D glass kit and I received it in a couple of days! That was fast.We watched a 3D movie last night, Resident Evil, Afterlife. The movie didn't (pop) out for us. I tried to adjust it during the movie but my wife wanted to watch the movie, so I waited till it was over.After fiddling with the remote (get to that later) I found the 3D settings and adjusted the depth and POW, there it was, right in front of me, 3D as it should be. Now it looks like someone bored a hole in the wall behind the TV and added a table in front to hold stuff that was just hanging out in the breeze!Lets get back to the remote. I did notice that the keys do have some bounce, that is, you type in a i and you get 2 or 3 of them. Same with most of the buttons, at least I'm going to say most as it is probably inherent to the electronics in the remote, so my solution for this problem is to push the keys fast...Getting back to the Shrek Blu Ray kit, the tape they use to hold the glasses in is very sticky, to the point that it makes it difficult to remove the glasses. I was very careful (more so than at first) to remove this plastic film from the temples that held them in. Also removing the film from the lens itself, as the lens is very thin. I think the frames should have gone all the way around the lens for protection. I think they made them the way they are so you get the feeling of open space and not seeing a frame as you would in most glasses.I do agree with others that Samsung should have included a copy of the instructions, but I can see why they didn't. Maybe put it on a CD so you can print it out yourself. I will be calling the hot line to get a copy as someone mentioned here as I like reading about all of the different settings.I did purchase the 3D Blu Ray player/7.1 sound system kit. It came several days before the TV did, so I was able to set it up prior. All I have to say is its ok, as I am an audiophile, its as good as can be expected from a kit, but it sets up fast and is probably good enough for most people.I am planning on using this system in the bedroom after the house is remodeled and getting a 65\" model, hopefully a Samsung again, as the glasses will be compatible and probably use another sound system, possibly with my own stereo speakers. 55\" is OK for me, but I think a 65 incher will be a blast in the living room.Just to confirm the remote setup with what everyone mentioned, mine didn't setup from 10 feet away, I tried several times until I remembered the instructions saying to be several feet away, and just like magic it worked, so read the instructions people.. But of course to do that you have to get the remote working before you can access the e-structions  on the TV.I have not seen any stray light or ghosting or anything out of the norm, but will be looking for anything strange.The sound from the built in speakers is fine for watching TV. Much better than the rear projection Sony I bought 20 years ago!Several reasons I bought a LED TV was that it doesn't get as hot as a plasma, it weighs less and doesn't get the burn-in. Maybe some of the older LCD screens were not as good but so far this TV is going to make me fat, cause I'm going to watch more TV and get less exercise!Now I'm on a mission to find 3D Blu Ray movies.Added 5/11.After watching quite a few 3D movies, I have come to the conclusion that the 3D is not quite as deep as what you see on the big screen. A little disappointing to me but still a nice picture. We are all enjoying the large screen and 3D effects.BTW, I also own the 3d system sold 15 years ago. Using the supplied glasses and convertor box it isn't bad except for the flicker on a CRT TV. I tried the old 3D DVD's hoping that something would work but it didn't. Maybe someday I can design a convertor that will make them work on the new LCD.", "Date": "April 20, 2011"}, {"Title": "Samsung", "Author": "golferdude45", "ReviewID": "R26C2B18NWROWV", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "One Word--AWESOME.

I finally decide to settle with the UN55D7000 series. Well, to cut the story short, I had to return the UN55D7000 back three times due to major edge bleeding and clouding on the screen. Yes, three times. I was about to give up on Samsung brand and go with a LG 55LW6500. After looking at the LG LW6500 series, the design and the TV frame didn't catch my buying attention. I was very indecisive to give Samsung TV another chance after returning three TV back due to Samsung poor quality control.As another day pass and more researching, I read a forum online stating that Samsung is working quietly on replacing a new panel for the for UNXXDX000. The new panel is under a new version called H303. Excitingly, I went out to Best Buy, and bought a UN55D8000 hoping I would get a version H303, which I did. After I bought the TV home and unpack it, I turn off all the light in my room, turn the TV on and guess what?! There is not a single edge bleeding and clouding on the screen. WOW!A few reasons I bought this TV was for the 3D and the awesome design. Of course the picture/video is not going to pop out the screen, instead give you a depth of field which is awesome for gaming. 2D to 3D conversion is still novelty which need more improvement but it still a nice feature.Smart TV is a joke. Its ridiculously slow. I feel like I am using a 56k modem with a 300 mhz processor computer. I have my router no more than 10 feet away from the TV and I cannot even watch YouTube App without the video skipping. As for the remote, its one of the best remote I have seen, yet it buggy. It is not very responsive. The QWERTY keyboard is nice but doesn't work on all app. Sometime, I think its pointless.  Do your self a favor, if you have an Iphone go download the Samsung remote app for free. It work better than the remote IMO.If you decide to buy a D series Samsung make sure you get a H303 version. The last three UN55D7000 that I return has H302 version on it and the screen was horrible due to edge light bleeding and non uniformity black screen. Anyways, good luck on your purchases.****************************************************************************EDIT FROM 4 STARS T0 2 STARSJANUARY 5, 2012After owning the UN55D8000 for a week, it look like the H303 panel didn't solve the clouding problem and uniformity black screen.

After a cumbersome and annoying swap out of the TV due to a bad third-party delivery service Amazon used to handle this, the second one came and worked great for about two weeks. Then it began to have intermittent banding across the top quarter of the screen, so that the top quarter is shaded differently than the rest of the picture, rendering it unwatchable. The banding came and went for a couple of weeks but then became permanent. After a couple more weeks it occurred to me that the subwoofer behind the TV could be causing interference. I'm not sure why I thought that would make a difference--perhaps just desperation--because for the last year I'd had a Samsung LED TV from 2010 (the previous year's model) in the same position in front of the subwoofer without any problems. However, I moved the newer model to a bedroom and brought the older one back to the spot in front of the subwoofer.

The picture looks great and the black levels are deep, but there are several problems that completely ruin this set.  Here are a few:1.) There is always a thin line of light by the edges of the television.  This is probably from the backlight (I assume).  There are also white lights that form in all four corners of the set.2.) Clouding, all over the TV.  When I first turn on the tv, there is little noticeable white clouding around black areas.  However, after 30minutes or more of using the television, there will be clouds all over the television whenever there is a black image.3.) You cannot play video games on this television.  If you are a gamer, do NOT get this tv!  There is a very noticeable delay between when you press buttons on your controller and when the action occurs on the television.

I am a techie, but i use the default settings on the TV and they have been fine for me.  But after using this TV for 6 months it was time to share my experiences.Picture QualityThis is strongest when I am watching live sports and video gaming.  I don't have cable and use the free TV around me.  Its actually clearer than HD from cable companies.  This TV gets a solid workout when i play games.  I log about 20-30 hours a week in shooters on my XBOX slim like Halo and MW3.  The quality of these games on the large screen is phenomenal.  On the other side, movies and TV programming are a bit weird as all the people are \"too life like\".  Its as if the TV is trying to up convert everything.  Some things are not meant for this conversion.  The biggest impact is when i see way too much details in action movies like Transformers and Super 8.  detracts from the theatrical experience.SoundThere aren't any noticeable ports where speakers would reside.  Obviously they cant be big on such a thin TV.  But I find the sound is quite good.  I normally turn on my surround for movies, sports or stereo supported TV shows.  But for the news and other general stuff they are great.  Bass is decent.  They get plenty loud and i normally keep around 15 out of 100 is a quite room.Connections4 HDMI connections work well.  I tried the USB connector and started hearing funny sounds from my USB drive.  So now i use a laptop connected using the HDMI connection.  It has an optical out, but it only works with sound from a TV station or one of the streaming apps.  Once again, i think they did this on purpose to reduce piracy.Smart Hub - Apps1st gen apps for a TV.  They aren't special, but can be convient.  BBC news and youtube are nice to watch.  The HD programming on YouTube is nice to watch.  The problem is lake of integration between a cool keyboard to the apps.  For example i need to use the arrow keys to select the right letters to type when I searching term for the YouTube app.  But the browser works ok with the keyboard.Note: The Amazon Prime Instant Video is mysteriously lacking as an app.  Its available for previous Samsung TV models.  So i have a feeling they removed to appease the Netflicks, Vudu and other paid service providers.Power ConsumptionPeople like the color range on a plasma.  I agree that the colors appear better.  But my goal was to have a wall mounted (i can lift this TV by myself) unit that doesnt generate a massive amount of heat.

A pair of 3D glasses is included with the set. It is the upgraded type, SSG-3100GB. (Samsung SSG-3100GB 3D Active Glasses - Black (Only Compatible with 2011 3D TVs)The glasses are designed to accommodate prescription glasses by making the nose piece removable. There are the rechargeable type, with 2 micro-USB cables provided. The glasses can be charged off the TV USB ports (when the TV is ON) or any other usb port/charger.Keep in mind, for 2011 Samsung has changed the way the glasses communicate with the TV. They opted for Bluetooth vs. IR, resulting in 3D glasses made for earlier models incompatible with 2011 TVs. I have seen 3rd party glasses advertised as \"compatible with 2010 and 2011 models\", so I recommend you be absolutely sure you know what you are ordering.2. If you plan to mount the TV on the wall, the new design uses plastic spacers which render the hardware supplied with most wall mounts incompatible with this TV. Make sure you have the correct size screws to attach this TV to the mount. I used four M8-1.25x25 screws with 2 washers. The screws that came with the wall mount were either too short or too long.3. The built-in WiFi works well. I had no issues connecting to my home network operating at 5 GHz with WPA2-PSK (AES) security, using the WPS option (WiFi Protected Setup).4. The QWERTY remote is included with this TV. The QWERTY side of the remote needs to be paired with the TV, which worked on the 3rd try. I think I had to be closer to the TV for that. There is also a Samsung App for iPhone that turns your iPhone into a remote. Unlike the similar Sony app, the Samsung one does allow you to turn your set off. You cannot turn it on with this app, obviously, because the TV has to be ON for the app to communicate with it. The app works well for what it is.5. I was happy to find out the HDMI-CEC (Anynet+) function was compatible with my ONKYO receiver. Turning the TV on/off also operates the power on the receiver.6. The HDMI Audio Return Channel works as advertised. You have to remember to connect the HDMI cable to HDMI2 port though (marked with \"ARC\" for Audio Return Channel). Having an ARC-compatible receiver eliminates the need for the optical cable between the TV and receiver for listening to audio coming from DTV tuner or network widgets.7. The picture quality of HD Dish Network channels was not satisfactory right out of the box, and some fiddling with the settings was required. At times, the screen would get a shade or two darker all of a sudden, in the middle of a scene. There are several setting that could possibly have something to do with it, and I had to adjust them one by one until the picture improved.8. 3D looks absolutely breathtaking. My Blu-ray player (BDP) complained that it could not find a 3D TV connected it. However, it was the BDP itself that had its 3D function disabled by default.9. I didn't play with the apps much. At first loading the Internet browser resulted in a blue screen flickering for a few seconds following by the 'loading' icon, and then the sequence repeated several times. After power-cycling the set, eventually I hit some button on the Smart Hub screen, and the TV carried out an upgrade after which the browser loaded just fine. Overall, I found the amount of Content in the Smart Hub a bit overwhelming. I just don't have time to learn about all of them, but that does not mean the TV should suffer in ratings for that.10. On a side note... The current version of the Megamind 3D Starter Kit (Samsung SSG-P3100M Megamind 3D Starter Kit - Black (Compatible with 2011 3D TVs)) comes with all 5 movies included (Shreks 1-4 and Megamind) - no need for vouchers as reported back in March or so. None have subtitles apparently, as stated on the box, and while subtitles tend to detract from 3D, it would have been nice to have that option.", "Date": "July 22, 2011"}, {"Title": "Beautiful Picture, very classy design, excellent video format support", "Author": "S. Rajagopalan", "ReviewID": "R132F7K354T2EE", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "COMPARISON: I spent a long time researching LED TVs before buying the Samsung UN55D8000. The final test was a side by side comparison of a Samsung UN55D8000, an LG Infinia 55LW5600 and a Sony Bravia 55HX820. All three are 3D Edge lit LEDs, with different technologies for local dimming (controlling the light dark levels in different areas of the screen). The one other relevant difference was that the LG was a 120Hz (TruMotion), the Samsung a 240Hz (Auto Motion Plus) and the Sony a 480Hz (Motionflow XR), which are all different trade names for a technology to reduce blurring seen on fast moving objects.PICTURE QUALITY: The biggest and most obvious difference was the picture quality. The colors, contrast and in general the \"life like\" quality of the Sony and Samsung were very obviously better than the LG. This was not a subtle difference. The LG seemed more faded and washed out when you compare it side by side with the other two. I spent a lot of time playing with the video settings on the LG (I was at a HHGregg and they were really flexible - just gave me the remotes and left me alone) - but no luck. I don't thing the 120 vs 240/480 Hz has anything to do with this. The screen, and the LED local dimming technology of the LG is just not as good as either the Samsung or Sony.I did not see any difference between the Samsung or the SonyThere was a noticeable difference in the motion blur between the LG (120Hz) and the Samsung/Sony (240, 480Hz), but not huge. There was a basketball game on, and all the fast movement made the difference more obvious. Again - no difference between the Sony and Samsung.APPEARANCE: The Samsung and the Sony both have a very thin bezel, and yes this does make a difference. It is all picture and very little \"TV\" - very classy.DECISION: The choice to go for Samsung instead of the LG was easy: big upgrade in picture quality. A HUGE deciding factor between the Samsung and Sony was the flexibility in playing my  media collection. Sony is VERY restrictive in the video formats it supports. Samsung plays pretty much everything I have - avi, mkv, mp4, wmv, DVDs ripped to vob files - in fact almost everything out there except flv.AFTERTHOUGHTS: I've had the TV for a month now and I'm very happy with the purchase. I haven't noticed any of the bleed through or edge light artifacts that I've seen mentioned here. The backlit SAMSUNG logo at the bottom was distracting, but its easy enough to turn off. I suspect that these \"issues\" don't bother most people, or are simply not really visible when watching regular TV. The picture quality is outstanding. Sometimes its like looking through a window!I'm not big on 3D, but I've seen some of the streaming 3D previews and nature documentaries available through Smart Hub and the quality is very good. I do see some strange artefacts - a sort of blurring/ pixellation - on some parts of the image, especially when the camera is panning, or when there's moving water. This is very likely because of limited wireless bandwidth - I have a wireless G network, not an N, and 3D streaming takes a LOT of bandwidth. This was probably also the reason the streaming 3D video would pause a couple of times during playback - something that never happens when I'm using Netflix. I would have to see a 3D Blu Ray to reliably comment on 3D quality. In general though, since 99.9% of my TV and video watching is 2D, 3D is not a big issue for me.The Wireless reception is excellent, and setting up the network for Netflix was very easy - The remote has a full keypad on one side which helps a lot in typing in passwords etc (The remote has a gyroscope/sensor, so the keypad is inactive when its facing down, during normal use). The really irritating thing though is that the keypad does not work for the search input on Netflix or YouTube, which I hope they fix soon!I've used Samsung's Allshare media server software to stream videos and music from my laptop through the wireless network and it works just fine (as does other media server software - Serviio is a good alternative. I prefer hooking up my hard drive directly to the TV, because nether Allshare nor other media software allow you to rewind and forward videos.The Android remote app is also excellent - it is a full feature remote and easy to set up. I've also been using the imediashare lite android app to stream stuff from my phone.I can't comment on the customer service since I haven't had any issues, but I got a great deal on a 3 year in-home service plan at the store I bought the TV, so I'm covered.A FINAL WORD - I'd seen some reviews mention that they don't get Dolby 5.1 surround from Netflix, and this was a downer - I couldn't get a clear answer to that at the store, or from the Samsung website. I can report now that the TV DOES support HD and 5.1 Dolby digital from Netflix - I've tested it and there's no doubt - my AV receiver shows a Dolby Digital signal. I think this is a recent thing - there was a firmware upgrade in Dec 2011, and at least one Smart Hub upgrade since I bought the TV in late Jan.", "Date": "February 20, 2012"}, {"Title": "Amazing.

There are a lot of great things about this tv, but the one thing that matters most - the picture - was a big disappointment.  The design and features of this tv are great.  Internet worked really well, menus are nicely laid out and I loved the big screen.  If you view the tv straight on, the picture is excellent, but if you sit the slightest bit off center it washes out quickly.  Black levels become terrible, screen uniformity issues become glaring (flashlighting and vertical banding) and colors (particularly flesh tones) are poor.  Watching an episode of American Horror Story was a nightmare.  I exchanged this tv for the PN64D8000 plasma and am much happier.  The plasma picture is not quite as bright, but the off center viewing and colors are far superior.  For me, better black levels and color are more important than spectacularly bright whites.

I will focus on the SmartTV internet-enable features, which were the main reason for purchasing Samsung. We do not have television service (cable, satellite, or antenna), but use the internet and our network computers for content.Network setup is relatively simple. We tried both wired and wireless and both worked well. We followed the instructions for pairing the QWERTY side of the remote and it has worked well, although not all apps recognize it and you will sometimes have a more typical phone or grid layout for text input.The main network screen, \"Smart Hub\" is accessed through a button on the remote. 12 apps are displayed across the bottom of the screen, including a web browser. Many more can be added and are displayed by moving to the right. We've (briefly) tried about 50 apps to see what we might like.On the top half of the Smart Hub screen, the left has a Picture-in-Picture window with an ad-like changing bar below it for Samsung and paid apps. In the top middle is \"Your Video,\" which could be a great feature. It appears to aggregate movie and TV shows across apps and includes ratings. Clicking on the video's picture pulls up lots of information and includes Twitter and Facebook sharing. Hitting \"Watch\" pulls up your accounts with buy and rent prices. Right now we just see Vudu and CinemaNow (more on that later). Unfortunately, the Vudu prices aren't always correct. We did use a new member credit at Vudu and their 99\u00a2 movie of the day is a great way to view HD movies. I think Hulu Plus and Netflix also work here but we are not subscribers. I don't think regular free Hulu with ads is accessible except through the browser.Rounding out the top of the screen is a \"Recommended\" bar of paid apps, and to the right the \"Samsung Apps\" bar that lets you search for new apps. At the top of the screen is a search bar, but clicking it brings up a new page. Using the QWERTY remote, a search will find videos through the \"Your Video\" aggregator, but also YouTube videos, sites in your web browsing history, and a button that will open a Bing search in the browser.The system is running Linux, and the browser has a Samsung copyright. It has no tabs, but you can have multiple windows. Exiting the browser closes the session; it isn't that useful for seeking web information while watching other content. Default web navigation is through tab-based arrow buttons, but pressing the yellow selection button changes to a pointer that can be controlled with the arrows, but the QWERTY side of the remote actually has a scroll button (like a Blackberry pearl) on the enter key (between the arrows).The biggest issue (especially on this site!) is that Amazon instant video is not supported! There is no app available and while a search may get you to a page that suggests using the Yahoo app, this is also not supported. There is no software upgrade available as of 11/2011. We have not been able to even get Amazon instant video to play in the web browser. The only way we have been able to access Amazon Prime videos is through our Panasonic blu-ray player. (Panasonic also has a much better YouTube interface, including account sign-in. The Samsung YouTube app immediately starts playing some inane recommended video and you have to use search to find content.) If Amazon is your main source for video content, please check if this has been corrected!The other big issue is that while the system can \"see\" the computers on our home network, it has not been able to access any content. It has folders for videos, music, and pictures, but nothing has been found. We will work on the sharing rights and see if we can get this working. A bigger problem is that we have a network drive attached to our router that holds all our family photos and videos and backs up our music. The Samsung cannot \"see\" this drive.We are very happy with the television features of the Samsung UN55D8000 (picture quality, light/dark differential, QWERTY remote, Amazon pricing), however the connectivity needs improvement:1. Add Amazon app, or at least some method of accessing Amazon instant video.2. Improve network recognition, including support for network router drives3.

I've never owned or even seen a better performing TV.  The picture is vibrant, crisp, and realistic.

One side of the remote is a full qwerty keyboard, while the other side is more of a conventional remote.  Not to mention that you can watch 3D TV without the need of a 3D converter, which was needed in older 3D TV's.This connects to internet/wifi, offering several apps such as facebook and Pandora through Samsung's Smart Hub.

The picture depth is incredible and aside from some plasma competition, it's the best we've tested in this area. Contrast, sharp, clean edges, and rich color and light combine to give the depth effect. Of course, this also works out great when viewing 3D images as mentioned below.There are some slight color uniformity issues as with all LED backlit LCD TVs, but in the UND8000 they aren't too distracting. Color information is not as rich as it is with the best plasma TVs on the market, the trade off being exceptional brightness and light throughput, which can appeal to those with lots of ambient sunlight coming in to the room.The Ultra Clear Panel filter works very well to absorb ambient light, preventing too much glare.3D TV Viewing: We viewed several 3D sources and did not note any flickering or flashing from the glasses (crosstalk). There was also no blurring in the bottom corners of images as with last years models. 3D viewing is intended to involve the viewer more in the picture and with this active 3D TV we can definitely confirm the attributes of 3D depth perception. The only negatives noted were some glare from the insides of the lenses when ambient room light was present and some tiredness in the eyes when viewing the 3D footage for periods of time.Standard Definition Picture Quality: 9/10Standard definition performance is as important today as ever with all the streaming video being ported in less than top HD quality. The UND8000 does one of the finest jobs we've seen in a while with lowly resolution signals. At times, it's difficult to tell you are not watching in HD.Features Rating: 9.5/10Inputs: A couple of years ago super thin TVs like this did not accommodate many inputs. The D8000 uses breakout cables for the component and composite inputs with very small jacks. It still manages 2 USB ports, and 3 HDMI inputs as well.Appearance: The 55D8000 comes with a 4 leg chrome stand with 20 degree swivel. People seem to either like or dislike the stand with none in between. However, everyone likes the sleek picture frame appearance of the bezel which is a negligible .4\" in width and almost unseen were it not for the silver metallic strip surrounding the screen. Depth is 1\" and tapers in the back to give it an even slimmer appearance. The bolt holes for wall mounting are recessed in the back of the TV in such a way to allow for super tight wall mounting.Remote Control: The dual sided remote control is one of the standout features of the D8000 - giving the user a normal backlit functional remote on one side and a QWERTY keyboard for Internet and Smart Hub use on the other.The QWERTY side comes complete with a visible led screen and a 5 way control pad. It's reasonably easy to use the keyboard and is certainly much easier than a 5-way pad. Anyone that uses a smart phone consistently will have no problem. The coolest feature however, is the little touch pad in the center of the 5 way control to the right of the keypad. It's very small and easy to miss, but with this you can use a finger to navigate with a mouse which we found much faster than the 5-way control. To enable this feature use the 5-way control to scroll down to the directions on the bottom of the screen labeled, \"Switch to the pointer.\"Menu Function: The 2011 blue opaque menu from Samsung is extremely complete and easy to navigate with a handy tutorial about each feature out to the right when highlighted. It's faster and easier to use than past menus. We found the Movie mode the best among the preset picture mode options by a longshot. The others present a very color inflamed picture. There are loads of extra feature options under the Advanced Settings and Picture Options settings. We've mentioned recommendations above on several. Follow our calibrated picture settings for optimal performance in a low light environment.See the full review at 3D TV Buying Guide", "Date": "July 27, 2011"}, {"Title": "Great TV", "Author": "Ron B \"reb52\"", "ReviewID": "R2ITO838DAX18S", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I received this TV about 10 days ago and its awsumb.

The set was delvered after much confusion by CEVA, the common shipper for the Third Party seller Electronics Expo on the Amazon Web site. The \"White Glove\" delivery was by a guy who could not even figure how to screw in the screws for the base. I had to show him.After he left, I plugged in the TV and saw a long Purple line from the top of the panel to the bottom which persisted. After a 2 hour call to Samsung tech support they agreed it was a defective panel.To my suprise, the seller Electronics Expo refused to replace it! Amazon customer service tried but even after a 20 min call and argument with a manager at Electronics Expo the very friendly and apologetic Amazon agent could not influence them since they are a 3rd party. Lucky, Amazon has agreed to have it picked up free and will refund my $2000.00. I see that Electronics Expo is already off the Amazon site for this item. My advice: Stick with Electronics sold only by Amazon and not a 3rd party like this fly by nignt seller Electronics Expo.Update January 2012:Amazon rapidly refunded my money, arranged free pick-up by the trucking firm and removed the 3rd parter seller Electronic Expo from the Amazon Web site. I re-purchased the UM-55D8000 at a local P.C. Richards & Sons. They had a package deal with 2 additional 3-D glasses and a Samsung BluRay DVD and after some quick negotiation with their Manager, the P.C. Richard price was even a few dollars less than the Amazon partner negating the sales tax. I gave away the DVD as a Christmas gift.I have had the the new working Samsung UM-55D800 for a month and it is Amazing!. The picture quality is second to none.

Most new Blu Ray players will upgrade your 2D movies to 3D mode. The only negative opinion that I share with many other reviewers is the design of the QWERTY remote and the Samsung Internet interface. It is very difficult to surf the WEB and extremely slow for email. Also all Samsung LCD TV's and Blu Ray players lack the Amazon Link for movie rentals. For us Amazon Prime customers this is a slight negative. However, my new Panasonic Blu Ray WiFi player has the Amazon software and link to Amazon Prime so this gets around that drawback.My advice: Buy this fantastic LCD TV... You will love it, but do not buy any large electronics from an Amazon partner who will not stand behind the sale.

Free shipping and delivery was within a week.  Delivery is scheduled within a 3 hour window (automatically or your choice); in my case, between 8 and 11 am. The TV was actually delivered at 12:00 (by a firm called CEVA)---but that's actually 2 hours early by Miami standards. Not only was it delivered by actual human beings, they also took it out of the box and hooked it up---no charge. Several friends who have purchased Samsung TVs from Amazon had told me that delivery included setup. To be honest, I did have to gently refuse to sign the acceptance paper until I could see the set working. No surprise, they had all the tools on hand and, did a full setup. All you have to do is ask. In most States there is no tax, so I paid $350 less than at the best \"Holiday\" sales price at the local Best Buy. In addition, Best Buy charges $350 for setup, so I figure I saved $700 by purchasing from Amazon. Well, I did give the guys a $20 tip---recommended---so I \"only\" saved $680.  Well, BB would also charge $50 for the $10 HDMI cable, and they won't let you out of BB without a cable.  So, net, I saved $7203DThe \"3D Starter Kit\" Samsung 3D Starter Kit - 2 pairs of Black 3D active glasses SSG-3100m/za (compatible with 2011 3D Samsung TVs-D6400, D490 series, LED, plasma model--full list TVs at Product Description) mentioned by several reviewers DOES NOT come with the TV unless specified.  No problem---it is grossly overpriced and you don't need it---it is just 2 pairs of 3D glasses and a few kid's movies.  2 pairs of 3D glasses are included with the TV.  Samsung seems to be cagey about which model of 3D glasses is included---probably because they've changed with availability. In my case two 3500CR 3D glasses were included in the box with the TV. If you need more 3D glasses, look elsewhere than Amazon (such as your local Sears, really), and don't pay over $30 each.  Be careful which model you buy, only a few models (the 3100GB, 3300CR, 3500CR, or 3700CR) are designed to work with the Samsung 2011 model TVs (i.e., the D8000 series).  My understanding is that the 3500CR is identical to the 3700CR, except that the 3700CR can be also charged wirelessly (if you buy a special charging device).  Since the 3500CR are much cheaper (apparently having been discontinued by Samsung in favor of the 3700CR), the 3500CR are probably the best choice.  Surprisingly, as of January 2012, the only 3D offerings are nature documentaries and children's movies---nothing worthwhile for the mature adult audience (not even Avatar is out in 3D yet), but that will surely change.WHY YOU NEED A BLUE-RAY PLAYERYes your old DVD player will work with your Samsung D8000 TV, but you'll be disappointed.  Sadly, the abominable resolution of many DVDs (many simply transfered from VCR recordings) and other defects are exaggerated on the big Samsung TVs.  Even DVD movies you thought were particularly sharp and detailed (e.g., Lord of the Rings) on your smaller set are disappointing on the big Samsungs, especially if played on an old DVD player.  Even if you don't plan to buy a whole new HD movie library (I don't), a Blu-ray player will give you a much better picture with your (standard, low definition) DVD movies. Because: 1) the Blueray sends a digital rather than analog signal to the TV, and 2) it is a digital signal which is converted from \"low D\" to \"HD\", rather than an analog signal.  If I haven't convinced you to buy a Blu-ray player, then at least buy and \"upscaling\" or \"upconverting\" DVD player (search for \"Upscaling DVD Player\" on Amazon---you'll have your choice of a dozen models as cheap as $15 used, $20 new).  Upscaling DVD players won't play Blu-ray movies, but it will make your old DVDs look much better, sometimes even rivaling Blu-ray (depending on the quality of the original DVD recording).  Of course, blu-ray movies played on a blueray player on a D8000 Samsung are incredible.WHICH BLUERAY PLAYERAmong the Blu-ray players which can fully support the latest TV features (e.g., 3D) I've  concluded that the Samsung BD-D5500 player is the best match with the D8000 series TVs.  Compared to other brands, for example: 1) The Samsung TV and player remotes are very similar, and both can control both the TV and the player. 2) If you select the player from the TV source menu, the player automatically turns on and begins play. Conversely, If you insert a disk in the player, the TV turns on with the player set as the \"source\".  3) Many functions of the player and the TV will sync with each other---you don't have to worry about the player being in one mode while the TV is in a different mode.  For example, there are a variety of \"picture modes\": dynamic, movie, natural, and (if the \"source\" is a Samsung player), \"BDWise\".  \"BDWise\" is ALWAYS the best picture---but you would not have that option if the TV and player were different brands.  4) The logic of the TV and player is identical, so you only need to learn one system.  5) You don't have to worry about possible conflicting functions which might result from mixing different brand players and TVs. 3D is particularly tricky and probably requires a close matchup between a player and TV.  Particularly for this first generation of 3D movies, players, and TVs it is probably a good idea to purchase as closely \"matched\" players and TVs of the same brand and generation that you can.Among Samsung players DO NOT assume that a higher price or higher-model-number means more features---In fact, MOST more-expensive higher-model-# Samsung players have FEWER features than the DB-D5500. For example: the DB-D5700 apparently does NOT support (true) 3D.  The DB-D6500 does NOT support simulated 2D to 3D.  The Samsung website has a function which compares Blu-ray players, which is only a little help. Many of the features are redundant---the D8000 TV supports them, so you don't need them on the player.  For example the \"Smart TV\" features, web browsing, simulated 2D to 3D conversion, and wireless connectivity, is redundant (and therefore unnecessary)---because your D8000 TV does these.  On the other hand, you must have a 3D player to play and view 3D movies.  The Samsung website does NOT tell you which features you'll get (or loose) with specific TV-player combinations.HDMI CABLEIn any case, neither the TV nor the Blu-ray player (nor an upscaling DVD player) comes with an HDMI cable.  You have to buy one separately.  Note it is essential to buy the latest model HDMI (cable such as Mediabridge Ultra Series - High Speed HDMI Cable with Ethernet - (6 Feet) - Category 2 Certified - Supports 3D & Audio Return Channel [Latest HDMI Version Available] ) I ordered a 6' cable, changed my mind and canceled, then ordered a 3' cable, which it turned out was too short.  Note that the HDMI connections are about half-way up on the right side of the TV.  So, your player has to be pretty closed beneath the right side of the TV for a 3' cable to fit.HDMI CONNECTIONNeither my player manual nor the TV manual are clear on which HDMI port to use.  The TV appears to \"expect\" to find a DB-series player on ports #2, 3, or #4.  Port #1 is apparently reserved for \"DVI\"(which is actually a contradiction in terms, since DVI is a plug/port type.  Apparently this port is for connecting a computer [or maybe a game box] to the TV with a DVI to HDMI cable)  If use port #1, that seems to confuse the TV, and makes it sometimes difficult for select a \"source\".  Port #2 supports audio-return--although I'm not clear what that is, it works. I used port #2.USB CONNECTIONYou can connect certain USB devices (including thumb drives) to PLAY movies, photos, or music. RECORDING (e.g., for time-shifting like we used to do with VCRs) to the USB devices is a different problem. Apparently this is done regularly in the rest of the World, but is unsupported in the US because of copyright issues. In any case, although thumb drives PLAY fast enough, they do not RECORD fast enough---so to record, you have to plug in a portable harddrive (the same kind of portable harddrive you'd use with your computer), and have an app for the purpose. I have not found a recording app for the BD-D5500, but I have not looked too hard. Of course, if your PC has a TV tuner, you can record TV shows to your harddrive and play them on the TV (through a cable or on a thumbdrive, probably even over your LAN, with the proper app).STREAMING MOVIESSurely you've seen advertisements claiming that you MUST upgrade your DSL and wireless router to stream movies.  NOT TRUE.  First of all, virtually all routers support both physical and wireless connections.  A physical connection with an ethernet cable is FAR better than any wireless connection Mediabridge - Blue RJ45 Computer Networking Cat5e Ethernet Patch Cable - (25 Feet) ($6.50).  However, I was pleasantly surprised that I can watch Netflix movies on my Samsung D8000 (or my Samsung Galaxy Tablet) with my moderate speed DSL and, antique D-Link DI-524 802.11b wireless router (which was considered slow 10 years ago)---with no buffering.  Streaming a movie does slow down simultaneous internet access on a second computer on my home network, but not too severely.  If you have several people streaming movies simultaneously (or playing interactive games over the internet), you may need to upgrade your home network.  You should have a moderately faster router than your DSL: (1) to suck every ounce of performance out of your DSL, and (2) because in practice, a wireless network never operates at its full rated speed (because of low signal strength, interference with other wireless devices, etc.).  Remember that the router is a one-time purchase (and there's probably no need to spend more than $35 on a router), while DSL is a monthly charge.  The cheapest \"n\" series router should be more than adequate for most homes.RELATIVE COSTIf your husband/wife/etc. objects to spending so much money on a TV: Consider dropping cable (~$80/month) and substituting Netflix ($8/month)(or another competitive streaming service)---that's $864 per year vs $96 per year.  72,000 titles on demand---watch them any time you want. You'll save almost enough in two years to pay for the TV.  In Miami, my Samsung TV receives 52 free broadcast channels over the air, all network broadcasts are HD and crystal clear, via my 20-year-old analog antenna.  With Netflix, who needs cable? Caveat: streaming sports services are available at extra cost, so you may want to investigate the details before giving up cable. I don't care about sports, so I can't advise you farther on that one.SUGGESTIIONIf this is your first time setting up wireless connections, enabling content providers, etc., be sure to schedule 6 or 7 hours and be you've taken your Prosiac or Valium first, or find some 12-year-old kid to do it for you in 15 minutes.  Neither the instructions, the online manual, nor customer service is much help.  Example 1) you can't just hook up an antenna, select \"TV\" as the source, choose a channel, and expect to see anything, because the default for \"TV\" is cable.  You have to change the default to \"air\".  Example 2) You can't just click on the \"Netflix\" app, and sign-in to Netflix (as you would with to view a movie on your computer monitor).  Instead, you have to sign-up with Samsung, then sign-in with Samsung, then enable the Netflex access and enter your password etc., THEN you can click on the Netflix app and choose a movie---fortunately, thereafter the TV automatically signs-in to Netflix for you when you select the app.", "Date": "January 9, 2012"}, {"Title": "Absolutely stunning. So much better than the PN64D8000.", "Author": "Stephen Gates \"Steve G\"", "ReviewID": "R2NO53OPPMGMGF", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "When I decided to replace my old digital projection TV I did my homework by doing tons of research and read tons of reviews and ended up buying the PN64D8000. After 2 weeks of watching it I can honestly say that I was never been so disappoint with a \"top of the line\" product from any brand at any price point as I have been with that TV and decided to return it for the UN60D8000. It was one of the best decisions I have ever made because the UN60D8000 simply crushes the quality of the PN64D8000.SAMSUNG UN60D8000 vs PN64D8000The overall image brightness of the PN64D8000 was about 20% darker than any other TV I have ever owned so the picture ended up looking dull and didn't pop off the screen the way I had hoped it would. That overall brightness problem was also complicated by a brightness throttle built into the TV that keeps the picture at or below a fixed intensity. This throttle causes huge consistency problems as some scenes will look perfect and then and you see it kick in when the majority of screen has really light or white content and the TV keeps it from displaying a pure crisp white and instead it throttles it back so you get a muddy light grey. Before anyone tries to tell tell me it was a calibration problem I know that I work professionally in the film and video industry and I know how to calibrate a TV so this was not a problem with the settings. If you read the review on televisioninfo.com so will see that they tested the peak brightness of the PNXXD8000 plasma vs. the UNXXD8000 LED and the plasma scored a 90.43 cd/m2 while the LED scored a 357.93 cd/m2 which is nearly four times as bright.The UN60D8000 is the complete opposite as the picture is bright with pure whites and has the best overall quality I have ever seen on any TV. It handles day to day TV watching through DireTv incredibly well as the picture looks fantastic but when you watch a Bluray this TV is just jaw dropping.OVERALL DESIGN AND SMART HUBThere is no denying that this TV looks beautiful with it's thin edge and it's slim design makes it look fantastic when you out it on the wall. I ended up hanging mine on the wall because the four legged TV stand made me nervous as it was stable side to side but it seemed like it could tip over fairly easily front to back. The Samsung Smart Hub is a nice addition but if I am going to surf the web I would rather do it on my laptop and I found that services like Hulu Plus and Netflix had better picture quality when I ran them on my Playstation 3 vs the Smart Hub. I do use the Yahoo! Smart Apps fairly regularly as it is an easy way to check the weather, items on eBay and the latest tweets without having to flip away from what you are watching.SMALL BLACK LEVEL UNIFORMITY ISSUESThere are a lot of reviews that knock with TV for it's black level uniformity and there is some validity to this but having now owned both of Samsung's top of the line TV's I can tell you they both have a some issues. Most plasma's will throttle back the white level but I never saw one as bad as the muddy and dull whites of the PN64D8000 plasma. At the same time any edge lit LED will have a problem where the edges will look a little lighter than the middle and you get a little of this on the UN60D8000. This TV does have a little of this problem but you will only see when the screen is completely black and on mine it looks like a subtle gradient that goes from a very dark grey to black running right to left. For me this slight black level problem was A LOT more acceptable than the dull and muddy white point on their plasma which just wrecked my watching experience for TV, Bluray and PS3.  If you calibrate your UN60D8000 you can pretty much totally eliminated the black level problem.NO VIEWING ANGLE PROBLEMSI also read a lot of reviews that were really down on the viewing angle of this TV and that it had the narrowest angle of any LED TV in it's class so I had visions of the old projection TV's where if you weren't right in front of it you really couldn't see anything.  My kitchen and living room are one big space with the kitchen sitting to the right of the TV and I've had no problem at all watching from about a 45-60 degree angle while I am cooking. There is no noticeable loss in any detail or contrast unless you are almost standing right next to the TV.I'M NOT A FAN OF 3D BUT THIS MIGHT CHANGE MY MINDI have always thought that 3D was just a gimmick for movie studios to charge more for movie tickets and the movies I have seen with in the theaters never changed my mind. This TV came with two pairs of 3D glasses and I threw my the 3D version of Tron Legacy in to try it out and I have to say it was better than any 3D experience I've ever had in any movie theater. I was when I tried the 3D out with Killzone 3 on Playstation 3 that I saw how really cool this could be. 3D gaming on this TV is really fun and it is something I will be doing on a regular basis.PS3 'MODE NOT SUPPORTED' PROBLEM SOLVEDThe one issue I have with the TV is an issue I never saw in any review and only found out about after I purchased the TV which is that there is an issue between Samsung LED TV's and gaming consoles especially the Playstation 3. When you plug in your Playstation some of the time you will see the TV display an error message suddenly saying 'Mode not supported'. After months of trying different things I found the solution. On your PS3 go to Settings > Display Settings > Deep Color Output (HDMI) and set it to OFF.  This solved all the problems instantly.", "Date": "December 25, 2011"}, {"Title": "Great picture and looks, poor user interface", "Author": "Robbert Patrison", "ReviewID": "RYXYWUG4O9DGC", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "Lets start with the good about this 55 inch LCD set: This is a great looking TV that comes with an elegant base that emphasizes its sleek and thin design. The very thin frame makes it look smaller than it is.The picture quality is excellent: crisp and sharp with a good viewing angle. LED dimming creates strong contrasts. Digital image processing magic enhances motion blur and contrast. This works well without much noticeable side effects.The 3D picture is great, popping right out of the frame. The included 3D glasses are flimsy, but the lightness makes them easy to wear. The 3D blueray player that came with the set is decent, and the supplied animated 3D movies are a blast to watch. There is a 2D to 3D up conversion that is better than I expected. Still you'll probably not use that feature for non-3D content once the novelty wears off. 3D glasses are just not cool enough....I suspect that in practice, 98% of the use of 3D TVs will be regular 2D content. Though nice, the experience is just not comfortable enough for daily use. Apart from the inconvenience of having to wear them, the active shutter glasses create a slight flicker effect. Since the frame rate is effectively cut in half fast objects move noticeably more jerky.Electrical power consumption is very low which can be felt since the set barely warms up after use. This a a huge contrast from the hot 50\" plasma that it replaced. This is  the coolest and most energy efficient TV I looked at in nearly half a century.But this great TV has a number of annoying flaws as well.First, the set I received developed a manufacturing defect in the LCD after just 30 minutes of use, which does not bode well for Samsung's quality assurance. Suddenly a full line of pixels is stuck on. Amazon was quick in sending replacement set. Lest hope that one with survive the burn-in period.The remote looks OK at first sight, with its full keyboard on the back side. Its wedge shape makes it look like a miniature ladies' purse, riddled with buttons on both sides. In practice, it offers a pretty lousy experience.Where do I start? First, it is simply not responsive. It may take seconds for the menu to respond to a button click. This is the least responsive remote I've ever used in 30 years. It seems that Samsung skimped on the processing power of the embedded processor. Sometimes the 'input select' button must be clicked many times to respond. this is necessary because the set does not automatically switch between HDMI inputs. Typing on the dorky keyboard is a horrific experience: it misses keystrokes, or the key bounces to produce two the same characters. It is no match for the Logitech Google TV that has a great full-sized keyboard.In an age of well designed iPad and cellphone user interfaces, it is mind boggling why a TV that costs 5-10x as much comes with a stone-age user interface that is an illogical mess of tiny buttons. Control is simply not intuitive, and worse, each of the apps uses the buttons in a different way. Loads of buttons that are hardly ever used obfuscate the ones that actually matter.  There are colored buttons that are mysteriously called A B C D. Unbelievable that the Samsung engineers who designed did not walk across the isle to talk to their colleagues who are woking on android phones. Or they could have copied the 12-year old design of the Tivo remote and User Interface.The set comes with an e-manual only, that is slow to access and required many clicks to get some info. Anyway, I did not manage to find out whether the remote can replace the control for the assorted set-top boxes and DVD players that are stacked up next to our TV.3 Buttons scattered over the remove start different collections of built-in apps. They are not much to write home about: clumsy and moving jerky compared to a Tivo or Google TV. The Yahoo 'hotapps' are basic widgets for weather, stock news, etc. Since its so much easier, faster and smoother to get the same information from a smartphone, I predict that they will never be used in practice. There is also a web browser, but the above mentioned problematic tiny keyboard makes it near-useless. By the way: even with a good keyboard (such as the Logitech Google TV), browsing the web on a TV is not something that the average buyer of this TV is likely to do more than once or twice per year.The 'social TV' button mixes a rather basic Facebook interface with a TV picture. I totally fail to see the point of this. Facebook or twitter are individual activities that we do in a corner, in bed or in restrooms, not in front of a huge 55 Inch TV with the rest of the family watching.Many of the above usability argument also apply to all other manufacturers of TVs. Fortunately, the main thing we with the the TV is to switch it on or off, as most other contents comes from settop boxes.

You can see little details on the screen you never would have noticed before - from smudges in people's eye make up, to individual pieces of grass moving in the wind. Since we don't have our sound system hooked up yet, we have been able to test out the built in speakers. For such an incredibly skinny tv (less than 2 inches!) the sound quality is very good. I would still recommend getting a sound system to go with it so you can get better range of sound. But if you do not already own one and don't want to shell out the money, the speakers on this sucker will do fine.Samsung's \"Smart Hub\" internet features are wonderful as well. Very intuitive and easy to use. We've already utilized the Pandora and Netflix apps, and are excited to play with others. The double sided Qwerty remote it comes with makes both typing in the apps, and normal tv viewing incredibly easy.We haven't tried out the 3D yet - I'll come back to update how it looks once we do.The only complaint I have is the frameless style.

I honestly can't distinguish any issues with the micro-dimming, or any edge-bleed or even picture uniformity (again, 65\" projection for 10 yrs!). The screen is pretty glossy; but, I purchased an articulating wall mount (Unibrak UNB550). So any glare is easily removed by a slight tilt or swivel of the screen.There was also mention that there's no support for 5.1 surround sound through the SmartHub functionality.

Quite a few neat features but the two I use the most are Netflix and the ESPN app.The TV takes a little time to setup. You need HDMI 1.4 cables all around for 3D to work. You can plug and play your television but you really need to fine tune your picture depending on the source and the lighting in your particular room. I found tuning guides online that helped me adjust my picture. I wish you could universally adjust your picture for all your sources however after spending an hour fine tuning my cable input, I realized I have to fine tune my PC, Blu-Ray, and PS3 inputs separately. This is probably the biggest gripe I have about the television. So plan on spending an afternoon one day fine tuning the picture. The menu's are the most refined either. They are nice but they could be better. Why is the \"gaming mode\" buried so deep in the menu. That should almost be a button on the remote!!! I mean, the remote is nice and handy and has about 150 buttons on it, why not make just one of those a \"game mode\" button? Also, plan on running a wired network cable to this TV. The wireless doesn't work very well. The sound quality of the TV is as expected. You really need to hook up a surround system.Despite a few shortcomings, you'll love this TV. Once you get past the initial setup you can't beat it. The picture is near flawless and the 3D is the best on the market. It really pops out of your set. With any TV, there are always a few quirks. But this Samsung easily makes up for them. The inputs are so nice. They handle things flawlessly. I just plug something in and it recognizes it. Especially if its a Samsung product.Blu-Ray movies and 3D blu-ray movies look spectacular. I received 2 free pairs of glasses with the TV and sent in the mailer for 2 more. They took about 2 weeks to come in the mail. The 3D glasses are light and comfortable. The fit my 4 year old and also fit me just fine. ESPN 3D is also very cool. Comcast carries it in my area.Pairing the remote was easy. Just make sure you are right next to the television. There is no instruction booklet. Samsung decided to include the online version which is a real pain. There is a learning curve with this TV. You will need to spend some time setting it up and learning its features. But wow, is it worth it! I love this TV. The picture is second to none. Don't believe me? Just head to your local best buy and compare this with any other TV. This will blow anything away!

If you are doing research for your tv purchase, you should consider at least the Sony 65\" and Pioneer Elite 60\" or 70\" as comparables.  For the Sony unit, I found it was considerably more expensive and exponentially more expensive for the Elite competitor when compared to the Samsung.My first delivery was refused because of damage during shipping.  The second time was the charm.With me being an audio/video novice, I found little calibration was involved for the tv within home theatre setup.  The Samsung TV's output is absolutely stunning if not impressive to my eyes, right out of the box.  With the help of a friend, the tv was wall mounted and Avatar was slipped into the Blu-Ray player to test the tv's visual capabilities.  My buddy who is an A/V semi-pro was literally awe struck.  2D images appear to have depth.  It's just beginning to feel normal to me but it's not a complaint.  Rather, it's a realization how little detail other tvs can produce for the same video or broadcast.Be aware the screen is glossy.  Even though the tv is installed in a very brightly lit room, there is hardly any notice of glare from sunlight into the tv (I have the tv tilted).One nice feature is the ability to turn off the annoying Samsung light centered at the base of the tv.I have both antenna and cable (cable is thru HDMI) connections to the tv.  The antenna gives the best resolution out of the two.  Watching football from an OTA signal is an amazing experience.The tv is part of a home theatre including an A/V receiver and media server.  Rather than use the built-in wireless wifi, I use an ethernet connection to send movies from the media server to the tv.  The tv and A/V sync perfectly for sound via the HMDI ARC port.  The tv works well with the media server, using the ethernet connection.Now the downside.  After 2 weeks, the settings for the HDMI-CEC 'receiver on' do not keep.  Not sure why.  If you plan to use this tv with an antenna, be aware not all stations broadcast true 1080i signal.  It will become painfully obvious which stations are not broadcasting true HD signals.  If your primary reason to buy this tv is to watch 'regular' tv using an antenna, be prepared to be disappointed for most of the time when viewing programming that is not in true HD.  This is not Samsung's fault but it's a downside. In a similar fashion, it will be obvious which of your cable stations are not in true HD too. Also, Samsung does not use the ethernet capabilities within the HDMI cables but you'll need High Speed HDMI with Ethernet to get the 3D signal to the TV from your A/V receiver or Blu-Ray player.In summary, I would recommend anyone considering to purchase a large screen LED/LCD tv to consider Samsung.PROS:-impressive tv output, right out of the box without any calibration.  This tv makes watching sports (OTA HD signal) a very easy, guiltless thing to do (so much for the to do list).-2D images have depth, especially evident when watching a BR movie or late DVD movie.-single remote for both tv and BR player (both same brand)-automatic update feature (when connected to the internet)-easy integration with a media server-works well with Windows (Vista and 7) based computers on a home networkCONS:-no ability to stream videos directly to the tv using Amazon Prime.  Do an internet search to find more information.  Easy work around is to use a computer or video game console to send the streaming video to the tv.-cannot have the setting kept to turn on the A/V receiver automatically when turning on the tv.  It always default to 'off'.-glossy screen.  Not an issue for me but the glossy screen could be a problem for some.OTHER:-if you are buying this tv online, consider the return policy of the seller before you buy.  Amazon has a great return/refund policy but you may have to wait for Amazon to have the best pricing (it seems to be a cycle when Amazon is the cheapest over their marketplace retailers or other online retailers).  Personally, I can't imagine another online retailer that is better than Amazon for customer service.-you'll definitely need help lifting or placing this tv into place.  It's too big and too costly for a single person to lift it.-there's plenty of options available in setting up and calibrating the tv to your liking.  If you're not too savy with the settings, hopefully, you have a friend that is knowledgable in the A/V arena to finalize the settings/calibration to your liking.-there's a setting to automatically adjust the tv's brightness, based on lighting level in the room.  I keep it on.-if you plan to wall mount a tv of this size, make sure the wall mounting hardware is sturdy.  And the hardware is securely mounted to the wall.  Don't cut corners - mount directly to wall studs or masonry (not to the drywall or the mortar joints).-if you research forums for the different tv offerings, you may come away with the impression all big screen tvs are problematic.  If needed, visit your brick and mortar retailer(s) to help you decide which is the best tv for you.Update:A couple of attempts at 'calibrating' (really, they were small adjustments) to the display unit for bluray movies and tv programming were made in the past couple of weeks. Minor adjustments were made to backlighing, contrast, keep judder low, blur reduction high and automation on.  The results are even more impressive than before!  The best way I can describe it, the picture reproduction is so good it's life-like; it's like a peering thru a clean, clear window onto a scene and witnessing the action unfold in your presence.  Watching the football games using the antenna is a perfect way to see the abilites of this tv to deliver outstanding video to your eyeballs.Streaming videos from a NAS unit is smooth and void of video playback stutter or judder.There's a couple of wishes outstanding: real integration of non-Samsung A/V receivers using the HDMI-CEC protocol (it worked well with my Yamaha receiver before Samsung's mid-December firmware update but not since), and a lack of the Amazon Prime widget is a bit annoying.", "Date": "December 26, 2011"}, {"Title": "Don't hesitate..", "Author": "Jason", "ReviewID": "R1P7OON7QIUIF6", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I watched the reviews on C-Net and elsewhere.

I had read just about every review out there on this Samsung prior to purchasing it.  I was very concerned about the quality issues that many of the reviews spoke about.When the TV was delivered, we were overwhelmed by the picture quality.  It makes HDTV look almost \"too real\".  After watching it for 2 days, we noticed a quality issue - one pixel would stay red no matter what the picture was.  This didn't make much difference in most scenes, but was always there in dark scenes.We called Samsung who passed the service order to a local company.  That company called and determined that a new panel would need to be ordered.  After this, I called Amazon to find out my options.  The customer service agent was incredible!  She asked me 2 questions, then told me she would send a new TV and the defective one would be picked up. Within a week, I had the replacement TV.It's been a few weeks now and there are no issues with this new television.  I haven't noticed any of the clouding that many other reviews complain about.  We played with the display settings, so maybe that's why we don't see it.  And we obsessively check for bad pixels, but haven't seen any so far.The TV is beautiful when off and provides incredible picture when turned on.  The minimal frame around the screen makes the picture look that much better.  3D is fun, but we don't use it often because it requires us to bypass our older receiver.All-in-all, the new TV is great.

I was very disappointed with the Sony in every way, and wished I had done some research first before taking the dive.

It arrived 2 days later and was up and running 10 minutes later. It turned out to be a much easier setup as it was replacing a Samsung HL-S5087W 50\" DLP that we've used with no complaints for the past 7 years.  We also have 5 other HDTV's in the house and knew exactly what we were looking for. The new UN55D8000 took the place of the DLP on the TV stand and after making the connections and actually eliminating two extra cables, we fired it up for the first time and I must say,\"There has been no other HDTV past or present that has the picture or the aesthetics that this model has\". Now, I've read all the horror stories of the \"ghosting\" on the sides or in certain corners and the inability to set the picture up to look just right by the front window or how any light source will throw off the images and wash out the colors. Have no clue where these issues or stories came from but, being an active technician in the industry and also editing some of the film and special effects, hands down, no other TV comes close in display, colors, high-speed graphics, or the presentation of the final image on the screen. And as some people have said, it appears at times, that you are actually in the studio watching the actors shoot the scene as it looks so life like. Others have explained it as if you are looking out a window on the wall and watching people in real time making the movie as you watch them. Folks, this was the whole idea behind the newer technology that started coming out in these models a few years ago and has only gotten better. And the 3D graphics are just as good as any Multiplex Theater offering 3D versions of the current movies they show. I can even select 3D for my normal channels and just watch the kids or the neighbors sit with their mouth's open in amazement. At 1.05\" thick, this 55\" LED HDTV is some of the best money we've spent in a long time. Also, getting the 3D LED's for less than half their cost right now is probably the best money anyone would spend. Even if you never use the built in 3D, these TV's have all of the newest technology built into them that makes them FAR more superior than a regular HD model at the local Best Buy or Electronics Store in your neighborhood. Folks, do yourselves a favor and do some reading and find out for yourself how much more superior these 3D TV's are compared to the standard 720 or 1080 HD models. The next step in the evolution for these HiDef TV's is going to be a simple roll up sheet of active matting that, when unrolled and placed on the wall or table, you will have a 3D TV receiver or your walls will be pre-designed to be and active matrix that will, with a touch of a hand or click of a remote, become a full wall screen able to show multiple screens of your pre-designated channels displaying news, world events, sports, and even your favorite online web sites all at once. \"The future is here and you're in it\"  With that said, this Samsung is the best TV I've seen and now own and am very pleased with the results.

So we started saving up and researching new HDTVs.Amazon's White Glove Delivery was included in the price and a pleasant surprise! The deliverers brought the TV into the house, unboxed it, assembled it, plugged it in, turned it on and tested it out. They even offered to haul away the box and packing materials! SO much better than the local store plopping it in the back of your vehicle and letting YOU deal with it all! While I do try to buy local when I can, Amazon beat the price by hundreds of dollars and the White Glove Delivery was icing on the cake. On to the TV:Folks, for the time being, you cannot get much more top of the line than the UN55D8000. It does pretty much anything you want it to! The picture is brilliant and amazing; and 3D has definitely evolved a LOT since the days of red & blue 3D glasses in the theater! This set even has a 3D Mode that will convert your standard, 2-dimensional shows into a 3D of sorts. Kind of gimmicky I know... but it's there.We bought a Samsung HT-D6500W 3D Blu-Ray Home Theater at the same time, and fully expected the two to talk to each other. They do. They argue.The most egregious example of this was when I point our Logitech Harmony One universal remote at the system and press \"Watch TV\". It's configured to turn everything on (which it does) and the satellite picture and sound came up beautifully... for 10 seconds. Then the input changed! All by itself! It would take 4 steps of going through various menus just to get our satellite back on the TV!After a Samsung technician came out and spent an hour and a half troubleshooting it, we finally found the culprit: a feature called Anynet+ was enabled and for some reason, the Home Theater was changing inputs. Anynet+ is a bell/whistle that really doesn't need to be there... especially if you have a universal remote. What it does is control the home theater's volume and power from the TV remote. Since we use a universal remote, it's entirely unnecessary and causes more problems than it fixes. I'm telling you: if you buy a Samsung Smart TV, a Samsung Smart Home Theater, and a universal remote, the first thing you'll want to do is disable Anynet+ in the settings. Trust me.Don't expect much in the way of sound from this television. I mean, most of it's an inch thick; not much room for speakers in there! Besides, if you're looking for a true home theater experience, you're likely not going to want to rely on the TV's sound anyway for HD viewing. Spring for a Samsung home theater in a box like the HT-D6500.All in all, I wish I could give this TV 6 stars. It's network capable via wi-fi (make SURE you have an 802.11n speed router - b & g speeds won't cut it here); it's 3D, it's brilliant once configured for home use; and Samsung's tech support is top-notch. I cannot recommend it highly enough.The only, and I mean ONLY, possible downside is that the user's manual is ON THE TV. You will be hard-pressed to find a hard-copy user's manual for it. But the guide that comes with it pretty well covers the basics and will have you up and running in no time.If you decide to buy, I hope you enjoy your UN55D8000 as much as we do ours. Just disable Anynet+ and you should be fine.EDIT: I forgot all about this neat little feature called DLNA! If your smartphone is DLNA-capable (like my Galaxy Nexus), it's super easy to stream music, photos and videos from your phone to the UN55D8000 wirelessly! All you need is a DLNA client app on your phone (Skifta in the Android Market works brilliantly; I'm sure there's somethin for Apple products as well). The TV will ask you to allow the source device and off you go. Just hit \"Exit\" on the TV's remote when you're done.

I believe this is why Samsung changed to Blu tooth so soon.UPDATE: i noticed that some reviews were saying they don't get 5.1 audio? Here is my set up Direct TV to my onkyo TX-N509 AV Receiver TV HDMI 2arc HIGH SPEED HDMI cable. I go to Smart Hub and in Netflix picked a netflix movie that has 5.1 audio played it, my receiver shows dolby digital 5.1 also played a movie from vudu also 5.1 so the reports that smart hub doesn't play in 5.1 unless i'm crazy and have the only tv that plays 5.1 this tv supports it.One more thing about this 3D tv it's amazing. My issues are with the number of 3D blu-ray's that are available, NOT VERY MANY. Most of the ones out there are 2D converted to 3D by the studio's. Thor is very dark in 3D and you seem to lose alot of the 3d effect. It's not because of the tv it's the blu ray's. Then on the other hand Beauty and The Beast is beautiful, Megamind is great with lots of color. I can't wait for my Avatar Blu-ray 3d to arrive i'm getting with that Panasonic Blu-ray Promo.", "Date": "November 1, 2011"}, {"Title": "Great TV, simply beautiful", "Author": "TravelGuy", "ReviewID": "R2MTXLKEWW1S8A", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "For context, the TV that this unit replaced was a 32\" Samsung 720p TV that I bought about seven years ago (for $2,500, BTW - a \"bargin\" back then!). I was suffering with that for a long time before the wife decided it was time to build a new entertainment center and I was \"allowed\" to get a new television.What a change this is! The picture quality is not impressive, it's inspiring. The colors are rich, the action appears very smooth, and the detail is wonderful. Sports (especially hockey) is in a different league.Mine is mounted on an articulating arm which extends about two feet from the wall cabinet it is mounted in, and combined with the ultra thin bezel - the TV looks like it's floating in the air. Makes for a great all-around visual.I didn't buy this for the 3D, although it's a nice addition. It's impressive but not \"blow-your-socks-away\" amazing. I've only watched Avatar on Verizon FiOS, so I'm sure it will be more impressive when I get a better content source. The glasses pair up easily, and I get no distraction or headaches from wearing them.The menu system is responsive, the hookup fairly straightforward - although I would have liked a longer power cord, given my specific placement. I'm not using the TV for audio, so can't comment on that.The remote is a bit over the top, of course.And, wow - seems like a lot of folks are complaining about pairing the remote, or pairing the glasses, or getting the wireless network configurations just right. Lucky for us, the TV shipped with a complimentary owners manual and describes all these things in great detail.

Before I buy anything, and I mean anything I research it to death (just ask my wife). So when I finally pulled the trigger on this amazing looking tv I had already read every bad thing any web site had said about it. While researching it I decided to pretend I was interested in other tv's and guess what, they ALL had some bad reviews. I was told by someone I respected that the average person who likes what they purchased never writes a review about it but a large percentage of people who were disappointed with there product were more likely to write a review. Made sense. But, just to hedge my bet I made my purchase with a MasterCard due to there additional warranty. Now on to the review.  I was checking Amazon and all the brick and mortar web sites everyday and when Best Buy lowered there price to 2247.99 I went straight to HH Gregg where they match plus 10 percent! Also bought a Samsung 450 Soundbar while there. Took the whole kaboodle  home and got to work. Mounted it on a Omnimount low profile unit purchased at Sam's Club (another story all together). Turning the 8000 on for the first time walks you thru a few steps the first of is connecting to your wifi. Easy. Waited on Directv to boot up and WOW, the picture floored me. With the low profile mount it looks like a big photo hanging on the wall, it's so slim it don't seem possible. Not being a huge 3d fan i was not expecting to be impressed by any movie but I popped in Mega Mind 3d that came with the 3d kit and quickly changed my mind. Since I have Directv I also decided to watch one of there 3d channels so I turned it to espn 3d and the Auburn -South Carolina football replay was on, It was very impressive, this 3d thing may catch on after all. I have not noticed any banding or light bleeding in on the edges and believe me I've been looking. The only negative I can say is the sound is not very good...kinda muffled. Get a sound bar or another external sound unit. The Smart Apps have worked good ,or at least the ones I've tried( Netflix, SEC Network and YouTube). Surfing the web using this browser may test your patience due to using arrow keys to select hyperlinks. Downloaded the Samsung Remote to my IPad and this didn't help. Oh well, I'll just stick to my pc or iPad for surfing. Hope this helps someone.

The picture is vivid and amazing. Play a movie such as Tangled on it and your family/friends will say \"Wow... I gotta get me one of these!\" Hell it looks great without even being turned on. However, the glossy screen reflects the light from the windows and makes viewing dark scenes unpleasant unless I close the shades.3D is so so. It's amazing to see 3D on your own TV for the first time, but after one or two movies and the wow factor wears off, you may prefer to see the non-3D versions. Not only being slightly dimmer, you will see a slight flickering effect from the included 3D glasses, and might end up with a small headache after watching a film. Still, it's fun to try out and show people.Input lag and latency hell are quite apparent with this TV and the remote. If you want a remote that responds right as you push a button, you will be in for a big disappointment. Also, the remote sometimes doesn't respond and I find myself having to hold it vertical to get it to work. Just doing something simple as changing sources is a chore. With all the buttons, I wish they would of allow you to program favorite channels, especially on the 4 colored buttons. Instead, you have to switch to a favorites list, and then be locked in favorite mode until you switch back to normal channel surfing mode. Maybe there is a way, but I could not figure it out.SmartHub was the biggest disappointment. First off the wireless connectivity is poor. The connection keeps dropping 30 feet from my wireless N router with WPA2. My laptops, phones and tablet work fine from this location and can play YouTube videos. If I do a ping -t to the TV, I get about 8 good responses and then 8 bad responses over and over. Luckily I have a long Ethernet cable I can plug in to test out. The first time you use SmartHub, it updates and downloads some apps. There are other apps you can download or buy. You can almost think of this TV UI as a smart phone, but with the lack of a touchscreen or a mouse, you are quite limited unless you enjoy moving a mouse pointer around with the arrow keys. The first time I had a problem and the web browser would not load, but I could do a software reset and it worked the second time. None of the apps I tried really work great. YouTube starts playing a random (awful) video upon loading and you are left trying to figure out how to stop it. The keyboard remote doesn't even work with it and you have to \"type\" by selecting onscreen letters with the arrow keys. Too bad Amazon Instant Video is not available. I was pleasantly surprised that the TV saw my Windows 7 PC on the network and I could play most media from it. However some codecs were not supported. Good luck trying to find out which ones are! I really wish this could play my .wtv Windows Media Center files that I record onto my computer.Well, the SmartHub part redeemed itself when I found out it could play Blu-ray files directly. I have a Blu-ray drive on my computer and if you use a program such as DVDFab that copies the disc onto your hard drive, the TV can play the .m2ts files directly. No, you don't have to convert it to another format, so the copy is fast. I plug in both my 8GB Kingston USB stick and my Western Digital My Passport 1TB portable drive (yes it reads NTFS!) to the TV and can play media just fine from them, including the 3D content.", "Date": "June 19, 2011"}, {"Title": "Great 3D LCD TV, hugely adjustable but time-consuming to adjust", "Author": "neurotome \"neurotome\"", "ReviewID": "R2XP6HAAF8OOGU", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "There's a lot to say about this TV, and I'm going to say it all.  Short version: great 3D LCD TV, among the best on the market, if you're willing to deal with the hassles of adjusting it; and those hassles are somewhere between minor and major.  Now, either skip the rest of this review, or read on!The model number, UN46D8000, is broken down this way:  UN means an LED backlit TV; 46 is diagonal screen size in inches; D is the 2011 model year; and 8000 is the model number, in this case Samsung's top of the line.  My D8000 purchased at Amazon came with two of the SSG-3500CR 3D active-shutter glasses in the box; the D8000 also varies from the rest of the lineup by introducing Auto Motion Plus, a set of technologies to ensure uniformity of display even when showing fast-motion scenes.The D8000 has a host of technologies, in fact, to deal with the reality of 3D HDTV.  And they matter, because their presence affects 2D viewing as well.  Standard HDTV displays at 24 frames per second.  But the D8000 can show 240 frames per second, which means that it can show 120 frames per second to each one of your two eyes when displaying 3D.  This all but eliminates migraine-inducing flicker from 3D display.  But it means that for every 24Hz frame it gets from your image source, it has to gin up 9 frames out of whole cloth.  What should those frames look like?  How will they smooth the transition from one frame to another - in brightness, in edge motion, in blur?  The Samsung's technologies are actually pretty good at answering these questions, but they can be overpowering.  Luckily a lot of variability is built in if you are willing to explore onscreen menus.With the set off, the screen is gorgeous.  Most of it is high-specularity Gorilla Glass; the ultrathin chrome bezel is my favorite feature of the set, hands down.  Shut off the Samsung logo backlight and hang the inch-thick, 45 lb set on your wall; it looks like a beautifully framed work of modern art.  Now, turn on the display; unlike other TVs, that look like a moving picture embedded in a hunk of grey or black plastic, the D8000 looks like a seamless window into another reality.  Commander Adama in the 1978 Battlestar Galactica had a similar device on his dining room wall.  It looks, to me, like the future.  It makes me excited to turn it on and watch it.The D8000's screen is the highest contrast display I've ever seen.  At full backlight, whites emit an unearthly bluish-purple glow, searing the retina; blacks are slightly crushed but darker appearing than anything else in the room, except maybe the piano-black surface gloss on my Infinity subwoofer.  This is awesome when viewing 3D because the display is still sunlight-bright even with the dimming effect of the 3D glasses (remember that the active shutter blocks about 50% of the light while it's closed, and is not fully transparent even when the shutter is open.)  But when viewing 2D, the contrast has to be turned way down!  Otherwise, you'll feel like you're looking through a window into a science-fiction world where objects glow of their own accord.That said, once adjusted, picture quality is the best I've ever seen, to my eye.  It's unreal how good it is.  It will spoil your eye for anything less.  Uneven brightness?  Some say so.  This feature of the TV improves after a few weeks out of the box - not just getting the settings right; some physical property of the TV is changing as it is used - and, apart CGI images that include a lot of darkness, or letterbox bars, I find uneven brightness not really noticeable.  (The Cinema Black setting, quite welcome, fixes the letterbox problem.)  Watched Pirates 4, a movie with a huge dynamic range in terms of screen brightness and darkness, and never once noted any annoying variability in brightness.On the other hand, any computer game will show you annoying edgelight bleed.  Individual viewers vary hugely on how they feel about this; I think; from poking around the web, I get the feeling that different sets vary as well.  What I see on my set doesn't bug me.  The segmental dimming of the backlight can be shut off if you really want to, but I found that leaving it on looked better; I ended up turning Auto Motion Plus to \"Clear,\" a step less than Standard; and turning off the digital noise filter.  MPEG noise reduction I left set at Low.  With this combo, you can see every blade of grass stuck to a receiver's helmet - can see individual sparkles in the metallic helmets of Navy, Notre Dame or Detroit - but are not bothered by jaggies or edge effects.  However, you can turn the noise reduction all the way up, and crank up the Auto Motion Plus too.  When you overdo it on those settings, you'll get the dreaded \"soap opera effect\" - looks like someone shot your movie on a cheap HandiCam.  Colors are spectacular - great golden yellows, vivid greens, bright reds and blues - and can be tweaked; I found setting Color Tone to Warm1, turning down the saturation a bit, and tweaking the Flesh Tone and R/G tint setting was good enough for my eye.Sports look good - I'm an NFL fan - and 3D college games look awesome, really put you right in the action.  They take a little bit of tweaking and an acknowledgement that in winter, real turf is not green, rather a depressing greyish brown.  SDTV varies from OK to downright unwatchable; if you are a fan of SD infomercials or non-HD-remastered shows from the 60s and 70s, you might want to keep your old set.So: adjustments.  You will need to adjust the standard controls extensively, and probably the medium-deep menu if you just want it to look good.  If you are an AV geek you are going to need to get into the deep menus and you are going to be frustrated and annoyed.  Things that should be one click, like Game Mode on and off (accessed at the beginning and end of each gaming session), or 3D optimization (needed on every play of a 3D movie) are buried 10 clicks deep.  The included QWERTY-chiclet remote is not terrible but no universal remote will ever take over its necessary functions, so you're stuck with it - and you'll need to get to know it.In addition to this, the menu controls are organized haphazardly and have hidden \"features\" - for instance, enabling Game Mode under System under General disables most of the Picture Options under Picture.  When you try to then edit one of the disabled options, are you given the choice of disabling Game Mode?  No, you're told to go do it yourself.  There are dozens of things like this; I've been fooling with it for the last few hours and have no idea what I've done to grey out the Picture Options -> Advanced Settings sub sub menu.  Nor will I ever know; I've given up.  I am dismayed about the amount of time I have to spend in these menus; and by the fact that a set of settings, once adjusted, cannot be saved; enough so that I docked the D8000 a star in my star ratings.  Samsung, are you listening?Smart TV is a mixed bag.  After playing with it for a few minutes you'll realize that you're in the middle of a war for control of your eye time, and Samsung clearly means to be a big player, even if that means screwing its customers over in the short run.  Samsung will not play with any MacOS or iOS device, and unlike the 2009 and 2010 models, it doesn't do Amazon Prime Streaming either, adding to my large collection of internet-capable AV devices which ought to receive Amazon Prime Streaming, but don't.  Built-in Netflix cannot take advantage of the QWERTY keyboard - you have to use arrow keys to find letters off an onscreen menu - and at first glance it seems that you can't get any access to the video adjustments while watching Netflix.  (Not true; the Menu button is indeed disabled, but you can back into a limited version of the onscreen menu by hitting Tools instead.  Obvious, right?  Not.)  I liked Samsung's ever-rotating array of 3D content.  I disliked the fact that in order to play something through Smart TV, I had to run a separate SPDIF audio cable back to my receiver; the TV won't, as far as I can tell, run Audio Return back through HDMI while you're watching something on it.  Samsung clearly intends that this TV be able to replace your receiver - except for the part where it doesn't power your external speakers - but I wish they sold it in a model that had all the Smart TV and extraneous input ports eliminated, because I'd like to be able to get into a display of this quality for $800.Buy the set from Amazon and take advantage of their price match - check back in 14 days and if the price has dropped, Amazon will refund the difference.

The color, precision, field of view; it's all superior to any other set that I have seen. However, the 'Samsung Apps' are nearly worthless. For example, the Netflix plug-in has less functionality than my ancient Roku box and delivers no better image quality. The YouTube app is really bad; it always starts with a dorky video that I hate. You can't change that or start YouTube in search mode. Which leads to my other big disappointment with this set: the 'full keyboard' remote. It is so non-intuitive that even a teenager will never figure it out! You have to press an 'enter' key before you can start typing (sometimes you don't have to- but it's not clear when), then when done typing you have to press 'enter' again. Seriously, that kind of user interface went out in 1955; where do they get these people? The keyboard itself is just a bunch of chicklet keys jammed together without any thought that somebody might want to type on it. It's actually easier entering text with the keypad on the 'standard' side of the remote. Other annoyances include the fact that the 'AllShare' feature is unable to load files from my XP computer.

The Picture quality, the design and I will add again the picture quality.  I went from a high end Panasonic Plasma that has a great picture to an amazing life like picture.Here are my thoughts after having the TV setup for 2 weeks:-Design: This is a complete new look for TV's.  The thin edge looks great!  It also allowed me to replace a 51\" tv with the 55\" in the same custom cabinet.  It fits perfect and the TV only weighs 34 lbs. (5 stars for sure)-Setup:  Easy to setup.  the challenge was pairing the keyboard remote.  I had to call customer service and they instructed me to pair it within 8\" of the TV.  That worked, but the 8\" instruction is not in the manual so I spend a lot of time trying to pair before I called support.  The out of the box settings did need some adjustments, but that was easy.  They has contrast and brightness at 100% I changed it to 50%.-Picture Quality: Amazing, real, life like are words that come to mind. This is also where I have my 1 issue with the TV.  The picture is great most of the time, but I do get significant MOTION BLUR when watching basketball and sometimes when watching a non sports program.  I have called support and they has me try several of the Motion Plus Settings.  None were able to fix the motion blur.  This is tough for me as I watch a lot of basketball.  I'm still trying to resolve this.  I have a AV guy coming to check it out next week.  This could be a deal killer if I can't resolve this.  I hope it can be fixed as I can't justify $3000 for a TV that I can't watch sports on.-Sound: I have no idea.  I have all my audio go through my AVR.-Smart TV:  I was really looking forward to these features, but as I played with them I realized a few things.  1. I run all my components through a Denon ARV then HDMI to the TV from the Denon.  this causes a little issue when the TV becomes the source.  The new HDMI 1.4 does support ARC (audio return) but it requires input changes every time.  Not a big deal but it is an issue.  2.  The speed of the Apps are supper slow and I have the TV hard wired directly to the router for internet  3. Some of the Apps do not support the keyboard remote.  For example youtube requires you to use the navigator arrows to enter each letter.  4. The link to my desktop for picture and content is painfully slow.  Overall I plan to go with a D-Link Boxee or Apple TV for this type of functionality. Nice to have but will not use it on the TV.-3D: I have not tested this yet.

This TV will not stop trying to adjust the black levels.  They go from beautiful black to a light grey and flicker back and forth.  It only does it with scenes that have a lot of contrast.  The TV seems like it's trying to even it all out.- TV remote is not a learning remote.  So I still need one remote for the TV and one remote to turn the stereo up and down.- NONE of the third party apps that come with the TV are compatible with the QWERTY keyboard on the back.  You still have to use the arrow keys to type.- For some reason, none of the video apps allow the screen to be resized.  Got that TV episode on Netflix but it's in 4:3?  Guess what?  You have to watch it in 4:3.Again, issues that should NOT be present in a \"flagship\" model.  Get with it Samsung.

It has a super sharp, almost edgeless display that would please any technophile, and plenty of settings and content apps. It was also lightweight enough for me to wall mount it solo -- be sure to hold it vertical (as it would be on the wall) to prevent the TV from sagging (i.e. possibly damaging) if lifted horizontal.I do have a couple of suggestions and issues to mention though (since people want to know about them more than the features which they can read up on themselves). They are as follows:1) The remote control will go through batteries fast. I burned through my first set of 4 AAAs in just under 3 months. My thought is since the remote has a sensor to know which side of the remote is facing up (to know which side not to accept input from [minor complaint]), it uses power whenever the remote is moved. Well, mine sits on the recliner with me and moves a lot, so I hope that is the reason.2) The TV comes set up with the Auto Motion Plus feature turned on which increases the frame rate of the picture. This creates the super crisp, surreal look (aka soap opera effect). When viewing 3D content, you want to use this feature so you get the crispness you would see at, say, IMAX 3D. Not so good though for 2D content. Turning it off though dulls the image. I instead recommend using the Clear setting for 2D content. Better frame rate, but almost no surreal look. Okay, that was the suggestion, and now the complaint. This option is at the end of several nested menus -- it takes 10 steps (button presses) to reach it. Switching settings will get monotonous if you vary your viewing greatly.3) This is more a suggestion; remember that the 3D glasses are motion sensitive to know when to turn themselves on. I did not know this and was surprised when they depleted after only a few days. I therefore suggest you store them on a flat surface somewhere out of the way and not hang them on top of the TV's edge where they will stay on constantly due to the vibrations from the speakers.", "Date": "April 10, 2012"}, {"Title": "Beware of dead pixels on the screen", "Author": "Rudy Escobar", "ReviewID": "RKAW522V6ZHXO", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "LED and LCD have a history of having dead pixels on the screen.

There has been no problem so far. I mounted it on the living room wall with a fully adjustable bracket. I can literally have this TV positioned 2 feet from the wall, and 15 degrees down facing me, which makes it look like it's a 70\"!! The shipping company did well around the New Year ( bought it Christmas Day), but I did opt to pay an additional $60 for the delivery company (MANNA) to deliver to me after hours, due to my strange work hours. I bought this TV on Amazon, through Video & Audio Center, located in Santa Monica, CA. I didn't feel like paying extra for shipping, and the TV was in NYC in 4 days.I toned the contrast & color down a little from factory settings,( to get more life out of it), and the picture is always amazing. The 3D is pretty nice too. It came with 2 battery operated 3D glasses that synced very easily with the TV. I had a $45 coupon for Best Buy, and found the Samsung Megamind 3D Starter Kit for $129, so I only spent $84 for the Megamind 3D Blu Ray Kit, while Amazon was selling it for $184. Have Megamind, all Shrek 3D Blu Rays, plus ANOTHER pair of Samsung battery operated 3D glasses. The style is different, but they still work with the 2011 and up Samsung 3D TVs. Colors, and the picture are always phenomenal!! I checked out Megamind, IMAX Under The Sea, and Thor 3D's and the 3D looks nice. Blacks are black.The Smart TV hub found my router quite easily. Many people complain about not having Amazon Prime Instant Video. I have it, as I have a Google TV, and a Roku XS2. Each one can be had for about $100. I will be putting the Roku in the basement workout area feeding 2 32\" LCDs later. Right now I have 4 HDMI cables visible going to the TV's right side. I need a 3D reciever to fix the clutter. I've decided on a Onkyo 709, and new surround speakers w/ sub. I didn't get that yet, but need to as my older Sony surround is on it's last legs.

I had done quite a bit of research about a year ago when I needed a new monitor, and was impressed by the quality and expertise of Samsung.  Since a purchase was finally emminent, I went into overdrive to find the perfect set, since we tend to keep these kind of things until they die, as opposed to frequent upgrades regardless of price.I did go to a couple of stores and just watch TV with no attempt to see who was who, concentrating only on the pictures and any distracting artifacts.  Since this was just in time for the Christmas buying season, there were vast numbers of sets to watch.  After a short time, I was convinced that I would go with an LED simply for the green factor and energy use.  There is nothing wrong with a television that is only an inch thick, either, as a wonderful update to the room decor.The television won me over with the creatative design touches, outstanding picture quality noted in several store displays, and an Amazon price that was actually quite a steal.  I was able to purchase the 46\" model for less than $1600, free shipping, no sales tax, and two pair of 3D glasses in the box.  I ordered on Thursday and it was delivered the following Monday.The picture quality right out of the box is acceptable, but nowhere nearly as nice as you can get by spending some time fine tuning the very numerous picture settings from the onscreen menu.  I had already had our service upgraded to HD from our satellite provider, so we were pretty much ready to go.  I have yet to add a sound bar to the system, since this sets in my living room, and I am not sure that we are ready for surround sound on a constant basis.  Hubby tends to turn things up too loud as is, so I have decided to live with the sound provided for the time being.I am NOT one of those people who can give you concrete settings that will get you the one and only BEST picture for every use.  That being said, there are several forums and blogs that deal with ideal settings easily available on the internet, and a new owner should really turn there for help in fine tuning the picture.  At the end of the day, I changed a couple of small things that I prefered despite the best guidance from the video gurus.  Remember, there is no harm in making a setting and then going back and changing it in a day or two, after watching the television and judging your opinion of whether or not you want darker, faster, or even 3D vs 2D.I do recommend that one person be pretty much in charge of programming the settings, and telling everyone else to stay off the menu.  I have tweaked it based on the observations of what family members like and don't like, and I tend to work on it at night when it is quiet and there is little distraction.  Use the guidelines, then proceed based on your individual tastes.The picture is excellent, sound very nice for what comes installed, and the programming is volumenous but straight forward.  We do not have the internet connected to the tv yet, since our DSL does not match the recommended 10 mb/sec yet.  In addition, we have laptops around the house, so for us this is a television first, internet portal a distant second.We have had it up for a month or so, and I can say I would definitely buy this model again.  While looking at the different models, I did not find any other tv that matched the color accuracty and the smooth action flow of the UN46D8000.  I considered the 55\" model, but just couldn't bring myself to turn loose of the extra money right around Christmas.  Since this replaces a 13 year old machine, the size at 46\" will still blow you away.  We use this as a tv, not a theather, so the size works for me without totally overfilling the room.I did buy the Square Trade warranty for this unit, and I do use an uninterupted power source for electrical connections to minimize the damage that can be done with small daily power surges.  It is a fine piece of electronic masterpiece, and I just want to give it the best chance to live a long and healthy life!Buy this tv for quality.Shop around for best price.Know what you are willing to pay.Be patient waiting for a great deal to come your way.And then comes the final detail - enjoy the picture every time you turn on the tv!Hope this helps.", "Date": "January 9, 2012"}, {"Title": "GREAT TV, remote needs work", "Author": "BEER_ME_in_CT", "ReviewID": "R1TN5IG14QHU1X", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I have read alot of reviews on this TV and recently decided to purchase it. The first thing I want to say is that the TV CAN be configured to eliminate the screen uniformity issues that alot of people have. All you have to do is pump up the backlight setting and decrease the brightness. Also, for those that complain of the \"daytime soap opera\" picture effect, you need to set the \"automotion plus\" feature to \"clear\".

All that in an energy efficient, light, thin package with GREAT industrial design. It is a beautiful TV even when its off.Gaming and Blu Ray look fantastic. HDTV looks decent but I just think the TV is too good and shows alot of little minute flaws in alot of the so called \"HDTV\" broadcasts. Some looks crisp, some look a little weird. It is a 60\" screen so it magnifies things a bit. I havent even tried streaming everything because that crap looked terrible on my 50\" TV so this one its going to look even more terrible. Netflix, you have a LONG way to go with video quality.Now, I gave the TV 5 stars because I dont intend to ever use the remote that came with the TV.

I know that based on my preliminary use of the set, I am in complete awe. Installation was quick and painless, the set is not too heavy and fit on a glass furniture set I was previously using with a 46 inch Samsung LCD TV. Like other reviewers, I think the base for this model is a little odd looking and kind of clashes with the overall design of the TV set. However, I buy televisions for how good they look while watching and this tv definitely delivers.The image quality is amazing when playing HD signals. I did notice a little clouding during all black scenes in between pauses in movies, but nothing that would have me return the tv. Regular DVD's look great as well, but things like compression and pixelation do show up since everything looks so clear. I found that Movie mode reduces the amount present on the screen.3D is also great. I purchased the Samsung 3D starter pack which brings the Shrek movie collection and the effects are phenomenal. I can only imagine what actual 3D movies like Avatar would look like on this set. The 2D to 3D conversion on the television also works great, especially with animated films. I tested the effect with Disney's Beauty and the Beast Blu-ray (Non 3D release), and it was spectacular, as if it had been made in 3D. Both my wife's jaw and my own were on the floor during the test. I had the family over to watch Lord of the Rings on Blu and they couldn't believe how great everything looked.The Smart Hub feature is hit or miss like others state in their reviews. The Netflix app was slow to load and sign in, and I accidentally used the wrong password causing the app to get stuck on the loading screen without telling me that I had input the wrong code. I had to exit the program and sign in again to get it to work. The picture quality was pretty good, I tested Death Wish 2 in HD and although a bit soft (which may have been the film itself) everything look HD. I was disappointed that the included keyboard remote does not allow you to type in titles on Netflix search, instead having to use the arrows. This kind of sucks as one expects it to function across all apps included in the smart hub. I'll stick to using my Apple TV for netflix.I did enjoy the 3D samples included in the Smart Hub. This gives everyone who owns the television a preview of how great things can look in 3D if they get the right equipment. My Xbox 360 worked great on the television and the game mode although hidden deep in the menu system did improve the appearance of the game I tested. Arkham City takes over the entire area of the screen and immerses you in the world of the game.

You are paying a premium price for a well engineered, minimalist in appearance set. There are plenty of TV's that offer the same screen size that are significantly cheaper.With that out of the way - This TV is amazing. I pondered this purchase for months - Reading pro and con reviews, seeing the sets in person, and going through blogs before making the decision to pull the trigger. I am amazed with the black levels that this set produce which contrast well will the vibrant colors that the set produces. Further, the Micro Dimming plus feature only available on this model and the 7900 continues to enhance contrast levels by automatically brightening and dimming small sections of the TV when said brightness is not needed. You can clearly notice this higher-end feature than on a set that does not have it.The 3D experience with this set was as expected. No cross-talk or noise was noted in the picture. The 3D effect had slightly more depth than my passive 3D set, and produced a great 3D picture. The glasses are significantly lighter and less annoying than previous generation active 3D glasses.I easily mounted this set to my master bedroom wall using the old Samsung Slim-Profile mount kit from a 40 inch Samsung LED that this set replaced. The kit worked fine, however the length of the screws was slightly too short, and required me to run to the local home warehouse to purchase longer screws. No biggie.Also, it was frustrating to get the included remote to work with the set. I tried everything to pair the remote, with no prevail. Finally, a search on the internet revealed that pairing cannot occur across a room, and you must be within a foot or two from the set for pairing to work. I moved close to the TV, and reinitiated pairing, for which it finally worked. This may be included in the directions somewhere, but it was not immediately noticed by me.In short, I wonder if the individuals who had issues with this unit had earlier build models that are different from those shipping now. This TV is by far the best I have purchased, and well worth the price paid. The ultra-slim bezel is an engineering and design wonder, and is actually very \"Apple Like\" with its minimalist appearance. I wouldn't spend the extra money on this set if you do not plan to wall-mount it, as this set is meant to be hung on a wall like a frameless canvas painting.", "Date": "August 7, 2011"}, {"Title": "Great Picture Quality!", "Author": "sanjokidd", "ReviewID": "R10H20FRCUQ36D", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I highly recommend this TV for anyone looking for an awesome natural looking picture.

I kept hanging on waiting for this TV to come out only to be disappointed when the thin bezel never materialized.  Maybe Samsung realized the edge lighting for such a large TV would not work with the ultra thin bezel?  Makes you wonder about the smaller screen Samsung TV's that have the thin bezel.

That might change during the course of time and I'll update accordingly.This review is not very technical it's just a layman's average Joe-consumer perspective. I was waiting for a handful of the high-end models to drop below $2000 before considering purchasing them and once they did I went on doing my comparison. So from my perspective after going around several stores including essentially one-stop stores that sell high-end TV's to electronics big box stores like Fry's to specialty/high-fidelity stores just to visually compare the different models side-by-side, if not from a distance when they weren't next to each other, both the UND8000 and UND7000 series (2D wise) were probably the brightest and most brilliant colors of the bunch (e.g., comparing with similarly priced and sized models like LG Infinia 47LW6500 and LE8500, the Vizio XVT3D47SV, Sony Bravia KDLEX720 series and Bravia KDL-NX720 series). The only place I found the Sony Bravia XBR46HX929 was at a Sony store and it-was the only other model I really liked better and it was exactly what I was looking for, but that was beyond my price range. So, that was out.Sure, this model has some issues with clouding on the edges, it-is an edge-lit LCD after all, so I expected some of that, but I believe the UND8000/7000's local dimming actually works really well to minimize that affect and bring about the darks more evenly and thus, to me, it's not that distracting. Besides the TV sits in a room that's not dark anyway so the clouding is negligible. I wouldn't get an edge-lit LCD if it was going into a dark or blacked out room-I'd probably get a plasma. I like the fact that objects to the rear aren't reflected on the screen when I'm watching except, to some extent, in dark scenes. Then again, I don't have any rear lighting; all the lights are coming from above. The only bothering part aesthetically to me was at the bottom of the TV is a notch (i.e., in the UND8000 series; the 7000-series is a uniformed frame) that frames a \"Samsung\" sign that is lit by default when you turn the TV on (it can be turned off, but why even have it?); to me it's just a distracting design feature. Paring the QWERTY remote was pretty easy, but I could see some frustration if it wasn't done right the first time. Connecting to my home's wireless network went pretty smooth. Enough HDMI connections (on the right edge of the TV) for my use (I only really need two, one for my receiver and everything else is connected to that and one for the DVD. Others may need more.) and antenna connection that's angled down instead of perpendicular to the set. Yes, I use an antenna since I don't want cable. Streaming so far has been smooth, but I do it through my Blueray. Navigating the web is okay, but I don't use my TV for that. Samsung has several apps that I've yet to try so that's for the future update.To me the sound is not spectacular, but it's far better than average. Again, for as flat as it is, I'm surprised at the surround-sound-like quality. I haven't had to adjust the sound yet becuase it's \"accurate\" enough for me. Now, if I'm watching some epic movie where \"sound effects\" are part of the experience and I just need more bass or something, that's when I use my amps, but that probably goes with all TV's regardless. So, sound to me is a non-issue. A lot better than many flat screens I've listened to.The 3D is actually pretty decent; I watched NFL on 3D and I think I prefer watching it on 2D. But with 3D you really need to have the monitor fill out as much of your periphery as possible, i.e., the further you sit back the larger the TV should be. Otherwise, it just has a \"3D feel\", but not necessarily a \"3D experience\", I'm not sure how else to describe that. Regarding the weight of the glasses, I'm not sure what folks are talking about when they claim it's \"heavy\", the 3D glasses that came with the set are pretty light to me; like the weight of a couple of passive ones that you get from the theater.  I suppose I could've gotten the UND7000 series and saved a bundle, but for something I would, at most pay $1800 for with additional features a bit better 3D that I got essentially for the price of UND7000-series on sale, plus the two 3D glasses in tow, I couldn't pass it up (i.e. $1339 on \"deal of the day\" on Amazon). But just in case something does go wrong (it is a \"Samsung\" and Samsungs are known for frequent repairs versus Sony's, but less frequently than Vizio's or LG's) I went to Costco and bought SquareTrade's 3-year extended warranty for $99 for TV's costing more than $1000 and starts AFTER the manufacturer's warranty expires which is 15 months after the date of purchase (when you register your UND8000, Samsung adds 3 months warranty on top of the standard 1 year warranty); when you buy the SquareTrade warranty from Amazon that retails for $149 that warranty begins at the purchase date.So, yes price did indeed factor in when determining the rating I gave this product, because for the price I bought it at, I was essentially now comparing it to the lower-end models of the spectrum of the high-end models...and the UND8000 blows them all away and that's a 5-star in my book.", "Date": "January 24, 2012"}, {"Title": "Great 2D and 3D TV", "Author": "ssjenny1 \"ssjenny1\"", "ReviewID": "RP8JPORTSV3YQ", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "My husband is definitely the electronics guru (aka geek) of the family, but I've been very pleased with his selection and purchase of this tv. I can't go into the technical specs (its mostly mumbo jumbo to me) but I can say that the picture quality seems much better than the 52 inch Sony Bravia XBR6 that it replaced. The colors are brighter and vivid and it doesn't have the motion blur that the Sony had.PROs:Watching movies and sports in 3D has been amazing. The picture seems crystal clear and the glasses that come with the tv don't give me a headache, unlike the ones in the movie theater. There doesn't seem to be much angle distortion. Our recliner is offset from the tv but 3D can be viewed from there without any problems. The fact that the tv is \"smart\" has actually been much more useful than I expected. We have used the apps quite a few times, for streaming movies from Netflix, keeping up to date on sports scores, checking the weather forecast, and of course for keeping my husband occupied. The tv stand is much nicer than the bulky one that the Sony had. It's definitely easier to dust the media console now, plus you can swivel the television on the stand somewhat. I really love the super tiny beveled edge of the tv and how slim it is too, very clean lines and no distracting frame.CONs:The remote control is not very ergonomic and you're unable to pick it up and know which way is forward (which may seem silly but when the room is darkened to watch a movie it's nice if you can just pick up the remote, point it, and know where the volume control is). The remote is also extremely crowded, on both sides, with a ton of keys which seem to me to be unnecessary. The conversion from 2D to 3D that the tv offers was an attractive feature to me (considering how limited the market still is on 3D movies/channels) but it is an extremely poor conversion, distorts the images, and after trying it out on a couple different channels I doubt if I'll ever use it again.I can't review the sound quality of the tv as we have it connected through our surround sound system. Overall, though I was reluctant to let him buy it, I'm very happy with my husband's purchase. We both have enjoyed watching the 3D that is available and everything else looks great on it too.

After bringing home this 2011 Samsung 55\" 8000, it's finally come to satisfying end.We started with a Sony 55\" HX909 (or something, their model numbers are beyond non-sensical). The TV worked for about 15 minutes and then failed. Sony offered to send a tech out, but we declined. When it did run, the sony had a great image. We instead opted to have it returned (amazon made this really easy).Having already bought Sony 3D glasses and IR dongle, I tried another sony, the 55\" NX810. It had a beautiful design and mostly worked. Unfortunately, there were two dark spots on the screen. Other than those two dark spots, the NX810 was a good TV. We did notice a little weirdness with the local dimming causing the whole image to sometimes get noticeably brighter and dimmer when there was a scene that was just on the cusp. The 3D was decent, but 3D video where there was a lot of contrast between something in the foreground and background did bleed through a fair amount. We called up sony about the dark spots and they had a company that services TVs get in touch with us for a fix under warranty. The company indicated the panel needed to be replaced but the replacement was on backorder. After a week or two, we got a call from Sony offering to replace our TV since the part was on backorder. A few weeks after that, we got a call again from Sony indicating the TV was on backorder and wouldn't be available for 2 months. We got in touch with Amazon and they coordinated to have the TV returned.The day HomeDirect came to pick up the NX810, we went to our local BestBuy to check out TVs in person. The new 2011 Samsung 55\" 8000 was our favorite. After all the problems we had with the last two TVs, we decided to purchase at a brick and mortar store so we could easily return the TV when it failed to live up to our expectations. We loaded the Samsung in the back of a corvette (the TV box, like the tv, is relatively small) and drove it home. It wasn't as nice as Amazon's service, but we were nervous about getting a third bad TV.We unpacked the TV and it was awesome. When we bought the TV, we got a starter kit with glasses. Apparently they don't use IR for the 3D glasses anymore, they've moved to bluetooth according to the sales guy in the store. The 3D on the Samsung blew away the 3D on the Sony. All of the ghosting we saw on the Sony was gone. Tangled 3D, Shrek 1 3D and GranTourismo 5 looked great.I love this TV. it looks great when it's off. The picture quality looks great when it's on. To top it off, it works really well with my new Onkyo receiver. I needed an HDMI 1.4a switch to pass through the 3D from the PS3. I couldn't find any HDMI 1.4a switches, but the Onkyo receivers weren't too expensive, so I got a TX-NR708 or something like that. The frustrating thing about TVs has always been getting audio from the TV back to the receiver. With HDMI 1.4a, there's an audio return channel. The same HDMI cable that carries audio and video from my stereo receiver to the television can be used to send audio from the television back to the receiver. I did fail to get this working at first as the audio return channel is only supported on HDMI2 (labeled as ARC on the back of the TV). A quick perusal through the manual clarified this. Since we would never use the TV tuner (live TV, this day in age? Come on, who watches TV without a DVR?), I didn't think this audio return channel thing would be all that useful but the TV has support for Hulu, Netflix and Pandora built in. Starting up these apps on the TV cause the receiver to automatically switch to audio from the TV. The TV itself will turn the receiver on and off and when the receiver is on, the TV automatically disables the TV speakers and the volume control on the TV remote actually controls the receiver volume. I didn't have to spend hours figuring out how to set all of this up either, it just worked.To be fair, the Sony also managed to seamlessly with the receiver, so this seems to be a standard that new TVs have adopted. In my mind, this is a much bigger revolution in entertainment than 3D.It is nice that the remote has a flip side with a qwerty keyboard. The qwerty side of the remote uses bluetooth instead of IR and must be paired. As noted in some of the other reviews, the pairing is tricky to get working. You will have to hold the remote inches from the TV (for pairing only, and you only need to pair once) and probably try multiple times. I ended up getting my remote in a weird state where I couldn't pair it. Calling tech support, the phone tree wasn't deep and I didn't have to wait on hold. The technician informed me of the trick of holding down the @ and backspace buttons for a few seconds to reset the remote. After that, the pairing worked on the first try. It was disappointing the reset magic wasn't included in the manual, but Samsung more than made up for it by having a live person for me to talk with that required no hold time.Keep up the great work Samsung!", "Date": "April 2, 2011"}, {"Title": "Great design...poor execution", "Author": "MDLIFE", "ReviewID": "R33TQ6L5S8EVP4", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I feel like I am the test market for Samsung.

I got my tv home and set it up, I must say the picture quality BLEW ME AWAY............!!!!!! It looked twice as good as it did when i saw it on demo in the stores in Virginia and I was loving my new tv.Then the trouble started, two months after my purchase, the tv started shutting off by itself, then one day it refused to come back on all together.  Knowing i'd have to ship this back to the US for warranty repair and the high costs associated with that I decided to take it to my local repair depot and have them look at it.  I knew i'd be voiding any warranty but i figured it was a small issue, boy was I wrong.  After they investigated and made calls to Samsung repairs specialists, I received a call that the television had previously been repaired but was still sold as new. I've had to take the full loss since I initially voided warranty but it's left a bad taste in my mouth.

It was on its last month of warranty when this happened, so the Tech came out and said he never saw this before. he ended up replacing the 2 boards but the issue was still there. he then tried to order a new panel, but they were on back order for over a month, so they had to replace it. This TV was the best TV when it was working, but for $3,000 I would expect it to last way longer than a year. After all this, I researched online and saw that I'm not alone. There are thousands of others with this model and other models having issues right after the warranty ends. Samsung's quality control seems to be getting worse. Something is up with their Firmware updates and Smart Hub updates IMHO. I had settings wiped out on my 2012 ES8000 after its very first update. A setting that helps mask the clouding and flash-lighting. Owners in the UK had their Black Enhancer setting along with another setting wiped out of theirs which forces them to use Standard mode only since movie mode shows too much clouding. This is NOT right. Please do your homework before buying any set from this manufacture.This LED is the best TV I ever bought, and had ever! I loved it so much that I bought 4 of them for different rooms at my place.  The colors just pop on this TV. The picture is super clear and has inky black levels. I also bought the 2012 ES8000 when it was first released since one of the presidents said on stage at the 2012 CES that this new ES model will have better black levels, and a better overall picture but that turned out to not be true since my D8000 has a way better picture than my ES8000 models. I had a professional calibrate both models and even he said the D8000 has better contrast and black levels. So glad I bought 4 of these since they no longer make them.

My first impression was that the picture quality was fabulous compared to my previously owned  65inch 720p rear projection tv.  The tv is very thin (an inch) with a stylish bezel, and I love the swivel design, weighing only about 50 pounds.  Everything looks very life-like and bright at 1080p.  It's very smooth at a 240hz refresh rate and the 3d looks fabulous, but it only comes with 2 active 3d glasses, which is sometimes annoying with the flickering, common with active glasses.  You can also convert 2d to 3d with a  push of a button.  I wish they'd include more of these glasses.  I've watched movies like transformers: dark of the moon, girl with the dragon tatoo and Tron: legacy, and the picture is astonishing.  The colors are very vibrant, the picture is sharp, and their blacks are reallyyyy black, thanks to their SmartDimming tech.This tv has 3 usb ports, 4 hdmi ins, optical out, along with a component and AV in.  I dont use any of these but an hdmi to my receiver. There are so many features on this tv, that I can't even keep track of them.  There is a Smart Hub feature that allows you to go on Netflix, hulu, facebook, and web browser.  I've watched Netflix a few times but for some reason, the video flashes every 10 minutes.  Another bothering thing is that none of the apps in the Smart Hub support 5.1 or surround sound.  Thats when I switched to blu-rays.There's also an app called Allshare that lets you view video and music files from your laptop, but it doesn't mirror your laptop's screen.The remote is quite sleek and advanced, and has a nice qwerty remote on the end.  I love the HDMI-CEC (Anynet+) so I can control things like my PS3 with just my remote.There is one big complaint: the 3d glasses stopped functioning after about a month.  I contacted samsung support and they were horrible, going in circles and asking me to follow procedures that I already tried for hours.  In the end, they got a technician to replace the bluetooth module that communicates w/ the 3d glasses and everything was perfectThe sound is like usual for LED tvs: horrible and lacking bass.  Instead, I bought an Onkyo HT-S5400 sound system and it compliments its appearance quite well.Overall: for the value, features and performance, it is the best out there.

I currently have an LG LED 47 inch 240HZ set and couldn't believe the difference even though i love my LG set.  I asked the sales person if the Samsung TV set was set up differently than all the others?  He answered no, we have them all set the same.  I believe he said vivid.  I ask him well, why is this set picture was so crisp and clear even right up close?  He answered, that he beleives that Samsung just had a better screen than most other brands.I am not usually impressed by products being displayed at a store however I was this time.  Well, I looked up the reviews on the net and most spoke very highly of the set.  Of course there are always something that a particular person would like or not like, even me.

Before i had full HD to the house I did watch some standard Def channels that were fuzzy, but that's to be expected when you take a low quality signal and blow it up 4 times larger than it was ever made to be seen clearly.The sound is actually really good if you enable the enhanced audio. Now remember that this TV is only 1\" thick, so getting anything other than average sound was not expected. A note though, make sure it has a wall behind it to reflect the sound. Free standing the TV away from a reflective back surface will make the audio sound weak.WARNING!/NOTE! The low profile TV wall mount I purchased was an up-sell from the vendor. I wasted $100 doing this. The UN55D8000 has sunken screw threads for the Samsung low profile puck mounts. This leaves a 1/3\" space bewteen the back of the screen and the threaded hole. The standard screws that come with the wall mounts WILL NOT be long enough. I walked through Costco today and found that Samsung un55D8000 series is the only TV maker with the sunken holes. DO NOT just go to a hardware store and get longer screws without knowing what you are doing or understanding the consequences. Getting a screw too long (even by a 1/4\") could drive the threads through the front glass!! The Vendor suggested this to me and as an engineer I know I could do it without issue, but I don't want that liability... I just spent a lot of money on the TV!The touch-screen remote took me a while to figure out. The mouse \"pointer\" is the \"enter\" key one side of the remote and sits between the four directional arrow keys.

As someone with good eyesight and an eye for detail - this is not something that bothers me. I did notice it right away (well, as soon as my Wii booted up with that even white screen), but honestly it only really becomes apparent in very specific screen configurations.  It's an issue to be sure, but not a dealbreaker for me.What's far more apparent and noteworthy with this set is the multiple positives: the near zero bezel is very attractive, the extremely deep blacks, excellent contrast and smooth video makes the image look almost flawless.The remote control is large and feels sturdy. The qwerty keyboard is a nice touch but in the end this remote is as useless as every other pack-in remote since it won't control any other hardware other than the TV.The menu software for this TV is fairly responsive and easy to understand, but one thing I -really- don't like is that you cannot access the source selection menu from the regular menu screen - this seems like a huge oversight as it makes selecting from the different sources impossible using the DirecTV universal remote, and presumably others as well.The \"apps\" with the TV show potential - streaming netflix, hulu, etc directly to the TV over wifi is the kind of thing that could make one consider dropping their cable service altogether, but right now there is one major missing service - amazon video! ;-)3D: well, I don't know how I feel about 3D in home in general. It's interesting.  The effect, when properly tuned, is subtle and not mind blowing.  I don't know if you can effectively do 3D with a screen that doesn't completely fill your field of vision. I definitely don't think it's worth spending $100 for a pair of glasses - but fortunately this TV already comes with two. I could see some potential with gaming, but after watching Tron Legacy in 3D, I can safely say I'm not impressed.Gaming: This is where this TV really shines in my opinion. I don't even bother with 'game mode', which shunts the video past any internal processing for a quicker response time, but honestly, it doesn't feel necessary. Even in 'normal' mode, there is no discernible lag.  This is the kind of thing that may be more noticible in a very twitchy online game like MW3, but for the types of games I play (in particular, Dark Souls), I don't notice any delay at all.  If you do notice lag, you can always turn on game mode, but as I said I don't need it. BTW Dark Souls on the PS3 on this TV is a sight to behold.Overall this is an awesome TV with a couple of flaws. If you can afford a TV in this price range, this one is definitely worth considering.", "Date": "December 6, 2011"}, {"Title": "Fantastic TV!", "Author": "Matt", "ReviewID": "R3O1WAY0CTAA86", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This TV is simply amazing!  Coming from a Samsung LN52B LCD, I didn't know what to expect in terms of an upgrade in picture quality.  Sure you see how it looks in stores, but until you get it home and calibrate the unit to meet your needs you don't fully realize what this TV is capable of producing.  DEFINITELY CALIBRATE THE TV!  Out of the box, I'd give the TV's image quality a 7 out of 10.  You really need to play around with all the standard and advanced picture settings to calibrate the TV to your environment.As far as aesthetics go, my wife and I both love the design of the TV.  We have it mounted into our fireplace mantle and with the ultra slim bezel the picture quite literally looks like it's popping out of the fireplace.The 3D experience has also been fantastic!  You don't really notice much loss in terms of color tone and saturation.  I think my wife and I watched 6 hours of 3D movies the first day and didn't have any headache or eye strain issues.  They definitely made a solid 3D product.I know people have complained about vertical banding issues, but I haven't noticed them.  Maybe it's with the calibration settings I ended up using?  I have noticed some uneven lighting towards the top and bottom of the screen when loading certain backgrounds, but it has in no way affected viewing performance when watching TV or playing PS3 games so it hasn't bothered me at all.The only gripe that I have with the unit is the stupid remote.  It's clunky and not very responsive; sometimes I'll have to push a button 3 or 4 times before the TV responds to the command.  This happens mostly while trying to do things inside the Smart Hub, but I've also noticed lag from time to time during normal TV viewing.The purchase through Amazon was spot on as well.  The TV came a week after we ordered it, the man who delivered the TV took it out of the box and powered it up to ensure it wasn't damaged during delivery.  No problems there.Overall I'd give the whole experience a 9.5 out of 10.

The first encounter with CEVA was a nightmare; they came at the wrong time, and tried to rush my wife into signing, so that they could leave. Luckily I got home in time, and made them test out the TV out. I felt very rushed the whole time. Ultimately I did not see any physical damage, so I decided to go ahead and sign. The two guys obviously wanted to leave ASAP; also they decided it was a good idea to wear their dirty shoes into my hardwood floor and carpet. Within an hour of watching the television, I realized there were uniformity light issues at each of the four corners of the TV. The right bottom corner was very noticeable. I decided I had enough; this was too much to deal with for such an expensive TV! I called Amazon to set up an exchange.SECOND EXPERIENCE: Amazon quickly set up an exchange for me to have CEVA deliver the new TV as well as pick up the defective one (12/5/2011). This time around I confirmed with CEVA that the two \"clowns\" would not be sent to my house again. On the day of delivery I called CEVA to confirm that they were supposed to deliver the new TV and pick up the old one, the CEVA Rep. had no idea they were supposed to pick up a TV. Again I called Amazon and they set things straight with CEVA. When the new delivery guys came out, they were nice and welling to set everything up, so that I could carefully test the TV out. The new UN55D8000 set was in perfect condition with almost no uniformity issues. At the moment I am very happy with this purchase.So in conclusion:1. CEVA shipping isn't the best out there, to be in the safe side make sure to call them on the day of the delivery to confirm everything. Also remember that \"White Glove\" shipping means that they are suppose to take the TV out of the box, set it up, have you test the TV, and then throw way the box for you. However I suggest that you keep the box, just in case you decide to return it.2. The Samsung UN55D8000 is an excellent TV when you get a working set. Have realistic expectations, all LED will have some light bleeding, but it should not be super obvious.3. If you are still within your 30 days, don't even bother with Samsung support. Just call Amazon and have them keep sending you a replacement until you are 100% happy.4.

Well worth the wait!  The thin border, great high-contrast picture, and configuration options are very impressive.The 3D features are very cool - not a must have for me - but still pretty neat, especially converting live TV (like football games) to 3D on the fly; it works best with full HD content in 1080i.  The fact that synching the 3D glasses is done via Bluetooth starting with the 'D' model is a big improvement.  The full keyboard on the back of the remote (via Bluetooth) is also a great feature of this TV and definitely a must for the built-in web browser.There are a large number of applications available through the 'Smart Hub' including YouTube, Google Maps, Google Calendar, Skype, Twitter, a full web browser, etc, etc, etc.  Way cool.While I did notice some LED light spots and banding out-of-the-box, after playing with the configuration this can be minimized (backlight levels, black levels, etc, can all be controlled).  I'm quite happy with the picture and smooth motion - there are MANY menus of configuration options to get the picture just the way you want it.Sound quality was okay, but I turned it off in favor of my receiver and surround system which I'd imagine is what most people buying a TV like this will do.I was especially pleased that it seamlessly connected to my 5-GHz wireless 'N' network as most devices seem to only support 'N' over 2.4-GHz.  The wireless setup and configuration was very straight forward.  For me, the coolest part was being able to easily browse multimedia files on my computer via the TV All-Share menu and play all of my music, view photo albums, and watch home movies steamed real-time from my computer.I did not give this 5 stars because of the fairly high price and the fact that an error on the main board within the first few weeks caused Bluetooth (and thus all 3D and qwerty remote functions) to stop working until replaced (free of charge).

Contrast was set way too high (100%) right out of the box so we adjusted it down to about 60-65% and is a very bright picture. With 4 HDMI connectors we're in good shape.

It's not uncommon to find them shooting out of focus, while in a regular TV I wouldn't even notice that at all.I haven't experience any issues that other people have mentioned. I'm simply using the Standard picture type and I haven't played with the settings enough to tune my TV up to my lightning conditions, but when I do, I will update.Aesthetically, I don't think there's a TV that comes close to this one.

As a matter of fact, I bought an XBOX because I thought I would need it to stream the movies out of my Synology NAS, however, the TV can play anything (kinda like VLC) and the XBOX sometimes screams that it needs codecs or the format is not compatible.As far as gaming goes, I cannot compare with a plasma TV because I never played games on one, but I understand plasma TVs are the gaming TV due to the refresh rate, however, I don't think the Samsung has anything to envy to a 600MHZ. plasma TV. Gaming is amazing and if you have doubts about how this TV will perform with a console, don't even hesitate!No issues are observed as far as ghosting or any other issues like that.Conclusion: Would I buy this TV again? DEFINITELY!UPDATE: 05/31/20126 months of ownership, TV is flawless. I discovered one issue with the current firmware. If I have the option enabled to have other devices controlling the TV such as my iPhone, then for some odd reason the TV won't save my wireless configuration and I will have to configure it every time I turn on the TV. I had to call Samsung support to realize what the error was and they were aware of the issue. A little annoyance but it's not a big deal since I'm setting up my 5.1 environment and I will buy a Logitech Harmony remote to control everything so I won't be using my phone.Other than that, no dead pixels, no flash lightning or anything like that. This TV is rock solid, I hope it can stay that way for at least 5-6 years! :)I would recommend this TV to any one any day. I know the updated versions are great but this TV should be heavy discounted now.Update: 06/10/2013a whole year later and the TV is going strong. A couple of scary moments: A couple of times it happened to me that I turned on the TV and the screen would flash all over and turning off and on the TV wouldn't solve the issue. Unplugging it from the wall wouldn't help. The way I got it fixed is to reset the TV to factory settings which removes all the tweaking I did with the image. But I have written down so it's not a big deal. This issue happened twice and I was very concerned, thankfully it seems like some glitch that can be fixed.Other than that, I haven't noticed any ghosting, flash-lightning (permanent that is) nor dead pixels.", "Date": "December 20, 2011"}, {"Title": "Life-like picture", "Author": "sure2rain", "ReviewID": "R1RZK26P6667FK", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I have had the TV for about three weeks.

I wasn't that interested in the 3D--would have purchased a TV without it if it had come with all the other features--but it's actually a lot cooler than I expected.  The picture is fantastic and I haven't noticed any of the problems others have described.  The set up is super easy, to include connecting to my wireless internet.  I will advise that I have broadband but it's pretty slow (no option to get higher speed) and that does interfere with downloading movies on Netflix.  It works but is slow and the quality is pretty poor, esp compared to HD TV and DVD/Blu-Rays.  I haven't tried many of the other internet functions yet.

To me, it seems like Samsung is delivering faulty batches of TV's to some dealers.  I bought mine at Fry's.  Since I use Amazon Prime alot, I'll my review here.  The 1st TV was brand-new out of the box.  It immediately had a bright white patch in the lower left corner that would come-and-go every couple of minutes and then it would black out until it was re-started.  I took it back to the store for a refund.  Luckily, the TV went straight to black-out-mode at the store, so I didn't have to argue with a sales guy over the picture quality.  They were out of stock and offered me a floor model at a small discount.  It was in very good shape, so I took it.  Since the new one didn't work, I figured a floor model that was already broke-in and working OK would be better than another boxed one that did not work.  The floor model worked OK for about 1 month, then the problems started.  About 10 inches of the entire right side got really bright and would show a ghost rendering of the picture from about 20 seconds past.  Then I updated software and it worked OK for about another month.  Then it did it again for a couple of days then it went away for another few weeks. Now its doing it again for the last couple of days an won't stop after updated software, restarting, resetting, etc.I'm contacting Samsung now.  If you get a bad UN55D8000 from a vendor, I recommend getting a refund because if the same vendor sends you another, you are likely going to get it from the same bad batch. My Samsung washing machine broke today too.Hope my Samsung monitor and Samsung smartphone don't go out or I won't even be able to say anything about it. Gotta continue shopping for a Whirlpool (there not much better, but I have experience working on them).  I'll try to post a summary on how Samsung resolves the issue. Hopefully it does not involve me paddling a row boat to Korea.Update: After about 2 visits from the repairman, the TV is working good now.  Overall, Samsung was easy to work with on the warranty repair. The repairman 1st replaced a computer card in the TV, then he replaced the glass/screen.  It's mostly a different TV now.  After pulling the case apart twice, I can seen the seam is a bit larger and uneven.  I pointed it out to the repairman and he just kinda shrugged.  The TV works well now and you can only see it if you get real close and know what you are looking for.  Thing is, I paid for a new TV, not a used and reconditioned one.2 months later, the TV its self looks good - the reason I bought it.  The picture looks very good when there is an image, but the led edge-lit back-lighting has very noticeable streaking when displaying a solid light gray background (Netflix for example).  The internal web browser is slow and won't load most pages. After using them awhile,  the menu system for the Samsung apps becomes irritating. They force you scroll over the ads and paid content they are pushing very hard.  I just use my Roku now.I enjoy watching the TV. Sound is pretty good for inside the TV.  I saw the repair man open it up, and I'm still not sure where the speakers are.  Just wish Samsung would offer this TV without the wifi, Samsung apps, and all the extra fluff that I had to pay for to get the monitor I really wanted.

After spending $3,000 for what I expected to be the best of the best that would be reliable for at the VERY LEAST 5 years, the panel goes out.  So now I have to spend another $1000 for a new panel which I can't afford, after researching I found that many many customers have had the same issue.  What Im wondering is, why would Samsung put only a one year warranty on a premium tv?  When a/c systems back up their condenser units for 5 years, washer/dryers put 10 year guarantees on their motors, why does the basic LED television only come with a one year warranty?  then if I buy the new panel which Samsung's poor customer service department is pushing me to do, on top of that they only put a 1 month warranty on the new panel and there is no way to get a warranty beyond that.  Like the motor in a washing machine or the condenser in an a/c unit, replacing the panel of an LED tv is basically like replacing the whole tv itself, there is not much left but the casing, speakers power system and the motherboard.  I really feel like I am a victim of consumer fraud where a corporation is putting a premium on faulty/defective products, from what I've researched Sony customers have similar issues.  So its a racket, propelled by poor outsourced chinese workmanship and the heads of the companies refuse to acknowledge that there is any issue at all.  I am very frustrated and don't know what to do, it's either buy a new tv or don't watch tv any more, I am so tired of greedy bastards trying to milk the bottom line at the customers expense.  I don't know what to recommend to you potential customer, because I know in terms of picture quality Sony and Samsung are the best, I just didn't expect this kind of apathy from such a large and 'trusted' company, I just had the need to vent my frustration at my experience and you the customer can decide to do with my opinion.", "Date": "November 23, 2012"}, {"Title": "LED vs. Plasma:  My Own Test!", "Author": "Patrick Picklesimer", "ReviewID": "R3N1I4GT81CNJN", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "So I purchased this television on Saturday, March 24, 2012.  I did a TON of research before my purchase, weighing the Pros/Cons of Plasma vs. LCD vs. LED, price, picture quality, number of HDMI ports, 3D, internet capability, 720p vs. 1080p, etc.  - Basically looking at a lot of options.  I have been with Samsung as a consumer for a long time (since the late 1980's) - and I am still convinced that they have the best technology on the market.So my choices came down to these:1) Buy a Samsung Plasma2) Buy a Samsung LEDRight now, for the money, a Samsung e-Series Plasma is a GREAT television.  - but it is not the LED.  Not by a long-shot.  You can get a good Samsung Plasma 50\" for $700-800.  The comparable 55\" LED, depending on the model you go with (D-Series or E-Series) can run $1700-3,000.As a final \"test\", I went to the store with a few Blu-Ray movies in-hand.  I got the salesperson to set up the Blu-Ray player on the UN55D8000 - and went through a series of comparisons with the LED and the Plasma (Model PN51D530).  It was strange, because I thought this was something an average consumer would do, but the Salesperson said, \"Actually, I've been here for 7 years - and you are the first person that has asked me to go through this.\"  - Which kind of amazed me!?  After the visual checks, the LED blew the Plasma away.  I sat in front of each television and watched a number of scenes.  Additionally, I watched the Matrix and a few other Pixar/Disney movies, as my kids will be watching this TV with me.As a quick recap, the overall things that pushed me into the LED:1) Picture Quality:  At the end of the day, in my opinion, this should drive your purchase decision.  I happened to be watching AVATAR on Blu-Ray - and the picture quality for that movie was simply flawless.  The edges were sharp, the movement scenes were incredible, and the colors in the forests were vibrant and just amazing.  You get vertigo at some points, as it feels so real, that I felt like I was being pulled into the environment.  Just breath-taking.2) Cool Looking:  When you get this television set up, one of the first things you will notice is just how aesthetically pleasing it is to your eyes.  The bezel is virtually non-existent, it is very thin, compact and a lot of ergonomic thought went into its design.By the way, the plasma pictured looked pretty good.  - but even the salesperson said it the best, \"This isn't even a contest, is it?\"  Now, granted, the LED TV, with taxes and my warranty ended up totaling $2100. - Which is probably more than I should have spent on a new TV.  HOWEVER, I am planning on using this television for 7-8 years.  My last Samsung DLP has lasted me 11 years, having purchased it in 2001 - and it is STILL doing GREAT.  (I put it in the kids' room, for them to use with their Xbox.)I hope this review helps some of you that may be struggling with your purchase decision.", "Date": "March 26, 2012"}, {"Title": "Best LED 3D Display / TV on the Market!", "Author": "Simona O'Hare", "ReviewID": "RV35WQ6354CCV", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "We just purchased the UN46D8000,  Samsung's latest 240hz, 3D, LED TV.  I've waited years to buy just the right LED display.  Almost pulled the trigger last year when the C series came out, but I'm glad I waited.  This display is by far the best LED TV out there.  Thin, bright, amazing color, incredible contrast, spectacular blacks (true, deep blacks)!  And I'm very picky and waited years to buy the best.  I believe that Samsung continues to be the leader in LED TVs.  Interface and set up was very easy.  It's also not too heavy.  Fantastic build quality.  Sleek and modern looking.  SMALLEST outside edge bezel of any display out there.  Simply the perfect LED TV.In addition, I had a question for Samsung over the weekend.  I went online, got the 800 number and called.  No wait!  The support person answered my question right away.  Incredible service.You will likely get the best price from ABT Electronics.  A rep at Samsung's display store on Columbus circle in NYC recommended them to me and they were fantastic.  Best price (they will negotiate over the phone), free shipping and no sales tax.  Unit came with the free 3D starter kit.  LED display is well packed and I had no problems connecting it to my new Denon surround sound system and Samsung BD-D6700 Blue-Ray 3D DVD player (also got a great deal on these from ABT).I recommend getting a Samsung Blue-Ray with this TV.  Best to match the brands = fewer compatibility problems.Don't hesitate one second if you are considering another LED TV.  I spent the last year watching and researching these displays and the D8000 is by far the best.BTW, normal channels through your cable provider don't render well on this or any other HD LED TV.  You MUST switch out your cable box to an HD model.  Time Warner's HD channels start on 700.  All the HD channels are amazing on this TV.  Just don't get worried when you switch to a regular channel and it doesn't look good.  It's not the LED display.For an amazing high end system, I recommend this LED display along with the BD-D6700 blue-ray and the Denon AVR-4311CI surround sound receiver with built in amplifiers.  It's all you need in addition to a great set of speakers (remember the speakers are most important so don't go cheap on the speakers).  I got rid of my B&K; separate preamp and amplifiers (which were much more expensive) and this system sounds much better and is easier to use!And don't forget to buy quality HDMI  cables.

Amazon used a carrier I haven't heard of before, so I was cautious of that. But it turns out that, Pilot, was a good carrier. The delivery time was about an hour before what I had asked for, the driver was more than careful enough in unloading and handling of the TV, and I had seen how the TV was strapped in the truck. All that was great and when he set it down in my house I looked over the box and popped it open to glance inside, no damage what so ever. So props to Amazon on picking a great delivery company and props to Pilot for their methods.Now About the TV. First off, pulling it out of the box and the first visual of it was amazing. The TV is slim, sleek, and sexy. The thin border frame just makes it look bigger than it really is. Putting the stand together and attaching it was easy, my next purchase will be a wall mount for it. Then looking inside the box for the remote and cables I seen another small black box. For all the reviewers that said they had to send in for the 3D glasses must have missed the deal, because they were included in the box with the TV. The QWERTY remote is simply amazing as well.I plugged it in and turned it on, as well as synced the remote to it. On initial turn on it asked for the setup of for english and couple other things like wireless router or hard wired. Got all that done, updated with the newest version of software, and restarted. All in about 5 minutes. After that, I started watching TV and playing with the remote. The picture is amazing, the remote is easy to use, and getting the internet was easy. Hooked it up to my Xbox 360, and again, no let down. Crystal clear picture.I've only had the TV for about 6 hours now, but have not had any disappointments yet. So far this is an amazing TV and I'm glad I upgraded to it.I will update this in about a week or two, and if there are any problems with this TV I will add it here for your viewing, as well as any solutions.**UPDATE** 21 Dec 2011**I've now had this TV for just over a week(roughly 10 to 12 hours of play time a day) and still no disappointment. The picture has seem to only get better and more clear. It was like the LED lights needed to warm up and the picture quality got better. I have not only watched simple TV, sports, movies, 3D movies, and played games like racing, shooter, and sports games. For those people who have talked about motion blur and fuzzy picures, must either have a bad product or have the settings setup wrong. For my picture settings I have it set to natural with the back light set to 15 out of 20. My living room is a little darker than most so I don't like a bright TV. With that being said, I have no motion blur what so ever. I've played Battlefield 3 multiplayer and Dirt 3, both with a lot of action and movement, and not one blur. I've also watched a couple 3D movies and they look fantastic on this TV.I've had no issues so far and have not had to contact Samsung for anything. If I do I will post on here what the problem was and their solution.

I had been searching for a big 3D TV for about 9 months.  The family and I went to the yellow big box retailer to see all the pictures.  Initially thought I was going to buy a Sony but the wife convinced me that the Samsung products had the best picture.  We almost bought the 7000 series there but I decided to come home and look at Amazon.  So glad I did - for noticeably less than the price of the 7000 series at the big box store, I got the top of the line model (this model) with free delivery from Amazon.  I was worried about the delivery service but scheduling was easy and the product came well packaged and on time.  The picture is tremendous and I think the 3d picture is even better than the 2d version (even on the non-3d sources).  The thin bezel around the screen makes the TV even more aesthetically pleasing.  If you are looking for a big screen 3d TV, let me give you two recommendations: (1) get this TV and (2) be sure to buy it at Amazon.

My family and I could not be happier.  TV arrived undamaged and the packaging for shipping was awesome.  Do not take the free delivery though or you will be sorry - not worth saving a few bucks.  The free shipping Amazon uses for this item is a service called Home Direct USA.  Should have known there would be a problem as soon as I tried to track my package and had a problem with their web links from the e-mail that they sent.  I was told by Amazon that I would have my TV by December 7th and that I would be contacted by Home Direct USA to schedule an appointment.  On December 5th the Home Direct USA web site (found a way in that did not use their web links) said that the TV was at their sorting facility approximately 23 miles from my house.  I received no phone call and I called them late on December 7th to find out what was going on.  A very rude customer service person told me that I was impatient and that they would have called me if I had just waited.  She then told me that December 7th is the date that they setup the delivery appointment and that they needed to schedule my delivery - the earliest that they had was for December 10th at 7:00am to 11:00am.  I told her that Amazon stated that I would have my delivery on December 7th and she was again very rude and told me that she doesn't have to follow anyone's time line except for Home Direct USA.  I took the appointment after being told that there was no supervisor to speak with.  On December 9th I again checked the web site to find a note in their system that I had called and requested a later delivery date and that they had accommodated me and moved my date to December 10th.

Wow, what a perfect choice. The size and the picture were mind blowing. Not having a bezel (.9\" is literally no bezel), makes the TV look like as if you are watching in a movie theatre and with such exceptional picture quality just breath taking. Also referring to few ppl who reviewed it as, watching through a window :) I have had this TV for a week and i have not noticed the screen uniformity issues (white lines end of the screen) or clouding.2) SMART HUB, great choice of apps. You can do everything from watching videos(Youtube,Netflix/Blockbuster/Vudu/Hulu) to chatting with friends(gtalk)/status updates on Twitter n facebook/checking your email (web browser). I feel the Web browser on TVs is just a good to have thing, not a necessity. As its definitely more convenient to browse through internet on the computer or ipad. The 3D app is amazing. Samsung has great choice of 3D videos right on the TV.3) Connectivity to Internet and syncing your bluetooth remote was a piece of cake (unlike others who had problem with it).4) It detected my PC, NAS and Music from IPad/Iphone easily. Now i can play music and videos from the listed devices on the TV just like that. This has always been fun (with other TVs i had as well).5) The Qwerty remote is great fun to work with, as typing makes it easier and you have the small display screen that shows what you are typing (especially for passwords). I like this small remote though little bulky than the usual ones. I still love the Un46C8000 remote (classy look).Cons:1) Missing Amazon Video. Earlier on UN46C8000, it was there on the Yahoo widgets list. Now its completely missing. Many of us (including me) being a great fan of Amazon videos miss this.2) The uniformity issues (the white lines) not a major concern. As i have seen them for a sec or two while starting an internet video, like the Netflix.I had to mention this some where so listed it in the Cons.3) Sometimes you have to keep pressing the bluetooth remote for it to operate. Again it has been only few times. I still think the IR Remotes are better. I have the BDD6700 blu ray player, comes with a IR remote..and i can easily distinguish between the ease of use.4) Sometimes operating the apps on SMART hub is slow.So Overall for me missing amazon video is a minus, but still the amazing picture quality makes up to it. I wish Amazon let us give 4.5 stars.Definitely i would recommend this to everyone who is looking for a top of the line TVs.Will update again in few weeks, with any further findings.-DJei", "Date": "December 11, 2011"}, {"Title": "Best TV ever", "Author": "akw825", "ReviewID": "R166SCGVEBWEJU", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I ordered this TV on Sunday and received it Thursday (today is Saturday so I've had a few days to play with it).  I first gained interest in this TV when I saw it at Best Buy.  I immediately came home and saw some mixed reviews.  Though most of the reviews were positive, I read many reviews about the color being off (screen uniformity).  I'm not sure if those people just got a bad TV or if there was a legitimate problem, but if there were problems, Samsung has apparently fixed them.This TV replaced another Samsung I bought a couple years ago...a 46\" LCD.  The picture is obviously better than the old TV, but the sound seems better too.  I've got a Sony surround sound system which seems to sound better with this TV...I'm not sure if it's in my head or not, but it seems I don't have to turn up the volume as loud on my surround sound system anymore.  I also think it's great that my Samsung remote can control my Sony sound system.  My old TV couldn't do that.  I also downloaded a free iPhone app so I can use my phone as a remote control too.  The smart TV features are great.  I didn't see myself using them at all, but I do use them.  I don't use the 3D glasses at all...I tried them with Arkham City on PS3 just to try them.  I've never been a fan of 3D, especially the glasses, so this isn't a problem specific to this TV.Blu rays, DVDs, TV, PS3, and Netflix all look great on this TV.  Just like everyone else has said, the TV itself also looks amazing.  I'm not sure if I'd pay the sticker price of $3,700 for this TV, or any TV for that matter...but I was able to find it for $2,000 with free shipping.  I was a little concerned about paying that much for a TV, but I'm extremely satisfied with my purchase thus far.  I think the only way I'd become dissatisfied with this purchase is if one of the following happens: 1)the price drops to $1,000 in the next several months 2)much better television technology makes this set obsolete in the next several months or 3)the TV craps out on me right after the warranty expires.I highly recommend this television to anyone who has a couple thousand dollars to burn on a TV.  When I was at Best Buy and comparing the picture quality of this TV to all the other ones, this one really was the best.  Just be careful where you put it because the screen does have a bit of reflection in it when the screen goes dark.  All in all, I am extremely satisfied with my purchase and I don't have any regrets/complaints about the TV.

A quick background though to explain my perspective.  I have owned only 1 other TV in my life as an adult and it has been a 27\" Sony CRT - which I bought in 1997.  My wife and I have been content with that TV for our 8 years together, and I content with the TV for the years prior to that(97-03).  We had become a little bit of sci fi movie fans and we happened to see AVATAR playing on this particular TV in Best Buy over the last year (and the previous year model last December).  We were both hooked on the clarity of the screen (some folks call it the soap opera affect).So - that being all said - I have followed the price of this series of TVs for the last 11 months with the intention of purchasing around this time of year - saw Amazon had a pretty good deal - so we took advantage of it.  Now - after spending some time researching and reading reviews on and off the last 11 months I was concerned about a few things - mainly people's bad experiences to keep an eye out for a few things.We received our TV yesterday evening - There was no damage in shipping (thank you Amazon for free shipping!)  The delivery company unpacked and set up the TV and stayed until I tested the TV and was satisfied in it's condition upon delivery (I wasn't expecting that).The TV itself - comparing it with the only TV I've owned - (because I've noticed that's what most people do, however most reviews are from people who have had multiple TVs (flat panel and otherwise) - this Samsung is absolutly breath taking.  Out of the box we watched \"How to Train your Dragon\" on Blue-Ray.  I have to say -with our pre existing home stereo - this was the first time actually (for lack of better words) experienced that movie.  We watched it with no ambient lights on - there was no LED pixels bleeding anywhere - no cloudy images (to my untrained eyes).  Due to my complete lack of experience with other higher end TVs - this is hands down a 5 star after day 1.  I'll leave more feedback if that changes.  I certainly hope I don't have to use Samsung customer support based on all the negative experince people have had with them.  I also purchased the SquareTrade warranty - so, that should at least cover my purchase price.

Ok, so I get the TV delivered, and what do I find? 2 pairs of 3d glasses were included, and when I went to set the all the calibration stuff, they were already as close as you can get to perfect (compaired to the settings I found online. Yea!). I guess Samsung has been paying attention to their customers, and took care of the glasses and calibration complaints before sending these TVs out. I was happy, to say the least!!!  Reviews mentioned other problems as well, but so far, I don't see any of the halos, blue corners, or white dot I keep hearing about, and I don't know if those problems are that wide-spread as they were before.

If you make a mistake (easy to do) you tend to be thrown back to the start of whatever process you started, instead of to the last thing you did.I could find no documentation about the logic it uses to build lists of movies etc on other devices - and this, while supposed to make it easier for the user, actually seems to have such rigid logic that if you don't do it the way Samsung imagined you should, it doesn't do it properly.The only way I 'encouraged' it to find 3D photos, was to copy them on to a portable DVD drive, and plug it directly into the TV.  It displayed them brilliantly , although I have not yet worked out how to remove the sideshow banner on the bottom of the picture.It did not recognize the movies which were also in 3D, as 3D movies and played them in 2D.An enormous improvement to this interface would be to provide a regular computer interface in software, allowing you to control all of these functions from a monitor and a keyboard.Finally, Samsung is not alone in this problem.  Access to the inputs at the back of the set is not easy once you have got the set into place.  Many people do not put these large sets on pedestal stands where you can easily get behind them.  An enormous functional improvement would be to provide a control box attached to the TV either by a single cable, or a remote interface into which you could easily plug the array of components you may want, including portable drives, computers, video servers, external amplifiers, skype cameras, and hdmi sources.", "Date": "September 18, 2011"}, {"Title": "Simply the best!", "Author": "D. Faust \"Dave\"", "ReviewID": "RD2XT7HF93L14", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I have been looking at getting a new TV for some time now, but I made sure I did my homework before purchasing. At first I was split between getting an LED TV or a Plasma. I visited my local Best Buy store and looked at the models on display. Both the plasma and the LED offer a beautiful picture, but I ultimately chose the LED. The reason for choosing the LED over the plasma came down to possible burn-in issues and image scrubbing with the plasma. I didn't want either on my mind and I knew the LED was a fantastic TV.Having purchased a TV from Amazon in the past, I felt totally comfortable ordering from them again. The TV was provided by Paul's TVs, which I have never ordered anything from in the past, but after seeing all of the positive reviews, I felt reassured. The main reason for purchasing this TV through Amazon vs a big box retailer came down to the price. Local retailers were charging $400-$600 MORE for this exact same TV, and Amazon had free shipping.The TV was scheduled for delivery between 10am and 1pm, and it was delivered exactly at 12pm. The men from the shipping company were kind and professional. They made sure I was happy with the unit before signing the delivery forms. They made sure to unpack the TV for me and to make physical inspection of the unit too. They also offered to set up the device for me, but I declined as I am completely proficient at handling that myself.Now on to the TV...After connecting my TiVo and getting everything plugged in, I turned on the TV. It automatically took me through the setup process. It found my wireless and I was able to connect very easily. Updates (I think there were 14) were downloaded to the TV within 2-3 minutes. Once the setup was complete I changed the input source to my TiVo and I was just stunned by the image quality. The color was perfect and the clarity was unbelievable. I also have a 55\" Sony Bravia that was only 1 model year old, and the image quality of this Samsung completely outclasses the Sony. Samsung's Clear Motion 960 is evident because there is just no blurring when people move or through regular action scenes. The image is always super crisp and the colors are vivid and bright. I was watching a 1999 episode of Law and Order, and I tell you, it never looked as good. It looked as though it was made for 1080p broadcast, and we know that back in 1999 it surely wasn't. It was like watching the show on a blu-ray disc. I was just amazed. Everything you watch on this TV seems to be up-converted. All shows, despite their age, look amazing.The Smart Hub feature is my new favorite tool. Having Netflix and other streaming services built right into my TV, rather than using an external device is absolutely the best. Smart Hub also offers so many other nice features like games, informative apps like weather, etc. The built-in web browser is a bit clunky to navigate, but certainly an awesome feature. I was able to visit many of my popular websites and save them to favorites with ease. Using the AllShare feature is also amazing because the TV was able to find movies and music on my computer and I was able to watch and listen to them over my house's WIFI seamlessly. This does require that you install software on your computer, but it was certainly not a hassle. Allshare is available via Samsung's website for PC, but if you use a Mac like I do, just download TV Mobili and it's the same thing and works great.3D: unreal! The TV allows you, with a push of the button on the remote, to convert anything you are watching to 3D. Let me tell you, it is really cool and brings a whole new experience to whatever it is you are watching. The two included 3D glasses charge very easily through the included USB cable using the USB ports right on the TV. The glasses also very easily pair with the TV with a simple press of a button on the glasses. I watched Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring, which was on HBO at the time and I converted it to 3D and it was simply amazing. I am looking forward to watching many of my favorite movies now in 3D. I also have a PS3 connected to the TV via HDMI and 3D movies look better than 3D movies look in the theater. I can't wait to get a few more titles in 3D now.If you have a smartphone, like most people do now, there are apps available that simulate the remote control on your phone so you can use your phone as a remote - how cool is that! I downloaded the app to my iPhone and now I have an extra remote for my TV. I also have the remote app for my TiVo as well.**NOTE**: The remote for the TV needs to be pointed at the TV for it to work it's best. If you point it slightly off-angle it doesn't seem to send the signal to the TV. Just be sure to point it at the TV and you'll be fine. The TiVo remote doesn't need line-of-sight to work, but apparently this one does, just be aware of it.To sum up my review, if you are considering this TV along with a plasma or another brand of TV, don't even hesitate to get this TV. It is simply the best and blows away the quality (or lack there of) of other brands. I compared this TV with Panasonic's, Sony's, Sharps, etc. and these others just can't compare. This TV is slim, sleek and has tons of features. Quality was clearly the highest priority here and Samsung came through with flying colors.

There's tons of tech data available online so I'll skip reiterating all of that. I'm quite discerning in the items I purchase and this set has the following highlights:- image is both crisp & vibrant with no flashlighting- impressive sound (for built in speakers)- form is impressively thin (Not the thinnest on the market but noteworthy)- from the back, the inputs are located on the left side, set in and feed to the bottom and left edges- the thin bezel puts the focus on what you're watching- user interface is very nice - an advance just as important as the thinness of these televisions- unique two sided remote makes the interactive functions much more enjoyable- one of the best looking sets availableThe one thing I could not seem to get any info on was the component / composite connections. I have a few old AV components that would require the analog connections. So, for anyone else in similar circumstances, the set comes with a mini-jack connector (two prong 1/8\") that allows for one component and one composite connection. This will work fine until I am able to update these older components.Also, the manual does not provide the full details in pairing the remote.

All other TVs I have ever experienced have a jack that automatically switches to the headphones when you insert the plug.

Best 3D I have seen so far on any HDTV. The motion plus is great once you get the right mix of settings. The one thing that really makes this model stand out though is the design. The clear frame, thinness, and chrome stand will make any one that walks into your living room just say wow. The design also helps you become more immersed in the picture since the frame is only 0.2 inches. The TV has an all screen look. Even though its not the best LED picture ever, it still really good. The built sound is great too. Alot better than previous models. If you are looking for amazing style, design, 3D, LED, and an amazing picture, I would recommend this model. Once again, I do know its not the best of the best picture wise, but still very impressive. The overall design makes up for it in my opinion.The only feature that didn't blow me away completely was the smart tv software.

The picture quality was great but as CNET & HDTV reviewers mention, at times, there is ghosting effect (Best I can describe is if someone threw a bucket of water over fresh & wet oil painting). Ofcourse, at this price point, I could buy 3 or more LCD TV's with much better picture quality. But I wanted the latest LED, smart TV with 3D.. I had to have it. None of which I touched after the first week of purchase. I now use the amazing Roku which I purchased from Amazon to provide almost most things that Smart TV provides like NetFlix, Hulu, etc. One could argue that smart TV provides internet, email, stock tickers but I rather do all that either via my laptop / IPAD or PS3. And who the hack likes to sync the glasses 3 inches away from TV every time, you use them. I used the 3D once and done with it.ISSUES: Just last week, I grabbed a beer, sat on my favorite chair, reclined and tried to turn TV on.. It took 10 minutes of clicking on / off sound and all of a sudden the picture was on. I thought I had a bad battery and right away threw away two good batteries with new ones. The next day, the same issue but this time 1 hour later, I took batteries out of controller and TV by itself does the on/off click. I removed the power from Monster power conditioner & placed in wall outlet and same issue. I thought maybe if I just unplug it and let it rest and it would reset itself... and that was wishful thinking. Afterwards, contacted B.B. and was told to call their G.S. division and was told it seemed that I bought extended warranty but then returned it (which of course would be correct) and that it will cost $150 for visit and with parts its around $430. I was told since I bought a lot of things at same time and spent a good chuck of change, I should go to store and talk with manager which I did after the call and saw Jimmy the local GM. He didn't seem happy to talk to me but told me someone will call me back from his service center tomorrow and 5 days later no call. I called Samsung and I got bad news that its 2 month over my 1 year warranty and I am out of luck. A quick search on Samsung TV clicking on and off informed me that there are ton of Samsung (mainly LCD's) with same issue.. Faulty Capacitor and main Power Board. The final lesson learned is that I should have left smart out of smart TV.. I now feel a bit dumb to have bought smart TV. The more electronic option, the greater chance of things breaking down.

The TV has a thin bezel allowing for a larger screen in a smaller footprint as well as a swivel stand, which allows for better viewing options in my living room.Setup was extremely easy and I had successfully connected my Cable/DVR, stereo system and Wii in short order.  Pairing the remote was easy. My one big complaint is that, although Amazon video application is available for 2012 TVs, Samsung has not made it available for 2011 models.  As a result, I still have to use a Netgear adapter to view Amazon streaming video from my PC using a bluetooth WiDi connection.  There are other movie programs in the Smart Hub that work well for movie rentals, but I prefer the Amazon application because of free content available to Amazon Prime customers.The picture is beautiful and the remote is easy to use, though I also have a Logitech Harmony remote so that I don't need multiple remotes for the cable/Bose and TV to simply watch television.I do notice the edge lighting variances on the black screens sometimes and that can be distracting if you focus on it.  The glossy screen is not very good in a room with a lot of windows as you can see the reflection of the room all the time during the day.  This was not a problem with the matte finish screen on my old Sharp Aquos HDTV. It does look terrific in a dark room though.Oddly the most troublesome feature is an extremely bright Samsung LED logo on the bottom front of the TV.  After manually covering it to watch several movies, I finally found the setting to turn it off in the System, General, Light Effects menu.All in all, this is a good TV with nice looks and features.", "Date": "February 16, 2013"}, {"Title": "The quality for the price is unbeatable", "Author": "Mitchell505", "ReviewID": "R343D2X333072Z", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I have had my fair share of experiences with different types of high end TV's and I really don't believe any TV has proven to be better then this exact model...for the price. I have had 2 Samsung Plasma TV's along with a few Sony LED and LCD TV's that were suppose to have great picture but the brightness, the clearness and the depth on this Samsung is not comparable. I will give credit to the Elite models though, I have never owned one but I hear great things. If you're willing to spend $10k then go for the Elite models. I think this TV is under priced for its quality. I would recommend only buying this TV with 240HZ because I have seen the 64HZ and the 120HZ and it will show a little lag when the image on the screen is moving fast (the 120HZ has less lag compared to the 64HZ). I have read other reviews about this TV and I guess the screen sometimes has light coming from the edge of the TV along with some other screen issues but all TV product lines will have some faulty TV's in every batch, I guess I got lucky. Anyways, I have had this TV for over a year and I can't say enough good things about it. If you are looking to spend a couple hundred dollars or more for picture quality than I would strongly recommend you give this TV a try. Also, the smart hub, the 3D ability, and the sleekness of this TV make it even more of a plus. I have never gone out of my way to write an online review before but I felt that customers interested in this product deserve to hear what makes this TV a quality purchase.

I've been using this puppy for about a year now and is still spot on and never fails to impress my friends.Bought it when it first came out, carefully examined packaging and pixels. Maybe my eyes deceive me, but I scanned a few times with some friends and we all couldn't find a dead pixel (which is very unlikely). Set up took minutes.Picture quality, is very difficult to define and clearly some of the reviews here are very subjective. \"Oh it's too dark, it's too bright, too much color\" But in another review, it's interpreted as \"Deep beautiful blacks, crisp sharp illumination, dynamic popping refined colors.\" Having that said, there are some things that are consistently important, and I can say this model hits it all. Faithful reproduction of geometry and colors. I personally like the 240hz, although if you've never seen it it may take some time to adjust to and it's not for everyone. Adjustment options plentiful, and will please most critics, be it subjective as it may. Images are very uniform edge to edge, there's no \"bright or dark\" corners/borders.If you play video games, make sure you turn on \"Game Mode\", it will prevent \"lag\" issues. Breathtaking gaming once you get it set up.3D, the best of all the models, including some of Samsung's own, when I tried some of them at various retailers F??'s and B??? B??s. And I'm really bothered by people who say \"oh it's dark, it's too dark.\" Come on, that's the limit of the technology. You can't point at wheels of a car and say the tires are too round.  Active shutter is \"SHUTTING\" shades to make images in 3D. Why don't we just call it \"rich beautiful deepening of the black\" also? And yes, you can make it bright to compensate, but you'd also have to adjust the contrast, so it's possible to adapt but I'm sure people will complain \"I have to do that everytime for 3D?\" If it bothers you, don't buy it, Active Shutter 3D is not for you, it's not a good \"con.\"Tested all the ports, well placed and bountiful.Bezel is almost a mirage, AWESOME.However, nothing is perfect in life, here are some issues that I think are REAL cons:The Allshare / SmartTV are nice features, but please SPEED UP the apps. They are upsettingly slow.Menu speed overall can be improved as well. Some of the features are hard to get to. Game Mode, to be honest, should be a very important feature and not be so deep in the menu.Internet speed too slow. Hardwired into my router, my 3g phone still run circles around it loading websites etc.The remote controller eats batteries a little TOO fast (had to buy rechargeable batteries)*FIXED* Annoying popup screen for firmware update (Thank you for stopping that)Would be nice to come with more 3d glasses.I think these are more nitpicks, but overall, great investment.", "Date": "September 3, 2012"}, {"Title": "Ridiculous picture and features", "Author": "G.

Tonight I'm on my 20th communication with the Executive Customer Service line at Samsung and it's still not done. I have about 4 hours into this process now that I will never get back. I think this is the worst customer service I have ever been through.Early Feb Ordered from Amazon, arrived w/ broken remote : Emailed them and they couldn't help, referred me to Vendor.Paul's TV (Vendor): They gave me two wrong numbers for Samsung support, third one worked. They didn't help but to pass me off.Finally got a hold of Samsung (two weeks later): Referred me to online chat, spent 67 mins chatting and within that time I had to scan a Bill of Sale, find original box and provide a DNA sample to get them to commit to send a new one.Samsung (week later): Called to tell me that I needed to do an exchange, not a direct replacement, but to do that I needed to be transferred to Executive support. Listened to a phone ring for 17 mins until someone named T-Ana picked up and said that someone had assigned her to answer the phone at this empty desk, and told me she would have to call me right back.Samsung (Two hours later): She started the exchange process to include another DNA sample, and as luck would have it I had everything but the model of the damn remote itself. I told her that it's the remote Samsung included in the TV box for that model. She apologized but indicated that I still needed to provide her that number, so I told her I would call back later from the house so she gave me her direct number.Samsung (This evening): T-Ana's number didn't work and was informed by the young man that I finally got ahold of that she no longer works at Samsung and all the information I provided her earlier this afternoon didn't make it into their systems, consequentialy I would need to provide it all again.

I was nervous after reading some of the reviews but after doing my research Samsung is the leader in LED technology and this model has outperformed all of its competition in the same class: Sharp, Sony, and Panasonic.  When comparing it on Amazon and seeing the prices in the department stores I pulled the trigger on this one. I was pleasantly surprised that the TV came with the 3D glasses after reading other reviews that stated that I needed to send in a mail-in voucher for them. I did not buy this TV for the 3D capability, actually I have not been much of a fan of 3D with the in-store demonstrations, but I have a new found respect for 3D now after having this TV in my home. I watched a basketball game on ESPN 3D and it was unreal, I felt like I was there on the court. The 240 Hz refresh rate makes the movies look almost too good, like I'm watching it in real life, very sharp images not like in the theater; I'm still trying to get used to that. The auto dimming feature is nice and makes watching a movie in a dark or semi-dark room amazing. I have not personally experienced any issues with the TV that I read in the other reviews, so I feel those may have been just isolated issues. I have not used the smart hub that much yet, other than watching Netflix, but it looks pretty extensive. Overall great buy, especially since the department store wanted $4000.00 for it and that was on sale from $5000.00.

I connected to my Wi-Fi with the push of a button (on my router) and I was receiving my product updates before I got back out to the living room.  the 3-D is great, Converting regular TV to 3-D is interesting and fun to do from time to time (watching the super bowl in 3-D was fun), but it does not give the depth that a movie recorded in 3-d does, though thats to be expected.Picture quality:The picture quality is phenominal, the colors come through clear, and I have no \"halo\" effect, with one exception, occasionally in 3-D mode when the picture is really dark I notice a slight \"halo\" effect around the edge of the screen.  The first time I noticed I thought \"Oh Crap, I should have listened to the other reviews!\"  Then I started to realize that it only happened in 3-D mode, then with further testing\\trouble shooting, I noticed that the \"halo\" effect would always happen on the same shows\\commercials\\movies, and on the movies and commercials always at the same places.  So, I then found a non 3-D DVD that would have the halo effect when I put the tv into 3-D mode.  I then watched the same scene 5 times and saw that the effect looked the same and would start and stop at the exact same time each time I watched it.  I then took the TV out of 3-D mode and watched the same scene and no halo effect.  My conclusion... TV is fine, but maybe it has issues sometimes dealing with older recording formats.  I have not fully tested and do not plan to, but it does seem that I can narrow the issue down to older movies, or low quality recorded tv shows.  I have noticed that when I watch a show on \"regular\" channels I sometimes see the halo effect, but if I watch the same show on an HD channel I do not see the effect.  In any case I will continue to make notes of when I notice it, and pay very close attention if it starts happening more frequently.  I will also come here from time to time and post my findings.Smart Hub:I love this feature on my TV, and now that I have it I can't ever see me going with a TV that does not have it.Netflix: Plays videos great with no problem, even HD videos come through clear without any buffering problems.  The interface is not as inclusive as I would like, but that is most likely an issue with Netflix, not Samsung.  Also its very annoying to have the qwerty remote, but still be forced to use the onscreen keyboard for Netflix, but again I believe that would be the Netflix App not being designed to accept the remotes qwerty input again laying the issue with netflix.Web Browser: I love surfing the net on my TV, and once I figured out that the center button on the directional pad was actually a touch mouse pad it made browsing even easier.  The only issue I have had so far is that playing video from some websites does not work well, it either will not play at all, or it freezes up after a few minutes of play.  But that is not much of an issue as most of the videos I watch I can use the You Tube App, or Facebook App to view.You Tube: No issues here, I can search and play videos and having no problems watching what I want.Facebook: The interface is somewhat limited compared to the full web version, but I have found that to be true with just about every Facebook application I have used.  I have used apps on the I-Phone, Android, Blackberry, and X-Box 360 and all of them limit what you can and can't do.  Its still nice to be able to check status updates and whatnot during comercial breaks.App Store: Fun, but I do not use it much, with having n X-Box 360 I don't see much need in it.Hulu:  I have not used this application except to watch some of the free clips, I still have not upgraded my Hulu account, but if I do and it works as good as the free clips do, I may just cancel my  Cable all together.I really haven't messed with most of the other applications on the Smarthub so I cannot comment on them, but of the applications I have used I have no real complaints, and any I do mostly fall on the developer of the application.", "Date": "April 20, 2012"}, {"Title": "Amazing TV!", "Author": "Jose E.

In order for this to occur I had to call the contracted company on multiple occasions and absent of a resolution had a conversation with the manasger. It was surprising to realize that at the moment of my communication with the delivery company they were not sure where the TV was. I researched and identified who was the secondary company in charge of actually delivering the TV and spoke to one of the agents. This agent indicated they were waiting on the TV to arrive at their facility. Again, I contacted the original company in charge of the delivery and they indicated that the secondary company had the TV.

I didn't think I could be 'wowed' by a TV again, but I was wrong. Game mode is a life saver (and necessary) for fast controller response. The picture degradation is minimal. Brightness is handled well and serves a brilliant picture in light and dark. Edge lighting has very minimal bleed through - nothing I notice unless viewing an all white screen.The one thing I have noticed immediately is that the screen does have some trouble rendering slow scenes smoothly. Probably some fine tuning will do but every few seconds or so it does have a little jitter.3D is what it is. Conversion isn't bad, but I won't be using it often other than to show it off.Finally, aesthetically, the unit is beautiful - far beyond anything I could have guessed looking at pictures.

This was the biggest TV for the space in my cabinet without having to do a remodel.  I had 41.5 inches in width. This 46 inch TV measures exactly 41 inches wide so it fits perfectly in my space. This was the ONLY 46inch TV that would fit. The nice thing is that the whole space in my cabinet is picture.  The edge trim on this TV is very next to nothing.As far as picture, I think it is excellent.  I did tone the contrast and brightness down from the factory settings to suit my taste but everyone that sees it loves it.  We didn't really want the 3D feature yet but actually have enjoyed a couple 3D movies.  The pair of glasses that it ships with are nice in my opinion.  Better than the ones on display at the stores.  The price was excellent through Amazon.com.  The price came down to $1,309.76 with free shipping and set up.  After I ordered it, it dropped another $17.00 to $1294.00 and I made a call and they refunded the difference.  It hasn't been that low since.  I bought it before Christmas and it was delivered in just a couple days. It shipped with White Glove set up which my wife had to sign a waiver for to have them leave it in the box.  I wanted to have the honors.  Frys and Best Buy said that Amazon's price was less than their cost and couldn't match locally.The sound of the built in speakers are not great and in my opinion need to be run through an entertainment system.  I cant imagine what size of speakers they squeezed into the thin TV cabinet. It does, however sound great through my Denon AVR1912 system.In summary of my review and one other note:1.  I love the picture size.  The only thing about the picture I don't like is the glass surface that reflects any lights on in the background when you are watching a movie.  During regular TV watching, I don't even notice it.  I guess I get more critical when watching a movie.2.

So, I got a good deal on Cyber Monday on Amazon and pulled the trigger.The design of this TV is just breath taking... It's basically almost all screen. Much nicer than anything else I've seen. Next I plugged in the HDMI cable from my Comcast Cable box and did a few clicks through the set-up (skipping the network set-up) and it was up and running. The picture quality is just amazing... In fact, I watched several episodes of NCIS (from 2003) on USA HD... The quality was far superior to anything I've seen before. It looks like the people are in the room with you.Next, I configured the network set-up... It was really easy and was set-up in minutes. I was able to access the SmartHub and add Apps. The selection of Apps isn't that great, but they have the most popular ones -- Facebook, Netflix, YouTube, Skype, and Pandora.Finally, I sync'd the keybord side of the remote to the TV. It was really easy... I was worried based on some of the reviews I read, but it worked on the first try. So, that's it... I was done with set-up and everything worked perfectly.The only con this TV has is that I do see some of the black ghosting when there is a lot of black on the screen... But this really didn't bother me, since it doesn't happen a lot and there are times where there is no ghosting at all. The majority of the time when there is a real picture on the screen... The picture is just amazing.The real proof here is my wife... She was blown away by this tv and she's doesn't care about any of the electronics in our house...

I felt compelled to write this short one due to the fact that I'm incredibly impressed with this Samsung UN55D8000 LED 3DTV.TVs have come a long way since 06.  My previous one was a Panasonic 37\" Plasma.  It was very good in its day although it weighed 100+ lbs and was extremely bulky.  The bezel was 6\"+ at the bottom and 2\"+ all around.This TV is night and day better in every aspect.  That's what you get with technology as the years progress.  I was torn between a Plasma and a LED.  Plasma's generally have a better refresh rate with games and such but at the expense of power.  This LED uses $17 of electricity per year at 5 hours viewing per day!!  That's amazing to me as my plasma could use that up in 1-2 months.  I'm anticipating my electric bill going down.  I was also torn about the 3D aspect, but I'm glad that I went for it.  With that being said, a few Pros and cons I've listed below.  Take them with a grain of salt.  I'm a tech nerd but I'm definitely not a video or audiophile.Pros:The 3D is better than expected!  Movies have become an immersive viewing experience.  The picture quality and depth really puts you in the story.No ghosting with games or movies.  Huge relief for me because I pretty much bought this TV for anticipation of the new game releases this fall: Battlefield 3 and Gears of War 3 for the 360.Internet capability is awesome.  The most useful to me is the Pandora app.  Youtube needs to be improved since the search functionality is tedious.  For whatever reason, it won't let you use the qwerty keyboard to type.  You can use the arrow keys though and navigate to the letters that way.HD pictures direct from my cable COAX is great.The asthetics of the TV is unmatched from anything I've seen.  It looks like you're peering into a window on your wall.  It also weighs only 35 lbs.  This is amazing considering its a 55\".Free 3d Bluray and Megamind value pack.  This is icing on the cake.  I didn't have to go out and buy the bluray player and media to take advantage of my TVs capabilities out of the box.Control the TV with your PDA.  Android and iOS have a Samsung app that lets you control the TV.  Pretty cool.  Now or in the near future you'll be able to watch whatever picture is displaying on your TV with your Samsung phone.  This feature alone might help swing me to Android from the iPhone.Watch your PC/NAS media collection of movies/pictures/mp3s by using the TV DLNA capability.  Awesome feature.  My GF just came back from a trip and we held a slideshow of her pictures from her laptop for family viewing in front of the big screen.Cons:Sound is good but not great.  Get a soundbar or AVR to compliment this beauty.  If you're spending this kind of money on a TV you shouldn't have an issue justifying the additional purchase.Samsung TV apps.  Most are useless.  I hope they come out with better ones in the near future.", "Date": "August 16, 2011"}, {"Title": "Awesome Picture", "Author": "Paul Marentette", "ReviewID": "R1G0I6VJREIXEH", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This TV has an almost edge-to-edge picture that is bright and unbelievably sharp.

Reports of PQ deficiencies (I believe them but thankfully have not encountered them).6. Samsung brand. The quality is there but the support is spotty at best.7. The remote is a red headed stepchild compared to what was originally leaked pre release. OK, that's a personal gripe but the fact that the remote is unable to be programmed to run additional gear coupled with the need to have it available for keyboard input in \"Smart Hub\", means yet another black brick taking up space on the coffee table. Major PIA.8. Manual is vaporware built into the TV and accessed from the remote. Think about that for a minute. Thousands of dollars later and accepting that this unit is one of the most complex TV's ever manufactured is it too much to ask for to have a hard copy?Recommendation:  I'm old enough and the grandkids rarely get a chance to use my house for a demolition test bed anymore. I can pull together enough coin for a few conceits. That's the league the 8000 is in.Necessary- NO. A pleasure to have- You betcha. The long review:  Sea scallops are still scallops. They are cheaper than bay scallops and they are less tasty than bay scallops but they can be a fine eating experience if done up right and if you haven't done a critical comparison of a bay and sea scallop you probably don't have any issue with sea scallops.A Hyundai will get you where you are going, for the most part. It's a car. It's not a Vette or a Caddie but it is a car and has creature comforts and some ponies under the hood. You can drive one coast to coast and not be contorted from the drive or embarrassed being seen in it.Point is you can get a good experience without spending the grand kid's inheritance.Or not.This little bit of crumpet will give your plastic a workout. It may hail from the same peninsula as Hyundai but that's where the similarities taper off.The 8000 is way more TV than I needed or wanted when I started looking in March but I have no regrets.I auditioned a bunch of 50+ inch flat screens and the laments about edge bleed and spotlighting notwithstanding, this TV is a marvel of both PQ and tech.To continue the car analogy, some cars look like they are breaking the law sitting still. That's the kind of TV the 8000 series is. Shut off it appears to be breaking some laws of physical properties.It's so thin that it just defies the reasonable expectation that it cannot support its own weight. Then you give it a lift and the lack of bulk becomes apparent. It is, from a size perspective, as much of a departure from the Vizio LCD (I dunno maybe 5 years old) that it replaced as that Vizio was from the ProScan CRT beast that it supplanted.The bezel on the 8000 has been likened to one of those endless pools at Club Med. True dat. If there is edge bleeding, and the bezel is the culprit, then so be it. This is an evolutionary development. I fully expect that my next flat screen will have no bezel at all. Not possible today but the 8000 is the harbinger of things to come.The remote is not the promised beauty from back in the heady days of last winter when this thing was wowing them at the various tech expos. That remote sported its' own little flat screen so if nature called you could just pick it up, take it along and watch the game uninterrupted from your perch. No, the delivered machine is far less Jetsony. You get a TV remote, more or less conventional on one side, and a keyboard interface for navigating the webs on the other side. The keyboard side does have a rudimentary screen that shows what you are typing but why? It's on the TV. I have not gone on a hunt since I purchased in April, but to the best of my knowledge you do need to keep this remote handy to use the keyboard if you are going to interface with the apps. I do not know of a universal remote that obsoletes the keyboard function of this remote. Hmmm, maybe a Logitech DiNovo. That might work but of course I put that in the attic when it was too clunky to use as a primary remote a couple of years back. Of course Samsung elected to not make this remote universal capable so there it is. Use apps, multiple remotes. The good news is if you forego app time, a good universal will run the classic television functions of the 8000.The apps are really a sideshow anyway. Maybe it's just me but I can access Netflix through our HTPC, our Logitech Revue, the PS3, the blu ray player and now the TV itself. Frankly the HTPC is the best way for us.Like Netflix, most everything available by way of the 8000's \"Smart Hub\" (pretentious, vous?) is available elsewhere. There is some Samsung proprietary stuff available through SmartHub, but nothing that I would have been influenced to pay for or seek out.  Smart Hub is slower too, wireless or wired, but if you are that special person that has a blank spot above the credenza in the foyer and it's a tossup between a Jackson Pollock and silver Samsung to tie it all together, well web speed will likely not be a showstopper.The 8000 does however auto update and that is way cool. Samsung, whatever else may be said about them, are proactive when it comes to updates and adding bells and whistles to their apps world. Not apple or android by a long shot, but compared to Sony, Toshiba et al Samsung is on a mission.Now, the TV is world class. One problem with these top shelf tech pieces is that they inevitably run into an intercommunication wall when they are coupled to other gear. Set top boxes, A/V receivers gaming rigs, computers, smart phones and all the Rokus and other fancies can show some persnickitiness when they dance, particularly when HDMI is the orchestra. This flat screen is as good as I have dealt with. It does glitch on ARC now and then, and handshakes are about 90 per cent successful (if this kind of drivel is not registering with you then you would be well served dropping consideration of the overpriced luxobarge and turn your sights towards an 800 buck 55\" flat screen, they are out there). My receiver does not always believe that the TV is turned on when indeed it is. Mostly though, it performs and I won't fault Samsung for the rare hiccup. All HT gear has problems keeping Uncle Sam and the Hollywood ambulance chasers at bay. I use a UPS with conditioning and surge protection. Call me crazy, I paid more for this TV than I did for my daughter's braces. I suggest that if you are inclined to plunk down thousands on a TV then spring a couple of Benjamins for some in situ protection.That's the back-story. The down and dirty is that the picture is mesmerizing.  The picture stops me in my tracks. HeII, it stops the queen dead in her tracks and she is not in the \"Hubby has 3 grand worth of TV in the living room\" fan club. Sometimes  she will be cruising past on her way to whatever it is she is on the way to and she will just slide down onto the cushion next to me and stare at Hillbilly Handfishing or Fareed Zacharia or whatever I'm watching. I can see that she is taken by the picture because she has no interest in the subject matter. Of all the things that I have dragged into the house over the years which she has come to despise this one almost redeems me...almost. The picture is that good. I could wax technical about soap effect and black crush but my wife is compelled to stop and look at fat guys in bass boats trying to get their lures unhooked from sunken cypress logs. That is more of an endorsement of this things PQ than any De Vry College seminar.As far as 3D goes I don't have a comparative scale with other brands delivery. On this machine games and 3D blu ray discs deliver a fun experience, but I find myself playing the games in standard def and I don't ever use the 2D to 3D conversion feature except to verify that it works. Meh. Occasionally we opt to watch a 3D show, but if the 3D component did not exist we would not miss it. The quality of the 2D picture is a continuous source of amazement and that's where the WOW factor is. The 3D is just a perk.I did spend time dialing in the picture. I am not a pro at picture adjustment but I know when I like it, and I like it. Again, if you are dropping large ducats on this don't you think it's prudent to spend a little more to get the picture as good as possible? Just saying.It's stupid expensive, the stand is an acquired taste, and there are many reports of a level of edge bleed that is certainly not acceptable at this price point. Samsung is notorious for their inability or unwillingness to provide world class customer support. One of the focal points of this and other Samsungs, the Smart Hub is an unnecessary add on in a wired house, verdict- gimmick. Same can be said for 3D but at least if you are paying for that function in the TV, the cost is necessary if you want that capacity unlike Smart Hub which is just a buzzword for limited internet access to programming available without it.But, it is a beauty, the picture (at least my picture) is striking, it plays nice with my gizmos, to date < 6 months it has been without problem so I have had a great customer service experience, that is to say none. The Smart Hub is next to useless to me but it is a convenience feature which will be useful to some and, for what it is, it is better than the competition. Buying a 3D machine put us at the top tier of product quality and the resulting 2D picture bears that out. To top it off Amazon has a delivery program that is second to none.I am happy with this machine. It could be better in my perfect world, but it couldn't be much better in this world.", "Date": "September 22, 2011"}, {"Title": "Awarded 4.5 - Excellent PQ but Microdimming needs to improve!", "Author": "Allen H. West \"HDTVOCD\"", "ReviewID": "R20UL4TKW9DPT4", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "If your thinking of buying this panel in the 55 inch size jump to the 60 inch as I got it for close to the same price when Vanns had an Amazon Labor Day Special and when I set it up its the smallest 60 inch panel Ive ever seen because its so beautifully streamlined - I had a 57 Sharp that was 5.5\" thick and weighed 90lbs more and it's display area seemed larger. Anyways, go larger to the 60 if you get a deal and I view at 8.5' and I'd prefer a 70\" to be honest.Now for the good stuff, PQ can be as bright as you prefer even in a sunny room with windows or dimmer and I have a preference for vibrant in my bright sunny room - but it has a large adjustable range to suit your preferences and it's taken me about a week to dial-in my preferences and it's looking better each day it seems. With video gaming I had to set it to game mode and I'm not observing any lag while in that mode.In the sweet spot you rarely notice reflections even though its a glossy screen unless you sit at an off angle or the screen goes totally black - 90 plus percent of the time reflections are not an issue unlike a plasma (was owned and hated for reflections/washout)which can be a twenty/four seven mirror with daytime washout whereas this has no problems staying bright and vibrant even in a sunny room without seeing yourself in the panel.Did a basic calibration with a Disney Wow disk and believe me everything is WoW on a Blu-Ray. Blu-Ray and HD broadcasts are stunning with one Caveat - if you're expecting a Kuro Esque or new Sharp Elite or Sony HX929 black background during black screen credits forgettaboutit! In a dark room I can see some screen uniformity issues with edge bleed and clouds that is disappointing - however, I never observed those artifacts during content display material especially for example Tron Legacy 3D had deep blacks and was simply amazing - while 3D is not perfect yet I am finding some content to be friggin awesome to observe and I like it and saw almost no ghosting of last years model.If your a stickler for the pure blackwhite streaming credits or perfect non-content uniformity in a totally dark rooom with all the lights out at night and you have surplus cash to burn then go for the HX929 Sony or Sharp Elite but again - I remind myself that those panels would cost me 2-3 times what I paid for this Samsung and the 65 Sony isn't available for a few months and I dont believe Vanns sells the Elite 70\" to tradeup and I dont think you have return rights with Vanns otherwise I may consider it.Overall, this TV kicks out fantastic PQ and asthetically is beautiful on/off but you wont believe how small a 60\" TV can be until you view this \"picture window\" model which is why I can understand Samsung developing a 70-75 for 2012.Sound appears to be fine considering its slimness but I have a professional surround system and so its an area I cannot rate but I can't imagine anyone spending this money for a home theater and not having a sound system interfaced to it as thats the other half of BluRay folks.I would rate this panel a 4.5 out of 5 as it falls short with black screen uniformity at night in a dark room with edge bleed and clouding but its not something I can see during normal viewing of HD Source. Microdimming falls short of Sharp Elite and Sony HX929 local dimming full backlit where I'd award a 5 but at a significant cost increase of course. My strategy is to wait a year and rotate this TV to my other room and get a 70\" Elite Gen2 panel and by then the pricing by Sharp may be such that I end up with two TV's for the price I'd pay for Gen1 Elite today.

One would think oh changing capacitors no problem but why should you have to change it?  Not to mention the fact that their high end model experiences this is very questionable on quality.

The TV image was sharp and clear, color was vivid and brilliant and 3D had good depth and was jumping out of screen, everything was good similar to most of the four and five stars reviews. I hung the TV on the wall with Samsung WMN2000B Ultra Slim Wall Mount kit. It looks great on the wall, like a picture frame, admiring the sleek design. Unfortunately, I ignored the one and two stars reviews, thought there were just anomalous. Less than two months, the TV started to turn itself off and on after some streaking images a couple times, thought it was the \"SMART TV\" doing the self adjusting. But just when the NFL playoff games about to start, the TV could not be turned on, maybe it was the remote, so used the power switch on the TV. And TV had click and click sound. The only thing turned on was the SAMSUNG logo at the bottom of the screen, and the logo could not be turned off once it was on, I had to unplug the power cord. Good thing that I watched the games on my other LG TV.Called 1-800-SAMSUNG, stated the problem. Had to read off the model #, serial # and version # off the back of TV. It was not easy on the wall mounted unit. They were quickly acknowledge the problem and created a ticket # and made an appointment to send a technician 5 days later to my house to fix the TV. I had to take time off and waiting in the four hour window. But there was no show. Called 1-800-SAMSUNG again, they said it was because the replacement parts hadn't arrived at the local repair shop. Why not informed your customer? Well, we sent Email but it was returned because of an invalid Email address. Then Why not make phone call, you have both my landline and cell numbers. We thought you preferred Email communication. I preferred to be informed and not to waste half day for nothing. We are sorry and would like transfer you to your Personal Advocate so she could address your issue. She gave me the local repair shop number and asked me to call them directly to set another appointment. I insisted Samsung Service to make the call. And later that day, local shop called me, it was because replacement parts delivery was late by UPS, now the parts arrived and would like to come the next day. Another four hour window. The contracted repair technician finally arrived within the four hour window with the parts, only after a call to verify my home address, because the work order had stated a wrong street name with no house number. The main board was replaced, but power supply board was ok. So I had to update the TV firmware, pair the remote and reprogram the TV again from scratch.I would rate the TV with 2 stars and the services 2 stars, sadly, they don't add to a 4 stars product.

I contacted Samsung and was told to unplug the TV from the surge protector and plug it directly into the wall.  I did but continued to experience the same frustrating problem.  Called Samsung again.  This time, I was told that the firmware needed to be updated and was sent a link to download and install the update.  The link didn't work.  Called again.  The rep walked me through another way to get to the download.  Loaded the newer version of the firmware into the TV and things appeared better - for 2 days!!  Then, the nightmare began again.  Called again.  This time was told to disconnect the power supply for 30 seconds because sometimes the set experienced a \"glitch\".  Did that.  Didn't work.  Called back.  They have requested a home repair visit by a local technician.  That company called and when hearing what was happening, they said it sounded like I needed a new circuit board and power supply, which they would have to order.  Have heard nothing else and the \"SmartTV\" continues to cycle off and back on.  FRUSTRATING but I realize this is not the seller's fault.  Just beware of the product.  Of course, Samsung denies any knowledge of this being an inherent problem.  The picture is crisp and the sound quality is good.  But the darn thing isn't reliable.UPDATE - May 21, 2013.  After the main board and power supply were replaced on April 29, we continued to experience the power going off and automatically coming back on.  This occurs about a dozen times each time you initially turn the TV on.  Also, cannot get a connection to the internet.  Finally, called Samsung again yesterday.  According to their service technician, we now have a capacitor issue which requires as yet ANOTHER visit from the repair company.  That issue is also supposedly why I cannot get a network connection.

I love the design of the TV since there is really not much to it outside of the screen.Of course, like all TVs, the speakers are not great. I'm sure most people that are buying TVs like this have or are planning to have an A/V receiver and at least a couple decent speakers. This is expected really and is not why I am taking 1 star off.My only dislike with this TV is Smart Hub's inability to output more than 2-channel (stereo) audio to the receiver. I stream a lot of videos from my PC using Samsung PC Share Manager. I have to use my Blu-ray Player (Samsung BD-C6900) to get 5.1 surround sound when streaming from my PC. If you don't plan on doing this, than this obviously won't affect you.With the newer model (60E8000) out now, for only a couple hundred more, I would probably recommend getting that instead, unless you can find a good deal on this one.

Basic TV setup is easy (i.e. cable, blu-ray, etc.) is easy and doesn't require reading instructions unless absolutely necessary.  For those of us with particular taste, be warned of the following: the cable hookups are on the left rear.  I had to purchase longer HDMI cables because my previous Samsung 46\" TV had the inputs directly in the rear.  The stand is indeed different in appearance than most, but also screws into the middle lower rear, which I found a bit odd.  Also cable management is performed by a plastic hook that sticks to the base in the rear, which may be small if you have a lot of cables to connect. I have four: power, audio out, and two HDMI; the \"hook\" is pretty much full.  The picture: outstanding!  I read several reviews prior to purchase; some mentioned washed-out blues.  I don't see that on my TV.  HD TV is crystal clear.  Xbox games are awesome!  I was playing Horde mode in Gears of War 3, and the picture looked so great, I was marveling at the surroundings while I got killed! Blu-ray plays great, as well as HD-DVD (yeah, okay now!).  3D viewing is excellent!  The TV came with two pairs of active 3D glasses, which require USB charging before first use.  My first 3D blu-ray was Captain America:  to me, it actually seemed like parts of the picture were coming out at me.  Amazing!

As of this review I have watched the following movies in 3D mode:- Tron Legacy 3D- Lion King 3D- How to Train your Dragon *2D Blueray up mix to 3D Mode*I can honestly say even if the show was not programed for 3D it does show more depth and gives a deeper feel to the show / movie.Game play from 2D to 3D mode also has been a real enjoyable thing to experience.Assassins Creed Brotherhood in 2D to 3D mode has been awesome.Pain in 2D to 3D and even the full 3D modes are both extremely fun.Even connecting my laptop via HDMI to this screen to watch Streaming HD Anime has been great.Bleach in super sized HD is great.", "Date": "November 22, 2011"}, {"Title": "WOW", "Author": "phillysport", "ReviewID": "R1V8JKRAMYPXRD", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I received my new Samsung UN55d8000 about ten days ago, replacing an eight year old Sony LCD with a projection bulb that was getting pretty dim. Replacing that bulb was an option, but given the advancements in these toys I thought it was time for an upgrade.  All I can say is I find it unbelievable that technology will improve the next eight years as it has in the past eight. I find it hard to believe that the brightness or sharpness of a TV picture could get any better than it is on this Samsung. Yes the 3D is awesome, but watching a typical TV series like \"Criminal Minds\", \"Unforgetable\", or \"Blue Bloods\", many scenes appear to be in 2 1/2D. Outdoor action scenes actually appear to have depth of field to them, an incredible viewing experience.Purchased from Amazon with Prime shipping, I was very pleased with the scheduling and the manner in which the product was delivered. It came in a delivery van with the package strapped into the truck. I was a little apprehensive about ordering something as fragile and expensive as this TV online, but the whole experience couldn't have been better.  Watch the prices closely as they tend to jump up or down by hundreds of dollars almost hourly.  However, if you show some patience you will find a price well below any of the big box retailers.The UN55d8000 was very easy to hookup to my other components, but check out your older stuff to make sure that there will be enough available plugs on the back of the set.  There are plenty of HDMI inputs, but only one each component and composite. Definitely go the HDMI route whenever possible.After ten days I'm still trying out all the available features and everything works great.  The only problem I have had is the Smart TV Explore 3D App. Even though I have upgraded my internet speed I can't get a smooth upload playback of this feature. I am sure that it is a Comcast issue since when I use TestMySpeed.Com my numbers are all over the place.When ordered I knew that I would be in for a TV viewing treat with all the features.  But one thing that I didn't realize that I would be able to do is watch pictures and videos directly from my two PCs connected to my wireless network.  The darn things just showed up on my list of available inputs. Start shooting your digital pics in 16:9 format and they will completely fill up the screen.Even my wife, who did not see the need for a new TV, and normally doesn't appreciate top of the line electronics has nothing but good things to say about our new Samsung.This is one great TV and Amazon is one great place to buy it!", "Date": "November 22, 2011"}, {"Title": "Bill in TN", "Author": "William Sexton", "ReviewID": "R2BB0RIKV516WS", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Great TV, very clear and bright picture.

We have a Bose system attached for DVD use and surround sound. The Bose system was purchased a few years ago. Theis tv has a great picture. Now if you require any closed captioning it is NOT available via the HDMI source , you must use the cable source and give up some of the picture quality.Our old tv was a Sony and it had great solid clear sound. This TV has very poor and tinny sound. It sounds like my cell phone in speaker mode.  Some movies are almost inpossible to hear the voices over the background sounds. Yes we did turn off the SRS and that didnt help. We have played with all of the sound adjustments and worked with Samsung on the phone all and all they say it is what it is and suggest a Samsung sound bar for about $300. The speakers shoot down and this may be part of the problem. We tried placing as scoop made of plastic to send the sound forward instead of down and that did help some. So if you plan on this set plan on running a seperate sound system along with it. I guess Samsung should call Bose for a couple of nice speakers.The remote control is poor at best. They have a light on it that stays on for about 3 seconds. You have to move fast with your adjustments in a dark room. The remote need some work for sure. The internet connections are slow and awkward moving thru Netflix is much faster online with you computer then this TV. We have Verizon Fios our speeds are great on our computers.

I chose to go with the 55D8000 after looking around for more than a year. When I started reading multiple reviews about the improvements Samsung have made over last year's \"C\" models, I figured this was the time to take the plunge. My wife and I first saw the Samsung \"D\" model in a local store and the set's ultra-thin bezel and overall thickness of the panel really caught our eye. The set is visually stunning and begs to be hung on a wall like a museum piece. Additional research revealed that it is one of the best in overall picture quality in the LED class. Although some owners have had quality issues such as backlighting, banding, and flashlighting, I have not had any issues whatsoever. Hopefully the quality issues were a result of early model manufacturing and have since been worked out.I am disappointed with the remote however. I thought the QWERTY remote was a cool idea but mine is usually a little slow to respond and I have to press the buttons very hard. One great way around this problem is to use Samsung's remote app for the iPhone and Droid. All the other features that I've tried work really well and were not problematic to setup. Netflix movies stream just fine over the built-in wireless. I agree with others on the sound quality. This is not the TV's forte but most owners likely have external sound systems anyway and don't let this deficiency downgrade the experience. A good sound bar, probably any soundbar, would be a sufficient improvement in the audio.I would also like to mention the outstanding service of the delivery company chosen by Amazon, Ceva Freight Management. They did an excellent job and even moved up the delivery date to the day after I called and requested to reschedule. This resulted in me getting the TV over a week earlier than scheduled during the online purchasing process.

Bad Picture & Bad Samsung Customer Service!!First Issue: General Use Viewing - I read other reviewers about picture quality and troubles with contrast/black areas.  Cartoons and other broadcasts such as sports work pretty well.  I have never been able to adjust the picture quality to a satisfactory level for other types of shows such as sitcoms, dramas, movies, etc.  My previous lcd tv was LG brand and I never had such issues.  This tv picture quality is a disappointment overall.Second Issue: Ghosting/Vertical Lines - After a couple months of using the television and just simply accepting that I made a mistake buying the tv with it's picture quality, the television began to have vertical 1-2\" block of lines and ghosting effects at the left side of the screen.  (This issue has been mentioned in other reviews as well.)  The problem initially occurred once every 2-4 days.  But by simply turning off the tv and letting it 'rest' for a few minutes the issue resolved when I turned it back on.  After a couple weeks, the issue became more frequent and occurred about once a day.  The quick fix was to turn off the tv as previously mentioned.  Now about two weeks ago, the issue escalated to the point that the turn off trick does not work as well as the problem becoming even worse.  At times, the image on the entire screen is ghosted and you can't see the picture.Third Issue:  Samsung Customer Service - I finally called in the into Samsung and a ticket was open about week and half ago.  The selected service center for in-house service called to set-up the appointment for today Friday Dec 2nd (Originally scheduled a week ago when they called).  Unfortunately, they called back this past Monday and told me that Samsung customer care cancelled the appointment and would have it reassigned.  A new ticket was auto generated and I was to wait for the new service center to call and set-up appointment.  No call.  SO I called today and Samsung told me to call the number on the ticket.  I called the authorized service center and they said they have no record of the ticket and couldn't help me.  I called Samsung customer care and they said ticket was sent to them and 'acknowledged' so they should have it and that I should call them back!  I said NO and that they told me they had no record of any ticket. (Good way to pass the buck Samsung.)  I told him he should call and conference them in so he could figure out why they couldn't find the ticket. - The ticket was apparently assigned again to the wrong center and they had no clue.  So after two weeks, I still have a 'broke' $2000+ tv and no scheduled service repair.STAY AWAY FROM THIS TV AND DON\"T COUNT ON SAMSUNG CUSTOMER CARE FOR GOOD CUSTOMER SERVICE!

The image is perfectly sharp, with intense colors and excellent contrast, showing high brightness and deep blacks. Also, it shows notably less motion blur than an older monitor I have. The 3D functionality is impressive and the included glasses work very well. Somewhat disappointing are the apps (applications) that come with this system. The preinstalled apps as well as those that are presently available for download are not comparable with what you can have e.g. on an iPhone regarding both quality and variety. For example, I have yet to figure out how to type in text into the search field of the YouTube application, rather than clicking letters on the displayed keyboard with the mouse pointer.

If you decide to buy this product, you will need to decide from which of the fifteen +/- sellers you want to purchase, and there are some big differences beyond price.  I found this confusing.  You have the option to buy it from:1) Amazon2) A third party seller3) A third party seller, but \"fulfilled\" by AmazonI called Amazon's \"big ticket items team\" to better understand the differences.  They were very helpful, and as I understand it there are three main differences: delivery service, return policies, and price guarantee.  All important.  In short, I decided to buy from Amazon for peace of mind and to get their delivery service, return policy, and price guarantee, even though their price was a little higher than some of the third parties.  Here's what happened.The DELIVERY was good as other reviewers describe.  I got a call to schedule delivery in a four hour window (I think).  Two guys brought it into my home, set up the TV and stand, and powered it up to ensure it's not dead.  I think it's called \"white glove service,\" although they didn't actually wear gloves, which would have been a good idea when touching the delicate screen.The RETURN POLICY seems to be better than most third parties, although I did not return my TV, so can't say how that might go.  Some third parties simply don't accept returns at all, even if the unit is defective, or charge re-stocking fees.  I would read the terms carefully before buying.PRICE GUARANTEE.  About a week after I bought my TV, Amazon's price dropped by $125.  I called them and requested a credit, which they issued immediately.  This is the first time I've ever received a price reduction credit.

I read several negative reviews of the screens having uniformity issues (check AVS forums for more info).  I ended up purchasing this TV from amazon and received it in a timely manner.  Out of the box it seemed great while watching live sports on the default screen settings.  My initial reaction was very positive.  After starting to calibrate the screen and watch some content slightly darker than live daytime sporting events I noticed the colors on the right side of the screen were washing out to a terrible grey/blue tint(color wash out seen while watching The Book of Eli, The Matrix, The Deathly Hallows).  The color loss covered about 30% of the screen on the right edge, and 5% of the screen on the left edge.  After seeing the terrible picture on anything darker than something lit in daylight, I flipped back to live sports and at that point could still make out the color wash out issue since I new where it was on the screen.  Thankfully, Amazon let me return the item.I went back out to local electronics stores to find a different model television.  I could not find another TV that looked as good as the d8000.  I asked a local salesman how many units they went through before they found a unit that worked properly.  He did not have the information but had heard of the screen problems and said they had some of the D8000's they had sold returned for the screen uniformity issue.  He also got out a remote and let me adjust the picture settings.  The d8000 they had on display looked great.Between the sets in local stores, and one of my friends owning a d8000 I decided to give Samsung another shot.  This time I ordered the Samsung UN55D8000 55-Inch 1080p 240Hz 3D LED HDTV (Silver) as all the units I saw in local stores were the 55\" and they all seemed fine.  It has arrived and does not have the uniformity issue.  I am very happy with the 55\" model.  After being calibrated it has an outstanding picture.Amazon had great prices and as always amazing customer service, the two reasons I decided it was OK to gamble on this TV with an inconsistent track record.  After reading the negative reviews on this TV before my original purchase I decided Amazon was the only place I would buy from since I knew they would allow me to make exchanges on the d8000 until I had a unit that worked properly.Now that I have an actual working unit this TV is incredible.  This TV has the best picture I have seen on any TV in this size for less than $5,000 which was my main reason for buying the UNxxD8000.  The picture is incredibly sharp, and there are tons of options for calibration.  The smart TV features seem interesting but I have Netflix and Amazon Instant already set up through my XBox so I won't use it much.  I wasn't really interested in the 3D features of the TV either, but having played with both native 3D content and 2D -> 3D conversion I am impressed.  I won't use it all the time but I will definitely watch some movies when more come out on 3D blue ray(until this point I was completely against 3D content and hoped it was just a fad).  Remote is nice, responsive after you get it sync'd the first time.Overall its hard for me to out and out recommend this TV to everyone. The good ones are hands down amazing, but unless you want to possibly spend time returning one or more units its probably not for you.TLDR:  Amazing TV if you have the patients to return a few units until you get one that works properly.

After shopping the local stores and looking for a price match, I decided to trust Amazon.  Again, I am glad I did.The tv is great.  The picture almost looks 3D without the actual 3D being enabled.

My only regret is not buying it sooner.Here are a couple cons and why I didn't give it 5 stars.1) Samsung's bright colors can wash-out certain pictures.  For example, the grass on football fields tends to look a little blury / bright even after making adjustments.  The bright color compromises quality.

At this point, I recommend staying away from Samsung Smart TV's. They see them as an ad delivery platform.The picture is very crisp and the colors are rich. Quite honestly, however, I am not terribly pleased with the Smart Hub or the remote. A few months or so ago, Samsung pushed an update to Smart Hub and it started showing advertisements for other products. After contacting Samsung to find out how to disable these, I was told you can't.The Smart Hub interface has always been cluttered and ugly. It's even more so now that Samsung has included ads, and certain \"apps\" that you can't disable. Also, some of the apps are no more than a way to see short preview clips of shows on some TV channels, with no way to access the full content. They are useless.The web browser is slow and the interface is painful. You're better off browsing on your laptop / PC / smartphone & sending the display to the TV if you really want your browser window on the TV.While the qwerty keyboard initially seemed promising, it's a disappointment. While it does make it easier to type in things like passwords within the Samsung interface, it *does not work* with any of the apps. So for Netflix and YouTube searches, you're still doing the hunt & peck thing with individual letters. When I asked Samsung why the qwerty keyboard didn't work with those apps, they blamed the app developers. As if Samsung couldn't have worked with them to ensure they were using the APIs for the remote. It could only have led to better applications & a better user experience with the TV.Clearly, Samsung's focus is not the user experience of the product. It's a shame, since the physical hardware is good. They don't see your purchase as your property.

Two days into having the tv on its stand I realized that from the side the tv was curved, looking warped. I had read other reviews on this tv and it all began to make sense. The size and weight of tv does not conform with Samsung's new \"X\" stand. The tv is SUPPOSED to be wall mounted. Well my question is, What if I do not want to wall mount it?Obviously this may not have happened to everyone, but a tv should not begin to warp after two days of using its stand. Besides the warping I was not too impressed with Samsung's 3D settings, they sort of felt weak and blurry. Watching regular tv seemed to work out, I'd give that a 4/5 and watching Blu-Ray on it was outstanding 5/5. As with a majority of led tv's you get that light leaking from the seams of the tv.

However, i will mention just one thing that I wish this setting had.  That is audio delay.  Kinda seems ridiculous that you would need audio delay when not sending sound to external sources or receiving video signals.  The fact is that the image engine is performing a lot of video image processing for sure and I'm noticing a bit of video lag at standard settings from cable input.  Turning off the mpeg filters (there are two) in the menu rids the audio sync issue.  And you would probably never use those filters with a blu-ray movie and if you did you can manage the audio delay in the player.  It just seems logical to me that whenever you have video processing within the tv and you don't insert markers in the audio and video channels to sync them up when outputting that you would provide some mechanism to set the audio delay since the mismatch will exist by design.", "Date": "December 30, 2011"}, {"Title": "Awesome!!", "Author": "D&A", "ReviewID": "R2RXFZSO55499X", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Amazing TV - great picture even when you're not on an HD channel; great menu/online items - - we love the Netflix ability!!!

Great deal, the only problem is that the adapter doesn't come with the M5 screws so be aware.First impresionWhen i first plug the TV it was amazing, the colors are so brigth, and the backlight is very strong. when the TV is turned off you can notice that the screen is a deep black color and a little glossy, you can't almost notice the bezel beacuse is so thin, but the silver color on it is a detail that make it's design so elegant and minimalist, the samsung logo at the bottom has a bright white led backlight and is a little off the bezel some people doesn't like it at first, like me, but when you see it in person it's different it adds the samsung quality seal to their \"masterpiece\".I turned on the TV and paired qwerty the remote (this is a easy process when your read the  instructions in the box) hooked up to wifi rigth away, the TV started to receive updates for a long time an then. I started surfing on the web, this experience was a little dissapointing because i wanted to see for example youtube and other flash rich content websites, YES the tv can load it but is not fluid and the explorer frezzes many times so you just have to wait or turn off the tv. The remote is pretty but is anoying that there is only backlight on the tv remote side, the qwerty side doesn't, and when you use it on the explorer it not a fluid experience too. Then i started to watch standar definiton TV and hands down, it was a jump to HD compared to my old LCD LN32 samsung TV you can notice the diference with the same signal so imagine HD content.Space Saver Flat Screen TV Wall Mount Bracket, Tilt Mount, 20 to 40-Inch ScreensVideoSecu Universal VESA Adapter Plate LED LCD Plasma TV Wall Mount Bracket Extender MLEB 1UU.After one month with my new TV im writing this reviewI have it conected to my xbox, my pc with bluray player.First: the design is excellent, the tv is beautiful and lightweightThe image: excellent is the best of it's kind, you can see real HD, its better than the reality, hehe, you can configure a lot of things to make you happy with the image, at the beggining you can notice some glare in the corners and the borders but only when the TV is all black, when you're playing a movie or watching anything it's not a problem i didn't noticed any ghosting.Remote:It do it's job is confortable and respond so well, is easy to pair and i only did it one or two times.Is anoying that there is only backlight on the tv remote side, the qwerty side doesn't have, you have to put the side of the remote that you are using facing up to control the TV, the qwerty keyboard is not so fluid and the trackpad too, it is not a universal remote so you can't control anything else than the TV.3D:The 3D experience is excellent, i saw some bluray 3d movies and it's better than go to the movie theater, you can see the stuff poping off the display. The 2d to 3d function is very good, you can see some deep at the borders, but is not comparable to 3d content. I liked a lot playing dirt3 with my xbox wheel and the 2d to 3d functiong it adds  reality to the game.3D glasses:They are confortable and lightweight, the battery life is very good, they seem fragile.Sound:It is very good the speakers are facing back and down but it sounds greatGaming:It adds lag to the signal, plus HDMI lag is something to notice. It depends of your level of skill at the game.Conectivity:A lot of HDMI ports, audio out, VGA,usb and some rare conectors for RCA and component wires. It support analog and digital broadcast TV. Yo cant control the level of volume at the audio out, it's fixed, you can't shut it down from the TV and have to control it with another equipment, home teather etc...The DLNA or network sharing it amazing you can grab a video on your computer with a right click play on my tvan then the tv play it at the moment. Or you cant go to the tv video menu and look for the music photos and video of your computer all over wifi.You can plug a usb stick and play music pictures and mp4 mkv divx videos and others or even strem it all.Web browser:I a good browser for a tv, don't spect a pc experience but you can visit all non-heavy websites without problems, just have a lot of patience with heavier pages.Applications:They are not so good, the are a few applications, and nothing to highligth. The search application is good, youtube is good.Social tv:It's verygood you can update your facebook and twitter satuts and chat with gtalk without stop watching tv. The notifications are not so good they are a little messy.SummaryExcellent TV you can't go wrong with samsung design, quality and image.

It's a great feature of the television.Other reviewers mentioned the long time between starting the television and having the picture come up.

I keep hearing about 4K HD, but I'll have to see it to believe that I need it. I am not a videophile, but I appreciate a good image and never watch SD when HD is available (like my daughter). I like Blu Ray and make sure I use them if possible. All that said, the image on this unit is absolutely stunning. The small bezel has been discussed here many times, but it can't be stressed how much of a difference it makes. I like the \"Looking through a window\" analogy I saw in one review. My daughter and girlfriend both keep shaking their heads when we watch BluRay on it. My couch allows us to sit 10' from the screen. That seems pretty perfect to me.Smart Hub is interesting, but I don't use it much. Most of what it does, is duplicated by other media devices I already own.  - It can be slow  - Netflix App is not as good as the Apple TV  - Can't figure out how to fast forward in the \"Explore 3D\" app. It only skips 30 seconds and then has to buffer the video again.3D is more compelling than expected, but I still can't imagine watching an entire movie. It is great for demos though. There is also a lot of content on the \"Explore 3D\" app on the Smart Hub.Streaming from Netflix HD or Apple TV can appear pretty pixelated where it looks fine on my 40\" Samsung in the bedroom.Haven't noticed any screen uniformity issues yet, but I will update if I do.I do notice something I think is called \"ghosting\" with some images. Mostly when I am watching sports highlights in HD. I see a little bit of an image around the fast moving person. I hope that makes sense.I'll come back an update this later since I have only had the set for a week. So far it is exactly what I wanted.

The resolution for the 46\" LCD looked more clean and smoother than this 8000 series 55\" when plugged into my Mac Mini but not really a complaint since it's practically the same resolution but its just trying to stretch it out to the full 55\" so it looks a little grainy even at full HD resolution.

Netflix, Pandora, BBC News, and misc other apps!  I could use my iPod touch and downloaded app to control TV and its many features. Wireless built in. 2 rechargeable active shutter glasses packaged in the box.

I purchase many things on Amazon and have never been unhappy with the product or service.The picture quality is exceptional and I don/t even have it hooked up to my Digital cable box yet.  That comes next week from Time Warner. The sound quality from the set is adequate and I don't think I will invest in surround sound yet.  I love the very slim frame.  The picture looks like a full bleed print.  I recommend this set, the shipper, the whole experience.  I was somewhat concerned reading other reviews about the shipper but I had no problems.  I can see that my husband is going to be a new TV couch potato.  We were not big TV watchers but I see how that is going to change.  Movie and popcorn anyone?We now have had our TV a week and Time Warner sent us our HD Cable Box.  I thought the picture was awesome before??

It took a little bit longer then I would have preferred, but hey who can argue with no tax and free shipping? The Megamind 3D Starter Kit and the free 3D blu ray player both arrived the day before. Both have worked out great so far. All 5 movies were in the starter kit along with two 3d glasses. The 3d glasses work great, you just have to make sure to pair them with the tv before use since they are bluetooth. And make sure to turn them off when you are not using them as they are battery powered and are NOT rechargeable. I've seen some reviews about people saying they are fragile, but i haven't had an issue with that, but i am being very careful. the 3d blu ray player works great as well. i haven't used any of the apps on the player but as far as load time and quality it has worked fine so far. but i have a ps3 so i plan to use the samsung player on my other tv as just a standard blu ray player.Now for the tv, picture quality has been great. After a little bit of foolin' around with the custom settings i've got it absolutely perfect. I got it just in time for the football games and the picture couldn't get any better. The frameless design makes the picture look like its just a little ways away from spilling out into your living room. The 3D is great too. I never enjoyed watching 3D movies in the theater but i had no problem watching shrek all the way through. the glasses that came with the tv were great as well. these are rechargeable in any USB port. Also, they are auto on and off. Meaning after you pair the glasses with the tv, they recognize when a 3d image is needing viewing and they automatically turn on and off, which is a nice little feature. And even if they don't turn off for some reason, they are rechargeable so no sweat. and again, you got four 3d glasses for free so who can complain? It took a minute for me to get the 3D working properly because i had plugged in the blu ray player into my receiver first, and then the receiver into the tv before i realized that i needed a 3d receiver to do that. So temporarily i just hooked up the player directly to the tv and then everything worked fine.The smart tv function is a nice idea. I haven't tried everything on there, but the first thing i did try was streaming netflix and that seemed to work just as well as my ps3 or apple tv. The next thing i tried was just surfing the web and trying to watch a video online. that seemed to not work. the browsing was fine, it was a little difficult to move around especially when you are used to a mouse like most of us are. i tried to stream a movie trailer from a website and that froze on me so the browsing could use some improvement. i haven't tried facebook or pandora or anything but once i do i'll update my review.but all in all, for everything that comes with the tv, the 3d effect, the picture quality, framless design, i love this tv (so far) and have no major complaints as of yet.", "Date": "August 12, 2011"}, {"Title": "woweee Feel Like I am at the movies", "Author": "M.

I'll get strait to the point so you can thank me later because my review is thorough (had it for 3 1/2 months now) and hopefully it would help you decide whether or not to invest in this set or not.For one, you have to first accept the fact that every T.V. has it's own problems. None is going to be perfect! Design wise..OH MY GOODNESS! It's exactly as thin as they say., it's extra light for a TV it's size. The frame bezel of the TV is ridiculously slim making the TV image seem more like 60' There's an illumination from the Samsung logo that glows when the tv comes on. There's a setting to turn this off though. The remote feels nice in hand and love the idea of Samsung adding the qwerty keyboard the back of the remote for browsing purposes BUT IT'S UTTERLY USELESS!! Why?..because the browser on the tv is so counter productive, lacks ease of use that you'll find yourself so frustrated that you'll never use the browser again. That wasn't too much of a downfall because browsing the internet on a TV to access information would be the last thing i'd ever think to do. I have a laptop AND a smart phone for that. The onscreen Smarthub menu is well laid out. Features are great! 3D, DLNA, etc. Also i have to mention People this is one of the very few sets that COMES WITH A PAIR OF 3D SUNGLASSES! Im not a fan of 3D but it comes in handy once in a blue moon considering. I think the glasses are crappy though, that's probably why Samsung included them with the TV instead of charging an arm and a leg for them seperately.Now the Cons: It's true there is a bit of motion blur when it comes to fast pace action like sports even after playing with the settings. The ticker on espn at the bottom of the channel blurs at times when scrolling. The picture quality at first didnt match my expectations but i heard someone say with Samsung TV's you have to give it time for it to settle in and boy after 2/3 weeks it got better...and better. Not only that the picture settings from my cable box was set to 720 the whole time. So be sure when you get this TV or any for that matter to configure your cable fox to 1080p so you can get the best picture. Also make sure the cable box is plugged in via hdmi cord in HDMI SLOT 1, ive noticed 1 takes priority over any other slot. Im telling you the quality on this thing is STUNNING!!The remote has a button to activate the backlight feature so you can see the buttons in the dark. There's a button to turn 3d on and off. I havent noticed the uniformity issues that's been associated with this model and if it did occur it wasnt noticeable enough for me to point it out. Also something you have to understand is picture uniformity is something that's LED plagued..which means it can affect any model, any brand. It' s just something you have to decided you'll overlook when considering a LED TV.Sound is average., nothing to glamour about but the TV does include settings for you to configure the device to produce sound sufficient enough or fits you best.Conclusion: This set is just a beautiful thing to look at. Sometimes i just stare at it with it off. It's beauty just like any other flat screen TV comes out the most when it's mounted..IT'S SOOO BEAUTIFUL :)Remember, every TV is as good as the Image it emits and the image is as good as the configuration of the picture settings. So you could have the best TV in the world but if your settings aren't right it wouldnt matter how great the TV is so play around with the picture settings until you find what suits you.

The picture quality is truly amazing.  Almost everyone who sees it in my house comments on the picture quality, and the TV is in a very bright room with tons of 15 foot high windows.The rest of the review stands.  The Samsung SmartTV stuff is very gimmicky, and really a waste.  If you want to access the internet, find movies, or anything else, you need to look at other options.  Oh, and 3D, it is still a technology that won't go away, but really is not worth watching.  I got 4 of the special glasses thinking that my nieces and nephews would like it when they were over her at Thanksgiving.  Nope, that lasted all of 15 minutes, even with a couple of kid movies.OLD REVIEWI bought this Samsung primarily because the small bezel size allowed me to fit a 46\" into a space that previously only would hold a 42\".  If that is why you are looking at this model, get it.  The picture quality is also as good as most of the other LED TV's on the market.Otherwise, it seems like Samsung has built a TV that is compatible only with their products.  Or maybe the target market is not the United States.Got an iPad/iPhone/iPod you want to connect using Apple's component video connector (which works on 3 different brands in my house) forget it.  Not going to happen, even after calls to their tech group.  What they direct you to is a techie document that describes how to directly connect it using the USB connector.  But, you can only play songs that are MP3 which are like zero, and forget pictures or video.Got an Amazon prime account that lets you view movies for free.  Forget it on this TV.  Only has NetFlix and a bunch of stuff only techies has used before.  If you can add Amazon, it is not apparent how, and the manual is....(see below)Think the Smart TV and QWERTY keyboard will allow you to surf the web and find movies easily.  Forget that also.  Whoever designed the SmartTV functions and TV remote control integration has had zero experience in user interfaces or stuff that is easy to use.  Kind of reminds me of the old VHS video controls & manuals.Ok this might seem petty, but there was a tag attached to a couple of dongles that you have to insert into the TV to use RCA connectors for a component TV input.  The tag said \"caution insert securely lest power cord should be detached in set\".  Nice, but that is a clue as to how the installation manual is organized.There is a section in the manual on how to directly connect the TV to your PC, which I am sure everyone will do with a 46\" or 55\" TV.  But guess what, not a word on how to connect to a cable box or a satellite box which almost everyone in the US who would buy a TV like this has.  During the smart install, there is a section on \"connecting to a cable\"......think that has anything to do with connecting to a cable box?  Nope, it is only if you only have a direct connection to a cable with no box.  hmmm, I wonder how many people in the US have a HDTV cable connection without a box.....At any rate, if you want a 46\" TV to fit in the smallest space this is it.  Otherwise get a Sony, LG, Panasonic, Visio or Toshiba.

Every was fine up to that moment, 15 days later I was watching my \"top of the line TV\" and suddenly the picture and sound went off and a clicking noise (like when its turning on) started going on and off, after doing a first level check (change the power source, waited 30 minutes, etc.) I decided to call Samsung, they told me that the warranty of my UN55D8000 was not international and that I would have to send it back to the US to get it checked.  I decided not to go through the trouble of sending my TV back to the US and sent it a week ago to a local Samsung service to get repaired.

I contacted Samsung to get a repair order on the TV, I bought the TV in the US from Amazon.com and had the TV shipped to where I reside, Caracas, Venezuela; the customer service rep was very rude and basically told me that I had to ship the TV back to the US to get it fixed since their warranty coverage is by regions (whatever that means) so I'm guessing a Samsung TV in the US is different from one bought in South America or Europe or Asia? In this time and age I expect a company to make my life easier, not harder, I recommend that Samsung study Apple's warranty service and coverage so as not to loose more customers to them. So now i'm stuck with a very expensive HDTV and have to pay for the repair myself.

This is a high-end tv at a palatable price.  This tv meets all my minimum requirements (LED due to my well-lit room, min. 1080 p, min 55 in -- I got the 60 inch model, 240 Hz), and more (I got the extra 5 inches, it's 3D -- aren't most now?, and it's a \"smart\" tv).  Now, there are a lot more extras here, but I needed a large tv for a room that receives quite a bit of light, and I wanted a quality high def picture with the best refresh rate.  This tv provides that.The picture is great.  I did pay for a professional calibration.  If you are not a person who reads the manual beginning to end, perhaps a professional calibration is for you.  I thought the picture quality was great before the calibration.  After the calibration, it is outstanding!  (I did not know what I was missing).  However, there are websites out there with suggestions for calibration.Samsung touts the small bezel edge.  Quite frankly, I didn't think I cared about that \"small bezel edge.\"  However, once you get the tv in your house, you realize how seamless your picture appears before you.I have had this tv for 3 months now.  I have had ZERO problems.  Yes, I read websites where people talk about \"ghosting,\" bleeding, edge-lighting, etc.  My picture quality has been perfect.  The calibration made the colors more \"real,\" but I have had ZERO problems with my set. Now, when I went for a nice tv, I did not skimp on the surround sound or receiver.  Holy cow!  This tv is part of a set up that is perfect for the family room. . . truly impressive.To sum up:  my Samsung UN60D8000 is the most valuable personal property item in my home.  (Yes, I have nice couches, but they can burn as long as the tv is saved).  It is high quality, and I cannot imagine watching sports or DVDs on any other tv.

But one of the primary reasons we bought it is to use the embedded Skype functionality to talk to our family. This is how it goes:In summer 2011 I bought Samsung D series TV (8000 model) as documented in my initial review below. In the product description this TV clearly shows that it supports Skype[...]On the other hand, the list of applications for this TV doesn't list the Skype application as of today[...]The reason I have noticed this is because I have the Samsung camera for Skype and the picture quality was horrible with the version that was current in the summer. I am always up to date with firmware but it didn't help. Then after I submitted couple of negative reviews and asked questions, there was an update to Skype in the fall which greatly improved the quality. Finally this camera was showing its promise. The angle was tight, but i was fine with it, since it convered our entire couch, and the quality was greatly improved.Then about a month or so ago, as it is documented on Skype forums the Skype application disappeared from the App store for this TV and deleted itself from the TV. After people complained, the application appeared again, but the version of the app is from February 2011. Clearly it is not the updated version which was provided this fall. And since now I have noticed that Skype is not listed as supported application for this TV I am starting to wonder what is happening with Skype on this TV. The quality of the video is quite bad, it starts good and then quickly deteriorates. Then after few minutes it resets itself and again quickly deteriorates so you cannot even recognize the person on the other end.I can immediately connect with the same person on iPad or on PC and have great video quality. This signals to me that the problem is not in the connection, speed or the other persons camera or computer, but the problem is in my TV, the Skype application on the TV or the camera.The Skype application on this TV looks also quite different than the pictures available on Samsung website[...][...]Also it is weird that the Skype application is registered and available in the App store twice.In any case, I am wondering if Samsung D TV owners could comment on their experience with Skype on their TV. What version is your application (1.1xxx), when it was last updated and how it is your video quality.Until the issue is resolved I cannot recommed this camera or using Skype on this TV.", "Date": "December 4, 2011"}, {"Title": "Nice set, but not worth the price", "Author": "J.

Immediately afterwards, a clicking sound occurred while the TV seemed to be trying to turn itself on over and over again; but to no avail. This is apparently the same \"bad capacitor\" problem that can be found on the Net with many different Samsung TVs over the past 2-3 years!Wow...I could easily feel like a sucker for not researching this HDTV before I bought it; but, I also have a 52\" LED Samsung that is very good and has been running (almost!) everyday for almost 3 years...But I am not off the hook yet; I now recollect it was a good TV, only after Samsung came out and repaired my \"capacitors\" at month-2! So, it now seems inexcusable that the exact same problem occurred with a new Samsung HDTV 3 years later.I would also like to mention the things I did not like about the Samsung UN55D8000 while it was running.  Why bother?  Well, I do not see most of these issues with Samsung on the Net; however, I had definitely had them.  As a professional (I am a PhD biomedical researcher) who has used complicated video equipment for decades, I believe these problems speak less of Samsung's quality control and, perhaps, more to how Samsung apparently processes incoming HDMI signals...In the end you will be the judge of my opinions.In general, the Samsung picture looked very \"DIGITAL\"...every little \"bit\" of light on the screen looked like a \"dot\", not like a unified picture.  No matter how adjusted this was the case and it was very annoying because of the non-stop \"graininess\" of every image even at 8-10 feet away! In addition movement is a problem...images that are moving even smoothly and slowly would just all of a sudden \"jump\". I have never seen anything like this before.In addition, the colors are in a narrower spectrum than any TV I have ever seen. The same colors kept appearing over and over again in different scenes and object combinations. A Samsung favorite seems to be a pinkish-orange that on a new Sony will show unlimited different shades of red, orange and/or pink in different scenes.  Similarly, most blues looked the same!  I know...this is hard to believe.Finally, as some others have noted, there were the \"Background/Blackness\" issues.  I just want to add that there are (too) many adjustments for various aspects of this issue; but, in the end, I could not find a combination that looked right.  Mostly on the right side and corners of the screen there is a grayness (instead of black) that is sometimes there and other times not...this just seems to occur for no particular reason!So, yes, I was kind of glad it blew-up and put itself out of its own misery because I do not like to return things, let alone big expensive things like this...The solution to these problems is the relatively expensive Sony BRAVIA XBR55HX929 55-Inch 1080p 3D Local-Dimming LED HDTV with Built-In Wi-Fi, Black; bought/exchanged from Amazon (Thank you Amazon for such great service!), I have had this HDTV for almost 4 weeks and as others have reported, it is indeed, \"Incredible\".Totally unlike the Samsung, no matter what the input (old VHS, Blu-Ray, Comcast Cable Network, etc.), this SONY just makes it all look at least good, if not \"Crazy Fantastic\"!  I have never seen a TV like this...definition, depth of field, color, whites, blacks, movement are just All Perfect.It will be a long time before I ever consider Samsung again.

There is little/no warning that this will be handed over to a third party freight deliverer. If your phone number is not correct in amazon preferences you will have a lot of problems. There was no indicator to me that my tv was sitting in a warehouse with Spirit Delivery having no plans to deliver it because they couldn't reach me by phone. I had no idea someone would be trying.

Extremely thin and really really light. I attached the mount by myself. Really easy to carry around. I hooked it up, turned it on and did the setup wizard. Really easy. Disclaimers appear on your screen. Just clicked agree agree agree. I don't have cable so I do all my watching through digital air antenna or streaming Netflix, Hulu etc. First thing I noticed wrong was the poor quality of the air antenna receiver. Scan only a few channels. So I thought it was no big deal because I can manually switch to a channel and adjust the antenna to get good reception, little did I know I was wrong. After you auto scan for channels, it won't allow you to manually change it to a channel. So if didn't scan it you can't watch it even though you try to adjust the antenna. Really? $2k Tv and it does that. Sucked for me bu I will mention that certain channels looked amazing in color. Could see ever single detail on a persons face. Second Thing that went horribly wrong was the extreme poor quality of the WI-FI. When I set it up it read maximum bars but when I actually connected to Hulu or Netflix or even their  3D app, it would pause all the time. I don't know why. I have a speed of about 15mbps and all my wireless devices and blue ray play work without flaws. I moved the TV about 1ft away from the modem. Same problem. So I knew there was something wrong with the TV. Again $2k tv and it's wi-fi is crap. The last thing that let me down was the blur. Fixed all setting but could't get rid of the motion blur.

Today when I launched a Smart HUB,  a message came to the screen  that the software needed to be  updated.  I pushed okay, it updated.  Guess what happened?  Netflix was gone. It did not ask me if  I wanted to keep Netflix or not, but it just killed. I need my Netflix app back.  There was no mis even not in Samsung web site.2.  YouTube.  It t is just a \"take it or leave\" proposition. It just shows whatever Samsung wants to show.Also remote is so sluggish that I do not even know  where  I am.Oh It showed another message that the software needed to be updated and Netflix came back after upgrade was completed.

Perez \"gadget afficionado\"", "ReviewID": "R3SLHLU7JRGHA9", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "(PLEASE NOTE: This review is not about this tv set, it is mainly about Samsung and the way I was treated with their customer service. I purchased an LN40C650 just over a year ago. The review is posted on that product on Amazon, and I wanted to share my experiences with Samsung for anyone and everyone to see.)------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------I want to start off by saying that the Samsung LN40C650 tv set is great. The picture quality is awesome, local and internet streaming work perfectly, and I was extremely satisfied with this unit, until...About a week after my 1 year warranty expired, I began to have problems with the ethernet adapter on the tv. I called Samsung to see what troubleshooting steps I could take to resolve my issue. The problem was that no matter what cable I used or what port on the router was used, the tv could not connect to my network. (Keep in mind that I am a network technician and understand how networks work, and knew exactly what the problem was.) After relaying that same information to multiple agents when calling Samsung, every time I called they wanted me to go through the same troubleshooting steps. I informed them that the problem was with the ethernet adapter on the television. When the tv was plugged in, the router light would never come on, and it would never get an IP address from my router. To test this, I plugged in a laptop using that same cable, and it immediately worked without any problems. So I knew that the ethernet port was the problem and not my router (which I have two routers, and tried both of them).So, after speaking with multiple reps at Samsung, I finally spoke to an agent who I believed was going to help me. Myself and the agent went through the same troubleshooting steps, but still unable to resolve the issue. So he asked if I had registered my product to be eligible to have my warranty extended for 3 months. I told him that I had registered, and he looked up that information successfully. I even received an email stating that my warranty had been extended for three months. The agent then proceeded to get a work order so that a technician would contact me to setup service. At this point, I am under the impression that I will be covered under the extended 3-months. (To make a long story short) I received a call from the Samsung technician in my area, and stated that Samsung did not inform him that my tv was under warranty and stated that Samsung would have to send documentation that it is still under warranty. So I contacted Samsung, once again, and I was told that since the unit was out of the first year warranty, I would not be able to have my tv repaired, and that I would be responsible for the service if I decided to have it serviced. I even forwarded the email that I received about my extended 3 months of warranty to the Samsung rep, and was told that they could not honor that warranty, and I would be responsible for the service.I am not here to bash Samsung for the way I was treated. I understand that I was out of my warranty at the time when I started having issues, and I understand that they technically do not have to provide me with anything. I am simply writing this to inform potential buyers of my issues with this television set and how my issues was 'resolved' by Samsung. This is more to inform you about the company, more than it is about this specific product, which if the one i purchased.I reiterate, this product looks fantastic. It has the ability to stream Netflix, Hulu, MLB.TV, Youtube, etc. I even have a few DLNA applications(such as PlayOn, Twonky, and a Windows Home Server with built in Media Server capabilities) and this television played all of my media (videos, music, and photos) that were located on my server and my main computer.But, please be informed that if you begin to have issues, even just a day out of your warranty, you are on your own.", "Date": "September 12, 2011"}, {"Title": "False Advertising", "Author": "Stoney", "ReviewID": "RUVWGG6P3DUIU", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I ordered this TV expecting the small bezel as was advertised on the Amazon website and supported by the links on the Samsung website.

On its second anniversary, it stopped working due to a faulty power supply.  It is now two months since I put the TV in the repair shop.  The repairman has been unable to get the replacement part so far and has no idea when or if he will get it.  He says this is a common problem and had one in his shop that took a year to get the part.  He says that Samsung has a terrible customer service department.  While I wait, I decided to do some online research into complaints and found that there are many people out there with the exact same problem.  One such person was an engineer in California who said it appeared to him that Samsung TV's are deliberately underengineered by using inferior capacitors.  Don't take my word for it, check ConsumerAffairs.com.  They say that in the past year they have been flooded with complaints by Samsung customers about similar issues.I will wait another month before buying another TV, and can assure you I will never buy another Samsung.  The salesmen are still telling customers it's the best TV out there.  It isn't.  Don't be fooled, just do your own research before buying.  My criteria is simple: if it spends a lot of time at the repair shop instead of entertaining me, it's a bad investment.

I've never had an issue with amazons customer service before.  But in this case my immediate thought was it would be easier to go down a get the same tv for a bit more from the local tv store.
