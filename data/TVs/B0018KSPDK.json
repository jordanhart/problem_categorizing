{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Nice TV if you need a small HDTV set", "Author": "terpfan1980 \"Barry\"", "ReviewID": "R2IA54CG96CRKT", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I got this TV compliments of the big V telco/data company.  The big V telco promised customers that signed up for their Fiber Optic to the home service triple play bundle a free Sharp Aquos TV.  Apparently their offer was very popular and lots of customers like me signed up during their promotion.I note that this particular Sharp LCD TV doesn't make mention of the Aquos model/brand, tough it is a very nice HDTV set if you are in need of a smaller set.  As a kitchen/dining room set, or perhaps as a TV for use in children's rooms this Sharp model (LC19SB25U) would seem to be a very nice choice.  It delivers crisp and sharp (no pun intended) pictures with it's 720p capability.  (1080i or 1080p would downconvert nicely on this set)  In my case, this TV serves me well for watching TV a few feet over on the corner of the desk in my den/playroom type area.  It offers me the opportunity to watch TV programming while using my regular HDTV to play video games on, on most nites serving up the nightly baseball game :-)The remote control is adequate, and the available connections are also quite adequate (including an HDMI port and PC input port, features not always included on smaller LCD TVs).  Documentation included with this TV is complete and thorough without being too confusing or hard to use.In most cases a larger TV may be priced within range of this Sharp LCD TV, and you may find the larger size is more important than the input ports or other impressive features found on this Sharp LCD TV.  Research the features you'd gain or lose along the way before buying just to be sure you aren't making a bad decision.", "Date": "June 5, 2008"}, {"Title": "Nice little TV", "Author": "A. McIntire", "ReviewID": "R2I4NSVZBCSSMI", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "After reading the other reviews here, and checking this model (and others) out at brick & mortar stores, we decided to buy it despite the negative comments on the sound/volume.  As others here have noted the picture is quite nice, but more important we did not have any problems with the volume.  We have not yet turned it up over maybe 1/3 of the total, and it is plenty loud enough for our living room.  Granted, we are not vacuuming while watching TV, but we do have a couple of rambunctious kids, and the TV is plenty loud enough with them running around.------------------------------(later)Well, some videos (disc & tape) seem to need the volume turned all the way up to hear, but most things are just fine at 1/4 to 1/3 volume level.  Don't know what makes those videos different, but they consistently need the volume boost, while others never need it.  Regular TV (over the air or via cable) never needs the boost.", "Date": "August 27, 2008"}, {"Title": "Very good HDTV", "Author": "D.

Has a super clear picture... works flawlessly in 480P mode with my Nintendo Wii and Dvd. The built in digital tuner was able to pick up about 15 Digital HDTV Channels using a standard indoor rabbit ears antenna. I am also very impressed with the black level and contrast. Will also connect to a pc in in full 1360x768 resolution. This tv also has an optical out for connecting a dolby digital 5.1 tuner. It amazing to get True DD 5.1 surround sound from shows such as CSI Miami. The built in speakers are only 2 watt. So I recomend use of external speakers with this set. the resolution of 720P is perfect for this size HDTV. 480p sources such as dvds and wii across the component cables scale very well and look great.

The color is very good, the picture can be seen from all angles.  The sound is more than sufficient for our purposes; the TV is placed in the kitchen.  If there is a lot of noise around, you will have to turn the volume up nearly all the way.  I was a little surprised by the weakness of the speakers.  However, that said, I was purchasing for a specific purpose and it fills that need very well.  It is hooked directly to the cable box through the HDMI port and it was a breeze to install.  I do question why the screen is slightly tilted past the vertical with the top ever so slightly forward, however, I do not see where that makes a difference with the picture quality.  With it sitting on the countertop, it might even be helpful. An adjustable stand would have been a nice feature.  The dimensions are especially nice as its vertical dimension is 14.1 inches and allows it to fit nicely under our cabinets.  Based on the price, quality of the picture, and its looks, it is a very nice product.", "Date": "December 19, 2008"}, {"Title": "Nice Picture But Where's The Sound", "Author": "M. D.

I have it connected to Comcast cable without a digital/HD box and the picture on all channels is great.  However, the sound is another thing.

EASILY fixed.", "Author": "Arthur Kimes", "ReviewID": "R1WB4A6WRSMFGL", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Many reviews complain about the sound.  The standard speakers/amp aren't very good.  It's hard to put good speakers in a small thin space.  But the fix is easy and inexpensive.Get a 2.1 speakers system (2 powered speakers and a powered sub-woofer).  Something that can be plugged into this TV's headphone jack.  There are many of them on Amazon - I'm using this one - the Logitech S220 2.1 Speaker System.  It not only sounds great, it delivers enough volume for me to listen to the TV when I'm using my very noisy exercise bike.You might be able to fix it for NO cost.  Try the speakers from some old computer you don't use anymore.  So long as they're powered speakers you'll get much higher output than you're getting from the TV now.  (But if you can, get the 2.1 system. A powered sub-woofer makes all the difference).What about the rest of the TV?  I don't have a lot to add to the other reviews. The picture is fine.  Menus are a little tedious but the remote is well laid out.  There's a tremendous amount of fine tuning you can do if you want to tweak the picture - I've never seen so many color options (in the advanced menus).A number of reviews say the picture is a bit on the dim side.  I suppose so but after adjusing it using one of the THX guides on a DVD I think the picture looks about as good as the one on the 37\" Panasonic Plasma in my living room.  Anyway, I've had this TV for a few months now and I'm used to the picture now.

I didn't believe it as we have a slightly older model with a silver grille surround on both sides that sounds very good with plenty of volume.  Well, the new model doesn't have the side grilles, and the sound is just not adequate!!  In addition, with the backlight on full, the picture brightness is not nearly as good as the two year old model.  It is sad to see that Sharp's two years of additional development results in a dimmer and tinny sounding replica!

Despite being extremely specific with my question, I was apparently lied to and purchased an LC display that DOES NOT support HDMI input from a computer.While the LC-19SB25U supports A/V input from an HDMI cable, it refuses to calibrate or connect with my computer. As a PC/Mac monitor it only supports VGA input which is NOT high-definition. A standard VGA-out tube television can do the same thing for $30.To compare, I also own a 27\" \u00d6levia HDTV. It cost less than $400, supports HDMI input from virtually all sources (including my computer), can be updated with firmware and has superior sound and image quality. While the \u00d6levia may not be true 16:9, it supports 1080p and is offers about twice the screen size for the same or less money.I absolute do not recommend the SHARP LC-19SB25U as a monitor or television.

We decided to give it to our son for his video watching/gaming & purchase a new one. We have a Samsung in our living room & love it, so decided that we would go w/that in our bedroom, but happen to come across this Sharp on sale at Wal-Mart & purchased it. Most of the LCD tvs we looked at had horrible sound, so we don't care if we need to hook up speakers to it (so far it's great). It's a great looking tv!

I found this set at a local brick'n'mortar retailer, and I was impressed. For the price, this thing is jam-packed with features. 720p HD, inputs for co-axial TV, composite with optional S-video, component RGB, HDMI, and a VGA connector that can take analog video from a computer.The display is lovely, and the 16:9 aspect ratio is perfect on my game console. Though the display is only 19\", and the built-in stereo speakers aren't too powerful, neither of these issues is a drawback for me. I use this thing in a bedroom, and I'm never more than six feet away from it. Its display size and volume are perfect for so small a space.What I love best about this TV is that, with its VGA computer-video input, I can switch between using this as a display for my game console and using it as a secondary widescreen monitor for my PC. The display quality somewhat poor by PC standards, but it's plenty good enough for text-based applications like chat programs.I am very happy with this purchase.

I agree with the other reviews regarding the low volume however.  I took my computer speakers and hooked them up and they were much louder than the tv's speakers.  They are just a temporary fix since I plan on buying a nice speaker to mount under the counter alongside the tv.  So for another $20 bucks or so I'll be up to $218, which is still a good deal in my opinion.  It is a nice looking tv!
