The LG plasma had an amazing picture quality and ultra fast 600Hz refresh rate, however, provided too much glare due to the reflective glass.I then bought this Westinghouse since it was also 60\" and about $150 less!I don't have any glare issues with this TV.  The picture quality is great, not quite as incredible as the LG however.  I don't have both TV's side by side so I don't think picture quality really matters all that much.  The refresh rate on this TV of 120Hz isn't a hinderance, fast motion still looks comparable in my opinion with the LG plasma.My only gripe is the picture settings.  You can only choose: standard, dynamic or mild.  I like the way MOST TV's have preset settings such as: movie, game, vivid, standard, etc.  This is the first TV that I have actually had to set the levels myself (user setting).All in all, this is an exceptional TV for the price.

I was a little concerned about some of the reviews with this TV; however, there were enough positive reviews to offset them so I made the decision to buy it for $950.  I've had the TV for about a month now and have watched TV and movies in HD (no Blu-Ray yet) and the picture has been great.

I really like the TV overall. I purchased this Westinghouse to replace a 42\" Panasonic Plasma that was purchased in 2009. I just wanted a bigger TV. I can tell you that for the most part I like plasma TV's more than LCD. However, I was surprised how good this unit is for the price. This TV is backlit with Cold Cathode Fluorescent lamps and not the new LED. It had a sticker on it that said if I run it each day for 5 hours or so it will cost me just shy of $78 of electricity for a whole year. Thats better than my 42 inch plasma was as they tend to suck the juice a bit. This is a REALLY bright and really big tv! I sit about 14 feet away from this TV in my living room. It is so big when I watch the news you can see all the pancake makeup they put on the local newscasters. I can now tell for the first time which local networks broadcast in 720 and which are 1080i as you can notice a slight quality drop (not the TV's fault). Just be advised that the pixels are much larger than your typical 42 inch TV. So overall I took a slight hit in crispness but gained so much more viewing area (1.6x more pixels than my old unit I retired to the bedroom) I have a few over the air channels like METV and the music channel called COOLTV that still broadcast in 480 and with this large of a TV they are just barely watchable now. Not a big deal as just about all broadcast should be HD by this time. Tonight when I watched the Grammy awards broadcast on CBS in 1080i over the air in my area I could notice that on the singers gold ear inserts he had a fingerprint on them in a close up shot so thats pretty darn good. The quality on all full HD viewing inputs is really good. I watched the movie Inception on Blu-Ray and it was astounding! I like how this unit remembers your picture settings for brightness etc. for EACH input (HDMI1, HDMI2, TV etc) That is really helpful. I liked the fact that is not internet connected as that allowed for me to purchase a standalone ROKU XS box for full 1080 HDMI connected NETFLIX, HULU, AMAZON, CRACKLE, and HBO GO. So I saved a bit of money customizing to my exact needs as I dont know of another built in option for HBO GO for example. I purchased this unit for $799 minus $10 coupon on a pre-black friday sale. It was delivered with Prime shipping via Amazon just 5 days later by Pilot services because of this units weight. ( about 110 lbs in box) The person was nice while I placed it on the pedestal stand and helped me set it on the TV Table and he verified that it powered on with no cracks or defects. Set up was pretty straight forward... One thing that was new for me that in order to scan for over the air HD channels you have to first activate the built in tuner! ( I guess thats an anti theft measure?) Not a big deal as I just went to the manufacturers support webpage and input the units serial number from the screen and with the ariel antena connected it immediately found all the channels. You can also call them or even text them so its real easy. Some people complain about the internal speakers being weak but its not that bad. It has Digital Coaxial as an option for sound output but I only barely messed with that and could not get broadcast TV to pump into my sony unit for surround sound. I can however connect that same cable from my Sony receiver to my Blu-Ray so that works out nice and sounds good when I watch BLU-Rays. If anyone knows why I cant use the Digital Coax out from the TV directly to input into the Sony Receiver unit drop me a note. IT is labeled DVD on my Sony but I dont know why that would matter as it should act like any other AUX. It would be nice to listen to TV into my Sony but that ok right now as I will tinker later. One last thing I like on this unit is a picture setting called \"Control MEMC Level\" thats ads a motion smoothing to the screen that pretty slick when you turn it to \"strong\" on action scenes. Its adds like a \"POP\" to the screen thats hard to describe but looks great! Well, I hoped my review helped. This is an awesome unit and I still have 22 days left to decide wether or not I want to keep it or ship it back to Amazon for free. I think I will keep it.

I have had it for three days now, and in my opinion it has an absolutely stunning picture.  I don't have cable, but get the over the air HD channels.  I am watching my first football game on it and it's beautiful.I am just a general tv viewer.  I didn't care too much about internet apps and stuff like that because I have a WDHD media player that plays just about everything I could ever want it to, including netflix and stuff.  We watch a HD movie with that on the tv last night and I couldn't believe how good it looked.I don't do a whole lot of gaming or anything like that, but I do have a wii.  We were playing super mario brothers on it and it seems like there is a little bit of controller lag on it.  Other people that have the same problem say that it has something to do with the tv processing the video so that it looks better on the HD screen.  They suggest putting it in \"gaming mode\", but I can't seem to find one.  I will try a component cable and see if that fixes the problem.  That is the only complaint that I have about this tv, but it isn't that big of a deal for me.I thought that I would have to upgrade to a blue ray player, but I hooked my dvd player up with component cables and OMG I don't think the picture can get any better that what it had.As far as the speakers go, I don't think that they're as bad as some other people have said.  They aren't surround sound or anything, but for an $800 tv, I think they're pretty good.I'm so glad that I got this tv instead of waiting in line at best buy.  I got the same size tv for the same price and didn't have to pay tax.  They delivered it on the morning of black friday right to my front door.  Can't get any better than that!EDIT: I picked up a used component cable for my wii off ebay for 8.99 with free shipping.

Please read the following for why.I'd be very careful purchasing either one of these TVs.  I can assure you at least 1 of them is returned as I was the one who returned it.  I'm also fairly confident the other one was also returned.  When I purchased my TV there had been 3 of these TVs available used.  By the time I purchased mine there was only 1 left.  Then 1 showed up again, and after I returned mine (which was labeled \"used, like new\") it showed back up on amazon as \"used, acceptable\".  Well, the TV I returned had 3 black dots on the screen that was only viewable with the TV on.  I refused delivery on the spot and purchased a different brand TV new from Best Buy.  Bottom line, don't buy either one of these TVs as at least one of them is junk.  I'm pretty sure the other one was returned too so I would just stay away.  Don't get trapped by the, \"Good price for the size\" like I did.

Beckstead", "ReviewID": "RYZMS4ONG22XO", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "First off let me start by saying that I'm not going to review LED vs LCD vs Plasma. Let's all assume that you've done your research and settled on an LCD. Since you're going that route, I can't deny that this TV is a great buy. I've had it for about 3 months and I am pleased every day. The color looks great, the resolution is just as expected and the value was awesome.When I started looking to buy  a TV, I really looked for one that had the picture quality that I wanted, without all the added price of good internet apps, or great built-in speakers because I have a home theater setup complete with receiver for sound quality and a sony blu-ray player that has all the apps I'll ever use. It ridiculous to pay $500 more for a tv with apps when you can pay $50 more for a blu ray player to plug into the tv that has all the same apps.  So for that, I love this TV. 3 HDMI ports is all I need since I use my receiver for everything.Must mention that the smoothing feature that the TV offers to try and mimic a higher refresh rate ( or at least try to smooth the pixels) doesn't really work. It'll give you a headache after 15 minutes. If you want the best refresh rate out there, this isn't the TV for you.Let there be no doubt, there are better TVs out there. Sure I'd like to go to work in a helicopter, but I drive a car because it's a better value for my usage. I'm an average user who likes watching sports, playing games, watching blu-ray movies, (but I don't live in front of a TV 24/7) and if you're like me, you can't beat this westinghouse for quality vs price.", "Date": "December 31, 2011"}, {"Title": "Excellent Value", "Author": "W.

Then I found this TV - - - FOR $650 FROM AMAZON'S WAREHOUSE DEALS (refurb, used, or floor model)!!!  Needless to say, my jaw dropped in disbelief at this practically disposable, 60\", 120mhz, 1080P full-definition LCD TV!!!!  So WTF, I bought it.I was somewhat skeptical about the reviews, but then I found 2 other very helpful reviews here regarding Westinghouse's production line issues (basically, it sounded to me like 1 in 3 of these TVs they make work).  A couple others have bought this and had to return it not once, but twice to Amazon before they got one that actually worked (see their reviews for details).  They also added that Amazon shipped out the new ones at no cost nearly immediately, so I felt safe making the purchase even with the potential inconvenience.  And, free shipping :)  I got lucky though - the first one was the charm for me!!!!It's a beautiful TV.  It's got a matte rather than glossy screen (I prefer glossy) but as we all know, you're better off with matte for refection/glare.  It also has the piano black frame and other than the \"W\" on the front, you wouldn't know it from the ever-popular Samsung work of art.Picture is great, perhaps not unbelievable and 3D-ish looking like a Bravia, but how can you go wrong at this price point with these specifications?  Remote is basic and standard, and although many complained about the sound, I was able to adjust it to a sound that works just fine for me (and I'm very into sound).  It's not a big deal considering any plasma or LCD has mediocre sound at best in the first place.  If need be, wire up a sound bar or sound system but again, I don't even find it necessary.This TV is easily worth $1300-$1500 in my opinion so looking at it that way, and comparing it to my value estimate, I got mine for about 50% off.  Unbeatable deal.  I should actually buy another.  They had 6 of them left after I bought mine.  One word to the wise; if you're dealing with used, refurbs, or floor models, I would only go with the ones that are rated the highest, especially since you can't see pics of the damage or actual model.  I could have bought the others for as low as $629 but I figured I should go with the best condition one in stock, so I did, and I'm not disappointed.  It is in MINT condition, and I'm not exaggerating.  It even came with the original box with all packing material, remote, batteries, and manual.

I almost bought this same tv from Walmart but they would not allow me to use their newly obtained Walmart credit card online with them where this tv was only available for 899.00. I was only allowed to use their card in the store I was in when obtained. So I went home and was disgusted and did a search on Amazon and found the same TV $200 cheaper with a good service plan. Plus, with Amazon's excellent 12 month deferred interest, free shipping, I have plenty of time to pay off this purchase without putting me in the poor house.Read the reviews and thought, okay sounds like people more than not like their purchase.I've had the TV for a week so far and I am overly pleased with this purchase. The picture is excellent and size really does seem bigger than my old 62\" projection tv. Good thing I didn't get a 62\" flat or it would not have fit in same area. The reviews I read before buying were very helpful. The only downside of this TV is the TV's internal speakers. Not very loud with no bass but tv easily hooked up to my home sound system and sounds great.

Beams \"JB\"", "ReviewID": "R2E4RGSMAO6YG7", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "This TV is an upgrade to my Westinghouse 42\" LCD TV that I've had for about 4 1/2 years now. I've had zero functional issues with the 42\", so I wasn't afraid of getting another Westinghouse. The TV doesn't have anything special, but for the low price it is a bargain. It does what a basic TV should - it has a great picture and enough inputs for my needs.As someone else mentioned, there is no audio out, but I never use the TV speakers anyways.  I could see how this would be annoying if you wanted to use the internal tuner with external speakers, so be aware this configuration won't work with this TV.Regarding the built-in speakers, if you're buying a TV this large you may as well buy a home theater system for audio to match. Or at least pick up a 2-channel stereo receiver. Don't complain, you got 60\" of TV for probably the lowest price possible, who cares if the audio from it sounds like a 20\" TV.I have my XBox360 attached via VGA (old-school model) and this also works well at a full 1080 x 1920 resolution. At first I thought the blacks weren't very dark, but I found that I just had to reduce the brightness a couple notches to get a much better picture.Cable box is connected via HDMI. No adjustment necessary here. It just works and looks great. There were some artifacts of fast motion on some channels that at first worried me, but I watched a Bluray on my PS3 and there were no artifacts at all. Any I've seen have been because of the cable company compressing the signal too much.A couple nitpicky things. I expected a few given some minor things with the design of the user interface of my 42\".- To change the input you have to choose from the source menu, scroll down to the one you want, the press OK. My 42\" had a button for each type of input (so much faster).- Using the built-in analog tuner the picture seems quite overexposed. I haven't tried adjusting the color yet, but it's only temporary as my cable box started acting up lately.- Somewhat unrelated, but if you use a Logitech Harmony remote, the power-up time is about 15 seconds (they listed it as being much shorter).And something I just dont understand:- I can't figure out how to receive digital channels via cable. There's a QAM option hidden under choosing Cable as the source (and it's not even mentioned in the manual), but to use it you have to activate it (why in the world do I need to get some passcode off Westinghouse's Website?) and the website doesn't have the option to even enable QAM over Cable (only ATSC over the air). So I can't watch digital channels via cable until Westinghouse decides I'm allowed to? The website says \"For Digital Channels through cable, please refer to your user manual and the setup screens\", but neither the setup screens or the manual tell me anything about this. Doesn't make sense at all!Fortunately for me it's temporary (cable box will be replaced soon), but if you were planning on using this feature I have no idea how to make it happen.Overall a great TV for the price.

The negatives are way too numerous to keep up with.  I should have figured by the design of the cheap remote control that the TV was going to be a dud.  First off, the resolution on the TV is very pixilated, grainy, and choppy especially if you are streaming movies from Netflix or watching dvd, I have high band width and the picture on my Samsung Plasma is 100 time nicer with the same exact setup and bandwidth.  The next thing we have witnessed several times is that after an hour or so we just lose volume through the TV, I have only noticed this from watching over the air channels to date, I have setup an appointment for them to take this TV back.
