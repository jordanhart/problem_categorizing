{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Samsung Second Generation 4k UHD - I Am Weak - I Had To Buy", "Author": "Carter H \"1amazonreviewer@gmail . com\"", "ReviewID": "R2ZWUMDI69ELO0", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "This is the best picture quality of any TV I have had. It is a 4K TV and even though there isn't any 4K content yet without getting movie on a hard drive and paying out the nose. This Samsung upscales the content up and it looks pretty darn great. Noticeably sharper then others that I looked at. The sound is also very good. There are plenty of smart features and internet hookup without having any external devices like Roku, Apple TV. Upconverts any source inputted. Samsungs latest backlighting technology.I bought the TV for the picture quality not really for the 3D. Most of the smart features are just extra pluses.It does a decent job of upscaling the HD content, but remember it is trying to upscale from HD to near 4K and the information is just not there for it to do real 4K. It, for the lack of better terms, makes a guess on what 4K should be. That withstanding it does guess well, and will offer a better picture than standard HD, just not UHD so expect that. Samsung isn't talking about what the specs are for the up scaling at the time of this review.Pros:1. Excellent color and sharpness. Also controls to can easily adjust the picture to any way you wish (moe color saturation, less saturation, sharpness, brightness, etc) Lots of smart features I am still learning.2. Excellent sound upgrade from standard HD Samsungs. For the price it should have good sound huh.3. Watching Lord Of The Rings On This Will Make You Cry4. 3D works great and comes with four sets of glasses.Cons:1. Dialog box pops up telling you that you can use voice controls. This is very distracting and I don't need the a dialog box on the TV to pop up to tell me this. Its in the instructions booklet. It doesn't happen very often- but it is annoying. You can disable this but it takes some time to dig through the screens until you are there.2. Heavier than standard HD versions of Samsungs, like the 8000. Good info for those mounting on wall.3. No Content to justify early adopter purchase price.4. Friends watching Lord Of The Rings (Also crying picture is so good) begain plotting to take \"Precious\" from us.There is just nothing to watch right now and the prices of these 4K sets are going to drop at least another 500 just like when the HD sets came on the scene. Plus the 4k technology will most likely get better when they decide just how the content is going to be implemented. On the upside Samsung uses what they call a Hub or One Connect box so if content inputs get better you can just replace the hub box instead of kicking yourself that you have to get a new set.I tried the Netflix 4K streaming and it's a mixed bag at this stage. Some of the nature documentaries look like 4K and some look more like 1080P.The UHD dvd players are coming so if you have this Samsung you will be ready from day one. I think even the xbox is going to offer 4k content when connected. Does have a superior picture than non UHD tv's. Its just gonna cost ya a little more brother. I had to have it. I couldnt wait. My current tv died on me and I had to do something. The only thing I could rationalize, being addicted to great new technology, was to go into debt to feed my habit. I am so ashamed at my weakness.In all seriousness:My suggestion is if you must have the latest 4k tech then here it is. Much better than Sony especially with their no customer service. The LG's do look good, just not this good.UPDATE 4-25-2014Ok there has been a big controversy on whether this model comes with a one connect box or not. You get a different story everywhere. Found a Samsung training representative who spent two hours educating me on every 4k tv on earth and what was what. One Connect; 2013 version of this model had the external One Connect box. 2014 version of this model has internal One Connect with no external box. When One Connect technology is updated you can get the external box and it overrides the internal to keep everything cutting edge. He said samsung is supporting One Connect for a guaranteed four years to guard against your tv becoming obsolete. I asked him about the 1080p to 4k upscaling. He said yes it does a good job at kicking up standard HD better than Sony or LG, but if you want to see something great, get a 4K bluray player, then he drug me around to show what it could do. It was very impressive. He shared a story about the 9000 which requires an external One Connect box to opperate as all the technology is in the box and the tv is basically a monitor, said stores all over the place are misplacing the boxes when they move a tv and have all these dead big screens everywhere.This TV is a keeper.SPECIFICATIONS:Glossy screen, black bezel and cabinet, silver T-Shape standThe Tuner receives over-the-air HDTV broadcasts (Seperate HDTV antenna required)QAM cable TV tunerRVU-compatible (for DIRECTV) -- DIRECTV subscribers with the Genie Whole-Home HD DVR can watch live broadcast and stored content on this TV without an additional receiverUltra High Definition TV with 4K screen resolution (3840 x 2160 pixels)HEVC for compatibility with streamed 4K content from sources like Netflix\u00aeTV Displays 3D images when you wear Samsung's active 3D glasses (4 pairs of glasses are included)2D-to-3D conversion adds 3D-like depth to non-3D video sourcesLED edge backlight with Precision Black hardware-based local dimming and UHD Dimming software-based dimming for superb contrast and black levelsClear Motion Rate 1200 blur reduction 240Hz refresh rate plus backlight scanningUHD video upscaling seamlessly upconverts SD and HD contentInternet-ready Smart TVSupports up to 5.1-channel audio with streaming movie services like Netflix and Vudu(tm) (audio quality depends on your connection speed)Built-in Wi-Fi to link to a wireless networkQuad-core processor for seamless web browsing and app multitaskingQuad Screen splits the TV screen into four quadrants so you can watch live TV, video clips, and the web all at onceAllShare video and music streaming from a DLNA-compatible Windows PCMHL-compatible HDMI input for viewing photos/videos from a compatible smartphone on the TV's screen2-way screen mirroring -- send content wirelessly from device-to-TV or TV-to-device with compatible smartphones and tabletsBuilt-in stereo speakers (10 watts x 2 plus 20 watts for woofers)Comes with two remotes: a touchpad remote with built-in microphone for voice control, plus a standard illuminated button-based IR remote", "Date": "April 17, 2014"}, {"Title": "You get what you pay for!", "Author": "BROMER", "ReviewID": "R1LKTMFZ8Z5CL", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "After seeing this in person at the local Best Buy, I decided to take the plunge and bring home the 65\" UN65HU8550 on 04/16/14.  Setting up the TV was easy, although two people were needed to lift this beast onto the stand.  The setup menu was easy to navigate, and the system update only took 7 minutes over wifi.The picture has got to be the best I've seen!  I'm not an A/V diehard, but I know when a picture looks vibrant and I can spot the issues.  I ran my own personal non-scientific tests using Disney's Planes on a Sony BDP-S590 blu-ray player and the picture was fantastic.  The level of detail was second to none, and there was no motion blur to speak of.  During the scene where Dusty is flying in the thunderstorm at night, the black levels were the best I've seen on an LED tv--they looked like they would on a top-level plasma.  The picture showed no light bleed or clouding during the lightning strikes, and the detail stayed crisp throughout.  Test #1 passed with flying colors.I then tested the 3D with the previously mentioned blu-ray player using Star Trek: Into Darkness 3D.  The tv comes with four sets of active 3D glasses. Again, setup was a breeze as it literally took pressing one button to pair the glasses with the tv.  Watching Star Trek, I ran the scene where the Enterprise is battling with the Dreadnought in outer space.  Overall the 3D was impressive.  Some level of detail was lost on background objects in most scenes (as is expected when watching 3D), but the detail on objects that were the main focus of the scene were above & beyond better than I expected.  You could literally count the hairs on Captain Kirk's head, in 3D no less!  Again the black levels were fantastic and colors seem true to life.  4K was not tested as there is virtually no content out there yet.Pros: The picture quality is a huge plus on this TV.  Oddly enough, the embedded speakers weren't half bad for the short time I had them on (not too \"tinny\" with decent mids and highs).  Of course, if you're spending this much on a tv, you probably have a halfway decent sound system to run it through and won't use the speakers anyway (I know I won't be using them).Cons: The TV does not come with a One Connect box.  All the online literature makes it look like it has one, but what it is really saying is that it is compatible with the One Connect for upgrades in the future.  The owner's manual confirms this.  Also, there is no camera for the gesture control--it is also sold separately.  By no means are these deal breakers, just trying to clear up those items.Overall, if you spend the money on this thing, you'll be impressed.", "Date": "April 16, 2014"}, {"Title": "Awesome TV you will love it but set it up!", "Author": "FALCON", "ReviewID": "R3QQGWYDLWEBYL", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I am not affiliated with Samsung or CNET.[Side Note:  I believe Samsung should provide free 2014 One connect boxes to F9000 owners because of the H265 codec, Google's superior VP9 codec, and HDMI 2.0 as a gesture of good faith toward early adopters.]This review will help you get the most out of your HU8550.  I won't waste your time listing all the specs.I am posting here because some people badmouthed and down rated the Samsung F9000 because they did not know how to use it.  I do not want the same thing to happen to this excellent TV.  I have last year's top-of-the-line F9000 4K model which is virtually the exact same TV as this, released only 5 months earlier.  Only the Smart Hub software and HDMI ports changed.I cannot believe how absolutely amazing the picture is.  It's colors explode, it's blacks are black, it's whites are white, flesh tones are real, and all of it is super sharp.  With newscasts or interviews, people look like they're sitting right in front of you.  It's almost scarey. Aerial shots and night shots of cities will blow you away. You cannot ask for a better picture.  And that's not just my opinion, read all of the professional reviews.  Every single one of them love this TV.NOTICE: Do not worry about 4K content not being available.  This TV upscales. It has to because the screen is made of 3840 X 2160 pixels. Go to [....] and check the US news section. I quote it in the comments section.  The upscaling of Samsung's Quadmatic Picture Engine works wonders, especially with anything in HD (1080P).  It also works fine with SD material but not as well because upscaling works with the material it starts with.  That's what it scales up.  I can honestly tell you that I do not want a sharper picture than this.  You can see every facial feature including eyelashes.  Blu Rays and 4K YouTube's will make you cry.  Pause the picture anywhere, even get close to it, and be amazed.Any person giving this TV anything less than five stars reveals their own foolishness for not setting it up, or they got a weird factory defect.  You have to set it up(calibrate it for your room).  If you are a newbie to electronics you have three options.1.  Learn how to set it up and you'll love it.  It is very easy.(I will help you in this post).2.  If you're too lazy, don't buy a piece of high-quality electronic equipment like this.  You don't deserve it.3.  Pay someone to calibrate it for you.  Actually that's a waste of money because in 20 minutes you can easily do it yourself with this post.  You can make this TV look anyway you want it to look.  Which is why comparisons in stores are superfluous unless you make all settings equal between the TVs. Out of the box the picture looks disappointing , that's Samsung's fault, although most manufacturers do the same thing for the retail store lighting.  When I first turned on this TV it looked like a soap opera or documentary.  I knew this was not right.Because I researched the F9000 (same internals as Hu8550) I knew what to do.  The first thing to do is go to the System menu, scroll to the Eco-Solution Submenu, and turn OFF the accursed eco-saving feature and eco-sensor.CNET has evaluators that are among the best in the industry.  A professional named Katzmaier uses $30,000 worth of equipment to calibrate these TVs.  Don't know if I can post links here, so search for CNET's HDTV picture settings forum forUN65f9000 or HU8550-a bit early for this as of this date.  (The 55 inch versions take the same calibrations.)However, there's one problem with their settings.  They calibrate their TVs in a dark room.  Therefore their brightness levels are way too low.  They acknowledge this, but it is a necessary starting point and equalizer for the different models.  No problem, use Samsung's default settings for Movie and set Backlight to their setting(12).  It worked great with gamma at +1.  The first thing you want to do is set it to Movie mode, which is what CNET uses.  Play with other modes later.---------------------The settings I'm about to list are based on Katzmaier's from CNET(get them and print them out) with some tweaks of my own made by going between his and the Samsung defaults.  Do that, that's safe.  If you set your TV to these, you will love the picture.  If not, tweak it for yourself somewhere between his settings and the defaults.It is very easy, so don't freak out.  If you can turn your volume control up and down you can change your settings.  The settings have a combined effect, so do not just do one area.HOW TO SET A FANTASTIC PICTURE AND REMOVE MOTION BLURR:Picture menu - Use all Samsung's defaults for Movie mode with a slight color tweakmode: Movie - the most important change.backlight: 12 - CNET's setting of 7 is way too low unless you are in a really dark room.  We use lamps at my house.  Backlight is the main brightness controlcontrast: 95 -  pretty standard for most modesbrightness: 45 - leave this alonesharpness: 20 - CNET setting of 0 Is WAY too low, especially for a 4K TVcolor: 52 0r 53 - a slight tweak over 50 that will give you more of a richer plasma TV qualitytint: 50/50 - leave this aloneI discovered the real trick for getting the correct lighting level for your room is to work with gamma and backlight, not brightness.  Samsung's default is 45 for all modes, and it's right.Advanced Settings Click it for the submenudynamic contrast: offflesh tone: zeroRGB only mode: offcolor space: custom - there is a submenu for this below.White balance: see below.  Click it to get into it.10 P white balance: - you don't need to mess with this.Gamma: +1 --this is an important setting and affects the entire picture, not just contrast.Expert pattern: offmotion lighting: offblack enhancer: offColor Space SubmenuI recommend keeping everything at default rather than using the ones from CNET.  However, I do not like the cold (bluer)picture of LEDs as compared to plasma or my old Pioneer elite 98 which had the best picture ever in its day and even for today except for sharpness.  Therefore I change the blue setting to this:blue: red 2, green 2, blue 45. Not drastic changes over 0, 0, 50 but it's warmer and prettier.Leave yellow at the default, or change the yellow setting to have less blue than the CNET settingyellow: red 50, green 50, blue 6  (Katzmaier had blue at 14, that's too much)White Balance - use all of the Katzmaier's settings: 25, 24, 22, 23, 24, 26Picture Option Submenu -color tone: warm 2 - important, this also gets rid of the cold blue LED effectdigital clean view: offMPEG noise filter: offfilm mode: auto oneauto motion plus: custom.  Make sure you change it to custom, click it.Smart LED: highAuto Motion Plus Submenu.  Numerous sources recommend these to remove motion blur.blur reduction: 10judder reduction: 0  yes, zeroLED clear motion: - not much visible difference either way.  Leave it on if you increased backlight to the default.System Menu.  As already mentioned go to the eco-solution submenu and shut off energy-saving and eco-sensors.  They will knock your picture into dismal oblivion at will.Sound menu:  For a TV, the sound can be good, but the default sound is horribly muddy as are all of the choices except Clear Voice.  The high frequencies are weak, and you should never expect good bass from any TV.  Go into the Sound menu and set to Clear Voice if you sometimes watch without your stereo system.---------------------------GREAT INTERFACE FEATURES:This TV works great with Smart Hub and smart phones, tablets, or Blu Ray, especially for Samsung products.  Other Android and Apple products should be compatible, but I can't speak for them.  I am a Samsung Galaxy XX fan myself.You can wirelessly stream from TV to Phone or tablet with the Samsung Smart View app, and your phone functions as a remote.  It works!  However, get the app for your phone manufacturer.  Don't expect Samsung's app to work on a different phone.You can wirelessly stream from Phone/tablet to TV by setting your TV Source to Mirror, and your device to Mirror in your settings >connections, and allow the connection.  You do not need to register the TV and agree to Samsung's invasion of privacy policy.You can also wirelessly view pics, video.etc, from your phone on the TV by enabling the DLNA device connection on your phone and going into Smart Hub Picture/video section (up top, far right, go to the bottom and select all files, and enable the connection.  It's easy.You can also use a hardwire HDMI connection for any of the above but why bother.______________________Complaint Section1.  Samsung - Stop defeating your own purpose with the horrible original settings.  I want a free 2014 One connect box and it needs VP9 not just H265.2.  People do not want the ridiculous hand controls that only work half the time at best, or the worthless voice controls the get activated by the TV program you're watching.  Thanks for the great picture though, stick with what matters.3.  Your privacy policy stinks.  I want to be able to interface my devices without doing your lousy Samsung All Share/ now Samsung Link that makes me agree to privacy policies that promise you NO privacy, and sit a Samsung representative in your living room every time you watch the TV.  NO Thanks.*** In all fairness to Samsung, the Smart View app in the Android Play store (does let you wirelessly stream content from the TV to your device without registering.______________Why you should get this TV1.  Best picture of any TV on the market from the largest TV manufacturer on the market.  I sometimes pause the program just to look at it.2.  It is future proof.  Because it is 4K, the screen is capable of outstanding resolution for a long time to come.  There's another great benefit - the Evolution kit.  HOWEVER, this TV write up by Samsung and thus Amazon is unclear.It comes with the built in evolution Kit but NOT the One connect box.  To get that, you have to get the HU9000 model which costs more money, and has a useless curved screen.  However, the write up infers One-connect future upgrades.  This TV is One Connect READY according to Samsung.  My guess is that they will upgrade this unit and all 4K units with one, One-connect for all, but see below.3.  It really looks elegant.___________________What about this new 2014 8550 compared to last years 4K F9000?If you can save a pile of money, then hurry and get the F 9000 before they sell out.  Amazon's price and service are both good and you save around $500.  The picture, CPU, memory, everything will be the same as the F9000 which is only 5 months older, and clear motion rate is the same.  Its true.  HDTVvs.com has a comparison and the main difference is the smart hub software.  You can save $500.00 and get a 4K blu-Ray with the diff.EDIT AFTER PRICE DROP:  On the other hand, if the prices are the same, the decision is tougher, but you should probably go with the newer model even though it is almost the same.Back on the other hand, F9000 has two advantages.  The One-connect box is a separate unit that houses the CPU, memory, main board, firmware, and smart TV software.  This is better than the evolution kit in the HU8550. A true One connect box is still on the H9000, but it costs more.The One Connect box that separates from the screen itself is better because you get new connection ports, less heat build up for a longer lasting screen, and you have less cable clutter.  If you know anything about computers or electronics, you know that the CPU, memory, and motherboard generate the most heat and eventually cause the units to fail.  Mine is a few feet under the screen, you can touch it and feel the heat, although it is more of a high warm than hot.The One-connect box is a genius idea that Samsung should employ for all of its TVs, and so should every other manufacturer of high-end TVs.  The 8550 is \"One connect ready\" for future updates but for now its evolution kit is on the TV.  So it is not really a big deal either way.The second reason: The 8550 base is nowhere near as stable or as cool looking as the arch base on the F9000.Although the 8550 model does do 4 screens, this is not with 4 channels, but 4 different inputs.  Which isn't really needed.  Updates to Smart hub are superfluous compared to the F9000.Bottom line: Both TVs are spectacular and as soon as you get new one connect boxes, they will be the same.  Be sure to set it up right and anyone you show this TV to will pick up  their jaw off the floor. You will love the picture and the features.  You will also save big time over the HU9000 with its gimmick curved screen.Hope this helps you enjoy your TVBlessings", "Date": "April 22, 2014"}, {"Title": "Great for Blu Ray and 4K content, not so much sports", "Author": "matt kramer", "ReviewID": "R327LE4ZA93ETT", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I waited a few weeks to write this review b.c I wanted to be sure I had time to really appreciate the TV.  It is closer to 3.5 stars for me and my personal use.First of all, the TV makes Bluray content look fantastic.  The tv's built in upscaler does a great job.  4K content is out of this world good (netflix, house of cards).  It brings a whole new level of clarity to television that I did not think was possible.  Last night I was watching Pacific Rim on Bluray and it made my jaw drop!The built in apps are really fast and convenient.  If you are not using a separate audio source, you will struggle to get proper lip sync with the built in apps.  It gets close, but without a separate receiver it is slightly off.So far so good, right? Well, I am a huge sports viewer, and this is where this TV struggles.  I tried literally all of the settings possible and there is always a slight judder.  It is mostly noticeable when watching hockey, and it irks me just enough to totally ruin my viewing experience.  I previously owned a plasma, so I am use to a buttery smooth experience when watching live sports.  This set just cannot provide that judder free experience I am use to.I would highly recommend this TV to anyone, but if you do watch a lot of sports you will probably be better served with a plasma. I was hoping the 2014 sets would have all judder issues sorted out, but it still seems like the technology (LED) cannot handle the speed of live sports.This Samsung is very future proof (HEVC, HDMI 2.0, HDCP 2.2, and future one connect).  The design of the TV is beautiful with  minimal bezels and a classic stand.I did read reviews prior to buying the TV.  I know that plasma's have always been deemed better for sports, but I was hoping for something different.  Phenomenal TV, but still not for the avid sports viewer.", "Date": "May 6, 2014"}, {"Title": "HU8550 Vs HU9000", "Author": "Shopping Guru", "ReviewID": "R2O7CM640JGNX3", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "** I will be constantly updating this as i get more information**[Updated: Apr 30, 2014 1:04pm ]Here is some information I have collected from my personally odyssey into the complex world of Ultra HD (UHD)/ 4K and my extensive first hand research and analysis and experiences on differences on both the HU8550,HU9000 and other 4K/HDMI 2.0 stuff so you can see what the extra money is buying and find everything you need to make an informed decision. Personally IMHO the HU9000 is the better deal and TV.CALIBRATION PICTURE MODESThe only question i can't get an answer on is if either TV has the Cal Day and Cal Night picture modes in the service menu. If anyone who owns either model and knows for sure, please post ASAP. These should be in the regular picture mode settings with 2 additional user modes. At the very least they should have 2 user modes that can be renamed. I hope they can fix this with a firmware update. A high end TV should have user modes.PICTURE QUALITY IMPRESSIONS AND TESTINGI was startled when i read it was 120Hz but TV's nowdays use clear motion rate instead of Hz. Just another ridiculous term to make even the most tech savy consumer pull their hair out and run screaming. Samsung has taken this to a new art with their naming of direct or edgelit local dimming. The answer to your question is forget all that. I threw all the reference and torture test Blu-rays at it both 3D and non 3D on both the HU8550 and HU9000 with the TV in showroom mode and the HU9000 in normal home mode. Not once did i see any motion blur or haloing in either set. If i did not know beforehand that either set was edgelit and you told me afterwards that it was, i would think i was being punked. I typically walk away from such sets and go for direct lit full array local dimming sets. The picture quality on both was breath taking. I never thought that i would find a TV that would make me feel totally cool leaving my Kuro Elite 9G behind. I felt giddy and excited like when i first bought the Kuro. I started with the HU8550 first because i have always perceived the whole curved thing to be a dumb fad. But i tend to be a tenacious consumer and decided to do my due dilegence and just take a peak so as to satisfy my OCD. I am so glad i did as the curved screen is no gimmick. It adds a lot of depth and you really notice it on 3D animated movies. Also the colors and detail was amazing. The HU9000 has more local dimming zones than the HU8550 so maybe that factors in. My only concern was the glare on the curved screen but looking at other sets even the HU8550 it was the same but it could be an issue for some in specific scenarios . When i tested the HU9000 in home mode i thought it was less bright and detailed but that could be because it was not set up correctly. I personally am going with the curved. Let me tell you if you knew me, you would truly understand how hell has frozen over for me with this experience vetting both sets. I am in the freaking twilight zone. So i have to give kudos to the engineering geniuses that were able to pull this off. This is the very definition of making lemonade out of lemons. So now i wonder how magnificent the Panasonic AX900 with its full array direct lighting and its glorious 128 zones will peform. This is the ZT60 replacement and from what i have heard its killer as well. It releases in the fall and yes it supports 3D. They kept telling me the AX800 did not have it. Talk about poor corporate communication. Luckily for me i will get both the HU9000 and the Panasonic AX900 if i decide it is the right time. The upgradeability of the Samsung is the only reason why i am moving forward now. I always thought that Panasonic would be the one that came out with that innovation first. The very fact that i am even looking at a Samsung and that its edgelit has me shaking my head in profound disbelief. My wife and i watch a LOT of TV and have a none existant social life so for me it was worth paying for the best even if i have to wait forever. Both samsung models and the upgradeability has me deep diving in the perfectly colored and detailed samsung sea. The blacks are black and the whites white. I saw details and colors in Avatar that i did not even see in IMAX.HDMI 2.0 SPECHDMI 2.0, which is backwards compatible with earlier versions of the HDMI specifications, significantly increases bandwidth up to 18Gbps and adds key enhancements to support continuing market requirements for enhancing the consumer video and audio experience. New functionality includes:4K@50/60, (2160p), which is 4 times the clarity of 1080p/60 video resolution  * Up to 32 audio channels for a multi-dimensional immersive audio experience  * Up to 1536kHz audio sample frequency for the highest audio fidelity  * Simultaneous delivery of dual video streams to multiple users on the same screen  * Simultaneous delivery of multi-stream audio to multiple users (up to 4)  * Support for the wide angle theatrical 21:9 video aspect ratio  * Dynamic synchronization of video and audio streams  * CEC extensions provides expanded command and control of consumer electronics devices through a single control pointThe spec does state that current high speed can handle the new bandwidth but i called 20 different manufacturers and all of them confirmed their max was 4K@24Hz, some said maybe 4K@30Hz but was stretching it. None said 4K/60Hz and were not willing to go on the record that it did.HDCP 2.2 COPY PROTECTIONis only for 4K content. If the either device in the handshake detects no support it will automatically downgrade you to 1080P then like a champ your TV will probably upscale it, LOL.  So there are special apps for 4K meaning a 4K version and a regular version. It is one app on all devices as long as your device is running the most current version. The app checks to see if you have HDCP 2.2 if it detects it will offer you the 4K stream. if not it will give you the 1080 or lower stream dpending on what is offered and what your TV can handle resolution wise.HEVC H2.65is a Highly Efficient Video Coder/c for 4k contentUPGRADE KITSSamsung UHD Video Pack 1 (CY-SUC10SH/ZA $299) Pack 2 ETR Summer 20142014 One Connect Box Model #: [B]SEK-2500V model# has now changed to SEK-2500U/ZA[/B]: $399.99 (june release)2014 Evolution Kit Model #: SEK-2000/ZA: $249.99This change in model#'s explain why the Best Buy listings were removed.Samsung UHD Video Pack Redemption Form (Free Offer Valid 4/27 thru 6/30 for HU9000 series TV only).  10 to 12 weeks for delivery[...]HU9000 MANUAL[...]HU8550 MANUAL[...]HU8550- Only the ARC and MHL ports support HDMI 2.0/HDCP2.2/4K@24/30/60Hz/FPS.

This is no gimmick. Screen reflection looked like an issue but then comparing others it is the same. Both TV's look fantastic when in Showroom mode but i got to see the HU9000 in home mode and it seemed a little less bright and sharp but i think it was not set up right.I was going to buy the HU8550 and totally dismissed the curved version thinking it was a wast of time and gimmick. But doing my due diligence i thought i'd just check it out. OMG! It makes one hell of a difference and if you can't see it you must be blind. It is more noticeable on animated 3D BD. I decided i am hands down switching to the HU9000.REMOTESBoth TV's come with:Smart Touch remote control (BN59-01184A)IR  universal remote control (BN59-011798)SMART VIEW 2.0is a cross-platform multi-screen app that enables you to load the TV screen on an NFCcompatible device (cell phone, tablet, etc), share multimedia content between two devices, and control the TV remotelyDIMENSIONS/WEIGHT65\" Without StandHU9000: 57.1\" x 33.4\" x 4.4\"HU8550  57.1\" x 32.8\" x 1.4\"65\" With StandHU9000: 57.1\" x 35.1\" x 12.9\"HU8550  57.1\" x 34.4\" x 11.6\"65\" Product Weight  (with/without stand)HU9000  68.3 lb.

Onkyo has 2 coming out with HDMI 2.0 spec, the $499-suggested 5.2-channel TX-NR535 and $699 7.2-channel TX-NR636, which features HDMI 2.0 and HDCP 2.2. They become available in March and April and also Pioneer, Denon and Marantz have one releasing in the summer (june time frame).Onkyo's AccuEQ replaces Audyssey's MultEQ room correction which has me really worried that the next Integra models will do the same. Looks like only the TX-NR636 is using the QDEO processor (WTF at this price point) like the Integra not sure if this same chip model (might be a lower or cheaper version or Integra is getting to drop a coll higher end processor in the upcoming integra and this just a hand me down to their cousin. 4K/60Hz inputs, 4K/60Hz pasthrough output. No info if it supports HEVC H.265. 4k Upscaling and pass through, so a new receiver just for 4K/60Hz input and pass through. Right now only gamer's benefit and if broadcast and blu-ray decide to use 4k/60Hz otherwise useless. You don't need an HDMI 2.0 spec AVR/Pre-Pro now as there are no external sources for 4K yet. unless you have a gaming console, PC, 4K media player or the Nuvola NP-1 streaming player for $299 with the NVIDA Tegra 4 and Google Play support (you can play android games and PC ones).HDMI CABLESAnother thing worth mentioning is that if your external 4k device source uses 4K at 30Hz/fps or higher (or the cable connecting the ARC on both the TV/AVR) you will need to get new HDMI cables that support 18Gbps at minimum or higher (10.2 Gbps cables max out at 4K@24Hz some may claim 4K@30Hz as well but no way is it handling 4k/60Hz). Don't overpay, these cables are slowly showing up. Monoprice just added some redmere ones. If you are running the HDMI cable through a conduit try these cables: Monster HD1000 (connector size is around 0.75\"), Monoprice Redmere in wall rated cable not 18gbps (18 coming soon, connector size around 0.82\") and Cablesson Maestro 15gbps rated but they claim full hdmi 2.0 spec so i am assuming a typo n the rating but you will need to import this from the UK. The connector shells come off and can be put back on after running through conduit. Stay away from Rapidrun, great concept but it uses s-video like connectors and i can see those pins getting bent easily and it is pricey.HDMI EXTENDERS AND RUNNING CAT CABLEAs of now there no HDMI extenders not even HDBaseT that that can do anything above 4K@24Hz. There are only 2 that support ARC, Audio Control BVHD-20, $450 (not HDbaseT and uses 2 Cat 6) and Transformative Engineering HD-1($799) which is true HDBaseT with a Valens chip. Atlona also does not go above 4k@24Hz and does not support ARC. Transformative Engineering's HD-1 has 3 port Ethernet switch on both ends, has ARC, IR and RS232 as well as an optical audio port that rides on HDMI ARC for legacy equipment. However, it is very finicky with Samsung TV's as apparently Samsung does not confrom to standard HDMI protocols. Atlona, TE and Audio Control all have HDMI 2.0 Spec products in the works. As for Cat i suggest run 2 cat 6 or better. I'd go Cat 7 for future proofing. Make sure you research what connectors you buy as i bought cat 6 shielded cable and got two different types of Cat 6 connectors and boots and they don't fit the cable as it is too thick (24AWG) but the sites i bought them from said the connectors and boots would support cables sizes 23-28 AWG. You'd think that cat 6 shielded connectors and boots would fit cat 6 shielded cables right? If you are looking for an in wall rated optical cable Amazon sells a CL3 rated Blue Rigger one that seems to have gotten very positive reviews.MOUNTINGVesa Mount gate: 400mm x 400m for 55-65\" HU8550 and 9000. 4x M8(4mm x 14mm) screws . The 2014 mounts are not out yet but the Samsung kit is called ultraslim Wall Mount. You can monitor their mount page to see when they make them available. I did see this TV mounted with a standard Vesa mount though and the Oneconnect box rest nicely on top of the mount or can be secured to it via zip/cable ties should need that.[...]4K BLU-RAYDon't bother buying a 4K upscaling BD player as the TV will do that better for you. 4K blu-ray specs have not yet been finalized so it will be a while before we see true 4K movie players. Some studios are considering 4k@60Hz. Most likely the first \"4K\" players we will see will have HDMI 2.0/HDCP 2.2 ports and the smart apps will support 4k@60hz/HEVC H.265. Will probably have 4k/60Hz passthrough and 4K upscaling.4K CABLE/SATThere have been no announcements from Sat/Cable box makers on 4K devices but Tivo said they will be offering something down the road. I can see Sat TV moving quickly but not cable. Some channels and studios are also considering 4k@60Hz content. Xfinity will be bringing 4K content to the X1 platform but by then it might be the X2.GENERAL CURRENT 4K CONTENT SOURCESSamsung UHD Video Pack, Media players from Sony or universal ones, Youtube, Also Samsung and Xfinity have a deal to broadcast 4K content via the Xfinity Smart Hub app and the X1 platform will also be first to get 4K content. Samsung also has a collaboration with 20Th century Fox for content via the smart hub. So you see the trend the 4K content is going to be provided by in built TV apps and there will be some exclusive content partnerships like xfinity and samsung. Netflix, Amazon, M-Go, Comcast is going to leverage there position as owners of NBC Universal.

This morning it freezes as soon it turns on and then reboots itself after 20 seconds. Tried everything their online support suggested but no help. They need to send a technician to my house to fix. So frustrated!!!Update: Through sheer will power I was able to muscle my way into TV's settings menu and disable Smart Hub from auto starting and that fixed the issue. Press the \"Source\" key repetitively on the remote while the TV is booting up to try to prevent Smart Hub from starting up. You should then be able to access the TV menu to disable the Smart Hub auto-start setting. Amazon was quick to offer a replacement but Samsung's customer support was awful. Online chat support just wasted my time and then told me to submit a service request through their website. The service request website doesn't work with Google Chrome so I had to call their phone support which was not pleasant.Update 2: Decided to return the 55\" and upgrade to the 65\" and it's AMAZING! Huge difference! Do it if you can. Still experiencing software issues though. TV rebooted itself while scanning for TV channels in the \"Broadcasting\" -> \"Auto Program\" at about 80% of the scan.

Movies tend to look so realistic, they lose that \"film\" quality. I really feel like Ultra HD is going to have to change the way movies are shot.I only had one real problem with it. Netflix would not load out of the gate. I called Netflix who told me to call Samsung.

I have been very frustrated with the info available online, at stores, and with Samsung. I think I have it mostly figured out, so here goes:Samsung reps are clueless on Chat - they were telling me all kinds of wrong info (clearly poor scripts). \"The One Connect doesn't come with the TV, but you need one because the TV is just a monitor\" (it has no ports they said). They said \"I could buy the One Connect Box from the parts department\" (false). They said \"I would not be able to watch any 4K without the Box\" (false, it has the codec and HDMI 2.0). I pushed back and explained a few facts I was reading from their own website's specs. They finally started apologizing and taking back what they said about the \"missing ports\" and \"need for the box\".This model is a unique beast in their lineup for 2014. It isn't an 8500 or 9000, obviously because it's the 8550. It is so new that the reps don't know what it has or doesn't (I blame that on Product Marketing/Management teams). So, the 8550 comes with all the connections you need on the back (interesting that nowhere I've looked is there a picture of the back of this TV - including the full PDF owner's manual). In my 40+ years of audio/video experience, I have never come across this issue. I sold A/V equipment in my college days, I built my own home theater in Las Vegas, I had 13 TVs in that house, and I build my own PCs. I do heavy research for every purchase I make. Amazon is my #1 go to for 80% of my purchases. This TV is certainly a puzzle.I have seen this TV in person at Best Buy (55\" model). The picture is amazing; rich colors, black blacks, nice bezel, solid base!The One Connect or UDH Pack will be needed in the near future to support downloading/streaming of 4K content from the Samsung Store. The UHD pack that's out now for $299 has 5 movies and 2 documentaries. The second UHD pack will have different movies and possibly add support for the Samsung Store. The One Connect Box [edit, stopped in mid-thought] will add future features/functionality/technology when it arrives.  This is the best I can make of the information I've gathered so far.I will update the post after I receive the TV and experiment.UPDATE 5/23/14 - TV just arrived at my office.  Hard to just stare at the box - but fortunately leaving early today for the holiday weekend! I will add updates this weekend.UPDATE 5/23/14 PM - Streaming 4K \"House of Cards\" from Netflix right now, works perfectly.  TV is a little thicker than my non-4K Samsung - having all of the ports on the back of the TV instead of the One Connect Box probably adds to the thickness.  The extra Smart Remote is small and very convenient.  It takes a few minutes to get used to pointing the remote at the TV, but man it makes input so much easier than using the up/down/left/right buttons.  The Samsung Smart Apps work 100% better than my older Samsung.  The new quad-processor makes the apps run as fast as my computer.  They were a joke in the original smart TVs.UPDATE 5/23/14 Late PM - watching a Blu-Ray movie and 90 minutes in the picture went black.  The TV is dead.  I have unplugged all of the connections and power and let it rest.  It will turn on and show a blank backlit screen, but nothing displays - no menu, no smart hub, no TV, no video, nothing.  I now have an expensive paperweight.  Contacting Amazon ASAP.UPDATE 5/24/14 - Called Amazon and got some technical support.  They had me do almost everything I already tried last night, including holding a flashlight to the screen to see if I could make out the image.  The only new thing they had me try was holding the exit button for 10 seconds to reset the TV to factory settings.  No help.  The TV is on and responding to the remote, but the panel or something is just dead.  Sure they're sending me a new TV, but it won't arrive until June 2, 2014.  I'm not a happy camper at the moment.  I was hoping to write some decent review information, not talk about my dead TV issues.  It's uninstalled and back in the box.  Reinstalled my 40\" Samsung.UPDATE 5/26/14 - While I'm waiting for my replacement, I thought I'd post another observation.  Everywhere the product description states that you can watch \"whatever is on the TV screen\" on your mobile device using the Samsung App.  First of all there are three apps for the Samsung Smartview.  Threre is #1, then one for the iPad, then #2.  The only one that works with this TV is version #2.  All of the apps have horrible ratings.  I got the app to recognize the TV, but while watching Netflix or PS3 movie, the app says the current format is not supported for viewing.  So my question is:  'whatever' means what exactly?  I have a TiVo Stream which allows me to watch my TiVo on my iPad, so I know it's possible and pretty cool.  What's up with this feature Samsung?UPDATE 5/30/14 - Well, the new TV arrived early because I contacted the carrier and scheduled it for today (instead of Monday).  The new TV is installed and set up again.  Picture looks great, especially the 4K samples on Netflix.  I'm still working on all of the picture settings that need to be adjusted (blur, judder, contrast, clear motion, brightness, eco settings, etc.).  No point on anyone commenting on the picture unless you've done your homework online and made the recommended adjustments.  Yes, Samsung should ship them with the proper settings, but I guess some people like the hyper-real looking image??  Universal remote setting work OK, but can't get the PS3 to turn off/on (and yes I have the IR adapter for the PS3).  Hopefully this TV will last more than 90 mins like the first one.UPDATE 5/31/14 - Spent all night last night and all day today making adjustments and watching content.  Currently I think the settings are almost perfect.  The picture is amazing!  Enjoyed several Blu-ray movies last night.  Today I watched a lot of auto racing.  The Barbados RallyCross was the hit of the day,  This TV has no problem with fast motion (sports/racing).  Understand these cars go from 0 to 60 in two seconds!  I also watched drag racing.  There is zero blur and the images are crystal clear during the high speed motion.  I have the image fairly bright for regular TV and dimmer for movies.  Color is spot on - amazing reds, blues, greens, blacks, and whites.The small remote works very well.  The point and click makes input EXTREMELY easy compared to any other remote I've used.  I even had luck using the voice control, but it's control is limited.  This remote is also controlling my TiVo better than any other remote packed with a TV (my Harmony remotes do a lot more and have a keyboard, but those are aftermarket remotes).I'm not impressed with House of Cards, but the other four nature videos are amazing and a great way to show off your 4K.  I will buy the Samsung UHD pack soon and give updates on those 5 movies and 2 documentaries.

People that buy TV\u2019s this big and expensive are usually paying Tier 4 electricity rates, we don\u2019t need to be reminded of this each time we turn on our TV.

I did notice however that if I page down to Discover channel and select then go back it the guides stays on Discovery rather than default back to channel 1 SD content.Anynet+, the feature still defaults your receiver to switch over to TV/CD, instead of last input like CBL/SAT forces us to use Harmony remotes.  This makes no sense what so ever\u2026never has.  Panasonic has this feature working perfectly, not sure why Samsung has not fixed it, perhaps they feel everyone needs to default to the TV/CD input due to the Smart Hub or that no one has CBL/SAT.  Silly.The remote itself, has no light so you can\u2019t see any of the buttons at all at night rendering the remote useless at night/evenings.  Also when you press guide, it shows the Samsung TV guide instead of you providers guide from your CBL/SAT box.  Another reason you will never use the remote.  F8000 guide button showed your cable box guide and even has a DVR list button and lights\u2026looks like they went backwards on features for the mouse pointer they added.The remote app in the iTunes store will not connect to the TV.  (Network Connection Failed), it can see the TV but not connect.  TV never shows allow device pop up.Samsung has still not licensed DTS-HD and Dolby TrueHD.  Most people that spend 6k for a TV want lossless audio options and are pushing 7.1 or great sound not just 5.1, so basically big fail here as well.There is no verification that your content is being upscale.  If you press info, it only shows what the original input source is (by law).  I would be nice if when you press info it displayed both input and what it is currently being displayed at so you know the extra money you spent is working.There is no way to disable 4k up-scaling, many high end receivers have 4K up-scaling but without a disable option you can never use those.  You can only use the TV\u2019s built in up-scaling otherwise your processing the signal twice possible making it fuzzier.  So there is no way to test to see what up-scaler is better or worse.For a thin TV, they really failed with the location of the HDMI/ARC input, IR input, audio out input, ex-link, LAN input ,component/av in1 and av in2.

I noticed that the dialogue seemed unnatural with the built-in two speakers. I rewatched a short segment on a 5.1 setup and noticed how improved the dialogue sounded with a center channel. I then ordered the Vizio S5430W-C2 from Amazon to get a center channel. I noticed quite the improvement with the sound bar. The Dolby Digital icon lit up on the sound bar confirming that the TV was passing a center channel to the sound bar.I moved onto attempting to play 5.1 sound from other devices plugged into the TV via HDMI. I then discovered that the TV only advertises two channel stereo. The TV does not advertise Dolby Digital, DTS, 5.1 LPCM, or 7.1 LPCM which the sound bar advertises. This means that to get a center channel from other devices those devices need to be plugged into a HDMI switch which is plugged into the sound bar, and the input on the sound bar must be changed between HDMI for these devices and HDMI-ARC for the TV to get a center channel.The TV has no problem outputting DTS over HDMI-ARC when asked to play a MKV file with a DTS track over DLNA so that the TV will not passthrough Dolby Digital or DTS over HDMI is disappointing.The TV fails to turn off with a Sony BDP-S6200 player controlled via HDMI-CEC.  The TV turns off; the player turns off; the player turns back on, and then the TV turns back on. Both the TV and the player allow disabling power off over HDMI-CEC which suggests that different vendors don't interoperate well.RS232 control works out of the box.

I don't want a remote with a couple of buttons, touch pad, and hand motion sensors. I want to navigate with my thumb - not my arm. Then I found out the standard IR remote is also included for people like me. Ordered the HU8550 65 inch as soon as possible. Took a few hours to set up picture and color controls to my liking. For instance, out of the box red had a distinctive magenta tone. Brought up the red palette in Advanced and turned down the blue component of red.  Now let me say if you will be viewing standard def you won't be very happy like me. Currently, I am feeding in standard DirecTV until ALL of their channels are offered in high def. Therefore, most programs, sitcoms, etc. seem out of focus. Turning up the sharpness results in what I can only describe as crystallization in and around static objects such as channel logos and faces and objects that aren't moving. I can't seem to correct this. Also, from 25 feet away it looks just OK - a foot away and it looks like you're looking through 3 screen doors. If this is up converting to 4K I don't see it. Seems like degraded standard def.  Now, as far as viewing high def on this set - FANTASTIC! In particular I watched the youtube video labeled \"Costa Rica in 4K\". PERFECT! Freeze framing it and looking at the screen 5 inches away revealed a sharp, crisp, flawless high def photo. Then I downloaded many SBS (side by side) 3D videos off youtube to a thumb drive. Also viewed \"Diving in Thailand\" available with many others off the Samsung 3D Hub. All were \"in your face\" INCREDIBLE!  All in all, I'm pretty satisfied with this set but if you're only viewing standard def you would be better off with a much smaller set and a 40 foot viewing distance. As far as high def and 3D - quality simply cannot be improved upon by anyone.

All the marketing states the great picture quality... well not so! Here is why;In the past six weeks I have gone through three different TVs from a reseller ( StarPower of Dallas). The first I had was a Sony 1080p, which had to be returned due to imperfections with assembly of the LED/LCD panels. I then got a Toshiba 65\" 4K, which has an amazing picture (bright, crisp, no motion blur, white balance great, skin tone spot on, 3D with no eye strain), the only let down, their software in very buggy (to the point where the TV would freeze and the only way to reset it is unplug it!!). So finally after getting tired of driving back to the store repeatedly , I decided , you can't go wrong with Samsung , right! WRONG!!This TV has great features, by far the best. However, the number one thing that a TV MUST deliver on is..... the PICTURE QUALITY !  They did not deliver. For the price we pay for this TV, it should. There is a lot of motion blur (fast movements get distorted ), jerkiness when watching over the air or a cable feed from the coax input, skin tones washed out, white balance not great, there is a blue'ish tint to the screen, the clearest picture and 3D cannot compared to the Toshiba 65 4K.I think that Samsung relies on the fact that most people that but technology are not tech savvy. Well, sorry Samsung... I am very, very tech savvy !!  I work in the technology sector. So here is my input as what is wrong ....... picture rendering/upscaling needs to be improve by either fixing your firmware and/or RAM, BUS speed, CPU is not fast enough to process the information at the correct frame rates.  I have done some researched and spoken to store reps and TV service people all said \" 4K is still new and no company is setup to broadcast 4K, therefore, 1080 is still the standard, so if they can deliver 1080, that's it\". Well , for me that is not good enough, I bought a 4K TV and want a 4K picture! Another thing.... in the Samsung specs for this TV from the Samsung website( at the time I bought it), they stated there was 4 HDMI 2.0 ports, I am now being told that this is only 2 ports. It was also stated from a Samsung service tech, that F9000 series does not have the issues this model does. With researching the specs of the F9000 it has quad-core PLUS ( the PLUS is the difference, whatever that means.)I hope that I did not pay this kinda money for a TV that Samsung can't fix properly.

Pope \"EP\"", "ReviewID": "RSEI9D056GAHL", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "i am thinking about getting this TV and called Samsung with a VERY simple question. What a bunch of complete idiots! First they couldn't find the model number in their database to look up the scripted answers. Once they did put me on hold and called in their \"experts\" to figure out what a TV was and what the model number meant they answered my question by reading back to me exactly what I had already told them was in the manual which I downloaded from the Samsung website. It terrifies me to think of buying this expensive TV set and then having to deal with these same idiots to resolve any serious problem. I have liked the Samsung products I have purchased but their customer service is giving Ma Bell a run for their money. Time to look at what Sony and others offer and to test out their customer support.===Further info:So, given my negative experiences with Samsung customer service as reflected in my prior notes why did I decide to take a risk and get this TV anyway?Positives:-It has H.265. The prior model did not. This is important for things such as streaming 4K content from providers such as Netflix. It will probably become the dominant 4K codec. Suggestion: Do not buy a set that doesn't support H.265 as it will severely limit your ability to watch various 4k sources in the future. On the support side: sometimes it takes some digging to find out if that codec is supported. You may even have to resort to reading the user manual!-One Connect makes for a neat installation and provides for an opportunity for Samsung to do pretty major technology upgrades without having to replace the entire television.*These first two, especially the One Connect neat setup and upgradeability, were really the ones that drove me to try this set as opposed to the Sharp Aguos.-I spent a lot of time watching this set both with 4K content and upscaled BluRay and is is very sharp and the color gamut is much better than an HD TV. The native 4K content is simply amazing. (This is called \"Showrooming\" some of you will find that appallingly evil and some will find it OK. You make your own choices as to how you evaluate products).-The black levels were great. This is due to a very well done local dimming.-If it turns out the TV is a disappointment I have 30 days to return it to Amazon for a full refund so in that sense it is a relatively safe purchase.-It has HDMI 2.0 inputs. This is another must have. Don't buy a set that doesn't have HDMI 2.0 as it will also limit your ability to use some 4k sources.Negatives-My experience indicates that Samsung customer service stinks. This is supported by comments on AVSForum and by other Samsung customers. Awhile back I worked for a computer company whose name begins with \"A\". It was often said about them \"I love their products but hate the company\". The \"A\" company has  learned a lot about supporting their customers better so maybe the \"S\" one will also someday.-An offset to Samsung's horrible customer service is Amazon's exemplary customer service so worst case if Samsung drops the ball Amazon will pick it up.-Putting a lot of trust in Samsung to keep the One Connect up to date. Of course the same issue is there with all TVs that are not modular.-It does not have V9 (Google's open source codec) so it won't be able to play content with that encoding. So far not a big issue since there is very little content with that encoding and mostly it is also available in H.265. If V9 becomes important presumably Samsung will release an updated One Connect box.-Nowadays 4 HDMI inputs seems a bit limited but all sets share this issue. (add them up: Satellite or cable box, XBOX, Sony PS3 or 4, Apple TV. All ports are now filled so adding a Roku, Amazon Fire TV another game set such as WiiU means HDMI switches) I assume this is because some chip manufacturer makes a 4-in HDMI chip.Neutrals:-Price. All the 4K sets in this class and size pretty much cost the same.-I did not watch upscaled DVDs so will save any comments on those after I have used the set for awhile.-Almost all the 4k panels are manufactured by only three companies: Innolux, AUO and Samsung. If you don't include the low end \"cheap\" 4k TVs coming out then basically all panels are made by one of those three companies.Full Disclosure:-I DO NOT work for Samsung or any other TV manufacturer. I did work for Amazon for 12 \u00bd years so that was a major factor in driving me to buy from Amazon instead of other suppliers. The extra 2% discount and the Smile Amazon charitable contribution helped influence this decision also.I will follow up with further comments once I have had the set up and running for awhile.I got the set on April 25th. \"White glove\" was to drop it in the garage and say \"bye\". Anyway, it was easy to set up and was up and running (after a 30 minute download of a software update). Did I solve the wall mount question: Yes. Samsung never was able to help so I called the manufacturer of the wall mount and they knew all about what was needed and it was all included with their mount (OmniMount OS120FM Full Motion TV Mount for 42-Inch to 70-Inch TVs).The picture is wonderful, as are all high end UHD sets. Every one who has seen it is amazed at the quality. Very rich colors, great black level and no discernible pixels. There is some 4K content available on Netflix to show off the TV. The UI is OK but a bit slow at times. The One Connect box IS NOT INCLUDED! Since this was one of the main reasons I got this over the Elite set I am very disappointed. Apparently the One Connect box is not even available for the set at this time. Would I buy this again? No. I would get the better brand.
