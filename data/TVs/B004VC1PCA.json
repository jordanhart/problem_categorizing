I saw a video of it online from the CES 2010 and I fell in love. The picture is OUTSTANDING - to this day I have not seen another LED tv that compares.  The top plasmas of course have an equal or even better picture.  The touchscreen, iphone like remote is cool looking but not very functional - you have to charge it every couple hours and a touchscreen period is not very functional for a tv remote.  The smart tv functions are pretty cool but also somewhat cumbersome to actually use on a regular basis - they load pretty slow and typing via the remote is very annoying.  The 3D picture is awesome, especially via blue-rays, very little cross talk or eyestrain, just as good as the theatre in my opinion.  Gaming is also awesome on this tv.  I purchased this tv for $3200 from BrandsMart USA, which included 2 pairs of 3d glasses and a Samsung 3d Blueray player.  Everything on this tv is metal except for the swivel which I believe is solid glass.  Thinner than a pencil, very slick looking from the side.  One knock against this tv is that occasionally you can see uneven lighting around the edges, but it is barely noticeable in most lighting conditions.  Even 2 years later after purchasing everybody that sees my tv is very impressed.  My friend has the Samsung 55\" 7000 series from 2010, and I must admit the picture on his tv is identical, and that tv was nearly $1500 cheaper.  If you are interested in this tv, I would not pay more than $2500-$3000, as it is a 2010 model and technology has improved, with the nearly borderless Samsungs available now, with slightly better smart tv functionality.", "Date": "June 2, 2012"}, {"Title": "God bless tv.?", "Author": "harveys gomez", "ReviewID": "R19T2EQKPZBGKJ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I love this tv it's one of the beautiful tv I ever bought on the net..

In March 2012, it developed horizontal lines on left of screen.  Samsung tech and customer service is THE WORST.  Tech gave me terrible information and by the time I finally scheduled a repair, it was two years since the original purchase.  Repair requires replacement of the panel, which costs $1,100. WIth labor, its $1,600+.  After repeated chats with Samsung, they refuse to assist in covering any of the costs.  Usually they will cover parts in the second year (the year after the one year warranty.  But even though my problems began in under that two year mark, I did not talk to customer service (not tech) until past that benchmark.  It is absolutely incredible.  I have a tv that has lines on the left side of the screen for TWO hours when I turn it on.  DO NOT BUY FROM SAMSUNG.  Thats my new mission, to make sure everyone I know and come in contact with knows what a horrible company they are and that purchasing from them is a huge and costly risk!!! DON'T BUY FROM SAMSUNG!!!!", "Date": "November 1, 2012"}, {"Title": "UN55C9000 horizontal line problem", "Author": "Eric Maly", "ReviewID": "R3V5K6FFSP8RCZ", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "Bought this TV within 2 years developed left side horizontal line problems.Do not buy this TV, watching it will cost you $100 dollars a day untilyou buy a replacement,  great design but problems with reliability.ALSO DROPS WIRELESS CONNECTION FOR 3D viewing.", "Date": "September 24, 2013"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "$6,999.99", "Features": "TV, Stand, Remote, Cables, Manual, 3D Glasses (qty. 2), HDMI Cable (qty. 1)\n1080p Full HD\nMega Dynamic Contrast Ratio\nAuto Motion Plus 240Hz Clear Motion Rate\nUltra Slim Design (0.31\" deep)", "Name": "Samsung Factory 55\" UN55C9000 240Hz 1080p 3D LED HDTV", "ImgURL": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/215t%2BlzPRWL.jpg", "ProductID": "B004VC1PCA"}}
