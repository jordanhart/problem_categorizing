Sony always seemed to be the more expensive product, then it went on sale.  13,999 was the sale.  after having to buy the necessary stand for 200, the sale price kind of vanished.  Keep in mind that you will need some sort of stand for this unit as it sits too low for good viewing angle without it.  The picture is great.  As most people say, unless you have a good cable signal, the flaws will be very evident.  But I bought this for movies.  DVD's look awesome!!  I only wish it was widescreen as most all dvd's come in 16:9 format.  I know, why did I buy a 4:6 aspect then?  Well, I don't like how if you are watching normal tv and the picture is cut down.  I would definitely recommend this tv to others, but I would warn people to weigh their priorities.", "Date": "October 22, 2003"}, {"Title": "Sony Projection", "Author": "G.
