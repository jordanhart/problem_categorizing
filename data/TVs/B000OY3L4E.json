{"Reviews": [{"Title": "GREAT VALUE FOR FIRST TIME HDTV BUYERS", "Author": "Possum-Bread", "ReviewID": "RWXBTTUOLQ7I2", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "This Olevia 232T 32 LCD HDTV is my first HDTV.  I purchased it to replace my old faithful Apex 32\" TV, which became obsolete the day after I bought it.  The Olevia is great, in fact, it's almost perfect.  And the price of $540.00 was easier to live with than the $1,000 plus price tags on many models.The sound system is good, but it's not like a home theatre system.  Don't get me wrong.  Compared to my old TV it's incredible.  But I heard some awesome sound systems on the more expensive HDTV model's.  I knew what to expect when I bought it, so I'm not complaining.  But if you want super sound you better expect to pay a higher price.Setting up the Olevia was a little difficult, and I had to ask for help.  The manual is only on a CD-ROM, there is no paper manual.  Testing the different input jacks was a little annoying because you can't move up and down at will.  You have to go through all the steps before you can see how the picture looks.  The HDTV channels look fantastic - clear and detailed.  The regular (Non-HDTV) channels look alright.  HDTV blows my old Apex TV away.  One more thing - the remote control.  My cable provider's remote can't recognize the codes for the Olevia, so I have to use two remotes: one to change channels and one to adjust volume.  I think that may be a cable provider problem with many HDTV models, so I don't fault Olevia.I give the Olevia 232T 32 LCD HDTV 4 stars instead of 5 because of the set-up difficulty and the sound system.  Overall it is a great value and I recommend it to first time HDTV buyers.", "Date": "July 29, 2008"}, {"Title": "Inexpensive, entry level LCD with good picture quality", "Author": "Bjorn Akselsen", "ReviewID": "RI665MGWVBLOP", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "If you're considering this tv, you're probably like me; you've looked for months, obsessed about price, performance, and in the end, unwilling to spend  $1000 for a a better known brand. To complicate matters, I don't even have high def cable, so the real gains in upgrading from my 27 inch Sony CRT were always in question.I won't bore you with too many details, but I found that the picture quality was on par with many of the higher priced alternatives. In fact, I saw no difference between a couple of higher end products and this one.That's the good news. The downside is that the sound is inferior. It sounds weak, \"tinny\" and is in sharp contrast to the picture. I have tried a work around, hooking up my 2.1 speaker (sub woofer + 2 speakers) and it does sound better, though I'm still not happy with it.All in all, a decent tv, especially picture, though the sound will always irritate me. The real rating should be between 3 and 4.", "Date": "August 19, 2007"}, {"Title": "Great picture while it lasted", "Author": "A. Albert", "ReviewID": "RX82JCNUHKZXS", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I purchased this TV for use primarily for use with a PS3 and was mostly pleased.  Nice picture, intuitive displays, effective remote, nice input availability, etc.Unfortunately, after a few months it began to smoke and let out a strong smell of burning plastic.  Fortunately, it was still within the allowed return period.  I am not sure whether or not Olevia brand televisions frequently require repair so early, but personally would not risk buying another Olevia TV without an extended warranty.", "Date": "November 3, 2007"}, {"Title": "Great TV for the money", "Author": "P. Romero", "ReviewID": "RB1ZVRTOKGPYI", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "This is my first HDTV, i bought it to replace my 27\" CRT tv. I've owned the TV for a week now.  The TV is almost perfect, but I have a couple of issues with it. A lot of people have been complaining about the speakers, I think they are alright, not the best but they do the job. Setting up was a little hard to do, it honestly took me like 3 hours to get it set up and plugged in correctly. The manual is only on a CDROM that is included with the TV, there is no paper manual. Also, I wish the TV had a few more inputs, it really just has the bare minimum. Changing through the different inputs is a little annoying because you cant move up and down at will, you have to go through all the inputs to get to the one you want.What took me so long to set up was testing out the different input settings to see what gave me the best image. This is my final setting: Time Warner Cable through HDMI; Xbox 360 through component; Gamecube through composite; DVD player through S-video.  You really have to mess around with all settings for all your components AND the tv to get the best picture possible. You cant just plug it in and expect to get the best picture right away. The HD channels look amazing, the regular channels look alright. 360 looks out of this world, DVD player looks pretty good, Gamecube is alright, looked a lot better on my old 27\" TV.I give the TV a 4 out of 5 because it was a little hard to set up and the speakers aren't the best, and the remote is pretty flimsy. Also, Time Warner's remote wont recognize the codes for the TV, so I have to use both remotes.  Still, pretty good TV overall.", "Date": "September 1, 2007"}, {"Title": "Great T.V. /SOund Problem Fixed (sorta)", "Author": "R. Clarke", "ReviewID": "R2MNIJFWHZYKSW", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Ok, I bought this t.v. yesterday, got home, set it up, and it was perfect. Then while I was messing with the settings, the speakers started to hum. A really low buzz. I noticed this in many reviews, about the speaker noise. So I called tech support (very helpful).  The rep had me go to the lighting settings and set it to \"bright room\". Bam, no more hum.I know it's a B.S. fix, but I know many people will have this problem, and start going crazy like I did.Ok, the review.Picture - Outstanding (just came from having a 480i)Sound - Hahaha. Really good now!Connections - One of everything. Could have more, but It works for me.Menu - Kinda hard to master.I give it 4 stars due to the sound problem. Hopefully a Firmware update will fix this.Thanks", "Date": "February 1, 2008"}, {"Title": "Great product", "Author": "RaeAnne Forrest \"freyaskitten\"", "ReviewID": "R2PDEO4P5Y6S5F", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I just purchased this TV over the weekend, and I love it.  The viewing angles are very wide.  Sound is good, and it gives you the option to change the balance of sound as well as the bass/treble, which I love!  I saw this TV in the store next to the Sony Bravia, and while the Bravia had better color depth, the definition on the Olevia was sharper and the picture more detailed.  I'm very happy with my first HDTV purchase and think the Olevia is a great choice for someone looking for a moderately priced TV.", "Date": "April 2, 2008"}, {"Title": "Great HDTV for the price!", "Author": "L. Fisher", "ReviewID": "R1VN912WQDCSZ9", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I purchased this tv the other day and really like it alot.  The picture is nice and the sound is good too.  If you subscribe to an HDTV package with your cable or satellite service you'll be amazed at how clear and crisp the picture is.  The only negative thing is the initial setup can be alittle tricky for newcomers to figure out.  I already have 2 Olevia's so it wasn't hard for me.  Because Olevia is kinda a new brand, you'll probably have to use 2 remote controls.  I use my Olevia to turn it on and off and the volume button.  I use the Direct TV remote for everything else.  It's not really a big deal though.  If you want a good HDTV, and don't want to spend the big bucks for the name brands that you've heard of, I definitely would get an Olevia.  I've now got 3 of them and love them!", "Date": "December 23, 2007"}, {"Title": "232T Great Value", "Author": "DWF7303", "ReviewID": "R6EP2F64EVROD", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Great TV for Price (sub $600). Bought it for my bedroom as I have a Samsung 1080P in the living room. Does the job...amazing thing is that this TV looks better with std def channels than my 1080P.
