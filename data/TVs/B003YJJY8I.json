Happy with the hitachi's  picture and sound and it serves faithfully as a back-up display in a theater room.  Bigger brighter and obviously higher rez, it much better than my 9\" audio vox and 7.5\" artec I attempted in that location previously.  Only beef is the inability to remove unused inputs from the internal menu, five total but Im only using two so changing inputs results in more button presses.  I wont be using the internal tuner so cant comment on its performance.  I recommend this tv until 1080p is reasonably priced and available in this size...", "Date": "May 19, 2011"}, {"Title": "Excellent Value", "Author": "S. C.

Great picture. Can't help but contrast this with the 19\" Sony TV I personally imported on a trip back from Japan in 1983, a steal then at $400.

This shines on all fronts.It's small and lightweight, easily transportable to a friend's house for a night of gaming. It's so light, I just sat it on top of a cardboard box for a stand and it was perfectly fine.If you do run a computer through it, from VGA or HDMI, it works best at 1366x768. Xbox 360 sees it as 720p, and with the Xbox running it at the 720p resolution looks just fine. I got some anomalies in the picture when I tried running the Xbox at 1366x768, even though this seems to be the resolution the PC works best at.The tuner works alright, I plugged a little passive antenna into it, and it picks up all of the local stations with the expected digital quality.The controls on the front can be a little weird. Sometimes they're non-responsive unless you drag your finger across them. Not a big deal really, the remote works perfectly.The sound leaves a lot to be desired for, considering the thing has basically two laptop speakers facing downwards. It gets you by in a pinch, but I'd highly recommend you plug your headphones into the headphone hole on the left side.Aside from the sound, I really can't complain about this little TV. It works great, looks great, and the price is cheap. If all you need is a little TV that can take a variety of inputs, this is it.", "Date": "January 23, 2013"}, {"Title": "Good price", "Author": "hammy46", "ReviewID": "RWAM4QO4W6Y6P", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I like it for the size and price picture quality is good and the sound is fine so this is my rating .", "Date": "December 11, 2012"}, {"Title": "Right size TV", "Author": "Will R", "ReviewID": "R2N9IK92FSNWEX", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Nice tv.

In the back of the TV had two tv model labels when I take one of the labels had one below with another model tv. I find this model online and just said it was refurbished.Do not trust this seller (STL PRO, Inc.), he says that the tv is brand new and sealed box, false. Tv is used or refurbished.
