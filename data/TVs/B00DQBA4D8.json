{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Good Audio and Video in a Retro Design", "Author": "Buddy S", "ReviewID": "RIP8N5RVAZ09N", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "UPDATE 4/27/14:  I reported when I originally reviewed this TV in December 2013, that I had a problem getting good quality video.  I encountered this problem even after fiddling for some time with the adjustments on the Menu page dealing with \"Picture\" settings.  I read a recently posted customer review by an author who had a similar problem with the video quality, but he advised that he was able to improve the video quality by making adjustments on the Menu page under the \"Setup\" heading.  I then went into the \"Setup\" menu page and turned \"Noise Reduction\" and DLC (dynamic luminance control) to \"Off.\"  Under the factory default settings, Noise Reduction had been set to \"Middle\" and DLC was turned \"On.\"  After making these adjustments, much to my surprise the video quality improved from \"fair\" to \"good.\"  It is not at all clear to me why Seiki chose to put these two controls that affect video on the \"Setup\" menu page, rather than on the \"Picture\" menu page, especially when it may not be entirely obvious to a lay person that these settings affect video and not something else.  In any event, I have increased my rating on this TV from 3 to 4 stars.I also note that the current sales price for this TV ($150) is about 25% lower than the price when my first review was posted.  But even with the improvement in video quality and the lower price, this TV still has several negatives: it lacks a headphone jack, takes up a large amount of space for a 22\" TV and the screen is fixed in the cabinet at a slight upward tilting angle.  However, if these are not a serious problem for you and you find the retro design appealing, this TV at the current price may be an excellent choice.  My original review follows below:  *  *  *  *This TV has a LED 1080p flat panel built into a relatively large retro designed cabinet.  The cabinet is made of a hard plastic in an attention grabbing red; the color is apparently meant to emphasize the retro design.  The cabinet rests on three legs, which are attached to the cabinet with screws during set-up.  There are five controls on the front - a large On/Off switch in the center, and one each for channel up, channel down, menu, and source (to change the input displayed.)  There is a volume control dial on the right side of the cabinet.  Once the power switch is turned on, however, there is really no need to use any of these controls, since the TV's remote controls all of these functions and more.The back of the TV has a large array of connections for a small screen TV: there are a total of three HDMI inputs, a cable/antenna input, a USB port which can play compatible audio and photo files (but not video), VGA and PC audio inputs, one component input, one AV input, a digital optical output and an AUX IN to connect a MP3 player or smart-phone to play music through the TV.  When attempting to play MP3 files through the USB port, I found that the files would play only if they were not in a folder - the TV was unable to recognize and read files in folders.  Unfortunately, there is no headphone jack, which seems to be a glaring omission, since one of the promoted uses for this item in the product description is in a college dorm.The TV screen is fixed in the cabinet at a slight angle tilting upward; there is no adjustment to change the viewing angle.  The cabinet houses 2.1 channel audio components, including what is advertised as a 20 watt sub-woofer.  I connected an indoor antenna to this TV and, after a quick scan, it picked up about 18 over the air local TV stations, the same number of stations other TVs in my home receive.The audio produced was good considering the size of this appliance -- much better than that produced by other flat panel sets in my home.  My problem with this TV performance wise is with the video quality.  My primary point of reference is with a 24 inch Vizio 1080p LED TV VIZIO E-Series E241i-A1 24-Inch 1080p 60Hz LED Smart HDTV (tilted base) and I compared the video produced by these two sets when they were sitting side by side.  I thought the video produced by this Seiki TV was just fair; the display looked somewhat fuzzy and lacked the detail and crispness of the Vizio display, although this Seiko did produce very accurate skin colors.  I got these results only after spending considerable time tweaking the video adjustments on the Seiki.Whether the retro design and appearance of this TV is a plus is a matter of personal taste, but there are obviously limited locations where this appliance is going to fit in with the d\u00e9cor.  On the positive side, this small screen TV offers a large number of connections (including three HDMIs) and good audio.  Unfortunately, the video quality is not as good as that on other HDTVs in my home.  Also, while the price point for this TV is about the same as my 24\" Vizio, the Vizio screen is two inches larger and, unlike this Seiki, is a \"Smart\" TV with wireless Apps.  If you like the retro design and good audio is more important to you than good video, then by all means consider this Seiki TV.", "Date": "December 26, 2013"}, {"Title": "Surprisingly good, even for gaming. Playstation 2 users rejoice!", "Author": "William Grose \"Tzu Crazy\"", "ReviewID": "R10M9JYKC8GX2J", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "First off, this TV is hilarious. I mean really. It has a giant volume dial on the right-hand side. That, to me, is fabulous.Thankfully, the features of this TV go beyond the aesthetic retro amusement. First, it comes with a regular remote control (red on the backside - but sadly not red on the button side). With the remote you can put the TV in standby, change picture modes, change input, volume etc etc. So this is a PROPER TV, not some retro TV with retro controls you have to fiddle with manually on the TV itself.This is a full 1080p HDTV, so 1920x1080, which is great on a TV this size. Good pixel density for computer work, even. You can easily use with with your laptop as a computer display.Some surprising things I wasn't expecting include a decent sound system (with a built-in subwoofer). Sure it's not going to replace your home theater setup, but at least the thick retro casing was put to good use to actually improve the sound that is often far more tinny-sounding on regular LCD TVs.Also, it has a component input for some older devices, including my (no-longer abandoned!) Playstation 2. What's really nice about the TV is it does still let you change the aspect ratio from widescreen 16:9 to 4:3, so for older game systems like the Playstation 2 you don't need to deal with the image stretched across the whole screen. Even more impressive is input lag is excellent. I was able to play Shadow Hearts and Dance Dance Revolution on PS2 with excellent response times. I imagine this is mostly to do with the fast TN panel inside the TV.The downside of the TN panel is not especially amazing contrast (it's \"OK\"), and color reproduction isn't anything to write home about. Some tinkering with the picture settings does help greatly with both color and black levels, though.But let's face it... If you're buying something like this you're not exactly going to care if the blacks aren't as milky as that 60\" Panasonic plasma, right?Overall, this is a very solid TV. It looks great, build quality is surprisingly decent, the array of inputs is ALMOST excellent (no headphone jack is unfortunate), and it definitely is an eye-catcher.4 stars out of 5.", "Date": "January 6, 2014"}, {"Title": "Well, it's CUTE!", "Author": "xkydivr", "ReviewID": "R2SMIDR4OBTRN7", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "Form:The TV has a red-Formica-chrome  look of the fifties.  I have a black and white kitchen with red accents and I thought the TV would fit right in but ,in actuality , the footprint of the TV is really too big  and looks sort of clunky and the silver plastic legs look a little tacky. There is a hand-hold in the top to make moving it easier.Function:I had never heard of the Seiki brand. I guess I'm a Sony, LG, Samsung snob when it comes to electronics.  The TV was easy to set up ,with on-screen directions ,and the picture really isn't that bad. It just doesn't seem that good for 1080p.  Because of the fixed angle of the screen the off-axis viewing isn't very good.  It has a plethora of connections but no headset connection.  The Yamaha sub-woofer gives better than normal sound for a small set.  Save your order number and Amazon offers thirty days phone support setting up your TV.Bottom line:If you're looking for a decorating fashion statement, conversation piece this might be the TV for you. If you're looking for a small TV (with headset connection) for your kitchen ,kids room or dorm room  you  might want to keep looking.note: After re-reading this review I can see I didn't add much helpful information for the TV but everything has been so competently and completely covered I don't know what I could have added.  It would have been helpful it there was a back view of the TV on the product page, showing all the connections, but I'm here to review the TV not the advertising method.", "Date": "December 27, 2013"}, {"Title": "Sleek, red, retro looking 22\" HDTV/Monitor for under $200", "Author": "Dennis A. Amith (kndy)", "ReviewID": "R169BOKN8NTT3V", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "For today's review, I take a look at Seiki Digital's SE22FR01 22-inch 1080p 60HZ LED HDTV.For those not familiar with Seiki Digital, the Diamond Car, California-based television manufacturer owned by Chinese-based Tsinghua Tongfang Company.Seiki Digital is best known for affordable, low cost HDTV and 4K Ultra HD TV's and stands by their quality.And one of their televisions that are catching attention is their retro design LED TV.I.  What's in the Box:Inside you will find the Seiki Digital red LED TV, three aluminum stands and six screws to connect the stands to the television (you will need a Phillips screwdriver), a remote control and two AA batteries.II.  What to expect to see on the television:Front panel features a source, menu, channels button, off and on dial (turn to right to on in order to use remote, otherwise if off, you need to manually turn it back on) and on the right side is a volume dial.On the back, you will see an Digital CoAx connector, VGA (15 pin, D-Sub), RCA and component inputs (Y, Cb, Cr/Y, Pb, Pr), three HDMI inputsRefresh Rate is 60Hz (not 120 or 240 but that's not a deal beaker as it is a 22\" and won't affect fast movement images, ie. sports, video games).Component and HDMI support is 480I, 576I, 480P, 576P, 720P, 1080I, 1080PVGA: 640x480, 800x600, 1024x768, 1280x1024 1360x768, 1920x1080OSD Language is in English, French and SpanishIII.  TESTS:A.  AntennaThe TV comes with a analog and digital TV tuner.The first test that I did was by checking digital antenna pickup.  This is mainly for those who are upgrading from an analog to digital television and do NOT have a satellite or cable connection.  Connecting it to the antenna, the television was able to pick up most channels with no problem.Watching television, of course, standard setting may seem a bit small, but you can change aspect ratio with zoom and other choices for your convenience.B.  Computer connectionTested a Mac and PC laptop via VGA input and everything worked as expected (note: VGA cable is not provided)C. Component connectionI tested a regular XBOX, Blu-ray player using first the Yellow, Red and White connections and as expected, picture quality was not all that great.  It would pass for most people but if you are used to watching in HD, then you could only hope the PQ looks better with HDMI cables.D.  HDMI CableI then tested an HD connection via PS3, Blu-ray player and Roku and as expected, HDMI connectivity produced a much crisper image, vibrant colors.  (Note: HDMI cables are not provided)E.  Audio TestTested with surround sound mode and extra bass and treble and sure enough, I was impressed with the audio.  Good spacial sound coming from this HDTV.  For a small TV, really good audio but not sure if the TV would withstand repetitive strong bass but from my tests, surround audio sounds very good for this 22\".F.  Remote Control tests-  Easy to switch the source from TV, VGA, HDMI-  Good button placement, so you don't mistakenly hit a button if you have your remote learning to control other devices-  Easy to change aspect ratio via standard, wide, zoom, etc.-  Easy to adjust colors, tint, sharpness, change audio, etc.-  Easy to switch to closed captions and also TV show identifierG.  PlugFortunately, the plug is long enough, so you can have it several feet away from an outlet.JUDGMENT CALL:Overall, I'm quite impressed with the Seiki Digital 22-inch 1080p 60Hz LED HDTV.  I like the retro look, granted it's more of a modern feel and much cooler than the old Fisher, Zenith, RCA TV's we had back in the '70s and '80s (without the ugly wood finish).  So, aesthetically this TV looks very good.Assembly and easy of use, especially the buttons for the remote is quite simple (big brand TV's tend to overdo it and chances of mistakenly hitting a button that takes you out of a program can be frustrating, but NO problems with the remote).  Eash to select source, aspect ratio, closed captions, etc.While some may want this as a bedroom television or monitor, as a television, HDMI definitely provided much better results over composite and RGB but that's because I have been watching television and Blu-ray via HD for a long time.  But HDMI inputs do provide better picture quality.But the TV is easy to setup,easy to get started, may you connect a DVR, cable or an antenna to get digital channels.  Computer VGA worked easy as well.And the audio for this HDTV is fantastic!Overall, Seiki Digital SE22FR01 22-inch 1080p is a very good television or monitor.  If you intend to purchase this television, it's a solid performing TV for the under $200 range.With that being said, there are are some lower-priced flatscreen that often hit the under $200 range as well.  But the primary drive is for those who want a stylish retro television that is not the standard black flat screen TV.I can only hope that there are colors provided, so people can matchup with their own personal environment but ease of simplicity with this television is a plus.Purchasing from Amazon would be a plus but if purchased elsewhere, just make sure you have a good return policy as any LED, you want to make sure you don't get a dead pixel(s) situation (ie. turning it on and seeing a bright dot).Also, this TV looks even better with an HDMI cable, so be prepared to purchased HDMI cables (these are inexpensive via Amazon or online) if you have a Blu-ray player, HD video game console, Roku, etc.So, if you are looking for a retro 1080p HDTV 22-inch and like the price of this device which is under $200, then this HDTV is recommended!", "Date": "January 10, 2014"}, {"Title": "Retro it is, but more for decor than function", "Author": "gizmosellschickens", "ReviewID": "R2ERHGVCKQCJUK", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Wish it came in black and white or blue colors and had knobs like old TV sets.

Friedman \"J-F\"", "ReviewID": "R1QPNU2182MB7P", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Let me start by saying that we actually have this TV set up and playing regularly in a prominent part of our country/colonial-style home. We get a kick out of it and laugh and tell people, yes, it looks out of place in our living room, with our wood trim and wood-framed windows, and tapestry-style sofa and faux-Oriental rug, but it's a hoot!People come over and say, whoa, look at this, a big, round volume control, just like the old days. Or, look, it's got that rounded look, and the red is really cool.And then we all go, hmmm, yeah, but...the most appealing part of it is that it has all the advantages of a flat-screen TV without any of the advantages of a flat-screen TV!That always gets a laugh.Yes, it's a flat screen, and the remote and built-in electronics have all the modern features, but it's big, bulky, heavy, and you can't hang it on the wall! And that gets even more of a laugh.So what's the point of this product?It's quirky...and it works!It was packed extremely well, protecting all the knobs, buttons, screen, and heavy plastic enclosure from damage during shipment.Physical setup was easy--made even easier by the fact that I chose not to attach the three little tripod legs you see in the photo. We have it on top of a finished wood bookcase that's only a couple feet deep, and we were concerned it might be a little unsteady if perched on three thin legs. The smooth plastic exterior is fine on the wood surface, and it (the whole unit) swivels easily and smoothly if we want to point the screen in a different direction.TV setup was also easy. Remember, this is not a real old-style retro TV! It's a modern flat-screen in a weird case. We have it in a room that has no cable outlet, so I've attached a flat digital antenna I've been keeping for backup in case cable goes out. Initial setup led me through channel searching, and the tuner found all the broadcast stations that we know reach our area. Picture quality is surprisingly good!The remote is comfortable to use, and it has all the functions we expect for a TV. The one thing I find annoying is that on power-on, it takes what seems like 10 seconds or so before there's any reaction from the TV--no startup screen immediately, just black. But once you get used to it, you just wait the few extra seconds and the picture comes on.The antenna comes in through a coaxial cable into the coax input. I've also set up a small DVD player through HDMI, and that works extremely well. The picture is very clear. Sound is good, too. It almost seems as though the cabinet makes the sound fuller than it normally would be on a flat-screen.All that being said, you can probably buy a better flat-screen for this price--with all the benefits of a flat-screen including wall mount. But it won't look funky like this one. Like I said in the headline, it's all about looks...and it works!", "Date": "February 17, 2014"}, {"Title": "A retro product that's this high of quality?  Yup!", "Author": "Chris", "ReviewID": "R3HH3PH6KXJFY2", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I couldn't resist when I saw this TV online...I had to get it...the styling is fantastic and I live in a small condo so it's just the right size.Here are the positives (and there are many)1.  Great Styling (I bought a classic \"General Electric\" decal to go over the Seiki logo to give it even more of a retro look)2.  Input options galore, too many to list.3.  It's large for a 22\" TV but it's still very light.4.  Unbelievable sound for a TV this size. (even has a sub-woofer)  But interestingly turning on Surround Sound made the sound worse.  It's a Yamaha sound system.5.  Very easy start up/set up.6.  Very well designed remote, better than most.So let me say something about picture quality...out of the box I too, like many other reviewers, found the picture quality to be just average.  I played with it but it still came out average.  But then I went to the setup section and turned off something call Dynamic Contrast and started playing with the Noise Reduction feature and the quality of the picture went from average (a C) to good (a B)...most of that improvement came from shutting off Dynamic Contrast.I think the legs make it look a little \"too retro\" and I did not install them.  It has a slight backward tilt which I don't care for, I put a spacer under the back of the TV to level it out.  I don't see where the tilt had a negative affect thoughThis is the main TV for my condo and I love it!", "Date": "April 17, 2014"}, {"Title": "Very cute and retro", "Author": "Michael Powell", "ReviewID": "R2ZFEZ0O3K4UU4", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Good picture and sound.

As I didn't want a black monolith I went searching for today's alternatives. Unless I wanted something for kids from Hello Kitty or Disney the options seemed to be zero. There's a nice orange retro one made by LG in South Korea that appears on eBay from time to time but there are some questions about the voltage compatibility with that, so it was the Seiki or nothing.Looking at small pictures of this set is quite different to the real thing (no, really?). I knew it was going to be red when it arrived but wasn't prepared for just how much red there would be. I mean, it's RED - no ifs, ands or buts. If you're a young teenage boy you will absolutely love it immediately. As I'm not 14 it took me a day or so. Eventually though, it did settle in and become less of 'thing' in the room.The set was well packed and easy to remove from the box. There was no polystyrene, instead the TV was held in place by four pieces of molded, recyclable plastic. Lifting the set out of the box is easy due to the placement of a large carrying handle / hole at the back of the TV.Inserting the legs was very simple, just two screws per leg. They're made of silver colored, hard plastic not metal. The back leg is shorter so it's obvious where that one goes but in addition the left and right legs will only fit in their respective slots.It was a refreshing change to find that the on screen set up for the Seiki was very straightforward. Each step was clear and, like the user manual and quick start guide, in perfect English (French and Spanish are also present for the on screen menu but not the user manual or quick start).There are several options for the picture size and audio output. The picture can be regular (with black strips down each side of the screen), widescreen or widescreen zoom. The back of the set has connections for a variety of needs. These are:Aux In, USB, three HDMI ports, VGA, PC audio, DVD input (audio, left speaker, right speaker), Optical, DTV / TV (for an antenna).After hooking up my DVD player I later also plugged in a small CD player to the Aux In. I've noticed that the set will default to the Aux In, even if the last thing I selected as the source input was the DVD. It doesn't matter if the set is on or off or which order I insert the cables, the Aux In becomes the default selection. This isn't a big problem but means I have to remove the Aux In cable after use and reselect the DVD as the input source.I'm not someone who's fanatical about picture quality - I don't have any access to broadcast TV, preferring to watch DVDs (mostly old shows) and I couldn't care less about Blu-Ray, so I can't pretend to be an expert in that area. What I can say is that after adjusting the picture to my liking I am very pleased with it. The picture is clear and the tone, color, contrast are perfect. As for the sound, I'm impressed. The bass is very strong and I had to turn it down quite a bit but now everything looks and sounds great. There is a huge potential on the volume department, this set could be very loud if that's what you needed.Overall, after using the set for about a week, I feel very happy with it. It was intelligently packed, the set up was simple and the TV performs better than I had hoped. The red still shouts and waves at me when I enter the room but in a comforting, friendly way. It would look so much better in a retro turquoise but I'm just glad I could get it at all.Price-wise, this set has fluctuated between $159.99, $199.99 and $229.99 so pick your moment.I've also posted some photos of my set on the product page (next to the first review, on the right hand side of the page).", "Date": "March 5, 2014"}, {"Title": "Retro Red tv", "Author": "Kt", "ReviewID": "R2VBRNYFBZ96U4", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "This tv was purchased for my mom's red white and black theme kitchen redo.

Picture is clean and clear, a bit dark, but tolerable.  I was looking for something for the grand kids room when they stay over, this was cheaper than other 22\" tvs I looked at.  Ended up in my bedroom and they got my 22\" tv...grin. I like it.  Even with the tilted back angle, there is no glare, and the picture really is good in the bedroom with the lights out, or a table lamp dimmed down.  The legs give enough room for the bluray player to fit up under it, this and not needing external speakers at all, freed up a bunch of space on my dresser.", "Date": "April 9, 2014"}, {"Title": "Love, love, love it !!", "Author": "Meggan E.

Not a big deal, but it takes up more room than I thought it would. The TV works fine, I get a nice picture and the sound is fine. I wouldn't recommend this as a main TV, but it works well in my office. I do wish you could tilt the screen a little. I had the TV on a filing cabinet, but couldn't see the screen from my desk. It also might have been a nice idea to make the legs on it optional. All in all for the price, it's a decent TV with a nostalgic look.", "Date": "February 17, 2014"}, {"Title": "unusual Christmas Gift", "Author": "mugocat", "ReviewID": "R9ULB2DD1WZPR", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I purchased this as one of my husband's xmas gifts.

It\u2019s also advertised as small enough for a dorm room. Assembly was rather easy but after I put it together, I realized that it is bigger than I initially thought it was going to be.There are a number of different connections on the back but it was missing a headphone jack, something that I\u2019m sure many dorm students would have liked. The speakers were not too bad for the small screen; we are not talking surround sound but good for a 21 inch TV. I was not impressed with the view. Although it says 1080, it was blurry and the colors were off. I did have to play with the setting for a while to get things to look sort of normal but it was still off.I have never heard of the brand Seiki. But after this experience, it will be added to my list of not to buy. I was not impressed with the size of this TV, it was big and bulky. I also hated that you couldn\u2019t adjust the view screen. It has a slight tilt up and makes viewing more difficult.If you are thinking about buying this for a dorm room, skip it and get a flat screen monitor. If you are looking for something retro and don\u2019t care much about the quality of everything else then this may be something that you are interested in.Shawn KovacichAuthor and Creator of numerous books and DVD's.", "Date": "January 16, 2014"}, {"Title": "Great!", "Author": "Kathryn", "ReviewID": "R3NP3RATBTNAXZ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "It is great, even better than I hoped.
