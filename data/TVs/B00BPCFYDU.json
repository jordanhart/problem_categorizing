The picture is very good to excellent. I have had it about a mounth, no problems. I purchased it at walmart for 795.00. I would recomend the 3 year extended warranty for 89.00 dollars. That gives you 4 years of peace of mind.Being a new product with out any real life users to review it is not the most comforting feeling.I left it on for quite awhile and still often leave it on all night, no problems. I looked at a lot of tvs in all price ranges,I dont think you can find a better 58 inch led, no3d, no frills tv for the money.If you demand a better picture be prepared to spend at least twice as much.

The 42\" was just too small for the room size(sitting about 15-20 feet away). Let me say that this was not my first choice, in fact my budget was much higher then 800 as my first choice was Vizio's 60\" Smart TV E601i-A3. The Vizio was dull, colors are de-saturated in some scenes and too saturated in others, especially golf. Course greens look like turf and clothing looks like its from medieval times. But that is not why I returned it. I returned it because of a popular defect among EDGE-LIT LED televisions known as the \"flashlight\" effect. Since the LED lighting comes from the sides of the screen, they have to be very bright in order to light up the center of the screen, especially for a 60\" screen size. The light over powers on the edges and bleeds through, so you get areas of cloudiness during dark scenes. Very annoying, especially for such an expensive television. But don't be fooled, you cannot see this defect when viewing display models at retail stores (Fluorescent Lighting!). Also, it is still hard to see this defect when sunlight is leaking in the room, but you will definitely notice it at night.Well, I figured maybe this is just a problem with base level EDGE-LIT LED televisions, returned the Vizio and bought a gorgeous 60\" Samsung UN60ES6100. Got it for $1300 on closeout at BB, which is a steal since closeout for this 2012 model is $1500 everywhere else. The Samsung is so much better then the Vizio, Brighter, awesome smartTV features, just a more true to life experience when watching it, of coarse until the sun went down. Was testing in the dark and had the same EDGE-LIT flashlight issue, such a bummer. Could not get a replacement as it was sold out in my area, unless I were to buy a store model - Which I don't like the idea of buying a TV with over 2000 hours on it.Moral of the story, do not buy EDGE-LIT LED televisions. Only the 'flagship' models have a more uniform screen and very few of us have the budget for those TVs. Of coarse they appeal to everyone because of how slim they are, but these backlits are pretty thin as well (about 3\"). So, I decided to look more towards rear lit / backlit LED televisions(Or plasma-but room is bright and plasma screens have glare issues). Found a few that weren't as bright as the Samsung, even one being an $1100 Samsung didn't cut it. But I had known from the 42\" model being replaced that Sanyo's are very bright and easily compete with top brands even though we all know them as a light-bulb company(the 42\" is a Sanyo).I gave this DP58D33 120HZ a try, with comfort knowing that Walmart has a 90 day return policy on TVs. Spent some time calibrating it - big thing is to turn the ECO mode sensor off and set the ECO mode to 1 giving you a real bright picture. Tested at night, screen black is uniform. This gets my approval and recommendation. For 800, I can now buy a Roku 3 or Apple TV giving me better smart features than all the smartTVs out there. I will say that videos games don't play the best on this picture right out of the box, but when you turn the motion settings off everything is a lot smoother.Overall this is a great unit with a great picture. Beware of the audio out though, for this unit only has coaxial digital audio out. No Optical Digital audio out or Analog audio out.", "Date": "June 1, 2013"}, {"Title": "Good quality and value", "Author": "PINLIN ZHUANG", "ReviewID": "R574QUF2W8J3Y", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Enough port connection for inputs, but missing a good RCA audio output which I need the most.

It has a very good, clear screen. The border is very narrow, almost Apple-like, as it is almost there just to have something to protect the screen when you need to move it. Instructions included were easy to follow, and setup was easy as well. Even with fast moving situations on the screen, there is no ghosting or trailing of the picture, maybe due to the 120Hz.

It worked great until for 5 days of heavy use until last night when suddenly it had no picture???. The original TV was built in Feb/2013. I had no picture on any inputs (composite, RGB or HDMI). Made no sound the picture just went blank without any warning. I would like to know if anyone else has suffered this kind of failure????I took it back and got a replacement new in the box build date March/2013 at no cost.The only complaint I have is that there are few inputs and the built in tuner does not work very well for over the air reception. I am using a HDD DVD recorder to upconvert my analog signal to HD through a HDMI cable & the RGB hookup. The picture is almost as good through both as a native HD signal, almost no noticeable differenceFingers crossed on a long life this time, but can always take it back for refund if it fails again in the next couple of weeks.", "Date": "September 14, 2013"}, {"Title": "Would've said 0 stars if I was able!", "Author": "Angel Curtis", "ReviewID": "R3H80C0IAAS1MA", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "This tv is absolute junk!
