{"Reviews": [{"Title": "LG is underrated.", "Author": "Miech", "ReviewID": "R21RAFG8GZZE95", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I had quite an ordeal over the last month attempting to purchase a new HDTV. I was looking in the sub $1000 range, wanted a 40-42\" LED-Lit model and did a lot of research before settling on the Samsung UN40C6300.I originally settled for Samsung over LG due to in-store picture comparisons and quite frankly, Samsung's great reputation over the past years. They were the pioneers of LED edge lighting and for a long time remained king of HDTVs. When my set arrived via Amazon (which was super simple by the way) and I set it up, I was instantly shocked and disappointed. The samsung model had the worst backlight bleeding I have ever seen in any LCD TV/Monitor.. ever.. Upon researching the issue further I discovered that Samsung now outsources panels and I got stuck with a horrible Chineese CN02 panel while the model in the store happened to be using a Samsung Branded IPS panel. I can't say for sure whether stores always get the better panel for display purposes, but this sneaky bait and switch should be illegal. Needless to say, the viewing angles on the horrible CN02 panel and the awful bleeding (spots the size of softballs scattered through the image). Furious, I set up an immediate exchange with Amazon and went back to researching.Digging deep in Amazon's search, I stumbled across the LG 42LE5400 which was only $4 more then the previous Samsung model. What caught me about this TV over the previous was the following:1) Same exact price.2) Research indicated NO panel lottery and LG using superior IPS panels.3) 2\" Larger Screen4) NetCast Apps (Samsung's only supplies these on higher-end models)5) Wider range of inputs including composite-in6) Matte screen (Yes glossy looks nicer, but I'd rather not watch TV in a mirror).The exchange through amazon was painless and I am always impressed by their policies and understanding. After the horrible Samsung model was dragged away and the new LG panel dropped off, I set it up and was pleased.The picture was just as nice as the Samsung in my opinion (though a bit less crisp due to matte screen instead of glossy, but that was to be expected and actually ended up being preferred due to lack of reflections). I confirmed a genuine IPS panel by the orientation of the pixels and the push-test. I cannot comment on the sound since I always use a home theater receiver and have never used the built-in speakers. The Set comes with tons of calibration options, eco-sensors (which I disabled as I found it preferred to darken the screen too much. Why have an LED screen when you dim it down to nothing). Even the lighting on the power and function buttons has a neat animation and full control of turning off pesky logo lighting when watching in the dark, a nice touch.The only gripes I have on this panel are the following:1) There is some mild backlight bleeding around the top right and bottom left corner. This tends to make blacks in that general area a bit more grey, but nowhere (and I mean nowhere) as bad as the Samsung. I suppose this is just a limitation of Edge-lit panels.2) NetCast does NOT include Pandora even though it lists Pandora all over LGs website. I suppose they only include that in their receivers/blu-ray players, a major disappointment. Should be called \"NetCast Lite\".I really rate this panel a 4.5/5 due to the mild backlight bleeding. I feel more care should be put by all brands regarding this issue, but this panel was much better then others thus why I'm keeping it. I'm also a bit put off by the differences in NetCast.Other then that, I'm glad that I finally have this whole fiasco behind me. LG came out of the woodwork for me and blew me away with a far-superior television then the comparable Samsung model with no surprises, tricks and included many extras for the same price range. Unless something goes wrong (or they start getting sneaky with bait-and-switch like Samsung), LG is my new television brand.", "Date": "August 5, 2010"}, {"Title": "Great unit, but delay lag problematic for video games; audio sync fixable", "Author": "not-just-yeti", "ReviewID": "R2J6CCSAUAGWTO", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "This is a great TV: awesome picture and features.- picture brightness is great: I'm using it in a bright living room (with windows on either side of TV), and the LED screen is bright enough to watch w/o problem.- overall features great: Assume I've gushed on about the picture quality, the number of inputs (including several on the side for easy access), the neat 'video mute' feature (under energy saver) so I can play a music CD on my DVD player and not have to see the DVD's stupid music screen, and so on.  (Hmm, I guess I could play mp3s on a thumb drive directly from the tv itself; I haven't tried that yet.)- Audio sync problem fixed via firmware:  As others have mentioned, after 45min-1hr, the audio became noticeably out of sync from the picture; this seemed to be equally true for all inputs.  It wouldn't get *worse* after more time, but it was bad enough that it looked dubbed.  My initial hack was to switch to a different input then switch back to the program, and it would re-sync.  However, after upgrading the firmware via the internet this problem disappeared.  A few notes:  ~ getting the internet connected took me a bit; even though DHCP should have happened at plug-in, I had to turn my wireless hub off/on in order to get the TV to get its IP address;  ~ In order to trigger the firmware update, I had to press 'netcast' or 'widgets' on the remote; I think it was at that point that the TV automatically sought out the update.  ~ it took two firmware updates in a row to reach the most recent version (6.0.something, I think).- Noticeable delay lag for video games: about a tenth of a second or even a bit more (after some measurements and calculating).  This is acceptable for many games, but for Wii Music every note I play is off beat, and for Dance Dance Revolution a perfect step scores between \"great\" and \"good\".  (This is a lag between when the signal is received and when it actually gets displayed -- it doesn't matter for normal TV since you'd never notice if your entire movie is shifted back 0.1s.  N.B. \"Delay lag\" is *not* related to \"pixel response time\".)~ [Delay lag on other models: I dragged my Wii Music down to Best Buy and tried it on several similar models I was considering.  The Samsung LEDs I tried also had ~0.10s lag; Sony Bravia LEDs had ~0.06s lag (still noticeable); no noticeable lag on LCD Viera or Sharp Aquos *LCD*, but (weirdest part) the Sharp Aquos *LED* did have lag (~0.10s).  All the models I tried were 40-46\"; most were 120Hz.

There is nowhere in the product description tells that the \"Wireless Ready\" feature works if and only if one uses USB wireless adapter made by LG and no other USB wireless adapter. I purchased this \"Internet Ready\" TV with a hope that I would use a different wireless USB adapter that can be purchased for just $15. Now, I am shocked to learn that I will have to use only LG adapter that one can buy for about $80 in amazon.So, when you purchase this product,keep in mind that you will have to spend another 80 bucks to make Netcast and netflix work. Although other option is to hook your computer to the TV by HDMI or AVI.I hope this review help you make informed decision.", "Date": "August 30, 2010"}, {"Title": "Great TV", "Author": "A. Wayne", "ReviewID": "R1NCKZM4RB60N0", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "The LG 42LE5400 is my first flat-screen television, and I've only had it for a couple weeks now. So there are the caveats.But to my eye, it's a beautiful machine -- with the power on or off. I'm the kind of person who wants the giant TV in my living room to look nice even when it's off; only Samsung sets can match this LG in the looks department. It's almost impossibly thin, and when powered off it's just a cool-looking black panel sitting on my entertainment center.Turned on, it's amazing. I haven't noticed any blurring while watching sports or action, the colors are great, flesh tones look like flesh, and the blacks look more than adequate. I did have to fiddle with the settings some out of the box -- turned the backlighting way down, for example. But to me, the television's self-calibration system seems to work great.The Internet apps are pretty good, if a little spare. The TV connects to Netflix, Vudu, YouTube and other Internet video using an Ethernet cable plugged into my wireless router. LG sells a separate wireless receiver that you can plug into the television to ditch the 10baseT. There are also a bunch of Yahoo! \"widgets\" that do things like tell you the weather and check stock prices. They seem relatively useless.So: Five stars, for now. That could change depending on the television's durability; it's a new model, so it doesn't really have a track record.", "Date": "July 2, 2010"}, {"Title": "Good Choice", "Author": "Elroy Jetson", "ReviewID": "R1FLTNZYB7NPL0", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "The TV was very easy to set up. Laying it face down on a side by side pair of couch cushions (thus elevating it above the floor) made attaching the pedestal super easy. Lifting it onto the stand was easy too, it's a heck of a lot lighter than the behemoth tube TV it replaced.Once all connections were made and the unit was powered up, it immediately detected the wired internet connection and requested permission to download a software update. And another update. And another update. And another update. I think there were four. I use an outdoor antenna instead of cable, the tuner pulls in all the channels my converter box did, and then some. If there is a broadcast signal strength indicator, I haven't found it. A broadcast signal strength indicator is very important for aiming your antenna. Digital signals don't fade if you turn the the antenna the wrong way, the picture simply disappears. I'll be keeping the converter box around for antenna alignment purposes. There is a bit of a delay when changing channels - I suppose it takes a moment to lock in and start decoding the new channel. My old decoder box had a similar delay when changing channels.The remote's fairly intuitive, and even has light-up buttons (they time out in about five seconds). The \"Netcast\" and Wigets\" buttons are too close to the up and down on the four way rocker button that's used for navigating setup, Netcast, and Widgets menus - care must be taken when tweaking settings, or you find yourself kicked out of your menu unexpectedly. I already had a Netflix account, so all I had to do was click on Netflix, get the TV's code number, log into Netflix with my computer, and enter the code there. My Netflix cue was up on the TV within thirty seconds.The picture looks really good. I only have one analog broadcast channel, and that one even looks fairly good. The digital broadcast channels look great in SD, and the HD channels look fantastic! Netfilx movies play beautifully. I tried out a preview on VUDU in full 1080, and it was as smooth as silk! My living room gets lots of sunlight, but the TV shows up clearly. At night, during dark scenes, there is a tiny hint of a light glow on the lower right edge, but it is very, very minor (I probably wouldn't have noticed it at all if I hadn't learned of the phenomenon from other reviews).Aside from the aforementioned lack of a broadcast signal strength indicator, I'm very pleased with my LG 42LE5400. So far.*UPDATE* (8/21/2010)Finally found the digital signal strength indicator (via LG's knowledge base search). It's located in the \"Channel\" sub menu, under \"Manual Tuning\". They really should mention this in the owners manual.

Santina", "ReviewID": "R35U4GTNNDOCNC", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I love this TV.  Bought it for our bedroom along with the wireless media kit.  It is perfect.  The tv was very easy to set up, the picture is crystal clean and its just a very clean looking set.  The power consumption economy mode is pretty cool, dims when the lights go down which is perfect for the bedroom then brightens up when the lights come on.  As far as the TV itself I have not found any problems.  I do have a couple minor issues with features.  Netcast - the LG website shows many apps however this TV only gets 4; Netflix, You Tube, Picaso and Vudu (not including Yahoo widgets). I was really looking forward to having Pandora and Facebook so I'm not sure why the website shows them but they are not actually available. Then theres the remote.  I do like the illuminated buttons but thats about it.  The buttons are too close together around the directional click wheel and I've been having troubles with it.  It comes and goes but sometimes it won't let me click the same direction more than once.  For example if I was scrolling or tryng to type something in and I needed to go to the right I will have to click right down right up just to get 2 spaces to the right.  Same thing if I'm choosing and setting the sleep mode.  Annoying but I can live with it.  Having the wireless media kit I need to use my cable tv remote most of the time anyway.  I do wish we could get more apps though.  Another feature I like about this tv is that you can choose inputs.  Standard cable, HDMI or over the air digital.  This is nice because we have the wireless media kit hooked to our main cable box in our living room via a splitter which means both TV's would need to be watching the same shows.  Being able to switch inputs means gives me the option of watching any show on basic cable is someone else is watch HD oon our main TV.

No motion blur, no microblocking, absolutely nothing flawed whatsoever, even while watching fast actioned sports. The TV's speakers work pretty good for such a thin set.

As I explained in the other review, this is the first time I am reviewing a product, and I am doing so only because given the amount we have to shell out for these types of TVs, it's important that we all have as much information as possible before buying.  I bought the LG 42LE5400 in January.  I was attracted to its slimness, and although I had heard that edge LED backlight TVs have problems with blooming, I didn't think it would be a big deal, and was persuaded by the mostly positive reviews this LG model had received from other purchasers.  Sadly, after I got the LG, it became clear to me why blooming is such a big issue.  While the TV is great for watching sports, it was terrible for watching movies or even TV shows whenever a scene with a dark background appeared.  My LG had large bright auras emanating from the four corners, and they gave a faded and washed out image to the picture in those areas.  I called LG customer service to see whether anything could be done about the problem, and the representative's only response was that \"It happens with all edge LED TVs.\"  After trying to live with the problem for a couple of weeks, thinking I might have been overreacting at first, I gave up and returned the TV for a refund.  I then bought the Vizio SVT423SV.  It is not as slim as the LG 42LE5400 (although still only 3 inches thick) but it has a full-array LED backlight, which eliminated the blooming issue.  I did notice what appeared to be some slight blooming once when I happened to look at the TV from the side, at a very extreme angle.  But since that is not how I will be watching the TV, it's a non-issue for me.  I have been very pleased with the picture quality and color of the Vizio, and on top of that, this Vizio model has built in Wi-fi.  So if a slim TV takes precedence over picture quality for you, go for an edge LED backlight TV.  If picture quality is important to you, buy a full-array LED backlight TV like the Vizio SVT423SV.", "Date": "March 14, 2011"}, {"Title": "Great TV, home delivery service misrepresented", "Author": "Kirby1322", "ReviewID": "R1YD8SY0SE6G7F", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "The LG42LE5400 is a great TV, no question about it.

My PS3 looks great linked into this TV with an HDMI cable, and the blu-ray player looks even better. Watching Avatar tonight on the set, can't wait to see the picture quality.The only downside to this set had nothing to do with the TV at all, instead, it had to do with the misleading home delivery service. The company that delivered my set did nothing but push the TV to the end of truck and then I carried it into my house. NO SETUP, NO TESTING. The packaging was great and the TV has no blemishes, so I guess I can't say the shipping was all that bad, but it was definitely misleading.However, if you're looking for a great picture on a TV with tons of perks, this is definitely the way to go. I researched for over 6 months to pick the right TV. I kept going back and forth between the Panasonic Plasmas, and this LG LED LCD. Major factor that pushed me to get the LCD was the amount of light that would be cast upon the screen in the room that I have it set up in.

I would have liked to rate it 4.5 stars but that does not seem to be an option. My biggest complaint with this unit is the remote control. If you have large hands you will have problems with pressing the wrong buttons located around the joystick control section. This seems to be a rather poor design choice on the part of LG.As for the TV itself I couldn't be happier. Since this unit replaced a CRT TV going HD makes quite a difference. Colors look very good and even the sound through the built in speakers is acceptable. I will be using external speakers in the near future, though. Other than the afore mentioned problem with the remote everything else seems to be well laid out.I ordered the wifi dongle with the set and wifi router hookup is a breeze if your router has WPS. All I had to do was go to the router setup page in my browser, click on the WPS button, go to the TV and click the WPS setup entry on it and everything was set up automatically. Netflix streaming comes across at the highest quality with no buffering pauses. As mentioned in another review Pandora is not accessible with this set at the time. It is, however, accessible through my Blu-Ray player so that is not a real negative for me.

At the time we had just moved into our first house and it turned out that the living room would be more awkward to place all the furniture then we originally thought. So the only place to put the TV was in this little corner between the staircase and a strangely placed closet door. Being the guy I am, I HAD to squeeze every inch of TV I could in that corner. This required something very thin so I could push it as far back as possible as to not interfere with the closet door. Well the LG LE5400 is all kinds of thin, at about an inch thick I had no problem putting it in that corner.I did buy this TV right after release, so I did pay close to MSRP, which was a lot. But I'm very happy with my decision. I didn't want a TV that was already a year old and outdated. I wanted a TV that was an LED flat panel, 120Hz, had Netflix built in, and was energy star certified. This was one of the few on the market at the time. I knew the type of quality products LG produced, and I did as much research as I could on a TV that was brand new, so I went for this model. This was the 2nd TV I've ordered off of Amazon. The first was my 56\" Samsung DLP back in 06', which is in the basement right now, still going strong. It arrived via UPS with only one little ding on the box corner, but nothing serious. The TV was well packaged anyway.First off this TV is pretty light, being only an inch has a lot to do with this. The screen is bright and very clear. It is an edge lit LED and I do notice that when the TV is on and the picture is all black that there is some bleed in from the bulbs at the top right and bottom center. This is no big deal as like I said, I only notice this when the screen is completely black. Otherwise, the screen is crystal clear. I know a lot of people say that you cant really see the difference between refresh rates, but I will tell you that first couple of days with this TV, peoples movement on screen looked a little weird at first. But that's because everything was now smoother. Its hard to explain, but after a few days, I got used to it. Blu-ray movies look fantastic and crystal clear.Sound on this TV actually isn't that bad. It was a while before I got my sound bar, so I used the TV speakers for a few months. The LE5400 has 'invisible speakers' hidden behind the frame. No speaker holes or any indication of speakers anywhere. This also make the frame that much more seamless and sexy. They can get loud pretty well and the sound is pretty clear, although I still prefer my Sony sound bar. But the stock speakers did a pretty good job.Netcast is a nice little pack of applications built right into the TV, no additional devices required. There are 5, but the only one we use is Netflix. Its really great not needing to have another device hooked up to get Netflix, even though my PS3 is capable, its just easier for my wife to use just one device. I have the TV wired with an Ethernet cable so its really fast. The TV is wireless 'ready', but I wasn't dishing out extra for it especially since I had the wire already run, plus I prefer hard wired anyway. Its just easier and most importantly, faster. Its nice to see that LG actually updates the firmware of the TV to make it better over the past year. At first Netflix was a bit slow and only capable of viewing things that were already in your instant queue. This meant that in order to add a movie that wasn't there, I had to go downstairs to the computer, log in to netflix, add the movie we wanted to watch, then back up to the TV to watch. But after a few weeks they updated it to be able to browse and find what you want. Much better. Still waiting for a TV with a HULU app (if there is one, I dont know about it), and maybe then I could think about canceling Cable all together.The LE5400 is also capable to plugging in a USB hard drive or memory stick and play video files right off of the hard drive. This saves me from having to burn files to DVDs in order to watch them on my TV. It really comes in handy.Overall I'm very happy with this TV. It was a smart purchase and recommend it to anyone interested. I see that the price has come down considerably from when I bought it.

My other TV is a 32\" Toshiba LCD. The picture on the LG is incredible. Totally blows away the 3 year old Toshiba. Bright, crisp, amazing. I used the picture wizard to adjust for the room. The wizard was outstanding. The wireless USB dongle works perfectly. Everything was not too difficult to set up. The instructions for assembling the base and setting up the wireless are not fantastic, but I managed. My biggest complaint is the sound. The various controls don't seem to make much of a difference. Even my wife commented on the sound quality, and she generally doesn't care about these things (she watches in SD stretch mode!) The Toshiba's sound was much better, but the picture on this thing is so good, I forgive the poor sound. And, as the others have said, if you are running the sound through a home theatre, it won't matter. I use the TV speakers, so I'm a bit disappointed, but, I can live with it. I run the sound through my desktop stereo for movies (you can stop snickering now- I like it). Which reinds me- there is no audio L/R out. It's either HDMI, component, optical, or headphone jack (underpowered). To get the sound to my (old) stereo, I have to run HDMI or Component to my older DVD player/recorder, and then audio out fronm there to the stereo. I guess I could use the component audio out- just realized that.Oh- regarding the lip sync issue. On my setup, I found that the problem was the audio setting on the Motorola DCX-3425 cable box. It was set to \"Auto\". The other choices were L-PCM and pass-through. Once I set it to pass-through, the lip sync problems went away, except for one or two shows on a particular channel. These shows are time-compressed, and I suspect this somehow is the cause of the problem (it shouldn't be, but it's what I see and hear, and even as it is, the change in setting improved the problem greatly). I did get one firmware update, but that isn't what fixed the problem. I've only had the set for about a week, so we'll see if the lip sync problem returns. So far, I am very happy. Can't beat the price-to-value ratio. (I paid $999 at a brick and mortar store that bundled a blue-ray player and the USB dongle). Cable management could be better. There is no way to completely hide them if you are using the stand.I did begin to stream so blue-ray previews over the net, but my internet connectin is only 1.5 DSL, so I hit buffering. But what I did see was breathtaking. I finally found an excuse to upgrade my internet service. I like the Yahoo Weatherbug widget. The others are okay, but maybe there will be more down the road. The included Nero software (on CD) allows you to stream media from your PC's hard drive to the TV. Way cool.I have big hands, and have no problems with the remote.

It was a big selling point for me to get a bluray player with it and honestly I probably would not have bought it otherwise. Overall, I paid $899 for the whole package and I considered that a good buy.First off, right out of the box this TV is stunning. It's thin, stylish, and has a great overall look to it. The base of the TV is a little larger than I expected but it is proportionate to the TV. I have this TV hooked up and it looks fantastic. It had a slight audio sync problem but it was solved with firmware updates. That is it looks fantastic after playing with the settings for about an hour and a half. Which brings me to the biggest negative aspect with of this TV...If you're looking for a TV that you can plug in and have the best looking picture right off the bat without having to adjust the settings... this isn't the TV for you. I recently had a Sony KDL-46V3000 and that TV had a perfect picture and sound right out of the box, no need for change at all. I was hoping for the same. At first, I was very unimpressed when I started to flip through HD channels. Once I started to mess around with the different settings and really dig deep into the TV I started to fall in love. I have never had an HDTV with this level of customization before. After getting everything down for all of my inputs and making sure that everything was perfect, I put the TV through the paces.Blurays from a PS3 are spectacular. Video games are incredible and there is very little to no lag at all when using the customized Game video setting. HD channels are stunning and even SD channels are bearable. Overall, the picture is great, the contrast is good, abut the audio is sub par. I did not get this TV with the intent to use the internet widgets or games so I can not review them at allPROS:great picture qualityhuge PQ and SQ customization abilitiesability to switch off the typical 120 Hz 'soap opera effect'large viewing anglegood contrast for an edge lit LED TVeasy navigation of menu and submenusnon-glossy screenbacklit remoteTV runs very cool and does not warm even slightly with heavy use (also easy to clean out dust from upper vents)CONS:out-of-box PQ is disappointingsound is terrible even with customizationnoticeable delay in picture smoothing when switching inputs and turning on (almost seems like it takes a few moments for all of your custom settings to take hold)requires a necessary update to fix slight audio sync problemsminor flash lighting effect when viewing from a low angleOverall, I would absolutely suggest this TV to anyone looking to buy a new LED TV. However, I can only suggest it when it's at a discounted price. I honestly could not see myself paying $999 for this TV, even with what I know now.

The remote is a little long, I have big hands and reaching from the top to the bottom without a second hand isn't possible, But a universal remote or just not being lazy solves that.  The only other negative thing is when an entire black screen is shown you can see some brighter spots, However; this is only visible on an entire black screen, if anything else is on screen it is not visible.  It has good built in speakers that can go pretty loud and are clear but they can't compete with a full sound system.  The LED lighting is incredible, the colors it can show trump that of tube TVs and when next to a regular LCD TV you can tell the difference.  The clear voice feature works well and actually makes peoples voices easier to hear. I bought this TV for $900 and I think that was a steal for the features and quality of the product. It has a relatively good base but it won't help if someone pushes/falls into the tv, but its a 42\" HDTV so people shouldn't be falling into it.  I haven't tried the internet on the tv yet because I just hook up my computer via HDMI cable but that works really well.  The tv is really thin and light, especially for being a 42\" tv.  Another thing that could be considered a con is when scanning for channels it still checks the old analog stations but you can skip this if you press the button when it's scanning.Pros:  Great picture, Really thin, LED lit allowing for amazingly deep colors, 4 HDMI ports, Great value, Clear Voice system works well, Good built in speakers,  Overall A great TV.Cons: Longer remote than needed, Some bright spots when on an entirely black screen, still scans the old analog channelsI would recommend this TV to anyone I know.

Multiple pre-set options allow users to easily adjust.Wireless/internet app - Until the day TVs can be used to browse the web just like computers, this TV is a great compromise, offering essential web features without commanding a higher price. Netflix, Yahoo and Youtube can be easily accessed. Streaming from Netflix works perfectly and you can watch Youtube videos (although searching for them is a bit painful using the remote control). Note you will need to buy a LG specific wireless USB adapter. You can get one on Amazon for $30/$40.Matte screen - If you want a glossy screen this TV is not for you. However if you have large windows in your living room and want to reduce glare to a minimum this is it. Even in broad daylight the reflection is very small and does not affect the viewing experience.FYI for Wii users - You will need to purchase HD cables from Nintendo ($30) then change the Wii settings to 480p to remedy a 0.5 second lag on the TV, which takes the fun out of most games.

Everywhere I turned, people were touting \"Samsung\" this and \"Samsung\" that.  Well, After seeing a few TV's in my local stores and comparing pictures, I wasn't overly impressed with Samsung.  Don't get me wrong, they have a great picture, but at a premium cost.  However, there were several other televisions with great pictures.  I didn't see anything that compelled me to pay several hundred dollars more for that brand. I then purchased a Vizio (primarily for price) but saw this model while shopping for a TV stand.  Ironically, it was right next to the Vizio I had purchased earlier.  Not only was the picture better, but the price was pretty much the same.  Well, needless to say, the Vizio was returned unopened and I went with this set.This TV is fantastic!  Lightweight, razor thin, and a gorgeous picture.  The contrast is great.  The blacks really pop instead of being a muddled dark gray.  There is no light leakage among the edges.  When I switch the picture to a dark solid colored screen the lighting is uniform and perfect.  The 120 Hz makes my sports and my sports/news channel tickers finally stop blurring.  HD looks awesome, especially Blu-ray.  Even the SD channels (a particular sore spot for me and I'm sure many other HDTV owners) don't look bad.The television is Internet enabled and wireless ready.  Just be advised, \"wireless ready\" means you have to purchase a $50 LG USB wireless device. It also has a LAN port on the back.  Since I plan to stream a lot of content to it, I opted for the wired config.  You can get things like Netflix, Pandora, and Picasa via the TV.  It also ships with a disk containing Nero MediaHome 4.  I thought the Nero software would be great, however, it uses a ton of system resources and can bring your computer to its knees.  I plan to find a different software solution.  The widgets are okay.  One thing I like is the automatic software updates.  The TV performed an update when I powered it on for the first time and regularly checks for updates.  In fact, it's performing an update right now as I type.  The set ships with a non-backlit remote.  I'm not sure if it's universal, but if I had to guess, I don't think so.I love my new television.  I really love the fact that this 42\" 1080P 120Hz LED cost me roughly the same as the three-year-old Sony 32\" 720P 60Hz LCD it replaced (prices have really fallen!)  And the picture on the LG blows away the Sony. In fact, my uncle has a 55\" Samsung LED and my HD picture (to me) looks better.  I honestly don't understand all the hype surrounding Samsung.  If you have the (truly) disposable income and must have the designer name, go with Samsung.  If you want a TV with just as good a picture and also save a couple hundred bucks in the process, go with LG.

I finally bit the bullet and picked up this 42\" LG, and am completely satisfied with the purchase.  Picture quality is great, with practically no drop off at odd viewing angles.  Setup was straightforward and took only a few minutes.  One of the reasons I went with LG is they seem to be the only manufacturer making 42\" LCD sets right now.  We have a TV cutout that limits our size choices, a 40\" would fit easily but a 46\" will not.  The 42\" screen fits perfectly.  The set is attractive, and sound is reasonably good for a flat panel TV.  I have also noticed no \"flashlighting\" nor backlight leakage that is purported to be a problem on some LED backlit sets (Samsung in particular).  One thing I will point out is that unlike what I read in another (otherwise excellent) review, LG does do the \"panel lottery\" thing.  This means that the actual panel type is variable, and is not selectable by the consumer.  This particular set seems to come in IPS and VA panel variants.  IPS is the superior technology but I was sent a VA panel, and as previously mentioned I am still completely satisfied. The only way to determine this is by an obscure code that's on the box.

It is also very easy to set up and connected wirelessly no problem with the adapter.

It still works great and the picture is outstanding.Out of the NetCast package, we've only used Netflix, Youtube in some occasions and I fiddled with the widgets so I can only comment on these 3 things.Netflix is working fine and the interface is simple enough that kids can use it although there is no parental filter that I know of.Youtube is fine too although the interface is not as easy as with Netflix.The widgets are irrelevant.The TV received maybe 2 updates over 18 months and the support is quasi nonexistent. No new features/services have ever been added which is truly kind of sad.The TV itself is able to play movies from a usb stick and I've been lucky enough that it would stream movies from my Synology NAS. Codec compatibility is basic and in general I think it doesn't play MKV files or any files that had audio encoded in more than 2 channels (although I didn't pinpoint exactly the requirements for a file to fail)Later on I just decided to use XBMC to play files so I guess you would say that I fixed the problem myself.One thing that has been a bit of a problem is that the audio from the headphone plug is pre-equalized (no bass) and there is no way to adjust it from the TV interface. So when I wanted to connect my set of 2.1 speakers that only gets audio in from a mini jack plug, I was really disappointed. Of all, this has been my biggest complaint at this point. I understand that this won't be an issue for most people because they'll plug the optical out to their receiver but I thought that skipping any capability to fix the audio is a mistake.so OK I spent a large amount of this review listing cons but to be honest I love my TV for the picture, it is a truly great panel.Now I got everything worked out, no audio issues whatsoever and I can watch any movie I want but I had to fork out for the right devices.", "Date": "August 28, 2012"}, {"Title": "Great Deal", "Author": "Reply Hazy Try Again", "ReviewID": "RRC2ML9G9ZH0Z", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Good picture, options are good.

Very rarely but on occasion you can see some ghosting when something is moving fast.  I notice this specifically on two occasions.  One is watching football.  every so often you can see a trail behind the ball when it is thrown.  Overall it is not bad but that just bugs me when it does occur.

I suppose that other tv's have better black levels but I always watch TV with a light on and never have problems with inadequate black contrast. The biggest plus is the screen coating. Some tv's use a highly glossy screen to make their colors appear more vivid but this causes lots of ambient reflections. This TV looks GREAT in a well-lit room- reflections aren't an issue.

But the audio quality is terrible (also noted by most reviewers). It sounds like the hosts on CNN are talking to you on a telephone (sometimes worse). I thought using HDMI inputs you should get the best of everything. It seems the audio quality is an issue with most Flat Screen TVs nowadays because the manufacturers expect you to have external speakers. If you like to watch VH1 or like to listen to MP3s on your external USB, then the audio quality is going to be an issue.For internet access, I am using a wireless USB dongle from LG. I have a one word review for this feature - \"FRUSTRATING.\" It asks you for a wireless WPA password everytime you turn on the TV instead of remembering it. Since the remote doesn't have a QWERTY keyboard, you have to use telephone like inputs to enter your inputs. The inbuilt browser is pretty bad. It doesn't try to fill in forms for you from previous inputs. Page navigation (forwards, backwards) doesn't work the way computer browsers do. So I often have to input entries all over again when I am trying to search Youtube videos, using the telephone like keypad. Perhaps TVs will have better inbuilt browsers in a couple of years.I am still giving this 4 stars because of the picture quality on some of the HD shows. But note that a lot of video content, especially old archives are not shot in HD, so when the TV tries to stretch it to fit the big screen, it can look pretty bad.", "Date": "December 9, 2010"}, {"Title": "More than I expected", "Author": "C.

I was tired of toggling between tabs and moving windows around my iMac monitor.  Buying an 30\" Apple Monitor screen would have set me back $1799. I started to do some research and I was surprised to find price of comparable LED screens to be significantly less.I bought this at a local retailer as an open box item for $950. The additional features of Internet and WiFi ready, D-TV scanning and audio options just makes this a no brainer even at full retail price.Took a little while to get this all set up but well worth the effort.", "Date": "April 29, 2010"}, {"Title": "Very Satisfied", "Author": "Kapampangan ku", "ReviewID": "RYGKVRRDGAZBC", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "My first one was a Sharp 40 LED aqous which I returned to Best buy becausee it is so bad that I prefer to watch on my CRT TV.Then after reading a lot of reviews and going to the store (Best Buy) I finally decided on this LG 42\" LED5400 model. I've had to say that it is way better than the Sharp TV and cheaper too. I got mine last Dec. 2010 for $900 with a free 14\" lcd tv from Best Buy.

I went to my parents to watch TV and standard definition looks so blurry now compared to HD.Look for coupons/sales like I did and get a good deal on this TV if you can - otherwise, even at $1300 I believe it's worth the money.", "Date": "April 27, 2011"}, {"Title": "mess1", "Author": "mess1", "ReviewID": "R1LCZNOLO50PKX", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "The sound and picture quality is superb.

I don't even have cable (or any free channels for that matter).  We were looking for a new tv to replace one that I broke a few months ago.  Its only purpose would be to watch free online content via a computer, occasional movie watching, and playing video games. The lag on this tv while playing video games was enough to make us return it.  It also has major backlight bleed.  It was immediately noticeable, especially around the corner and edges and in also the center.  After researching, it looks like LG has used 2 different panels for this tv.  Unfortunately, we got a bad one.From what we watched, the picture quality was fine.  You definitely need to turn off the true motion to stream netflix or else the contrast is noticeably off but I've seen this on the Samsung as well.  As for it's other features: Aesthetically - the tv looks great.  The remote and menus were user-friendly.

It had excellent specs for the price. We got it home, set it up, and immediately noticed that the whole left side of the screen was brighter than the rest of the TV.

With a black screen, the \"flashlight\" light bleeding was painfully obvious - there were distinct blotches scattered around the screen, with the left side being the most uneven. It was really too bad, because this TV was truly beautiful and the picture quality was excellent. Even the speakers sounded good.
