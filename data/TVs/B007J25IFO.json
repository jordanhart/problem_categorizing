After the one year warranty period SAMSUNG Television screens tend to show burn-in and ghosting with horizontal lines, along with very heavy distortion of picture on right side of screen.  This problem is systemic in all their LCD's and LED's.  Consumer's have complained all over the internet.  There are even numerous Youtube postings with the exact same problems as in my DEFECTIVE SAMSUNG model, as well as the same DEFECT in other models.  This defect occurs upon start-up, and lasts for the first 15 minutes of trying to view a program. Then the picture gets progressively worse over time and continuously declines.I tried SAMSUNG's Executive Customer Relations Dept. and was told:  \"We will do nothing but refer you to a local Authorized Repair Shop.\"  They were downright blunt and rude to boot!  I feel robbed of $2,900.00The repair will consist of a diagnosis visit, and then another visit to install a replacement \"Panel\" that costs $1,300.00 for the part plus $279.00 to install, plus taxes......all told, another $1,719.16....basically, buy another TV.SAMSUNG customer service also told me that their Televisions depreciate at 20% per year, and they do not repair any of their products after 4 years!  Their own repair people told me to just buy a new set!!!If I save one family the heartache of losing they're hard-earned money, I'll be happy!SAMSUNG CONS:No Customer SupportSystemic Panel DefectGhosting of imagesBurn-in on screenDistorted pictureVery expensive to repair", "Date": "November 29, 2013"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "$1,999.99", "Features": null, "Name": "UN55ES7100FXZA 55\" Series 7 LED Black Flat Panel 3D HDTV With Full HD 1080p Resolution Smart TV WiFi Built-In Dual Core Processor 240Hz Refresh Rate & Wireless Keyboard", "ImgURL": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/31JKKN%2BOFyL._SY300_.jpg", "ProductID": "B007J25IFO"}}
