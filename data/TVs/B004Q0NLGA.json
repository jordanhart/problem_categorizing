It arrived very quickly. The sound and picture are great.  It was ready to use right out of the box. We can now read the words on the screen. I also like being able to plug my camcorder in to the USB port to view the videos of my kids activities after I tape them. We are thinking about buyiny a larger Haier TV for our livingroom", "Date": "October 19, 2011"}, {"Title": "Just Fine", "Author": "Jeremy S.", "ReviewID": "RS1K32ZZYMGOG", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I guess they have a few bigger, flatter TVs out there now for around the same price.. Buuuut, this one looks just as good and it's super sturdy. I use it as my television but sometimes I'll do computer work on it :)", "Date": "October 2, 2012"}, {"Title": "zimbob", "Author": "zimbob", "ReviewID": "RFMZ7JIYLD6DC", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I purchased this LCD TV for my garage shop.  Therefore I didn't necassarily need 1080dpi to be fine.  It only had to perform in a saw dust environment which it has.  Set-up and operation was pretty straightforward.  Considering where it operates and it's $170 price tag, you cant beat it.
