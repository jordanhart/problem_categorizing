{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Far from perfect, but still a great value for a 4K UHD TV", "Author": "Wayne \"Omegafiler\"", "ReviewID": "R2JYDQZPWVTH7R", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "The Seiki 4K TV's are relatively new and have recently made some headlines with being one of the first manufacturers to build a 4K TV for a fraction of the price of the competition. There are many questions that I have such as what, if any, sacrifices were made to get such a low price, how does it work as a PC monitor, gaming possibilities, blu-ray, low-def content, etc. So let's jump in and see how it does!DESIGN & INPUTS:First thing to note is how the TV is being used. It's in a medium sized Media/Game room that measures about 14' x 13', give or take a few inches. There are 2 windows with blackout curtains. And I'm normally sitting anywhere from 4 ft (at my desk) to 11 ft (couch) away. This room has a couple of computers, so it's used as an office / game & media room (aka \"man cave\").The TV is only about 2\" deep and has thin \u00be\" border around the screen. However, there is a larger \"base\" at the bottom where the included stand mounts. This protrudes towards the back another 1\". It also only weighs about 50lbs.The TV is currently sitting on a mobile TV cart with it's included stand so I can roll it around as I compare it to my Toshiba 50L2200U 50-Inch 60Hz LED-LCD HDTV that is mounted on the wall. I wanted time to review before making a commitment to replace the already pretty darn awesome Toshiba. :) It's only about a foot lower and is using the same sources. The stand is a bit wobbly if you bump it, but I shouldn't need it for long.There is also a 2\" wide LED \"bar\" on the front of the TV that changes from blue (on) to red (off). Even though it's larger than necessary and can't be turned off, it's dim enough so I never even notice it when I'm watching TV, even at night. The buttons are on the right side towards the outer edge, facing back. If you mount on a wall, you'll need to feel around for the buttons if you can't find the remote.You can check out the specs to see what inputs it has. The main inputs I'm focusing on are the 2 downward facing HDMI inputs and 1 side HDMI input. It lacks Optical Out, but does have Coaxial Out (RCA type of cable for S/PDIF). Just a note as some may want to have a way to route high quality audio to an external source. In particular, if you don't have a 4K compatible receiver (more on that later). Otherwise it has all of the other inputs and outputs most folks are looking for.PICTURE QUALITY:So how does it look? After its calibrated, most content looks excellent. As with most TV's the default profiles leave much to be desired. My sources are OTA (Over-The-Air) HDTV, Blu-Ray, DVD, a Media Center PC, and a gaming PC. I don't currently have cable or satellite. There have been some mixed results though.As with all high resolution displays, lower res content will suffer a bit without up-conversion. This is exaggerated even more when you are up-scaling from \"normal HD\" (720/1080p) up to Ultra HD (4K2K or 3840x2160). As with virtually all high def TV's this is already done for you, on some level. Although the quality of that will most certainly vary depending on the TV (or external scaler) involved and source material. There are considerably more pixels that have to be filled in on a 4K TV so the quality can vary.I'm going to have separate sections for the various sources as there was quite a bit to cover. So I'm focusing on overall picture quality of the TV itself. And well, overall, it looks very nice; once calibrated of course (see section below). This is very important. Out of the box this TV had one of the worse picture quality I've seen in quite a while, almost entirely due to Noise Reduction being turned on by default for every input.The TV does have local dimming where it tries to improve overall contrast ratio by limiting the back-light to only what needs light. You're really only going to notice this on a specific scenes where there isn't much content on the screen. Such as a small opening logo on the screen. It does a good job of limited this so it's not annoying. For example, the first fight scene in Star Wars III is a good test, as it's entirely filmed in space. Black levels looks great, no obvious signs of local dimming, colors were vibrant, no blurring, etc. It's also more than bright enough for daytime viewing with minimal glare. I even had to turn down the brightness at night time.Side viewing angles are pretty darn good. If you want to get picky, the magenta test pattern does indicate a slight red tint when viewing off angle. In my case, that's standing about 8 ft back, and moving to the sides at least 4-5 ft off center. However, when watching \"normal\" content at this distance, there was no obvious change in picture quality or tint. When sitting off center at my desk, 4 ft away, you will notice the image start to dim a bit. That's expected and perfectly acceptable for me.Overall image uniformity is equally impressive and one of the best I've seen, if not quite \"perfect.\" Displaying bright solid color test patterns on the TV, in a dark room, does reveal some spots that are ever so slightly darker (or brighter depending on the pattern) than the rest. We're talking about getting overly critical here folks. This isn't even something I can notice with normal viewing, but I'm throwing it out there regardless.OTA TV (720p / 1080i @ 60hz):We'll start with OTA (Over-The-Air) HDTV first. This basically involved a Coax cable connected directly to the TV via an HD Antenna and allowing the internal TV tuner do the work. Keep in mind that OTA will vary depending on the channel, but they are normally either 720p or 1080i. And this is also where I ran into my first issues.At this time I'm not able to turn off Noise Reduction in the menu. This is available with most TV's and is meant to help clean up lower quality signals (i.e. non-HD content). I can toggle it off and to other levels, but when I go back into the menu, it turns itself back to Medium. This doesn't happen with HDMI inputs.Unfortunately this has a noticeably negative effect on picture quality. At it's worst it has a very pixelated and almost ghosting effect to the image, especially skin-tones. In addition, I'm seeing A/V sync issues, where the audio isn't quite in sync with the video. I suspect the two are related.I've already updated the Firmware, but didn't have any effect. I'm waiting to hear back from Seiki technical support and will update as needed (see update at bottom).MEDIA CENTER & BLU-RAY (PC/1080p @ 60Hz):I have a dedicated Media Center PC that I normally use for OTA TV, Blu-Ray, and playing hundreds of TV Shows and Movies from various local and internet sources. I've \"digitized\" most of my DVD/Blu-ray library in high quality 1080p. Unfortunately the older Nvidia GT430 video card in this system isn't capable of outputting to 4K, so we're limited to 1080p.Which is just fine as I've found everything here to look excellent. And I wanted to test a good \"Normal HD\" source since that's what most are going to be using right now anyways. It's only when you sit close to the TV (around 4-5 ft) that you start to notice some minor pixelation from the TV up-scaling lower res content. Also, since the TV Tuner in the PC has the liberty of going through HDMI, I don't have Noise Reduction to contend with! Blu-Ray movies are playing with PowerDVD 12 and they also look excellent. I've been watching stuff on here non-stop as I evaluate the TV and adjust settings.So far, so good. Everything look comparably crisp and clear compared to my Toshiba at normal viewing distances. Even though the colors on the Seiki are definitively a bit more vibrant.PC MONITOR (4K @ 30hz):At this resolution, who wouldn't want to at least consider the idea of using the TV as a PC monitor? For this task I have to move to my main gaming rig (more on that below) as the Nvidia GTX 680 graphics card has HDMI 1.4 and can actually output a resolution of 3840x2160, albeit at 30 Hz. I've also had to bypass my Onkyo receiver as it doesn't have 4K pass-through. This is something to keep in mind because if your source is connected to the receiver before the TV, it's not going to be aware that you have a 4K TV connected at the other end.As you've probably already read, one of the biggest complaints folks have is the limitation of the current (and latest) HDMI 1.4 spec being used with video cards, in that this is as good as it gets. No 60 or 120 Hz at any 4K resolution until you jump back down to 1080p or lower.However, if you just want to use this as a normal PC Monitor, surf the web, or just multi-task like crazy, there are no issues with the lower refresh rate. The scaling is perfect at it's default settings and everything is very crisp & clear. Just don't expect to read anything from the couch unless you increase the DPI scaling and/or font/text size within your OS. The text is quite small!There is a very slight amount input/refresh lag with the mouse. It's minor, and probably won't bother you with basic apps on the desktop, but still noticeable to my sensitive gaming self.Since the PC is the only true 4K source I have in the house, I fired up several 4K videos from YouTube as well some nice looking 4K images I have. Put simply, they looked excellent. However, depending on the videos, some did have choppiness due to only being 30 Hz, while others seemingly ran perfectly smooth. I suspect this will be one of the biggest complaints when relying on your PC for 4K goodness.GAMING (4K @ 30 Hz):I'm using a 20' HDMI 1.4 cable to connect my nearby gaming PC directly to the TV. There is no \"game mode\" on the TV, so what you see is what you get. And that is basically 4K resolution at 30 FPS (Frames Per Second). Most PC gamers are used to being much closer 60 FPS as it does result in smoother game-play.Console gamers or perhaps less hard-core PC gamers who are probably either used to the 30 Hz they've been playing with on the TV for years may simply not notice and/or care. For my test I fired up Battlefield 3 and Starcraft II, set them to the max resolution, turned on vertical sync, and lowered the details enough to ensure a consistent frame rate. That was usually around low to medium settings, by the way.Vertical sync will keep the frames capped at the max the display can handle, which in this case is of course 30 FPS. In addition to preventing screen tearing, this limits widely varying frame rates which can also result in a more negatively perceived gaming experience. Being an RTS (Real-Time Strategy) game, SC2 is actually playable, although input lag was more noticeable here than at the desktop. In BF3, being the FPS (First Person Shooter) that it is, was a bit worse; basically unplayable for me.While the graphics looked awesome on this TV, I won't be playing any serious games at this resolution. 60 Hz would definitely improve the overall experience, but that won't help input/refresh lag on it's own, and may not even be available for PC's until future revisions of DisplayPort (which the TV doesn't have).GAMING (1080p @ 120 Hz):At first I didn't bother with this as the input lag noted above was an issue. However, it would appear after the recent Firmware update I applied, it has drastically improved input lag and delay at 1080p. Unfortunately there was no change at 4K resolution. After selecting \"Customize...\" within the NVIDIA Control Panel (under Resolution) I was able to select 1920x1080 @ 120 Hz, Progressive.This simple change from 60 to 120 Hz is even noticeable at the desktop where text is suddenly much sharper and clearer. I could actually use this as a gaming monitor sitting perhaps 3 ft away. Of course this isn't anywhere near the crispness of 4K due to scaling, as some smaller text is still blurry this close; but not bad. So I tried out SC2 and BF3 again and they are indeed very playable, running right up there at 120 FPS. The Nvidia GTX 680 has no problem keeping up. Although to maintain 100+ FPS, I have had to bump down the resolution on games just a bit from their maxed out settings.TV MENU & 120 Hz:Before I get into calibration, I should first mention that there are very few settings to adjust on this TV. What I list below is all you get for HDMI picture quality adjustment. Also note that you can't adjust any of the preset modes (Movie, Normal, & Dynamic). Once you make a change, you're into the 4th \"User\" Picture Mode. Each input also has it's own memory for settings.In fact, the menu in general is very basic. You've got Picture, Audio, Time, Setup, Lock, and Channel settings. In each menu, there are only a couple of settings. And none of these let you control 120 Hz or enable some form of \"motion smoothing,\" as it's often called (and often assumed to be present with 120 Hz TV's). It's just something the TV does automatically in certain display modes, such as when it's requested by the source.When watching movies, I'm rather sensitive to 120 Hz (or higher) motion smoothing as I often find this feature quite bothersome and always turn it off. I find it kills the cinematic feel of the film. Just person preference of course. The good news is that in my testing I really haven't seen it's effects anywhere.The menu also annoyingly goes away if you don't push a button after about 10 seconds. I don't expect a lot for a non-smart TV, but a bit more adjustments would be nice. Although it's still a relatively minor issue as I was able to get a nice picture with it's limited menu.CALIBRATION:This is a combination of adjusting on the fly and a bit of help from the Disney World of Wonder calibration disc. Which I should add, is a must-have for HD TV's. Since some of this is indeed personal preference, you may just want to use this as a starting point and go from there. Also see \"Menu\" section above regarding lack of options.*** Note: If there's one setting you do adjust, make sure you turn off Noise Reduction. I noted this previously, but feel it deserves mention again. It has such a negative effect on HD picture quality I can easily see why somebody would want to return the TV if they didn't check that menu setting. ***Disclaimer: I'm not an \"A/V expert\" by any means and I'm still playing with these few settings. Although these are so basic, it's hard to mess it up. :)Picture Settings:Contrast: 61Brightness: 46Color: 48Tint: Can't adjust with HDMISharpness: 0Color Temperature: NormalNoise Reduction:Off (In Setup Menu)DLC (Dynamic Luminance Control): OffAdvanced: Can't use, only for VGA inputSOUND & REMOTE:There really isn't a nice way to put this, but the built-in \"speakers\" are pretty bad - even for a flat panel TV. They are down-firing speakers and are located on the bottom of the TV. They have a very \"tiny\" and weak sound to them. Changing the mode from Stereo to Surround helps as it at least gives the impression the sound is coming from the front, versus somewhere on the sides. Quite unusual. Although in my case, I'll be running to a surround sound system, so I won't bash them too much.The remote is very basic and almost as bad the speakers. Which may be partially due to the IR receiver on the TV, which is located right next to the LED bar on the front. It has all of the right buttons, but it's not universal, and is very picky as to how you're pointing it at the TV. Just the wrong angle or not directly at the IR sensor, and it'll ignore your input. Or it will register additional button pushes 1-2 seconds after you've stopped pressing them.One nice feature is a Picture Mode toggle button. So it's got that going for it. I'll have to keep that in mind as I program my Harmony Remote to take over. :)PROS:+ Thin design+ Great value for a 4K TV+ Contrast ratio+ Vibrant colors and accuracy+ Viewing angles+ Picture quality+ LED Backlit+ 1080p Gaming @ 120 Hz+ Good scaling of \"Normal HD\" content to 4k+ Ultra HD 4K Resolution!+ 3 HDMI InputsCONS:- OTA TV Issues (Noise Reduction & A/V Sync)- Limited Menu Options (i.e. Picture Adjustments)- Can't adjust 120 Hz setting- HDMI 1.4 limited to 30 Hz @ 4k.- Input/Refresh Lag @ 4K/30Hz- Cheap Remote- Low quality speakers- No DisplayPort Input- No Optical Out (It does have Coaxial for S/PDIF)- Wobbly StandCONCLUSION:Well, this review ended up being way longer than expected. But hopefully I was able to give you enough organized information so you can find what you're looking for out of this TV. At least from my personal experiences and opinions. The big question is probably whether or not you should even buy a 4K TV right now with such limited content available.I think if you're in the market for a new TV and you can find one in your budget, there's no harm in going a little future proof. And with 4K I think it's safe to say you're good for the next couple years. :) And just remember, new 4K hardware and content is already rolling out.At this time, I'm going to give this 4.5 stars with a reserved recommendation depending on what you're expectations are for this TV. And of course, pending feedback from Seiki with regards to the OTA TV issues. That's mostly based on the pure \"4K TV value factor\" going on here. The TV Tuner is not something I'm personally going to use, and most of the negatives aren't relevant to my needs; but do want to follow up for those interested. I'll be updating the review as I get more info.Feel free to comment with any questions and I'll respond as soon as I can. Thanks!*** UPDATE 7/02/13: ***I spoke with a Seiki Technician regarding not being able to disable the Noise Reduction feature with OTA TV. Apparently, that's \"working as designed.\" I explained the negative effect it has on the picture, but it doesn't look like there is anything they can do about it as they believe it should be on. Perhaps if enough folks complain they'll \"fix\" that menu option and even keep it Off by default for all inputs.I've also decided to use this TV as my main PC monitor (via HDMI 1.4a). It's been a few days since I made room for this huge \"monitor\" on my desk and it's been pretty darn awesome. I just run at 4K/30 Hz for desktop tasks and then switch over to 1080p/120Hz for Gaming. So far the only issue I've had is when Windows turned off the display (i.e. power management), it would intermittently cause the TV to go into it's power-off state (red LED) and not respond until I pulled the power cable.Disabling this feature in the OS has so far resolved that issue. Going in and out of stand-by or hibernate hasn't caused any issues. The technician did suggest removing power for 3 hours to allow everything to fully reset, should issues persist. Otherwise everything is working well.*** UPDATE 2/21/14: ***I just wanted to hopefully  have a final update to address a few FAQ's in the comments. First, the TV is still working great as a PC monitor/TV. The input/refresh lag is something you just either get used to, or not. I personally wont use it for games @ 4K. But as a large 4K desktop monitor or gaming @ 1080p/120hz, it's still impressive even months later. It's actually hard going back to a \"normal\" size monitor.The other most common question is whether or not this TV will get an upgrade to HDMI 2.0, which supports 4K @ 60Hz. Unfortunately, at this time I haven't heard anything from Seiki regarding the possibility of a Firmware update, or if it's something the TV is even capable of handling. They still haven't released a firmware to address the previous issues I noted in the review, and that was back in May 2013. So it's likely this will be something made available with future models. Some more expensive brands, such as Sony, can be upgraded. But we're at a much lower price point here.Also keep in mind that even if you have a TV that supports HDMI 2.0, the source, and cable must also support the same HDMI spec (or newer). Otherwise you may run into issues. My suggestion is to simply buy it for what it is right now. Which is, as the title says, a great value for a 4K TV. Enjoy! :)", "Date": "June 27, 2013"}, {"Title": "Total breakthrough for linux programmers.", "Author": "Clint Baxley \"Truth Love Joy\"", "ReviewID": "R3R4Y6PPZ1QN29", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Ok. I got this in the mail today and wasn't sure if it would work with my hp dv7 laptop with an intel hd3000 graphics card (HDMI only out). When I first opened and connected to this monitor the resolution defaulted to a maximum of 1920x1080 @ 24 Hz. It was pretty sharp but the last TV I had was just as sharp at that resolution.So I spent all day working with different modelines to try to manually get the resolutin right. The monitor was impressive and would display all kinds of modes between 1920x1080 and 3840x2160. BUT. They were all kind of blurry and would not have worked to program all day on.Well after about 4 hours of working with random timings and resolutions I thought I would try xrandr with the 3840x2160 modes untill I found one that very closely matched an hsync of 30. I found the closest line that I could get to 30hz was:root@dv7# cvt 3840 2160 13.8# 3840x2160 13.79 Hz (CVT) hsync: 30.05 kHz; pclk: 144.25 MHzModeline \"3840x2160_13.80\"  144.25  3840 3944 4320 4800  2160 2163 2168 2180 -hsync +vsyncI guess you could find something closer but that was close enough. So I ran:xrandr  --newmode  \"3840x2160_13.80\"  144.25  3840 3944 4320 4800  2160 2163 2168 2180 -hsync +vsyncxrandr --addmode HDMI1  \"3840x2160_13.80\"Those make it so you can select it in the Displays or monitors section depending on your distribution (make sure you have the right HDMI port by running xrandr without any arguments).If you don't know where the monitors section is you can run (leave off the quotes):xrandr --output HDMI1 --mode  3840x2160_13.80Anyway after I ran that and the monitor came back from being black... BAM! Super high definition and huge display! I was so happy I cried a little. Not a pixel is bad and text is so sharp it is like sitting in front of 4 monitors!I cannot think of anything I have ever bought that deserved all 5 stars any more than this product.My monitor prayers have been answered.You can feel safe with the purchase.

The Seiki Digital SE50UY04 is the first reasonably priced 4K TV. \"4k\" is the new buzzword for LCD TV technology and the easiest way to understand what 4K means is that there 4 times as many pixels than HDTV/1080i. 4K means the LCD supports a resolution of 3840x2160 pixels and it is also sometimes called QFHD or UltraHD.Below I'll outline the status of 4K technology but the summary description is that this TV is excellent but the price point may make it more suitable for console gamers, graphics designers, and \"early adopters\" who like to play with new technology. Two years from now 4K will come on most new TVs and media components but this is the first inexpensive 4K HDTV.[Review] 10=Good, 1=BadFit and Finish:  8Picture Quality: 9Sound quality: 7Software: 7Accessories: 6Ease of Use: 7Connections: 7Warranty:7What you are getting here is an excellent basic Ultra DH TV and monitor. The basic fit and finish is elegant and minimal. The base seems to be real glass. The bezel is so thin it fits in the same space in my entertainment my 42\" plasma was occupying. The TV has basic controls and adjustment but this isn't a smart TV.This TV isn't perfect. That's why this TV is meant for early adopters.  Unless Seiki comes up with some special double-headed HDMI cable, specialized video card controller or firmware magic trick to feed in true 4K, we are probably stuck using it with unconverted content.  The HDMI 1.4 plugs on this TV can't handle true >30Hz 4K bandwidth. It would be nice if HDMI 2.0 was approved and incorporated into this tv.  It would also be nice if Seiki had put a Displayport connection on this TV.  But they didn't. The remote isn't that greatest either. Under the warranty you are responsible for packaging the shipping the TV back to them.Unfortunately there isn't much 4K content available. So why would you buy this?  Right now if you have a new, high-power AMD/NVidia PC video card, with a little tweaking you can view beautiful 1080p games unconverted to 4K. But the real reason for most to buy a 4K LCD is because later this year the Xbox One and PlayStation 4 come out and they both support 4K upscaling. Don't expect streaming 4K from Netflix or Amazon until 2014 or 2015. Youtube has 4K videos (youtube.com/view_play_list?p=5BF9E09ECEC8F88F) but they can be hard to identify. Over the next year you will start to see most major sporting events broadcast in 4K.There are two technologies that need to be widely adopted for 4K to become common:1) High Efficiency Video Coding (HEVC/H.265) that will compress 4K video so that it only doubles the amount of data transmitted rather than quadrupling it as content goes from 1080p to 4K2) HDMI 2.0 to support higher data bandwidth and frequency for full 60Hz 4K video.Even if new Blu-Ray players and media streaming devices don't broadcast true 4K they will still probably utilize more sophisticated 4K upconverting techniques that send better 4K signals to the TV. So what happens if your Blu-Ray Player, DVD Player, DVR, Direct TV Receiver or Cable Receiver doesn't support 4K yet (probably)?  The video stream is \"upscaled\" in the TV itself.  In other words, a chip in the TV creates extra pixels to fill in the extra information.  The result looks great but not as good as true 4K.  The more the TV has to upscale, the poorer the results.Here are two things you should remember:1) If you buy a new Blu-ray player or home theater device make sure it supports at least a 4K upscaling.2) CHECK/UPGRADE THE TV FIRMWARE RIGHT AWAY, DIRECTIONS BELOW.  The upscaling software it comes with had a bug and they fixed it so upscaling works better.[Tips]When I set this up I located my Sony Blu-Ray player under the TV in the gap between the stand and monitor.

We contacted the company and after talking to a tech support rep, we instructed to ship it back to them (at our own expense) and they would ship us a new one because our malfunctioning unit was still under their \"great\" 1 year warranty.We shipped it to their location in Mississippi (at a personal cost of $120) We were initially instructed to email the tracking number to the rep we had originally spoken with to speed up the process of them shipping us the new one. We shipped out the originally TV on Nov. 20th.  We never received any confirmation that they had received the number or later the product until we called 2 weeks later. After being on hold for 30+min on several occasions (most times we were sent to voice-mail) we were told everything was in line to ship and to expect our new TV within 7-14 business days. After two more weeks, we called back. still no TV. we were told that they no longer made our model and we would have to wait until a refurbished model was available. Already having waited a month for this replacement, we refused to accept this and finally got a supervisor to approve an upgrade to the next size up. We have since been waiting for the replacement, approaching two months now. Every time we have called, we are told its waiting to be shipped or they are backed up and it will take up to 5 weeks to ship or their warehouse is out of stock. Every time a new story.

The 4K site states that the viewer needs to be 5 to 6 feet away to see the difference on a 4K screen.  That presented no problem for me as I am sitting less the 3 feet away as I type this (which is shortly after the announcement of the HDMI 2.0 standard).My purpose in buying this unit was solely to use as a PC monitor.  I had been using 3 1600x1200 displays rotated into portrait mode because that is how I work  -- 3 large text displays, editing code.  I became so accustomed to this, anything less is constantly frustrating.  Since 1080p displays became a standard, the quality of monitors has dropped and one would have to pay through the nose for higher resolution. 2560x1440 IPS displays have only recently dropped below $500 if you don't care about brand or source.I've been watching display prices. When the Seikis appeared, I couldn't believe it. I felt there must be a catch but I couldn't find one.  I'd been putting off building a new system until certain key components were more affordable, namely displays and 1TB SSDs. When both appeared < $700, I decided to go for it.I can only detail how they work as a PC monitor.  There are drawbacks but they are few.The first drawback was that from a PC they require 30 Hz input, period.  I had attempted to use the built in graphics of the Intel i7 4770K CPU.  The i7 supports 4K but only at a max of 24 Hz.  The Seiki reported to the system that 24 Hz was supported but it could not be displayed, the Seiki reported signal issues and I could only see corrupted glimpses of the desktop every few seconds.  I supplied a graphics card that supported 4K and multiple timings and the Seiki was happy. When I looked at the screen resolutions the Seiki was reporting to Windows that it could support, it listed 24 through 30 Hz.What's great about the Seiki is that my Windows desktop looks great.  I was concerned about having a monitor that is only 30 Hz.  I must say, it is not an issue. I have no idea what this looks like for gaming but I would guess that it would be run at 120 Hz 1080p.  And as another reviewer pointed out, you need to go into the Seiki's menu so that it doesn't try to enhance your picture.  And if you are using Windows, I highly recommend finding the ClearType settings and adjusting them.  If you're a Windows user and you've never done this, you should. Like a visit to the optometrist Windows will give you a bunch of text images and you tell it which is clearer and it will display the text as sharp as your monitor and your comfort allow.  Also, if you are a Windows user and run older programs that attempt a bad scaling of the fonts they use, you should know about a little used setting you can make. It involves finding the .exe of the program, not a shortcut, and right-clicking on it and selecting Properties. From there you go to the compatibility tab and find the box that says, \"Disable display scaling on high DPI settings\".  This can make a difference on monitors of 1080p and higher.  This should only be used if needed and will not have an affect on most programs.Now, here are the downsides, I've encountered.Low contrast text appears a bit fuzzy.  I write a lot of code. I stare at text a lot.  Text editors for programming colorize text to aid readability.  I use a dark gray background. The typical default color for a code comment is green. There isn't a lot of contrast between it and the background and it just isn't as sharp. And this text is just not sharp.  Readable but fuzzy.  My guess is how LED displays handle contrast and black from backlighting. People complained that early LCD monitors didn't display black only dark gray.  Enter LED backlighting, backlighting is turned on behind a pixel when the display determines it's bright enough to need it.  That way sections that want black can be black and you can have vivid images with high contrast.  The downside is the backlighting isn't at the same resolution of the display.  For a picture it doesn't represent a problem but for text with immediate changes from black to white or from grey to green in this case it does and the contrast is lost and the text isn't as sharp. All other text is sharp, and you aren't likely to have a lot of low contrast text anyway.The other annoyances are minor.  I don't like the remote.  Every remote I have has the volume on the left side, this one has it on the right and you can't really navigate it by feel.It has no auto-on.  This means if your PC after going into screen saver mode turns off the display, the Seiki will sit there on a blue screen for several minutes and then turn itself on.  If you wake up the PC, you will have to manually turn the Seiki on.  This isn't adjustable in settings.  It also doesn't auto-switch to the input with a valid signal, which depending how you like things may be a plus.There are buttons to turn the Seiki on, adjust volume and change input.  You'll need to feel around to the back on the lower right and learn where they are by feel or keep the remote handy.That's not a lot to complain about, and none of them are deal-breakers.Video and final thoughts.As for video, I haven't found a lot. And just because a video is 4K doesn't mean it's a good image.  There's still the level of compression and the quality of the compression method used, otherwise you get a blocky image with compression artifacts particularly when there's a lot of fast motion going on. There's a growing list on YouTube. And when you get up close to examine the detail, all a 4K display does is show how imperfect the video is. There is one called Skydive Dubai which uses about half the bandwidth of the others but has less compression artifacts.There are only a handful of true 4K movies, and I'm not really motivated to shell out $700 for Sony's 4K video streamer but I am curious what the demo videos it is preloaded with look like.  There are no 4K blu-ray discs right now  (there's barely a spec) but there are streamable 4K movies you can buy.  And that concerns me.  Generally, a blu-ray movie fits on a single blu-ray layer < 25GB.  The studios are big on packaging multiple discs but the truth is, they could fit everything with all the extras except the DVD version on a single disc.  But that movie at 15 to 20GB is still a huge whopping download.  When you stream an HD movie, that video has been compressed by a huge amount.  Put this way, a typical fast connection will get you 2GB per hour.  When you stream HD from Netflix or whoever, they know you don't want to sit around through 2 meals waiting for your video to start, so that blu-ray which is still compressed video gets compressed again a whole lot more.A 4K image is 4 times the size of blu-ray.  This means (because of the way compression algorithms work) it takes about twice the size of a blu-ray to get the equivalent quality level.  But when streamed, unless you are going to wait overnight for your movie to be downloaded, you are going to be getting reduced quality. Which makes the only reason they want to sell us 4K movies is to make them streamable and get rid of resale or even loaning your mom your disc. It's the way it will be, eventually.I bought this to use as a good monitor. It's a bit small to use top watch movies but it is very nice for editing photographs, text and likely videos as well.  I'm very happy with it. I imagine Seiki will learn and improve future models.If you read this far, thanks for listening to rambles along with the review.

Here are some tips:1) I updated the 39\" with the 50\" firmware to fix the 120Hz 1080p refresh issue and the reported stuttering at 4k. (Firmware is available on Seiki's web site--simply copy the file to a blank USB drive, attach the drive to the monitor, enter the service menu: Menu+0+0+0+0 and choose update firmware--just be careful not to play around with other settings in this menu)2) I changed the various brightness/contrast/color settings in the main menu and service menu as follows:In the regular menu, choose:Contrast: 52, Brightness: 48, Colour: 39, Warm, Sharpness: 0Noise Reduction and DLC: OffIn the service menu (Menu+0+0+0+0) choose:Backlight: 40, Red Gain: 141, Green Gain: 141, Blue Gain: 116, Red Offset: 520, Green Offset: 510, Blue Offset: 510Make sure to choose \"Save to EEPROM\" after changing the gain/offset valuesWhen in 1080p mode, choose an Aspect of \"Just Scan\" in the regular menu, to eliminate the overscan issue3) When connected to a computer using an nVidia card (HDMI output), make sure to choose YCbCr in the nVidia control panel and not RGB. Choosing RGB will cause you to lose a lot of detail in dark areas of an image.4) I had issues with using 4K with some Windows games if I ran the HDMI through a Yamaha 4K passthrough receiver, as it reported that the screen's native resolution was 576i so you may want to avoid that. One option is to run a second HDMI cable from the video card (using a DVI->HDMI adapter if needed) to your receiver if you want to get audio (and make the appropriate selections in the audio section of the nVidia control panel).5) Finally, the TV seems to have an unusual subpixel ordering of blue, green, red, rather than red, green, blue. This makes Cleartype font rendering look bad. You should run the cleartype tuner under Windows, and when the first pair of text samples comes up, choose the one on the right and then proceed through the rest of the wizard, choosing what looks good to you.After all of this, I get great picture quality in both 4K and 1080p modes!", "Date": "January 13, 2014"}, {"Title": "You get what you pay for but it needs a lot of tweaking", "Author": "Majik \"FTW\"", "ReviewID": "R3K400ZOMGU1SQ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I just got this display so I'll share my initial impressions.The first big thing you should know is that this TV only supports HDMI input, which is limited to 30Hz refresh rate. This means this display is not suitable for hard core gamers because you may experience some lag and tearing. Updating the firmware helps to reduce the lag significantly.I'll update this review as I use it with more information.Note: 4K displays require a LOT of processing power. You WILL need a beefy video card. I recommend a Geforce Titan (or later).Note: You MUST use a HDMI 1.4 cable. Older revisions of HDMI cables do not support 4K. You can use the one that came with the TV, but don't replace it with an existing older HDMI cable you might have lying around.First I'll explain everything you have to do to make this display functional as a monitor.[1]First, you will probably want to get a better display stand because the one that comes with the display is not adjustable in any way. Shop carefully because after market display stands tend to be bought by government organizations and large companies so they tend to be overpriced.[2]Next, before you even start using the display, upgrade the firmware. You'll get a better picture and more options in the menu. I also noticed that the display lag when I move my mouse was significantly reduced after the firmware update.The process described on the manufacturer's website (where you unplug the TV, plug in the flash drive, then plug in the TV) does not work so don't bother trying it.To upgrade the firmware:1. Go to the manufacturer's website.2. Click Downloads.3. Format your thumb drive with FAT32, using the Default Allocation Size (if you use any other allocation size the TV won't find the device).4. Download the firmware for the SE39UY04 and unzip the single file in the zip file to your thumb drive.5. With the display powered on, press Menu then 0000.6. Navigate with the remote to Software Update.7. If thumb the drive is formatted properly and contains the install.img file the TV will power off and the LED will flash rapidly between blue and red for about 2 minutes (the website says 30 seconds, that is a lie).8. After the firmware update is done the TV will reboot and display a setup wizard. If you're using the TV as a monitor you can hit Return on the remote to skip this.[4]Setting up:1. Plug in the HDMI cable to the TV then to your video card. You MUST use a HDMI 1.4 cable. My TV came with a nice one.2. Plug the cable into your video card.3. Press Source on the remote to select the HDMI port you plugged the cable into. The input on the left side is HDMI3.[5]Configuring your video driver:1. If you have an NVIDIA graphics card, open the NVIDIA Control Panel, go to each section and click Restore, Apply.2. Reboot your PC.3. Go into the NVIDIA Control Panel and check that the resolution is set to Native (4K).[6]Adjust scaling (Windows 8):By default text on the display will look like crap, especially in your browser, because Windows sets the display scaling to maximum. I like to set it to 1 notch down from maximum. That way I can still read the text but it doesn't look like it's being displayed on an NES.1. Go to Control Panel.2. Search for \"DPI\" in the search box.3. Click Display (the only search result that comes up).4. Drag the Smaller/Larger slider to set your preferred scaling.5. Click Apply.6. Reboot.[7]Backlight Adjust:I found the backlight's default setting to be eye seering. After you update the firmware you can go into Menu and adjust the backlight setting to something more reasonable.[8]Disable 4-hour standby:Seiki apparently decided that 4 hours of TV is enough for anybody, so they have made their TVs automatically shut off after 4 hours, and buried the option to turn it off two menus deep in a hidden debug menu.1. Press menu, 0000 on remote.2. Go to \"Others\"3. Go to \"4Hours Auto Standby\" and set it to Off.You have to scroll all the way down past the first page of options.[9]Themes:Most applications that support themes (including Windows itself) do not include images that are of a resolution high enough to not look like garbage on a 4K display.For example, in Chrome you'll want to reset to the default them in Settings or you'll get lots of ugly pixelation.Edit 3/6/2014:Here are some additional settings I found help make the picture better:* Make sure your video card is set to output ycbr rather than RGB to get correct color.* Check the Temperature setting in the TV's settings menu is set to Normal.* Turn the Noise Reduction off in the TV's settings menu.* Set the Sharpness in the TV's settings menu to 0.", "Date": "February 18, 2014"}, {"Title": "tweaking technology geek developers should just buy this now", "Author": "tony scott", "ReviewID": "R1XXC1MUQLWCCZ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I'm really happy with it, but i have a few reservations about recommending it wholesale to just anyone.  The SEIKI 39\" 4k \"TV\" still has limitations as a computer monitor.  It has HDMI 1.4b inputs, which means it can only support 30Hz at 4k resolution. Hopefully future revisions of this display support HDMI 2.0, or add DisplayPort connections to enable 60Hz.  I hear this is a big deal for gaming, but I don't notice it in my daily web developer workflow.The display visual quality is great, not color perfect for photography, but close enough for any general dev and web work.  It does have a glossy screen, which can be a distraction if you're used to matte displays or have a bright work environment.At 39\" it is about 110dpi, which is 10dpi higher than my previous 3 dell ultrasharp fp2001 21\" 1600x1200  monitors which were ~96dpi.  Text and curves are smoother now.  It's essentially like having 4 20\" 1080p monitors without bezels.  I appreciate that I benefit from the extra pixel real estate here rather than a dpi bump of the other brands 30\" 4k monitors.The hugest improvement to my workflow is thanks to the incredible 2160 vertical pixels.  That means less scrolling text in code files, less scrolling for long web pages, or in my case, plenty of room for a 1080p sized window with a 1080p sized F12 dev tools or firebug window embedded into the same window. AMAZING!  Excel and PHPMyAdmin are easier than ever to digest information full screen at 4k resolution for database tables with a lot of columns and rows.I was already accustomed to using the windows app \"GridMove\" to break up the large monitor into smaller virtual window spaces that i can maximize windows to instantly with keyboard shortcuts.  Keyboard shortcuts are key because it feels like a long trip with the mouse cursor moving from one corner to the opposite of the 3840x2160 maximized screen.The biggest drawback for using it as a monitor are mostly the result of it being designed as a TV.  As other reviews mention, it doesn't support DPMS power off/on support which is how windows shuts down the monitor after the pc become idle, and turns it back on when you wiggle the mouse, etc...  A complication of that is when the monitor is powered off Windows thinks it has been disconnected, and all my windows are resized to a 1024x768 corner in the top left of the monitor when i unlock my workstation.  This could be the result of the AMD video card drivers too, i'm not sure.  An easy workaround is to leave the monitor on and use a \"blank screen\" screensaver instead of the power saver options.  (assuming your admin's windows group policy allows that option, mine doesn't)  Instead i found an autoHotkey script that can learn and later restore window placement. I use that after i logon to put all my windows back where i had them previously.I initially bought a low end AMD R7 230 2GB video card (~$70) that supported 4k over hdmi.  It worked fine for desktop, but couldn't keep up with 4k youtube video playback fullscreen.Our new workstations have AMD Firepro W5000 2GB cards that are about 3x more powerful, it has no problems keeping up with 4k youtube video.So overall, yes, I would without a doubt choose this monitor again at this price point. (I even saw it went on sale for $117 cheaper than i paid last week!)  It's ideal for a problem solver developer or techie, but i'd hesitate to recommend it for somebody who'd prefer something that \"just works\" without tweaking.  I hope the next generation will learn some lessons from this early milestone in price to pixels.  I'd love to see a 39\" with a matte display and even a single DisplayPort input supporting 4k at 60Hz.  (ditch the TV tuner and coax inputs, etc and sell this as a monitor!)Hope this helps somebody who was intrigued as I was by this display!Update 11/20/2013:I have calibrated my display for the computer using the X-rite \"ColorMunki Display\" spectrometer and software.

After finally getting through to Seiki, they approved the return shipping of the broken tv, at my cost ($220). Seiki sent me another one that has an inch line of dead pixels on the left lower screen, it is very noticeable, so that is unacceptable.  Of course I sit on hold forever, again.  I can tell you I'm not going to spend another $220 to ship it back to them on top of the $1620 I have already spent.Update Oct 18, 2013.  Seiki will not send me the shipping info to send it back. After sending the amazon receipt I haven't been able to get them to respond.  For the last 3 weeks I've been sitting here with a dead tv calling them getting sent to voicemail after holding for 15 minutes.  What a scam.Update Oct 1 2013, after 4 months it died today.

The 30fps is not ideal but is fine for most every game.  There are some that you can turn vsync off and there is little screen tearing and get over 100fps for driving games.  There are some bugs on some games that don't allow AA but you really don't need it anyway.  I was at the point where all games were the same old thing but now I play everything as if its the first time seeing HD.  As for non 4k tv and movies its basically a budget lcd and the dot doubler is not an upscaller so not much improvement in 1080 stuff.  Youtube 4k content is automatically downscalled by yt to 2k resolution but it still looks much crisper and better than 1080p.  There is also an overscan issue on 1080 that could bother some people.  I would recommend this to pc gamers only.

It has great colors/response/viewing angles and of course the most important thing.. 4k. It doesn't look great out of the box and does require some adjustments in the service menu. One of the major things it needs is the sharpness set to 0 (that just runes things IMHO).I am just using it as a monitor but i have watched a bit of 4k content here and there (via a computer). I also do use it as a TV/media center as a big desk replaced  the stand my old 42 inch TV used to be on and now this doubles as a monitor and a TV. All TV content is ran off a computer so I have no issue with the scaler which is not the best quality.One of the things that made me very happy was the fact it was very low input lag and would do 120 Hz @ 1080p which meant it could be used for gaming as well. I am super sensitive to input lag and it is slightly noticable at 1080p but pushing 240Hz @ 720p (tv still only refreshes at 120hz) seems to half the input lag which makes it completely unnoticeable to me.There is only one reason why this TV does not get 5 stars (as I am reviewing the 39 inch model). Unlike the 50 inch model the 39 inch can't do >60Hz. This is a big bummer as there is significantly more input lag at 60Hz and it makes the TV from being great for gaming but poor for gaming and only good for production use. IMHO gaming is the only thing where >30 hz is actually *necessary*. Sure its nice to have but not required IMHO. Gaming at 60hz is bareable but with the added input lag its not great. The lack of 120Hz on the 39 inch model significantly lowers its value in my book.Size-wise the 39 inch works much better as a monitor and is a great size. The 50 inch is a bit big for a monitor but I still have been enjoying it on my big desk especially as it doubles as a TV for me.For those of you on ATI with the 50 inch display you can try using my modified monitor .inf to get 120Hz out of it. On nvidia this is easy to do by adding a custom resolution but I made the inf for people on windows/ATI. I personally use linux to drive the display. Lowered review from 4 to 3 stars.http://box.houkouonchi.jp/seiki_4k_31hz_307mhz_1080p_120hz.infUpdate 07/26/13:Unfortunately my 39 inch display died with only 1 full day of use and I had it for less than a week. I would guess less than 15 hours of usage total on it. Amazon was great in getting a replacement scheduled to be shipped out but not very happy that the monitor died so quickly. Hoping I was just unlucky. The 50 inch version has been spot on so far. Since I use it as a monitor and a TV I easily use it 10-12 hours/day.Update 01/05/14:Upped review to 5 stars. Finally got things going at 120Hz by flashing the 39 inch model with the 50 inch firmware...The scaling is now simple pixel doubling at 1920x1080 so it so it renders well without the scaler messing with the image. This is better scaling (IMHO) for computer/game use which is what people running at 1080p@120hz would do.I know a ton of people preferred this method of scaling. I am guessing its a difference in the i2c commands being sent to the display is causing this. I think this is probably a plus for most although this does make the scaling at 2560x1440 more jagged but more bolded IMHO so it could be argued which is better at resolutions that don't scaler perfectly.Also this is not completely verified yet but it is looking like the issue of the 39 inch neading an HDMI detective so that when you power it off windows thinks the display went away also appears to be fixed. I haven't tested enough to verify this yet though. I haven't had windows get resized and all moved to one monitor since I flashed it with the new firmware.I also assume this will fix the issue where the display turns off after several hours of use as well as I have seen that several times on the 39 inch but its never happened to me on the 50 inch model.Kind of lame you have to do this in an un-official way but now that the display does 120Hz @ 1080p with minimal input lag I am finally a happy camper.Here is an updated inf file which supports 1920x1080@120Hz and has 240Hz @ 720p (which not all computers list) as well as the regular 30Hz mode and keeps the HDMI audio stuff and other features:http://box.houkouonchi.jp/seiki_custom_edid_120_240hz.inf", "Date": "July 24, 2013"}, {"Title": "Native 120hz @ 1080p, an Extremely Rare and Surprising Feature", "Author": "Aphex", "ReviewID": "R2DRBH1KNK9YBE", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "On quality and function alone, this TV is a gem in the world of digital displays.Almost always, when a TV says it's 120hz, it means it takes the 30hz or 60hz signal, and interpolates frames in between.

True Native 120hz [Which this TV is capable of] is usually something only found on high end computer monitors, and requires the computer to output at 120hz. The option for monitors display at double the standard 60hz, typically leads to a price tag that's double the norm.When I first plugged in, I couldn't for the life of me figure out how they could advertise \"120hz\".

But to my utter astonishment, the variety of 120hz offered by this TV is native 120hz, not the gimmick 120hz you'll find on every other TV. Although not listed as standard resolutions under most operating systems, it is indeed possible to output 120hz via HDMI. If you're using windows and a graphics card half a decade new, look for the ToastyX Custom Resolution Utility. Tweaking settings, and a few restarts later, this monitor is tested to be capable of the following refresh rates:3840x2160 (8 megapixel)@ 30hz2560x1440 (4 megapixel)@ 60hz1920x1080 (2 megapixel)@ 120hz1280x720  (1 megapixel)@ 200hzInput lag is significant at 4k, but nonexistent at any other resolution. So if you're going to do some gaming, sit back with the biggest 120hz monitor on the market, with naturally built in subsampling. If you need to visually parse data, and organize information, pull that epic 4k option out of your pocket to see 8 megapixels at once. Or if you're looking for a middle ground, 2560x1440 is smooth, scales well, and is sharper any other TV on the market, yet larger than any other 2560x1440 monitor on the market.This TV is not really a TV. It's a 50 inch LED monitor that will accept every resolution, to the maximum bandwidth of HDMI 1.4, that happens to have a tuner, speakers, and multiple inputs. You need to connect this to a computer. If you're not, go buy one with the three thousand dollars you're saving off the next cheapest 4k TV.", "Date": "July 11, 2013"}, {"Title": "Broke after 6 hours. Zero support. Low quality.

You wouldn't want to use it for anything else because of its awful color, uneven backlighting, bad lag, nasty afterimages, and 30Hz maximum refresh rate at 4K resolution, but it sure did fit a lot of text.Then, with no provocation, the screen popped up a \"NO SIGNAL\" error.  I power-cycled it and fiddled with the connections, and tried moving from HDMI 1 to HDMI 3; no change.  I switched to HDMI 2, which took a bit of effort because there's a protrusion on the case that prevents plugging most HDMI cables (including the supplied one!) into HDMI 2.  On HDMI 2, it was able to display a signal... but only at up to 1920x1080 resolution, which made this just an ugly TV.  I verified the brokenness with three different HDMI cables, four different laptops running three different operating systems, a desktop PC, and a PS3, so this was definitely a hardware problem.I called Seiki's tech-support line.  It dropped me to voicemail after 15 minutes on hold, so I left a message.  I waited a day and tried calling them a few more times; nobody answered.  I emailed them; no response except an automated acknowledgement from their ticketing system.  I waited a few days, and then gave up on Seiki entirely and started the Amazon return process.In addition to the serious brokenness described above, I should mention that every single thing about this monitor is kludgy and terrible, from the start of the setup process where you drive a bunch of pointy wood screws into the plastic base, to the painfully slow (~1 minute) startup every time you turn the thing on, the idiotic default settings (overscan and unsharp-mask enabled on 4K inputs, as if any human on the planet would want that!), to the broken HDMI EDIDs that require weird configuration tweaks on many computers, to the lame user interface, to...Sometimes you get what you pay for.

numbers as 25 fps video is played on the Seiki using 4k at 25 fps via HDMI.  As you can see, the frame display cadence for 4k 25 fps input is not steady - try counting along with the frame numbers in the top line and you'll see what I mean.  The longer frames are *twice* as long as the shorter frames.With 4k 24 fps input, the same behavior is observed by others in message forums - the Seiki's screen image refresh rate at 4k is locked at 30 Hz regardless of 24 or 25 fps input.  The frame duration cadence for movies on the Seiki at 4k is worse than an old 4:3 tube set.Why?With 4k 25 fps input via HDMI, the panel UI says 3840x2160 25 fps, but despite that, the display only updates the pixels on the display at 30 fps frame boundaries.  The frame durations are in ratio 1 1 1 1 2 1 1 1 1 2 1 1 1 1 2 etc.  The longer-duration \"2\" frames spread apart like that are more noticeable than the 3 2 3 2 3 2 frame timing of 3:2 pulldown on an old 4:3 tube set.  Also, the ratio between long and short frames is 2x, instead of only 1.5x for 3:2 pulldown.  Ideally, all the frames would be the same duration, and one would tend to assume this display could do that at 4k 24 fps since it's marketed as a TV, but no.For movies, there's no way to feed this display with 24 or 25 fps at 4k resolution to get reasonable frame timing out from the panel.  It'll take the frames at the input, happily declare the input mode as the mode in the UI on the display, and then display the frames at 30 fps, frequently doubling a frame to make up the difference.Other info:With 4k at 25 fps input (and probably at 24 or 30 input), the backlight flashes at 60 Hz.  With 1080p 120 fps input, the backlight flashes at 120 Hz.The lag with 4k 30 fps input is significant, even for general computer use, but the native resolution looks fine when nothing is moving.  I'd swag that the lag is more than just an extra 1/60 of a second that you'd expect switching from 60 to 30.  Maybe roughly 40 ms more lag than a typical 60 Hz monitor.1080p at 120 Hz seems to work fine with low lag.  A few times the display went black for a few seconds then came back - but I switched to a different cable between different output and different input, and I haven't seen the black screen since.  At 120 fps input, panel refreshes and backlight flashes really are happening at 120 Hz (verified with the same camera), so 25 fps input frame timings this way tend to be 5 5 5 4 5 5 5 5 4 and similar (verified with camera), which is totally reasonable, and 24 fps should be clean 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 and looks fine after calibrating brightness and contrast.  This is assuming driving the display with 120 Hz 1080p for 24 fps material...  Driving the display at 1080p 60fps for 24 fps material doesn't look terrible but has 3:2 timing (the display doesn't know how to remove 3:2 timing).  The 3:2 timing isn't too bad (way better than 1 1 1 1 2 timing).  Or, you can drive it at 1080p 24 fps, which looks at least as good as driving it at 120 fps (given 24 fps source material).  I haven't checked with the camera whether 24 fps input vs. 120 fps input is actually doing anything different at the display, but it's very obvious that 1080p 24 fps input definitely does *not* have the 1 1 1 1 2 timing problem that 4k 24 fps has.The service menu (0000 at top level of main menu) has a few per-color settings buried in it, as well as being able to turn down the backlight.The scaler at 2560x1440 80 fps or 60 fps isn't great (and the display doesn't advertise that resolution).  Some have claimed it looks fine for them, but to me it looks like it's doing a favor by displaying that resolution at all.  It looks much worse than 1920x1440 at 30 fps (which the display does advertise), so I suspect its a scaler throughput limitation, but that's only a guess.  Don't count on getting > 30 fps from anything above 1080p with good scaling.  Native 4k doesn't need scaling and doesn't appear to have any.  The lag for such modes (at 60 fps or more) isn't bad though.The 1080p to 4k scaler - I don't know precisely what it's doing, but it looks good.  The weird thing is, scaled-up cleartype looks better than scaled-up non-cleartype.  So it seems like the 1080p up-scaler is sub-pixel aware or something...  Which is cool, and I can't think of any reason this would be bad for video quality - and it doesn't appear to be bad - 1080p looks fine up-scaled.  Up-scaling for several 30 fps modes looks ok - or rather, slightly more blurry than the 1080p scaling relative to input pixel size, but that's what you'd expect for not-exactly-2x modes.  No beat pattern is visible.  Above 30 fps for those modes, see previous paragraph.  But for 1080p, the good scaling works up to 120 Hz.  I didn't mess with 720p input much, but on first glance it looked fine.Not all modes allow adjusting \"color\"/saturation.  Not all modes have overscan scaling/zoom modes (why would anyone want that anyway).  Brightness + contrast is always there - I haven't tried to see if all modes allow separate RGB adjustments in the service menu.  Different modes behave differently with regard to automatic backlight brightness control, which I haven't found a way to set manually in any mode.  It's not per-zone brightness as far as I can tell - it's just dimming the whole backlight when the pixels are all very nearly black, then boosting it back up when anything is displayed.  It does this in 1080p modes, but not 4k modes.  I assume its intentional.All modes have some visible horizontal backlight bars that can shine through a little bit, but these are reduced if you're at optimal viewing angle.  4k modes seem to have different dark color handling - it seems easier to spot posterization/quantization boundaries near black in 4k modes.  At 4k those regions tended to look a little purple (and therefore more distracting), instead of just different amounts of luma in 1080p modes - I couldn't quite convince myself whether it was just different brightness settings or similar - YMMV.  I don't think the display was causing the posterization/quantization, but if it's adding chroma to what should be only luma differences, that would be lame - maybe it can be calibrated out.So, as a 1080p 120 Hz display that can take input frames at 120 Hz, it's ok to good.As a 4k display, it's not for watching movies, and it's not for anything where roughly 40 ms extra lag is bad.  It's ok for viewing photos (to non-pro LCD color standards anyway), and it's fine for massive amounts of text.  Or if you happen to have 4k 30 fps videos to play, that would probably look pretty good.

I also have a new Intel Core i7-4770S (Intel Core i7-4770S Quad-Core Desktop Processor 3.1 GHZ 8 MB Cache-  BX80646I74770S) on an Intel DH87RL motherboard (Intel Boxed Desktop Board DH87MC Micro ATX DDR3 1600 LGA 1150 Motherboard BOXDH87RL) which is supposed to support 4K HDMI with just the CPUs GPU, which I also have not yet tried.I was initially a little concerned about the smooth screen surface. It seemed more reflective than the Asus PB278Q monitor I was using, but so far, reflections have not been a problem. The room I have it in doesn't have a lot of bright objects to reflect. I personally prefer a very non-reflective screen, although many argue they are not as sharp.I am seeing some slightly strange behaviors from a few apps, like Photoshop CS6 seems to slow down for the first minute after being opened, and only refreshing tiles of an image unless you move the cursor around. After a little bit, if finishes \"warming up\" and seems happy. I don't remember it doing this on a smaller display. This is not a issue with the monitor, but might be a display driver or application issue. I see IE10 html5 video playback of 4K youtube video does not work either, you have to use Flash for 4K. Youtube 4K video also has a lot of compression artifacts, and think 4K streaming video may just not be viable (I have 55 mbps cable modem service).Initially I was seeing the monitor image drop out every few hours, requiring power off/on with the remote to fix. Updating the firmware seems to have solved this. I also turned down the backlight to about 70 while in the service menu, as the default 100 was too bright when sitting 3 feet away. Turning down the backlight also reduced the monitor power consumption to about 75 watts, from about 100 watts. When off, my UPS says power consumption is close to zero.The display settings I'm currently using are: Contrast 61, Brightness 46, Color 48, Sharpness 0 (important for computer monitor text sharpness) and Noise reduction to off.So far (only 24 hours of ownership) I have only found three things I wish were different.The display acts like a TV as far as power management goes. This means if your computer goes into sleep/screen saver, the monitor displays a message saying \"no signal\" for a few minutes and then turns totally off. Unlike a good computer monitor, it doesn't turn back on when the computer wakes back up, you have to manually press the power button on the remote. It looks like this TV does not support DPMS, the standard use to put computer monitors into standby mode and wake them back up. This might be fixable with a firmware update, and plan to contact Seiki technical support.The second thing is it could have a better base. The base is really simple (although reasonable attractive), does not tilt or swivel, and is about 2\"-3\" above a desktop. The monitor does have mounting holes in the back, so a TV stand/wall mount is a possible solution to get optimal ergonomics. Considering this monitor was $4000-$5000 less than alternatives (the 39\" is even less), having to spend money on a mount is not so terrible.The third thing is I wish it had a DisplayPort interface. I believe this would allow 4K x 60 Hz today. The HDMI 1.4b interface only allows a maximum of 4K x 30 Hz, which for typical desktop computer use is not a major problem (the panel refreshes at 120 Hz). For gamers, and people editing 60 Hz video, and smoothest text scrolling, 60 Hz would be a better. When programming, I can see a little jitter when scrolling a text window which I'd guess is a 30 Hz artifact, although due to the resolution I can also just make edit windows twice as high and scroll half as much. This will definitely not be a firmware upgrade. One argument I have seen is current DisplayPort could not do 4K x 120 Hz for shutter glasses 3D, so Seiki working on a next generation interface would at this point be better use of their hardware engineers. Adjusting the EDID data to show 1920x1080p@120Hz as supported would be a nice firmware update too, and reports are this monitor can do this today, over the current HDMI interface, but you have to manually configure a set of display parameters. I was considering buying a 3D computer monitor, but guess I just need to buy some appropriate shutter glasses now.I would love to see either a computer/monitor OEM or Seiki themselves sell a slightly tweaked version optimized for computer use.So how does the image look? Wow best describe it. On the AMD 7750, text is super sharp, colors seem decent although perhaps not good enough for professional graphics/photography work (maybe with calibration, I'm slightly colorblind so I will have to pass on having a useful opinion). If you display a pure white screen, you can see some unevenness to the lighting on the edges, although this is not uncommon for LCD TVs. It might bother a professional graphics designer, but personally I can only see it if I make the whole screen white. A pure black screen looks quite even with no apparent light bleed, and for a LCD screen pretty black.I have not tried feeding 1080p video from anything except a computer, so can't comment on things like the upscaler quality. Some people report it as not having such a great upscaler. For use as a TV, at typical TV viewing distances, I'm not very convinced 4K is all that useful on anything less than 70\"-80\" screen. The retina display calculator (Google is this retina) says a 50\" screen at 1080p is a retina display at 78\", which is just over 6 feet way. For a computer monitor at 39\" away, yes 4K is a lot better than 1080p.I should also say the sound is not very impressive, but sound on HDMI does work. I have some $25 Logitech S220 powered speakers that sound better, although they did sounds incredible for the price, but see are not longer available (Logitech S220 2.1 Speaker System with Subwoofer). With the $4000 you saved, buy some better speakers if you want good sound.I want to take off a tiny bit on the rating, as it could be a little better in a few areas, but at this price point, software companies should buy one for every engineer. I probably would not recommend it as a 1080P TV replacement. Something like the latest Panasonic plasma TV has more TV features and a better 1080P image (Panasonic VIERA TC-P55ST60 55-Inch 1080p 600Hz 3D Smart Plasma HDTV (Includes 2 Pairs of 3D Active Glasses)).", "Date": "July 21, 2013"}, {"Title": "Works out of the box with a 2013 retina macbook pro, sort of", "Author": "Jonathan Ellis", "ReviewID": "R4OJ5D5RPILCH", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "No adapters needed to drive it (at full 4k, 30hz) with the hdmi port.Do turn off noise cancellation and dial sharpness down to zero.

I put the 50\" in the Living Room replacing the Samsung 40\" and I'm now using the 39\" Seiki as the monitor on my computerObservations of the 39\":1 - It too suffered from the intermittent blank-out that was present on my 50\" Seiki. Like the 50\" Seiki, a firmware update corrected the issue and I can game/surf the net for hours with no problems*2 - Here's the reason for the asterisk, above. After about 4 or 5 hours of gaming/surfing/watching DVDs, the TV pops up a notification that it will auto-power-off in 60 seconds unless I press a button on the Remote (or on the TV itself) This option is not something I can disable and, when the notification box appears in the middle of an epic battle in Path of Exile, it can be annoying. I have contacted Seiki about the possibility of making this a selectable option in the menu via a firmware update but I have not heard back from them regarding this issue.3 - The 30\" Seiki required a bit more tweaking to dial in the color to where I like it. Not that it was a \"big deal\", mind you, it's just something I thought I'd mention in case someone bought it and decided that, \"out of the box\" the colors were \"off\". There are plenty of online calibration sites available, and Windows itself has a monitor color calibration wizard that I used, then I tweaked it a little bit more.4 - Using the 39\" as a computer monitor, versus the 50\", is a better fit for me as I am not craning my neck to see the top of the screen anymore. My neck is far less fatigued after several hours of use than it was when I used the 50\" Seiki.5 - Even though the remote control for the 50\" is \"serviceable\". the remote control unit for the 39\" Seiki is far better. It's got a better layout, different sized buttons so you can tell, by feel alone, which buttons you're trying to manipulateI cannot create a product review on the 39\" Seiki. Amazon seems to think that this review of the 50\" serves the same as a review for the 39\" Seiki, so they won't let me post a review of the 39\" Seiki since this review of the 50 Seiki exists...odd.UPDATE #1 When I purchased this unit and came here to post my review, there were 2 reviews here that gave the unit 3 stars and 1 star. For whatever reason, they are now gone. While I have nothing but praise for the item, those dissenting voices should be heard as well. so keep in mind there were 2 people who did not think it was a great TV.Personal note on those two reviews: The reviewers were idiots who failed to do their homework before their purchase and never even color calibrated the unit and then tried to compare it to their $5k+ top of the line, comes with a happy ending included plasma, but at least they spoke up and provided some entertainment value to the debateI purchased this unit several weeks ago and it came in last week. I bought it to replace the Dell U3011 30\" LCD Monitor on my computer in order to gain some sorely needed real estate.I cannot say enough good things about it. It has so little light bleed that I had to hunt for it to find any at all. (rare for any TV in this price range)The colors are crisp clear and vibrant. Blacks were decent, not great. (You should access the Service Menu and turn down the backlight a little. It really helps)Picture Quality on my BluRays and BluRay Rips is great. Even 10-bit 720p content looks great on this panel. It's awesome to have a full web page open while watching a movie playing in a 39\" diagonal window (yeah, I actually measured it with a tape measure)As a tool for improving productivity, it's great. I can have 3 large spreadsheets open along with MS Access and I'm not spending half my time minimizing and maximizing windows.On a lark, I installed Total Annihilation to see how it would handle a 16 year old computer game and the picture was amazing (TA will run at the panel's native resolution). I have also played 7-8 hours each in Skyrim, FONV, Max Payne 3, Bioshock1,2, and Inifinite and the picture quality is awesome.One note: Running the Unengine Valley benchmark at 3840x2160 resolution at Ultra Settings with 8xAA causes much distress to my Crossfire 7970s. They aren't happy at all at having to work that hard, so I had to drop 8xAA down to 2xAA.I wasn't sure if I could live with a 30Hz refresh at 3840x2160 but after a week of using it I placed my U3011 up for sale, and I haven't looked back.The initial version of the Firmware mine came with had an issue where the resolution reset itself at random intervals. The screen would go black and, in about 2-3 seconds would reappear as if nothing had happened. Turns out a Firmware upgrade resolved the issue, and from the time I reported the issue it only took 1 day for them to correct it. Seiki seems to be very responsive to the needs of their customers and I applaud them for working out a solution as quickly as they did. I'm still waiting on Samsung to respond to the email I sent them 9 months ago about a minor issue I have with the menu on my Smart TV...go figureThere are no bells and whistles on this unit. You get a panel, some speakers, and a fair amount of connectivity options. That's it. turns out, that's really all you need. Seiki isn't trying to cram 200 options down your throat that you'll never use and charge an additional $3k for them.I hope more people take advantage of what has been a surprisingly great TV deal so that it sends a clear message to other mfgrs that they need to concentrate on getting 4k2k rolled out for less than $25k per TV (Sony, WTF are you thinking?!?!?!)", "Date": "May 10, 2013"}, {"Title": "Never even got to turn it on, horrible warranty support", "Author": "Welah", "ReviewID": "REG04GE86UWZL", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I haven't even turned this TV on and I'm already disappointed.I took it out of the box, went to assemble the stand, and found that the stand was incorrectly glued together so I can't possibly screw it in as required.In other words, I have a TV that can't stand.

I currently have 2 Radeon 7970 video cards in Crossfire and I was running 3 - 24\" Viewsonic monitors in eyefinity at 5760x1080.  I loved Eyefinity and it looks amazing in any game that supports it so I was going to be giving up my 3 monitors to go to one monitor again.  Was 4k going to be enough to wow me from my 3 monitor current setup and would my games look ok?  What I concluded was nobody really knows.  Some reviews say it works great for gaming and as a primary monitor, other people say it looks horrible and they sent it back.  Finally I decided to just order it and play with it myself and see.I ordered the Amazon Warehouse deal, the TV was currently priced at $499 and I got the warehouse deal for $395, no manual or hdmi cable and the screws for the base was missing.  None of that concerned me, I was mounting it to a wall.  I received the TV and unboxed it and thought it was a nice looking TV just sitting on my desk, it has a matte finish on the screen so its not highly reflective like my Samsung plasma set is in my living room.  I got it mounted to the wall and hooked up with a dual link DVI to HDMI cable that said it was 4k capable.  My computer wouldn't recognize it as a 4k monitor, all I could display was 1920x1080.  I had an active display port adapter that converts display port to dvi so I tried that with the dual link cable.  1920x1080.  I was starting to get frustrated.  I decided to hook up my PS3 and PS4, I read they were capable of 4k for video and photos, really I just wanted to see a 4k video to see what the hype was about.  Neither of the Playstations would go past 1080p.  Now I was really frustrated.  I drove to Wal-Mart thinking maybe my HDMI cables just weren't new enough.  Nothing at my local walmart was listed as 4k ready.  The next day I found a 4k HDMI cable at another walmart and was excited to get home from work to try it out.I noticed my secondary card in my crossfire setup had an HDMI slot so I pulled my cards and swapped them around so I wouldn't have to deal with an adapter.  After my cards were swapped, I plugged in the new HDMI card and my PC booted and went instantly to 1080p again.  I opened my control center and it finally showed 3840x2160 as an option!  I changed the resolution, the screen flashed and I was greeted to miniscule icons and my old 1920x1080 wallpaper shrunk in the center of the screen.  It looked fabulous.  I sit about 3-4 feet away from the screen and cannot see any pixels. When I get up and I am closer to the screen I still cant see the pixels.  I absolutely love the 4k resolution.  I went to youtube and found a 4k video, it looked amazing.  Everyone says you'll be amazed when you see a 2160p video for the first time, they're not wrong.  It was like seeing 1080p for the first time.  The video quality is outstanding.Time for games.  I'm currently playing the X-Com expansion pack, enemy within.  It does not support eyefinity so I was used to playing it on only one screen.  I started it up, set my resolution to 3840x2160 and my refresh rate to 30hz and played the game for hours and never noticed any kind of frame lag or ghosting.  The game looks amazing at that resolution.  I loaded Diablo 3 next and it also looks amazing.  No screen tearing or lag of any kind that I can notice.  I don't think the 30hz limit is really a hindrance in anything except first person shooters.  I played Team Fortress 2 for about 20 minutes and didn't notice any problems in it either.  I've owned the TV for almost a week now and do not regret buying it at all.  I'm actually contemplating what kind of video cards I will have to buy to get two more of these 39\" TV's so I can run eyefinity and achieve 11,520x2160.

I ordered on Tuesday and had it in my hands on Thursday. So much for the most positive part of the experience, now come the downsides:As a computer monitor it took a bit of work to get it to function at native resolution. I use Linux and an nvidia GTX770 card and I had to manually specifyOption \"ModeValidation\" \"HDMI-0: NoDFPNativeResolutionCheck, NoMaxPClkCheck, NoVertRefreshCheck\"in the device section of xorg.conf to get it to work, because the stupid nvidia driver otherwise caps maximum pixel clock at 165MHz.I have yet to get it to work in windows xp, presumably due to the same problem. Unfortunately there the setting is not so easily overridden, instead it requires a patch to the driver, and that is only available for vista and newer systems.Then there is the 30Hz maximum refresh rate at 4K: For gaming this is an obvious non-starter, but I thought I would be fine with it for desktop work. Turns out it bugs me lot more than I expected. Everything just feels much slower and less responsive. I highly recommend you try setting your crrent screen to 30Hz and work with it for a while if you are considering buying this one.1080p scaling leaves something to be desired, even though it is exacly half the panel resolution. Also, even though this display accepts 120Hz input at 1080p, it skips frames at that refresh rate, so even that resolution is not all that great for gaming.Last but not least, the color reproduction is terrible. First one needs to set the output to the usual \"limited\" color range used for TV signals, otherwise blacks drown completely and highlight are big white blobs. But even after that, looking at any color bar image for calibration (like http://www.lagom.nl/lcd-test/all_tests.php), the upper 20% of the pure colors (red, green, blue) are completely indistinguishable, and the lowest one or two disappear as well. The easiest way to fix this was to adjust the \"digital vibrance control\" on the nvidia drivers down by about 20%, at least then pictures looked somewhat natural. Before that everything looked a bit like a bollywood movie: eye-popping color without any definition in the highlights, and on top of that everybody looked kinda sun burnt. Again, i didn't expect this to bother me much, I am usually not very picky about the color performance of a display, but this one is so bad it hurt my eyes at default settings.But what about 4K content? It still looks awesone, right?Well... mostly. Most content actually doesn't look much better than on my trusty old Dell 30inch at 2560x1600. While my camera takes pictures at exactly 4Kresolution, the only additional detail I see at 4K is sensor noise. And all those 4K videos on youtube don't really look much better to me at 4K than at 2560, but the compression artifacts become a lot more visible. The only content that really profits from the resolution is still images from a good DSLR. Looking at some of those is a real \"wow-effect\", but then again you would want proper color reproduction if you're serious about photography.So in Summary: It may make a good computer monitor if you don't mind the 30Hz and have the patience to get it set up and color calibrated, but be aware that those are significant downsides which may annoy you more than you initially expected.As a TV this is completely useless, since you can't get native 4K content and 1080p actually looks worse than on a good panel with that native resolution, which you can get for significantly less money.Update: Windows7 recognizes the display as 4K out of the box.

You can still read everything if you have 20/20 vision just fine, I personally just didn't expect it to be so small, so naturally when I browse web sites I zoom in to a comfortable size.The whole point of me having 4k is for video/game/graphic resolution web browsing is an easy fix with the zoom function. I can't really see any pixels like I did on my old TV, and look at photos/4k footage is pretty mind-blowing, your monitor becomes like a window in your house really.Anyway, let's get to pros and cons.PROS- As advertised & better than I expected.- High resolution shows extremely well, no defects.- Computer detected screen right away & adjusted instantly.- Extremely inexpensive compared to competitors, still trying to figure out why outside the brand name.- Energy efficient ($17 a year to run).CONS- Can be a little rough on older graphics cards as it is literally like running 4 monitors at 1080p at the same time.- Screen needs some adjustment from the default settings, reduce sharpness & contrast + increase brightness.- Box was extremely beat up/punctured when shipped by FedEx, TV survived just fine though.- Slight lag when scrolling, I believe it's a graphics card issue however as when I adjust the display settings to zoom 150% in Windows 7, things run more smoothly.UPDATEThe lag created using 4k resolution I believe was in fact caused by my graphics card. I'm running some pretty heavy hardware (very expensive graphics cards running simultaneously). What this says is that it is not at all the TV's fault that my movement on screen lags slightly.The lag did however become unbearable for completing the tasks I do on my computer so I went ahead and switched back to my regular LED screen for difficult tasks and only use the 4K for viewing materials in high resolution.If you are experiencing lag but do not want to revert to another screen, you can always change the resolution of your display to 1080p, the lag will literally cease to exist when you reduce the resolution that drastically. You will notice initially that the aspect ratio is off, but you can fix this by trying differing aspect ratios through the buttons on the remote that comes with the TV.Also, remember, you'll probably want to adjust the brightness/contrast/sharpness to make the text appear as it does on normal monitors.", "Date": "July 27, 2013"}, {"Title": "Color fidelity", "Author": "Thejohnz", "ReviewID": "R1WHZUKR8P09ML", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I am an avid photographer specializing in nature and animal photography.  I knew, when purchasing this TV and using it as a monitor for editing,that it would be a risky endeavor.  But I would at least get some idea of how a large ultra high definition display would perform, before laying out thousands on a professional type monitor.I have yet to hook this TV to a source that can drive it at its native resolution, but I have been able to do some rudimentary comparisons in regards to color fidelity and overall brightness, contrast etc.  As others have noted, the noise filter must be off and the sharpness set to 0.  Also, it is very important to get the latest firmware.  I just received this TV two days ago and yet it had only the original firmware installed.After getting the latest firmware for the 39\" model successfully installed, I compared a number of my photos between the Seiki  and my Apple 30\" cinema display.  This Apple display is well known for its color accuracy, wide viewing angle, high resolution etc.Until my new Macbook Pro 13\" retina arrives next week I am unable to drive the Seiki with anything except my IPad retina notepad.However, that did not prevent me from looking at the color variance relative to the same photo displayed on the Apple 30\" display.First, some good news.  When viewed strait on, the colors, brightness, contrast etc. of the two monitors were nearly Identical.  I really expected to see problems with the Seiki but it really looked good.  I did get into the service mode on the Seiki (Menu 0000) to adjust the individual color channels, and to my surprise, they had already been factory set to Red 141, Green 127, Blue 112.  These settings must have been due to the latest firmware upgrade, and I think someone at Seiki has done his homework.As to other adjustments, I did set the monitor for Warm, Color down to 35, and Backlight to 80.Now for the caveat here.  The Seiki most likely is using a TN type display which, frankly, is not the best type for computer displays.  When the viewing angle is more that about 30 degrees off axis, the contrast begins to degrade significantly, and color changes occur as well.  But for one or two viewers it is possible to be centered enough to avoid seeing any of this.  It looks as though the best viewing is about 3' away.I am very excited to see my photos displayed at 8mp and will update this review when I have the equipment to do so.  Stay tuned!Update 4/29/14I now have my new Macbook Pro 13\" Retina connected to the Seiki 39\" TV.  No problems in getting the TV to properly display at full 4k resolution.  The 30HZ maximum rate is not a problem for me and does not effect editing or viewing photos.  My best photos look fantastic on the Seiki.  But beware!  You will find many of your \"great\" photos not so great when shown at such a high resolution.  I immediately see flaws that were not obvious on my 30\" Apple cinema display. Size matters when critically looking at photos! I personally feel I will now be able to edit my photos to a higher standard.Update 4/30/14Since I wanted a close match of this Seiki TV to my Apple monitors, I spent quite a few hours attempting to adjust the Seiki for color, contrast, brightness etc. I did this two ways. First I compared 100's of my photos simultaneously on two Apple monitors along with the Seiki TV. I then did some checking with red, green, and blue pixel photos and a grey card, all downloaded from the internet.  I was able to get a close match but not perfect. It is the green channel that is a little off on the Seiki, and one can only partially fix it. The Seiki green pixels have a slight bias towards blue.  It comes out in the display at times on photos with very green items such as grass. The red and blue channels are very close to the Apple displays and with adjustment worked out great.My general settings are (1) Warm, (2) 48 on contrast, (3) 50 on brightness, (4) 33 on color, (5) 80 on backlight and (6) sharpness set to 0.In the Factory Menu (gotten into by punching in 0000 after the menu button) I set the red gain to 145, the green to 117, and the blue to 103. (the blue really over powers the display if not turned down)I set the red offset to 469, green offset to 510 and the blue offset to 483. (these were set using a photo of a grey card as it is otherwise difficult to adjust these controls). A word of warning.  Be very careful when in the Factory Menu. Best not to go into areas that you do not understand. I got into trouble on one setting that started making the TV endlessly cycle through red, green and blue screens.  I had to hold down the power on/off button for several seconds to fix it).I am now very happy with the way my photos look. Of course, this TV is not going to perfectly match high quality monitors for color accuracy, but I was pleasantly surprised how close I got.", "Date": "April 24, 2014"}, {"Title": "Better than I expected", "Author": "Amazon Customer", "ReviewID": "R18D1XN2M6PCIP", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I bought this as a 4k display for use with my MacBook Pro.

I had to do a lot of color adjusting, etc... but now it's perfect.  It's amazing to me that the macbook pro can drive it's retina display and the 4k display at the same time.NOTE: The first one I got was damaged.  It was like there was black paint on the screen in spots.  However, I called amazon, and another tv was at my door in less than 24 hours.  Another hour later they came and picked up the broken one.  Amazon has completely amazed me for their service.", "Date": "February 20, 2014"}, {"Title": "Ideal for 4k video previewing (but NOT grading!) and for huge desktop real estate.", "Author": "Jim May", "ReviewID": "RWNMDODNT3ZWJ", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "This is for the 39\" version.  (Note to Amazon: pooling reviews pollutes the data stream and makes more filtration effort necessary for shoppers like me trying to get specific information.  The Seikis differ in some key points between models.)The negatives:1. HDMI connectors aren't ideally placed, the ones on the back require some wedging if you are using thicker cables (recommended for 4k content), and I get the distinct impression that they are held on by the solder joints.  Not good for frequent disconnect/reconnection.2. DO NOT USE THIS SCREEN ALONE IN APPLICATIONS WHERE COLOR IS IMPORTANT.  There is no way to get rid of that horrid color processing that I know of; it's always there, and worse: there's some sort of a lookup table that is badly glitched.  This is best detected by looking up a color cube image (like the \"Color Cube Red Corner\" on Wikimedia) and moving the browser from the Seiki to another monitor.  You'll see peculiar bands, especially where magenta transitions to pure red.  Similar artifacts can be seen elsewhere.  I first noticed this when I saw strange greenish bits in the yellow stripe on lagom.nl Contrast test page.3.  The base is attached with five coarse-threaded screws driven into plastic.  Seriously.  Put the base on, and LEAVE IT ON.  One of the five holes in mine was already stripped out.4.  The 30Hz refresh rate and lag:  30Hz reminds me of the old days of serial mice on Windows 3.1 as I move the pointer around, and the lag is noticeable, especially if you take a window, straddle it across the Seiki and another monitor, and move it around.  However, I don't game on this screen, I have a 23\" Dell for that, and the lag can be made negligible for most interface purposes by turning off Aero (vsync, specifically) for Windows users.And now here's why it still gets four stars:  it's biggest weaknesses, as noted above, do not impact my uses for this screen.  Here's the positives:1. PRICE. Grabbed this during the price drops after Black Friday, $426.  I love the fact that Seiki is trying to knock the wheels off the big players' \"early adopter pricing\" little red wagon.  We've been stuck at 1080p for consumer mass-market panels for nine years now, and the tech advancement behind the scenes hasn't stopped.2.  SPAAAACE.  I use Adobe CS6, Lightwave 3D and Houdini professionally, and these apps - particularly Lightwave and its dated interface - open up so many panels that I get overwhelmed with opening, closing and stacking them even with 2x 1080p screens.  Run more than one app at once, or more than one copy of an app, and it just gets worse from there.  For a few weeks I ran this with two other HD screens and had a twelve megapixel desktop.3. Decent color.  Oh yes, even with that screwed-up issue noted in #2 above, the overall color looks quite good *after* massaging the settings: the *first* thing you need to do, of course, is to kill off that stupid \"Sharpness\" setting to 0.  I also took the \"Color\" slider down to 26 (out of 100) to minimize that horrible color processing.  Once done, the screen is still not at all color *accurate*, but is at least respectable; mine has a slight yellow cast in comparison to my Dell 23\" IPS, but it's no worse a variance than that between the Dell and my older VA panel Viewsonic.  (This Seiki is also a VA screen, and has similar viewing angle traits.)4. Four Kay.  I can now view *most* of my Canon 5D mkI photography at 1:1, and it's like viewing transparencies on a big lightbox.  Of all the 4k samples I've been able to find, from such cameras as the Red and Sony FS700 (sic?), shockingly the sharpest of them all are the ones shot on a Samsung Galaxy Note 3.  These have all the usual issues with phone video - low dynamic range, wonky white balance, horrific jello cam.... but SHARP.  The lens on that phone is incredible, it's sharp corner to corner (and makes GoPro 4k, by comparison, look like they equipped it with the lens from a security camera).  The Seiki shows these videos at native resolution and frame rate, and they are amazing.  The same goes for timelapses shot on a Rebel t1i.  Wow!(Youtube 4k, on the other hand, is largely a waste of time for testing.  Look for non-streamed downloads using H.264 codecs; the Galaxy Note shoots straight into that.)5.  Tested under Windows 7 and using an NVIDIA GTX660 and then a 760, it was plug and play.  Runs fine from DVI and from HDMI.  I tested with a good quality Monoprice HDMI cable I had on hand from a few years ago, haven't yet tried the supplied blue cable.6.  Yes, I tried Minecraft too. No issues other than the 30fps frame rate.  I wouldn't do any serious twitch gaming on this, though some have tried.Other random notes:After a day of looking at this thing, all my 1080p screens suddenly look like screen-doored fuzzfests.Almost all of my 1080p camcorder footage, shot on a Panasonic SDT750 (a 3 chip camcorder that shoots good quality 1080p60, one of the better consumer cams out there), looks meh on this screen, even when viewed via decent (NVIDIA) computer upscaling.  I'm glad I got a deal on a used version of that camera.Since this works fine as is, I've not updated the firmware from the shipping version, which is dated \"August 26\", and likely won't until I hear from reliable sources that they've added a no-processing or \"game\" mode.I'm not using this as a TV.  I don't watch much, and we have a 42\" which is fine for that purpose.  This thing is a much better working monitor than a TV, given its crappy upscaler and HDMI 1.4b limitations.", "Date": "December 28, 2013"}, {"Title": "Makes for an impressive computer monitor", "Author": "RScott", "ReviewID": "RKFH7LFXFHLJR", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "*** UPDATE #2 ***I ended up buying the 39\" version when the price dropped one day.It is really awesome. I am still using my old monitor as well, until I adjust to the 39\" 4K monitor.I did have problems with the 39\" with it intermittently losing the HDMI connection or something (using Intel HD 4600 with a 4770k processor), causing a black screen for a few seconds. This would happen frequently, often a few times a few seconds apart, never going more than 30-60 minutes without it happening. It would not happen at 1080p, or using it as a TV. I updated the firmware, with no luck. For some reason, when set to 30Hz and the screen went black, Intel would show it as 29Hz. At one point, I tried 24Hz and after the screen went black Intel reported it as 23Hz. It was strange; I think there may be an Intel driver issue. I happened to try changing the refresh rate to 25Hz, and it has worked flawlessly for several days.So if you have an issue with intermittent black screens, you may want to try setting your computer to use a 25Hz refresh rate.*** UPDATE #1 ***After about a week, I returned the TV/monitor.  I loved it -- but for some reason, as soon as I started using it, my eyes started hurting.  After several days, the problem didn't go away.  I'm not sure if it was a coincidence, the 30hz refresh at 4K, my eyes moving more due to the large size, or something else.  It was tough returning it, but I didn't have much of a choice.  Since I cannot see that issue being Seiki's fault, I'm keeping the rating at a full 5 stars.  I thought it would be helpful to update the review to include this, however, just in the off chance that other people have a similar issue (if so, please comment...).*** END OF UPDATE ***This review is about this TV as a computer monitor (for non-gaming use).  That said, if you are buying this as a TV, make sure that you understand that [1] non-4K content (almost everything today) needs decent upscaling by something other than the TV, and [2] you may need to calibrate the TV (at the very least, try turning off noise filtering).PROS:o This makes for an incredible computer monitor!  The 4K resolution lets it function like 4-6 monitors, all on a single screen.  Wow!o The monitor is hugeo The service menu lets you lower the backlighting (I cut the power from around 130W down to 45W, and my eyes like it better)o An HDMI 1.4 cable was included (a pleasant surprise)o The price is right; I can justify the price for the increase in my productivityo No dead pixels.  I haven't seen a single report of a Seiki 4K screen with dead pixels; that suggests that these TVs are well made.CONS:o It takes a few seconds to start after the power is turned off.SETUP TIPS ['borrowed' from other reviews]:o For gaming, you may want to disable ALLOW GPU SCALING in your video card, which may cause lag,o For 4K gaming, if there is lag, try turning off VSYNC (which may add tearing, but reduces lag),o If you have audio lag, have the audio go through the TV,o Set video card to RGB 4:4:4 LIMITED (rather than FULL), which may provide better grey scale gradients,o Turn off noise reduction and sharpness (set it to 0) for use as a computer monitor,o Go to the Seiki website and download the latest firmware,o In the service menu, try turning down the backlighting,o Turn off 'Blue Screen' for a better experience when the computer shuts off the videoI think it is amazing that Seiki came out with a 4K TV for just 4% of the cost of the first mainstream 4K TV less than a year after it was released (the Sony XBR-84X900).  This is brand-new technology, and Seiki was very quick to come out with a very cost effective TV/monitor.I wanted to buy the TV to use as a computer monitor to increase my screen \"real estate\".  Before this, I had a 22\" 1,920x1080 monitor and a 19\" 1,280x1024 monitor.  I now have about 2.5x as many pixels, with a single monitor.  I oversee 7 servers, so I am often connected to multiple computers, have many programs running, and have to wait for various tasks to end.  Switching between computers/programs gets very tiresome -- and without being able to see all windows/computers I am working on, I can easily forget about something I am doing.  Using this TV as a monitor, I can have 3 1280x1020 windows on the top half of the screen, with one good-sized 1920x1080 main screen on the bottom right, with even more space on the bottom left.In my opinion, this usage is going to be where 4K TV's really take off -- to me, it seems a much, much better value than using it as a TV (where there is so little 4K content available yet).  It's really like getting 4-6 monitors built into one screen.As far as colors and such, everything looks good to me.  I went through the recommendations I had seen here, and the Windows calibration tool.  I am far from an expert as far as colors on screens go, however.I did go into the service menu, which I highly recommend for reducing the backlighting (Others->Backlight; the default is 100, but I set mine to 15).  Just be careful in the service menu, do NOT press the left/right arrows except when changing a setting.  Twice in the service menu when I didn't think I was setting something, sure enough there was a change.  Just going into the overscan settings (without changing anything) caused problems.  If all else fails, power off the TV with the button on the side, and/or reset to factory settings.  If in doubt, pressing the \"MENU\" button on the remote (more than once if in nested menus) gets you out of the service menu.  To get to the service menu, press MENU followed by the zero button 4 times, but be careful.One other setting I changed was the Blue Screen option to OFF.  That way, when the computer turns off the display (power management settings), the screen is black (with \"NO VIDEO\" on the screen), and eventually the TV is smart enough to turn off.  And the TV does only use <1W when off (it registers 0.0 on my Kill-a-Watt).  It takes a few seconds to power back on (versus less than a second for my old monitor), but you can't really fault a TV for that (it isn't marketed as a monitor).It is an entry-level TV, but that isn't an issue for a monitor.  And it is made by a company that many people are unfamiliar with.  But between the 1-year replacement warranty and no reports of dead pixels, I've got quite a bit of confidence in the product.  When I ordered, I did purchase a 4-year warranty with SquareTrade, to be on the safe side.One final note -- if you buy this as a monitor, make sure to check out gigapixel pictures (often 100s of images stitched together, totaling billions of pixels; search for 'gigapan').  You can zoom in/out of these pictures for incredible detail.  They look nice on a regular monitor, but on a 4K monitor using the full screen they look incredible.", "Date": "July 19, 2013"}, {"Title": "Using as a Linux monitor", "Author": "Blairfus", "ReviewID": "R1JC5MZYLCFQX4", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Working great at full 3840x2160_30 with a Radeon 6870 using an Accel B086B-003B-2 DP-to-HDMI active adapter. Using Catalyst 14.1 Beta under ElementaryOS, kernel 3.11.0-17-generic. This is probably the first monitor purchase this decade I haven't had any regrets about.To those of you who may be reticent to take the plunge on what seems like a good fit, I'd like to address some of the concerns I had and encountered while researching this product on HN and other forums.Refresh and Gaming:The 30Hz refresh at 4K is a complete non-issue for office and productivity tasks, like typing, 3D modeling, and reading. Video also displays well, and I broke in my TV by streaming a 4K video from Vimeo. I don't play any twitchy shootemups that require mice with special buttons that help you aim between pixels, but I'd say that if you're willing to spend the money on components and peripherals that enable that sort of dedication to your gaming, you should also buy monitors known to have been specifically designed for that. Windowed games (Broken Age, Planescape: Torment, Torchlight 2) displayed and ran well at 2160. I generally switch to 1920x1080 when playing fullscreen games (like Skyrim and Dark Souls), and the performance is excellent, although not better than on a 60Hz monitor. Apparently the board that drives the 39\" displays has fewer components than the 50\" model's, and to better focus on the 4K capabilities, Seiki made concessions in the 39\" model's 1080 120Hz performance. This is largely what people are referring to when talking about the frame skipping or \"not true 120Hz\" issues, as well as the basis for the recommendation to crossflash to the 50\" firmware. I also recommend the 50\" firmware over the 0828 39\" firmware because text rendering appears cleaner to me. If your livelihood doesn't revolve around you being able to read text while it's scrolling or in a window that's being moved, then you'll make it over the low hurdle of accepting 30Hz.Color Accuracy and Calibration:This display is not certified for accurate color reproduction for producing print or digital media, does not conform to ICC profile standards, and nor does it claim otherwise. Does it look at least as good as other comparable LED TVs on the market? Yes, much better even due to its near 180 degree viewing angle, excellent DPI, and attractive price. It's a device engineered as a TV which many are repurposing as a computer monitor for its resolution, not its color accuracy. I believe it also comes completely uncalibrated, which is nicer than believing that someone would ship a TV with such terrible image settings. Out of the box, sharpness is set to a non-zero value, which anyone who has owned a TV since hi-def content or Blu-Ray has existed knows only makes high resolution signals looks terrible. It also ships with DCC (dynamic contrast control) active, which is why your carefully calibrated settings looked terrible the first time you opened another window. You'll have to play around a bit to get it to your liking. To change these settings (and more!), open the Factory Menu by pressing the [Menu] button followed by [0] [0] [0] [0]. This is also how you get to...Crossflashing:Unless they have a newer hardware revision, as of 02/2014, the 50\" firmware works better on the 39\" TVs than the 39\" firmware. To install it, download the firmware archive from the Seiki website, decompress it, and copy the .img file to the top level directory of a MS-DOS/FAT32 formatted USB stick. Plug this stick into the TV, open the Factory Menu in the way I described above, then choose Software Upgrade. The screen will go blank, and the LED will blink alternating blue and red until it finishes. When the screen comes back on, perform the initial setup it prompts, and then it will be ready for use. Any settings you've changed will have to be reentered.Overall, it's a fantastic display for someone who needs half a dozen windows open at all times with a DPI that also makes text or any size crisp and readable. I hope this helps someone who's on the fence make a more informed purchasing decision when considering this model.", "Date": "February 14, 2014"}, {"Title": "4k Connection Problems, Invisible Customer

Intel HD 4600 graphics (Haswell).Since the beginning, the 4k (3840x2160@30hz) signal was inconsistent; the display would regularly blank out and then redetect the 4k signal, this takes 5 seconds, after which it works again.  This would happen a few dozen times in the first few minutes and then periodically (perhaps once every few minutes) since then.I tried updating the firmware; in the release notes it mentioned something about modified timings for better 4k performance.  This had no effect.I updated my graphics drivers and that did seem to help somewhat.  After that I had only \"acceptable\" (meaning that I can get work done) blanking, and while it's frustrating to be interrupted a few times an hour, the amount of screen area and the great image quality make up for that somewhat.I contacted customer service via email, and they created a ticket for my issue.  After one month there was no response, update, anything.  There's no link where I can check on the status of the ticket, and the responses are sent from a noreply@ email address.Today when I came back from lunch, the display wouldn't come on at all -- blank screen, although the power light was on (blue), as was the backlight.  Pressing the info button on the remote, I see that it was set as 3840x2160@30Hz, as it should be, but it doesn't attempt to draw the screen.  The computer seems to think everything is normal, as I can move the mouse across to other displays.I was unable to get any display output @30Hz, 1080p@60Hz was the best I could do.  Whenever I selected a resolution@30Hz, it would show 3840x2160@30Hz and fail to display anything (black screen).I called the customer service number on the back of the user manual and waited on hold.  During that time I tried all the different HDMI cables and ports, different resolutions, different refresh rates, to no avail.At one point, the display came back up.  I hadn't done anything different, the settings were the same as those I had working previously.I waited on hold for 30 minutes.  I never got through to anyone.  This is during their stated business hours, mind you.Now the display is blanking every 15 seconds.  BLANK.  Try getting any work done when you can only see the screen half the BLANK time.One BLANK star.  I'm not the only person to have this BLANK issue.  Seiki is aware they have this BLANK problem but their BLANK customer service is BLANK nonexistent.  I didn't have 30 minutes to BLANK waste and I don't have the BLANK patience to work like this.  The BLANK monitor may end up in the BLANK trash.  BLANK!  What a waste.Update: Called again the next day.  After 35 minutes, the service line goes to voicemail.Update 2: 24 hours after my initial review, the TV will no longer turn on.  The amber/blue power light at the bottom stays amber when I press power using either the remote or the buttons on the back.Update 3: I unplugged the TV, plugged it back in, and it came on, but kept blanking out and then turned itself off again after a few hours.  I swapped HDMI cables and it has definitely settled down and started working again (at least it has been for the last hour).  I really enjoy the high resolution so unless I hear from Seiki (not holding my breath) I'm going to tough it out.Update 4: no blanking after almost 5 hours with the new HDMI cable.  I credit J. Hay who left me a link in the comments; I had previously tried a high-quality HDMI cable that didn't help, but it was a longer cable.  The new 6-footer is doing well.  I upped my rating to two stars.  The product itself gets 5 stars, but non-existent customer service is not acceptable, and I am  offended that they made me wait on hold for 35 minutes to leave a voice message that got no response.", "Date": "January 2, 2014"}, {"Title": "stunning  future proof tv & such a steal", "Author": "g...", "ReviewID": "RW4PGTJDXTXR3", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I got the 39inch model to use as both a monitor for my new (old silver Mac Pro) and to hookup and watch movies using iTunes and Roku.I love the concept of this tv.

I would definitely give 5 stars or even higher for its excellent performance except the technical support is some what lacking.  They are always busy and slow at getting back.Update 9/10.2013To make sure this monitor plays 4K right, you will have to update the firmware to the latest version.  Unfortunately when you download the firmware from Seiki.com website the instruction on the website does not do it.  The proper wave to do it is,1) Download the firmware to a clean USB thumb drive, meaning the thumb drive has no other file.2) Before download convert the file to microsoft format by extrating the file to a new file.  Without the conversion theTV will not see the file.3) After inserting the thumb drive into TV USB port, press manu buttom followed by four zeros.  This will bring up a window on the screen to prompt you to click upgrade firmware.4) Be patient and wait for couple minute for the TV to complete upload.  When it is done it will show complete.  Exit manu. Turn off TV and unplug the thumb drive.  You are home. It is simple.5) My TV now plays all 4K program from my OPPO 103 and tells me it is in 3640X2160 resolution by showing the info on top right corner whenever you press the info button on the remote.  It also brings all my photos to 4K resolution and brilliant color.  It is great!Update 9/10/2013I am now watching all my low grade dvd and photos on the Seiki 4K monitor by upscaling to 4K through my Oppo 103.  The improvements are amazing.  I now get great satisfaction watching my favorite photos and dvds again and found more vibrant colors and resolution.

Fantastic for General Computer Use", "Author": "George \"(predestined before the beginning of ...", "ReviewID": "R11TW4Z8G307O9", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Additional Screen Lag Information: Updated 2013-07-17----------------------------------The screen lag at 4k & 30Hz appears to be caused by the Radeon video card because at 30Hz and 1080p, there is no noticeable lag.  If I get a chance to try an Nivida card, I will update the results.Power Saving Issue Resolved:  Updated 2013-07-17----------------------------The TV has a service mode which can be entered by MENU 0000.In the factory Serivce mode under OTHER -> POWER ON MODETurning that on fixes my issues with power saving.  I plug the TV into the \"Switched\" ported on my UPS (uninterruptable power supply).  My UPS has an energy saving feature. When my computer goes into STANDBY, the switched ports on the UPS turn off automatically and the TV plugged into it thus turns off.The factory setting allows the TV to turn on automatically when the TV gets AC power, which is what happens when my computer comes out of standby.Also in the factory service mode, I was able to turn the backlight down from 100 to 70.  This reduced the power from 79W down to about 55W.  More importantly, it allows me to set the user brightness controls at 50 which provides the best grayscale reproduction!I later found out the backlight setting doesn't get saved through a power cycle so it doesn't help much.Summary:  UPDATED 2013-07-13--------It works well as a computer monitor except that it lacks proper power management for day-to-day use.  Overall I am however impressed by the value.  It's is insane how anyone can sell a 4k monitor at this price range.  I'd recommend it to anyone needing more real estate for computer programming and general computer usage.  It does not make a good 1080p TV however.UPDATED 2013-07-13:I've found a couple of fixes that reduce lag enough that makes it suitable for FPS:1. When running At 4k resolution, turn VSYNC off.  (Yes, you'll see some tearing, but it's way better than having the lag.)2. Run at 1080p @ 60 Hz or higher.If you're like me, you might be wondering \"what's the catch?\"  How can anyone sell a 39\" 4k monitor at prices below just about all 30\" 2560x1600 monitors out there?  Well, I have NO IDEA how they are doing it, but there' no catch here.  It's the real deal and this monitor has superb value.Pros----+ Large, 38.5\" diagonal+ 4k resolution is AMAZING+ Bright+ no dead pixels, no stuck pixels+ Color looks good+ Very low cost+ Compatible with Radeon HD6000 series+ has reasonable speakers+ multiple input sources+ includes a TV tuner (which I don't use)+ USB reader for media (music  + pictures, I also do not use this feature)Cons:------ Lack of power management- Uneven brightness across screen- 1080p doesn't look good- For FPS gaming, must run with VSYNC off at 4k resolution to reduce/eliminate lag.Decision:  39\" or 50\"?----------------------Seiki has both a 39\" (actual is 38.5) and a 50\".  Which one is a better choice?  I feel the 39\" is the better choice.  Ultimately, the size of the screen affects viewing distance. (Read on for more details)A reason to get the 39\" is if your desk isn't big enough.  Another reason to get the 39\" is the price differential.  $700 vs $1000.  The 50\" is essentially 40% more money, but has almost 69% more surface area.  (Note that additional surface area is not necessarily useful as it's not an increase in pixel count.)Viewing differences:  In terms of aesthetics, the 39\" looks like a monster on my desk, so I'm guessing the 50\" would look ridiculous.  To get the maximum benefits of the higher resolution, I have placed the monitor approximately 20\" from my eyes.  Depending on how I'm sitting, that distance can increase to about 30\".  That's the approximate range of distances at which I like to view this monitor.  I have noticed one negative about viewing such a large, flat, screen from such a close distance:  at 20\" viewing distance, the corners of the screen are effectively viewed at angles of approximately 50 degrees.  This makes the content at the edges a bit less comfortable for viewing due to he extreme angle.  The monitor stand is not adjustable.  It sits a bit low for me.  If I raise the monitor up about 5\"o that my eyes are at the same height as the center of the screen, I can reduce the corner viewing angles to about 44 degrees.If I move the monitor back, the viewing angles become less extreme, but the pixels looks smaller such that the benefits of the 4k resolution are slightly negated.I had a brief moment of \"buyer's remorse\" when I though the 50\" would have allowed me to set the monitor back further and thus reduce the extreme viewing angles, but when I calculated the difference in viewing angles with the larger monitor, I realized that it would not have made any difference to perceived viewing angles.  Since the 50\" is wider, I'd have to set it back to a viewing position of 26\" (30% more) to get the same viewing angles as my 39\".  If I set it back 6\" more inches, then the effective pixel size also gets smaller.  In other words, there no real benefit in terms of viewing angle with getting a bigger monitor, however, the larger monitor does allow an increase viewing distance, which may be beneficial if there are multiple viewers of the screen.In terms of DPI (dots per inch) or dot density, the 39\" has 114 DPI.  (The 50\" has 88DPI.)  As a relative comparison, the 39\" monitor's DPI is the same as a 1080p monitor with a 19.25\" diagonal.  The 50\" monitor's DPI is equivalent to a 1080p monitor that is 25\" in diagonal.For me, I upgraded from two 20\" LCDs (100 DPI) and the Seiki 39\" does have noticeable smaller pixels (at 114DPI).  Also note that with multiple monitors, I can turn the monitors at an angle and form an arch so the viewing angle for each monitor is less extreme.Video Card Compatibility------------------------This monitor does not have a DisplayPort.  It uses HDMI.  The maximum framerate at 4k resolution is 30Hz.  Before I bought the Seiki, I searched all over the internet to see if my current video card, a Radeon HD 6870-512MB, would drive this monitor.  I could not find any conclusive information, and furthermore, a spec sheet from AMD indicated the HD7000 series supported 4k monitors, but the HD6000 series did not.  I ended up ordering a HD7870, but it's still in transit.  To my surprise, the HD6870 works perfectly with Seiki.  It fired right up when I connected the monitor.  I didn't have to adjust any settings on either the TV or PC for it to work.  I didn't even reboot my computer.  I just put the computer into standby, switched monitors, then woke the computer from sleep.I have noticed that while my computer is booting, while it's in the BIOS screen, the monitor will display nothing at times.  It's inconsistent between boots.  Sometimes, parts of the bios screen will show, other times, the screen will remain black until the Windows logo.(As a side note, if you plan to get a new video card for this monitor, Windows 8.1 is reportedly supporting OpenCL which the Radeons are 2x as fast as Nvidia, for the same price point.)Gaming ** UPDATED.  LAG ISSUES RESOLVED **-------I will start by saying that I have a steam account and while I game occasionally, it's not high on my priority list.  In terms of speed, the monitor is about on par with other 1080p monitors.  However, put the resolution to 4k and there's noticeable lag if VYSNC is enabled.  Disable VSYNC and everything is quite reasonable.  Originally, I had a lot of lag at 1080p, but I think it was because I had \"ALLOW GPU SCALING\" turned on in the Catalyst Control Center.Some older DirectX games have trouble running at 4k resolution.  For example, it took me a while to get Rise Of Nations to run at 3840.  Dungeon Siege would not run at 4k.  Most of the newer titles run fine at 4k (albeit the lag.)I also notice the lag when watching videos within a browser at 4k resolution.  The audio leads the video ever so slightly if I'm using the audio of the sound card instead of the HDMI audio out.TV--I don't watch much TV; I don't even have cable or disk.  As a test, I did switch my computer to 1080p resolution to test the image and the desktop looks terrible compared to a standard 1080p monitor.  I'm guessing the same would occur with TV/video usage.  If the main purpose is for TV watching, I'd highly recommend you get a regular 1080p set for now.  4k content is not mainstream.  1080p doesn't look good on this monitor.Picture & Color---------------The monitor does have a little bit of uneven brightness, but for application use it's not noticeable.  I've attached a picture to show the variation on a grey image, but due to the exposure, I'd say it's much more exaggerated than what I see sitting in front of it.Colors look fine to me, but I'm not doing any calibrated photo work to scrutinize the color.  Photos look great in my opinion.I created a series of native resolution images to check for dead pixels.  Images include white, black, red, green, blue, and then four corresponding checked patterns for each color: 2 black/color checkered, 2 white/colored checkered, at even and odd pixels spacings.  I found NO DEAD PIXELS or NO STUCK PIXELS EITHER!  AMAZING that I couldn't even find one defect out of over 8M pixels.Settings--------For computer usage, I suggest setting the video card to RGB 4:4:4 LIMITED (rather than FULL).  On a grey-scale gradient, it allows a better range of color display from full black to full white with more shades of grey in-between.For the monitor, turn off sharpness and noise reduction.Complaints----------I have one other gripe with this monitor, and that is with the power management, or lack thereof.  I'm not sure how long I'd have to leave the monitor on before it'll go into power saving mode, but there is a possibility that this unit has to be turned off manually.  Unlike a normal computer monitor, this unit does not go into standby when the computer is turned off nor does it \"wake up\" automatically when the computer is turned on.  The monitor must be powered on and off manually.Conclusions-----------I'm reasonably satisfied with this purchase.  If Seiki could figure out how to fix the power management, this would be a perfect monitor.  Given the price, I'm giving this one a 5-star recommendation due to the impressive value.", "Date": "July 13, 2013"}, {"Title": "Probably a fine TV, not a good computer/art monitor (edit: it is a decent monitor)", "Author": "SciArt Guy", "ReviewID": "R1OWYOXVRFQ6LX", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I am picky about imagery---I notice artifacts in video compression, dislike excessive unsharp mask, detect mismatched color temperatures, and nitpick over brightness details and aspect ratios. I am a digital artist and create very high-resolution imagery, and bought this monitor for daily use as my primary computer monitor. I have little intention of using it to watch broadcast UHD TV, don't care about 3D or Smart TV, and don't even watch Blu-ray movies much. The Seiki seemed like a winner, for a price that I can afford.In summary: this is a screen for television, not art or computer monitors. And it has some annoying habits that are hard to work around. (Edit: I will try the xrandr modelines posted by the previous reviewer; this may affect my rating and comments.)Pros: this monitor truly does have 3840x2160 pixels, and that part is great. I put some full-resolution JPGs on a USB stick and viewed them using the built-in file browser. (It doesn't read PNGs!) The images looked like a large printed transparency over a lightbox. It was awesome. I wish I could turn down the sharpness (televisions should always have a \"game\" mode which turns off all the always-poorly-done image processing and let the signal go through unhindered, but this screen does not offer that), but I can't, even though the manual states that in \"User\" picture mode I should be able to. If anybody knows how to turn the sharpness down, I would love to hear about it! (see edit)Cons: a lot. The screen brightness is not very even: the edges noticeably dimmer than the middle (when viewing from ~3'). There is a large blue bar light at the bottom middle of the frame that I'll need to tape over to eliminate. Worse, I cannot get a 1920x1080 pixel signal to fill the screen! There outermost 20-30 pixels are black, which cuts off most of the desktop toolbars. With the NVIDIA setup tool, I can eliminate that overscan, but then I only get ~1840x1014 pixels (that is NOT 1080p) AND those pixels are poorly scaled up by the NVIDIA driver so that small text is difficult to read (some strokes are sharp, others fuzzy). In addition, without being able to turn the sharpness down, everything (in all resolution modes) looks posterized and overly unsharp-masked like a Russian magazine from the 1980s. Images that look great on a real 1920x1200 computer monitor (like my older LaCie 324) look very bad---detail is wiped out in the posterization, and edges are hyper-accentuated. (Again, once I try the previous reviewer's modelines, this may improve.)Once I am able to get a newer video card that supports the full resolution and figure out how to turn off all sharpening, this might become a useful computer monitor. Until then, though, the Seiki SE50UY04 remains a possibly-watchable television, and completely unusable for critical artwork.EDIT (2013-06-11): Originally 3 stars, upgraded to 4 stars nowI installed a new GTX660Ti last night and some of the problems have been rectified. Windows 7 correctly uses the full 3840x2160 pixel resolution (after a second reboot). The \"Sharpness\" control becomes available at the full resolution, and cranking that all the way down to \"0\" eliminates the horrible unsharp-mask effect that causes all dark text to have a white halo (and vice versa). Plus, there is no overscan (the image goes right to the screen edges). I have not booted into Linux to try the suggested modelines.One new deficiency that I now notice is that in 3640x2160p30, the image or backlight appears to flicker. I don't recall seeing that at 1080p60, and I am not convinced yet that it isn't my imagination.And while viewing images, I still think that the posterization-like effect has not been removed (there appear to be larger blocks of color instead of each pixel having its own, unique color. I sought out very high quality images (I make them sometimes), and this effect did not go away. This monitor will probably still annoy color/graphics experts.EDIT (2013-06-14): Really liking it nowI'm running some OpenGL artwork on it now, and it is remarkably sharp, and surprisingly not jerky. I had expected the 30Hz framerate to make the resulting motion look bad, but we were all surprised at how smooth it looks. Plus, with most of the screen dark, I no longer notice backlight flickering (which may have just been my eyes). The new problem is that at full-resolution, it's hard to find your mouse pointer on the screen.Graphics programmer alert: use FreeGLUT instead of the older GLUT if you want to run anything fullscreen. The old GLUT doesn't recognize the resolution mode.EDIT (2013-06-24): Price paidI paid $1386 a few weeks ago, but search for \"amazon price history\" for price logging info.", "Date": "June 7, 2013"}, {"Title": "Died after one day.", "Author": "Lukasz Gandecki", "ReviewID": "R1BNRR8MNMXCAV", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "EXTREMELY DISAPPOINTED.tldr: Died after one day.

In this case, I would turn off the tv, unplug it from power for a couple of seconds turn it on and it worked just fine. A little annoying, but, still, usable. Once it \"died\", turning black in the middle of work, I turned it off and on and it worked fine.Today I came back from school and tried to turn it on. Red light switched to blue, backlight would turn on, and that's it. I tried the trick with unplugging, waiting and plugging back but nothing.I called SEIKI exactly 28 minutes and 32 seconds ago and still waiting for the representative.I've been plugging it in to the same power source I've been using for my two other displays and my mac for months without any problems. I unplugged everything else to make sure it gets enough electricity but still, the same result.I've seen complaints like that from other people.

I have access to some other MBP's (2011 and 2010) and I will test them and update the compatibility results soon.---------------------------------Quick Down and Dirty...Does it work?YESConditions...1. You must reduce the refresh rate (currently running at 3840x2160 @ 18hz). I cannot confirm a higher refresh rate at the moment but will do so later if I can get more.2. You need an active adapter (for mini display-port  --->  HDMI 1.4 (tv side))Accell B086B 008B UltraAV DisplayPort Adapter3. Some display adjustments required to force non-native resolution. (SwitchResX software)[...] (download the free trial - not sure if it will continue to run after trial or just throw reminders)4. Preset picture modes are brutal (in the instance of my specific hardware used). Requires custom settings or will look completely washed.--------------------------I was taking a chance by purchasing this product since I only heard of people with rMBP (Retina Macbook Pro) being able to use this TV(monitor) out of the box, since those 2013 devices support native 4K outputs. I was given some hope after reading that some 2012 Mac Mini's with Intel 4000's were able to run them (at 18hz refresh).The conditions listed above must be satisfied to get this thing running. Obviously, the biggest trade off is not being able to take advantage of the 4k 30Hz (max on this TV) refresh rate due to the hardware limitation and non-native 4k support that the newer rMBP feature (HDMI 1.4 out), thus the reason the older model (mini-display port) requires the active adapter for the MBP (13\" mid 2012, tested).Given that, you should really consider your monitor requirements and usage. Obviously, any type of graphic demanding needs are out of the question due to the lower refresh rate. What does this mean? You will notice a lag in the cursor smoothness while mousing around and lags in animations/transitions such as moving windows around and related actions. At first this may seem like a drag. However, I have personally adjusted to it quite well after a few hours - though going back to the laptop along will feel like a luxury. For me, its liveable for now since I cannot invest in better hardware at the moment.The main feature of this TV is that it provides excellent real estate at high resolution for a cheap price (relative to the other $3000 monitors). If you are experienced in graphic work or heavy photo editing, you probably know the importance of investing in a higher-end product for the sake of achieving true color and will probably look into something better.One thing that is crucial is to adjust the picture settings using the remote - I was using the various presets and slightly adjusting them (user mode).... The colors at first looked absolutely brutal and washed out. I was having a little bit of regret. Especially since my previous budget monitor (27\" 2560x1440 Qnix Korean S-IPS) looked pretty good, I was tempted to switch back simply because the colors were extremely dull. I thought this was simply due to a hardware issue - thinking that the underpowered video card wasn't meant for this type of resolution (though true in the refresh rate department) and struggling to output. I would suggest opening several familiar websites and adjusting the User settings by eye. This made a huge difference when I dropped the Contrast level down to the low 30's level - which was the biggest culprit in washing out look. After tweaking the other settings, it is how it should be to my eye and I'm no longer experiencing the color wash previously which made icons and images look terrible. My faith was restored and am happy with the purchase.Current Settings: (Not fully optimized, but night and day compared to the presets)Contrast - 28Brightness - 55Color - 33Sharpness - 14Color Temp - CoolBlue Screen - ONI cannot speak for the display as a Television set yet as my primary uses are mainly for non-graphic intensive work (mostly text editors and terminal work). Obviously it will probably not compare to a brand name like Sony, but if you're looking into buying this monitor you are concerned with price/value.--------------------------Detailed Summary will be updated soon.", "Date": "December 2, 2013"}, {"Title": "Makes a fantastic monitor!!!", "Author": "MikeInOR", "ReviewID": "R1RP9OCPEPV4NQ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I purchased my SE39UY04 specifically as a computer monitor for my Windows 7 based system and I am extremely pleased with it!I had been on the hunt for a large monitor to replace the Hanns-G 28 inch monitor that died on me (I am very unimpressed with Hanns-G monitors) for many months.  The Korean 27\" and 30\" 2560 monitors had a lot of appeal to me but there were just too many unknowns.  What if I got one with a bunch of bad pixels?  What if it dies in 6 months?Then I found the SE39UY04 TV with 4K resolution and read every review I could find on it.  The only concern I could find in all the reviews was the 30hz refresh rate at 4K resolution.  I read how this wasn't a \"Gaming\" monitor.  How the refresh rate was even questionable when it came to mouse movements.  Despite these concerns I finally purchased one when they went on sale for five seventy nine.I have been using the SE39UY04 for a week now and I can say I am overjoyed with it as a computer monitor!  The 4K resolution on a 39\" screen is computer Nirvana to me!  In order to help you decide if this might also be a great monitor for you let me describe my computer usage patterns.I am a programmer.  I value screen real estate and incredibly sharp text!  This monitor has both in spades and I can not tell the difference between the 30hz refresh rate this monitor has and the 60hz refresh rate of the 24\" monitor sitting directly next to it hooked up to the same computer.  In other words I can move the mouse from one side of the SE39UY04 to the far side of the 24\" monitor very fast and see no difference in the pointer or any hint of a pointer trail on either screen.  Editing code with this much realestate is an incredible productivity enhancer!  I do run Windows at 150% text size so that everything isn't to small to be readable.  This works great except for a couple ancient apps with bitmapped interfaces that do not scale.  For these old apps the pixel density on the SE39UY04 makes them a bit on the small side but not near approaching unusable.  Browsing in Chrome, Firefox and IE are just fine.I use this monitor for browsing the internet.  I love filling the entire screen with a browser window and the huge amount of information that can be consumed before having to scroll.  When I do need to scroll (the entire screen) while browsing I see no sign of refresh lag or any artifacts.  Scrolling the browser is smooth and no different than my higher refresh monitors.I am not a gamer.  BUT my 9 year old daughter is a huge Minecraft fan!  Running Minecraft full screen with a 512 texture pack is incredible!  Moving and scrolling is perfectly smooth, no problem at all!  I do have a few older games that usually only get played when I get new hardware.  Last night I started up Grid (A racing game) at full 4K resolution and the graphics were pronominal!  I also played Dirt and ToCal also racing games at full 4K resolution.  They were all beautiful.  I could perceive absolutely NO refresh issues at all!  FOR ME gaming is perfectly fine on this monitor!  I really wonder how spoiled someone has to be to find this monitor not acceptable for gaming?I also purchased a Saphire R7 260x graphics card to drive the SE39UY04.  I am using a HDMI 1.4 to HDMI cable.  I bought a DVI-D to HDMI cable specifically for this monitor so I could run 4K resolution but ended up not needing it.  One of my existing graphics cards might have driven the 4K resolution just fine but I didn't want to have a beautiful monitor with no way to drive it at full resolution on my computer.  The R7 260x is also a big step up for minecraft and the other occasional games in terms of speed.Hardcore gamers should follow the advice of other hardcore gamers.  I BELIEVE other \"softcore\" gamers like me will be pleased with this monitor.I enjoy photography and have a decent DSLR.  Pictures come alive with this much resolution at this size with such a high pixel density!  I will say the stock color levels of the SE39UY04 seems a touch off to my eye but not bad enough for me to want to go through a color calibration process.  I am also not a hardcore photo editor... but photo editing at this size and resolution is this amateur photographers dream come true!  I have viewed many photos on my 47\" 1080 TV and they do not compare to the 4K resolution of the SE39UY04.As for watching TV on the SE39UY04... I really don't see the point.  My LG 47LM5600 sits about 3 feet away from the SE39UY04.  The picture on the SE39UY04 isn't bad but 1080 material looks better on the LG TV to me.  I am sure if there was ANY 4K video material available the SE39UY04 would be incredible... but there simply doesn't seem to be and 4K material available.One of the big reasons I chose the LG 47LM5600 when I purchased it was the mat finish screen.  I hate highly reflective high glare screens!  The LG was one of the few screens that had a mat finish.  The SE39UY04 falls about half way between the LG mat and a full glossy screen.  Being a mat screen fan I feared the SE39UY04 would be too glossy.  In my bedroom the finish on the SE39UY04 is just fine for me.I just finished remodeling my living room and the old Sony 36\" CRT TV has to go.

Sticky notes we're a consistent shade of yellow, dark grey on black text nearly disappeared, and my snow/sky background looked unnaturally blue.  I think the poor color contributed to the text not looking particularly crisp, or maybe that's a failure of windows clear type settings with font scaling.Maybe I just got off to a bad start with it, since it came with a broken HDMI cable.

The highest resolution 3840x2160 pops up at every startup.  So only read the below instructions if you are running an older version OS on the Mac Mini.  The screen has been a great monitor for all these months except for the irritation of dealing with turning the screen off and having to reset the resolution every time the screen was turned on.  Adding the appropriate scanning rate using SwitchResX is still required.  All in all, much improvement.Title sums up why the TV was purchased.In short, it works beautifully as a Mac Mini monitor.  My caveat is that this is a fussy endeavor, and not for everyone.What hardware is required?1) Accell B086B-008B UltraAV Mini DisplayPort 1.1 to HDMI 1.4 Active Adapter - AMD Eyefinity Certified (Blister Package) which is required to be plugged into the Thunderbolt port.2) you'll have to use the supplied HDMI 1.4 cable that comes with the television. Non-1.4 cables will not work, but you never know.What are the settings?1) I used SwitchResX to open up a few optional resolutions.  Yes, another piece of purchased software, but I have had this software since I upgraded to a 1080p home theater screen years ago.  It definitely paid for itself, when using it a 2nd time.  When looking for a functioning refresh rate, initially set it up in 1 Hz steps from 30 down to 15 and see what will work for your computer.  Fastest I could do was 18 Hz.  Yes, 18.  Using SwitchResX requires adding types of resolutions and refresh rates and then rebooting, to see if they will work.2) the Seiki will NEVER function as a 3840x2160 monitor if the overscan is set to anything other than 0 in the monitors preference panel.3) MAJOR ISSUE: (UPDATE) I have said that the Seiki will have to be switched from lower resolution at 0 overscan to its highest resolution.  That it will not be able to be turned off and on at full resolution, because it will not reconnect at the higher resolution.  After I am finished with work for the day, I leave the resolution at a 1279x720 at 60Hz.  Then I can turn off and turn on the Seiki.  The update is that I do find that the monitor will auto connect at 3840, but it either just pops on or it will take a long time.  That long time could still be never, so I still think that switching resolution is a sure way of controlling the monitor.4) I upgraded to 10.9 Mavericks.  It maybe that the improved monitor handling is required for 4K resolution success. I upgraded before testing.5) the refresh rate I use is 18Hz.  But since I'm not a gamer, this is not a problem.  There is no strobe-effect of the screen.  It is very readable and excellent looking.  If you open a window of a video, it will be watchable, but will not be perfect.This is what I had to do to get the Seiki up and running.  Your mileage may vary.  For me this was a best buy monitor, that ended the multiple monitor desk setup.  It's the nicest display I have ever run in a computer environment.

I've tried multiple 1080p monitors in different configurations but they were all bothersome because they required multiple connections, monitor stands etc. This panel does the work of 4 X 1080p with just one HDMI 1.4 cable which is elegant.Setup:~I'm using a basic nVidia GTX645 which came with my HP 700e workstation although any HDMI 1.4 capable nVidia card should do the trick. It does a good job of rendering the Windows 8 Aero effects and other OS enhancements.I have the monitor wall mounted at arms length  (the Beach Camera package with the wall mount, 3 HDMI cables and a power adapter is a great deal). I had to turn the windows resolution to 125% because the text was a little tough to read. The text pitch is pretty close to the T62p Thinkpad I have with a 1920x1200 15.4\" panel which is about 1/4 the size of the Seiki. As a consummate fan of resolution over screen size I was hoping to run Windows 8 at 100% text magnification but that proved to be a strain since the screen is mounted about 3 feet away.My primary purpose for getting this monitor was for software application and web development. It is nice to have all your windows, debuggers etc on one view and not have to switch frantically between various contexts and the Seiki's resoltion makes that possible.Settings:After working on this for a couple of days (alongside a couple of  Dell 2420Ls) I realized that the default settings are extremely contrasty and that the shadow detail of many images was being lost. This makes doing simple tasks like touching up images more difficult.Right now, for monitor duties at 3ft away, these settings seem to work well:Contrast: 10Brightness: 50-72Color: 15Sharpness: 5These result in a slightly washed out image with not much contrast and grayish blacks, however a lot of shadow detail is clearly visible.Pros:~+ 4k (3840x2160) resolution - there is no substitute.+ Inexpensive for 4k+ Decent color reproduction when configured correctly+ Beach Camera package came with cheap but fairly sturdy wallmount and 3 HDMI cablesCons:- Too contrasty in default mode - requires a little more tweaking than the average panel before you can use it as a monitor.- If your PC goes to sleep, it may not recognize the monitor when you resume your sessin (still looking into this - it may be an nVidia issue)- Speakers are kinda crap", "Date": "August 30, 2013"}, {"Title": "Beware - Poor quality control?

If you've never seen a low refresh you probably don't know what I'm talking about. Think of the headlight of an old car pulsing, that's what it looks like, just in the top right corner. I've tried forcing 30Hz from the detected 29Hz, but it didn't improve. At 1080p at 120Hz there was still the backlight issue and still noticeable white flicker but fast motion had less ghosting.

Even on other videos and images you can see the banding in the colors. It's very distracting.So I ended up asking myself if these shortcomings/glitches are worth keeping it?

Out of the box, there are several tweaks you need to due to the image quality settings, such as turning down the \"sharpness.\" I won't go into the details since these settings are well covered by other reviewers and online forum posts.As a monitor, this the desktop area you get is exactly like taking four 24\" HD monitors and placing them in a 2x2 arrangement. Windows and text are not any larger... you just get way more area to work with.  For a guy that loves to have a huge desktop, this is wonderful.  Having the desktop space to lay out many windows side by side makes multitasking a breeze.

Until online movie streaming services begin offering 4k content to computers, or 4k Blu-rays become available, there is simply nothing to watch.  4k videos on YouTube are technically 4k, but they are so heavily compressed that they seem to be the same quality as a 1080p Blu-ray most of the time.I've also tried gaming on this TV playing Battlefield 4. At 2160p, you can forget about gaming. Don't even try it. There is about a 300ms delay in the display when displaying 4k content.  You notice that your cursor moves on a little right after you stop moving the mouse, and for first-person shooters, this makes playing almost impossible.  Another problem is this TV is limited to 30hz by the HDMI 1.4 spec. I've seen no indication online that this unit will ever be able to be upgraded to HDMI 2.0, so high frame rates at 4k is never going to happen.As a 1080p display, out of the box, there is a 4% overscan.  This makes text and details look horrible. In a secret factory menu (press menu + 0000 on the remote) you can set the overscan to make 1080p sources display with no overscan.  Once dialing these settings in, pixels are \"doubled\" perfectly and things begin to look great again at 120hz with no imput lag. Compared to a regular HDTV, you also cannot see the individual RGB pixels from 3 feet away, so there is an illusion of better quality. But there's one problem: these overscan settings don't stick, so you have to do it each time you switch sources.  That's my biggest problem in this area.Using this TV as a TV:Since Seiki has been offering free U-Vision up-converters to existing owners of this TV, my option of Seiki as a company has changed. The unconverted image from a 1080p Bluray to 4k looks fantastic and made me want to watch all my Blu-rays again. Sitting 4 ft away from this TV feels like you're back in a movie theater.This is important because the built in up-converter on the TV is serviceable, but nothing to rave about. Once sitting 8 ft away, this TV looks like any other low-end HDTV to the eye. My last major complaint is that the LED back-lighting is not uniform. Watching video, you will never notice this. But when looking at a solid color or pitch black, you see that there are four bright spots around the display.  While it doesn't look good, I'm not going to complain because I knew this was not a high-end TV and the price was right.Why buy this display?Because you have a limited budget and you want a big 4k monitor right now. If you can wait for displays with the HDMI 2.0 specification to come down in price, by all means, wait.  Your experience will be way better not having to put up with so many quirks to get a good display. But if you're an early adopter type and love to tinker, then this TV will definitely do the job.", "Date": "May 27, 2014"}, {"Title": "Depending on your needs, makes an excellent monitor, IF you take the steps to set it up right.", "Author": "K.

I plugged this into to a recent Nvidia Quadro and it correctly identified the monitor, the proper resolutions, and the refresh rate, and it thought it could output them, but the display stubbornly showed \"Not Support\".  A $60 Radeon R7 solved the problem instantly.  The HDMI cable supplied works just fine.2.  When using as a monitor, disable Noise Reduction AND turn Sharpness down to 0.  Sharpening a native resolution image makes it WORSE.  A lot of people who complain about blurriness simply didn't do this.  The image is PERFECT when you do both of these things.3.  Folks who complain about \"input lag\" due to the 30hz refresh rate are probably expressing dissatisfaction with some other aspect of their computing setup (inadequate CPU or video card or memory etc).  30hz is 30 refresh cycles per second.  The only time you can see this is when you are watching full motion video, and even that looks perfectly fine on this monitor.  Remember, NTSC television is only 24 frames per second.4.  I replaced a 27\", 2560x1440 DVI-D IPS display with this screen and I'm not looking back.  A 39\" screen may seem large, but the pixel density is actually slightly higher than on the 27\".  Think of this as having a grid of 2x2 1920x1080 displays.  Consider a software add-on like DisplayFusion to make the most of it -- it can simulate 4 displays in one, including the excellent Snap-To functionality in Windows 7 and later.I got one of these for my office, and I like it so much I'm having a hard time deciding on whether to get one for home, or whether to wait for more 4k offerings.  At home, I occasionally play games, and while I wouldn't want to play them at 30hz, I can always switch into 1080p @ 120hz mode and get the best of both worlds.UPDATE: After a month of using it at the office, I went ahead and bought a second one of these for home.  I paired it with this card http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00HS84DFU/ref=oh_details_o00_s00_i00?ie=UTF8&psc;=1 as I needed to upgrade from my excellent and long-lived GTX 480 to get the HDMI 1.4 output.  It's absolutely spectacular at home.  Desktop tasks and 4K videos look great, as do games like Skyrim and Arma at full resolution.  For games that depend on fluidity, like Starcraft, the 120hz @ 1080p mode is perfect (with the firmware from the 50\" model).This is definitely the best bang for the buck out there right now.  Super pixel density, great desktop real estate, and versatile gaming options.  It did take some tweaking to get everything set up perfectly, but it's well worth it.  I don't expect to need to an upgrade until I can get a 4k panel @ 120hz at a similar price point.There are a few annoying things about it.  First is the startup time, which is probably somewhere north of five seconds -- typical for a TV, not so great for a monitor.  It's unclear whether the delay is for a technical reason, or to display the underwhelming SEIKI splash screen.  There's also lack of wake on sleep.  When your computer drops the signal for the display to go to sleep, it simply turns itself off and much be turned on with the power button on the display or the remote.  The biggest cretinism is probably the forced four-hour powerdown warning.  You can stop it from shutting itself off by pressing a button on the remote or the display, but it cannot be disabled in the options.  So around midway through my day, the screen will try to power itself off even when I'm working on it.The above are only occasional irritants, and they don't diminish my overall enjoyment of the screen much, but as they're all issues that should easily be solvable with a software update, I hold out a bleak hope that Seiki will either include these minor updates in the firmware, or that some enterprising hacker will find a way to do it that they will share with the world.", "Date": "April 17, 2014"}, {"Title": "As a monitor, can't be beat for the money.", "Author": "MalcS", "ReviewID": "R1CVC47L21CPY9", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Got this to use as a WIN 7 PC monitor at full resolution with a PNY GTX 660 bought for this purpose. I am a programmer and wanted a monitor that would display the max amount of text in several windows at once.Purchased as a 'used - very good' for $372, but it clearly had never been out of the box when it arrived so was in new condition.Followed the advice of the other reviewers - updated firmware to the latest version (39\") from the SEIKI site, turned sharpness down to 0, noise reduction off, automatic power off to OFF, and adjusted backlight and colors to get a pleasing image. Once that is all done, the image displayed is pin sharp and looks great. Note that you must use a HDMI connection to get 3840x2160.Monitor does not support waking up after PC goes to sleep - it will turn off, and you will have  to turn back on manually, not a huge problem, but depending on your graphics card, you may find Windows (or NVIDIA) has moved all your windows to the top left of the display if you let the PC go to sleep (a pain), so I disabled turning off monitors in 'power settings' in Windows. Hope they can implement 'wake up' in firmware in the future like other monitors.Font size - regular windows fonts at the default size are about as small as you probably want on the 39\". Since the SEIKI display is almost exactly equal to 4x20\" 1080p monitors, the text you get at 4K resolution will look the same size as text at 1080p on a 20\" monitor. If you are used to a 24\" 1080p monitor, the text on the 39\" SEIKI will be a little smaller - the 50\" model would be approx the same as 4x24\" 1080p monitors.Monitor placement - since font sizes at max resolution are comparable to a 20\" monintor at 1080p, you need to be as close to the 39\" as you would a 20\" in order to get the same legibility. This was OK for me. The 50\" version would give slightly larger characters, but the 'front row at the movies' effect would be more evident I think. You will have to move your head to view from one side to the other in either case.30HZ refresh rate (a limitation of HDMI 1.4) - works fine for me, but I'm only editing text, not gaming.All in all, monitor works great for me, and there is nothing else comparable in the price range. Other companies are coming out with 4K monitors in the 28-32\" size range at the moment, but quite frankly, for my purposes of viewing the most text possible, a 4K monitor that *small* would display *tiny* fonts by default (same size as you would get with a 14\"-16\" 1080p - there isn't such a thing), and increasing the font size using the Windows control panel just gives you less text, so my opinion is you need the physical large size as well as the 4K resolution for text editing purposes.(Update 2/25/2014 - purchased a Accell (B086B-008B-2) UltraAV Mini DisplayPort 1.1 to HDMI 1.4 Active Adapter and can now run my mid 2011 Mac Mini (AMD Radeon HD 6630M) at 4K / 30hz using a HDMI 1.4 cable, as with the PC its Excellent!)Your needs may be different to mine!", "Date": "February 5, 2014"}, {"Title": "Works well, much better colors than our 2009 year HannsG HG/HZ-281's, best price per 4k pixel on the market I found!", "Author": "mohonj", "ReviewID": "R1775TJYAW8XCM", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Works as a 3840\u00d72160\u00d732-bit-color@30Hz 4k computer display on the get-goprovided you know the following 3 items.We have 8 computers to switch with this display, I much desire thatthis display would have 5+ HDMI v1.4 or higher ports,and have an array of buttons one per port (HDMI & VGA) to 1-pressdirect switch to any connected computer (much much more preferred than the remote).Text can be small on 3840\u00d72160 over a 39\" screen.A $650 50\" unit (used & stated Used - Very Good condition,64% more screen for only 30% more price than 39\" unit, if it is really is good as new)has been ordered and is on its way to increase text size 28% to the eyes.1.

It gives you the ability to look at a photo at its native resolution.  On a screen that is of higher quality in terms of resolution than an iPad. It is big enough that you can make out the tiniest details while viewing the whole photograph.  This is the way photographs are meant to be experienced and, as a species, we have finally achieved it.  Kudos, Homo sapiens.The problem is the 30 Hz refresh rate that comes along with this resolution.  The monitor only has HDMI and that is HDMI's current ability.  Someone else, I think, commented that even if HDMI is updated Seiki won't push out a fix via firmware.  Seiki, tell me that person was wrong.  At 30 Hz intense mouse work is, well, unworkable.  Specifically, your mouse cursor may disappear for whole inches at a time if you move quickly. My wife hates it.  In order to make a screen this size usable you must boost your mouse cursor speed to its fastest simply due to the amount of screen real estate to cover.  In fact you will want that speed to be even faster than what's offered.  However, at max speed, the monitor's refresh rate won't keep up.  It is not a much discussed topic, but search for `\"30 hz\" and \"mouse cursor\"'.  It is why gamers use it at 1080P in order to take advantage of the higher refresh possible and why they do things like turn off 'vsync'.  Originally I thought a great use for this monitor would be CAD.  After using it for a while, though, I doubt it.In conclusion: Hats off to Seiki for pulling off a device of such capability and beauty at this price point.  I look forward to the next effort as it will surely rock.  If you are an early adopter like me, be forewarned this one may not become your work monitor.  But also be forewarned that it will rock despite its flaws.WINS-As noted above the display is fantastic.-Bezel and overall design look good.  For the on/off indicator I like the subtle-- and by that mean not insanely bright--lightbar which softly glows blue or red.

Doesn't look that great though.LOSSES-30 Hz kills mouse joy.-I have vertical \"wavelets\" in the center of the display.  They are only visible when viewing large expanses of monochrome, like a blue sky, but if you have 'em you'll look for them.-Doesn't remember Backlight setting.  After poweroff it remembers the setting, but doesn't actually apply it until you go to fix it again.----------------------------Postscript:  I would submit a photo of the screen to show how well it displays photos.  But, the photo would be approximately the same resolution as the monitor.  So, to show the detail, I'd have to take the picture from very close or each photo pixel would represent a group of the monitor's pixels.Another postscript:  For settings I adjusted the simple and Advanced color settings per recommends of another reviewer here.  (Advanced: Menu button then four zeros)  Then I set the backlight to 25 at which screen is dim but fine (esp at night).  At this backlight power consumption is so low that the back of display barely gets warm.One more:  Surprisingly, IE runs rings around Chrome at this resolution.

I ordered it at the insane price of $404.  No it's not a misprint and yes it was brand new.  I'm used to having dual 24 inch 1080p screens and more recently a Dell 3011U 30\" 2560x1600 that was excellent.  That monitor was on loan and I had to return it after a 6 month test.  I've been preparing on what I was going to buy since once you get to that resolution, it's impossible to go back.  However, I didn't have the cash to drop $600 for a cheap 30\" let alone $1,200 for a really good one.  I really wanted a 4K but never in a millions years (ok, so I'm exaggerating a little) thought one would be in my budget, at least not at this time.  For the last 4 weeks I've been scanning amazon for good monitor deals.  I though Black Friday would be the day I pulled the trigger on a new monitor but never made my move.  Then about a week or so ago I found the Seiki 39\" and started to research it.  User comments were extremely helpful plus I watched several video reviews.  I was very skeptical at first but then I reread the reviews focusing only on PC only usage and I began to get more comfortable.  Yes, some comments were very harsh with bad units that died a month into operations but you'll have that with any manufacturer.  Loose stand, lousy remote controls and poor game play were frequently commented on.  So let me give you my perspective.  I never plan to watch FiOS movies on this TV/Monitor nor do I plan to watch a DVD/Blu-ray, mostly because I don't own one of those devices other than what's in my PC's and Mac's and I really could care less.  For me this is a computer monitor replacement period.  So let's get the irrelevant issues out of the way first.  The monitor, as I'll now refer to it came in a solid box that was well packed.  A couple of minor shipping dents on the exterior of the box but once, opened the TV was perfect.  It's was wrapped with a thin plastic and protective sheathing that is ultra-common on every TV I've ever purchased.  Manual, Remote, HDMI cable, base stand and TV were all inside tightly packaged.  The base stand was actually very high quality and in no way loose as some mentioned in their reviews.  It's very solid with a glass covering and 5 screws that attach to the bottom of the mount.  Additionally, the mount is reinforced from the bottom with an additional metal plate.  You can see it from the bottom.  Simply insert all 5 screws and tighten with a proper Phillips #2 screwdriver.  It's totally solid and doesn't wiggle even the slightest.The remote is above average and works as expected.  Please note, the monitor will turn off when your PC or Mac goes to sleep and will not turn on when your computer wakes.  You will need to have the remote handy as it will be used constantly to turn the monitor on.  Sure, this is an inconvenience, but it isn't that big of a deal.  I did toss the AAA batteries that came with the remote immediately in the recycling bin and replaced with a new setup of premium brand named batteries.  The batteries that came with the remote were very sketchy looking and I was concerned about future leakage.  Just point the remote at the Brand Name Logo (SEIKI) on the front of the monitor and it works every time.  Overall the remote is fine but it lacks any type of illumination, again not a big deal and from my perspective not really expected in a monitor at this cost.The monitor is aesthetically very nice looking.  Glossy black bezel with a black and glass base with a Blue LED light indicating power when on and a Red LED when it is in power saving mode.  It's really nice and when sitting on my desk is absolutely rock solid.One Thing to note.  The power cord is a standard 2 prong cable with a grounded blade.  It is not removable nor does it use the standard US computer standard power cables many tech components use.  It's too short for many users when the monitor is placed on a desk where the power and other components are on the floor.  The manufacturer provides a 2 meter HDMI cable but the power cable is half that length.  I used a 4 foot grounded extension cable I picked up at Microcenter for $3.00.  I placed a little double sided tape and affixed it to the side of my desk.  Then plugged the extension into my UPS.  It looks great and for $3.00 solves the issue.  Just have one handy if your power is not located on or in the back of your desk.The monitor is not height adjustable although I really don't see the need for it.  On a desk it is very large and it will take somewhat getting used to as you move your head around the screen.  However, the experience of using a monitor this large will become second nature very quickly.Setup took about 3 minutes plugging into the HDMI port on my EVGA GTX780 Classified video card.  As mentioned above, Seiki even included a nice blue colored mesh wrapped HDMI cable that is 2M long.  Nice touch on a $404 monitor.  Out of the box it immediately synced to 3840x2160 @30Hz.  Don't waste your time trying to get it to 60Hz, it's not supported at this time.  After a few teaks using the recommendations of the Amazon crowd (60 Contrast, 46 Brightness, 48 Color and 0 Sharpness) text looked very good.  No it's not ultra-sharp, but it's absolutely fine.  Color was excellent and bright.  Way better than I thought it would be.  Yellows look awesome.  I mean awesome.  Pinks and reds are vivid and black is black.  4K videos on YouTube look very good.  There is really only the slightest hint of shutter and frankly it's really not noticeable as you get comfortable with the monitor.  It is big but that's what I wanted.  Its only 4 inches wider than the Dell 3011U and about 7 inches taller.  It's actually slimmer in depth wise by an inch.  So is it worth a 5, it's not perfect but for what I paid it's worth a 6.  Quality is a solid 4 but keeping in mind its cost I give a 5.  You simply can't beat the price/performance on this monitor.  I plan to keep this about a year, maybe 2 and then move up.  By then some major brands will have their 4K unit's in the sub $1,000 range or who knows, maybe I'll be looking at an 8K monitor.  Technology moves so fast I'm sure one day we'll all be watching a 16K monitor.  For those of you that only care about name brands, the world is changing.  This is an excellent monitor at a price that is almost unheard of.  I know it must have been a one day sale because the next day it back to $499, but anything sub $500 is a steal.I totally recommend this monitor for non-gaming PC usage.  Programmers will love the real estate on the screen with the ability to have multiple windows side by side than ever.  I hope you find this helpful.

Since it's designed as a TV, not a monitor, your computer will \"lose sight\" of it when it's not on, and revert to a single (or whatever) monitor setup, relocating all your open windows and screwing up your desktop layout. There is a workaround for this!!! Get a 1x2 HDMI splitter and use it as a switch box between the TV and your computer. When the monitor is off, the HDMI splitter will still push forward the most recent monitor information it has in it's memory, tricking your computer into thinking the TV is still on and saving all your desktop/window settings.

Everyone had triple monitor configurations (30\" 2560x1600) already and we just replaced the front display.The first problem we had was two of the workstations had graphic cards that would not support 4K resolution, So we upgraded to Quadro cards (without paying attention to the specs). If you are going to use this monitor in a multi monitor configuration then pay attention to the graphic card specs ... for 4K + 2x(2560x1600) is pushing the limits of what a single graphics card can do.Second problem, not all display port to HDMI adapters will support 4K bandwidth. The Quadro's do not support HDMI 1.4 directly and the display port adapters we had on hand did not support 4K bandwidth. AMD's web site \"AMD Eyefinity Technology - Recommended Adapters\" proved quite useful to nail down adapters that would work at 4K.The relatively old AMD graphics card in the software developers workstation had an HDMI out that happened to be 1.4 capable and that workstation supported the 4K monitor plus the 2x (2560x1600) monitors with not a single problem.All three monitors required significant calibration, do not get too worried when you first turn them on. When we turned the first one on we thought \"eh oh\". Turn sharpness off, then turn the off noise reduction. The noise reduction has to be turned off incrementally to get around a firmware bug, first medium->weak, then weak->off. If you go from medium->off it will not take the setting.  The contrast is also way off but with 10 minutes of tuning you can get it looking pretty good. We used Lagon test images for the setup. The performance is not too far off the Dell monitors we also use but probably not good enough for graphic workstations.You have to get used to such a large display, everyone tweaked there desktop configuration over a few days.

If you're looking for an AWESOME PC monitor, well, you can't beat the price vs resolution ratio.4k (3840x2160 on PC) resolution is breathtaking. 1080P at 120Hz is great.  So use the 4K resolution for your desktop and 1080P for gaming.  What more could you ask for?Now some people have complained about the 30hz being sluggish.  Well guess what... your computer may be the culprit more than the monitor.  I have two Radeon 7970s and disabled Crossfire before hooking up the monitor.  Sure enough, I could see the sluggishness that everyone was talking about and yes, it was very noticeable.  Now, I enabled Crossfire, and then the problem disappeared and the mouse moved as smooth as ever (Win 7 & 8 have \"fixed/set\" USB mouse polling speeds).So what does this mean?  If you are going to get this screen, then make sure your computer and graphics card(s) have enough horsepower to drive it.  I've put games to the test at 4K and since I mainly play RPGs/MMOs, I've had no problems and I enjoy the super sharp 4K resolution while playing.

I'm using it as my sole computer monitor. Here are some thoughts.The good:I have a 4 year old HP DV8T laptop that has NVIDIA GT 230M graphics. I made a custom resolution in NVIDIA Control Panel and was astonished when I was blessed with 30Hz 4k video over HDMI out of this old laptop. Not that it's performing with authority or anything, but I'm impressed that it works at all. I expected to be using it for 1080p only until I upgraded to a desktop computer with at least GT 640 graphics which have been reported to work well with this monitor.Out of the box, the sharpness, brightness, color, and contrast did not suit me at all and there was no backlight adjustment in the standard menu. After entering the service menu with \"MENU 0 0 0 0\", I checked the firmware version and saw there was a newer version on Seiki's website. I loaded it, which added backlight control to the standard menu. I was then able to adjust the backlight down to 50, contrast to 40, brightness to 63, color to 23, and sharpness to 7, which gives me an image I'm quite happy with.The only 4k video I've watched is youtube, but it really is glorious. It's like seeing HD for the first time again.I tend to resize whichever window I'm working on to that of maybe a 25\" diagonal monitor, which makes it comfortable to work on without having to turn my head to see the extents of the window. Sitting about 30 inches away, the upper corners are noticeably farther away and angled from me compared to the center, of course. So it's a slightly different experience from a multiple-monitor setup where you'd tend to angle each monitor towards you. I see where a curved screen would be more ideal.I did a little full-screen photo editing in Adobe Lightroom. That's really something special, working on a photo that's blown up to nearly poster-sized. My computer struggles, though, doing most tasks. If I resize the window smaller, it's tolerable, but an upgrade really is in order.I wrote a little code for my Raspberry Pi. Editing text is pleasant and it's cool just how many things you can have open around the display.So far, the 30 Hz really hasn't bothered me at all.Not so good:It's certainly not an ideal display for calibrated photo editing, but it's better than I feared.I am having some screen blanking issues where the signal just drops out momentarily on occasion. I've read other reviews with the same issue that seems to be related to the video card being used.I have my computer set to turn the display off after a timeout, which drops signal to the Seiki. It will show a signal lost screen for awhile and then turn off. When you wake the computer, though, it will not turn back on until you use the remote and it takes a good 30 seconds to power on. Not a big deal to me, but something to keep in mind.One of the HDMI ports doesn't have much room around it. Some cables may not fit well.There are no buttons on the front. They're only on the back right, which may be difficult to reach, depending on your setup.The remote isn't backlit.All-in-all, I really like it.

I had to start with a Mini DisplayPort to HDMI Adapter. But it could be because it was the first time I was booting up the Mac Pro and the MAC couldn't recognize the source through its HMDI port. After setting up the MAC Pro, I was able to move over the an HDMI Cable (BlueRigger High Speed).So at this point...Screen looked horrible!But after turing sharpness down to 0, it was much better.Screen was too bright!I downloaded the Firmware for the 39\" from the Seiki website to a FAT32 formatted USB, plugged it into the Seiki TV and followed the instructions to upgrade the firmware.

However, considering the relatively dirt-cheap price, it is more than worth it for those who want to get a headstart into the 4K world. I got pretty decent picture quality out of the box with OTA broadcast signals, and excellent picture quality from my 1080p Apple TV. I am actually rather impressed with the quality of the 4K upscaling, especially with the Apple TV signal. It really does look better than native 1080p, though it doesn't look nearly as good as native 4K. I have tinkered with the settings a little bit but I didn't have to do a firmware upgrade. Maybe mine was already upgraded?Anyways, to get on to the big issue here... No support for HDMI 2.0 yet, so with native 4K you're limited to 30Hz over HDMI. This is fine for movies because they are typically 24fps, but games and other video content will look inferior at 30Hz. Now, I have contacted Seiki customer service on two occasions, once by phone and once by email (via their weird online support system). Both times took longer than I would have liked, but at least I got responses. The guy on the phone told me confidently that the current models of their 4K TVs will support HDMI 2.0 by means of a future firmware upgrade. The email support response said that they are merely working to see if that is a possibility. So, there seems to be some ambiguity about whether this TV is actually as \"future-proof\" as it seems. I don't know enough about the technology to know whether it is possible to increase data throughput with a mere firmware upgrade, but since HDMI 2.0 will use the same cables as previous versions, I'd say this is quite possible and is likely a matter of the encoding/decoding scheme at both ends of the cable, rather than the hardware itself. The TV is obviously capable of 120Hz, so I tend to believe what the guy said on the phone. How long it will take to get this firmware upgrade, I have no idea.

I attached it via the supplied HDMI cable to the display port input of my GTX 570 graphics card with a geforce driver of 320.xxx (an august version or thereabouts).In order to get the monitor to run at full resolution, I had to navigate to Nvidia control panel-->Change Resolution-->Create custom resolution. In this window, I had to select 3840 and 2160 for horizontal and vertical pixels, and a refresh rate of 30 Hz. Under the timing section, select CVT reduced blank. All else remains at default.Next, I turned sharpening to zero. Then, I calibrated the display using an i1Display pro and DispCal Gui. Note: because this display seems to employ dynamic contrast that cannot be turned off, I could not calibrate this display using i1Profiler. The calibration and profiling step revealed that the gamut coverage of the display is 93% of sRGB and 65.2% of Adobe RGB, which is fairly typical. However, this means that the display is not wide-gamut. A delta E average of 5.21 with a maximum of 15.97 (not very good) was achieved.Subjectively, the display is very sharp and aesthetically pleasing. However, viewing angles are merely fair (as opposed to good). I notice both luminosity and color shifts when moving my head. These shifts are far less than those present on TN-panels, but seem somewhat above the norm for S-IPS displays. By way of comparison, a Dell U3011 monitor that is also at my desk (I am a photo-enthusiast) demonstrates minimal color shifting.In light of these findings, I will continue to use the Dell monitor for color-critical applications, but for everything else--web browsing, word doc editing, movie watching, and all manner of content consumption--the Seiki 39'' will be my go-to monitor.", "Date": "November 18, 2013"}, {"Title": "Perfect as PC Monitor", "Author": "Persyv", "ReviewID": "R1PIGG3197E4FS", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Very nice monitor.

The productivity bump with such a large hi-def monitor is incredible.  When doing research, the ability to have maybe a dozen sources open concurrently and to be able to keep track of them is a huge performance boost.  This is right up there with 32-bit processors, the first NEC Multisync monitors, multi-GB harddrives, multi-GB RAM, SSDs (gush).  The 39inch screen may be close to the maximum amount of monitor space that can be used without tilting your neck (much).  As a colleague said: \u201c\u2026I have not discovered any threat of strabismus based on a week or so of testing\u201d. The DPI/PPI of 116 (www.sven.de) may also make it the clearest large monitor that you have seen.  If Seiki would provide a preset with reasonable calibration characteristics for use as a monitor then they could sell very many of these at this great price.Caveats:  You should be comfortable experimenting with your computer, hardware settings, etc., before buying this monitor.  Also, the amount of apparent saturation with this monitor may make it a poor choice for professional graphics/photo work. It works fine for reading, writing, creating presentations, coding, etc.  FYI:  As of writing this review I have been using this monitor for two weeks.Notes:[1] You will likely need a new graphics card to either have support for 4K (3840x2160) or have adequate performance.  If your computer isn\u2019t fast, then the effort to drive such a large number of pixels could slow it down further.  With a good setup there is no mousing drag, or windows drag, problem.  If you do buy a new graphics adapter make sure it supports 4K and you might want to watch the power usage of the card.  The card I chose said it worked with a 400 watt supply\u2014since I have a 500 watt supply there were no issues.[2] The 30Hz refresh will likely not bother you unless perhaps there is a lot of rapid motion (e.g. gaming). The 4K videos on YouTube (don\u2019t forget to change the Youtube settings) play great.  There is no flicker issue\u2014the pixels stay painted.  CRTs required higher refresh because of the scan rate versus phosphor persistence.[3] I had no dead pixels.[4] You will likely have to update the firmware.  If the main setup menu does not have a Backlight setting then you need the new firmware. On the Seiki site this firmware is labeled \u201cWith Backlight And color TEMP\u201d.  You will need to load it to a Fat32 formatted USB stick.  I powered up the monitor with the stick in USB Slot 1 (located in the back) and it worked first try.[5] You will have to spend some time changing your monitor settings\u2014read other reviews and other sources.  After two weeks of use these are my settings from the Picture menu: Contrast 32, Brightness 58, Color 39, Sharpness 0, Backlight 35 (perhaps low, but plenty bright for my work area).  Also on the main screen you might want to set Bluescreen Off so that you don\u2019t have periods of bright blue screen during computer scan rate transitions.  From the Time menu, set Sleep Timer to Off. From the Setup menu make sure \u201cNoise Reduction\u201d is Off (can\u2019t remember if that is a default).[6] You can go into advanced setup \u201cFactory Menu\u201d with setup, then 0000.  Be careful in these menus\u2026don\u2019t try everything, for instance \u201cBurning Mode\u201d is captive and you can\u2019t turn it off\u2014the monitor will just cycle through colors.  Powering off does not clear this setting (ouch).  If you do get stuck try keeping the power button on the side depressed until it stops. The only setting I used here was \u201cOther\u201d menu/ POWER On Mode to On so that the monitor turns on when power is applied.[7] Change the Windows settings (Windows 8.1 for me).  Control Panel\\Appearance and Personalization\\Display\u2026Adjust ClearType text. Choose the right selection (default is left) on the first text sample presented\u2026this is to set it for BGR (instead of RGB)\u2026two sources on the net mentioned this.  Cryptic, but it seems to work.[8] From the same menu also Calibrate Color.  Read the directions carefully as you step through.[9] Even after all of the settings, the tests on http://www.lagom.nl/lcd-test/ still show so me problems, primarily with contrast.  Since text and brightness are working well I have not yet tried to improve things further.Windows Preferences:[10] You might not want to monitor to fully power off during brief periods of inactivity\u2026 Control Panel\\Hardware and Sound\\Power Options\\Edit Plan Settings\u2026choose a longer setting for the display under the \u201cPlugged in\u201d column.[11] I like dark blue backgrounds with this monitor\u2026the Abstract Dark from Microsoft provides nice contrast and limits the brightness.[12] With all of this space you may sorely miss Aero on Windows 8.  I do.  With all of the pale windows, it is hard to tell them apart without better shadows.  Come on Microsoft, put it back.  This is not a 9 inch screen\u2026flat is a performance hindrance.[13] On Office 2013 you might try, File/Options/General/Office Theme: Dark Gray.  It helps a bit.I first saw a demo of a UHD TV last year.  It was amazing but the cost was about $3000.  I knew I would want the UHD to use as a monitor before using one for a TV.  I thought it would be years until it reached a comfortable price threshold.  8,294,400 pixels for under $500.

Here's the strange thing - If you have Verizon Fios, don't expect to use your remote on this TV. No matter what key you press on the Fios remote, it will either raise of lower the volume. It's really the oddest thing. For instance, if you hit the FF key, it will FF the content that you're watching but it will raise the volume at the same time. I called tech support about this and while they know about the issue, they offer no work around to it.As I mentioned the sound is shockingly bad on the TV, so I got a Zvox sound bar and it's a really good product but guess what? Those crummy speakers? You can't turn them off. So when I use the FIOS remote the TV is getting jealous and still messing with the TV volume even with the Zvox soundbar working perfectly.

Even the 39\" (compared to 50\") is quite large, but moved back 2 feet and you get used to it very quickly. Took a few days to troubleshoot and get everything working smoothly. Some basic things to realize (some mentioned in earlier reviews):1. I couldn't get 4k to display with my PC (Geforce 780ti) until it was the ONLY monitor plugged in via HDMI.2. Mouse lag at 30hz is a little annoying, but manageable. I hear a new firmware update (coming) may help with this.3. You CAN game in 4k mode with a powerful card (Geforce 780ti), but it is not suitable for FPS game, though possible. I've played Dirt 3 and Two Brothers and it is actually playable at 4k.4. You will probably have to create custom resolution on your PC to get it to display in 4k. I used Nvidia control panel.5. 120hz mode is super-smooth and works well in games. You also have to create a custom resolution for this (1920x1080 at 120hz). For some games, it will force back into 60hz, so you have to run in a windowed or borderless-windowed mode.6. Works well with a Macbook Pro 13\" early 2011 with Intel HD3000 graphics in 1080p mode. At 2560x1400, it looks kind of fuzzy, and I have emailed Seikei's engineers about this. Hopefully, a firmware update will fix. To get a 2560x1440 mode, you need to download SwitchResX and set a custom resolution and reboot.7. I can get 2560x1440 at 30hz to display on my Macbook using the Acell B086B-008B-2 active adapter. Others have been getting 4k on MacBooks, but they have HD4000 graphics or above.8. Make sure to turn shaprness down to 0 and turn off noise reduction. Then, make sure you mess around with the calibration settings for awhile. If you don't, the picture quality is terrible.

I am currently using a Moshi connect mini display port to HDMI connector that is only HDMI 1.3 compatible which will only give me 1080p @ 60Hz. The new adaptor should yield 4k @ 30Hz. I tested it at 24Hz and still fine for me.Initial Thoughts:1. 39\" is about as big as I would like on my desk. I considered getting the 50\", glad I did not.2. In 1080p, everyone in my large office can read everything, even text in web pages. That is one thing I wanted because I need to share things, so I put that material on this monitor allowing guests to stay seated, as opposed to breathing down my neck and bending over to see.3. The colors are slightly overstauratex, but look great. Will stick to the iMac 27\" for Photoshop color correction and saturation adjustments.4. There is a slight humming with some images. i.e. I am rolling through the screensaver/backgrounds at 1/min and some hum, some don't, and some hum loud enough o annoy me into typing this. Not a deal breaker, but I had not seen reviews mentioning this fault. The hum is a wiser volume.5. Setup and compatibility with my iMac and mavericks is perfect.6. I am glad I made this purchase.7. I know they will probably release a HDMI 2.0 version soon, which will support 4k @ 60Hz, where my version SE39UY04 is 1.4a and thus limited to 4k @ 30Hz, but I really don't care. People complaining about mouse trails @ 30Hz should hire an exterminator, or get a hobby. Maybe dating women or something.8. The mount is not VESA, so I am using the integrated stand, its nice (all glass), but the angle is 90* to normal, and monitors need to be tilted up another 10-20deg. I put a small strip of 1/4 EVA foam under the front to hold a nice viewing angle. EVA has tons of friction, and dampens vibration, so a plus.9.

I did some research in advance and found my old AMD radeon 5850 didn't support 4k, so I picked up a new nVidia card that did (GTX 760). I've been using AMD cards for almost 20 years, but they're going for stupidly inflated prices right now, so you'll probably find better deals in the nVidia family.- Initial picture quality on first boot looks really blown out and over-saturated.-- step 1: Don't waste your time messing with the settings, go directly to the Seiki website and download the Seiki 39\" firmware labeled \"with backlight and temp\". I tried the 50\" firmware as others had suggested, but this caused my display to start blinking out at random. Follow the instructions on the Seiki page.

The advanced (factory) menu can be reached by pressing menu on the remote, then entering 0,0,0,0. Under \"Factory Menu\" -> \"Others\" -> \"Other Setting\" scroll all the way down (to a second page) and you'll find that you can turn the 4-hour standby to \"Off\", this will prevent the monitor from attempting to turn off in the middle of your work or gaming. There are lots of settings in the factory menu that could mess up your display so you should probably use some caution before changing things you don't recognize.-- step 3: If you're on a Windows 7 PC, go to the control panel, choose display, then choose \"adjust cleartype text\" and run through the wizard.-- step 4: If you're using an nVidia video card and the HDMI cable, go to the control panel, choose \"NVIDIA Control Panel\", then under display, choose adjust desktop color settings. Under Digital color format choose YCbCr444 instead of RGB. This should clear up any remaining color issues.---------------------------------------------------------Sure, this display doesn't have boutique level build quality, but for the money it is amazing! It would be even better if the screen was curved and maybe a bit wider aspect ratio, but those features come with a 100x greater pricetag. I know some people have knocked the 30Hz refresh rate, but for desktop apps I haven't noticed any 'lag'. For gaming the screen scales 1080p quite well at up to 120Hz (although it may say you're only at 60Hz). I don't think many developers have actually tested or optimized their games for 4k play yet and good luck finding any commercial background images at the 4k size or websites that scale to fill a full-screen browser window!- updateHad the monitor for about a month now and still love it. It's on the verge of being too big, I rarely use the upper corners, nor do I maximize most programs. Also added instructions for turning off the 4-hour standby, so I no longer need to keep the remote handy. Turning the backlight down to about 56% really helped with eyestrain. Still haven't noticed the 30hz being any sort of limitation, but I haven't done any FPS games at 4k yet. Realistically, I'm going to run most games at 1920x1080 (1080p) which the monitor does nicely at 120hz and that's more in line with what my graphics card can pump out.", "Date": "January 21, 2014"}, {"Title": "For those that have problems where the TV is turned off every 4 hrs", "Author": "Anonymous", "ReviewID": "R1DHJBF9CA4JRQ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "For those that have problems where the TV is turned off every 4 hrs.You can turn off the 4hrs standby feature in the service menu.

This will turn on the TV automatically without the remote when power is applied.For example, I have a power strip that has a master and secondary outlets. I plug my computer to the master outlet and my monitor to one of the secondary outlets.

It takes a few modifications to the settings to make it operate as a monitor as opposed to a TV.  As others have noted, the sharpness should be changed to 0 or 1 and noise reduction turned off.  It worked immediately via HDMI with my 2012 Macbook Pro Retina with Mavericks loaded.  It also worked immediately from my Windows PC via HDMI out on a NVIDIA GTX 650 TI.  With both, pictures from my dSLR look amazing.  4k videos from YouTube look very good also, but my Uverse 18 Mbps connection can't keep up.  I also plan to use it for software development, so I set the display to a contrast of 40 and a brightness of 37.  I then use the NVidia Control Panel and turn down the brightness and contrast when doing development and work stuff and turn them up when viewing photos or video.  With the default display settings, I couldn't get the white to not be too bright for reading text without eye strain even with the NVidia settings.  I've ordered a NVIDIA GTX 770 with 4 GB of memory, since the GTX 650 TI with 1 GB is a bit on the low end with the GPU and memory for 4k.  The display is limited to a 30 HZ refresh rate by HDMI 1.4, but I think that some of the problems noted are with video cards with not enough processing power or memory.  Since Seiki isn't known for reliability, I took a 3 year Square Trade warranty.  The only slight defect that I've noticed is that the left and right (a little more) fade some, especially with a white window on the screen, but I don't think I have any dead pixels and other cheaper LED sets have the same backlighting issues.", "Date": "December 15, 2013"}, {"Title": "Huge.

Settings out of the box are aimed at TV, not computer display. As everyone else notes, a ton of tweaking is necessary. The generic menu is not sufficient for correct setup, the service menu is necessary: Menu+0+0+0+0 on the remote will get you there. I bought this monitor because of the price/resolution. This is a pretty astonishing price for a 4k monitor. I wouldn't expect it to hold up against a monitor 1/4 the res and 1/2 the price, and it doesn't. But still, at 1/2 the price per pixel of a Dell Ultrasharp, it's worth considering. I have this as part of a large multi-head solution. I would not recommend this monitor in multi-head solutions, but as the sole (large) monitor it's probably fine.Synopsis:The good: * Pixels Pixels Everywhere * ~25% cost per pixel of a 30\" Ultrasharp.The Bad:  * 30hz max at 4k res over HDMI 1.4  * No displayport / linked DVI-D  * poor color  * poor viewing angles  * Glossy appearanceIn Detail:Viewing Angle:  The viewing angle on this is not what I'm accustomed to with IPS panels. It's actually a considerable problem on a monitor this size. Running Windows 8 at standard resolutions, I have to sit close enough to this screen that I can very easily see a difference in brightness in different areas because the monitor occupies so much of my field of view. In other words, you end up looking at this monitor from a huge range of viewing angles (probably as wide as 60 degrees) and at the edges you can visibly notice dimming. The fact that I have 24\" IPS monitors on either side of this probably makes this all the more noticeable.Color:  After a couple of hours manually tweaking I've gotten close to matching whites with my IPS panels. The color can get nice and saturated if that's what you like. However there is a definite black compression as you dive into the lowlights. The black point, as with most TVs, is far too high. Again, I'm used to IPS panels which have the best color reproduction, so I'm quite biased and picky. I will not be using this monitor for photo editing. Let's just say that.Refresh Rate:  It's pretty obvious that the 30hz limitation at 4k res is one of the ways the cost of this monitor is possible. Without a displayport or 2x DVI-D, you can't actually feed the monitor faster than 30hz, so the internals can assume that limitation. At this price point, I'm not going to complain about that. You can definitely feel the refresh rate when you drag the cursor or move windows. Video is not a problem. I have not tried gaming yet other than minecraft, and I will say that Minecraft at 4k is gloriously ironic. Also dizzying.  The other thing to note is you need a reasonably recent video card which supports HDMI 1.4 to actually run this monitor at 4k. Any GTX 600 or later should suffice.Glossy:  The screen has a glossy finish, like a lot of older laptops. I really don't see the point of glossy finish in a computer monitor. It's a bit distracting, especially if there are lights behind you. Minor gripe.Summary:  A lot of my complaints come from being accustomed to IPS panels and having them right next to this monitor for direct comparison.If this were your only monitor I'm sure most of them wouldn't be as obtrusive. I would not use this as a solution for  media professionals. It's great for fitting oh so very much code on screen at one time if you're a programmer, which is my use. I'll continue using my IPS panels for photo editing and gaming. For the price, I'm not unhappy. But it's also not on the same level of quality as the more expensive monitors.Monitors I have attached to the same machine for direct comparison:Dell u2412m Ultrasharp 24\" 1920x1200Dell 3007 Ultrasharp 30\" 2650 x 1600Lenovo LT2452p 24\" 1920x1200Video Card: Radeon7970", "Date": "November 27, 2013"}, {"Title": "Great Computer Monitor for a Non-Gamer", "Author": "P. Daniel \"PDNewman\"", "ReviewID": "R7RR4PD86KV6O", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "Overall I'm satisfied with this TV.  It's exactly what I expected, having read a number of reviews.  Be aware that it's definitely not for everyone, and I don't know that I'd recommend it to someone who's looking for a 4K TV to use specifically as a television.  The limitations of HDMI 1.4, only being able to do 3840 x 2160 at 30 Hz, are a significant detriment.However, I bought it to use as a very high resolution computer monitor, and it serves that purpose very well.  Here are some of my observations:1) The image is very bright, sharp and vibrant.  I chose the \"Cool\" color temperature setting, which looks the most accurate to my eye.2) It's questionable whether full resolution is ideal in this size.  The pixel size is extremely small, so I find I need to be about 3' away from the screen at most to be able to read it effectively.  Two feet is better.  It's pretty stressful on the eyes from 2' away.  The 50\" makes the pixels a bit larger, and would allow you to be a bit further away, so for some that might be a better option.  On the other hand, for AutoCAD drawings, spreadsheets, Photoshop editing and other programs that require a lot of real estate on screen and a lot of pixels, it's pretty amazing.3) I've had some issues with EDID.  My laptop, after negotiating with the monitor, came up at 3840x2160 @ 29Hz.  The monitor does NOT work at that frequency, and the image dropped out more than once per minute.  I manually changed it to 30 Hz and it's completely stable.  I'm not sure why the monitor would allow a frequency it can't really handle, but it does.4) I believe it's because of the EDID table in the display, but it doesn't support any intermediate resolution between 3840x2160 and 2048x1536.  For me that's pretty frustrating.  I was hoping there would be a resolution half way in between these that would allow me to work a little more comfortably while still getting more pixels than my built-in 1920x1080.  I presume the computer is getting the list of available display resolutions from the monitor through the HDMI connection.  The manual for the monitor is somewhat pathetic, and doesn't contain a list of supported resolutions.  I also had issues trying to get it to operate at 1920x1080@60 Hz from my laptop.  I manually changed the settings in Windows, but it simply wouldn't stick.  I'd hit \"Apply\" and the computer would just change right back again.  It could be my laptop, but when I connect my laptop to a 1080p plasma it detects the resolution and switches to it perfectly.5) The built-in speakers are pathetic.  Really, really poor.  Plan on hooking your source to a stereo if you want decent sound.In summary, I gave this display three stars because of the speakers, the EDID issues, and the 30 Hz limitation at 4K.  I'd definitely recommend it to someone with good eyesight who wants a 4K computer monitor.  It's so reasonably priced you just can't argue with it.  If you want a 4K TV, you should probably wait a year or two.  The prices will be much more reasonable then, and it's not as if you're missing any content.  Plus, frankly, until you get up to 70 or 80\" (or beyond), 4K really doesn't offer any perceptible improvement from any reasonable viewing distance.", "Date": "November 15, 2013"}, {"Title": "Amazing Value!

Out of the box, the color was really awful and I second-guessed buying it at first. Spend a little time fine-tuning the display and it'll be fine.2) Yes, the TV does do 4k, but at a 30hz refresh rate. That's fine for movies, but for games, it's almost unplayable. It's possible to get 1080 to run at 120hz, which is amazing, but it's really hard to settle for 1080 once you've seen how gorgeous games look on 4k (and most people are buying this TV for the 4k to begin with.) 1080 upscaled, however, is still better than 1080 that's not upscaled.

VERY happy I did. Plus it's available now and I didn't have to wait until the Sony's ship next month.  I've seen the Sony sets running 4k native demos but this is practically as good and I saved $3600.Definitely recommend the new OPPO player to go with it as this set is a basic 4k panel with no up conversion processing or bells and whistles.  You can also use the OPPO player to upconvert your Apple TV, Cable Box, Roku etc by using the HDMI In connection on the OPPO player which will take advantage of the Marvell QDEO video processor in the player.The wife and I sit fairly close as it's on a stand right at the foot of our bed.  Even though it's only 50\" I see a definite improvement in the detail and smoothness of the image from 1080p movies as long as I'm using the Oppo 103/105, Sony 790 or Samsung 7500.  Even regular DVD's looked better upscaled to 4k instead of 1080p.  The image appeared so detailed that it would create the illusion of glasses-free 3D.  My experience with an Onkyo TX-NR809 which uses the same QDEO chip in the new Oppo players was disappointing, producing a some what fuzzy picture. Given the age of the receiver it could be that the up scaling chip is a different version then what is being used by Oppo, I've been unable to find out.My experience with upscaling TV (720p or 1080i) through my player was satisfying probably because most receivers don't use a chip as good as OPPO does for processing.No dead pixels and the set seems sturdy enough.

It was fun while it lasted. The humming noise I was experiencing returned for a few days last week. It disappeared again but now the TV makes a strange crackling popcorn noise every 10-15 minutes. It actually sounds like something in the circuit in the back is being fried. Just based on all the reviews, apparently Seiki has terrible customer service. Do I really want to deal with Seiki? Hells to the no-no. I have until January 31st to return the TV to Amazon (kudos again to Amazon for their awesome return policy). I will be parting ways with the TV today. Big ups to Seiki for trying to make a name for themselves, but you can't sacrifice quality for affordability. You will lose every time and end up tarnishing your name instead. At the end of the day, it's hundreds of hard earned dollars people are plunking down so no matter how good of a bargain it is, the damn thing still has to work!!! Otherwise it's just throwing money in the toilet. My buddy who purchased his Seiki set from Sears, he's also returning his set this week out of fear of it breaking. I also now see that Amazon has a header that they no longer offer this TV because of problems with their \"packaging.\" Amazon... it's not your packaging that's causing all the defects, it's the TV itself!!!So how does this TV perform? If you're buying this as a TV, forget about it, go somewhere else. You want to use this as a computer monitor? Now we're cookin'!Before I go any further: turn the Sharpness down to 0. Just do it. Trust me.1080p content on this set is terrible. Alright, I'm exaggerating. It's probably what you would expect from other third tier brands like Westinghouse, Emerson, Sanyo, etc. which means it's super mediocre to not very good. Just because it's 4K doesn't mean squat. In fact, because of this set's super weak upscaling, sometimes certain 1080i/p content will look WORSE.Since this set disappointingly has no display port, I had to spend $405 upgrading my main PC's graphics card to pump some 4K via HDMI (I went from an Nvidia GTX 580 to an Nvidia GTX 770). While waiting for my brand spanking new card to arrive, I was running my PC on it at 1080p 60Hz. I threw up every day and wondered if this was a worthwhile investment. Then the GTX 770 arrived.For reasons beyond my technical understanding, once you feed this thing a native 4K source, IT IS GLROUIOUS!!! It's like Moses parting the Red Sea. Sliced bread. Canned tuna. Yeah, it's that good. You'd think this was a $5,000 set. This is where it becomes worth every penny and so much more. It pretty much becomes a giant iPad. It's like going from SD to HD. It's really damn good.What's the downside? Well... there are plenty. HDMI 1.4 maximizes at 30Hz. As much as I'd love a simple firmware upgrade to HDMI 2.0 to be possible, it is more akin to wishful thinking. HDMI 2.0 is a hardware upgrade, it can't be fixed simply with a firmware despite what Sony claims they'll do to their 4K sets at the \"end of the year.\" FYI, they said that way back in October. It's almost the \"end of the year\" and still no sight of this mythical HDMI 2.0 firmware for their 4K sets.As a result of the 30Hz limitation, the mouse pointer has noticeable lag. It bothered me slightly the first day of use, eventually I got used to it. You're better off switching back to 1080p for games and getting that 60Hz. For content creators, text editors, or if you just want to surf the web with a retina display (because it's AWESOME!)... this monitor is excellente. Thank the Lord Baby Jesus for Amazon for giving me a courtesy price match. This TV fluctuated in price 4 times since I've purchased it. Amazon let me price match it when it was at it's lowest price even though they didn't have to because well... they're the best.With that said, I would have never purchased this TV at its initial MSRP of $1500. To be perfectly honest, the 30Hz limitation bothers me enough that I'll probably sell this thing next year once Seiki releases a 39\" version with HDMI 2.0. 50\" is slightly too large for my taste and the 50\" HDMI 2.0 version will probably sell at the $1500 MSRP range while I'm hoping the 39\" HDMI 2.0 version will stay at sub $1000 levels.The sound... yeah, it's... yeah... did I mention this was from a third tier brand HDTV? I think my Galaxy Note 3 probably had better sound than this thing.Some \"professional\" reviews have knocked the set because of its barebone features. That helps keep costs down and if you're using this as a monitor, who the cares about your TV being \"smart\"? It's still a dummy when compared to a full fledged media center PC so I don't know if I would consider that a negative since I don't care about it. Smart TV features are the same vein as 3D anyway... it's all a gimmick to get people to upgrade their sets. 4K is the next new gimmick. However, 4K does actually have a very practical use for certain people. If you sit 3 feet or less from your TV and you use it as a PC monitor, as I mentioned, 4K is dope as hell. If this isn't you and you mainly just watch TV, then forget about it. There are plenty of sets from the major brands within the same price range and size as this TV that will do 10 times better job of producing an HD picture.The last and biggest negative: be prepared to get a few sets before you get one that's working. Seiki has a crapton of QC issues. I had to get my first set replaced since there was a crack in the bezel. Major props to Amazon once again for sending out a replacement in 2 days time. One of my friends purchased from Sears and had to get two replacements. His first set had a big black vertical line. His second set had no sound. His third set was the lucky one. My replacement set actually also had a weird humming noise, but it resolved after I updated the firmware. Keeping my fingers crossed that nothing else goes wrong. This set was worth the trouble obtaining despite all of this. The price that Amazon is selling it for, it's worth every penny if you're just looking to experience a giant iPad as your monitor (which again... is AWESOME!!!).", "Date": "December 10, 2013"}, {"Title": "I'm glad I got it", "Author": "J.

It looks like Seiki may have addressed the quality related problems with the earlier units as this unit seems better in ever way.Another note: I tried to play some 3d content which this unit supposedly doesn't support.

All the reading I've done on blogs and review sites, including Apple's indicate that only a late 2013 rMBP will run this at the highest rez. I was a little hasty, and after testing it with my 2012 MB Air, and 2012 Mac Mini and confirming it wouldn't work, I bought a new 15\" rMBP to get this up and running. The kid that I bought it from had one, and had made a few adjustments to color, contrast, and sharpness, and I was wowed by it. Just for kicks and giggles, after buying the new rMBP, I tried my wife's Early 2011 MBP 15\" and it worked perfectly, even without the Accell HDMI adapter suggested in most posts and blogs on this topic. I'm not a gamer, but just wanted a little more real estate. Sharing this to give a huge thumbs up for use as a monitor. Love using it for XBMC.

The picture collaboration is a little off but that only takes 10min to fix. People also say that the sound is horrible, but I find it the exact opposite the sound is amazing for built in speakers, the speakers are on the bottom on the screen and round from one end to the other, meaning about 39 in of speaker. It also has it's own surround sound option to make the speakers even better. The only big issue I found is that when Netflix or amazon video gets slow data the pictures start to pixilate and looks horrible. But that's a common issue with streaming period, it just looks even worse because of how detailed this tv is.

Now I digress.There are two reasons I bought this:1) To devolop 3D in Blender at the crazy 4K resolution.2) 1080P @ 120Hz,  1440P @ 72Hz (More on getting these refresh rates below.)Out of the Box:I pretty much guarantee that if you want to game you will hate this TV out of the box as the input lag is insane.  I knew this when I purchased the TV.  It is easily corrected by flashing the set with the 50\" firmware from the same model.  This is a known issue and if you search around the net and through the previous reviews other's will have confirmed this.  However I wanted a baseline so I loaded up some games to test out of the box performance.  As expected, games were next to unplayable at any resolution, 1440P doesn't even show up in Windows.  All of this I knew and expected before buying the TV.Now to the GOOD stuff:Once the steps below are followed I achieved 120Hz (1920x1080) and 72Hz (2560x1440) and confirmed no frames skipped by running the automatic tests... search \"Monitor Refresh Rate Test\" and choose the UFO frame skipper result since I can't post the link.I have a GTX680 (so I can only attest to my results using an nVidia based video card.)  I am also typing this at work so I am providing this as best as I can from memory, you will need to have some idea how to navigate Windows yourself.DISCLAIMER: Flash the firmware of your TV at your own risk.  As the manufacturer states this is a process you should only do IF and only IF you experience the issues requiring the firmware.1) Crossflash firmware to the 50\" (there are instructions to do this in the other reviews here on Amazon.)  This firmware removes a frame skipping issue with the 39\" and is why the out-of-box performance in games is so bad.2) Download and install the nVidia pixel clock patcher.  I can't post the link.2b) There is an ATI/AMD pixel clock patch as well based on searches.3) Open nVidia control panel and navigate to the change resolution and click on \"custom resolution\" and add two new resolutions: 1920x1080, 120Hz refresh rate AND add one for 2560x1440, 60Hz refresh (you can try 72), each one will be tested by the OS before the custom resolution can be made available as a choice.4) Apply one of the new resolutions and run the frame skipping test I provided earlier in the review.I hope these help some folks out and I had to hunt and search different posts for all this information.After I had all the above setup games were way more snappy than my old 32\" 1080P Vizio.  I am so happy with the results: 39\" 1440P @ 72Hz!!! or 1080P at 120Hz, and then a 4K desktop for Blender development.  Very happy.The only complaint I have is the 30Hz 4K limitation right now with HDMI 1.4.  The mouse is pretty laggy on the screen and I have to move it kind of slow because I am very accustomed to a 60Hz response.  I WILL be purchasing the HDMI 2.0 version of this display several months from now.

The monitor only turns off.  This is not surprising since it is a TV, but, when the monitor turns off, the computer changes the video card to 1024x768 resolution so when you turn the TV back on, all programs have been shifted to the top left corner and been reduced to a 1024x768 window.  I currently get around this at work by turning off the \"sleep\" timer and running a screen saver on the computer.- The TV is glossy and reflective and does have a bit more glare than I would like.  If I could find a 39\" glare guard, I would probably pick one up if it wasn't too expensive.The 30 Hz refresh is not a problem for me.  I won't be playing games that would be affected by that and I don't notice any problem with mouse response being slow.Overall, I like it enough to have picked up a second one.

There are no fancy bells or whistles here, but rather a mid-to-high quality LCD panel with a ridiculous number of pixels, a native 120Hz refresh rate and a ~6ms response time.  For something which is advertised as a television, it sure does a fantastic impression of a high-end computer monitor as well.This is exactly how I use this set: connected to my HTPC/gaming rig in the living.  The versatility of this monitor makes it well suited for this purpose, as it can be switched seamlessly between 1080p, 1440p and 2160p (or basically anything else) on the fly, depending on what your needs are for the moment.  The panel is not picky - if a display format fits inside HDMI 1.4, this monitor will display it like a champ, and the 50\" version is the perfect size for someone wanting to play video games from the sofa while sitting 2-3m away.In 1080p and 2160p, the panel looks fantastic once you get it calibrated.  This is not a quick process, and the monitor will not look great out of the box (as others have mentioned) - it took me about a week of trial and error to get it perfect.  Some have commented that the picture will either look over-saturated, or lose black detail, and I had the same experience at first, but with a little bit of patience and some calibration utilities, I think the result is fantastic.  Colors are vivid, whites are crisp, and blacks are properly detailed after adjusting both the menu options and the global color settings for my video card.  The amount of dynamic range you can squeeze out of this panel is actually pretty impressive, especially when driven at 1080p or 2160p.  At non-integer multiples of the native resolution, color distortion becomes noticeable.One of the best things about this monitor is that the LCD panel itself is driven at a native 120Hz.  This is something that is basically only found on expensive computer monitors and rarely on television sets.  For gaming where there is a lot of fast action, 120 fps cannot be beat.  For those who prefer a higher resolution, the monitor will run 1440p at about 80Hz, which still provides a fantastically smooth gaming experience.  If RTS games are your thing (or you don't care about playing games at 30Hz), then glorious 2160p gives you all the screen area you can handle at once.  On my HTPC, I also have SVP set up to provide motion interpolation for television broadcasts - Football and Hockey at 120Hz looks great, and there is minimal motion blur.There are only a few cons about this monitor:- Slight backlight bleeding around the edges.  Not unusual for a 50\" display, and it is not noticeable at all unless the screen is completely black.- HDMI limitations.  The panel itself could be driven 2160p 120Hz if the interface supported it.- Limited menu options.", "Date": "February 11, 2014"}, {"Title": "Seiki makes a great TV at a great price, but be aware this is not a Smart TV", "Author": "Christopher J.

Games in 4k look amazing even only running 30 fps. I really only play games that can use a controller on it though, because the input lag is more noticeable with a mouse. Also 4k makes the cursor so small that it's hard to keep track of it. Games like Diablo 3 are almost unplayable because I constantly have to find the mouse. By the time I find the mouse I'm already being over run by a horde of demons.The 50 inch model works great just as a regular set though.

I purchased this display to use it as a replacement for a 30\" 2560 X 1600 display. It works very well for that use. I do not notice any lag or strange movement when using my track ball that others talk about. That may be because I have the track ball using an extremely accelerated rate. I like the very large display space. Excel spreadsheets are a little small but can easily be enlarged & give me more usable space. A little larger screen size would help here. But the Seiki 50\" would be too large when having customers on the other side of my work table.Unlike many that said they had to make adjustments to get the display to work with their systems I had no problems. I have turned down the back lighting to 50 from the default 100 to cut down on brightness. These adjustments are more for personal taste & use than others have made it seem.I'm watching & listening to a movie that I have copied from one of my DVDs to a hard drive. The screen looks very good even at the close 18-24\" that I have it. The HDMI connection passes sound even on my Mac Pro & ATI 5870 video card. The sound must be controlled from the Seiki display/TV. I have not been able to pass sound to my 70\" Sharp 1080p display/TV to date. Later I'll try to see if the ATI 3870 video card will work with this Seiki display. I see no problems such as tearing or jerky viewing that others talk about. I do not play games so I'll leave that subject to others to test & discuss. Now to see how my customers react to the size of this display. As long as they can see me all should be good. Also the sound is better than the built-in Mac Pro sound is.Currently I also have my main 30\" display attached to the ATI 5870 & my other 30\" display & my 70\" display attached to the ATI 3870 single slot video card. Other than the reviews with the 15\" high resolution MacBook Pro with the Nividia video card system I do not see others list the video card that they use. I wasn't sure whether if either of my systems would work with this high of a resolution. But the display  comes on & displays a 3840 X 2160 @ 30 Hz when started. Being a TV the screen doesn't blank itself out most of the time like a regular computer display & even my 70\" Sharp does. A few times the screen has darkened like we come to expect with our computer displays but not always. I didn't think that the Seiki was being shut down but maybe I missed something. My movie that I'm watching using Apple's DVD Player will not display on the 70\" Sharp. But they will display on this same screen when using my MacBook Pro with it. The Sharp is connected to the ATI 3870 while the Seiki is connected to the ATI 5870.When I have more than a few hours of use with this new screen I may have a few more things to say. But at present all I can say is that the box came with many bumps & holes but with no internal problems or scratches. This came from Amazon for $499 with free 2 day delivery on Saturday by FedEx. Maybe this is why Amazon had a couple of dozen of this model with $50-100 off warehouse deals. That made me worry as too whether this display had already been to someones home or office & was returned. Maybe the box problem comes from cheap cardboard use. The display comes in the usable foam bag that other screens come in. There is good sturdy foam packing on all 4 corners that extend farther that most that I've seen.The future will tell me whether I have anything important that I do not like about this display.

I mean, it makes for a truly expansive workspace while still being able to view all of it with no more than minor eye-movement; and 30Hz is sufficient for coding IMO.Here's the thing: in order to obtain sufficiently sharp text you need to dial-in a truly precise color calibration, without which your code and browser-text will look as though 'sharpening' is not fully turned off (giving the impression that either pixels are missing from your anti-aliased fonts or, alternatively, a splotchy/halo effect). Achieving a sense of textual-nirvana is no easy feat, certainly on the particular unit I received, unless you have invested in dedicated calibration hardware (I hadn't). Instead I generated a series of reasonably accurate color-profiles using software, to obtain the best calibration I could ~ ultimately using multiple computers.Note that I experienced zero dead or stuck pixels ~ there's over 8 million of them.The end-result for me was beautifully even white pages covered with frustratingly fuzzy black/grey text, some red/blue bleed depending on text shade & background color, and a rather narrow color-gamut with images. In particular, some of the Seiki picture adjustments appear to have compounding effects upon one another making it that much harder to dial things in correctly (e.g: contrast is expected to have an effect on brightness, yet not the other way around; and too much contrast crushes the blacks as was noted by another reviewer).  Forget about calibration at all without first updating the firmware, as that helped considerably with the unit I received. Viewing off-center is not a consideration for me as I'm sitting directly in front of it.That aside, calling Seiki for \"support\" was the singularly worst experience in ~30 years of working in IT (for me).  Eventually reached someone who insisted they could not support anyone using this display as computer monitor rather than as a television. This particular aspect drove me to return the display rather than exchange for another unit.Amazon, on the other hand, have been exemplary: easy to reach, pleasant and knowledgable tech-support.It's great to see companies like Seiki push the envelope in terms of cost/resolution; they'd potentially have a winner on their hands if (for example) these were fully calibrated at the factory and/or their tech-support were to significantly improve.", "Date": "November 29, 2013"}, {"Title": "Absolutely amazing for the price.", "Author": "Carl", "ReviewID": "R1CORJNJNJKGBQ", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "For 4K, this monitor is dirt cheap.  For watching 4K YouTube videos, it really looks great.  I'm using it as a computer monitor.  To get good video quality, it is necessary to completely disable some of the features, most notably the \"sharpening\" which is on by default and makes everything look horrible.  Once disabled, the image is quite good, but not perfect.There are two drawbacks to this monitor that are livable at the price it sells for, but buyers should be aware of:  The first is that there is a lag between the computer signal and the monitor, and no \"game mode\" to get rid of it.  So, if you move your mouse, what you see on the screen is slightly delayed.  It's not a huge delay, but kind of annoying, and certainly not good for realtime applications like gaming.  The second is that mid-tones flicker a little bit - So a solid medium gray screen will flicker noticeably, for example.  For video this is not so bad, but as a computer monitor it is a little more noticeable / annoying.Overall, though, at this moment in time, I don't know of a cheaper way to get 4K, and in general, having a giant 4K computer monitor is pretty darn cool.

A lot of the \"reviewers\" are having major issues with this set but still giving it 4-5 stars. It also seems like the people who have had the same issues as me are being voted as not helpful. Do not be fooled by these \"reviews\", this TV is trash.Where do you start with something this bad? I bought this because it's a 4K TV for under $1000 and thought that at that price point this would be a good deal. I had never seen the TV running in person but still decided to buy it anyways based on reviews from several sites.I unboxed it, hooked it up and immediately noticed issues. The hardest one to get over was a very obvious red tint to everything. Tans were pink, reds were hot, greens were over saturated and blue looked neon. I figured I could fix this by adjusting the tint on the TV but when I went to the options the tint slider was disabled. No matter what I tried I could not enable the tint slider. From what I can tell after hours of reading forums is that tint only works on inputs that aren't HDMI. The \"solution\" was to adjust tint at the device level which is not an option if you care about even somewhat accurate color. My Regza from 2006 has tint controls so there's really no excuse for this.There also appears to be something wrong with the image processor in the TV which resulted in large blobs during video playback. I used the same video feed on the same cable to this TV and my Regza and noticed a startling difference in picture quality. Adjusting sharpness made things look even weirder and to not get a picture with ghost outlines sharpness must be set to around 5 (it's at 100 by default) but then stuff gets blurry.The screen is glossy and looks like it could scratch easily. The glossy also appears to be slightly tinted/UV'ed to get better color? It doesn't work and makes things look weird.The TV also doesn't appear to hold signal on HMDI connectors when turned off so my PC would lose the monitor when it was powered off then re-detect every time I turned it on. Again my Regza from 2006 (and all my other monitors) have no issues keeping the HDMI signal active when the screen is powered off.4K at 30Hz is horrible and tears. If you're doing anything other than looking at a static or near static image on this TV at 4K expect it to studder or tear. My TV also started power cycling at random when it was sent a 4K signal. Others on the forums have mentioned this and there might be a firmware work around. Still I'm not going to pay this much money for something then hope that software eventually makes it usable. 4K was essentially broken for me on this TV out of the box.The TV base and remote are beyond cheap. I felt nervous putting the TV on the base since it appears to be made entirely of cheap, easy to flex plastic. The glass base is nice but I almost felt like it was heavy enough to snap the TV support if not handled carefully.The remote is about as Fisher Price as they come and seems like it should come with a $60 tube Chinese brand. Buttons do the wrong thing when pushed at random and the remote looks and feels cheap. Crappy cable box remotes feel better, work better, and have more functionality than this remote.Don't buy this. Go and spend the money on a high quality 1080P TV or wait for good quality 4K TV prices to come down.

I was not expecting to replace it until the 4k TVs dropped in price significantly and the 4k content expanded. When this TV came out, I read/watched some reviews on it and thought it would be a great replacement for my TV... I was thrilled when I was able to get my hands on one.Construction: 3/5 starsOut of the box, the TV is easy to set up. It looks very sleek and the thin border has it barely taking up much more room then my 46\" TV did. Upon closer inspection, some flaws were evident: the frame is cheap looking and has sharp, unrefined edges... it also has a high gloss finish and reflects background light. This is not a problem for when I watch movies with the lights out or during the daytime, but when the lights are on, depending on where you're sitting, it can be a tad bit distracting. Overall, minor complaints since this TV is far cheaper then other 4k TVs, so I had some flexibility.Remote: 0/5 starsThe remote, if seen in pictures, seems like a pretty standard remote... however, when I had it in my hand, I realized I was very wrong... the remote is more like a miniaturized version of a standard remote. It's TINY... smallest remote I own, despite the fact that it has a LOT of buttons. The buttons are small and I find myself constantly hitting two buttons at the same time by accident. The problem is, NONE of my equipment has codes for Seiki products, so none will work with the set. I need to keep the remote nearby to adjust the volume which is extremely inconvenient. If that's not all, the remote itself doesn't work right. It may work ok for a while, but out of nowhere it'll turn the TV off when I hit 'mute', or turn the mute on and off repeatedly when I tap the 'volume up' button. Then, a few minutes later, it'll work fine again. This occurs even with all other remotes removed from the room to assure that one was causing a disturbance.Finally, my Verizon Fios remote cannot be used near this TV, which is a MAJOR problem since I obviously use Fios as my TV subscription. Press the arrow buttons, guide button, channel up/down button, etc, and the volume will go up a notch each time... it's maddening. I have NEVER experienced such bizarre problems with remotes before, and I've owned a LOT of equipment and a large variety of remotes.Features: 3/5 starsI have a hard time complaining about the lack of features because I knew beforehand that it was a 'bare-bones' TV... the options were extremely limited in order to account for getting a cheap 4k TV. I did not realize how 'bare-bones' it was... picture and audio options are ultra-basic.Picture: 3/5 starsWhen I first got the TV, I placed it side-by-side with my 46\" Sony and hooked them both up to my HDMI dual-output Oppo Blu-ray player. Now, the picture isn't quite as sharp as my Sony, however I was not expecting 4k results from upscaling. My disappointment was with the color... no amount of adjusting with the TV's limited color controls could make the picture look as good as my Sony. Get the colors to a decent level and the dark areas lost nearly all detail... adjust the dark areas to get more detail, and the lighter colors looked bleached. I spend over an hour fiddling with the controls and finally came up with a compromise, but it was no where near as good as my Sony TV.One thing I didn't consider is the fact that my TV subscription still has numerous channels that aren't digital HD... these standard def channels end up being upscaled so much in order to watch on a 4k TV that the quality is terrible. I'm not sure if all upscaling systems will result in the same poor quality, but I certainly plan to consider this when I get another 4k TV in the future. If necessary, I'll wait a few more years until all channels are available in digital HD.Motion-wise, side-by-side with my Sony, I played the first 'Lord of the Rings' movie and immediately noticed a difference. Scenes looked fine if they were relatively still, however when the camera was panning across an area, my Sony displayed it perfectly smoothly, while the Seiki looked a bit odd... unnatural. The problem here was it was very obvious and distracting at times.As for displaying 4k content, I have a Denon receiver and Oppo Blu-ray player, both of which upscale to 4k. Testing out both independently, I was not able to view 4k content on this TV... nothing but static, distorted images and flashing.Audio: 0/5 starsThe sound from this TV is absolutely awful. First, the volume can be adjusted from 1 to 100... at level 1, the sound is quite loud (volume is muted one step down at level 0). When in my living room alone when it's quiet, it's just way too loud. This is a very strange problem I have never encountered before. I own 6 other flatscreen TVs and I've had countless other TVs, both flatscreen and CRT, and have never had a TV that you simply can't turn down. Using a sound meter, I measured the Seiki TV from 3' directly in front of the screen and it was between 55 dB and 60 dB with the sound at level 1, the lowest it will go without muting. My Sony TV, which also has a 1-100 scale volume control, had to be on level 27 to reach the same volume level as the Seiki.Second, the audio quality is terrible... sounds worse then the speaker on my laptop... very much like the sound is coming through a tin can. I've played with the audio settings quite a bit and found no resolution to the problem.--------------------------Problem Resolution:I wrote to Seiki Digital's customer service department concerning the three main problems at the time: The problems when using my Fios remote, the extremely loud volume, and the 4k input troubles. For the remote, I was simply told that there's nothing they can do about the interference. As for the volume issue, I was told to place a 'towel or piece of cardboard' behind the TV to reduce the 'echo'. Seiki Digital suggested that the problem was my room as it's probably echoing, however my living room has various furniture, carpet, and acoustic panels... there is absolutely no echo. This is also the fourth TV I've had in that same room, and I've never had a TV that can't be reduced to a whisper.As for the 4k input problem, I was sent a link to updated software for the TV. After successfully updating, it did not resolve the issue. This is extremely odd as I noticed another reviewer here was able to run their Oppo player through this TV.I wrote to Seiki a second time, this time mentioning the crazy remote and updating them on the fact that I still cannot watch 4k content. I have not heard back from them yet, but I'll update this review when I do. I have little hope in resolving these issues since if there's anything wrong with the TV, as the warranty states, the cost of shipping it back will come out of my pocket ($110 via UPS), and I have no intention of doing so. I'd rather leave it as it is... there's really no guarantee they can even fix it since they don't seem to consider any of the issues I'm dealing with as actual 'problems'.--------------------------In the end, this was certainly no competition for my 46\" Sony, so I moved it to my bedroom. I purchased a sound bar, turned the audio on the TV off, and placed a piece of electrical tape over the remote sensor. I have to manually turn the TV on and off now and use a separate remote to adjust the volume, but it's at least useable now.As much as I was looking forward to getting this TV, I'm extremely disappointed at what I received. As a TV, it's barely useable as intended. Worst TV I've ever owned. It also made me realize what my minimum expectations are when it comes to TVs... I would never again get a TV that had bare minimum features for supposed 'cutting-edge technology'.--------------------------UPDATE: I originally gave this TV two stars, however nearly a year later I've decided to remove one star. In addition to the sound bar that I purchased to deal with the sound issues, I've also had to purchase a programmable remote to deal with the remote issues that cause bizarre behavior with this TV. This does not solve all the problems as I cannot shut the audio off entirely... turn the volume all the way down, and it's back on when you turn the TV off and on again. Plug a device into the 3.5mm headphone output and the volume will go off, but you have to disconnect and reconnect the connection EACH TIME you power on the TV, otherwise the volume is back on. The number of bugs and quirks with this thing is extraordinary.In the last 9 months, my blu-ray player and receiver has received two updates and even my 5-year old Sony TV received two updates to fix very minor problems... this TV, with all its various problems and bugs, has not received a single update. I check Seiki's website regularly and there's still nothing. Strange since I've had to deal with more bugs with this TV then any other electrical device I've ever owned, and the internet is buzzing with demands for the company to fix various other issues I haven't even experienced yet. I've sent three support requests to Seiki, only the first was responded to with useless information.

My current Samsung 40\" 1080p LED monitor, (which has served me well and worth every penny!)  I bought in 2008 cost me over $2,300 and here this thing has 4X the resolution and is under $500!  GOT TO BE A CATCH... I'm used to buying auxiliary cheapo Tiger Direct 1080p 21\" monitors for $125 and tolerating a few dead / stuck pixels... So the first thing I did was plug the thing in and look for dead... stuck pixels....  So far... haven't found any.  Out of the box... if you are using it for computer monitoring you are going to want to make some adjustments.... turn the sharpening OFF!  With good REAL content it will look gosh awful.  Turn the noise reduction OFF!  My initial tweaks are Contrast-27 Brightness 56 and Color 33 and that ... by no means a professional calibration will at least allow you to get a glimpse of what this monitor can do.  The next shock is the contrast... once you have 8K+ pixels between the vector based content ... (infinite resolution) and bit mapped content in your GUI graphics which will look fuzzy.  They simply weren't designed with this high a resolution in mind so you'll have to put up with some fuzzy scaled up GUI graphics alongside your RAZOR SHARP text from vector graphics...  Suspect the GUI designers will catch up with MUCH higher res graphics before too long.  Also kept wondering about this IPS vs TN thing.... This is a TN monitor and the ones for serious color work are IPS monitors.  I looked at the monitor from EXTREME angles LEFT, RIGHT , UP, DOWN and everything looked like well balanced color.  What was the Deal???  Then in Photoshop I was editing a dark brown graphic and moved it from the bottom of the screen to the top.... went from medium brown to dark brown just moving the position on the screen! Soooo I guess for SERIOUS color work I finally see an example of some of the shortcomings of TN monitors.... Personally for me... the screen pixels and what I see on the screen are satisfying enough, and I do think I can get a hold of the areas where I need to be cautious with a TN monitor and deal with it.

At the highest resolution, most things are very clear though some text effects make the text look very fuzzy to my somewhat astigmatic eyes. The \"but\" is that with previous monitors I'd always had the system configured to power off the display after a couple minutes of inactivity.  With this as a display, it actually POWERS OFF, such that you need to use the remote control or other physical power button to re-activate the display.  That is not at all like a computer monitor, which re-activates on a signal in the video data stream.  Also, at some point during the transition from on -> off -> on again (due to power save, NOT due to powering down the entire computer) all of the windows belonging to running programs are resized to about a 3\"x5\" card size and relocated to the upper left corner of the screen.  That can be somewhat annoying, so I disabled the power off and enabled a BLANK screen saver instead.Games that can actually handle the immense resolution look awesome, but other games just \"zoom\" their graphics and actually end up looking worse because the images get somewhat jagged edges when zoomed so much.Work-related things are amazing.

You have to push menu then zero 4 times to get to the service menu and flash from there.Until display port equipped 4k monitors come down from their stratospheric pricing this is the best option out there.

I bought it for the primary purpose of using it as a computer monitor. One thing that I learned is that its not all that easy to get a Windows 7 laptop with an OEM operating system (mine were Toshiba i7 Quad-Core laptop with Intel HD Graphics 4000 and a HP i3 Dual-Core with Intel HD Graphics 3000) running 4k resolution via an HDMI cable. And as a matter of fact, I still have not got my laptops working with the monitor at the 4k resolution since the Intel driver updates are poorly supported by those manufacturers. I could probably get them going with a clean install of Windows 7 (to bypass the manufacturer restrictions).However, I didn't need to fiddle with those laptops too long because I brought my trusty Desktop out of retirement (9 year old Dell XPS). I installed a cheap used video card (ASUS GeForce 210 1GB 64-bit DDR3 PCI Express 2.0 x16) and that was plenty to get my desktop running the monitor at its maximum 4K 30hz speed via the supplied HDMI cable. I bought the video card on Amazon Warehouse for about $25. I did have to use the NVDIA Control Panel software, which came with the graphics card, to setup two Custom Resolutions (4k - 3840x2160 and 2560x1440). I use the 2560x1440 resolution for some applications that don't support 4k. But I mostly keep it set to 4k. I Googled for the best picture settings on the TV and after I tuned the picture a bit from the menu, the screen and clarity at 4k is amazing. I brought up some old pictures I'd taken on my digital camera a couple of years ago (11 Mega Pixel Camera) and I saw details in those photos that I've never noticed before. It was like looking at the pictures for the first time. Watching video at 4k is not all that great due to the low 30hz refresh rate. Most videos I watched in 4K were pretty choppy.There is a very small lag with my mouse but nothing to complain about for the beautiful crisp pictures I get. I truthfully don't notice the lag unless I'm looking for it. The monitor real estate is enormous which means less need for switching screens when I have several applications or web browsers open at once. If you are a coder or serious multi-tasker, you need to get this monitor ASAP as it will give you an instant productivity boost.I would not purchase this TV for watching TV over QAM (when the cable goes straight from the wall directly to the TV). I tried this and it didn't pick up or recognize nearly as many channels as my main TVs. And I would not recommend any type of serious gaming on this monitor at 4k resolution as the frame rate is way too low (aka... choppy picture).So in conclusion, if you need (or want) a super HD 4K monitor and have a graphics card that can run 4k resolution, then do yourself a favor and buy this TV/Monitor as soon as you can. If you are looking for a primary TV to actually watch 4K TV and or 4K videos, then wait until TV manufacturers incorporate HDMI 2.0 inputs on 4K TVs so you can get a better frame rate (aka... smoother picture).

At 1920 x 1080 however it does 60hz and games look good.  Apparently early in 2014 a new version is coming out with 60hz at full res.  You need 2 very good graphics cards to game at 4k resolution and they will cost much more than the panel so I couldn't see much point and chose to buy now.If you just need an HD TV, look elsewhere.  This unit is inferior to a normal HD TV for normal HD use.  For use as a 4k monitor however, nothing comes close for less than 4 times the price.  I consider it a bargain and I am very pleased with the purchase.  I was also pleased with Amazon despite the delivery delay.

The physical/hardware setup was pretty easy/self explanatory so I'm not going to go into that too much.  Basically you attach the foot to the stand with 5 screws.  Be careful putting them in (must be very straight aligned with the screw hole) as it seems like the plastic of the mounts is not super sturdy.  That said, once all 5 are in place the stand is pretty good.The problems began when I tried to setup the TV itself to scan for channels.  I am in an area that utilizes \"Clear QAM\" encoding, so using a standard channel search yielding zero channels found.  After a little Google search, I found that you have to go into the menu, select the \"Channel\" button (far right) and then go in and manually set it to CABLE, QAM.  You'd think that'd be it and I'd be good to go.  Nope, wrong.  They lock out this feature using a code (it's 31415).  You have to call or email them to get a code.  Well, it was 11:45pm on Friday night, so their customer service was of course unavailable.  Following their automated instructions, I sent an email and awaited the afore mentioned 31415 code to unlock my TV.  While I was waiting for the response, I went ahead and updated the TV firmware per the instructions of another reviewer from Amazon (the guy currently shown to be the \"most helpful reviewer\").  The TV rebooted and seemed fine.  I received my email reply from SEIKI with the unlock code, so I went back in to start a channel search.  Well here's the problem.  In their updated firmware they have completely removed the option to search for QAM channels.  It is simply gone.  You can do STD, IRC or HRC.  No QAM.  Nope.  Gone.Needless to say, at this point I was pretty irritated.  At this time, I remembered having read on a forum somewhere that you can actually flash the firmware from the 50\" version of this TV and it will fix the issues with the 120hz @ 1080p, as well as general input lag issues.  I figured what the heck, as I had nothing to lose at this point.  Well folks, flashing that 50\" firmware brought back the QAM search.  Now the TV is able to sucessfully find and tune QAM based channels.Should I have had to flash the 50\" firmware to be able to use this thing as a TV?  Nope, hence I have removed 1 star.Now, as a monitor, I \"love\" this TV.  4k @ 30hz is a bit choppy for standard desktop use, but for gaming?  30 FPS is really quite playable for most games other than shooter types.  Elder Scrolls Online @ 4k is so sharp.. I have also tested out Space Engineers, Kerbal Space Program, and Rust.  All just look incredible, and run fine @4k on an R9 280x 3GB card.  I am currently waiting for EVGA to mail me a pair of 6GB GTX780 cards for my main desktop and then I will be testing out fully modded Skyrim w/ENB, all 4k/8k textures @ 4k resolution.  I have high hopes.  :DFinally, the 120hz refresh rate.  This for me at least doesn't seem to be possible.  The best I can get out of it @ 1080p is 100hz using CRU (Custom Resolution Utility).  I'm pretty happy with that though.  It is a TRUE 100hz, not Interpolated.  This means that games which you are able to push past 60 FPS are just buttery smooth.  Elder Scrolls Online at ~80FPS (again this is on the R9 280x, I expect better FPS by wide margins when my 780's come back from EVGA) is so smooth and fluidic.  The TV itself produces a super sharp image, and I feel like the color quality is excellent.  I also own a 1440p 27\" monitor by Shimian (cheap Korean monitor similar to QNIX, Catleap, etc).  4k is to 1440p what 1440p is to 1080p.  Once you play in 4k, you don't want to go back to anything less.All in all, for the price I paid ($426 on sale) I totally recommend this TV even if you only planned to use it as a PC monitor.  Blu Rays look great on it, TV looks great on it, and PC games just look epic.**Update**Since posting my initial review, I have received one of my GTX780 6GB cards from EVGA (the other was bad and had to be returned, awaiting that replacement now).  With the Nvidia card, it is indeed possible to set a custom resolution of 1920x1080 @ 120hz, whereas the AMD card couldn't seem to get it past 100hz.  Probably a driver issue, but regardless, I figured people would want to know.  Sadly, Nvidia 3D Vision does not appear to work despite the fact that the screen actually supports a true 120hz refresh rate.  3D Vision detects the set as a TV (which obviously it is) and as such, automatically sets itself to use \"3D TV Play\" instead of standard 3D Vision.  3D TV Play limits the output to 24hz per eye, and also only works with passive 3D TV's, so it doesn't work with this TV at all.  I've done some reading about how to spoof your OS into believing that your SEIKI is actually an Acer 120hz monitor, but I haven't gotten it working yet.  If I do, I'll post another update.  If this thing had a Dual Link DVI-D port, or DisplayPort instead of just HDMI I'm sure 3D Vision would work without any additional tweaking.", "Date": "April 29, 2014"}, {"Title": "Wow!", "Author": "U.N.

There is a metal plate on the bottom side of the base which should be - repeat, should be - lined up, as when you put the TV into the slot if it's not lined up exactly the holes in the metal plates won't come even with the slots for the screws. I was able to fix this by removing the metal plates with a straight edge (it's only held on with two strips of glue tape) and then putting the screws through the metal plate and into the base. By doing this, the screws call the base and the TV together - tightly - so there is no need to worry about it  eventually falling apart. It can't.When I looked at the diagram to connect your TV and your 'equipment,' my eyes momentarily rolled back into my head.But since I connect everything with HDMI cables all I have to do was plug in my Roku HD (NO cable for me!), And my Blu-ray disc player - to simple cables.After that the setup is either accomplished manually or automatically.I let it do it automatically I could make my adjustments later.Within five minutes of plugging the TV in, I was watching it.How does the picture look?I happen to be a big fan of the reimagined Battlestar Galactica, and a lot of the effects are CGI - some shots being totally CGI.I watched a scene - in beautiful 1080p - which then turned into a CGI dogfight.I have always seen people 'jump back' when they see a 3-D image, and I was thought that was not real.When I saw the sharpness of the scene I was literally taken aback. The image was THAT sharp. THAT clear.A big smile crept across my face.A friend who was over (to help, in case I needed it) was also totally amazed.I bought this TV is my 'investment' into what I believe will be the next jump in television broadcasting. I never believed in the 3-D nonsense, and for long time, I thought 4K was going to be a fad as well.I don't believe this anymore.So was a person who has taken that 'big leap' into '4K-land,' this one is a definitely wise investment.", "Date": "February 20, 2014"}, {"Title": "Volume too loud, slow when turning on and changing inputs", "Author": "Top1105", "ReviewID": "R2VUU94XK3YYUF", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I like this TV because its the only 4K one in the $500 price range.

Even then, it's not too distracting as long as you don't have a bright window behind you.  You will also need to raise the monitor up 3-6 inches off the desk to get the right viewing angle, so plan to build or buy a sturdy 8x13.5\" box to put under the base.Having a monitor this large does cause you to change your work habits.

The image quality on the Dell is really good as is the viewing angle but I use a totally silent PC, SSD drives and no fans. In the early hours of the morning when the place was deathly quiet I thought I was developing tinitus. It turned out to be the CCFL backlight inverter on the Dell. During the day when the ambient noise level was higher the monitor was inaudible, but at night it was irritating.My thoughts were to upgrade to an LED version, but I couldn't find anyone who stocked one. The choices were limited to things like the Eizo LX300w that no-one could get.During my search I accidentally stumbled across a review someone had written about the Seiki Digital SE39UY04. It was priced at $799 over there and this was for a 39\" LED TV capable of 3840 x 2160. The reviewer mentioned that the TV was recognised by his cheap graphics card and went straight into 3840 x 2160 after booting up. Wow, if only....All the stockists I found on the web would not export it.This TV was available on Amazon.com but not on Amazon.co.uk  Every now and then I'd check to see if it was available in the UK but there was no change apart from the USA's price drops, it was now only $535. I decided to be cheeky and went to Amazon.com, found it at $535 with a \"add to cart\" button - I logged in using my UK Amazon login and the \"add to cart\" button was still there so I hit it.  The price came up as about \u00a3310, \u00a352 for shipping and \u00a3133 for import duty and tax advance. The total was \u00a3495 delivered.Delivery by DHL was quick, ordered Wednesday, received the following Monday. Had I ordered Tuesday I would have had it by Friday.The TV was packed in its original factory box which has one deep gouge mark on the front. The DHL driver pointed to it and said if I wanted to inspect the TV before signing for it he'd be happy. The gouge on the box had not reached the actual screen.I left it to acclimatise for a few hours to eliminate condensation problems and used this time to read the manual and fit the stand. The TV came with a polarised 2 pin USA plug but as the label on the back of the TV said AC 100-240V 50/60Hz all I did was slap a 2-pin to 3-pin adapter which came with a battery charger from China and it did the job. Once out of warranty I'll replace this with a proper UK plug.Powering up the TV for the first time puts it into auto setup mode. It ran a full terrestrial scan then a cable scan and found nothing. I've yet to plug an antenna into it as I don't know if American Digital TV and the UK's are different, their antenna input uses an RCA female connector like a phono input.The TV cam supplied with a HDMI v1.4 cable about 2m long. I plugged this into my PC graphics card, a 1GB Radeon 7750 Ultimate. This is the fanless version of the card. The PC fired up and the BIOS screen appeared, then the usual boot-up bits and then a full desktop at 3840 x 2160.At each stage of the bootup an OSD info rectangle briefly pops up in the top right corner of the screen showing resolution and refresh rate info. The last one showed the full 3840 x 2160 @ 30 Hz meaning the card had acquired the correct settings from the TV and set itself accordingly. What was nicer was that the windows sounds came through the TV speakers over the HDMI.The sound from these small speakers doesn't have much bass but is better than most PC monitor soundbars I've come across so does me fine.Now for the picture. My TV came with no visible defects on the panel, no dark pixels and no stuck pixels, a nice surprise. The screen illumination appears to be a little uneven, brighter in the middle and dimmer towards the edges, but this appears to be due to the narrower viewing angle. I think the Dell monitor has a dispersion film at the front to scatter the light evenly in all directions. This gives an evenly illuminated screen with all the colours even across the full width.To be fair, the Seiki TV wasn't designed for viewing from less than a metre away, if you slide to one side then that side becomes as bright as the centre was before. After a few weeks I don't even notice that any more.The lack of an ultra-wide viewing angle does bring it's own advantages though, it makes text incredibly clear and pin-sharp.If the dispersion film is the reason then so be it.  The Dell 30\" had a pixel size on 0.2505mm (about 101 per inch) and I sometimes struggled with tiny text. The Seiki's pixels are about 0.223mm (about 114 per inch) and the text is sharper and easier to read.When displaying a completely white screen there is a faint irregular banding in both directions giving the appearance of a Tartan pattern, yet in normal use it's not there.At the moment the biggest annoyance may be due to the drivers. I have a habit of leaving windows open all over the screen. After a TV power down or the PC going to sleep instead of the windows remaining where they were before they all seem to pile into the top left corner on top of each other and they shrink to 1004 x 577 pixels. The desktop icons however stay where they were. If you close applications then they re-open where they were before which makes me think it may be the 3840 x 2160 windows driver.For the price I'm delighted with it, twice the pixels of my old monitor, 60% more screen area, about 40% less power and no whine at night. The power saving may be greater because I've had to set the brightness to 10 on a scale of 0 - 100, and it looks like the price has fallen again.Bruno", "Date": "December 28, 2013"}, {"Title": "Intel Graphic HD-4400 Haswell core i3, i5, i7 support 4K Ultra HD - Don't need expensive graphic card", "Author": "Minh Tran", "ReviewID": "R1BVH25JEEMFE4", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "This is a very nice monitor for someone that want a big monitor like me, I've purchased this TV mainly use as a monitor.

If you want to impress your friends all you need to do is play some 4K video on this display.The picture is so clear and lifelike it looks like you are looking through a window and can touch things.Reminded me of the first time I saw a regular hi-def tv I was blown away!When I first connected it via HDMI to my Macbook Pro I started to get a bit worried since nothing came up on the screen. Thought I might need to apply a firmware but luckily that was not the case since the Seiki website has 2 versions for this monitor and I have no idea which one I would use anyways. After a reboot it worked.I didn't think 39 inches would be that much bigger than my current 28\" monitor but it is. Not sure if I want to use it for a PC monitor yet since you have to sit at least a good 30\" away to even see the whole screen at once it's that big.After using it a while and using a white background I spotted what I thought was some specks of dust and most of them did come off but 2 remained. Upon closer examination they turned out to be dead pixels. The thing is with as many pixels as this monitor is I guess I shouldn't be surprised to get a couple though I've never had any on any of my other monitors. Guess I've been lucky till now. I can live with a couple especially since they aren't noticeable unless you know where to look and as long as they don't spread.Didn't notice any problems with mouse movement as others mentioned but then again I always set my mouse on a high speed.Actually, was surprised that my laptop's video card actually let me play some games like Batman Arkham city, Bioshock Infinite, and MetroLight game at 4K! Wasn't choppy at all or anything then again didn't use high quality or anything fancy. All I know is it looked pretty damn impressive on such a big screen!Whatever up-scaling chip it uses to upscale to 4K doesn't seem to be all that great since any existing non 4K video, even 1080p looked worse for the most part blown up to 4k then again I guess that's to be expected since it's not like vector art that doesn't lose quality no matter how big you make it. The up-scaler is amazing with pictures though. If you resize some pictures to full screen @4k you'll see at first that is appears blurry and blocky but after a second or so it becomes razor sharp, sort of reminds me of downloading pictures over a slow internet connection, comes in sort of blocky but by the end is clear after it finishes downloading. Speaking of that text is pretty sharp and easily scales up without a problem. I did force my browsers to use a minimum 16pt font since anything less gets hard to read. Seems the more the TV has to upscale, the poorer the results so the higher quality video or pictures the better it will look. Did notice the atrocious color problems others mentioned. It's not that noticeable if you are watching video or browsing the web but once you start looking at pictures you notice it. Took me at least an hour using Apple's color calibration tool and using my retina MacBook's monitor to at least some decent color. Only colors I couldn't get right is muddy looking CYMK colors. Apparently, the Macbook Pro's monitor's color is so good that it can actually show very dark brown colors as they are and not black as the Seiki does. So not sure it's a fair comparison but my older monitor is able to get a lot closer to the Macbook's colors. So if you are going to be doing color critical work this monitor will drive you nuts otherwise it'll probably be good enough for most since they won't notice the dark browns showing up as black and other CYMK colors.I also hooked it up to my PC with an old 460GTX videocard and noticed a world of difference that's probably why you are seeing so many differing opinions on how it looks here. Using the HDMI cable looked terrible and resolution can't go past 1080p. Using the VGA cable with the PC actually looked better but still limited to 1920x1080 due to videocard. Actually, if you can't stand the smaller text at 4K resolution you might like running at the lower resolution because the text is huge at 1920x1080!Finally, I noticed what some others mentioned that it will turn itself off after a couple of hours. Not sure if that's to protect the monitor from burning out since it's so bright or what, makes my old monitor look pretty dim and washed out sitting next to it. Guess bigger screen means a lot more light. All I know is that sleep is disabled and it ignores it.  That doesn't bug me as much as the light right below the center of the screen that turns red when it is off and stays blue otherwise. Haven't figured out a way to get rid of it because it is annoying right there in your face especially if you work in a dark room. I guess I'll have to use some black tape like my last monitor to cover it up too!So in conclusion for 4K video or 4K pictures, which most cameras now produce at high quality, this monitor rocks for everything else it's pretty much ahead of it's time and hit or miss depending on what you plan on using it for. Original 4K photos will also be razor sharp and impressive at 4K but just remember that the colors might be off but nothing as bad as someone else saying that they had a green that was red or some crazy switch like that. It'll be subtle like dark brown other color being black like I mentioned. Just like I thought the 30hz thing wasn't as big of a deal as everyone is making it out to be since it's not noticeable unless you are paying really close attention. The ugly up-scaling watching low resolution video's that is immediately noticeable and colors being off is more noticeable to me than any 30Hz lag.Short version:You'll love this monitor ifThis monitor is for you if you need the most screen estate you can get on a single monitor i.e. programmers, content creators others that work with lots of windows on screen at once.Will be using it as a TV and have lots of blu-ray or other high quality video that  will look great  sitting several feet away from screen.Want to use it as a showcase display like in a store playing 4K video to blow people away with the image quality.Want to use it to display 4K pictures you take with a camera to others this will also impress themAre a gamer that plays slower paced games without a lot of movement or can live without 60/120hzProbably hate it if youWork with print and know what CYMK is and color is very important to youHardcore gamer that only plays fast action games and has enough video card power to drive this thing at 60fps @ 4kAre planning on using it to watch DVD's, non HD netflix or Hulu video, basically any low resolution videoLook at lot of old pictures that don't at least have 1080 or higher resolution", "Date": "December 5, 2013"}, {"Title": "Outstanding value!

Given that they have the same 3840x2180 resolution, the 39\" has a higher DPI, thus everything is smaller and crisper than a standard 24\" 1080p monitor, while the 50\" has a DPI pretty much the same as a 24\" monitor.  Yes, both do need to have their out-of-the-box settings tweaked, but once you've done that, the image quality is actually quite nice.Since getting the 39\", my 2460x1600 30\" monitor has been feeling quite neglected.  At the same viewing distance as the 30\", the 39\" is probably the largest size I'd want for a computer monitor.  The 50\" is viable as a monitor IF you have a deep enough desk so that you can position it further away.  The 39\" can be a little finicky syncing.  The 50\" has always synced flawlessly.  The 50\" also has better viewing angles.  3840x2180 @ 30Hz is just fine for desktop work.  1920x1080 @ 120Hz is wonderful for gaming.In short, you can't beat either of them for twice the money. I'm glad to have both and am actually considering getting another 50\" for a special project.p.s., Seiki, how about an equally good, bargain priced 8K panel?

I contacted support and they suggested moving to another HDMI input. I moved from HDMI 1 to HDMI 2 and that solved the problem. Of course, I'm hoping they can fix this in an update.

It's also refreshing how fast the unit powers up since I'm used to so many \"Smart\" TVs that aren't fast at all.So 4K isn't generally available unless you have an expensive set up at home but I tested it against the following:- An HD GVTC cable input through HDMI - this display is normally horrible (it's a horrible cable service too) but the upsizing was very impressive and beat out the other 50\" HDs I have by a significant difference.- A PC with a 4x UHD graphics card: it's crisp enough that if you're used to 2 or 3 monitors, this could replace them all. Astonishing quality all around.- Roku 3: the display was better than on a previous TV though I think that's the upscaling rather than the Roku box (which I love).- YouTube: some videos play at hi-res, others don't.

I have two 23\" 120hz monitors (brand name and model not given to avoid advertising) that are situated to the left and right of this so comparison has been pretty easy for 1080p and color testing. After taking the time to calibrate colors, sharpness, and whatnot the quality of this product is great and definitely comparable to my  23\"s, unlike a \"real\" monitor the basic color settings are pretty lacking and do need tuning in my opinion.4kThe 4k on this @30hz is the real deal, things look beautiful in it and you really on notice \"lag\" comparable to 60hz (or 120/144) in high motion situations, which can include the desktop if you use a high enough DPI. 720p and 1080p video look completely different in 4k and I immediately saw the quality difference. In terms of gaming @ 30hz don't expect to play many games like this unless you're used to low frames to begin with, playing any type of fast paced game would be a mistake, first person shooters for example), racing games can be an exception but if you're used to 120hz you'll defintiely notice a huge difference even with the better quality. Aside from that FPS can prove to be a problem at 4k anyways. For really new gen games my current gen GPUs in x2 SLI/Crossfire (again avoiding ads) are lucky to average 35fps in graphically intense games (so at that point having the 60hz wouldn't even matter).1080p @ 120hzThe 1080p @ 120hz on the 39\" is the real deal, however is a mild annoyance on the convenience side. The quality is that of 1080p 120hz but the 39\" version (I've heard this is fixed in the other versions) at the latest firmware does not recognized 1080p 120hz by default. This means if you choose 1920x1080 resolution it would default to 1080i @ 60hz, which is also 16:10 and doesn't perfectly fit the borders of the screen. This is easily fixed if you have a dedicated GPU due to built in driver software to be able to set 1920x1080 progressive @ 120hz which immediately fixes the problem. In terms of gaming it remains an issue however since full screen mode immediately is recognized as basic 1080p and rescales it to 1080i @ 60hz,I just use windowed fullscreen or use my other 120hz monitors if I'm in 1080p so no issue for me (if anyone knows a solution to this a comment would be greatly appreciated). The only other quirk to this is that the desktop, while in 1080p quality recognizes 720p resolution regardless, this means virtually nothing but for example in windows 8 your start menu may move over a few rows to compensate with shortcuts. Gaming however is unaffected and UI remains how it should be in 1080p.MiscI would recommend updating your firmware before setting anything up since after a firmware update factory defaults are of course reset, so after testing dead pixels and whatnot update your firmware before calibrating color (otherwise you'll enjoy doing it twice). This can be done by downloading said firmware from their site and updating via some sort of USB storage device and using the service menu software update. Menu -> Enter 0000 -> Software Update. I never got their recommended method of unplugging and replugging in the monitor to work (sounded weird to begin with you can read their instructions for a laugh).Edit: Sad to have to do this because I still find this a great product. Rating change from 5/5 to 3/5. My first was send back within three week for a dead pixel, luckily Amazon has a great return policy. Things were going well again now six weeks later new monitor with a dead pixel and outside of the return window as well.

I had visions of very early Vizio televisions dancing through my mind until this TV showed up at my door.As with past television purchases, a logistics company called me to schedule delivery, and the delivery people practically needed to be shooed away when I said I didn't need help unboxing it or setting it up. So, don't worry about having to bring it in, the delivery service is excellent.The packaging exterior was pretty much what I expected. It looked kind of cheap, but protected everything well. Inside, the packaging was actually quite intelligent.Unpacking the TV was simple, and I was really surprised to discover that the base is a very contemporary tempered glass. Between the glass and the thin bezel, the Seiki Digital 50\" set looks quite expensive.Getting it set up was a breeze, and required little intervention with the very flimsy and cheap-looking remote that was included. Though not documented on the receiver, current-generation DirecTV remotes have a code that works, which was nice.Out of the box, I was most impressed by how little calibration was necessary to get an accurate, decent picture. 1080i sources on DirecTV looked good, though the display engine in this television doesn't compensate for compression artifacts (LG and Sony do, for example) so while intellectually, I knew the visuals were true, it made the experience slightly less enjoyable. There's a payoff, though, and that's sports. I'd go as far as saying there was no motion blur in sports content.1080p sources looked better, and as a dedicated Blu-Ray set, you couldn't go wrong. Getting 4K out of my computer was something of a chore, but I have to admit, it was worth it. While the average consumer isn't going to see much benefit from 4K for quite some time, using this as a monitor when precision detailed content is necessary can be brilliant.As for 480i/p content, it was harsh. On my DirecTV receiver, I disabled everything below 720p, and that seemed to help a bit. Going through an upscaling receiver made a positive difference, too. But, if most of your viewing is going to be below BluRay quality, you're almost certainly going to be better served (at least, in the short term) by buying a less expensive traditional HDTV.In the end, while this is a very, very nice television, it didn't displace my LG Infinia 55LW5600 55-Inch Cinema 3D 1080p 120 Hz LED-LCD HDTV with Smart TV and Four Pairs of 3D Glasses as my primary television.", "Date": "July 8, 2013"}, {"Title": "You get what you pay for", "Author": "Heinami \"Heinami\"", "ReviewID": "R1GWB2JWECR6PT", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I bought this TV and returned it within 2 weeks.

I assumed that my MacBook Pro (Retina late 2013) was unable to support it with a full 32 bit color plane.After finding a you tube review of the monitor, the reviewer gave me the secret to take it from what would have been 2 - 3 stars to a 5.  Change the monitor setting of Sharpness to 0.  Bam.  The colors are perfect and the pixels are clear.  I assume that what is happening is that the sharpness control is applying a computer algorithm to make less high res pictures sharp, but if you are feeding a 4K signal, as I am, it only makes things worse, as the data is already input as perfect.I do not play video games, so the maximum 30Hz inout rate is not an issue for me at all.

If you are just casually looking for a set to watch movies, you need to know that Seiki's 4k TVs by default perform a lot of processing to attempt to upscale 1080p content to 4k resolution while interpolating 25 frame/sec film content to about 50 frame/sec.  Some movies look vividly vibrant and lifelike, others appear as if frames drop every second.  There is a MEMC option which can be toggled to turn off processing.  Hugo & The Shining look better than bluray, Kubrick's Spartacus looks glitchy.  A noisy bluray transfer throws off the processing.Where this display really shines is as a PC monitor.  Most TVs are lousy for high res fonts but not this one.  It is not an Apple Cinema as there is some colorbleed/artifacting if you look close but 7p fonts are legible.

The internal speakers are (for instance) somewhere between clownishly and catastrophically bad. With no broadcast 4k content, there is no way to get 4k content into the display at faster than 30hz, and there may never be.  Finally, while it appears that you may be able to turn off the \"overscan\" resizing in broadcast, it is only available via the factory menu.Edit: this TV does not appear to support the QAM digital TV format used on cable systems.  It works reasonably well for Over The Air (ATSC) broadcast, but but doesn't find any of the nearly 200 QAM channels on my cable system, only the analog NTSC ones.  If you get all of your TV signals out of a cable box, this won't matter.  Mine also appears to leak a fair bit of current out the antenna port.The 30 hz limitation also makes this a poor display for gaming - not that I'd imagine many games could push this many pixels at reasonable setting.But it is pretty smooth for settings where refresh rates don't matter.  It works out of the box full resolution, 30hz on my nvidia 650 \"mac\".One caveat, mine seems to tilt forward a several degrees on the stand, which makes the viewing angles across the screen a fair bit fussier than they ought to be, short of a careful effort to prop it at better angle.And a comment: the only setting for sharpness on any TV with any digital content is '0'.Extra edit: no idea what I changed (turning off the 4 hr standby in the service menu, updating the firmware), but this does appear to do DPMS in the incarnation I received, and the state I configued it.", "Date": "December 25, 2013"}, {"Title": "OSX 10.9 Hackintosh using hd4600 and hd6850", "Author": "Claire Dawes", "ReviewID": "R1WOKP9TU5USFM", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "The computer I bought this to use with is a self-built haswell system with a i7 4770k, 24GB ram, 2x Radeon hd6850 graphics cards, Asus z87 pro motherboard.The 6 series cards seem to not natively support the 4k resolution, so my initial testing was with the on board graphics using the HDMI port built into the motherboard. This works perfectly in Windows 8, but I had issues where the best I could get in OSX was full resolution at 24hz, but reporting DVI1 instead of HDMI1 (still hooked up via HDMI). The text was horrible and the display had banding and color artifacts.I found references to this display port to HDMI 1.4 adapter: Accell B086B 003B 2 UltraAV DisplayPort Adapter and got it in today. This adapter allowed me to use my 6850 card's display port and seemed to be recognized more easily at full resolution than with the hd4600. Plus with the hd4600 I was having to use both on board and discreet graphics drivers, which seems to be a bit buggy still. I had issues where the computer would freeze when coming back from sleep and the Seiki would flicker some during those situations.I found that using the discreet cards to provide a better experience and overall feel a little less laggy. They move this from a \"maybe 30hz is too bad\" to a \"this is very usable\" situation with the slight difference. Most people would probably not notice the difference unless they had used the less capable graphics solution beforehand.The final winning factor for me was finally getting to use the Seiki in OSX 10.9 with the 6850, which features smoother window resizing and slightly smoother mouse movement than Windows 8. Plus, there is an application called smoothmouse, which seems to separate the slow refresh rate from the laggy mouse feeling. Before, the refresh rate not only looked slow, but the mouse also felt like it was lagging behind a bit. Smoothmouse seems to remove the majority of the lag. The mouse still has a \"windowing\" effect due to the slow refresh, but you feel much more in control over the location of the mouse pointer.Summary:OSX 10.9 + smooth mouse + decent video card really improve experienceIssues getting i7 hd4600 graphics working in Hackintosh setup, but fine in Windows 8Accel Displayport to HDMI 1.4 active adapter help utilize pre-7 series AMD cards that support max of 1080p over HDMI", "Date": "December 24, 2013"}, {"Title": "Everything I Expected and Then Some", "Author": "Troy Nietachmann", "ReviewID": "R2FB9KH7BCZGJJ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Comparing this to 4k displays that cost 3-10 grand is ridiculous.

Here are my observations so far:1. This TV has too much input lag at 4k. The 30hz refresh rate (and additional input lag), makes it almost unusable as the primary monitor, mostly due to the mouse cursor lag. I can live other forms of lag, but mouse movement lag is unbearable, so I use it as a secondary monitor. Setting sharpness to 0 and disabling VSync in Windows 7 Aero helps a bit, but not enough for me.2. High resolution images from a good DSLR look surreal on this TV. You have to see it to believe it! Because of the high pixel density and size, this TV creates a jaw dropping immersive experience for images viewed in full screen mode. You can't expect a wide gamut/color accurate 4K display at this price, but once properly configured, photos from my full frame Nikon look stunning on this TV. Just don't use this monitor for professional work that requires high color accuracy. I have an IPS display sitting right next to this monitor, and white the IPS display has better color rendition, it is nowhere near the day and night difference I was expecting.3. Black levels are a LOT better than I expected. Nothing like the washed out TN panels from the past.4. No (or very low) light bleeding or clouding - This was really surprising as some of LED edge lit IPS panels I have seen in the past had significant clouding issues.5. Viewing angles are great - Again, a lot better than expected. Color uniformity is great from about 2-3 ft away. Just don't sit 5 inches from this montior!6. You can run this TV at 1920x1080 60hz or 120hz(with some tweaking). The input lag issues I mentioned in point 1 are gone at this resolution, so switch to 1080p if you want to play games on this monitor.7. From short viewing distances, 1080p looks a LOT better on this TV than a native 39\" 1080p TV due to the higher pixel density.I have hooked up this TV to a DrecTV box, and I really surprised to see the quality of regular HD broadcasts on this TV compared to the 39\" Sharp Aquos that I also own. Watching full screen 1080p TV is now tolerable at 2-3ft away!8. You may NOT need a new video card to drive it. I plugged it into my old Radeon 5850's HDMI port, and it instantly worked at 4k even though the card's specs mention a max resolution of 2560x1600.9. You need to calibrate it and update the firmware to get the best results - Out of the box, the settings are horrible, especially the sharpness setting. Turn that off, update the firmware, and tweak the color settings to get the best results. Updating the firmware also adds new menu options and seems to reduce the lag at 4k.As an early adopter, I am really impressed with this TV. It is not perfect, but it does offer something that no other display can offer at this price-point. It's not the best gaming monitor, nor is it a professional grade display, but it does create a truly spectacular viewing experience that you have to see to believe.Even if it falls short in some ways, It deserves 5 stars for giving us an affordable way to experience the wonderful world of 4k.", "Date": "December 5, 2013"}, {"Title": "Great TV - Monitor", "Author": "Venom", "ReviewID": "RT3BVF6B7SFYU", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I have had this TV for almost two weeks and it is performing very well. 4K picture quality is excellent.

I immediately upgraded to the latest firmware as well as the latest drivers for my PC. I then read almost all the reviews here and I thank everyone for the amount of detail in those reviews. It made setting up the options and picture quality fast and easy. I am not much of a PC gamer, so the 4K @ 30hz  is not an issue at this time. I bought the XFX 7750 Video Card here on Amazon for $77.00, that is an incredible bang for your buck! It is not a heavy duty gaming card, but will give me what i am looking for at this time ( 4K ). I will upgrade my video card when we start seeing HDMI 2.0 Implemented in newer cards.  Using the HDMI input for 4K gives an excellent picture and for the most part works very well. I have noticed some lag during fast moving HD video, but I also think the combination of content, video card & drivers and player software could be contributing to this as well as the 30hz refresh rate. Using this TV as just that, a TV, I think that most will be very happy with the picture quality. Considering Amazon is selling it for $479.00 makes it a viable option for most people.

I do typically zoom PDFs more than I used to, as my eyesight is starting to go.* Price is so low that I decided I could afford to buy the monitor and juat be wrong about it.* 76 watts on (4K @ 30 Hz) / milliwatts when \"off\" (very low vampire current).Lows* When I bring my laptop out of sleep, I have to turn on the monitor manually.  There then ensues about 20 seconds of mode switching while the screen boots up and the laptop and screen agree on what they're doing.  Most windows get resized to the laptop screen in the process, which is definitely annoying.  My HP just pops on with no window resizing.* Out of the box display settings are unbelievably bad.  I've tweaked the settings as listed above to make it much better.  I also had to tweak ClearType settings to make text look right (I understand this has to do with a nonstandard ordering of the phosphors on the screen).  I'd like to see a how-to which describes how to get the settings right.* Skin tones in pictures don't look quite as good as my HP LP3065 (I never adjusted anything on that monitor).  There is still a tiny bit of saturation on skin highlights, which I think other people have fixed but I haven't managed to.Did I mention the resolution? I LOVE having my devblog, spreadsheet, specs, datasheets, and SolidWorks visible without tabbing through windows.  I've purchased a new desktop that should be able to drive two of these Seiki 4K displays, and the price is so low I'm thinking of buying the 50 inch and hanging it on the wall between my whiteboard and existing screen.  It would be great for presentations to coworkers.I suspect the predominant use of this screen is as a computer monitor.

This is the biggest difference between this LED monitor and a color calibrated IPS monitor. I still cannot make the color 100% match with my IPS monitor.

As others noted, terrible customer service. Spent a long time trying to get it to work on essentially the most expensive video card for business there is. Bought an Nvidia 510 card with a adapter for $400 but that card only works well for display port or DVI connections but if you need to connect to a HMDI connector through an adapter particularly the Seiki 4K unit it would not work with PNY Quadro NVS 510 Graphic Card. The software is very tricky to do a custom install as the cards not able to recognize this monitored through the adapter You got a check two boxes to try to make custom settings, but that not clear form the screen. The Seiki documentation is terrible but the interlace mode would work but the settings could not be saved Resulting in the blue screen of death. Various calls to customer support or worthless. I had a very high level software engineer I could not get to work either. Had to return but did not use Amazon because they were out of stock and not sure what I am going to face.On the other hand, the included Nvidia desktop software is really nice and I have used it for four years. The fact that the card only takes 35 W is great.In contrast,EVGA GeForce GT 630 1GB DDR3 Dual DVI, mHDM Worked right away it was only $70. The 2 GB model is probably better as it took four gigabytes of system memory using 4K monitor as well as to 1K MONITORS on the sides.The card only draws 25 W but be sure to get the Kepler model. The box says it only supports 2.5 K but the website is correct about 4K.Once it is installed its fantastic if you need a lot of monitor space.  I write very long reports and deal with 30 or 40 pages of information at time.  This and the side monitors allow me to see everything.

It's for the rest of us, whose main use of the television is to fit in a little bit of \"me\" time after the kids go to bed, or for a bit of basic gaming (xbox w/kinnect), streaming amazon content through a PS3 for family movie night, or keeping the kids happy with a daily dose of cartoons.

I simply want a tv that looks good, end of story.So... it looks good LOL honestly though the picture is beautiful, Bubble Guppies never looked so vivid <wink> (ok adult HD programming looks good too, as do our blu ray dvd's, game play for the kids games and mine (the husband chimes in \"mine too\"). The image is crisp, the colors are accurate. Yes the audio pretty much sucks but anyone who cares about audio isn't going to rely on the tv's speakers anyways, I hooked up some inexpensive computer speakers for movie nights but for day to day viewing the audio is good enough... if you care about audio hook up a quality sound system and the audio becomes a mute (pun intended) point anyways.From the very little I forced myself to look over this is one heck of  a deal for a 4K tv, heck it's a heck of a deal for a 50\" nice tv period.

I thought that I had a bad HDMI cable or my TiVo was having a bad day. Nope, all of the prior reviews about having to configure menu/picture settings (with a lot of patience and time) are spot on. Hours later I have a picture that is almost as good as the Samsung it replaced - not a good selling point. But, I am keeping in mind that it has the potential to provide a better picture - potential. I haven't seen the Seiko register 120Hz yet (on screen info), every input and program states the picture is running at 60Hz - not sure what the issue is here.I thought I left some of the packaging plastic covering the speakers - because they sound muddled and weak. Nope, that is what they sound like. Horrible. So, I bought a Yamaha sound bar (another couple of hours of setup and additional $$) and now I have decent audio.My PS3 recognizes the display as a 3D monitor - highly doubt that is accurate, but would be nice as I am told that the 4k/UltraHD standard will include this in the future.I have ordered the OPPO Blu-Ray player that up converts to 4k so that I can take advantage of the higher resolution potential - of course I expect more setup time and $$ ($500 as of this review).So in summary, this $965 television is now a $1,700ish investment - but that's my fault/choice, not really related to the product. This may help you decide wether or not to buy a 4k/UltraHD television by any manufacturer since there aren't many 4k media options - yet.

None of my current streaming devices support it and to buy another streaming device that would support it will cost hundreds of dollars.So why do i like this tv then, well for starters i got it at an unbelievable price, (didn't even spend $500 on it & i got 2 years free financing), 2nd i plan on using this today as a tv but eventually this will be a main desktop monitor for my pc rig.I already tested this as a pc monitor and as long as your not dealing with color specific content, (photo/video editing) this is a VERY cheap high resolution LARGE screen monitor.  I can put 4 x 1080p videos on 1 desktop!.In my opinion if your looking for a true 4k tv, you should be spending a little more to get a better quality set.  Yeah both tv's will have the same lines of resolution however its the engine inside the box that pushes the color/quality that are a great deal different.  If your looking for a tv, well even at the cheap price i bought this, i could have bought many different quality brand 40\" 1080p tv's (samsung, LG, Sony) that would have yielded a much higher quality picture at the more widely accepted format of 1080p.I would seriously only consider this tv if you wanted to use it as a desktop monitor & you didn't have to worry about color representation.  Dont think by me talking about color that this tv doesn't look good.  it does look \"good\" however those that are in the area of \"photography\" or truly understand \"color gamuts\" when I pair this 39\" 4k monitor against my Asus ProArt 24\" monitor, i can instantly see a difference in the color and my 24\" is on the money.  (though i did calibrate the Seiki and it helped it a little but still not as good as the Asus).  Also though i'm not a gamer, with my basic understanding in what makes a good gaming monitor, you would have to dumb down the resolution to 1080p to gain the higher frequency rates (this is not a 4k & 120Hz monitor, it goes down to 30Hz).  So if that is the case, its better to spend the money on a monitor that is built towards gamers.update; i even paired this Seiki against a cheapo 40\" tv that i bought for my sister and when it come to hooking up my Fios & Xbox 360, the quality was pretty much the same and the Cheapo tv (sold on amazon, B00AEP8TG8) is half the cost of this Seiki tv.", "Date": "December 15, 2013"}, {"Title": "3 SOLID Stars", "Author": "Tech Bum", "ReviewID": "R24JBTMT7QLT1U", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "OK, I waited long enough to write this review but a quick Amazon note; they beat the price guarantee twice for me which was nice since they said the policy was only valid once.Coming from a Dell 3008 which I've been using for the last 4-5 years, the extra 9\" was still a massive upgrade.Setup: Mac Pro 2008 with a PC grade EVGA GTX 570 running Maverick 10.9 Accell DisplayPort > HDMI adapter (cost $30)Initially the monitor plugged in and was running fine, but OS X lacked the custom resolution so it was only limited to 1080p.  Through the help forums on [H] ( hardforum.com ) I was able to use community created program called SwitchResX and saw this thing in its true UHD beauty however, the limited refresh rate of 18Hz with my system made this thing unusable.  Looking at words and pictures was a treat but any kind of movement really shown the flaws of this panel. Prior to purchasing this, I knew the limitation were the refresh rate, but I don't regret picking this up.- Great resolution for viewing document or multimedia.- Good value; bang for your buck.  I paid about $580.The desktop real estate on this thing is fantastic which is great for viewing things in its original format; especially big DSLR pictures without scaling it down.Anyhow, I like this monitor for what you get.  I'm running this with the Accell DP > HDMI adapter that Amazon sells which allows me to run it at the maximum 30hz refresh rate, but even then it is borderline usable.  If this was 60hz, it would be a perfect 5 stars, but as it is, I cannot give it a perfect score.For someone who isn't going to do critical colour work or want to game it at 3840x2160, it's going to do an admirable job.  Watching movies on this thing is very good.  The scaler makes 1080p content look good.  I don't notice any degradation from the scaler, however, when you run this thing in 1080p to play games or do reading, it is not great.

I'm using this for software development and having the extra screen real estate is seriously nice.  I don't notice that much lag at 30hz since I'm only doing text work and not playing games.  Seeing 4k come on screen is really jaw dropping and my video card had no problem immediately recognizing this tv.  Once you go 4k, it is really hard to go back to work on a smaller resolution!  It would be akin to having 1080 and then going back to work at VGA res.  I've read many complaints about this TV, but coming from a pretty terrible looking Westinghouse 37\" that cost me more than 3 times more back in the day, this display is like night and day for me.  The black levels are much better than with CCFL and the colors are better not to mention LEDS tend to last longer than ccfl's.  I'm not a photo editor or video guy so maybe the colors are not as good as Sony or Samsung TV's which are about 10 times more $$, but this is excellent for general computer work, PCB design, CAD, and of course for programming work since the IDE's take up a lot of screen and I could barely see all my windows before and had to keep moving them around so this will make me more productive and pay for itself over time!  This is an extremely good value if you consider the price/pixel vs. other 4k sets and I can't believe how picky people are these days.  We truly are spoiled!!!  THANK YOU SEIKI DIGITAL!  I will gladly buy another one of these when you have HDMI 2.0 and 60HZ out next year for my other programming work area.  Oh and thanks for the really nice quality dual dvi cable!  What a nice bonus!  It is probably the nicest, braided and flexible dual dvi cable I own now.  The remote isn't too shabby either.  Nothing wrong with it in my opinion and it came with batteries.  What's interesting is that my old Westy 37\" is actually bigger and thicker than this display even though this one is 39\" so it fits even better on my desk!  Another plus!Here's my advice f you are on the fence about waiting for 60hz and you just mostly program like me.  There's no need to wait to get 1 of these since you'll want 2 or more 4k sets later anyways!  This is worth it to get this now and besides, the HDMI 2.0 60hz model will probably be quite a bit more expensive when it does come out and take time to price drop whereas this set is in the strike zone for value right now!  The fact you can get it for between $350-$600 is amazing.On another note, I have to commend Amazon for their ship speed (like 1 day), their very competitive pricing and low price guarantee (which is no joke -- they really do stand behind their policies), and their amazing customer service!  Amazon is truly impressing me more each day and I'm sorry to say but the brick and mortar retailers just don't have a clue in comparison with both pricing and customer service.  Amazon is one stock that you continue to buy and hold forever.  Jeff Bezos is a genius and I hope to meet him someday.  I'm looking forward to the drone deliveries now and maybe I'll actually get to orbit the earth in a blue origin ship one day?  Just amazing.

The first is that as others have noted my TV needed an updated ROM to work correctly. It was a little tricky to update but worked just fine once I found accurate instructions. I'll probably buy a second of these soon now that the price is 1/2 what it was [and I've got the whole flashing of the ROM thing down].Still the Seiki wins due to input lag (the time it takes the mouse to move on the screen, after you moved it on your desk). The input lag on the TC is probably 4x as bad. So if you want a 4K TV to use as a monitor the Seiki is far superior. This is the one I would buy until another option (at a <$1000 price point) shows up.Note that as others have described well, both TVs have the annoying habit of dumping and resizing all your windows in the top left whenever the computer goes into sleep mode due to a quick stop in a lower resolution. These are TVs not monitors in terms of communication between the two. Hopefully 60Hz and a display port will show up soon. As instructed elsewhere I have two AutoHotKey scripts.

Lairby", "ReviewID": "R1GACXFHDSF6UQ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "OK, some important information before you will consider it 5 stars also. All of the controls on this SE50UY044 -- SEIKI --function in linear fashion as opposed to the correct logarithmic setup; For example, most of the volume increase occurs in the first 10 points of the 100 it has. So the difference between 0 and 1 is quite a jump-- so there's no fine control at low volumes-- it just won't happen. This linear approach effects All of the controls, which leads to uncommon results when you try to fine tune the picture; therefore, what you know about adjusting LCD screens has to be ignored and, you have to re-learn how to adjust this SEIKI, e.g., typically most manufactures controls are set up for bright rooms. At home, I don't always keep my place brightly lit, so the first thing I typically do is turn down the brightness of my displays-- on this unit that is a mistake. The brightness control starts out centered at 50; and even there, the deep charcoal blacks are already crushed to black, so turning down the brightness (using the brightness control) below 50 just makes it unwatchable in my opinion. Typically the next logical step would be to adjust the contrast. Again with 50 being center, typical contrast controls decrease the \"Contrast\" of the image equally, but not here. Turning down the contrast seems to crush mid to bright detail, making faces look unnatural, but does little to help decrease the dynamic range of deep blacks. All of this aside, it's not my biggest complaint about this SEIKI. My biggest complaint about the design of this unit; is the dynamic backlight and, the utter lack of control over it. Even when you access the factory settings, there's no way to adjust or disable the automatic dynamic backlight. The dynamic backlight is far to dynamic in my opinion. Dark scenes become very dark, and if a TV commercial puts up a all white screen behind their logo, light rays will beam from every window in your home! There is a glimmer of hope, I have learned how to access to the factory settings. In there I can lower the backlight's power and make this TV actually watchable in rooms that aren't brilliantly light! -- Here it is. -- With the unit on of course, press the menu button, once the menu is displayed, press the zero key four times. A \"Factory menu\" will pop up in the upper left corner of the screen. Using the remote, navigate to the last item of the menu titled \"Others\" and select it with the OK button on your remote. The fourth item down will be the backlight setting, you'll notice it is maxed out at 100. Highlight the Backlight option and use the left right arrows to adjust it, while watching your favorite image or video. Now remember; as I previously stated, the controls are not logarithmically based. Settings near zero change drastically and changes near 100 have little effect. So in order to effectively decrease the TV's brightness and prevent my home from becoming a landmark for local air traffic, I have to lower the number significantly-- I chose 64. The setting is automatically saved as you press a key. To exit the menu press the menu button until it all goes away. Once the backlight is lowered, now I can recover some of the crushed blacks by turning up the brightness control, I find a value of 53-56 to be the best. I also turn down the sharpness control below 25 when ever it's not greyed out. With the backlight adjusted and the brightness and contrast controls counter intuitively turned up, the image is improved. It's far from a plasma screen but at least I can see the pinstripes on a black suit now without being blinded by ridiculously bright images. Whew! I hope this makes sense. I have every reason to believe the SE39UY04 has the same controls and suffers from the same engineering mistakes. Hey, SEIKI engineers- Two things: Make your controls Logarithmic and give us some control over the dynamic backlight. --Thanks. If you are thinking about getting this SEIKI unit or it's 39 inch little brother, consider the learning curve and you'll be fine. If you are in a position like me where you can also drive your SEIKI via your souped up computer and watch HD moves scaled up to Ultra High Def (4K) levels, do it.. looks great!!  Plus, working on databases such as foobar2000 or a spreadsheet in LibreOffice is a whole new experience on this thing! Also, at the time of this writing, I cannot find a single HDMI amplifier that shows support for 4K content. So getting a stable image over a HDMI cable much more than 5 meters or 15 feet is a gamble. I know the 35 foot cable I tried was intermittent at best. To run this thing from a computer, here are a few things that may help: If you need to convert your computer's DisplayPort to HDMI, Accell's active DisplayPort to HDMI adapter is a good choice and does work at all the resolutions this SEIKI can display, with audio. I have found the minimum video cards to run smooth video are an AMD HD79xx or better or if you like NVIDIA, you'll probably need the GeForce GTX 680 or better. Either brand should have 2GB or more. Unfortunately these cards run in the $400+ range. I did test a HD7870 2GBD5 Gigahertz edition, in Linux Mint 16 and no matter the driver, playing a HD movie upscaled to 4K in Linux was 1 FPS, if the video showed at all. I honestly believe it would have faired much better in Windows and for $150 after rebate, it might be worth a try-- if anyone does try the 7870 2GBD5 Ghz Edition in Windows, please share your results. This SEIKI can be used as a monitor, it is sluggish turning on and off but it will shut off when there is no signal and turn back on when you move your mouse-- just don't expect it happen quickly-- we're talking over a half a minute on a good day. HDMI 1.4 and gaming: If you are thinking of playing fast motion games and are used to 60FPS, you are not going to like gaming on this thing. If you got a zombie on your tail, and you quickly pan around to see it, one frame it's on the left side of your screen, the next frame shows you've overshot and it's already disappearing on the right. It's a no-go for High Framerate games. This is a limitation of the technology of the HDMI ports used. Sorry. This SEIKI incorporates HDMI 1.4 protocol on it's ports, which is state-of-the-art and the best you can get even now (at the time of this writing). Right now HDMI 1.4 is a limiting factor for 4K. It can carry HD content all day long at 60 Frames Per Second (FPS) but 4K is literally double the height AND double the width of a Full HD so it requires four times the bandwidth! That's why you can only get 30 FPS through a HDMI 1.4 port. Make sense? Don't confuse the supplied frame rate with the displayed frame rate as they can be different. If you want to understand that more clearly, put these words in your favorite search engine and you'll find your answer, \"What's the difference between 60hz, 120hz, and 240hz. And, why should I care\" There are some HDMI cable manufactures that take advantage of this confusion, by putting your TV frequency on the package of the HDMI cable. That's like saying 89 octane gas is 200mph gas .. yea... OK.. in what vehicle.

Use it as a computer monitor at work- for 3 weeks now. Really love it, despite one fairly significant drawback I will mention at the end.INTIAL (BRIEF) SETBACKS-Mouse Lag: Originally a problem, but the firmware upgrade pretty much solved this. There still may be some barely-perceptible lag, but I'm not even sure.-Firmware Upgrade: I have a Retina MacBook Pro. Needed to use a different computer, a PC, to download the update onto a flashdrive since the format is FAT32. No biggy. Just trying to spare you this setback.GLORIOUS TO WORK ON-Wow Factor: Everyone who walks into my office is floored by the vibrant colors, espec when I run a 4K video off youtube. The picture is gorgeous, and this is why I am thrilled with my purchase.-One Large Monitor Is Better Than Two Small Ones: My last rig employed two 22\" monitors. I had been concerned that using one big monitor would be a pain, having to constantly resize windows and adjust font size. Turns out, it's easy peasy, espec now that I have learned a few key strokes.  And, my desk is neater and more spacious.THE DRAWBACK-Pixelation: I knew going in to the purchase that the 30 fps refresh rate was an issue, but wasn't sure how this would impact me. Turns out, when you watch video, anything with motion is a tad blurry. But I use this for MS Word, Excel, Internet browsing, and NOT for gaming; so, what's the big deal, you may ask.-I do watch occasional videos, or tennis on ESPN3, and might have some day wanted to employ this monitor elsewhere, such as, who knows, in my kitchen as a TV. This will not serve well in this function. For all its technology, it's far from future-proof. I will live with this, but it makes me wonder if I should have waited for the 2nd generation. I was told by the Seiki tech that the next gen is expected out in January, and that he did not imagine my 1st gen would be upgradable to 60 fps refresh rate.OVERALL-This thing rocks as a computer monitor. Five stars all the way. Just know that it's not quite there as a TV; yet, it is quite possible you could have it all if you wait another month or two. That said, I'm thrilled with my purchase. It's brought some color, fun, excitement into my day at the office.", "Date": "December 1, 2013"}, {"Title": "TV is a must for PC gamers or people liking big monitors!!!

I tried a Samsung which had a TERRIBLE picture and could not even be overridden to do what I had asked it to do. So I got frustrated and I posted to them asking what TV's are known to be able to receive 120hz straight out of the box. The guy who does the articles on the site replied in a timely manor the next morning I had let the comment around 2 a.m. with exactly what I wanted. He also linked his suggestions to here at amazon.com I was bummed that both the suggestions were out of my ballpark figure. Then there was a big good ol' sale that came up got this for $800.00. I literally got this TV 30 minutes ago.I do not know what people have been complaining about with the muddled blacks and off coloring. Yes it did not look good straight out of the box you will have to do some tweaking, I got this as a monitor for my PC which I game on, watch movies, TV shows, surf the web, study and do Amazon ratings :) So I also have a GPU that helps with the color issue's I suppose. But I used the TV settings only and cleared it up. This thing has been fantastic for the time it has been on. I gave it 5 stars because I do truely love this display, BUT on a down note there is very little you can adjust with the TV settings themselves VERY BASIC like CTR basic and Im not talking Sony Trinitron CTR which was the best CTR's ever made. Im talking color TV just got put on the market kinda basic. Remote looks like it was an aftermarket for $5.00. The stand is a heavy metal base which I find comforting, Samsung uses Plastic : /  If your a gamer it has a response time under 6ms which is better than 95% of the TV's out there and monitors from my own research. I didn't buy for the 4k which if I did I would be underwhelmed 30hz refresh rate?!?.......really? I got it for the pitch perfect 120 @1080p refresh rate. Which I am enjoying to the fullest extent.

The value of this display is truly tremendous.  You should be aware that you need a decent video card to drive this display properly.  And you will very likely have to do a firmware upgrade before you will be happy as the firmware that currently ships in the TV has flaws that you cannot overlook relating to overscan.I decided to purchase a GeForce GTX770 graphics card with 4M of memory to drive this display.  The graphics card is a major portion of the cost to effectively set up one of these displays.  But it is very nice to have the extra resolution to run a bunch of stuff on a single screen.  As I type this, I am watching full 1080p TV with my HDHomeRun on Windows Media center, and it only takes up a quarter of the screen.  The color quality and sharpness of the pixels is amazing at full resolution.  And if you adjust ClearType, the 1080P modes look fantastic as well.  The thing that pushed me over the edge to get this screen was when I learned that you can do 1080p120 for video games as well.  So while you do have to deal with 30Hz when surfing the web, you can do 120Hz when you play full HD games.  That also makes the graphics card update more worthwhile that you can play your video games at higher framerates at 1080p.I would do a screen grab, but there is no way to convey the difference this TV will make to your computer experience.

If you want a pure television, there just isn't much 4K content out there, and they're still working on newer HDMI standards that will allow faster refreshes of 4K video. If you're thinking of buying a 4K set because you want something that won't be outdated 5 years from now, you're probably better off anyway just paying half as much or so for a decent 1080p set and then replacing it later when all the standards have settled down.This really shines as a computer monitor, though. If you have a graphics card that was made within the last few years, there's a very good chance it can support 4K resolutions (people often don't do this with 4K sets, instead they have a single graphics card run a higher resolution across several monitors. But it gave the card makers a reason to support resolutions on this level).Once you're up at 4K, things look really fantastic and you can fit a huge amount of stuff on a single screen. This makes a BIG difference if you're spending a lot of time dealing with things like programming and spreadsheets, where you can save a lot of time by having all the information you need visible at once rather than hopping between windows or tabs to get to what you need.On my particular set, the color looks good and the lighting is very even.I personally *like* the fact that this isn't a \"Smart TV\". I prefer that my TV focus on being a very good TV so that all the money is going into making a good screen, and not toward supporting other things like Netflix. When I want to watch Netflix, I can hook up a computer, a PS3, a blue-ray player, or a (just released) Chromecast and I'll have Netflix. I like my TV better when it's kinda like a toaster. I turn it on and off and it just does the one thing it does VERY well. No fuss. If some new service comes along as the next big thing, I don't want to have to mess around with updating my television to get access to it when I could just update a computer or a gaming console or something. That's my personal view, though. I'm sure others prefer just doing things straight through their televisions.The PS3, btw, claims that this is 3D-capable. I've seem people online say that all 4K televisions are theoretically 3D-capable, because they have enough pixels to create the effect, but I haven't tested that at all because I don't have the passive 3D glasses I'd need.The 30hz refresh rate at 4K isn't that big a deal, honestly. At least to me. Refresh rate is only really an issue when things are in motion. You can put so much on the screen at once that you don't need to move things around a whole lot. I wouldn't try playing Battlefield 4 at 30hz, but something slower-paced like Civilization V would probably be fine. With games where it's bothersome, I'd just drop to a lower resolution for a little while. It's not as if a game is going to look terrible in 1080p. A lot of the stuff you already watch on the Internet, like typical Youtube videos, are already running at 30hz to save on bandwidth, so the difference isn't that significant to most people so long as you're not playing an FPS game or something.I have this in the same room with both my computer and my gaming consoles and I still have my old monitor hooked up as well. It works out really nicely. I can use this when I'm doing something that benefits from the huge and very detailed screen. If I want to mess around on the Internet while watching a movie, I just do the computer stuff on the regular monitor and just switch source on the TV over to my movie. Same thing for playing video games.For me, with this device serving as both a fantastic computer monitor and a very good television, it offers a lot of value. Using it this way, it's absolutely worth it. If you were purely going to use it as a television, though, there's a good chance that it won't have enough to offer over a regular 1080p set that it'd be worth the price premium.

I have had this for a few weeks using it as a computer monitor with mixed results.The size of this thing is incredible. I was using 2 22\" monitors at 1600x1050 (they were older) while the Seiki I run at 3840x2160. The Seiki is roughly four of my old monitors with more room to spare. Literally.I enjoy working with photoshop/illustrator and 3d modeling and rendering. Nothing is more frustrating then a computer that is too slow to process the scene or not enough screen space to work in. The latter is more the problem for me. With this I can have every single pallette open in any of my programs while still having a very large working area for either my Adobe programs or multiple views in my 3d programs.So, screen space it wins without a problem. Functionally it has far to go. It took me several days to get this thing to actually work at the resolutions and refresh rates its states. 1920x1080 @120hz is NOT achievable out of the box with a computer. You have a few tasks to do first.1. Flash the tv with the latest upgrade. Basically, download the latest software for the monitor, unzip the file and retrieve the *.img file. load the .img file onto a freshly formatted usb drive, shut off monitor, plug in usb into monitor, turn on monitor, go to menu - press 000 and go to Software Upgrade, wait for it to install this and you are good to go. Maybe. It took me 5 tries to get it to work. In the end I had to load the software for the 50\" tv/monitor for the change to take effect AND the instructions on the website are COMPLETELY worthless. I found this information on the AVSForum site along with many other bits of useful information.2. For computer monitors you may or may not be able to access 1920x1080 @120hz, or other high refresh rate resolutions, unless you download another program (custom resolution utility) to get the computer to even recognize them.As a television is might suffice for standard viewing. I wouldn't know since I haven't even tried. As a monitor it does quite well, but has its drawbacks. I love the screen space but hate the sluggish mouse movements. The effort involved to get it to work at the resolutions it states as native is ridiculous and the instructions to do so on their own site are completely wrong and worthless.If this is your idea of a perfect monitor (and I felt the same way) than wait for the hdmi 2.0 version to come out. Then you can have higher than 1920x1080 running @60hz instead of 30hz. This small difference will make a huge impact on productivity if used as a monitor.It would have gotten 3 stars if not for the completely worthless instructions on their website. Considering how much work it is to get the advertised 1920x1080 @120hz I almost gave it 1 star but I still like this monitor and that would have been unfair.

I will be purchasing another one to replace the Magnavox soon.", "Date": "January 20, 2014"}, {"Title": "Great 39\" PC Monitor at 3840 x 2160", "Author": "Rajeshk4u \"RK\"", "ReviewID": "RJ5K3CUYH150R", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I suggest you read my review, along with those of others to get a balanced view, I will avoid repeating what others have said and try to fill in details where other reviewers may have missed a few points.Overall, I am happy with the SEIKI 39\" product, both a TV and a PC monitor, there are a few unresolved issues (if using as a PC monitor).I am based in Great Britain, so it was a big risk importing from the USA (including the fact I can't buy the extra guarantee from Square Trade to cover me for 5 years). The cost of return postage, if things go wrong is a big issue.I did have to pay import duty and tax. I don't get any benefit of of the TV viewing, as the TV tuner will only work in the US (or compatible countries). In Europe, we use a different TV tuner. The SEIKI 39\" comes with an American plug, so needed a UK plug adaptor (voltage adaptor not needed). (Or you can chop off the US plug and fit a UK plug).What OS are you using?----------------------------------------This is an important question, since the Graphics card, will impact on the result.I am using Windows XP Media Centre Edition / 2GB / Dual Core / SSD.What Graphics Card are you using?---------------------------------(1) XFX Radeon R7 240 2GB Graphics card (VGA, DVI and HDMI). Works great at 3840 x 2160. Stuggled with YouTube videos(2) MSI Radeon 5450 1GB - the biggest surprise is that this card supports 3840 x 2160 even though the spec says it does not. You need to fiddle a bit in Catalyst Control Centre (select detect monitor....). This card is cheap and chearful at \u00a320! (using v13.1). Still struggle with YouTube videos.(3) MSI Radeon 260 1GB - this is monster of a card, but found it is not supported in XP. Unable to use.(4) ATI All-in-Wonder 9600 (AGP) - I connected an older computer, but on VGA. Limited to 1920 x 1080. Worked great.Why did I buy this monitor?---------------------------I wanted a PC monitor with lots of screen space. Dual monitors are restrictive. The standard HD monitor is 1920 x 1080. So it is short for useful work. Here I have a height of 2160 and it is amazing.I am not a PC gamer. I want to browse the web, Word, Excel, Web Design and I want to have multiple windows, opened side by side.How would you compare this to say the Apple Cinema Display 27\" (1440p) and Dell 28\" (4K)?-------------------------------------------------------------------------------The Apple Cinema display is sexy and nearly double the price. The Apple resolution is only  2560x1440. Plus, I am not sure if it is possible to hook up to a Windows PC. The new 28\" Dell P2815Q was a contender, but 28\" seems on the smaller side. Both the Dell and Seiki are limited to 3840 x 2160 at 30Hz.So far there is nothing from other TV monitor makers e.g. LG, Samsung, Philips, HP....How does it feel to use a 39\" monitor on Windows-------------------------------------------------------------->>>>  Experience Resolution 3840 x 2160 (HDMI)  <<<<Mind blowing!  I love the extra screen space.  It is the equivalent of 4 HD monitors.When I opened a Word Document in (Print mode), I was \"nearly\" about to see 8 full A4 pages at once (4 accross x 2 page down). You can't do that any multiple monitor set up.There is no mouse movement lag, as others have reported. The text is sharp.  I can hold a windows (as if to reposition it) and keep dragging the windows in circles without problems or issues.A big screen has some disadvantages, in that you have to move the mouse pointer longer distances accross the screen. For instance to go to the Start Menu or the MyDocument. I tend to find that I am not using the corners of the monitor, as too far to drop window (but the space is there if I want to use it). In a sense I keep everything infront of me. At 39\" it is impossible to see all of the screen all at once. I personally think a 32\" would have been better (if SEIKI have one)Some photos images, appear a bit weird (still some adjustment needed).If you are going to use the SEIKI professionally, for graphics or movie work. You need to get the adjust the colour correctly. I am not sure if this monitor is right for you, when I was looking at family photos, some of the colours seemed to be off. I might keep a spare 17\" monitor, to verify colours or to see photos.I was able to run Hauppage WinTV Tuner at the same time, in a window, without problems.The SEIKI colours are a bit 'in your face' for PC releated work. You need to reduce Backlight (special secret menu setting). See other people's suggestions.>>>> Experience Resolution 1920 x 1080 (HDMI)  <<<<<<<<<<UNHAPPY: I am having problems at this resolution. I am still unable to get good sharp pictures. The text is fuzzy. It is a setting issues, but it remains unresolved. This is probably a graphics card / driver issue / TV setting.  I was only able to connect at 60Hz, despite it been advertised as 120Hz.This is not a problem for me, but someone people have suggested they want to use this monitor for gaming by dropping down to 1920 x 1080.>>>> Experience Resolution 1920 x 1080 (VGA port)  <<<<<<UNHAPPY : This is fair and it works. Unable to understand why the display is clear on VGA at 1920 x 1080, but the same resolution of 1920 x 1080 is fuzzy when on HDMI. When connected via VGA port, I do see the slight flicker and a very minor shake left to right.Can you play 4k videos?-----------------------I have been struggling to play 4k from YouTube. The same YouTube video will play at 1080p and 1440p, but not 2160p. I did download the video (as mp4), but that did not work either either in VLC or Quicktime. I had two problems. Some 4k videos would only show a few frames and then nothing would get updated, but you can hear the soundtrack. On other videos, you see a horizontal and vertifical green lines like a grid format. I don't know if it is my new Radeon graphics card or the Catalyst drivers.I would not recommend the AMD Radeon R7 240. Try the R7 250, as it has more power (may be it works better). But my graphics card does say 4K, so not sure why not working right away.I did find Catalyst Control panel software, is not as robust as the older version of the software. It has crashed on me a few times. (thankfully no blue screens), but I am having to adjust from the Windows (Graphic Properties)Do I need a special graphics card for my PC?--------------------------------------------Yes. There are two camps. Either the AMD or nVidia graphics card with HDMI port. You need to make sure you have support for  3840 x 2160 at 30Hz.What is the sound like?-----------------------The sound is better then a Sony HD TV!. But it suffers from a lack of Bass, sound on Treble is very good.When I connected the SEIKI. No sound came from the PC speakers. This is because HDMI carries both sound and video. I then had to change a PC setting, so that the sound comes from my sound card, rather then the AMD Radeon graphic card.If I am in Europe (or elsehwhere)how can I watch TV?-----------------------------------------------------I hooked a British Sky Satellite Receiver and it worked brilliantly. Both for normal and HD programming. As a TV it is very good and even better then another Sony HD TV (except the Sony is a smart TV).  It does not have SCART, just in case you have older devices. There are composite.USB Port :-------------You can view family photos via USB. But when I tried it, the photos looked pretty awful!! Even 4k hi-resolution photos. The SEIKI is not displaying them correctly. I am not sure why.You can't use the USB to view downloaded 4k movies. Only JPEG and MP3 is supported via USB.Other points----------------It should be pointed out, this is been sold as a TV. There will be some growing pain to use as a PC monitor. The support community on Amazon, is fabulous and should help to overcome any difficulties.", "Date": "January 19, 2014"}, {"Title": "Excellent picture, perfect size", "Author": "Nei", "ReviewID": "R182UR4QBSLKU3", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I had been using a new Viewsonic 27\" 1080p IPS monitor (currently $270 on newegg) which is touted as having some of the best picture available in a monitor, and it really was great.But for my work, I have excel spreadsheets that are 50-something columns across.  I also like to look back and forth between multiple documents at once.  So I was really excited when I discovered the concept of 4k.  For the past six weeks, I have been visiting amazon on a daily basis and living vicariously through the new reviews that would pop up under these 4k monitors.  In the meantime I put together a new computer so that I would have the graphics ability to drive one of these things.  FYI the computer I built is made from the following parts:Motherboard: MSI B85M-P33 LGA 1150 MicroATX - $68Processor: Intel Core i3-4130 Haswell 3.4Ghz - $120Graphics: Gigabyte GeForce GTX 650 OC 2GB GDDR5 - $130Hard Drive: Samsung Evo 840 120 GB - $70Ram: Crucial Ballistix Sport 8GB - $60DVD drive: ASUS 24x DVD burner - $20Case: Rosewill Ultra High Gloss Finished MicroATX Computer Case with 400W PSU - $50Total cost~$500When the price on the Seiki transiently dipped to $404 a few days ago, I snagged it as well as a $30 3-year in-home squaretrade warranty.  The Seiki showed up yesterday via Fedex, and my heart sunk when I saw how beat up the box was. There was a deep puncture hole in the dead center of the box on the front where the screen was, and the box was also just generally torn apart.  I really expected to see a cracked screen.  When I opened it up, the monitor appeared no worse for the wear, though the condition of the protective stickering did make me wonder if it had been previously opened and returned.The suspense of wondering if it had survived the trip, and how it would look was killing me though, so before even attaching the base I had it propped up against the wall on the floor, and plugged into my computer.  It had survived without a single lost pixel.  When I initially plugged it in, the font on my browsers looked kind of funny and I felt disconcerted for a moment, but I restarted the computer, and OMG the quality is fantastic: The size and pixel density are absolutely perfect for placing this monitor 3 feet away from me at the back of my desk, and being able to see 3 entire webpages side by side at once with wonderfully crisp text.  There were some reviews I read which made me skeptical about how it would look, but the text looks wonderfully sharp and there really is minimal if any shading at the edges due to the angle at which I am viewing them when the monitor is 3 feet away.I spent the day yesterday playing with different virtual desktop programs, and finally landed on one called MaxTo, which works excellent to easily divide up your massive screen real estate to separate virtual screens however you see fit (cost $10 though).I also visited youtube for fun to see a few 4k demos on it, and they look just absolutely ridiculous.  It really is like going to the imax, being able to take in so much detail all at once.The only problem is that there is a just barely noticeable lag when moving my mouse across the screen, but I won't blame the monitor on this, it is likely my entry-level graphics card, and more importantly, it is definitely the sort of thing that by virtue of the way it is constantly the same just barely noticeable lag, my brain will become accustomed to interfacing smoothly with it, like operating the clutch on a manual transmission car.The bottom line, is you must buy this.  It is absolutely fantastic, and the picture quality is nothing short of amazing.

The stand is a little bit unstable, perhaps in part because I was only able to affix three of the five screws connecting it.Desktop: I run my desktop at full UHD resolution with a Geforce 660.  This setup is overall much superior to a multi-monitor setup, both because it has more pixels than even three regular FullHD monitors and a single monitor is more usable.  The size 50\" is about the maximum you can use as a desktop monitor, as most desks won't fit any larger monitor and you start having to move your head, not just your eyes, in order to see the read the text in all the corners.  The image quality is ok, but inferior to my previous monitor, a Dell U3014 (2560x1600 reference quality image).  In particular white text on dark backgrounds tends to have slight reddish shadows.  You also need a good mouse with good settings in order to hit boxes and text accurately.  However, 30 Hz is fine for this use.Gaming: Games are playable at UHD resolution at 30 Hz, but for good, competitive aiming, you probably want to run at regular HD resolution.  60 Hz is ok for that, though because of the size of the monitor this resolution does show some jaggies.  120 Hz, which the monitor supports, would be even better but I have not quite figured out how to make my video card display in that mode (though others report having done that).", "Date": "November 29, 2013"}, {"Title": "A wonderful monitor for computer work and watching TV shows.", "Author": "Amazon Customer \"certified Linux bigot\"", "ReviewID": "R1KRKW645W8HCO", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I didn't order this from Amazon, but that's only because they didn't have it on sale when it showed up for a sub-$500 price elsewhere.

The refresh rate for 4K is only 30Hz, so it may not be suitable for gamers at 4K resolution.MAJOR FLAW FOR TV USE:  You can scan for ATSC (broadcast digital) and analog (cable-only nowadays) without a hitch, but before you can for QAM (digital cable, like when cable providers retransmit broadcast channels) you have to call SEIKI to get a 5-digit code which you then enter in the TV menu.  I've been using HD TVs for 5 years, and this is the first time I've encountered such a stupid policy.One other flaw - the connectors for HDMI 1 and 2 are somewhat recessed, making it difficult to insert them if the HDMI cable is stiff (like the one which comes with the TV).  In fact, it's impossible to insert the provided cable into HDMI 2.  So be sure to buy flexible HDMI cables for those two connectors.Note for Linux users: I'm using an ATI R7 250-based card on Fedora 19, and it worked fine AFTER I'd installed the proprietary Catalyst drivers (fglrx). Before installing Catalyst I could do only 1080P with a DVI to HDMI cable (when I connected with the supplied HDMI cable, the TV simply displayed \"Not Support\").I'm VERY happy I bought this.

Overall, I would say it's pretty good quality as a computer monitor.Few other issues, the screen goes blank for a few seconds once in a while which I think is due to my computer/video card, not the monitor. The other issue is, setting it up as a monitor on the desktop. I still have not figured out how to setup my workstation with such a large screen.Here is how to setup the resolution to 4K\"In order to get the monitor to run at full resolution, I had to navigate to Nvidia control panel-->Change Resolution-->Create custom resolution.

This is much better as a monitor. After some changes to picture setting, it looks pretty good now. It is not as good as my IPS monitor, but again I can't expect that from the cheap TV.

This required a utility called CRU (Customer Resolution Utility) which enables custom resolutions and refresh rates at the driver level. Trying 120Hz refresh rate caused the display to blank out periodically.Seiki was nice enough to send me a 4k upscaling cable adapter thingy. However, I couldn't get it to work with my Xbox One or any of my other gaming devices.

Out of the box I calibrated it using the Disney World of Wonder Blu-Ray disc.  My set was surprisingly pretty well calibrated out of the box but some of the exercises truly did improve the picture.  I was a little surprised at the small number of settings that are available, but I ended up with a pretty nice looking image.The sound was another story.  The built in speakers sounded really weird.  The sound was directed to the back and was distorted and muffled.  I connected my VIZIO Sound Bar with Wireless Subwoofer to it and that solved the problem.The TV that this one replaced could connect to the internet and I used the smart TV functions pretty often.  Since this unit doesn't come with that feature, and because I wanted to see what it could do in 4K, I purchased the Sony Blu-ray Player with Wi-Fi.  The player provides 4K upscaling as well as giving the ability to watch Netflix and Hulu Plus on my TV.  The only minor disadvantage is that I have to have the Blu-ray player turned on most of the time.When used with HD content via my cable box the TV performs pretty good.  The picture is extremely sharp and clear thanks to the huge number of pixels.  Action scenes aren't as clear as they were on my Vizio TV due to a lower refresh rate, but I can live with that trade off since the screen is so sharp. However, when I use it with the Sony upscaling player that this screen really shines.  I can see detail in my Blu-ray movies better than I ever could before.  I don't know if it is true 4K but it looks great to me.  I wanted to try to view something from a true 4K source but really got confused reading some of the reviews here that made me think that I need a degree from MIT to do that.  I did purchase Angels & Demons Mastered in 4K).  Again, I am not technical enough when it comes to TVs to know if this is a true 4K experience but when I watch this on my Sony Blu-ray player it is unbelievable!  The detail was so great I felt as though I was watching a 3D movie.  You could see all of the pores, whiskers and even pimples on the actors faces.  Friends of mine come over just to see this.I am going to keep experimenting with 4K source but I love this TV (for the most part) and am happy that I was able to receive it.Note: After a month of using it the remote control stopped working for no reason (didn't drop it, replaced the batteries, etc.).

Its not curved, so using it as a monitor, the space directly in front of you is okay, but anything off to the sides is sloped \"away\" at an angle.3. Its large enough that snapping windows to left/right etc, they're still way too big; I had to resort to non-maximized windows (Every window as small as I could stand it) floating in a sea of desktop space for it to be manageable.Before you buy this monitor, experiment:a) change your refresh rate down to 30hz and keep it there for a day.b) move your monitor left or right by a full monitor length and leave it there, without re-aiming your keyboard or mouse.  Half the monitor will stay at this wierd angle at all times.c) reduce your font sizes by 10%.If you can stand this, then you would love this monitor.Picturewise, though, apart from not being a computer monitor - it works very well.

You get ghosting around text and high contrast areas.  Not a smooth picture at all.\u2022 Colors are calibrated all wrong.  Especially with cooler colored skin tones.  Take the cave troll scene in LotR.  Everyone's face doesn't look like they're lit in a blue environment, it looks broken and ugly.  I am not ever slightly exaggerating this.  The colors look like something seriously is wrong with people, as if they were spray painted in s***.  You can't adjust the tint either.\u2022 Black levels are crushed into oblivion.  If you like shows filmed in the dark, or starring black people, be prepared to see nothing but eyes and teeth. Can't be fixed without the problem below arising.\u2022 Backlight panel not evenly lit.  If you try to brighten it up, you get massive ugly horrible bands\u2022 Often won't recognize HDMI ports so you have to power off and repower on devices (with HDMI 3 only it seems)\u2022 Panel doesn't change brightness fast enough.  When transitioning from shot to shot, your brightness will slowly and ever so annoyingly adjust into view.  Meaning, the brightness will appear to be fluctuating up and down as the things on the screen move. I'm not talking about objects or sections of the screen, no, the entire panel adjusts. Must be a refresh rate thing, but it makes it extremely annoying to watch any show with varying light.Final advice.  DO NOT BUY THIS TV.  For any reason.

Not to mention there's so little content available in 4k. We'll need to wait a few years until 4K TV's drop in price, and content is actually available for the resolution in question. The most important thing to note is that 4K streaming is going to cost an arm and a leg, thanks to Internet Service Providers capping internet connections at as low as 200 Gigabytes a month. To put this into perspective, that's about one-and-a-half 4K movies. before you start getting charged anywhere from 10 to 30 dollars per 4K movie, ontop of actually having to pay the company to stream it to you.So, we'll need to wait for some physical medium to come along so the general public can actually watch and enjoy 4K.

I pulled the trigger on it saturday morning, and its here today!Sorry to hear for all those who had bad experiences with this TV.  I hope that my experience doesnt go south, and this TV lasts long enough for it to be worth the $549.99 I paid which was a STEAL IMHO, but hey, I also bought the 4Year warranty, just in case because I have never heard of this brand.If you are looking for a no frills, non smart TV with no bells and whistles that has a vivid, clean picture and a fair amount of inputs, this is your TV.If you need something with apps built in, stear clear and go bay 4K for a TV with an underwhelming embedded system that skips and shudders trying to wirlessly stream 1080P MKV's this is not your TV.If you have an HTPC, or a Enthusiast grade workstation/gaming rig with all the latest goodies, and are looking for a 4K solution that isnt ridiculously expensive like the ASUS flagship, or the unreleased APPLE version of the same SHARP IGZO LED, then this is your TV.I have 8PC's in my house, 2 are Mac's all the rest are either Linux or Windows.  Initially I wanted to plug this in to my 2011 Macbook Pro to test it.  The 2011 Mbpro doesnt have native HDMI, but if you have one you probably also spent the ridiculous amounts on all the stupid dongles so you can output to TV's, etc.  I tried using a Dynex cable i bought at fry's that adapts the Native Mini Displayport to HDMI, and plugged that into the Seiki TV.  I normally run a Apple 27inch Cinema LED from the displayport and it runs 2560x1440 with no issues.  When i plugged in the Seiki, I could tell that my mbpro detected something, but it did not display anything.  So next i tried a different HDMI cable, just to see if the SEIKI \"UltraHD\" HDMI cable they sent was faulty, but it wasnt.  Next i tried plugging this into a dell latitude e6430, which also didnt show anything on the SEIKI, but stopped outputting to the laptop monitor like it detected something, just never displayed it on the seiki.  Now my Dell is locked down by group policies from my job prohibiting me from being able to change much or customize much on it, so it could be that I needed to fool around with some display settings and it would have started working, however I cant, so I gave up on the HDMI route on my dell even though it natively has an HDMI port. When you buy this TV, it comes with free tech support form Amazon for 30 days, which I have never used when buying anything from Amazon, but in this case I actually decided I'd call them.  I called and they answered with a live person in Oregon within about 20seconds... Great experience there... I mean cmon, a live person all in less than 30 seconds?  Take notes other companies, you all are screwin the pooch big time sending us off to timbuktu, and bangalor to talk to some half wit idiot who we cant understand what we're asking about, that has no interest in any of the products you sell and is just hoping to be able to use a real toilet when they make a doodoo, and have some sophistication like that roll of white paper product that americans use, and not have to once again wipe with their ass with their left hand.  Anyway, enough about that... Just take note, HP, IBM, Dell, SONY, hell pretty much everyone, dont send us overseas, follow amazon's example and keep your support in the US with people who we can understand, who understand us and are helpful, intelligent, and friendly.  My tech support experience was great.  The gentleman i spoke with couldnt find much information on this particular TV, and had a lot of the same ideas I had already been trying, but he suggested something I didnt want to try, but had thought of, but since he was asking I went ahead and tried it.  I plugged in a VGA cable to the SEIKI unit and connected it up to my Linux box, which displayed immediately, albeit just a CLI.  Next i connected the same VGA to my Dell, and it also displayed an upscaled 1366x768 which the TV upscaled to 1920x1080i@60HZ.  So I was able to evaluate that the TV had no missing pixels like some of the reviews described, and was not damaged in any way.  Not satisfied yet, the Tech stayed on the line with me while i tried other PC's.  I took the TV with me into my living room and connected it to my shuttle xpc sh67h3 HTPC with onboard HDMI and windows 7, and it detected the TV and output also at 1920x1080i@60HZ, but this time it was clean, crisp and not upscaled from 1366x768.  After a little research, i found that my shuttle pc's mobo couldnt support any higher resolution than the 1920x1080 that it was putting out, so I stopped, content that once my caselabs case finally arrives, and I assemble my dream PC, this will be a sick monitor for it, with great pixel density and a very high resolution.

Pannabecker", "ReviewID": "R2HI79O1ET63F4", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Here is some information why people say its not a true 4K TV.  Each Definition follows a guidline but right now there is no set 4K standard - Standard Definition (SD) 720x480, Full HD 1920x1080, Quad HD 3840x2160,4K 4096x2160. Now this TV is only in the Quad HD range. For this price you are not goping to find another TV like it but there are some issues that should be noted. Bottom Line This TV is way ahead of its time and for a price you cant beat. True 4K is a little bit higher in pixels.Pros-Listen up people, If you watch a lot of 3D movies and TV,  anything Quad HD and 4K will change the way you view 3D items. The reason being 3D give you only part of the picture in each eye. Yes Your eyes are seeing different parts of the picture. In reality when you are watching a #D movie you are not getting it in FULL HD pixels get blocked out and not all the information gets processed , so your getting the resolution almost cut in half, so quad and 4k TV are going to give you more resoulution for 3d pictures no matter the size.Cons-At screens that are not above 80inches your eyes will not be able to comprehend the the full quad or 4k tech. Heck you would have to have close to a 150 inch screen to really notice the picture difference. This is because the of the amount of pixels cramed into one area. After a certian resolution and depending on the distance you sit from you TV. Its not possible for the average user to notice much of a difference. the bigger you go, the more expensive it gets, but the more awesome the picture gets.Here is some geeky information that helps explain it.Most people sit about 10 feet from their television. At 10 feet (120 inches), your eye can resolve an object 0.035 inch wide, if like I said above, there's enough difference between it and the background (or its adjacent pixel, in this case). The memories of the Westwood school system that told me I was bad at math compels me to show my work, so feel free to check my math:2 x pi x 120\": 753.98\" (circumference of a circle, with you at the center)753.98 / 360: 2.0944\" (360 degrees in a circle)2.0944 / 60: 0.0349\" (60 minutes in a degree)This math, or just looking at your TV, tells you that you can't see individual pixels. What's interesting is that a 720p, 50-inch TV has pixels roughly 0.034 inch wide. As in, at a distance of 10 feet, even 720p TVs have pixels too small for your eye to see.That's right, at 10 feet, your eye can't resolve the difference between otherwise identical 1080p and 720p televisions. Extrapolating this out, you'd have to get a TV at least 77 inches diagonal before you'd start having a pixel visibility problem with 1080p.Or, you can move closer. Beyond being a math exercise, let's be realistic. No one's going to sit 6 feet from a big TV. I'd doubt 7 feet, either. So if we say 8 feet (96 inches), or 0.028 inch on the resolution side, this means you'd need a TV that's bigger than 60 inches to really benefit from 1080p.Geoffrey Morrison from CNETThank you for listening and I hope this helps people ...

I like that it is light weight, and the size is perfect for a desktop monitor but also makes a great TV you can view from across a small room.
