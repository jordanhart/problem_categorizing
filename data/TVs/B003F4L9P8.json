I had some reservations at first, since I had never heard of this brand.  But I decided to take a chance.  I'm glad that I did.  I am completely pleased with this television.  The picture and color are excellent.  Sound is good, and the unit is full-featured.  I would buy this TV again, and I recommend it to anyone.", "Date": "May 26, 2010"}, {"Title": "Better than higher priced televisions", "Author": "Raimundo Rodriguez", "ReviewID": "R28BGZ9ZH76J1K", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I bought this tv for my 10 year old daughter months ago. Since it was on sale and it was so cheap even though the brand was unknown to me, I bought it since my kid will not be that demanding. I also bought the same day a 40 inches Westinghouse LED TV for myself. Guess what? This cheaper tv has a better image and performs better than my more expensive brand name tv. In fact it has a sharper image and clarity than my 55 inches Samsung plasma!For my other daughter I am definitely buying again this same tv.", "Date": "December 21, 2012"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "Unavailable", "Features": null, "Name": "Element 26\" 720p LCD HDTV Refurbished", "ImgURL": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/31VWBl7dlVL.jpg", "ProductID": "B003F4L9P8"}}
