Overall, it is a nice set for the price paid (3.5 out of 5 stars).  As most people know by now, you MUST have HD reception to get HD quality!  This set has acceptable performance with standard cable with analog hook up.  These new sets are just not equipped to handle the lower resolution feeds of standard cable.  They perform much better with digital or HD feeds, which is where they excel!  On HD, the Memorex performs just okay, considering its price point.  You shouldn't expect Sony LCD quality from a budget LCD.  I use this set mostly as a second computer monitor and gaming monitor for my son's Xbox 360.  My set did come with a registration card (for the warranty) written in English. No dead pixels on mine, either.  Incidentally, this set is a dead ringer for the Viewsonic line of LCD's.Overall, I would recommend the Memorex as a good guest room, office, or play room set.  The fit and finish is impeccable.

The picture quality is great, good dark blacks and bright whites for a LCD and the 32\" size is perfect for my needs.The main feature that drew me to this TV aside from the price and picture was the connectivity.  I have it connected to my computer via the VGA port (for now, I will be getting a DVI-HDMI cable in the near future), my DVD player via component, VCR via composite, and an oldschool NES via composite and there are still connections open (as well as the antenna in, I don't have cable).  The icing on the cake is the clip on the back to hold the massive bundle of cables in the center of the tv so they can effectively hide behind the stand, keeps my setup looking neat!The main drawback is a lack of software features (menu options), especially the lack of a signal strength meter for broadcast reception and the ability to add digital channels without scanning (analog channels can be added manually but I have not figured out a way to add digital channels without rescanning).  These features would, of course, be a moot point for cable users and are only a mild irritation for me since I watch most of my tv through the computer.Another mild annoyance is the inability to set the channel info display to a particular mode after power off.  You can set it to display the current program info for each channel you switch to but as soon as you power off the unit the setting reverts back to the default, showing the station call letters and channel.The physical design of the product is fine with me, though some may not like it.  I like the glossy black boarder and I really like the matte screen as opposed to glossy, cuts down greatly on glare!  The boarders may be thicker than some like.  The unit has a fairly thin profile, and I love the cable organization as I mentioned earlier.I got this TV for just under $400 as an upgrade from a 27\" CRT tv with a bad transformer (my first flat screen tv!), but the price seems to have gone up since then.  I'm not sure if it is still as good at this price since I don't have my product research on hand anymore.  But I hope this review helps you decide.

I think it has a decent picture, can produce fairly good sound through an external audio system, but has marginal quality sound through the built-in speakers. Like many items on the market there it has some good features while lacking in other features.  Memorex is now a division of Imation Enterprises Corporation, and it appears the set could be manufactured by an outside firm, and branded as Memorex. My set was assembled in Mexico. I have seen look-alikes that have a different brand.Digital TV suffers from a different set of problems than does the analog broadcast signals.  Whereas with a weak signal the analog signal would produce a picture with \"snow\", and often sound, the digital picture does not, but rather either drops a group of pixels leaving a checkerboard  pattern on the screen, or gives no picture at all, leaving a \"no signal\" message.  Digital also allows \"multicasting\", that is it can broadcast up to four programs at once, which produces in effect, four channels rather than one.  Each of these four channels can also carry extra information, such as a program guide.The Good:(1) The picture Quality is quite acceptable as long as the signal strength is reasonable.  I am in a metropolitan area (San Diego) and am using my rabbit ears to receive 8 digital channels as well as 8 analog channels before the February cutoff.(2) Both analog and digital signals can interchangeably be viewed without altering TV setup.(3) The TV may be controlled (including setup menu items) from either the TV set or the remote.(4) It can select nine modes of input: TV signal, side input RCA jacks, rear input RCA jacks, S-Video, two component video input sets, two HDMI inputs, and a VGA input. These are clearly shown in the User Guide.(5) It has a pretty good on-screen program guide, seeing several days programming in the future, of course this is depending on what the station provides.  Not all tuners do equally as well.(6) A user guide is downloadable from the web. [...]  I always like to have an electronic copy.  The copy that came with the set appears to be a later revision than downloaded as it contains additional instructions not found in the downloaded version.The Bad:(1) The set has no video outputs, except the screen.  This means, for instance, you can not record a TV program with your VCR without an external tuner.  For a VCR, this might be remedied for digital channels by connecting the AV outputs of a digital to analog converter box for older TVs to the recorder.  Be sure to understand a converter's operational features before acquiring it, as this may not solve the issue for analog channels.(2) Sound from the built in speakers is marginally low quality; somewhat better than what one would get off of a 1940's radio.  There is very little base and treble through the built in speakers.  It is OK for a news broadcast, but expect to route through a good audio system for any music.  Audio outputs are in Dolby digital stereo, which are reasonably good quality, but lower volume.  I had to fiddle with the TV's external \"Audio Out\" volume setting in the setup menus, locking it at maximum, to almost match the volume from the FM radio signal of my audio system.(3) Digital channel sound and picture do not perfectly synchronize.  I believe the sound lags the picture by a fraction of a second on digital stations only.  I am not sure if this is an attribute of this set, or if it is a generalized digital TV issue.  It is quite apparent on news broadcasts.  I did notice that what you see/hear on digital reception lags what was received for the same material on the station's analog channel by a second or two.(4) The cursor on the setup menu is light in color and difficult to see if you do not know what you are looking for.  For selecting between different menus, it does not show at all.  Once you understand how it works, with good vision, navigation is possible.(5) Memorex has a website which you can register the product.  I did do that and asked for an English copy of the warranty (Only Spanish is supplied) as comments when completing the registration.  I received back an email saying that my store receipt is my 1 year warranty.  When I wrote back I would like them to send a copy of the warranty that includes the terms and conditions of the warranty (which is not in the owner's manual or other supplied documentation as English language), they replied they would look for such, gave me a case number, and contact phone number.  That was about six weeks ago, and they have not replied further.  Because I read that others have had this set go bad, I also bought an extended warranty for an additional sum which extends my protection to 3 years.  With questionable factory support, that may be my salvation.The Ugly:(1) To get the digital channels TVs must perform a scan.  This allows the TV to divide a single channel into the four sub channels. (This being one of FCC's reason to switch to DTV.)  If the station signal is weak, either because it is at a distance, or the antenna is improperly aimed, a TV scan will miss registering the channel as available.  If station transmitters are in different perimeter directions, then if the antenna is optimized for one station, the signal for a different station degrades, and can be missed by the scan.  It is not unusual to scan more than once to acquire all of the available channels. This TV has only a \"setup\" scan, which erases all previous scan data; it does not have an \"add channel\" scan option which would allow keeping the channel data found on a previous scan. Hence you have difficulty setting up the set for all available channels.  To get channels in all directions at the same time, my solution to this was to use multiple antennas oriented to different directions, and combining the signal by connecting backwards through a splitter, using it as a \"combiner\".  That is rather then connecting two or more TVs to one antenna; I connected two antennas to one TV, although there are splitters that have single to more than two connections. Rather than a RF switch, I used a booster/splitter to then split the signal back so I could record off the air with my VCR through a converter box.(2) This set has no signal strength/quality meter display in the setup screens to guide the orientation of an antenna.  Because the TV has a noticeable digital processing lag between signal reception and display, you have to sl-o-o-o-ly rotate the antenna until the picture does not have drop outs, but you can not be sure this is at the best orientation.(3) There are \"Smart Antennas\" on the market which deal with antenna orientation.  These require an additional connection looking like a telephone jack.  This set does not have this feature.", "Date": "February 19, 2009"}, {"Title": "Has its drawbacks", "Author": "William \"William\"", "ReviewID": "R2R611CJVJBV0L", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "The major drawback seems to be with the HDMI. We have had this TV for about two years now, and the HDMI will only display at 4x3, unless you take the source down to 480p anamorphic.

As its HDMI, the tv will not let you switch the picture mode.However, connecting components up via Component Video takes care of the aspect ratio problem. The issue is clearly in the TV, but sadly, the television does not come with a communications port to upgrade firmware.The number two issue is picture quality. It leaves a lot to be desired. Its dark, no matter how you set the settings, and the color doesn't look quite right. Nothing seems to be able to get it to look right.The sound quality is pretty decent for an LCD television.

I am using it as a bedroom TV with Dish Network. No problems with setup and the menu is pretty intuitive with extensive control selections. I have noted several reviewers have had problems coding their remote controls. My Dish Remote seems to work fine with the code 902. The supplied Remote is above average in features and the controls are laid out in a logical manner. There are dedicated buttons for the most used features so you don't have to go to the menu for things like the sleep timer, Closed Caption or aspect ratio. I tried it with rabbit ears antenna and was pleasantly surprised by the quality of the reception and the number of channels I could receive. I live about 30 miles north of Houston and the scan picked up 35 channels. About 25 channels were solid watchable signals.
