{"Reviews": [{"Title": "A good TV for the money - UPDATE", "Author": "E. Hibbard", "ReviewID": "R1FRSRBW548ANT", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I purchased this TV for $399 on a lightning deal and thought that I was buying at a great price. A week and half later the regular price dropped to $369 and thanks to Amazon's TV price guarantee I received a credit for the difference.  That makes this TV an AWESOME deal.The TV is easy to set up, simply tighten 3 screws to the stand. When I turned it on, the first thing I noticed was that the screen is very bright and because it is LED backlit, the white is a very cool blue. I toyed with the settings a bit, and set the warmth to cool and the mode to movie. A previous reviewer's comments about the color settings are dead on, and the combination I am using creates the most natural color settings.When I initially connected the TV, I was not overly enthused by the picture quality, there were artifacts and quite a bit of pixelation. Also, after I had turned the TV off for a while and then turned it back on, I would have sound and no picture except for vertical lines. The display said the picture was broadcasting at 0p. I was worried that this might have been a bad purchase, and that I would have to return the TV.I run a TIVO and ROKU box through my Sony home theater system. My problem with the vertical lines stemmed from the settings on my receiver. After I reset the receiver, shutting off the standby and and HDMI pass-thru I have had no further issues with vertical lines and a 0p signal.My ROKU looked awesome from the get go, and I had no issues with pixelation or artifacts, so I reasoned that my issues with picture had something to do with my cable/TIVO. I corrected the issues by manually adjusting the broadcast settings on my TIVO, so that it would transmit at 480p through 1080p. This eliminated 99% of my issues with the picture. I don't watch sports so the 60Hz refresh rate is adequate for my needs.I can't comment on sound, since I use a home theater system, but I will say that, since I properly tuned the settings, I really like the picture on this TV and I am glad that I made the purchase and that I don't have to return it.***UPDATE*** 12/14/12I AM EXCHANGING THIS TV BECAUSE OF THE APPEARANCE OF BLUE HORIZONTAL LINES ACROSS THE SCREEN. I SHOULD RECEIVE A REPLACEMENT ON TUESDAY.  I AM CROSSING MY FINGERS THAT THIS IS SIMPLY A DEFECTIVE UNIT. I WOULD RECOMMEND PURCHASING SERVICE CONTRACT IF YOU PURCHASE THIS TELEVISION.", "Date": "December 11, 2012"}, {"Title": "Great TV for the price", "Author": "Bob", "ReviewID": "R25AWWE2M1ZBJE", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I bought this TV on Wednesday and had it by Friday with the free super saver shipping. Amazing. I am not a tv/ tech freak like most people who buy TVs. I was looking for a bargain and I think this TV is worth what I paid. It exceeds expectations for a $350 hdtv set.Picture Quality:The picture quality is great, very sharp and very bright. Great colors and sharpness. I was really worried about getting a 60hz tv because I watch a lot of sports and will play xbox on occasion. I have not hooked up the xbox yet, but I watched some basketball and football on this set and it looks great. I have it next to a 120hz set and honestly, I cant really tell a difference. It is not choppy and it is not blurry while watching sports. There may be a slight difference but you really have to concentrate to look for it.If you are a casual/ average viewer, you will be pleased. If you want to compare this to 600-700 tv, I'm sure it isnt as good, but is that what you are expecting? The quality is more than fine and you will be satisfied for the price you pay.Notes:As others have said, this tv has 2 HDMI ports, not 3. The remote is pretty cheap and the reference manual is a joke. The stand is good quality and the tv itself, picture aside, looks really nice. The bezel is small and it has a brushed texture finish. It doesn't look cheap and if it didn't have the name \"haier\" on it, you would probably think it cost a lot more than it does. I read reviews about the speakers and how much they suck. At first when I was testing it out, I thought the speakers really did kinda suck. It has a plug for hooking up your own set of speakers so I quickly remedied that.With all this being said, I have owned the tv for a couple days and have tried to test it out with movies, sports, and general tv. Overall it is good and I give it a thumbs up.I should also note that it did not have any dead pixels. If I run into any issues, I will update this review.", "Date": "December 16, 2012"}, {"Title": "Buy store brand cereal? Then this TV is for you", "Author": "UPS man", "ReviewID": "R7GKSNG2NU91N", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "We have a LG 3d 55 downstairs we bought last year for the living room for over a grand, this TV is not it. That being said, it is a great value for what it is, a basic non smart 1080p LED slim TV (with 2, not 3 HDMI ports). If you're looking for Samsung/Sony/LG quality picture or stream anything using just this TV, we'll you're out of luck. I'd suggest buying a set a 2.1 computer speakers for around 30 bucks to make this thing the perfect buy. The kids have yet to complain the ICarly looks like crap or come wondering downstairs crying because they can't stream Season 1 of Buffy the Vampire Slayer.This TV is for someone on a budget, looking to put this in an additional room, or someone who doesn't care if it's name brand or not, they just want something that's big and works. Pair this with a cheap bluray player with some apps (amazon streaming,NetFlix, ect) 2.1 computer speakers, and a wall mount to make this perform bestGet close to the name brand quality out of this off brand name, the value for what you get is well worth it.UPDATE- Added photos to help show some of the features and size.", "Date": "December 21, 2012"}, {"Title": "Good value for a lower end HDTV but has issues", "Author": "E. Williams", "ReviewID": "R2MUGEMQR6LL0V", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "UPDATE: Whether damaged in shipping or defective when the screen is white one can see vertical shadows on the screen. This doesn't bother me but might bother others. Other buyers had mentioned weird noises coming from the TV speakers and I can confirm this. Here's to hoping it is resolved with a firmware update. Also, connecting to the digital out for the TV tuner audio has sped up the channel changing significantly, not sure why but I'm not complaining either! Was worth the $330 but any higher price I'd be wary. Make sure to purchase with a credit card that offers buyer protection or extended warranty to cover your butt.Do NOT expect this model to do deep rich black tones, otherwise colors are good and picture is bright and clear.PROS:Slender thin design is nice, front bezel looks good and was thinner than I was expecting. Paid $335 in late Dec 2012 when the price dipped low for a few hours on this model. Bright clean picture and a nice non-glossy screen to keep glare down. Easy assembly with 4 (included) screws and a (not included) common phillips screwdriver. Was surprised to find a decent quality remote with batteries included. TV is light enough that a single person can unbox and setup without help. Unencrypted QAM signals from my cable provider come in looking super at full 1080 resolution. VGA input looks amazingly good even though my PC has old cheap onboard video. No dead pixels or other weirdness anywhere on this set even though the box shows that Fed-Ex was less than gentle with it during shipping.CONS:Slight LED light bleed on right hand side which matches with damage to the box. Seems like more than a coincidence to me so I'm going to blame Fed-Ex for that one. Not bad enough for me to bother with returning it. The slight LED light bleed is really not noticeable unless the entire right side of screen is completely black.This model does an \"OK\" job with the color black and can be made \"good\" with time and tweaking of the color settings via the menu.This model takes almost a full second to change channels when using the built-in HDTV tuner. As with most low end digital HDTVs it took 10+ minutes to scan my cable TV connection for available digital and analog channels, thank goodness that is a one time routine! For the price point I am not at all bothered with these minor cons.OTHER:There is a menu option for loading new firmware, presumably via a file on a USB thumb drive connected to the set. Model is so new it is not listed on manufacturers website but at least they included the possibility to add new and improved firmware later on. Maybe they will release a new firmware later to help with the time it takes to switch channels?If you plan to route the full HD digital audio from the TV's built in HDTV tuner you'll need a digital coaxial input on your receiver. For older 2 channel audio systems one could use the headphone jack output on the HDTV with an inexpensive cable that has a headphone jack on one end and RCA left and right outputs on the other end.Have not tested the 2 HDMI ports yet. The VGA port, component input and built in HDTV tuner work like a charm though.CONCLUSION:It's like a big bright inexpensive PC monitor but with an HD tuner, woohoo! The picture quality would make you think it cost more than it does. Perfect for low budget home theater or kids room etc.", "Date": "December 18, 2012"}, {"Title": "Anoying Noise", "Author": "Chin Ho Chae \"5155\"", "ReviewID": "R8IBOUUE125LF", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "As soon as turn the TV on, Some weird noise came out and it's really anoying while u watching tv.I don't know it was defective or basic of this tv, but had to return.Quility of screen was fine for the good price.", "Date": "December 18, 2012"}, {"Title": "Ok Image Quality, noticeable electronic noise from back panel", "Author": "Robin", "ReviewID": "R2PHLWG6SGKE45", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "I just received this Haier TV this Friday, and decide to ask for a replacement by Monday morning.Here is the thing, I think the image quality is just fine, but there is loud electronic noise coming from the back of the panel, I have to turn the volume up to 40 to cover this noise, which is ridiculous since I normally watch TV at volume of 20.I hope the replacement one won't be like this, otherwise I will return it and never touch any Haier product.Besides this, it has a cheap remote control and weird blue screen when you switch channels, I'd wish they change it to black screen.Update:The second one arrived on Wed, and the noise is still there, although at lower volume, right now I will keep it as long as the noise stays at that level.", "Date": "December 16, 2012"}, {"Title": "You must read this before purchasing a Haier product.", "Author": "Mike Yasumatsu", "ReviewID": "RIOGQZFYTUOQQ", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "The following information is based on facts related to my experience with a 42\" Haier TV.FEB 2012:  Original purchaseJUL 2012:  Started showing sign of defectSEP 2012:  Called Haier for warranty repairOCT 2012:  Third party contractor could not fix problemNOV 2012:  No contact from anyone, so I called Haier, who told me to send back the unit.DEC 2012:  Received replacement unitMAR 2013:  Replacement unit main board malfunctionMAR 2013:  At first, customer service would not warrant the product because it was 1 month past the 1 year purchase date of the ORIGINAL set (which has nothing to do with the defective replacement set).  After requesting to speak to a supervisor, they said \"... this is the last time they will honor the warranty\".  So, in essence, I have had a functional Haier TV for approximately 9 months (the total for both TV's) and they will no longer honor their warranty.Keep in mind that a Kathy in customer service told me in DEC 2012 that the warranty would be good on the replacement set for 1 year of the original call in SEP 2012, which makes no sense at all.  So she lied.  Whatever the case, the warranty should initiate when the unit is received by the customer.  I have no expectations of this unit lasting more than a year.Since Haier does not stand by their products, there is not a chance in the world I would ever entertain the thought of purchasing anything Haier-related.In closing, I did not receive a single follow up call to make sure all was well, an apology for 2 bad units in a row, nor the poor handling of this matter.  (nor will I expect one).RECOMMENDATION:Stick to the major name brands (Japanese or Korean).YOU GET WHAT YOU PAY FOR!!!Pay the extra $$$.

This TV has great picture. Sound is OK.  It has exceeded my expectation for the price.  Highly recommend.", "Date": "December 22, 2012"}, {"Title": "Worth the price if you absolutely don't want a plasma TV", "Author": "Strategos \"The Guardian of Time\"", "ReviewID": "R3LDEOUPCJL5YL", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "The first HD TV I have ever owned is a lovely Panasonic 42 inch plasma TV that's 720p max resolution. Given that this TV is a bit newer, four inches bigger, and 1080p instead of 720p, you might think it would blow away that old plasma in every way. You'd be mistaken (for the most part).TV Reviewers have said again and again, resolution is not as important as contrast, black levels, color, and clarity. You simply won't get the same picture quality out of a cheap LCD as you will out of a cheap plasma. That said, there ARE arguments to be made each way. Just remember that if you are a super snob of ultimate HD picture quality you aren't going to be satisfied with anything less than a super-expensive LCD TV...or a cheap plasma.The positiveThe big positives that this set has going for it over my old one is big size, VGA input, built-in headphone jack, brightness, lack of glare in bright sunlight, and simplicity (and the fact that it's EXTREMELY thin). The price for the size of this TV seems downright ridiculous when you consider what big-screen TVs used to cost. The fact that you can plug a PC or other VGA input in is a great feature for people like me who need it. The built-in headphone jack allows me to watch movies and play video games late at night without waking up the rest of the family (and lets you bypass the awful speakers). The overall brightness of this TV is so high that I have to keep it at the Energy Saving Setting at all times to keep from getting eye strain and headaches. After getting used to the super shiny glass of plasma TVs and the horrible day-time glare that they cause, it's very nice to be able to watch TV or movies in the daytime with the windows wide open (the sun doesn't shine often where I live, but if it does where you live take note).The negativeThe negatives on this TV compared to my old plasma are...just about anything related to picture and sound. Unlike my plasma that has amazing up-scaling, gorgeous color, and fantastic contrast and black levels, this set looks very washed-out and pixelated even when watching high definition sources if you are watching film scenes with low light levels or low quality transfers (blu-rays don't look good unless you are watching pure CGI animation or a VERY high quality blu-ray like Avatar). When watching movies with the lights turned off at night the back-light has very distracting light leakage, and very dark scenes look downright terrible (especially bad if there are black bars on top and bottom). DVDs on the whole look rather \"fuzzy\". There is a box pattern that can be seen all over the screen when there is a very bright color (solid blue especially), which may or may not drive you crazy when you see it.There were reviews of my last TV that said it had lousy speakers, but this TV takes lousy TV speakers to a whole new low. Even after giving it a week to break in, the bass response is abysmal, the overall sound very flat and tinny (on the flip side, the surround sound effect actually helps in my opinion).If you are looking for advanced features in the TV's menu that allow you to adjust the picture, you certainly won't find them here. You have the picture presets, choice of warm (everyone looks red), cool (everything looks normal), or normal (everything looks green) color temperature, and that's it. You can select video inputs, but not label them. Bare bones. But if you like your TV nice and uncomplicated, that might not be such a bad thing...The realityFor inputs this TV has ONE set of RCA jack inputs (you better buy a switch box), and TWO HDMI inputs (not three). Keep this in mind if you purchase. And make sure that you either make good use of that headphone jack, or run some external speakers.Normal television looks great on this TV. The use of a lot of bright colors and sunlight found on news broadcasts, commercials, reality TV, and most TV shows play to it's strengths. Likewise video games look very nice indeed if you are running off a high-def source and maybe even if you're not (because for some reason 480i content doesn't come out nearly as blurry as it does on a plasma). The only downside to video games is that if you're running off a high-def source any flaws will be very noticeable (aliasing etc). DVDs don't look very good on this DVD even on the best of players (fuzzy and pixelated)...except for animation, which looks absolutely stunning to the fact that it's mostly bright solid colors and very little film grain or dark scenes (anime that's widescreen looks particularly good).If you do all your watching in daylight and have a direct viewing angle, and especially if all you ever watch is TV and video games, this may be the set for you if you want things dead simple (and don't mind the mentioned picture flaws). Likewise if all you want is a big, bright, cheap LCD this is the TV for you.If on the other hand like me you love to watch a lot of blu-rays and high quality DVDs late at night with the lights turned off (and are at all picky about sound and picture quality) you are probably going to want to pass on this TV and save up for a plasma.", "Date": "November 4, 2012"}, {"Title": "Disgusting", "Author": "DJ", "ReviewID": "R3QT4F1BD11CHA", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I went through two of these TVs at a $330 price point.

I have the color temp on normal, contrast 0, brightness 45, sharpness 0. At first I feel just a tint of green once awhile, then I set color to 45, and it's perfect.

My recommendation? DO NOT buy anything from Haier. The customer service will just ruin the deal no matter how great the deal is.

We watched a netflix movie on it.Strong flashlighting from the sides during dark images, while watched in a darkened room, and weak internal speakers, are the standout problems.

However, it is NOT worth a penny I paid for it.  First, I'd like to review the product itself.  The TV is very thin and light, as most LED tv's are nowadays, that's the only pro.  The con's: there will be backlight \"bleeding\" throughout the edges of the display, you can see it on scenes that aren't even very dark. They are very pronounced on the corners.  The tv set, for whatever reason, has a horrible time displaying red's.  when there is a lot of red, such as a scene with an actress in a red dress, there's almost no shading or definition.now my personal issues with my set. i received a set that had a line of dead/bad pixels that is about 7 inches or so long.  also, they sent me a bad remote control that is not sending out an IR signal.  I called customer service several times, they use US and off-shore support (i can discern a foreign accent when i hear one, i am of Asian decent).  When you get an American it's great, when you get off-shore support, they will look over the notes, put you on hold b/c they have to contact someone else, and then get back to you, but they can't really do much beside enter notes to your account and give you an update here or there.  if you have an issue with your set, customer service requires 5 or 6 pictures of the set. Some are stupid, why do i have to send in a picture of the front and back that displays the Haier logo? do many people try to trick you and send you issues of another manufacturer's product? i doubt it considering your CS.  After reviewing my pictures, they sent out a tech to verify. the Tech told me what i thought, the set needed to be replaced.  Tech said they will let Haier America know and for me to follow up w/ Haier.  A few days later, i call Haier and they said they're waiting on the Tech.  I told them everything was submitted to them and a recommendation for replacement was put in, this is where the off-shore support has no idea of what's going on.  After an escalation, i get a manager on the phone and he says he will send out a replacement and for me to fill out a form.  I fill out a form for a replacement and have to send in the actual label off my tv.  well they're not very clear which label they wanted because one person said to send in the label with the serial number. that is incorrect, you must send in the actual label with Haier's name on it, so it just displays the model number.  after a week or so, i get a call that i will receive my unit within two weeks. well, that's not true, it MAY ship in two weeks.  it has now been over two weeks and including back and forth mailing of documents, Tech roll out and everything, it's been over a 7 weeks. THIS IS HORRIBLE CUSTOMER SERVICE!!! RUN AWAY.

I've been using this TV for two weeks for HD1080 XBOX gaming (Halo 4, COD etc), netflix, DVD's, and it's awesome.I'm upgrading from an off brand 30\" LCD TV. The larger screen and higher image quality makes this a spectacular gaming/movie watching experience.I'm American, but lived in China for a year...in the city of QingDao, a few miles away from the headquarters for Haier. They are a well respected brand in China, and China's top electronics company...so I know how good Haier is. They've actually been making big screen TV's and selling them at Sears since the early 2000's, I know because I worked at Sears for 4 years.Pros: Awesome for gaming, clear image, great color, beautiful big screen that makes you feel like you're in the freaking movie. Whole nother level of movie watching/gaming experience. Some people will talk about \"this doesn't cmopare to my $800 Sony\" yada yada yada. If you are really into Blu Ray, or watch tons of sports, and are interested in paying double for a SLIGHTLY better image quality....go for it! I work two jobs, have lots of hobbies..I'm not that serious about my TV :)Cons: I have $70 speakers attached to it....you'll want to do the same eventually, but the same can be said about all TV's. Out of the box speakers suck. This is the only way to get a surround sound effect with Bass anyways... WELL WORTH IT. Grab some cheapo speakers from Walmart of Costco and you're good to go. My speaker system is 5 years old and still banging and awesome. It plugs into a basic head phones jack.I have to get back to work...so let me say this. I researched TV's all over newegg.com, amazon.com walmart, tigerdirect, craigslist... etc etc etc...for weeks. I normally don't even like to watch TV...I am a hiker, camper, nature lover, who is into gaming and some movies from time to time. But this TV is the best deal on a high quality big screen TV period. Spend an extra couple bucks and get the one that is \"used very good\". I spent $300 bucks for mine. For $300 dollars nowhere can you find another TV at this price level.PS: There is a 120HZ version of this tv out there, but gaming is only 60HZ....  you can't get more frames per second out of a console in 2013!!!", "Date": "May 10, 2013"}, {"Title": "A real great deal for the price", "Author": "icnewer", "ReviewID": "R5FAU2TBTO86Z", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I bought this TV before x'mas, the delivery is great and I got it really 2 days after I ordered. Most important, when I open the box & installed it well, it's really exceed expectation: I have to say it's a GREAT deal though it DOES have few defect (will list out below)! Before I bought it, I checked those reviews as well as price comparison with other brand in Amazon and other sites like Bestbuy/Wal-mart. Someone mentioned the sound is a mess but I didn't have the feeling at all: the sound is quite well to me at all (maybe because I;m not the AV genius); What my really amazed is its picture quality: clear, bright, natural.... I cant say any defect in picture quality at all: it's real HD profile when you watching HD TV, the feeling is great (I don't have blue-ray DVD, no comments on those blue-ray quality yet). Also, few men also mentioned it's Chinese brand, underlying that it's a fake product & can't expect high quality,,, but to me, I thought it's not true..... think about price, for all other brand, you can't image <$400 for a 46in 1080p HDTV (almost all >$550). So overall a real Great deal!But the TV does have a defect: when I explore different TV program quickly using remote controller, it will be stuck: I added few channels into \"favorite\", then switch channels between those favorites, almost every time TV will be stuck there if I change channels quickly: screen will be just blue there,,, no image nor audio out anymore... you have to plug out power cord from wall then re-plug in it to restart whole TV.... it's a real bug, I have asked Haier's support line, however no response from their technical team. I have exchanged a new TV from Amazon, but it's the same issue... Finally I just accept it to do those favorite channels more carefully... if there is no such defect,,, I will rate it as a full 5-start; now it can only be 4.5 star :)", "Date": "January 27, 2013"}, {"Title": "Arrived nonfunctional", "Author": "Smaptastic", "ReviewID": "R183CYRVJ3HQHM", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "On first start-up, it was clear that something was wrong.

Maybe a thousand stuck pixels down the right side of the TV.Upon turning on the cable (using component - my DVR's HDMI port is broken but component works fine), the sound was fine but the picture appeared through a gray-black-blue haze so thick you couldn't tell what it was.

If I'm pleasantly surprised by Haier's customer service and end up with a working TV, I'll revise this rating.Edit 1/9/2012: Haier's customer service was not good at fixing this problem in an expedient manner. They tried to send out a tech, which would have taken ~1 week, best case scenario. Called Amazon for a return and got amazing results. Truly awesome job by Amazon's return department. New TV was out within 2 business days and I finally get to review the thing based on its actual performance.It's a decent looking, dumb (as opposed to \"smart\") TV with not a lot of frills. At this size/price, I don't see how you can expect to do better than that. My current TV, without the issues Haier gave me in trying to resolve the issue, would receive 5 stars for exceeding expectations for the price.

Fedex delayed the next day shipment by a day due to weather, I got it checked the packaging to make sure everything was fine and got it in.Unpacking was quite easy, the TV set itself was surprisingly light and the frame is definitely small 5/8 inch and as indicated in product description. However the width of the panel itself is about 2.5 inches or so. I used the TV stand and screwing the panel to the included stand was very easy. All four simple screws. Getting the chords into the place took a little while , the power chord especially is located kind of in a groove on the back-panel  and is hard to reach. But since this would be more like one time effort I would not complain much on that given the cost of the TV. I hooked up the basic cable along with my Roku HDMI connector. Plugged on the power.Powering up brought up the blue screen with setup , should say fairly basic setup , language, cable channel setup etc. The channel search took a while but came back with all the digital and analog channels. The picture looked over-saturated and washed out a little bit.I could definitely see the LED backlight bleeding from right edges of the screen intermitantly , I presume they were more visible for darker screens. The black reproduction wants to beg for more unless you move to choose the \"Eco Picture\" setting which cuts down brightness just for everything on the screen and the blacks areas of course now look darker. After skimming to channels, analog, HD etc. I suddenly noticed that there was a fixed blue vertical line on the right top of the screen about 6 inches from the edge and running more than halfway down the screen. Initially i thought it must be something stuck on the plastic screen protector, that I did not yet remove. On closer examination thought the blue line appeared to be pixels stuck on the screen. I switched channels; HD, analog, Roku and nothing seemed to take the static pixels away. Then I tried the age old restart the device technique by unplugging the power for a while , plugging it back in etc. But I still had these streaming blue line stuck on the screen.  I decided to call up Amazon to process a return.I called up amazon today AM and told them about the situation , the lady was very helpful and she made me do reset thing with an addition hold the power button for 30 seconds. Even with this magic reset , the stubborn blue line did not fade away.Finally after 2 minutes or say , we gave up and I was asked if I needed a replacement and I had to say a NO and ask for the refund ! Right now I have packed it back used it for less than 3 hours and more hassle than I would have liked. Will drop it with UPS on Monday.For next time I will be wise and put in an additional $100-$150 and go for a reliable brand.I am not sure how Haier is planning to built up a brand image here in the US if the quality of the products does not keep up with competition.Others having similar screen issues ?", "Date": "December 29, 2012"}, {"Title": "Great value,", "Author": "Emilio", "ReviewID": "R2HYKP9ZG472KG", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Great picture, nice audio out outputs for upgrading the sound which is lacking.

In other words, expect problems hooking this up to your computer.  Had minor issues with a few Wii games (decided to trim 1 inch from sides).MAJOR ISSUE:  Like another reviewer, I had a light blue band (vertical) show up , within 5 days of light use.  Getting an exchange from Amazon, but I have ZERO confidence this TV will last a year.  Expect to exercise your warranty.  Double up with your credit card warranty or buy square-trade.So I am giving it one more chance...SUMMARY:  Based on other reviews, I would fork over a bit more for a TV with better quality control.

It's a gamble, this TV might cost more than we expect, if Haier forces the end-user to pay shipping.UPDATE RETURNING THIS UNIT, POOR QUALITY CONTROL:  Taking off one star from my previous review.  Received my exchange unit, but this unit has horrible light bleed on the right side.  Three big globes of light, top, middle and bottom right.  I cringe at every dark scene (I'll add photos).  Also, this unit had a random resolution change/flash when hooked up to my computer by HDMI (didn't happen in the previous unit), it would flash black, then blue, the image returned with the screen noting 480i, then black, blue, and back to 1080p (1080p being the HTPC output).  Happened maybe once or twice every hour.  Annoying to say the least.After considering my experiences and all the other reviews, I'm returning the TV.

It's pretty much the cheapest 46\" you can buy, so expectations are pretty low.  Overall it met or exceeded expectations, with a few exceptions.The picture is nice, crisp, clear.  There's no ghosting/blurring on fast action (sports, Michael Bay movies, etc).  It doesn't have that \"fake\" or \"digital\" look that some LCDs have.  Overall, I'm extremely happy with the picture.  The range of the display leaves a bit to be desired.  Using media reference designed for high end plasma's, this has about a third of the range (adjusting whites and blacks, AKA contrast and brightness).  I wouldn't expect a low end LCD to have the same range as a high end plasma, but unfortunately you have to sacrifice a little to get a \"balanced\" picture.The overall build quality is nice.  It has a nice matte screen (not glossy), so it does pretty well at not reflecting ambient light.  The bezel, buttons, inputs, etc are all very nicely done, you wouldn't know it was a budget TV from any of those.  Only time will tell how well those hold up.One big and one minor negative.  For the minor one, there are two really bad hotspots in the upper left and upper right corners.  It's only noticeable on _really_ dark scenes (think of scenes at night in the recent Batman movies), and even then only if you're looking for it.  It's very visible on solid black screens, but those don't really happen in normal viewing.The major negative is mine came with a stuck pixel.  Unfortunately it's green (so visible on any dark or neutral colored scenes, not visible on light colored scenes) and it's near the middle of the screen.  Haven't done much to try and un-stick it yet.  Haven't reached out to Haier yet either.  This one stuck pixel is the reason for four stars instead of five.Overall this is a solid purchase for the price (even with the stuck pixel).

The tech said it would be 3 days and they would call us the decision. Three days come and go, one week comes and goes we called the local company. Run around, run around from them, they are waiting to hear.....Another week goes by. We called the local company again. They promise us we will hear from them on Monday. Well, we did and we are to contact Haier and they will take care of the problem....we call Haier, the next week after not hearing from them and now they have to verify all their information and they will get back to us by Friday....What?

Seems that Haier was well aware of Amazon's 30 day return policy because I was notified by Haier's repair service the day after the return date that the TV's defective board replacement part was on back order and would not be in until Mar. 17--\"back ordered from China and would come over on a boat\"--quote from Haier representative. I stated to the Haier representative that since the TV would not be functional for 2.5 months, the warranty should be extended to cover that time span. Haier refused. I contacted Amazon and the representative mentioned that I should have contacted Amazon for support--a hidden service???? The common practice of retailers in fulfilling warranties is for the customer to contact the manufacturer. Bottom line--the product is defective, and must be one of many judging from the back order of the board, and the best Haier and Amazon offered was, \"I'm sorry; I understand how you feel but there's nothing we can do.\" I would give both the product and service a negative rating if that were possible.

It was two days before we got the sat box working again.The new 46inch Haier TV has a built in digital antenna that saved us, we got a few channels out of the air.I replaced the sat box amplifier, and restored the direct TV.Wow great hd and at the price of $338 a discount of $460 below the list price of $799.I get to watch the PRO BOWL 2013 today on HD live from Aloha Stadium,just down the road from us, but not in the rain predicted to be very heavy today.I hope this review was not to boring.Aloha JohnShipping Method:  FREE Super Saver ShippingItems:  $338.41Shipping & Handling:  $34.24Super Saver Discount:  -$34.24  ------Total before tax:  $338.41Estimated tax to be collected:  $0.00  ------Order Total:  $338.41Delivery estimate: Jan. 8, 2013 - Jan. 14, 2013  1 \"Haier LE46A2280 46-Inch 1080p 60Hz Slim LED HDTV\"Electronics; $338.41In Stock  Sold by: Amazon.com LLC", "Date": "January 27, 2013"}, {"Title": "Haier LE46A2280 46-Inch 1080p 60Hz Slim LED HDTV", "Author": "Nelson", "ReviewID": "R70L0X4WX1Y60", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "its my first lcd tv so I really have nothing to compare it too, but I really like the picture on it and the price was unbeatable", "Date": "January 27, 2013"}, {"Title": "Meet my expectations for $$ spent", "Author": "Sara", "ReviewID": "R2MUFQ2C7ANLCR", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "I spent 350 at the time of my purchase.

The picture quality is good, and with a few adjustments mentioned by other reviewers it can be great, but without the adjustments it looks to me like the color intensity is a bit too bright.The TV is physically light enough that one person can handle it without a lot of trouble.The TV itself seems to be a bit lacking when it comes to basic construction though.  It seems a bit, um, \"plastic-y\" to me.The TV base works all right, but it is nowhere as stable as the stand on my Panasonic TV which is of comparable size (and which I still prefer to the Haier).It soon became obvious that the Haier was not able to accommodate all of my older electronics.  I have a VCR and DVD player that both connect to the TV via RCA cables, but there is only one set of RCA input posts on the TV so I have to manually switch the cables if I want to use unit that is not currently plugged in.  I know I should probably upgrade those units, but, hey, they still work just fine, so I'll just keep using them.  Anyway, the lack of RCA inputs is a major shortcoming in my book.The input options work fine if you don't want to attach too much stuff to the TV.  There is a computer jack, a couple of HDMI ports, a USB port or two, one set of RCA jacks and one set of component audio jacks.It will work fine if you want to connect a receiver that handles your equipment plus your cable.I have to admit that I'm a bit stymied about why Haier didn't include any jacks on the front or side of the TV for allowing easy access for plugging in a camera or camcorder.  Hm...Oh, one more thing.  When I turn on the TV the video comes on right away, but the audio won't come on for a few (5-10) seconds.  The first couple of times I turned it on I wondered if there was something wrong with the audio feed or TV speakers, but for whatever reason, it just takes a few seconds to gather itself.All in all, I'd say that this is a good, but not great TV.I'll give it 4 stars.", "Date": "January 24, 2013"}, {"Title": "Superb Bargain at 330", "Author": "Daniel", "ReviewID": "R1OLYYBG5SNXOY", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "So I bought this TV like new at $330.

It was advertised as used but great condition. When the Tv came it looked brand new to me. I couldn't tell if it had ever been used before or not. No scratches or blemishes, everything was packaged like a new TV. The picture is big and bright. I don't see any edge bleeding that others have noticed. If you stand close to the Tv There is a small amount of electrical noise, but if you are more than 5 feet away you cant even hear it. And when your watching TV you definitely don't hear it. This TV is hanging on the wall in my bedroom hooked up to an HTPC with an hd6450 graphics card. The TV is very thin, much thinner than the JVC 32\" LCD tv it replaced. The finish is a black brushed aluminum which looks amazing. You would never guess I paid under $300 for it.The only problem I have had, which I cannot confidently attribute to the TV is when I set the resolution to 1080P 60HZ refresh in the computer I get an occasional line that flickers about 5\" below the top of the screen. Setting the resolution to 720p fixed this. I believe what I am experiencing is called screen tearing. I am not sure if it's the HDMI cable, my graphics card or the TV. I haven't tried swapping any components out, as most of what I watch is in 720P or lower anyways. And XBMC will adjust the resolution back up for 1080P movies. I'll update it if I ever figure it out. I have a very strong feeling it wouldn't do it with a cable box or Blu-ray players and such. I think it's something with my particular setup, unless the TV just doesn't like high resolution? IDK draw your own conclusion on that.Sound is not great. I would call it \"okay\" I plan to add a surround sound later, but for now the onboard sound is good enough for me. If you're an audiophile you will have a sound system regardless of the TV so the onboard sound is not such a big deal. The sound out is just a headphone jack, but that's basically the same as RCA. Adapters are only a couple dollars. And computers and electronics have their own sound outputs.I see the TV has now gone up to $589.99. I probably wouldn't pay what they want now, especially knowing it was around $360 just a few weeks ago, and I paid $285. In the TV's defense I only buy products below their value, not at their value or above it. I think the TV is a $600 TV and it was a steal at anything below $400. Now it's just another $600 LED TV which their are dozens to choose from at that price point.Conclusion:All in all it's a $600 TV that you might be able to pick up for under $400.

The picture is bright and pretty good quality, but the speakers in this TV are some of the worst I've heard. Everything sounds like you're listening in on a telephone. Luckily you can hook up external ones with the headphone jack or digital audio output.My biggest issue with the TV is the overscanning on the HDMI inputs. Like nearly every other HDTV, this TV will stretch the picture out so that the edges of the original picture are not visible. This is a holdover from the analog TV days where there could be junk data at the edge of the picture so stretching it out hid them. For digital signals, this junk data doesn't exist, yet TVs still stretch the image out. On most newer (I guess maybe mid and high end televisions, like my far more expensive Samsung I bought a year ago) you can disable this \"feature\" and get a nice crisp picture. Unfortunately I didn't find a way in this TV's barren menu system to disable overscanning.This becomes a major problem when you want to hook up a computer over HDMI since the edges of your screen which contain the taskbar, and the controls at the top of your screen are not visible. Some graphics drivers will allow you to shrink the picture so that once your TV stretches it back out you can see the edges, but this has great loss in quality. On Intel graphics it's called underscan under the custom resolution option. On NVIDIA cards this is called resize. I was able to get disable overscanning with my 5 year old Maganavox 37\" 1080p TV by setting the timings to CVT-RB (reduced blanking) but this has no effect on this TV nor other more recent low-end televisions that don't have the option to disable overscanning.The only way to hook up a PC without overscanning is through the VGA port, but that doesn't carry audio so you also need to use a 3.5mm cable. You can get combination VGA/3.5mm cables to make this less of a hassle. You won't be able to play blu-rays or any other HDCP protected content from your PC over VGA, though, but online streaming and other files will work fine.One of the best parts of this TV is its absolutely great over the air TV tuner. I have a long coaxial cable running from a satellite box upstairs to the coaxial port in this TV and had forgotten to buy a coaxial splitter so that I can hook up an antenna and the satellite box to the coaxial input, so I plugged the satellite coaxial straight in and did a channel search to at least get that for now. Amazingly the TV picked up all but one of the OTA channels in my area and the one that it didn't pick up is a very weak signal broadcast far away. I am unsure how the TV is able to pick these channels up because there is no antenna connected to the coaxial cable, so the cable itself must be acting as an antenna, but I've never had a TV pick up signals this well without an actual antenna. While the TV picks up channels very well, it takes ages to flip between them! This is the slowest TV I've used recently, taking something like 2 seconds to change channels.Overall for the price I paid, I would recommend this TV.UPDATE: I was trying to play some Peggle 2 on my Xbox One and the overscan on this TV was just too much, causing vital parts of the game to be off-screen so I started some Googling. It didn't take too long before I found how to get into the service menu: MENU, 8, 8, 9, 3. After pressing those buttons a blue menu appears in the top left corner of your screen. Scroll down to \"Other\" and press right. Then scroll down to OverScan and press right. Adjust the \"H. Size\" and \"V. Size\" all the way up to their maximum (+50) and you'll almost completely turn off overscan. Unfortunately there are still a few missing columns on the left edge, but it's a giant improvement over the factory setting. It isn't 1:1 mapping so using a computer over HDMI will still not be optimal. Use VGA if possible basically.", "Date": "January 7, 2013"}, {"Title": "Does the job", "Author": "Jon K.

When you are using HDMI inputs for a Roku, Blue Ray etc You cannot zoom when a movie is letterboxed. You can do so when using the coax input. Looks like they locked out certain available features to keep the price down. Not a big deal for me, especially with this generous size screen.\"*** NO ZOOM ON HDMI!!! ***  There are only two options -- Normal and Wide (but there should still be a Zoom or Stretch option, which just isn't there).  This has affected us when trying to play Call of Duty: Black Ops 2 using the PS3 on this TV.  The full screen is actually used up just until you leave the multiplayer lobby and actually start battling others online.  (EDIT:  Apparently, this is just when 2 people play on the same screen... and 1 player actually does use the full screen.)  Then there's about a 3-inch thick line down both left & right side of the screen.  As Mike points out, you CAN zoom on coax cable, but not HDMI.Personally, I would have bought this TV for myself, but aspect ratio zooming is an important feature to me.  If you are using this as a monitor, then computers can be made to do all types of aspect ratio zooming thru software... so not a problem there.

It's LED, so it's more energy efficient and should last longer than a traditional LCD. And of course it's slim and light for its size.Cons: a lot of light bleed around the edges, which only effects black or really dark scenes, but I believe someone had tips how to minimize this. Otherwise none really.Comments: It does have a bump on the back so it's not super slim, but its not 2 grand either. And only 2 hdmi, but easily fixed with an hdmi switch. The sound is ok for a tv. It's not going to give you movie theater sound, but sounded about as good as any tv I've owned.

It may be OK for some, but there were some issues with the picture that were a turn-off. We currently have a 32\" Sceptre TV, and we were looking for a larger LED TV for our family room. We LOVE the Sceptre set, but could not find a good deal on a larger one, so we took a risk with this company, and are now awaiting a Seiki 42\" to arrive (after shipping this one back).The cons:1. If you do not already know, all of these lower-priced models come with horrible sound (seriously, my 20 year old 19\" Magnavox from college has better speakers), so you essentially need a sound system. No problem, right? Well, this set has ZERO audio output jacks...literally...aside from a headphone jack, so our sound system that has RCA connectors (the Red/White cables) was useless. It was VERY difficult to tell what this set had or did not have in this regard.2. The picture on this set was...odd to say the least. It \"jumped\" constantly...meaning, it seemed to break up quite a bit, and there would be odd horizontal lines jumping through the picture. No way.3. DVD's looked horrid...at least through the composite (red/white/yellow) connection for the player we have downstairs. On out Sceptre (mentioned above), DVD's look fantastic, but on this set they were fuzzy, and occasionally it looked like a 3D movie without the glasses...strange dances of red and green moving through a blurred image.So, we took a risk, and in the end, were very dissatisfied. Maybe we just got a lemon, but the lack of audio output terminals was a deal-breaker either way.The Pros:Amazon! UPS is coming to our house with no cost to us to take away this monster while we await the arrival of the 42\" Seiki set...Amazon's return policy is wonderful, which is why other than a couple hours of fiddling around, we are out nothing.So, thank you to Amazon, and so long to Haier. :)", "Date": "January 1, 2013"}, {"Title": "Excellent TV", "Author": "Molly", "ReviewID": "R3SP22COSEFMIB", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I ordered this to replace my broken Sharp 47\" HDTV.

It was maddening (another gratuitous pun). I saw this TV on Amazon, and compared it to other LED HDTVs in the same price range; separately, I also compared them to other TVs in their size-class (I used nominal 42\" and 47\" for comparison), and determined after taking all into consideration that this was a deal of near-epic proportions.Yeah, it was less full-featured than many of the others in both comparisons, but I have all kinds of adapters, converters, and Y cables (splitters), so no computer or monitor tells me what I can't do. Also, I have a media box that gives it network and Internet connectivity, so I don't care that it isn't wireless. Great. Now, how to come up with the money...? I live (barely) on my Disability check, and that was a week off, and I seriously wanted to watch the last week of the regular season on a new TV.I've had prior experience with Haier; I've visited their main office and factory in Qingdao, and I've used their products on trips to China for many years: portable air-conditioners/dehumidifiers, refrigerators, fans, TVs in hotels all over China, and other electronic appliances that are much better than their familiar-branded competition, so I was pretty sure it was the best deal I could possibly find.I'd been thinking about selling one of my handguns because it was really an extra, and not a necessity, but I hadn't decided to pull the trigger on selling it (yes, one more gratuitous pun) until I realized that it was the 26th, 26 people were killed at Sandy Hook, and that #26GoodDeeds or something similar was trending on Twitter. So, with that in mind, I went out and sold the gun to a reputable dealer who I know operates within the law, drove through the teller window at my bank and deposited the money, and bought the TV that night.With 2nd-day delivery, I had it in time for the weekend's football games, and was really surprised the TV had such a wide viewing range, and so many different auto-set backlighting options, including an energy-saving mode and a manual, customizable mode. This especially impressed me because I'd read on HDGuru that a lot of major brands have no backlighting control and are turned way up at the factory. But I didn't need to make any adjustment to the factory settings on this TV, except to turn on the energy-saving mode when I wasn't watching a football game (during which I used Sports mode - the preset was perfect).I am very satisfied with my purchase, and I would recommend this TV with no reservations at all.
