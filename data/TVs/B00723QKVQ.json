I cannot believe this has not been mentioned. It makes a SUBSTANTIAL difference, because some panels they use should be in TV's that cost $100 less.[...]Can you imagine buying a car because you know its manufacturer uses great, reliable engines, only to find out that they use completely different engines without telling you, all of which are of lower quality? Samsung does this with their TVs, and some of them don't EVER have Samsung panels (e.g., the 37\" model will NEVER have a Samsung panel because they don't make 37\" panels). Samsung uses 4 different panel types from four different manufacturers - each with a substantially different technology.You can tell which panel YOUR TV has by the \"Version\" on the sticker outside of the box. There's also a sticker on the back of the TV; the \"Version\" code is below the Model number and above the S/N. BTW, reviews can't be interpreted without the four-digit Version code because they are quite simply different TV's. Here's how to interpret them:(\"x\" means a number, probably from 1-4, that represents the version of that panel - higher means newer but not always better).TH0x or TS0x: Samsung S-PVA panel (possibly just a PVA, if you're less lucky): This is what you thought you were buying. Best color, best black, best viewing angles.HS0x: Sharp ASV panel: Lower contrast ratio, more narrow viewing angle. I read HS02 in particular has terrible ghosting.A_0X: AOU A-MVA panel: Even lower contrast ratio.CH0x or CM0x or CS0x: Chimea S-MVA panel: You lost the lottery. Markedly worse in every way - way worse viewing angle, color reproduction, etc. Just a terrible rip-off.Mine, from Amazon, is an HS03, so a Sharp panel. I will be testing it tomorrow (DVD and watching football - no Blu-ray). There is a decent chance I return it, because it is not a Samsung. Also? Sony and Panasonic do much less \"panel lottery\" and are vowing to stop entirely. LG does not do a panel lottery. Samsung has absolutely no plans to stop, and they only use \"standards\" that won't reveal a difference between the different panels.I will update after doing more testing. I just simply could not believe that this was not mentioned. Nothing like finding out you paid $500 (40\" model) for a $400 TV when that extra $100 could have been used for sound, Blu-Ray, etc.**Other reviewers, please, update your reviews to give your version code!**More reading:[...]UPDATED 10/24/12: Added info on how to find version number without the box.", "Date": "October 20, 2012"}, {"Title": "Great TV after a lot of tweaking", "Author": "Gordon \"PS3/PC Gamer!\"", "ReviewID": "R4MKQH5MRSOX5", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "If you're anything like me you see that this TV is labeled as LED; then you look at the picture and see a lot of fat for the usual Samsung LED depth. Make no mistake this is an LED TV.  I got this for my bedroom to replace my 23 inch Samsung Syncmaster. I use this TV mostly for 1080 mp4 movies and blurays (I download what I want to watch instead of waiting for it on cable), and my Xbox and PS3.I learned 2 things about the TV right off the bat. If you have Comcast, you cannot fully customize the TV's picture. An essential feature called HDMI black levels actually looks much better when its set to low. I have 2 different Comcast HD boxes and since neither of them broadcast at 1080, this feature is locked out. Long story short, Comcast had me thinking I purchased my first dud from Samsung. Seriously, the colors look washed out and none of the channels really had that crisp clear picture I was hoping for. If you plan to use this solely for Comcast, I can't really recommend it. In fact, I've always found blu ray quality to be so much better than cable that I've stopped using cable for anything but football and cartoons. Movies MUST be in my PS3's blu ray player or my own 1080p files.The second thing I learned about is what the depth is for. Samsung didn't advertise this (or maybe its just my TV), but I have absolutely NO BACKLIGHT BLEED. When Black Ops goes to the loading screen on my Xbox, it gets so dark that I think the TV is off! The only indication that it is on is the Black Ops logo in the corner spinning. There isn't even the SLIGHTEST inkling of white anywhere! I'm not exaggerating. The obvious second reason why this TV is fat for an LED is that Samsung made an effort to improve the sound. When I turn on the HD surround coupled with the movie option, there is much more bass than I thought it would be. THe explosions in my games and the soundtracks in movies sound vastly better than I thought they would. Granted, I am not the type to go out and spend 600 on some Bose speakers, but the sound is NOT a con for me this time around.NOW ON TO THE PICTUREAs I said, I was not exactly thrilled with the picture RIGHT off the bat. It looked like my old 23 inch Syncmaster, just a lot bigger. Let me tell you, this is not one of those TV's that look great right out of the box. You have to toy around with the settings a bit to get the optimal picture. I wanted sharpness coupled with colors that pop like crazy.....and I got it. Dynamic is the brightest setting, but I coupled this with the HDMI black levels set to low (option not available for Comcast cable box) and voila, moving photographs! I'm not a pro but this is my setup:Mode: DynamicBacklight: 18Contrast: 85Brightness: 50Sharpness: 80Color: 70TInt: G/R 50/50Standard color tone with screen fit in the additional options, with HDMI black level set to low.My games and blurays look AMAZING. The picture is easily better than my mom's 46 inch Samsung up front. REMEMBER that some of the good options are cut off from Comcast and the use of component cables. In games, I do have to up the brightness or gamma a little, but it ends up looking BRILLIANT. I am going through my entire library of games and they feel like entirely new experiences! There is a 32 inch 720p option as well, but I just was not comfortable with 720p max. The new game consoles are gojng to have native 1080 so that's what I wanted. BTW did I mention I'm a big gamer?THE CONSWell I saw this TV up on Amazon before it was on Samsung's website. Yeah, WOW. Sometimes I wanted to see the TVs specs from Samsung directly before I made my buy. Make no mistake this is NOT a 120 HZ tv although it is labeled as one. I have no idea what clearmotion 120 is, but it makes my TV much darker. The feature is entirely useless and does nothing to the picture or add the \"soap opera\" effect like I had hoped (it looks great for games).WITH A COMCAST CABLE BOX I could see no difference between HDMI and component. I kept switching back and fourth, but since the max output is 1080i, there were no differences in picture.The last iteration of this TV had 4 HDMIs. What happened?VERDICTWith a lot of tweaking, I got the picture to look beautiful. I will use my Comcast box sparingly, but I might move to FIOS if the support full 1080. Watching movies on my PS3 and playing games on my Xbox stopped me from returning the TV. I will not be surprised if this set gets bad reviews from Comcast users (even though Its not Samsung's fault). I'm a \"videophile\" and this passed my personal test with vibrant colors.FEEL FREE TO ASK ME ANYTHING!", "Date": "February 26, 2012"}, {"Title": "Fantastic TV (after a few minor adjustments)", "Author": "bareyb", "ReviewID": "R2ZWW050W5NH3", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "If you are looking for the best picture quality for the buck, you have found it.

Karels", "ReviewID": "R3OKG0DLBUG8XA", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I received this TV yesterday to add a TV for our bedroom.  I own another Samsung LCD so I knew I would be happy with this one.Since it was going into the bedroom, it didn't need to be fancy or have all the bells and whistles.  I figure I'll add a Roku or Apple TV to it and be all set.While this TV is LED, it's not as thin as you're used to seeing.  I believe it's just over three inches thick in the rear, but it has a very thin bezel up front.  It has minimal connections in back, but all I'll ever use is HDMI, so that doesn't concern me.  Picture quality out-of-the-box is great and became even nicer with a little tweaking.  That's usually the first thing I do is try to eyeball calibrate it at first.  It's too new to have any good calibration settings posted on the net; I figure I'll use last year's 'D' model as a guideline and wait until settings are posted.  I did not notice any flash-lighting with this model -- something that plagued last year's 'D' lineup.  I have yet to play any 1080p material on this to really test it (only watched a few minutes of HDTV ((720p)) broadcasts), so I'll update this post when I do.Note this year's 'EH' line is Samsung's basic model lineup, with the 'ES' being the more expensive, feature-laden models.  This is a great set if you want a basic, quality LED with a nice pricepoint.EDIT 3/5/2012: Update 1080p content.  I've set up my streaming process to this TV with some 1080p material and it is gorgeous.  We recently watched Toy Story on this set, and I was blown away by the color depth and detail this TV displayed.  A small caveat: with all TVs, the speakers could use some improvement.  Set on the 'standard' audio output, the sound is fine.  If you set it to 'music' or 'movie', the audio sounds much better, but can rattle the TV's enclosure if the volume is set high.", "Date": "February 11, 2012"}, {"Title": "Very pleased", "Author": "wfc", "ReviewID": "R28S8NY9V03N50", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "As a grandmother who is not as technologically advanced as the younger generation, I did have concerns about buying a television that had to be programmed and the stand installed before using.  However, my fears were unwarranted.  As soon as I turned it on, I was stepped through the programming and the stand or base was very simple to install.  With the weight only being less than 15 pounds, I was also easily able to manuever it by myself.  I was watching programs within an hour although younger people would have managed all of this in fifteen minutes.My initial reason for wanting a newer television was due to my waning vision so had been looking into the 1080p with a 32\" screen for some time.  I can't believe how much I can read on that screen now that wasn't clear to me before.  I had been advised that Samsung was one of most trustworthy brands, but found them locally to be out of my price range.  This one was reasonably priced and with my Amazon Prime membership was shipped to me free and quickly I might add.I am very pleased with the color and the sound plus the ease of use with the remote in case I do have to change the color or sound in the future.  I'm not thrilled with having to adjust the size of the picture when going from watching a news program with written information at the bottom of the screen to watching a movie, but it is easy to do so will just have to adjust to that feature.", "Date": "February 18, 2012"}, {"Title": "Picture out the box = AWFUL...

It's only my 2nd flat screen but I can still attest that this one is a keeper. The colors are great, the picture is crisp and you will find it to be an overall very pleasant viewing experience. I have not yet tried all of it's features but I did do some tweaking. There's not an overwhelming amount of options to choose from in the picture menu but it is definitely adequate. I would recommend this tv if you like the \"set it and forget it\" philosophy. It certainly makes things simpler and you get a great picture with the built in presets. If you do like to tweak then you can find a few things to play with but it is just not extensive. I like the music setting on the audio menu. I prefer the music preset. Let me advise you that this is the tv to beat in terms of audio quality. It is EXCELLENT in that department. The thing gets plenty loud at a low level but at the same time the lowest volume is not overly loud at all. I love it. There's a rich deep bass inherent to the set that I find difficult to eq out. At times it sounds a little odd but you get used to it and most of the times you will find yourself enjoying it. I have Comcast cable and this tv brings the music channels to life. I don't think I could have made a better choice for the money I paid. The screen works equally well as a computer monitor. You're going to have to go into the source menu and hit the tools function to change the name of the connection to PC or DVI to get it to look its best. I'm kind of bummed about there only being two hdmi connections but you can work around that with an hdmi switcher. I actually am only using one hdmi connection at the moment but I plan on getting a blu ray player soon. Good thing I moved this screen out of my computer setup and put it in the living room by itself. I can see the connections getting full really fast. By the way, the remote is awesome. It's compact and actually has a back light. I love the way the buttons smell too. TMI? Maybe. I do have to say that this tv is quite a bargain and there is not much that you will not like. Highly recommended.", "Date": "June 12, 2012"}, {"Title": "A top mid-range TV; excellent in 'almost* every way", "Author": "Christopher Engel", "ReviewID": "RCBEFMRUQ8SRY", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "UPDATE: 8/3/2012 *massive* changes and deletions made to reflect the Eco settings and how to get the best picture possible with no regards to power consumption. Equally massive changes made for picture optimization with new discoveries.UPDATE: 6/28/2012 (various changes)***Let's just start off with what really matters: The only thing wrong with this TV is the unique \"LED Motion Sensing\" technology. In theory, this allegedly causes the backlight to have a \"strobe\" effect so as to enhance motion in a way similar to higher refresh rates, and, in theory, help with the problem of HDTV blurring. This is simply misleading marketing, as it does not, in fact, do that at any point, no matter how much I test with it on whatever scene. If it is indeed happening, I don't notice it.Now, if you've ever seen a high-end, larger TV, you can't help but notice the so-called \"soap opera effect\" (I'm not sure why it's called that--it just means the fluidity of the picture is far superior to a standard 60Hz rate, and is certainly impressive to look at). I, personally, was under the impression that I was practically stealing for this \"LED Motion Sensing\" with its variable 120Hz rate. Obviously, this isn't anywhere near the case, and it still operates as a smaller, more budget-friendly TV with a lot of good things about it.So what does LED Motion Sensing do? Well, it darkens the picture. That's as far as I notice any difference at all. However, on the bright side, it reduces power consumption very significantly. More on that in a bit.But, hey, it's cheap for a reason, right? A 1080p TV with a lot of other bells and whistles, often very easy to get at $400, which is the same price as the widely hailed king of mid-range TVs, Panasonic. I actually had returned a Panasonic Viera in favor of this, due to an obviously defective unit that had serious issues of constantly turning itself off and then only a specific hard reset for turning back on.One thing you can't knock this TV for is every other thing it houses. The picture quality, if tweaked correctly, is simply gorgeous. Blacks are so purely dark with no hint whatsoever of a washed-out picture. The option that allows the TV to detect flesh and boost its color works surprisingly well without looking ridiculous, even at the highest setting. I enjoy using this setting.You get a wealth of options at your fingertips, from tweaking the picture to obscene levels and changing various levels of whites, darks, colors, and dynamic contrast, as well as a variety of eco-friendly settings for those who care about energy consumption, like me. Let's run down the important settings, the first being an \"optimal\" picture with no concern for energy consumption, the second being for everyday use with energy consumption in mind, and also to prevent overheating.Okay! When it comes to generalized settings that work for pretty much any signal, but are best for 1080p HDMI 1.4 pictures, such as in Blu-rays, this is what I've come up with (if something is missing, consider it totally unchanged from default settings)Picture:Mode: MovieBacklight: 20Contrast: 100Brightness: 45 (this is *just* when the picture is about to become noticeably too bright, and darks no longer look dark enough.)Sharpness: 100 (incredibly, this TV can handle it without that horrible ultra-static and deformed picture effects--the native 1080p versus 720p can probably be given a hat tip for that)Color: 100 (This is actually important. See, the more a TV can give you color before it clearly becomes over-saturated is key in how vibrant the picture is and the TV's ability to process the colors. To my blessed surprise, a setting of a maxed-out 100 does not over-saturate, and things seem to look exactly as they should. However, your results may vary, and personal preference is part of this setting.)Gamma: +3Dynamic Contrast: Maxed outBlack Tone: Dark (the first setting below normal, not Darker or Darkest, which will make dark scenes far too difficult to see)-> All Eco settings turned off, including LED Motion Sensing.Color Space: NativeDynamic Contrast: HighFlesh Tone: +15 (has no apparently deleterious effect on emphasizing picture, but it does make it more vibrant)Color Tone: Mostly preference, but Warm1 seems to be best for me. Warm2 is too much red and Normal doesn't seem to be enough, although sometimes it does look better, depending on what's on the screen.Digital Noise Filter: High (DO NOT keep this at Auto. The TV AI does not do a good job of determining when this feature should be on and to what level. I see no problem at all with keeping this on High at all times, which drastically reduces noise, which is present on even 1080p sources.)LED Motion Plus: Off. As much as I want to say to keep this on, as it was a strong factor in my purchasing decision, I just can't find a real reason to. It sounds so good on paper, sure, but it just doesn't deliver what it promises at all. The drop in picture quality from keeping it on just isn't worth it, and I see absolutely no noticeable difference in fluidity due to the alleged \"strobe\" backlighting.FOR ECO-CONSCIOUS USERS: This is how you configure the most eco-friendly setting, \"Standard\", as opposed to \"Movie\". Be sure to switch these modes for practical reasons, and also because \"Movie\" does not allow for certain settings.Some of us just can't have our cake and eat it too. With the TV running at absolute max settings through and through, it's going to burn energy really, really fast. With regular use, your electric bills will reflect it.Now, the Eco features present here seem a lot more complicated than they really are. But ultimately, you can turn everything off except a couple of things.Note: There is the \"Auto Eco\" setting that does absolutely nothing but darken the picture, but even one notch below off is a strong difference. It's better to simply lower the backlight manually.To be conscious of your energy usage, keep the backlight at ten or lower instead of a constant 20. Turn LED Motion Sensing on (you might as well, since the picture's going to have less backlight, anyway), and, depending on how it works for you, choose whether or not to use motion sensing. Sometimes this setting can make the picture weird, like it's fading in and out way too fast to adjust to lighting. Sometimes it's not even noticeable. I, personally, keep it off. Really, the backlight is where all the energy consumption comes from, and simply lowering it, either manually or through the Auto Eco system (set to either Low or Medium is the farthest you can go while still seeing the picture--I can't imagine anyone tolerating lower than the Low setting, which I just can't stand)Final Notes:1. Do not use auto leveling of audio between inputs. The TV's way of handling this is very poor, and will give you distorted sounds all over the place if you use this. Just keep volume leveling options off.2. Game Mode doesn't really do anything except make the picture darker and less detailed. It also makes the screen have a strange but deliberate shaking motion, I guess to...I dunno, make explosions more realistic for your screen? I'm not sure. Either way, even if you're gaming, keep it off. The vast difference in picture quality definitely is not worth the sacrifice for the occasional screen shaking, its only apparent use.3. Don't forget to disable the inputs you don't use and to label the inputs you do use to prevent any confusion. Only 2 HDMI inputs is downright cruel, but thankfully, that's all I need. Anyone who needs more, though, shouldn't be looking at a 32\" in the first place. What else do you plan to hook up to it besides maybe an HDTV box and a Playstation 3?4. While I can't confirm this myself, I've heard rumors that updating the firmware via a USB stick--including official firmware straight from samsung.com--voids your warranty, as it's considered tampering. Yeah, that sounds a little weird. I had already updated it before I read that, but someone else could probably clarify that much better than I could, if it's true.5. As of right now, the official firmware for the TV has not changed since I first purchased this. No need for any updating unless you haven't done it since June.Alright, that's that. Considering how much I got it for (about $400), this is truly an outstanding television with a spectacular picture quality, not to mention full 1080p support. For a display this small, the jump from 720p to 1080p is not all that significant, and unnoticeable unless you're specifically looking for it. Don't be fooled into thinking that, by default, 1080p means a much better picture than 720p. It doesn't, unless your television is at least 40 inches in size. However, what it *does* mean is that you can max out sharpness, color, contrast, and pretty much anything that benefits from a native 1080p resolution, which is unlike a 720p needing a downgrade, and subsequently requiring far different settings.I'll say it again: Good luck, fellow TV shoppers and consumerists.", "Date": "June 28, 2012"}, {"Title": "Very, very nice.", "Author": "jfcomposer", "ReviewID": "R35FE2NJRLH6GU", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Just received the 32\" version (without all the internet bells and whistles).The Good:- Excellent sharpness and well-saturated colors out of the box.

You have the regular settings such as brightness, contrast, sharpness, backlight and so on, which are usually enough to get a perfectly good image, but this TV also has a couple \"Advanced\" areas with some outstanding adjustments.  Most of the controls in those areas should probably be left alone for most people, but even if you do experiment with them, it is easy to get them back to normal by setting them to \"0\".  These are adjustments with controls for each individual RGB color which are outstanding for anyone with the knowledge to use than and a calibration disc.One unusual adjustment that gave a huge improvement for me was the \"Gamma\" which I dropped to -1.  This made a great improvement in making the TV appear more \"Film Like\".  Along with other common adjustments like reducing the contrast, color, brightness and making some small adjustment to the hue, usually a notch or two toward green so everyone doesn't look like they have sunburns.  But, the first adjustment is to set the color temperature to \"Warm 2\", which is the warmest setting and is still none too warm.  After seeing the distinctly blue cast of the TV out of the box, this may seem a little warm, but your eyes will recover quickly to see this is generally the best setting.  This should be done BEFORE any other picture settings because if it isn't, all the others will be thrown off with this change.Finally, the sharpness setting appears to be \"off\" at 50 (see update below), which is the initial setting.  If the goal is to have a smooth, pleasant, film like image, no extra sharpening should be used.  Typically, a lot of images are already sharpened too much to begin with and more just causes all sorts of artifacts.  Setting this much below 50 definitely UN-sharpens the image, which isn't good either.My goal is to get the smoothest, most pleasant and film-like image, so my suggestions won't be for everyone.  I do suggest anyone try them at some time, though.  It can be surprising how much nicer a gentle, well resolved image is over the harsh ones.Update 1/22/13:  I've had this TV for a couple months now and I am still quite happy with it.  Since then I learned about the various panels it comes with and mine appears to have a Sharp panel.  I also decided to get the 32\" version as well, which appears to have a Samsung panel.  It may have a slightly better picture, but the difference is small.For anyone struggling with settings, I have set both units to the same calibration, and they both look quite good.  I see a lot of rather \"hot\" settings being posted here, so for anyone looking for a good starting point that is more \"film like\", this is what I have settled on with both TVs, so they are probably good starting points.Backlight: 18Contrast: 50Brightness: 48Sharpness: 35Color: 43Hue: G53/R47Gamma: -1Color Tone: Warm2The sharpness can probably go down a bit since I sometimes still see a little \"ringing\", and the Warm2 color tone setting still can tend to be too cool for my tastes.  Keep in mind that these aren't going to be best for all TVs or people, particularly the hue setting.  I find most of the other settings posted here are WAY too high on contrast, color and brightness.  I have NEVER seen any TV that looked good with those above the initial or middle setting.", "Date": "November 23, 2012"}, {"Title": "Beautiful Picture - No extra's, but has just what you need!", "Author": "Brian", "ReviewID": "R1BL1LM2Q0CSNZ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I have a 5 year old Panasonic Viera plasma TV in my home theater and purchased this as a secondary set for the bedroom.

For anyone that doesn't know, it is an LED LCD.  Prior units marked as just LCD used CCFL (Cold Cathode Fluorescent Lamps) for their backlight which draws more power and produces more heat.  The new wave are just being labeled LED and of course use LED's for the backlight which are much lower in power usage and produce virtually no heat.  I have read from other reviews that the panel is deeper/thicker than most LED tv's so I was not shocked when I pulled it out of the box.  It's still a thin TV for what it is, but I tend to think the added depth is for the speakers.  The picture quality is great after quite a bit of tweaking.  I tried using some settings other users have provided, but found using Dynamic mode to be way over saturated and blown out.  I also found that using my PS3 and Xbox360 over HDMI would suffer from overscan, which basically takes what the game system is sending it and making the edges of the image be on the outside of the screen creating a zoomed in picture.  HDMI1 is also labeled as DVI and is suppose to disable overscan for use with a computer or console, but I still noticed some overscan going on.  Changing the label of the HDMI ports to PC will disable overscan completely but also disables the use of Dynamic and Movie modes if done to HDMI2.  To change the labels, just open the Menu, navigate to Inputs and then select Edit Names.  Both my systems looks amazing on this tv, I could not be happier.  The settings I use (which are suited to my tastes) are listed below, hopefully it will give someone a base as to where to start.  I keep the brightness low and the backlight up higher to reduce washout and keep black screens from glowing.Mode = StandardBacklight = 16Contrast = 100Brightness = 45Sharpness = 80Advanced SettingsGamma = 0Picture OptionsColor Tone = StandardHDMI Black Level = LowOverall sound quality from the speakers is not bad for what it is, definitely sounds better than alot of other TV's, but I would suggest using a receiver/stereo for audio playback.  It does have an optical audio out and can support Dolby Digital output but not over HDMI. I have read this is due to not being able to decode Dolby over HDMI, so output for SPDIF (optical) is stuck at PCM.  My panel shows no signs of backlight bleed or any fogging/flashlighting from the backlight and 0 dead pixels.  Prior to this unit I had a no name TV that I tried out due to being alot cheaper in price, but unfortunately that was definitely a case of you get what you pay for.

Minimal features.", "Author": "Daniel Oliver", "ReviewID": "R39XLDOBAX07LA", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "Right out of the box, the picture did not impress me at all. After some tweaking and some googling, however, I got it to look pretty good. I'm mostly happy with the picture quality with a couple of caveats: black levels and motion handling.The motion handling is what first jumped out at me. However, I find the longer I have the TV, the less I notice it. Personally, I think it's one of those things you have to look for to really notice on this TV.On the other hand, the poor black levels are definitely noticeable in day-to-day watching. In very dark scenes, the darker areas of the screen can become very blocky and pixelated. Now, I have a suspicion that some of this is caused from my cable box, but I know not all of it is. Unfortunately I don't have a Blu Ray player to confirm either way.I know at least one other reviewer mentioned this, but Samsung outsourced the panel manufacturing on these TVs to different companies. This can result in very different picture quality from one TV to another, and there's really no way to tell which one you have until you get the TV plugged up and go into the factory set up screen. I didn't know this until after buying the TV. If I had, I probably would've looked elsewhere. I looked up my panel, and I believe it's from a Chinese company called AUO. This panel has a very poor viewing angle. You can still see the picture from the side, but it's noticeably washed out, like there's a fog on the screen.A few more annoyances:1. The coaxial audio input on the back of the TV doesn't seem right on my TV. It's just a plastic piece with a hole in it and doesn't really look like any other coax input I've ever seen. I've tried to hook up a set of speakers with different audio cables and I haven't been able to get a really good \"fit\". I'm using 3.5mm/mini-jack, like the manual says, but it still results in a loud buzzing sounds like something isn't connected right. I'm beginning to think it's just a malfunction with my TV, but I just switched to optical audio to bypass the problem.2. If you use external speakers, like a 2.1 system without a receiver, the TV won't control the volume of the external speakers. This is a HUGE oversight on Samsung's part. My 5 year old 32inch Sharp LCD has this feature, I don't understand why a new TV like this wouldn't. This should be a standard on all TVs nowadays.Those two problems don't really affect me, since I have a soundbar and receiver that handles all of the audio, but I know it could be a dealbreaker for a lot of people.Bottom line, I wouldn't buy this TV again because of the lack of features, but I don't dislike it enough to send it back either. The picture quality is very good for the most part, unless it's a really dark scene. Which is good enough for me.UPDATE 6/21/2013: I mentioned the blocky pixelating in darker scenes possibly being caused by my cable box in my earlier review, and I think that was definitely the case. I've recently moved and switched to DirecTV. I don't notice this issue any longer.I have to say as time goes by, I am more satisfied with this TV. Now, that is probably the case with any TV you buy. If you have something long enough, you stop looking for flaws and just enjoy it for what it is. I do find myself admiring the picture quality of this set more and more. The viewing angles are still not great (I have mine in a corner of a narrow-ish room so not really an issue), and darker scenes could be better, but overall I am more happy with this TV now that when I first bought it.

Look at the picture and you will see small distortions in the picture.  I wish I listened to myself.Some models of this TV do not have a full Samsung panel.  I have a panel with the code HS03 (which you can see on the box) which is made by Sharp and is lower in quality than the full Samsung panel.  A previous reviewer read that the HS03 panel had ghosting problems.  This is true.  Please see the previous review, \"Many DON'T HAVE SAMSUNG PANELS - HUGE quality difference\".Screen is reflective and you can see yourself in the TV at some angles.  This is true too.This TV has terrible 480i conversion to 1080p.  Previous reviewer commented that Comcast does not look good on this TV.  This is profoundly true to me.  Watching cable TV I noticed distortions around character's faces, especially the eyes.  Sometimes a face would stick in place for a second or blur.  Sometimes backgrounds had a ripple effect.  People also moved in and out of focus.  All of this lead to making me feel dizzy.  The TV picture does take a lot of tweaking the settings to look good.  However, I see no point to this while watching cable TV.  I must also add picture quality is pixilated while watching cable.  Turning on Samsung's Clear Motion Rate 120 feature did help, but only a little bit. It did not fix the poor picture quality.I did chat with Samsung about all of this.  I performed a in TV diagnostic for them.  My TV displayed a screen of test color bars, which did look OK, but this doesn't diagnose the problems I was having.  Samsung should have a diagnostic that plays a short video for you to truly see what's going on.  The tech support chat host wasn't able to fix my problems.I did chat with a Comcast tech support person.  They re set my cable box.  This didn't help the problem.This TV is boxed up in a filmy package!  The box I got had a hole it in right in front of the TV screen.  There was nothing in between!  On inspection the TV was undamaged.  I think these TV should have more foam packaging inside for protection.

Thank heavens that Amazon has a good return policy!  Amazon arranged for a UPS pickup next day and will be refunding my money.Having said all of this, this TV did look good to me when I played a DVD on a player with 1080p up conversion.  I give credit for that.  However, I feel the model should work well with 480i as well.  I know 480i won't give me a great picture when blown up to 40 inches, but the UN50EH5000 looked unacceptable in this instance.This year I have purchased about three Samsung products.

NOTE: Unless you are planning on buying a BlueRay DVD player, think twice about the 1080 resolution as my DVD player, even though it upscales the 720p native DVD to 1080p, is still not as sharp as if the screen rez were 720p as well....in other words, HDTV is extraordinary and when I get around to replacing my DVD player with a BLUE RAY, all will be sharp as a pinhead!

We received a call back the next day and this person said he couldn't do anything but give us the name of a company that we could BUY the screws from. See the problem was we had owned the TV for approximately 34 days. Samsung would only be responsible for 30 days of customer service. We could not accept this as our problem so my husband called the corporate offices. Surely they would be appalled at such a stupid policy. We then received a call from a person that told my husband right off the bat that he had reached the top of the company and there was no need to try to go further. He said this was Samsungs policy and we would have to purchase the screws even though they forgot to put them in the box. We have a houseful of Samsung TVs. Good price for a fairly good TV. We certainly can pay for the screws which we have done twice, once by the original purchase and again by the company that sells the screws Samsung forgets to put in the box. They must forget screws quite often if they have a go to company. During all this time we were wasting my husband took the Samsung inventory list from the TV and went to 2 hardware stores. The screws pictured had a Samsung number but not a number the hardware store could identify.  We had no choice but to order the screws from the company Samsung uses for their mistakes. We ordered the 8 screws which cost $25.00 with S&H.; The screws we received would have cost us .30 cents each at the hardware store if we had the correct size from what was pictured on the inventory list. The point is how could they not send us screws for the sake of .30 cents each! How could a multi million dollar company put a policy in place that slaps the customer in the face for buying their product. Are they so big, rich and arrogant that a bad review is a joke and means nothing? Also what about customer loyalty and standing by their product. These screws were not uncommon and could be bought out of a hardware store if the measurements were included. Would you believe there is a specific company that makes and sells the screws Samsung forgot to put in the box and some unlucky sap like my husband has to wait to use his TV and pay twenty times the amount of the value of the screws. Our loyalty to Samsung has taken a big hit. I think we will take another look at Sony, Panasonic etc. I 'm sure there is a good TV out there with much better customer service. Oh by the way I can't give a review on the quality of the TV yet because we just got the screws yesterday. I will be back with a fair honest review but I will no longer will be a loyal customer.  So unfortunate.....LCWe did finally get the screws last week and the TV is great after a lot of tweaking.  Samsung does have a great product (5 star) but a -5 star for service and loyalty.  LC  Addendum: I sent this message approximately 1 week ago 2/14/14 to Samsung Executive Customer Service Dept.  Dear Ceo, I thought you may be interested in the following problem my husband went through trying to set up a TV. I''m hoping all my efforts will make some sort of impact. I no longer want to here from all the Samsung peons that do not see the real problem in this very anti-customer service policy. Why do I have to keep jumping thru hoops? Do not think for one moment this is about a refund for screws. Try to envision the ridiculous process a customer has to go thru after spending a pretty substantial amount of money to a company they have repeatedly purchased productsfrom.  This is the response I received: Thank you for contacting Samsung Electronics, Office of the President. Your feedback is very important and we appreciate the opportunity to respond.I apologize you have been frustrated with your recent customer service experience and that the screws for your product were not included. We make every effort to provide our customers with an exceptional experience every time. Please understand the information provided by our customer service division was correct in to which I understand is only part of your frustration. Although this is the case, I can make an exception in this matter and offer to compensate you a portion of the cost. I can offer a $25.00 gift card from Best Buy.I am very sorry for any inconvenience this may have caused you and greatly appreciate the feedback.Please acknowledge your acceptance of this offer by replying to the email.Kind Regards, x  I responded to this offer:  My review regarding Samsung's customer service policy will remain the same but I will address this communication regarding the inability of Samsung's ERMS department to inadequately address the problem. This feeble response to mollify us is so unacceptable. Do you think an explanation of why Samsung feels the customer should be financially responsible for their own company errors would be to much to ask for? Do you feel $25. is enough to cover my time, or the verbally rude responses from the different departments we spoke to at Samsung to try to get the screws, the gas in my car back and forth to the hardware stores, the phone calls, the shipping charges for the super inflated price of the screws. I would like this communication past on to someone who can really compensate us for all our time and effort and most of all our increasing resolve to take this to the highest level we can. Instead of a Best Buy certificate maybe you should contact the department that packs the Samsung products and offer these employees a $25.00 yearly bonus to pay better attention to there jobs. Or maybe I just have the whole concept of this policy all wrong. Does Samsung get a percentage from these mistakes? Is it possible these really are not mistakes? Oh, I must be wrong. Why would a billion dollar company be so petty and need such an insignificant amount of money to add to their coffers? Can't be. It has to be that customer satisfaction and company integrity and loyalty is only for the most profitable end-users. I will use the utmost care to not pass on any employee names as I pass along my communications to various reviewer sites, Facebook, BBB, Consumer reports, Yelp and so on.  This was the end of my message. There may seem to be gaps here and there in all this correspondence but it contained names and addresses that should not be published. Thanks for reading. If I ever get that $25.00 gift certificate I will be donating it to a homeless shelter.

I use it as my PC monitor and with my game consoles.Something to be wary about is that to get this TV to function at its best takes some doing. The menus for adjusting the picture are a bit scattered, but the general picture controls will get your color where you need it to be. Personally, I don't have any of the \"motion lighting\" features on as I don't notice a significant difference beside the screen getting darker. Honestly the screen is probably fine if you're just going to watch TV and aren't picky about the colors being perfect. And if you are, it won't take you too much to get there, just know you'll need to spend some Time adjusting.Now the biggest thing, which actually prompted this review, is that I have also been using this TV for my computer monitor. However, when the HDMI is connected to my PC, I had to scale down the desktop and work in a resolution less than 1080p or my the visuals would get cropped. The screen would also auto adjust contrast as the images changed on screen, which was horrid whenever I would edit images. I figured these were just what I was going to have to deal with using a TV as a monitor, as I did not see an option in the menus to remedy these.Until today.I was flipping through the menus fiddling with setting when I saw \"source list\" near the bottom. This setting in other TVs is usually just to assign names to your inputs for your organization pleasure. I figured since I was there I would label them. Source List->Edit Name. Lo and behold when I set my PC's input to PC/DVI it not only labeled it, but actually changed the way the screen treated the input! The screen no longer auto adjusted contrast, and I didn't need to scale my desktop to fit!I felt silly that it was so simple and I'm sure it's mentioned in the manual someplace, but it is not immediately obvious that this is what the setting does.

I bought this 32\", 5000 Series for my mother. Straight out of the box, it was easy to assemble (TV Stand), with the total setup time taking approximately 15 minutes. Version of this flat screen is TSO1. Based on previous reviews, this has a Samsung Panel and NOT a panel from some other manufacturer.If you have cable through Comcrap or a similar provider, you will disregard the cable setup on screen during the initial setup once your unit is powered up. Cable setup uses a preferred HDMI cable plugged into your High Definition (HD) equipped cable box. Plug one end of the cable to the HDMI input of the cable box, and the other end will connect to the HDMI IN 1 (DVI) jack of your TV. I recommend you hook everything up first, and plug the AC cable to the TV last. Once everything is set, take off all the protective tape and power up the unit. Once it's powered up, you will skip the initial cable setup that appears after selecting your language, date, time, daylight savings time, etc. With the initial setup complete, hit the \"Source\" button on your remote to select HDMI 1 on your TV. With HDMI1/DVI highlighted and selected, hit the \"Tools\" Button on your remote to Edit the Name. Here, you can select Cable STB, which stands for Cable Set Box. Further setup instructions for your HD Cable box (if you didn't have one previously) are supplied by your cable company.I have read some reviews that complained about a \"tingy sound.\" I have not experienced that in the least and also recommend that you turn on the SRS TruSurround HD. I have always enabled this option with other Samsung TV's. You get to this option by pressing the \"Menu\" button on the remote, scroll once to the speaker icon titled \"Sound\", and scroll right to \"SRS TruSurround HD\" and turn \"On\". This option will add a fuller and richer sound.The remote ONLY illuminates as you depress any key, but will not illuminate in motion as compared to some of the higher end Samsung models. If the remote doesn't illuminate as you press keys, press the light bulb icon of the remote once. The button is located in the upper far right position. Once illumination is set, any future use will automatically turn off within approximately 2 seconds after pressing a button. Having to press a key to get the remote to illuminate is a bit of a nuisance because pressing a button just doesn't illuminate the remote; it will also enable whatever feature is associated with that button. I wish Samsung would make the remote on their lower end models illuminate on motion, but it is what it is. The illuminated remote is GREAT for seeing what you're doing while viewing at night. Once you have used the remote enough, you can memorize or pretty much figure out what button you will be pressing. If you have cable, you can program your cable remote to operate the TV and the TV remote is then placed in a drawer and used minimally.I will update this review as the TV is used, but so far, we are very happy with this purchase!", "Date": "January 17, 2013"}, {"Title": "Great Value TV", "Author": "szd -seattle", "ReviewID": "RDXQXIR0KPXNZ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Bought this to be used as a TV in a small room without external speakers or other 'media room' accessories.

There is even a setting to automatically adjust between loud and quieter stations, so that there is no sound-shock (for listeners)...love this.On \"movie\" sound setting, it's like being in a real movie theater, surround-sound!?There are 2 HDMI's and 1 USB on the side, as well as other connectors in the back.The weight is very acceptable, not heavy at all. Putting the stand screws in was a bit tricky, but diagrams were good. I had to tighten screws more than I expected, but it's sturdy. No swivel adjustment, but it's so light that it doesn't matter.The lateral viewing angle, at least for the settings I chose, is not that great. It's supposed to be something like 175 degrees, but it's maybe 45!? It doesn't bother me, but might bother someone sitting at an angle.

I called Samsung online chat and asked, got a nice rep to talk to.To be super-safe and because this is not a cheap tv, I got the 4 yr extended warrantee for a reasonable $69. I carefully put box and packing away in case I need it.Thanks Amazon! I really really enjoy (and use) the reviews, and the unbelieveably fast delivery (2 days). Best Buy had a similar price, but needed more than 1 1/2 weeks to get the same tv to a store where I could pick it up! (explains Best Buy's recent poor performance).Amazon's price IS the lowest online (free delivery...not sure if this is just for prime which I have).Amazon prime is well worth having in any case, especially for someone like me in a rural area with most shopping areas more than an hour away.Recommend this tv without reservation.

The price keeps dropping and because of a sale was identical to prices online.  We weren't sure if a 32\" was going to be adequate (it is) and we wanted an easier exchange option vs. shipping with an online retailer.  We didn't go with an extended warranty.  There's only a  few % chance of something going bad.  There's a good chance that will occur out of the box or within the exchange period, and even if it doesn't if you pay with a credit card your card company likely already (possibly unknown to you) has a 1 year warranty extension (check).- Sound seems adequate. Not cinema quality and some say \"tinny\" but I am losing hearing and I need higher frequencies more anyway.  This model has various audio out options if you need them versus the less costly models, but they aren't ideal.  In particular if you plan on using the home theater audio jack, according to others this has one output volume level which cannot be controlled with the remote and you ideally have to have a home system with it own remote.- The stand is a bit flimsy. I have the screws cranked down tightly but there's still play in the joint. I don't think it is going to fall over though.  The TV does not rotate though it looks like it should.- No cable for us. Rabbit ear antenna reception is okay but I have some weak/no signal messages popping up occasionally for some stations that used to come up steady with no problem on our old TV.  I plan on buying a digital TV style antenna.-  I compared many models and hundreds of reviews before buying. It was really down to this or a Sony 32\".  I don't think the Sony is bad but technical reviewers didn't give it the best score though consumer reviews give it about the same as Samsung.  Generally the Samsung has more control options.  Both have good and bad things and you have to decide which are critical to you.- 720p vs. 1080p  No need for 1080p with a 32\". I couldn't tell the difference in the store until I was about 4 feet from the set.  With no cable, rabbit ears, and only an old DVD player we don't need 1080p.  My reason for going for this set wasn't because I wanted 1080p but because the 720p models don't have other features this one has. The 720p 32\" Samsung models have no sound-out capability other than the built-in speakers which don't receive glowing reports.  This model does have audio outputs (though limited) in addition to probably somewhat better sound than the lower cost models. That may be adequate and we won't need to buy a sound bar or pay to upgrade audio on current our home system (a boombox). Save $100 there.  Samsungs additionally have pretty good media player support (photos, multiple video formats, etc.)  Getting a Samsung save $40 for a separate media player.  In a nutshell, it was cheaper paying a bit more for the 1080p model simply for the other features than saving $50 on 720p model which would require separate support features.- Two HDMI ports is more than enough for us with one DVD player. It would have been nice hiding HDMI on the back since I do not anticipate changing connections all the time and we'll have to see it sticking out the side all the time.  Having the USB port on the side is handy where I do see changing the flash drive frequently.- The manual is printed on a large sheet of paper. I see needing to reference if frequently and it would have been nicer in booklet format. No dealbreaker.- I'd give this 4.5 stars but that isn't an option.

I have the latest/greatest Panasonic plasma (the VT60) in my den. This is my bedroom TV and it replaced an older 720p Toshiba. I'm amazed at the difference. While it can't possibly equal the black levels of the VT60 or its color depth or nuance it's damn good. Razor sharp images, great white levels, excellent flesh tones and good viewing angles (long a pet peeve of mine with LCD/LED's). I want to make particular note of the built-in speakers. Way better than the outgoing Toshiba and much better than the speakers on the VT60. As we all know, sound quality is one area in which flat panels have compromised. Sometimes to the point that the consumer is almost forced to go to an external speaker solution (as I did with the VT60). Not so here. The sound quality is actually well above average and has a resonable amount of bass for such a small system. Is it audiophile quality? Heck no! But it's great for everyday viewing/listening and can even do justice to music with wide dynamic range. While most flat panels give their speakers 2 or 4 watt amplifiers, this has two 10 watt amplifiers built in. This makes a huge difference at moderate (to louder) levels and keeps things sounding clean and non-distorted. For a TV costing well under $500 this unit is incredible. If you want bells and whistles or a smart TV you're going to want to looks elsewhere. If you want a TV that serves as a monitor for your cable/fios feed then this is your answer.BTW for those of you concerned about the \"outsourced panel\" issue let me say that I have the HS03 version (made by Sharp I'm told).

The screen is woefully vulnerable to impact damage with no protection other than a thin layer of cardboard.  Combine this with the apes working at UPS and its a formula for trouble.  If you remember the old American Touristor commercial with a gorilla beating the hell out of a suitcase, you have an idea of what my shipment went through.  Needless to say, the screen was completely hammered.  It looked like someone at UPS drop kicked it.  I returned the damaged unit without replacement.  I didn't wish to play UPS Russian Roulette a second time.  I bought the same item at Sears on sale for about the same price.  Being my own deliveryman, I refrained from kicking the box and the TV made it home intact.  One good note, Amazon's return process was flawless, easy and my credit card was credited with the refund in one day.  My complements to Amazon on this.

I checked a few other retailers, and Amazon's price was by far the best.  Shipment was remarkably fast, too; it arrived in about two days without having selected any special shipping (I picked the standard option of 5-8 days).  Reminded me again just how much I love Amazon.I've only had this TV for one day, so I can't comment on its longevity.  The picture quality is great.  Though other reviews note that picture settings need adjusted, the out-of-the-box settings for me were just fine; however, if you need to adjust, it's easy to do so.  The menu and options are easy to navigate.  Set-up was easy and the sound is good.  Up until now, I had a 37\" then a 42\" in my living room, so I was unsure what a 50\" would look like, but the size is perfect.I LOVE the USB capability to watch videos--it's so convenient to put my home videos of my daughter onto a flash drive instead of having to burn them all to a DVD.  The menu for the USB is super-simple; it lists all the video files so you can select what you want, but then it cycles through them automatically, going to the next when one is finished.  Such an easy way to view home videos, I love it.Had I read the manual, I may have been able to find this out, but the buttons on the actual TV are hard to find!  I ran my hand over the TV, searched the sides, etc., and couldn't find them, to the point I figured there weren't any.  Turns out, it's more like a joystick-esque kind of button.  You put your hand under the TV, right near where the red light is, and there's one big button that you press in various places to navigate to the off switch or to a couple other options.  It's easy, just hard to find if you don't know what you're looking for.In short, I'm just an average TV-watcher.  I don't know anything about picture and sound quality aside from just looking at the screen.  I don't know what the experts look for--I just like watching Netflix movies and my favorite shows.  I'm not hard to please; I still have a huge 90s TV in my computer room, and I watch it with no problems.  On this TV, HD channels look amazing.

I read that the HSxx sets have a Sharp screen in them, not a Samsung one, and it may be slightly inferior.I tried the picture setting listed by other reviews on this set and I could not be happier with the picture produced. It offers rich vivid colors and there is a significant range for adjustment. The only negative I have to share about this TV set is displaying of black. It has a slight ghosting effect. That being said, in this price range you will be hard pressed to find a better set. I am willing to live with this minimal nuisance knowing I did not overextend myself to purchase a significantly more expensive set, just because of this one thing.The audio quality is also on par with higher priced TVs, for those of you who will not venture out and spend money on a separate audio system.There are only 2 HDMI ports on this model. You may only be able to plug in 2 sources at the same time. In my case: HD cable box and a Roku 2 XS streaming player. The ports are on the right side of the set, instead of the back panel so this may be a consideration for some. Cables do not stick out from the side of the TV as they bend back and behind. The TV comes with a small stick-on cable organizer.The USB port is positioned right below the HDMIs and works well with my powered external hard drive and usb thumb/flash drives formatted in FAT and FAT32 (exFAT was not recognized by the set).For the price I paid, I am very happy with the purchase.I opted in for a 4 year warranty through the local retailer just in case. TVs tend to be used long term and I hope the circuits on this set last as long as past Samsung products.While this is not a \"smart\" tv, it comes with a media player (for the USB delivered content) and I have yet to feed it something it has not been able to play.

This is the best TV that we have in the house and we have everything from larger LCD, Plasma and smaller LED.  Before buying this set, I tried a 32\" Phillips and a Vizio which were both sent back because they each had issues.  The Phillips could not see the resolution properly from my Direct TV box and was a real pain to keep resetting the resolution of the Direct TV box.  The Vizio screen was not good and varied in brightness depending upon where you stood and took a long time to start up.  The Samsung starts quickly, reads my direct tv box resolution perfectly and is overall a terrific picture. The audio is surprisingly good as well.  A few things of interest:TV does not have an S Video connector.  It does have a couple of HDMI and Regular component and antenna connections but no S-Video.TV is thicker than the 1\" thin units but is still thinner than the older style units.  Unit is pretty light and easy to handle.The underneath joystick type menu and controls button is a little wierd but I never use it anyway.  Remote is perfect.Motion - this TV handles fast motion like sports extremely well.HD Quality on this set is absolutely outstanding.Remote is nice and small about 6\" long and about 1.5\" wide.  Easy to use button layout.No angle adjustment on the stand.  Stand attaches easily with a few screws and can be removed for wall mounting.Menu functions allow for a lot of control and adjustments.Overall this is a very good television.  I use it off of a direct tv box and as a back-up with an over the air antenna.

The new one was 14 pounds vs. 28 for the older model.  Mounting was easy, and it was very quick to hook up and adjust.  We are on both an antenna, and satellite (Direct TV.)  Scanning the available channels took the normal amount of time, and it did a good job of selecting all those we had had before, plus maybe a couple others.It did require some adjustment as others have noted.  Adjustments were easy, but I have had experience with two other Samsung flat screens.  I did use some of the setting numbers posted here as starting points.  I will not include what I ended up with as these things are personal preferences, and room lighting will always make a difference.  I was close to what several others used.I would say that this new TV isn't quite as good when viewed from an angle as the older model.  This isn't a problem with us as it is rare that someone is in both the kitchen and dining room.  The swivel takes care of that.  The sound is perhaps a tad bit better, and the volume control is a little more precise.  One problem we were never able to solve with the older set was sound dropping out when something on the same circuit was turned off.  The refrigerator door closing always caused a two-second pause in the sound.  Not any more!  It also seems to have a slightly more sensitive receiver for off-the-air signals.  I do not notice any motion blur that some see as a problem.Picture quality is better, but not up to the larger Samsung in the family room.  Also, it doesn't have the \"ghosting\" problem when the screen fades to black as did the earlier 32\" set.  Contrast is obviously better.  I do like the \"joy stick\" control for those times when the remote decides to hide from me.  What we really need is a remote to turn on the beeper on the remote...All in all, a nice upgrade compared to the 720 pixel device it replaced.

I read reviews until my eyes bled.  I settled on Samsung after seeing too many repeat issues of \"died after 2 weeks\" on a few other popular brands.  All I can say after 5 weeks is that I am underwhelmed with this particular model.I did my shopping in several stores and compared TV's side-by-side.  I kept thinking \"well, the picture on the Samsung isn't as good as the (Sony, Vizio, LG, etc), but if the quality and reliability is better, I won't notice the picture so much when it's in my living room and I don't have another TV right next to it\".  Wrong...  Every single day I am considering returning it and trading for a better picture.  Thanks to some other smart techie reviewers, I discovered that there are different panels in some of the same model TV's so maybe I got the low-end, I don't know.  I researched online about fine-tuning (\"calibrating\") your own TV, and with a little time investment of about 3 hours of research and fiddling around, I did see a very small improvement.  And I know that I can pay ANOTHER $300 for a trained person to come in and do a 'professional' calibration for me, but for $300 more up front, I could've bought a better TV in the first place!Specifically, my picture is not crisp, maybe even a little cloudy/milky.  I don't notice any dead spots - it's just blah all over.  HD tv channels do appear better than non-HD, but even then it's not impressive.  The sound volume is pretty good, and when I play a Blue-Ray disc through it, it sounds amazing.  Non-Blue-Ray sound is just like an old 19\" TV from 20 years ago.  When I put a disc or DVR show on pause, there is a very noticeable humming/low-freq buzz sound that seems to just leak out of the TV speakers (that's from two different inputs, so it's probably not a feed problem).  The menu is a pretty good for picture control, and lousy for sound.  (And one feature I liked on my old TV from 1999 that this one doesn't have is subtitles, esp when the TV is muted.  Wish that was a standard by now.)My whole point is that this TV is not what I expected; it's not terrible but for anyone else wanting to be \"Wow'ed\" right out of the box, this may not be the right one for you either.  I chose to buy a TV with a worse picture that will last me a longer time, rather than a better picture which will die sooner.

I noticed on my set that there were large bright spots or \"clouds\" all over my screen! Also in the corners there are bright blooming artifacts that are so annoying at night time!!!

ANY new, modern TV should have at least 3 HDMI inputs (cable / sat, PS3 / Xbox360 / Bluray)...HELLO!!!My 6 year old Westinghouse 27 inch LCD died. Off to Paul's TV (not recommended due to restock fee of 15%), bought this Samsung UN40EH5000 40-Inch 1080p 60Hz LED HDTV. YAY!!I need more HDMI and other inputs too. I'm using Uverse connected to 1 HDMI input (they claim to broadcast HD in 1080p). I connected my WD Media player into the other HDMI input.Since my old xbox360 is component, and my Wii is composite, I'm stuck with only one of those to be connected at one time. My bluray player cannot be connected either, since I've used both HDMI inputs. And..lastly, my Laser disk (yes indeed, still have it) cannot be connected for it's component or composite needs. And..that VHS / DVD combo..composite and or Super Video!!! *sigh* I had all these connections on my cheesy Westinghouse LCD.The smaller the TV, the better it looks...mostly. Comparing this 40 inch to my old 27 inch may not be a fair comparison, even though its...720p vs 1080p / 6 year old technology vs 2012 / LCD vs LED, 1000 contrast ratio vs 3.5 million contrast ratio!The WD player's 1080p and 720p files look great on this TV (still, the \"flatness\" seems evident), but the \"motion blurriness\" seen with the Uverse cable seems non existent when playing the media files. Even the bluray movie playing as a demo at the store (Megamind) looked a bit flat, but non blurred when fast motion was playing. I thought it was just the environment / lack of video tweaking but low and behold, it seems not for the flatness aspect.PROS:Less current draw, less heat output than the older LCD TVs.Remote has a light for it's buttons.Remote can control my computer's Samsung Syncmaster 2333HD display (but is a battle for me, when I DON'T want that TV on!!)Speakers are way better (sound is better) than I thought it would be, has 5 band EQ for manually tweaking sound too.Optical output for audio.BLACK is VERY BLACK, White is very white. LOTS of settings to choose from, though it seems many are subtle on what your seeing when tweaked.Has coaxial input for antenna.Claims to be able to play various video formats (avi, mkv) from a USB memory stick only (non USB Hard drive compatible).TV is light enough to carry from room to room if needed. Seems to weigh less than my old 27 inch LCD.CONS:Picture color seems flat, compared to my cheesy old LCD TV or my Syncmaster 2333HD, with \"out of box\" settings. Tweaking them did help, but I'm still trying to get \"brighter\" color from this TV.When viewing from a slight angle, not directly in front of TV, fast motion seems blurred a bit (I see less of that when viewing directly from the front). Never had that with my cheesy 27inch Westinghouse LCD. Still shots or slow moving movies, the picture does look great, but still not as bright as I'd seen other TVs produce. I even enabled the LED Motion (or whatever it's called, for just that purpose, fast motion flix to help blurring).NOT NEAR ENOUGH INPUTS. Only has 2 HDMI, 1 shared composite / component (the Y input of the component inputs doubles as the composite input = LAME). No more Wii for Mee.Has analog audio output but not too sure if I can control it's volume..yet (other review states cannot do so with the 32 inch version of this TV).No PC (VGA) or DVI Input.Has USB input but does not support Hard Drives, only thumb drives / flash drives.Conclusion:For 677 USD, too pricy for too little. This baby should be 500 to 550 tops (only based on other TVs pricing for what's offered). A good HDMI splitter can cost 150 USD easy (I have a 40 dollar special) and it can cause \"special\" anomalies too!Look around before purchasing this TV. Ensure that you can return it if desired, for at least a test run at your home.Even if tweaked properly to get brighter picture, I'm still in a holding pattern for the motion blur and lack of inputs, but I'm probably going to return it, take a 15 percent restock hit and go with the Panasonic TC-L42E50 or ET5. Lots of inputs on that E50 and great picture (when I saw it last year in a store).*** *** *** *** UPDATED FEEDBACK:I changed the HDMI cable I was originally using (was a monster cable, gold contacts, 12 foot - paid around 70.00 for this 5 years ago). The new HDMI cable I used was a no name brand, gold contact 3D ready (1440p rather than the usual 1080p) and was only 15.00 USD!This made a huge difference in the video quality. More deeper colors, much less distortion (blocky) screen when fast moving video was playing (although it was still present) but not too disturbing or much of a let down.On a budget, get this TV. It does look great. Lack of inputs can be combated with the 135.00 splitter, which you could get later. The motion blurriness I've seen is minimal.Unfortunately , I still cannot raise the rating to 4 or 5 due to the lack of inputs. This is a HUGE issue for me. Amazon does have a $135.00 various input splitter device (2 composite, 2 component, 3 HDMI that's 3D ready, and 1 VGA) all can output to 1 HDMI (it's called the ViewHD Multi-functional HDMI Converter Switch). People are rating it very good too. With the cost of this TV at near 680.00 plus the 135.00 for the splitter, your near 800.00 USD. Might as well shell the extra 50 to 100 for a TV that would most likely - possibly, hopefully - have the inputs you require , a higher Hz refresh rate and possibly 3D too. Just watch the \"combo composite / component\" input thing. Many new TV's do this now (sharing the composite input with the component, even that Panasonic TC-L42E50 / ET5 I was going to get has that combo input. *sigh*I ended up returning my EH5000 (no 15% restock fee due to less than 10 days!), for a Samsung UN46ES7500FXZA (yes, at 1800.00 lots more $$$, but lots more TV too).

This particular model provides enough control that you should be able to get an acceptable image. It also has three modes to allow for changes in viewing conditions.

I am using an antenna with the stations being  from 20 to 70 miles away.  I had to custom mount the TV in an \"entertainment center\" so that the front edge of the TV is in front of the front of the center...stand is screwed down at the back of the pedestal.

Still adjusting the picture...I'd recommend just messing around till you get something you can live with...since I have a variety of DPI signals...400s up to 1080...it's a compromise.

Since this would primarily be used for console gaming, the 60Hz would be more than plenty.

I did not have trouble lifting it but it's a bit wide. They suggest two people but you really can lift it with one if you are careful.It comes with plastic protection on the black bezel but NONE on the screen. I kept telling a friend who was helping me install it NOT to put it face down and was told, in a superior tone that I was being silly but I had noticed there was no peel-off membrane on the glass.The instructions are minimal and consist of two sheets: one to screw together the stand (a matter of 8 screws, four in the base and four to attach the base to the screen back. This is best done face down with something protecting the glass, ie a blanket or the plastic foam.)Set-up: took about five minutes on plug-n-play. Seeks channels from cable or air; we have Verizon FIOS and it works fine with Verizon. However, my FIOS remote needs reprogramming to use one rather than both (TV and FIOS) so that would take longer than five minutes.HDMI: No HDMI cable is included. I happened to have one, so I installed it to the FIOS box. I have to switch it out, or use a second HDMI in the HDMI-2 slot for the Roku.The manual is a thin, folded sheet of paper. Text is a bit small. I prefer PDF manuals anyway, but this is very minimal. Turned out to be all I needed, however.PICTUREThe picture is bright, in fact, on \"movie\" setting I find it too bright, even in a dim room. (you get standard, movie and dynamic, which adjusts to the light in the room)The picture is clear and not fogged, as in a cheap little digital TV we got at Big Lots. Definitely looks good.Sound: acceptable. For better sound, you'd use a surround-sound or home theater type speaker system.SUMMARYFor a \"price that came in under three bills or available from other sellers at a similar price (three and change if you go for the Square Trade warranty) it's great. I'm totally happy. It's easy to use. It was easy on the pocketbook.In a small den, 32\" is large enough for comfortable viewing. If your room is large you may want to go up to at least a 40\" or best, a 50\". The main TV.

So when I finally decided to upgrade the master bedroom TV another Samsung was the clear choice.Importantly, the picture is magnificent on the Samsung UN32EH5000 32-Inch 1080p 60Hz LED HDTV. Right out of the box the default settings needed no adjustment. I'm sure over time I will indeed play around with some of the settings, but for the simple purposes of connecting just cable TV using an HDMI connection the TV was basically plug and play.The TV comes with a stand that requires very simple assembly:  First you connect the base of the stand to the mount of the stand with 4 screws; then you connect the assembled stand to the TV with the turn of 4 screws; and that is the only real \"work\" that you'll have to do to get the set up.I was curious as to whether the LCD picture on my new 32-inch would be as vivid and defining as my 50-inch plasma. I guess since I've always had a plasma TV I've convinced myself that there is nothing better. But I'm not gonna lie...the argument for plasma versus LCD (in my mind) has weakened significantly at least as far as cable TV goes. I am just as impressed with the high-def that is served by the 32-inch LCD as I am with the 50-inch plasma that I've gotten used to over the years. The highest definition that my cable company (Cablevision) is broadcasting is 1080i, so I can't make any comparisons to the brilliant 1080p picture quality that I get from Blu Ray on the 50-inch.You can set the 32-inch Samsung's picture to Standard (for a TV placed in a normal environment), Movie (for dark rooms) or Dynamic (for bright rooms). This is the one settings that you'll definitely want to pay attention to and try before you become complacent with the default setting.There are (several) other settings that the factory has pre-set that all look (and sound) great, but you're free to manually adjust just about everything to your own liking. There is an equalizer in the audio settings that you should also adjust to your preference, but to an untrained ear you may never \"need\" to do anything as far as the sound settings go.If I had to dig--and I mean really dig--for a complaint, it might be that the stand mounts the TV about an inch too low in order to be able to place my cable box on the same shelf as the TV underneath the screen. However, this is a personal thing, because if you're trying to fit the TV into a specific space that only a 32-inch TV will fit into you'll want to know that the exact height of the TV with stand is 19 1/2\" and the width is 29\". So plan your space for the TV and its accessories accordingly.I am really stoked about my new Samsung 32-inch 1080p LED TV.

After lots of google searching, the best advice I could find was that the cost of fixing it would be close to the cost of replacing it, because the fault was in the wire leads coming from the LCD panel. So I ended up just leaving the TV turned on all day every day, so that when I wanted to watch it, it wouldn't mess up. Imagine leaving your tv on non-stop for six months. Eventually it's time to do something about it.I've always been a fan of LG, but when I read about how common my problem was, and how prohibitive a fix would be, I started to think that maybe I don't need to buy another tv from them.Meanwhile, I live in immediately downtown in a major city, and that means tv signals are bouncing around buildings and doing all sorts of strange things. In other words, tuning in a broadcast channel can at times be far more difficult than seems reasonable. The LG wasn't bad, but occasionally I would have to fuss with the antenna. Meanwhile, my roommate's little Samsung always got a great picture and the antenna never needed to be adjusted. So I decided to try Samsung for my replacement.You wouldn't think the TV itself would have anything to do with the signal, but it does. Samsung TVs have superior tuners. My channels are more clear, and I never have to mess with the antenna any more. I'm sure the other manufacturers are cheaping out on the assumption that everyone has cable or satellite or whatever, but if you're going to make a television, it should be good at being a television, and I sure am glad that Samsung puts that quality tuner in their TVs.There are now three Samsung televisions in my apartment, and I just bought one for my dad.

Great buy for the $$$", "Author": "Mr. & Mrs. Kramer", "ReviewID": "R34PBVV1GE08QW", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This review is about how this tv works as a computer monitor. If your not going to use it as a computer monitor, then this review will not be relevant to you. This review is about what the other reviews don't tell you as far as a monitor goes. So I will not repeat what the other reviews do say. The other reviews do tell you the part I'm not going to tell you. So to learn more about this tv, be sure to read the other reviews also.I wanted a new super large computer monitor and since tv's were now up to 1920x1080, I thought a good one might work ok as a large monitor. So I researched long and hard and settled on this one because of its high resolution and reputation for great clarity and fantastic picture quality.I went ahead and bought this tv for use as a computer monitor nearly exclusively. It works fantastic. Its much much better than my two Dell monitors that came with my computers. Be sure you understand what HDMI is and that your computer can output to HDMI. This tv does NOT have the old standard VGA or SVGA. So I had to buy a adapter Plugable UGA-165 USB 2.0 to VGA/DVI/HDMI Adapter for Windows, Multiple Monitors up to 1920x1080 / 1600x1200 Each (DisplayLink DL-165 Chipset). It worked very well for me.The tv does NOT come set up to work as a monitor right out of the box. But it is so adjustable it can be tweaked to work perfectly as a monitor. It took me a hour of non stop fiddling and adjusting to find the sweet spot that worked oh so well for me. But once you finally find the sweet spot, it works fantastic. Until you find the sweet spot, you wont be impressed but nor disappointed.I use it sometimes up to 12 hours a day as a monitor and it does not tire out my eyes or bother me. Its actually better than the real computer monitors. Well, at least compared to my Dells. Its much brighter if you want it to be, or as dim as you want to set it at. The colors are more vivid and realistic. The lines and text are crystal clear if you sit more than 30\" from it. If your closer than 24\" the text has a very minor blur that can be noticed but does not annoy you too much.For the best picture be sure to set your computer at 1920x1080 and nothing lower. Everything else you adjust from the tv side with the remote control.The two biggest improvements this tv has over a normal monitor (not counting the huge size at a bargain price) is black and white. I dont mean looking at things in black and white, I mean the specific colors of being white and the color of black.What was black on my old dell monitor, now sometimes shows up as very dark grays with tons more detail visible. If it was super dark gray, my old monitor just showed it as black as it smudged out the real available detail. Now I can see what I used to miss.And white. What I used to call white on my old monitor, was a yellow type of white. Not true white. This tv shows true white if you turn its brightness up high enough. I actually cant use all the brightness this tv has available. For two reasons. 100% bright makes the fine delicate lines and text begin to fade away until they are hard to see or nearly invisible if they are real fine. And the biggest reason. When I look at this tv in the dark with no other lights on, the tv is just too bright at 100% and bothers my eyes and blinds me. Its like looking into a flashlight.  So for me 85% brightness gives me true white without blinding me nor making the fine delicate lines begin to fade.On all of my previous computer monitors I always had the brightness turned all the way up and it still was not enough. Its so good that this tv actually has brightness left over that I don't need. That is really saying something.Once you buy this tv, your likely to still own your original computer monitor. Now you can use two monitors at the same time on your computer since you will now have two. One VGA and one HDMI.I was so surprised to see them both perform side by side simultaneously. OMG, I had no idea how lacking my old monitor was until it was compared with this tv. This tv is so superior as a monitor that I feel samsung is missing their branding call. They should be selling and advertising this thing as a computer monitor. There is so much market they are missing.1 not only is the size fantastic and incredible for the price when compared to real monitor prices,but 2, its performance surpasses normal monitors and maybe the best super high dollar monitors can equal it that cost over a grand, but its just so much value as a monitor for such a bargain price.But its not a monitor out of the box. Its only a fantastic monitor when you tweak it to perform just so and find the sweet spot, which fortunately is available to be found if you look, search, fiddle and experiment enough. Sissy's wont find it because they quit too easily. Maybe thats why samsung doesn't advertise this as a monitor because lots of idiots wont figure out how to tweak it to perfection. That I do believe.Here is why I wont tell you what numbers and settings to tweak it to. Because I tweaked it to perfection with my 1st computer. Later I bought a newer computer and then the monitor sucked. I had to re-tweak it to perfection again with the different computer. And again I found the perfection or sweet spot. So now I have NO reason to believe what settings are perfect for one computer, are even good for another computer.On my 1st computer I had to have the sharpness setting turned way down. But on my next computer I had to turn my sharpness up to 65. That surprised me much. And other settings where quite similar in their dissimilarity between the two computers. That is one thing samsung did fantastically on this tv, they made it so broadly adjustable in every area.I dont use this as a tv at all. However I do watch tons of video from my computer. I discovered I had to discover the sweet spot of compromise. I can tweak this to perfection for watching computer video, but then using it as a desktop or browser suffers much. I can tweak this to perfection as a desktop or browser, but then it suffers much in the video category.So I discovered I have to tweak it to 85% of perfection in the video category so my desktop and browser can be 90% up to their best. I had to find that little spot of compromise so they both look fantastically good, but neither one is at its best. And then they both work fantastically for me and I'm delighted with my level of minor compromise as neither end is suffering much. The compromise is actually very very little. But without it one end or the other suffers quite much while the other end is just a little bit better than if there was no compromise.So be very ready to play with it tons as you learn how to tweak it and then discover the other variables. If your not a quick learner then maybe this tv is not going to work fantastically as a monitor for you.Whereas I didn't tell you what numbers to set to, I believe I have steered you in the right direction so you now know what to go looking for and pay attention to. When I pulled mine out of the box and plugged it in, for an hour I was scared I just threw away a bunch of money as its performance was sub par. But desperation drove me to continue searching for the right settings to rescue me and I found them with perseverance and due diligence.There are a lot of tv's nowadays that have 1920x1080. HOWEVER nearly none of them except this samsung have the adjustably to tweak it to perfection as a monitor. If you buy anything cheaper than this one for monitor use, be ready to be disappointed as you cant adjust it to your liking. BEWARE, I WARNED YOU.This tv is everything I wished and hoped for in a computer monitor. But it wasn't the lowest priced tv out there. HOWEVER I believe it works better as a monitor than any other tv out there.If you have questions post a comment and I will get back to you shortly.Good luck and let me know if this review helped you.

I have a different model, purchased four years ago, in my bedroom which I am quite pleased with. I wanted to get a Samsung for my living room and this model had many good reviews and during Black Friday the price dropped $50 and it became even more appealing. I received it last week. My friend set it up, that was easy. We both looked at the picture and it was exceptional. I was very happy. I left the room and came back later and sat to admire my lovely Samsung. It was then I noticed something very disturbing. In addition to the picture I could view a reflection of the room, windows, mirror, lights etc. It was disturbing and completely distracting. I have never experienced this with my other Samsung or other TVs. I am not sure if this relates to the review someone posted, Many don't have Samsung panels a huge quality difference. In any event there was no way I could enjoy what would have been a great picture when I had to view every other detail in my room at the same time. I cannot imagine who would not find that a complete distraction. I immediately decided it had to go back. I called Amazon and as always, pleased to help, they arranged to have the TV picked up and returned at no cost.I still wanted a Samsung and also wanted to know why the screen was  \"glossy\" a description they used when I finally managed to talk to someone. I was amazed it existed. That was followed by more calls to them. I was trying to find a model without a glossy screen, no reflection or glare. They were not helpful but I finally managed to speak to someone who was not sure but thought model LN40E550F7FXZA, might be glare free. It was the same size and approximate cost of the one I returned. After endless other phone calls, trying to confirm this with no success I finally found Best Buy had the TV. They have a Geek squad and I spoke to someone there. He clearly was informed and said the screen was glare free. I asked him how could anyone enjoy the picture if the room was reflected. He said there were many complaints about this but Samsung was selling the glossy screen and the model I called about appeared to be the only one without that horrible feature, at least in a 40\" screen. I rushed to the store to see it. There was no glare and the picture was quite good, I purchased it. I noticed all of the other Samsung TV's on display had horrible glossy screens and for that matter, so did other brands.I am perplexed having not seen another review like this. Had I, I would never have bought that model. I can only assume the distraction did not bother other people. Nevertheless I had to write this review to warn anyone who may find this feature disturbing as I did. I am very pleased with model LN40E550F7FXZA. I hope this review helps someone.

This combination works great. I've hooked up a Mohu Leaf (to pull in the local HD channels in Chicago), and use Netflix to fill in our other needs.The picture is quite good on antenna and HDMI. Several picture presets to choose from (which can be adjusted to suite your needs). Movie mode was the closest to my needs, then I adjusted for a couple days to dial it in for my tastes and environment.The speakers are quite good as well. I had anticipated needing a sound  bar for any LCD TV I bought, but the built-in speakers have a pretty good range (lows to highs) and the volume can get pretty loud without any distortion. Again, several presets to choose from or you can custom EQ it with the offered basic settings. Suffice to say, a sound bar purchase has been put on the back burner.2 quibbles: I had tried some of the offered picture settings featured in the top reviews. For whatever reason, they don't produce good pictures on the current editions of this model. I keep the sharpness as low as possible (sitting at 15-20), otherwise I get a ghosting effect on a white background.The other quibble is related to a white background as well (and is an often remarked criticism of LCD technology), and that is shaded corners. If my TV were worse, I'd probably send it back, but as it is (on bright white backgrounds) it only appears as a super soft vignette. It is not noticeable 95% of the time I'm watching TV and I probably would have never noticed if I wasn't looking for it.All-in-all, this TV offers really good picture quality and sound for the money.", "Date": "January 18, 2014"}, {"Title": "Would recommend!", "Author": "J.

There are only 2 HDMI ports and 1 Component/AV hookup on the TV.  Granted, there is a usb port, which is nice for putting movies on a USB stick and plugging it in (which works great), but the combined Component/AV hookup is slightly annoying.

I did a lot of research and went to many retail stores and i couldn't find a TV in this size that had not only a great picture but great sound at this price. I think what amazes me the most about this TV is there is no backlight bleed whatsoever. Unlike a lot of TV's especially in this price range where you see backlight bleeding, this TV has none! I kid you not.It doesn't have internet tv capability, but I use my Xbox 360 anyhow for that stuff. So that doesn't bother me in the least bit. You can always buy an internet TV box for it though if you don't have a  gaming console or any other media device.It doesn't have 3D capability built in, but since the TV meets the requirements of viewing 3D content anyhow, I can always buy a 3D converter box for it.If i can find one con with this tv it's the fact that you only get 2 HDMI ports instead of 3 like with many TV's in this price range, but honestly if that's the only con I can find with this TV then I can def live with it. I mean If i need more HDMI ports I can always buy an HDMI spilter.

I also have a 50 plasma to compare to.  The plasma is truly a beautiful picture, in all cases/channels.  I was watching all the NYC local news on hd Fios, all the big name stations have live news with beautiful studios.  Each station was different, and all not pleasing.  I spent a lot of time adjusting the picture, they offer lots of ways to change it, but it would only look good for 1 or 2, not all stations.  (my other looked great for ALL).  The faces of people were washed out and lost the natural look, and colors varied.  Again I am comparing to 2 other hd tv's that people look great on all the channels.  As a footnote, I sent it back, replaced with a 32 inch LG 32LN5300 that was on sale, in a store so I can SEE IT first.  The picture is great on that, without playing with settings, so it's not me.

Picked this up to do the duty in the bed room and had very little expectations from it. For a couple of hours of movie viewing at weekend or checking the news at night, wanted to spend as less as possible. Well Amazon to the rescue. After carefully lining up all the LG possible starters and a Toshiba TV found this gen for about $342 - that's correct for a 40 incher.Out of the box the TV had colors that need a lot of toning down. My LG had isf calibration and a THX mode I had unlocked which gave brilliant output but the only complain was a clouding with a black picture (that has detoriated a bit over the last 2 years - thanks to the IPS panels that LG used). The Samsung has no complaints till date - a S-PVA panel and after checking foe the UD04 version and system menu \"40A6AF1D\", which meant the higher end panel from Samsung.The right settings and pairing it with the Yamaha (YS101BL) the setup was amazing and just right for a bedroom.The sound from the TV is also decently acceptable but a soundbar does wonders.Biggest compliant was with Amazon shipping and packaging by both Amazon and Samsung. 4 blocks of styrofoam holds the TV in place in a thin cardboard package which was crushed and after taking delivery realizing it being sogging wet. Mid-west's amazing run of bad weather delayed prime shipment by a day and UPS ensured that even with a thin layer of plastic around the TV (courtesy Amazon I believe), the outer box was damaged. Had a word with Amazon CC (who are usually amazingly great) and cited my case. Though the TV is working for the last 3 days (put around 6 hrs) , I was concerned and insisted either sending it in for a replacement or getting a price match with Best Buy (Schaumburg) which had the same TV in store for a discounted 299 USD (only 1 item non open box). Amazon CC decided to give me 25 USD credit for my problems but all i got was a 5 USD promotion credit for my troubles. Come on Amazon you can do better than this.Will update on performance on the TV within a week or so.

Hartman", "ReviewID": "R1CCUUBG3MZS0M", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "My wife hates television. Not just the content, but the actual device. Purchasing this television took years of lobbying and legislative effort. But like all landmark decisions, this was worth the wait.My only reservation was buying a television via the internets. During an afternoon of research, I discovered that this television had a great reputation. At least according to the reviews on this fine site. Maybe Costco carries this model, but I'm too cheap to pay for a membership. Also, I don't need 32 blueberry muffins that could house a large Hobbit family.My greatest concern was the transport. Would the television arrive in pieces? Would UPS employees play Dance, Dance Revolution on the box out of sheer boredom? Fortunately, none of this was an issue.The packaging was fine. And it comes with all of these tiny, cardboard Chinese throwing stars. I didn't throw them away because they'll make excellent firestarters come winter.Setting up the television was easy as well. I agree with other reviewers about ease of setup. A word of caution, however. I panicked when Youtube didn't appear on my menu screen.This pissed me off. The whole reason I bought this television is because I wanted to exercise my God-given right to be unproductive and spend large swaths of time watching people walk into sliding glass doors and also come to the realization that Russians are terrible drivers with no regard for pedestrian safety. But not to worry. Your television isn't broken. It just needs a software update. Problem solved.Other reviewers also pointed out that the resolution needed some tweaking out of the box. Personally, I thought everything looked great, but I made some adjustments and the picture quality is amazing.And the best part is that my wife saw Game of Thrones on this beauty and she's much more willing to pull up seat beside me now.May this television bless you and keep you.

It fits perfectly into a unit designed for a 27 inch standard (CRT) television.The picture is phenomenal on this set...by far one of the brightest and clearest pictures I have seen among LED tvs. The menu and remote are easy to use, and setup was simple. I use it for my DVD player and my Roku, along with digital off the air signals.  All inputs produce a nice picture.Sound is good for a smaller TV, although if you are a movie buff, you might want to consider a sound bar or a connection to an external amplifier and speakers. I use a small T-amp (bought here on Amazon) and a set of bookshelf speakers and then the sound is very nice. Note: the 3.5 mm audio out jack on the back of the TV isn't made for headphones...it is a line out jack, just like you would have on a stereo component. One inexpensive option instead of a soundbar or amp, would be to get a set of decent computer speakers with a sub. They should plug right in, and work fine, albeit, you would have to occasionally get up and adjust the volume. One of the very few shortcomings with this set.It also has a USB port and media player built right in for playing your own movies and music. I have an SD card and card reader plugged in there with a large portion of my mp3 library. It works well and plays well, but has no extra frills.Overall, I am very pleased with my purchase. The set is basic, and smaller, but that is exactly what I was looking for. It is perfect for a smaller room, has a great picture, decent sound, and enough features to make it fun and useful.

After hours of research, looking for a 1080p TV under $500 with the best possible input delay and reviews, I settled on the Samsung UN40EH5000. The input delay (according to various websites) is probably the best for its size and price. I use this TV with my Playstation 4 and there is absolutely no noticeable delay. 1080p is pretty self explanatory, and the 60hz refresh rate is fine (though it comes with clear motion 120hz or whatever, but I don't use it). I don't use this TV to watch cable, but - as I said - it is perfect for gaming. Even without tinkering with the picture settings, the image was great.Now when I say the UN40EH5000's picture is great, I don't mean 10/10 perfect. Obviously those 4k UHD TV's will destroy this one. I really recommend viewing this TV in person because I don't know if I can give an accurate depiction of the picture quality. I will say this, though: I have absolutely no complaints. Before purchasing this set, I was hearing that LED TV's have terrible blacks that look more blue and green than black. People were telling me to get a plasma instead, but I went for the LED anyway. The blacks are black. I really can't say much more than that. No blue, no green, just black.Now about the panel lottery: much of those hours of research was spent on finding the truth behind the \"panel lottery\" where Samsung apparently doesn't use Samsung panels in all of its TV's. As one of the other reviewers said, the ts0x and th0x models were the ones with Samsung panels. Unfortunately, this information is a bit dated and I found myself at Best Buy with the option of buying the last UN40EH5000 with an unknown model number. The sticker had been torn off and it was a bit of a gamble to take it home, but I did. It turns out the model number is pf0x or something like that, and, upon further research, it was a Samsung. So I can't really comment on the other models, but the one I got (pf0x?) is a Samsung.The picture and sound quality (surprisingly good) are more than enough for this TV to earn a 5 star rating, but there are a few more extras that make it even better.The TV comes with 2 HDMI ports - one more than I need. A lot of TVs come with 2 or even more, but it's still a nice extra.It should be noted that each and every input gets its own video and sound settings. The settings you save for TV don't have to be the same for HDMI1, HDMI2, Component, etc. This comes in handy because some settings are optimal for some uses but not others.The USB port was a nice surprise. Without knowing how to use it, I plugged in a FAT-32 formatted mini-usb with a couple TV show episodes on it into the port. After pressing the media player button on the remote, the TV took me to the media player where I could play videos, listen to music, or view pictures. From what I've heard, many have had trouble using similar media features on their TV's, so I was surprised when everything worked so easily for me.If that was too long for you people, here's a summary.Great pictureGreat soundGreat for gamingEasy to useNice extrasHere are my settings for anyone interested.

The TV has an amazing picture, and although I wish it was a little bigger in size, I could not afford a larger one. However for the price this Samsung is definitely worth it. I was able to take it out of the box, easily attach the base, plug it in, and watch TV! Honestly figuring out Frontier's cable box was more of a hassle than the TV. I use this TV to watch mostly crappy cable shows and play on my Wii. I don't notice the lower refresh rate being an issue at all.Overall, I would definitely recommend this to someone in a similar situation to myself.

So even though I had my money and was ready to spend it with them, all I got from them were excuses and misdirection.My family and I still wanted a new flat screen TV. We went to Walmart.com and tried to see what else we could get for the money. That is when we saw the Samsung 50 inch. However, I was not real keen on giving my money to Walmart so I checked Amazon and bam they had it and after all was said and done I even spent a little less going with Amazon over Failmart...er Walmart.The TV is beautiful. Crisp picture, surprisingly good and rich sound for a flat panel TV. There is a strong ease of use on the main menu for coaxing the best possible picture for movies, TV  and video gaming.

I have been thoroughly impressed with it so far. In my opinion 32 inches is the perfect size for a tv. I use mine for watching movies and playing xbox. The tv can most definitely handle gaming, I mostly play Halo 4, Call of Duty and Battlefield 3. The tv handles all of them with no problem doesn't stutter or miss a beat. For any gamers who play Battlefield 3, you know that it can get kind of hectic at times but not with this set. Its so easy when sniping, no more having to squint when I wanna find someone. Some of that may have to do with my vision as well. As for movies,everything looks fantastic everything is very crisp and rich. The black levels on this tv are insane, if whatever you're watching or playing goes to a black screen it goes completely black. I usually play and watch movies in the dark so it would happen alot. I actually had to tweak the settings so that I could see when that happens. As for the media hub its sub-par at best. It doesn't really impress me that much and I don't use it tat much anyway since I have my xbox. All around this tv is awesome, definitely a winner in my book. At the time of my purchasing I got it for $334, which is an insane deal.", "Date": "January 10, 2013"}, {"Title": "Typical great Samsung quality!", "Author": "BAH", "ReviewID": "R1X0669VB2YKZI", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I have always been a fan of Samsung televisions. I am not a fan of all Samsung products but I have been so impressed with their televisions that my family members and I have purchased 7 Samsung televisions in the last 3 years. All working great and looking great. I originally wanted a 32\" led with 120hz but at the 32\" size, I figured it probably isn't necessary. I purchased this television and luckily it was the TS01 panel. I am using cablevision and the HD picture quality is really beautiful. There isn't any need to pay more for 120hz as the 60hz works perfectly fine as there isn't any blurriness with fast moving objects with my sports, movies or video games. Sound? Very happy with the sound as it is rich, clear and has some nice bass especially for a smaller TV. I highly recommend that you keep the SRS TruSurround HD \"ON\" as it makes it much better. Features? It doesn't have 3d, the built-in wifi, slim led panel, etc. that the more expensive upper Samsung models have but it does have plenty of features like fine tuning, various picture and sound modes, SRS TruSurround HD, LED Motion Plus, Game Mode, etc. It also comes with a perfectly sized remote that is user friendly. The Samsung panel also looks thin, amazing and sleek. It doesn't have that nice glass panel frame that higher end models have but it is still nice. I do have to say that I am a little disappointed in the tv stand that it is plastic rather than glass. Plastic still looks nice but feels pretty cheap and really light. I know that it only comes with 2 hdmi but I really could use another hdmi so I could use a cable box, blu-ray player and playstation 3. I know that Samsung TVs cost a little more than the other models but it is well worth it especially for sale prices.

Ghosting and halo artifacts were clearly noticeable, along with a fairly severe motion blur. The construction quality also left a lot to be desired as there was a big gap between each HDMI jack and the back if the cabinet. Thankfully, the HDMI inputs work alright. My unit also leans slightly to the left side and doesn't seem particularly level.Turning the sharpness level from 50 down to 15 worked wonders as most of the ghosting and halo artifacts disappeared. But motion blur was still a huge problem for me. Searching online, I found several people having that exact same issue with the TS02 panel - so it's not just my unit. I've seen older 60hz refresh rate HDTVs that have a similar problem, but this Samsung seems particularly bad for a newer TV.And so I looked online for some calibration settings. I found one from someone on a videophile message board using some sort of a software program. This calibration (described below) worked for me. Fine details now come through, while the brightness and color performance seems much improved. Still, the motion blur is barely acceptable.

It took me a bit to get use to the picture after staring at a plasma for over 4 years. After some tweaking though, I got the picture looking nearly identical to what the plasma put out as far color tone, black level, and brightness. The sound isn't bad either but I only use the TV speakers when watching sports or shows. It has a fairly good viewing angle from all sides and doesn't run too warm either. My plasma would literally heat the room which is a pretty small to begin with.These are the settings that I found best all around for gaming, movies, sports, and shows. That's only if you're like me and don't like to have to keep switching between picture modes.Picture Mode: StandardBacklight: 20Contrast: 90Brightness: 40Sharpness: 35Color: 70Tint: 50/50In Advanced Settings I set Color Space to \"Auto\" with everything else set OFF or at 0. I left the White Balance settings alone.In Picture Options I set Color Tone to \"Standard\", Digital Noise Filter to \"High\" with Film Mode and Motion Plus turned OFF(These two don't seem to do much anyway).Again, this is what I found best all around if you'd rather not switch between picture modes for different types of entertainment.

There have been several comments about other manufacturers building Samsung panels. The version code on mine is not on any code list and by the price I suspected this to be a special version for the holidays, especially since it was built 12/13. I was skeptical because of the video quality. After getting several video setting calibrations from users on the web, they are a great place to start but everyone is extremely different. Again suspecting different makers/different settings, I used the one that looked best to me. After several hours of additional tweaking I have a fantastic looking tv with no pixel problems or lag. I also found that the best results came from turning off most of the special features, this was suggested by several users and many said why. There have also been several comments about the audio, which is a problem with most flat screens. I love the movie audio mode on this tv,there is more than enough volume and separation. Some have complained about the bass in movie mode but I think it makes a richer sound. I might add I am a video editor and am extremely critical of video and audio quality. I would give both a 5 star after the extensive setting tweaks,at least on my TV. I suspect it may be different for each user and that is probably not a good thing. The other things that make it a 4 rating is it needs at least one more hdmi input,&the; hdmis are on the side, which would be fine if the power cord was longer.

You have to name the HDMI input to \"PC\" and the picture coming from your PC will look much better. The sound of this TV has a weird hollow bass so I tend to keep the bass to minimum. This is true for most TV's out there.The problem when using the TV as a PC monitor is that once you name the input to PC, many of the HDMI settings become unavailable and you are not able to tweak the picture. For example, there is no setting controlling the color saturation, unless you change each color yourself (good luck with that). I liked that the TV has a matte screen but often the picture looked either too washed out (without color) or with too few levels of dark (the dark levels merged into one black). Yes, my TV had a screen manufactured by Samsung not a third party.The crispiness of the text as a PC monitor was OK but it was always a tradeoff with the quality of picture when watching movies: when you improve one of those with the settings, the other deteriorates. Also, I noticed white tones in Windows got weird hues when changing only Contrast. A good TV is not supposed to do that. I don't know if that was typical for this model TV or the one I got was mildly defective - it was \"used as new\".In the end I bought LG 32LN5300 which is much more pleasing to the eyes as a PC monitor and has settings you can tweak in that mode.

For a full array LED backlit TV it should have better even illumination overall, and I have seen better even illumination into the corners (on more expensive TVs, of course). Most of the time this is not noticeable and of minor concern. Other than this I am very pleased with it.", "Date": "September 22, 2012"}, {"Title": "Do not buy this TV for Netflix as the current 2/16 Firmware issue is not covered under warranty", "Author": "Nancy Hines", "ReviewID": "R1K2MF3A3B2LQQ", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I loved the TV for 9 months and enjoyed my Netflix account until one day Netflix quit working. It was unable to play any titles and said to try again later. I went through a month of calls to Samsung, called Netflix, called my ISP. I have chatted with support and done everything they said to try. Nothing worked to fix Netflix, it kept saying it was unable to play any titles right now, to try again later. Netflix support had me Deactivate and reactivate it and still no joy. Finally, Samsung sent a tech out and he had Support connect remotely and they determined my network was too slow. Which I knew was incorrect as nothing had changed with it and it worked fine for 9 months. My ISP was barely providing 3 Mbps download so I changed ISP and now get 30 Mbps download. I called Samsung back and tried to get a tech to come back out as I am convinced the Motherboard has failed after finding a Samsung forum where a Samsung tech stated he replaced the motherboard and it fixed this problem. I called Samsung numerous times and they argued and argued. I have a computer hardware background as well as Cisco certification CCNA. I know about hardware and this could be fixed in warranty but Samsung refuses to own up and perform the repair. So I advised -DO NOT BUY THIS TV FOR NETFLIX.  After 6 weeks of chats, calls, the executive team saying the TV is fine I went and bought a second one, same model. It plays Netflix FINE, as it has updated chips on its motherboard and it has an updated Firmware version that is not available to the public at this time. I had to argue and insist they repair the TV so they finally sent out a USB device that was to have the 1039 version of the firmware - it didn't. After waiting two weeks for a USB drive (ever heard of FTP Samsung?) the USB had the same version of firmware that doesn't work - 1037. So I call and argue some more and get placed on hold, disconnected twice and now they say I get to wait two more weeks for another USB drive with the right Firmware version.I specifically requested a tech come out since the network speed was drastically improved and they refused stating the TV is not broken. Last night 2/26 the tech FINALLY admitted after 20 calls, chats and a home visit where they ALL DENIED an issue existed - FINALLY I am told - YES right now there is a Firmware issue with Netflix and Samsung WILL NOT REPAIR the TV as they say it is not broken. Additionally, they are meeting with Netflix daily to resolve the Firmware issue and gave me an ETA of two weeks for the 'Fixed' firmware to be available to the public. It worked fine for 9 months and then failed to function properly and its not the TV that's broken? I know for a fact that replacing the motherboard would fix my faulty TV but Samsung has refused the repair under Warranty. They will however be glad to have a tech come out and replace the motherboard at my expense. Yes, I am expected to pay for a Warranty repair?!! A product that has Netflix as a partner is refusing to admit the product failure and finally does but then refuses to make the consumer whole, instead requests I wait two more weeks? It's been broken for almost two months now and Samsung requests I be patience and wait some more. I just want to be made whole so I requested a replacement TV and was refused. Best Buy can't help me out as I did not get a warranty from them so I have a faulty TV and no Netflix, so consumer beware. Samsung will not stand behind the Warranty on this TV if its related to faulty firmware, I need to see the fine print on that one. VERY disappointed in Samsung support and Warranty process.NEVER buy a Samsung product without purchasing Best Buys coverage as I confirmed the Geek squad would have fixed this under warranty with no questions. The second TV I bought has a 5 yr warranty from Best Buy and they will come out and repair that one, no extra charge. Shame on you Samsung for running me in circles for 6 weeks and denying the product is faulty for over 6 weeks.

You can't do that with these new models. I read a lot online to try to solve the problem, and everything seemed to confirm that there was no way to do this.  There is a jack for plugging in headphones BUT because the speakers in the TV are so weak, if you use regular headphones, the sound output is atrocious. You have to turn the volume on the TV all the way down, and you get very weak sound through the headphones, and you can't adjust the volume with the volume control on the headphones. And IF you turn the volume on the TV up, you get sound through the TV speakers and the headphones at the same time, which of course you don't want. (I'm not 100% sure but I think you'd have this same problem with all those TV ears they sell). You have a choice: you can use wireless with an independent power source, or wired, also with an independent power source, and then you can control the volume through the phones. We just got a reasonably priced soundbar at Radio Shack, and that certainly improves the sound quality in general for watching without phones. The only problem with it is that it doesn't have an headphone jack, so we can't plug phones directly into that. Anyway, bottom line, we think we've solved the sound problem for us, but it's too bad that with the LED's the manufacturers can't accommodate people who want to plug in phones and get good sound directly from the TV. One thing for sure, if you're two people in a small apartment, you certainly do NOT need to spend a lot of money to get decent sound from your LED TV.", "Date": "February 1, 2014"}, {"Title": "Great Deal!", "Author": "Caren", "ReviewID": "R3H68VA221EWO0", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Great television, Samsung makes them to last.

I saw two very good 40\" HDTVs at Sam's Club, but when I would go back to purchase one, they were always sold out.  It is a very good television that fits my 48\" wide bookcase very well.  It has a narrow bezel, unlike most 40\" TVs, so it would fit into the bookcase with room to spare on each side and the top for ventilation.  It didn't come out of the box with the best adjustment for my application, but with some care and effort, I got it adjusted to look as good as those at Sam's Club looked.  It has an excellent picture with the tweaking that I did, and the menus for doing that are good (not excellent, but good), they are fairly intuitive if you have had experience with such menus.  They are far better than the menus on my 32\" Vizio that I replaced with this TV (HDMI connectors all knocked out by lightning strikes), and also on my 42\" Panasonic plasma 1080i HDTV.  The picture on this LED Samsung rivals that of the Panasonic plasma set at a fraction of the cost.  The plasma Panasonic has an excellent picture, and this low cost Samsung LED tv is almost as good.  I say almost, because the blacks and the crispness of picture aren't quite as good as the Panasonic.  But considering what I payed for the Panasonic four years ago, the Samsung is by far the better value.  The Panasonic plasmas cost less than half what they used to cost, but still about twice as much as this Samsung.And, the LED tv is only a fraction of the weight of the Panasonic plasma set, and also puts out only a fraction of the heat that the plasma set does.My only negative comment thus far, is that the Samsung set has only two HDMI connectors.  If you have a TiVo or other DVR and a BluRay player, you have used up all of the HDMI connectors and will have to use the RGB component connector for the next device.I highly recommend this TV if it continues to be as good as it is now.  I've used it only one month, and have had only one lightning strike without damage.  The surge protector that I have is supposed to protect the cable connection too, but it doesn't.

I tried the easier one. I opened the back (AFTER UNPLUGGING IT) and tried re-seating the cables. Some I could not loosen but I tried pressing them in. And................ my $700 tv works! And I spent zero dollars and only needed a screwdriver. The hint is: if your tv blinks when you smack the top, it could be a loose cable, according to the guy on youtube. Mine blinked, and mine was fixed as I described (for more detail, I first plugged the tv back in and tried tapping each cable to see which one might be loose, the screen didn't flicker. Then I unplugged the tv again and reseated or pressed in every cable I saw, around 7 or 8, and wala!)Also, apparently a lot of the time it is the capacitors, so if yours is broke you might try replacing them (pretty cheap to do yourself). You'll need screwdriver, solder iron, solder sucker, and some capacitors (and some instruction, but it looks quite simple to do). And the back panel should come off easy, if it doesn't then you missed a screw.I may or may not change the one-star. I should note that the tv doesn't get banged around.

I managed to get a full-screen photograph over and it stays on, but the image quality isn't so great. If I zoom in on the photo, the blue sections (that shouldn't be there) get bigger. So I' guessing the screen is okay, it's the parts telling the screen what to display that have gone bad.If I hit the tv remote menu button, i get vertical lines, horizontal lines, or both (and I can't read any menu options, except maybe the bottom line of text.)On the analog tv input: Some channels flicker on and off then stay on, other channels stay black.$700 / 18 months = $39/month, which is probably better than rental places, but rental places are ripoffs.

If you know anything about how televisions operate, or at least think about it for a moment, you know'll know that inside every TV or radio there are separate components that do specific jobs -- just like your car. For instance, there is an audio amplifier and speakers to handle the sound portion of the programming. Those components have nothing to do with the video portion of the signal.To convert broadcast radio waves, every receiver (TV or radio) has a tuner -- a tuning section. If you are getting your signal through the pipe, you don't need this, so Samsung has apparently skimped on the design and reliability of the tuners in their sets, because most people don't need this component.I have an old, tall house with a rotating antenna on the roof, and since I purchased a Samsung, channels suddenly and completely drop out. Not merely during inclement weather, but for weeks at a time.  For a while, I couldn't get Channel 2, no matter what position I rotated the antenna to.  Then, Channel 4 became a problem. I switched to an amplified indoor antenna, but with no change in the results, so my diagnosis points to the Samsung's tuner. A friend of mine also purchased a Samsung, and he has the same problem. Channels come and go, but his missing channels are different than mine.The LED picture is good enough, I guess, and I often watch HD programming on it through my Apple TV, but for broadcast TV, it's the worst set I've ever owned.

Finally, the 4th TV in 20 days (2nd Samsung) works without any issue!  Couldn't be happier.  Now, for a 'real' review of the actual TV.Before I go over the details, let me go over my setup.  This is important because it explains why I rate this TV the way I did.- Samsung UN40EH5000 40\" LED TV- Onkyo HT-RC360  A/V receiver- Sony BDP-S480 Blueray Disc (BD) player- Apple TV (2nd gen)- Acer Windows 7 Media Center PC- Nintendo Wii(And a Magnavox VCR/DVD recorder to copy some of my old tapes to DVD)The receiver, BD player, Apple TV, Wii and PC are all networked.  I don't have cable - instead I have an array of three antennae in my attic: a long-range UHF, a long-range VHF, and a mid-range omnidirectional VHF/UHF.  Combiners send the signal to an amplifier in the basement where most components are housed in an air-cooled cabinet (all except the TV and BD player, which are in the TV room).1 - Connections.  This TV has limited connections.  This is important if you have a lot of components you want to connect.  For example, my setup wouldn't work without the receiver.  Having said that, I have no issues since I use the receiver as the source selector.  In all honesty, I would have been fine if this were just a monitor, e.g. no TV tuner, as I use the media PC for TV watching.  But these things are less expensive with a tuner than without.  Go figure.  The one thing it doesn't have that I was slightly disappointed about was the lack of HDMI ARC (Audio Return Channel), which means that if I do want to watch live TV and listen to surround sound, I have to use the optical cable.  Not a huge deal, but if you want to have the cables in the wall you'll have to fish one as Leviton doesn't make a plug-in SP/DIF plug.  Since I watch TV from my media PC it's not a big enough deal to take points off.2 - Features.  What features?  Aside from being able to play off a USB stick and an amazing array of picture adjustment options, there really are no features.  No streaming, no browser, no AirPlay.  But again, that's perfect for my setup.  I use Apple TV for Netflix and iTunes, the Sony BD player for Vudu and Amazon On Demand (and a wide array of other streaming services), and my Media PC for live TV and recorded TV.  Consider this a 40\" monitor with a tuner, not a one-stop media device.3 - Picture quality.  This one's kind of tough because there are so many settings, it can be time consuming finding the best quality.  The TV's Energy Star rating says it'll use $7 a year, but that's with all the Eco settings.  I have found that most of those make the picture quite dark.  So I'm still trying to tweak the screen to give me the color and brightness I want but also keep the energy costs down - the whole point behind an LED TV.  I may have to invest in a test BD, but I'll try a little longer.  Bottom line is that I'm sure I can find a happy medium as there are a plethora of settings you can adjust.As other reviewers have said, this is not a 120Hz TV.  I didn't think that would be an issue, but you'd be surprised.  Even fast action in a movie will show motion blur.  There's a setting to reduce this, but it also makes the screen darker.  Again, it will take tweaking.4 - Design.  It's not as thin as other LED TVs.  On the other hand, as a result, it seems to be more sturdy than other TVs.  As indicated above, I first tried a pair of TCL TVs.  These are absolutely gorgeous, with minimal bezels and a very thin design.  Both had busted screens.  The first Samsung had an issue as well, but it seemed to me it was just because of a pair of main board mounts that were driven into the screen from behind.  I specifically wanted a slightly thicker TV to make sure it wouldn't be broken during manufacturing or shipping.  The bezel is still rather slim.  I have mine wall mounted and haven't even taken the stand out of the plastic.  And it's amazingly light, weighing less than 20 lbs without the stand.5 - Audio.  I really can't comment, as one of the first things I did was turn of the internal speakers.  Check other reviews for audio properties.6 - Overall.  My previous TV was a 32\" Olevia (532) that had worked fine for 5+ years.  But it was getting tired, and we watch enough movies that we wanted something bigger.  My TV room is a small space, with eyes about 8' from the screen.  I could have gone 46\", but there really was no need.  Despite what US advertising makes you think, bigger is not always better.  After only one day I'm very pleased with my choice, and if you have an AV receiver or only 2 video sources, you will be too.  I upgraded my rating to 5 stars as it does exactly what it said it would.--------------Original Review:I had trouble finding a title. See, this is the 3rd TV I got from Amazon in 2 weeks. First I got a TCL 42\". That had a busted screen (not visible until it was on). Then I got a replacement for that, same model, different problem but also busted. See my other reviews for details.I didn't want to try a 3rd TCL, so I went with a 'reputable' brand. So much for that idea. This one has two spots in the center of the screen that are unlit. I'll upload a picture so you can see what I mean. So, it's going back for replacement - which will be TV # 4. I'm starting to get a feeling either I'm just incredibly unlucky, or Amazon only sells grade B products.I rated it 4 stars because it may just be a fluke. I'm supposed to get my replacement next Tuesday and will update this review afterwards. If TV # 4 is bad as well, it'll become a 1 star review and I will stick with my 32\" Olevia untill it dies, because I can't keep doing this.", "Date": "August 10, 2012"}, {"Title": "NOT MEANT TO BE USED FOR A COMPUTER MONITOR!!!", "Author": "Kevin Yu", "ReviewID": "R2XVWH6KDTO2K5", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "So I just received my tv today and first thing I did was hook it up to my computer because I bought it as a replacement for a broken Dynex 32\" 720p TV which I used as a monitor. (Occasionally Used For Over The Air Digital Channels) Since I have an AMD HD6970 graphics card running in my tower, it automatically changed the output screen resolution to 1080p which is where this tv DOES NOT PERFORM WELL. All the lettering is fuzzy no matter how I changed the settings on my computer and the TV. The only way I could get the lettering to be clear and detailed was to reduce the resolution to 1600 x 900. I have no problem with the 1600 x 900 resolution however, I did pay $420 for this tv and had hoped it would compare well with the 55\" Sony I have in the living room which my tower can plug into and go 1080p with awesome clarity (Even Though My Parents Paid $1.5k for the Sony). The picture quality does need tweaking and I followed (for the most part) the setup of the guy who wrote the most viewed post. Overall this TV is super lightweight which was one of the main reasons I bought it since my desk has been tilted due to the 25lb weight of the Dynex TV I recently trashed. It's a good buy for the most part and when the time comes for me to move out of my parent's house, this would most likely become my main TV and I will buy an actual monitor for my computing needs.", "Date": "August 1, 2012"}, {"Title": "It's not for the living room.", "Author": "mmdetloff", "ReviewID": "R2N2JI3118K78R", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "It's a great high performance TV, but not really good for the living room.

Not a great solution because the TV remote does not control the volume -- it requires a separate remote -- and I have to manually set the TV volume to zero when using the headphones.

Wichmann", "ReviewID": "RZDHBZJOHBKW7", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "There's really only one thing that matters for the TV: picture quality.  This TV came with a version code of HS03, which means it's not a Samsung panel, apparently (see elsewhere in reviews).  No amount of twiddling has come anywhere near an acceptable picture, so it's going back. Part of the problem seems to be the very matte screen surface which diffuses things in unexpected ways.  Having said nothing else matters, a couple more niggles - these would not have been enough to send it back and would just have remained irritants.  The stand does not swivel, which we need to avoid dragging the base on the surface on which it sits. The base is also extremely lightweight, leaving us quite nervous it could tip over easily. Can't do anything to anchor it, because we do have to turn the whole TV for certain uses (see swivel complaint). And for a TV which is not hung on a wall and has a uniform background, but stands on a piece of furniture, it's much easier on the eye if the TV itself has some borders to make a visual separation between the picture and the room background.  This TV (apparently in common with all current models, so this not particularly specific to this model) has essentially no borders.  That made a surprising difference in comfort compared to the previous LCD TV of the same screen size (also a Samsung - LN-T4065F).  Samsung has cut back on connection ports, which has been noted elsewhere and we knew going in - but just two HDMI ports is kind of niggly in a day when just about everything, including notebook computers, now comes with an HDMI port; the older model had three, which turned out just right for our uses.", "Date": "January 20, 2013"}, {"Title": "above average", "Author": "jk \"John\"", "ReviewID": "RDL73CI1EH373", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "bought this tv a month and a half ago and still tweaking the settings.

I waited 3 months for the price discount on this TV, and believed that the $649.00 price was for a NEW TV - not a refurbished or damaged unit. Considering that the TV arrived 5 days later than scheduled, I am absolutely sure that this Samsung TV was previously delivered elsewhere. The Samsung TV arrived via UPS, the box as crushed on each side with perforations which damaged the rear panel of the TV inside. This should have been noticed at the Chicago Amazon warehouse (as that was where it was shipped from). Additionally, the TV box seems to have been dragged around a lot as the bottom of the box was wet and severely damaged, with major scuff marks. Additionally, it seems that some repair may have been done on this TV as the screws holding the rear panel was loose (not screwed in tight). After I contacted Amazon for a replacement, and advised them of the damage, they identified that they had no more in stock and was not willing to have a replacement shipped from a re-seller. I presume that since they could not match the price at $649.00 they were unwilling to do what is best to retain their customers.

I went online and found a short checklist to make sure everything was set-up properly. 1) was the TV plugged in? 2) After plugging in the TV did I press the power button? 3) Was it connected to my media player or computer? 4) Make sure all the cables were securely fastened. It could be one or any of these reasons that the TV wasn't displaying anything. For me it was all of them. It's been years since I bought a new TV and I guess I just kinda assumed the technology was good enough so that no set-up was required. That and it said plug and play. The plug part is VERY important! If you at plug the TV into a power outlet you can at least get what they call \"snow\" to show up on the screen. Don't stop there! This TV can do so much more!! I plugged a cable into my blu-ray player and then into the hole in the TV that fit the other end of the cable.  Nothing happened at first but my friend who is a technology whiz told me I had to press the source button on the remote. Oh man! Still nothing. I was starting to get a little frustrated because I didn't just want to look at snow, a burning fire over some logs would have been much more appealing than the pre-loaded snow video.  A couple weeks later my tech buddy just happened to stop over (I hate when people come by unannounced especially dealers).  He noticed that the remote felt light and asked to see the TV's packaging. He pulled out two small cylinders that were in a tight plastic wrapping and put them into a \"secret\" compartment in the remote control and pressed the source button. WOW!!! the snow switched to my favorite movie, Finding Nemo. The same movie I had wanted to watch when I fired up my blu-ray player many days before.  It's a brilliant movie about a small orange fish that was born with a horribly deformed small fin on one side of his little body. This fish is raised by an over-protective father fish that doesn't let Nemo experience the ocean like the other fish can. I don't blame the father fish though, because of what happens in the beginning of the film. I won't spoil it but a barracuda eats all of Nemo's brothers and sisters. The wife fish uses this as a clever way to cover up her escape from the boring father fish who thinks she is dead too. In the end little Nemo finally experiences a great adventure, overcoming many of life's obstacles (sharks and what not) in the process.  Anyway, it's a great film and I highly recommend it, thats why I'm giving this TV 5 stars!", "Date": "July 25, 2012"}, {"Title": "Lousy customer service", "Author": "dlb \"blue\"", "ReviewID": "R39PNR6PGBOYZ6", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "Samsung has the worst customer service I've run into.
