{"Reviews": [{"Title": "A good TV for your spare bedroom or den", "Author": "WryGuy2", "ReviewID": "R37W1617LG4OXK", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "In my never-ending quest to replace all of my old cathode ray tube televisions around the house (three more to go!) , I decided to give this product, the \"RCA 22LB45RQD 22-Inch Full 1080p LCD/DVD Combo\", a try. This LCD TV is a moderately-priced, low frills television, but includes DVD player. Interestingly, the TV includes full 1080p resolution (many, if not most TV's of this size are 720p).  For the non-technophiles, this refers to the TV's ability to accept a 1080p signal and display it with a resolution of at 1080 horizontal lines.  More lines mean you can display a better resolution picture, although your input signal also has to have a high resolution; otherwise the TV will up-convert the signal.  If you use this a computer monitor rather than as a TV, it will allow you to achieve a resolution of up to 1920 \u00d7 1080.Pros:- It's light, around 12 pounds total.  The older 20 inch CRT TV that this is replacing weighs over 40 pounds.  I'm continually amazed at how light and thin TVs are now.  I used to buy televisions in part based on whether I could carry them by myself, and found myself limited to a 27 inch screen.  Nowadays I'm probably limited more by the spread of my arms.  :-)-  You can choose from several different picture aspects (normal, widescreen, zoom, cinema) to get the least distortion and best picture, depending on whether you're watching an old 4:3 format show or a 16:9 widescreen movie. This is a nice feature that isn't always found on lower-priced LCD TVs.- There are plenty of input jacks ... one HDMI, 1 set of composite and 1 set of component video (only one of which is useable at a time, though), RF, a USB port, headphone jack, etc.  All of the jacks are on the left.- The sound volume can be turned up very loud. The volume of many LCDs is a problem, where the loudest setting is barely adequate if there is any other noise in the room (kids playing, for example) competing with the TV. But the volume for this TV is great.- The remote is full-sized and laid out logically.- Assembly was easy; you only had to mount the TV onto its pedestal, which meant using 4 screws to connect the TV to the base.  It took me only a couple of minutes, and after that, the TV was ready to go.- I had no problems with the DVD player, and it worked fine.  Just note that you have to insert the DVD so that the label points away from you (which is intuitively backwards to me, at least).  From the tech specifications info provided, the DVD will play/display the following:  DVD/SVCD/VCD/CD/JPEG, and the USB port will play/display MP3 files and JPEGs.Cons:- Like most LCD TVs, it's slow to turn on and slow to change channels, although if you're using a satellite or cable box, the time to change channels isn't an issue. It takes five seconds from pushing the power button until the picture appears, and two seconds to change channels. This isn't a big problem for me, as I knew that about LCD TV's going in, but I mention it in case it's an important consideration for you.- The picture is very good, but the viewing angles are only fair (but better than some of my other LCD TVs.)  It will take a VESA standard 100 X 100 mount if you want to hang it from your wall and adjust the viewing angles that way.-  The power cord was a bit hard to connect (but you only have to do that once!)Overall, I really like this TV/DVD combo, especially how thin and light it is. It's a good TV for your spare bedrooms or home office/den. And due to the 1080p resolution, it can also serve as a decent computer monitor.

Ratatouille (Two-Disc Blu-ray/DVD Combo) was playing after the very quick setup!Out of the box: The base is easy to install (somewhat loose and floppy but I didn't tighten down the screws since I won't be using the base when mounted to the wall), the connections are easy to reach (especially with an articulating wall mount such as VideoSecu Articulating TV Wall Mount Bracket for VESA 100 LCD LED Flat Screen Monitor TV 1E9), and has a full range of input ports including USB which is severely lacking from many similar models! The picture is very crisp compared to some similar mid-range models and is a full 1080p (splurge the few extra bucks for 1080p, you'll be glad in the long run!) The remote uses 2 AAA batteries (included, worked great.) The viewing angle is AT LEAST 130 degrees, closer to 140 degrees without specifically measuring.The input jacks on this model are in the left side while the built in dvd player is accessible on the right side; the controls are along the top center, a somewhat unusual location for comparable models (keep this in mind if mounting high such as above a fridge.) The base mounts loosely with 2 different sized \"pins\" but then secures much better with 4 tiny screws, again rather unusual from the many different HDTVs I've experienced. The power cord mounts to the lower side making the power cord somewhat visible if the tv is mounted very high, such as above a fridge.  The power cord is a standard computer power cord - I like standardization so if you lose a cord such as when moving it is not a hassle to replace.The ports along the left side (sitting sideways instead of sticking out the back allowing a flusher installation to the wall!) from top to bottom include:* head phone jack* PC audio in* TV / cable coax* 15 pin VGA* 6 ports for either 5 port component including stereo audio or 3port including video and stereo audio (not both simultaneously which may be relevant if you are hooking up devices needing both such as a game system on component and an older DVD player on composite - that setup simply wouldn't work on this unit without a separate port switch, sold separately)* HDMI* USB - perfect for using this HDTV as a digital photo slideshow when not being used as a TV!The USB port - I loaded an otherwise blank flash drive with 2 folders - images and music.  I then transferred 50 or so JPEGs and about 60 MP3s to their respective folders.  I found settings on the playback allowing both an MP3 to play continuously while the images were repeated as a slideshow.  The images always played in alpha order and only from the first basic folder, not any sub folders.  The music folder allowed me to select a specific song from sub-folders but not the a group of MP3s nor a folder, just one specific MP3. If I find a way around this I will update here with instructions.The energy guide included on this model shows an estimated yearly energy cost of $9 in the middle of the cost range of similar models estimated to be $4 - $13 / year (based on 11 centers per kWh and 5 hours use per day... more info at ftc.gov/energy)I rate this HDTV as 5+ stars: 5 for being a great basic HDTV with a great clear picture with a wide viewing angle and a bonus star for having a USB port, something I've been expecting yet not finding on other similar 22\" models including similar models from Toshiba and Coby. I will update this review if the DVD player fails or anything else happens warranting an update.", "Date": "November 21, 2012"}, {"Title": "Great small screen", "Author": "starstruck", "ReviewID": "R1JUVBNTWYFOW4", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I love this TV for a small room! The color is fabulous and the sound is good too! I have watched several DVDs on it and everything has worked well. I suspect that those who were having trouble with DVDs were putting them in backwards because if you follow the very explicit directions and put them in with the shiny side forward it does seem slightly contrary to the norm. I hung the TV on the wall using a wall mount that I bought from Amazon and because the TV is very light weight it was very easy to mount. I did discover after hanging it that the manual control buttons are across the back edge at the top so if you want to be able to see them when you need to you might consider hanging it slightly lower on the wall so you can see over the top. In a small room such as I installed it in (10' square) it was the perfect size. Any larger would have overwhelmed the room. I think you would be hard pressed to find a better TV/DVD combo than this one is for under $200.", "Date": "November 24, 2012"}, {"Title": "... OK and 2 stars because now I CAN'T watch my DVDs in it ...", "Author": "E. Hernandez \"Call me Harry\"", "ReviewID": "RJUOJMAIXFLCV", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "RCA 22\" LCD SCREEN TV/DVD PLAYER [DOES NOT SUPPORT BLU-RAY] was an odd surprise, which is not always the best kind of surprise to have. Since I am a man of the last century (I've waited half my life to be able to write that!) I can get dizzy from seeing the latest technological disasters. I can also boast happy memories of the days without cable, the good old days of five TV channels, an antenna that worked, and good programming.Back to this RCA which I just bought (not here, on sale for $199). This is 100% Chinese-made, and it shows. The abominable instructions give zero guidance and that is a crime, whether it is done in China or anywhere. This television set made me miss my old 100-pound Magnavox from 2002. The RCA weighs all of 10 pounds, and my wife was laughing as she skipped into the house with it, holding it lightly in one hand.Trouble is not only bad instructions: this TV set has none of the fine features found in TVs from a decade ago. It does not allow the viewer to skip from the DVD to TV then return later and pick up the DVD where it left off; this thing simply shuts down the DVD input. If you interrupt a DVD improperly, you will be fussing with it from the very start of the disc.The connections are in an awkward and stupid spot at the back. I do not necessarily have to have every single connection in the front of the TV set, but this is ridiculous. I know, I know: they need to be there because this can be mounted on the wall, and, well, where else would the connections be? So?The screen instructions and navigation: one of the worst nightmares of my existence. What I could do on an old Magnavox with two pushes of the buttons now takes me several steps and a firm prayer that I don't hit the wrong damned button on the remote. It also involves curse words in 13 languages, with the loudest ones in English--and I use words in English you've never heard.This is not just crusty, moldy old me getting used to a new TV. It's Chinese torture, and I know for a fact that the Chinese do such things on purpose.For the price, who could pass it up, I ask you? My old TV went haywire. When I determined to just buy a new TV, I never bargained for such migraines. I'm learning and I'm happy enough when in the midst of a favorite film - but with all the Houston Mission Controls just to tweak the color, with the sound system nothing but a complicated atrocity like the old 1970s stereo systems ... Chinese ingenuity my foot!The sound from this TV is total crap. We had to add speakers--not a speaker bar, mind you, because that would be another $100. Computer screen speakers (around $15 for a pair) work beautifully if you plug them into the earphone jack.The other major complaint is the DVD player itself. It is set in the upper right-hand corner of the TV, and has the weirdest DVD-inserting mechanism I have ever suffered. More like a CD player that you instinctively feel is going to break.\"So far I have had no troubles with it like so many reviewers say they have had, but that doesn't surprise me. My wife and I are very handy at putting in/taking out DVDs, but I have the nasty feeling that one day soon, it'll just stop working.\" * UPDATE: NOTE BELOW *I'd rather have the obnoxious \"CD tray\" that pops out and demands your DVD, as if it were sticking out its \"tongue\" at you. One final piece of proof that the Chinese are out to trounce us every way they can: I read a huge number of reviews for this RCA TV, all of which state that their DVD players don't function at all. The reviewers state they called RCA tech support and were told RCA is very aware of this problem.Very, indeed! So what is offered to the customer by RCA in such a predicament? If my DVD player hadn't functioned I would have personally THROWN this TV back at the place I bought it. Why the heck didn't I just buy a new Magnavox? Perhaps because those, too, are made in China.* VITAL UPDATE: I guess I'm throwing this TV back at the merchant. It has turned out to be a royal disappointment. There is no way I can leave this review without updates from a customer who has had this television only since this past May. I wrote my review in June. Today (5th December 2013) I spent an hour on the phone being redirected by the store to RCA and from RCA back to the store. RCA HAS NO TECH SUPPORT.The store won't come to my home to fix this because the screen is too small.The DVD player is officially fried--first by freezing inexplicably (that started about two months after I bought it). Now it simply accepts and then fails to \"read\" the DVD. In other words the TV thinks there's no DVD in it when it is, in fact, sitting there waiting to be \"loaded\". Now I will take it back and return it for a refund ... assuming I don't need to sign a lien on my home or donate my body to the store first!!Seven-month ownership advice: get something else, better, hopefully not Chinese manufactured, and who cares if it's $200 more! RCA has become SO not worth it. I'm actually toying with the thought of getting my money refunded in full and buying whatever the hell ... honestly, who cares.", "Date": "June 2, 2013"}, {"Title": "Didn't work from the moment we opened the package", "Author": "Gretchen", "ReviewID": "R1VOJSZGD8O2QO", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "Do not purchase this TV.

For this review I tested the majority of these features and was very satisfied with the outcome. The only gripes I had with this unit was when I hooked it up to a PC via HDMI and tried to get the clarity and color accuracy to match a standard computer LCD monitor. I was also dissatisfied with photo quality when viewing pictures from an attached USB drive.For video watching this TV offers very good image and sound quality when adjusted correctly. Of course quality changes depending on the source input but for my best quality test I used an external Blu-ray player hooked up via HDMI. DVDs played through the internal slot player look OK but not great considering the low SD resolution DVD format and also since the built-in DVD player does not seem to be an upscaling type.One of the rare features I mentioned earlier is the inclusion of a user customizable 7 band EQ for sound. This feature works especially well when using headphones plugged directly into the TV for late night viewing or listening to music stored on a USB device plugged into the USB jack. The USB jack allows for attaching a storage device for music playback and picture viewing. Another notable feature is the \"dot by dot\" pixel mapping option when hooked up to a PC which means there's no scaling involved allowing for more clarity. Finally a user adjustable menu transparency setting allows a better GUI that doesn't block the screen from being viewed. This TV is also wall mountable with a VESA 100 compatible bolt pattern.In summary this is a good performing little HDTV suitable for a small bedroom, kitchen or even RV. It's convenient with the built-in DVD player, low cost with good performance and stylishly modern. Kudos to RCA for also including a full printed user manual instead of a CD or requiring you to download one online.My own settings which I feel is a good baseline to start from:Picture Mode UserBrightness 50Contrast 40Color 35Tint 0Sharpness 75Screen Size Full 100%Color Temp NormalDynamic Contrast offFilm mode off/on depending on input sourceNR offMPEG NR offSound Mode UserBass 12Treble 15Auto Volume onEQ Mode User 6-5-6-5-2-6-12Menu Transparency highVideo Style graphic", "Date": "November 22, 2012"}, {"Title": "Hope for all the dvd problems!!", "Author": "Freddie's Girl \"lakotaluv\"", "ReviewID": "R2QTBUS5VPB5PR", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I got one of there last November.  Picture was outstanding and I was happy.  Six months later I tried to use the DVD player, didn't work, came here and read all the bad reviews and thought about what a fool I had been...  I next looked at my warranty and phoned the number to see if there was a local repair place I could take it to. They surprised me by saying they would send a service man to my house (50 miles each direction out in the country).  They sent him, he looked at it and ordered $450 worth of parts, came back when they arrived and fixed it!  I can't believe they paid for two $120 trips out to the house and $450 worth of parts to fix a tv I had only paid about $150 for and neither could the service man. It says on the warranty they only offer this service for big tvs, but they did it anyway at completely no charge to me.  It works great now and am super happy with it and the company - what a shocker! Maybe this will work for some of you who have the ones with the broken DVD players.

Well done.", "Author": "Xina143", "ReviewID": "RC9B1C5B535UM", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "RCA is not a brand I put on the top of my list for home entertainment goods, but I was shocked when I opened and set up this LCD/DVD combo.Strangely, it was shipped in the TV box with bubble wrap around the box. Fortunately, the TV is packed well in the box, so all was well. And the TV and base are wrapped in plastic wrap to protect from scratches as you move it into place.You get the TV/DVD combo, a power cord, a remote with batteries, a base with screws, and a few manuals. No extras like an HDMI cable. So no need for an unboxing video.The base is your typical hard plastic and is 10\" wide by about 6.5\" deep. This provides plenty of stability for the TV. Screwing the base to the TV was a little scary. You have to screw in 4 screws through the base and into the TV unit. Despite the pre-drilled holes, I was afraid of cracking the hard plastic by screwing in too far. And the screws do take some force to screw all the way in. You'll think you are done, but there is still wiggle room, so you have to keep screwing down. The screws did go all the way in and get the base snug. And no cracks! But I will say that I prefer the snap-in bases. The base also has 4 rubber feet to help avoid scratching the stand you place the TV on. Of course, you can mount the TV to the wall if you have a wall mount available (one is not included though).The TV is nice and thin and has a clean, shiny bezel. Nothing obtrusive. The DVD player is hidden on one side. The dust blocker flaps on the drive have a gap in the middle. Not sure why, but seems like it will let dust get into the drive and eventually be a problem. On the opposite side are the input ports. Only complaint I have here is that there is only 1 HDMI port. One or two more would be nice since most devices support the standard now. Especially since this is a 1080p TV. On the top of the TV unit, you have some of the standard operation buttons - power, channel up/down, volume up/down, DVD controls, etc. In addition, the remote comes with batteries and is pretty function filled. Channel selection, input, menu, picture and sound adjustment, DVD functions, aspect ratio, etc. No backlit keys though.Upon first boot of the TV, it will walk you through setup. Answer a few questions and you are ready to go. It will even kick off a channel scan if you have OTA/Cable inserted via coax with its Digital ATSC Tuner. I have the TV setup with straight from the wall Cable into the coax port, and then my laptop attached via HDMI. The Tuner picked up all the channels my Cable company provides without a set top box. And the channels come in great, including the HD channels. Channel changes take about 2 seconds. The Favorite function on the remote is great since it allows you to quickly save a channel and then flip up and down through your favorites. Power on takes about 5 to 6 seconds. Power off is pretty much immediate.First thing I noticed is that the sound is very tinny. After further checking, the default sound settings come with treble up and bass turned down. So a few tweaks in the Sound settings got things sounding better.The TV is also pretty bright which is primarily an issue since I will be using this on a desk with limited distance between the unit and my eyes. So I had to adjust the brightness down a bit. This wouldn't be much of an issue if using as a TV from a distance. Fortunately, there are no tint issues (too blue or too red), and the contrast is good. Skin tones look great. And I haven't noticed any colors popping too harsh.When connecting a computer to the system via HDMI, text was very difficult to read. Blurry and red shadows. After a bit more poking in settings, I found the Video Style option in Setup. Change this to Graphic (adjusts the HDMI picture). This will make the computer output look much better via HDMI. The only other issue with computer usage is that the TV does not go to sleep with the computer immediately. It only has an option to go to sleep after 10 minutes of no input.The DVD player works as expected. It is a bit slow sucking in the DVD disc and ejecting. But otherwise, it works great. Just be sure to put the disc in correctly - label side should face the back of the TV unit.And while not an issue in my case (since it will be in front of me on my desk), the viewing angle of the unit is great.Overall, this is a good TV unit for a secondary viewing area (not large enough for most main living spaces), and so far, I'm pleased with it as a monitor in my office (second monitor for computer and I can watch TV in the office as well). If you covered up the RCA logo, I'm sure many would be surprised by the brand. Looks clean and sleek. Quality picture. And feature rich remote. A few extra HDMI ports and other inputs would have been great, but with the price of this TV unit, one can afford a few HDMI switches. Here's hoping the unit is durable and serves for some time to come.", "Date": "November 26, 2012"}, {"Title": "Perfect TV for my bedroom", "Author": "Diane Kistner", "ReviewID": "RAGUC7U1COHOB", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "This TV is just the right size for my bedroom, and the picture is of very good quality. I don't have cable in my bedroom, but I like my little all-to-myself cave and wanted to be able to at least watch DVDs in my bedroom. The TV was on its way before I saw the reviews saying the DVD player does not work. Well, all I can say is, mine works just fine! I'm wondering if maybe the DVDs weren't inserted correctly (the shiny underside of the DVD must face out, toward the front like the TV screen does) or if people were trying to play Blu-Ray discs in the DVD player. (Geez! At the exceptional price of this TV, one should not expect a Blu-Ray player!)I hadn't really planned to do this with this TV, but when it came I unplugged my little purple Roku box (which is only capable of 720p) from the livingroom TV, plugged it in to the RCA TV, and it just fired right up with no problems whatsoever! It was already registered, so even the last movie I had been watching was set to resume right where I left off. Being an Amazon Prime user, the Roku opens up all kinds of content. Now I'm hoping to snag a really good deal on one of the 1080p models so I can get the full benefit of the higher resolution of this TV. I pulled up Pandora and let it play through the TV, and the sound was good enough that I listened to it for quite a while. (Speaking of listening, if you want to, you can set the TV to sound-only mode so the video is not on. This saves even more power than the energy-saving setting.)The TV is lightweight enough that I could literally unplug it and the Roku box, carry it all into the kitchen, learn to cook along with Julia Child, then bring it back into my bedroom to watch movies. It would be no harder to do this than moving a laptop, but the screen is bigger and easier on the eyes than my laptop screen and the sound is better, too.The sound at first seemed a little harsh to my ears, but I set it on the \"Soft\" sound setting, which minimizes treble and accentuates the bass, and it was perfect. Also, when I first did the setup, I scanned Air channels because I wasn't hooked up to a cable (or an antenna for that matter), and it didn't find any. I was afraid it wasn't going to work, but putting in a DVD automatically switches to DVD mode. Also, hitting Input on the remote pulls up the various input sources, and that's how I figured out that I needed to select HDMI to make my Roku work. Duh.I don't think you can beat this TV for the price. It's a tidy-sized TV you can tuck in just about anywhere, is a breeze to set up, and just works out of the box. I have not tested its use as a separate computer monitor for my laptop yet, but it does have a PC input mode. The manual's not the best I've ever seen, but it's serviceable. The various connections diagrams are exceptional.

One other complaint is we hav a 46 inch sharp tv that if you lay on the ground to watch tv you can still see the picture without any blackness. These 22 inch RCA models are not like that. If you want a clear image you have to be viewing it directly straight on for a clear image. We have bunk beds in one room and the top bunk you can see the picture great, however the lower bunk sees alot of black images. I would not recomend this model or any RCA model to anyone. This TV is labeled 1080 LCD, other LCD models I have seen viewed and owned you can sit at any angle and still see a decent looking screen.

It also includes input connections HDMI, Component, Composite, cable/antenna, VGA, PC Audio and USB. But the only out is a headphone jack. I don't understand why they would have all of these input options but limit the output to the internal speakers? They aren't horrible but like all internal speakers they aren't great. While the headphone out does work well with our Bose Solo it's not the same as high quality sound.Screen quality and adjustment are very good for a TV in this size and price range. DVD plays well but it isn't easy to find the right aspect ratio which seems to be true for most TVs these days since there are so many formats.While it is a minor complaint the screws to attach the stand are very deep and can only be reached by a straight Phillips screwdriver not one with detachable bits. Once the stand is attached plugging in the power cord is a bit of a struggle having to bend the cord a bit to get between the TV and the stand. Bending any electrical cord is not a good idea.At first glance having the cables come out the side seems like a pretty good idea except that the cables can stick out past the TV. Kinda ugly and again bending the cables to hide them is not a good idea.Another annoyance is that you have to turn the TV on and select the DVD as the source in order to eject the DVD.Power on and initial setup is quick and easy. It did take 15 minutes to find all of the channels on just a straight cable line with no box which is about typical. Setup and Menu are easy to access and follow. Remote control even has a feature to add to favorites and scroll only through favorite channels.Overall, this is a nice TV in this size and price range especially with the included DVD player. It works well in our bedroom. But limiting the sound quality makes this far from a perfect TV.", "Date": "November 26, 2012"}, {"Title": "Nice product! Looks like the kinks have been worked out", "Author": "D. Marvin", "ReviewID": "R155F2ZD5UF5N0", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "First off, I've noticed that this product has been plagued by several 1-star reviews that reflect an overall pretty poor rating for the product. The complaints stem not from the picture quality but from the lack of a functioning DVD player. RCA has gotten to the root of the problem and fixed it, which is why I suspect this particular item has been hand-selected for Vine Voices to review. I will do my due diligence because I have not had a single problem with the TV or DVD functionality. Some consumers may have been placing the DVD label side facing them (which is quite natural) which would result in improper reading of the disc/no playback. The underside of the disc needs to face you when you insert it and it works properly. If this is not the problem people were having, then RCA appears to have gone back in and fixed any technical problem(s) inherent with the units, as mine works perfectly!As for the TV itself, it is full HD (1080p) but it should be pointed out that with screen sizes below 32\", the difference between 720p and 1080p becomes quite negligible. But for the price, you might as well go for full-HD. The LCD picture is great: crisp and clean and you don't suffer \"screen burn-in\" (where halo effects or artifacts from images previously watched tend to linger once you've changed the channel, etc.) I've had the burn-in effect from an older big-screen plasma I have and am not much of a fan of it. Again, no problems here. If you are looking for a nice combo TV like this for a kitchen or bedroom, this will do nicely. One thing you have to take into consideration is that when you buy combo TV's (TV/DVD, TV/Blu-ray), you are almost always going to sacrifice some degree of quality in order to obtain the convenience of having both functions in a singular unit. So would you rather save space and have fewer cords or buy two separate, more soundly-designed products? The investment here is so low that I would find it to be worth it. Obviously, better deals are there for the taking around the time of year in which I am composing this review (Black Friday), but in general, this is a decent deal.", "Date": "November 22, 2012"}, {"Title": "The tv can't be repositioned forward or back so that the room light doesn't affect the picture.", "Author": "SUZY", "ReviewID": "RLB23PMJN39XN", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Right now I have a small book positioned under the base so that I can see the tv when I'm in bed.

It's not for you if you're looking for a primary TV for your home or possibly even a secondary TV for a bedroom.  It's only the size of a desktop iMac screen and it's actually lighter than an iMac. If you're a technophile and love all the latest bells and whistles, it's not for you either.  There are other choices, I'm sure.BUT if you're looking for a really nifty TV for, say, a guestroom, a kitchen, a home office, or maybe your kid's dorm room, this one may just fit the bill.Here's why I like it:  first, it's a combination TV and DVD.  Unlike some other reviewers, I had no problem with the DVD function.  All you do is press \"input\", select DVD, and slide the DVD into the slot on the side.The TV set works fine with intuitive onscreen menus and easy-to-use remote. I subscribe to DISH and the hardest part of this was remembering to plug in the DISH box!  Seriously, very little assembly is required and it takes maybe all of two or three minutes to get this TV set up and working.  For DISH users, just plug in the colored connectors and it's ready to go.The picture quality is just fine with good brightness and contrast levels. The resolution is surprisingly nice for a TV/DVD of this price point.  This LCD HD TV comes with some other cool features:  it has a USB port to play photos and music (I haven't tried it yet but will come back to update), it's wall-mountable and it comes with a swivel stand that takes four screws (included) to attach for tabletop mounting.All in all, when you consider the price, you would be hard-pressed to find and LCD/DVD combo like this.

It's effortless to get this TV set up and I've never experienced this with older model TVs. I'm new to HDTVs and it's just remarkable how fast the setup is....my very old VCR and my satellite service were working in just seconds. It sits comfortably in my cabinet and I like the black color a great deal, very sleek and stylish. The batteries for the remote control had expired which I find with most electronic purchases, so make sure you have a couple of AAA batteries just in case.The stand screws on easily and sits sturdy and level. You'll want to adjust some of the color and screen options to your personal liking and this again, very easy to do. Hitting the menu button will take you through all the options and the input button will give you Source select options like TV, VCR, AV, HDMI, Component, PC, Media or DVD. I popped in a DVD and this function also works perfectly. The TV/DVD combo is always a winner, I can see how this is such a wonderful *extra* to have on hand. At the moment, I don't have any HDMI products connected to the TV, like a Roku box, but this will be a snap as it'll be plug and play as well.

Not only does the cd/ dvd player work without fail, the colors are truer.  I took my rating down a star to reflect that there is a better, more reliable unit in this price range.  I can not comment on longevity, having only had it (the Hiteker) a month, but it did play every dvd I inserted, unlike the RCA, which accepted only 1 of the 3 (I tried it with the same 3, btw, there is nothing wrong with the dvds, it's the RCA.).  Original review appears below.  I personally can not see any reason to recommend this now that I know that there is a better unit with the same  specs in the same price range.  It seems from most of the reviews, that most people had problems with the dvd player. Caveat emptor-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------The RCA combo LCD HDTV/ DVD player is a nice and inexpensive solution for small rooms or small spaces.  The picture is very good, although having replaced several sets this year, and thus being able to compare it to other lcd TVs, I personally prefer the picture on the Coby Coby LEDTV2326 23-Inch 1080p 60Hz LED HDTV/Monitor (Black) What I liked especially about the coby was the richness of the colors.  It is a feature the RCA shares, but it is a bit too strong on this set making the colors pop a bit much and some of the movies I watched looked more like video games.  The resolution is obviously quite good as i was seeing pixilation on some of the movies, although I can't say that I have noticed that before, and it may go to the DVD player, which in my opinion is the weakest point on this set.  Set up of the Tv was pretty quick and easy, though I bypassed the channel search as i will be using it primarily with the dvd player (as the room it will be in does not have a cable, and we get too poor a signal for an antenna to be of much use). The first 2 disks i inserted produced a message of no disk present.  I double checked to make sure I had inserted them correctly, and then tried another disk.  the next 2 disks I inserted worked fine.  i do not know what the problem was, as the ones I had used were not recorded dvds, but purchased/ manufactured dvds which work in all of our other players.  The sound was somewhat tinny, but louder than you find on most TVs this size.  TV speakers are seldom any good and if good sound matters to you you are always better off getting separate speakers. That said, the sound on this Tv was loud enough that it could be used in a good size room, and tolerable, but not great.For those who want to hook it up to other devices, or use connections (out of reach to me), the set has component & composite connections as well as hdmi and VGA;  It has a fixed plastic stand (like the coby) meaning that while it has connections that enable it to be used as a monitor, it does not have the adjustability which most true monitors have.  The angle can not be adjusted, nor the height or tilt.  it is light enough to use as a wall mount, and so if used as a TV, all of that is solved in the frame.I believe the best use of this is in a small space where you do not have room for individual components, and so the multiple connection options are nice, but a bit off in a set that comes with a built in dvd player (although it does allow you to connect it to a stereo system, for example).It has a low energy mode, but it's rating is roughly 50% higher energy use than the coby (neither of them very high as lcd sets are very energy efficient). The RCA is rated at an estimated $9/ year vs. $6/ year for the coby.  Even with the highly inflated rates in Hawaii (roughly double anyplace else in the US) that is not very much, or even enough of a difference to be a deciding factor.Both the onscreen menus and remote are intuitive/ easy to use.  Personally I prefer the picture on the coby, but the two cost almost the same and this oen gives you a dvd player as well.  if you are  on a tight budget and do not already have an external player (or are buying one for a dorm room) this set is a reasonably good deal.  if you already have a dvd or blu ray player, i personally like the picture on the coby better (mostly for the color balance).In sum, I rated this 3 stars because it is about average for LCD TVs this size.  While it offers a good value for a combination unit, the dvd player doesn't work as well as any I have used.  The picture is crisp, the sound decent, and menus both on set and the remote are well laid out and intuitive.  It does, however, have a nice form feature in that the dvd player is built into the side of the set making it a very compact unit, good for people who are tight on space.", "Date": "November 20, 2012"}, {"Title": "Picture is terrible.
