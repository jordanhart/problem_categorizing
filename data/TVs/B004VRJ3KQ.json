I originally purchased a Hanspree and the sound was horrible.  The sound on this set is great, one of the best I have heard in a panel, and gets better with a little tweaking.As for the stand:  A lot of reviews say the stand his flimsy or horrible, and all I can say to those is that it sounds like they didn't put it together correctly or read the directions.  I was hesitant to buy it because of those reviews, but they aren't true.  There are 2 screw holes that can be missed if not paying attention.  I believe there are 6 screws total, and if done correctly it is very sturdy.  DO NOT be worried about the stand and enjoy a Samsung quality TV for under $300.

The sound was not important because I have it hooked up to my stereo.  The 32 inch one I just bought is in the living room and not hooked to a stereo - sound is OK at best.  Picture is brilliant. 5 stars for the picture, 3 for the sound.  And now the bad part - the stand is pitiful, it wobbles and leans and is simply not substantial enough for the TV.  I had to prop up the left side with a book and a coaster to get the thing to stay level.  The TV is set up in a wall cabinet, so it does not get bumped and I can live with the book propping it up, but I'm telling you the stand is practically worthless.  The stand gets '0' stars.  But since the picture is fantastic, and you might be buying it for wall mount and hooking to your stereo, these issues can be marginal for you.", "Date": "July 12, 2011"}, {"Title": "Good TV for sane price", "Author": "PRJ since1990", "ReviewID": "R1MTV5XS10TAPS", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I bought this set a few years ago (forgot to write a review on it) and it has stood the test of time. I've had no trouble with it in any sense save for a couple times the speakers acted up. To be completely honest, I'm not sure if there's an official term for when speakers output a static, distorted sound when a particular sound/pitch is played through them. Regardless, this happened a couple times.I haven't had this problem in quite some time so let me talk about why this is a decent set. If you're not looking for something obnoxiously large or high-end, this 32-inch is great, especially if you use it for gaming (like I do) and sit less than 8 feet away. The menus are easily navigated, the remote is nice and I haven't had any trouble with stability. It swivels about 25-30 degrees in both directions and has plenty of inputs (HDMI, Component, VGA, etc.) for all of today's technology.Don't be fooled by others reviews. For the price I paid, the quality is good, the size is just what I wanted, and this is a decent set for only being 720p.

The Samsung LCD's/LED's have the best picture on the market in my opinion, true blacks, vibrant but not overly saturated colors, and all of that jazz.For $300 it's a good deal on a basic, quality \"high end\" 32\" LCD with 2 HDMI outputs.  The TV also has one set of RCA audio inputs (red/white) and one set of component inputs.The problem I have with this type of model is that the RCA audio inputs do not carry a signal directly to, say, bookshelf speakers or even non-digital audio receivers, and there's no headphone jack.You will need a DVD player, VCR, media player or say, a digital cable box from your cable or satellite provider, or a \"digital\" (i.e. not analog) 5.1 audio system, to route sound out to separate speakers.So with my Samsung Blu-ray player, which has the RCA jack inputs, I get sound out to my Bose bookshelf speakers when I'm playing anything on the Blu-ray player, but not from the TV itself when I'm watching network TV or cable (since I do not have a digital cable box from my provider). Basically you need an audio signal coming from something other than the TV, or by using one of the HDMI slots, to bypass the TV's speakers. The RCA jacks on the TV are virtually useless (input only, no sound output in other words, from what I can gather).I hope this make sense to people contemplating this TV and that they are aware of this when purchasing it.  While the TV's factory speakers are not horrible by HD TV standards today, they are definitely not adequate for movie watching etc.., but I live with it for network/cable broadcasts, but enjoy a great picture and sound with my Blu-ray player or XBox.I can also connect the HDMI cable directly from my PC's video card to the TV's HDMI inputs and use it as a huge computer monitor.  The USB slot only seems to recognize USB thumb/flash drives, it would not recognize my 1TB external USB hard drive, for instance (but my Samsung Blu-Ray player takes care of that).", "Date": "November 9, 2011"}, {"Title": "Great TV for the price!!", "Author": "Cor Cor", "ReviewID": "R1FCOFO8BE31NY", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I Bought this on sale @ Best Buy.

I surveyed all (well....many of.....) the 32-inch HDTVs out there. At least the ones in the \"budget\" category.  I went to Best Buy.  Went to Wal-Mart.  I stood back.  I stared.  I reviewed specs and stats.  I vacillated between going \"cheap\" (a.k.a. \"no name\" or \"somewhat familiar\" name) and famous \"name brand\".  I run a moderately-sized independent inn  (hotel) with 20 rooms and needed to make a wise purchase.  I have a 65\" LG 3D TV at home purchased last Christmas through Amazon.  Love it...but after the \"dust settled\" in this 32-inch category.....I looked at prices and caught a sale at WallyWorld ($268)....with Best Buy matching it....I bought 20 of these babies.  Samsung....not LG.  WHY?..you ask?First....there is NO such thing as a non-\"flimsy\" TV base.  After taking the very first one out of the box...I saw part of the \"shaky problem\".  The metal frame and the shiny black plastic overlay do not fit perfectly together with every TV.  NO BIGGIE.  I estimated the engineering issue at about 1/32\"-1/64\" of \"play...front to back.  Solution? I got a cheap roll of RUBBER electrical tape (not vinyl), cut ONE 1-inch piece and tacked it on top of the base-bottom rubber pad (rear one).  VOILA.  No...more....wobble....or shake.  Sure....this COULD have been prevented with better production of the metal base and plastic molding....but what is....is.  C'mon people!  No need to bellyache....look for solutions!  It now has NO wobble.  Yeah...make sure that you \"crank\" in the 7 screws so they bottom out....and a slight extra crank.  You're done.  Attach your coax.....attach the power cord.....turn it on.....click...click....click.....wait for the channels to memorize (if you have cable, etc.) then wait the 10-15 minutes of plug-in-play programming to finish up.  Program the date and time.  Enjoy your TV.  Samsung has a great rating for a reason.  Clean.  Bright.  Crisp.Oh...the LG was my second choice....but I preferred the brightness/vibrancy of this Samsung.  Plus the \"swoopy\" design of the lower part of the TV frame in front seemed more \"modern\". I DO wish that there was a volume limiter option...but, alas....this is a consumer-grade TV...not an overpriced \"hotel grade\". SUPERB VALUE at this price point.  Oh....don't sweat the 60Hz vs. 120 or the 720p vs. 1080p.  At 32 inches.....your eyes/brain will HARDLY know the difference.  Sorta like the difference between 87 and 92 octane.  You'll hardly notice.  Except for the $50-$100 dollar difference.  I noticed THAT! BTW, there is NO \"tilt\" on this base.  I have NO idea where THAT previous comment came from....I may write more as time goes by.  For now....I have 12 more TVs to install.  Anyone want twenty-three 27-inch, 60lb CRT (tube) prehistoric TVs?  Goodwill, here I come....UPDATE 11/9/12:  I am still VERY please with this TV.  I have the open-box-to-all-set-up process down to 5 minutes (plus the self-programming which takes about 15 minutes).  Indeed, there is a consistent, very SLIGHT off-level issue with the stand base.  One 1-inch slice of rubber electrical tape on the REAR bottom pad is all it takes.  There are NO issues with ill-fitting screws AT ALL.  Just eat your spinach beforehand so you can put a bit of \"umph\" in your final twists - they are self-tapping.

I left the TV on in my bedroom for about an hour  and went into another room to do some work.  When I came back there was an extreme harsh smell in the room from the TV,  As I mentioned below, I own another Samsung TV and that TV has absolutely no smell..The smell, smelled like it was toxic. . Similar to the smell of plastic that had burned.  You could feel it in your eyes and throatI immediately contacted Amazon and they sent me a return authorization.  I wanted to get another TV, but the system wouldn't allow me to order a replacement, it would  only give me a refund.  I later found out the TV is now being sold by another vendor.If anyone is reading this from Samsung or Amazon, you should pick up the TV and find out what is wrong with it.Also, if anyone one from Amazon reads this, I still would like to get the same TV replaced.My review before I had to return the TV.I am going to start this review with the mounting base.  For anyone who has a hard time installing this base, I have posted pictures for your review on the product page.  I found it extremely easy to install the base, and  have no idea why anyone would have problems with this procedure. Samsung could not have written the  instructions any clearer.  As for the stability of the base, I feel it is fine.  The TV does wobble a little while moving the base, but when the base is placed in its final resting place, there will be no need to really touch the TV.  The TV on the base is stable.This is my second Samsung TV.  I have spend days looking at different televisions, and every time, I go right back to Samsung.  I thought I would save some money and  buy one of those $199.00 TV's.  I tried to convince  myself the picture was good, but it wasn't.  Also the sound on several lower priced TV's are very tinny. Back to the store the bargain priced TV went.Picture quality is great.  The picture is very sharp and the colors are very bright.  Sound quality is good.As I mentioned, this is the second Samsung TV I own.  Both of these TV's have just been plugged in.  I have not changed any color settings on either TV.Go to a store before you buy A TV.  Look at the the TV's.  You will notice Samsung TV's always look brighter and sharper than most of the other's.I give this TV 5 Stars.  Amazon is great to work with.  If you feel the TV you received has a problem, notify them.  They will work with you.  If your Amazon TV is defective , they will make arrangements for UPS to come to your front door and carry it out to their truck.

It was extremely easy to set up--you just attach the base into it.  The TV started its own setup program automatically when it was turned on. I recommend reading the directions FIRST, so you know what options to select. The set has a nice picture, comes on almost instantly, and the remote is easy to operate. (Disclaimer: I need only two of the buttons on the controller: on-off, and volume, as it is connected to a satellite receiver box.) Although very good, I rate it 4 stars because it is pretty basic--hard to give it the same number of stars as sets costing twice as much or sets having 1080p. Others I compared it with cost more, and didn't deliver all that much more than this basic Samsung. I considered a cheaper Sanyo, but this Samsung had a bit bigger picture (32 instead of 26) and is much narrower (shallower?) front-to-back so is more space-saving.  Also, the Samsung's reviews were mostly quite good, and the criticisms too picky and insignificant. Like complaints about the stand. Don't believe them--the stand is just fine, really easy to affix and plenty sturdy.  All you need is a decent phillips-head screwdriver to screw in the mere 7 screws. The illustrations in the directions show you how--very easy if you just look at it first. Screw them in until they completely stop (not just get harder to turn), and the connections will be plenty tight.  No wobble, no problems, with the stand. As for a chemical smell, there was a slight smell for a few days, but it was insignificant, like a \"new car smell,\" and is no longer present. As for the sound, I think it is typical of most flat screens. I had a Sirius-XM station on it and the music sounded just great to me. Get a surround-sound system, or just turn the volume up. Half-way is plenty loud in our sitting room. As for how long the set lasts, we'll just have to wait and see. I bought the extended warranty, just in case.  In summary, you can buy more expensive sets with more features and a higher resolution, but if you don't need to spend 33% to 50% more, why do so?  The quality is plenty good, too, in the Samsung. The store clerk said they had quite a few returns on the cheaper sets, and none on the Samsung 403 even with selling a large number of these.

(This is how I got it to work right.)", "Author": "Mwani Ngemi \"Mwani\"", "ReviewID": "R3ATQTVPF1DVCL", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I went into the Target near my house and this T.V looked the best to me out of the others in it's class. I wanted to purchase it but I decided to look on Amazon first to see what people were saying. Most reviews looked good except for people complaining about a wobbly stand. However some reviewers made it clear that they did not have much of a problem with the stand, and that by simply screwing the screws tightly they were able to make it work solidly. I went with my gut and encouraged by those reviews I purchased the T.V. I'm very glad I did! The T.V works great, and the picture quality is superb! As for the stand...When you are first screwing in the two screws that connect the top part of the stand to the bottom part...there will come a time when it feels like you've screwed them in all the way, but the stand will be able to tilt left and right. They are not screwed in all the way!!! In order to get the stand firmly stabilized, these first two screws must be screwed in until the top part of the stand does not tilt, left or right. Once you've accomplished that just follow the rest of the instructions and you're all set!At this point my T.V doesn't tilt at all and the stand and t.v are all firmly connected to the base.It's a great t.v set so far I'm really happy with it!(Update: Moved it to 4 stars from 5)This is still really a great T.V just know that it does not have any audio out ports, not even a headphone jack. This is really quite astonishing to me. In any case I was able to connect my Blu Ray player to my speakers through the Blu Ray Players audio out ports. It's working great. Still an amazing T.V as far as picture quality and price. I'm just shocked at this oversight. Either way it is an awesome buy if you don't absolutely need to have audio out ports.", "Date": "July 17, 2012"}, {"Title": "Samsung HDTV", "Author": "eme", "ReviewID": "R1E5JSCZWUC56V", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I looked at many TVs and reviews and I ended up going with this one.

I think others have commented on the sound...and the sound is okay.  We did change a setting on the sound in one of the menus and it did make a difference for the better.  I would not say that the sound is bad by any means, but on the other hand, it isn't just absolutely wonderful.  We don't have any other sound system hooked up to the TV and I think it sounds just fine.  When it comes down to it, if you are wanting a big wonderful sound, of course you are not going to get that from the little speakers on probably any small TV; you need to hook it up to a better audio source.  The picture on the TV itself is wonderful.  I feel like it was an amazing deal for the price.  I also like the \"touch screen\" type buttons on the front of the TV.  They are down on the lower left (not actually on the screen itself) and they completely blend in to the outer casing around the TV.  You can't see them unless you are looking for them.  They really aren't buttons--they are just a spot where you touch that can control the volume, turn off/on the TV, ect...  I am really, really happy with this TV.

Keck", "ReviewID": "R2VK2KHV1F9MBY", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "We bought this from Target @ $299 sale. Supposedly normally priced at $349. Variables for us that may differ from you: I've never had an HD TV before. We don't watch TV much. 720 is fine for us. We have fiber optic cables from when we used AT&T; briefly (don't use AT&T;!, but fiber-optic cables are good). We have Time Warner's basic cable again now, which is mostly the networks, cable's news channel, PBS, TBS, ION, CW, and government channels. We have *not* upgraded our cable package. We do not have a DVR or HD box or whatever. So far, we have used it only four days.Great deal. Got additional rewards through RedCard (5%), Target pharmacy rewards (5%), a special TV coupon from Target (5%). Along with some birthday money, we decided to get something we want, but don't necessarily need.My husband watched a lot of sports over the weekend. He said there was some fuzziness to it. I believe that may have to do with the speed of b-ball. This doesn't have a lightning fast refresh rate. Fine for us. I couldn't see any difference.I've noticed very little problem with the picture. With a few commercials, I've noticed a bit less fill in color on cheeks perhaps due to the lag of refresh, or due to 720p, or lack of HD pkg. Whatever. Doesn't matter.I've heard that showing non-HD TV on an HDTV could look worse because there would be fewer pixels and therefore a less clear picture. That hasn't been a problem for me, but I've not watched it much yet. May be what I just referred to above.The local networks are supposed to be delivering HD free. I think free through the air or on cable. We would have to pay more if we wanted HD on other channels.I have been extremely pleased with the improved picture (over old clunky 32\" TV). It makes people look wider sometimes. I suppose that is from the aspect ratio. There is probably a way to change the aspect ratio if you care. I personally prefer seeing people shaped more like me. :) We haven't even taken the plastic off of the screen yet, and I like the picture. Since the switch to HD broadcasting, we've had trouble on the old TV when trying to read type at the bottom or top of the screen. We don't have that problem anymore.I get the feeling that the cable company doesn't want you to know that you can use the TV and basic cable without any upgrade. :) They want you to think that you have to upgrade your package for an HDTV. It would cost more, but you would get more channels. At some price, I suppose you get a DVR as well. When I asked specifically, I did learn I could watch basic cable on an HDTV with caveats.We can play DVDs on it by hooking up the player. We could hook the cable back up to the old VCR if we wanted to record anything on the old TV. Yes, we are behind the times. But it is cheaper that way. The old TV is in a TV cabinet that can be closed to look like regular furniture, thank goodness. We still have videos that we play on it.We can hook the laptop up to the Samsung TV also to play DVDs. One of the laptops has a Blu-Ray DVD player. We can also use the Internet through the TV too. I think. But we haven't tried it yet. I will try streaming Hulu or something through the laptop to the TV. Should work.I have always thought the Samsung picture was better than other HDTVs. I've seen HDTVs at stores and at relatives' houses. So far, I'm pleased even without the HD service.If we ever have more income, the Time Warner Cable Co. has a pkg that is a little cheaper than the HD package. From what I understand, it improves the signal; it gives you more stations. The price is not much less than the basic HD package though. So if I had more money, I would probably go ahead to the basic HD pkg, even though it would give us tons more channels than we would need.We did not have any trouble attaching the base, as some did. It took just a couple minutes.This may be TMI, but I hope it's useful in some way. We are very pleased so far.

This behavior is classic \"bad capacitor\", but Samsung insists none of their TVs made after 2008 had bad caps, and do not cover newer TVs under their \"Capacitor Settlement\", under which all repair shipping costs are covered by the company. (The manufacturing date for my TV is December 2011.)I went online to try and get service for the TV, only to discover that Samsung DOES NOT PROVIDE IN-HOME SERVICE FOR TVs UNDER 40\". I was going to have to box and send the TV to the New Jersey service center myself. That would have cost about $40, which is more than 10% of the value of the TV.I chatted with an online agent who insisted that I would have to bear the cost of shipping the TV to the service center. When I complained and said I was going to post a negative review here, he suggested that he could escalate the issue to the \"Executive Customer Relations Department\", and that I could ask them to provide me with a UPS label for free outbound shipping (return shipping is covered in any case).I am now waiting for a call from the ECRD; once (if) I receive it I will update this review.", "Date": "May 21, 2012"}, {"Title": "Completely Satisfied & No Problem With Base", "Author": "RJ", "ReviewID": "R2Y90JZEIXTUN1", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I don't understand some of the negative reviews for this Samsung.
